# AASA experiences renaissance
## Group undergoes growth as it enters third decade 
### Quan Phung Staff writer 
After 20 years and many
changed attitudes, the Asian
American Student Association is
experiencing a renaissance of
cultural, social and political ac
tivity that has led the
organization to pursue an
agenda AASA's founders could
only envision.
Mobilizing the diverse groups
of Asian-Americans at Stanford
toward common goals and
ideals, AASA today is more ac
tive than in past years, provid
ing an array of social and
cultural activities as well as ac
tively pursuing the development
of Asian-American studies pro
grams.
Rick Yuen, the newly ap
pointed assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs and director of the
Asian American Activities Cen
ter, noticed AASA's impact on
the Asian-American community
here immediately when he
stepped on campus. "Students
are really interested in par
ticipating in activities," he said.
Judy Wu, co-chair of AASA's
Issues Committee, said that as
a result of the success of the
Asian American Students Ori
entation Committee's presenta
tion at "The Fire Within"
program, more than 300 stu
dents jammed into the activities
center to attend the first AASA
meeting this year.
These numbers have in
creased significantly from the
days earlier in the decade when
five to seven AASA members
met during winter quarter in a
cold room at the Old Firehouse,
according to Elsa Tsutaoka,

class of '87, a former AASA
member and now a full-time
staff member at the activities
center.
The fervor and excitement of
AASA today is reminiscent of
the Asian-American group orig

inally founded by alumni Nelson
Dong and Jay Wong 20 years
ago this week.

American Student Association.
Stanford Asian-American commu
nity in 1969. Together, they
formed AASA, then called the
Asian American Student Alliance,
to try to coalesce the different
attitudes within the Asian-
American community. In light of
the negative perceptions of Asian-
Americans during the Vietnam
War, the founders tried to unite
the Asian-American students in a
common vision.
Dong says today that there was
a growing need for a "deeper ex
pression of the (Asian-American)
soul." And AASA was the ideal
vehicle for friends to come to
gether and share common con
cerns on issues such as parental
expectations and the taboo
against interracial dating.
Dong notes that AASA was spe
cifically patterned after groups
like the Black Student Union and
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group. "We saw that our
grievances were analogous to
their situation," he said.
As a result, AASA sought the
support and cooperation of the
BSU and MEChA in many of its
pursuits. What today is known as
the Agenda for Action coalition
stems from the cooperation of
these three ethnic groups in the
late '60s and early '70s.
Dong specifically remembers a
"takeover" of the conference room
at Bowman Alumni Center by
these three student groups to
protest the fact that the BSU
members were the only ones the
University chose to lobby in Wash
ington, D.C. against the invasion
of Cambodia.
According to Dong, their protest
forced then-Provost Richard
Lyman to increase the delegation
to include Chicano/Latino and
Asian-American students as well
as blacks.
The Vietnam War, however, was
only one of the many issues AASA
took up. Dong and friends at
tempted to educate the University
about what it means to be Asian-
American.
Dong wrote proposals for Okada
House and the Teahouse, two
ideas which later became perma
nent institutions at Stanford. In
addition, AASA offered two
courses in Asian-American
studies through the Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social
Issues program.

Because there was no one qual
ified to teach Asian-American
studies on campus, AASA
recruited an Asian-American from
a local high school to teach one
of the courses.
In its initial stages, AASA was
"reasonably successful," Dong
said. More than 100 people
showed up for the initial open
meeting, according to co-founder
Wong. And 15 to 50 people were
active participants in subsequent
meetings.
But after the founders gradu
ated, interest in AASA waned.
Wong explained that many
Stanford Asian-Americans were
concerned that their involvement
with AASA meant they were being
ethnocentric. Questions such as
"Is it important for Asians to do
things together?" and "Why set
yourself aside instead of integrat
ing yourself?" were asked by
many Asian-Americans, Wong
said.

As a result, AASA underwent
many changes in those interim
years, both in leadership and in
purpose. Wong explained that
"each new group of student
leaders had different interests."
The group has been sporadically
active and inactive, depending on
factors such as student interest,
level of University support and
the social and political climate.
Recently, however, because of
the increase in the Asian-
American population at Stanford,
interest in AASA has hit an all
time high. In the winter of 1987,
AASA opened the doors of its new
activities center in the Old Union
Clubhouse to the growing number
of Asian-American students on
campus.
According to Wu, the parallel
growth of social and cultural
events and political activity is im
portant because "they are in
tegrally connected. Without one,
you could not have the other."
