When an employee of the De

quit and charged the University

When a chemistry graduate stu
dent suffered health problems as
a result of what he alleges was
University negligence, he turned
to lawyer John Shaffer.
When a nurse suffered health
problems she thinks were related
to the Stanford Hospital's use of
an outdated and inadequate in
fectious waste incinerator, she
turned to lawyer John Shaffer.

In the first suit — on behalf
of former Health and Safety em

In his lawsuit on behalf of
chemistry graduate student
Daniel Wisner, Shaffer is trying
to establish that Stanford was
negligent in giving every campus
building a clean bill of health —
that there was no "clear and pres

an extensive record of safety prob
