# Local attorney on safety crusade
## Intransigent University tries to check him at every turn

When an employee of the De
partment of Health and Safety
quit and charged the University
with intimidation to keep him
from talking to the press, he
turned to Palo Alto lawyer John
Shaffer.

News analysis

When a chemistry graduate stu
dent suffered health problems as
a result of what he alleges was
University negligence, he turned
to lawyer John Shaffer.
When a nurse suffered health
problems she thinks were related
to the Stanford Hospital's use of
an outdated and inadequate in
fectious waste incinerator, she
turned to lawyer John Shaffer.

In the first suit — on behalf
of former Health and Safety em
ployee Jon Moldestad — Shaffer
won a settlement of $200,000.
And that, University lawyers
say, is all Shaffer is going to get
out of Stanford.
But despite the University's op
position, Shaffer continues the
crusade to help right what's
wrong and fix what's broke at
Health and Safety.
If change in safety practices in
the last two years is any measure
of his success, Shaffer's crusade
is a Cinderella story. Since he
started his litigation against Stan
ford, remarkable changes have
been afoot in Health and Safety.
Top officials have been ousted
from their positions, many of the
most dangerous laboratories have
been scrubbed clean, and safety
has become a top priority for the
University.
Now, more than six months

after the settlement of the highly
publicized Moldestad case, Shaffer
is being accused of harassing the
University and being "abusive" in
his dealings with University offi
cials. Shaffer counters that he is
just trying to establish whether
the University is still being
negligent with its safety practices.
In his ongoing safety quest,
Shaffer has compiled voluminous
documents about toxic spills,
safety protocols and worker
health problems. And he can't
seem to get enough.
In his lawsuit on behalf of
chemistry graduate student
Daniel Wisner, Shaffer is trying
to establish that Stanford was
negligent in giving every campus
building a clean bill of health —
that there was no "clear and pres
ent danger" — when there was
an extensive record of safety prob
lems in some laboratories.
Shatter has requested of the
courts that Stanford release
volumes and volumes of docu
ments about campus safety.
He has requested all documents
written this decade concerning the
handling, storage and disposal of
hazardous materials for more
than 20 buildings on campus. Also
on his wish-list is every document
relating to every report on safety
this decade and every document
concerning any job-related health
problem.
Shaffer is requesting just about
every document on Health and
Safety that could in any way be
damaging to the University. And
University lawyers won't budge.
He is receiving far fewer docu
ments than he would like, and the
ones he is getting are heavily
edited. Stanford lawyers are ar
guing that Shaffer has no need
to have all of those documents.
♦ "Stanford objects to this re
quest on the grounds that it is
vague, ambiguous and uncertain,
unduly burdensome, oppressive

and harassing, overbroad and ir
relevant," wrote Stanford's staff
counsel Debra Zumwalt as part
of a scathing objection to Shaffer's
requests.
Shaffer says he needs all the
documents to show that Stanford
deliberately swept certain facts
under the rug when they made
the statement that the University
had no imminent threat to health.
"To say that there was no dan
ger was just not accurate," Shaf
fer says. He acknowledges,
though, he will have difficulty
finding a "smoking gun," in part
because the University will not
give him access to many of the
documents he wants.
But in a recent sworn deposition
relating to the Wisner suit, Shaf
fer says, Internal Audit Director
Peter Millington admitted that
the SRI International report —
which triumphantly declared that
"no clear and present danger" ex
isted on campus — was inade
quate. Millington approved the
report anyway.
Millington was out of town and
could not be reached for comment.
To find the elusive "smoking
gun," Shaffer is taking deposi
tions, or sworn testimonies, from

some of the other people he thinks
are principle players in the Wisner
suit.
Included in that list is Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
University lawyers argue that
Kennedy has no direct knowledge
of Health and Safety matters and
that everything he knows is
second-hand information
prepared by Health and Safety of
ficials.
Furthermore, they say, Shaffer
is trying to "harass" Stanford and
is likely to be "abusive" to Ken
nedy. To prevent what it considers
to be a real risk of abuse — in
which they think Shaffer will
scold Kennedy — Stanford is ob
jecting to Shaffer's requests.
In court documents filed last
week, Zumwalt presented a
laundry list of what she says was
"abusive" behavior by Shaffer.
She even cites the time he refused
her bathroom privileges in the
middle of a deposition.
Shaffer is unfazed by the criti
cisms. "I take pleasure. It's a
joke," Shaffer says. "They beget
me mystical powers."
Shaffer will file papers later

this week detailing why he wants
to talk to Kennedy. Among other
things, Shaffer says he hopes to
establish exactly why Kennedy
chose to make a public statement
that campus laboratories were
perfectly safe.
"I think the substance (of the
University's argument) is defi
cient," he says."I will be surprised
if they prevail.
"The chief executive officer
(Kennedy) is the one who is in
charge," he says."He was obvi
ously intimately involved in the
issue of toxics in the years in
volved."
But in the matter of Kennedy's
deposition, the University is hold
ing the trump card. Despite nu
merous requests since Kennedy
became president in 1980, the
University has fought the attempt
to depose Kennedy tooth and nail.
Not once has the court granted a
request for a deposition.
"No one is above the process of
law," retorts Shaffer. "I think ac
countability is the issue here. It
will be interesting to see whether
Stanford gets the president off the
hook for this one."
