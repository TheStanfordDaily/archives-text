# Ambiguous flier creates confusion
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Confusion erupted yesterday in
Florence Moore Dining Hall over
a shocking flier advertising an ar
tistic performance by Corey Davis,
an Ujamaa House resident assis
tant, to be held in Elliott Program
Center tonight.
Several students approached
Flo Mo East Resident Fellow Step
hen Fuller and expressed their
concern about the apparent racist
message of the flier. Modeled after
an actual slave auction handbill,
the flier reads "AMERICA an
nounces its public sale of
Negroids."
The flier goes on to announce
tonight's performances and a
preview of the show that was to
be held in White Plaza this after
noon. In small letters at the bot

torn of the flier is a clarification
saying that the flier is "an adver
tisement for AMERICA:
Countdown to Liberation, an ar
tistic performance."
Davis said he was "not sur
prised" that the flier stirred up a
reaction. He added that he
thought the concern about the
flier arose because the message
"hits too close to home for
people."
"AMERICA" is an improvisa
tional performance which com
bines many artistic forms includ
ing film, music and dance to pres
ent a disturbing vision of a cor
poration named AMERICA which
produces robotic negroids. The
performance explores racial
stereotypes and attitudes in this
country, Davis said.
According to Fuller, the prob
lem with the flier was that it had

no context.
"A student approached me with
the flier, I read it and thought it
was quite offensive," Fuller said.
"When I read that it was a per
formance, I suspected that some
one was trying to use a coy way
of drawing a large audience, but
a lot of people were really upset
the flier had no context.
"The flier should have said the
show was put on by black students
from Ujamaa," Fuller added.
After he read the flier, Fuller
and several RAs removed the
fliers from Flo Mo dining room
tables.
According to Davis, 200 copies
of the flier were printed and dis
tributed in Rranner Hall, Stern
Hall, Wilbur Hall, I-agunita Court
and Governor's Corner in addition
to Florence Moore Hall.
