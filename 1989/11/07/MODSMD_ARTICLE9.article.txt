# Relics of the Cold War
## Stanford's fallout shelters, vestiges of the '60s, decay in glasnost era 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Stanford's unused nuclear fall
out shelters, once maintained as
safe havens from the terrors of
World War 111, are now slowly
decaying and have been forgotten
by the vast majority of students,
faculty and staff.
With the spirit of glasnost
sweeping the communist world,
civilian preparation for nuclear
war has lost its momentum. The
civil defense drills of the 1960s
only dwell in memories, and the
nuclear fallout shelters that once
could be found across the nation
have deteriorated and been for
gotten.
"The shelters haven't been
utilized for years," said Frank
Jurian, assistant director of public
safety. Most shelters have been
emptied, he said, adding that shel
ters which still contain supplies
have not yet been emptied because
of financial constraints. "There
just aren't available funds right
now to dispose of the supplies,"
he said.
The doors to all the shelters
are locked, and only the keys to
the shelter below Casa Zapata
could be located.
Tony Burciaga, resident fellow

at Zapata, said, "I've been an RF
here for five years and I don't
know (anything)" about the fall
out shelter in Zapata's basement.
The door to the Zapata shelter
carries a tiny sticker which reads
"Fallout Shelter — Inspected
1972 — The shelter supplies in
side were inspected this year by
the owner — your local govern
ment."
Inside the dark, cramped and
dank room is an odd mixture of
old and new. Like most former
shelters on campus, it is some
times used for storage. Alongside
Macintosh computer boxes and
magazines dated "July 1986" are
fallout medical kits and 17-1/2 gal
lon canisters of water dated "July
1962."
"Those were the rough days,"
said retired Fire Chief John
Marston about the Cuban Missile
Crisis era. During the early 1960s
"the government made a survey
of the best places on campus for
fallout shelters," Marston said.
The federal government chose the
basements of Stern, Wilbur and
Roble Halls, he said.
The shelters contained medical
kits, water canisters and food,
such as crackers and biscuits, said
Marston, who retired in 1975.
"The directors of the dorms were

very organized in case we had a
red alert" and were ready to direct
students into the shelters, he said.
Marston was a member of the
committee in charge of the shel
ters and civil defense on campus.
Carolyn Stewart, a librarian at
Cubberley Library, said the Edu
cation Building's basement was
once a shelter but is now used to
store books. "One after another
of the water canisters started to
leak," she said. "It took some
doing, but we got the government
to remove them in the late 19705."
Terry McGovern, the former
manager of Student Housing and
Facilities who retired last week,
said fallout shelters were installed
after 1963 in the basements of
high rise apartment buildings
such as Escondido Village, as well
as in other dorms on campus.
"The doors were locked for 20
years," McGovern said, noting
that in the last five to ten years
the supplies were removed and
discarded to make room for
storage.
Few other campus officials had
information about the shelters.
"I've been here for ten years, and
I've been through the bowels of
campus, and I know very little
about the shelters," said Ben
Asaro, manager of Special Proj

ects. "I do remember cleaning out
a basement that had big old bar
rels of water that were about
ready to split open."
Apparently, the shelter at
Zapata has been used in the past
few years and still contains
magazines, clothes and Macintosh
computer boxes alongside the fall
out supplies. But Zapata's Resi
dent Computer Coordinator Erik
Peterson said that although he
knew the shelter existed, he had
no idea it contained computer sup
plies.
Other campus offices such as
the Housing Management Office
and Facilities Project Manage
ment had little or no information,
and even the Santa Clara County
Office of Emergency Services was
unaware of the existence of the
Stanford shelters.
The Zapata shelter was hap
hazardly filled with old supplies.
The medical kit contained a vari
ety of essential survival items,
such as bandages, cotton, penicil
lin, baking soda, soap, water
purification tablets and syringes.
All the liquid medicine had long
since crystallized.
The Zapata shelter also con
tained, among other items, can
openers, napkins, wire, toilet
paper and commode lids.

Terry McGovern, the former
manager of Student Housing and
Facilities who retired last week,
said fallout shelters were installed
after 1963 in the basements of
high rise apartment buildings
such as Escondido Village, as well
as in other dorms on campus.
"The doors were locked for 20
years," McGovern said, noting
that in the last five to ten years
the supplies were removed and
discarded to make room for
storage.
Few other campus officials had
information about the shelters.
"I've been here for ten years, and
I've been through the bowels of
campus, and I know very little
about the shelters," said Ben
Asaro, manager of Special Proj

ects. "I do remember cleaning out
a basement that had big old bar
rels of water that were about
ready to split open."
Apparently, the shelter at
Zapata has been used in the past
few years and still contains
magazines, clothes and Macintosh
computer boxes alongside the fall
out supplies. But Zapata's Resi
dent Computer Coordinator Erik
Peterson said that although he
knew the shelter existed, he had
no idea it contained computer sup
plies.
Other campus offices such as
the Housing Management Office
and Facilities Project Manage
ment had little or no information,
and even the Santa Clara County
Office of Emergency Services was
unaware of the existence of the
Stanford shelters.
The Zapata shelter was hap
hazardly filled with old supplies.
The medical kit contained a vari
ety of essential survival items,
such as bandages, cotton, penicil
lin, baking soda, soap, water
purification tablets and syringes.
All the liquid medicine had long
since crystallized.
The Zapata shelter also con
tained, among other items, can
openers, napkins, wire, toilet
paper and commode lids.

The fallout shelter under Zapata is one of several Stanford shelters
that, although stocked with supplies, has fallen into disrepair.
Stanford's unused nuclear fall
out shelters, once maintained as
safe havens from the terrors of
World War 111, are now slowly
decaying and have been forgotten
by the vast majority of students,
faculty and staff.
With the spirit of glasnost
sweeping the communist world,
civilian preparation for nuclear
war has lost its momentum. The
civil defense drills of the 1960s
only dwell in memories, and the
nuclear fallout shelters that once
could be found across the nation
have deteriorated and been for
gotten.
"The shelters haven't been
utilized for years," said Frank
Jurian, assistant director of public
safety. Most shelters have been
emptied, he said, adding that shel
ters which still contain supplies
have not yet been emptied because
of financial constraints. "There
just aren't available funds right
now to dispose of the supplies,"
he said.
The doors to all the shelters
are locked, and only the keys to
the shelter below Casa Zapata
could be located.
Tony Burciaga, resident fellow

at Zapata, said, "I've been an RF
here for five years and I don't
know (anything)" about the fall
out shelter in Zapata's basement.
The door to the Zapata shelter
carries a tiny sticker which reads
"Fallout Shelter — Inspected
1972 — The shelter supplies in
side were inspected this year by
the owner — your local govern
ment."
Inside the dark, cramped and
dank room is an odd mixture of
old and new. Like most former
shelters on campus, it is some
times used for storage. Alongside
Macintosh computer boxes and
magazines dated "July 1986" are
fallout medical kits and 17-1/2 gal
lon canisters of water dated "July
1962."
"Those were the rough days,"
said retired Fire Chief John
Marston about the Cuban Missile
Crisis era. During the early 1960s
"the government made a survey
of the best places on campus for
fallout shelters," Marston said.
The federal government chose the
basements of Stern, Wilbur and
Roble Halls, he said.
The shelters contained medical
kits, water canisters and food,
such as crackers and biscuits, said
Marston, who retired in 1975.
"The directors of the dorms were

very organized in case we had a
red alert" and were ready to direct
students into the shelters, he said.
Marston was a member of the
committee in charge of the shel
ters and civil defense on campus.
Carolyn Stewart, a librarian at
Cubberley Library, said the Edu
cation Building's basement was
once a shelter but is now used to
store books. "One after another
of the water canisters started to
leak," she said. "It took some
doing, but we got the government
to remove them in the late 19705."
