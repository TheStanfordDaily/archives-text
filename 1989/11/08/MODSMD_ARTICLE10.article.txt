First Namibian voters
One of the first Namibians to vote in elections yesterday carried a SWAPO flag. Voters braved
95 degree heat and mile-long lines In Katutura, Namibia to participate in polls that will pave
the way for Namibian independence after 74 years of South African rule. No serious political
violence was reported, despite lingering animosities from a 23-year civil war.
