BERLIN (AP) - East Ger
many's government resigned yes
terday amid growing nationwide
unrest, a continuing exodus of
thousands of its people and pleas
from within the Communist Party
for a sweeping top-level shakeup.
Also yesterday, one day after
the government introduced a pro
posed law promising up to 30 days
of travel to the West, a parliamen
tary committee rejected the mea
sure and urged a new law allowing
unrestricted stays abroad.
The 44-member Council of Min
isters resigned jointly, government
spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said.
The cabinet, led by 75-year-old
Premier Willi Stoph, has little
power and implements policy
made by the Communist Party's
ruling Politburo. Stoph and
several other ministers also are
Politburo members.
"We appeal to the citizens who
intend to leave our republic to
reconsider their step once more.
Our socialist fatherland needs
everyone," said a statement issued
by the outgoing cabinet.
Since early Saturday, more than
28,000 East Germans have fled
to the West through neighboring
Czechoslovakia. They arrived in
West Germany yesterday at the
rate of 120 an hour.
The government will remain in
office until Parliament elects a
new Council of Ministers, Meyer
said. He did not say when such
an election would occur. The
party's Central Committee was to
meet Wednesday to consider fur
ther changes.
Several Communist officials
and three small parties allied with
the Communists have urged the
Politburo itself to resign.

Several... have
urged the Politburo
itself to resign

Leaders "should resign without
any delay" to make way for a new
Politburo and a new Cabinet that
will implement reforms, said the
East Berlin newspaper Junge
Welt, organ of the country's Com
munist Youth organization.
At least eight Politburo jobs
were on the line at a meeting
yesterday.
New party leader Egon Krenz
has said five elderly Politburo
members closely associated with
former leader Erich Honecker will
be replaced by the end of the week.
Two other Politburo members lost
their jobs Oct. 18 when Krenz took
over.
The Politburo, which normally
has 21 members, also discussed
an "action program" that Krenz
has said would contain sweeping
political and economic reforms.
As the government resigned and
the Politburo met, about 5,000
people marched in East Berlin to
protest election fraud and urge
free elections. Police did not in
tervene as the demonstrators
challenged the Communists'
monopoly on power and shouted:
"All power to the people."
On Monday, 750,000 demon
strators took to the streets in
cities around the country, with
about 500,000 in Leipzig alone.
East Germany's embattled
leaders have been promising dem
ocratic reforms and eased travel
restrictions in hopes of halting the

growing unrest. But a draft al
lowing 30 days of travel to the
West failed to curb discontent.
The constitutional committee of
Parliament rejected the measure
in its present form just one day
after it was published, the state
run news agency ADN said.
"The proposed does not meet
the expectations of citizens .. .
and will not achieve the political
credibility of the state," the com
mittee said.
The panel recommended lifting
the need for exit visas, separating
travel regulations from immigra
tion rules, clarifying the access to
foreign currency for trips abroad,
reconsidering the 30-day limit and
changing grounds on which pass
ports can be refused.
The committee also urged an
emergency Parliament session to
discuss the tense situation and
find ways of persuading skeptical
citizens to remain at home.
The latest surge of refugees
began early Saturday when East
Germay began allowing them to
leave via Czechoslovakia, the only
country to which East Germans
can travel freely.
The new escape route created
the first free passage to the West
since the Berlin Wall went up in
1961. Authorities have said that
route will remain open until a new
travel law takes effect.
So far this year, more than
175,000 East Germans, more
than 1 percent of the population
of 16.6 million, have moved to
West Germany by emigrating
legally, escaping or failing to
return from approved trips
abroad. West Germany gives them
automatic citizenship and help in
starting new lives.
