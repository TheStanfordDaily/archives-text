# Wilder victorious in Virginia, becomes first black governor
## 
### 
(AP) — L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia,
the grandson of slaves, forged a slender
lead yesterday in his bid to become the
nation's first elected black governor.
Democratic Rep. James Florio won the
New Jersey governorship handily, ending
eight years of Republican control.
Democrat David Dinkins sought tri
umph as New York City's first black
mayor in the third high-profile race of
off-year elections enlivened by the com
bustible mix of race and abortion.
In the sole congressional seat on the

ballot, early returns put city councilman
Anthony Hall and state Sen. Craig Wash
ington far out front in an 11-way Texas
race to succeed the late Rep. Mickey
Leland. Neither Democrat was gaining
50 percent of the vote needed to avoid a
runoff.
Democratic National Chairman Ron
Brown claimed victory for Wilder and
Dinkins as well as Florio, and GOP chair
man Ix»e Atwater did not dispute him.
Atwater said abortion "made a differ
ence" for the pro-choice Democratic can

didates in all three races but said the
results would have no bearing on the
1990 elections.
With 91 percent of the Virginia pre
cincts counted, Lt. Gov. Wilder had
806,489 or 51 percent. Republican rival
J. Marshall Coleman had 785,230 or 49
percent.
With 53 percent of the New Jersey
precincts counted, Florio, who twice
before lost gubernatorial races, had
757,313 or 61 percent. Rep. James
Courter had 474,925 or 39 percent, and

conceded defeat.
In New York's race, Republican
Rudolph Giuliani took a lead in early
returns, but CBS, NBC and ABC all said
based on polling place interviews with
voters that Dinkins would win. Votes
from 7 percent of the precincts gave
Giuliani 66,839 or 59 percent and Dinkins
44,810 or 39 percent.
Dinkins, the 62-year-old Manhattan
borough president, ran as the man who
could bring racial harmony to the nation's
largest city. Giuliani, 45 and a former

U.S. attorney making his first try for
elective office, hammered away at his
rival's transfer of stock to a son and his
failure to file income-tax returns for four
years two decades ago.
The Virginia contest focused on abor
tion as much as race, with Wilder em
phasizing his pro-choice views. The issue
seemed to spill over to the lieutenant
governor's race, as well, as pro-choice
Democrat Don Beyer defied the pre
election polls to score a victory.
