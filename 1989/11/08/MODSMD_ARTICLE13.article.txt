MOSCOW (AP) - Anti-
Communist marchers, striking
workers and clashes between
police and protesters vied yester
day with a scaled-down military
parade on Red Square as the So
viet Union celebrated the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution.
Even President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev tempered the Revolution
Day festivities by saying the na
tion's economic problems hang
like a "sword of Damocles over
us."
A column of about 5,000 mar
chers paraded peacefully through
Moscow to challenge Communist
Party authority, while a few miles
away, Gorbachev and other
leaders celebrated the 72nd anni
versary of the revolution by re
viewing the traditional show of
military force.
Activists in the southwest re
public of Moldavia said police
broke up a crowd of thousands of
would-be protesters and beat
some of them. The military pail
of the parade in its capital, Kis
hinev, was canceled.
In the Arctic city of Vorkuta,
striking coal miners joined the of
ficial celebration, but carried

slogans demanding more indepen
dence and that the government
fulfill promises of better living
and working conditions.
In some trouble spots, such as
the Caucasus republics of Ar
menia and Georgia, state-run
media said traditional parades
were canceled. Boris Sokolov, an
activist from the Baltic republic
of Latvia, said a small group of
people burned a red Soviet flag
in the center of Riga, the capital.
Gorbachev, interviewed by So
viet TV atop Lenin's Mausoleum
in Red Square, acknowledged that
many Soviets feel threatened by
food shortages and the disor
ganization of the consumer mar
ket.
"When all this is hanging like
a sword of Damocles over us, it
is very important we do not forget
the main thing, that this is the
way we have chosen to follow,"
he said, referring to the Greek
legend in which a sword was
strung by a single hair over the
head of Damocles, a royal atten
dant, to show the precariousness
of power.
Gorbachev said the Soviet lead
ership has not yet been able to

replace fully the administrative
system of the past, and "thus
there exists a loss, or a weakening
of control. Shall we go back? That
would be a mistake, the greatest
mistake."
The anniversary marks the day
in 1917 when the Bolsheviks un
der Lenin seized power from a
provisional government that had
ruled for about eight months after
Czar Nicholas II abdicated.
Those who marched more than
four hours in the unofficial
column made clear they believed
the revolution had gotten them
little but food shortages, pollution,
and the KGB secret police.
"We're tired of 70 years of Com
munist power with nothing
having changed for the better, and
this is our protest," said Taisya
Shlyonova, a retiree. One placard
characterized communist rule as
"72 years on the road to
nowhere."
In Vorkuta in the Soviet Arctic,
coal miners who have been on
strike for two weeks joined the
official celebration, but with their
own banners, said city strike com
mittee spokesman Pavel Belyaev.
