Jammer doesn't work
WASHINGTON IAP) — The Defense Depart
ment acknowledged yesterday that a planned $9
billion system for jamming enemy radar "has
problems," and that a review has been
ordered to determine whether the program will
proceed.
The program came under fire in September
when Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., called it a "poten
tial waste of billions of dollars" and quoted Navy
documents that called the system "marginally
operationally effective."
The Airborne Self-Protection Jammer will
deceive or jam enemy radar and will be carried
aboard Navy and Air Force fighter planes, in
cluding the F-14, F-18, F-16 and AV-88.
The Defense Department planned to produce
2,369 of the jammers at a total cost of $9.4
billion over the expected 20-year life of the pro
gram. So far, $681 million has been spent.
Israel raids guerrillas
NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli air force
jets rocketed bases of the Shiite Moslem guerrilla
group Hezbollah in southeastern Lebanon yes
terday morning. There were no immediate reports

of casualties.
Reporters in Nabatiyeh said at least two
helicopters were involved in the attack. Smoke
billowed from the stricken targets as ground
defenders fired at the Israeli aircraft with anti
aircraft guns. No hits were observed.
No reason for the raid was given, but military
officials have several times accused guerrillas of
Hezbollah of taking part in attacks in the security
zone or of attempting to infiltrate Israel through
the border strip.
Greenhouse conference fails
NOORDWIJK, Netherlands (AP) — Industrial
nations, which produce two-thirds of the gas
emissions associated with global warming, were
still divided at the end of a conference yesterday
on how to reduce them.
At the two-day conference of 68 nations on
ways to slow or halt dangerous climatic changes,
the United States, Japan and Soviet Union
refused to commit themselves to stabilizing emis
sions of carbon dioxide and other gases by the
year 2000.
Environmentalists said the reservations to the
final declaration were a setback to efforts against
the "greenhouse effect," the gradual warming of
Earth's atmosphere.
