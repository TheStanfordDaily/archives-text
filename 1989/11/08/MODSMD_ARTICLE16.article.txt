## The 						future is quaky 
### 
JUST SAY IT.
The University needs to
make a clear and unequivocal
statement about the fate of the
co-ops damaged and closed by the
quake.
And that statement should be:
"Houses that were co-ops before
the Oct. 17 earthquake will still
be co-ops when they are reopened."
Period.
Residents of co-ops have been
nervous about the fate of their
homes for many years, even before
the quake closed seven of the eight
Stanford co-ops. All but three
houses — Columbae, Phi Psi and
Synergy — have been reopened.
Since the quake, their fears have
emerged in statements like, "This
is a prime time for the University
to end co-ops. Our way of life is
vital to us, and I have a feeling
we're going to get screwed" (The
Daily, Oct. 20) and"I think the

University is kind of happy that
some of the houses are down so
they can use the land for different
things" (The Daily, Nov. 3).
Hopefully, these fears are en
tirely groundless, and the Univer
sity will lose no time in dispelling
them.
Row and Cluster Facilities Man
ager Lucy Williams, a former co-op
resident, has said, "Personally
speaking, co-ops are dear to my
heart. I can't think of anyone who
wants to close them down" (The
Daily, Nov. 3). However, a more
official statement of policy needs
to be made.
For many students, living in a
co-op is more than just having a
roof over their heads and having
to cook; it's a way of life and a
distinctive Stanford subculture.
That subculture is a valuable
part of the spectrum of Stanford
life and should be preserved.
