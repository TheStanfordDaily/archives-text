# Hope and good faith
## 
### 
Last week's court
proceedings offered some
hope that the Louis Jackson
case is close to being resolved.
The judge hearing the case
credited both sides with "good
faith" for their efforts to forge a
pre-trial resolution. . ..
Jackson's attorney expressed for
the first time on the record that
the case could be nearing its end.
And the same district attorney
who has been handling Jackson's
case appeared accomodating in the
case of another Agenda for Action
protester, Matt Price.
As a result of a closed-chambers
plea bargain, Price's charge was
amended and he received only six
months probation in addition to
the night he had already spent in
jail upon his arrest at the May 15
takeover of Building 10.

These are all good signs.
But any hope that Jackson's case
is drawing to a close is really just
that â€” hope. While all parties have
indicated that progress has been
made behind closed doors, little
progress has been made on the
record in court.
Jackson still faces six mis
demeanor charges, including in
citement to riot and battery, and
his attorney's efforts to have the
battery charge dropped have been
blocked and delayed.
Jackson returns to court Dec. 1
for another scheduled hearing on
his attorney's motion to drop the
battery charge. Hopefully, the
hearing will produce concrete
results indicative of the "good
faith" of both sides, bringing to a
close a matter which has dragged
on far too long already.
