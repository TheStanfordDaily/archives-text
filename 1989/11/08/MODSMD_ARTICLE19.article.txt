## Farm is 'zoo' for women 
### 
ONE OF THE professors in my
American Education and Public
Policy class said, "Women are like
animals in a zoo without bars." He was
relaying this quote in an effort to explain
the range of women's opportunities in
the United States.
He observed that while it may appear
women can freely roam through numer
ous opportunities, limits on their achieve
ments do exist and keep them from
transcending a certain boundary.
My professor used this analogy to ex
plain women's career opportunities, but
I think it also accurately describes the
situation for women on campus with the
recent cases of sexual harrassment.
On the surface, Stanford women seem
to enjoy a fairly liberated existence. But
recent occurrences prove that women's
lives on campus are not always so idyllic.
A woman jogging in the Foothills was
threatened by a man with a knife. An
other woman was accosted by a man who
exposed himself in a parking lot, and last
week a man entered the women's
restroom in Madera and peeked at a stu
dent while she was showering.
These events suggest that women are
not able to move freely about the Farm.
There are certain hours and certain areas
women should avoid if they are alone.
Stanford suddenly shrinks when women
have to plan how to get home from a
party or the library.
The campus doesn't seem quite as ex
pansive when women must find someone
to accompany them into the Foothills.
University residences aren't as homey
when women have to worry about strange

men entering their dorms.
Women who weren't the direct victims
of these attacks are still affected by them.
My friend was running in the Foothills
at noon a few days ago. She was alone
except for a bare-chested man loping
along in front of her. A woman jogger
appeared from the other direction. The
man in front of my friend stopped and
slowly watched as the woman ran by
him. He then saw my friend.
He continued walking and my friend
continued running, but every few feet or
so, the man would turn around and stare
at her. Finally he turned around, made
a strange face at my friend, and then
continued walking.
By this time, my friend was so nervous
that she started running the other way,
away from the man.
Was she being paranoid or smart to
run away? It almost doesn't matter if
the man was planning anything at all.
What is important was that the recent
sexual attacks made my friend restrict
her normal action. The zoo keeps getting
smaller.
What can be done to prevent these
incidents from occurring and make
women feel a little freer? Stanford United
for Rape Elimination's escort service,
which offers escorts home from Univer
sity libraries, is an excellent preventative
measure which allows women a little
more freedom in their nighttime travels.
But it is limited in both hours and
personnel and alone is not enough to
significantly reduce sexual crimes.
Programs like the Rape Education
Project and the SWOPSI course Self-

Defense for Women, sponsored by the
Women's Center, are also important and
effective ways for women to learn how
to protect themselves, but education is
not enough either.
There is an additional need for in
creased personal responsibility, not only
to avoid dangerous situations, but to be
more aware that the danger is there.
Men and women need to watch out for
suspicious people, and, if those people
enter a residence or interfere with some
one, to question the person or call for
someone to help.
The University also has a responsibilty
to insure the safety of its students and
staff by increasing security in dangerous
areas.
Perhaps University security officers
could spend more time patrolling the en
tire campus, especially those areas which
have been identified as high-risk. And
since the Foothills encompass an ex
tremely large area, more guards could be
added to the patrol there.
It may be naive to expect to completely
free women from the zoo of sexual har
rassment, but with the cooperation of
students and the University, perhaps it
could be enlarged.

one, to question the person or call for

The University also has a responsibilty
to insure the safety of its students and
staff by increasing security in dangerous
areas.
Perhaps University security officers
could spend more time patrolling the en

have been identified as high-risk. And
since the Foothills encompass an ex
tremely large area, more guards could be
added to the patrol there.
It may be naive to expect to completely
free women from the zoo of sexual har
rassment, but with the cooperation of
students and the University, perhaps it
could be enlarged.
