# Big Game bonfire may be held

### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
The 1989 Big Game bonfire, origi
nally canceled because of lack of funds,
could happen this year if the ASSU
Council of Presidents and the Stanford
Axe Committee can do some quick or
ganizing and fundraising by Nov. 16.
In a meeting yesterday with Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy, the COP
brought up the idea of reinstating the
bonfire this year. Kennedy expressed
support for the notion but said the final
decision on a bonfire would have to
come from Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
"If there is good planning, there are
no objections in principle on my part,"
Lyons said after being informed last
night by The Daily of the movement to
bring back the bonfire.
"My only concerns are ordinary ones
â€” is there enough time and resources
to do it," Lyons said. "Also, I'd have

to ask about where the money is going
to come from. The reason it was voted
down by the students in the first place
was because of money."
Axe Committee Chair Pat Broun said
a bonfire would cost about $12,000, of
which about $1,500 is insurance costs.
If the University self-insured the event,
Broun said it would be more feasible
than trying to find non-University in
surance for the event, which takes 10
working days.
"Unless the University is able to self
insure this event, we can't have it,"
Broun said.
But COP member David Brown
thinks it would still be possible to pur
chase one-day insurance, even at this
short notice. He said Kennedy had been
optimistic about the possibility of self
insurance.
Broun also said there was a possibility
of a $5000 donation from "a major cor
porate donor," which the Axe Commit
tee had found out about only a few days

ago.
According to Brown, ASSU senators
along with Axe Committee members will
canvass dorms tonight trying to raise
additional funds. Last fall, the money
came from the Axe Committee's special
fee assessment, which was voted down
last spring.
Axe Committee Associate Chair Tim
Sullivan was somewhat skeptical of the
possibility of a organizing a bonfire in
such a short time.
"It's an enormous logistical thing to
get together," Sullivan said. "Usually it
takes us two months [to plan]; now
we're doing it in nine days."
Safety is a big concern and potential
logjam in planning the traditional pre
game fire. A few students have been
injured in the past, Lyons said.
Still, Brown expressed optimism
about the bonfire, which would take
place the night of Thursday, Nov. 16.
"It sounds like it's on to the extent that
we can get the money," he said.
