## Accusation of harassment based on racial stereotypes 
### 
I HAVE WORKED at Stanford for
six years. Although I have been
involved in many pressing issues, I
have never personally written to The
Daily until now.
Recently you have reported serious
criticisms of Tresidder Union. I feel it
is my responsibility to make known to
the community another deplorable act
of Tresidder management.
I am not a person who goes around
saying that everything happens to me
because I am black. On the other hand
I am able to recognize a racially based
incident.

Despite eight witnesses to the con
trary, Tresidder managers have fabri
cated a story that while representing
workers, I "assaulted" (physically) a
white woman, that I "brushed" against
another woman and that I used the
word "bitch." Tresidder has joined the
practice of singling out and targeting
black people as has happened in the
Louis Jackson case.
No one can find anyone, anywhere
in the Stanford community, in the
labor community or in the civil and
human rights movement in which I am
active who has ever heard me make
reference to a woman as a "bitch."

I strongly object to this particular
false accusation because I know this
term to be part and parcel of the
long-term degradation of women. It
perpetuates male supremacy.
I not only refuse to use this term,
but as many chauvinistic people can
attest, I do not allow it to be used
around me.
As for the "assault," I feel Tresidder
would not have made this absurd
accusation if I were not black. If black
people in general were not portrayed as
violent, uncontrollabe and foul
mouthed, Tresidder managers them
selves would have felt their story to be

unbelievable to the public.
Over the years, I have talked with
other black people at Stanford who
have been subjected to the same treat
ment and who have been forced to
defend themselves.
I would like to appeal to the Stan
ford community to investigate this
issue seriously and fully. It will be easy
to see that Tresidder's story of what
happened is so full of contradictions,
physical impossibilities and im
probabilities that it is patently false.
