# Some racist epithets come from minority groups themselves
## 
### 
I think Cheryl Taylor misinterpreted
University President Donald Kennedy's
1989 welcome speech in her column
Monday.
I believe Kennedy was advising stu
dents to get a feel for the campus and
its social and political climate before
they get involved in any activities,
including students of color organiza
tions.
Taylor believes Kennedy's emphasis
on watching out for "correct politics"
means that now his arm is being
twisted by the campus' vocal right
wingers.
While it is true that right-wing ele
ments have continued to allow "racist
and sexist epithets," as Taylor sug
gests, it is also true that these ideas
sometimes emanate from one's immedi
ate community.
An example of this occurred at this
year's "The Fire Within."
MEChA, which claims to represent

the entire Chicano community
(although the 1989 "Final Report of
the University Committee on Minority
Issues" shows that only 15 percent of
Chicanos have ever been members of
or been involved in any MEChA
sponsored event), showed a tasteless
and insensitive film clip that was sup
posed to promote their motto, "Soy
Chicano because I'm brown and I'm
proud. .
The clip had several stereotypical
"Chicanos" chugging beers and singing
while another bunch of equally stereo
typical characters engaged in a brutal
and bloody cockfight.
With all the demonstrations and
concern over animal rights at Stanford,
MEChA exhibited a film that offended
the entire Memorial Auditorium crowd
of new Stanford students. If everyone
was hissing, then who were they repre
senting?
As the freshman and transfer stu
dents hissed, I had to sink into my
chair, wondering how long it would
take before new students forgot the
picture of Chicanos who have pot
bellies, drink beer and make sport out
of the mutilitation of animals.
Thus, I would like to join Kennedy
in asking freshman, transfers and all

students to question the actions of
particular political organizations.
And, I would like go beyond his mes
sage and ask you to think before you
decide to claim to represent someone
you know little or nothing about.
