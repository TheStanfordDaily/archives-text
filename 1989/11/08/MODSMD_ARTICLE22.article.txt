# Student's willingness to get involved helps stop a bicycle theft
## 
### 
On Nov. 1, I was the victim of a
bicycle theft. Fortunately, the theft was
thwarted by the actions of an alert
and concerned graduate student.
Larry Smith, a graduate student in
environmental engineering, was riding
his bike along Panama Street behind
Roble Gym when he saw the thief
walking with my locked bike, which I
had left parked behind the gym.
Instead of simply going about his
business, Larry decided to fellow this
person and quickly realized this was
not someone who had forgotten the
key to his bike lock â€” he was indeed

a bike thief.
Larry then slipped into the gym and
called the Stanford Police, who quickly
arrived to catch the thief trying to cut
the U-lock with a pair of bolt cutters.
Because I had my bike registered,
the police were able to notify me that
evening that they had recovered my
bike.
Most of us here at Stanford are very
busy, and we often get so caught up in
our own affairs that we either don't
notice situations such as this or we
don't take action. It is too easy to say,
"I don't have time for this" or "I don't
want to get involved."
I would like to thank Larry Smith
for taking both the time and the risk
to get involved. I'm sure he had better
things to do.
I would also like to thank the Stan
ford Police for doing its job so well
and getting my bike back to me in
such a timely manner.
For those of you who, like me, love
and depend on your bike, register it (it
proves that you own it, not the thief)
and lock it to something.
