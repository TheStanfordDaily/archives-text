9,, Someone told me that
• urinating in a sink is
for the plumbing be
cause the pipes are different
from a toilet's and could cor
rode. I, however, think it
might help clear minor
blockages. Which ?
A. After last week's
• column on beverages,
this seemed as appropriate
a time to answer this ques
tion as any.
First I called up Bob Dun
lap who works for Opera
tions and Maintenance and
asked him about the differ
ence between sink pipes and
toilet pipes. He said that, at
least at Stanford, both are
made out of cast iron but
that sink pipes are coated
on the outside with chrome.
"It looks better and it's
easier to clean," Dunlap ex
plained. The chrome plating
does not, however, make the
inside of the the pipes any
more likely to corrode.
In order to more com
pletely answer the question,
I next took on the unenvi-

able job of investigating the
chemical contents of urine.
According to a doctor at the
Medical Center Urology Clinic,
whose name was withheld to
lessen the embarassment factor,
human urine is about 95 percent
water. The rest is dissolved salts,
like sodium and chloride, and
waste products including urea,
uric acid and ammonia. (That
does not mean you should use
urine to clean your bathroom. The
ammonia is very, very dilute).
The exact content of a person's
liquid excrement is "extremely
variable." It depends on what you
eat and drink, how much you
sweat, and if you are sick or
healthy. Usually urine is weakly
acidic, with a pH near 6.
Since this is 10 times as acidic
as pure distilled water, I initially
wondered if this might have some
slight corroding or cleansing ef
fect on both toilet and sink pipes.
That was until I learned that plain
old tap water is even more acidic.
The Encyclopedia Britannica, that
fountain of wisdom known to
elementary school pupils every

where, says that tap water has a
pH of 5.8. So much for using urine
to clean your drains.
If you think about it (and
maybe you'd rather not), that's
kind of a good thing. You wouldn't
want anything that ate holes in
solid metal to flow regularly
through your internal plumbing.
So, to conclude, as far as your
bathroom pipes are concerned, it
doesn't really matter if you pee
in the sink. There are lots of other
reasons why you might want to
choose a toilet, but they have more
to do with hygiene and conven
ience than with chemistry.
Had news for owls
For those of you who have been
staying awake nights pondering
the health effects of massive caf
feine ingestion as discussed in last
week's column, Jennifer Gates of
Health and Safety Department
sent in several more reasons not
to enter espresso drinking con
tests.
She looked up caffeine on her
"handy-dandy chemical data
base," and discovered that, for a
person weighing 125 pounds, dan
gerous effects begin at about 600
mg of caffeine — that's about six
small cups of medium-strength

coffee or six No Doz caffeine pills.
At this dosage, "the handy
dandy chemical data base" said,
the person could begin to have
the following symptoms: sleep
lessness (well, that's usually the
point, but some of these other
effects might distract you from
your studies), anxiety, aggression,
tremors, spasticity, ringing in the
ears, gastric disturbances, rapid
heartbeat and elevated blood pres
sure.
And the bad news continues.
"Increasing amounts . . . could
lead to convulsions and hallucina
tions. . . . Somewhere around
9,000 mg could kill you."
Now 9,000 mg of is a lot of
coffee, about 90 cups — or 50 if
the coffee is really strong. That's
more than my caffeine-addicted
freshman roommate drank in a
month. While caffeine poisoning
isn't a leading cause of death, even
at Stanford, it has happened, so
"think before you drink."
