# Now that the Voyager is done, the work begins

It has been nearly two months
since Voyager II whizzed by Nep
tune, sending back to Earth ex
citing images and striking awe
into millions of armchair viewers
nationwide. Yet for the group of
scientists from Stanford and the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
volved in the radio science exper
iment at Neptune, most of the
hard work and excitement is yet
to come.
Led by Leonard Tyler, professor
of electrical engineering, the radio
science team is working around
the clock, and will be for years to
come, to reduce the data from
their experiment in order to shed
more light on this mysterious area
of our solar system.
The radio science experiment,
which was one of 11 experiments
performed during Voyager ll's en
counter with Neptune, was
unique in a couple of ways.
The other experiments had all
of their instruments on board the
space craft, whereas some of the
radio science experiment's most
essential instruments, namely the
radio receivers, were located here
on Earth, some billions of miles
away.
With the other experiments,
most of the scientists' work took
place before the encounter with
Neptune, and after that it was
just a matter of waiting for the
new and exciting information to
be beamed back to Earth. Not so
for members of the radio science
team: Their most complex and in
depth analysis is taking place now
that the experiment itself has
ended.
The technique used in the radio
science experiment is called radio
occultation. Invented by Electrical
Engineering Prof. Von Eshelman,
the technique has been used many
times since the Mariner expedi
tions as a good method of explor
ing objects in space.
In order to perform a radio oc
cultation at planet Neptune, the
Voyager spacecraft had to make
a high-risk trajectory. From our
perspective on Earth, the craft

approached Neptune at an up
ward angle, skimmed the top of
the planet at distance of 3,000
miles, at which time the speed of
the craft was 61,000 mph, and
finally circled downward behind
the planet.
During all of this, transmitters
aboard the craft were sending out
radio waves directed to arrive at
receiving stations on the Earth.
Whenever the craft passed behind
any medium, such as clouds or
rings, the radio beam was
refracted and spread out, making
the signal arriving at Earth
weaker. By measuring the changes
in the signal and analyzing them
from its three tracking stations
on Earth, the radio science team
is able to extract key information
about Neptune itself.
Voyager radio signals reaching
these tracking stations are so
weak that digital watches use
about 20 billion times that power.
For the antennas at the tracking
stations to receive such a weak
signal, they had to be incredibly
sensitive.
In addition, the frequency of
the signals needed to be stable to
a very high degree. In order to
yield more accurate calculations
during signal analysis, signals re
corded at the different stations
were matched up and combined
according to the precise time they
reached the Earth.
The amount of data resulting
from the radio science experiment
is mindblowing. During the
several morning hours of Aug. 24
that Voyager transmitted the
radio signals to Earth, the track
ing stations were recording signal
frequency, strength and phase
some 50,000 times per second.
Reduction of the approximately
25 billion bits of data recieved
from the Neptune flyby has been

taking place around the clock for
weeks. Reductions are done by
radio science team members as
sisted by very fast computers.
Very little of the information
has been analyzed, but important
results have already surfaced.
Neptune's mass and the pres
sure and temperature of the cold
planet's atmosphere as they vary
at different altitudes have been
determined.
Before Voyager 11, practically
nothing was known about Nep
tune's largest moon, Triton. The
Triton radio science experiment,
performed similarly to how it was
performed at Neptune, has al
ready resulted in several impor
tant discoveries.
Triton has an atmosphere of
nitrogen gas about 100,000 times
thinner than Earth's but very
large compared to other satellites'
atmospheres. It is also now known
to have a fairly extended iono
sphere of singly ionized nitrogen
molecules; this had not been
known previous to Voyager. The
surface of Triton, at 32 degrees
Kelvin, is colder than that of any
other world in the solar system.

But, these impressive findings
are just the tip of the iceberg.
Most of the information coming
out of the radio science experi
ment will be revealed during the
next few years of analysis. Some
of the findings scientists are an
ticipating include a more accurate
ratio of hydrogen to helium in
Neptune's atmoshere, more accu
rate temperature and pressure
profiles and altitudes of the
planet's cloud layers.
If it turns out that the radio
signal was cut off at least partly
by ammonia absorption, then the
amount of ammonia in Nepune's
atmosphere can be determined.
Voyager's imaging team detected
six or seven tenuous and sparsely
distributed rings around Neptune
as well as the varying concentra
tions of the particles which com
prise them.
To say that the radio science
experiment performed at Neptune
is proving itself to be a success
is certainly an understatement.
The results are even surpassing
the expectations of the radio sci
ence team.
Before the experiment took

place, tests showed that compli
cations might occur during the
actual experiment. As it turns out,
the experiment was performed to
near perfection. Out of the 25
billion bits of data reaching the
Earth, only a few bits, at the most,
were lost, researchers say.
In light of all this success, Tyler
and his colleagues say they are
working on ways to make future
radio science experiments even
better. The technique of radio oc
culation has been greatly
improved since Mariner through
the use of better transmitters and
receivers, but according to Tyler,
some more obvious improvements
can be made.
To strengthen the radio signal
from the spacecraft, Tyler says he
would like to take advantage of
the much more powerful signals
that can be produced from Earth.
The data analysis would take
place on the spacecraft. To turn
this idea into a boon for research
ers, scientists need to build a com
puter light enough to travel on
board a spacecraft and still fast
enough to perform the complex
data analysis.
