# Snacking is as important as eating meals
## 
### Sue Biggins 
The life of a Stanford student
involves lots of eating.
Many freshmen wonder how
they gain 15 pounds in a quarter.
When you take a close look at all
those "little" snacks, though, it is
easy to understand.
Snacks — whether pretzels,
popcorn, chocolate, ice cream or
granola — are just as important
as meals. We'll take a look at a
few and see what makes a good
snack and what makes a bad one.
Frozen yogurt, dubbed fro yo by
Stanford students, is a popular
snack. Fro yo is generally a good
choice since the fat content is
usually very low or zero. It also
has a good supply of calcium.
The only bad thing about fro
yo is the number of "empty"
calories it contains. Empty
calories are calories with few
vitamins or minerals. Overall
though, it is hard to find a snack
that so many people enjoy that is
not loaded with fat.
Fro yo toppings are another

story, though. Unfortunately,
gobs of chocolate bars or sauce
thrown on top of fro yo negates
its health benefits.
Some toppings are not as obvi
ously unhealthy, though. Carob is
a popular topping because it is
considered the "healthy" substi
tute for chocolate. In reality, carob
is not that great for you. In fact,
most carob products that taste
like chocolate are usually higher
in fat and caloriee than chocolate.
Carob flour by itself is very
healthy and lowfat. The problem
is that lots of fat, usually
saturated and partially hydro
genated, is added to make the
flour resemble chocolate. The net

result is a food that has more fat
than most chocolate ever had to
begin with and does not even taste
as good.
Granola is another one of those
"healthy" foods. Unfortunately,
granola also has lots of fat and
calories. This is another situation
where you might as well eat what
you really crave than bother with
the granola.
Another popular study break
food at Stanford is nachos. Since
nachos are already loaded with fat,
it is best not to throw more on
if you eat these. For example, add
ing guacamole, sour cream and
cheese to your nachos just means
you are adding tablespoons of
grease. Salsa is a great alternative
because it has no fat and few
calories.
Crackers and cheese are also
popular, and many people think
it is just the cheese that is fatty.
Sdme crackers are very low in fat
and high in fiber, but these are
usually not the popular ones. Ritz
crackers, Triscuits, Wheat Thins,
etc. are all high in salt and fat.

Look carefully at the amount of
fat before indulging.
And then there is popcorn. Air
popped popcorn without lots of
butter and salt is a great snack.
It is low in calories and high in
fiber as long as you do not pile
the butter and salt on.
The latest craze in popcorn is
microwave popcorn. In theory,
this is great stuff. In reality, it
has tons of preservatives and fat.
It is interesting to note that many
of the "natural" flavors have more
fat than the "butter" flavors. This
should tell you something about
the wonders of manufacturing.
When you snack, think a little
about how much fat, sugar and
salt you might be taking in. Mod
ifying your snacks will help you
avoid gaining weight and losing
energy.
Snacks count as much as meals,
and many times they have more
calories than a whole meal. Re
member: A calorie is still a calorie,
regardless of what time you eat
it, where you eat it and whether
you use utensils.
