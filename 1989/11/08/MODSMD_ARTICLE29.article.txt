Doctors go high-tech
Doctors have joined other
computer hounds on campus
now that they have modem
access to the Stanford Hospital's
patient and test results infor
mation from their offices or
homes.
The new service will replace
the old method of obtaining in
formation in person at the
hospital or by phoning hospital
departments. The hopital has
named this service, which is
bound to be the best buddy of
many doctors, PAL, for
Physician Access Link.
PAL currently provides details
on patient location, demographic
and insurance information and
results of laboratory and radiol
ogy tests. Using an office or
home computer and a modem,
authorized personnel can dis
play important patient informa
tion on the computer and have

it printed if they wish.
Some new features that may
be added include the ability to
preregister patients from a doc
tor's office; additional test result
information, such as that from
microbiology and surgical pa
thology laboratories; and diet or
medication instructions for
patients.
The handy item is not ex
pected to cost too much to im
plement because computers are
commonly used throughout the
hospital. A common cost will be
that for installation of a modem
at the doctor's home. "If equip
ment is needed, both faculty and
voluntary clinical faculty qualify
for [hospital] discounts from
IBM, Hewlett Packard and Ap
ple," said program manager
Linda Heidel.
Heidel estimated that about
75 offices will be using the link
in the next six months. She said
others should start using the
technology soon after that.
