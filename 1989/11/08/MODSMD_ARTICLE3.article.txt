# Tresidder layoffs still unsettled
## One custodial worker retained while two others await decision 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
For over a month, Clyde Cookson's
future hung in the balance as the United
Stanford Workers and Tresidder man
agement feuded over the layoffs of three
workers.
Although Tresidder management yes
terday backed down and settled in Cook
son's favor, the fates of several custodial
workers still remain unclear in the af
termath of the decision last month to
eliminate three workers in response to
a $210,000 deficit.
Prior to yesterday's decision, Cookson
had been one of the workers whose job
as a custodian at Tresidder Union was
in question. Cookson had three difficult
choices in front of him: retire, transfer
to another University job or risk being
laid off.
The obvious choice for Cookson would
be to retire. Now 73, Cookson can look
back on 27 years of service as a cus

todian at Tresidder. He had, in fact,
planned to retire on June 11 of next
year, exactly 28 years after he began
working at Tresidder in 1962.
Tresidder management even went so
far as to offer Cookson a one-time pay
ment of $23,000 as an incentive for him
to retire this year, he said.
But Cookson says he cannot be
bought. Because of the pressure on him
to retire, he is now determined to stay
on to see his 30th anniversary here.
Cookson realized, however, that he
faced quite a struggle. Originally, if
Cookson were to stay on at Tresidder,
he would have been forced to accept the
graveyard hours for his new shift, from
11:30 at night until 8:00 in the morning.
However, the change to the night shift
would be impossible for Cookson. Cook
son's wife, who suffers from bad hips
and knees, needs constant supervision.
While Cookson works as a custodian
at Tresidder, his sister-in-law looks after
his wife. He would be forced to hire

someone to take care of his wife if he
were placed on the night shift, a luxury
he cannot afford.
Cookson is one of the more fortunate
custodians at Tresidder. After a 10-
minute meeting yesterday afternoon be
tween Cookson, USW Steward Linda
Crouse and Tresidder Director Bobbi
Braden, management backed down from
its original position.
Beginning today, Tresidder manage
ment will allow Cookson to return to
his original shift, starting at 5 a.m.
Tuesday through Saturday.
Tresidder management "is beginning
to feel the pressure" from the increased
attention to the layoffs, Cookson said.
The cases of two other custodians,
however, have yet to be decided by Tres
idder management.
Juggling classes and jobs
Refugio Flores, who has worked at
Tresidder for eight years, has his
position virtually guaranteed. Al
though he has worked the after
noon "swing shift" for several
years, management had originally
wanted Flores to accept the
graveyard shift, Flores said.
Flores spends his morning
hours going to school at the Bur
lingame Regional Occupational
Program, training to become an
auto mechanic. In addition, he
studies with Stanford English
Prof. Albert Guerard through the
Stanford Literacy Project.
Under the original Tresidder
proposal, Flores would have had
to work until 8 a.m. and then go
directly to class. But after work
ing a full shift, Flores said he
would be unable to find the energy
to continue his morning classes.
Tresidder returned with a sec
ond proposal that would keep him
on his current shift, but would
force him to work weekends.
This would mean that Flores
would have to quit his weekend
job at a Menlo Park restaurant
where he works about 15 hours
a week. Having recently purchased
a home, Flores needs both jobs to
make ends meet.
Flores had a meeting yesterday
with Braden and Tresidder build
ing manager Jeanette Smith-
Laws. A decision is expected today.
Old Jos& 87 and still at work
The case of Jos6 Oropeza also
has yet to be addressed by Tres
idder management. Oropeza, "Old
Jos6" to his fellow workers, has
worked at Tresidder as a
groundskeeper for 24 years.
Before coming to Stanford,
Oropeza worked as a detonator in
Arizona copper mines and as a
longshoreman in San Francisco.
But at 87, Oropeza still is far

from retirement.
Oropeza would receive a pen
sion of only $38 a month from
Tresidder if he were to retire, his
daughter said. Oropeza says he
cannot live on such a small
amount.
Even at his age, Oropeza can
still do the work. When he is sick,
Tresidder must bring in "a crew
of four men" from the University
groundskeeping department to
replace him, according to Crouse
of the USW.
But Tresidder Associate Direc
tor Paul Szczesiul has a different
opinion. "He can't possibly do the
whole job," he said.
"I bet you Jos6 can work rings"
around Szczesiul, Cookson
retorted later.
Oropeza was also offered the
position of custodian. Though he
would not receive a pay cut, it
still represents a demotion. Also,
his custodial duties would be on
the graveyard shift.
Oropeza commutes daily from
San Jose with his daughter. The
change to a graveyard shift would
conflict with his daughter's
schedule. Since Oropeza cannot
drive, he would have no way of
getting to work.
Oropeza's fellow workers are
also worried about the effects that
the night shift would have on the
87-year-old man. "Only certain
people can take the physical de
mands of the graveyard shift,"
said Crouse. The cold night air
and the late hours could endanger
Oropeza's health.
Responding to Oropeza's special
situation, a final decision from
management has been postponed
until Dec. 1. "There will always
have to be some sacrifices," said
Szczesiul in response to Oropeza's
case.
Deficits and understaffing
So far, three Tresidder cus
todians have agreed to accept a
transfer to another position, but

one of the transfers was canceled
because Tresidder was under
staffed.
One of those, Harry Herrera,
had worked for 10 years as a Tres
idder custodian until beginning
his new job as a project custodian
at the Row Houses last Thursday.
The job of project custodian is
a small step up from his former
custodial position, with an in
crease in pay, but it is not the
money that the workers care most
about.
Herrera volunteered to accept
the transfer in order to save
Flores from being laid off or trans
ferred, Herrera said. In terms of
seniority, Flores would be the next
to go if another worker was re
leased.
Jesus Godinez, who has only
one-and-a-half years of work ex
perience at Tresidder, has been
forcibly transferred to Wilbur
Hall.
A third custodian, Paul Ortega,
had accepted a transfer to Wilbur.
Before Ortega reported to Wilbur,
however, his transfer was can
celed because Tresidder was too
shorthanded, Ortega said.
Meanwhile, the custodial work
at Tresidder is continually being
done by fewer people. Head cus
todian Henry Battle remembers
that when he started his job 24
years ago 27 men used to do the
job that the current crew of eight
is doing.
"There's no way we can get this
done," Battle said, pointing
around to the garbage that had
accumulated in Tresidder during
the day. "This place is filthy," Or
tega said.
Crouse, whose job usually en
tails setting up furniture, must
now take on an extra burden of
custodial work because of the staff
cuts. "I can't do it all," she insists.
"I refuse to become a drudge."
"It's time for someone to look
down, because I'm tired of looking
up," Battle said.

celed because Tresidder was too
shorthanded, Ortega said.
Meanwhile, the custodial work
at Tresidder is continually being
done by fewer people. Head cus
todian Henry Battle remembers
that when he started his job 24
years ago 27 men used to do the
job that the current crew of eight
is doing.
"There's no way we can get this
done," Battle said, pointing
around to the garbage that had
accumulated in Tresidder during
the day. "This place is filthy," Or
tega said.
Crouse, whose job usually en
tails setting up furniture, must
now take on an extra burden of
custodial work because of the staff
cuts. "I can't do it all," she insists.
"I refuse to become a drudge."
"It's time for someone to look
down, because I'm tired of looking
up," Battle said.
For over a month, Clyde Cookson's
future hung in the balance as the United
Stanford Workers and Tresidder man
agement feuded over the layoffs of three
workers.
Although Tresidder management yes
terday backed down and settled in Cook
son's favor, the fates of several custodial
workers still remain unclear in the af
termath of the decision last month to
eliminate three workers in response to
a $210,000 deficit.
Prior to yesterday's decision, Cookson
had been one of the workers whose job
as a custodian at Tresidder Union was
in question. Cookson had three difficult
choices in front of him: retire, transfer
to another University job or risk being
laid off.
The obvious choice for Cookson would
be to retire. Now 73, Cookson can look
back on 27 years of service as a cus

todian at Tresidder. He had, in fact,
planned to retire on June 11 of next
year, exactly 28 years after he began
working at Tresidder in 1962.
Tresidder management even went so
far as to offer Cookson a one-time pay
ment of $23,000 as an incentive for him
to retire this year, he said.
But Cookson says he cannot be
bought. Because of the pressure on him
to retire, he is now determined to stay
on to see his 30th anniversary here.
Cookson realized, however, that he
faced quite a struggle. Originally, if
Cookson were to stay on at Tresidder,
he would have been forced to accept the
graveyard hours for his new shift, from
11:30 at night until 8:00 in the morning.
However, the change to the night shift
would be impossible for Cookson. Cook
son's wife, who suffers from bad hips
and knees, needs constant supervision.
While Cookson works as a custodian
at Tresidder, his sister-in-law looks after
his wife. He would be forced to hire

someone to take care of his wife if he
were placed on the night shift, a luxury
he cannot afford.
Cookson is one of the more fortunate
custodians at Tresidder. After a 10-
minute meeting yesterday afternoon be
tween Cookson, USW Steward Linda
Crouse and Tresidder Director Bobbi
Braden, management backed down from
its original position.
Beginning today, Tresidder manage
ment will allow Cookson to return to
his original shift, starting at 5 a.m.
Tuesday through Saturday.
Tresidder management "is beginning
to feel the pressure" from the increased
attention to the layoffs, Cookson said.
The cases of two other custodians,
however, have yet to be decided by Tres
idder management.
Juggling classes and jobs
Refugio Flores, who has worked at
Tresidder for eight years, has his
position virtually guaranteed. Al
though he has worked the after
noon "swing shift" for several
years, management had originally
wanted Flores to accept the
graveyard shift, Flores said.
Flores spends his morning
hours going to school at the Bur
lingame Regional Occupational
Program, training to become an
auto mechanic. In addition, he
studies with Stanford English
Prof. Albert Guerard through the
Stanford Literacy Project.
Under the original Tresidder
proposal, Flores would have had
to work until 8 a.m. and then go
directly to class. But after work
ing a full shift, Flores said he
would be unable to find the energy
to continue his morning classes.
Tresidder returned with a sec
ond proposal that would keep him
on his current shift, but would
force him to work weekends.
This would mean that Flores
would have to quit his weekend
job at a Menlo Park restaurant
where he works about 15 hours
a week. Having recently purchased
a home, Flores needs both jobs to
make ends meet.
Flores had a meeting yesterday
with Braden and Tresidder build
ing manager Jeanette Smith-
Laws. A decision is expected today.
Old Jos& 87 and still at work
The case of Jos6 Oropeza also
has yet to be addressed by Tres
idder management. Oropeza, "Old
Jos6" to his fellow workers, has
worked at Tresidder as a
groundskeeper for 24 years.
Before coming to Stanford,
Oropeza worked as a detonator in
Arizona copper mines and as a
longshoreman in San Francisco.
But at 87, Oropeza still is far

from retirement.
Oropeza would receive a pen
sion of only $38 a month from
Tresidder if he were to retire, his
daughter said. Oropeza says he
cannot live on such a small
amount.
Even at his age, Oropeza can
still do the work. When he is sick,
Tresidder must bring in "a crew
of four men" from the University
groundskeeping department to
replace him, according to Crouse
of the USW.
But Tresidder Associate Direc
tor Paul Szczesiul has a different
opinion. "He can't possibly do the
whole job," he said.
"I bet you Jos6 can work rings"
around Szczesiul, Cookson
retorted later.
Oropeza was also offered the
position of custodian. Though he
would not receive a pay cut, it
still represents a demotion. Also,
his custodial duties would be on
the graveyard shift.
Oropeza commutes daily from
San Jose with his daughter. The
change to a graveyard shift would
conflict with his daughter's
schedule. Since Oropeza cannot
drive, he would have no way of
getting to work.
Oropeza's fellow workers are
also worried about the effects that
the night shift would have on the
87-year-old man. "Only certain
people can take the physical de
mands of the graveyard shift,"
said Crouse. The cold night air
and the late hours could endanger
Oropeza's health.
Responding to Oropeza's special
situation, a final decision from
management has been postponed
until Dec. 1. "There will always
have to be some sacrifices," said
Szczesiul in response to Oropeza's
case.
Deficits and understaffing
So far, three Tresidder cus
todians have agreed to accept a
transfer to another position, but

one of the transfers was canceled
because Tresidder was under
staffed.
One of those, Harry Herrera,
had worked for 10 years as a Tres
idder custodian until beginning
his new job as a project custodian
at the Row Houses last Thursday.
The job of project custodian is
a small step up from his former
custodial position, with an in
crease in pay, but it is not the
money that the workers care most
about.
Herrera volunteered to accept
the transfer in order to save
Flores from being laid off or trans
ferred, Herrera said. In terms of
seniority, Flores would be the next
to go if another worker was re
leased.
Jesus Godinez, who has only
one-and-a-half years of work ex
perience at Tresidder, has been
forcibly transferred to Wilbur
Hall.
A third custodian, Paul Ortega,
had accepted a transfer to Wilbur.
Before Ortega reported to Wilbur,
however, his transfer was can
celed because Tresidder was too
shorthanded, Ortega said.
Meanwhile, the custodial work

had worked for 10 years as a Tres
idder custodian until beginning
his new job as a project custodian
at the Row Houses last Thursday.
The job of project custodian is
a small step up from his former
custodial position, with an in
crease in pay, but it is not the
money that the workers care most
about.
Herrera volunteered to accept
the transfer in order to save
Flores from being laid off or trans
ferred, Herrera said. In terms of
seniority, Flores would be the next
to go if another worker was re
leased.
Jesus Godinez, who has only
one-and-a-half years of work ex
perience at Tresidder, has been
forcibly transferred to Wilbur
Hall.
A third custodian, Paul Ortega,
had accepted a transfer to Wilbur.
Before Ortega reported to Wilbur,
however, his transfer was can
celed because Tresidder was too
shorthanded, Ortega said.
Meanwhile, the custodial work
at Tresidder is continually being
done by fewer people. Head cus
todian Henry Battle remembers
that when he started his job 24
years ago 27 men used to do the
job that the current crew of eight
is doing.
"There's no way we can get this
done," Battle said, pointing
around to the garbage that had
accumulated in Tresidder during
the day. "This place is filthy," Or
tega said.
Crouse, whose job usually en
tails setting up furniture, must
now take on an extra burden of
custodial work because of the staff
cuts. "I can't do it all," she insists.
"I refuse to become a drudge."
"It's time for someone to look
down, because I'm tired of looking
up," Battle said.
