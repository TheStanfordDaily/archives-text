# Tresidder layoffs still unsettled
## One custodial worker retained while two others await decision 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
For over a month, Clyde Cookson's
future hung in the balance as the United
Stanford Workers and Tresidder man
agement feuded over the layoffs of three
workers.
Although Tresidder management yes
terday backed down and settled in Cook
son's favor, the fates of several custodial
workers still remain unclear in the af
termath of the decision last month to
eliminate three workers in response to
a $210,000 deficit.
Prior to yesterday's decision, Cookson
had been one of the workers whose job
as a custodian at Tresidder Union was
in question. Cookson had three difficult
choices in front of him: retire, transfer
to another University job or risk being
laid off.
The obvious choice for Cookson would
be to retire. Now 73, Cookson can look
back on 27 years of service as a cus

todian at Tresidder. He had, in fact,
planned to retire on June 11 of next
year, exactly 28 years after he began
working at Tresidder in 1962.
Tresidder management even went so
far as to offer Cookson a one-time pay
ment of $23,000 as an incentive for him
to retire this year, he said.
But Cookson says he cannot be
bought. Because of the pressure on him
to retire, he is now determined to stay
on to see his 30th anniversary here.
Cookson realized, however, that he
faced quite a struggle. Originally, if
Cookson were to stay on at Tresidder,
he would have been forced to accept the
graveyard hours for his new shift, from
11:30 at night until 8:00 in the morning.
However, the change to the night shift
would be impossible for Cookson. Cook
son's wife, who suffers from bad hips
and knees, needs constant supervision.
While Cookson works as a custodian
at Tresidder, his sister-in-law looks after
his wife. He would be forced to hire

someone to take care of his wife if he
were placed on the night shift, a luxury
he cannot afford.
Cookson is one of the more fortunate
custodians at Tresidder. After a 10-
minute meeting yesterday afternoon be
tween Cookson, USW Steward Linda
Crouse and Tresidder Director Bobbi
Braden, management backed down from
its original position.
Beginning today, Tresidder manage
ment will allow Cookson to return to
his original shift, starting at 5 a.m.
Tuesday through Saturday.
Tresidder management "is beginning
to feel the pressure" from the increased
attention to the layoffs, Cookson said.
The cases of two other custodians,
however, have yet to be decided by Tres
idder management.
