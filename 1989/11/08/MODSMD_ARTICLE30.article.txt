# Key leukemia gene discovered
## 
### Katherine Hemela 
A team of scientists at the
School of Medicine have discov
ered a gene associated with one
form of childhood leukemia that
may lead to better diagnosis of
the deadly disease.
Although the discovery has no
immediate implications for treat
ment, the finding has an impor
tant bearing on present methods
of diagnosis of acute lymphoblas
tic leukemias, which accounts for
5 to 6 percent of all pediatric
tumors, according to Julia Mel
lentin, a graduate student in the
Cancer Biology Program who
made the primary observations.
Presently, children who are sus
pected of having this specific form
of leukemia are diagnosed by
cytogenetic techniques — looking
at the chromosomes in blood sam
ples with microscopes. "Our find
ing will make it possible to detect
the [diseasel significantly more
accurately with special techniques
that look directly at DNA
molecules."
More than 30 percent of patients
diagnosed with the leukemia have

a gene like this has
been found specifi
cally to be altered.'

the same characteristic
chromosomal abnormality: Pieces
of DNA from chromosome 1 and
19 break off and reattach by
trading places, thus resulting in
this distinctive translocation. For
five years, researchers have been
studying this scrambling of ge
netic information, but, "This is
the first time a gene like this has
been found specifically to be al
tered," Mellentin stated.
Since earlier this year, Mellen
tin, Asst. Prof, of Pathology Mi
chael Cleary and cytogenesist
Timothy Donlon localized the
gene to the translocation break
point.
In January, Nobelist David Bal

timore and co-workers of the
Whitehead Institute for Biomedi
cal Research isolated a gene that
can be used as a DNA probe to
detect the specific shuffling of
genes.
The gene that Mellentin and col
leagues discovered at the break
points of chromosomes 1 and 19
produce atypical messenger RNA
molecules and protein products,
which recombine in a certain pat
tern that is present only in ab
normal cells. According to the
article in the Oct. 20 issue of the
journal Science, the discovery
might provide clues both to the
nature of disease and to interven
tion strategies.
"Future implications of our
findings will include allowing re
searchers to inhibit the protein
formed as a result of the trans
location and a potential for de
signing a therapy targeted
specifically at the cancer cells,"
Mellentin said. "The next step in
the experiment, however, is to dis
cover why the translocations oc
cur. It might be involved in other
tumors, including adult forms of
leukemia."
