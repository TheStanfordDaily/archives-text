## Pacific floods Stanford Spikers keep playoff hopes despite turbulent season 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
Not all hope is lost.
In spite of the Stanford wom
en's volleyball team's loss to the
University of the Pacific last night
at Old Pavilion, the Cardinal still
has some playoff hopes with five
conference matches remaining
this season.

The fifth-ranked Tigers, now
23-4, dominated an inconsistent
Stanford team, winning in four
games, 15-11, 15-10, 13-15, 15-10.
But the loss doesn't count on
Stanford's Pacific 10 Conference
record and the Cardinal remains
in second place with a 9-4 con
ference mark. Stanford will likely
receive an NCAA tournament bid
due to its strong conference
record.
Nonetheless, the No. 6 Cardinal
hoped last night's match would
prove that the team is ready to
challenge the country's best
teams. Although Stanford dis
played flashes of brilliant play, the
team was plagued by mental
lapses and a lack of experience.
"We're going to battle against
ourselves because we are young
(and) we've got a relatively new
lineup that's only been in there
together for a few matches," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said. "We're
getting better. . . and we just need
to hang in there and keep believ
ing that we can get better."
"It might not be evident to
everyone else, but as a team we
know that the things we've been
working on, we're getting better
at," sophomore outside hitter
Kristin Klein said. "We were
making some good plays and we
just need to work on trying to
maintain that throughout the
match rather than being so
sporadic.

"When we come up against
tougher teams, sometimes it's a
little bit harder to maintain that
concentration the whole time,"
Kiein said.
Stanford looked inconsistent
when the Tigers raced out to an
8-1 lead in the fourth game after
Stanford had won the third game.
Shaw called a timeout to rally the
team and the Cardinal responded,
pulling to within three points of
Pacific at 10-7. Stanford appeared
ready for a comeback.
After trading side outs, Stan
ford played the ball to Pacific's
Elaina Oden, who appeared to
cradle the ball in her arms. Ref
eree Max Kernaghan, however,
did not call the infraction and
Pacific went on to win the side
out.
Shaw, who had been question
ing Kernaghan's calls all night,
then exploded and was shown the
red penalty card. Pacific was
awarded a point to go up 11-7.
From then on, Stanford could only
win three points and Pacific won
the match when Klein hit the ball
long at 14-10, Pacific.
"There was a build-up of no
calls," Shaw said. "I just felt like
we were getting the short end of
the deal. We made good plays
(that) caused ball handling errors
by them. It's frustrating. I should
have probably gotten a red card
sooner just to try to wake (the
referee) up."
Stanford, however, displayed its
potential in the third game by win
ning it after dropping the first
two games. Although the Cardinal
couldn't hold a 4-1 lead in game
two, Stanford built an early 7-1
advantage in the third game.
The Tigers were able to battle
back to 10-5 and then 14-13, but
Stanford won important side outs
to stem the Pacific onslaught. At
14-13 and Stanford serving, Tiger
setter Melanie Beckenhauer
floated a ball that middle blocker
Elaina Oden hit wide across the
Stanford defense.

Stanford's 15-13 game-three
victory was not the night's only
highlight for the Cardinal. The
team tallied 93 total digs as fresh
men Bev Oden and Kristi Paaso
and senior Jessica Benton all re
corded career highs in digs. Paaso
also had a career-best 33 total
attacks and 13 kills on the night.
Benton lead the team in hitting
percentage at .375 with setter
Carrie Feldman close behind at
.364. Team captain Laura Olesen
also looked impressive while hit
ting .308.
In the battle of the Oden sisters,
Bev and Elaina compiled similar
statistics on the night. Bev hit
.324 with 13 digs and three block
assists, while Elaina hit .326, had
15 digs and 3 block assists with
a solo block for Pacific.
"This is the second time [we've
played against each otherl," Bev
Oden said after the match. (The
two faced each other Sept. 12 at
Stockton.) "The first time was
really strange. This time it was a
lot easier to see her as just a
player on the other side instead
of worrying about who she was."
Stanford will now return to the
remainder of its conference
schedule before closing the season
at top-ranked Hawaii Thanksgiv
ing weekend. The Cardinal will
travel to Arizona this weekend to
face Arizona State on Friday night
and then No. 10 Arizona on Sun
day afternoon.
Next week Stanford hosts 18th
ranked California on Tuesday and
then Washington and Washington
State on Friday and Sunday. The
Cardinal is just percentage points
in front of Washington for second
place in the Pac-10.
"Now is not the time for
anybody to hang it up and give
up," Shaw said after the match
last night. "I don't think anybody
on this team is going to do that.
We'll come out tomorrow and be
a better team because of what
happened tonight."

Sophomore hitter Kristin Klein couldn't supply enough firepower for Stanford to overcome the University
of Pacific last night in Old Pavilion. Klein and setter Carrie Feldman each had 18 digs, but the Tigers
romped in four sets.
