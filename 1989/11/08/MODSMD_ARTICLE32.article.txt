# Leader must emerge for rudderless spikers

In an ideal world, you could
read about how the Stanford
women's volleyball team
thrashed the University of the
Pacific last night and rees
tablished itself as one of the best
teams in the nation.
Unfortunately, we don't live in
an ideal world.
Back in reality, the Cardinal
lost its second straight match to
top-flight competition in Old Pa
vilion yesterday and appears un
likely to capture the national
crown it set it sights on late in
the summer.
There is no doubt the team has
risen from its nadir — a loss to
lowly San Jose State two weeks
ago. On the other hand, while
Stanford has recaptured the abil
ity to dominate lesser teams, the
squad has shown little to indicate
it can beat a UCLA or UOP.
One cannot help but wonder
why. The overall talent level,
buoyed by the play of freshmen
Bev Oden, Kristi Paaso and Carrie
Feldman, far exceeds that of last

year's club. Logic would dictate
the 1989 Cardinal would be even
better than the 1988 edition that
held the No. 2 ranking for much
of the season.
Part of the problem is that some
of the returnees have played far
below their ability. Jennifer Chaf
fee, who became unstoppable at
times in the past, now battles for
playing time. After making a
sensational splash as a freshman,
Amy Cooper seems to be lost in
a fog. Senior captain Laura
Olesen, who once provided

strength in the middle, sports a
dismal .163 hitting percentage for
the season.
The team is at a loss for
answers. Ail-American Kristin
Klein — probably the only Car
dinal player currently capable of
taking over a match — was unable
to offer a simple solution. "I used
to think it was our attitude,"
Klein said. "[Now] we have a lot
more positive attitude . . . (but)
things aren't going our way."
Said Coach Don Shaw: "It's
hard to put a finger on." Shaw
then took a long pause and
declined to comment for fear of
saying something he would regret.
Nevertheless, Shaw holds on to
a glimmer of hope. Asked if the
team can pull it together in time
to get a shot at the NCAA title,
Shaw replied, "If we keep working
hard, we can put ourselves in a
position to do just that.
"Then it becomes a gut check,"
he continued. "The players are
going to have to prove they can
do it."

For this trans
formation to occur,
someone is going
to have to step for
ward and prove to
the young team
that it is going to
win every match.

"It" is not simply staying on
the court with the nation's elite;
"it" is beating them. To reach the
Final Four, the Cardinal will have
to defeat the mighty Bruins in a
theoretical regional final show
down. Given the way UCLA man
handled Stanford last weekend,
that seems far from likely.
