# Cevaer places second
## Golfers fall one short at Gaucho Classic 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
The men's golf team came
within one stroke of capturing its
second consecutive team title yes
terday, as the Cardinal linksters
finished second at the UC-Santa
Barbara Invitational in Lompoc,
Calif.
Host Santa Barbara claimed the
team title with a three-round total
of 920, besting Stanford by a
single shot.
The Cardinal entered the final
day of competition in third place,
eight shots behind Santa Barbara
and U.S. International. Despite
carding yesterday's low round of
305, the squad could not overcome
the Gauchos' initial lead.

Coach Wally Goodwin was
"extremely pleased" with his
team's late round surge. He em
phasized the difficulty the team
encountered by beginning the
final round in third place.
"It's awfully hard to pass two
teams in 18 holes. Our players
really gave it their all, but we just
came up short," Goodwin said.
The Cardinal's quest for back
to-back wins was led by sopho
more Christian Cevaer, who
placed second individually.
Suffering a fate analogous to
that of the entire squad, Cevaer
came agonizingly close to victory.
His 224 was only two shots off
the pace set by John Damon of
Oregon State.
Both the individual and team

championships were decided in a
dramatic conclusion to the 54-hole
event.
Playing in the final group of
the day, Cevaer approached the
par four 18th hole of the La
Purisima links tied for the lead.
Disaster struck as Cevaer's sec
ond shot found a lateral water
hazard. After a one shot penalty
was assessed, he knocked his ap
proach shot within 10 feet of the
cup.
Cevaer missed his putt and
carded a double-bogey six. The
two strokes over par proved to be
the margin of victory for both
tournament titles.
The drive for the team title was
enhanced by the play of senior
Don Christiansen, who continued

his fine season with a three round
total of 229.
Christiansen's final round 73
launched him into a share of sixth
place individually.
Goodwin was especially proud
of senior Chris Barbour. Despite
his three day total of 237, Good
win found solace in Barbour's de
termination.
"Chris practices so diligently
and tries so hard for this team,
it was great having him contribute
in this tournament," Goodwin
said.
The Cardinal will now focus on
preparations for its grueling
Thanksgiving week odyssey, in
which the team will play at events
in Palm Springs and Texas.
