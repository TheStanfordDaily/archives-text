## 
### Rob Johnstone Staff writer 
High-octane intramural foot
ball action exploded Sunday as
teams battled for the playoffs,
which begin Wednesday, Nov.
15.
Playoff contenders Sigma Nu
and Oh Larry squared off Sun
day in a classic undergraduate
graduate B league game as
Sigma Nu overcame a 12-7
halftime deficit to crush Oh
Larry 32-12.
Sigma Nu, showing no signs
of sluggishness from Satur
day's Safari party, jumped out
to a 7-0 lead on a 25-yard
touchdown pass from quarter
back John Hafer to wide
receiver Jason Moore. Oh
Larry came back strong with
a six-yard touchdown run by
Brian Wladkouski to cut the
Sigma Nu lead to 7-6.
But Oh Larry went back in
front on a beautiful 75-yard
touchdown pass from Bruce
Arndsten to Mike Kestri for a
12-7 lead.
Sigma Nu seemed to respond
well to some key halftime ad
justments from coach and Car
dinal defensive back Tuan Van
Le. Sigma Nu quickly erased
the Oh Larry lead, exploding
for two touchdowns within the
first 37 seconds of the second
half.
Sean Greenley, who amassed
over 200 yards in pass recep
tions, broke open deep and
caught a 65-yard pass from
Hafer for a Sigma Nu touch
down, giving them a 14-12 lead.
On the next play from scrim
mage, Bruce Elvin intercepted
an errant Oh Larry pass and
returned it 40 yards for an
other Sigma Nu touchdown to
make the score 20-12.
Two late touchdowns in
creased the final margin to 32-
12.
"We did this for all of our
buddies, but it was Tuan Le's
influence that was key," said
Dan Brown, who had three of
Sigma Nu's six interceptions.
In a battle of structurally
sound row houses, Slavianskii
Dom edged 558 Mayfield 13-6
Sunday in coed football.
Slavianskii Dom jumped out to
a 13-0 halftime lead and relied
on some tough second-half de
fense to hold on for the win.
The Slav Dom offense,
relying mainly on quarterback

Mike Chui's scrambling, scored
early on Chui's 25-yard touch
down run to make it 6-0. Chui
then displayed his throwing
ability, passing one deep over
the middle to a streaking Dana
Meinke for a 60-yard touch
down.
558 Mayfield was held to
only one strong drive in the
second half, which resulted in
a 20-yard touchdown run by
quarterback Rich Ellinger. The

Slav Dom defense then held on
for the 13-6 victory.
Very rarely do designed run
ning plays work in the two
hand-touch world of intra
mural football, but the Theta
Delts used the planned runs to
perfection Sunday, overcoming
Sigma Chi in a tough A league
game, 18-20.
The Theta Delts and Sigma
Chi traded touchdowns early
in the first half and were tied
6-6 until late in the first half.
Sigma Chi's Scott Crahill
tossed a 30-yard touchdown
pass to John Arrilega with ten
seconds remaining in the first
half for a 12-6 Sigma Chi
halftime lead.
Mike Stehr of the Theta
Delts opened the second half
scoring with a 40-yard touch
down run on a quarterback
draw. Stehr took the snap,
dropped back two steps, and
ran through a hole opened by
the Theta Delt line that a large
pickup truck could have driven
through. Stehr scampered in
for the score and the Theta
Delts took a 13-12 lead.
Sigma Chi answered right
back with a strong drive,
capped by a 20-yard pass from
Crahill to Wes Ehlers, giving
Sigma Chi an 18-13 lead late
in the second half.
But the Theta Delts took the
ball and drove the length of
the field, finally scoring on a
six-yard pass from Stehr to Ken
James for the game-winning
touchdown. The key play in the
final drive was another crucial
quarterback draw.
