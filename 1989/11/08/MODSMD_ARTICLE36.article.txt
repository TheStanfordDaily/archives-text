# Stanford ruggers ramble to fifth in opener
## Cardinal wins three in Arizona

Rugby is elegant violence.
With as much elegance as they could
conjure and as much violence as their
bodies could endure, the Stanford men's
rugby club compiled a 3-1 record at the
15th annual Michelob-Continental Rugby
Classic last weekend in Tucson, Ariz.
Kicking off their 1989-90 season, the
ruggers placed fifth overall in a field of
16, surviving the two day rugby marathon.
Stanford continues its fall schedule next
Saturday, facing the University of San
Francisco at 1 p.m. in Golden Gate Park.
Long Beach State captured the Continen
tal Classic, downing host Arizona 18-14 in
the finals.
Pitted against a scrappy Colorado State
team Friday morning, the Cardinal ruggers
prevailed 13-12 to open the tournament
with a victory. Simon Fleming-Wood had
three kicks good for nine points, taking
advantage of several Ram mistakes.
The Arizona Wildcats, hungry to win at
home, subdued the Stanford squad 20-6
later Friday. The Wildcats led by four points
after the half, but forced some untimely
errors on Stanford, deflating any chances
for a Cardinal comeback.
After an inspiring oration by Coach
Franck Boivert, however, the ruggers pum
meled the unsuspecting Brigham Young
Cougars, 29-4, unleashing any frustrations
from earlier in the day. Russ Driver, Steve
Olson and Don "Snake" Conolly each
scored a try. Ed Stevens added two tries,
rounding out the Cardinal barrage.
A try in rugby is similar to scoring a
touchdown in football, but is worth four
points or six points if the conversion kick
is good.
On Saturday, Stanford defeated the hard
headed Arizona State Sun Devils, 11-4, in

what forward Chris Meyn called a "hitfest."
Glenn Flores and Blair JefTris each enjoyed
a try in that game,
Boivert said that for the "short amount
of time we practiced, the team played well,
but there is very much room for improve
ment, especially in our running game."
Playing in the highly competitive North
em California Rugby Union against teams
like California and Chico State, the Stan
ford team needs to concentrate on raising
the quality of its rugby to its highest pos
sible level, Boivert said.
Stanford reached the playoffs last year,
and a return trip in 1990 would be a re
alistic goal.
When speaking of goals, Boivert is quick
to point out that "the most important goal
of the season is to have a lot of fun."
