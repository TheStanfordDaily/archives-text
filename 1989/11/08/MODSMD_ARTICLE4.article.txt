# Stanford grossing $11.5 million from technology licensing

In countless laboratories across campus
and the nation wells an immense reser
voir of useful and marketable inventions,
offshoots of the basic research of faculty
and graduate students.
Only recently are universities begin
ning to exploit these technologies by
patenting and licensing them to private
companies. These companies in turn use
the technology for commercial products
and return millions of dollars in royalties

TRANSFER

to the inventors and their schools.
Stanford has reaped more profits by
far from technology transfer than any
other university in the United States,
grossing $11.5 million in royalties in fis
cal year 1989 and far outpacing the

second-place school, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, which made $3
million last year.
Just four schools — Stanford, MIT and
the University of California and Univer
sity of Wisconsin systems — account for
50 percent of the total licenses granted
to business and royalties received.
Why have these few schools virtually
cornered the market in technology trans
fer between universities and private in
dustry? And why has Stanford, puny
when compared to statewide school sys
tems, succeeded in generating so much

revenue from basic research?
From discovery to production
The process involved in handing over
critical technologies is long and involved
and requires an aggressive and competent
staff to serve as a liaison between re
searchers and business. The 20-person
staff at Stanford's Office of Technology
Licensing serves just that purpose.
Located in the Serra Complex near Old
Pavilion, the licensing office handles all
of the necessary paperwork to move a
flash of brilliance from a laboratory base

ment to a factory floor where it can be
developed and marketed.
The process begins, of course, with a
discovery. Public law states that all in
tellectual property discovered in a uni
versity laboratory belongs to the
researcher.
Therefore, faculty may voluntarily ap
proach the licensing office in hopes of
having the technology patented and de
veloped by businesses, director Niels
Riemars said.
