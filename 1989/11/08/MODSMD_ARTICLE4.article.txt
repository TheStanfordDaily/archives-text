### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
In countless laboratories across campus
and the nation wells an immense reser
voir of useful and marketable inventions,
offshoots of the basic research of faculty
and graduate students.
Only recently are universities begin
ning to exploit these technologies by
patenting and licensing them to private
companies. These companies in turn use
the technology for commercial products
and return millions of dollars in royalties

TRANSFER

to the inventors and their schools.
Stanford has reaped more profits by
far from technology transfer than any
other university in the United States,
grossing $11.5 million in royalties in fis
cal year 1989 and far outpacing the

second-place school, the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, which made $3
million last year.
Just four schools — Stanford, MIT and
the University of California and Univer
sity of Wisconsin systems — account for
50 percent of the total licenses granted
to business and royalties received.
Why have these few schools virtually
cornered the market in technology trans
fer between universities and private in
dustry? And why has Stanford, puny
when compared to statewide school sys
tems, succeeded in generating so much

revenue from basic research?
From discovery to production
The process involved in handing over
critical technologies is long and involved
and requires an aggressive and competent
staff to serve as a liaison between re
searchers and business. The 20-person
staff at Stanford's Office of Technology
Licensing serves just that purpose.
Located in the Serra Complex near Old
Pavilion, the licensing office handles all
of the necessary paperwork to move a
flash of brilliance from a laboratory base

ment to a factory floor where it can be
developed and marketed.
The process begins, of course, with a
discovery. Public law states that all in
tellectual property discovered in a uni
versity laboratory belongs to the
researcher.
Therefore, faculty may voluntarily ap
proach the licensing office in hopes of
having the technology patented and de
veloped by businesses, director Niels
Riemars said.
For those discoveries deemed
marketable, the inventor licenses
the technology to the University,
which files for a patent and seeks
businesses willing to exploit the
technology and pay the University
for the privilege.
Most licensed technology is
patented because many businesses
will not pay to license an unpro
tected invention for fear that an
other company will steal the
technology and undermine their
work.
Because many of the inventions
are rather eclectic and have a
small consumer market, "the
choice of what business we go to
is usually automatic," Riemars
said.
The licensing office receives
about three to four inventions
each week, but only about one of
these is eventually licensed to in
dustry, Riemars said. Of those
licensed, one in eight generate
"significant income," up to
$100,000 per year, and only about
five percent exceed annual profits
of $100,000.
Stanford's most successful
licensing venture is recombinant
DNA methods, the technology
that has spawned virtually the en
tire biotechnology industry.
Created by Stanley Cohen of Stan
ford and Herbert Boyer of UC-San
Francisco, the technology earns
the University millions of dollars
each year.
Aside from money set aside for
the licensing office's $1 million

annual operating budget, the bulk
of the royalty income is divided
evenly among the inventor and
the inventor's department and
school. The departments and
schools must use the money for
educational purposes, according
to Jon Sandelin, an associate at
the licensing office.
The Medical School generates
the majority of marketed inven
tions, with much of the remaining
royalties directed to the School of
Engineering and departments in
the natural sciences, including
chemistry, biology and physics.
The Music Department receives
an income from the work of Music
Prof. John Chowning, whose work
in computer music was licensed
by Yamaha Corp. and is used in
the company's hugely successful
"X" series of keyboard syn
thesizers.
Many universities, conscious of
the United States' declining role
in the world economy, are begin
ning to see the value of transfer
ring technology to business to
help them and the nation stay
competitive within the world mar
ket, Sandelin said.
Since a federal law was passed
in 1980 assigning ownership of
an invention to the school where
it was created, businesses have
become more willing to license
technology developed at univer
sities.
Secrets of success
While these national and inter
national factors have contributed
to a nationwide trend in technol
ogy transfer, how have four
schools so successfully taken ad

vantage of the commercial possi
bilities of their research?
For the University of Wisconsin
and University of California sys
tems, experience makes the dif
ference. Wisconsin has been
shuffling inventions since 1925,
Howard Bremer, director of the
system's licensing office, said.
Since then, perseverance and sup
port from the school have been
key factors in maintaining the of
fice's success, he added.
Many schools are reluctant to
support licensing operations
mainly because "we get more nos
than yeses from businesses,"
Bremer said.
But at Stanford, the business
is relatively new. The Office of
Technology Licensing opened in
1970, when the University saw a
need to base technology-transfer
operations on campus. Prior to
the opening of the office, the Tuc
son, Ariz.-based Research Corp.
handled all the licensing paper
work for Stanford and scores of
other universities.
Licensing office workers are re
luctant to comment on the success

of the office, but Wisconsin's
Bremer attributed Stanford's rise
to "imagination and persever
ance."
"Stanford lifted itself up by its
own bootstraps," Bremer said.
At MIT, an ingrained "culture"
of technological innovation and
development and several role
models who have successfully
marketed their work motivate the
Cambridge, Mass. school to
pursue agreements in technology
licensing.
"Some schools emphasize creat
ing life and some emphasize pub
lishing papers," said John
Preston, director of MlT's office
of technology licensing. "We em
phasize creating life. It is an in
grained part of MIT and part of
Stanford, too."
But perhaps what most helps
these schools keep their
technology-licensing offices afloat
is money.
The cost to a school of disclosing
one invention can reach $1 million
before any profits are generated,
according to Steven Bacon, direc
tor of communications at Re

search Corp. Technologies, the
arm of Research Corp. that
handles technology transactions.
Many schools do not have the
resources and contacts in industry
to support technology transfer on
a large scale.
Stanford and the other three
top schools are financially "ma
ture" enough to handle the mon
etary strains, Bacon said.
Basic research vs. big money
But big money and big problems
often go hand in hand.
A university's success in
making money for professors
from their research may encour
age faculty to switch from basic
research to more marketable and
lucrative ideas, compromising the
independence and mission of a
university.
Asked if he ever confronted pro
fessors over their research aims,
MlT's Preston responded, "Ab
solutely yes .... The more active
the technology transfer, the more
conflicts you will have."
In the past three years, Preston
said he has asked at least six pro
fessors to change the direction of
their research and has cautioned
another 12 that their research
may lead to future conflicts with
the school.
Sandelin said Stanford has
never asked professors to alter
their research for monetary gains,
but he added that "the problem
has to be recognized and acknowl
edged."
Many schools have taken steps
to avoid future problems of re
search redirection. MIT officials
make sure all student theses are
"not biased by commercial incli
nations," Preston said. In addi
tion, the school forbids professors
from taking money from a com
pany in which he or she owns
significant equity.
Likewise, Stanford will not in
vest in companies in which a pro
fessor owns an equity position.
Aiming research toward busi
ness applications is "self
defeating," Riemars said. "Most
applicable inventions build on
basic research."
Still, many schools wrestle with
the conflict of performing strictly

basic research while at the same
time desiring to serve the public
with technological advances and
to strengthen industries, provide
ing jobs for graduates. The suc
cesses in technology transfer have
only served to aggravate the ten
sion.
But while licensing officials are
wary of researchers' sympathies
to business, they also worry about
many businesses' apathy toward
universities.
"Most companies don't have e
decision-making process,"
Riemars said. Many vice presi
dents in charge of research at
American businesses have a
"what's in it for me?" attitude,
unlike the Japanese, who are
much more group-oriented, he
said.
In addition, patents on inven
tions are sometimes challenged,
and universities have often lost
in court decisions made by judges
lacking in technical knowledge.
There are two alternatives to
meet the problems associated with
technology transfer, Preston said.
Schools can either not participate
in the transfer or meet the prob
lems "head on." Few schools are
willing to put up with the head
aches, he said, and that is why
so few can boast the successes of
MIT and Stanford.
Still, there is a significant trend
among many schools toward set
ting up their own licensing offices
and aggressively pursuing ties
with industry.
Wisconsin's Bremer said many
schools are recognizing the value
of the additional income from
royalties and are also glad to see
that, with the licensing and de
veloping of useful inventions,
federal money is indirectly spon
soring products that benefit the
public.
But as more schools enter the
game, will Stanford be able to stay
on top? Opinions on the subject
differ widely. While Stanford's
Riemars said he thinks MIT is
closing fast, MlT's Preston
chuckled at this thought, saying,
"Stanford is going to kill us for
quite some time."


Since Stanford opened Its Office of Technology Licensing in
1970, royalties for the University from inventions have grown
to $11.5 million. The bulk of the royalty money is divided
between the inventor and the inventor's school and depart
ment.
