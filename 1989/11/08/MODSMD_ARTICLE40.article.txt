"AMERICA: Countdown to Lib
eration," a dance-theater per
formance created by Ujamaa
House Resident Assistant Corey
Davis, debuted last night follow
ing controversy over fliers adver
tising the event.
The performance is about an
allegorical corporation named
America which produces "robotic
negroids" for purchase. It
satirizes various stereotypes of
African-Americans.
According to Davis, the piece is
a commentary on "the develop
ment of black consciousness." In
a post-performance question and
answer session, he said, "It is
about people taking the initiative
to liberate themselves, both
sexually and politically."
The performance also raised is

sues of religion, sexuality and
gender. "In our next liberation
movement, both women and gay
people will play a dominant part,"
said Davis. "Our corporate symbol
of the apple was a metaphor for
how Christianity has been used
to oppress black people, and fits
in with both the religious and
sexual themes of the piece," he
said.
Audience members at both the
7:30 and 9:30 p.m. shows in Elliott
Program Center received four
page "brochures" and "order
forms" instead of programs. They
were then taken on a tour
demonstrating "negroids" such as
"Strawberry," an "adult enter
tainment" negroid, and
"Hoopster," a basketball-playing
robot with "superhuman"
strength.
Students and staff in some Uni

versity residences expressed con
cern Monday because fliers
advertising the event read:
"AMERICA announces its public
sale of Negroids." Only in small
letters at the bottom did the fliers
reveal that the announcement on
the flier was only setting the scene
for an artistic performance.
Cast members included stu
dents active in Stanford politics
such as former Council of Presi
dents member Canetta Ivy and
Louis Jackson, an ASSU senator
who is facing charges related to
his participation in the May 15
takeover of the President's Office.
"A lot of parts of the piece did
hit home," said sophomore Tanya
Leake, a cast member.
Sophomore audience member
Karen Westley found the perform
ance "evocative," saying, "It made
me think a lot."
