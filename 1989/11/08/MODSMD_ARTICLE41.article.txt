"The stench of manure under
the floor was unbearable" for Sox
Kitashima as she and her family
attempted to sleep in the horse
stall that was their home after
the American government incar
cerated her family at the outset
of World War 11.
Kitashima, a chair of the Na
tional Coalition for Redress and
Reparations, related her tale of
depravation and humiliation dur
ing her four-year, three-month ex
perience in American
concentration camps last night.

She spoke as part of a program
called "Anti-Asian Violence: The
Community Responds," spon
sored by the Asian American Stu
dents Association, which is
celebrating its 20th anniversary
with various events.
A second speaker, Vu Due
Vuong, director of the Center for
Southeast Asian Refugee Reset
tlement, spoke on the January
Stockton murder incident, in
which Patrick Purdy shot over 100
rounds into a crowd of Cleveland
Elementary School children. Five
were killed and 29 wounded, most
of whom were from Cambodia,

Laos and Vietnam.
Vuong believes that Purdy's at
tack was due not only to his psy
chological problems, but also to
the strong anti-Asian climate in
the United States tcday. He at
tributes this bias to a belief among
many Americans that many of
this country's economic difficul
ties, such as rising property
prices, unemployment and foreign
ownership, are caused by increas
ing immigration of Asians to the
United States.
Some progress has been made
in improving relations between
Asian-Americans and other Amer

icans, both said. Kitashima's
group last year lobbied a presi
dential commission established to
evaluate the grievances of Asian-
Americans put in concentration
camps during the war, resulting
in a settlement awarding each el
igible internee $20,000.
Vuong said that the Southeast
Asian Community Development
Foundation, organized in re
sponse to the Stockton tragedy,
is creating a scholarship fund to
aid Americans of Southeast Asian
descent in college or graduate
studies.
