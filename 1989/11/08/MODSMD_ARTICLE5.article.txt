# Founder says Angels are good role models

Adding a comic flair to his
serious message Curtis Sliwa,
founder of the Alliance of Guard
ian Angels, emphasized the lack
of role models in the Latino and
black communities amidst imita
tions of Dan Rather and Mr. T.
Sliwa also jokingly postulated
that rap musicians Iced-T and
EZ-E are actually "mutants with
chromosome damage."
"Television has an impact on
our thinking," he said, in a
speech last night at Terman Au
ditorium sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau.
He blamed the negative be
havior of popular figures such
as "Scarface", Mr. T and Richard
Pryor for what he sees today as
disproportionate crime in the
minority population.
When asked about positive
role models like Bill Cosby, Sliwa
answered that they have arrived
too late. "The damage has al
ready been done," he said.
One of the reasons for the
creation of the Guardian Angels
was a response to the role model
crisis, he said. A minority of the

Angels are black or Latino, and
they provide examples of people
living functionally without using
drugs and weapons, he added.
Their secondary purpose, ac
cording to Sliwa, is to try to
"undo a terrible wave of selfish,
decadent thinking that has
brought some of the people to
the brink of self-destruction."
After the speech, Sliwa said
he compliments the Stanford
community on its many volun
teer programs that follow his
line of "giving a little back in
return."
Sliwa created the Guardian
Angels in New York City 10
years ago. He began with only
13 members and has bolstered
the group to its present mem
bership of 5,000. To become a
member, one must have no crim
inal record, be at least 16 years
old and complete a three-month
training program.
The training emphasizes first
aid, the proper method of citi
zen's arrest and martial arts.
Once the training is completed,
the Guardian Angel i9 responsi
ble for eight hours per week of
patrol.
