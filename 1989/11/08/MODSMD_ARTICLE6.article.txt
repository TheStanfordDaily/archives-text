# Increased public access sought in judicial cases
## 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Recognizing the lack of a formal
policy regarding release of infor
mation in judicial affairs cases,
University officials are currently
ironing out the conflict between
a student's right to privacy and
the community's right to know
the facts about cases.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and others are
"trying to come up with a com
promise" which would "continue
to respect confidentiality but al
low more release of information"
to the public, Cole said. But dif
ficulties exist because the Univer
sity's written stipulations on con
fidentiality are vague.
The cases of students charged
with a violation of University
rules take one of two routes, de
pending on whether they chal
lenge the charges against them.
Currently, names are kept con
fidential in both cases. Other
details are only disclosed in the
cases of those who challenge the
charges, which is the minority of
cases.
A student who chooses to chal
lenge an investigation has the case
heard by the Stanford Judicial

Council, the body that hears all
student disciplinary cases and
recommends punishments to the
University president.
All information gathered in
cases that go through the Judicial
Council is sent to the Law School
library where it is available to the
public after names have been
crossed out, Cole said. This is "not
a frequently used route," however,
she said.
If the student does not wish to
contest the charges, he or she may
have the case heard informally by
the dean of student affairs, who
will then make a recommendation
to the president.
Records of cases which do not
go through the Judicial Council
are kept in the Judicial Affairs
Office and are made available only
for "specific purposes," such as
the orientation of new Judicial Af
fairs committee members, Cole
said.
Although there is not presently
a policy regarding the release of
this information, Cole said, she
admitted that it is virtually im
possible for an interested outsider
to gain access to these cases.
A section of The Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 is the
main obstacle to public access.
The charter states that any per
son charged has the right "to be
assured that, in private hearings,
any matters of fact which would
tend to identify the person charged
would be kept confidential."
The result of this, Cole says, is
that "the community's interest is
at odds with the student's right
to a confidential process."
One meeting has already taken
place and another is scheduled for
next week. The meetings will con
tinue to take place every two
weeks until a solution is found,
Cole said.
