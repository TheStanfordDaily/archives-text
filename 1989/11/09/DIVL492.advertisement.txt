Stand Up.
Be Counted.
While You Still Have the Choice.
Your right to choose is in jeopardy:
• George Bush, bowing to pressure from the far right—continues to
veto pro-choice legislation supported by the majority of Americans.
• The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear three new cases calculated to
further erode Roe v. Wade.
• State legislatures all across America are poised to further restrict
abortions.
On Sunday, November 12, Americans will take action to dramatize our
support for the right to choose, to demand that this fundamental
American freedom be protected, to demonstrate that we will never go
back to the days when abortion was illegal.
Stand up with us on November 12, when America mobilizes for
women's lives.
Add Your Voice to Choice. Join Reps. Nancy
Pelosi and Barbara Boxer for a town meeting
for women at the Theatre Palace of Fine Arts
at 10:00 a.m. For more information, please
contact Sherri Hamamoto at 202-225-3121.
