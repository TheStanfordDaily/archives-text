## Black candidates victorious 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Black Democrats, scoring
precedent-shattering victories in mayoral elections
around the nation, are taking control of city hall
for the first time in New York, Seattle and other
cities while regaining it in Cleveland.
Virginia's Douglas Wilder challenged a century-old
racial barrier and claimed a thin margin of victory
in his race for governor, while blacks extended and
solidified their control of some of the nation's biggest
cities in Tuesday's odd-year elections.
"It's an excellent testament to the people of Vir
ginia, to the people of this nation, as to how far
we've come in a very short span of time," Wilder
said on NBC's "Today" show, declaring himself the
winner and the nation's first elected black governor.
The Republican whip in the House, Rep. Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, acknowledged the gains for
black Democrats.
"I think a clear signal was sent that Americans
will vote for the best qualified candidates," Gingrich
said on the "CBS This Morning" show. "While I
really wish our guys had won, there is something
fundamentally good for this country."
Jesse Jackson, the two-time black presidential
contender, said, "These gains represent expansion
for the group that was locked out."
In the main mayoral event, David Dinkins won
election in New York over Republican Rudolph
Giuliani — the first time a black has been elected
mayor of the nation's largest city.
Other Democrats who won election as mayor, and
who will become the first blacks to head their cities,
were John Daniels in New Haven, Conn., Chester
Jenkins in Durham, N.C., and Norm Rice in Seattle.
Michael White was elected in Cleveland, succeed
ing white Republican George Voinovich.

Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, who is black, won
a fifth four-year term by defeating black challenger
Tom Barrow.
Dinkins' election in New York and Wilder's claim
to a narrow victory in the Virginia governor's race
raised the likelihood a new array of elected black
leaders would gain national prominence.
Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., the House minority
whip and the nation's highest black elected figure,
praised Dinkins' election and said New York voters
"have rejected the politics of fear." Dinkins
withstood late campaign attacks on his character
and integrity.
Gray said Wilder's apparent success "gives us all
hope — hope that America is maturing and that
people are able to make decisions without regard
to race, but on the issues."
The off-year election put Democratic blacks in
control of most of the nation's big city mayors'
offices. Going into Tuesday's balloting, New York,
Chicago and Houston were the nation's biggest cities
with a white mayor.
The candidacies of Wilder, Virginia's Democratic
lieutenant governor, and Dinkins, the Manhattan
borough president, were noteworthy for their similar
methods. Both ran as mainstream, middle-of-the
road candidates who stressed their experience in
elected office.
They projected an image that was far from the
fiery-preacher and populist outsider appeal of Jack
son. In fact, Wilder's campaign deliberately kept
Jackson at arms' length for fear of alienating white
voters.
Both Dinkins and Wilder appealed for broad sup
port from white voters while counting on near-total
support from black voters.
