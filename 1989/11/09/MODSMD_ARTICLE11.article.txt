# As reform continues, East German Politburo forced to resign

BERLIN (AP) — East German leader
Egon Krenz ousted the ruling Politburo
yesterday and replaced its aging members
with reformers in a dramatic bid to gain
control of a country convulsed by protests
and the exodus of thousands of its people.
The action followed Tuesday's resigna
tion of the entire Cabinet and another
round of street demonstrations involving
more than 100,000 people in four cities
who demanded the right to choose their
own government.
East Germans skeptical about the gov
ernment's promises of reforms continued
to flee their homeland yesterday, with
more than 50,000 people reaching West
Germany since Saturday.
The entire 21-member Politburo
resigned in a major leadership reshuffle,

which opposition leaders and party mem
bers alike had been urging for days. It
was Krenz's boldest move to get a grip
on power since he became leader last
month.
The party's 163-member Central Com
mittee then reaffirmed Krenz as party
leader and voted in four new members
to the Politburo, including Dresden party
chief Hans Modrow, who have backed
Soviet-style reforms.
Krenz and six other members who sup
port his reforms were re-elected to the
ruling body.
Modrow also was nominated for the
post of premier, the state-run news
agency ADN said. The Politburo is the
country's most powerful decision-making
body. The Central Committee approves

leadership and mtyor policy changes.
"Our country is going through a tense
and extremely difficult development,"
Krenz said in a speech to the Central
Committee. He indicated that indepen
dent non-communist groups would be al
lowed a greater role in society.
Meanwhile, ADN said that provincial
authorities in seveial cities were begin
ning to legally register New Forum, the
largest pro-reform group.
Later in the day, Krenz addressed a
crowd of several thousand people —
mostly party faithful — in front of the
Communist Party headquarters. "We
want a socialism that is politically dem
ocratic and morally clean," he said.
In Washington, deputy White House
press secretary Roman Popadiuk said the

Bush administration hoped the dramatic
change in the Politburo's makeup "is a
step on the road to stable and evolution
ary reform."
Yesterday's action reduces the number
of Politburo members from 21 to 11. In
addition to Krenz and Modrow, the Cen
tral Committee re-elected to a Politburo
seat Guenter Schabowski, who has also
become a leading reform advocate.
The Central Committee also voted to
appoint Johannes Chemnitzer as a non
voting member of the Politburo. Chem
nitzer was the first high-ranking East
German politician to suggest discussing
the need for the Berlin Wall.
In a brief dispatch, the official ADN
news agency said Krenz "suggested" the
Politburo resign "so that the responsi

bility for the current situation can be
made clear."
Many members of the outgoing Polit
buro are in their 60s and 70s and are
closely associated with Krenz's mentor,
former hard-line leader Erich Honecker.
Krenz, in office just three weeks, faces
great difficulties as he tries to assert
authority in a country that exploded in
unrest a month ago as it marked the
40th anniversary of its founding as a
Communist state.
Krenz has indicated no intention of
releasing the Communists' grip on power.
He is under growing pressure at home
and abroad to follow the lead of dis
credited Communist rulers in Poland and
Hungary and share power.
