# Nicaraguan rights abuse reported
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Nicaraguan troops have sum
marily executed dozens of unarmed peasants during
operations against the Contra rebels in remote bor
der regions in the last three years, Amnesty Inter
national said yesterday morning.
The worldwide human rights organization also
said reports persist of forced recruitment, torture
and executions of civilians by the U.S.-backed rebels,
but said such abuses have dropped sharply in the
past year.
President Daniel Ortega canceled a 19-month-old
cease-fire last week, but government and Contra
delegations are to meet this week at the United
Nations for the first direct peace talks since June
1988 on ending the 8-year-old conflict.
The Contras are to disband and leave their Hon
duran camps voluntarily by early December under
an Aug. 7 agreement signed by Nicaragua and four
other Central American governments.
Amnesty International said the Nicaraguan gov
ernment has imprisoned some soldiers for unlawful
killings of civilians; pledged to investigate other
such killings; improved legal protection for
detainees; and freed more than 2,000 political pris
oners since 1986.
It also said, however, that since the April 1988
cease-fire, there has been no sign of a decline in
non-combat killings and "disappearances" of
civilians blamed on security forces.
Army units allegedly have killed dozens of un
armed civilians in provinces bordering Honduras

and Costa Rica and in Indian-dominated regions on
the Atlantic coast where fighting against the Contras
once was intense, the report said.
In many cases, the victims allegedly were singled
out "in punishment or reprisal for no other reason
that their suspected sympathy or support for the
insurgent forces," the report said.
Witnesses also have alleged that unarmed
peasants have been shot to death while fleeing army
patrols seeking to enforce military conscription, it
said.
"It appears that, following the withdrawal of Con
tra forces, some military units ... are resorting to
killings during operations to identify or neutralize
networks of suspected Contra supporters and sym
pathizers," the report said.
"Punitive action by the government, while indi
cating that it does not condone such abuses, has
so far been insufficient to halt them," it added.
It says the precise circumstances of the killings
are often difficult or impossible to establish because
there are no independent witnesses.
The authorities contend that, in some cases, sol
diers acted in self-defense because victims were sus
pected of being armed, hostile or dangerous. The
report documents 56 cases of unlawful executions.
In three separate cases in which 10 civilians were
killed, the government sentenced 17 military and
police personnel to prison terms ranging from six
years to the maximum 30 years, the report said.
