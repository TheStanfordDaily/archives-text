## Justice in the dark 
### 
More information on
judicial cases must be
open to the public

THE STANFORD community
has traditionally been in the
dark about the effectiveness
of its judicial system, and it's time
for a little illumination.
Though it has no formal policy
for releasing information about
judicial cases, the Judicial Affairs
Office withholds information that
could serve as a valuable public
check on the Stanford judicial sys
tem.
Currently, records of cases which
are decided by the dean of student
affairs are kept in the office and,
according to Judicial Affairs Offi
cer Sally Cole, are virtually impos
sible for interested outsiders to
access.
Further, records of accusations
that have insufficient evidence to
go through the judicial process are
kept in Cole's personal files and
are destroyed after the students
involved have graduated.
Only cases that have been
decided by the Stanford Judicial
Council get released at the end of
each year, landing on the shelves
at the Law School Library.
Cole and Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons have already had one
meeting to decide this freedom of
information issue, but they have
set no deadline for a final decision.
Though the tradition of secrecy
might satisfy the intent of the Jud
icial Charter to protect the rights
of the accused and convicted, it
does not satisfy the public's right
to know whether or not the judicial
process is working sufficiently.
A recent American Council of
Education poll of freshmen found
that 37 percent cheated at least
once during the year. There have

been an average of only 20 Honor
Code convictions per year at Stan
ford since 1983.
Can we believe that Stanford
students are so much more intrinsi
cally honorable than the rest of
the nation's student population?
More likely, the judicial process
needs some work.
Information regarding cases
decided by the dean of student af
fairs and all cases dropped by Jud
icial Affairs should be made public.
Stanford should know in a timely
fashion what violations have been
alleged and what violations have
been confirmed, as well as the con
sequences.
Names of convicted violators
should be made public. A penalty
of no credit or one quarter suspen
sion does not serve as sufficient
deterrents if the student remains
anonymous.
An alleged violator's name
should not be dragged through the
mud without a fair trial, but the
specific events surrounding the al
leged violations need to be made
public. There are many questions
that will remain unanswered as
long as Judicial Affairs continues
to classify information.
How do we know what legal
precedents for cases exist if the
information is not public? How do
we know that cases are being tried
fairly and quickly if we do not even
know what cases exist in the first
place? Or that students are not
getting off for infractions that the
community feels are violations
without even going through a trial?
And most importantly, where are
the public checks and balances on
the process in general?
The community should not sit
passively and accept that the jud
icial proceedings of this campus
are beyond reproach.
Only when the process is
brought into the light can the com
munity make an honest judgment
about its effectiveness.
