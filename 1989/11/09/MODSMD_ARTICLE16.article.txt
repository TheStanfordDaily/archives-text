Destructive actions at Tresidder serve no one

THE ARTICLES, letters and
editorial that appeared in The
Daily this past week reflected
some of the tensions that arise when
difficult budgetary decisions must be
made.
We want to reiterate that Tresidder
Union is managing this budget reduc
tion by trying to balance several com
peting priorities. First and foremost is
Tresidder's mission to provide services
— food, programs, facilities — to the
campus community.
We are trying to maintain the integ
rity of that mission while living within
our means. We have done so without
laying off staff.
Several perspectives on these issues

have been mentioned in The Daily.
None can stand alone. Each is part of
a larger picture that includes many
voices and interests.
The Tresidder leadership has been
trying to fulfill its responsibility to
hear and balance many different views.
This is a difficult task. It takes
thought and careful review. Where
compromises can be made, they are
being made.
It is important that an attitude of
reason prevail as we try to resolve
these issues. This cannot happen as
long as people are reacting emotionally.
I will offer some examples.
There has been vandalism to the
dining room and information foyer

carpets. Acid has been poured on them,
destroying the investment that students
have made in those spaces for the past
two years. Toilets have been intention
ally plugged to cause damage.
Although we do not know who is
responsible for the damage, we know
that such incidents have occured in the
past when there has been a disagree
ment between Tresidder management
and some of the United Stanford
Workers' leadership. In a financially
difficult time, these purposeful acts
serve no one, least of all students.
Tresidder staff have been the targets
of harassment by USW officials and
employees. In the past, the personal
property (such as cars) of staff have

been damaged. These senseless acts do
nothing to advance the cause of
workers, students or other staff.
Tresidder will continue to work
through these issues in a reasonable
manner. Much has already been accom
plished. During this process, students
are invited to ask questions, so they
can understand as many perspectives
as possible.
It is time to rise above vandalism
and name calling, and get on with the
business of making Tresidder work for
our University.
