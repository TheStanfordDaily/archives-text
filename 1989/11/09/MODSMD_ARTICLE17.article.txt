# Columnist resorts to closed-mindedness and irresponsibility
## 
### 
I am writing in response to Cheryl
Taylor's column on Monday (Nov. 6)
entitled "Being 'politically correct.' " I
could not help feeling, upon reading
the column, a mounting sense of frus
tration approaching exasperation.
It is not that I am so diametrically
opposed to Taylor's opinions (I am
not), but rather that I find, in both
her approaches to the subject of
campus politics and her methods of
persuasion, that she is guilty of many
of the same offenses she might more
readily perceive in her opponents.
Taylor accuses a vaguely-defined,
unnamed minority — "the right wing"
— of inhibiting progress on campus
towards certain goals she assumes
should be accepted by all.
Substitute the term "right wing"
with "communist" and the column
takes on a reactionary tone which one

might associate with a much darker
era in U.S. history than the present.
Her notion that there is a correct
way to approach politics, her belief in
a single-minded vision that should exist
on campus and her implicit acceptance
of certain means through which selec
tive goals can be accomplished repre
sents a closed-mindedness which I feel
is inimical to constructive progress
toward a common consensus on impor
tant issues among the student body.
Her division of the campus into
camps is more reminiscent of a hack
neyed political paradigm than it is a
true dipiction of the actual situation.
Such an approach stifles both debate
and discussion.
To my mind, the purpose of a news
paper column is not simply to espouse
rhetoric from either the right or the
left, but to provide informed and ed
ucated opinions to a generally less
informed public.
I challenge Taylor to act more
responsibly, to back up her claims with
solid fact, and to rely less on her im
agination and emotion and more on
the evidence at hand. Otherwise, she

may ultimately end up losing more
followers to her cause and defeating
her own purpose.
