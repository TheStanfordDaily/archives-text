# Series on AIDS Education Week was appreciated
## 
### 
We are writing to express the deep
appreciation of Cowell Student Health
Center for the excellent coverage that
The Daily gave to the events of AIDS
Education Week.
The stories that appeared on a regu
lar basis illustrated the range of con
cerns faced by people with AIDS, by
their families and friends and by all of
us who are concerned about the spread
of HIV infection.
The many individuals across campus
who gave freely of their time and
energies on the AIDS Education Week
Task Force showed the importance of
community in articulating a response

to an epidemic that threatens the
health and well-being of us all.
On Wednesday evening, Rachel Baghy
encouraged and helped an audience of
Stanford students to compose a piece
of music that would commemorate the
events of the week. The composition
was eventually built around three
words: memory, caring and hope.
As the chant wove its way through
the room in a three-part succession, it
became clear that those three words
were the foundation on which the re
sponse of the Stanford community had
been based.
The articles that appeared in The
Daily contributed to the increased
awareness and understanding of the
issues facing our society as we confront
the many difficult issues raised by the
spectre of the AIDS virus.
Once again, on behalf of all who
worked for this week, we express our
thanks.
