# Grad summer fellowships cut
## Reduced financial support for research angers students 
### Paul Owens 
A University decision that will reduce
financial support for some graduate stu
dents next summer has upset members
of the ASSU's new Graduate Concerns
Committee.
Under the decision, announced in a
September memorandum by Dean of
Graduate Studies Elizabeth Traugott,
summer research fellowships will no
longer be available for first- and second
year graduate students in 10 humanities
departments.
In prior years, graduate students have
been eligible for summer research fel
lowships, which provide higher funding
than regular summer fellowships. Grad
uate Studies officials decided to limit
the research option after determining
that first- and second-year students re
ceiving research fellowships often were
not engaged in actual research.
Stanford will continue to offer those
students regular summer fellowships,
however. Last summer, a research fel

lowship was worth $1,733, while a reg
ular fellowship was worth $1,050, about
40 percent less.
The departments involved are known
as Fellows Plan departments. Assoc.
Dean of Graduate Studies Karlene
Dickey estimated that between 60 and
70 students in these departments will
be affected by the new policy.
Members of the ASSU's Graduate
Concerns Committee, created last
month, said that the change will force
those students to work more and study
less during the summer.
Committee member Josie Saldano
said that graduate students limited to
regular fellowships will need to work
at least 20 hours per week in order to
pay their bills. The regular fellowship
funding "won't even cover rent for most
students," said Saldano.
"This action shows a serious break
down in communication between the
administration and graduate students.
They don't know our needs," she added.
Dickey said the change was made in

response to reports from previous first
and second-year students who received
the research fellowships. "Three or
four" of those students, said Dickey, told
her that they were not actually con
ducting research but were instead doing
preliminary coursework or studying for
qualifying exams.
Dickey said that those students them
selves felt that they should not be re
ceiving higher funding for research
under the circumstances. The adminis
tration agreed.
Committee member Joe Ward ques
tioned why reports from a few students
would lead to the elimination of re
search fellowships for all first- and
second-year graduate students in
Fellows Plan departments.
"Why should everyone eligible be pun
ished because a few said that they
weren't doing research?" he said.
Ward and Saldano both suggested
that instead of eliminating the research
