# Grad summer fellowships cut
## Reduced financial support for research angers students 
### Paul Owens 
A University decision that will reduce
financial support for some graduate stu
dents next summer has upset members
of the ASSU's new Graduate Concerns
Committee.
Under the decision, announced in a
September memorandum by Dean of
Graduate Studies Elizabeth Traugott,
summer research fellowships will no
longer be available for first- and second
year graduate students in 10 humanities
departments.
In prior years, graduate students have
been eligible for summer research fel
lowships, which provide higher funding
than regular summer fellowships. Grad
uate Studies officials decided to limit
the research option after determining
that first- and second-year students re
ceiving research fellowships often were
not engaged in actual research.
Stanford will continue to offer those
students regular summer fellowships,
however. Last summer, a research fel

lowship was worth $1,733, while a reg
ular fellowship was worth $1,050, about
40 percent less.
The departments involved are known
as Fellows Plan departments. Assoc.
Dean of Graduate Studies Karlene
Dickey estimated that between 60 and
70 students in these departments will
be affected by the new policy.
Members of the ASSU's Graduate
Concerns Committee, created last
month, said that the change will force
those students to work more and study
less during the summer.
Committee member Josie Saldano
said that graduate students limited to
regular fellowships will need to work
at least 20 hours per week in order to
pay their bills. The regular fellowship
funding "won't even cover rent for most
students," said Saldano.
"This action shows a serious break
down in communication between the
administration and graduate students.
They don't know our needs," she added.
Dickey said the change was made in

response to reports from previous first
and second-year students who received
the research fellowships. "Three or
four" of those students, said Dickey, told
her that they were not actually con
ducting research but were instead doing
preliminary coursework or studying for
qualifying exams.
Dickey said that those students them
selves felt that they should not be re
ceiving higher funding for research
under the circumstances. The adminis
tration agreed.
Committee member Joe Ward ques
tioned why reports from a few students
would lead to the elimination of re
search fellowships for all first- and
second-year graduate students in
Fellows Plan departments.
"Why should everyone eligible be pun
ished because a few said that they
weren't doing research?" he said.
Ward and Saldano both suggested
that instead of eliminating the research
fellowships for some students,
Stanford should make it clear to
eligible students that they are ex
pected to conduct research in or
der to receive the higher funding.
Dickey said that although sum
mer research fellowships have
been available for the last 10
years, Stanford has never guar
anteed graduate students support
above the regular fellowship level.
Saldano disagreed. She said
that some graduate departments
have all but assured incoming stu
dents that they would be eligible
for the higher research fellowship
total during summers.
Two changes announced along
with the research fellowship are
less controversial. One will allow
graduate students receiving regu
lar fellowships to work more than
eight hours a week during the
summer.

In another change, Stanford
will end its policy of reducing the
fellowships of graduate students
who receive external awards.
From now on, such students will
be able to retain all of their fel
lowship money, unless the exter
nal award exceeds Stanford's
estimated budget for a single, off
campus student.
Committee members said the
two changes were both positive
and necessary.
But members said the new
policy on research fellowships
raises broader issues about Stan
ford's commitment to supporting
its graduate students.
It is already almost impossible,
they said, for doctoral students to
complete their work in the four
years during which they are guar
anteed funding. For those stu
dents who will now be ineligible
for higher-paying research fellow
ships, the need to work more in
their first two summers will set
back their academic progress even
further, they said.

For the past several years, pro
spective students offered graduate
support at Stanford have received
a memorandum from Traugott
stating that Stanford "con
centrates on graduate training
without continual concern about
funding. We believe the program
is quite unusual and urge you to
give this fact consideration when
you make your decision on where
you wish to embark on graduate
studies."
But Traugott said that this
memo has always been accompa
nied by information that spells
out exactly how much graduate
students can expect. Like Dickey,
Traugott stressed that students
in Fellows Plan departments have
never been promised funding be
yond regular fellowships in the
summer.
Dickey said that Stanford is one
of very few universities that
guarantees four years of fellow
ship support
"We want communication, not
confrontation," Ward said.
