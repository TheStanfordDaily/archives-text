## A 						real cause for worry 
### 
HAVE YOU experienced racism
here at Stanford?
The question took me by
surprise. I had been telling my friend
about some of my concerns about imple
menting Asian-American Studies here at
Stanford and the efforts to get the redress
payments for the Asian-Americans in
terned during World War 11, when he
asked me that.
We hear and talk a lot about multicul
turalism and racism here at Stanford,
but no one had ever asked me if I was
actually a part of it.
It had been a long time since kids on
the school playground would call me
names or pull on the corners of their
eyes and buck their teeth out, making
weird sounds that they thought sounded
like Chinese. But Stanford is a long way
from my elementary school playground
back in San Jose.
Here, I can walk through White Plaza
and not worry about someone hurling
rocks and garbage at me and telling me
to go back home. There aren't lynchings
or burning crosses around every corner
of the quad. We don't live under a system
of apartheid and students aren't executed
for peaceful protests.
So, if the violence of racial incidents
here at Stanford doesn't measure up to
those across the country, why do I worry
about issues of race and ethnicity here?
Why should a kid from middle class sub
urbia who is attending one of the most
expensive and prestigious universities in
the country worry about things that
seemingly don't affect him? I myself must
seem like living proof that racism in

America is dead. I'm sure that we can
agree that for that one, we can put a
check in the box marked false.
But, the question still remains. Why
worry? If we are here at Disneyland, why
concern ourselves with what's going on
in East L.A.?
Had I been guilty of accepting an
agenda just because it was the right thing
to do and not because I had thought it
over carefully. Had I neglected to ask
hard questions twice, check my sources,
run a detailed credit check and kick the
tires before making a wise choice?
Well .. . no, I don't think so.
The desire for multiculturalism doesn't
come merely from a desire to put a band
aid on racism here at Stanford. It comes
from the belief that there is a distinct
American culture that is a mix of the
many different cultures of the people who
come here.
It differs from the melting pot analogy
in that it recognizes that there are dif
ferences that ultimately can not and
should not be lost in simple assimilation.
It rejects the notion that to become a
true American, you must lose the culture
of your ancestors and soak up that of
"Leave It to Beaver."
It teaches that differences in color and
appearance will always be noticed, that
it's an inescapable part of human nature
to notice such differences. The twist is
that these differences can be seen as pos
itive. It teaches that color blindness isn't
necessarily the best way to deal with race
and ethnicity.
It also rejects the notion that the basic
beliefs of our American culture, the fibers

on which we live our everyday lives, are
not exclusive to Western Culture.
The ideal of democracy was developed
by people on all different continents, from
Africa to South America to Asia, and yes,
even Europe. The philosophical thought
of Lao Tze and Chuang Tze is just as
deep and just as relevant as that of Soc
rates or Freud.
But, the question still remains: why
here at Stanford where the grass is green
and the fountains are pumping? Maybe
it's just because we want to be ideal for
the sake of being ideal.
But, if we want to think of it in terms
of the real world out there, we turn to
the fact that we aren't going to be stu
dents forever.
Many of us aspire to be leaders,
whether it be in business, politics, edu
cation or even in just raising our own
children. What we do and what we believe
will effect many others.
Despite the fact that different groups
on campus have tried to tag those who
work for progressive change and for mul
ticulturalism as unthinking or simply
reliving the '60s, the fact remains that
there is a good reason behind all of this
screaming and yelling.

over carefully. Had I neglected to ask
hard questions twice, check my sources,
run a detailed credit check and kick the
tires before making a wise choice?
Well .. . no, I don't think so.
The desire for multiculturalism doesn't
come merely from a desire to put a band
aid on racism here at Stanford. It comes
from the belief that there is a distinct
American culture that is a mix of the
many different cultures of the people who
come here.
It differs from the melting pot analogy
in that it recognizes that there are dif
ferences that ultimately can not and
should not be lost in simple assimilation.
It rejects the notion that to become a
true American, you must lose the culture
of your ancestors and soak up that of
"Leave It to Beaver."
It teaches that differences in color and
appearance will always be noticed, that
it's an inescapable part of human nature
to notice such differences. The twist is
that these differences can be seen as pos
itive. It teaches that color blindness isn't
necessarily the best way to deal with race
and ethnicity.
It also rejects the notion that the basic
beliefs of our American culture, the fibers

on which we live our everyday lives, are
not exclusive to Western Culture.
The ideal of democracy was developed
by people on all different continents, from
Africa to South America to Asia, and yes,
even Europe. The philosophical thought
of Lao Tze and Chuang Tze is just as
deep and just as relevant as that of Soc
rates or Freud.
But, the question still remains: why
here at Stanford where the grass is green
and the fountains are pumping? Maybe
it's just because we want to be ideal for
the sake of being ideal.
But, if we want to think of it in terms
of the real world out there, we turn to
the fact that we aren't going to be stu
dents forever.
Many of us aspire to be leaders,
whether it be in business, politics, edu
cation or even in just raising our own
children. What we do and what we believe
will effect many others.
Despite the fact that different groups
on campus have tried to tag those who
work for progressive change and for mul
ticulturalism as unthinking or simply
reliving the '60s, the fact remains that
there is a good reason behind all of this
screaming and yelling.
