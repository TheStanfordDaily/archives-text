Animal rights groups have valid concerns, reasonable methods

Although it was honorable of
Gary Loeb to attempt to discuss
a pervading issue of our time,
that of animal rights ("Animal research
pays off"), the superficiality and
naivete in which he treated the issue
shows the lack of research (no pun
intended) he put into learning about
what the animal rights movement and
philosophy are really all about.
If Loeb had looked further into the
animal rights movement and perhaps
taken the time to explore who is in
volved, he would have found students,
doctors, veterinarians, biologists, scien
tists, philosophers and politicians, to
name but a few.
The animal rights movement is not
one of putting animals above human
beings, or as the clich6d example
states, choosing a monkey over a child,
but instead, the movement arises out
of frustration over an attitude that
claims to have an unquestionable right

to use animals in any way, in any
number and for any cause, be it for
scientific, entertainment, hedonistic or
selfish reasons.
What most animal rights supporters
endorse is an attitude of responsibility
towards the animals we have so
thoughtlessly exploited in the past and
continue to do so today.
Literally millions of animals are used
each year in research. The mtyority of
this research is not the clear-cut exam
ples of cancer and AIDS research that
Loeb cites. Instead, the mtyority of
animal research in this country is
toxicity testing on animals.
The animal rights movement does
not call for cosmetic companies to sell
cosmetics that are potentially harmful
to humans and adopt an attitude of
"at your own risk." Of course not, this
would be absurd. What the movement
does stress is the search for an imme
diate use of alternative methods of

testing.
For example, the Draize test has
been used for years on rabbits to test
everything from shampoos to deter
gents. The test consists of restraining
hundreds of rabbits in stocks and
putting pure concentrations of these
various substances into their eyes.
Since rabbits have no tear ducts like
humans, they cannot dilute the sub
stances on their own. From these
inhumane tests the effects of these
substances are seen and heard as the
rabbits go blind and suffer excruciating
pain.
The most tragic element of this
experiment is that alternative methods
of testing exist right now and have
existed for years. Companies such as
Nexxus, Freemans, Sleepy Hollow and
Beauty Without Cruelty have been
manufacturing cosmetics that have not
been tested on animals for years, and
as a patron of these companies I can

attest to the high quality of their
products.
Today mainstream companies such as
Avon are abandoning these barbaric
methods for alternative methods, such
as tissue cultures and computer models
that prove to be as or more effective
than tests such as the Draize and the
LDSSO test, in which raw substances
are placed on the bare shaved skin of
animals.
It is true that alternatives to all
animal research do not exist at this
time. What animal rights supporters
call for is the continuing effort of our
society to search for those alternative
methods, setting up facilities such as
the John Hopkins' Center for Alterna
tives to Animal Research, directed
towards the goal of avoiding cruelty in
animal research whenever and wher
ever we can.
Until the time when all animal
research can be phased out, animals

will undoubtedly have to be used to
combat tragic diseases such as AIDS,
cancer and muscular dystrophy.
But in the meantime, we can elimi
nate the excessively cruel, repetitious
and unnecessary testing that we have
fallen back upon in our laziness of
cruelty.
Ghandi once said that one can tell
the way a society treats other human
beings by the way they treat their
animals. We all should work to a soci
ety that is responsible in our treatment
and care of animals.
In closing, to Gary Loeb, who
believes that "animals don't care," I
leave a parting quote from Jeremy
Bentham, the famous philosopher:
"The question is not, 'Can they rea
son?', the question is, 'Can they suf
fer?' "

But in the meantime, we can elimi
nate the excessively cruel, repetitious
and unnecessary testing that we have
fallen back upon in our laziness of
cruelty.
Ghandi once said that one can tell
the way a society treats other human
beings by the way they treat their
animals. We all should work to a soci
ety that is responsible in our treatment
and care of animals.
In closing, to Gary Loeb, who
believes that "animals don't care," I
leave a parting quote from Jeremy
Bentham, the famous philosopher:
"The question is not, 'Can they rea
son?', the question is, 'Can they suf
fer?' "
