## Stanford football preps for trip to red-hot Arizona State Tunney honored as Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Two weeks ago, the final three
games on Stanford's schedule
looked fairly easy. The team was
facing UCLA, Arizona State and
California, who, with Stanford,
made up the last four teams in
the Pacific 10 Conference stand
ings.
While the Cardinal completed
the first step of a strong finish
by beating the Bruins 17-14 Sat
urday, the last two games sud
denly look much tougher.
Stanford inside linebacker Jono
Tunney was named the Pac-10 De
fensive Player of the week for his
performance in that win. Tunney
had 13 tackles to lead the Cardinal
defense that shut out the Bruins
in the second half.
The formerly hapless Golden
Bears upended erstwhile Rose
Bowl-contender Arizona after
being down 21-0 last week for
their first league win. Meanwhile,
Arizona State has been running
wild in the state of Washington.
Two weeks ago the Sun Devils
upset Washington State as quar
terback Paul Justin threw for
more than 500 yards. The follow
ing week ASU continued to roll,
edging Washington.
Before the game against the
Cougars, Coach Larry Marmie
changed his offense from a pro-set
to a one-back set. But Marmie
doesn't call it a run-and-shoot and
doesn't take credit for turning his
team's season around with the
switch.
"The credit goes to the players,"
he said. "They've just continued
to work. In the Washington State
game, things just seemed to fall
in place for us."
Marmie said that the team went
to the one-back set because it
couldn't count on being able to
get two healthy running backs
into the game at the same time
(sounds familiar, huh?). "We went
a little bit more to the one-back
set two weeks ago and we did it
for a really good reason," Marmie
said. "We lost David Winsley to
injury."

'We certainly have
been concerned with
the number of points
and the number of
yards we've given up.
Our goal is to really
settle down and play
a little tougher and
more consistently.'

Winsley hurt his ankle and
missed the Washington State
game. The 5-foot-6 193-pound
tailback did play against the
Huskies last week and will play
Saturday. He leads the Sun Devils
with 435 yards rushing and has
10 catches for 85 yards.
With Winsley out and ASU run
ning the one-back offense the last
two weeks, Justin has completed
51-of-83 passes (.614) for 873
yards, seven touchdowns and one
interception. He was named the
co-Pacific 10 Conference Offensive
Player of the Week with teammate
Ron Fair after the WSU game.
Marmie is not that surprised
with Justin's play over the past
couple weeks, however. "I think
that Paul has pretty-much played
the way we thought he would,"
Marmie said. "We had pretty high
expectations for him."
Another player the Sun Devils
were expecting a lot from, inside
linebacker Mark Tingstad, will
not play this week. Tingstad, the
Pac-10'8 top returning tackier
from last season, injured his neck
against Washington last week. He
was taken to the University's
hospital and stayed there until his
release Tuesday afternoon.
He suffered damage to his
spinal cord, but all X-rays were
negative. He is spending the week
at his home in Spanaway, Wash.
He is reportedly doing well but
will likely not play football again.
Even with Tingstad, the Sun

Devil defense has struggled this
season, giving up more than 400
yards per game. "We certainly
have been concerned with the
number of points and the number
of yards we've given up," Marmie
said. "Our goal is to really settle
down and play a little tougher
and more consistently."
But Arizona State's defense will
be squaring off against a Stanford
offense that is coming off one of
its best all-around showings. De
spite the fact that quarterback
Brian Johnson hobbled in the
pocket and Stanford only had 268
yards of total offense, the team
was able to control the ball with
a rushing attack. The Cardinal
will have to do the same thing
Saturday to keep Justin on the
sidelines where he can't do any
harm.
Stanford will likely have to con
trol the ball without Jon Volpe,
who continues to be listed as
doubtful following arthroscopic
surgery on his knee last month.
Volpe is still Stanford's third
leading rusher after having played
in only the first two games of the
season.
So, for the second week in a
row, Stanford will start a back
field of Johnson, Galen Foster and
Tom Vardell. Foster bruised his
right shoulder against UCLA and
Vardell pinched a nerve in his
neck, but both are probable.
Card notes
Justin has moved up to third in
the Pac-10 in total ofTense following
hiß two big games. He is averaging
241.3 yards per game. Stanford quar
terback Steve Smith is eighth at 156.9
yards per game.
Meanwhile five Pac-10 running
backs have rushed for more yards
than the Cardinal has as a team this
season.
Fair, who had 19 catches against
WSU, is now the league's leading
receiver with 53 receptions. Stanford's
Ed McCaffrey is fourth, Scott Es
chelman is sixth and Jim Price is
ninth.
Alan Grant is second in the league
in kickofT returns at 25.8 yards per
return and Kevin Scott is seventh.
Because of those two, Stanford ranks
third in the Pac-10 in that category.

"The credit goes to the players,"
he said. "They've just continued
to work. In the Washington State
game, things just seemed to fall
in place for us."
Marmie said that the team went
to the one-back set because it
couldn't count on being able to
get two healthy running backs
into the game at the same time
(sounds familiar, huh?). "We went
a little bit more to the one-back
set two weeks ago and we did it
for a really good reason," Marmie
said. "We lost David Winsley to
injury."

'We certainly have
been concerned with
the number of points
and the number of
yards we've given up.
Our goal is to really
settle down and play
a little tougher and
more consistently.'

Winsley hurt his ankle and
missed the Washington State
game. The 5-foot-6 193-pound
tailback did play against the
Huskies last week and will play
Saturday. He leads the Sun Devils
with 435 yards rushing and has
10 catches for 85 yards.
With Winsley out and ASU run
ning the one-back offense the last
two weeks, Justin has completed
51-of-83 passes (.614) for 873
yards, seven touchdowns and one
interception. He was named the
co-Pacific 10 Conference Offensive
Player of the Week with teammate
Ron Fair after the WSU game.
Marmie is not that surprised
with Justin's play over the past
couple weeks, however. "I think
that Paul has pretty-much played
the way we thought he would,"
Marmie said. "We had pretty high
expectations for him."
Another player the Sun Devils
were expecting a lot from, inside
linebacker Mark Tingstad, will
not play this week. Tingstad, the
Pac-10'8 top returning tackier
from last season, injured his neck
against Washington last week. He
was taken to the University's
hospital and stayed there until his
release Tuesday afternoon.
He suffered damage to his
spinal cord, but all X-rays were
negative. He is spending the week
at his home in Spanaway, Wash.
He is reportedly doing well but
will likely not play football again.
Even with Tingstad, the Sun

Devil defense has struggled this
season, giving up more than 400
yards per game. "We certainly
have been concerned with the
number of points and the number
of yards we've given up," Marmie
said. "Our goal is to really settle
down and play a little tougher
and more consistently."
But Arizona State's defense will
be squaring off against a Stanford
offense that is coming off one of
its best all-around showings. De
spite the fact that quarterback
Brian Johnson hobbled in the
pocket and Stanford only had 268
yards of total offense, the team
was able to control the ball with
a rushing attack. The Cardinal
will have to do the same thing
Saturday to keep Justin on the
sidelines where he can't do any
harm.
Stanford will likely have to con
trol the ball without Jon Volpe,
who continues to be listed as
doubtful following arthroscopic
surgery on his knee last month.
Volpe is still Stanford's third
leading rusher after having played
in only the first two games of the
season.
So, for the second week in a
row, Stanford will start a back
field of Johnson, Galen Foster and
Tom Vardell. Foster bruised his
right shoulder against UCLA and
Vardell pinched a nerve in his
neck, but both are probable.
Card notes
Justin has moved up to third in
the Pac-10 in total ofTense following
hiß two big games. He is averaging
241.3 yards per game. Stanford quar
terback Steve Smith is eighth at 156.9
yards per game.
Meanwhile five Pac-10 running
backs have rushed for more yards
than the Cardinal has as a team this
season.
Fair, who had 19 catches against
WSU, is now the league's leading
receiver with 53 receptions. Stanford's
Ed McCaffrey is fourth, Scott Es
chelman is sixth and Jim Price is
ninth.
Alan Grant is second in the league
in kickofT returns at 25.8 yards per
return and Kevin Scott is seventh.
Because of those two, Stanford ranks
third in the Pac-10 in that category.

Junior Jono Tunney led Stanford's defense with 13 tackles in last week's upset of UCLA. For his
efforts, TUnney was named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week.
Two weeks ago, the final three
games on Stanford's schedule
looked fairly easy. The team was
facing UCLA, Arizona State and
California, who, with Stanford,
made up the last four teams in
the Pacific 10 Conference stand
ings.
While the Cardinal completed
the first step of a strong finish
by beating the Bruins 17-14 Sat
urday, the last two games sud
denly look much tougher.
Stanford inside linebacker Jono
Tunney was named the Pac-10 De
fensive Player of the week for his
performance in that win. Tunney
had 13 tackles to lead the Cardinal
defense that shut out the Bruins
in the second half.
The formerly hapless Golden
Bears upended erstwhile Rose
Bowl-contender Arizona after
being down 21-0 last week for
their first league win. Meanwhile,
Arizona State has been running
wild in the state of Washington.
Two weeks ago the Sun Devils
upset Washington State as quar
terback Paul Justin threw for
more than 500 yards. The follow
ing week ASU continued to roll,
edging Washington.
Before the game against the
Cougars, Coach Larry Marmie
changed his offense from a pro-set
to a one-back set. But Marmie
doesn't call it a run-and-shoot and
doesn't take credit for turning his
team's season around with the
switch.
"The credit goes to the players,"
he said. "They've just continued
to work. In the Washington State
game, things just seemed to fall
