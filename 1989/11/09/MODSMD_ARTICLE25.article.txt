# Athletes can accept taunting in sports, but sometimes it hurts

Get up, fat boy."
This was the friendly concern
of one of the University of Oregon
players as I was lying on the field with
a sprained knee. His taunt took me by
surprise, because most players never say
anything when another player goes down.
Most are haunted by a feeling that they
could be next.
Taunting is something which athletes
have to endure.
Almost as long as I can recall playing
sports, I remember being taunted.
It starts out innocent enough in Little
league baseball. Anyone who ever played
will remember chanting, "Hey batter, bat
ter. . . . Hey batter, SWING!" This tid bit
of "chatter" is used more to keep the kid

in right field from falling asleep than to
distract the diminutive 9-year-old at the
plate who has trouble lifting the bat.
As the seriousness in sports increased
when I grew older, so did the severity of

the taunts.
While playing basketball, during my
freshman year in high school, a woman
went into hysterics when I aggressively
fouled her son to keep him from making
an easy layup. She screamed at the ref
eree and told him that I should be kicked
out of the game and put back on the
football field. She probably was right.
One of the best things about football
is that it is much harder to hear people
taunt than in sports like baseball or bas
ketball. It is actually very motivating â€”
to run onto a field in front of 70,000
hostile fans, who are booing mercilessly.
Most of the jeers that I can hear occur
when I am on the sidelines warming up
before I snap a punt. People don't have

much imagination. Usually they yell
things like, "Your going to blow it, 66,"
or "It's going over his head." These taunts
haven't evolved much since the days of
"Hey batter, SWING!"
There are only a couple of taunts which
stick in my memory as hurting.
The first one did not stun me. It hap
pened immediately after we lost the 1986
Big Game, which we were heavily favored
to win. A weenie clad in blue and gold
ran on the field after the game and was
waving his index finger in my face, im
plying that they were number one. Ir
ritating but tolerable.
The second one shocked me. Immedi
ately after the aforementioned weenie had
gotten out of my face, I saw a person

wearing a Stanford sweatshirt standing
over the tunnel which led to the locker
room. Our team had just played as hard
as it could for 60 minutes and suffered
its most disappointing loss of the year
(we only lost three that year). However,
this man perched himself over the tunnel
and shook his head from side to side and
said, "You guys stink." Ouch.
The best defense a team has against
the jeers which come from an inhospitable
crowd is simply to win the game. There
aren't too many cocky fans after a crush
ing 40-0 defeat. If someone taunts you
after a game like that, you just laugh.
Aside from a few annoying sack dances
