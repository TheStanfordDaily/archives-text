# Nadler finds niche in community service
## Coach says junior soccer player has improved dramatically since freshman year 
### Aden Fine 
When Evan Nadler came to Stanford
three years ago, great things were ex
pected from him on the soccer field.
After all, in high school in Montclair,
N.J., Nadler was twice chosen to the
all-state team for his offensive playmak
ing and scoring.
And even though Coach Sam Koch
had never seen him play before, Nadler's
reputation on the East Coast was
enough to convince Koch to pursue him.
Ironically, Nadler has not excelled on
the soccer field where he was supposed
to. Instead, he has shone off the field
as an active participant in community
service activities.
Last year, Nadler volunteered for two
programs — as a tutor for the Academic
Resource Center and as a Big Brother
in the Ravenswood Community Out
reach project. He drew rave reviews for
both performances.
Dandr£ Desandies, who is the coordi
nator of both of these services, is full
of admiration for Nadler. "His involve
ment in the organizations has been
amazing," Desandies said. "He has al
ways been there, maintaining the rela
tionships that are crucial to the success
of the groups. He has shown himself to
be a very solid, responsible guy."
Koch also has lauded his player. "His
activities off the field have impressed
me a great deal," Koch said. "I am
proud of him for them."
Nadler's activities on the field, how
ever, have not been as spectacular.
In fact, Nadler's freshman year was
a miyor disappointment both for he and
Koch. "I was a big star in the East
during high school, and I just figured
that things would be the same in col
lege," Nadler said. "So, before my fresh

year. He has tremendous talent and ability, and
there are times when he can just do terrific
things on the field.'

man year, I didn't work real hard, and
that hurt, because I soon found out I
wasn't as good as I thought I was."
Koch didn't tbink he was that good
either. Nadler cfyickly fell into the
coach's "doghouse, not playing much
his first year. During his sophomore
year, Nadler began to show glimmers
of the brilliance which made him a high
school star. In what is probably his
greatest moment in collegiate soccer so
far, he scored the winning goal in the
Cardinal's 1988 emotion-packed 1-0 vic
tory against the University of San Fran
cisco.
In 1989, although he was still not the
success he was expected to be, Nadler
developed into an integral part of the
team.
"He has come a long way since his
freshman year," Koch said. "He has
tremendous talent and ability, and there
are times when he can just do terrific
things on the field."
Nadler explained the key to his recent
success. "I have a really good knowledge
of the game and know where to be at
all times. I'm not a really good dribbler
or technically-great player, but I'm a
good athlete and just know what to do
on the field."
Koch agrees with that assessment but
also sees Nadler's aggressive nature as
one of his strengths. "He's a tenacious

little 'bugger' who makes things happen.
He's one of those guys who'll stick his
face in front of the ball to block it if
he needs to."
Despite all his talent, Nadler is still
in Koch's disfavor as the two do not
agree on many things. "Evan Nadler is
his own boss, and that doesn't go too
well with me," Koch said. "In addition,
he is the opposite type of player that I
was, so I have a hard time dealing with
some of the things he does."
However, Koch feels the two have
"learned to put up with each other, and
now respect one another."
Nadler added, "I've grown up now
and have become more mature, so I
have changed as a soccer player and as
a person. My attitude has really changed
since my freshman year."
Indeed, he believes the main thing
holding him back from playing well two
years ago was his attitude. "My skills
were comparable to the other players,
but my mind-set wasn't, so I couldn't
succeed."
Playing the game of soccer never was
a problem for Nadler. He has excelled
in the sport since the age of eight. He
reminisced about how he first got in
volved in the game. "My parents didn't

want me to play football, so I
played soccer instead. I liked it
and was good at it, so I continued
to play and haven't stopped yet."
A couple weeks before school
started this fall, however, he did
stop playing and missed a game.
The reason? Nadler was busy
taking on an even bigger challenge
— the MCATs, the medical school
equivalent of the SAT.
Like playing soccer for a
college team, Nadler, who is
msyoring in biology, always has
dreamed of being a doctor and
hopes that someday he will ac
complish his goal. In fact, realiz
ing that he won't be playing soccer
for the rest of his life, he decided
that "soccer is just a bonus, some
thing I just love to do."
Something else he seems to love
to do is to help out others who
have not been as fortunate as he.
"I feel lucky to have had such an
easy life, and I just want to give
something back to other people,"
he said.
As a tutor in the ARC study-hall

program, Nadler helps other ath
letes — who the program is de
signed to aid — with any academic
problems they may have. In the
Ravenswood project, he visits his
"little brother" and does things
with him for about five to 10
hours a week.
His volunteer work has changed
his attitude about soccer. "It's
great to score a goal, but to make
someone else feel good, like
they've scored a goal, now that's
even better."
Koch is proud of Nadler's com
mitment to community service, es
pecially because of the battles the
two have had on the field. "I'm
proud of anyone who does it —
volunteer work," Koch said. "But
I'm really proud that he, that
Evan Nadler, is doing it, and I
respect him for that."
Indeed, the fact that he is not
a soccer star anymore is no longer
important to Nadler. "I know that
I'm not as special an athlete as I
used to be, but this other stuff I
do — the community service —
makes me feel special alsc. Right
now, I'd rather be known as Evan
Nadler, the guy who does com
munity service, than as Evan
Nadler the soccer player."

he is the opposite type of player that I
was, so I have a hard time dealing with
some of the things he does."
However, Koch feels the two have
"learned to put up with each other, and
now respect one another."
Nadler added, "I've grown up now
and have become more mature, so I
have changed as a soccer player and as
a person. My attitude has really changed
since my freshman year."
Indeed, he believes the main thing
holding him back from playing well two
years ago was his attitude. "My skills
were comparable to the other players,
but my mind-set wasn't, so I couldn't
succeed."
Playing the game of soccer never was
a problem for Nadler. He has excelled
in the sport since the age of eight. He
reminisced about how he first got in
volved in the game. "My parents didn't

want me to play football, so I
played soccer instead. I liked it
and was good at it, so I continued
to play and haven't stopped yet."
A couple weeks before school
started this fall, however, he did
stop playing and missed a game.
The reason? Nadler was busy
taking on an even bigger challenge
— the MCATs, the medical school
equivalent of the SAT.
Like playing soccer for a
college team, Nadler, who is
msyoring in biology, always has
dreamed of being a doctor and
hopes that someday he will ac
complish his goal. In fact, realiz
ing that he won't be playing soccer
for the rest of his life, he decided
that "soccer is just a bonus, some
thing I just love to do."
Something else he seems to love
to do is to help out others who
have not been as fortunate as he.
"I feel lucky to have had such an
easy life, and I just want to give
something back to other people,"
he said.
As a tutor in the ARC study-hall

program, Nadler helps other ath
letes — who the program is de
signed to aid — with any academic
problems they may have. In the
Ravenswood project, he visits his
"little brother" and does things
with him for about five to 10
hours a week.
His volunteer work has changed
his attitude about soccer. "It's
great to score a goal, but to make
someone else feel good, like
they've scored a goal, now that's
even better."
Koch is proud of Nadler's com
mitment to community service, es
pecially because of the battles the
two have had on the field. "I'm
proud of anyone who does it —
volunteer work," Koch said. "But
I'm really proud that he, that
Evan Nadler, is doing it, and I
respect him for that."
Indeed, the fact that he is not
a soccer star anymore is no longer
important to Nadler. "I know that
I'm not as special an athlete as I
used to be, but this other stuff I
do — the community service —
makes me feel special alsc. Right
now, I'd rather be known as Evan
Nadler, the guy who does com
munity service, than as Evan
Nadler the soccer player."
When Evan Nadler came to Stanford
three years ago, great things were ex
pected from him on the soccer field.
After all, in high school in Montclair,
N.J., Nadler was twice chosen to the
all-state team for his offensive playmak
ing and scoring.
And even though Coach Sam Koch
had never seen him play before, Nadler's
reputation on the East Coast was
enough to convince Koch to pursue him.
Ironically, Nadler has not excelled on
the soccer field where he was supposed
to. Instead, he has shone off the field
as an active participant in community
service activities.
Last year, Nadler volunteered for two
programs — as a tutor for the Academic
Resource Center and as a Big Brother
in the Ravenswood Community Out
reach project. He drew rave reviews for
both performances.
Dandr£ Desandies, who is the coordi
nator of both of these services, is full
of admiration for Nadler. "His involve
ment in the organizations has been
amazing," Desandies said. "He has al
ways been there, maintaining the rela
tionships that are crucial to the success
of the groups. He has shown himself to
be a very solid, responsible guy."
Koch also has lauded his player. "His
activities off the field have impressed
me a great deal," Koch said. "I am
proud of him for them."
Nadler's activities on the field, how
ever, have not been as spectacular.
In fact, Nadler's freshman year was
a miyor disappointment both for he and
Koch. "I was a big star in the East
during high school, and I just figured
that things would be the same in col
lege," Nadler said. "So, before my fresh

'He has come a long way since his freshman
year. He has tremendous talent and ability, and
there are times when he can just do terrific
things on the field.'

man year, I didn't work real hard, and
that hurt, because I soon found out I
wasn't as good as I thought I was."
Koch didn't tbink he was that good
either. Nadler cfyickly fell into the
coach's "doghouse, not playing much
his first year. During his sophomore
year, Nadler began to show glimmers
of the brilliance which made him a high
school star. In what is probably his
greatest moment in collegiate soccer so
far, he scored the winning goal in the
Cardinal's 1988 emotion-packed 1-0 vic
tory against the University of San Fran
cisco.
In 1989, although he was still not the
success he was expected to be, Nadler
developed into an integral part of the
team.
"He has come a long way since his
freshman year," Koch said. "He has
tremendous talent and ability, and there
are times when he can just do terrific
things on the field."
Nadler explained the key to his recent
success. "I have a really good knowledge
of the game and know where to be at
all times. I'm not a really good dribbler
or technically-great player, but I'm a
good athlete and just know what to do
on the field."
Koch agrees with that assessment but
also sees Nadler's aggressive nature as
one of his strengths. "He's a tenacious

little 'bugger' who makes things happen.
He's one of those guys who'll stick his
face in front of the ball to block it if
he needs to."
Despite all his talent, Nadler is still
in Koch's disfavor as the two do not
agree on many things. "Evan Nadler is
his own boss, and that doesn't go too
well with me," Koch said. "In addition,
he is the opposite type of player that I
was, so I have a hard time dealing with
some of the things he does."
However, Koch feels the two have
