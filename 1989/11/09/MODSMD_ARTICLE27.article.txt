## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Although the Stanford men's
basketball team has yet to play
a game this season, Coach Mike
Montgomery already is plan
ning for next year.
Yesterday, Bob Patton, a 6-
foot point guard from
Youngstown, Ohio, announced
he will attend Stanford next
year. Patton became the first
player to sign a letter of intent
to Stanford during the early
signing period, which began
yesterday and runs through
next Wednesday.
The signing will not be offi
cial until Stanford receives the
letter but Montgomery said, "I
assume he signed the letter."
Patton's father coached the
World Basketball League-

Champion Youngstown Pride,
as well as his son's high school
team.
Montgomery described Pat
ton as a good ball handler who
can shoot well from the outside.
"He's like Terry (Taylor) but
maybe better athletically,"
Montgomery said.
Taylor, who graduated in
June, was the starting point
guard on last year's team that
finished the season ranked
13th nationally.
Patton averaged 17.9 points
and nine assists per game for
Liberty High School as a junior
last year.
Montgomery said he plans on
signing one more recruit but
will wait until the second sign
ing period, which takes place
after this year's basketball
season.
