Following the ASSU Sunday
Flicks' showing of the film "Do
the Right Thing," the ASSU Com
mittee on Democracy in Educa
tion did what it thought was right.
On Monday, it began a series of
discussions across campus about
the themes of the movie.
Director-writer Spike Lee's film
sparked both commentary and
controversy this summer. In its
depiction of a racially tense Brook
lyn neighborhood, the film raised
many questions about how to im
prove race relations.
But many viewers felt Lee's
third major film raised more ques
tions than it answered, leaving
people confused and angered as a
result.
In response, CODE decided last
week to hold the discussion series,

said co-chair Hillary Skillings.
The discussions are co-sponsored
by the Black Student Union.
"People have really strong re
actions to ['Do the Right Thing'],"
Skillings said. "That's why I think
it's important for them to get to
gether to talk about it."
Many students said they
thought the dorm discussions
helped them better appreciate the
movie's complexities.
"The film's power lies in letting
viewers draw their own conclu
sions," said senior Diane Bisgeier.
But the discussion "brought out
some of the issues that it's going
to take an organizational effort
to change," she added.
David Brown, a member of the
Council of Presidents, said he was
glad he attended a session Monday
in Mirlo Lounge. "It renewed my
faith that people feel these issues
need to be addressed," he said.

Some students said they enjoyed
examining the film from new per
spectives through the discussions.
"I'm from New York City, and
I'm in the middle of it (racial
controversy)," said Noel Maurer,
an undeclared sophomore. "It's
too easy for me not to think about
my own behavior."
Maurer said that though he
came to the discussion looking for
answers to the questions of race
relations, he said he left with "the
feeling that no one else from any
other part of the country knows
either."
The discussions are also in
tended to provide an avenue for
understanding race relations.
CODE has already held five of
the seven planned forums in
various residences across campus.
The final two will be held today
at Adelfa House at 5:30 p.m. and
at Lathrop House at 5:45 p.m.
