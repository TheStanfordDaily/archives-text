# Anti-drug law will not jeopardize Stanford aid
## 
### Ari Richter 
Although some colleges have
had trouble with a new federal
law tying their anti-drug policies
to federal financial aid sources,
Stanford seems to be in the clear.
There was concern at Tulane
University over the possibility
that current federal funding, com
prising 30 percent of the financial
aid given out by the school, might
be in jeopardy, according to The
Tulane Hullabaloo, the campus
newspaper.
On Nov. 18, 1988, Congress
passed the "Drug-Free Workplace
Act of 1988," requiring all em
ployers who receive federal fund
ing to certify that their workplace
is drug-free.
In response, Stanford's Univer
sity Administrative Council pub
lished the "Stanford University
Controlled Substance Policy,"
which went into effect on March

18, 1989, and applies to all Stan
ford employees.
Stanford receives federal grants
which account for approximately
25 percent of all undergraduate
financial aid packages.
According to Robert Huff, di
rector of Financial Aids, that
funding is not in jeopardy because
the University does maintain a
drug-free environment as well as
adequate drug abuse programs
and counseling facilities, enabling
it to certify compliance with the
federal government's new guide
lines.
C. Fredrick Bentley, director of
the Sponsored Projects Office,
who signed the letter, said it "cer
tifies that we have a policy that
dictates a drug-free workplace,"
one in which, as the policy states,
"The unlawful manufacture, dis
tribution, dispensation, posses
sion, [or] use of controlled sub
stances ... is prohibited."
