# Bonfire's flame of hope dies out
## Reasons for not pursuing plan include lack of time and money

Despite hopes earlier this week that
the 1989 Big Game bonfire would hap
pen after all, the Axe Committee decided
last night that the event will definitely
be canceled.
The bonfire was originally axed due
to a lack of funds. In two separate elec
tions last spring, the Axe Committee
failed to garner enough student votes
to receive its proposed fee request from
the ASSU.
The event was reconsidered after the
Council of Presidents discussed reinstat
ing the bonfire at a meeting Tuesday
with University President Donald Ken
nedy. But the committee has determined
it is "not feasible to put on a bonfire
this year," Axe Committee Chair Pat
Broun said last night.
With leas than two weeks to go before

Big Game, time was a consider
ation in the decision, Broun said. The
bonfire is traditionally held the Thurs
day before the game. "The idea of put
ting it together in eight days was a
scary thought to me," he said.
If someone got hurt at a bonfire or
ganized so quickly, it is "unlikely there
ever would be a bonfire again," Broun
said.
Aside from safety issues, the commit
tee did not have a firm commitment on
funding for the event. The Axe Com
mittee had received a pledge from a
corporate sponsor, several donations
from alumni and support from the
ASSU senate, but the money was not
enough to meet the full $12,000 cost
of the bonfire, Broun said.
To stage the event, the committee
would have needed at least an additional
$2,000 from dorms and $1,500 from

other campus organizations, he added.
While COP member David Brown said
he is confident the money would have
come through, Broun said he was "more
skeptical" about raising the funds in so
short a time.
Both Brown and Broun noted that
the Oct. 17 earthquake played a part
in the committee's decision.
Much of the equipment necessary for
the bonfire is being used for quake
relief. "It would be hard to justify the
use of machinery (for the bonfire) after
the earthquake," Brown said.
Members of the Axe Committee spoke
at dorm meetings last night to explain
the reasons for their decision.
Broun said he thinks students "will
be upset that there's not a bonfire" and
"probably will be more receptive to
voting yes" for the Axe Committee's fee
request this spring.
