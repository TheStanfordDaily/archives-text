THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

Editor's note: The three students in this article were
selected by members of the Stanford performing arts
faculty to represent the arts of dance, music and
acting.

Stanford has an international reputation as a sci
ence and research institution, but many students
here sparkle even though they follow the road less
traveled and pursue interests in the fine arts.
Some students have even been able to meet the
academic demands of the University and still shine
as performing artists.
Corey Davis, a dancer and choreographer, Luis
Gasser, a guitarist and lutist, and Gina Schmeling,
an actress, are three individuals who manage to shine
in and out of the classroom.
Davis, a junior in drama, created and performed
in"America: Countdown to Liberation," a provocative
dance-theater production held earlier this week as
part of Stanford's Dance Week celebration.
" 'America' deals with racial stereotypes and how
they have been used to oppress black people," Davis
said.
"On the surface, things seem fine and a lot of
people may wonder where 'Amenca' is coming from,"
Davis added. "But things are not fine."
Davis wrote a version of "America" last spring for
a class called "Dance and Live Art in the 20tn
Century" and performed it for the first time last June.
"I got the idea for the performance two summers
ago when I was listening to Public Enemy's 'Show
'Em What You Got,' " Davis explained.
Compared to the performance last summer, Davis
said the performances this week were "more active
and, in a sense, more brutal."
Though "Amenca" was Davis' first big project, he
has also danced in the Kuumba Dance Ensemble
since last year.
Unlike Davis who has just begun his artistic career,
Luis Gasser, a 38-year-old graduate student in music
from Barcelona, Spain, has already made his mark
on the world.
Gasser has composed music which has been per
formed in Germany, Spain and the United States.
He has also written a book on avant-garde and
modern music.
Gasser tells an interesting tale about his musical
roots.
"I started playing guitar to get closer to a beautiful
woman who I saw playing it when I was 13," Gasser
said. "I wasn't really trying to get close to her. I was
trying to emulate her."
After that, Gasser developed an interest in the lute
because of its "wide repertoire," he explained. "The
guitar has some nice pieces, but the quality of its
repertoire is not as high as that of the lute."
Gasser revived interest in the lute at the conser
vatory in Barcelona where he teaches. The conser
vatory became the first in Spain to offer such in
struction. Since Gasser set the trend, at least two
other conservatories in Spain have picked up on it.
Though he has studied music all over Europe and
has been teaching and working as a music critic for
the past 14 years, Gasser said he likes life at Stanford.
He is in the second year of a three-year program,
and relishes the opportunity to study and take ad
vantage of the University's library material on lute
music of the Renaissance and baroque periods.
"I am very aware of what I want to do and I have
spent much of my time here in libraries," Gasser
said. "When I was in Barcelona, I was too busy
teaching and wnting articles for newspapers and
magazines to study."
This penchant for study is common to Gasser,
Davis and Schmeling. While Davis received a research
grant and wrote a 100-page paper exploring the lack
of involvement in American theater by black people,
Schmeling, a senior in drama, is currently working
on her humanities honors thesis in which she aims
to analyze Molly Bloom of fames Joyce's "Ulysses"
as the representation of a female consciousness by
a male author.
Schmeling said she has been interested in Joyce
ever since she took a class on "Ulysses" during her
senior year in high school.
During her sophomore year, Schmeling tned her
hand at writing and composed a Winter One Act.
She said she prefers acting to writing, however.
"I find acting easier," Schmeling said. "I don't

know much about writing."
For Schmeling, acting does seem to be easier. She
has performed in shows during all except for three
quarters while here at Stanford and she has acted in
Stanford's Summer Theater program for the past two
years. Her most recent major role was the title role
in "Antigone" last spring. But she also has performed
in a long list of shows at Stanford and at her high
school in the Chicago area.
"Everyone who acts says their high school program
was really different, but mine really was," Schmeling
said. "We got to work a lot with professionals."
Unlike many parents, Schmeling said hers did not
discourage from going into acting.
During her senior year of high school, Schmeling

auditioned for the chair of Stanford's Drama Depart
ment in response to a nationwide talent search held
by the University. She said the audition went well
and the chair's recommendation may have helped
her chances of getting into Stanford.
Now, her main goal is to get into a master's of
fine arts program â€” and for that, she has to keep
going through auditions.
"I am applying to a few different programs, but
I'm thinking more about what city I want to be in
than what program," Schmeling said.
While auditioning is a lot of work, Schmeling said
she has enjoyed the performances she has been in
volved in at Stanford.
Schmeling said she enjoyed playing a modern, rebel
lious Antigone in black leather pants. She also enjoyed
her roles in"The Normal Heart," a play about a
person with AIDS and a one-woman show by Berthold
Brecht called "The lewish Wife," which she performed
in over the summer.
"Sometimes it's hard to balance work and school,
but I bring books with me to rehearsals and study
or sleep between scenes," Schmeling said. "In 'The
Normal Heart' I slept for 45 minutes offstage between
my scenes."
Schmeling said she plans to act out some of Joyce's
shorter works on the stage this spnng if she gets
some time.
"Joyce himself loved to hear his works read aloud,"
Schmeling said. "He used to have his daughter-in-law
read them to him. It would be great to act them out."
Gasser will also be showing his stuff soon. On
Nov. 16 at 8 p.m., he will be playing 17th century
French and Italian lute music in the Campbell Recital
Hall.
"The music was the avant garde music of that
period," Gasser explained. "Certain rules were broken
and the results are very interesting."
Though the"America" performances are over,
Davis plans to continue dancing in the Kuumba
Dance Ensemble this year.
