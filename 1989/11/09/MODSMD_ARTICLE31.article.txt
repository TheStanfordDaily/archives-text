# Uncovering the truth behind Stanford's discreet, brown paper wrapper
## 
### 
Every once in a while I get letters from
people who wish I would write more about
Stanford issues. For example:
Dear Andrew,
Is that your real hair!
— A fan
And also:
Dear Customer.
We have received your order from the
"Intimate Orifices" catalog and are rush
ing the requested products to you in a
discreet, brown paper wrapper. A wrapper
which is so discreet it might as well scream
out to your neighbors: "PERVERTED
SEXUAL MATERIAL ENCLOSED!!"
\bu'U probably have to move.
— Catalog Dep't
So as you can see, it is clearly time for
me to offer five suggestions for improving
Stanford, starting with:
(1) ELIMINATE CRYPTIC EMPLOY
MENT ADS. Firms advertising in The
Daily should be required to explain what
they actually do. There are too many ads
like this:

Porkman & Gumbysnorter (an Equally
Opportunistic Employer) are extremely
pleased to invite
ALL SENIORS
to an orientation meeting to find out
about
CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN
Investment Hanking, Management Con
sulting. Strategy Analyzing, Investment
Consulting. Strategy Banking, Manage
ment Analyzing. Stratified Embalming,
Sexual Healing. Maniacal Parading and
Parakeet Sautding.
Thursday, Nov. 9, Stanford Motor Lodge.
7 p.m. 8.Y.0.R. No freaks.
If we had a truth-in-advertising law on
campus, the ad would read like this:
Porkman Gumbysnorter (we don't
hire vegetarians) are extremely amused
to invite
ALL SENIORS
to a schmoozy gathering that will
resemble a sorority rush party to find out
about
JORS YOU AREN 'T QUALIFIED FOR IN
New York, which is just like any other
city in the United States except that apart
ments cost $750 jillion dollars, meaning

that you'll end up living in a cramped,
one-bedroom apartment with
COCKROACHES
and working as an Investment Bank Teller
until you throw yourself in front of a
SUBWAY TRAIN
12) A BETTER BONFIRE. The Axe
Committee wants to spend $12,000 for a
bonfire, including $1,500 for insurance.
Get real! Here's a much better solution:
Let's bum Columbac! The flames will be
even bigger than the usual bonfire; they're
probably going to tear it down anyway,
and if we make it look like an accident,
we'll COLLECT the fire insurance on the
place.
Then we can torch Synergy and Phi Psi
It'll be a progressive.
(3) HOUSING FOR STANFORD'S
EARTHQUAKE REFUGEES. Of course,
after burning down the Row, we'll need
somewhere to put the refugees. Why not
in the ASSU offices'
The ASSU has three main functions:
• Take students' money away.
• Give students their money back.
• Appropriate funds to purchase things
that come in discreet, plain brown wrap-

pers.
I think we could free up a considerable
amount of space in the ASSU offices if
we all pledged to take our own money
away from ourselves and then give it back.
I, for one, would even promise to check
my student ID carefully to make sure I
was not refunding my money to myself
more than once.
This plan would eliminate the middle
man, rendering the ASSU obsolete. I bet
we could have the ASSU offices in the
Draw by spring quarter.
(4) ACADEMIC SUCCESS EVALUA

TION. Since the SAT was so important
for getting into Stanford, let's see what
scores our seniors can get if they take the
SAT after they graduate.
Anyone getting a lower score than when
they originally applied to Stanford should
get a tuition refund.
(5) ENDING CAMPUS RACISM. For
bidding the Band from playing an acoustic
version of "Paradise City" is just a start.
Next, let's ban classes.
After all, most classes arc held in the
Quad, which is also where the English
Department has its offices. The English
Department, of course, teaches about
Mark Twain, who wrote many books
about life on the Mississippi. And Mis
sissippi was the setting for last year's
movie "Mississippi Burning," which had
many racists in it.
Heck, holding classes is probably a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard. If you
sec one being held, you should immedi
ately occupy President Kennedy's office
Preferably while wearing discreet, plain
brown clotning

TIPS ON ADULTHOOD
Every once in a while I get letters from
people who wish I would write more about
Stanford issues. For example:
Dear Andrew,
Is that your real hair!
— A fan
And also:
Dear Customer.
We have received your order from the
"Intimate Orifices" catalog and are rush
ing the requested products to you in a
discreet, brown paper wrapper. A wrapper
which is so discreet it might as well scream
out to your neighbors: "PERVERTED
SEXUAL MATERIAL ENCLOSED!!"
\bu'U probably have to move.
— Catalog Dep't
So as you can see, it is clearly time for
me to offer five suggestions for improving
Stanford, starting with:
(1) ELIMINATE CRYPTIC EMPLOY
MENT ADS. Firms advertising in The
Daily should be required to explain what
they actually do. There are too many ads
like this:

Porkman & Gumbysnorter (an Equally
Opportunistic Employer) are extremely
pleased to invite
ALL SENIORS
to an orientation meeting to find out
about
CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN
Investment Hanking, Management Con
sulting. Strategy Analyzing, Investment
Consulting. Strategy Banking, Manage
ment Analyzing. Stratified Embalming,
Sexual Healing. Maniacal Parading and
Parakeet Sautding.
Thursday, Nov. 9, Stanford Motor Lodge.
7 p.m. 8.Y.0.R. No freaks.
If we had a truth-in-advertising law on
campus, the ad would read like this:
Porkman Gumbysnorter (we don't
hire vegetarians) are extremely amused
to invite
ALL SENIORS
to a schmoozy gathering that will
resemble a sorority rush party to find out
about
JORS YOU AREN 'T QUALIFIED FOR IN
New York, which is just like any other
city in the United States except that apart
ments cost $750 jillion dollars, meaning

that you'll end up living in a cramped,
one-bedroom apartment with
COCKROACHES
and working as an Investment Bank Teller
until you throw yourself in front of a
SUBWAY TRAIN
12) A BETTER BONFIRE. The Axe
Committee wants to spend $12,000 for a
bonfire, including $1,500 for insurance.
Get real! Here's a much better solution:
Let's bum Columbac! The flames will be
even bigger than the usual bonfire; they're
probably going to tear it down anyway,
and if we make it look like an accident,
we'll COLLECT the fire insurance on the
place.
Then we can torch Synergy and Phi Psi
It'll be a progressive.
(3) HOUSING FOR STANFORD'S
EARTHQUAKE REFUGEES. Of course,
after burning down the Row, we'll need
somewhere to put the refugees. Why not
in the ASSU offices'
The ASSU has three main functions:
• Take students' money away.
• Give students their money back.
• Appropriate funds to purchase things
that come in discreet, plain brown wrap-

pers.
I think we could free up a considerable
amount of space in the ASSU offices if
we all pledged to take our own money
away from ourselves and then give it back.
I, for one, would even promise to check
my student ID carefully to make sure I
was not refunding my money to myself
more than once.
This plan would eliminate the middle
man, rendering the ASSU obsolete. I bet
we could have the ASSU offices in the
Draw by spring quarter.
(4) ACADEMIC SUCCESS EVALUA

TION. Since the SAT was so important
for getting into Stanford, let's see what
scores our seniors can get if they take the
SAT after they graduate.
Anyone getting a lower score than when
they originally applied to Stanford should
get a tuition refund.
(5) ENDING CAMPUS RACISM. For
bidding the Band from playing an acoustic
version of "Paradise City" is just a start.
Next, let's ban classes.
After all, most classes arc held in the
Quad, which is also where the English
Department has its offices. The English
Department, of course, teaches about
Mark Twain, who wrote many books
about life on the Mississippi. And Mis
sissippi was the setting for last year's
movie "Mississippi Burning," which had
many racists in it.
Heck, holding classes is probably a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard. If you
sec one being held, you should immedi
ately occupy President Kennedy's office
