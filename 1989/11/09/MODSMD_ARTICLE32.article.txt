Lute is mightier than sword
"Trial by Jury," the latest Stanford Savoyards production, opens
this Friday at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. See Stanford
Law School Graduate Tyler Ochoa as Edwin, the lute-wielding
defendant, fend off a "breach of promise of marriage" charge.
"Trial by Jury" will be followed by Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi,"
the story of a greedy family trying to reclaim the legacy of a
deceased wealthy relative. Admission is $7.50, or $5 for stu
dents and seniors. The show runs this weekend and next.
