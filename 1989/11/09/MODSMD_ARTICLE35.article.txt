# Indigo Girls warm with 'Fire'
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
Soon after the release of their
self-titled first album, the Indigo
Girls garnered widespread critical
acclaim for their unique lyrical and
vocal style.
And with the recent release of
their next album, "Strange Fire,"
the duo proves the critics right —
their style is definitely unique.
"Strange Fire" is not actually a
new album, but a compilation of
previously released material. With
the exception of "Land of Canaan,"
a track re-recorded for "Indigo
Girls," "Strange Fire" is comprised
of nine "new" tracks recorded be
tween 1985 and 1987. And, like
the early works of many artists,
this album reveals a more basic,
less refined musical style.
Similar to their last album, the
vocals and harmonies of Amy Ray
and Emily Saliers weave in and
out of each other like an intricate
tapestry. But on many of the tracks
of "Strange Fire," however, one of
the two will take control of the
vocals and sing solo, unobscured
by background vocals or other in
struments.
Ironically, this stylistic tech

mque displays the strength of one
of the women, while it also reveals
the weakness of the other member.
In "Hey Jesus," a song questioning
religious faith during stages of ro
mantic depression, Saliers' vocals
are supported only by a background
acoustic guitar.
She conveys a sense of intimacy
that complements the song's emo
tional, desperate lyrics extremely
well."/ don't really think it's
fair/You've got the power to make
us all believe in you/And then we
call on you in our despair/And you
don't come through.
Conversely, the rough, raspy
voice of Ray often grates when
unaccompanied. On the title track,
her voice fails to mesh with the
song's lyrics, which describe an of
fering of love.
The song falters until Ray's
stinging vocals are saved by Saliers'
soothing accompaniment. How
ever, Ray's vocal style is successful
on other tracks.
"Strange Fire" also shows the
duo's incredible depth and ability.
Saliers' haunting vocals on "Left
Me A Fool" turn a remorseful,
depressing song into a beautiful,
sentimental ballad that is perhaps
the album's best track.

On "Crazy Game," the
musicians combine a jazzy tempo
with a flute accompaniment, cre
ating a surprisingly blues-style air.
And in "Make It Easier," a spirited
plea for assistance from a
downtrodden soul, Indigo Girls
bombard the listener with a
fusillade of vivid metaphors.
"Strange Fire" is an interesting
look into the past of Indigo Girls.
Although some of the album dis
plays the duo's musical im
maturity, most of the album serves
to highlight the lyrical and musical
strength of the group. Musically
and lyrically, the Indigo Girls are
impressive, even at this stage of
development.
Don't be discouraged by the al
bum's "Previously Released" stick
er; "Strange Fire" is as fitting a
sequel as it is a predecessor. Per
haps this paradox is exactly what
makes Indigo Girls so unique.

The Indigo Girls, presented by the
Stanford Concert Network, will ap
pear in concert Saturday, Dec. 9
at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
Tickets go on sale at the Tresidder
Ticket Office tomorrow. Reserved
seating tickets are $12.50, or $10

Sun sets and 'Don' rises
When the sun sets next Wednesday night, "Don of the Dead," will
rise from the murky blackness in Memorial Auditorium. That's right,
it's time once again for Gaieties, the annual Ram's Head Big Game
musical. And it's not too late to buy tickets, which cost $6 for each
of the three performances next Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights
at 7 p.m. They are on sale this week and next in White Plaza from
11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Many good seats are still available for the opening
night performance, as well as Thursday and Friday's shows, although
they're selling fast. Don't be left in the dark. Buy your tickets and see
the "Don."

Soon after the release of their
self-titled first album, the Indigo
Girls garnered widespread critical
acclaim for their unique lyrical and
vocal style.
And with the recent release of
their next album, "Strange Fire,"
the duo proves the critics right —
their style is definitely unique.
"Strange Fire" is not actually a
new album, but a compilation of
previously released material. With
the exception of "Land of Canaan,"
a track re-recorded for "Indigo
Girls," "Strange Fire" is comprised
of nine "new" tracks recorded be
tween 1985 and 1987. And, like
the early works of many artists,
this album reveals a more basic,
less refined musical style.
Similar to their last album, the
vocals and harmonies of Amy Ray
and Emily Saliers weave in and
out of each other like an intricate
tapestry. But on many of the tracks
of "Strange Fire," however, one of
the two will take control of the
vocals and sing solo, unobscured
by background vocals or other in
struments.
Ironically, this stylistic tech

mque displays the strength of one
of the women, while it also reveals
the weakness of the other member.
In "Hey Jesus," a song questioning
religious faith during stages of ro
mantic depression, Saliers' vocals
are supported only by a background
acoustic guitar.
She conveys a sense of intimacy
that complements the song's emo
tional, desperate lyrics extremely
well."/ don't really think it's
fair/You've got the power to make
us all believe in you/And then we
call on you in our despair/And you
don't come through.
Conversely, the rough, raspy
voice of Ray often grates when
unaccompanied. On the title track,
her voice fails to mesh with the
song's lyrics, which describe an of
fering of love.
The song falters until Ray's
stinging vocals are saved by Saliers'
soothing accompaniment. How
ever, Ray's vocal style is successful
on other tracks.
"Strange Fire" also shows the
duo's incredible depth and ability.
Saliers' haunting vocals on "Left
Me A Fool" turn a remorseful,
depressing song into a beautiful,
sentimental ballad that is perhaps
the album's best track.

On "Crazy Game," the
musicians combine a jazzy tempo
with a flute accompaniment, cre
ating a surprisingly blues-style air.
And in "Make It Easier," a spirited
plea for assistance from a
downtrodden soul, Indigo Girls
bombard the listener with a
fusillade of vivid metaphors.
"Strange Fire" is an interesting
look into the past of Indigo Girls.
Although some of the album dis
plays the duo's musical im
maturity, most of the album serves
to highlight the lyrical and musical
strength of the group. Musically
and lyrically, the Indigo Girls are
impressive, even at this stage of
development.
Don't be discouraged by the al
bum's "Previously Released" stick
er; "Strange Fire" is as fitting a
sequel as it is a predecessor. Per
haps this paradox is exactly what
makes Indigo Girls so unique.

The Indigo Girls, presented by the
Stanford Concert Network, will ap
pear in concert Saturday, Dec. 9
at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
Tickets go on sale at the Tresidder
Ticket Office tomorrow. Reserved
