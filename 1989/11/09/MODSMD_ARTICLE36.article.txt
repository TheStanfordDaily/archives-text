# 'Second Sight' is second rate
## 
### Brad Bruner 
In mid-Autumn and after the
Christmas holidays I am often re
luctant to shell out the perfunctory
big bucks for the type of films that
are inevitably released. These "off
season" periods are the perfect op
portunity for the big movie
companies to get out all the
schlock that they were basically
embarrassed to release during any
of their "quality" months.
A prime schlock postponement
that has now descended upon us
is Lorimar's new "Second Sight."
John Larroquette (TV's "Night
Court") plays Wills, the private
detective who owns the Second
Sight Detective Agency. Wills is
not exactly a favorite of the local
police chief, who must neverthe
less secure his service again and
again because of the effectiveness

of Wills' secret weapon.
This weapon of sorts is Bobby
the Psychic (Bronson Pinchot,
TV's "Perfect Strangers"), a
lightning-struck victim who, de
spite being able to absorb every bit
of psychic output within any
metropolitan area, still registers at
about as high-voltage as a transis
tor radio.
Rounding out the random group
of central characters are Preston
Pritchett, Ph.D. (Stuart Pankin),
Bobby's anal-retentive keeper, and
Elizabeth the nun (Bess
Armstrong).
As the less-than-fab foui at
tempt to track down a stolen car,
they accidentally stumble onto a
plot (arguably the only plot present
in this film) to kidnap a certain
Catholic Cardinal who is about to
become the first American Pope.
Although Pinchot's Bobby does

bring occasional wacky zest to this
muddled cardboard excuse for a
real film, even he quickly becomes
predictable and annoying.
Yes, there's a runaway car scene.
Yes, there are plenty of one-liners
that could have spawned from
either "Night Court" or "Perfect
Strangers" (and probably would
have been more effective had they
been confined there). Yes, there's
a picture of Shirley MacLaine over
Bobby's bed.
And yes, almost every aspect of
this film is so bad, from the over
bearing soundtrack that sounds
like it's borrowed from afternoon
cartoons to the incredibly stereo
typical acting.
"Second Sight" will be finding
its way onto the late night TV film
circuit very soon. Until that time
— and maybe even afterwards —
the best advice is to avoid it.
