# Two sides of academic life

"The ivory tower is in shambles," re
marks Niles Harris regarding the univer
sity where he is a professor of art and
history. "Angels Fall," an incisive play by
Lanford Wilson, considers the over
whelming, arbitrary dogma that Harris
perceives in academia, and widens its
scope to consider other related themes.
An accident at a nearby uranium mine
brings a traveling Harris — who has just
left his university post — together with
the rest of the cast to a crumbling mission
in the New Mexico desert.
When the roads close because of the
accident, Harris (Tom Chase) and his
wife Vita (Kristine Bray) are on their way
to a clinic to seek treament for his ner
vous breakdown. Marion Clay, a widow
played by Audrey Shimkas, is on her way
to a tennis tournament with her young
lover Zappy Zapalla (Ken Marshall).
The two couples meet mission resident
Don Tabaha (Rick Colby), a bitter, Native
American doctor, who yearns to take a

prestigious research position at Berkeley,
despite the wishes of the tribe's priest,
Father William Doherty. Played by Fred
erick August, Doherty wants Tabaha to
remain and treat their people who are
suffering from radiation poisoning.
His message to Tabaha — the central
theme of the play — is to follow your
calling, whatever it is.
Among the better performances in the
play were those of Chase as Harris, and
August as the old and slightly scat
terbrained Father Doherty
It is an especially relevant production
for the Stanford audience because it turns
a minor on intellectuals, allowing them
to examine what they value in themselves
and their fields.
And perhaps it allows them to see the
cracks in their own ivory tower — cracks
which are not the result of an earthquake.

"Angels Fall," presented by the Palo Alto
Players, is running through Nov. 18 at
the Lucie Stern Theater, 1305 Middlefield
Rd., in Palo Alto.
