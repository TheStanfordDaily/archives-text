# Webber revue haunts San Francisco
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
For the past two decades theater-goers
have been turning out in droves to hear
the latest work by Andrew Lloyd Webber.
From 1968's "Joseph and the Technicolor
Dreamcoat," to this year's "Aspects of
Love," the talented composer has been
setting and breaking his own attendance
records.
Last Wednesday "The Music of
Andrew Lloyd Webber in Concert"
opened at the Golden Gate Theater in
San Francisco. The evening was filled
with highlights from eight of Webber's
11 musicals, and proceeds went to the
Red Cross Earthquake Relief Fund.
With blockbusters like "Cats" and
"Phantom of the Opera," Webber has
become a household name. And demand
generated across the country for this
revue has limited its stay in the Bay
Area to a mere six performances.
The evening opened up with the 1971
overture to "Jesus Christ Superstar,"
which may well be Webber's best over
ture to date. He has deftly woven electric

instruments into the orchestral accom
paniment to create a modern, yet classic
sound.
The 66-piece orchestra recaptured the
original sound perfectly, although the
guitar lead tended to overwhelm, rather
than compliment the violins. This
proved a rare flaw, however, as the or
chestra and the band came together ef
fectively for the rest of the night.
Despite the common belief that Web
ber writes his own lyrics, he has yet to
put any of his own words down on the
score. The first act concentrated prima
rily on the songs that were the result of
his collaboration with lyricist Tim Rice.
The first three numbers — from
"Jesus," "Joseph" and the title song from
"Starlight Express," were performed by a
13-member ensemble. The talented sing
ers switched from lead vocals to back-up
singing effortlessly.
Aside from wanting to hear the music,
many came for the performance of Sarah
Brightman, Webber's wife of six years.
Anticipation for her performance was so
high that her ridiculously dramatic en
trance and flowing gown reminiscent of

those worn by Stevie Nicks were all but
ignored.
Her voice sounded uneven throughout
the remainder of the first act, however.
And just as I was thinking that she
would be out of work if it weren't for
her husband, she left stage, reappearing
after changing into the standard white
formal dress of Evita. After her stirring
rendition of "Don't Cry for Me, Argen
tina," I decided to give her another
chance.
And did she ever take advantage of it.
The second act consisted solely of ma
terial that she was personally attached
to — including four numbers from
"Cats," the musical that Brightman was
working on when she met her husband.
The evening ended wih the perfect song
for Brightman to perform — "I Don't
Know How to Love Him," from "Jesus
Christ Superstar." Originally intended for
Mary Magdalene to sing to Jesus, it took
on new meaning as a message from
Brightman to Webber. And at least she
proved that it wasn't just love that won
her the part.
