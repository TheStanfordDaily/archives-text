# Leaving no turn unstoned, album shows Dead 'Built to Last’
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
Forget about classics like
"American Beauty" and "Working
man's Dead."
Instead, open your mind and
ears to the Grateful Dead's new
release, "Built to Last," because
the only thing "Built to Last" has
in common with the past Dead
albums is that it is filled with one
great song after another.
The Dead have lost their psy
chedelic '60s edge. They've dis
carded their early '70s country
twang. They've choked out any
remainder of their late '70s disco
sound, and have concentrated in
stead on straightforward, almost
pop rock 'n' roll.
But the Dead hasn't gone com
mercial. On the contrary, commer
cialism has gone Dead. The band
is known for moving in their own
direction, and while 1986's "Touch
of Grey" marked the band's first
Top Ten single, they managed to
keep their integrity.
And with the amount of airplay
that "Foolish Heart," the Dead's
latest single, is receiving, they
ought to be prepared for their sec
ond chart-stopper.
While the passive Dead listener
has become accustomed to vocals
by lead guitarist Jerry Garcia and

rhythm guitarist Bobby Weir,
"Built" shoves keyboardist Brent
Mydland into the spotlight.
Since he joined the band in
1979, Mydland has rarely received
the credit he deserves as both a
musician and a vocalist. On the
first two albums he recorded with
the Dead, he was given lead vocals
on only three songs. "Built" tho
roughly showcases his emotional,
high-pitched voice on four of the
album's nine tracks.
Mydland, working with lyricist
John Barlow, sounds his best on
"We Can Run," a song that says
that there really is no place to run,
because of the future generations.
"We don't own this place though
we act as if we did," the song
opens, "It belongs to the children
of our children's kid."
The argument that Mydland
sings only sappy songs is destroyed
with the very topical "We Can
Run," although his trademark
mushincss returns with "I Will
Take You Home," the album's
closing number.
And although it's definitely not
classic Dead style to close an al
bum with a lullaby to a young
daughter, be patient — a band has
as much right to change as the
listener.
But for those unwilling to
change, fear not — Jerry is still up

to his old tricks. Teaming up once
again with famed Dead lyricist
Robert Hunter, Garcia demon
strates that he is not ready to lie
down yet. Aside from "Foolish
Heart," Garcia takes center stage
on both the title track and "Stand
ing On the Moon."
Although "Standing" sounds a
bit similar to 1986's "Black Muddy
River," the song shows promise of
being the next big encore number
for the Dead to perform.
And you can't help but smile
when you hear Garcia's opening
guitar licks on "Built to Last" com
ing out of your speakers. The up
beat tempo and catchy lyrics per
fectly encompass that inexplicable
Dead sound. And the song's title
proves only one thing — from drug
busts to comas, from the deaths
of band members to '60s backlash,
the Dead will "keep on truckin'."
And if you have any doubt as
to whether this CD is worth
buying, just remember one thing
— CD remote controls were made
for a reason.
The album stands out as a col
lection of tunes strong enough to
convert the non-believer, while
maintaining the standards that the
Dead has set up over the years.
Once again, the boys in the band
have proved that they really are
"built to last."

Although the Grateful Dead may have a few more silver hairs than in past years, they haven't lost their edge
as a group. Their new album, "Built to Last," shows how they have escaped the influence of American culture,
and how they have begun setting the trends themselves.

down yet. Aside from "Foolish
Heart," Garcia takes center stage
on both the title track and "Stand
ing On the Moon."
Although "Standing" sounds a
bit similar to 1986's "Black Muddy
River," the song shows promise of
being the next big encore number
for the Dead to perform.
And you can't help but smile
when you hear Garcia's opening
guitar licks on "Built to Last" com
ing out of your speakers. The up
beat tempo and catchy lyrics per
fectly encompass that inexplicable
Dead sound. And the song's title
proves only one thing — from drug
busts to comas, from the deaths
of band members to '60s backlash,
the Dead will "keep on truckin'."
And if you have any doubt as
to whether this CD is worth
buying, just remember one thing
— CD remote controls were made
for a reason.
The album stands out as a col
lection of tunes strong enough to
convert the non-believer, while
maintaining the standards that the
Dead has set up over the years.
Once again, the boys in the band
have proved that they really are
"built to last."


A kinder, more gray-haired band? w
Although the Grateful Dead may have a few more silver hairs than in past years, they haven't lost their edge
as a group. Their new album, "Built to Last," shows how they have escaped the influence of American culture,
and how they have begun setting the trends themselves.
