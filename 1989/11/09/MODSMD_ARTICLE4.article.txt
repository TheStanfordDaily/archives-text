# Fruits of commercialization tempting, but faculty not biting

Editor's note: This is the second article
of a three-part series on the transfer of
technology from university laboratories to
private industry.

The huge success of Stanford's Office
of Technology Licensing in generating
royalties from the transfer of faculty re
search to private industry may have pro
vided an apple of temptation to
commercialize research here, but faculty
and staff are not biting.
High-technology firms that rely on
developments at Stanford, however, are
working hard to forge a "partnership"
with the University by keeping a close
eye on the work done here and its po
tential applications to their businesses.
Business leaders say that while they

look to stimulate the developmen of re
search that can lead to marketable prod
ucts, they are extremely cautious of
corrupting the main mission of a univer
sity to be independent in research aims.
Still, the pressure of hi-tech industry
to exploit and commercialize basic re
search — an especially acute pressure
here because of Stanford's lo nation in the
heart of the Silicon Valley — is 112 rongly
felt in many laboratories.
"Most things we do have poten' I mar
ket value. We know that," said illiam
Yeager of Stanford's Knowledge stems
Laboratory. Yeager developed a ct nputer

networking application now licensed by
Cisco Systems Inc. of Menlo Park.
Yet, despite the pressures to commer
cialize, researchers still hold fast to their
"environments and their commitments to
their grants," Yeager said. "Those are
the two most important things."
Researchers aim to make their labora
tory environments most amenable to per
forming research and to completing the
exact specifications of the grants they
receive. That marketable products may
result from following such guidelines is
only an added benefit of their research,
never a direct aim, he said.
In fact, the product Yeager developed
was a result of efforts to make his lab
oratory more state of the art and to
improve the efficiency of other research.
In 1979, after receiving a gift from Xerox
Corp., Yeager and his co-workers decided
to develop networking software for their

lab. The software they aimed to produce
did not exist commercially at the time.
Cisco approached Stanford with inten
tions of licensing the software and most
of the negotiations were handled by the
licensing office.
Monetary gain was not an impetus for
Yeager, either. A portion of the few thou
sand dollars that the software generates
annually is returned not to Yeager, but
to his laboratory, "because the invention
came from the environment, not the in
dividual," he said.
And even though his department, which
is a joint venture between the Medical
School and the Computer Science Depart
ment, receives a share of the royalties,
the idea that they would encourage him
to further the development of marketable
products is "repugnant to them," Yeager
said.
According to licensing office director

Niels Riemars, profit is rarely an impetus
to redirect research because, for most
inventions licensed by Stanford, the
amount of royalties received is usually
rather small.
Richard Roth of the Medical School said
he receives an amount of royalties equiv
alent to "a plane fare to my next confer
ence." Roth's work in monoclonal
antibodies was licensed by Oncogen Co.
of New \ork to develop pharmaceuticals.
"I don't feel any need to develop prod
ucts for companies," he said. "Scientists
won t do that for the sake of monetary
reasons."
Regardless of their intentions, research
licensed through the licensing office gen
erates a significant amount of revenue
for the University. In fiscal year 1989,
royalties totaled $11.5 million.

Much of this huge income can
be attributed to the aggressive
contacts many businesses estab
lish with researchers and the
licensing office in the hopes of
developing new products founded
on basic research.
"We pursue our ties with uni
versities fairly aggressively," said
John Newman, vice president of
California Biotechnology Inc. in
Mountain View, one of many com
panies that license the recom
binant DNA synthesis process
created by Stanley Cohen of Stan
ford and Herbert Boyer of UC-San
Francisco.
Hi-tech industry executives say
the biggest benefits of investing
in university research are often
the contacts made between private
firms and researchers.
"Universities are extremely im
portant to us," said Mel Kronick,
program manager at Applied
Biosystems Inc. in Foster City.
"But science moves in fits and
lurches, so it is very important to
observe trends in the scientific

community and to make con
tacts."
Kronick, who received a doc
torate in physics from Stanford
in' 1974, said his company in
vested nearly $1 million in the
development of phycobilyprotein
labeling technology, a method of
staining cells to make them more
visible, discovered at Stanford.
The financial return on mar
keting the process "has been sig
nificant," he said. "But the
biggest benefit you can't quantify
is the contacts with other insti
tutions, seeing their different
products and getting new ideas."
Michael Maia, president of
ZETA Corp., an electronic musical
instrument manufacturer in Oak
land, said that informal contacts
he made with Stanford professors
at a conference two years ago led
to an agreement and the subse
quent development of "pickup
technology," a simple but
high-quality and inexpensive
method of improving the perform
ance of electronic instruments.
The return on his investment
is not something that can be mea
sured in dollars, Maia said. "We
have a working relationship with
Stanford, and we see new develop

ments and share research."
Maia added that his company
now makes a much stronger effort
to maintain closer relations with
Stanford and other universities
than in the past.
But Maia and other corporate
officials stress that they are care
ful not to tempt faculty into
redirecting research toward
commercial applications.
So far, they have been success
ful, according to licensing office
associate Jon Sandelin. There
have been no documented in
stances of professors redirecting
their work at Stanford, he said.
Intending to aim research
toward marketable applications
would be counterproductive for a
university because of its lack of
experience and expertise in the
business world, some industry
leaders and licensing office em
ployees said.
"Businesses have different mo
tivations and expertise in financ
ing the middle stages of
development," Newman of Cali
fornia Biotechnology Inc. said. "A
university directing itself away
from basic research would prob
ably fail and just compete with
industry."

However, citing a university's
obligations to the country and the
public, industry leaders stress
that university faculty should not
ignore the contributions they
receive from corporations.
Newman pointed to a recent
slowdown in federal funding for
research and added that many
projects would not have been com
pleted without royalties.
