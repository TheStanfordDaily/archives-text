# Fruits of commercialization tempting, but faculty not biting

Editor's note: This is the second article
of a three-part series on the transfer of
technology from university laboratories to
private industry.

The huge success of Stanford's Office
of Technology Licensing in generating
royalties from the transfer of faculty re
search to private industry may have pro
vided an apple of temptation to
commercialize research here, but faculty
and staff are not biting.
High-technology firms that rely on
developments at Stanford, however, are
working hard to forge a "partnership"
with the University by keeping a close
eye on the work done here and its po
tential applications to their businesses.
Business leaders say that while they

look to stimulate the developmen of re
search that can lead to marketable prod
ucts, they are extremely cautious of
corrupting the main mission of a univer
sity to be independent in research aims.
Still, the pressure of hi-tech industry
to exploit and commercialize basic re
search — an especially acute pressure
here because of Stanford's lo nation in the
heart of the Silicon Valley — is 112 rongly
felt in many laboratories.
"Most things we do have poten' I mar
ket value. We know that," said illiam
Yeager of Stanford's Knowledge stems
Laboratory. Yeager developed a ct nputer

networking application now licensed by
Cisco Systems Inc. of Menlo Park.
Yet, despite the pressures to commer
cialize, researchers still hold fast to their
"environments and their commitments to
their grants," Yeager said. "Those are
the two most important things."
Researchers aim to make their labora
tory environments most amenable to per
forming research and to completing the
exact specifications of the grants they
receive. That marketable products may
result from following such guidelines is
only an added benefit of their research,
never a direct aim, he said.
In fact, the product Yeager developed
was a result of efforts to make his lab
oratory more state of the art and to
improve the efficiency of other research.
In 1979, after receiving a gift from Xerox
Corp., Yeager and his co-workers decided
to develop networking software for their

lab. The software they aimed to produce
did not exist commercially at the time.
Cisco approached Stanford with inten
tions of licensing the software and most
of the negotiations were handled by the
licensing office.
Monetary gain was not an impetus for
Yeager, either. A portion of the few thou
sand dollars that the software generates
annually is returned not to Yeager, but
to his laboratory, "because the invention
came from the environment, not the in
dividual," he said.
And even though his department, which
is a joint venture between the Medical
School and the Computer Science Depart
ment, receives a share of the royalties,
the idea that they would encourage him
to further the development of marketable
products is "repugnant to them," Yeager
said.
According to licensing office director

Niels Riemars, profit is rarely an impetus
to redirect research because, for most
inventions licensed by Stanford, the
amount of royalties received is usually
rather small.
Richard Roth of the Medical School said
he receives an amount of royalties equiv
alent to "a plane fare to my next confer
ence." Roth's work in monoclonal
antibodies was licensed by Oncogen Co.
of New \ork to develop pharmaceuticals.
"I don't feel any need to develop prod
ucts for companies," he said. "Scientists
won t do that for the sake of monetary
reasons."
Regardless of their intentions, research
licensed through the licensing office gen
erates a significant amount of revenue
for the University. In fiscal year 1989,
royalties totaled $11.5 million.
