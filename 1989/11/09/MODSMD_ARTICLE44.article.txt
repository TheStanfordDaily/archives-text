# 'I Guess That's Why’ Stanford songwriter Wicks is amazing
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
When people flop into my room
and shuffle through my tape col
lection, they see the classics —
The Who, Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers, Debbie Wicks. . . .
"Debbie Wicks? Who is Debbie
Wicks?"
Oh, she lives next door, I say
casually.
To the Registrar's Office, Debbie
Wicks is a 19-year-old junior
majoring in music and communi
cation. But in reality she is a
singer, songwriter and performer
who just this year cut her own
spectacular album. "I Guess That's
Why" has been released and played
in Brazil and it will soon be avail
able in the United States.
Wicks first became interested in
singing while in high school in
Portugal. She independently re
corded an experimental tape two
years ago in Brazil, where her fath
er, a naval officer, is stationed.
The experimental tape im
pressed many music critics in
Brazil, whom she says are "much
more open to new music."
But more importantly, she liked
the tape herself and was motivated
to turn the raw but powerful
sounds into "a real record." Over
Christmas break last year she
began writing the lyrics and music
for "I Guess That's Why."
Her writing was limited to her
vacations to Brazil "because Stan
ford is too much of a distraction,"

she says. Yet her Stanford experi
ences are the dominant themes in
all of the songs.
"I get my motivations from the
people I meet, the events in my
life," she says.
In Brazil, Wicks hired five studio
musicians and rented out a record
ing studio, using the money she
made while working at the U.S.
Consulate in Rio de Janeiro.
The result of two grueling 12-
hour and seven six hour-long ses
sions is a terrific and diverse
collection of 11 songs written and
performed by Wicks herself.
Definitely the best part of all
the songs is that they are her voice.
This is no computer synthesized
medley; this is not Tiffany piping
in the covers of stupid, old songs.
This is Debbie's dynamic, exciting
voice, as clear and pure as it is in
real life, and every bit as vibrant
and dynamic as her personality.
You don't have to sit through
empty dance tunes when you lis
ten to "I Guess That's Why." The
album catches you immediately
with "Watch It," a serious warning
song about fidelity based on The
Beatles' "It's the End." The next
song, the title track, is a slow,
bitter tune about one-night stands
and crushed expectations.
The whole album is not "gushy"
songs, as she puts it. The aerobic
style "Die With a T" jogs through
clever and upbeat lyrics about the
pains of dieting, such as "Hand
me a celery stick/I've got a battle
to win."

"Something Going Right" is a
truly sweet and moving number.
Little would you know that it was
a Valentine's Day gift from Debbie
to her boyfriend because she had
no money to buy anything.
A fair share of social commen
tary is inserted among the love
songs. "Just a Telephone Call" not
so-subtly criticizes the sedentary
life of most Americans — whose
daily exercise is using the TV
remote control and mobile phones
— as opposed to Brazilians, whom
she says are "much more active."
My favorite tunes are "What You
Do To Me" and "Don't Let it Mat
ter," mainly because her voice and
her incredible keyboard solos are
emphasized by a smooth bass riff
and steady beat.
Her favorite song, however, is
"Silent Waiting," a melancholy
tune about being far from home
and far from friends.
The incredible smoothness of
the production belies the nearly
impossible obstacle she had to
overcome in cutting the tape.
Because she doesn't have a re
cording label yet, all of the money
used in creating the album came
out of her pocket. "I could feel the
minutes ticking away in the re
cording studio," she says.
Various "brick walls" of paper
work, copyright laws and studio
costs and mixing professionals,
some of whom charge up to $50
per hour, had to be scaled. Despite
the marathon recording sessions
and financial and legal strains,

however, she didn't get tired while
writing and recording songs.
Wicks is currently involved in
several musical groups on campus
— she is head composer and con
ductor for Big Game Gaieties, co
director of the Newman Center
Church Choir and a member of
the Stanford Chorale singing group

— and she has given several live
performances in Brazil.
One concert was played before
a crowd of 1,500 at the University
of Rio de Janeiro. She says she
hopes to continue her career in
music after Stanford.
"I'm going to go for it," she

promises. "There's nothing else I
care enough to want to do."
So when she becomes really fa
mous someday, just think, you
may have been in one of her songs.
You really should make an effort
to meet her and talk to her — you
might just end up being the mo
tivation for her next big hit.

To the Registrar's Office, Debbie
Wicks is a 19-year-old junior
majoring in music and communi
cation. But in reality she is a
singer, songwriter and performer
who just this year cut her own
spectacular album. "I Guess That's
Why" has been released and played
in Brazil and it will soon be avail
able in the United States.
Wicks first became interested in
singing while in high school in
Portugal. She independently re
corded an experimental tape two
years ago in Brazil, where her fath
er, a naval officer, is stationed.
The experimental tape im
pressed many music critics in
Brazil, whom she says are "much
more open to new music."
But more importantly, she liked
the tape herself and was motivated
to turn the raw but powerful
sounds into "a real record." Over
Christmas break last year she
began writing the lyrics and music
for "I Guess That's Why."
Her writing was limited to her
vacations to Brazil "because Stan
ford is too much of a distraction,"

she says. Yet her Stanford experi
ences are the dominant themes in
all of the songs.
"I get my motivations from the
people I meet, the events in my
life," she says.
In Brazil, Wicks hired five studio
musicians and rented out a record
ing studio, using the money she
made while working at the U.S.
Consulate in Rio de Janeiro.
The result of two grueling 12-
hour and seven six hour-long ses
sions is a terrific and diverse
collection of 11 songs written and
performed by Wicks herself.
Definitely the best part of all
the songs is that they are her voice.
This is no computer synthesized
medley; this is not Tiffany piping
in the covers of stupid, old songs.
This is Debbie's dynamic, exciting
voice, as clear and pure as it is in
real life, and every bit as vibrant
and dynamic as her personality.
You don't have to sit through
empty dance tunes when you lis
ten to "I Guess That's Why." The
album catches you immediately
with "Watch It," a serious warning
song about fidelity based on The
Beatles' "It's the End." The next
song, the title track, is a slow,
bitter tune about one-night stands
and crushed expectations.
The whole album is not "gushy"
songs, as she puts it. The aerobic
style "Die With a T" jogs through
clever and upbeat lyrics about the
pains of dieting, such as "Hand
me a celery stick/I've got a battle
to win."

"Something Going Right" is a
truly sweet and moving number.
Little would you know that it was
a Valentine's Day gift from Debbie
to her boyfriend because she had
no money to buy anything.
A fair share of social commen
tary is inserted among the love
songs. "Just a Telephone Call" not
so-subtly criticizes the sedentary
life of most Americans — whose
daily exercise is using the TV
remote control and mobile phones
— as opposed to Brazilians, whom
she says are "much more active."
My favorite tunes are "What You
Do To Me" and "Don't Let it Mat
ter," mainly because her voice and
her incredible keyboard solos are
emphasized by a smooth bass riff
and steady beat.
Her favorite song, however, is
"Silent Waiting," a melancholy
tune about being far from home
and far from friends.
The incredible smoothness of
the production belies the nearly
impossible obstacle she had to
overcome in cutting the tape.
Because she doesn't have a re
cording label yet, all of the money
used in creating the album came
out of her pocket. "I could feel the
minutes ticking away in the re
cording studio," she says.
Various "brick walls" of paper
work, copyright laws and studio
costs and mixing professionals,
some of whom charge up to $50
per hour, had to be scaled. Despite
the marathon recording sessions
and financial and legal strains,

however, she didn't get tired while
writing and recording songs.
Wicks is currently involved in
several musical groups on campus
— she is head composer and con
ductor for Big Game Gaieties, co
director of the Newman Center
Church Choir and a member of
the Stanford Chorale singing group

— and she has given several live
performances in Brazil.
One concert was played before
a crowd of 1,500 at the University
of Rio de Janeiro. She says she
hopes to continue her career in
music after Stanford.
"I'm going to go for it," she

promises. "There's nothing else I
care enough to want to do."
So when she becomes really fa
mous someday, just think, you
may have been in one of her songs.
You really should make an effort
to meet her and talk to her — you
might just end up being the mo
tivation for her next big hit.
