# Reducing the greenhouse effect
## Experts discuss possible solutions to problem of global warming 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
A newly developed light bulb
would require so much less energy
than current bulbs that one ton
less of carbon dioxide would be
released into the environment, ac
cording to Donald Aitken, director
of the Center for Solar Energy
Applications at San Jose State
University.
Carbon dioxide is the mt\jor con
tributor to the greenhouse effect,
which was the subject of discus
sion at a forum last night in Cub
berley Auditorium on "Global
Warming and Energy Policy." The
event was sponsored by the Wash
ington, D.C.-based Union of Con
cerned Scientists in conjunction
with Students for Environmental
Action at Stanford.
Ralph Cavanagh, an attorney
for the National Resources De
fense Council, said the United
States must stop dumping gases

contributing to the greenhouse ef
fect into the air when the conse
quences are potentially
disasterous.
"It would be grossly unethical
to consider operating such an ex
periment globally," Cavanagh
said. He explained that a decrease
in carbon dioxide emissions does
not necessarily mean a decline in
industrial growth, a misconcep
tion held by many.
Cavanagh proposed the devel
opment of energy-saving devices
such as the newly developed light
bulb. The bulb consumes one
quarter as much energy as a 60-
watt bulb but lasts 13 times as
long.
He said one barrier to
the development of such products
is that people do not get instant
payback for their investments.
Still, he is hopeful that the barrier
can be overcome.
Ralph Perhac, who is with the
Electric Power Research Industry

in Palo Alto, said utilities are not
a cause of global warming.
He said the industry accounts for
6 percent of global carbon dioxide
emission and is therefore only a
minor player.
He added, though, that the in
dustry is concerned with the
issue, and the best solution to the
problem would be through in
creased energy efficiency. That
woulu be far more effective than
turn ng toward other means of
gen iting power, according to
I'ei ic.
\ noted that alO percent im
pi tent in energy efficiency
o* i'e next decade would sta
>rbon dioxide emission at
Â»!nt level.
i said he believes citizens
make the government
the situation is grave
o warrant action. Accord
jrrent models, by 2050,
age global temperature is
rise by 3 degrees Celsius.
