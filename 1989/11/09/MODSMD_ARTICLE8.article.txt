# Tresidder target of vandals
## Management links damage to dispute with USW 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
In yet another round of heated
claims and counter-claims, Tres
idder Union management charged
yesterday that recent vandalism
at Tresidder is linked to the man
agement's current dispute with
the United Stanford Workers.
Tresidder Director Bobbi
Braden and Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson, in a
letter to The Daily, also claimed
that Tresidder staff have been the
targets of harassment by USW
members.
Carpets in the Tresidder dining
room and information foyer were
damaged sometime last weekend
when an acidic product used to
clean toilets was spilled on them,
Braden said. The acid burned
through to the carpet backing,
and holes are visible in long cur
ving paths through both areas.
In addition, "toilets were inten
tionally plugged to cause damage"
over the weekend, according to
the letter. The flooding that
resulted was not found until Mon
day morning, Braden said.
"Although we do not know who
is responsible for the damage, we
know that such incidents have oc
curred in the past when there has
been a disagreement between
Tresidder management and some
of the USW leadership," Braden
and Robinson wrote.
The USW is currently in a dis
pute with Tresidder over last
month's decision to eliminate the

positions of three custodians in
order to reduce its $210,000 def
icit.
USW Steward Linda Crouse
said workers were not responsible
for the damage and that the USW
does not condone such activity.
"I just don't see how that could
happen," Crouse said. "No uni
formed custodian would take the
risk to commit this in front of
people. You don't have to be a
genius to know that we have noth
ing to gain from this. It only
makes us look bad."
Crouse said there is "a lot of
community resentment" about the
dispute with Tresidder and added
that similar incidents, committed
by people in the community, have
occurred in the past.
"They have no right to point
the finger at us. They have no
evidence," added USW field rep
resentative Rodney Barnette.
Braden also said that three
Tresidder staff members have re
cently been harassed by workers
who are USW members. In one
incident, reported in Tuesday's
Daily, Barnette allegedly harassed
Tresidder Finance Manager Rae
Hill when she approached a group
of workers to inform them of
other University jobs to which
they could transfer.
Barnette denied the charge and
said it was being leveled against
him because he is black.
Braden said reports of two other
harassment incidents have been
sent to Dean of Student Affairs

James Lyons. Braden would not
release details of the incidents.
Lyons said he has not received
the reports and only has second
hand information about the inci
dents. However, he said one inci
dent involved a Tresidder facilities
supervisor who is surrounded by
workers when she arrives at her
job in the morning and is harassed
and heckled by them.
"These tactics are clearly unac
ceptable," Lyons said. "Staff at
all levels have the right to be free
from this."
Braden said incidents of staff
harassment have occurred in the
past when management was in
volved in disputes with the USW.
For example, car tires have been
slashed and paint finishes on cars
have been scratched, she said.
Crouse said she knew nothing
of the two most recent incidents
and reiterated that no worker
would risk a job to do such a
thing as heckle a supervisor. "If
we called a supervisor names in
front of witnesses they would drag
us in and punish us," she said.
Another passage in the letter
said the damage to the carpets
destroyed "the investment that
students have made in those
spaces for the past two years."
Braden explained that the car
pet installation was the project of
students who served on the Tres
idder Union Board. But Crouse
called the reference "a transparent
attempt to pit workers against
students, and I resent it deeply."

ceptable," Lyons said. "Staff at
all levels have the right to be free
from this."
Braden said incidents of staff
harassment have occurred in the
past when management was in
volved in disputes with the USW.
For example, car tires have been
slashed and paint finishes on cars
have been scratched, she said.
Crouse said she knew nothing
of the two most recent incidents
and reiterated that no worker
would risk a job to do such a
thing as heckle a supervisor. "If
we called a supervisor names in
front of witnesses they would drag
us in and punish us," she said.
Another passage in the letter
said the damage to the carpets
destroyed "the investment that
students have made in those
spaces for the past two years."
Braden explained that the car
pet installation was the project of
students who served on the Tres
idder Union Board. But Crouse
called the reference "a transparent
attempt to pit workers against
students, and I resent it deeply."
