Hanging out in Tresidder
Things got steamy in Tresidder Union's Laurel
Room last night when three female undergrad
uates decided to take their shirts off while study
ing.
Alex, Judy and Leslie, who did not want to
disclose their last names fearing that their par
ents or their children might someday find out,
closed the door but left the blinds open and
settled down to study in their bras.
"We started studying at about 7:30 p.m.," Judy
said. "We didn't want to go to the library. We
wanted to come here and get a room because
the rooms are quiet."
After talking for a little while, Judy said she
started to feel hot.
"Then, we started to talk about how unfair it
is that men can take their shirts off in society,
but that women cannot," Leslie said. "After
talking for a little while, we decided to take our
shirts off."
"We're not making a statement," Alex said.
"We were just curious about how people would
react."
"We're not radical, bra-burning women," Judy
added. "If we were bra-burners, we'd have noth
ing on."
The women said it was a spontaneous thing,
but they considered taking their bras off as a
kind of experiment.
"Once we decided to do it, we went into it with
an open mind, but we hypothesized that people
would be too embarrassed to confront us," Judy
said. "For the most part, we were right."
Though about a hundred people walked by,
many of whom noticed the women and snickered,
only a handful confronted them, according to
Judy.
"The people who walked by and snickered are
just suppressing themselves and their curiosity,"
Judy said. "We felt here on this campus we could
do it and people would be more open to it.
"Two young men asked us if they could study
here. They came in and lasted about three

minutes before they left, embarrassed. T hen, two
men came in and asked us what we were doing,
Judy said. "A woman came in and took pictures
of us for her photography class and a Domino s
pizza man also came in and asked us what we
were doing."
"The Domino's pizza man was certainly the
most interesting visitor," Leslie said.
One woman also rapped on the window as she
passed by to inform the women that the blinds
were open, according to Judy.
Despite the disturbances, the women said they
managed to get a lot of work done.
Leslie was studying economics, Judy was
reading Virginia Woolf and Alex was reading ab
normal psychology.
"It is very comfortable," Alex said. "We're not
wearing anything less than a bathing suit."
"We just decided to break the social norm,"
Judy added.
The women said they would not have done it
outside. In fact, they donned shirts when they
went to the bathroom and went downstairs for
tea during the course of their three-hour study
session.
The question is whether they plan to study
like this again.
