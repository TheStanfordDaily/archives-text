# Student Affairs investigates assault report
## 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
An alleged sexual assault by at
tendees of a party at the Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity house is
currently under investigation by
the Stanford Police and the Office
of Student Affairs, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons said yes
terday.
Lyons received a phone call in
late October from a woman who
said that two men had had sex
with a girl who was younger than
college-age in a bathroom at the
Deke house during an Oct. 6 party.
The woman who placed the phone
call did not witness the incident,
but she said she "overheard the
girl being counseled by a friend
on a bench in the lobby" of the
house, Lyons said.
The woman also wrote letters
to University President Donald
Kennedy and the Stanford Police,
Lyons said. At the time he re
ceived the phone call, Lyons had
not seen the letters, but they were
later brought to his attention.

The letters do not implicate any
member of the fraternity or any
Stanford student, Lyons added.
Although the woman did not see
either of the men supposedly in
volved, she said she has reason
to believe they were not Stanford
students.
The author of the letter lives
in the Monterey Peninsula area
and has no apparent connection
to Stanford.
Michael Hughes, the fraternal
affairs adviser, took over the in
vestigation for Student Affairs
last Thursday. He stressed the
lack of substantiated facts in the
letter.
"So far, it's entirely rumors. It
sounds like the woman heard of
the incident second-, third- or even
fourth-hand. The credibility of the
letter has led me to believe that
the incident did not occur,"
Hughes said.
The Dekes have not been placed
on any form of social suspension.
Mike Nakashima, president of
the Dekes, said that he was in
formed of the letter last Thursday

by Hughes. Members of the house
were "shocked due to the nature
of the allegations in the letter,"
he said.
Soon afterward, they held a
house meeting to determine if
anyone in the house had any
knowledge of the incident, but "no
one knew anything," Nakashima
said.
The fraternity is cooperating
with Hughes to see if there is any
substantiation to the allegations,
Nakashima said.
Diana Conklin, director of the
Row, said that the Dekes are "ear
nestly seeking answers." She
noted, however, that there were
people at the party that night who
were not Stanford students be
cause the band that played had
been "allowed to bring groupies,
which is generally not a good idea.
"Supposedly the band pres
sured [the Dekes] and the house
gave into it, which was a real big
mistake," she said.
Nakashima said he did not see
a connection between friends of
the band and the assault.

"There weren't any girls there
who looked particularly young to
me," he said.
A Deke adviser, who preferred
to remain anonymous, said it
seems unlikely that an assault
could have occurred in the bath
room without anyone seeing it.
With almost 200 people in the
house, it is strange that some
would not be going in and out of
the bathroom, he said.
The Interfraternity Council re
leased a statement last night say
ing that because no facts exist at
this time, "it is wholly inappro
priate to condemn any group or
individual." The statement also
says that the IFC hopes "the al
legations regarding this assault
are not true. However, the IFC
realizes the gravity of these alle
gations and is deeply concerned
about the issue of sexual assault
on the Stanford campus."
Lyons confirmed that as of yet
"there are no facts."
"However, we do take com
plaints very seriously," he said.
