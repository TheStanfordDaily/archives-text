Group to study needs
of women on campus
A group of administrators,
faculty and students has begun
meeting to plan the first steps
of a project that will study the
experiences of women students
on campus and examine how
the University can better pro
vide for their needs.
The study group for what is
being called the Women's Needs
Assessment includes represen
tatives from Student Affairs,
the Women's Center, the Grad
uate Women's Network, Cowell
Student Health Center and ac
ademic departments, among
others.
In its first meeting Wednes
day, the group started to "con
ceptualize" how to go about
doing the assessment, said As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson.
"The assessment will take a
long time. We're taking the
first several meetings just
figuring out what we want to
do," Jackson said.
Yet to be determined are the
topics the study will address,
what groups it will focus on,
how the study will be con
ducted, how the group's find
ings will be used — and how
long it will take.

Cheap furniture for
displaced students
The Stanford Surplus Store
will hold a special sale for Stan
ford students displaced because
of the earthquake starting
today at 330 Bonair Siding,
across from the maintenance
shops.
Store Manager John Pipkin
stressed that the sale is only
for those students displaced by
the earthquake, and that he
has a list of such students.
"Surplus will make available
desks, tables, chairs, refrig
erators and other things at
very low prices to those stu
dents," Pipkin said.
The store has approximately
"50 desks and 100 or so chairs,"
which will be sold at "dirt
cheap" prices, Pipkin said.
The sale will continue until
all the furniture is gone, Pipkin
said, and "could run a couple
of weeks."
"We just want to help the
kids," Pipkin said.
