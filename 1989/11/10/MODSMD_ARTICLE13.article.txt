## East Germany opens Berlin Wall, thousands celebrate 
### 
BERLIN (AP) — East Germany
opened the Berlin Wall and its
other borders Thursday, and its
cheering citizens crossed freely to
the West for the first time since
1961. Hundreds of people danced
on the wall.
Late Thursday and early Fri
day, exultant East Germans
coursed through Berlin Wall
checkpoints and others entered
West Germany at other border
crossings.
Near Brandenburg Gate, East
Germans raced through streams
of police water cannon and were
pulled up the wall by the young
West Germans atop it. Some Ger
mans used hammers to chip away
at the barrier for keepsakes or in
their own small way try to destroy
the infamous symbol of East-West
division.
The sight of jubilant people
prancing and dancing atop the
wall, so heavily guarded for years,
had been unthinkable only hours
earlier.
About 100 East Berliners at the
Brandenburg Gate chanted:
"Open the gate! Open the gate!"
Hundreds of West Berliners
took advantage of the newly
opened borders during the

carnival-like atmosphere to head
in the opposite direction and catch
a glimpse of the other side of the
divided city.
"What joy! This is the best
thing that happened in 100
years!" yelled a West Berlin man
as he crossed into what had once
been forbidden territory.
Hundreds were seen on the
Friedrichstrasse subway in West
Berlin, and East Germans also
were allowed for the first time at
Checkpoint Charlie, the famed
Friedrichstrasse crossing run by
the Allied military.
Many hugged and kissed
strangers, while cars packed with
East Germans and others paraaed
down the streets of West Berlin.
"It's crazy! It's crazy!" shouted
one young man as he sat in the
back seat of a car with his parents
after a brief trip past the once
impenetrable Berlin Wall.
His parents said they just
wanted to see the West — and
then drive back. They declined to
give their names.
All apparently were arriving
without visas, although visas tech
nically were necessary under reg
ulations announced earlier Thurs
day. A spokesman for the West

German border police in
Braunschweig said the East Ger
mans had been allowed over the
border there without visas.
East German radio announced
that East Germans would be re
quired to get a visa for such trips
beginning Friday morning.
With decades of fortified fron
tiers apparently at an end, the
wall that for decades represented
the literal division between the
East and West may become a mere
monument to the Cold War.
Since it suddenly appeared dur
ing an August night 28 years ago
and East Germany's borders were
sealed, 191 people are known to
have died while fleeing.
The surprise move to open the
borders came at a Central Com
mittee meeting Thursday.
Egon Krenz, East Germany's
new leader, also advocated a law
Thursday that would ensure free
and democratic elections in his
communist nation, which has
been disrupted by pro-reform
demonstrations and weakened by
mass flight to the West.
The Central Committee sched
uled a Communist Party confer
ence — the first since 1956 — for
Dec. 15-17.


East Berlin citizens crowd the gate last night to pass through the East Berlin border crossing point to go
into the western part of the divided city. Hours before, the Communist East German government
announced its decision to open its borders.
