# Islamic fundamentalists dominate Jordan's elections

### 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Islamic fun
damentalists stunned pro-government
candidates by taking 34 of the 80 seats
in Parliament in Jordan's first general
election in 22 years, according to results
reported Thursday.
Fundamentalists rolled up huge totals
in Wednesday's election while powerful
former government officials struggled to
win and sometimes failed.
The outcome appeared a setback for
King Hussein, who urged voters not to
mix religion with politics.
It also was a disappointment to Jor
danian women, who ran and voted in
their first national election. None of the
12 women among 647 parliamentary can
didates won.
Victors included men once imprisoned
on political grounds and one convicted
in an attack on an Israeli airline office
in Athens.

The new Parliament seems certain to
be more assertive than the often passive
legislature dissolved last year. Hussein
retains ultimate power, however, and
martial law in effect since the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war continues.
Parliament must approve all laws and
can dismiss governments, but the king
can dissolve the legislature and rule with
out it, as he has done for much of the
past 15 years.
Israeli officials, who regard Hussein as
a moderate Arab leader, expressed some
concern about the election results. One
said, on condition of anonymity: "What
we are speaking about is a substantial
opposition to the king from the right. ...
This might bring a problem for the king."
In the vanguard of the fundamentalist
campaign was the Moslem Brotherhood.
Its 26 declared and several allied candi
dates called for social justice, stricter Is

lamic morality and the destruction of
Israel.
"The people want Islam and it is not
strange ... to have such a large number
of Moslem candidates winning," Broth
erhood spokesman Ziad Abu Ghanimeh
said.
Fundamentalists often have allied
themselves with Hussein, a descendant
of the prophet Mohammed, against
secular leftists, but have pressed him for
restrictions on Western-type entertain
ment, more social welfare programs and
greater separation of the sexes.
Final results gave 22 seats to Broth
erhood candidates. Other Islamists won
12 seats, and some of the 20 or so pro
government figures also had links to the
Islamic movement.
Leftists, Arab nationalists, tribal
leaders and others took the rest of the
seats.
Parliament's makeup gives the varied

opposition a clear majority over royalists.
In their campaigns, many winners
demanded prosecution of former officials
accused of corruption and, because of the
nation's $8.3 billion foreign debt, of eco
nomic mismanagement.
The 80 seats are divided among 20
districts, and more than 40 candidates
ran in some of them.
Three men who resigned powerful posts
to run barely made it.
Former Deputy Premier Taher Masri
edged out a Brotherhood candidate in his
Amman district but finished far behind
the leader, another fundamentalist.
Thouqan Hindawi, former head of the
Royal Court, won a seat in Irbid but got
only half as many votes as the top can
didate, a member of the Brotherhood.
Abdul-Raouf al Rawabdeh, former mayor
of Amman, finished eighth in the same
race, just enough to win a place in Par
liament.

Those losing included Hamdi Tabaa,
the former trade and industry minister,
and the former public works minister,
Shawfiq Zawaideh.
In Washington, State Department dep
uty spokesman Richard Boucher ap
plauded the renewal of the electoral proc
ess in Jordan.
"We fully support the process of politcal
reform that accompanies it. We note that
the polling is proceeding peacefully and
in a fair and orderly fashion," he said.
He added that the United States looks
forward to working with the new gov
ernment in Jordan once it is installed.
After four days of price riots in south
ern Jordan in April, Hussein moved up
the election date and increased personal
and press freedom.
Although political parties are banned,
the government did not enforce the
prohibition and many ran slates of can
didates openly.

uty spokesman Richard Boucher ap
plauded the renewal of the electoral proc
ess in Jordan.
"We fully support the process of politcal
reform that accompanies it. We note that
the polling is proceeding peacefully and
in a fair and orderly fashion," he said.
He added that the United States looks
forward to working with the new gov
ernment in Jordan once it is installed.
After four days of price riots in south
ern Jordan in April, Hussein moved up
the election date and increased personal
and press freedom.
Although political parties are banned,
the government did not enforce the
prohibition and many ran slates of can
didates openly.
