# NATO alters arms control stance

### 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) -
NATO on Thursday put final
touches on a plan that it said
would curb conventional arms in
Europe and ease the path of War
saw Pact countries that decide to
leave the Soviet bloc military al
liance.
Negotiators for the North At
lantic Treaty Organization said
the proposals contained several
new provisions placing more em
phasis on individual countries
within the two military alliances.
The NATO negotiators, who
spoke outside the opening session
of the winter round of East-West
non-nuclear arms talks, said the
new Western package defined the
talks as between "groups of
states" instead of the NATO and
Warsaw Pact alliances.
"This is a development away
from alliances and toward indi
vidual states" at the 23-nation
talks, said chief delegate Iluediger
Hartmann of West Germany.
A Western delegate who spoke
on condition of anonymity ac
knowledged the change of empha
sis was in anticipation of possible
future moves by some Warsaw
Pact countries to leave the Soviet
led alliance of seven nations.
Several Hungarian leaders have
suggested in recent months that
their Warsaw Pact country might

opt for neutrality in the foresee
able future as part of its reform
process transforming it from com
munist rule to multiparty democ
racy.
The delegate indirectly ac
knowledged Hungarian develop
ments influenced the new lan
guage of the NATO proposals. He
said some countries contemplating
a move away from the Warsaw
Pact would be reluctant to sign a
treaty binding them to an alliance
they could soon be outside of.
Hartmann, in the same vein,
said that "some Eastern nations
now larel not ready to assume
responsibilities for the whole East
bloc."
The NATO package thus
proposes country-by-country
limits on weapons categories in
stead of only two ceilings — one
for NATO, the other for the War
saw Pact, said the delegates.
It also would permit any indi
vidual country belonging to one
of the two alliances to unilaterally
withdraw from a conventional
arms treaty if its supreme inter
ests were jeopardized.
Chief Soviet negotiator Oleg A.
Grinevsky told another news con
ference he was reluctant to com
ment on the NATO proposals
before seeing them, but he ap
peared cool to the "group of

states concept.
"It's possible to have some
quotas for each country," he said,
when asked about individual
country limits as opposed to alli
ance ceilings. "But the agreement
[should bel ... between the two
alliances."
The NATO proposals were to
be presented at Thursday's
opening round. But a Western del
egate said last-minute disagree
ment among the 16-nation Atlan
tic Alliance on their language
meant they would likely be sub
mitted next week.
While the proposals remain con
fidential, NATO negotiators said
they contained modified versions
of suggestions made by the West
ern side since the talks opened in
March, including:
— Limiting the size of military
exercises to no more than 40,000
troops per bloc
— Mandatory advance notifica
tion of major mobilization of
reservists and of large troop
movements
— Mandatory easy access to
specific weapons depots with up
to one-fifth of each side's arsenals
and simplified surveillance of
equipment in units with a low
level of readiness.
