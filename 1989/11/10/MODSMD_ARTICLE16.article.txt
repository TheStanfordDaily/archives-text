Bush invites Shamir
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House
issued a last-minute invitation Thursday to Is
raeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to meet
with President Bush next week.
Israel's leadership had been kept in suspense
for several weeks about whether a meeting would
take place, and officials of both countries were
puzzled by the administration's handling of the
invitation.
The Israeli government had sought the invita
tion almost two months ago when Shamir's trip
to the United States was being arranged. Shamir
is due in New York on Monday and is scheduled
to address Jewish groups in Cincinnati and Los
Angeles.
The decision to hold the White House meeting
next Wednesday was made during an afternoon
meeting on Thursday between Bush and Secre
tary of State James Baker, said sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
Israeli Embassy officials had said Thursday
was the last day Shamir's plans could be left
hanging.
No bones about it
VIENNA, Austria (AP) — An Austrian paleon
tologist and anthropologist said Thursday that
his studies confirmed a skull long assumed to
belong to composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
was authentic.
Gottfried Tichy, a professor at Salzburg Uni

versity, said that in 3Vz years of study he found
no indications the skull was not Mozart.
Tichy said he carefully examined not only the
skull but contemporary portraits of Mozart, his
torical accounts of his life, medical reports and
correspondence.
Contra not allowed to speak in U.S.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department
barred the leader of the Contra rebels from hold
ing a news conference on Thursday, citing legal
constraints on use of federal funds that bought
his ticket to Washington.
Israel Galeano, who goes by the nom de guerre
Commander Franklin, had scheduled an after
noon press conference to discuss the rebels' po
sition on elections in Nicaragua and their decision
to fight back against attack by the ruling San
dinistas, said Greg Mueller, a conservative activist
who set up the news conference.
But Franklin was told by a lawyer at the State
Department there that he could not go to the
news conference, participants said.
The reason given was that his trip was being
paid for by taxpayer funds which cannot be used
to influence public opinion, according to Franklin
and to State Department officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
But Mueller accused U.S. officials of trying to
"muzzle" Franklin out of fear he might say some
thing to jeopardize talks between Contra repre
sentatives and the Sandinistas that began Thurs
day at the United Nations.
