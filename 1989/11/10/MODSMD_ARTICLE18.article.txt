## Celebrating AASA 
### 
For 20 years, AASA
has benifited students,
driven positive change

OVER THE COURSE of the
past 20 years and during
the last two weeks, Stanford
students have benefited from
AASA.
Two weeks of programming to
celebrate the Asian American Stu
dent Association's 20th anniver
sary culminates tonight with a tal
ent show and dance.
Stanford's AASA is one of the
oldest Asian-American student or
ganizations in the country and, for
20 years, it has been a driving force
behind changes that have helped
Asian-Americans and other stu
dents on campus.
Though the events of the past
two weeks have stressed the cul
tural achievements of Asian-
Americans in society, they have
also had a political bent, reflecting
AASA's various roles on campus.
Over the past 20 years, AASA
has been largely responsible for es
tablishing more institutional serv
ices for Asian-Americans on
campus such as Okada House and
the Asian-American Activities Cen
ter. In addition, AASA has provided
educational, cultural and social
programs which help to inform stu
dents and bring Asian-American
students and other students to
gether.
AASA is divided up into four
committees: social, cultural/
educational, issues and external af
fairs. Each committee plays an im
portant role in tying the organiza
tion together and trying to unite
the Asian-American community.
In addition to its regular pro
gramming and the 20th anniver
sary celebration, AASA members
are hoping this year to initiate a

program whereby Stanford stu
dents will tutor children from
Chinatown. Students in AASA feel
this will help them stay more in
touch with the Asian-American
community outside of Stanford.
One of the driving issues last
year behind the May 15 takeover
of University President Donald
Kennedy's office was AASA's
struggle for an Asian-American
history professor. Since the
protest, the University has decided
to hire an Asian-American studies
professor, but AASA is pushing for
an Asian-American studies depart
ment and at least a program
Highlights of the two-week
celebration have included a discus
sion in Okada House last Thursday
which delved into the question of
where the majority of Asian-
Americans are in terms of societal
status today. The discussion
revealed that a surprisingly high
number of Asian-Americans work
as blue-collar workers despite the
growing societal stereotype of
Asian-Americans as technologically
knowledgeable young urban pro
fessionals.
A forum at the Asian-American
Activities Center earlier this week
examined the topic of anti-Asian
violence in society and discussed
ways of curbing present and past
mistreatment.
Last night, up and coming jazz
pianist Jon Jang discussed the role
of the arts in the Asian-American
community.
Members of the Stanford com
munity who have taken advantage
of these programs have had the
opportunity to learn more about
the experiences of an important
ethnic minority group in this coun
try. By helping Asian-Americans
and others to learn more about
the Asian-American experience,
AASA has added a new dimension
to Stanford and aided its mission
of multicultural education.
