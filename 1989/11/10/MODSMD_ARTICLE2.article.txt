# Damage estimate shaky
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
While three weeks have passed
since the magnitude 7.1 earth
quake struck Stanford and the
Bay Area, the University is still
uncertain how much it will cost
to repair the damage sustained
on campus.
The $160 million figure that
has been used since a few days
after the temblor is "in the ball
park," according to officials in the
Office of Public Affairs.
However, Gene Kershner, asso
ciate director for facilities project
management, said the cost to
repair individual buildings will
probably not be known until next
month.
Meanwhile, in order to apply
for relief from the Federal Emer
gency Management Agency, the
University had to supply a
building-by-building estimate of
repair costs. That requirement
caused much consternation for
Acting Vice President for Public
Affairs Larry Horton.
Horton said it is frustrating "to
supply preliminary cost estimates
on very short notice. We have
done so to meet urgent inquiries
from government officials and the
public."
The preliminary estimate, com
pleted Nov. 1, is expected to un
dergo major modifications when

the damage survey is complete.
Among the most expensive repair
bills for which the University is
seeking federal aid include:
• The Quad, where it is likely
over $30 million will be needed
to repair Geology Corner, Lan

guage Corner, and the Values,
Technology, Science and Society
Building among others;
• Student residences, for which
it appears the rebuilding of
Columbae House, Phi Psi, Syn
ergy and Delta Tau Delta may
push the tab in excess of $10 mil
lion; and
• The Museum, Green Library
and the Graduate School of Busi
ness, three buildings that each
may face eight-figure repair bills.
Horton warned against paying
too close attention to these
amounts. "We have taken pains
to qualify these estimates, but the
qualifications have generally been
lost in the transmission," he said.
The recent closing of Building
310 serves as an example of how
tricky the process can be. After
initial inspection, the building was
believed safe. "But after a detailed
assessment and thinking about
what the repairs would be, struc

tural engineers determined the
risk was sufficiently high that we
really should not have people in
that building," said Curt Wil
liams, director of facilities project
management.
At present, 25 percent of the
damaged buildings have been sur
veyed by one of six teams assess
ing the situation, Kershner said.
Each team has a federal inspector
and a state inspector who are ac
companied by a Stanford project
manager.
Williams, a member of the team
that put together the initial
damage estimate, explained that
in the days following the earth
quake a group of people "ex
perienced in the cost to renovate
buildings . . . [got together to pro
vide! a 'guesstimate' of how much
it might cost."
He added that confidence in the
$160 million estimate was pro
vided by Haresh Shah, professor

of civil engineering. Shah ran a
computer model on how much
damage the campus should have
incurred and the result was in
the neighborhood of $160 million.
Terry Vernon, University facil
ities engineer, noted that the es
timated costs are not simply those
to repair damage. Instead, they
are dollar amounts required to
rebuild structures so they will
survive another earthquake of
similar magnitude. Vernon said
the reason for this is to insure
that equal — or even greater —
damage can be prevented from oc
curring in the future.
The University has already
done this type of work on several
structures, which came through
the earthquake virtually un
scathed. Vernon cited History
Corner, Roble Hall and the Lou
Henry Hoover House, home to
University President Donald Ken
nedy, as examples of previously

unreinforced buildings where a
sub-structure built underneath
the masonry helped prevent
earthquake damage.
The assessment the University
provided to the Federal Emer
gency Management Agency was
quite a bit lower than $160 mil
lion for several reasons. For
starters, some of the earliest es
timates have been revised to lower
figures. The total also does not
include buildings with less than
$200,000 in damage, since they
are ineligible for federal aid.
Similarly, it omits damage to
the East and South Wings of En
cina Hall, the Old Chemistry
Building and Memorial Church.

ily unoccupied due to concerns
about earthquake vulnerability,
which may rule them out for
federal assistance.
As a house of worship, the
church is automatically ineligible.
Federal funds will cover 75 per
cent of the cost of repairing
damaged buildings, according to
Assoc. Provost John Hughes. The
rest will come from state aid, of
which Stanford has already re
ceived $5 million, and the Uni
versity's own resources.
