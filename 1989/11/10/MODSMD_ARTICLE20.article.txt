## Flag burning, time wasting 
### 
AT LEAST the U.S. Congress has
its priorities in order. Of course,
that doesn't mean that the public
interest tops the list.
Let's at least give Congress some credit.
When it puts its mind to a task, it can
move quickly. Forget, for a second, that
it danced a two-step with the President
around the budget deficit last spring.
When the nation faced the horror of
flag burning, Congress whipped out a
statute banning the crime in less than
four months.
Congress, always working for that pay
raise, even held a rare all-night session,
just to allow its members to make solemn
declarations and impassioned pleas to
protect "Old Glory" — speeches that can
be taken home at campaign time and
proudly repeated.
I appreciate the passion the Stars and
Stripes inspires. My grandfather was
decorated several times in World War II
for his bravery, and my grandmother has
lived through both world wars and may
be the only person on the planet to re
member Flag Day every year.
Both were infuriated when the Su
preme Court ruled last June that flag
burning was a constitutionally-protected
version of speech.
I could understand, I suppose, the vet
erans. They had gone to war for their
country, and suddenly, it was legal —
and now, it's radical-chic — to burn the
very symbol of that nation.
It is, however, just a symbol. Despite
veterans' indignant outrage at the deci
sion, no one went to war for the flag.
People went to war for what the flag

meant, and the strength of that meaning
not only transcends the symbol, but it
also, in the words of Supreme Court Jus
tice Anthony Kennedy, "protects those
who hold [the flag] in contempt."
To limit this type of free speech by
protecting a symbol does a greater
damage to the substance of America's
strength, the Constitution; the decision
should have been a celebration of
America's firm belief in liberty.
The people we elect to represent us in
government should be intelligent enough
to make that distinction and get on to
more important issues. We'll never know,
though, because President Bush went to
the Iwo Jima memorial and changed the
rules of the debate.
From that point, it became a contest
of patriotism, and the real problems that
needed addressing had to wait for the
grandstanding to finish.
The lessons of the 1988 presidential
election also were clearly evident. The
success Bush enjoyed bashing Michael
Dukakis with the Pledge of Allegiance
struck fear into the hearts of incumbent
members of Congress.
Few dared to be caught in a re-election
campaign in which a challenger could
make the claim that the incumbent had
"voted against the flag."
The law that went into effect Oct. 27
serves only as political cover for those
members of Congress who were too
scared of facing their constituencies with
out having acted to protect the flag.
That so few members of Congress had
the guts or intelligence to stand up
against the anti-flag burning law further

proves that the public interest takes a
back seat to congressional interest in
maintaining the status quo.
Members of Congress really care about
re-election, and all the grandstanding
about the flag and all the votes in favor
of limiting free speech this fall are simply
means of protecting themselves from
later attack.
It's foolproof, and it's wrong. It allows
public officials to shuffle aside pressing,
vital matters for their own selfish power
plays. At least we didn't get an amend
ment to the Constitution, but recent ac
tions may yet renew that possibility.
Students at UC-Berkeley hosted a rally
for several hundred demonstrators on
Friday and the Friday before that to op
pose the new law. Flags, of course, were
set aflame. A similar protest occurred
last month in Washington, D.C.
It's only a matter of time before a
member of Congress in a tight re-election
race stands up to denounce the
"epidemic" of flag burning and demands
that a constitutional amendment cleanse
the nation of this evil.
Meanwhile, the rest of the public will
have to withstand the nonsense and con
tinue to wonder when Congress will ac
tually get something done.
