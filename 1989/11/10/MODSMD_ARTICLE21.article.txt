## Many factors combined to axe this year's Bonfire 
### 
THE STANFORD AXE committee
has decided that a Bonfire this
year will not be feasible.
As much as we would like to say
differently, the practicalities of
finances, safety considerations and the
diversion of many community resources
to earthquake repairs have made this
decision necessary.
As many people know, the Axe
Committee's proposed fee assessment
for this year's activities, including the
Bonfire, was denied last spring. Since
then, committee members have been
seeking other sources of financial

support for the Bonfire.
This search has included the Univer
sity, as well as alumni and corpora
tions. As of two weeks ago, the neces
sary funding was not available. At that
time, knowing the magnitude of plan
ning such an event as the Bonfire, we
decided to concentrate our efforts on
Big Game Week's other events, includ
ing an all-campus Thursday night rally.
Early this week, the Council of
Presidents asked us to consider the
feasibility of holding the Bonfire be
cause of significant student interest.
The COP brought the issue to Univer

sity President Donald Kennedy, who
supported it in principle.
After a thorough re-examination of
the proposed event, the Axe Committee
determined that the three mtyor con
cerns inhibit us from proceeding. Most
importantly, we still do not have any
firm financial commitments of sponsor
ship.
Another crucial factor is safety: the
Bonfire normally requires months of
planning and preparation to ensure the
safety of all involved. To try to address
all these issues in seven days is not
only impractical, but unwise.

Finally, we realize that many Univer
sity departments and outside contrac
tors are devoting all their attention
and resources to earthquake-related
problems.
We are very pleased to see the level
of interest expressed by the student
body. We are looking forward to the
other events of Big Game Week and to
putting on the 1990 Big Game Bonfire.
