# Tresidder's treatment of workers worthy of place in Dicken's novel
## 
### 
I have read with interest The Daily's
reporting of the United Stanford
Workers' protest regarding Tresidder
Union jobs and USW Steward Linda
Crouse's Nov. 1 letter to The Daily.
I have been tutoring Refugio Flores,
a Tresidder custodian, since winter
quarter in the Stanford Literacy Proj
ect and plan to continue. In the course
of our tutoring session, I became
aware that he might have to give up
his auto mechanics school because of a
proposed shift of his work to the night
shift.
I asked whether there was anything
I could do, and this led to my meeting
Linda Crouse, the laborer who wrote
the impressively clear and, for me,
persuasive 26-page document, "Cut
backs at Tresidder."
I do not want to be involved in the
discussion of waste and overemploy
ment at the managerial level. I would

not do so without first-hand knowl
edge.
However, Crouse's substantive argu
ment regarding the custodians — that
custodians are needed by day — to
clean toilets repeatedly, to move tables,
to respond to emergencies, to back up
the laborers — seems to me very
strong indeed.
I can well believe the place would be
in shambles without day custodians.
The counter-argument that the cus
todians are distracted from their work
by the presence of customers, perhaps
by implication the overall pleasantness
of working among other human beings
by daylight, seems to me worthy of
Dickens' "Gradgrind School."
I have learned a great deal about the
high quality of some Stanford employ
ees. In my opinion, more contact be
tween students and foreign-born Stan
ford employees would be beneficial and
pleasant for both.
I would urge the University to listen
sympathetically to the counter
proposals outlined by Crouse in her
lucid document.
