# Flier for 'America' is blatantly racist regardless of intent
## 
### 
We are outraged by the flier which
advertised the artistic performance
"America."
The flier was apparently intended to
shock people and make them aware of
racial stereotypes through the use of
denigrating caricatures of black Ameri
cans and phrases such as "Public Sale
of Negroids."
The only explanation of the intent of
the flier was a small caption that ap
peared at the bottom of the page ex
plaining that it was for an artistic
performance.
Students of different ethnicities
found the fliers blatantly racist. Many
students were extremely hurt and up
set. For these reasons, we feel that the
flier was thoughtlessly and insensitively
designed.
Responsibility for and sensitivity to
racial issues lies with every individual.
Being a member of an ethnic commu
nity does not exempt any person from

this obligation.
