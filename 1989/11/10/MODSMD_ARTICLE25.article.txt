## Evidence fails to support claim that Hoover has \political mission' 
### 
PROF. JOHN MANLEY responded
to my challenge that he prove
the Hoover Institution's so-called
"political mission" by examining the
research of Hoover scholars.
He claimed that it was "like an
invitation to a witch hunt, which is
why I have always based the case
against Hoover on quite different
evidence." Yet, Manley's use of such
evidence conveys the "witch hunt"
approach.
According to Manley, an institution
or university has a political mission if
some or all of the following conditions
are fulfilled:
First, the founder must define the
institution's purpose in normative
terms, and subsequent directors must
not repudiate those claims.
Second, the institution must have
many people who write for the

opinions pages as well as who appear
on television.
Third, the institution must allow
some of its researchers to engage in
public service in Washington, D.C.
Fourth, the institution must accept
monetary gifts from conservative do
nors.
By these ludicrous standards,
religiously-oriented colleges like Ober
lin, universities like Harvard and
Stanford (they qualify for the second
and fourth conditions) and research
institutions like Hoover have a political
mission.
Reflective readers of this column will
find the Manley standards for confirm
ing the pursuit of a political mission to
strain their credibility. Like a frog at
the bottom of the well, Manley's
evidence and standards reflect a limited
vision of the world.

He believes that certain information
contained in Hoover's Annual Reports
also prove his point.
When former Hoover director W.
Glenn Campbell cited former President
Reagan's statement that Hoover schol
ars had produced the knowledge base
responsible for "the changes now
taking place in Washington," Manley
twists the statement to argue that
"Hoover cannot have it both ways: It
cannot take credit for the 'Reagan
Revolution' and then deny it has a
political mission."
This argument is also specious.
First, neither Campbell nor any
Hoover scholars has publicly claimed,
least of all proved, that Hoover was
responsible for the so-called "Reagan
Revolution."
Second, a research institution's direc
tor can boast about the institution's

scholars' reputations and the institu
tion's contributions, but such state
ments need not reflect the actual
research of the institution's scholars.
Finally, the only adequate test of
what an institution's scholars really do
is to examine their research in some
detail and try to evaluate it by some
explicit standards.
By referring to the goals articulated
by President Hoover, Manley again
believes he has proven his case.
Let me point out that the famous
1959 resolution which redefined the
status of Hoover and was approved by
the University's top officials contained
this sentence: "The Director must be a
man who reflects the purpose of the
Institution."
We know what President Hoover's
views were. The point is that neither
President Hoover, Campbell nor current

acting director John Raisian have ever
organized research or intervened to
influence the research of Hoover's staff
and scholars to make it conform to
President Hoover's normative thinking.
If Manley believes that Hoover has a
political mission, he must use better
evidence and a more sophisticated
criteria to make his case.
He must be able to present solid
evidence of normative thinking that
results in biased research. If he is not
prepared to make some effort to do
that, then he should desist from
drawing on irrelevant facts in the
introductory comments to Hoover's
Annual Reports and advancing a ludi
crous set of standards by which to
judge those facts.
