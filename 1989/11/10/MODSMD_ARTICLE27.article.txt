## Two in hospital after water balloon battle 
### 
Nov. 11, 1938
The Stanford Daily
Dr. Ellwood Cubberley
presided over the dedication of
the new School of Education
building, which not so coin
cidentally was also named after
him. This seems fair consider
ing that Cubberley, a Stanford
professor and dean of the
School of Education, came up
with the original designs for
the building and provided
$475,000 of the building's
$535,000 price tag from his
own "pin money."
During his 15 years at Stan
ford, Cubberley appeared to be
the "typical underpaid college
professor," but at the same
time, he was secretly saving
royalties from his books and
lectures to provide the Univer
sity with funding for the new
building. Construction on the
building began in 1936, three
years after Cubberly's retire
ment and was completed two
years later.
Makes me wonder if any of
my professors out there is
secretly saving up to buy me a
Miata.

The Stanford Band refused
to attend the traditional Big
Game rally in San Francisco's
Union Square, prompting the
cancellation of the annual
event.
Members of the Band cited
conflicts between Stanford stu
dents, onlookers and Cal stu
dents that led to violence and
disturbances in previous years
in explaining their refusal to
play at the Union Square Rally.
The year before, trombones
came out looking like trumpets
and other instruments were
also dented and damaged in the
melee, according to Professor

Shuchbat, the band's director.

Two students were iryured
during the "Civ Riots," a tradi
tional water balloon fight be
tween Wilbur and Stern Halls
used to blow off steam aftei
the History of Western Civiliza
tion midterm.
One student from Stern suf
fered a broken arm after being
knocked down in the commo
tion. Another Stern resident
spent the night in the hospital
under observation due to a pos
sible concussion and broken
nose after a Wilbur resident al
legedly struck him over the
head several times with a beer
can.
Makes the recent CIV debate
look pretty tame by comparison.
Nov. 13, 1975
The Stanford Daily
Bonfire Committee Chair
man Tom Pedreira said that
the Bonfire was uncertain due
to questionable availability of
supplies. "We need wood, we
need oil and we need money,"
Pedreira said.
The Interfraternity Council,
which was responsible for co
ordinating the Bonfire, said the
total cost would be approxi
mately $750, and asked each
residence to contribute $10.
