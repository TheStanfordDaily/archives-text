# Quake expert Shah predicts 'big one'
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
When the recent earthquake hit,
some people turned to God, but
most people turned to Civil En
gineering Prof. Haresh Shah.
Shah is a co-founder of Stan
ford's John A. Blume Earthquake
Center and a renowned earth
quake expert.
"After the earthquake, people
from the Civil Engineering De
partment were out inspecting
buildings, pinpointing damage
and deciding which buildings

could be opened," Shah said. "It
took a whole day and that is why
the University was closed for a
day."
Since the earthquake, Shah's
workload has increased tremen
dously as people have turned to
him for answers. One of his
greatest concerns is that people
in the Bay Area understand that
last month's quake was not the
"big one" that looms like a specter
in the minds of practically every
one who has decided to live along
one of California's several faults.
"Everyone should remember

this is not the big quake," Shah
said, leaning over a map of the
California coast. "This quake was
in the southern Santa Cruz moun
tain section.
"The big one is going to happen
in the northern section of the
fault line, the peninsula section
where tension has been building
up along both the San Andreas
and Hayward faults," Shah ex
plained.
Shah pointed to an area in cen
tral California along the San
Andreas fault where many
earthquakes have occurred over
the years.
"This area is described as the
'slow creep,' " Shah said. "Tension
between the two [tectonic] plates
is released frequently here by
smaller quakes.
"But tension has been building
up along the northern part of the
fault for a long time," Shah con
tinued. "There is about a 30 per
cent chance that the big one will
hit in the next 10 to 20 years."
But before last month's quake
hit, experts had figured there was
a 30 percent chance of a quake of
that magnitude hitting where it
did, according to Shah.
"A big event or earthquake hap
pens along the San Andreas fault
every 100 years plus or minus 40
years," Shah said. "And the last
major event along the San
Andreas is considered to be the
1906 quake."
Shah said a temblor along the
Hayward fault, which runs along
the east side of the bay, would
actually do more damage to the
Bay Area than a quake along the
San Andreas fault.
"It would take an 8.3 quake [on
the Richter scale] along the San
Andreas fault to do as much
damage as a 7.0 on the Hayward
fault," Shah said. "But the San
Andreas is capable of an 8.3
quake."
To give some idea of what the
big quake will be like, Shah com
pared it to last month's quake.
"The amount of energy released
by an 8.3 quake will be 50 times
more than this quake," Shah said.
"There will be 10 to 15 times
more motion. Also, this quake
lasted about 10 or 15 seconds, but
the big quake will last for between
40 seconds and a minute."
Shah added that he has learned
there is no such thing as
earthquake-proof, only earth

quake-resistant. He said a big
quake will certainly do a lot of
damage. In fact, Shah is lobbying
Congress to try to make sure that
some of the earthquake relief
funds go toward future preventive
measures.
"The big quake will probably
not collapse many modern build
ings," Shah said. "What we try
to do as engineers is make sure
that, in the event of a quake,
people don't get killed."
According to Shah, Stanford
has a long road ahead of it.
"The University is going to
start looking at buildings system
atically and bringing them up to
a level of life safety," Shah said.
"Without changing the lode of
campus buildings, the University
will put load-resisting systems in
the background to help strengthen
structures, following the advice of
Stanford civil engineers."
Recently, the know-how of Stan
ford's civil engineers has become
available to the public.
Assoc. Civil Engineering Prof.
Weimin Dong and Shah's son,
Hemant Shah, have formed a
company which bought exclusive
rights for three years to market
a software using Stanford's earth
quake information database.
The new company, Risk Man
agement Software, Inc., offers in
vestors, homeowners, insurance
companies and other interested
parties information about the
chances of earthquake damage
happening to specific structures
in California.
A user enters his or her address,
answers a few questions about the
structure itself and then is given
a wide range of information.
Because his son is so involved
in the company, he does not like
to comment about the company
because he sees it as a conflict of
interest. But he noted that the
software system will be the first
one to help homeowners.
Though the software itself is
relatively expensive, he said some
day printouts may be available for
about $100.
If you cannot afford to buy a
computer printout to find out how
safe you are, you might want to
keep your eye out for Shah.
Chances are that when the big
one hits, if you are standing where
he is standing, you will come out
of it all right.

campus buildings, the University
will put load-resisting systems in
the background to help strengthen
structures, following the advice of
Stanford civil engineers."
Recently, the know-how of Stan
ford's civil engineers has become
available to the public.
Assoc. Civil Engineering Prof.
Weimin Dong and Shah's son,
Hemant Shah, have formed a
company which bought exclusive
rights for three years to market
a software using Stanford's earth
quake information database.
The new company, Risk Man
agement Software, Inc., offers in
vestors, homeowners, insurance
companies and other interested
parties information about the
chances of earthquake damage
happening to specific structures
in California.
A user enters his or her address,
answers a few questions about the
structure itself and then is given
a wide range of information.
Because his son is so involved
in the company, he does not like
to comment about the company
because he sees it as a conflict of
interest. But he noted that the
software system will be the first
one to help homeowners.
Though the software itself is
relatively expensive, he said some
day printouts may be available for
about $100.
If you cannot afford to buy a
computer printout to find out how
safe you are, you might want to
keep your eye out for Shah.
Chances are that when the big
one hits, if you are standing where
he is standing, you will come out
of it all right.

Prof. Haresh Shah, chair of the Civil Engineering Department,
discusses the recent earthquake during an interview.
When the recent earthquake hit,
some people turned to God, but
most people turned to Civil En
gineering Prof. Haresh Shah.
Shah is a co-founder of Stan
ford's John A. Blume Earthquake
Center and a renowned earth
quake expert.
"After the earthquake, people
from the Civil Engineering De
partment were out inspecting
buildings, pinpointing damage
and deciding which buildings

could be opened," Shah said. "It
took a whole day and that is why
the University was closed for a
day."
Since the earthquake, Shah's
workload has increased tremen
dously as people have turned to
him for answers. One of his
greatest concerns is that people
in the Bay Area understand that
last month's quake was not the
"big one" that looms like a specter
in the minds of practically every
one who has decided to live along
one of California's several faults.
"Everyone should remember

this is not the big quake," Shah
said, leaning over a map of the
California coast. "This quake was
in the southern Santa Cruz moun
tain section.
"The big one is going to happen
in the northern section of the
fault line, the peninsula section
where tension has been building
up along both the San Andreas
and Hayward faults," Shah ex
plained.
Shah pointed to an area in cen
tral California along the San
Andreas fault where many
earthquakes have occurred over
the years.
"This area is described as the
'slow creep,' " Shah said. "Tension
between the two [tectonic] plates
is released frequently here by
smaller quakes.
"But tension has been building
up along the northern part of the
fault for a long time," Shah con
tinued. "There is about a 30 per
cent chance that the big one will
hit in the next 10 to 20 years."
But before last month's quake
hit, experts had figured there was
a 30 percent chance of a quake of
that magnitude hitting where it
did, according to Shah.
"A big event or earthquake hap
pens along the San Andreas fault
every 100 years plus or minus 40
years," Shah said. "And the last
major event along the San
Andreas is considered to be the
1906 quake."
Shah said a temblor along the
Hayward fault, which runs along
the east side of the bay, would
actually do more damage to the
Bay Area than a quake along the
San Andreas fault.
"It would take an 8.3 quake [on
the Richter scale] along the San
Andreas fault to do as much
damage as a 7.0 on the Hayward
fault," Shah said. "But the San
Andreas is capable of an 8.3
quake."
To give some idea of what the
big quake will be like, Shah com
pared it to last month's quake.
"The amount of energy released
by an 8.3 quake will be 50 times
more than this quake," Shah said.
"There will be 10 to 15 times
more motion. Also, this quake
lasted about 10 or 15 seconds, but
the big quake will last for between
40 seconds and a minute."
Shah added that he has learned
there is no such thing as
earthquake-proof, only earth

quake-resistant. He said a big
quake will certainly do a lot of
damage. In fact, Shah is lobbying
Congress to try to make sure that
some of the earthquake relief
funds go toward future preventive
measures.
"The big quake will probably
not collapse many modern build
ings," Shah said. "What we try
to do as engineers is make sure
that, in the event of a quake,
people don't get killed."
According to Shah, Stanford
has a long road ahead of it.
"The University is going to
start looking at buildings system
atically and bringing them up to
a level of life safety," Shah said.
"Without changing the lode of
campus buildings, the University
will put load-resisting systems in
the background to help strengthen
structures, following the advice of
