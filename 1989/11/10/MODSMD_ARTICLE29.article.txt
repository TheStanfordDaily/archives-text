# Bug expounds on questions, quakes and curious cheeks

### Aram Irwin 
Dear Bug,
Do you really answer real ques
tions? Do your friends make them
all up? Do you make them all up?
Do people ever send you really
dumb questions? Like what?
— Just Checking
Whoa, hold it right there,
Checking. Let's take those ques
tions one at a time:
Do I answer real questions? The
questions I get are certainly real
questions from real folks. Plain
folks, just like you, Checking. As
to whether or not I really answer
them, well, you'll just have to
decide that for yourself.
Do my friends make the ques
tions up? No, my enemies make
them up.
Do people ever send me really
dumb questions? Ahh, I refuse to
answer that question on the
grounds that it might incriminate
me.
Oh High and Mighty Bug,
Do tell. Any good ideas for how
to detect aftershocks?
- All Shook Up
Well, it's about the point when
you can no longer blame your ac
ademic failure on "The Earth
quake." But fear not. Aftershocks
are always a possibility and are
relatively simple to detect.
I recommend building a small
scale, unreinforced concrete and
sandstone model of Memorial
Church. You can be relatively sure

an aftershock has occurred if you
observe the keystones in your
model's arches slippiftg, allowing
the dome to crumble.
If you feel your model lacks the
sensitivity you desire, I suggest
two small towers just to the rear
of the church.
If you're still unsure, write to
me at the Daily or send E-mail
to bug-me on Macbeth. I'm pretty
sensitive when it comes to detect
ing earthquakes, since I have a
fine collection of seismographs
which I keep at institutions of
higher learning scattered across
the globe.
And if you feel I lack the sen
sitivity you desire, I suggest plant
ing two small towers just to the
rear of yourself.
Oh Wondrous and Mighty Bug,
Once, I stumbled upon my 3-

year-old sister, who had taped two
small rocks to her cheeks. "Why?"
I asked. She replied, "If I keep
these on long enough, I'll have
dimples, JUST LIKE YOU!"
Oh, Bug, I found myself unable
to explain to my sister the futility
of her method. What causes my
adorable "cheek dents" and how
come poor sis was not as blessed
as I?
— Monica M. M., Junior
Monica, I talked to David
White, M.D., at the Palo Alto Med
ical Clinic's Department of Plastic
Surgery regarding your unusual
facial attributes.
It seems that your sister and
the rest of the flabby-cheeked,
loose-jowled crowd forming the
msyority of the population are suf
fering from the condition known
as Ronaldus Reaganus Mucho
Jowlus. Luckily, you, unlike your
sis, are blessed- with that peculiar
combination of genes which
causes your face to be stuck to
the muscles underlying your
"cheek dents" and results in
veritable mounds of cuteness
when you try to smile.
So surely, I asked Dr. White,
hordes of homely, dimple-seeking
cute-wanna-be's must be flooding
his office faster than an East Ger
man can drive through Czechoslo
vakia, right? "Uh-uh," responded
Dr. White, "Never had anyone
want those." But upon further
questioning, the good doctor broke
down and admitted that he once
had a Stanford student discuss

dimple-installation with him.
The student never went through
with it, though; Dr. White doesn't
know if dimple enlargement is
really possible. And even if it were,
he said, it seemed like "a long
run for a short slide," which
sounds like the trade-off Gary
Hart made in his '88 campaign
— or was that Jimmy Swaggart?
Of course, it is possible to have
too much of a good thing. Dimple
enlargement may not be possible,
but what about dimple reduction?
After all, those with unus
ually. . .uh. . .developed. . .dimp
les often suffer neck-aches and
chafing from the difficult task of
supporting heavy dimples. What

is one to do?
Dr. White had more positive
news on the dimple-reduction
scene: "You can get rid of the
dimple by excising the dimple
area." I hope Dr. White never be
comes a dermatologist. Imagine
getting rid of pimples through this
slash and burn method.
Although cheek dimples are a
problem area, you can still get
the Superman chin dimple effect.
Your chin can be sliced down the
center, and inserts (duh) inserted
on either side of the slice. Yum.
Sure, chin dimples are hand
some; the only reason Michael
Keaton was a lousy Batman was
because neither his chin nor his

chin dimple were prominent
enough. But remember, the chin
dimple is the result of an incom
plete fusing in the embryo. So is
the cleft palate. So it turns out
Christopher Reeve and the
Hunchback of Notre Dame do
have something in common after
all.
So Monica, unless your sister
wants to go the extra mile, she'll
just have to keep those rocks
taped to her face. Although, as
Dr. White put it, walking around
(or even sitting around) with
rocks on your face is "just likely
to cause some inflammation." Yet
another reason not to get caught
in a rockslide.
