## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
A number of state senators
have accused Stanford of
trying to outmaneuver others
in the competitive battle for
earthquake relief funds, ac
cording to a report in yester
day's Peninsula Times Tribune.
Sen. Bill Lockyer, among the
most vocal critics of the Uni
versity's lobbying efforts in
Sacramento last weekend, said
an institution with an endow
ment the size of Stanford's
"could wait until we take care
of other needs until they get
their hand in the cookie jar. It
just doesn't seem fair."
Lockyer said Stanford repre
sentatives used high-powered
attorneys to pressure legi
slators to remove a $5 million

limit on the amount of aid non
profit institutions could
receive.
The University officials who
did the lobbying were John
Schwartz, vice president and
general counsel, and Larry
Horton, acting vice president
of Public Affairs.
Calling the efforts indecent,
Lockyer said, "Stanford is well
connected, it has loyal alumni,
it's aggressive about seeking
grants, and compared to a shel
ter for tent people, I don't think
it's a fair fight."
Sen. Nicholas Petris, a Stan
ford alumnus, took the side of
the University. "Endowments
are not for the purpose of
earthquake relief," Petris said.
"There's not a school in the
country that has that kind of
endowment."
