## Stanford set to cool ASU 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Going into a familiar situation
this weekend, the Stanford foot
ball team is doing everything it
can to come up with something
other than the familiar result.
When the team meets Arizona
State in Tempe tomorrow it will
be Stanford's fifth Pacific 10 Con
ference game on the road this
year. With the 7 p.m. (MST) start,
it will be the fourth of those five
games to be played at night.
And the Cardinal players and
coaches are hoping that come Sun
day they will be able to say it wets
the team's first road win of the
year.
Over the past season-plus,
Stanford has been a decent 5-5-1
at Stanford Stadium. On the road,
however, the Cardinal is 0-8-1.
This year Stanford has played
tough on the road but hasn't come
away with a win yet. "We've been
in there," Coach Denny Green
said, "but we haven't been able
to make the type of effort needed
to unseat a team playing at
home."
To do it this week, Stanford
will need to have the type of
ground game the team had
against UCLA last week. Al
though the Cardinal barely rushed
for 100 yards as a team, Stanford
was able to move the ball consis
tently on the ground and give the
defense a chance to rest.
The result was inspired play
from the defense, which held
UCLA to only four first downs
and no points in the second half
of Saturday's game. "I've been
very impressed with their defense
— the aggressiveness they have
in chasing the football," ASU
Coach Larry Marmie said.
The Stanford pass rush also
was a positive last week. Stanford
only had 12 sacks in the team's
first eight games but came up
with four against the Bruins.
Offensively Stanford will again
be without fullback Jon Volpe.

Volpe played in the Cardinal's
first two games but has been out
ever since. In other backfield
news, Jay Jay Lasley will get the
starting nod over Galen Foster at
the tailback spot. Lasley started
the Oregon game and ran for 36
yards on five carries before
leaving with a knee iryury that
kept him out of the next four
games. He ran for 25 yards last
week.
"Last week it looked like they
were able to run the ball with
some consistency," Marmie said
of the Cardinal. "I was very im
pressed with the balance they had
against UCLA."
Fullback Scott Eschelman, who
ran for 73 yards last week, ex
plained why Stanford was able to
move the ball on the ground. "Our
offensive line was doing a great
job up front and UCLA's defense
is last in the Pac-10 in rushing

defense," he said. "Those were the
best holes I've had all year."
The last time Stanford went to
Arizona, it was in the season
opener to face the Wildcats. In
that game quarterback Steve
Smith was sacked five times for
29 yards and Stanford had a total
of 34 yards rushing.
The offensive line has improved
dramatically since then, however,
but they will be seriously tested
by a Sun Devil defense that has
recorded 25 sacks so far this year.
The game will also give the
Stanford players a chance to con
tinue to make good on the vow
of winning the team's last three
games to build momentum for
next year. "I want to see Stanford
get back to its glory days," Es
chelman said. "Win a lot of ball
games, have it be expected that
we'll have winning seasons every
year."


Chris Eisenberg — Daily
Tailback Galen Foster has been a pleasant surprise for the Cardinal this season. After being converted
from defensive back four weeks ago, Foster has run for 108 yards, including Stanford's longest run
of the season, a 45-yarder against Utah.
