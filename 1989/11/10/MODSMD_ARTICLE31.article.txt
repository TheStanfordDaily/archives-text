SERIES — The Sun Devils lead the series 5-3 but Stanford won handily
at Stanford Stadium last year. Arizona State got an early field goal but
the Cardinal came back with 24 unanswered points for a 24-3 win Jason
Palumbis was 23-for-32 with one touchdown passing and one rushing
in the game and Volpe ran for 99 yards. The Cardinal defense picked
off five passes and held the Sun Devils to 91 yards on the ground.
SUN DEVIL UPDATE — Quarterback Paul Justin has thrown for 873 yards
in his last two games and has been the hottest quarterback in the Pac-10.
He came into the Stanford game last year as a sub and has started
every game since then for ASU The Sun Devil ground attack should
also be strong tomorrow as Winsley is almost fully healthy He is their
leading rusher on the year despite being only 5-foot-6.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Quarterback Brian Johnson will be starting for the
Cardinal again this week as Stanford is looking for its first road win since
1987. In the two games Johnson has started this season, Stanford is
2-0. Johnson will face an ASU defense that has given up points in
bunches this year. The Devils have been tagged for 71 points in the last
two games alone, but the offense has scored enough to pull out the
win. Meanwhile, the Stanford offense has only managed to score more
than 18 points twice in nine games.
