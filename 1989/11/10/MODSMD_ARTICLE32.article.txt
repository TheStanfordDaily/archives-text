The eyes of the national swimming
audience have focused on two particular
men's teams for the past five seasons.
With the beginning of this season, their
eyes will be focused on an intense rivalry
between the same two teams.
At noon Saturday, the Stanford men's
swimming team will open the 1989-90
season against defending national cham

pion Texas at deGuerre Pool. At last
season's NCAA Championships, Texas
swam to a 79-point victory over the
second-place Cardinal.
"The important thing with our team
is not whether we win or lose in the
NCAA Championship, but how we
prepare and how the team works to

gether," Coach Skip Kenney said. "The
excitement of this year's team is how well
this team has worked together from the
outset of the year."
The Cardinal lost only three swimmers
— Jay Mortenson, John Hodge and Kevin
Jacques — from last year's squad to grad
uation and has added a talented core of
recruits to the team. Stanford will look
for freshmen Erik Maurer, J.J. Freitag,
Chas Morton, and Cary McConlogue to
challenge the Longhorn swimmers.
"We are really excited about the po
tential of this freshman class," Kenney
said. "It may not be this year for all of
them, but if they perform to their po
tential, it'll be a great year for Stanford."
The efforts of two experienced Cardinal
swimmers, sophomore Jeff Rouse and
senior John Witchel, will play a critical
role in Stanford's success. Rouse, ranked
No. 1 in the world in the 100-meter back

stroke, will start his trek to defend his
NCAA championship in the 200 back
stroke against Texas. He will also swim
the backstroke leg of the medley relay
team.
Witchel, a U.S. national teammate of
Rouse and the 1988 NCAA champion in
the 500 freestyle, swam in the 200, 500
and 1650 freestyles in last season's
NCAAs.
Nine other All-Americans will create
the backbone of the Cardinal squad.
Sophomores Jason Plummer and Alex
Kostich and seniors Lunn Lestina, Jeff
Garr, Byron Burson and Doug Lillydahl
each attained All-America status in free
style while sophomore Josh Mikesell,
junior Matt Rodgers and senior Rick
Gould reached the pinnacle in the back
stroke, breaststroke and backstroke,
respectively.
The Longhorns will bring a strong

squad, including two of last season's
NCAA champions, with them to
deGuerre. Shaun Jensen triumphed in
the 100 freestyle, and Kirk Stackle won
the 200 breaststroke. The Longhorn
freshman class includes Brandon
Gardner, a two-time high school All-
American, Jonathan Jennings, the Junior
Olympic Champion in the 100 backstroke,
and Dan Watters, a member of the 1988
U.S. Olympic Team. However, Watters,
the Longhorns' top recruit, will not make
the trip to Stanford.
Last season, on its way to a 7-2 dual
meet mark, the Cardinal fell in its
opening meet of the season by a score of
60-53 to Michigan. The Cardinal
rebounded, before placing second at
NCAAs, to mark up its eighth consecutive
Pac-10 title. A strong showing against
the Longhorns would allow Stanford to
make an early statement for this season.
