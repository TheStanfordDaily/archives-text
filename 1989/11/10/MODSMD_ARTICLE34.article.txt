# Spikers ready to rebound in Arizona

### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
Aflter playing three top-10 teams
in a row, the Stanford women's
volleyball team will be happy to
travel to lowly Arizona State
tonight and Arizona on Sunday
for a breather. Right?
Wrong. Although the Sun
Devils have a 3-11 Pacific 10 Con
ference record and are in eighth
place, tonight's match in Tempe
will not be an easy one for the
Cardinal. Sunday afternoon's
match against the No. 10 Wildcats
will be even more difficult.
"Even though we've always
been successful (in Arizona], it's
not been easy," Stanford Coach
Don Shaw said. "(Arizona is] play
ing very well. They're ranked
pretty high [and] they know that
they need to be successful against
us because there's a good chance
we could see them again [in the
NCAAs]."
Shaw points to some factors
that will work against the Cardi
nal in Tempe tonight. First, he
expects Arizona State to start
Mindy Gowell at outside hitter.
Gowell, one of the Devils' top
players, has suffered from ir\juries
throughout her collegiate career
and has never played against
Stanford.
"[Gowell] hasn't played full
time against us yet since she's
been at Arizona State," Shaw said.
"She was an outstanding recruit
out of high 5ch001.... I really
don't know what to expect with
her playing all the way around."
If Gowell does play, her return
will certainly be welcomed by the
rest of the Sun Devils, who have

lost seven consecutive conference
matches since they last won one
in early October. Middle blocker
Sue Nord has carried ASU this
year with a .264 hitting percent
age and 109 blocks. Senior setter
Noelle Fridrich, who won All-
America third-team honors last
season, orchestrates the Devil at
tack.
Although Stanford won its last
match against Arizona in four
games Oct. 13, Sunday after
noon's match will likely be more
difficult. Arizona had climbed to
a No. 6 ranking last week (one
place higher than Stanford) before
losing at Washington last Friday.
Stanford holds a 17-1 advantage
in the series.
Although the Wildcats hit for a
very low percentage in the teams'
last match, Arizona is loaded with
big guns. Outside hitter Terry
Lauchner is hitting .269 and leads
the team with 349 kills. Caylin
Combs, the 'Cats other outside
hitter, has tallied 299 kills and
216 digs
