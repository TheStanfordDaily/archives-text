# Water polo hosts underrated Pacific
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The water polo match at
deGuerre Pool tomorrow be
tween No. 4 Stanford and No.
10 Pacific will not offer as
much top-notch competition as
the swim meet between No. 2
Stanford and the top-ranked
Longhorns of Texas that it
precedes, but don't let that stop
you from seeing the game. Ac
cording to Coach Dante Det
tamanti, the 11 a.m. game
should be worth seeing.
"I think it will be a good
game to watch," Dettamanti
said. "They are a pretty decent
team; every one of their losses
has come against top-nine
teams."
The Tigers have lost 13
games this season as compared
to seven wins. Two of those
losses have come at the hands
of 24-7 Stanford. The Cardinal
boat Pacific 9-4 in September,
and then again two weeks ago
at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence/Big West tournament, 14-
5. With this past history it is
no wonder that Dettamanti
worries about his team's atti
tude.
"We were pretty pumped up
to play them in the tourna
ment, because it was our first
game," Dettamanti said "But
now the guys probably won't
be that up."
Dettamanti has been using

this week as a conditioning
stepping stone for the Califor
nia game and the NCAAs. The
"Big Splash" occurs at
deGuerre the morning of Big
Game, and the national tour
nament is two weeks away in
Indianapolis, Ind. Dettamanti
admits his team will be a little
more tired than the visiting
Tigers due to a number of hard
practices.
"It will be an interesting
game," Dettamanti said. "If we
don't play right, anybody can
beat us."
Dettamanti says the game
will give people the chance to
see the "future" of Stanford
water polo. Freshmen Chip
Blankenhorn, John
Matarangas and Bob Stemfels
will get more minutes than
usual against a Pacific team
that is good, but not great.
"They have a lot of good polo
players," Dettamanti said. "But
they don't have any super
stars."
Dettamanti still maintains
that his team is also devoid of
that "superstar," but still could
have more than its share of
All-Americans this year. Det
tamanti is confident that goalie
Todd Kemp is the best player
at that position in the country
this season and that Rick
McNair and Jeff Oeding could
receive All-American votes.
McNair and Oeding are 1-2
in scoring thus far at 44 and
42 goals respectively.
