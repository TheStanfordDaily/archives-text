# Fencers host West Coast meet
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
A collection of the West Coast's finest
fencers will converge this weekend in the
Stanford Collegiate Open at Old Pavilion
in the first competition of the season for
the Cardinal fencers.
The men's foil opens the proceedings to
morrow at 8:30 a.m., followed by epee at
11 a.m., while the women's foil is scheduled
for Sunday at 8:30 a.m. and the men's
sabre at 10 a.m.
This weekend's tournament, which is not
an NCAA-sanctioned event and thus will
not count in final standings, will be con
tested on an individual rather than a team
basis, giving all Stanford fencers a chance
to enter the strip.
Men'B Coach Zoran Tulum, who lost two
thirds of last year's squad to graduation,
said that because many Cardinal fencers
will be competing for the first time, "This
competition is important because we'll see
who can deal with mental pressure and
who has the will to win; who is a fighter."
Among the returnees for the men are
sophomores Nick Bravin and Leonard
D'Amico, who racked up individual honors
last season. Bravin, who specializes in foil,
and D'Amico, who fights sabre, each are

favored to win their respective divisions
this weekend.
Bravin, ranked second nationally in the
under-20 category, said the tournament will
serve as "a good competitive tuneup for
the season."
The women's competition, which consists
only of the foil division, will feature the
debut of highly-regarded freshman Lana
Kang, a top recruit from the East Coast
who will challenge for the individual title.
Women's Coach Sherry Posthumus said
that while the team "will be looking to win
across the board," the tournament will also
be a good opportunity to size up the team's
talent.
Although most U.S. fencing is concen
trated on the East Coast, this weekend's
tournament will draw close to 100 fencers
from Brigham Young, UC-Santa Cruz, and
other West Coast schools where the sport's
popularity is growing.
"We're trying to support fencing compe
tition on the West Coast and to give West
ern fencers a chance to get some
experience," Tulum said.
The format in each weapon division will
consist of two preliminary round-robin
pools, from which 16 fencers will be seeded
for double-elimination competition to de
termine a champion.
