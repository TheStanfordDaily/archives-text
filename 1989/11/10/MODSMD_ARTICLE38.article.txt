Though the official start of the wom
en's tennis season is three months away,
seven of the Cardinal netters will be in
action today at the Rolex Regional Qual
ifying Tournament in the Stanford Ten
nis Stadium. Play begins at 8 a.m.
The two finalists in the 56-player
tournament, which continues through
Monday, will be awarded spots at the
Rolex Championships in Minneapolis
this coming February.
A strong Stanford contingent is led by
two-time All-American Teri Whitlinger,
the tournament's No. 2 seed. Joining
Whitlinger are senior Valerie Wilson,
sophomores Kylie Johnson and Carina
Rolley, and freshmen Heather Willens
and Mario Carruth. Johnson and Willens
are the fifth and sixth seeds, respective
ly. Seeded players receive first-round
byes.
The other seeds are California's Lisa
Albano (No. 1), Jean Marie Lozano (No.
3), Emilie Viqueira (No. 4) and Tiffany

Silveria (No. 8). University of the Pacific
standout Lisa Matsushima is seeded
seventh.
In opening-round action, Carruth will
take on Idaho's Cathy Shanander, Wil
son will meet Mai Ichikawa of Washing
ton and Rolley will do battle with Tracey
King of Nevada-Reno.
Second-round matches are slated for
this afternoon so those advancing will
play two singles matches today. In ad
dition, first-round doubles are on the
agenda.
There are three Cardinal doubles
teams competing in the 26-duo draw —
including two seeded pairs — No. 4 Car
ruth and Lisa Green and No. 5 Johnson
and Willens. Finally, Wilson and Rolley
will team up.
Card notes
Sandra Birch, Debbie Graham, Meredith
McGrath and Green have all qualified for
the Role* Championships already which is
why they won't be competing in singles.
Cal is bringing 12 players to the event, by
far the largest number from one school.
