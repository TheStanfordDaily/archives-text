# Cardinal basketball teams open their 1989-90 campaigns
## Top-ranked women open Sunday with sights set on Final Four 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Sunday afternoon, while many
will be sitting in their living rooms
watching football or sitting in
Green Library studying CIV, a po
tential national champion will
take the floor of Maples Pavilion
to show its stuff.
The squad in question — Stan
ford's women'B basketball team —
begins its quest for an NCAA
crown with an exhibition against
the Spanish National Team.
TipofT is at 2:30 p.m.
"We're anxious to start," Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "We want
to see where we are in relation
to another team" as opposed to
playing against each other in prac
tice.
VanDerveer noted that eight
members of the Stanford team
played international basketball
this summer so they should be
used to the rough and tumble
style of play.
The U.S. Junior National team,
which included Cardinal stand
outs Sonja Henning and Julie
Zeilstra, was defeated by the
Spaniards. "They're a very phys
ical team. They have very expe
rienced players," VanDerveer
added.

And, while she pointed out the
game is "not as exciting as a real
opener," the Cardinal is looking
at it as an opportunity to get some
quality work in.
"It'll help us look at different
combinations ... to see who plays
well with each other," VanDerveer
said, adding she hoped "everyone
on our team will be able to play."
Stanford is led by Jennifer Azzi,
the nation's only returning All-
American. Other returning
starters include: Henning, the
team's point guard and court gen
eral; Katy Steding, a dangerous
outside shooter; and Trisha
Stevens, a dominant force in the
blocks.
The starting center job may
eventually be filled by freshman
Val Whiting, a hard-nosed player
who is expected to provide a new,
physical element to the Cardinal.
Another freshman with impact
potential is high-school All-
American Molly Goodenbour, a
5-foot-6 guard.
The Women's Basketball News
Service tabbed the Cardinal as the
top team in the land and named
Azzi as the preseason player of
the year. Street and Smith's rates
the squad as No. 2 in Division
I-A while Dick Vitale places Stan
ford at No. 4.

Sophomore Adam Keefe is expected to spend a lot of time above
the rim this season for the Cardinal.
