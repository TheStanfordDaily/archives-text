## Stanford negotiates new agreement with publishers 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Stanford professors wishing to
make course readers containing
copyrighted material now have
greater freedom and reduced fear
of being slapped with a lawsuit
by a publisher, due to a new
licensing agreement with various
publishing companies.
Although Stanford has never
been sued for copyright infringe
ment, a crackdown on other uni
versities that make course readers
led Stanford to negotiate a new
licensing agreement with the
Copyright Clearing Center, an or
ganization created by several pub

lishing companies.
Under the new agreement,
Stanford faculty, staff and stu
dents may reproduce copyrighted
material in excess of the normal
legal limitations of the copyright
law, said Iris Brest, staff counsel
at the University's Office of the
General Counsel.
Stanford has been negotiating
for this type of agreement for
several years. According to Brest,
Stanford is only the second uni
versity to obtain this kind of
blanket licensing agreement.
The agreement applies to the
copyrighted works of approxi
mately 20 U.S. publishers and a
variety of others in the United

Kingdom. Generally, if a publisher
is party to this agreement, most
of the copyrighted works owned
by the publisher will be included
in the license. However, publish
ers may restrict the copying of
specific works.
According to Brest, the Copy
right Clearing Center was created
by publishers to centralize the
licensing of photocopying and
reproduction of copyrighted ma
terial. Recently, the center began
a program of granting blanket
licenses to various commercial
and research and development
agencies to allow these agencies
greater freedom to reproduce this
information.
She emphasized that the agree
ment is still in the experimental
stage, and the exact extent of
copying the licensing agreement
allows has not yet been deter
mined. The licensing agreement
would not permit the reproduc
tion of an entire book, for example.
The legal questions involved in
making course readers that use
copyrighted material stem from
problems of interpreting the "fair
use" standards of the copyright
law, according to Stanford Law
Prof. Paul Goldstein.

These standards determine the
situations in which it is legally
permissible to reproduce copy
righted material without the ex
press permission of the publisher.
Goldstein said that because
most of the cases in which pub
lishers have sued universities or
copy centers have been settled out
of court, there is no benchmark
for determining whether course
readers violate the law.
Under the copyright law, copy
righted materials may be
reproduced as a fair use for the
purposes of criticism, comment,
news reporting and teaching, in
cluding multiple copies for class
room use.
There are four specific criteria
for determining whether copying

constitutes fair use. The first
question is the purpose and the
character of the use. Copying for
commercial purposes might not
be considered fair use, while
copying for educational purposes
might, Goldstein said.
Secondly, the nature of the
copyrighted work must be consid
ered. Copying a fictional work
might be evaluated differently
from copying a scientific work,
Goldstein said.
The substantiality of the use of
the copyrighted material is also a
factor. Small excerpts are usually
acceptable, but copying an entire
work would probably not con
stitute fair use, according to
Goldstein.
The final factor is the effect of

the use upon the potential market
of the copied work. Goldstein ex
plained that if copying a work
would adversely affect the pub
lisher's sale of the work, it prob
ably would not be considered fair
use.
The complexity of these issues
forced the directors of ASSU Lec
ture Notes to decide last June to
discontinue their production and
sale of course readers.
Loosmore mentioned that a law
suit filed last May against Kinko's
Copies for copying readers by
eight msyor publishers was an
other important reason for the
decision.
Loosmore said the lecture notes
service has no plans at this time
to resume making course readers.
