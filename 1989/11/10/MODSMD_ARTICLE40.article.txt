# Men hoping younger is better
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
After completing the second
best season in school history last
year, the Cardinal men's basket
ball team returns to the court for
the first time tonight.
Much like last season, the team
will open with an exhibition
against the Brewster Heights
(Wash.) club team at Maples Pa
vilion at 7:30 tonight. Unlike last
year, however, Stanford is not a
known commodity. The team
graduated six seniors from last
year's squad and will take the
floor tonight with only one re
turning starter, junior forward
Andrew Vlahov.
Despite the youth, however,
Coach Mike Montgomery is
looking forward to the season.
"We're making progress," he said.
"Last year we were really ready
to play when the season started.
This year it will take a lot
longer. . . . With eight freshmen
your progress is going to be a lot
slower."
The top returnees for the Car
dinal this season will likely be the
6-foot-7 Vlahov and 6-9 sopho
more Adam Keefe. Vlahov, a 1988
Australian Olympian, has been a
starter most of the past two years
at small forward. Last year he
averaged 5.1 points and 3.4

rebounds per game.
Keefe, who also plays volleyball
for Stanford's top-five team, was
a member of the Pacific 10 Con
ference All-Freshman team. Com
ing off the bench at center and
power forward last year he
averaged more than eight points
and five boards per game. In Stan
ford's four postseason games
Keefe had more points and more
rebounds than any Stanford
player, including NBA first-round
draft choice Todd Lichti.
With swingman Deshon Win
gate returning from Europe after
touring with a Pac-10 All-Star
team over the summer, the front
court looks good. The back court,
however, is a question mark after
the Cardinal's top three guards
graduated.
John Patrick is the only retur
nee with any experience in the
back court, but juco transfer
Kenny Ammann and freshmen
Peter Dukes, Marcus Lollie and
Kenny Hicks will also contribute.
Walk-on Mike Morris may also see
action.
"I expect through December
we'll be looking at different
people," Montgomery said. "The
starting lineup will change a lot.
No spot is guaranteed. Vlahov
isn't guaranteed; Keefe isn't guar
anteed."
