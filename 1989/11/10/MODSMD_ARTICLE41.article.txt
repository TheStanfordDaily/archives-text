The Cardinal cross country
teams will face do-or-die compe
tition at the NCAA District 8
Championship Meet tomorrow at
Fresno.
Stanford will depend on a corps
of seniors, who will be running in

their last meet unless they qualify
for the NCAA Championships.
The top two teams in the men's
and women's races along with the
next fastest three individuals will
advance to the national champi
onship race.
The men's team will need to
pull together for a second-place
finish, led by seniors Eric and

Mark Mastalir and Bill Crowley.
Eric Mastalir will be a favorite to
earn an individual spot, while
Stanford's other runners will
probably depend on the team's
finish.
Oregon, ranked second nation
ally, is almost a lock for the win.
The competition for the final
qualifying spot will come from Ar

izona, Washington and perhaps
California.
In the women's race, All-
American Carol Gray and team
mate Melanie Bloch will challenge
for top spots. Gray, a senior, took
second in this race last year and
Bloch is planning to stay with her
this week.
Gray was fifth in the Pacific

10 Conforence Championships
meet two weeks ago, but would
not have made the NCAA meet
based on that performance.
Stanford would need personal
bests from the rest of the team
to stay in the women's race, ac
cording to Coach Scott Chisam.
While besting UC-Irvine and most

of the Pac-10 would be hoping for
too much, he expects the team
will make a strong showing.
The competition will be a fast,
flat 10 kilometer race for the men
and five kilometers for the wom
en. After racing at eight kilome
ters in the Pac-10 meet, the dis
trict meet will be a slower, more
tactical race for the men.
