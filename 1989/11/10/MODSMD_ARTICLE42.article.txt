# Donald Kennedy tries to improve the Greek's standing
## 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
ington the previous week, is going
to the well again, tabbing Oregon
State to upset the Huskies.
Among the denizens of the
lower floors, David Hirning ap
pears to be making a bid to get
back into the race. Sparked by
Princeton and Brigham Young,
Hirning went 7-3 to get himself
within five games of the lead.
Meanwhile, a 6-4 week was good
enough to get Greg Gottesman
out of last place. He managed to
move into a tie with Dave Earnest,
three games behind Hirning. Ear
nest, a Denver native, does get
brownie points for having hyped
the Colorado Buffaloes all year
long.
The season has only two weeks
left, so each and every game
counts a lot. That makes it
strange that Cousins should go
out and pick Arizona to upset
USC and BYU to sneak past Air
Force. Perhaps he knows some
thing that no one else does. Per
haps not.
Kennedy, however, definitely
knows something everyone else
doesn't. As a traditional Guest
Greek selection he has put to
gether a sterling record through
the years. He decided to go the
straight party line this week,
being unable to find any good up
set picks.
"The upset of the week will be
if Air Force and BYU don't score
80 points," he said.
Until next week, don't bet on
SMU against Notre Dame.

With the football season wind
ing down, each and every Greek
game becomes of paramount im
portance. Joining The Daily All-
Stars this week in an effort to
elevate the Guest Greek to the
top, University President Donald
Kennedy has put his pride on the
line this week.
In an odd coincidence, Kennedy
was the Guest Greek last year
prior to the Stanford-ASU con
test. He correctly picked a Cardi
nal victory in that one and
finished the week 7-3, good
enough to move the Guest into
sole possession of the lead.
This year he could very well do
the same as the double G is
lurking a scant two games off the
pace. Mark Rogowsky continues
to hold on to his lead, but after
a 5-5 week he has found it a bit
more crowded at the top.
Longtime pursuer Nat Cousins
is only a game off the pace at
39-21 after going 7-3 last week.
Cousins continues his attempts to
make friends on the football team
by picking against the Cardinal
for the third time this season.
Perhaps a job will open up at The
Daily Californian for Mr. Cousins
to take. ...
Also in a tie for second is Chris
Crader. Crader went 9-1 last week
and was the only one to correctly
prognosticate an Arizona State
victory over Washington. Crader,
