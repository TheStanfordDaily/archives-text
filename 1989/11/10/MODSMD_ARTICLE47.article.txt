# Health plan expenditures rising
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
The University needs to alter
its health care policy to keep up
with sharp increases in medical
costs, the Committee on Faculty
and Staff Benefits told the Faculty
Senate yesterday afternoon.
Stanford will spend $17.1 mil
lion on employee health and med
ical plans in 1989, according to
the committee's report. And if
Stanford follows national trends,
the University could be paying
$20.5 million in 1990, an increase
of $3.4 million.
The committee investigated
ways to limit the increased med
ical plan expenditures to $2 mil
lion next year, although this
increase would still amount to 12
percent, more than twice the ex
pected rise in salaries.
The committee attributed Stan
ford's health care crisis to several
factors, including the present
policy of covering the expenses of
employees purchasing insurance
from any University-approved

company regardless of the cost.
Some employees are choosing a
more expensive insurance com
pany over a less expensive one
because they are using the Uni
versity's money and not their own,
committee chair Alain Enthoven
said.
"People are not making cost
conscious choices," said Enthoven,
a professor in the Graduate School
of Business.
The committee proposes that
the University pay the cost of the
least expensive coverage and let
employees pay the difference if
they want a higher-priced cover
age.
"There's a perception that
throwing money at doctors will
get you better medical service, but
the opposite is often true," En
thoven said. "In many cases,
quality and economy go hand in
hand."
The committee proposed to
charge patients $10 for doctor's
office visits. Faculty and staff cov
ered under the present system pay
nothing.

"When people have to pay, they
go to the doctor less," Enthoven
said. "And when they go to the
doctor less, they go to the hospital
less â€” with no discernable harm
to their health."
Enthoven predicted that health
care will be a collective bargaining
issue.
The report did not require a
vote by the senate because rec
ommendations from University
committees are handled by the
administration.
In other business, the Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement presented its annual
report to the senate.
In the upcoming year, the com
mittee will re-evaluate the No
Credit grade mark. The commit
tee will meet with concerned fac
ulty and students next quarter
and will survey faculty to see if
the No Credit mark has been
abused.
In the other action, the Faculty
Senate unanimously approved a
proposal for a graduate degree
program in Developmental Biol
ogy.
