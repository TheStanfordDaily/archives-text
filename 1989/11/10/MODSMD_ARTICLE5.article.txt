# Licensing Office has grown into moneymaking powerhouse

Editor's note: This is the final article of
a three-part series on the transfer of tech
nology from university laboratories to
private industry.

It began in 1970 as a relatively small
operation, earning a mere $55,000.
Nearly two decades later, in fiscal year
1989, Stanford's Office of Technology
Licensing earned $11.5 million by licens
ing faculty research to private industry
for development into marketable prod
ucts.
How has the office grown to such a
moneymaking powerhouse, far surpass-

ing any other school in such a relatively
short period of time?
Before 1970, faculty research that
resulted in marketable inventions was
patented and transferred to industry by
Research Corporation Technologies, a
Tucson, Ariz., company that still provides
the same service to many small schools
nationwide.
Jon Sandelin, an associate at the licens
ing office, said Stanford decided to move

the operation to campus mainly because
technology transfer is most successful
when carried out close to the source of
the invention.
It is important for the licensing office,
the inventor and the business exploiting
the technology to maintain close contact
throughout the transfer, he explained.
Faculty detached from industry
However, some faculty who have re
cently made discoveries utilized by private
firms say their contact with the licensing
industry has been limited.
Stanley Cohen, whose pioneering work
in genetics with Herbert Boyer of UC-San
Francisco has been licensed to many com
panies and generated millions of dollars

for Stanford and the UC
system, said the licensing
office handles virtually
all the marketing of the
research. Cohen added
that he is only involved
in the legal matters.
The licensing office,
"not me personally, has
been responsible for
transferring recom-

binant DNA methods to industry," he
wrote in a facsimile interview with The
Daily. "Since I have not been involved at
all in the marketing of the process, it
follows that it has not taken up any of
my current research time.
"What has taken up some time is the

discussions with Stan
ford's attorneys in con
nection with their
preparation of the Uni
versity's patent applica
tions," he wrote.
Richard Roth, also of
the Medical School, said
the transfer of his devel
opment of monoclonal
antibodies to Oncogen

Co. of New York, though far less lucrative
than Cohen's process, was handled exclu
sively by the Office of Technology Licens
ing.
