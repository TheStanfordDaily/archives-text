# Licensing Office has grown into moneymaking powerhouse

### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the final article of
a three-part series on the transfer of tech
nology from university laboratories to
private industry.

It began in 1970 as a relatively small
operation, earning a mere $55,000.
Nearly two decades later, in fiscal year
1989, Stanford's Office of Technology
Licensing earned $11.5 million by licens
ing faculty research to private industry
for development into marketable prod
ucts.
How has the office grown to such a
moneymaking powerhouse, far surpass-

ing any other school in such a relatively
short period of time?
Before 1970, faculty research that
resulted in marketable inventions was
patented and transferred to industry by
Research Corporation Technologies, a
Tucson, Ariz., company that still provides
the same service to many small schools
nationwide.
Jon Sandelin, an associate at the licens
ing office, said Stanford decided to move

the operation to campus mainly because
technology transfer is most successful
when carried out close to the source of
the invention.
It is important for the licensing office,
the inventor and the business exploiting
the technology to maintain close contact
throughout the transfer, he explained.
Faculty detached from industry
However, some faculty who have re
cently made discoveries utilized by private
firms say their contact with the licensing
industry has been limited.
Stanley Cohen, whose pioneering work
in genetics with Herbert Boyer of UC-San
Francisco has been licensed to many com
panies and generated millions of dollars

for Stanford and the UC
system, said the licensing
office handles virtually
all the marketing of the
research. Cohen added
that he is only involved
in the legal matters.
The licensing office,
"not me personally, has
been responsible for
transferring recom-

binant DNA methods to industry," he
wrote in a facsimile interview with The
Daily. "Since I have not been involved at
all in the marketing of the process, it
follows that it has not taken up any of
my current research time.
"What has taken up some time is the

discussions with Stan
ford's attorneys in con
nection with their
preparation of the Uni
versity's patent applica
tions," he wrote.
Richard Roth, also of
the Medical School, said
the transfer of his devel
opment of monoclonal
antibodies to Oncogen

Co. of New York, though far less lucrative
than Cohen's process, was handled exclu
sively by the Office of Technology Licens
ing.
"I didn't feel I played an integral role

[in the transfer]," Roth said. "I
didn't deal with it at all. Three
or four companies came to us, but
Stanford does all the negotia
tions."
This lack of involvement was
echoed by William Yeager, who de
veloped computer networking
software that is now a basis for
some of Cisco Systems Inc.'s com
mercial products.
"Once the product began, that
is, the software was packaged, we
had very little else to do with it,
except for the apportioning of
royalties among those who worked
on it," Yeager said.
He added that the licensing of
fice exerted a great deal of effort
to make sure that the software
was a "clean package" and did
not violate copyright laws. He also
said he made no contact at all
with officials from the Menlo
Park-based Cisco during the en
tire transfer process.
Publicity: crucial and difficult
Many businesses seem to be at

tracted to Stanford because the
licensing office extensively
publicizes the results of research
discoveries here.
One company that capitalized
on research performed here was
California Biotechnology Inc. of
Mountain View, which uses the
Cohen and Boyer methods for
recombinant DNA as fundamental
technology.
"You can't be in the [biotech
nology industry! and not know
Cohen and Boyer," said John
Newman, the company's vice pres
ident. "Stanford made it well
known."
Still, Niels Riemars, director of
Stanford's licensing office, admits
it is often difficult to attract po
tential licensees for several
reasons.
Perhaps the largest obstacle is
a lack of a decision-making pro
cesses in many businesses, he
said. Many vice presidents in
charge of research, already com
plaining of limited research and
development funds, are often re
luctant to take on new projects,
such as exploiting university
generated technology.
Riemars said many firms that
explore potential license agree

ments but end up declining rarely
give reasons for their decisions,
making improvement of advertis
ing more difficult.
"It's easy for big companies to
throw away money, and little ones
need startup technology," said Mel
Kronick, program manager at Ap
plied Biosystems Inc. in Foster
City, which licenses a cell-staining
technology developed at Stanford.
"Middle-size companies like ours
must be extremely cautious,
though."
While businesses can be diffi
cult about paying for technology,
and professors and other re
searchers are generally detached
from the marketing of their in
ventions, the transfer process still
takes place â€” successfully and
lucratively.
The professionals who quietly
work out of an unassuming build
ing at the Office of Technology
Licensing, gradually building up
contacts with high tech firms and
advertising research break
throughs, seem to make the dif
ference in whether technology can
spread from a basement labora
tory to a private manufacturer
and eventually to the open mar
ket.
