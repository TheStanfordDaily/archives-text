# ASSU nearly denies student-group funds
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
In a heated debate last night, the
ASSU Senate nearly denied the Program
Board budget approving funds for
campus student groups.
But the bill, needing a two-thirds
majority, passed in a narrow 8-3 roll
call vote.
The controversy started when senator
Enrique Origgi proposed an amendment
to remove funding for the Stanford Cen
tral America Action Network and the
Democratic Socialist Association from
the Program Board bill.
Origgi felt the two groups were in
violation of a ASSU Senate Administra
tion and Rules Committe memorandum
stating that the Program Board should
not fund any "strictly partisan political
activities."
"There's a very solid argument that

the Democratic Socialist Association is
a partisan organization," Origgi said.
He also alleged that SCAAN was "in
violation" of the memorandum.
But senator Stacey Leyton did not
agree. "We are not funding any activities
that are politically partisan commit
tees," she said.
Leyton characterized the amendment
as a politically motivated opposition to
left-leaning organizations, and said that
"for [the senate) to be playing political
games with student groups ... is totally
irresponsible."
Senate Member Maria Saldana con
curred. "You can't excise this because
it doesn't agree with your political
views," she said.
But with the backing of Students First
members Kevin Warsh, Jorge Velazquez
and John Abbot, Origgi questioned the
political motivation of other senators.
"Are these groups getting money be

cause someone is favoring them?" he
asked.
The amendment failed in a 7-4 vote.
In other senate action, a Council of
Presidents bill resolving that the senate
sponsor a community forum bringing
together Tresidder Union management
and United Stanford Workers Union
members passed on a divided voice vote.
COP member Aimee Allison said "the
purpose of the bill will be to have the
Tresidder Union management and the
USW there to clarify the problems at
Tresidder Union."
The senate also unanimously voted
to provide $1,000 to help fund the Big
Game party to be held Nov. 17.
The senate also approved a bill to
recognize the American Asian Student
Association's contributions to the Stan
ford community throughout the past 20
years. AASA is celebrating its 20th an
niversary this month.
