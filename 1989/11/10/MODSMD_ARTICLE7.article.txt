An intruder was sighted in women's
bathrooms in Rinconada and LJjamaa
Houses recently, and police said he might
be the same individual seen in Madera
House Oct. 31.
According to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, in the latest incident,
a female student living on the first floor
of Rinconada House saw a naked male

coed bathroom at 2 p.m. Tuesday
The student did not recognize the in
truder and was certain he did not live
in Rinconada. The naked male said noth

her, according to police reports.
The suspect reportedly was a white

male around 20 years old, 5 feet 6 inches
tall and 150 pounds with dirty blond
hair. Although Niemeyer called the
report "very sketchy," he believes this
visitor could be the same person who
was seen watching a female student
taking a shower in Madera Oct. 31.
Another incident took place on the
morning of Nov. 3 in Ujamaa House. A
female student went to the bathroom at
8:30 a.m. and noticed that someone had
defecated on the floor.
Later, the student returned and
noticed that someone appeared to be
lying in the bathroom stalls with his
feet sticking out. The person was
wearing jeans and might have been
asleep. He was also seen by another
