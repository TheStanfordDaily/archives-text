The place to go for
people who know
where EDA is going.
It's VALID. The fastest-growing full-line
supplier of Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) software systems. And the leading
supplier of EDA running under UNIX™
and VMS.
Because if you know where EDA is going,
you know it's heading toward standard
platforms, operating systems and net
works. So that users can mix and match
tools to customize their environment to
meet their exact needs.
Valid's applications software runs on
commercially available hardware systems
(DEC, Sun. Apollo. HP. NEC. IBM and
other personal computer platforms), with
industry standard operating systems
(UNIX and VMS) and networking systems
(Ethernet. TCP/IP. DECnet and NFS). We
are the only full-line supplier to support
this combination of standards.
Our software products are used by
electronic engineers to automate and
accelerate the electronic design process,
increasing engineering productivity,
improving quality and shortening the time
it takes to bring the product to market.
Our applications software packages
address all areas of EDA including
computer-aided engineering (CAE),
computer-aided design (CAD) and
computer-aided test (CAT). More than
12,000 engineers and designers use our
systems worldwide.
You will go far with
VALID.
We're enjoying our best year ever for sales
and profits. Our growth overseas makes us
a major international leader in EDA
VAIJD now has software engineering
opportunities in our Corporate Engineer
ing Group, IC and CAE divisions. EDA is
growing. Make VALID the company where
you will be growing, too.
Find out more.
Look into these current opportunities with
VALID, then apply. Because if you know
where EDA is going, you will get there
first with VALID.
