# Champagne flowing in Berlin as East meets West

Editor's note: The following is the
first of several articles by a Daily staff
writer at Stanford's program in West
Berlin. Several students in the Berlin
program, including the writer, watched
firsthand as more than a million Ger
mans crossed the long-standing barrier
between East and West.

BERLIN — This divided city threw
itself a huge party over the weekend to
celebrate the historic opening of the Ber
lin Wall, which allowed more than
500,000 East German citizens to visit
West Berlin on Saturday night alone.

Ever since word began to spread late
Thursday night that the East German
government had opened borders that
had been closed since the erecting of
the wall in 1961, Berliners from both
sides of the wall began to congregate
joyously around the border.
Champagne flowed freely as people
from the two sides of the same city
greeted each other. For 28 years the
wall has kept neighbors apart, and East
Berliners could only dream of the day
when they would be able to see the
other half of their city.
Masses of people clogged the center
of the city over the weekend. Stanford
senior Erica Wheeler, studying at Stan
ford's West Berlin campus with 38 other

students, said Saturday night, "New
York is mild compared to what Berlin
is like today."
Junior Andrew Frutkin described the
center of the city as a "mob scene." He
added that many East Germans were
sleeping in malls and train stations, per
haps so they could remain the entire
weekend without having to fight the
border traffic.
But preliminary indidcations seem to
be that most East Germans visiting the
city intend to return home. "West Berlin
all of the sudden had thousands of home
less people for a couple of nights. But
they were still happy," Frutkin said.
Indeed, the infrastructure of West
Berlin strained to handle the weekend

traffic. Almost every subway station was
packed to capacity and trains were com
pletely stuffed with people. Many buses
stopped running and those that ran were
so packed that they stopped picking up
passengers.
Stanford senior Greg Zaharchuk de
scribed the city as a "war zone." Huge
lines snaked around banks, where each
each East German was given one hun
dred West German marks (approx
imately $45) as "welcome money," part
of a long-standing policy of the West
German government.
East German law forbids the import
or export of its currency, but people
were not being checked as they crossed
the border. The East Germans were ex

changing their money at a rate of 10-
to-1, making something even as simple
as a map incredibly expensive.
Lines also formed in front of over
crowded stores and restaurants. Wool
worths, McDonald's, Burger King and
the large department stores were
mobbed as East Germans enjoyed the
relative plenty they had seen on West
German television but had never expe
rienced.
Particular favorites were fresh fruits,
Coca-Cola and cosmetics.
"Some people bought literally as much
as they could carry," said junior Mark
ScheefT, who watched East Berliners re
turning from West Berlin.
