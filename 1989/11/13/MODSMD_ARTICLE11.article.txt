# Students 'kill' to raise awareness of Guatemalan situation
## 
### June Cohen 
Lunch hour at Tresidder Union Friday
was interrupted by the mock murder of a
fictional Guatemalan student during a
SCAAN "guerrilla theater" production.
The skit was performed by members of
the Stanford Central America Action Net
work in response to the recent abduction
and murder of 13 Guatemalan students by
the Guatemalan government.
According to SCAAN members, the
group hoped to raise student awareness of
the "terror campaign" being waged by the
Guatemalan government, which currently
receives military aid from the United
States.
At 12:20 p.m., two men dressed in
camouflage, portraying the Guatemalan
soldiers, started making their way through
the tables on the Tresidder patio, shouting,
"Where is Jose Guatemala? We know he
is here," and asking confused onlookers if
they had seen him.
Upon sighting their victim, the soldiers
chased him across the patio and "shot"
him with a cap gun. The two women with
whom he was seated ran after him and
sobbed as his corpse was dragged away by
the soldiers.
"It doesn't concern you. Go back to your
studying," said the character of Uncle Sam,
as he ambled across the patio. "Guatemala
is a democracy."
He then mopped up the "blood" off the
pavement where the student had fallen -and
walked off.
"This happens a lot in Guatemala," ex

plained Diane Nelson, a SCAAN member,
to the attentive crowd. She pointed out
that many students at the University of
San Carlos, in Guatemala City, have been
killed recently, and that the United States
provides a great deal of money to their
government and military.
As U.S. citizens, Nelson said, "we are
responsible for countries which the United
States provides much of the funding for."
The mock killing was the latest install
ment of SCAAN's "guerrilla theater" pro
gram which began last year. "Guerrilla
theater," according to SCAAN director
Steve Levitsky, "is one of our methods of
increasing public awareness.
"Ideally, we'd like to cause a little bit of
shock — but that's too risky. We want to
attract some attention — get people to read
our literature, come to the talks, or just
think twice next time they see Guatemala
in the news."
Most of SCAAN's "guerrilla theater"
work is done in conjunction with dorm
based informational programs. Although
this was only the group's second public
performance this year, the spectator reac
tion seemed to be extremely positive.
"It really caught your attention," said
Cathy Roland, a Stanford student.
Another observer, Rudy Coronado, who
is from Guatemala and who works for the
campus earthquake inspection and repair
team, said he felt a personal connection
with the skit. "It really showed what goes
on there," he said. "Most people here don't
understand, or don't want to know what
goes on."
