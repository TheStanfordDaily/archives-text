## Chances in Chile 
### 
Democracy is moving
around the world, and Stan
ford students can now wit
ness it.
Next spring Overseas Studies
will open a campus in Santiago,
Chile. The opening will signal a
return to the intellectual ex
changes that occurred before Gen
eral Pinochet's military takeover.
While this is a tremendous op
portunity for students, there is still
one concern: safety. The violence
that resulted from Pinochet's loss
in the plebescite could happen
again, and this concerns many stu
dents who might otherwise be in
terested.
Yet Chile was chosen precisely
because it was more safe than
other South American countries.
After coup attempts in Argentina,
the idea of a campus in Buenos
Aires was dropped in favor of a
Chilean exchange.
The opening in Chile will give

students the opportunity to ob
serve firsthand the movement
toward democracy in South
America. Instead of merely reading
news articles, the students can take
courses such as "Transition to De
mocracy" and then walk outside
and see its relevance.
The Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion has expressed reservations
about the freedom of Chilean uni
versities to teach and discuss con
troversial issues. If there is bias
in the program it will be a learning
experience for students to see the
bias and examine why the govern
ment would impose that view on
the students.
It may also help the students to
question the biases involved in
their stateside education.
The Chilean program will offer
a chance to see and learn in a way
that many other overseas cam
puses cannot. Take advantage of
the opportunity to see democracy
on the move.
