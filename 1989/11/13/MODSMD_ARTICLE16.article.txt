# Release the report

IT'S TIME for the University
to come clean on radiation
safety.
Officials in the Office of the
Dean of Research have refuser' to
release a report evaluating Univer
sity policies and procedures on the
handling of radioactive substances.
The report was ordered by the
state's Department of Health Serv
ices after investigators found more
than 30 violations of state and Uni
versity codes during an inspection
in March. The state asked Stanford
to audit its radiation safety pro
gram to determine if the violations
found were symptomatic of system
wide problems.
University officials completed
their work Aug. 31 but have no
intention of making the report
public.

The University usually is not so
difficult about these things. In
fact, this is the first time in two
years that Stanford has refused to
release the findings of any study
of laboratory safety.
This makes its current refusal
suspicious. The community can
only be left wondering: What has
the University to hide?
Given the recent changes in the
Health Physics program — includ
ing removal of its director of 15
years — it is especially important
for the administration to disclose
the details of its safety program.
We all live and work in a com
munity that supposedly is based
on trust. In this respect and in
this incident, the University is
failing us.
