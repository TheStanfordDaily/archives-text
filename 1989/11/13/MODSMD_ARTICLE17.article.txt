Tresidder has sense of business, not of compassion

MEChA IS A Chicano student
organization that struggles to
promote the causes of Chicano
and Latino people. When our people
are suffering an injustice, we are here
to provide support.
Presently, Tresidder Memorial Union
is afflicted with a $210,000 deficit.
Their method of dealing with this has •
been to cut back on the number of
clerical and maintenance workers.
They have offered 30 percent of the
custodial crew the option of transfer
ring, retiring or risking being laid off.
This means that our student union will
suffer even more from understaffing
and lack of resources which will di
rectly affect us.
The cutbacks on the maintenance

crews will cause Tresidder to be less
clean and the reduction of full-time to
half-time clerical positions will delay
the scheduling of rooms for programs.
From Tresidder's point of view, their
decision to cut and reschedule workers
makes a lot of business sense. They
simply save money by reducing work
hours and shuffling workers' shifts.
What they fail to take into account
is the effect these decisions have on
the individuals and their families.
Economic and emotional stability is
disturbed, often negatively affecting the
dynamics of the family and causing
financial strain on already limited
budgets.
The disrespect and indifference to
the workers' needs that many of our

parents' employers showed created a
great deal of anxiety and insecurity in
our family lives. Daily functions such
as grocery shopping and family interac
tion became problems, and at times,
impossibilities.
The case of one member of the
United Stanford Workers stands out as
an example of how Tresidder's deci
sions have profound repercussions.
This worker is trying not only to
make a living for him and his family,
but also better improve his future by
attending school. In recent years, he
has had his hours repeatedly changed
and has had to reschedule his classes
and transfer schools to accommodate
the changes.
Presently, with the new hours Tres-

idder is "offering" him, he will have to
terminate his schooling,
Decisions such as the one Tresidder
has made not only affect the immedi
ate situations of workers, but also
directly restrict their educational,
financial and personal pursuits.
Workers have historically been an
integral element of the Chicano com
munity and their lives have come to
shape the realities of Chicanos today.
We feel that taking an active part in
bettering the lives of workers will
result in progress for our people.
