# Fraternities take up housing without assuring equal access
## 
### 
I appreciate The Daily's request Wed
nesday for a statement of University
commitment to the co-op living option,
and I agree with its definition of that
option as a vitaJ subculture at Stan
ford.
I want to take the argument a step
further by acknowledging the possibil
ity that questions about the future of
the co-op system should force a
reanalysis of fraternities' rights to
occupy and restrict the use of Univer
sity houses because the fraternities set
up their own subjective criteria to de
termine who will live in their houses.
Most agree that it would be unfortu
nate if co-op houses like Synergy,
Columbae and Phi Psi are unable to be
reopened and are not rebuilt, thus
restricting the number of University-

owned houses which would then be
available for the variety of living styles
such as fraternities, co-ops and self
ops.
While the fraternity system does
exist as a vital subculture, it does not
have the right to monopolize Univer
sity housing to the exclusion of other
groups who would use their houses in
ways more in line with stated goals of
the University such as diversity and
equality of access.
While co-ops are truly inclusive and
open to all men and women, under
graduate and graduate alike, and while
they and every other non-fraternal
form of housing on campus are filled
based on the luck of the draw alone,
University-housed fraternities necessar
ily exclude women and those who do
not pass their non-objective, separately
defined membership requirements.
Obviously, this consideration does
not apply to fraternities who own their
own houses.
Different living options should still
be free to compete with one another
for the rights to occupy existing, struc

turally sound houses.
In these times of scarce housing,
fairness dictates that access to these
houses must be decided on the basis of
which housing options are actually
open to all students on an equitable
basis.
