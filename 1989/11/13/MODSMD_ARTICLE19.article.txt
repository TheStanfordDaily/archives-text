# Lack of attention paid to shirtless women not sign of sexual unease
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the arti
cle in Thursday's Daily about Alex,
Judy and Leslie who studied in Tresid
der Memorial Union without wearing
their shirts.
The students about whom the article
was written made several comments
suggesting that their partial strip-tease
act revealed sexual unease in the Stan
ford community.
The following observations are of-

fered as a guide to Alex, Judy and
Leslie to better understand their recent
activity:
First, the reason no one
"confronted" you is because removing
one's shirt is far from a confronta
tional issue. It is not because, as you
suggest, most students are somehow
repressed.
Second, the people who snickered at
you did so not out of repression, but
rather because you probably looked
pretty silly.
I would venture a guess that if you
had doffed your bras as well as your
shirts, you would have found that
fewer people would have repressed
their curiosities.
Third and finally, I notice that even
though you say you are not trying to
make a statement and that your ac
tions were no different than "wear
ing. . .a bathing suit," vou still with
hold your last names. Now, who's
repressed here?
