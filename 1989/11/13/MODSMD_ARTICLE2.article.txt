# New group seeking Chinese democracy
## 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
A newly formed international
umbrella organization dedicated
to the creation of a multiparty
political system in China held its
first Bay Area meeting Saturday
at Stanford.
Although the group, the Front
for Democracy in China, seeks
democratic change for mainland
China, the meeting was primarily
attended by Chinese-Americans
and Chinese from Taiwan. Local
students and scholars from main
land China apparently shied away
from the meeting for fear that
their participation would be re
corded by the Chinese consulate.
In a pre-conference interview,
David Ai, a project manager at
Hewlett-Packard and one of the
six members of the group's North
American board of directors, said
that the long-term goals of the
group are to "protect basic human
rights in China, develop a market
economy sytem, uphold social jus
tice and end one-party rule.''
Ai said the last goal as the most
critical. "If that is accomplished
a lot of things will fall into place,"
he said.
The primary business of Satur
day's meeting was to inaugurate
the new branch by passing bylaws
and electing members to fill the
administrative and supervisory

committees.
This branch was only the sec
ond to be organized in the United
States, following the establish
ment Friday of a chapter in Min
neapolis, according to Tu
Shih-liang, group member and
head of the delegation of Chinese
students from Taiwan's Stanford
Chinese Cultural Association.
The Front for Democracy in
China was founded in Paris this
September and is led by Yan Jiaqi
and Wuer Kaixi, exiled leaders of
China's democracy movement.
Prominent exile Wan Runnan,
who was previously head of the
Stone Corporation in China and
is currently general secretary of
the newly formed group, opened
the meeting.
Wan urged the 200 who atten
ded to expand the local member
ship of the group and to maintain
pressure on the Chinese govern
ment.
Represented at the organiza
tional meeting were several
groups in the Bay Area Chinese
community. Members of the
China Alliance for Democracy, its
affiliate Mingzhudang, Silicon
Valley for Democracy in China
and other Bay Area organizations
also attended. The meeting was
conducted in Mandarin.
