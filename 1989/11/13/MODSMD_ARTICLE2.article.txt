# New group seeking Chinese democracy
## 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
A newly formed international
umbrella organization dedicated
to the creation of a multiparty
political system in China held its
first Bay Area meeting Saturday
at Stanford.
Although the group, the Front
for Democracy in China, seeks
democratic change for mainland
China, the meeting was primarily
attended by Chinese-Americans
and Chinese from Taiwan. Local
students and scholars from main
land China apparently shied away
from the meeting for fear that
their participation would be re
corded by the Chinese consulate.
In a pre-conference interview,
David Ai, a project manager at
Hewlett-Packard and one of the
six members of the group's North
American board of directors, said
that the long-term goals of the
group are to "protect basic human
rights in China, develop a market
economy sytem, uphold social jus
tice and end one-party rule.''
Ai said the last goal as the most
critical. "If that is accomplished
a lot of things will fall into place,"
he said.
The primary business of Satur
day's meeting was to inaugurate
the new branch by passing bylaws
and electing members to fill the
administrative and supervisory

committees.
This branch was only the sec
ond to be organized in the United
States, following the establish
ment Friday of a chapter in Min
neapolis, according to Tu
Shih-liang, group member and
head of the delegation of Chinese
students from Taiwan's Stanford
Chinese Cultural Association.
The Front for Democracy in
China was founded in Paris this
September and is led by Yan Jiaqi
and Wuer Kaixi, exiled leaders of
China's democracy movement.
Prominent exile Wan Runnan,
who was previously head of the
Stone Corporation in China and
is currently general secretary of
the newly formed group, opened
the meeting.
Wan urged the 200 who atten
ded to expand the local member
ship of the group and to maintain
pressure on the Chinese govern
ment.
Represented at the organiza
tional meeting were several
groups in the Bay Area Chinese
community. Members of the
China Alliance for Democracy, its
affiliate Mingzhudang, Silicon
Valley for Democracy in China
and other Bay Area organizations
also attended. The meeting was
conducted in Mandarin.
Only about one-third of the at

tendees were students and schol
ars, and, of these, very few were
from Stanford.
Ai was pleased by the success
of the meeting, which he called
"a much-improved version of the
Paris conference."
Ai said the meeting was suc
cessful due to the conscientious
attentiveness to the business of
developing democratic rules and
regulations and active participa
tion in debate by those who at
tended. "We were able to stick
with democratic procedure and
achieve as much as possible," he
said.
Throughout the meeting mem
bers were consciously developing
the democratic procedures to

guide the new organization.
Controversy broke out at one
point when two ballots were sub
mitted with very similar hand
writing and identical selections.
The members voted to determine
if one or both ballots should be
invalidated, and ended up dis
counting both.
Rosemary Ho, a manager at
MIPS computer corporation and
currently spokesperson of Silicon
Valley for Democracy in China,
was elected director of the local
chapter of the new group in a
close election. She received one
vote more than three runners-up,
and the meeting narrowly avoided
the fate of what one participant
described as si tou ma che — a
cart pulled by four horses in dif
ferent directions.
Each of the 16 candidates for
the seven administrative commit

tee and three supervisory com
mittee positions gave a brief,
one-minute self-introduction and
answered questions from the
floor. The group elected a diverse
set of leaders, with two members
from Taiwan and a mixture of
professionals, students, scholars
and businessmen.
Several candidates ran under
assumed names after it was
declared, midway through the
meeting, that it was permissible
to join the group under a false
name because of concern for the
safety of relatives still in China.
Currently, the group is trying
to broaden its membership base
among the approximately 40 mil
lion overseas Chinese. Tu pointed
to the importance of the activism
of overseas Chinese in sustaining
the democracy movement: "It is
the combination of all kinds of

resources that makes the Chinese
student movement happen."

A newly formed international
umbrella organization dedicated
to the creation of a multiparty
political system in China held its
first Bay Area meeting Saturday
at Stanford.
Although the group, the Front
for Democracy in China, seeks
democratic change for mainland
China, the meeting was primarily
attended by Chinese-Americans
and Chinese from Taiwan. Local
students and scholars from main
land China apparently shied away
from the meeting for fear that
their participation would be re
corded by the Chinese consulate.
In a pre-conference interview,
David Ai, a project manager at
Hewlett-Packard and one of the
six members of the group's North
American board of directors, said
that the long-term goals of the
group are to "protect basic human
rights in China, develop a market
economy sytem, uphold social jus
tice and end one-party rule.''
Ai said the last goal as the most
critical. "If that is accomplished
a lot of things will fall into place,"
he said.
The primary business of Satur
day's meeting was to inaugurate
the new branch by passing bylaws
and electing members to fill the
administrative and supervisory

committees.
This branch was only the sec
ond to be organized in the United
States, following the establish
ment Friday of a chapter in Min
neapolis, according to Tu
Shih-liang, group member and
head of the delegation of Chinese
students from Taiwan's Stanford
Chinese Cultural Association.
The Front for Democracy in
China was founded in Paris this
September and is led by Yan Jiaqi
and Wuer Kaixi, exiled leaders of
China's democracy movement.
Prominent exile Wan Runnan,
who was previously head of the
Stone Corporation in China and
is currently general secretary of
the newly formed group, opened
the meeting.
Wan urged the 200 who atten
ded to expand the local member
ship of the group and to maintain
pressure on the Chinese govern
ment.
Represented at the organiza
tional meeting were several
groups in the Bay Area Chinese
community. Members of the
China Alliance for Democracy, its
affiliate Mingzhudang, Silicon
Valley for Democracy in China
and other Bay Area organizations
also attended. The meeting was
conducted in Mandarin.

tendees were students and schol
ars, and, of these, very few were
from Stanford.
Ai was pleased by the success
of the meeting, which he called
"a much-improved version of the
Paris conference."
Ai said the meeting was suc
cessful due to the conscientious
attentiveness to the business of
developing democratic rules and
regulations and active participa
tion in debate by those who at
tended. "We were able to stick
with democratic procedure and
achieve as much as possible," he
said.
