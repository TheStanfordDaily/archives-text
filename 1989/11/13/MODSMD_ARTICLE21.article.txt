## Tresidder's pressure tactics 
### 
Tresidder memorial union
is facing a budget deficit of
$210,000. For the past two weeks,
I have been following with great interest
the dispute between the Tresidder man
agement and the United Stanford
Workers who work at Tresidder.
In an effort to solve its financial crisis,
Tresidder management has given three
options to its 10-member custodial staff:
retire, transfer to other University posi
tions or risk being laid off.
USW leadership asserts that manage
ment should shoulder the burden of its
own mismanagement.
I wanted to get a firsthand account of
what is going on between management
and labor. Therefore, I spoke with rep
resentatives from both sides of the debate
in order to draw my own conclusions.
First, I spoke with Linda Crouse, USW
chief steward. She reported that the
budget deficit is due in large part to
Tresidder's mismanagement over this
past year and in previous years. Poor
administrative decisions, wasteful spend
ing and bad machine maintenance with
very expensive repair costs are only some
of the things she cited as causes of this
debt.
Next, I talked to Bobbi Braden, director
of Tresidder. She explained to me that
the $210,000 debt is due to the change
in food service, from Marriott Corp. to
Bon Appetit Catering. Marriott had guar
anteed Tresidder a fixed annual return,
which Bon Appetit does not, so Tresidder
loses money.
I do not doubt the veracity of either
Crouse's or Braden's statements. I am
sure that both parties are representing
two sides of one truth.

However, I would like to take issue
with the tactics that Tresidder manage
ment is using to earn the favor of the
student body I speak of the accusations
of USW misconduct by Tresidder Finance
Manager Rae Hill, Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson and Braden.
Tresidder management claims that
USW field representative Rodney Bar
nette called Hill a "two-faced bitch" and
that his attempt to gain access to her
office constitutes attempted assault.
They furthermore claim that Barnette
"brushed up" against a white female em
ployee.
In a letter to The Daily Thursday,
Braden and Robinson made subtle alle
gations that USW members are respon
sible for the vandalism at Tresidder,
citing that damage of property and har
assment often occurs whenever the USW
leadership ~aad the Ttesukler manage
ment are embroiled in a dispute.
By their own admission, Braden and
Robinson have no evidence to prove that
the USW is responsible for the vandalism.
These allegations amount to nothing
more than dirty game playing in a sorry
attempt to win student favor.
Who do they think they are trying to
chide? To me, these accusations are an
attempt to discredit the USW and divert
attention from the real issue — people's
right to maintain their jobs.
Futhermore, I cannot believe that yet
another African-American man has been
accused of "illegally touching" and bul
lying a white woman.
Apparently, accusing a black man of
harassing a white woman is a very con
venient attempt to quiet those who dare
to question the procedures of the status

I cannot believe that
yet another African-
American man has
been accused of 'il
legally touching'... a
white woman.

quo, as Louis Jackson — oh, I mean
Rodney Barnette — did.
When will this madness end?
It is not necessary for Tresidder man
agement to use these tactics to mount
public pressure on the USW to get them
to accept their proposal. It is an insult
not only to the sensibilities of the com
munity, but also to the dignity of workers
who labor so hard to make Tresidder a
nice environment for students.
It is about time that management look
into what it can sacrifice in order to take
care of its own mismanagement. That
way, both sides can sit down and work
out some solutions to the budget deficit
crisis that everyone can live with.
