USW is trying to pit
the students against
the administration
I've had enough with the United
Stanford Workers. Tresidder Memorial
Union director Bobbi Braden and As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson have suggested that the
Tresidder vandalism has destroyed an
"investment that students have made
in those spaces" (The Daily, Friday,
Nov. 10).
USW Chief Steward Linda Crouse,
however, expects me to believe that
this comment is nothing more than "a
transparent attempt to pit workers
against students."
In fact, the improvements I have

seen in Tresidder over the past three
years — and there have been improve
ments — have been from a significant
investment of student time on the
Tresidder Union Board, and an even
more significant investment of student
money into the improvement projects.
So I feel pitted not against the ad
ministration, but rather against the
individual or individuals responsible for
these acts which will no doubt cost
each of us even more money to repair.
This is money that could be spent on
a variety of other things, including the
Tresidder deficit or salaries for
workers. Instead, it will be spent on
replacing carpets that I've already
helped purchase and install once. I
resent that.
A far more transparent comment
that pits students against someone is
Crouse's own comment that there is "a
lot of community resentment" over the

Tresidder dispute.
Far from attempting to place stu
dents and workers at odds however,
this comment is an attempt by Crouse
herself to yet again pit students
against the administration.
I am more than tired of having the
USW, and for that matter the ASSU
and Council of Presidents, attempt to
declare my support for their efforts
against the University, when the
reverse is just as likely to be the case.
In this situation, Crouse's statement
of "community resentment" is more
than transparent; it is an unwarranted
and untrue use of my name as a stu
dent to further the USW's aims. I
resent that.

Religious leaders'
opposition to gays
just mask for hatred
I am writing as a gay Christian con
cerning the recent defeat of the domes
tic partners proposition on the San
Francisco ballot. I was watching the
news today and saw that local religious
leaders are rejoicing over their 51 to
49 percent victory over "the homosexu
als."
While Jesus taught love and accept
ance, these clergymen are sending a
message of hate and rejection to homo
sexuals.
Is their goal to push homosexuals
away from Christianity? That is the
real effect of their politics.
Is this God's will? Do they fight

such human rights for gays out of love
and concern for the spiritual well-being
of fellow human beings? Or are they
using religious zeal as an excuse to
persecute people that they hate or do
not understand?
Bigotry masked as religion is a terri
ble part of many people's lives. I chal
lenge Christians and all people with
anti-gay feelings to apply this test to
their own motives, and if necessary to
begin acting from love instead of hate.
My pride in my religion has suffered.
