## Djerassi's new book reveals the seedy side of science Talking about the 'Dilemma' of a chemist turned novelist 
### James Mokhiber 
Few first-time novels draw the instant critical at
tention that "Cantor's Dilemma" has commanded
since its release three weeks ago. But few first-time
novelists are like Carl Djerassi, the Stanford pro
fessor of chemistry who is best known for his syn
thesis of the first oral contraceptive.
The following are excerpts from an interview with
Djerassi about his behind-the-scenes look at the
American scientific establishment.
The Daily: "Cantor's Dilemma" is your second pub
lished work of fiction, following last year's collection
"The Futurist and Other Stories." How do you now
see yourself at the moment — as more of a scientist
or a writer?
Djerassi: Well . . . I'm certainly still a scientist who
also happens to do some writing. But I want to
lead one more intellectual life for the remaining
years of my life, and I want to become a full-time
writer eventually.
The Daily: And you would put aside chemistry?
Djerassi: Yes, you know, I am 66 years old and I
had cancer three years ago, so I have perhaps a
different perspective of my mortality than others
would, and I think I would like to try something
new.
The Daily: At one point in your book, Cantor
criticizes his laboratory assistant Jeremiah Stafford
for having given a boring speech, saying "your talk
was awful .. . how can you take such promising
results and make them so ploddingly dull?" Is your
goal like Cantor's, to make science seem more ex
citing and accessible?
Djerassi: I wrote this because I think the genre of
science in fiction — which is totally different from
science fiction — has been used very rarely. Much
of the time it has been written by people who are
very good writers, but not scientists, and who bas
ically then become journalists even though they
might write fiction. They are trying to write about
a culture, an experience that is not theirs. .. .
It's basically like writing about monkhood. . . .
You can write about them if you are a good writer,
but you don't really have any access, they don't
really let you into their real selves.
The Daily: Who is your intended audience in "Can
tor's Dilemma"?
Djerassi: I'm talking in essence to several audiences
here. It's a real dichotomy: On the one hand I'm
talking to other scientists. . .these are my peers so
to speak, my younger peers, my older peers, those
the same age. The other audience — and if had to
choose I would pick this one — that is the non
scientists. I really would like them to know what
life is like as a scientist, with all the blemishes and
warts and wounds and orgasmic plea3ures of it all!
The Daily: In "Cantor's Dilemma" the key to his
theory occurs to him early in the mornti«£<. Have
ideas really come to you like this, as epiphanies or
revelations?
Djerassi: At times, yes, and it's mind-blowing plea

sure. This is why I'm using the sexual analog}' of
orgasm because it doesn't last very long. Because
then the realities sink in: Either it's true and you've
created a fact and that's it and it becomes history,
or it's not true and you or someone else shows that
it's wrong and you feel unhappy about it. So it is
ephemeral, but it's fantastic.
The Daily: But it is essentially a creative process
then?
Djerassi: Oh, absolutely.
The Daily: So where is the dividing line between
your scientific side and your creative side?
Djerassi: Well maybe there isn't any . . . people talk
about two distinct cultures — maybe there aren't
two cultures ... for me it's grayer than it probably
is for other people. It is interesting that I've gotten
very little feedback as yet about either this book
or about my short stories from scientists. So I don't
know, I don't know if they even read it. . . .
The Daily: The only purely humanities-minded per
son in the book is Leah, a student of literary criticism
who is apparently modeled after your wife's (Diane
Middlebrook's] daughter. Why do you include her?
Djerassi: Well, Leah [Middlebrookj is of course my
step- daughter, and she is a graduate from Columbia
and is going into comparative literature. Of course
I like Leah very much — I mean both the fictional
Leah and the real one — and I wanted to show
through her that the people in the humanities have
as much a culture and rules of scholastic behavior
and "buzzwords." I mean if you don't know what
a Bakhtinian is, they look down on you just as
when a scientist says PNS and you're supposed to
know that the factor has things in there that even

tually are removed.
The Daily: The bulk of the infighting nevertheless
goes on between scientists, between Cantor and his
nemesis at Harvard, Krauss. How much of that do
you exaggerate for literary or dramatic effect? Is
that an everyday reality?
Djerassi [nodding]: Why, of course. I mean, I
wouldn't say it happens every time, but there's
plenty of that. Oh, yes.
The Daily: Even to the extent of blackmail?
Djerassi: Oh, absolutely.
The Daily: For something as large as a Nobel prize?
Djerassi: Well, remember, blackmail is of course a
strong word. He — Cantor — was pissed off when
he said that. It's more intellectual extortion. . . . It's
this type of subtle pressure where you can deny
you've exerted it. Oh, absolutely, I'm quite sure
that this (exists).
The Daily: Some people have expressed some
surprise at the sex in the book, something that was

not in "Castor's Dilemma."
Djerassi: Well I think sex is an important component
in everyone's life, either by performing it or indulg
ing it or enjoying it or denying it or attacking it.
In here I'm talking about people's lives. ... I was
certainly not prurient in there. [But] you don't even
know if Cantor and Paula ever had sex — I'm being
very subtle about this.
In the case of Celestine, I did it for a very good
reason: I wanted to show that Celestine is a
prototype of a young woman who knew exactly
where she wanted to go from high school, and she
was really doing it on male turf. . . .
The Daily: But you include the scenes in which she
has an affair with a professor who is 35 years older
than she is. . . .
Djerassi: . . .This is one of the issues that I actually


Cantors Dilemma'
Prof. Carl Djerassi, author of 'Cantor's Dilemma'
did want to talk about, namely the issue of sexual
affairs between professors and students. ... It hap
pens certainly quite often, probably much more often
than most people think. I wanted to talk not again
about the crude things like the married professor
and the innocent student — out and out both adul
tery and seduction — I didn't want to have the
case of the crude pressure for sexual favors in
return for better grades, or this or that.
I wanted to quite clearly make it in the end two
consenting adults who nevertheless are some 30
years apart. Why is it that a 21-year-old girl would
go to bed with a 50-some-year-old man? I wanted
to then eventually present both explanations. ... I
wanted the reader to think about what it was in
fact that was violated. . ..
The Daily: But you do finally come down on her
side. ...
Djerassi: Yes! And I do think that in the end one
does violate something, which is the student-teacher
relationship, which is a certain relationship which
simply does not continue when you are fucking, to
put it as bluntly as all that. I'm purposely using a
four-letter word in this context; you've got to reduce
it to that level. . . .
You have to realize one really violates something
in this case and one shouldn't beat around the
bush. But people still have a tendency to beat greatly
around the bush; this is a topic that, again, I

thought was worthwhile writing about.
The Daily: Cantor seems to be a renaissance man:
he loves art, collects antiques from Vienna, plays
the viola. How much does he reflect you?
Djerassi: I'm in quite a number of figures — some
of the women too. I think the fact that he is an
art collector, that I play the cello and he plays the
viola, etc. . . . But I am not Cantor otherwise. There
are a number of things that Cantor is that I am
not at all, in particular his personal monastic style,
which certainly never has been mine.
The Daily: In "Cantor's Dilemma" you describe the
Nobel Prize ceremony in great detail. I couldn't
help feeling a certain sense of longing there. Is that
fair?
Djerassi: Oh, sure it's fair. Your conclusion is prob
ably a right one, and I think it applies to almost
every scientist and is nothing special in respect to
me . . . but what I have said is also true; There
are lots of people who deserve to win the Nobel
Prize who cannot possibly do so because there are
many more people than the Nobel Prize.
Secondly, I've won a reasonable number of awards,
and it's like I said, people are insatiable about this,
they never have enough, they always want to have
more. I think it's very important for people to know
that scientists are very fallible, very much human
beings. They have a tendency to pontificate, to sound
all-knowing, but I think they are also very flawed.
I'm not ashamed to be a scientist, but I don't
pretend to be more. I think I'm an interesting
human being precisely because I am flawed, as a
scientist, in a different way as a writer, in a different
way as an art collector.
