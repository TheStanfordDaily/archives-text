### Carl Djerassi 
Cantor's Dilemma

Doubleday, $18.95
In "Castor's Dilemma," a
short story first published in
the Hudson Review, Professor
I. Castor discovers his shatter
ing, Nobel prize-winning cancer
hypothesis may have been com
promised by a laboratory assis
tant's fraudulent research.
Though the name and tone
have changed, Carl Djerassi's
just-published novel "Cantor's
Dilemma" retells and expands
his parable of backbiting politics
and professional jealousies that
characterize cutting-edge sci
ence in America. With an eye
on the larger issue of trust
within the academy, Djerassi's
book explores other issues, in
cluding womens' roles in the
male-dominated science world,
student-professor relationships
and faculty infighting from a
number of perspectives.
Diplomatically-placed in an
anonymous "large midwestern
university," Djerassi's Cantor is
a proper, methodical academic
who largely shuns the plotting
and politics of the publishing
university professor. When a
sudden inspiration leads him to

formulate a breakthrough the
ory about the origins of tumors,
Cantor turns to his gifted lab
oratory assistant Jeremiah Staf
ford for the key experiments
that eventually win them both
the Nobel prize.
Working under strict time
constraints to avoid what Can
tor calls . .in contemporary
science the greatest occupa
tional hazard . .. simultaneous
discovery," Stafford commits
and covers up some sloppy mis
takes that would throw doubt
on the validity of both the ex
periment and Cantor's larger hy
pothesis if revealed.
The "dilemma" Cantor faces
is whether he should acknowl
edge the fact that the experi
ment's results may have been
skewed and thereby risk losing
his chance at a Nobel Prize.
Running parallel to Djerassi's
central theme is a coming-of-age
subplot that follows headstrong
female protagonist Celestine
Price as she climbs the ladder
that leads to success within the
patriarchal scientific establish
ment.
Punctuated with clear scien
tific explanations and precise
descriptions, Djerassi's book is
