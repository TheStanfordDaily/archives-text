# Gordon to perform her works
## 
### Mark Lewis 
Karen Elizabeth Gordon will
create a river of story Wednesday
night at Printer's Inc. Bookstore,
when she performs material from
her books "Intimate Apparel: A
Dictionary of the Senses," "The
Well-Tempered Sentence" and
"The Transitive Vampire."
Unlike a common reading,
which is a simple translation of
the work into voice, Gordon's will
incorporate theater and gesture
into her written material. Her per
formance will include idiosyn
cratic characters who rave and
ruminate about their sensual and
fantastic experiences. Expect that
the audience will have a chance
to read parts and slip into char
acter for a moment — an idea she
first tried at a performance in
San Luis Obispo.
"Intimate Apparel," her recent
book on which the performance
will largely be based, is written
in the form of a dictionary of
personal possessions and notions.
In dictionary entries such as
"door" and "farewell," episodes

and characters are insinuated in
miniature form. Often, her foot
notes act as signposts, referring
to other parts of the book. In a
telephone interview Gordon
likened the exploratory "Intimate
Apparel" to "an ancient form of
story-telling, without a sense of
an ending It is a layering of
language, images and the interac
tion of characters and words."
The writing of the book was
"spontaneous, its form growing
organically," and this has resulted
in an expressive work. In "In
timate Apparel" the texture and
sound of language are as impor
tant as the meaning the language
conveys.
The performance will include
"Intimate Apparel's" lovers Tor
quil and Jonquil who emerge from
their 250-hour debauch in the
Last Judgement Pinball Machine
Motel to seek a haven from
voyeuristic flamingos. Gordon
may also present Yolanta, an ex
patriate author who becomes in
creasingly unhinged by dementia,
and her friend Jacob Other, the
pretentious critic "who puts all

these couches to lie down on in
his sentences."
These characters and others
first appeared in her two previous
books "The Well-Tempered Sen
tence" and"The Transitive Vam
pire." Gordon wrote these
eccentric and playful guides to
punctuation and grammar with
the intent of "smuggling the in
junctions of grammar into your
cognizance through a menage of
revolving lunatics. . . . Learning is
less a curse than a distraction."
While these earlier books used
"raucous pantomime" to teach the
rules of grammar to those con
founded by them, "Intimate Ap
parel" serves nothing but
Gordon's vision of peculiar char
acters in their grand, private
worlds. This thematic coherence
is matched by a learned and sen
sual technique, which exults in
language and form.

Karen Elizabeth Gordon will ap
pear at Printer's Inc. Bookstore,
310 California Ave. in Palo Alto
on Wednesday, Nov. 15, at 8 p.m.
