## Devils condemn Cardinal Johnson injured as Stanford blows fourth-quarter lead 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
TEMPE, Ariz. - While the
Stanford offense had its most pro
ductive game of the season Sat
urday, it was also its most destruc
tive. Despite 26 first downs and
470 yards of total offense, four
Cardinal turnovers proved to be
too much to overcome in a 30-22
loss to Arizona State Saturday
night.
"We did a lot of damage to our
selves," fullback Scott Eschelman
said. "It's not like we didn't have
our chances to win the game; we
just didn't get it done."
With the loss, Stanford will go
into Big Game 2-8, 2-5 in the
Pacific 10 Conference. The Sun
Devils are 6-3-1 overall, 3-2-1 and
in sole possession of second place
in the Pac-10.

Sun Devils 30
Cardinal 22

After digging out of a 14-0 hole,
Stanford came back to take a 22-
21 lead with just under 13
minutes remaining in the game.
Arizona State came right back
with a touchdown and a field goal
to put the game away.
John Hopkins kicked a 50-yard
field goal to give Stanford its first
lead of the game at 22-21 after a
31-yard drive. Arizona State quar
terback Paul Justin then led the
Sun Devils to the winning score.
After reaching the Cardinal 14,
Justin found fullback Kelvin Fis
her in the right flat. Fisher turned
upfield, juked around free saftey
Kevin Scott, appeared to step out
of bounds at the four and kept
going into the end zone.
One official stood at the four
as if to spot the ball, but another

official signaled touchdown. The
first official made no move to
overrule him, and the play stood.
Replays on the Diamond Vision
screen in the stadium clearly
showed Fisher as being out of
bounds.
"I saw his right foot step out,"
Scott said. "Then I saw his foot
go out again before he dove in
the end zone. ... When he got up
you could see the mark, where
his cleat slid out of bounds.l
pointed it out to the ref, and he
saw it and marked the ball down."
The loss overshadowed a career
best 308-yard passing perform
ance by Brian Johnson. Johnson,
who falls to 2-1 as a starter this
year, completed 30 of 45 passes
for two scores before being
knocked out of the game with 45
seconds left in the game.
Johnson reinjured his right
shoulder and will not play against
California next week. Steve Smith
came in and completed a nine
yard pass before throwing a des
peration pass that was intercepted
38 yards downfield.
Two other interceptions, both
from Johnson, were much more
costly. Stanford was down 7-0 but
Johnson had driven the team to
the ASU 30. On third-and-five,
Johnson dropped back and threw
toward Eschelman, but Stanley
was right there. Stanley, who was
a starter at noseguard as a true
freshman last year, made the easy
catch and rambled 70 yards un
touched to make it 14-0.
Stanford bounced back, though.
A perfect Johnson pass hit flanker
Jon Pinckney in stride, and
Pinckney coasted the final few
yards for a 41-yard touchdown.
Four plays later Cardinal defen
sive tackle Scott Palmbush sacked
Justin in the end zone, and the
lead was down to five.
After an exchange of punts, Jus

tin came right back to find
Guliford for a 20-yard touchdown
to make it 21-9. Hopkins hit a
field goal to cut it to 21-12 with
five seconds left in the half.
Stanford outgained the Sun
Devils 283-168, had 18 first downs
to eight for ASU and held the
ball for nearly 20 minutes in the
first half but trailed by nine.
"Your objective is to do what we
have to do to keep them off the
field," Green said. "We did that,
except for the turnovers, and we
were down by nine."
Stanford mounted a comeback
when Johnson hit Pinckney right
in stride around the ASU 30 mid
way through the third quarter.
Pinckney did the rest for an 83-
yard score, the third-longest in
Cardinal history. Hopkins gave
Stanford the lead a few minutes
later, but then it was all ASU.
"The thing we feel we have to
get better at is stopping them
when we have the lead at the end
of the game," Green said.
While the Cardinal defense had
a great deal of trouble stopping
Justin — he threw for 296 yards
while ASU could muster only 42
on the ground — the Cardinal
offense had many stars. Eschel
man ran for 80 yards on only 16
carries, and tight end Jim Price
caught nine balls and fought
through tacklers for several key
first downs.
"We didn't put the game away
when we had a chance to," Es-*
chelman said. "We haven't done
that all year. We just think it's
going to turn around. Coming
close really doesn't do it for
anyone."
"There's no satisfaction in
losing," Scott said. "You play
hard, you play hard, and you get
a loss. There's no satisfaction. We
just have to bounce back and play
hard against Cal. And get a win."
