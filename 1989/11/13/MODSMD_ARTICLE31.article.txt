The gist of the big showdown between
defending national champion Texas and
second place Stanford was best stated by
Longhorn Coach Eddie Reese moments
after the meet: "The only way that Stan
ford could have been beaten today was
if we got out of the pool and ran the last
25 yards."
Saturday afternoon Stanford unveiled
a powerful, young swimming team which
left the two-time champion Longhorns

struggling to stay afloat in deGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal swimmers handed No. 1
Texas its first dual-meet loss in over a
year with a convincing 67-46 decision.
"We had a great team effort," Coach
Skip Kenney said. "This team is special
again. We had three years in a row when

we had great teams, and this team's a
lot like that. From day one, I've liked
this team. I've liked the character of the
team, and today was one of those efforts.
I not only saw it in the water but I could
see it as a group out of the water."
Stanford opened the meet with an im
portant momentum-building win in the
400 medley relay. As the excitement in
the crowd of about 500 expanded with
each stroke, the Cardinal relay team, com
posed by freshmen J.J. Freitag and Erik
Maurer, sophomore Jeff Rouse and senior
Doug Lillydahl, swam ahead of the Long

horn swimmers to record a 3:20.47 time.
"We knew we had to win one of the
relays," Kenney said. "We had some great
swims today, and it started out on that
medley relay that just pumped everybody
up."
Rouse recorded one of the most im
pressive swims of the day in the 200
backstroke. The defending NCAA cham
pion, Rouse qualified for the 1990 NCAAs
in his first meet of the year with a time
nearly a second faster than the required
qualifying standard. His unofficial time
of 1:48.31 set a new record for deGuerre

Pool and left the next closest swimmer,
classmate Andy Lloyd, over three seconds
behind. Rouse's swim wiped out the pool
record held by former Cardinal swimmer
Sean Murphy since 1985.
The Cardinal never trailed the Long
horns in points the entire afternoon.
Despite the Cardinal winning just
seven of the 13 events, the outcome of
the meet was never in question due to
the superior swimming skills of Stan
ford's second-and-third place swimmers.
