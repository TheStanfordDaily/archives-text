Stanford enjoyed mixed
results at the District-8 Cross
Country Championships Satur
day, as senior Eric Mastalir ad
vanced to the NCAA Champ
ionship meet but the Cardinal
•failed to qualify as a team.
Mastalir led the men to a
third-place finish, while senior
Carol Gray was the lone bright
spot on the women's team with
a fifth-place finish.
Mastalir took sixth in the
men's race in 30:40 to qualify
for the NCAA Championships,
while the Cardinal needed a
top-two finish to go as a team.
"I'm disappointed for the
team, but I met my individual
goal", said Mastalir.
Gray's next contest will be
securing one of a handful of
at-large births for the champi
onship meet. The top two
teams and next three fastest
individual finishers in each dis
trict race are invited to Mary
land next week. Gray —
finishing fifth — just missed
a guaranteed spot.
Gray, an All-American, has
raced well this season, and
seems likely to get a bid as an
at-large individual. "I think she
deserves to go — I think she
will," said teammate Ashley
Black. "She finished second at
Districts last year and has
proven she can do the job."
The women's team finished
in the middle of the pack in
eighth place. Behind Gray was
junior Melanie Bloch in 18th
place.
Stanford's next three finish
ers were well back in the pack.
"None of us had a stand-out
race," said Black, who was the
women's fourth finisher in
73rd. "We really spread out."

In the men's race, Oregon
dominated the competition by
capturing the top five spots in
the last mile, with Mastalir
sixth.
Senior Mark Mastalir was in
the race early, but wound up
in 18th place with senior Bill
Crowley 20th. Both ran their
last collegiate cross country
race.
The team was in position
with about two miles to go in
the 10-kilometer race. "They
(Washington] didn't have the
guns up front," said Eric Mas
talir. Instead, the Huskies ran
away from the Cardinal with
several finishers in the top fif
teen.
Stanford improved on its
fourth-place Pacific-10-
Conference-Championship
finish by picking off Arizona.
The women have had a rebuild
ing year, with three freshmen
finishing third through fifth
Saturday.
Coach Scott Chisam was
hoping that freshmen Jill
Shenkel, Black and Amy
McConeli would make an im
pact. Sophomore Jeannie
Heltzel, who has been sidelined
this season with back prob
lems, was not among the team's
top five Saturday.
Eric Mastalir and Gray will
now focus on training for the
NCAA meet Nov. 20 in Mary
land. Gray will wait on the ap
peal that would allow her run
for yet another All-America
award, while Mastalir hopes to
gain the honor for the first
time.
"I think it will take a solid
race", he predicted, with a pace
of about 31:00.
"My goal 18 to be an All-
American", Mastalir said. "It
all comes down to mental
toughness."
