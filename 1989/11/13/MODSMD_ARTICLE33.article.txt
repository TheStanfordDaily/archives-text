Every student has had the op
portunity to review an easy prac
tice test before an important
midterm. Despite feeling good
about taking care of preparation,
you know only so much can be
learned from such an un
representative exam.
The Stanford men's basketball
team played with similar thoughts
Friday night against Brewster
Heights Packing. Despite showing
numerous spurts of impressive
play and recording a 109-87 vic
tory, the Cardinal players realized
the AAU club did not reach the
heights of Division I basketball.

"The game served its purpose,"
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"We had some fun, and we got to
run up and down. But, it also
pointed up some things that we
need to work on."
In particular, the game pointed
out that the Cardinal needs to
put together a more consistent,
solid defensive effort. The veteran
Brewster squad, composed prima
rily of former college players from
Northwest schools, found lanes
open for easy buckets throughout
the game.
"We were playing against older,
smart guys who know how to use
their bodies, but still, defensively
it was a very sporadic effort,"
Montgomery said.
"Part of it was we substituted
a lot — I played all 12 players in
both halves — and the continuity
broke down. Part of it was just
lack of fundamentals and not
being ready to sustain a good ef
fort defensively. We need to go
back and do a better job."
Stanford also needs to work on
breaking the press and matching
up against an extended 1-2-2 zone.
The Cardinal was unable to move

the ball up the court effectively
in the final two minutes against
the Packer press, and the Packer
zone gave Stanford trouble all
game.
"They did something (the 1-2-2
zone) we haven't even talked
about with a team of eight fresh
men," Montgomery said. "That
won't be a problem later on when
we talk about it."
The Cardinal did impress the
sparse crowd — generously
marked at 1200 — with a suc
cessful display of long-distance
shooting. While recording a
respectable 52 percent from the
field for the game, Stanford
scored on 65 percent of its three
point attempts, making 11 of 17
attempts.
Redshirt freshman Peter
Dukes, who finished the night
with 16 points, highlighted the
shooting spree when he pulled up
on a fast break with 12 minutes
left in the game and knocked
down a 20-foot shot.
"The game definitely had its
bright spots," junior John Patrick
said. "We shot the ball well from
the outside."
The bright spot for the Packers
was the second half performance
of former Boise State forward Eric
Hayes. Hayes, held scoreless in
the first half, put 18 points on
the board in the second half and
led the team with six rebounds.
For the Cardinal, Patrick, soph
omore Adam Keefe, and junior
Deshon Wingate all turned in solid
performances. Patrick, bringing
the ball up the court, turned the
ball over only once, Keefe led the
team in scoring with 20 points
and Wingate fought his way to
14 rebounds.
"They got after us," Patrick
said. "They're tricky, older guys,
but we're going to face a lot better.
There were no Gary Paytons out
there."
The smaller Packers stayed
close to the Cardinal for the first
two minutes of the game. How
ever, after going down 6-4, Stan
ford ran off a string of 17 points

to put the game out of reach. The
Cardinal players, dominating the
rebounding by a margin of 52-30,
were consistently able to get two
or three shots off each time down
the floor.
Beyond any coachable changes,
Wingate's hustle highlighted the

final seconds of play. With just
over 10 seconds left in the game,
Wingate dove to the floor to fight
for a loose ball. He controlled the
ball, sat up and bounced it up to
sophomore Langtry Meyer who
finished the Stanford scoring with
a decisive slam dunk.

need to work on."
In particular, the game pointed
out that the Cardinal needs to
put together a more consistent,
solid defensive effort. The veteran
Brewster squad, composed prima
rily of former college players from
Northwest schools, found lanes
open for easy buckets throughout
the game.
"We were playing against older,
smart guys who know how to use
their bodies, but still, defensively
it was a very sporadic effort,"
Montgomery said.
"Part of it was we substituted
a lot — I played all 12 players in
both halves — and the continuity
broke down. Part of it was just
lack of fundamentals and not
being ready to sustain a good ef
fort defensively. We need to go
back and do a better job."
Stanford also needs to work on
breaking the press and matching
up against an extended 1-2-2 zone.
The Cardinal was unable to move

the ball up the court effectively
in the final two minutes against
the Packer press, and the Packer
zone gave Stanford trouble all
game.
"They did something (the 1-2-2
zone) we haven't even talked
about with a team of eight fresh
men," Montgomery said. "That
won't be a problem later on when
we talk about it."
The Cardinal did impress the
sparse crowd — generously
marked at 1200 — with a suc
cessful display of long-distance
shooting. While recording a
respectable 52 percent from the
field for the game, Stanford
scored on 65 percent of its three
point attempts, making 11 of 17
attempts.
Redshirt freshman Peter
Dukes, who finished the night
with 16 points, highlighted the
shooting spree when he pulled up
on a fast break with 12 minutes
left in the game and knocked
down a 20-foot shot.
"The game definitely had its
bright spots," junior John Patrick
said. "We shot the ball well from
the outside."
The bright spot for the Packers
was the second half performance
of former Boise State forward Eric
Hayes. Hayes, held scoreless in
the first half, put 18 points on
the board in the second half and
led the team with six rebounds.
For the Cardinal, Patrick, soph
omore Adam Keefe, and junior
Deshon Wingate all turned in solid
performances. Patrick, bringing
the ball up the court, turned the
ball over only once, Keefe led the
team in scoring with 20 points
and Wingate fought his way to
14 rebounds.
"They got after us," Patrick
said. "They're tricky, older guys,
but we're going to face a lot better.
There were no Gary Paytons out
there."
The smaller Packers stayed
close to the Cardinal for the first
two minutes of the game. How
ever, after going down 6-4, Stan
ford ran off a string of 17 points

to put the game out of reach. The
Cardinal players, dominating the
rebounding by a margin of 52-30,
were consistently able to get two
or three shots off each time down
the floor.
Beyond any coachable changes,
Wingate's hustle highlighted the

final seconds of play. With just
over 10 seconds left in the game,
Wingate dove to the floor to fight
for a loose ball. He controlled the
ball, sat up and bounced it up to
sophomore Langtry Meyer who
finished the Stanford scoring with
a decisive slam dunk.
