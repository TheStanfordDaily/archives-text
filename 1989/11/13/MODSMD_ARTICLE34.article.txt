# Women's hoops sharp in opener

The sign on the locker room
door of the Stanford women's bas
ketball team warns, "Get comfort
able with it! NCAA Champions
1990."
Yesterday Stanford took its first
step in that direction with a con
vincing — albeit not surprising
— win over the Spanish National
Team, 92-63.

Women's Basketball

Cardinal 92
Spanish Nationals 63

In their first game of the
season, the Cardinal — ranked
nationally from No. 4 to No. 1 in
various polls — gave a preview of
the season to come. They dis
played their familiar balanced of
fensive attack, with five players
scoring between 11 and 15 points
on the way to 92 total for the
team. Their defense was tenacious
as usual, holding Spain to a .367
field goal percentage and a grand
total of 63 points.
Same old same old.
The most interesting aspects of
the game were Stanford's control
of the boards and the play of its
freshmen.
Although it could hardly be
called a weakness, seemingly the
only category in which the Car
dinal did not dominate the Pacific
10 Conference last year was

rebounding. Generally the team
shot so well and defended so well
that it didn't matter, but when
they clashed with perennial power
Louisiana Tech in the Elite Eight,
they found that they were allow
ing Tech three or four tries at the
basket on every possession.
If Stanford will challenge the
powers of the South in 1989-90,
they will have to improve their
rebounding skills.
Spain, a large, highly physical
team, provided a good test of these
skills. Yesterday Stanford won the
battle of the boards 47-34 — not
a crushing margin but certainly
a substantial one.
Leading the way in providing
that substantial margin was 6-
foot-3 freshman Val Whiting, who
had a game-high 10 rebounds.
Whiting, who played for 23
minutes, tallied 14 points and
produced one of Stanford's two
blocks.
"Val looks sharp every day,"
said Coach Tara VanDerveer.
"She has great hands, great in
stincts, and a great attitude. She
is an absolute pleasure to coach."
But Whiting was not the only
freshman to impress. In only nine
minutes of play, 5-foot-6 guard
Molly Goodenbour scored seven
points, grabbed four rebounds and
dished out two assists as she
dazzled the crowd of 525 with her
almost Sonja Henning-like ball
control.
Goodenbour, who has joined
perhaps the deadliest backcourt

in the country in with Henning
and Jennifer Azzi, commented
that "Sometimes it gets frustrat
ing — I'm playing behind a couple
of [ potential] All-Americans. But
playing with Jennifer and Soi\ja
— they're only going to make me
better."
For now, "Jennifer and Sor\ja"
will remain the driving force be
hind the Cardinal with their spec
tacular and intelligent play.
Henning, a 5-foot-8 junior point
guard, pilfered the ball from the
Spaniards once and added one
block and a game-high 10 assists
as she demonstrated her charac
teristically unselfish play.
The nation's only returning Ail-
American, Azzi, a 5-foot-9 senior,
led Stanford with 15 points, nine
rebounds, two steals and six as
sists. Azzi awed the crowd several
times, including one particularly
bedazzling play.
Dribbling downcourt at top
speed when a Spaniard challenged
her, Azzi faked a change in direc
tion so well that the Spaniard fell
to the floor. Azzi then proceeded,
in equally dramatic fashion, to cut
through several defenders and
dump the ball to Whiting for the
basket.
Stanford will battle Ohio, Mich
igan State and Cincinnati Nov.
24-25 in the Communiplex Na
tional Hall of Fame Classic before
returning home Dec. 10.
There is a long season ahead,
but after one exhibition, the Car
dinal appear comfortable with
winning.
