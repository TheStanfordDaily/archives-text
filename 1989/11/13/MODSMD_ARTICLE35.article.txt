The touchdown run was set
up when the Chargers' Ken
Woodard partially blocked Jeff
Gossett's punt. San Diego's
Cedric Figaro recovered at the
Raiders 23, and Spencer ran it
in from five yards out on his
third carry in the four-play
drive.
Just minutes earlier, the
Chargers had lost a scoring op
portunity.
The Raiders' Jay Schroeder
was intercepted for a third time,

and cornerback Sam Seale's 25-
yard return positioned the
Chargers at the Raider 38.
After San Diego advanced to
the 11, Spencer broke through
the right side of the line and
appeared to be on his way to a
touchdown when he fumbled.
Mike Harden recovered for Los
Angeles.
But San Diego's defense held
the Raiders without a first
down. Woodard penetrated the
middle punt team protection
and got a hand on Gossett's
kick.
The Raiders fell to 5-5 despite
Bo Jackson's third 100-yard
rushing game. He had 103 yards
on 21 carries as the Raiders lost
for the second time in six games
since Art Shell replaced Mike
Shananhan as coach.
San Diego improved to 4-6.
Jeff Jaeger gave the Raiders
a 12-0 lead with his fourth field
goal, a 32-yarder with 5:26
remaining in the third period.
But 16 seconds later, Miller
put the Chargers on the board,
returning the ensuing kickoft
for the score. He took the ball
at the 9, angled toward the right

sideline and outran the Raiders'
pursuit to bring the Chargers
within five points.
The Raiders led 9-0 at
halftime on Jaeger field goals
covering 23, 36 and 33 yards.
Jaeger's third field goal came
with 15 seconds remaining in
the second period after the
Chargers gambled and lost on
a fourth-and-1 play from the
Raider 43.
Greg Townsend sacked Jim
McMahon for a 9-yard loss. The
Raiders took over at the San
Diego 48 with 52 seconds
remaining and Schroeder drove
them to the 8. After Schroeder
scrambled for two yards, he
threw two incompletions and
Jaeger came on for the field
goal.
Both the Chargers' and
Raiders' offensive units sput
tered in the first half.
McMahon completed only 5-
of-13 passes for 47 yards and
was intercepted once, while two
Schroeder-led drives ended in in
terceptions.
Penalties also stymied the San
Diego offense.
