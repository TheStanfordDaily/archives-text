After losing two matches at
home to two of the top five teams
in the country last week, the Stan
ford women*B volleyball team once
again seemed poised to relinquish
its hopes of post-season glory.
After this weekend, however,
those dreams seem alive and well.

Cardinal 3, Sun Devils 0
Cardinal 3, Wildcats 2

The Cardinal played the road
half of its conference matches
with the Arizona schools this
weekend, sweeping Arizona State
on Friday 15-9, 15-13, 15-5 before
battling to a five-game victory
over Arizona yesterday afternoon,
15-12, 10-15, 15-9, 9-15, 15-4.
Stanford traded games with a
determined Wildcat team yester
day before dominating the final
game. The Cardinal won in the
final game of the match on the
hitting and blocking of freshman
middle blocker Bev Oden. Oden
hit .326 for the match and tallied
four solo blocks with five block
assists, leading the defense to a
15-4 Cardinal victory in game

The Cardinal would
likely receive a high
bid in the NCAA
regionals with a
second-place confer
ence finish, a bid that
would allow Stanford
to host a first-round
match.

five.
Arizona was stymied by the
Cardinal defense in game five, hit
ting .000 on 32 total attacks. With
the loss, Arizona drops to 16-10
on the season with an 8-8 Pacific
10 Conference mark.
Stanford looked impressive on
Friday night while dominating the
Sun Devils. Laura Olesen, Kristin
Klein and Oden all tallied unbe
lievable numbers against a strug
gling Arizona State team which
hasn't won a conference match
since early October.
Olesen hit .632 for the match,
Oden tallied .532 and Klein added
a .433 mark to lead the team to
a .318 team hitting percentage for
the match. The Sun Devils were

able to muster only a .112 hitting
percentage for the match.
Although the match lasted for
only 91 minutes, the contest was
not without drama. Stanford
jumped out to an early lead in
the second game at 7-1 only to be
tied at 13-13. But the Cardinal
held tough to win 15-13.
Stanford, with the weekend vic
tories, has upped its record to 15-8
overall and 11-4 in the Pac-10.
Stanford holds second place in the
conference with three Pac-10
matches to be played. The Cardi
nal would likely receive a high
bid in the NCAA regionals with
a second-place conference finish,
a bid that would allow Stanford
to host a first-round match.
The Cardinal Tuesday hosts the
18th-ranked California Golden
Bears in the rescheduled contest
of the October 17 match canceled
due to the earthquake. This up
coming weekend Stanford hosts
its final regular-season home
matches when Washington and
Washington State visit Old Pavil
ion on Friday night and Sunday
afternoon respectively.
California and Washington are
each challenging the Cardinal in
the conference standings. Vic
tories over both the Bears and
the Huskies would give Stanford
a lock on second place.
