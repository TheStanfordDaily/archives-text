### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
In 1989, the Stanford wom
en's tennis team had all the in
gredients to dominate its
opponents and romp to a fourth
straight national championship.
Over the weekend, the Cardinal
demonstrated that the 1990 edi
tion might be even stronger due
to its new-found depth.
In the Rolex Regional Quali
fying Tournament at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium, No. 2 seed
Teri Whitlinger advanced to
today's final against top seed
Lisa Albano of California. The
match begins at 2 p.m.
With four of Stanford's top
singles players already qualified
and not competing, the Cardinal
still placed three in the quar
terfinals. In addition, minus its
two best doubles teams, Stan
ford still managed to put a duo
in the semifinals and another
in the quarters. The tournament

allowed Stanford to show off two
of its freshman — Mario Car
ruth and Heather Willens — to
the home crowd, and both im
pressed.
Willens recorded a pair of
straight-set victories en route to
the quarterfinals. There she
met Cal's Jean Marie Lozano
and fell in a tight match, 7-5,
6-3. Teamed with Kylie Johnson
in doubles, Willens reached the
quarterfinals as well. In a see
saw three setter, Johnson and
Willens were knocked out by the
University of the Pacific tandem
Leslie Powell and Lisa Matsus
hima, the No. 2 seeds, 6-2, 3-6,
6-3.
Carruth was upset by Veena
Probhaker in second-round
singles but, like Willens, excelled
in doubles. Carruth paired up
with senior Lisa Green and
made it all the way to the semi
finals. There, the Stanford pair
ran into the buzzs°w of Albano-

Lozano, the nation's fourth
ranked team, and lost 6-1, 6-2.
Whitlinger showed off her Ail-
American form yesterday. Bat
tling a much-improved Lozano,
Whitlinger controlled the match
throughout and captured a 6-2,
6-3 victory.
Johnson was disappointed
with her performance in her
semifinal match with Albano.
After dominating Cal's Emilie
Viqueira 6-2, 6-1 in Saturday's
quarterfinal, she never quite got
on track yesterday. Calling her
self "impatient," Johnson said
she "started making a lot of er
rors and never stopped." Albano
won the match 6-1, 6-4.
Senior Valerie Wilson won
two singles matches before
losing to Cal's Tiffiny Silveria.
Sophomore Carina Rolley beat
Nevada-Reno's Tracey King,
ranked 96th in the country, but
defaulted her second-round
match due to back trouble.
