### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team
beat University of the Pacific 5-3
on Saturday, but they were not
too happy about it.
Though the win raised the Car
dinal record to 25-7 and gave
them a three game sweep of the
Tigers this season, the game was
far from satisfying.

"The bottom line is that we
won, " Coach Dante Dettamanti
said.
Stanford beat Pacific 14-5 two
weeks ago, and accordingly, did
not take this game that seriously.
"We were pretty relaxed,"
junior Rick McNair said.
"Probably over relaxed."
Dettamanti admitted that it was
J "human nature" for his team to

have trouble getting pysched for
the game, but he still was not
nlpo Qpn
"We didn't play well," Det
tamanti said. "We weren't shoot
ing well, we weren't countering
well. We were definitely looking
past this game."
Despite a mediocre effort, Stan
ford dominated the game and
never trailed.
Stanford got on the scoreboard
first when Erik Blum took a pass
from Steve Millham at the two
meter mark to make the game
1-0 . After Pacific missed on a
man-up opportunity, Greg Loos
connected on a strong upper
corner shot to put the Cardinal
ahead 2-0 with 2:53 left in the
quarter.
Strong goal tending by Todd
Kemp thwarted another Pacific
power play, and the buzzer
sounded with the Tigers scoreless.
The second quarter saw both
teams hampered by sloppy offense
and missed shots. The score re

mained the same until Blum got
called for a penalty that resulted
in a four meter penalty shot for
Pacific. Kelly Porter scored to cut
the Cardinal lead to 2-1.
The activity in the water livened
up a bit in the third quarter as
Colin Keely tipped in a Millham
pass to put the Cardinal up 3-1
early. Stanford missed its first six
on-five opportunity of the game,
but connected on its second when
Jon Swerdloff scored during the
confusion of Mike Doran's ejec
tion.
Pacific cut the lead back to 4-2
when Dave Johnson was spotted
all alone on the wing and took in
a pass to score.
McNair stole the ball from a
Pacific attacker to open up the
fourth quarter and Jeff Oeding
put Stanford up 5-2 on a shot
from two meters out.
"It was a good workout,"
Oeding said. "We would have liked
to have beaten them by more, but
at least we didn't make any men
tal mistakes."
