# University denies relief priority push
## 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
An East Bay legislator is con
tinuing his protest of Stanford's
lobbying efforts to secure state
funding for earthquake relief, but
one of the University's key lob
byists in the affair denies that
Stanford will swipe the limited
funds away from more needy
recipients.
State Sen. Bill Lockyer, D-
Hayward, accused Stanford of
using high-pressure lobbyists and
alumni contacts in the California
State Legislature to outmaneuver
organizations such as homeless
shelters that are also seeking
funds.
"It's simply not right when
Stanford has the kind of resources
behind it that are three and four
times the size of the state budget
surplus, that they should be able
to secure limited resources ahead
of other limited-resources
groups," Lockyer said in a tele
phone interview yesterday.
The lobbying effort came just
more than a week ago when the
Legislature hammered out a 12-
bill earthquake-relief package
that included a provision for non
profit organizations such as Stan
ford to receive state disaster
funds.
But Larry Horton, acting vice
president for Public Affairs,
heatedly denied Lockyer's claim
that Stanford will have priority
over any other group in the funds
allocation process.
"What Stanford was arguing for
was to make sure state law con
formed with federal law so that
all non-profit organizations that
comply will be eligible for funds,"
Horton said. "No one ever hinted
there would be a priority for Stan
ford; it is only one of many or
ganizations affected.
"We're accused of outman
euvering others. All we were doing

was determining eligibility," said
Horton, who shared the
Sacramento lobbying task with
Vice President and General Coun
sel John Schwartz.
Horton estimated that an as
sessment of damage being con
ducted by federal inspectors will
cover about $95 million of the
$160 million in damage suffered
on campus. The federal govern
ment is expected to pay for 75
percent of the $95 million, and if
funds are available, the state will
pick up the remaining 25 percent,
according to the legislation.
If funds are not sufficient, Hor
ton said, private institutions will
be able to make claims up to $5
million. Horton added that he did
not know how the funds will be
allocated and emphasized that

Stanford may not get any funds
in the end.
"It's just b.5.," Lockyer
retorted. "The Stanford people
are professional lobbyists. They
fought hard for a week to make
sure they'd be eligible for money.
They didn't do that thinking they
wouldn't get any."
Lockyer, a graduate of UC-
Berkeley, raised the same objec
tions in committee and on the
floor during the Legislature's
deliberations.
"He stated his opinion very
forcefully, and people didn't buy
it," Horton said. "It's not as if
it's anything new, and it's not as
though the legislators passed [the
bill] without knowing what they
were doing. They disagreed with
him."
