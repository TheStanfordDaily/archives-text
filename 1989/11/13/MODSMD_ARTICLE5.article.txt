Xi houses will be closed win
ter quarter and possibly the
rest of the year, Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Diana
Conklin said last night.
Conklin, who is director
of the Row, said she learned
of the decision late Friday
from Student Housing Op
erations Manager Suzanne
Tamiesie. Tamiesie could
not be reached for comment.
Though the three houses
have been definitely closed
only through winter quar
ter, Conklin said she has
told the resident assistants
of the houses to assume the
displacement will be for the
rest of the year.
"Limbo is a terrible place
to be. I suggested that they
consider it as the rest of the
year for the sake of their
nerves," she said.
The University originally
announced that the houses
would be closed at least
through fall quarter because
of damage from the Oct. 17
earthquake.
