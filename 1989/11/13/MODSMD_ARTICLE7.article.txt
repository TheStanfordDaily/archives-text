### Ed Palattella Staff writer 
A Stanford sophomore was in
surgery at Stanford Hospital last
night for a severe neck injury he
suffered after falling on his head
during an intramural football
game yesterday afternoon.
Greg Smith, 19, of McLean, Va.,
was listed in serious condition at
the hospital before he went into
surgery at 5 p.m., said Mary
Durando, the charge nurse in the
emergency room. Smith was
brought to the emergency room
at 1:15 p.m., Durando said.
Smith, a resident of Schiff
House, was in surgery until about

9:45 p.m. A nursing supervisor
said at 10:30 p.m. that Smith was
still very sedated, and the success
of the surgery could not be de
termined. The supervisor said she
did not know if Smith would be
paralyzed because of the injury.
The incident occurred about 1
p.m. during a game between the
Whitman House B Team —
Smith's team — and a chemistry
department team, said Joseph
Martinez, captain of the W : hitman
team. The game was played on
Field Two, near Stanford Stadi

ball. The two became tangled in
the air, and Smith landed on the
back of his neck with the other
player landing on top of him, Mar
tinez said.
Smith was conscious after the
accident but could not move, Mar
tinez said. Some players on both
teams called an ambulance shortly

after Smith was hurt. The other
player was not injured.
The incident was clearly an ac
cident, Martinez said. "This was
the cleanest game I've seen in my
three years here," he said.
Justin Adams, another Whit
man player, said Smith and the
other person "pretty much just
got tangled."
Smith is a trumpet player and
librarian for the Stanford Band.
The Whitman team is mostly com
posed of band members, Martinez
said.
Members of Smith's family were
notified and were on their way to
Stanford from Virginia Sunday
night, the nursing supervisor said.
