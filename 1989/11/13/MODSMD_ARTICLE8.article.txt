# Outdoor Education Program discontinued
## Director steps down, financial constraints prevent hiring of new coordinator 
### Ari Richter 
Due to financial constraints in hiring a new
coordinator, the Outdoor Education Program
at Stanford will be discontinued at the end
of winter quarter, when the current director
steps down.
Wally Mann, a graduate student who co
founded the program in 1987 and has volun
teered as its general coordinator since its
inception, is no longer able to make a full-time
commitment, and the funding for a full-time
replacement is not forthcoming.
The current term marks the seventh con
secutive quarter in which Mann and fellow
volunteers have offered, in conjunction with
the Athletic Department, a one-unit class
called "Wilderness Skills." Consisting of one
class meeting per week as well as four outings

per quarter, this class has sought to make its
students skilled in taking trips into the wil
derness.
Mann has submitted a proposal to the Ath
letic Department outlining the benefits of out
door education and asking the department to
hire a full-time coordinator and staff.
However, the proposal, which also includes
guidelines and estimated costs for an expan
sion of the program, has been rejected by the
department.
Asst. Athletic Director Shirley Schoof ex
plained that the Athletic Department never
intended to continue to offer the wilderness
skills class afler Mann's departure.
Schoof admitted that Mann's proposal has
merits and that the class provides "a positive
outdoor learning experience." However, she
noted, "We need to fulfill financial commit

ments to other programs which have been in
existence longer than [the Outdoor Education
Program]."
Saying that the Athletic Department was
"basically in full support of the program,"
Schoof added that the program "could become
huge — but we have no teachers, and we
have no money."
Mann said that although he is fully aware
of the Athletic Department's financial diffi
culties, he feels his program is being slighted.
"It's a question of priorities," Mann said. The
class provides a "unique" experience to the
Stanford community, he added
Schoof did say that a volunteer program
could be carried on through the Tresidder
Union programs. Such action would relegate
the program to the status of a
club activity, eliminating the op
portunity for participants to
receive academic credit.
Neither Mann nor Tresidder
Union Program Coordinator
Nancy Noelke wants the wilder
ness class to become a club activ
ity, however. In a letter written
to express her support for Mann's
proposal to the Athletic Depart
ment, Noelke pointed out "the
need for a fully developed and
supported outdoor education pro
gram, and thus a full-time pro
fessional to oversee it.
"With outdoor education comes
the risk of personal injury,"
Noelke added. "It would seem to
me that Stanford would want to
reduce its potential liability by
hiring a full-time professional."
Noting that it would be "a
shame to let the program disap
pear," Mann said he is still search
ing for ways to preserve and in

fact expand the wilderness skills
class.
Since the rejection of his pro
posal by the Athletic Department,
Mann has sought the support of
Carolyn Lujet, the dean for the
Athletic Department and plans to
appeal to Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Tom Wasow as well as
the School of Education.
In addition, a newly formed
campus chapter of the Sierra Club
is working to drum up support
for Mann's proposal.
This quarter, 12 students are
enrolled in the wilderness skills
class, which has 11 volunteer in
structors. As a result, the teachers
are able to emphasize the par
ticipatory aspect of class and
foster the sense of trust among
the students that is crucial to the
success and safety of the outings,
Mann said.
"The most important thing to
me is that this is not a recreation
class," Mann said. "Stanford is so
competitive; by design, we are not.
But that doesn't mean we aren't
challenging people. It's another
side of education, one we take
very seriously."
