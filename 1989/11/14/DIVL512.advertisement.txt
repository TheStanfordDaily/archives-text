SUPPORT WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE
On November 12, hundreds of thousands of women and men marched in Washington D.C. and around the country in support of women's
reproductive freedom.
We, the undersigned, strongly support these demonstrations. It must be the right of all women to make their own reproductive decisions, and this
right must include access to safe, legal abortion.
This fall, the U.S. Supreme Court will be ruling on several cases concerning the right to abortion. We strongly oppose any attempt by the Court
to use these cases to overturn Roe v. Wade, or to further erode the right to abortion that it established.
Women's right to choose has already been restricted by legislation limiting public funding for abortion, and mandating parental consent to
abortion for minors. We urge all concerned persons to join together to oppose these and similar restrictions at the state and national level.
We must not and will not return to the days of illegal, back alley abortions that took the lives of thousands of women.

A 1973 law requires the Governor to
declare abortion illegal if the

of Family Planning by two thirds.

Minnesota, a 1981 law that requires a minor to notify
both parents prior to having an abortion, regardless of
whether they are divorced, have never married, or are
barred by a protective order from visiting the minor.
Illinois
The case Ragsdale v. Turnock is scheduled to be heard by the Court on December 6. It centers
