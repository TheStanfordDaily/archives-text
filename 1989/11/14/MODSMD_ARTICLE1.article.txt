# No changes in IMs expected
## Sophomore in stable condition after paralyzing injury

A paralyzing injury suffered during an intramural
football game Sunday has sparked a review of IM
related injuries by Cowell Student Health Center,
but the director of intramural sports said no changes
will be made in the program.
"Why should we change because of one incident?"
said IM director Howard Dallmar. Stanford sopho
more Greg Smith was paralyzed from the neck
down Sunday after he collided with another player
and landed on the back of his neck.
Smith suffered a multiple cervical spine fracture
in the football accident. He underwent surgery at
Stanford Hospital Sunday evening and was listed
in stable condition in the intensive care unit late
yesterday.
Hospital officials said yesterday that they did not
know if Smith's paralysis will be permanent.
• While Dallmar called the accident unfortunate,
he did not feel that Smith's injury resulted from
any avoidable circumstances. "We have injuries con
sistently," he said. "Anybody that's going to compete
in sports has to expect injuries; that's the way
sports are."
According to the IM program's assistant student
director, Eric Pane, there was not merely one in
cident involving injuries last weekend. "There were
more than the usual number of accidents," said
Pane. "We had 10 pretty big injuries this weekend."
In fact, Harvey Weinstein, acting director of

Cowell, said 18 students were treated for IM-related
injuries over the weekend. "It seemed like an awful
lot to us," Weinstein said.
The injuries ranged from finger dislocations to
lacerations to fractures.
Weinstein said he has asked John Dorman, as
sistant director of Cowell, to review the IM-related
cases Cowell has seen this year and compare pre
vious weekends with last weekend.
"We want to try to get a sense of whether this
is a change or if it's worse," Weinstein said.
Pane thought the unusually high number of in
juries over the weekend could be explained by the
fact that intramural games were played on both
Saturday and Sunday. "Usually we schedule games
on Sundays only," he said.
According to Pane, some intramural athletes
played for more than one team on both days of
play last weekend. "That might explain why there
were more injuries," he said.
Pane, who was supervising the program on the
day of the accident, said that on the surface Smith's
injury "didn't seem like a violent one."
"He was calm and conscious, lying on his back,"
Pane said. "He couldn't move, but he was respond
ing to questions." Pane said that the calm reaction
of other students as well was responsible for the
speed with which Smith received emergency care.
"The officials at the game informed the supervi
sor, the supervisor called the paramedics, and the
paramedics and the fire department responded
within five minutes," Dallmar «aid.
