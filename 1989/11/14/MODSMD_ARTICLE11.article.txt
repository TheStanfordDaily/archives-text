SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
(AP) — Rebels held large parts
of several poor neighborhoods yes
terday and battled soldiers in a
third day of the worst fighting
the capital has experienced in a
decade of civil war.
At least 305 had been killed and
378 wounded since the rebels at
tacked Saturday night in their
biggest offensive since 1981, ac
cording to the armed forces mor
tuary, civilian morgues and hospi
tals and unofficial military fig
ures.
Thousands of civilians were
trapped in their homes by ex
changes of gunfire between the
army and guerrillas of the leftist
Farabundo Marti National Liber
ation Front. Helicopter gunships
and military planes flew over the
city to attack rebel positions.
Few of the city's 1 million
people were on the streets and
nearly all downtown stores were
closed.
Rebels were holding ground in
an arc of heavily populated north
ern districts.
Military planes fired rockets
yesterday afternoon into the east
ern neighborhoods of Venecia and
Conacaste, trying to drive out
guerrillas. Some rockets struck
homes, killing several civilians
and wounding others.
Ricardo Alexander Perdomo,
12, said in a hospital: "A bomb
hit the house and killed my
mother and my little sister. A
plane dropped the bomb." He said

'It's our belief that they are in control of
the situation at this point... at this point
(US involvement) is not anticipated.'

guerrillas gave him first aid.
U.S. Embassy sources said
about 1,500 rebels were fighting
in the city. Heavy combat also
was reported in Santa Ana, a west
ern province, in San Miguel ty
the east, around the central city
of Zacatecoluca and outside
Usulutan, a major city in eastern
El Salvador.
The army press office stopped
providing casualty counts or other
information and telephone calls
to provincial cities did not go
through.
Officials at the armed forces
mortuary said it had the bodies
of 67 soldiers and military sources
said 127 guerrillas had been
killed. Morgues reported the
bodies of 51 civilians.
Hospitals said 258 civilians had
been wounded. On Sunday, the
armed forces reported 65 soldiers
and 55 guerrillas wounded.
The U.S. Embassy said 86 sol
diers, 202 guerrillas and 17
civilians had been killed, a total
of 305. Its count of 373 wounded
included 189 soldiers, 96 rebels

and 88 civilians, the embassy said,
and 43 guerrillas were captured.
Rosales Hospital, a government
institution, was without water,
blood plasma, anaesthetics and
other supplies, said Dr. Fausto
Cea Gil, the director. Stretchers
lined hallways outside emergency
rooms.
President Alfredo Cristiani an
nounced a state of siege and a 6
p.m.-6 a.m. curfew Sunday and
legislators were considering more
restrictions on civil rights.
The Bush administration said
Cristiani's government had not re
quested U.S. assistance in repel
ling the rebel attack.
"It's our belief that they are in
control of the situation at this
point," said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater. Asked
whether he would rule out U.S.
involvement in the fighting, he
said: "At this point it's not antic
ipated."
Fifty-five U.S. military trainers
are stationed in El Salvador but
are not supposed to participate in
military missions. Fitzwater said
their status was unchanged.
