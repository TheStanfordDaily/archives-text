# East German parliament elects premier, protests continue
## 
### 
BERLIN (AP) â€” East Germany's Par
liament elected a leading reformer as the
new premier last night, but hundreds of
thousands of protesters took to the streets
of Leipzig to say Communist reforms are
moving too slowly.
After a historic weekend in which mil
lions of East Germans took advantage of
their new freedom to travel west, Par
liament also picked a non-Communist
speaker in the chamber's first secret bal
lot and urged accelerated changes.
And the government said it was dis
mantling internal barriers that for three

decades formed a notorious "death strip"
between the Berlin Wall and the city's
sealed-off eastern sector.
Deputies appealed for truly free elec
tions, a coalition government and removal
from the constitution of language declar
ing their nation a socialist state.
The parliament, known as the People's
Chamber, then approved the Communist
Party's nomination of Politburo member
Hans Modrow to lead a new government
as premier. The government traditionally
has been subservient to the party.
Modrow is a well-known reformer

within the party, which has been led by
Egon Krenz since Oct. 18. Krenz has
promised some reforms, including free
elections.
As deputies argued into the night in
East Berlin, pro-democracy activists in
Leipzig, in the center of the country,
pressed for continued change to prolong
the spirit of hope sweeping the nation.
West German television estimated the
number of protesters at 200,000 to
300,000.
The protesters urged the government
to live up to its promise of free elections

and questioned the commitment of the
new leadership.
"The question is, are you (the new
government) really different from the
others?" one speaker said at the rallv.
At the session to approve Modrow, the
first secret balloting in the Communist
dominated Parliament elected a new
speaker, Guenther Maleuda, who told the
assembly it was duty-bound to heed the
calls of the reform movement.
Maleuda, 58, is the chairman of the
Democratic Peasants Party, one of the
four small parties allied with the ruling

Communists. The Communist Party did
not propose a candidate for the post.
In addition to the parliamentary ses
sion, the party's 163-member Central
Committee set Dec. 15 for an emergency
party congress that will elect a new lead
ership and rewrite its political platform.
The party, which has had a monopoly
on power in the 40 years since East Ger
many was created, is struggling to meet
the pent-up demands of about 16 million
citizens who have watched their Commu
nist neighbors restore democracy while
thev were denied the same freedoms.
