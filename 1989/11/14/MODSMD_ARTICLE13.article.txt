# Bush honors Walesa

WASHINGTON (AP)
President Bush bestowed the
presidential Medal of Freedom
on Lech Walesa in an emotional
White House ceremony yester
day and promised "American
aid has begun and more is com
ing" to Poland.
"Lech Walesa showed how
one individual could inspire in
others a faith so powerful that
it vindicated itself, and changed
the course of a nation," Bush
said, referring to the 1981 mar
tial law crackdown against the
first free trade union in the
Soviet Bloc and its rise to
power this year.
"History may make men, but
Lech Walesa has made history,"
Bush said.
As the president spoke of the
crackdown and Walesa's 11
months incarceration, Walesa's
eyes filled with tears.
The Polish trade union
leader arrived in Washington
as the Senate reached a bipar
tisan compromise on a plan to
give $657 million in aid to
Poland and $65 million to Hun
gary, ending a long battle over
the proper scale of aid to those
countries.
Walesa's trip to the White
House was the first stop on a
U.S. tour that will include a
speech to Congress, a private
dinner at the White House and
attendance at the annual con
vention of the AFL-CIO, the
American trade union federa
tion.

Walesa and his "fellow
workers in a brave union called
Solidarity" are shattering the
communist hold on Eastern
Europe, said Bush.
"The iron curtain is fast be
coming a rusted abandoned
relic, symbolizing a lost era and
failed ideology," he said.
And Walesa's example, said
the president, "was mirrored
across Asia when 'People
Power' became a chant, first
heard in the Philippines, then
in Pakistan, and South Korea,
and yes, even in Tiananmen
Square" where Chinese stu
dents demonstrated last sum
mer.
The president, who has been
criticized by Democrats in Con
gress for not doing enough to
stimulate change in the Soviet
Bloc, pointedly welcomed "Lech
Walesa — a man of freedom"
to "the White House — the
house of freedom."
The mustachioed trade un
ion leader was due back at the
White House tonite for a
private dinner with President
Bush.
Tomorrow, Walesa is sched
uled to address a joint meeting
of Congress, the first foreigner
without a government job to do
so since the American Revolu
tionary War hero the Marquis
de Lafayette, a Frenchman,
spoke there in 1824.
After leaving Washington on
Thursday, Walesa was to visit
New York, Chicago, Philadel
phia and Caracas, Venezuela.
