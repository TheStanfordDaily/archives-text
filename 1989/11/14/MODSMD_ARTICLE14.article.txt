# Bush downplays abortion issue in election
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House
suggested yesterday that abortion will not be
a deciding factor in next year's elections and
said that divergent views were a "matter of
principle," not an issue of politics.
A conciliatory Marlin Fitzwater, the presi
dent's spokesman, also voiced belated recogni
tion to Sunday's abortion-rights rallies in
Washington and around the country.
"We certainly approve of the rally and are
glad that they've (participants) exercised their
right to speak out," Fitzwater said of the
Washington gathering.
Fitzwater's comments came in the after
math of last week's elections, in which Re
publican candidates who share Bush's anti

abortion views were defeated by pro-choice
Democrats.
But Fitzwater suggested that, in spite of
weeks of tough anti-abortion talk and two
vetoes of abortion-financing legislation, Bush
has no quarrel with those who support abor
tion rights.
Sunday's rally in the capital "was expressing
the views of a lot of people who feel very
strongly and very deeply about that subject,"
Fitzwater said. "Abortion is an issue that
people feel strongly about on both sides. It's
a matter of principle."
Bush favors an anti-abortion amendment to
the Constitution. He vetoed two spending bills
that would have expande Medicaid coverage

to pay for abortions for poor women in cases
of rape or incest.
At a news conference Tuesday, Bush said
that both the Democratic and Republican par
ties are "broad enough to contain differing
views on this."
Asked about polls suggesting pro-choice po
sitions helped Democratic gubernatorial can
didates in New Jersey and Virginia last week,
and in the New York mayor's race, Fitzwater
said, "We think there were a lot of issues.
"Any number of factors resulted in the vic
tories and the losses for the particular can
didates there. Abortion was an important
issue. But ... people don't decide elections on
one issue," he said.
