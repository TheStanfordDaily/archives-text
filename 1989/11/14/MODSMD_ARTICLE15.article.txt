testing of Boston police officers, providing
new evidence that the justices are willing

employees in jobs affecting public safety.

the tests even when there is no reason
to suspect drug abuse does not violate
their privacy rights.

tions against any country that uses chemical

ing the Persian Gulf war and against its
own Kurdish minority

Boeing must pay fines
ALEXANDRIA, Ya. (AP) — The Boeing
Co. pleaded guilty yesterday to two felony
charges of "unauthorized conveyance" of se
cret Pentagon budget documents and agreed
to pay more than $5.2 million in fines and
restitution.
U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis 111 accepted
the plea, entered by attorney Robert S. Ben
nett, after questioning company and gov
ernment lawyers for nearly an hour. He said
he was concerned that the plea and penalties
agreed to might not sufficiently cover what
he called "a very serious breach of security."
Ellis said he wanted a "clear indication
that the disposition bears a rational rela
tionship to the injury to the United States
and reflects an awareness on the part of
the Being Co. of the gravity of it."
