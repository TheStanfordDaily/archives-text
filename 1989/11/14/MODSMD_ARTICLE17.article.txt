SEXUAL ASSAULT is the
most underreported crime in
America. Society's ignorance
and warped attitude about the
crime — blaming or disbelieving
the victim — are some primary
reasons for this sad fact.
However, despite the difficulty
encountered by people who report
on this campus, someone did make
the effort to report an alleged
sexual assault at an Oct. 6 party
at the Delta Kappa Epsilon frater
nity house.
Unfortunately, Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Hughes, who took
over the investigation for Student
Affairs last week, made comments
that are symptomatic of the atti
tude that prevents people from
reporting sexual assaults.
Hughes' first reaction was to try
to dismiss the report as rumor —
prioritizing defense of the frater
nity rather than find the alleged
rapist.
Immediately after he took over

the investigation, Hughes said the
lack of substantiated evidence and
the "credibility" of the report "led
me to believe that the incident did
not occur."
What kind of assumptions are
these at the beginning of a rape
investigation?
As fraternal affairs adviser,
Hughes could be expected to make
such a ranking of priorities. But
as investigator of the alleged as
sault, the remarks were wholly ir
responsible and embody the atti
tude that make people more afraid
to report sexual abuse.
Meanwhile, if the assault did oc
cur, somewhere a woman suffers
the destructive, traumatic after
math of sexual assualt. Even if the
assault did not occur, other assault
victims are only further discour
aged from appealing for justice to
such a warped investigating body.
People should be encouraged and
be made to feel comfortable report
ing a rape.
