# Farewell to flames

### 
The axe committee
made a wise move by decid
ing not to hold the 1989 Big
Game bonfire Thursday night.
Organizing an event that nor
mally takes months to coordinate
in eight days — aside from being
difficult — would have raised some
serious doubts about the safety of
the bonfire.
The committee would have had
to collect and assemble hundreds
of wooden palettes, arrange light
ing, entertainment and security,
and provide for emergency serv
ices.
An event thrown together in just
over a week could not have been
particularly safe, and if something
were to go wrong, future bonfires
would surely have been in jeopardy.

The bonfire was originally can
celed because the Axe Committee
was denied its fee request in the
spring ASSU election and did not
have the funds for the event.
Students who yearly look forward
to the gathering in the dry lakebed
of Lake Lagunita, and new stu
dents who have never witnessed a
Big Game bonfire, may be disap
pointed this year. Yet some of these
disappointed bonfire fans may be
the same students who voted
against the Axe Committee in the
spring.
Students who miss the bonfire
this year should make an effort to
ensure that they and their friends
vote for the Axe Committee this
spring and avoid the absence of
the traditional Big Game bonfire
for two years in a row.
