Earthquake jokes can be medicine in time of pain

IN THE 1985 Mexico City earth
quake it was reported that one
old-timer was rescued 15 minutes
after the earthquake. But he came out
cussing and cursing at everyone of his
rescuers. The old man claimed he had
been buried since the 1957 earthquake.
It didn't take long for the Mexicans
to invent jokes about their earthquake,
and in the Bay Area some humor was
coming out but not appreciated by all,
especially those who had suffered the
most. The earthquake was too recent.
But for Mexico, a country so used to
tragedy and adversity, humor has at
times been the only quick panacea.
Recommendations for those living in
earthquake-prone areas: If you wear a
wig, dentures or glass eye, have them
ready so as not to surprise your neigh

bors with your baldness, toothless
grins or empty eye socket.
Be religious, but don't hang heavy
crucifixess or other objects above your
bed. Place any figurines and glassware
you don't like close to the edge of
shelves, along with a picture of your
in-laws. If you need keys to get out,
have them handy. It is very difficult to
gnaw and bite your way out. Another
recommendation is to tie a bone
around your neck. In case of being
buried alive, a dog will easily find you.
A woman was angered because she
had planned a brunch for her seventh
floor neighbors, and those on the
eighth, ninth and tenth floors had also
"dropped in."
One man serenaded his girlfriend
with mariachis below her second floor
apartment and was hit with falling

bricks. He was offended, saying "She
didn't have to do that; a flower pot
would have been sufficient."
The classified ads were another place
for humor: "For Sale. Great opportu
nity. Recently constructed building with
the exact specifications as the leaning
Tower of Pisa."
Humor, it is said, comes from pain.
Humor can be very irreverant and
some wounds are too painful and too
recent to make light of them. Such is
the case with Bay Area earthquake
humor. Nonetheless it exists and serves
a purpose.
According to some medical experts,
humor has the power of releasing
endorphins, peptides secreted in the
brain that have a pain-relieving effect.
For others, humor is the only release.
In Mexico, the earthquake struck on

top of a jello-bottomed economy and
many urban ills from pollution to
corruption. Their jokes were many,
quick and furious.
So perhaps it is too early to tell Bay
Area earthquake jokes, except for two
on Vice President Dan Quayle's visit.
One had the vice president very happy
when President George Bush dis
patched him to the epicenter of the
earthquake. Quayle thought he was
going to the Epcot Center in Dis
neyworld, Florida.
The other explained the reason San
Francisco Mayor Art Agnos was so
upset with the Vice President's visit.
The mayor couldn't deal with two
natural disasters.
