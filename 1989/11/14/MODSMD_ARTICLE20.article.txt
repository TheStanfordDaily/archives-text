# Wilderness course valuable asset to Stanford curriculum
## 
### 
Stanford soon may lose one of its
most popular classes — Athletics 60,
or Wilderness Skills. The Athletics
Department is uncomfortable with Wil
derness Skills' current system of volun
teer instructors, and the Department
will not provide funding for a paid
instructor. Unless a compromise is
reached, the course will be dropped
after this spring.
Wilderness Skills gives students the
opportunity to learn camping and
mountaineering techniques in a small
class setting. The course meets one
evening a week to discuss the basics of
outdoor survival — everything from
first aid to backcountry cooking.
But there is much more to Wilder
ness Skills than knot-tying, belaying

and minimum-impact camping. Stu
dents learn to appreciate the wilder
ness, to trust others and to interact in
small groups, as well as working to
gether with people with diverse inter
ests and backgrounds.
Students obviously appreciated the
special opportunities this class pro
vides. In three short years, Wilderness
Skills has established quite a reputa
tion; the sign-up sheet always fills
within 15 minutes of registration time
and this fall two students camped out
overnight in White Plaza to ensure
spaces on the class list. Many gradu
ates of the course have stayed involved
with the program and become instruc
tors.
Although I understand the economic
considerations of the Athletics Depart
ment, if Wilderness Skills is eliminated,
Stanford will lose an enormously valu
able and unique part of its curriculum.
