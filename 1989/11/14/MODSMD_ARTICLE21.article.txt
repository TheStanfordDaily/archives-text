# Campus AIDS quilt should serve as permanent reminder
## 
### 
I would like to praise the people
responsible for the placement around
campus of panels from the AIDS quilt.
Gratitude should also go to the admin
istrators who agreed to have the panels
hung in their buildings.
I wish the panels could hang at
Stanford indefinitely. They not only
serve as a reminder that the AIDS
epidemic continues to rage across the
globe unabated, but also because they
tell a beautiful story about the people
who died from this terrible disease.
Whenever I see the panels, I pray that
a cure will be found and the dying will
stop.
