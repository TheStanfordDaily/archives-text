## Biased news is necessary 
### 
"Were it left for me to decide whether we
should have a government without news
papers, or newspapers without a govern
ment, I should not hesitate a moment to
prefer the latter. But I should mean that
every man should receive those papers
and be capable of reading them."
— Thomas Jefferson
LOS ANGELES HAS a major death
on its hands. It wasn't too well
publicized because it wasn't the
death of a film star, rock singer or multi
billionaire.
It was the death of a newspaper. The
Los Angeles Herald Examiner died at age
118 on November 2, 1989.
So what's the big deal? People can just
read the Los Angeles Times and pick up
USA Today if they want a second news
paper. The problem is that this is not an
isolated death.
There is an epidemic of rf4v**p4£fer fail
ures across the United States. Very few
cities have two papers anymore and
having three papers is unheard of.
It seems like one paper would be
enough. Newspapers are for news, and,
as long as there is one objective view, no
one needs any more.
Nevertheless, no matter how objective
any newspaper tries to be, it will leave
out some facts and choose to put this
story on the front page over that one.
Indeed, by selecting which stories to
print, a newspaper is going to show some
biases.
Often these biases are a good thing.
Consider Thomas Jefferson's quote. He'd
choose newspapers over government. The

newspapers he'd choose aren't the full
color, up-to-the-minute sports, gossip
tabloids which USA Today proudly rep
resents.
He is referring to newpapers as arenas
for public opinion. Newspapers once were
very biased. Their purpose when our
country was founded was to convince
people of this position over that.
Today, newspapers with biases are con
demned. Many students don't like The
Daily because of its liberal orientation. I
believe The Daily is far too Stanford
centric. Just one month ago, the Daily's
headline claimed, "7.0 Quake Rocks Stan
ford."
Did I miss something or did the earth
quake actually hit the whole bay area?
The Daily obviously contributes to our
Stanford shell.
But in reality The Daily has every right
to be obnoxiously biased. A newspaper
is not meant merely to report facts .such
as how many murders occurred the night
before.
By provoking people and causing them
to consider why they believe what they
do, a so-called biased newspaper actually
fills a gap in society.
A good newspaper is one not afraid to
print ultra-conservative or "loony-left"
columns and articles. It allows people to
react against vices and form their own
ideas. A great example of the value of
this dialogue between newspaper and
reader can be seen with my last column.
In my column I failed to distinguish
between animal welfare and animal
rights. Luckily, Rachel Meyer was there
to set the record straight. I intended to
justify using animals in research because

many radical groups believe no animals
should be used. These groups are dan
gerous.
My stance was equally dangerous in
sofar that I promoted a cruel sense of
"this is the way things are, we can't
change them now." In pointing out the
impracticality of banning research
animals in scientific research, I failed to
emphasize our need to respect animals.
Many mornings people tell me "so-and
so" really ragged on your column. For
the most part, I'm happy to hear that.
Naturally I don't like it when my quotes
Are taken out of context or when people
stereotype But in general it's great
to see so many people at Stanford con
cerned about so many issues.
So while I mourn the death of L.A.'s
second largest paper, I am thankful that
Stanford is not this limited. Indeed, I'd
personally like to thank The Stanford
Review. No joke. No sarcasm intended. I
want to thank them because whether I
agree with their opinions or not, the
people at The Review provide a forum
in which members of the Stanford com
munity can voice their ideas — even if
they are in desperate need of a
proofreader.

The Daily obviously contributes to our
Stanford shell.
But in reality The Daily has every right
to be obnoxiously biased. A newspaper
is not meant merely to report facts .such
as how many murders occurred the night
before.
By provoking people and causing them
to consider why they believe what they
do, a so-called biased newspaper actually
fills a gap in society.
A good newspaper is one not afraid to
print ultra-conservative or "loony-left"
columns and articles. It allows people to
react against vices and form their own
ideas. A great example of the value of
this dialogue between newspaper and
reader can be seen with my last column.
In my column I failed to distinguish
between animal welfare and animal
rights. Luckily, Rachel Meyer was there
to set the record straight. I intended to
justify using animals in research because

many radical groups believe no animals
should be used. These groups are dan
gerous.
My stance was equally dangerous in
sofar that I promoted a cruel sense of
"this is the way things are, we can't
change them now." In pointing out the
impracticality of banning research
animals in scientific research, I failed to
emphasize our need to respect animals.
Many mornings people tell me "so-and
so" really ragged on your column. For
the most part, I'm happy to hear that.
Naturally I don't like it when my quotes
Are taken out of context or when people
stereotype But in general it's great
to see so many people at Stanford con
cerned about so many issues.
So while I mourn the death of L.A.'s
second largest paper, I am thankful that
Stanford is not this limited. Indeed, I'd
personally like to thank The Stanford
Review. No joke. No sarcasm intended. I
want to thank them because whether I
agree with their opinions or not, the
people at The Review provide a forum
in which members of the Stanford com
munity can voice their ideas — even if
they are in desperate need of a
proofreader.
