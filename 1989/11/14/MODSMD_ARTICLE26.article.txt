## Smooth transition and peace needed in Europe's time of changes 
### 
A SPECTRE IS HAUNTING
Eastern Europe — the spectre of
democracy. The Communist
powers of Eastern Europe are scram
bling to reform their societies so that
they can preserve order in face of this
spectre.
One hundred and forty years ago
Karl Marx wrote the "Communist
Manifesto." At that time he was still a
young man but convinced that he had
uncovered the scientific laws of human
behavior.
The year was 1848 and Marx was
anticipating the dawn of revolutions to
come in Europe and elsewhere. He
called on Communists to unite and
proclaim their common goals.
Today Communists in the "ad
vanced" socialist countries, the so
called second world, face a different
dilemma. They finally need to take a
hard and honest look at the societies
they were creating according to the
Marxist prescription.
They have to face the contradictions
of their "scientific" theory with the

harsh reality that exists in their coun
tries.
Over the past century democratic
revolutions across the world from
Europe to Latin America were inspired
by Marx's writing. Revolutionaries saw
the truth and the power of Marxism.
They also realized that if they truly
wanted to create a democratic society
they would have to confront the eco
nomic exploitation of capitalism that
Marx wrote about.
So in many cases they created a
centrally planned economy and with it
an illusion of a monolithic society — a
society working together for the com
mon good.
But in spite of its moral foundation,
the society relied all too often on walls
and guns to keep everyone in line. And
just as they built an illusion of unity
within each country, the Soviet Union
forced another charade of unity within
the East bloc.
These contradictions had been build
ing up for too long. When Gorbachev,
the singular figure of these times,

came to power he only made imminent
what was inevitable. His remarkable
contribution is that he had the courage
to release these ideas and forces.
GlasnoBt was going to be only the
vehicle for expressing dissatisfaction
and disillusionment of the people. It
made clear what was even more funda
mental. The socialist economy was in
stagnation compared with the West
ana could not advance. The advanced
capitalist economies were burying the
soaalists.
The people fleeing East Germany
today are not doing so for political
reasons, but primarily economic ones.
They are willing to leave their families,
jobs, houses and relative security to
venture into a new society.
Why? They see West German televi
sion and they know the apparent dif
ferences between that standard of
living and their own. But more impor
tantly they can't dream of achieving
more in their society. They are limited
as individuals. In the West the dream
is unlimited.

As the East European countries go
ahead with reforms towards a market
economy, this is no time for the West
to sit back and gloat over the
socialists' demise. In order to assure a
stable and more prosperous Europe,
the changes have to go irreversibly.
The countries of the first world need
to help make these transitions smooth.
They can assure the second world that
they po9e no military threat to them.
This can be done by a negotiated arms
reduction to a point where there can
be no military aggression. And at the
same time the Western economies can
help with not only government aid, but
private investment as well.
There are no magic bullets that will
solve the problems of Eastern Euro
pean countries. The fundamental
changes in Eastern Europe, in spite of
what they seem, are not going to
happen overnight. And they shouldn't.
Most of these countries have not had
any organized political opposition for
decades. There is no one else who can
take over the government instantly.

The Communists are going to have to
remain in power for some time. (Even
in Poland, which has an organized
political force, it is not clear if the
Solidarity government will be successful
given their lack of experience.)
To be sure, in any case ihere will be
a tumultuous period ahead. What is
really remarkable is that change is
happening on such a large scale with
out a violent conflict that is causing it.
It may be that we are finally learn
ing our lessons from history. The
larger tasks will still remain even as
these two worlds unite: How to make
the capitalist economy more democratic
and how to unite with the third world.
The hot peace, which is now emerg
ing from the cold war, is an opportune
time to forge a new Europe on the
ruins of the Iron Curtain. We can have
not only one Germany, but also one
Europe.

A SPECTRE IS HAUNTING
Eastern Europe — the spectre of
democracy. The Communist
powers of Eastern Europe are scram
bling to reform their societies so that
they can preserve order in face of this
spectre.
One hundred and forty years ago
Karl Marx wrote the "Communist
Manifesto." At that time he was still a
young man but convinced that he had
uncovered the scientific laws of human
behavior.
The year was 1848 and Marx was
anticipating the dawn of revolutions to
come in Europe and elsewhere. He
called on Communists to unite and
proclaim their common goals.
Today Communists in the "ad
vanced" socialist countries, the so
called second world, face a different
dilemma. They finally need to take a
hard and honest look at the societies
they were creating according to the
Marxist prescription.
They have to face the contradictions
of their "scientific" theory with the

harsh reality that exists in their coun
tries.
Over the past century democratic
revolutions across the world from
Europe to Latin America were inspired
by Marx's writing. Revolutionaries saw
the truth and the power of Marxism.
They also realized that if they truly
wanted to create a democratic society
they would have to confront the eco
nomic exploitation of capitalism that
Marx wrote about.
So in many cases they created a
centrally planned economy and with it
an illusion of a monolithic society — a
society working together for the com
mon good.
But in spite of its moral foundation,
the society relied all too often on walls
and guns to keep everyone in line. And
just as they built an illusion of unity
within each country, the Soviet Union
forced another charade of unity within
the East bloc.
These contradictions had been build
ing up for too long. When Gorbachev,
the singular figure of these times,

came to power he only made imminent
what was inevitable. His remarkable
contribution is that he had the courage
to release these ideas and forces.
GlasnoBt was going to be only the
vehicle for expressing dissatisfaction
and disillusionment of the people. It
made clear what was even more funda
mental. The socialist economy was in
stagnation compared with the West
ana could not advance. The advanced
capitalist economies were burying the
soaalists.
The people fleeing East Germany
today are not doing so for political
reasons, but primarily economic ones.
They are willing to leave their families,
jobs, houses and relative security to
venture into a new society.
Why? They see West German televi
sion and they know the apparent dif
ferences between that standard of
living and their own. But more impor
tantly they can't dream of achieving
more in their society. They are limited
as individuals. In the West the dream
is unlimited.

As the East European countries go
ahead with reforms towards a market
economy, this is no time for the West
to sit back and gloat over the
socialists' demise. In order to assure a
stable and more prosperous Europe,
the changes have to go irreversibly.
The countries of the first world need
to help make these transitions smooth.
They can assure the second world that
they po9e no military threat to them.
This can be done by a negotiated arms
reduction to a point where there can
be no military aggression. And at the
same time the Western economies can
help with not only government aid, but
private investment as well.
There are no magic bullets that will
solve the problems of Eastern Euro
pean countries. The fundamental
changes in Eastern Europe, in spite of
what they seem, are not going to
happen overnight. And they shouldn't.
Most of these countries have not had
any organized political opposition for
decades. There is no one else who can
take over the government instantly.

The Communists are going to have to
remain in power for some time. (Even
in Poland, which has an organized
political force, it is not clear if the
Solidarity government will be successful
given their lack of experience.)
To be sure, in any case ihere will be
a tumultuous period ahead. What is
really remarkable is that change is
happening on such a large scale with
out a violent conflict that is causing it.
It may be that we are finally learn
ing our lessons from history. The
larger tasks will still remain even as
these two worlds unite: How to make
the capitalist economy more democratic
and how to unite with the third world.
The hot peace, which is now emerg
ing from the cold war, is an opportune
time to forge a new Europe on the
ruins of the Iron Curtain. We can have
not only one Germany, but also one
Europe.
