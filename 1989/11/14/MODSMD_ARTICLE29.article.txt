## New adviser Hughes faces Stanford's fraternal affairs 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Brotherhood, scholarship and
character — for Michael Hughes,
the new fraternal affairs adviser,
these three words represent some
of the ideals fraternities were de
signed to pursue.
The words were part of the oath
of Hughes' own fraternity, Phi
Sigma Kappa, and he has taken
this oath to heart as guide to
fraternal affairs.
Hughes, who was very involved
with undergraduate fraternal life,
said he knew by his junior year
that he wanted to go into student
affairs. A UCLA graduate with a
Ph.D. in higher education,
Hughes has since gained years of
experience with student life.
For two years he served as the
UCLA Greek life area coordinator,
and prior to that, he was coordi
nator of Greek life at the Univer
sity of Tampa in Florida. Hughes,
who is only the second fraternal
affairs adviser at Stanford — the
first was Joe Pisano — has big
plans for Stanford fraternities and
sororities.
"Fraternities at Stanford are
more than glorified drinking
clubs," Hughes emphasized. He
said his perception of what a fra
ternity can and should be is a
group where individuals can dis

cuss their values, make a com
mitment to each other and society,
and learn to become strong
leaders.
According to Hughes, this
thumbnail sketch of basic frater
nal aims comes from the original
founding and purpose of fraterni
ties. The first such organizations,
he said, were originally estab
lished after the Revolutionary
War with the development of ed
ucational institutions.
University organizations at that
time were strongly regulated and

did not want students discussing
such controversial topics as, for
example, whether the colonies
should have broken away from
England. As a result, fraternities
developed to provide a forum for
these issues and grew stronger as
members discovered the sense of
community a fraternity provides.
Today, however, Hughes said
there is a negative attitude toward
fraternities on campus. People
regard them as centers for pro
moting alcohol abuse and fail to
see the philanthropic works and
other community events in which
fraternities participate, Hughes
said.
Hughes hopes to educate the
Stanford community about the
positive role fraternities play in
campus life. He said he perceives
the current situation on campus
as one where feelings of racism,
sexism and other forms of dis
crimination are not tolerated, yet
where demeaning attitudes
toward fraternities are accepted.
"I want to challenge 'Greek
ism'," Hughes explained, coining
a term to express the hostility he
often sees displayed toward mem
bers of Greek organizations.
Hughes said he feels part of
this attitude results from the com
munity's impression that frater
nities focus primarily on parties
and drinking. One of Hughes'

'There is no real role for open parties on
campus. They don't perform a function
in this institution,' Hughes said, adding
that it is still important for fraternities to
have a social outlet.

goals, therefore, is "to see the
Greek system take a leadership
role in examining" alcohol-related
problems. Hughes said such prob
lems are "much more widespread"
than just among the fraternities.
Hughes also believes this nega
tive view could be partly corrected
by restricting student attendance
at fraternity parties and by
making them "closed" to the
public. "There is no real role for
open parties on campus. They
don't perform a function in this
institution," Hughes said, adding
that it is still important for fra
ternities to have a social outlet.
Hughes believes, however, that
smaller functions such as ex
changes between fraternities and
sororities might be a better way
of socializing than having a
campus-wide fraternity party
which anyone can attend. He said
the reasoning behind this switch

is not that such a party would be
more exclusive, hut that, with a
controlled size of no more than a
couple hundred people, a smaller
party would allow organizers to
keep events under better control.
Hughes added that fraternities
still offer anyone in the commu
nity the opportunity to rush, so
in reality no one will be excluded.
Another goal Hughes is striving
for is to educate the Stanford com
munity about the lesser-known
programs of the fraternal —
sororal system. He believes this
will help students who are think
ing of rushing a fraternity or
sorority to better understand the
Greek system before they make
a commitment.
Students need to learn about
Greek philanthropy and about
workshops on pluralism, alcohol
abuse or other topics that frater
nities and sororities often spon

sor, Hughes said. Also, it is im
portant for prospective members
to consider what leadership skills
they may develop by becoming a
member of a fraternity, he added.
This will enable students to pick
a fraternity based on an educated
decision rather than on superfi
cial criteria such as which frater
nity had a good party.
Since not everyone is offered a
bid, however, the process can be
"hurtful but honest," Hughes
said. "It is my responsibility to
prepare students for rejections,
and I believe it is better (to be
rejected) than to get in and later
discover they are not really hap
py"
Hughes certainly has his work
cut out for him, and his short
time at Stanford has been hectic
and time-consuming. So far, he
seems to be the right man for the
tough job of reconciling fraterni
ties and sororities with a some
what suspicious community.
According to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, Hughes
never allows work to slip by, and
instead actively participates in the
Stanford community. "He's out
where the (fraternity) members
are, not sitting behind a desk,"
Lyons said. "I think Michael
Hughes is a powerful advocate for
fraternities and sororities, and he
has a great sense of fairness."

'There is no real role for open parties on
campus. They don't perform a function
in this institution,' Hughes said, adding
that it is still important for fraternities to
have a social outlet.

goals, therefore, is "to see the
Greek system take a leadership
role in examining" alcohol-related
problems. Hughes said such prob

Hughes also believes this nega
tive view could be partly corrected
by restricting student attendance
at fraternity parties and by
making them "closed" to the
public. "There is no real role for

don't perform a function in this
institution," Hughes said, adding
that it is still important for fra
ternities to have a social outlet.
Hughes believes, however, that
smaller functions such as ex
changes between fraternities and
sororities might be a better way
of socializing than having a
campus-wide fraternity party
which anyone can attend. He said
the reasoning behind this switch

is not that such a party would be
more exclusive, hut that, with a
controlled size of no more than a
couple hundred people, a smaller
party would allow organizers to
keep events under better control.
Hughes added that fraternities
still offer anyone in the commu
nity the opportunity to rush, so
in reality no one will be excluded.
Another goal Hughes is striving
for is to educate the Stanford com
munity about the lesser-known
programs of the fraternal —
sororal system. He believes this
will help students who are think
ing of rushing a fraternity or
sorority to better understand the
Greek system before they make
a commitment.
Students need to learn about
Greek philanthropy and about
workshops on pluralism, alcohol
abuse or other topics that frater
nities and sororities often spon

sor, Hughes said. Also, it is im
portant for prospective members
to consider what leadership skills
they may develop by becoming a
member of a fraternity, he added.
This will enable students to pick
a fraternity based on an educated
decision rather than on superfi
cial criteria such as which frater
nity had a good party.
Since not everyone is offered a
bid, however, the process can be
"hurtful but honest," Hughes
said. "It is my responsibility to
prepare students for rejections,
and I believe it is better (to be
rejected) than to get in and later
discover they are not really hap
py"
Hughes certainly has his work
cut out for him, and his short
time at Stanford has been hectic
and time-consuming. So far, he
seems to be the right man for the
tough job of reconciling fraterni
ties and sororities with a some
what suspicious community.
According to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, Hughes
never allows work to slip by, and
instead actively participates in the
Stanford community. "He's out
where the (fraternity) members
are, not sitting behind a desk,"
Lyons said. "I think Michael
Hughes is a powerful advocate for
fraternities and sororities, and he
has a great sense of fairness."

Brotherhood, scholarship and
character — for Michael Hughes,
the new fraternal affairs adviser,
these three words represent some
of the ideals fraternities were de
signed to pursue.
The words were part of the oath
of Hughes' own fraternity, Phi
Sigma Kappa, and he has taken
this oath to heart as guide to
fraternal affairs.
Hughes, who was very involved
with undergraduate fraternal life,
said he knew by his junior year
that he wanted to go into student
affairs. A UCLA graduate with a
Ph.D. in higher education,
Hughes has since gained years of
experience with student life.
For two years he served as the
UCLA Greek life area coordinator,
and prior to that, he was coordi
nator of Greek life at the Univer
sity of Tampa in Florida. Hughes,
who is only the second fraternal
affairs adviser at Stanford — the
first was Joe Pisano — has big
plans for Stanford fraternities and
sororities.
"Fraternities at Stanford are
more than glorified drinking
clubs," Hughes emphasized. He
said his perception of what a fra
ternity can and should be is a
group where individuals can dis

cuss their values, make a com
mitment to each other and society,
and learn to become strong
leaders.
According to Hughes, this
thumbnail sketch of basic frater
nal aims comes from the original
founding and purpose of fraterni
ties. The first such organizations,
he said, were originally estab
lished after the Revolutionary
War with the development of ed
ucational institutions.
University organizations at that
time were strongly regulated and

did not want students discussing
such controversial topics as, for
example, whether the colonies
should have broken away from
England. As a result, fraternities
developed to provide a forum for
these issues and grew stronger as
members discovered the sense of
community a fraternity provides.
Today, however, Hughes said
there is a negative attitude toward
fraternities on campus. People
regard them as centers for pro
moting alcohol abuse and fail to
see the philanthropic works and
other community events in which
fraternities participate, Hughes
said.
Hughes hopes to educate the
Stanford community about the
positive role fraternities play in
campus life. He said he perceives
the current situation on campus
as one where feelings of racism,
sexism and other forms of dis
crimination are not tolerated, yet
where demeaning attitudes
toward fraternities are accepted.
"I want to challenge 'Greek
ism'," Hughes explained, coining
a term to express the hostility he
often sees displayed toward mem
bers of Greek organizations.
Hughes said he feels part of
this attitude results from the com
munity's impression that frater
nities focus primarily on parties
and drinking. One of Hughes'
