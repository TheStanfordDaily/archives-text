# Chinese at Stanford continue fight for democracy from afar
## 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first ar
ticle in a four-part series on the
Chinese student movement at
Stanford. Several of those inter
viewed withheld their names
because of concern for family
members remaining in China.

The silence of the June 6 vigil
in White Plaza for the victims of
the massacre in Tiananmen
Square was eloquent. Better than
any words, it expressed the depth
of disappointment among Chinese
students who had just watched on
television as soldiers systemati
cally shot crowds of unarmed
workers and students on the
streeets of Beijing.
As the death toll mounted into

the thousands, Chinese students
at Stanford threw themselves into
the effort to stop the ongoing kil
ling in China. Within days they
collected hundreds of signatures

on petitions, sent letters to George
Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev, the
United Nations and the Red
Cross, and lobbied for economic
sanctions against China.
At the time, concerns for their
own personal safety were far from
the students' minds. Graduate
student Dai Jiangang says his par
ticipation "was very natural at

that point. It was only a couple
of months later that I began to
feel afraid."
However, the activism did not
start with the vigil. The road that
led Dai and others to outspoken
political involvement began well
before the firing in Tiananmen
Square.
When it was founded several
years ago, the Association of Chi
nese Students and Scholars at
Stanford was a recreational and
social group, funded largely by
contributions from the Chinese
consulate in San Francisco.
All students coming from main
land China automatically became
members of the group, which
aimed to help them adjust to life
in America and to bring students
together for volleyball, movies and
dances — a task complicated by

the difficulty of luring them away
from their studies and research.
Most of the Chinese students
at Stanford in the hard sci
ences, engineering and medicine,
as do most of the 40,000 Chinese
students elsewhere in the United
States. Like other foreign gradu
ate students, men make up the
overwhelming majority of the Chi
nese students at Stanford.
In March 1989, there were
about 385 mainland nationals at
Stanford, including 182 students,
71 visiting scholars and about 120
family members. Since March,
few, if any, have returned home
permanently.
Before the protests began in
Beijing, the Chinese community
at Stanford was supportive of the
government's reform efforts. A
group of about 20 students held

bi-weekly discussion forums
about prospects for economic and
political reform in China. Coming
out against the government was
the farthest thing from the stu
dents' minds.
Support for reforms
Looking back on the discussion
groups, one participant says,
"They weren't anti-government
because the government itself was
reforming. We were just suggest
ing how to go about the reforms."
On several occasions Stanford
students submitted respectful ob
jections to changes in government
policy — opposing a proposed
tightening of requirements for
students studying abroad and the
removal of Hu Yaobang from his
post as General Secretary of the

Chinese Communist Party, and
supporting the appeal of Fang
Lizhi, a prominent critic of the
government, for the release of po
litical prisoners.
But, according to Zhou, stu
dents took great pains to present
their objections in "a way the
leaders would find acceptable."
In 1985, however, students were
reminded that even gentle oppo
sition might not be acceptable to
some leaders. Li Peng, then Vice
Premier of China, visited Stan
ford. One student remembers him
speaking in authoritarian tones
when questioned on government
pel icy and challenging the right
of the students to question him.
Another student recalls Li telling
the Chinese students that he

"firmly believed they would
return home and not betray their
country by staying in the United
States."
'Official garbage'
The most vivid image Li left
was the absurdity of his telling
Silicon Valley entrepreneurs that
they ought to consider central
planning. One graduate student
calls Li's speech "official garbage
showing no intelligence at all. You
could close your eyes, pick up any
person in China, and find more
intelligence than Li Peng has."
In 1988 Stanford students
looked on with deep misgivings as
Li Peng became premier. "We
knew it was the end of reform,"
said graduate student "Han Zi."
Following the death of the
deposed reformist Hu Yaobang
April 15, students in Beijing and
elsewhere in China seized the op
portunity to take their own con
cerns to the streets. They
protested official corruption and
nepotism and rallied in favor of
an independent student union.
And as the demonstrations went
on, the students broadened their
demands to include reconsidera
tion of the official condemnation
of their movement and an end to
censorship of press coverage.
Students embarked on the first
of what were to become many long
nights of monitoring the news
coming from China, but it took
the hunger strikes in Tiananmen
Square to galvanize them into ac
tion. Within the Chinese commu
nity, four students had siblings
among the hunger strikers. Sud
denly, what had been an interest
for many became a commitment
for some.
Han became involved in the
wake of the hunger strikes. "I
didn't care about my research or
anything. The students at Tianan
men were willing to risk their
lives," he says. "Here, we did
whatever we could to help. Money,
time, brains — anything we could
contribute we did."
For one student whose brother
was a hunger striker, calling
Beijing became as regular as
making a local call. He says,"I
spent close to $600 on phone bills
in May, but when you are talking
about life and death who cares
about money?"
No cooperation

laration of martial law May 19
spurred Stanford students to take
their most dramatic step up to
that point. On May 20 12 graduate
students wrote a declaration of
non-recognition and non
cooperation toward the Li regime.
The declaration was circulated
through China Net, a national
computer bulletin board used by
Chinese students to communicate
between universities. It garnered
support from more than 90 other
universities.
Under the leadership of the
board of directors of the Associ
ation of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford, the students
quickly organized to address the
most pressing needs of the de
mocracy movement — money and
information.
They began a major fundraising
effort that would raise tens of
thousands of dollars by the time
of the June massacre. Even before
the massacre, money had already
been sent to the demonstrators,
along with tents and garbage bags
for the students living in the
square.
Stanford students channeled
news of the demonstrations be
tween China and the United
States. According to Lu Mei, who
worked with the association's in
formation center, "After martial
law, the Chinese newspapers
blocked everything so it was hard
for people in China and the
United States to know what was
really going on. We called relatives
and friends in Beijing, and then
called people in other provinces
to tell them what was happening
in Beijing."
Hope and dismay
Almost all the students recall
these days as "very emotional,"
characterized by an intense feeling
of potential. Until the last mo
ment, students in the United
States pinned their hopes for the
creation of a new China on the
demrrrraey movement and
J watched in horror as t he two|£uitt£i

moved closer and closer to con
frontation.
The first pictures that started
coming out of China the afternoon
of June 3 marked the end of the
euphoria, but not the student
movement, in the United States.
For many, the massacre rein
forced their commitment to the
movement. Xu Sike, president of
the association, traces his own
commitment to that day.
"So many young people died. I
knew I must do something for
the people of my country — if I
don't do anything my hurt will
never get better," he says.
Over the following week reports
out of China spoke of continuing
random killings in Beijing and
elsewhere. Stanford students be
came increasingly vocal as they
searched for leverage to end the
killings. Delegations of students
lobbied members of Congress for
limited economic sanctions
against China.
The association collected more
than a thousand signatures on a
petition circulated in White Plaza
and wrote letters appealing to
world leaders and international
organizations to use their influ
ence to stop the killings.
Meanwhile, Chinese students
continued gathering funds and in
formation. On the Friday after
the massacre, the students estab
lished the June Fourth Founda
tion, a non-profit institution
dedicated to aiding victims of the
massacre and subsequent perse
cution and to supporting pro
democracy educational efforts in
the United States.
Helping the victims
Although the June Fourth
Foundation has had to find new
channels for getting money into
China, Douglas Pan, president of
the foundation, stresses that
throughout the summer and fall
the foundation has continued to
send money to the victims
through "secure and legal chan
nels." He noted that "while the
government may not like what we
are doing, it's not illegal to give
money to a Chinese citizen."
However, the effort to phone
news to China ended within days
after the massacre. "We would call
and people would become silent,"
said graduate student Lu Mei. "We
knew the government was tapping
the phones." Fearing their calls
might endanger people still in
China, the association's informa
tion center staff began tending
and letters with

photocopies of news clippings in
stead.
As news of the persecution of
dissidents in China reached the
United States, Chinese students
here began to fear for their own
safety. Approximately 90 percent
of the Chinese students at Stan
ford are on J-l visas, which stip
ulate that the bearer must return
to his or her home country for
two years after finishing a degree.
While the Bush administration
moved to extend Chinese stu
dents' J-l visas until 1990, few
students at Stanford took the op
tion. Bechtel International Center
director John Pearson calls the
executive decision "a terrible
thing to do. The students are safe
until next summer and then they
are forced to go back."
Instead, Stanford students
began lobbying in support of a
bill introduced by Hep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., which would lift
the two-year return requirement.
Although the bill passed in both
the House and the Senate, stu
dents are still

they may be forced to return
home. "If I go home, I will be
arrested," says Xu.
Settling in for the long haul
The summer was a time of a
transition for the student move
ment in the United States. Al
though the massacre and
continuing efforts to rescue dissi
dents remained on everyone's
minds, the movement had to adapt
to the fact that it was no longer
an adjunct to the movement
within in China.
And the timetables of democra
tization had been lengthened from
weeks and months to years. As
graduate student Bao Yichin
points out, "In the short term,
there is no chance of forming an
other democratic movement
within China. The overseas or
ganizations must preserve the
momentum over the next couple
years."
After some initial hesitations
and missteps, Chinese students
,have developed a national and iiv

ture for protecting students and
furthering the democracy move
ment. The result is, in the words
of Lu, "a quieter movement, but
one in which there is still a lot
of work to do."
Work continues at the office of
the Association of Chinese Stu
dents and Scholars at Stanford,
but there is a sense of limitation.
According to Pan, "There is very
little we can do except send money
and letters."
Although most members agree
that the association has the mo
mentum to carry on political ac
tivism, there is some uncertainty
about the next step to take.
"Frankly, we don't know what to
do next," one member says.
Much of the association's cur
rent work centers on establishing
and maintaining new organiza
tions set up for the long term, a
movement in which a number of
Stanford students play central
roles. Says graduate student Liu
Yongchuan, "Although we think
it will take years, at this moment
there is a consensus that we will
not drop from our goals." J

laration of martial law May 19
spurred Stanford students to take
their most dramatic step up to
that point. On May 20 12 graduate
students wrote a declaration of
non-recognition and non
cooperation toward the Li regime.
The declaration was circulated
through China Net, a national
computer bulletin board used by
Chinese students to communicate
between universities. It garnered
support from more than 90 other
universities.
Under the leadership of the
board of directors of the Associ
ation of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford, the students
quickly organized to address the
most pressing needs of the de
mocracy movement — money and
information.
They began a major fundraising
effort that would raise tens of
thousands of dollars by the time
of the June massacre. Even before
the massacre, money had already
been sent to the demonstrators,
along with tents and garbage bags
for the students living in the
square.
Stanford students channeled
news of the demonstrations be
tween China and the United
States. According to Lu Mei, who
worked with the association's in
formation center, "After martial
law, the Chinese newspapers
blocked everything so it was hard
for people in China and the
United States to know what was
really going on. We called relatives
and friends in Beijing, and then
called people in other provinces
to tell them what was happening
in Beijing."
Hope and dismay
Almost all the students recall
these days as "very emotional,"
characterized by an intense feeling
of potential. Until the last mo
ment, students in the United
States pinned their hopes for the
creation of a new China on the
demrrrraey movement and
J watched in horror as t he two|£uitt£i

moved closer and closer to con
frontation.
The first pictures that started
coming out of China the afternoon
of June 3 marked the end of the
euphoria, but not the student
movement, in the United States.
For many, the massacre rein
forced their commitment to the
movement. Xu Sike, president of
the association, traces his own
commitment to that day.
"So many young people died. I
knew I must do something for
the people of my country — if I
don't do anything my hurt will
never get better," he says.
Over the following week reports
out of China spoke of continuing
random killings in Beijing and
elsewhere. Stanford students be
came increasingly vocal as they
searched for leverage to end the
killings. Delegations of students
lobbied members of Congress for
limited economic sanctions
against China.
The association collected more
than a thousand signatures on a
petition circulated in White Plaza
and wrote letters appealing to
world leaders and international
organizations to use their influ
ence to stop the killings.
Meanwhile, Chinese students
continued gathering funds and in
formation. On the Friday after
the massacre, the students estab
lished the June Fourth Founda
tion, a non-profit institution
dedicated to aiding victims of the
massacre and subsequent perse
cution and to supporting pro
democracy educational efforts in
the United States.
Helping the victims
Although the June Fourth
Foundation has had to find new
channels for getting money into
China, Douglas Pan, president of
the foundation, stresses that
throughout the summer and fall
the foundation has continued to
send money to the victims
through "secure and legal chan
nels." He noted that "while the
government may not like what we
are doing, it's not illegal to give
money to a Chinese citizen."
However, the effort to phone
news to China ended within days
after the massacre. "We would call
and people would become silent,"
said graduate student Lu Mei. "We
knew the government was tapping
the phones." Fearing their calls
might endanger people still in
China, the association's informa
tion center staff began tending
and letters with

photocopies of news clippings in
stead.
As news of the persecution of
dissidents in China reached the
United States, Chinese students
here began to fear for their own
safety. Approximately 90 percent
of the Chinese students at Stan
ford are on J-l visas, which stip
ulate that the bearer must return
to his or her home country for
two years after finishing a degree.
While the Bush administration
moved to extend Chinese stu
dents' J-l visas until 1990, few
students at Stanford took the op
tion. Bechtel International Center
director John Pearson calls the
executive decision "a terrible
thing to do. The students are safe
until next summer and then they
are forced to go back."
Instead, Stanford students
began lobbying in support of a
bill introduced by Hep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., which would lift
the two-year return requirement.
Although the bill passed in both
the House and the Senate, stu
dents are still

they may be forced to return
home. "If I go home, I will be
arrested," says Xu.
Settling in for the long haul
The summer was a time of a
transition for the student move
ment in the United States. Al
though the massacre and
continuing efforts to rescue dissi
dents remained on everyone's
minds, the movement had to adapt
to the fact that it was no longer
an adjunct to the movement
within in China.
And the timetables of democra
tization had been lengthened from
weeks and months to years. As
graduate student Bao Yichin
points out, "In the short term,
there is no chance of forming an
other democratic movement
within China. The overseas or
ganizations must preserve the
momentum over the next couple
years."
After some initial hesitations
and missteps, Chinese students
,have developed a national and iiv

ture for protecting students and
furthering the democracy move
ment. The result is, in the words
of Lu, "a quieter movement, but
one in which there is still a lot
of work to do."
Work continues at the office of
the Association of Chinese Stu
dents and Scholars at Stanford,
but there is a sense of limitation.
According to Pan, "There is very
little we can do except send money
and letters."
Although most members agree
that the association has the mo
mentum to carry on political ac
tivism, there is some uncertainty
about the next step to take.
"Frankly, we don't know what to
do next," one member says.
Much of the association's cur
rent work centers on establishing
and maintaining new organiza
tions set up for the long term, a
movement in which a number of
Stanford students play central
roles. Says graduate student Liu
Yongchuan, "Although we think
it will take years, at this moment
there is a consensus that we will
not drop from our goals." J


Michael Topolovac. — Daily file
Chinese students expressed their disappointment in the government of their homeland at a vigil here
last June commemorating the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Since then, the students
have continued to press for reforms in China.
Editor's note: This is the first ar
ticle in a four-part series on the
Chinese student movement at
Stanford. Several of those inter
viewed withheld their names
because of concern for family
members remaining in China.

The silence of the June 6 vigil
in White Plaza for the victims of
the massacre in Tiananmen
Square was eloquent. Better than
any words, it expressed the depth
of disappointment among Chinese
students who had just watched on
television as soldiers systemati
cally shot crowds of unarmed
workers and students on the
streeets of Beijing.
As the death toll mounted into

the thousands, Chinese students
at Stanford threw themselves into
the effort to stop the ongoing kil
ling in China. Within days they
collected hundreds of signatures

on petitions, sent letters to George
Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev, the
United Nations and the Red
Cross, and lobbied for economic
sanctions against China.
At the time, concerns for their
own personal safety were far from
the students' minds. Graduate
student Dai Jiangang says his par
ticipation "was very natural at

that point. It was only a couple
of months later that I began to
feel afraid."
However, the activism did not
start with the vigil. The road that
led Dai and others to outspoken
political involvement began well
before the firing in Tiananmen
Square.
When it was founded several
years ago, the Association of Chi
nese Students and Scholars at
Stanford was a recreational and
social group, funded largely by
contributions from the Chinese
consulate in San Francisco.
All students coming from main
land China automatically became
members of the group, which
aimed to help them adjust to life
in America and to bring students
together for volleyball, movies and
dances — a task complicated by

the difficulty of luring them away
from their studies and research.
Most of the Chinese students
at Stanford in the hard sci
ences, engineering and medicine,
as do most of the 40,000 Chinese
students elsewhere in the United
States. Like other foreign gradu
ate students, men make up the
overwhelming majority of the Chi
nese students at Stanford.
In March 1989, there were
about 385 mainland nationals at
Stanford, including 182 students,
71 visiting scholars and about 120
family members. Since March,
few, if any, have returned home
permanently.
Before the protests began in
Beijing, the Chinese community
at Stanford was supportive of the
government's reform efforts. A
group of about 20 students held

bi-weekly discussion forums
about prospects for economic and
political reform in China. Coming
out against the government was
the farthest thing from the stu
dents' minds.
Support for reforms
Looking back on the discussion
groups, one participant says,
"They weren't anti-government
because the government itself was
reforming. We were just suggest
ing how to go about the reforms."
On several occasions Stanford
students submitted respectful ob
jections to changes in government
policy — opposing a proposed
tightening of requirements for
students studying abroad and the
removal of Hu Yaobang from his
post as General Secretary of the

Chinese Communist Party, and
supporting the appeal of Fang
Lizhi, a prominent critic of the
government, for the release of po
litical prisoners.
But, according to Zhou, stu
dents took great pains to present
their objections in "a way the
leaders would find acceptable."
In 1985, however, students were
reminded that even gentle oppo
sition might not be acceptable to
some leaders. Li Peng, then Vice
Premier of China, visited Stan
ford. One student remembers him
speaking in authoritarian tones
when questioned on government
pel icy and challenging the right
of the students to question him.
Another student recalls Li telling
the Chinese students that he

"firmly believed they would
return home and not betray their
country by staying in the United
States."
'Official garbage'
The most vivid image Li left
was the absurdity of his telling
Silicon Valley entrepreneurs that
they ought to consider central
planning. One graduate student
calls Li's speech "official garbage
showing no intelligence at all. You
could close your eyes, pick up any
person in China, and find more
intelligence than Li Peng has."
In 1988 Stanford students
looked on with deep misgivings as
Li Peng became premier. "We
knew it was the end of reform,"
said graduate student "Han Zi."
Following the death of the
deposed reformist Hu Yaobang
April 15, students in Beijing and
elsewhere in China seized the op
portunity to take their own con
cerns to the streets. They
protested official corruption and
nepotism and rallied in favor of
an independent student union.
And as the demonstrations went
on, the students broadened their
demands to include reconsidera
tion of the official condemnation
of their movement and an end to
censorship of press coverage.
Students embarked on the first
of what were to become many long
nights of monitoring the news
coming from China, but it took
the hunger strikes in Tiananmen
Square to galvanize them into ac
tion. Within the Chinese commu
nity, four students had siblings
among the hunger strikers. Sud
denly, what had been an interest
for many became a commitment
for some.
Han became involved in the
wake of the hunger strikes. "I
didn't care about my research or
anything. The students at Tianan
men were willing to risk their
lives," he says. "Here, we did
whatever we could to help. Money,
time, brains — anything we could
contribute we did."
For one student whose brother
was a hunger striker, calling
Beijing became as regular as
making a local call. He says,"I
spent close to $600 on phone bills
in May, but when you are talking
about life and death who cares
about money?"

After some initial hesitations

of Lu, "a quieter movement, but
one in which there is still a lot
of work to do."
Work continues at the office of
the Association of Chinese Stu

but there is a sense of limitation.
According to Pan, "There is very
little we can do except send money

Although most members agree
that the association has the mo

about the next step to take.

Michael Topolovac. — Daily file
Chinese students expressed their disappointment in the government of their homeland at a vigil here
last June commemorating the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Since then, the students
have continued to press for reforms in China.
Editor's note: This is the first ar
ticle in a four-part series on the
Chinese student movement at
Stanford. Several of those inter
viewed withheld their names
because of concern for family
members remaining in China.

The silence of the June 6 vigil
in White Plaza for the victims of
the massacre in Tiananmen
Square was eloquent. Better than
any words, it expressed the depth
of disappointment among Chinese
students who had just watched on
television as soldiers systemati
cally shot crowds of unarmed
workers and students on the
streeets of Beijing.
As the death toll mounted into

the thousands, Chinese students
at Stanford threw themselves into
the effort to stop the ongoing kil
ling in China. Within days they
collected hundreds of signatures

on petitions, sent letters to George
Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev, the
United Nations and the Red
Cross, and lobbied for economic
sanctions against China.
At the time, concerns for their
own personal safety were far from
the students' minds. Graduate
student Dai Jiangang says his par
ticipation "was very natural at

that point. It was only a couple
of months later that I began to
feel afraid."
However, the activism did not
start with the vigil. The road that
led Dai and others to outspoken
political involvement began well
before the firing in Tiananmen
Square.
When it was founded several
years ago, the Association of Chi
nese Students and Scholars at
Stanford was a recreational and
social group, funded largely by
contributions from the Chinese
consulate in San Francisco.
All students coming from main
land China automatically became
members of the group, which
aimed to help them adjust to life
in America and to bring students
together for volleyball, movies and
dances — a task complicated by

the difficulty of luring them away
from their studies and research.
Most of the Chinese students
at Stanford in the hard sci
ences, engineering and medicine,
as do most of the 40,000 Chinese
students elsewhere in the United
States. Like other foreign gradu
ate students, men make up the
overwhelming majority of the Chi
nese students at Stanford.
In March 1989, there were
about 385 mainland nationals at
Stanford, including 182 students,
71 visiting scholars and about 120
family members. Since March,
few, if any, have returned home
permanently.
Before the protests began in
Beijing, the Chinese community
at Stanford was supportive of the
government's reform efforts. A
group of about 20 students held

bi-weekly discussion forums
about prospects for economic and
political reform in China. Coming
out against the government was
the farthest thing from the stu
dents' minds.
Support for reforms
Looking back on the discussion
groups, one participant says,
"They weren't anti-government
because the government itself was
reforming. We were just suggest
ing how to go about the reforms."
On several occasions Stanford
students submitted respectful ob
jections to changes in government
policy — opposing a proposed
tightening of requirements for
students studying abroad and the
removal of Hu Yaobang from his
post as General Secretary of the

Chinese Communist Party, and
supporting the appeal of Fang
Lizhi, a prominent critic of the
government, for the release of po
litical prisoners.
But, according to Zhou, stu
dents took great pains to present
their objections in "a way the
leaders would find acceptable."
In 1985, however, students were
reminded that even gentle oppo
sition might not be acceptable to
some leaders. Li Peng, then Vice
Premier of China, visited Stan
ford. One student remembers him
speaking in authoritarian tones
when questioned on government
pel icy and challenging the right
of the students to question him.
Another student recalls Li telling
the Chinese students that he

"firmly believed they would
return home and not betray their
country by staying in the United
States."
'Official garbage'
The most vivid image Li left
was the absurdity of his telling
Silicon Valley entrepreneurs that
they ought to consider central
planning. One graduate student
calls Li's speech "official garbage
showing no intelligence at all. You
could close your eyes, pick up any
person in China, and find more
intelligence than Li Peng has."
In 1988 Stanford students
looked on with deep misgivings as
Li Peng became premier. "We
knew it was the end of reform,"
said graduate student "Han Zi."
Following the death of the
deposed reformist Hu Yaobang
April 15, students in Beijing and
elsewhere in China seized the op
portunity to take their own con
cerns to the streets. They
protested official corruption and
nepotism and rallied in favor of
an independent student union.
And as the demonstrations went
on, the students broadened their
demands to include reconsidera
tion of the official condemnation
of their movement and an end to
censorship of press coverage.
Students embarked on the first
of what were to become many long
nights of monitoring the news
coming from China, but it took
the hunger strikes in Tiananmen
Square to galvanize them into ac
tion. Within the Chinese commu
nity, four students had siblings
among the hunger strikers. Sud
denly, what had been an interest
for many became a commitment
for some.
Han became involved in the
wake of the hunger strikes. "I
didn't care about my research or
anything. The students at Tianan
men were willing to risk their
lives," he says. "Here, we did
whatever we could to help. Money,
time, brains — anything we could
contribute we did."
For one student whose brother
was a hunger striker, calling
Beijing became as regular as
making a local call. He says,"I
spent close to $600 on phone bills
in May, but when you are talking
about life and death who cares
about money?"
No cooperation

laration of martial law May 19
spurred Stanford students to take
their most dramatic step up to
that point. On May 20 12 graduate
students wrote a declaration of
non-recognition and non
cooperation toward the Li regime.
The declaration was circulated
through China Net, a national
computer bulletin board used by
Chinese students to communicate
between universities. It garnered
support from more than 90 other
universities.
Under the leadership of the
board of directors of the Associ
ation of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford, the students
quickly organized to address the
most pressing needs of the de
mocracy movement — money and
information.
They began a major fundraising
effort that would raise tens of
thousands of dollars by the time
of the June massacre. Even before
the massacre, money had already
been sent to the demonstrators,
along with tents and garbage bags
for the students living in the
square.
Stanford students channeled
news of the demonstrations be
tween China and the United
States. According to Lu Mei, who
worked with the association's in
formation center, "After martial
law, the Chinese newspapers
blocked everything so it was hard
for people in China and the
United States to know what was
really going on. We called relatives
and friends in Beijing, and then
called people in other provinces
to tell them what was happening
in Beijing."
Hope and dismay
Almost all the students recall
these days as "very emotional,"
characterized by an intense feeling
of potential. Until the last mo
ment, students in the United
States pinned their hopes for the
creation of a new China on the
demrrrraey movement and
J watched in horror as t he two|£uitt£i

moved closer and closer to con
frontation.
The first pictures that started
coming out of China the afternoon
of June 3 marked the end of the
euphoria, but not the student
movement, in the United States.
For many, the massacre rein
forced their commitment to the
movement. Xu Sike, president of
the association, traces his own
commitment to that day.
"So many young people died. I
knew I must do something for
the people of my country — if I
don't do anything my hurt will
never get better," he says.
Over the following week reports
out of China spoke of continuing
random killings in Beijing and
elsewhere. Stanford students be
came increasingly vocal as they
searched for leverage to end the
killings. Delegations of students
lobbied members of Congress for
limited economic sanctions
against China.
The association collected more
than a thousand signatures on a
petition circulated in White Plaza
and wrote letters appealing to
world leaders and international
organizations to use their influ
ence to stop the killings.
Meanwhile, Chinese students
continued gathering funds and in
formation. On the Friday after
the massacre, the students estab
lished the June Fourth Founda
tion, a non-profit institution
dedicated to aiding victims of the
massacre and subsequent perse
cution and to supporting pro
democracy educational efforts in
the United States.
Helping the victims
Although the June Fourth
Foundation has had to find new
channels for getting money into
China, Douglas Pan, president of
the foundation, stresses that
throughout the summer and fall
the foundation has continued to
send money to the victims
through "secure and legal chan
nels." He noted that "while the
government may not like what we
are doing, it's not illegal to give
money to a Chinese citizen."
However, the effort to phone
news to China ended within days
after the massacre. "We would call
and people would become silent,"
said graduate student Lu Mei. "We
knew the government was tapping
the phones." Fearing their calls
might endanger people still in
China, the association's informa
tion center staff began tending
and letters with

photocopies of news clippings in
stead.
As news of the persecution of
dissidents in China reached the
United States, Chinese students
here began to fear for their own
safety. Approximately 90 percent
of the Chinese students at Stan
ford are on J-l visas, which stip
ulate that the bearer must return
to his or her home country for
two years after finishing a degree.
While the Bush administration
moved to extend Chinese stu
dents' J-l visas until 1990, few
students at Stanford took the op
tion. Bechtel International Center
director John Pearson calls the
executive decision "a terrible
thing to do. The students are safe
until next summer and then they
are forced to go back."
Instead, Stanford students
began lobbying in support of a
bill introduced by Hep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., which would lift
the two-year return requirement.
Although the bill passed in both
the House and the Senate, stu
dents are still

they may be forced to return
home. "If I go home, I will be
arrested," says Xu.
Settling in for the long haul
The summer was a time of a
transition for the student move
ment in the United States. Al
though the massacre and
continuing efforts to rescue dissi
dents remained on everyone's
minds, the movement had to adapt
to the fact that it was no longer
an adjunct to the movement
within in China.
And the timetables of democra
tization had been lengthened from
weeks and months to years. As
graduate student Bao Yichin
points out, "In the short term,
there is no chance of forming an
other democratic movement
within China. The overseas or
ganizations must preserve the
momentum over the next couple
years."
After some initial hesitations
and missteps, Chinese students
,have developed a national and iiv

knew it was the end of reform,"
said graduate student "Han Zi."
Following the death of the
deposed reformist Hu Yaobang
April 15, students in Beijing and
elsewhere in China seized the op
portunity to take their own con
cerns to the streets. They
protested official corruption and
nepotism and rallied in favor of
an independent student union.
And as the demonstrations went
on, the students broadened their
demands to include reconsidera
tion of the official condemnation
of their movement and an end to
censorship of press coverage.
Students embarked on the first
of what were to become many long
nights of monitoring the news
coming from China, but it took
the hunger strikes in Tiananmen
Square to galvanize them into ac
tion. Within the Chinese commu
nity, four students had siblings
among the hunger strikers. Sud
denly, what had been an interest
for many became a commitment
for some.
Han became involved in the
wake of the hunger strikes. "I
didn't care about my research or
anything. The students at Tianan
men were willing to risk their
lives," he says. "Here, we did
whatever we could to help. Money,
time, brains — anything we could
contribute we did."
For one student whose brother
was a hunger striker, calling
Beijing became as regular as
making a local call. He says,"I
spent close to $600 on phone bills
in May, but when you are talking
about life and death who cares
about money?"
No cooperation

laration of martial law May 19
spurred Stanford students to take
their most dramatic step up to
that point. On May 20 12 graduate
students wrote a declaration of
non-recognition and non
cooperation toward the Li regime.
The declaration was circulated
through China Net, a national
computer bulletin board used by
Chinese students to communicate
between universities. It garnered
support from more than 90 other
universities.
Under the leadership of the
board of directors of the Associ
ation of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford, the students
quickly organized to address the
most pressing needs of the de
mocracy movement — money and
information.
They began a major fundraising
effort that would raise tens of
thousands of dollars by the time
of the June massacre. Even before
the massacre, money had already
been sent to the demonstrators,
along with tents and garbage bags
for the students living in the
square.
Stanford students channeled
news of the demonstrations be
tween China and the United
States. According to Lu Mei, who
worked with the association's in
formation center, "After martial
law, the Chinese newspapers
blocked everything so it was hard
for people in China and the
United States to know what was
really going on. We called relatives
and friends in Beijing, and then
called people in other provinces
to tell them what was happening
in Beijing."
Hope and dismay
Almost all the students recall
these days as "very emotional,"
characterized by an intense feeling
of potential. Until the last mo
ment, students in the United
States pinned their hopes for the
creation of a new China on the
demrrrraey movement and
J watched in horror as t he two|£uitt£i

moved closer and closer to con
frontation.
The first pictures that started
coming out of China the afternoon
of June 3 marked the end of the
euphoria, but not the student
movement, in the United States.
For many, the massacre rein
forced their commitment to the
movement. Xu Sike, president of
the association, traces his own
commitment to that day.
"So many young people died. I
knew I must do something for
the people of my country — if I
don't do anything my hurt will
never get better," he says.
Over the following week reports
out of China spoke of continuing
random killings in Beijing and
elsewhere. Stanford students be
came increasingly vocal as they
searched for leverage to end the
killings. Delegations of students
lobbied members of Congress for
limited economic sanctions
against China.
The association collected more
than a thousand signatures on a
petition circulated in White Plaza
and wrote letters appealing to
world leaders and international
organizations to use their influ
ence to stop the killings.
Meanwhile, Chinese students
continued gathering funds and in
formation. On the Friday after
the massacre, the students estab
lished the June Fourth Founda
tion, a non-profit institution
dedicated to aiding victims of the
massacre and subsequent perse
cution and to supporting pro
democracy educational efforts in
the United States.
Helping the victims
Although the June Fourth
Foundation has had to find new
channels for getting money into
China, Douglas Pan, president of
the foundation, stresses that
throughout the summer and fall
the foundation has continued to
send money to the victims
through "secure and legal chan
nels." He noted that "while the
government may not like what we
are doing, it's not illegal to give
money to a Chinese citizen."
However, the effort to phone
news to China ended within days
after the massacre. "We would call
and people would become silent,"
said graduate student Lu Mei. "We
knew the government was tapping
the phones." Fearing their calls
might endanger people still in
China, the association's informa
tion center staff began tending
and letters with

photocopies of news clippings in
stead.
As news of the persecution of
dissidents in China reached the
United States, Chinese students
here began to fear for their own
safety. Approximately 90 percent
of the Chinese students at Stan
ford are on J-l visas, which stip
ulate that the bearer must return
to his or her home country for
two years after finishing a degree.
While the Bush administration
moved to extend Chinese stu
dents' J-l visas until 1990, few
students at Stanford took the op
tion. Bechtel International Center
director John Pearson calls the
executive decision "a terrible
thing to do. The students are safe
until next summer and then they
are forced to go back."
Instead, Stanford students
began lobbying in support of a
bill introduced by Hep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., which would lift
the two-year return requirement.
Although the bill passed in both
the House and the Senate, stu
dents are still

they may be forced to return
home. "If I go home, I will be
arrested," says Xu.
Settling in for the long haul
The summer was a time of a
transition for the student move
ment in the United States. Al
though the massacre and
continuing efforts to rescue dissi
dents remained on everyone's
minds, the movement had to adapt
to the fact that it was no longer
an adjunct to the movement
within in China.
And the timetables of democra
tization had been lengthened from
weeks and months to years. As
graduate student Bao Yichin
points out, "In the short term,
there is no chance of forming an
other democratic movement
within China. The overseas or
ganizations must preserve the
momentum over the next couple
years."
After some initial hesitations
and missteps, Chinese students
,have developed a national and iiv

ture for protecting students and
furthering the democracy move
ment. The result is, in the words
of Lu, "a quieter movement, but
one in which there is still a lot
of work to do."
Work continues at the office of
the Association of Chinese Stu
dents and Scholars at Stanford,
but there is a sense of limitation.
According to Pan, "There is very
little we can do except send money
and letters."
Although most members agree
that the association has the mo
mentum to carry on political ac
tivism, there is some uncertainty
about the next step to take.
"Frankly, we don't know what to
do next," one member says.
Much of the association's cur
rent work centers on establishing
and maintaining new organiza
tions set up for the long term, a
movement in which a number of
Stanford students play central
roles. Says graduate student Liu
Yongchuan, "Although we think
it will take years, at this moment
there is a consensus that we will
not drop from our goals." J

Chinese students expressed their disappointment in the government of their homeland at a vigil here
last June commemorating the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Since then, the students
have continued to press for reforms in China.
