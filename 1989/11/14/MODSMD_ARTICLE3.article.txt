# Chinese at Stanford continue fight for democracy from afar
##

Editor's note: This is the first ar
ticle in a four-part series on the
Chinese student movement at
Stanford. Several of those inter
viewed withheld their names
because of concern for family
members remaining in China.

The silence of the June 6 vigil
in White Plaza for the victims of
the massacre in Tiananmen
Square was eloquent. Better than
any words, it expressed the depth
of disappointment among Chinese
students who had just watched on
television as soldiers systemati
cally shot crowds of unarmed
workers and students on the
streeets of Beijing.
As the death toll mounted into

the thousands, Chinese students
at Stanford threw themselves into
the effort to stop the ongoing kil
ling in China. Within days they
collected hundreds of signatures

on petitions, sent letters to George
Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev, the
United Nations and the Red
Cross, and lobbied for economic
sanctions against China.
At the time, concerns for their
own personal safety were far from
the students' minds. Graduate
student Dai Jiangang says his par
ticipation "was very natural at

that point. It was only a couple
of months later that I began to
feel afraid."
However, the activism did not
start with the vigil. The road that
led Dai and others to outspoken
political involvement began well
before the firing in Tiananmen
Square.
When it was founded several
years ago, the Association of Chi
nese Students and Scholars at
Stanford was a recreational and
social group, funded largely by
contributions from the Chinese
consulate in San Francisco.
All students coming from main
land China automatically became
members of the group, which
aimed to help them adjust to life
in America and to bring students
together for volleyball, movies and
dances — a task complicated by

the difficulty of luring them away
from their studies and research.
Most of the Chinese students
at Stanford in the hard sci
ences, engineering and medicine,
as do most of the 40,000 Chinese
students elsewhere in the United
States. Like other foreign gradu
ate students, men make up the
overwhelming majority of the Chi
nese students at Stanford.
In March 1989, there were
about 385 mainland nationals at
Stanford, including 182 students,
71 visiting scholars and about 120
family members. Since March,
few, if any, have returned home
permanently.
Before the protests began in
Beijing, the Chinese community
at Stanford was supportive of the
government's reform efforts. A
group of about 20 students held

bi-weekly discussion forums
about prospects for economic and
political reform in China. Coming
out against the government was
the farthest thing from the stu
dents' minds.
Support for reforms
Looking back on the discussion
groups, one participant says,
"They weren't anti-government
because the government itself was
reforming. We were just suggest
ing how to go about the reforms."
On several occasions Stanford
students submitted respectful ob
jections to changes in government
policy — opposing a proposed
tightening of requirements for
students studying abroad and the
removal of Hu Yaobang from his
post as General Secretary of the

Chinese Communist Party, and
supporting the appeal of Fang
Lizhi, a prominent critic of the
government, for the release of po
litical prisoners.
But, according to Zhou, stu
dents took great pains to present
their objections in "a way the
leaders would find acceptable."
In 1985, however, students were
reminded that even gentle oppo
sition might not be acceptable to
some leaders. Li Peng, then Vice
Premier of China, visited Stan
ford. One student remembers him
speaking in authoritarian tones
when questioned on government
pel icy and challenging the right
of the students to question him.
Another student recalls Li telling
the Chinese students that he
