# Greek system means service as well as social functions
## 
### Erika Frick 
It's Monday morning and you roll into
your nine o'clock class, still recovering from
the weekend. What's the first thing you
say when you see a friend who is a member
of a fraternity? Please choose either A)
"Great party on Saturday, dude!" or B) "I
can't believe so many people got cited as
they walked out the door! Your frat is
going to lose housing any day now, ..."
Sound familiar? It seems like everyone
thinks of fraternities and sororities in
terms of the parties they give. Too often,
however, students discussing the latest
party have a negative impression of the
Greek system. People overlook the positive
contributions these organizations make to
the Stanford community, especially in
terms of community service.
"Sometimes I hear a lot of griping about
the Greek system as just parties, and that's
just not true," according to Sheilon King,
philanthropy chair of the Kappa Kappa
Gamma sorority. "The entire Greek system
does a lot of philanthropy."
"In general, the only things you hear
about the Greek system are that someone
is suspended or someone is on probation,
and you don't really hear the good things,"
agreed Alpha Kappa Alpha president
Sharisse Kimbro.
King, who is also a resident assistant in
Florence Moore Hall, noted that Kappas
are required to complete four hours of com
munity service each quarter. The group
traditionally supports Lytton Gardens, a

retirement home in Palo Alto, as well as
participating in a blood drive and volun
teering to drive STOP vans for students
needing rides home, she said.
Kimbro said community service for her
group includes more than just time
consuming volunteer work and fundraisers
— it also encompasses cultural program
ming. AKA, a member of the Afro-
American Fraternal and Sororal
Association, is participating in a "Speak
Now" program at the East Palo Alto Wom
en's Consortium. Each month a different
member of the sorority serves as a "role
model," speaking to black youth about
career and educational choices, she said.
Another way of reaching out at Stanford
involves simply spending time with mem
bers of the surrounding community. "We
try to help people who may be lonely or
otherwise needing help," said Sigma Alpha
Epsilon president John Connolly.
SAE members plan to be "Big Brothers
for a day" for boys in the "Big Broth
er/Little Brother" program who do not yet
have big brothers assigned to them, Con
nolly said. Members will take the boys
around campus during the day — tenta
tively scheduled for Nov. 11 — and in the
evening hold a big barbecue. Connolly said
this is just one of several community serv
ice projects the SAE members have
planned.
According to Interfraternity Council
President Todd Ortega, community service

isn't necessarily a primary reason
for joining a fraternity, "but it's
something you take into account"
before joining. Ortega noted that
different groups have varying em
phases on service. For some or
ganizations, community service is
especially important.
"Philanthropy has to be a main
interest," for prospective Kappa
Alpha Psi members, according to
chapter president John Meigs,
"because we stress that before,
during and after the pledge proc
ess."
"It's one of the main focuses of
KAP," Meigs continued. "I'd esti
mate that one third to one half
of our activities outside of just
fraternity activities involve cul
tural programming and commu
nity service."
The KAP chapter recently held
a canned food drive to provide
earthquake relief and, according
to Meigs, they "usually do a bigger
food drive between Thanksgiving
and Christmas," with proceeds
donated to the Ecumenical
Hunger Project in Palo Alto.
"Our main focus is in East Palo
Alto with the minority communi
ty," Meigs said. "I wouldn't be so
pretentious as to say we do a huge
amount — as college students
there's only so much we can
realistically do." But he said he
believes it's good practice to begin
doing community service during
the undergraduate years, because

"you're more likely to follow
through with it later in life."
Ortega mentioned another ben
efit of community service.
"Philanthropy is good for the fra
ternity or sorority," he claimed.
"It brings members together in a
different kind of light. It really
brings them closer "
Ortega added that just a few of
the recent or upcoming service
events include:
— Kappa Alpha's Mud Volley
ball Tournament, to be held on
Saturday, Jan. 20 this year. The
proceeds of the event go to the
Muscular Dystrophy Association.
Each team must pay a $100 reg
istration fee by Nov. 23, and, with
corporate sponsors, the KAs are
trying to raise $20,000 this year.
"The KAs are already going
around to house meetings to sign
up teams," noted Ortega.
— Theta Breakers, held this
past weekend. A 5K and 10K an
nual road race is sponsored by
the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority
to support the Community Asso
ciation for the Retarded.
— Sigma Phi Epsilon's Casino
Night, held on Nov. 4. The sixth
annual all-campus party at Toyon
benefited the Ronald McDonald
House.
— Sigma Phi Epsilon's Pigskin
Relay, held on Big Game weekend.
The Stanford and Berkeley chap
ters get together and run a relay
from one school to the other, each
member running one mile.
Through sponsorships they raise
money for the Ronald McDonald
House.
