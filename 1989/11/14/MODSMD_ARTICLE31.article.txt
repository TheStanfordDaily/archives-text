# Cal cheerleaders nabbed by students
## 
### 
Hey faithful readers. It's Big
Game time in the happy world
of This Week in Stanford His
tory.
November 17, 1938
The Stanford Daily
Bobby Grayson, former Ail-
American fullback and assis
tant coach of Stanford's football
team, received a standing ova
tion at the Encina Bonfire after
shouting, "Stanford will lick
the pants off Cal as sure as
I'm standing here!"
California went on to win
that year's Big Game 6-0, per
haps because the Stanford
players ignored Grayson's lead
ership and refused to lick the
pants of their opponents.
Sounds like it would have been
an effective strategy, though. In
the meantime, send Volpe up
the middle.
November 18, 1958
The Stanford Daily
Students from both Stanford
and UC-Berkeley violated a
non-aggression pact designed
to end campus vandalism asso
ciated with Big Game within a
week of the pact's ratification
by student leaders and admin
istrators at both schools.
Nine Stanford students were
caught in Memorial Stadium at
UC-Berkeley trying to saw
down the California goal posts.
In Big Game action across the
bay, Stanford police stopped
the car of five UC-Berkeley stu
dents as they left Stanford after
scrawling blue and gold graffiti
on a number of campus build
ings, including Hoover Tower.
The five claimed they were
Stanford students, but the cans
of blue paint the police found
in the trunk of their car dis

credited their story.
November 18, 1969
The Stanford Daily
A group of Stanford students
posing as San Francisco
Chronicle reporters kidnapped
two UC-Berkeley cheerleaders
and a reporter from the Daily
Californian.

The students gained the
money they used to support
their prank by dressing up in
UC-Berkeley shirts and solici
ting contributions to the Blitz
Stanford Fund on the UC-
Berkeley campus. The group
met the two Berkeley cheer
leaders to interview them in a
car painted as a Chronicle staff
car. The cheerleaders entered
the conspirators' car just as a
Daily Californian reporter ar
rived on the scene. He was also
escorted into the car.
The UC-Berkeley students
said they weren't suspicious
until the car began crossing the
Bay Bridge on the way back to
the Farm. At this point one of
the cheerleaders declared, "My
father is a lawyer," to which
one of the kidnappers replied,
"So is mine." The kidnappers
took pictures of the cheer
leaders on top of Hoover Tower
and in front of the Claw before
returning them to UC-
Berkeley.
