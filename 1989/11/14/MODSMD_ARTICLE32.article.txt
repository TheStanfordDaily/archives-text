# 1989 College Bowl yields good times and trivia
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
When David Wang correctly
named the four teenage mutant
Niiya turtles, he gained 20 points
for his team, the Nucleotides.
When Naomi Williams gave the
answer, "the late Japanese Em
peror Hirohito," she passed 10
points on to her team, the Rain
bow Warriors. The question Na
omi was asked? Of course — it
was, "Who was buried with a
Mickey Mouse watch plus lists of
sumo wrestlers ... ?"
Does this sound bizarre and
hugely trivial? It shouldn't. Teams
reaped in hefty amounts of points
by answering these and other
questions Sunday afternoon, as
they participated in Stanford's
1989 College Bowl competition.
Students were required to answer
questions covering areas of litera
ture, history, current events and
geography in the competition, and
also, it seems, were required to
have fun.
Forty-eight teams, each com
prised of four members and one
alternate, competed in this fall's
competition. The day's events
were coordinated jointly by Nancy
Howe, assistant director at Tres
idder, and sophomore David
Frazee, tournament director and
student coordinator of the College
Bowl Program. The round-robin
tournament consisted of 40
matches, moderated by Jeff Dem
min and Frazee, which were held
during the past two weekends. Ac
cording to Howe, "Stanford has
more teams competing [in the Col
lege Bowl] than any other col
lege."
Howe explained that the College
Bowl Competition has been spon
sored since 1980 by the Associa
tion of College Unions
International. Stanford won the
national tournament that year
and has sent a team to regionals
every year since then, in an at
tempt to regain the first-place
title.
Although Stanford has not won
regionals recently, the university

sponsored team has usually placed
a respectable third or fourth
place. According to Neil Morgan
besser, a Stanford graduate stu
dent who competed in last year's
regional tournament, "The other
teams really enjoyed being able to
say they beat Stanford."
Morganbesser had a good day
this past Sunday, as his team,
consisting of graduate students
Rivers Lelong, Diddy Morris, Neil
Nathanson and himself, formed
this year's winning college bowl
quartet. In order to reach this
pinnacle of erudition, the four
some had to contend with increas
ingly tough questions such as,
"Who were three of the four So
viet officials who approved the in
vasion of Afghanistan?" and other
similar stumpers.

Morganbesser's team, called
"McKenzie, Brackman," prevailed
over competition with names like
Still a Huddled Mass in second
place and the Rainbow Warriors
in third. David Wang and the
Nucleotides took fourth place in
the competition and were the top
undergraduate team.
Even with this winning effort,
however, all the members of
McKenzie, Brackman will not go
on to regionals. Individuals are
selected for the event from the
various teams on the basis of their
point records, dedication and
fields of knowledge. According to
Howe, "We want the team to have
broad backgrounds in various
areas of knowledge." Also, she
added, only two members of the
"all-star" team can be graduate

students.
Howe said that regionals will
take place at the California
Polytechnic Institute at San Luis
Obispo over President's weekend
in February, 1990. Should Stan
ford win, she said, the team will
go on to compete in this summer's
national tournament.
It turns out that the College
Bowl teams are as varied and di
verse as the questions themselves.
Still a Huddled Mass Yearning to
Be Free derived their name from
a poem by Emma Lazarus in
scribed on the base of the Statue
of Liberty. McKenzie, Brackman,
a three-year-old team, appropri
ately selected the name of the law
firm of the TV show "LA Law,"
because the team members are
all law students.

Howe said that regionals will
take place at the California
Polytechnic Institute at San Luis

firm of the TV show "LA Law,"
