# Tour guides reveal unique side of Stanford
## 
### Alison Derbenwick 
Most students walk past
Memorial Church ten times a day,
and look up at Hoover Tower at
least ten times that. We usually
do it with a certain passive non
chalance. But for a lot of tourists,
these everyday sights are part of
the incredible fascination that is
Stanford.
Another group of people on
campus who realize that Stanford
is something special is the Stan
ford Tour Guides. It is their job
to bring to life the magic of this
campus sometimes known as the
"Disneyland of the North."
Sophomore Kelly Fisher said
that some of the most enjoyable
tourists are prospective freshmen.
One woman had come to see the
campus and was obviously not
thrilled about doing it with her
parents in tow. When asked, "Can
I help you?" at the information
booth at the front of the Quad,
she calmly responded, "Yes. I'd
like one campus map and a shot
gun for my parents."
For many people, one of the
most special things about Stan
ford is its support of a multicul
tural community. The tour guides
say that they feel this is an im
portant facet they try to convey.
Guides said that they feel this
diversity can be seen in the com
position of the tour guide staff.
Senior Dan Vatanaviggun said he
believes that being from Thailand
was a main reason why he was
hired. He said that his back
ground and special perspective on

Stanford allow him to give unique
tours.
On the average, a full-time tour
guide gives two tours a week and
five special tours a quarter. Tours
usually include a brief history of
Stanford and visits to famous
sites such as the clock tower and
Memorial Church. However, tours
have changed slightly after the
earthquake.
Senior Joelle Coletta said that
now she makes a special stop at
the earthquake display at the
front of the Quad and then stands
outside Mem Chu while she talks
about it. She also takes tourists
on the Row because many of them
are curious to see the earthquake
damage. Coletta added that
Columbae is especially
noteworthy because the damage
is so dramatic.
Senior Raelene Walker said that
tours usually include a trip up
Hoover Tower. Recently, however,
enthusiasm for the trip has
decreased, probably because of the
earthquake. She added that many
of the guides aren't completely
comfortable with the idea of
standing 12 stories above the
ground for long periods of time.
Walker also said that most tour
guides talk a lot about what it's
like to live at Stanford. "Prospec
tive students want to hear about
student life," she said. She noted
that one of her personal favorite
topics of discussion is the Dead
Week tradition known as the
"Primal Scream." There is some
thing uniquely Stanford about
screaming at the top of one's lungs

at midnight for an entire week.
Although tour guides receive ex
tensive training, much of what
happens on any tour is based on
their individual personalities and
the personality of the group, ac
cording to Walker. Tours do not
follow a preset route, which allows
for flexibility and makes tours
more fun for both the guides and
their guests. "It's really fun to
share something you've enjoyed
with other people," Vatanaviggun
said.
Being a tour guide is not always
all fun and games, however.
Walker said that giving tours to
foreigners can be a problem due

to language barriers. When she
has been lucky, there has been
someone in the group who can
translate if she is not able to do
it herself. Yet there are times
when "you wonder if anyone out
there understands a word that
you're saying, and that can be
frustrating,'' she added.
However, Walker said that
those experiences are minor be
cause there are more good expe
riences than bad, which makes
being a tour guide worthwhile.
Fisher agreed. "I love Stanford,
and as a result, I love to show it
off. And that's what being a tour
guide is all about."
