## Lavoie, Svoboda quit basketball 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The women's basketball team was rocked over
the weekend by news that junior reserves Tammy
Svoboda and Celeste Lavoie had quit the team and
decided to transfer to other schools.
"They just basically decided Stanford wasn't for
them," Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
Asked if the she was somewhat surprised by the
news, VanDerveer replied, "Somewhat is an under
statement. I was shocked."
Lavoie and Svoboda could not be reached for
comment.
VanDerveer expressed no bitterness over their
decisions. "The important thing is for them to be
happy," she said. "I wish them the best of luck.
They're very good people, very good players."
Senior guard Jennifer Azzi echoed that sentiment.
"I can understand (their decision) if they're not
happy," Azzi said. "I hope they'll be happy." She
noted, however, that "their quitting is not a reflec
tion of the (Stanford basketball) program."
"I feel really bad as a teammate that they're
leaving ... it hurts," Azzi said. "I don't think they'll
find better teammates anywhere."
The timing of the announcement was unusual.
"(Saturday) they came in and told us they had made
their decision," Azzi added. "It was weird."
"It was very upsetting to myself and the people
on the team," VanDerveer said. "I'm very proud of
the 11 people (remaining on the team). They're
very committed. Our goals have not changed."
On the practical side, the loss of the 6-foot-3

It was very upsetting to myself
and the people on the team. I'm
very proud of the 11 people
(remaining on the team). They're
very committed. Our goals have
not changed.'

Svoboda and the 6-1 Lavoie leaves the team a bit
thin at the power forward and center positions.
"(The loss of these players) doesn't give you the
depth you want . . . and need," VanDerveer said.
As it stands now, an injury to Val Whiting, Julie
Zeilstra or Trisha Stevens could be devastating.
In addition, by waiting until now to make their
decisions, Lavoie and Svoboda have hurt Stanford's
recruiting efforts. Thinking they were looking to
fill the spots that will be left by the graduation of
Azzi, small forward Katy Steding and guard Stacy
Parson, Stanford coaches did not focus their atten
tion on recruiting post players.
"If we had known a month ago, we could have
recruited someone for next year," VanDerveer said.
Instead, the Cardinal will be unable to fill the void
until the 1991-92 season.
Stanford did attempt to recruit one center-forward
type for next year because she was talented and
6-7. VanDerveer said the prospect looked at Stan
ford's big people and said, "You don't need me."
She decided to attend Vanderbilt.
