# Cal should reconsider admissions
## 
### 
What to write about. . . .
About this time of year
there's always some
grumbling on one side of the Bay
or the other. Last year it was
grumbling about how Jack Elway
should or should not be fired.
Before that it was about whether
or not Joe Kapp would be fired
and whether or not he'd be
wearing his pants when it hap
pened.
This year, however, there
doesn't seem to be any grumbling.
California fans are happy — and
probably amazed — that their
team won its last two games over
good opponents. Troy Taylor is
having the kind of games he was
supposed to have all season long
and the defense has been tough
in the second half.
On this side of the Bay, where
the phallic symbol of choice is
Hoover Tower, not the Cam
panile, there is also little in the
way of complaint. True, the team
has not had nearly the year people
hoped for, but there have been a
number of good signs.
People realize Stanford is under
a new coach and has suffered
more injuries than any other
Pacific 10 Conference team. Thus,
despite a 2-8 record, optimism is
present, if not abounding.
Perhaps the only grumbling
over here is due to hypocrisy over
there.
That was the part where I
occasionally tried to be fun
ny. This is the part where
I'm going to be serious.
As anyone who went to high
school in California knows, the
University of California system is
good. Very good, in fact.
Over the past few years, the
UC system has continued to up
its admissions standards. This is
an admirable goal.
The UC system provides inex
pensive high-quality education to

California residents. Since the
state has a strong junior college
system, as well as many state
schools such as San Jose State,
the UC system can be elitist and
all Californians will still have a
chwnce tofct-wi''- mcupwiaive ed»
ucation in-state.
When one thinks of schools like
Cal, UCLA and UC-Davis, one
realizes they are very good
schools. In U.S. News and World
Report's annual rankings of the
top colleges in the country, Cal is
one of the few public schools to
frequently make the top 10.
Everyone who went to high
school in this state has heard
about a friend of a friend who was
really smart. But, despite a 3.9
GPA, he got turned down by Cal
or UCLA or Davis or some other
UC school trying to be one of the
nation's best.
This friend would not be too
happy to look at his pro
gram if he were at the foot
ball game Sunday. He'll open it
up and scan down the Cal roster.
He'll get to No. 4 — Russell
White, a freshman tailback from
Encino, Calif. Maybe he'll remem
ber the name. . . . "Russell
White. I read about him. That
guy was awesome in high school.
I wonder why he's not playing."
The answer is simple. Russell
White can't play due to Prop. 48.

This NCAA rule states that if a
player either does not have a 2.0
GPA or does not score a 700 on
the SAT, he has to sit out of
athletics his freshman year. Rus
sell White took the SAT four times
but didn't get his 700 on any of
those attempts.
Meanwhile sophomore guard
DeShon Brown couldn't play on
the Cal basketball team last year
because he also fell under the clas
sification of Prop. 48.
So why does Cal let these two
guys in, but not that guy with
the 3.9? The answer is simple —
money.
If the football or basketball
team does well, alumni are happy.
Happy alums give money. Thus,
if you bring in good players and
win some games, you get money.
The only problem is that it does
a disservice to the people who go
to school by cheapening the
degrees they work for. It does a
disservice to professors who have
to deal with students who might
not be ready for the professors'
classes. And most importantly it
does a disservice to the student
athletes who receive special ad
mission.
The odds that they'll make it
in the pros are amazingly long,
simply because of the numbers
cruch. And while they may get a
degree, chances are good that
many things they were supposed
to learn went right over their
heads.
If Cal didn't let them in, they
could go to a junior college for
two years. If they work hard on
their studies, they will then be
ready to attend a top-notch four
year school and learn, learn, learn.
I think the choice is simple.
