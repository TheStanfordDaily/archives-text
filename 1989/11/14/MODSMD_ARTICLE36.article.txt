## Sargent grabs 10th at Singlehanded Nationals 
### Sarah Gannett 
While teammate Al Sargent
battled national competition back
East, the rest of the Stanford sail
ing team took advantage of local
knowledge to capture three of the
top five positions at the Stanford
Invitational in Redwood City last
weekend.
In conditions ranging from light
to heavy breezes, the Cardinal
dominated the 25-boat competi
tion, with Stanford's first- and
second-place boats finishing 70
and 40 points ahead of third-place
California, respectively. A third
Stanford crew finished fifth, just
10 points behind the University
of Hawaii.
Sargent's job was not so easy.
Competing in the Singlehanded
Nationals, he faced the top-16
Laser sailors in the country. In
unknown waters, Sargent man
aged to finish 10th. "It was an
amazingly competitive fleet," Sar
gent said. "I felt that I was sailing
well, but there were others sailing
better." Sargent finished ahead
of any West Coast sailor, including
three-time All-American Jamie
Malm of UC-Irvine, who had
defeated Sargent in the Pacific
Coast Championships.
The outstanding performers at
the Stanford Invite were first
place winners Dave Dowd, Lydia
Snape, Brett Adams and Kathryn
Haggitt, who beat teammates

It was an amazingly
competitive fleet. I felt
that I was sailing well,
but there were others
sailing better.'
— Al Sargent

Matt Sanford, Deborah Claymon,
Brady Sih and Matt Dunbar by
30 points. Although Sih and Dun
bar captured first in seven of the
nine races in their division, a 10th
in one race and a premature start
by Sanford and Claymon put the
foursome behind the more consis
tent first-place finishers. Finish
ing in fifth for the Cardinal were
Peter Somers, Paula Gani, Paul
Brotherton and Sydney Roberts.
"The regattas this weekend
were tests for our sailors, but very
different kinds of tests." Coach
Blake Middleton said. "While A 1
tested against the nation's best
and brightest, our other sailors
tested against flukey weather con
ditions. They all came out on top
in my opinion."
The team has this weekend off
but will be competing over
Thanksgiving break in the Timme
Angsten Regatta in Chicago and
in the U.S./Japan Collegiate
Championship in Los Angeles.
