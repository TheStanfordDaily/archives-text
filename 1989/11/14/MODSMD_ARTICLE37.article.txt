## Stanford star capitalizes on Albano's injury, wins 7-5, 6-1 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
A trip to Minneapolis in the
middle of winter might not be
everyone's idea of a great
birthday present. But for Teri
Whitlinger, who turned 21 yes
terday, it was just what she had
hoped for.
Whitlinger actually had
earned a spot in the Rolex Na
tional Tournament simply by
reaching yesterday's final. But
on her special day, she put the
icing on the cake by besting Cal
ifornia standout Lisa Albano, 7-
5, 6-1 to capture the title in the
Rolex Regional Qualifying Tour
nament.
Whitlinger now will join team
mates Sandra Birch, Debbie
Graham, Lisa Green and
Meredith McGrath in Minneap
olis this February for one of the
most prestigious events in col
legiate tennis.
Through the first eight games
of the final, neither player was
able to gain much of an advan
tage. Both Whitlinger and Al
bano stayed back and bombed
away from the baseline. "It was

a battle of groundstrokes,"
Whitlinger said.
"I was trying not to run her
out wide," Whitlinger added, ex
plaining that Albano likes to be
in position to hit sharp-angle
shots from off the edges of the
court.
The server clearly had the ad
vantage in the early going with
each player holding three times.
When Whitlinger served a love
game to move up 4-3, Albano
answered with a love game of
her own to draw even.
"I'd play a great game, then
I'd play a lousy game," Whit
linger said of her opening-set
performance.
With the two All-Americans
locked in what appeared to be
a great battle, the match sud
denly turned into a rout. On the
first point of the ninth game,
Albano pulled a groin muscle
and was never the same.
Whitlinger easily closed out
the game and led 5-4. She then
sat waiting as Stanford trainer
Rickey Hayes tended to Albano's
ir\jury. When play resumed, the
delay actually had more of an
effect on Whitlinger.

Albano came out gimpy but
held serve when Whitlinger
made a number of unforced er
rors.
"I kept wondering ... if she
was going to stop (playing),"
Whitlinger added. Her state of
distraction didn't last long,
though. Whitlinger held serve
and finally broke Albano to cap
ture the first set 7-5.
Albano then resorted to a wide
array of lobs and moonballs to
stay in the match. But while
the Cal sophomore tried to con
serve her energy for an occa
sional big swing, Whitlinger
went on the offensive and un
leashed a barrage of powerful
shots.
Unable to run at top speed
and unable to hit the ball hard,
Albano saw her chances slip
away. Whitlinger broked her in
the second and fourth games
and led 4-0. Albano actually
broke right back, but that would
be her last charge.
Whitlinger punctuated a serv
ice break in the next game with
an angle volley for a winner. Up
5-1, she then served out the
match to win the tournament.
