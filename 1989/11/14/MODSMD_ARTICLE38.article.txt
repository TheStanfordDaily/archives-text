# Spikers look to best Bears in Big Match
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
After sweeping the Arizona
schools last weekend, both the
Stanford and California women's
volleyball teams are hoping to con
tinue the momentum in their
respective bids for the NCAA
tournament. Unfortunately for
one of them, somebody will lose
tonight when the Cardinal and
the Golden Bears square off in
the Big Match.
Over the last five matches,
Stanford and Cal have both
beaten USC, Arizona and Arizona
State, and have both lost to
UCLA. Cal, ranked 18th in last
week's Tachikara/AVCA national
poll of coaches, is 17-10 this season
and 7-8 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. Stanford, with its weekend
victories, is now 15-8 and 11-4 in
the Pac-10.
In many ways each team's
season has mirrored the other's.
But that difference of four games
in the conference standings means
Stanford holds second place and
will receive a regional bid. The
Bears, however, occupy seventh
place in the conference and need
some victories over top teams to
attract the attention of the NCAA
selection committee.
The Cardinal, ranked sixth in
last week's national poll, is just

the big-name team that Cal needs
to beat. And Stanford Coach Don
Shaw knows it.
"They're playing pretty well,"
Shaw said of the Bears. "They've
lost some matches we thought
they'd win and they won some
matches that we didn't expect
them to win."
Cal, led hy outside hitters Tif
fany Rochelle and Lisa Arce,
defeated the llth-ranked USC
Women of Troy last week before
upsetting No. 6 Arizona on Sat
urday night in four games.
For her efforts last week, Arce
was named the Pac-10 Player of
the Week. Rochelle is hitting .268
to lead the Bears this season. Set
ter Holly McPeak, the national
Freshman of the Year two years
ago, runs the offense for Cal.
Stanford, meanwhile, Has also
been playing well. Stanford
defeated Arizona Sunday after
noon in a hard-fought five-game
match. The previous Friday night
the Cardinal handled Arizona
State in a three-game sweep.
The play of the Stanford front
three has been exceptional recent
ly. Over the weekend matches,
freshman middle blocker Bev
Oden hit .391 and added five solo
blocks and eight block assists.
Senior outside hitter Laura
Olesen tallied a .359 hitting per
centage for the weekend, and
sophomore outside hitter Kristin

Klein hit .239.
"We did have a couple of good
wins [in Arizona]," Shaw said.
"We've continued to improve, and
we're going in the right direc
tion."
Tonight's contest is the res
cheduled match of the one origi
nally scheduled for Oct. 17 but
canceled due to the earthquake.
The two teams last met Sept. 27
in Berkeley with Stanford win
ning in four games, 15-3, 15-12,
14-16, 15-5. Stanford has won 13
in a row from the Bears and leads
the series 23-3.
After tonight's match, Stanford
has only four remaining. The Car
dinal will close out its home
schedule this weekend with a Fri
day night match against the No.
13-ranked Washington Huskies,
who are chasing Stanford for sec
ond place in the conference. Sun
day at noon Stanford will host
Washington State, who currently
occupies the cellar in the Pac-10.
