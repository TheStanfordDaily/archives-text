# Spikers look to best Bears in Big Match

### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
After sweeping the Arizona
schools last weekend, both the
Stanford and California women's
volleyball teams are hoping to con
tinue the momentum in their
respective bids for the NCAA
tournament. Unfortunately for
one of them, somebody will lose
tonight when the Cardinal and
the Golden Bears square off in
the Big Match.
Over the last five matches,
Stanford and Cal have both
beaten USC, Arizona and Arizona
State, and have both lost to
UCLA. Cal, ranked 18th in last
week's Tachikara/AVCA national
poll of coaches, is 17-10 this season
and 7-8 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. Stanford, with its weekend
victories, is now 15-8 and 11-4 in
the Pac-10.
In many ways each team's
season has mirrored the other's.
But that difference of four games
in the conference standings means
Stanford holds second place and
will receive a regional bid. The
Bears, however, occupy seventh
place in the conference and need
some victories over top teams to
attract the attention of the NCAA
selection committee.
The Cardinal, ranked sixth in
last week's national poll, is just

the big-name team that Cal needs
to beat. And Stanford Coach Don
Shaw knows it.
"They're playing pretty well,"
Shaw said of the Bears. "They've
lost some matches we thought
they'd win and they won some
matches that we didn't expect
them to win."
Cal, led hy outside hitters Tif
fany Rochelle and Lisa Arce,
defeated the llth-ranked USC
Women of Troy last week before
upsetting No. 6 Arizona on Sat
urday night in four games.
For her efforts last week, Arce
was named the Pac-10 Player of
