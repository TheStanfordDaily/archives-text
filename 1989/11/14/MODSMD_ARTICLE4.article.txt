## Nine Berkeley students caught in annual Big Game-week vandalism 
### Geoff Goldman John Wagner Staff writers 
Stanford police nabbed nine
UC-Berkeley students early
Monday morning for various
acts of campus vandalism com
mitted in anticipation of Satur
day's Big Game showdown be
tween the two Bay Area rivals.
One of the students was
caught spray-painting a blue and
gold "C" on a sign near Hoover
Tower around 12:30 a.m., ac
cording to police. He was ar
rested and later cited and re
leased.
According to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, the other
eight students, who were not ar
rested, were carrying cans of
blue and gold spray paint and
had blue paint on their hands.
Although the eight students
were not arrested, Niemeyer said
the Stanford police department
will ask the district attorney to
press charges against them.
One officer, who asked that
her name not be used, said
several students had not been
caught in the act, but upon ques
tioning "were dumb enough to
confess."
According to Niemeyer, when
first confronted, the students
said they were from Foothill Col
lege and were studying at Stan
ford. Upon further investigation,
they admitted to being students
from Berkeley, Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer noted that although
vandalism of this nature occurs
every year during the week
before Big Game, the group

Monday morning seemed more
organized than in previous
years. He said their activities
were "well-planned."
But evidence of a well
conceived master plan was dif
ficult to ascertain during inter
views with some of the ap
prehended students. "We've
never been here before. That's
our first mistake," one said.
As evidence of the students'
organizational skills, Niemeyer
cited the fact that they brought
bicycles with them so they could
get around campus more easily.
In addition, the pranksters were
equipped with bear claw stencils,
copies of the Stanford map,
utility knives and backpacks
filled with blue and gold paint,
he said.
One of the apprehended, who
granted an interview but refused
to give his name, expressed deep
concern over the confiscation of
his backpack. According to the
student, in addition to spray
paint and other paraphernalia,
his backpack contained a prob
lem set due later that day.
"The police are ruining my ac
ademic life," he complained.
Niemeyer said that someone
had spray-painted the word
"Cal" near Building 260. "Go
Bears" was painted on a sign
near Building 10 and blue and
gold paw prints were found on
the north wall of the Bookstore.
