## Kang takes foil crown, D'Amico captures sabre division 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
Although this weekend's Stan
ford Collegiate Open was an in
dividual event, the net result of
the tournament was a clear dem
onstration that the Cardinal
men's and women's fencing
teams are once again the ones
to beat on the West Coast.
The competition, which was
held at Old Pavilion Saturday
and Sunday, featured over 100
fencers from around the West
Coast and served as a warmup
for the regular season.
Freshman Lana Kang, fencing
for the first time as a Cardinal
Sunday, captured the women's
foil title, and sophomore
Leonard D'Amico earned first
place honors in the sabre divi
sion Sunday as well.
Kang, facing West Coast op
ponents for the first time after
extensive Eastern fencing expe
rience, seemed unfazed by the
adjustment, winning four of five
bouts in the round-robin final

to take the championship over
Mary Metzger of Santa Cruz,
who beat Kang but lost two
other bouts. Stanford's
Elisabeth Spilman and Grace
Chang captured fourth and fifth
places, respectively.
"I didn't really know what to
expect fencing out here, and it
was tougher than I thought it
would be. I fenced more aggres
sively than usual but I always
had my defense to fall back on,"
Kang said.
Of the six finalists in the
women's foil, all came from
either Stanford or Santa Cruz.
"Technically we're even with
Santa Cruz, but we outfenced
them because we're in better
physical condition," Women's
Coach Sherry Posthumus said.
D'Amico, who had been
favored to take home the sabre
going into the competition, lived
up to expectations by mowing
down the field with ease, win
ning all of his five bouts. The
only threat to D'Amico was pre
sented by Cardinal junior Doug

Flinn, who lost a 5-4 decision
to his teammate and fenced im
pressively to capture second
place. Stanford's Curt Cetrulo
finished fifth.
Saturday's men's foil event
featured some excitement. Car
dinal sophomore Nick Bravin,
the second-ranked junior fencer
in the nation, had been expected
to dominate. In the first round
of competition, however, Bravin
and arch-nemesis Allesandro
Isolani of Santa Cruz injured
each other by forcefully knock
ing knees.
Although both fencers fought
on practically one leg the rest
of the way, Isolani managed sec
ond place overall, while Bravin
took third. In the epee,
Dimitstry Smolyanitsy took
first ahead of Cardinal fencers
Rocky Kahn, Jeremy Nelson,
and Chris McKenna, who cap
tured second, third, and fourth,
respectively.
The men's and women's
squads open the regular season
against California Friday.
