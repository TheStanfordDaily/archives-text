## 
### Greg Gottesman Editorial staff 
Though in the midst of a
"rebuilding" year, Stanford's ul
timate frisbee team captured the
San Diego Collegiate Frisbee In
vitational title this past weekend
in San Diego, dominating Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo in the final,
15-5.
Despite being seeded first in the
tournament, the Cardinal, which
lost most of its starting lineup to
graduation, did not expect to
reach the later rounds of the
event. "We did not expect to make
the finals," team member Warren
Packard said. "We thought we
might have a chance of finishing
strong, but winning the whole
tournament was beyond expecta
tions."
According to co-captain Mike

Novotny, the younger members of
the team rose to the occasion.
"The rookies played intensely,"
Novotny said. "They played smart
and really went all out on defense.
They also didn't get intimidated
by the veteran players from the
other teams."
The Stanford veterans, how
ever, held the team together. "The
rookies played extremely well, but
the veterans really were the glue
that held the offense together,"
senior Neal Mahutte said.
The Cardinal played six games
en route to the title. In the first
contest, Stanford started slowly,
edging Cal-Tech 11-7. In the next
two games, however, Stanford
dominated, destroying Pitzer and
San Diego State by scores of 13-6
and 15-5, respectively.
The Cardinal met UCLA in the
quarter finals and walked away

with a 13-9 triumph. "It wasn't
as close as the score ftould indi
cate. We had a pretty big lead.
But then we played a few poor
points and allowed them to get
back into it," Packard said.
In the semi-finals, the Cardinal
hurled its way to a 15-8 victory
over a "reinforced" San Diego
State team. "It was the toughest
match of the tournament," Pack
ard said.
The final paired Stanford with
San Luis Obispo. Despite
dominating each of its earlier op
ponents, the Mustangs could not
handle the Cardinal pressure.
"We beat them with great de
fense," Mahutte said. "They had
a lot of experienced throwers,
which meant they weren't going
to make stupid mistakes. But we
clamped a tough zone defense and
took the disc away from them."
