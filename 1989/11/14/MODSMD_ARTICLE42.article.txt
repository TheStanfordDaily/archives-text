# Men spike past Bruins in volleyball exhibition
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Revenge is always sweet, even
when it doesn't count.
The Stanford men's volleyball
team opened its season with a
little revenge, beating UCLA Sat
urday in an exhibition match
played in Fresno, Calif. The
Bruins beat Stanford in the
NCAA title match last May.
The match marked the start of
a new scoring system, which will
be used in all NCAA men's
matches this season. There is now
a scoring cap at 17 points, which
means that if the score goes to
16-16, the next team to score a
point wins the game.
The final game also is scored
differently, as a point is awarded
on every serve, whether the result
is a point or a side out. Thus, in
five-game matches, the fifth game
goes very quickly. With these new
rules in effect, Stanford beat the
Bruins 15-11, 7-15, 16-17, 16-14,
16-14.
"For the most part we were
pleased," Asst. Coach Ruben
Nieves said. "We did some things
well and there are some things
we need to work on."

20 kills and a .470 hitting per
centage and Craig Forsyth had 16
kills and a .480 percentage. Dun
can Blackman had 19 kills and
Dan Hanan and John Alstrom had
16 each as setter Parker Black
man ran a well-balanced offense.
Nieves also cited the play of
Ryan Moos, who came off the
bench to relieve Duncan Black
man and Alstrom. "Moos came in
a couple of times and really helped
us with his passing," Nieves said.
"I thought his passing really
steadied us out a couple times
when things were looking bad."
The defending national champs
were led by Trevor Schirman, last
year's NCAA Player of the Year.
Stanford does not begin its
season in earnest until January
when the team competes in a tour
nament. The Cardinal will play
four more exhibitions, all against
national-power Hawaii, later this
month. Stanford will travel to the
islands to face the Rainbows Nov.
