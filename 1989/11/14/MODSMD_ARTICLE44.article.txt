# Quake damage here worst among area schools
## UCSF, UC-Santa Cruz both facing repair bills in excess of $10 million 
### Amy Arends Staff writer 
Always known for its tendency
to be one step ahead of the pack,
Stanford significantly leads other
Bay Area colleges and universities
in its earthquake-related costs.
Stanford's earthquake damage
costs are estimated at $160 mil
lion, while other schools around
the Bay Area have much lower
figures.
Damage estimates range from
an insignificant amount at UC-
Berkeley to $17.1 million at UC-
San Francisco and $12 million at
UC-Santa Cruz, the university
closest to the quake.
Others schools, such as Cal
State Hayward, the College of San
Mateo and Menlo College, escaped
virtually unscathed.
UC-Santa Cruz, one of the
hardest hit schools besides Stan
ford, has preliminary reports of
about $12 million in damage, ac
cording to spokesman John

Burns.
Of Santa Cruz's damage esti
mate, $8 million will be used for
structural damage repairs around
the campus with most funds going
toward repair of a natural sciences
building.
"There is some question about
the natural sciences building's
structural integrity. We made
some temporary measures to
shore up horizontal columns and
place other vertical columns next
to the ones already standing just
to be safe," Burns said.
Of the remaining $4 million, $3
million will go toward replacement
of damaged or lost property and
$1 million will pay for clean-up.
"The campus has been in con
tact with the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the Cal
ifornia Office of Emergency Serv
ices and is submitting a damage
estimate. We have no real expec
tations as to how much compen
sation we'll receive," Burns said.
Corinna Kaarlela, public infor

mation officer at UC-San Fran
cisco, said the campus had "no
structural damage." How
ever, an estimated $17.1 million
will be needed for minor
earthquake-related damages and
clean-up costs.
The Moss Landing Marine Lab
oratory near Monterey, operated
by San Jose State University and
used by five other state univer
sities, has an estimated $11.4 mil
lion in damage to its facilities. Its
two buildings were "totaled," ac
cording to Dr. John Martin, di
rector of the laboratory.
The laboratory's buildings were
stretched because of liquefication,
which occurs when water mixes
with sand in the soil and results
in a volcano-like action as the mix
ture spews out of the earth.
"One went from 190 feet at 5:03
p.m. to 194 feet at 5:05 p.m.,"
Martin said, adding that the lab
oratory hopes to recover at least
75 percent of its costs from the
federal government.

The laboratory might not
rebuild in the same location due
to the liquefication threat.
"We have to go through a thor
ough soil analysis to find out the
risks. We would like to stay some
where in that vicinity," Martin
said. Classes are currently oper
ating out of San Jose State's
Salinas campus.
Stanford's Hopkins Marine Sta
tion, also near Monterey, suffered
"very minor problems," according
to Judy Thompson, station admin
istrator. "I don't think it hit us
like it hit other places," she said.
At San Francisco State Univer
sity, two buildings were affected
by the quake with repair costs
estimated at $5 million to $6 mil
lion, according to Janet Kraut,
associate director of public affairs.
The temporary closing of Ver
ducci Hall, a 15-story residential
building, due to broken water
lines, left 700 students displaced
for two weeks. Students have
since been allowed back in the
building, but they are currently
living without hot water.
In the school's six-story library
building, "stacks twisted, turned
and fell over and are in desparate
need of repair," Kraut said.
Funding for the repair, of the
buildings is being discussed by the
university's Board of Trustees.
"The university is looking into
applying for any and all aid that's
available," Kraut said.
At Mills College, the oldest
building on campus was closed
after it was deemed unsafe to
withstand another severe earth
quake, according to spokesperson
Vicki Bates. Mills Hall, built in
1870, housed administrative of
fices, which have been moved to

other buildings around campus.
According to Dave Johnson,
physical plant manager, renova
tion of the building is
recommended at an estimated cost
of $7 million.
"We are looking to see what's
available in terms of federal and
state aid as is every college and
university around the Bay Area,"
he said.
Foothill and DeAnza Colleges
suffered a combined damage total
of about $1 million, according to
Bob Mibach, associate director of
operations. The mtyor problem on
the DeAnza campus was in the
pool area.
"The wave action from the race
pool and diving pool cascaded into
the pool mechanical room and
flooded it," Mibach said.
''The main damage is to the
electrical circuit panels and large
horsepower motors that run the
circulation drives for the pools,"
he said.

At the Foothill campus, the
computer lab building suffered
structural damage. Mibach said
arrangements are already being
made to apply for federal and
state aid.
UC-Berkeley Civil Engineering
Prof. Phillip Fillipou called the
damage to the campus "insig
nificant" and said that it could
be taken care of through the reg
ular operating budget.
According to Marlon Villia, Uni
versity of San Francisco spokes
man, the private Jesuit
institution had "virtually no
damage."
Cal State Hayward, the College
of San Mateo and Menlo College
had similar responses.
College of San Mateo spokes
woman Georgie La√üerge said,
"The only thing our school will
be repairing is the cracked beam
in our library, which can be
repaired by our own staff."
