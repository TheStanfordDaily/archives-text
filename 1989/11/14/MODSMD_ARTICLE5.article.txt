# Decaf coffee linked to high cholesterol levels

Decaffeinated coffee raises
cholesterol levels significantly
while cafTeinated coffee does not,
Stanford scientists reported yes
terday at a New Orleans medical
conference.
According to the leader of the
study, Medicine Clinical Asst.
Prof. Robert Superko, medical di
rector of the Lipid Research
Clinic, the potential public health
implications of coffee and choles
terol are enormous.
"When you consider that 56
percent ; of the U.S. population
over age 10 consumes an average
of 3.4 cups of coffee per day, the
importance of understanding this
product and its relationship to the
number-one cause of death in this
country — heart disease — be
comes almost overwhelming," Su
perko said in a statement to the
Stanford News Service.
The study, which was reported
at a meeting of. the American
Heart Association, indicates that
Americans consume approxi
mately 139 billion cups of coffee,
20 percent of which are decaf
feinated.
"There have been previous
studies on the relationship be
tween coffee drinking and heart
disase," said project coordinator
Walter Bortz in an interview.
"However, the medical commu
nity to date is concentrating on
what effects caffeinated coffee has
on blood cholesterol levels," said
Bortz, of Boston University Med
ical School and previously of the
Stanford Center for Research and
Disease Prevention. "We are the
first to examine the effects of
decaffeinated coffee," he added.

Some 180 middle-age healthy
male coffee drinkers who volun
tarily changed their coffee con
sumption for four months entered
the trial. For the first two months,
they were given three, four, five
or six cups of coffee brewed in a
specific manner.
Their blood chemistry was then
tested and they were randomly
assigned to one of three groups:
continued regular caffeinated cof
fee, decaffeinated coffee or no cof
fee. Blood chemistry was again
tested at the end of two months.
The Stanford team showed that
the low-density lipoprotein, or
"bad" cholesterol, level of the
group that changed to the decaf
feinated coffee was 9 milligrams
per deciliter higher than the
groups that received either caf
feinated coffee or no coffee. Doc
tors recommend that patients
with cholesterol levels over 200
milligrams per deciliter modify
their diets.
The "bad" cholesterol level of
the group that continued to drink
caffeinated coffee actually
decreased slightly. An increase in
apolipoprotein-B, a molecule at
tached to low-density lipoproteins
that helps cells identify and use
the cholesterol was also discov
ered.
"The implications of these find
ings relate to the enormous im
pact coffee drinking has on West
ern society," the study stated.
"Cigarette smoking is associated
with the development of coronary
heart disease, but with nearly
three times as many coffee
drinkers as cigarette smokers in
America, individual increases in
risk from excessive coffee intake
could also have a measurable ef
fect on the total incidents of coro
nary heart disease."
The next step in research is to
find the chemical in coffee that
is responsible in this increase in
cholesterol level. A cup of coffee
is a complex chemical entity con
taining about 500 different chemi
cals, the study points out.
The Stanford study does not
look at whether caffeinated of
decaffeinated coffee is related to
cardiac arythmias, coronary ar
tery spasms or other factors that
could have implications for heart
disease. "The relationship of in
creased [chloesterol] level to heart
disease definitely warrants future
research," Bortz said.
