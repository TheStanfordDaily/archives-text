Police make fireworks arrest
A former Stanford student was arrested and
cited for launching bottle rockets early Sunday
morning outside a fraternity party.
A police officer approaching the Sigma Chi
house saw two people lighting bottle rockets in
front of the house. When the officer arrived on
the scene, one extinguished a rocket he had lit
and the other ran into the house to avoid the
officer, said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
Edward Silva, a former Sigma Chi resident
who graduated last spring, was arrested and re
leased on citation for possession of a variety of
fireworks and bottle rockets.
The officer came to the party because he saw
the bottle rockets exploding while he was driving
on his patrol. Police had been sent to the party
once before to respond to a noise complaint,
Niemeyer said.

Indecent exposure reported
The latest in a series of indecent exposure
incidents occurred early Thursday evening behind
the Environmental Safety Facility.
A woman walking behind the facility toward
Searsville Road was confronted by a man who
proceeded to urinate in front of her, according
to police reports.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer de
scribed the suspect as a white male, approxi
mately 20 years old with a close-cropped beard,
medium build, a tan jacket and blue jeans. He
was mounted on a 10-speed bicycle.
Niemeyer said the description fits that of a
suspect in several other indecent exposures on
campus and in Palo Alto.

Eggs jumping off buildings
The Stanford branch of the American Institute
of Aeronautics and Astronautics held its in
augural Egg Drop last week on — and off — the
balcony of the Durand building.
Eleven teams, mostly made up of Aeronautics

Department members and staff, constructed
aerodynamic egg carriers and entered the com
petition Friday.
This soon-to-be-traditional event was the
brainchild of institute president Brian Keller and
treasurer Sisir Kudva, both graduate students in
the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department.
Participants were required to purchase $5 egg
drop starter kits to build their flying machines.
The kits consisted of household materials such
string, paper clips, cotton balls and garbage bags,
and contestants were not allowed to use outside
materials other than tape and glue.
The contest was judged by four criteria: the
survival of the egg, the egg's time aloft, the
landing accuracy within a specified target and
the prediction of the egg's time aloft.
Most of the early runs saved the egg but missed
the target. One design that strove to combat this
accuracy problem was "The Rock," which con
sisted of the entire contents of the kit thrown
into a garbage bag.
Designers John Bourg and Yusuf Jafry said
that the time spent making The Rock was "less
than its flight time" and likened its hasty prep
aration to Congress' latest budget proposal.
The winner of the contest was John Wilson,
who was quickly accused of espionage by Jafry.
Wilson celebrated by tossing the "Glamorous
Glennis" on a victory flight.
