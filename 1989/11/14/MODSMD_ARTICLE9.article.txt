# Entering a male-dominated field
## Women find many obstacles on engineering path 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
While at high school in her
small Texas town, junior Alicia
Martinez remembered telling her
counselor that she wanted to be
an engineer. He told her to choose
another field, she recalled, be
cause "you're a girl and engineer
ing is for men."
Martinez, ignoring her coun
selor's advice, decided to pursue
an industrial engineering degree
at Stanford. However, like many
other women who made this de
cision, Martinez has encountered
several obstacles in her path.
Within the last 20 years, the
number of women pursuing engi
neering degrees has been increas
ing, but women continue to
compose the minority of en
gineers.
Stanford's current registration
statistics show that roughly 20
percent of the undergraduate and
17 percent of the graduate engi
neering msyors are women — fig
ures that are out of proportion to
the number of women on campus.
The combination of academic
and social pressures from this
overwhelmingly male field can
make many women feel out of
place.
"It's kind of strange to go into
a class and see that it's mostly
male," said Kate Deisseroth, a
sophomore in mechanical engi
neering. "I don't feel discrim
inated against, but I feel less com
fortable."

Because of this alienating at
mosphere, Deisseroth said she
"was definitely intimidated to
choose the m^jor."
Research at similar universities
shows that such intimidation of
women engineers is common, es
pecially during the critical fresh
man and sophomore years.
This is the time when "most
drop out, often for the wrong
reasons," said Andree Sursock, as
sistant director of the Advising
Center and the director of the
Women's Science and Engineering
Network, which sponsors a men
toring program.
Sursock began the program at
Stanford in 1984 to match fresh
man and sophomore women with
female engineering graduate stu
dents. The program aims to pro
vide strong women role models
for younger students, in hopes of
eliminating their intimidation and
discouragement.
"Women are respected by their
peers here at Stanford, but it is
still difficult to be a woman in a
male-dominated field," Sursock
said.
Last spring, for example, junior
Renee Danson wanted to do a
feminist studies honors project
and was told that she needed to
find a sponsor in her de
partment. However, her mqjor de
partment is electrical engineering,
which had no female professors
to sponsor her.
Hoping to become a positive ex
ample "as a feminist and a woman
who can do engineering," Danson

found her unsuccessful attempt
to complete an honors project
frustrating.
Although her male professors
make an effort to be inclusive to
women, Danson said she feels a
void because she has not yet had
an engineering class taught by a
female professor.
This lack of female role models
was "the biggest surprise to me,"
Danson said. She has somedmes
been the only woman in h'jr en
gineering sections, but she has
not caused a problem because "it's
actually kind of nice to be differ
ent."
"I tell people I'm an electrical
engineer and their mouths drop
open," said Lisa Richardson, a
senior. "As a woman you stand
out — whatever you do is noticed,
for good or for bad."
"I feel like I'm noticed because
I'm often the only woman in a
class," said Lisa Guerra, a senior
in electrical engineering. She said
she has received a lot of support
from her professors and her peers
at Stanford, but added, "If yOu
are an engineer and a woman,
you still have to work harder to
prove yourself."
Because of these concerns,
Stanford students began a chapter
of the nationwide Society of
Women Engineers in 1984. This
50-member group sponsors
speakers and activities of interest
to women and conducts a junior
high school outreach program to
tutor young women in the areas
of math and science.
