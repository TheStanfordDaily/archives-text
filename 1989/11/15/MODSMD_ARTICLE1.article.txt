# UCMI survey:
## Minority staffers troubled 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
The staff subcommittee of the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues released its report yes
terday, concluding that there are
"wide, systematic and deeply trou
bling" differences between the
way white and minority staff
members feel about their jobs.
The 30-page report is based on
an extensive poll taken last spring
of all black, Asian and Latino Uni
versity staff members, as well as
a representative portion of white
staff members.
Although the original UCMI
report was released last April,
that document focused on minor
ity issues relating to students, fac
ulty and curriculum. Staff issues
were only briefly addressed at the
end of the report, in expectation
of a more thorough analysis from
the staff subcommittee.
The committee, co-chaired by
Vice Provost Raymond Bacchetti
and Residential Affairs Director
Elizabeth Hiyama, began its
report with a generally positive
view of the workplace at Stanford,
determining that overwhelming
mgyorities of staff members of all
races consider the University "a
good place to work."
The report also cited progress
in the University since the release
of the original UCMI report in
April, such as the strengthening
of the University Affirmative Af
fairs Council and the formation
of the Filipino-American commu
nity at Stanford to represent
Filipino staff members.
Despite the progress, however,
there is "a general, institutional
distrust" among those who
responded to the survey. A
"lukewarm confidence" in Univer
sity commitment to affirmative
action is seen among the majority
of employees, with a significantly
more negative view from the black
staff members.
In response to the lengthy sur
vey, black staff members consis
tently found the University
inadequate in its attempts to
create a hospitable environment
for minority workers. White staff
members, however, consistently
rated the University higher,
whereas the views of Asians and
Hispanic workers were generally
somewhere in the middle.
The most striking differences
appear in the responses concern
ing the possibilities for advance

ment at Stanford. When asked
whether non-minorities have a
better chance of being promoted
within the University, almost 95
percent of blacks agreed with this
statement. Only a quarter of
whites agree.
The subcommittee proposed a
total of nine recommendations to
remedy the existing problems in
minority staff issues, adding to
the five recommendations for
staff that were forwarded in the
March report. "Acted upon with
energy and conviction, our recom
mendations can make a differ
ence," the report said.
The recommendations included:
• Developing "new ways to in
crease understanding about racial
and ethnic differences in the
workplace,"
• Giving the Affirmative Action
Council, which currently oversees
issues directly related to affirm
ative action, responsibility for
"the full range of minority staff
concerns,"
• Evaluating the normal expres
sion of workers' opinions to "en
sure open communications across
racial and ethnic lines,"
• Periodically publishing hiring
and promotion data related to
race and gender and
• Developing a process of griev
ance whereby staff members can
discuss problems with "higher
levels of management when local
solutions . . . cannot be found."
Staff members who responded
to the survey were separated into
three categories depending on the
level of their positions. Executive
and administrative staff made up
one group, while "clerical and of
fice support" jobs made up the
second category.
The third group, the mainte
nance, service employees and the
police, did not respond in suffi
cient numbers for them to be in
cluded in most of the report. Only
36 percent of these workers re
turned last spring's poll.
