# Women's Guide to Stanford revised, ready

### Kristin Farr 
The fifth edition of the Women's Guide to
Stanford — the first revision of the publica
tion since 1985 — is ready for distribution
today, after months of work by members of
the Women's Center Collective.
According to Teri Hopper, the Women's Cen
ter coordinator, the guide is a comprehensive
handbook "passing resources from woman to
woman" at Stanford. In an effort to cover all
aspects of student life, the guide lists specific
services and opportunities for women at Stan

ford and information on issues relevant to
student life.
The 1989 guide contains 80 pages and is
the largest edition ever. Revising the guide
turned out to be a "much larger project than
anyone had anticipated," according to Hopper.
The Women's Center members began their
work last spring quarter, under the direction
of faculty sponsor Margo Home, director of
the Innovative Academic Courses Department.
The guide, which will be distributed free at
the Women's Center, is a valuable resource

for new students and is directed towards
"freshmen, transfer and graduate students
who are unfamiliar with Stanford's resources,"
said Hopper. However, other Stanford women
are also welcome to a copy, provided they get
to the center in time.
The guide was funded primarily by the
Women's Center, with assistance from the
ASSU and department donations. Three thou
sand copies have been printed, but due to
what she calls the "enormous response and
great anticipation," Hopper expects a second
printing.
