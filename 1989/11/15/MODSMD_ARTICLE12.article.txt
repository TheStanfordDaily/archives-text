The bathroom intruder pre
viously sighted in Madera, Rin
conada, and Ujamaa houses left
his mark ill a Robinson house
bathroom early yesterday
morning.
Although nobody in the
house actually saw the in
truder, residents of the fourth
floor of Robinson noticed Tues
day morning that someone had
defecated on the floor and walls
of the women's restroom, ac
cording to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The mess in the bathroom
was reported to the resident
assistant, who notified the
police yesterday afternoon.
The police believe the in
truder visited the bathroom be

New Earth Sciences
building approved
The site and architectural
plans for the new Green Earth
Sciences Building were ap
proved with restrictions Thurs
day at a meeting of the County
of Santa Clara Architectural

and Site Approval Committee,
Stanford Facilities Project
Manager Kathy Jordan said.
The building, which will be
built on the north side of
Panama Street between Via
Crespi and Sequoia Lane, will
house new facilities for the
School of Earth Sciences.
Official approval for con
struction of the complex would
come if, after the customary
50-day appeal period, no
citizens had complained about
the building. However, Jordan
expects no opposition as there
was "no audience" at the
hearing.
Construction would then
start as early as May 1990, but
possibly not until November
1990, Jordan said. The building
would be completed approxi
mately 20 months later.
The building is part of the
Near West Campus Plan, ac
cording to Jordan.
The facilities will "upgrade
many of the present programs
of the School of Earth Sci
ences," Jordan said, and will
provide much-needed space for
the school.
"With the Geology Corner
out of commission (because of
the earthquake), Earth Sci
ences needs this building more
than ever," Jordan said.
