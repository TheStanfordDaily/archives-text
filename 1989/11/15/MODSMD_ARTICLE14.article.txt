# Pa. passes strict abortion law

### 
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -
The Senate approved a bill Tues
day making Pennsylvania's abor
tion laws the toughest in the na
tion, as the first state to take
advantage of greater authority al
lowed by the Supreme Court.
The bill, approved on a 33-17
vote and passed three weeks ago
by the House, goes to the House
leadership Wednesday for a formal
signature, then to Democratic
Gov. Robert P. Casey, who has
said he would sign it.
Pro-choice forces introduced
nine amendments in an attempt
to delay its passage and soften its
effects. But all the amendments
were defeated within five hours,
and the legislation was approved
about half an hour later.
"It's a big win, it's a big margin,
it's great," said Rep. Stephen
Freind, the Republican who
drafted the bill and guided it
through the House.
Pro-choice senators said the leg
islation would trample on wom
en's rights while setting the stage
for another court challenge to
abortion.
"It's a shame, a national dis
grace," said Sen. Vincent Fumo,
a Democrat. The bill would re
quire women to notify their hus
bands if they plan to get an abor
tion; prohibit abortions because
of the fetus' sex; ban abortions

after the 24th week of pregnancy,
except in cases where the mother
faces death or irreversible harm,
and establish a 24-hour waiting
period.
The proposal also would regu
late the medical use of tissue from
aborted fetuses. Doctors would be
required to inform a woman of
the likely age of the fetus before
performing an abortion and ex
plain the risks and alternatives.
The bill was approved just two
weeks after voters in New Jersey
and Virginia elected governors
who succeeded in winning their
races partly because of their pro
choice positions. Both candidates
made abortion a campaign issue.
Last month, an attempt by Flor
ida Gov. Bob Martinez to restrict
abortion fell flat when the Legisla
ture rejected a package of bills.
The Senate debate was
suspended less than half an hour
after it began when legislators
voted 26-24 to suspend rules and
allow amendments. Republican
and Democratic caucuses held
private meetings on the bill.
Debate resumed two hours lat
er. An amendment to make a tech
nical change and another to allow
some exceptions to a proposed ban
on abortions after the 24th week
of pregnancy were the first to be
defeated.
Other rejected amendments in

cluded proposals for a statewide
referendum on the bill, eliminat
ing a requirement that wives
notify husbands before ending a
pregnancy and revising the
waiting period so that women
living at least 50 miles from a
clinic would have to make only
one trip.
Had any of the amendments
passed, the legislation would have
been returned to the House, which
would have had to agree to any
changes.
At noon, the Capitol rotunda
was filled with more than 100
anti-abortion protesters who held
a prayer vigil and sang religious
songs. The vigil was organized by
members of a home for unwed
mothers.
The state chapter of the Na
tional Organization for Women
delivered petitions to the gover
nor's office with 50,000 signa
tures and hand-written letters op
posing further restrictions on
abortion.
In a July decision upholding a
Missouri law, the Supreme Court
gave states more leeway to restrict
abortions. If the Pennsylvania bill
is enacted, it would be first to
take advantage of that ruling by
setting tighter controls on abor
tion.
Opponents of the bill have de
scribed it as unconstitutional.
