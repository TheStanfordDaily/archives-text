# SWAPO wins in Namibia's elections, will draft constitution
## 
### 
WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) - The
black nationalist movement that fought
South African rule for 23 years won a
solid majority Tuesday in national elec
tions but will have to bargain with rival
parties in drafting a new constitution.
The leftist South-West Africa People's
Organization won 384,567 votes, or 57
percent of 670,830 ballots cast, according
to results announced Tuesday.
SWAPO's leaders had predicted their
movement would easily win the two
thirds mfyority that would have enabled
it to single-handedly write the constitu
tion.
The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a
multiracial coalition that favors a
capitalist economy, finished second with
191,532 votes, or 29 percent.
Thousands of SWAPO supporters filled
the streets of Windhoek, the capital,
waving flags, singing and honking horns
throughout the day. The celebration
carried on into the night in Katutura,

the main black neighborhood on the edge
of Windhoek.
In the northern town of Oshakati, more
than 20 people were hurt in a clash be
tween SWAPO and alliance supporters,
a doctor said. At least two were seriously
injured, one with a bullet wound, another
with a stab wound, said Dr. Kalumbi
Shangula of the Oshakati Hospital.
"We struggled all the years for this
day," said SWAPO President Sam
Nujoma.
South African President F.W. de Klerk
said his government was "grateful that
the election proceeded peacefully, and
thus accepts the outcome."
Namibians voted from Tuesday
through Saturday for a 72-member as
sembly that will draft a constitution and
declare independence for Namibia after
74 years of South African rule.
SWAPO will hold 41 seats in the as
sembly, and the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance 21.

The United Democratic Front will have
four seats, followed by the conservative,
all-white Action Christian National, with
three. The Federal Convention of
Namibia, National Patriotic Front and
the Namibia National Front each won a
single seat.
The assembly's decisions must be
backed by at least 48 members.
"In spite of the difficulties, in spite of
all the odds placed in our way to victory,
the liberation movement has won," said
senior SWAPO spokesman Hidipo
Hamutenya.
The election result was seen as promis
ing for a peaceful transition to indepen
dence for the sparsely populated region
of southern Africa.
Some observers feared that if SWAPO
won a two-thirds majority, it might have
written a constitution leaning heavily in
its favor.
Had the organization won less than 50
percent of the vote, it may have chal

lenged the results and accused South
Africa of trying to prevent a SWAPO
government.
The chairman of the Democratic
Turnhalle Alliance, Dirk Mudge, said his
organization had no plans to align itself
with another party, but "if SWAPO comes
with a (constitutional) proposal we can
live with, we will support it."
The assembly is to meet within a week,
and the 1,500 South African troops in
Namibia are to withdraw shortly. U.N.
peacekeepers are scheduled to leave
Namibia at the end of March.
The top U.N. official in Namibia,
Martti Ahtisaari, said he expected
Namibia to achieve independence before
then. Ahtisaari, who certified the election
results, said Namibia "has given the
whole world a shining lesson in democ
racy."
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said he was confident the various
parties would be able to work through

their differences and adopt a constitution
"with the same degree of enthusiasm and
patriotism that they displayed during the
course of the electoral process."
In addition to the U.N. monitors, doz
ens of private groups observed the elec
tions. Edmund Muskie, a former senator
and secretary of state who headed the
official U.S. delegation, said "the process
of the elections was victory by and for
the Namibian people."
In Washington, the State Department
said it wished the Namibian people well
as they start drafting the new constitu
tion.
In Brussels, a delegation of European
parliamentarians sent to observe the elec
tions said there had been no fraud.
South Africa captured Namibia from
Germany in World War I and ruled it
under a League of Nations mandate. That
mandate was rescinded by the United
Nations in 1966.

multiracial coalition that favors a
capitalist economy, finished second with
191,532 votes, or 29 percent.
Thousands of SWAPO supporters filled
the streets of Windhoek, the capital,
waving flags, singing and honking horns
throughout the day. The celebration
carried on into the night in Katutura,

the main black neighborhood on the edge
of Windhoek.
In the northern town of Oshakati, more
than 20 people were hurt in a clash be
tween SWAPO and alliance supporters,
a doctor said. At least two were seriously
injured, one with a bullet wound, another
with a stab wound, said Dr. Kalumbi
Shangula of the Oshakati Hospital.
"We struggled all the years for this
day," said SWAPO President Sam
Nujoma.
South African President F.W. de Klerk
said his government was "grateful that
the election proceeded peacefully, and
thus accepts the outcome."
Namibians voted from Tuesday
through Saturday for a 72-member as
sembly that will draft a constitution and
declare independence for Namibia after
74 years of South African rule.
SWAPO will hold 41 seats in the as
sembly, and the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance 21.

The United Democratic Front will have
four seats, followed by the conservative,
all-white Action Christian National, with
three. The Federal Convention of
Namibia, National Patriotic Front and
the Namibia National Front each won a
single seat.
The assembly's decisions must be
backed by at least 48 members.
"In spite of the difficulties, in spite of
all the odds placed in our way to victory,
the liberation movement has won," said
senior SWAPO spokesman Hidipo
Hamutenya.
The election result was seen as promis
ing for a peaceful transition to indepen
dence for the sparsely populated region
of southern Africa.
Some observers feared that if SWAPO
won a two-thirds majority, it might have
written a constitution leaning heavily in
its favor.
Had the organization won less than 50
percent of the vote, it may have chal

lenged the results and accused South
Africa of trying to prevent a SWAPO
government.
The chairman of the Democratic
Turnhalle Alliance, Dirk Mudge, said his
organization had no plans to align itself
with another party, but "if SWAPO comes
with a (constitutional) proposal we can
live with, we will support it."
The assembly is to meet within a week,
and the 1,500 South African troops in
Namibia are to withdraw shortly. U.N.
peacekeepers are scheduled to leave
Namibia at the end of March.
The top U.N. official in Namibia,
Martti Ahtisaari, said he expected
Namibia to achieve independence before
then. Ahtisaari, who certified the election
results, said Namibia "has given the
whole world a shining lesson in democ
racy."
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said he was confident the various
parties would be able to work through

their differences and adopt a constitution
"with the same degree of enthusiasm and
patriotism that they displayed during the
course of the electoral process."
In addition to the U.N. monitors, doz
ens of private groups observed the elec
tions. Edmund Muskie, a former senator
and secretary of state who headed the
official U.S. delegation, said "the process
of the elections was victory by and for
the Namibian people."
In Washington, the State Department
said it wished the Namibian people well
as they start drafting the new constitu
tion.
In Brussels, a delegation of European
parliamentarians sent to observe the elec
tions said there had been no fraud.
South Africa captured Namibia from
Germany in World War I and ruled it
under a League of Nations mandate. That
mandate was rescinded by the United
Nations in 1966.
