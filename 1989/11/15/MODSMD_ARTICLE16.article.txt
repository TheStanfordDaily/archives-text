# West offers East economic aid
## 
### 
BERLIN (AP) — West Germany
said Tuesday it was willing to give
East Germany massive financial
aid in the style of the postwar
U.S. Marshall Plan but demand
ed political and economic reforms
the Communists have so far
rejected.
East Germany's new premier
said the Berlin Wall must remain,
to keep AIDS, crime and other
Western problems out of his coun
try. He promised a coalition gov
ernment but did not say whether
the opposition could join it.
After a week of dramatic
developments in East European
countries, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev of the Soviet Union
said in Moscow:
"They have a common direc
tion, which fosters the building
of a European home, for it makes
the countries closer, more open
and creates new opportunities for
human contact and an equal ex
change."
The Liberal Democrats, an East
German party that is allied with
the Communists but shows signs
of independence, said pro
democracy groups should be in
vited in "round-table" talks about
East Germany's future.
Discussions this spring between
Polish authorities and Solidarity,
which were given that name, led
to a non-Communist government
in Poland.

Mayor Walter Momper of West
Berlin said the sudden opening of
East Germany's borders was cre
ating traffic jams, currency prob
lems and other economic difficul
ties the two governments must
resolve.
Economics Minister Helmut
Haussmann of West Germany an
nounced a six-point aid plan in
cluding investments, joint ven
tures and modernizing East Ger
many's dilapidated communica
tions and transport systems.
Haussmann did not name a fig
ure for the aid and said East Ger
many must achieve "thorough
change" in its centrally-directed
economy.
Reforms promised so far by
Communist Party leader Egon
Krenz, who took over last month
from hard-liner Erich Honecker,
have resulted in more questions
than answers, Haussmann said in
Bonn.
He compared his proposal to
the Marshall Plan devised by Sec
retary of State George C. Mar
shall, which provided more than
$12 billion in American aid in
1948-51 to help Europe recover
from the war.
East German authorities have
rejected the idea of adopting a
complete free-market system and
new Premier Hans Modrow, a
leading reformer, says he wants
"step by step" economic changes.

Modrow appears to want a
streamlining of the bureaucracy,
but he has given no indication he
will urge sweeping changes such
as those in Hungary and Poland.
He was quoted Tuesday in the
West Germany newspaper Bild as
saying the Berlin Wall will remain
open to travel but will not come
down.
"In our country there is little
criminal activity ... cases of AIDS
and drugs are virtually un
known," he was quoted as saying.
"Our people are asking them
selves why they shouldn't just
leave that as it is."
A leader of New Forum, East
Germany's main opposition
group, said it could work with a
revamped Communist Party but
naming Modrow premier was not
enough.
"There are still too many people
in top positions with whom
dialogue is not possible," Juergen
Tallig, spokesman for the group
in Leipzig.
More change could occur at a
special party congress in East Ber
lin on Dec. 15-17. The congress,
which can change the entire lead
ership, set policy and alter party
statutes, was called late Monday
by the party Central Committee.
Pro-democracy advocates have
held huge demonstrations de
manding an end for the 40-year
Communist monopoly on power.
