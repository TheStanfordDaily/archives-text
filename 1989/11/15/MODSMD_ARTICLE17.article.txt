Private plane for Speaker
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Depart
ment would be required to provide House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., with his own jet under
an amendment slipped into the defense appropri
ations bill without hearings, debate or notice to
members, it was learned Tuesday night.
Under the provision of the bill as it emerged
from a House-Senate conference committee, the
secretary of defense "shall make available" a
C-20 aircraft at Andrews Air Force Base in the
Maryland suburbs of Washington for the
speaker's use.
The $20 million aircraft, which can carry up
to 14 people, would come from the existing in
ventory of C-20s.
The amendment to the $288 billion bill was in
neither the original House bill nor the Senate
version. It was offered during conference com
mittee sessions by the chairman of the House
defense appropriations subcommittee, Rep. John
Murtha, D-Pa., said sources who declined to be
identified.
The bill is scheduled for House floor action
Wednesday.
The Defense Department, under what has been
described as a gentleman's agreement, has tradi
tionally furnished the speaker with a plane on
request.
U.N. predicts severe drought
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Drought-induced
crop failure in Ethiopia's two rebellious northern

provinces will be worse this season than in the
1984-85 famine that killed 1 million people, ac
cording to the U.N. Children's Fund.
An internal document from UNICEF obtained
Tuesday by The Associated Press says up to 2
million Ethiopians could be affected by the
drought as famine conditions develop in 1990.
In 1984-85, relief figures indicate 1 million
people starved to death in the northern provinces
of Tigre and Eritrea; in 1987-88, a massive in
ternational relief operation prevented a similar
tragedy during another crop failure.
UNICEF officials said they will soon announce
a $9.05 million fund-raising campaign to provide
food and services to northern Ethiopia to prevent
widespread starvation.
Czechoslovakia loosens travel
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) — Czechs won
a concession from their hard-line Communist
leadership Tuesday, with the government saying
they would no longer need exit visas to travel
to the West.
Premier Ladislav Adamec said his government
regards "tourism as the citizens' important right
to get to know the world, gain experience and
establish personal contacts."
His announcement came five days after neigh
boring East Germany threw open its borders to
allow citizens to travel freely to the West for the
first time in nearly three decades. Millions have
taken advantage of the new freedom.
Hungary and Poland, which have been at the
forefront of Last bloc reforms, also allow their
citizens to travel freely to the West.
