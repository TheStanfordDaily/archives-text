## An appeal for reason 
### 
TWO THINGS seem to be
lacking in the current dis
pute between Tresidder Un
ion management and the United
Stanford Workers: reason and
restraint.
For the last two weeks, manage
ment and labor have been haggling
over cuts in Tresidder's custodial
staff made necessary, so the man
agement says, by a $210,000
budget deficit.
The merits of that argument not
withstanding, the manner in which
both sides have gone about dis
cussing the issue is less than ad
mirable.
Tresidder director Bobbi Braden
and Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson, in a letter to The
Daily, asked that "an attitude of
reason prevail as we try to resolve
these issues." Such a call was
timely and appropriate.

But Braden and Robinson went
on to report two acts of vandalism
at Tresidder and note that such
incidents have also occured during
past disputes with the USW. The
clear implication, not supported by
any evidence, was that Tresidder
workers were responsible for the
vandalism.
The letter also claimed, again
without evidence, that Tresidder
staff "have been the targets of har
assment by USW officials and em
ployees."
USW representatives Linda
Crouse and Rodney Barnette
pointed the finger in yet another
direction when they blamed the
acts of vandalism on unknown per
sons in the community.
Amid the charges and counter
charges, the two sides have yet to
sit down for a calm discussion —
lasting more than 10 minutes.
