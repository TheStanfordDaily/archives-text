# Pro-choicers unite

### Patrick Rollins 
Riding a national wave of pro
choice sentiment, Stanford pro
choice supporters rallied yester
day in White Plaza before a vocal,
placard-waving crowd of about
400.
Council of Presidents member
Aimee Allison spoke at the rally,
throwing COP support behind the
pro-choice movement. The rally,
sponsored by the Stanford Pro-
Choice Alliance, featured live
music, poetry readings and
speeches by local supporters and
leaders of the pro-choice move
ment.
Yesterday's rally came on the
heels of a series of national pro
choice demonstrations Sunday, in
cluding one in Washington, D.C.
that involved about 300,000 ac
tivists. A spokesperson for Presi
dent Bush this week downplayed
the national rally and added that
the abortion issue will not be a
deciding factor in next year's elec
tions.
At yesterday's rally, Allison
stated, "The COP is committed

to doing anything we can to help
the Pro-Choice Alliance and their
efforts to preserve a woman's
right to choose." She defended the
decision to throw the COP's hat
into the national political ring
rather than to focus upon campus
politics, saying that "when an
issue affects the lives of so many
women, student government
leaders cannot sit idly by"
"If we truly represent the
majority, we must take a stand.
We at the COP are committed to
doing this," she added.
Diana Workman of Family
Planning Alternatives, a clinic in
Sunnyvale that has been targeted
by the anti-abortion group Oper
ation Rescue, recalled the damag
ing effects of last summer's Su
preme Court decision in the
Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services. She asserted,
"Reproductive rights have taken
such a beating this last year that
it makes it impossible for [pro
choice activists] to relax."
She dubbed the Webster deci

Seniors Kara Radwallader, Gigi Hull and Michelle Bookstein take a stand on what many feel will be the
most critical issue of the decade during yesterday's pro-choice rally in White Plaza.
