# Pro-choicers unite

### Patrick Rollins 
Riding a national wave of pro
choice sentiment, Stanford pro
choice supporters rallied yester
day in White Plaza before a vocal,
placard-waving crowd of about
400.
Council of Presidents member
Aimee Allison spoke at the rally,
throwing COP support behind the
pro-choice movement. The rally,
sponsored by the Stanford Pro-
Choice Alliance, featured live
music, poetry readings and
speeches by local supporters and
leaders of the pro-choice move
ment.
Yesterday's rally came on the
heels of a series of national pro
choice demonstrations Sunday, in
cluding one in Washington, D.C.
that involved about 300,000 ac
tivists. A spokesperson for Presi
dent Bush this week downplayed
the national rally and added that
the abortion issue will not be a
deciding factor in next year's elec
tions.
At yesterday's rally, Allison
stated, "The COP is committed

to doing anything we can to help
the Pro-Choice Alliance and their
efforts to preserve a woman's
right to choose." She defended the
decision to throw the COP's hat
into the national political ring
rather than to focus upon campus
politics, saying that "when an
issue affects the lives of so many
women, student government
leaders cannot sit idly by"
"If we truly represent the
majority, we must take a stand.
We at the COP are committed to
doing this," she added.
Diana Workman of Family
Planning Alternatives, a clinic in
Sunnyvale that has been targeted
by the anti-abortion group Oper
ation Rescue, recalled the damag
ing effects of last summer's Su
preme Court decision in the
Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services. She asserted,
"Reproductive rights have taken
such a beating this last year that
it makes it impossible for [pro
choice activists] to relax."
She dubbed the Webster deci

most critical issue of the decade during yesterday's pro-choice rally in White Plaza.
sion a "loss of liberty unlike any
we have seen in recent times" and
blamed it on "the fundamentalist
ideology of the presidential admin
istration."
Workman challenged "wishy
washy" politicians to take a stand
on the abortion issue, saying that
"you either support every wom
an's right to choose, or you don't.
And if you don't, you have lost
another vote. Period!"
Workman's advice to pro-choice
supporters is to "be outraged, be
passionate, but above all, be un

compromising" in backing abor
tion rights.
Sophomore Sherifa Edoga, a
member of the Stanford Pro-
Choice Alliance, delivered a stir
ring speech voicing the sentiment
of the poor and minority women
of America who "did and will suf
fer the most" from anti-abortion
legislation. She said "pregnancy
becomes punishment" when the
powers that be "force women to
have children they cannot support
and which have very little chance
of being adopted."
Susan Kennedy of the Northern
California Abortion Rights Action
League attributed last week's
Democratic victories in the New
York City, New Jersey and Vir

ginia elections to the fact that the
winning candidates were pro
choice. "[The victories] happened
because pro-choice Americans
have woken up," she said, adding
that "we are not willing to slip
back to the time when we threat
ened the lives of our sisters, our
mothers, our daughters and our
friends."
Kennedy's speech was inter
rupted briefly by a man in the
crowd who yelled, "We're trying
to stop the holocaust!"
Elizabeth Wahl, director of the
Pro-Choice Alliance and a gradu
ate student in comparative litera
ture, said she was "ecstatic" after
the rally. "It's always wonderful
when people come out and re

spond so emotionally," she added.
The Stanford Pro-Choice Alliance,
which has been active here for
nearly a year, solicited donations
during the rally.
Branner Hall Resident Assis
tant David Hornik, whose mother
and sister attended Sunday's rally
in Washington, was happy to at
tend the Stanford rally. "It's the
least I could do to further the
pro-choice movement," said Hor
nik, a senior.
Junior Shairi Turner, a mem
ber of Delta Sigma Theta sorority,
praised the speakers and called
the pro-choice movement "a uni
fying issue for men and women
no matter what race, no matter
where you're from."
