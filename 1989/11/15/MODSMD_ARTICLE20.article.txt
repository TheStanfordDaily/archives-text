Students should be able
to use their dorm bathroom
without fear of harassment by
an outside intruder.
Lately, this has not been the
case.
Oct. 31: An unidentifed male
scattered shaving cream around
the Madera House women's bath
room, defecated on the bathroom
floor and watched a woman taking
a shower.
Nov. 3: An unidentified person
defecated on the floor of the wom
en's bathroom in Ujamaa House.
Later, two residents noticed that
someone appeared to be lying
asleep in a bathroom stall with his
feet sticking out.
Nov. 7: An unidentified naked
male appeared in the common area
of the first-floor coed bathroom in
Rinconada House.
Police are investigating these in
cidents and believe the same

suspect may be responsible for all
three.
Regardless of whether the same
individual is responsible in these
cases, though, his actions and
similar actions that occur but go
unreported could be prevented.
The solution is quite simple: in
stall locks on the main doors of
dorm bathrooms. That way, access
would be restricted to residents
who would use their room key to
enter.
The extra hassle of needing a
room key to get into the bathroom
would be well worth the resulting
sifety precaution.
Cost should not be an issue.
Locks on some dorm study rooms
and laundry rooms are already
keyed in this fashion. Surely if we
can afford to protect our study
rooms and our laundry, we can
afford to protect ourselves from
unwanted intruders.
