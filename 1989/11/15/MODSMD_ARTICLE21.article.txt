Fraternities do not monopolize University housing

WHILE WE CERTAINLY hope
the co-ops damaged in the
earthquake are reopened, Kent
Eaton's solution (in a Monday letter to
The Daily) putting co-ops in fraternity
houses seems inappropriate.
Although most fraternities are owned
by the University, our houses were
built by our alumni for the stated
purpose of fraternal housing; to remove
fraternities from their houses through
no fault of their own represents a
miscarriage of the trust placed by our
alumni in the University to provide
fraternal housing.
Eaton asserts that fraternities do not
"have the right to monopolize Univer

sity housing to the exclusion of other
groups ... more in line with the stated
goals of the University such as diver
sity and equality of access."
First, the 10 housed fraternities
hardly monopolize the University
housing system of over 80 houses.
Furthermore, it seems the Universi
ty's goal of diversity in housing is
centered on diversity within the sys
tem. Fraternities ofTer a viable housing
alternative, just as co-ops, self-ops and
theme houses do.
Finally, Roth House is not open to
men, Branner Hall is not open to
upperclassmen and Rains Apartments is
not open to undergraduates, regardless

Roth House is not open to
men ... and Rains Apart
ments are not open to un
dergraduates, regardless
of Draw number.

of Draw number.
How then can Eaton assert that
"every other non-fraternal form of
housing on campus (is) based on the
luck of the draw alone?" Is this "e
-quality of access?"

We have earned the privilege of
self-selection through the construction
of our houses by our alumni. Had
Synergy (Eaton's residence) built their
house through their alumni, then they
too could determine its residents. This
distinction cannot be overlooked.
We are all saddened by the closing of
the seven Row houses; however, it is
unfair to remove a fraternity from its
house to compensate for their tragedy.
Instead, we join your plea to the
University to rebuild the co-ops and
once again provide the students with a
broad diversity of housing options.
