# Students have chance to chew the fat with Food Service
## 
### 
Over the past years there has been a
considerable amount of comments and
complaints regarding University Food
Service.
In the past few weeks, the topic has
been addressed directly not only in The
Daily but also in several meetings be
tween the Nutrition Advisory Commit
tee and Food Service.
The Nutrition Advisory Committee is
a committee within the Health Promo
tion Program Advisory Board composed
of students and staff interested in in
creasing nutritional knowledge and
awareness in the Stanford community.
There is a particular interest in
changing various aspects of Food Serv
ice; however, there seems to be some
difficulty in starting the reformation.
As students, we rant and rave about
Food Service, but we never really do
anything except maybe contribute a
complaint to the suggestion box in the

dining room.
How can we really do anything with
out knowing exactly what Food Service
does? A whole array of mysteries en
velops Food Service: where our money
goes, where the food comes from, what
is in the food, how healthy the meals
are, etc.
Finally, we have a chance to get
answers about Food Service directly
from them. We can discover what
makes change so slow and difficult.
On Thursday, Nov. 16, there will be
a meeting with Food Service. Every
student will be able to learn about
Food Service and, more importantly, to
express any thought about Food Serv
ice.
Everyone is invited to the meeting
at 4 p.m. at the Food Service office
(take Campus Drive, turn right on
Serra Street and then left on Pampas
Lane).
We now have an opportunity to give
direct feedback. Come express your
opinion and share your concerns about
the meals and nutrition education Food
Service has to offer.
In order to see changes we must
make ourselves heard. Food Service

has to see the demand for change and
improvement coming from the students,
their consumers.
