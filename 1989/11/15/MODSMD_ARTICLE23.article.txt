# Columnist makes unfounded accusations against Tresidder
## 
### 
In her Monday column, Cheryl
Taylor brought up an important point
about the situation between Tresidder
Union and the United Stanford
Workers. Tresidder directors implicated
USW workers in recent vandalism,
even though there is "no evidence to
prove" it.
Apparently, they have also accused a
USW field representative of harassing
a female employee. If the Tresidder
officials are wrong, then these are
indeed shameless allegations.
What bothers me is how Taylor dem

onstrates her own hypocrisy by turning
around and launching a crusade of
unsupported charges against Tresidder.
She asserts that this "is a very con
venient attempt to quiet those who
dare to question . . . the status quo,"
and goes on to ask, "When will this
madness end?"
Well, it will end as soon as people
stop fomenting unfounded accusations.
Is Taylor in the know about whether
or not the female employee was
harassed? If not, she shouldn't try to
draw conclusions from the case.
Admittedly, I've learned to expect
this caliber of factless writing from
Daily columnists, but it sure would be
nice to see more responsible jour
nalism.
