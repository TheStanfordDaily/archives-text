## Melting popsicle dreams 
### 
IN THE MOVIE "Blue Velvet," shown
a few weeks ago in Cubberley Audi
torium, there is a scene where a
woman breathlessly describes a dream
she had in which robins, symbolizing love,
suddenly flew down from the sky.
A man listens to her, spellbound, and
then says, "You're a neat girl." She
smiles, blushes and responds, "You're a
neat guy."
The Stanford audience cracked up at
this exchange and at several other
melodramatic moments in the film.
As I was leaving Cubberley after the
movie, I overheard a man mutter to his
friend, "That has to be the most cynical
crowd I've ever seen."
He's probably right. Stanford has a
way of doing that to people, making them
a little more skeptical and sarcastic about
lofty ideas and sentiments. I should know
â€” it happened to me.
Not that 1 entered this venerable in
stitution as an idealistic hayseed only to
have my idyllic illusions about the world
cruelly crushed by the college experience.
I had realized by the time I graduated
from high school that the world is not a
perfect place.
But 1 hadn't realized quite how imper
fect it is until I arrived here. I started
taking real classes, not like my high
school courses that explained how a bill
becomes a law, but classes that explored
the motivations behind introducing cer
tain bills and the impacts of certain laws.
I took Political Science 1 and discovered
that pluralistic politics might be just a
farce and that the United States entered
Vietnam partly for economic reasons. I

took Political Science 10 and learned
about the incredible inequities in distri
bution of wealth and about how our gov
ernment institutions help perpetuate
those inequalities.
By the end of freshman year, I had
been exposed to the ideas that the Con
stitution was an elitist document, that
our current government does not repre
sent all the people, and that in the United
States, power is only accessible through
money. Not too bad for only 30 weeks
of instruction and a small fee of $20,000.
My hypercritical view of American gov
ernment has mellowed somewhat as those
classes recede further and further into
the past, but new targets for my cynicism
keep springing up.
Now I'm taking Communication 1,
where I learn that one of the media's
primary motivations is money and that
lowering the taste content of the media
is necessary to reach a diverse audience.
I'm taking a sociology class where I
learn that people subconsciously expect
women and minorities to perform worse
than men or white people on any given
task, and that males and whites auto
matically take over dominant positions
in testing situations.
I know some people would see this
process of gradual disillusionment as un
desirable. And some on this campus
would probably say I was the victim of
a totalitarian indoctrination campaign by
the left-wing faculty that is slowly suck
ing all the academic merit out of the
Stanford curriculum.
But I see my growing skepticism as a
necessary part of becoming an educated

and responsible person. While it might
be nice to hold on to popsicle dreams
about the infallibilty of American insti
tutions and society, it removes one from
the realm of reality.
While tarnishing long-standing ideals
might be a little depressing, acknowledg
ing the social system's imperfections is
the first step toward improving them.
And I think a lot of what is wrong in
the United States today can be improved.
My experiences at Stanford haven't trans
formed me into a bitter and frustrated
person with no hope for positive changes
in society. I'll probably have to wait until
I enter the "real world" for that to hap
pen.
