## White students' reaction to 'America' flier a sign of ignorance 
### 
I BELIEVE it is important for
artists, especially black artists, to
talk about and define their own
work, lest someone incorrectly does it
for them.
Therefore, I am writing to clarify
some of the issues surrounding my
performance, "America: Countdown To
Liberation."
First of all, I do not apologize for
the flier. The flier and the display in
White Plaza were part of the perform
ance.
The flier is an "advertisement" for a
fictitious corporation called America
which produces robotic Negroids. It is
modeled after a slave auction handbill
from 1833 which advertised the
"Public Sale of Negroes."
I believe that history is circular, nnd
the flier and the performance express
my fear and uncertainty for the future
of black people in this country.
Although the actual sale of blacks is
illegal, we are still slaves to the Ameri
can educational and judicial system.
The case of Louis Jackson is a perfect

example.
The "sale of Negroids" is a metaphor
for the brutal and racist murders of
black people across the country, of
which the Howard Beach and Benson
hurst incidents are but a few. It is also
a metaphor for the wrongful imprison
ment of black people.
Finally, the "sale of Negroids" is a
metaphor for the miseducation of black
people which is perpetrated by the
American media and educational sys
tem.
As a result, black people grow up
not knowing the African origins of
humanity, or the real inventor of the
telephone or that the FBI was not the
hero of the civil rights movement.
I believe that how a people see their
history determines how they view
themselves and their place in society.
So as long as America continues to
reinvent black history, black people will
remain an enslaved people.
So the flier was meant to be brutal
and shocking. Racism is brutal and
shocking, and so is the reality of black

people's existence in America.
However, the flier did include a
disclaimer, which clearly indicated that
it was for an artistic performance.
Apparently most people failed to read
it.
Perhaps I should have included the
words "this is not real" on the flier,
but I don't think that would have
done any good.
Obviously, the flier hit too close to
home for many people, especially white
students, as most of the negative reac
tion about the flier has come from
white students and not black students.
I'd like to compare the reaction to
my flier to the Beethoven flier which
appeared in Ujamaa House last year.
After the incident, most white students
could not understand why black stu
dents were so offended and upset.
Furthermore, many saw the Beetho
ven flier as an expression of the stu
dents' free speech, protected by both
the First Amendment and the Funda
mental Standard.
The two students were given a pat

on the wrist by the University and a
pat on the back by many other stu
dents.
In the case of the"America" flier,
many white students have expressed
anger, while most of the black students
have complimented me on such a
provocative flier.
Because white students felt attacked,
many want to censor the flier, thereby
limiting my free speech. Is free speech
a right reserved only for whites?
Futhermore, where were all these
outraged people during the Ujamaa
incident?
I do not, however, want to get
caught up in a free speech debate. The
fundamental issue is this: The reaction
on the part of the white students is
indicative of the lack of education and
understanding that whites have of
black history and black culture.
I think the"America" flier is
analogous to instances where blacks
call each other "nigger." Blacks have
appropriated this word, and it has now
become an in-group term. This situa-

tion i9 not racist because blacks are
not using it as an oppressive tool.
Many white students may then ask,
"Why can't I do it too?" The reason is
that when a white person calls a black
person "nigger," it places the situation
in a different context because whites
have historically used "nigger" and
other such terms to socially, economi
cally and culturally oppress black
people.
For similar reasons, I do not think
the"America" fliers are racist. I have
appropriated these caricatures to depict
the racism of yesterday and today. As
a black person, I am not using these
cariacatures to oppress anyone, cer
tainly not my own people.
So until white students understand
the history of black people and racial
prejudice against blacks in this coun
try, they cannot begin to understand
the"America" flier.
