# Stanford plays central role in Chinese student movement
## 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second
article in a four-part series on the
Chinese student movement at
Stanford. Several of those inter
viewed withheld their names
because of concerns for family
members remaining in China.

The Chinese government
declared Stanford a "disaster
area" long before last month's
earthquake. The state-run Xin
hua News Agency singled out
Stanford and the Boston area as
the two regions in the United
States where the Chinese student

movement had been, in the eyes
of the Chinese government, the
most dangerous.

The Stanford movement gained
visibility through successful
fundraising, an ability to mobilize
effectively and intimate ties with
what the Chinese government has
labeled "counterrevolutionary"
organizations.
After breaking with the Chinese

government and its consular rep
resentatives following the June 4
massacre in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square, Chinese students in the
United States found themselves
without an organization to repre
sent their own interests.
The need for an organization
to protect students in the United
States, and the desire for effective
coordination among universities,
led to the formation of the Inde
pendent Federation of Chinese
Students and Scholars in late July.
Like many other interactions
between Chinese students in the
United States, the founding con
ference of the federation was
planned through the electronic

mail network. It was on China Net
that draft constitutions were cir
culated and individual univer
sities voted on a conference
location and preparatory commit
tee members.
Graduate student Dai Jiangang,
the founder and Stanford coordi
nator of China Net, was elected to
serve on the steering committee
and traveled to Chicago to prepare
for the July conference.
Altogether, delegates from
more than 200 schools attended
the founding meeting of the fed
eration. For Dai, "it was terribly
exciting. The conference was the
first experience most of us had
had of a totally democratic organ

ization.'
Stanford and Stanford students
continued to play a central role at
the conference, where graduate
student Liu Yongchuan was cho
sen to head the newly founded
student union. Liu was a partici
pant in the spring demonstrations
in Tiananmen Square and was the
first student to fly the banner of
overseas support in the square.
Pressure from the consulate
The Chinese government's re
sponse to the students' declara
tion of independence has been to
condemn it as "counterrevolution
ary" in repeated editorials in The
People's Daily. Consulates

throughout the United States
have put pressure on Chinese stu
dents not to participate in the fed
eration's activities, especially
protests led by the federation on
China's National Day, Oct. 1.
"One of our biggest challenges,"
says Liu, "is the embassy's at
tempt to revitalize the old na
tional student union (under more
obedient leadership), but it has
very little chance of succeeding.
Already, its first two presidents
have resigned."
According to Liu, the federation
seeks to faithfully adhere to the
wishes of the majority of the

-40,000 Chinese students in the
United States. "Among our stu
dents there is a high level of un
derstanding of the democratic
rule of the meyority.
"We are trying to get as many
members as possible, so we cannot
be very radical. We are not a po
litical party. Most of the students
here want to return to their coun
try to help. They feel more com
fortable joining a union than a
political party," Liu says.
For students looking for a more
political organization there is the
Paris-based Front for Democracy
in China, led by prominent Chi
nese exiles Yan Jiaqi, Wuer Kaixi
and Wan Runnan. Here too, Stan
ford plays an important role.
Even before the front was for
mally established in early Septem
ber, Stanford students were
involved in the effort to get dis
sidents on the most-wanted list
out of China. In August, the As
sociation of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford co-sponsored
a visit by Yan, Wuer and Wan to
the Bay Area.
Conference in Paris
Five Stanford students and
scholars attended the September
conference organizing the front —
more than from any other Amer
ican university. The Stanford rep
resentatives were joined by David
Ai, a project manager at Hewlett-
Packard who has worked closely
with the association. Ai and grad
uate student Xu Sike were elected
to the organization's six-member
North American board of direc
tors.
Since membership of the Front
for Democracy in China is over
whelmingly concentrated in the
Bay Area, the organization set up
its second American branch in a

meeting Saturday at the Physics
Tank.
The front's membership is
broader than that of the Federa
tion of Chinese Students and
Scholars and 3eeks to unify all
groups interested in democratic
change in China.
According to Ai, "It was prob
ably the first time all the different
factions — students, scholars and
Communist Party members from
China, Chinese from Hong Kong
and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese
like myself — sat down in one
room to talk about the future of
China."
Ai and two of the Stanford at
tendees are from Taiwan, and all
three cite their feeling of common
ancestry and culture as reasons
for their participation in the
movement. "We still feel that we
are part of China," says graduate
student Bao Yichin.
Graduate student Tu Shih
liang, another Paris conference at
tendee, says,"the long-term
well-being of people from Taiwan
inevitably has to do with demo
cratic conditions in China. The
more democratic China is, the bet
ter off we all are."
Although the potential for fac
tionalism among such a diverse
membership is large, participants
in the Paris conference feel that
they were able transcend conflicts.
Ai remembers the conference as
"being very truthful to democratic
"procedures. No one group felt out
powered, and everything was out
in the open."
Both Ai and Bao see the feder
ation's future role as providing a
democratic blueprint for change
in China. Pointing to the central
role of students abroad, Ai says,
"the elite group who were brave
enough to stand up are now out
side of China."
Debating China's future
Stanford students have also
been active in setting up an in

tellectual foundation for sus
tained debate about the economic,
political and social future of
China. The first in a series of
federation-sponsored conferences
on the future of change in China
was held here in September.
The conference organizers' de
cision to close the proceedings to
the press generated significant
media controversy and accusa
tions that it was being un
democratic. However, students
say the decision was a response
to requests from participants who
had recently fled China and feared
retaliation against colleagues still
inside China.
Among the participants at the
conference was Hu Ping, head of
the Chinese Alliance for Democ
racy, an opposition group that has
been based in New York since the
early '80s and is one of the fa
vorite targets of Chinese
governmental wrath.
Students at Stanford point to
Hu's inclusion as evidence of their
continuing attempts to develop
standards of judgment indepen
dent of the Communist Party. "We
are building up our own consen
sus and our own criteria through
the process of getting to know
each other — we no longer have
to accept the government's judg
ments," says Zhou Xueguang.
The $20,000 conference was a
mtgor expense, but fundraising ef
forts had outstripped their modest
beginnings, enabling the Associa
tion of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford to co-sponsor
the event. So far, the association
and the June Fourth Foundation,
a non-profit organization de
signed to help victims of the mas
sacre and support pro-democracy
educational efforts, have raised
$180,000 — more than any other
university in the nation.
June Fourth Foundation direc
tor Douglas Pan attributes this
success to Stanford's proximity to
Silicon Valley and its "engineers

from Hong Kong and Taiwan who
have the means to contribute."
In accordance with an associa
tion policy, 75 percent of funds
donated — unless otherwise ear
marked — go to aiding victims
and their families, while the
remaining 25 percent is used to
sponsor pro-democracy educa
tional activities.
The persistence of memory
One of the most important ed
ucational efforts is making sure
that the rest of the world will not
simply forget the Tiananmen
Square massacre. Chinese stu
dents say they are angered by
what they see as American moves
to normalize relations with the
government in Beijing.
"I think it's just too soon. The
message it sends to the govern
ment is that the United States
does not feel too bad about the
massacre," says Xu Guanghan.
"As a result, the government
thinks it can go ahead and do
whatever it wants."
Chinese students say they want
the United States to continue
pressuring Beijing. "The United
States should not put financial
reasons in front of moral issues,"
says one engineering graduate
student. "It should make the Chi
nese government feel like it have
done the wrong thing and should
pay for it."
Another graduate student says,
"If killing one student causes the
government to lose $100 million,
will think twice before it kills the
second. But if you give them
money as usual they don't feel
any pressure to change."
According to Ai, "Right now it
is a war of information. The Chi
nese government is mounting a
major propaganda campaign and
we have every reason to believe
it is effective to a certain extent.
We want everyone to become more
knowledgeable about the situation
in China."

Reflecting on Stanford's rise to
national and international
prominence, still another gradu
ate student says the "extent of
activism at Stanford came as a
surprise to the Chinese govern
ment. Stanford students have al
ways been quite different from the
more politically active students on
the East Coast. Usually they are
very conservative, but this time
they are very active."
Speaking with one voice
Almost all Chinese students cite
the quality of their leadership as

a major reason for Stanford's un
expected prominence. One gradu
ate student contrasted the
movement here with the one at
UC-Berkeley that fragmented into
three competing groups. "Stan
ford speaks and acts with one
voice. People here are not con
cerned with getting power for
themselves."
Zhou Xueguang thinks that the
association's previous role as an
organizer of social functions
helped unite the students before
the crisis. Other students point to
the fact that most of the Chinese
students live together in the Rains
Apartments and Escondido Vil
lage.
But, ultimately, it was the shock
of the June 4 massacre in Tianan
men Square that brought people
together to act. In Zhou's words,
"it was out of our wildest im
agination, and it reminded us that
we have something in common —
we share the same ideals and
moral standards."
Xu Guanghan, like many
others, became involved in the
wake of the repression. "If 1 was
in China I wouldn't say anything,
but when I saw the students, I
was very touched and moved.
They were so very young. ... Now
I think I should also sacrifice
something, because if I can't do
that, China is hopeless."
