# Stanford plays central role in Chinese student movement
## 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second
article in a four-part series on the
Chinese student movement at
Stanford. Several of those inter
viewed withheld their names
because of concerns for family
members remaining in China.

The Chinese government
declared Stanford a "disaster
area" long before last month's
earthquake. The state-run Xin
hua News Agency singled out
Stanford and the Boston area as
the two regions in the United
States where the Chinese student

movement had been, in the eyes
of the Chinese government, the
most dangerous.

The Stanford movement gained
visibility through successful
fundraising, an ability to mobilize
effectively and intimate ties with
what the Chinese government has
labeled "counterrevolutionary"
organizations.
After breaking with the Chinese

government and its consular rep
resentatives following the June 4
massacre in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square, Chinese students in the
United States found themselves
without an organization to repre
sent their own interests.
The need for an organization
to protect students in the United
States, and the desire for effective
coordination among universities,
led to the formation of the Inde
pendent Federation of Chinese
Students and Scholars in late July.
Like many other interactions
between Chinese students in the
United States, the founding con
ference of the federation was
planned through the electronic

mail network. It was on China Net
that draft constitutions were cir
culated and individual univer
sities voted on a conference
location and preparatory commit
tee members.
Graduate student Dai Jiangang,
the founder and Stanford coordi
nator of China Net, was elected to
serve on the steering committee
and traveled to Chicago to prepare
for the July conference.
Altogether, delegates from
more than 200 schools attended
the founding meeting of the fed
eration. For Dai, "it was terribly
exciting. The conference was the
first experience most of us had
had of a totally democratic organ

ization.'
Stanford and Stanford students
continued to play a central role at
the conference, where graduate
student Liu Yongchuan was cho
sen to head the newly founded
student union. Liu was a partici
pant in the spring demonstrations
in Tiananmen Square and was the
first student to fly the banner of
overseas support in the square.
Pressure from the consulate
The Chinese government's re
sponse to the students' declara
tion of independence has been to
condemn it as "counterrevolution
ary" in repeated editorials in The
People's Daily. Consulates

throughout the United States
have put pressure on Chinese stu
dents not to participate in the fed
eration's activities, especially
protests led by the federation on
China's National Day, Oct. 1.
"One of our biggest challenges,"
says Liu, "is the embassy's at
tempt to revitalize the old na
tional student union (under more
obedient leadership), but it has
very little chance of succeeding.
Already, its first two presidents
have resigned."
According to Liu, the federation
seeks to faithfully adhere to the
wishes of the majority of the
