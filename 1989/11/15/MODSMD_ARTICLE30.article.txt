Just a few suggestions on how to snooze

The middle of the quarter
has rolled around, and students
and professors are becoming
short of sleep as they study
and grade exams. The Stanford
Sleep Disorders Clinic has
seven suggestions to help
people get to sleep, says direc
tor German Nino-Murcia:
1. Keep to a regular schedule.
Going to bed and getting up at
the same time each day helps
establish a healthy pattern.
The same advice applies to
naps. If you take one or more
each day, fine, but do it regu
larly. Changing the napping
pattern can affect the
nighttime sleep pattern.
2. Exercise regularly. It will
help you sleep. But don't ex
ercise just before bedtime. It
can overstimulate you and
delay sleep.

3. Stay away from caffeine
after about 4 p.m. It will keep
you awake not only through
the evening, but into your reg
ular sleep time as well.
4. Avoid alcohol after dinner.
Liquor-induced sleep is not as
restful as undrugged natural
sleep. Also, when the alcohol
wears off, you are likely to
awake suddenly.
5. Sleeping pills are at best
a temporary solution. Medica
tion can be habit forming and
will eventually lose its effective
ness unless you keep increasing
dosage. Be careful, and use
medication for no longer than
four weeks.
6. Keep room temperature
consistent. Hot one night, cold
the next or any other notice
able variations, interfere with

One personal account on animal research

Three years ago, Elizabeth
Dement ran into the street to
rescue a dog, a doberman that
her dad, pioneer sleep re
searcher William Dement, had
brought home from one of his
research studies. In the street,
Elizabeth was hit by a car and
suffered a severe head injury
as a result.
Elizabeth, now 29, is making
progress, but her ability to
speak is only slowly returning.
Her chances of returning to a
productive life hang on the
thread of future research,
which Dement said has been
severely cut back because of
recent controversies involving
the use of animals.
To counter what he views as
an attack on responsible sci
ence, Dement will give a talk
entitled, "A Personal View of
Traumatic Brain Injury and
the Need for Animal Re
search." The talk, which begins
at 4 p.m. in Fairchild Audito

rium, is free and open to the
public.
"Certainly animal research
must be conducted responsibly,
and scientists and institutions
must be held accountable for
the humane care of their
animals. But the current slow
down, based on isolated in
stances of possible care
inadequacies, has thrown the
baby out with the bath water,
said Dement, who studies nar
colepsy, insomnia and other
sleep disorders at the Stanford
Sleep Disorders Research Cen
ter.
Dement's talk is launching a
series of lectures entitled "The
Importance of Animals in Sci
entific Investigation," which
will include a total of seven
lectures throughout the year.
Perhaps no surprise, the De
partment of Laboratory Animal
Medicine is sponsoring the
talks.
