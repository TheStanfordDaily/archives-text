# Scientists want to unravel the tau of physics
## Proposed SLAC atom smasher a charm 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Only particle physicists would
think of spending millions of dol
lars to make something called a
"tau-charm factory."
That is exactly what one group
of physicists hopes to do at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. If the "factory" is ever built,
SLAC physicists will be able to
gain more insight into what are
known as the tau particle and the
charmed quark, both discovered
at SLAC in the 19705.
Scientists understand relatively
little about the tau particle, a
rather unexpectedly heavy parti
cle. Even though no data yet sug
gests any problems with the initial
finding, some of the fundamental
properties of the tau are still not
accurately known.
Charm — which perhaps
sounds more like a property of a
game-show host than of an
elementary particle — was discov
ered by current SLAC director
Burton Richter in 1974. Richter
shared the Nobel prize for the
discovery J-psi particle in 1974.
The problem, experimentalists
say, is that they have not yet had
the tools specifically designed to
study the tau and charm. Now,
scientists led by SLAC physicist
Martin Perl, are suggesting that
a new collider be built to study
them.
The proposed collider, which
Perl said he hopes will get ap
proval by the end of this year, is
expected to produce millions of
the tau and charmed quarks each
year.
Perl said he hopes the ac
celerator will give new insight into
the Standard Model, the govern
ing theory pulling together virtu
ally all of particle physics. More
importantly, say the experimen
talists, the proposed accelerator
experiments might show that
theorists have been wrong.
That was just the case in 1976
when Perl and colleague Gary

Charm sounds
more like a prop
erty of a game
show host than of
an elementary par
ticle.

Feldman sent theorists scram
bling with their discovery of the
tau. Although the Standard Model
could accommodate the finding of
the tau, the theory by no means
predicted the finding.
The tau is a member of the
lepton family, a six-member fam
ily of fundamental particles in
cluding the electron and the
muon. Before the tau finding, lep
tons — literally meaning "light
particles" — were thought to be
light particles.
Perl was intrigued by the pos
sibility that another lepton ex
isted. Although they were given
valuable time to run their atom
smasher experiments, not many
people expected them to find any
thing noteworthy.
And because the tau belonged
to a class of light particles known
as the leptons, such as the
electron and the muon, few people
had expected the finding of a rela
tively heavy particle, about 3,500
times the mass of the tiny
electron.
"Almost no one thought about
the lepton problem," Perl said.
"We just stumbled into it."
Now, more than a decade later,
Perl is returning to perform more
tau physics. SLAC sponsored a
workshop in spring in which sci
entists determined the exact speci
fications for the tau-charm facto
ry. The physicists determined that
they must cram 100 to 1,000
times more particles into the
beam before the accelerator will
work.

If they successfully build their
machine, physicists hope to mea
sure the tau's mass to a precision
10 times better than today's fig
ures. Further, they would like to
understand better how the tau
decays, scattering into several
other particles.
But like any good experimenter,
Perl said he is looking for some

thing new. New physics is some
thing experimentalists go to all
lengths to find, and new physics
is the bane of theorists.
That new physics, Perl thinks,
could be in the form of rare
decays, ones that have not yet
been seen in the relatively few tau
experiments previously per
formed.

Perl said he is looking for some

thing new. New physics is some
thing experimentalists go to all
lengths to find, and new physics
is the bane of theorists.
That new physics, Perl thinks,
could be in the form of rare
decays, ones that have not yet
been seen in the relatively few tau
experiments previously per
formed.
