# Athletes commonly risk neck injury

Doctors say neck injuries like the one
that happened to sophomore Greg Smith
demonstrate the dangers of contact
sports.
Smith broke his neck Sunday when
he fell reaching for a pass in what was
said to be a rough intramural football
game. Another player fell on Smith's
head and neck area, crushing several
vertebrae and leaving him at least tem
porarily paralyzed.
Smith remained in serious but stable
condition yesterday as friends and fam
ily members offered him hope.
Smith is still in stable condition at
the Stanford Hospital after undergoing
emergency surgery Sunday. Smith fell
on his neck after trying to reach for a
pass in what was said to be a very
rough game. Another player, who was
also reaching for the ball, fell on top of
Smith's head and neck area, crushing
several vertebrae.
Doctors did not know whether Smith
would be permanently paralyzed.
Doctors say neck injuries are danger
ous, even life-threatening, and prognosis
centers around how much damage is
done to the spinal cord, the fragile
lifeline carrying information from the
body to the brain and vice versa.
If information cannot flow from the
brain to body parts, the patient is
paralyzed. If information cannot flow
the other direction, the injured person
will not be able to feel anything.
The delicate spinal cord runs through
the center of the stack of vertebrae,
which serve as the cord's major protec
tion. In a violent collision, the vertebrae

can give way, threatening the spinal
cord.
Once damage is done to a spinal cord,
the prognosis is not good, doctors say.
"Its a very, very, very rare thing" that
a damaged spinal cord will get better,
one neurosurgeon said.
Often in neck injuries, like the one
that happened to Smith, the vertebrae
break when the chin hits the chest. The
bones in front of the neck are thrust
back into the spinal cord.
In more serious injuries, so much
force is placed on the neck that disks
on either side of the vertebrae rupture.
The disks are much like flattened golf
balls, gelatinous in the center with a
tough outer surface of tightly inter
woven fibers.
To help remedy ruptured disks, doc
tors take a bone graft from the pelvis
and fasten it to two vertebrae so that
the vertebrae are held apart.
Smith's unfortunate accident high
lights the dangers of some of these
sports, doctors said. They said some of
these injuries cannot be avoided, but
others can if players take a little precau
tion.
Rough play increases the chances of
an injury tremendously, they say. Diving
precariously for long-shot catches is one
such example. Blocking with the head
down is another way neck injuries often
occur.
Much of the reason professional ath
letes don't have more neck injuries is
because they train for heavy-duty, phys
ical play. Football trainers tell their
players it is crucial to strengthen the
neck.
According to Tim Bowman, a physical
therapist at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter, "If you're going to play football,

you want to have a neck that looks like
a tree trunk."
"People should get in shape to play
sports," Bowman said. "Don't play
sports to get in shape.
Doctors say it is crucial to perform
the corrects steps after someone suffers
a neck injury. First and foremost, the
accident victim should not be moved
unless he or she is in a life-threatening
situation. Onlookers should call an am
bulance immediately and keep the ac
cident victim immobilized to prevent fur
ther damage.
