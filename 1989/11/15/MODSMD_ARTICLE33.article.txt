# People get on their feet at new balance disorders clinic

Though last month's earthquake
knocked most Bay Area residents off
balance, for others this is an unwelcome
yet all-too-frequent occurence. These un
steady souls suffer from balance disor
ders.
According to Surgery Assoc. Prof.
Paul Nieberding, a balance disorder is
"very threatening and draining," as vic
tims of the disease are constantly strug
gling to accomplish tasks others
approach with small concern and com
plete with little effort.
Patients at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter may now take advantage of its newly
opened Balance Disorder Clinic. High
tech equipment and group sessions in
volving two physicians and a physio
therapist allow patients with a balance
dysfunction to be rapidly diagnosed and
referred for treatment.
According to Surgery Prof. Blair Sim
mons, an otolaryngologist at the Medical
Center, "Balance information is obtained
three ways: One is the visual system
and its reference to the outside world;
the second is the inner ear; and the
third is what you feel in your tendons
and muscles in relation to gravity." In
order to effectively target the source of
a particular balance disorder, a correct
diagnosis is imperative, doctors say.
Enter a large semicircular, computer
operated, pressure-sensitive device
known as the Equitest. Only recently
available at the Medical Center, the
Equitest is crucial to diagnosis. It aids

in determining the cause of a patient' 3
dizziness, as well as the specific method
of compensation.
Patients are strapped into a harness
to prevent them from falling while stand
ing on a movable platform. Doctors jerk
the platform back and forth and elimi
nate one or more of the patient's three
sources of balance information. An un
settling experience for the patient, the
test nevertheless enables doctors to pin
point the faulty balancing mechanism.
The patient is then evaluated in a
group session and presented with possi
bilities for treatment relating to his or
her particular deficiency.
In regard to the clinic as a whole,
Nieberding remarked: "It is most useful
to those patients who are hard to diag
nose or have defied conventional treat
ments." Conventional treatments include
surgery and medication.
Through the use of the Equitest, phy
sicians can determine how patients are
coping with their balance disorders and
can then help them deal with the situ
ation as effectively as possible in the
event that conventional treatments are
impractical. Some commonly employed
methods include behavior modification,
simple exercises and therapy sessions,
for example "eye training."
Habituation therapy is of particular
importance at the clinic because balance
disorders can significantly affect
everyday life, said Simmons. The most
common cause of balance dysfunction is
psychosomatic, relating to the patient's
overwhelming fear of falling, for which
therapy is the most desirable treatment.
