# Science Bug attempts a breathtaking view of double joints
## 
### Megan Beardsley Staff writer 
Q.A was one of those strange
• dinner conversations. Any
way, we started talking about
being double-jointed — you know,
being able to bend your fingers or
arms into all sorts of weird posi
tions. Why can some people do
this? Why can't I?
A. First of all, double-jointed
• people don't really have ex
tra joints. You probably knew that
already. What they do have is long
ligaments, the tissues that string
your bones together.
For some people these tissues
are loose enough that they can
pop their thumbs or shoulders out
of the proper sockets. This is pri
marily good for grossing out your
friends, but if your ligaments are
really loose, you might make a
small dent in your student loans
by touring state fairs and shop
ping malls as a contortionist.
Where can you get these long

ligaments? According to Hip
pocrates magazine, it's mostly a
question of genetics. People with
families from India and East Asia
are particularly likely to have this
trait. Hormonal changes and
stretching may also make your
ligaments longer, but neither are
recommended.
Q. Since you're Stanford's of
mficial high-IQ insect, this
one should be easy. Do bugs
breathe?
A . Yes
xjL. That was easy enough.
But part of this job is to make
a short answer long. To do this
I'll use a nifty little trick called,
"expanding the question." This is
a beginning level writer's trick,
closely related to the advanced
level technique, "avoiding the
question" (also known by less
polite names), which I will dem
onstrate in next week's column.
We bugs have a respiratory sys
tem very different from yours.

We bugs have a res
piratory system very
different from yours.

Humans and bugs evolved com
pletely independently, according to
Biology Prof. Ward Watt, a bug
specialist.
In a human, the lungs transfer
oxygen to the blood, and the blood
delivers it to body cells. In an
insect, the air travels from "ports"
on the insect's side through a net
work of tubes called tracheae.
These tubes steadily decrease in
diameter and eventually deliver
the air, with its oxygen, directly
to the cells that need it.
In large insects that fly fast,
like big beetles, bees and but
terflies, the beating wings power
"bellows" that pump the air to
the flight muscles, so they can
continue beating the wings. Any
way, it's an extremely efficient
design, if I may say so myself.
