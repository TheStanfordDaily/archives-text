## Spikers crunch California Stanford lands first punch of Big Game week 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
Last night's victory by the Stan
ford women's volleyball team over
California may be an indicator of
events to come.
By beating the Golden Bears in
three straight games, the Cardinal
improved its Pacific 10 Confer
ence record to 12-4, cementing its
hold on second place, while drop
ping California to 7-9 in the Pac
-10. If each team finishes the
season in its current conference
position, the odds are good that
Stanford would host California in
a first-round NCAA regional
game.

"We wouldn't be surprised if
we're here for the [NCAA] tour
nament," California Coach Dave
DeGroot said. "For the first
round, I wouldn't mind coming
back here. I think we can play
with (Stanford). I think we can
beat them."
"We know we didn't come out
and play strong tonight," Cal out
side hitter Lisa Arce said. "(A
rematch in the regionals) would
be a fun game, a great game to
watch. We're really looking for
ward to coming back if we can."
Stanford's win last night had
the excitement of a postseason
match. Though each team dis
played sporadic play, Stanford and
California battled for nearly two
hours before the contest was
decided. The Cardinal jumped out
to an early lead in each game but
the Bears battled back and chal
lenged Stanford.
Proverbially speaking, the
match wasn't as lopsided as the
game scores indicate.

In game three, Stanford took a
4-2 lead only to see the Bears
take the lead at 5-4. But the Car
dinal rallied to go up 10-5 by
capitalizing on continued Cal hit
ting errors.
When Stanford appeared ready
to take the match, Arce and setter
Holly McPeak caught fire to pull
the Bears to within a point at
14-13. Arce rattled off six kills in
six sets from McPeak, who con
tributed an ace and other strong
serves off her jump-serve.
Arce placed a gutsy serve down
the line for an ace to gain a crucial
sideout. But Stanford won the
contest when Cal middle blocker
Morgan Cecil hit wide after Car
dinal setter Carrie Feldman
served for the match.
"Cal did a good job hanging in
there. They came up with some
unbelieveable plays defensively,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"It wasn't because of our poor
play that we didn't put them
away. It's just that Cal, once they
got down, they hung very, very
tough. It was a good win for us."
The Bears played very well in
the first two games as well. Cal
battled back from 7-4 and 13-8
deficits in game one only to lose
15-11. In game two, the Bears
came from 7-0 and 10-6 down to
pull to 14-12 by winning several
important sideouts. Stanford won
the game when McPeak backset
for middle blocker Carolyn
Kempker, but the set sailed and
Kempker whiffed to give the Car
dinal the point.
Leading the Cardinal on the
night was middle blocker Bev
Oden, who hit .441 on 34 total
attacks while committing only two
hitting errors. Senior outside hit
ter Laura Olesen hit .323 while
tallying 17 digs. Kristin Klein also
contributed 17 digs and hit .346.
"Overall, I think we played
pretty well," Oden said. "We could
have easily let them keep on their

rolls and win the game after we
got off to a great lead. We didn't,
and I think that shows we're im
proving mentally."
But while Stanford spread the
fine play throughout the lineup,
the Bears spotlighted the play of
McPeak and Arce. Arce, who was
named last week's Pac-10 Player
of the Week, continued her torrid
play by hitting .362 on an un
believeable 58 swings, and added
16 digs.
"(Stanford wasn't) covering the
corners on my back row attacks,"
Arce said. "So I just kept swinging
away. They're a good blocking
team so I just had to go for it."
"Arce out of the back row was
killing us," Oden said. "She was
doing a great job."
McPeak also was at the top of
her abilities. The junior setter,
who two years ago was named the
National Freshman of the Year,
committed no hitting errors and
totaled a .571 hitting percentage.
She also set 48 balls and led all
players from both teams with 21
digs.
Stanford has only two confer
ence matches remaining this
season, both at home this week
end. Washington will enter
Burnham Pavilion on Friday
night with a 11-6 conference
mark, in third place, only two
games behind Stanford. Washing
ton's last loss to a Pac-10 team
other than UCLA (who is unde
feated in the Pac-10) was to Stan
ford on Sept. 16 in Seattle.
Washington State, which shares
the Pac-10 cellar with Oregon
State, will play Stanford on Sun
day at noon.
