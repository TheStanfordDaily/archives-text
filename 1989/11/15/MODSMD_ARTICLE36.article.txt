# Johnson's injury symbolizes mixed-up Cardinal emotions
## 
### 
One minute, Brian Johnson is
throwing a touchdown pass to Jon
Pinckney, and he's the greatest
quarterback in the world.
Later, Johnson hooks up with Arizona
State's Israel Stanley who runs 70 yards
the wrong way for a Sun Devil touch
down. Suddenly, the greatest quarterback
in the world should be benched in favor
of freshman Steve Smith.
Such are the vicissitudes of sport.
Every fan around falls victim to the fair
weather syndrome now and again. It is
manifest in the Monday morning quar
terbacking that goes on every time one's
team comes up a loser.
Stanford's loss in Tempe, Ariz, last Sat
urday is a case in point. Johnson piloted
the team to its best offensive showing of
the season, yet the Cardinal failed to pick
up its third win. A couple of Johnson
passes that found their way into the
hands of defensive backs played a fairly
significant part in the defeat.
If you're feeling mixed emotions about
8.J., you're not the only one. From 20-
yard line to 20-yard line, Johnson is the
best quarterback Stanford has seen since
John Paye graduated. He looks like a
quarterback; he leads like a quarterback.
Once in scoring position, though, the
Stanford offense has had more than its
share of trouble putting points on the

board. Johnson has thrown too many
interceptions when the Cardinal was
knocking on the door.
Pointing that out doesn't mean that 1
feel Johnson is a lousy QB, just an im
perfect one. He is like an old boyfriend
or girlfriend. You know deep down you
should let him go and find someone else
because things will never quite work out.
At the same time, you can't let go. You
remember all the good times and all the
fun you had together, and you wish it
didn't have to end.
The love affair between Johnson and
Stanford may finally be over, however.
Rumors are circulating that the New
York Yankees are trying to renegotiate
Johnson's baseball contract. George
Steinbrenner and Co. can't be happy that
their catcher prospect separated a shoul

der playing football.
The Yankees may take a hard line on
the football issue and force Johnson to
forego his final year of eligibility here.
If that happens, we'll have to find another
ship adrift on the ocean to argue about.
The nomination here is for women's
volleyball, a favorite subject of dis
cussion in this space. Stanford
Coach Don Shaw seems to think I view
his team as a worthless collection of hacks
who'd have trouble winning a B-league
intramural game.
Nothing is farther from the truth. It's
just those darned mixed emotions again.
On the one hand, the Cardinal women
seem to be a top-10 volleyball team that
poses no threat to the best in the country.
National championship contenders, the
theory goes, don't lose to the Oregons
and San Jose States of the world. At
times the team seems listless, and you
know what they say about a body at rest.
The other side of the coin is a different
matter entirely. Looking at Stanford's per
sonnel, one sees the makings of a nearly
unstoppable force. If they can just turn
it up a notch, the Cardinal could literally
go all the way.
The latter scenario is possible, and,
contrary to what Shaw might think, I've
never said otherwise. Suggesting that

He is like an old

people are playing below their potential
isn't the same as stating they can't get
the job done.
As a matter of fact, they can. Kristin
Klein has shown time and again she's
one of the best in the nation. Klein is
the kind of player other teams have to
focus on, and that allows others to have
free rein. Fortunately, Stanford's attack
is not one-dimensional. Frehsman sensa
tion Bev Oden demonstrated her ability
to dominate a match twice last weekend.
The bad news is that two standouts
simply cannot beat a team with six top
notch players. As I've noted before, for
Stanford to make a run in the postseason,
one or more players are going to have
to step forward and provide a new weapon

for the Cardinal arsenal.
The talent is most certainly there. In
the coming weeks, it will become clear
whether the execution is there, too.
A special spot on the emotional roller
coaster is reserved for men's bas
ketball Coach Mike Montgomery.
A master at player development, Mont
gomery deserves much of the credit for
taking his team to heights it had not
seen in the second half of the 20th cen
tury.
Still, there is a nagging feeling that
the high point of the Montgomery Era
has already come and gone. Outside of
Adam Keefe, Montgomery has been un
able to attract top high schoolers to Stan
ford. Without an infusion of new talent,
the successes of the past two years will
prove short-lived.
Followers of the program viewed the
recently completed early-signing period
as a make-or-break opportunity in
recruiting. All the Cardinal has to show
for it is a letter of intent from Bob Patton
â€” a 6-foot point guard.
Patton was likened to 1989 grad Terry
Taylor. That, I'm afraid, hardly portends
a rapid return to the NCAA tournament.
Unless of course, Montgomery leads
Adam Keefe, Andrew Vlahov and the rest
back there all by himself.
