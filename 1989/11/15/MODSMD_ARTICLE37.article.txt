# IM playoffs to start despite injury fears
## 
### Rob Johnstone Staff writer 
Despite an injury-plagued final
weekend, the intramural football
regular season limped to a close
Sunday and playoff schedules
have been posted.

IM sports report

Twice as many games as usual
were played last weekend due to
rescheduling, contributing to the
number, although not the
severity, of the injuries.
Adding to the IM commotion
was a bench-clearing brawl during
Sunday's A league bout between
the Theta Delts and Biz 18. Biz
won the game, but onlookers said
the Theta Delts won the fight.
No serious iryuries were reported
at the scene.
Despite a turbulent weekend,
the IM playoffs will continue as
planned.
The schedule and seedings were
announced Monday, with games
beginning today. The Graduate
School of Economics, known as
The Invisible Hands, received the
number one seed in the B league

playoffs.
"They're a big, physical team
that played in a strong league,"
said student intramural coordina
tor Theo Smith.
The number two seed went to
3L, a Law School team. The num
ber three and four seeds went to
the Betas and the Grateful Med.
The Grateful Med team sealed
its playoff ranking Sunday with
a 21-0 victory over Carlos. Grate
ful Med quarterback Frank Lyle
cut up the Carlos defense with
surgical precision, throwing three
touchdown passes.
The Med defense also proved
itself ready for the playoffs, stop
ping Carlos on three fourth-down
opportunities.
In other B league games, Kappa
Sigma overcame Roble 6-0 in over
time to go 5-0 on the season and
earn the fifth seed in the playoffs.
Kappa Sigma and Roble were
scoreless after regulation, with
Kappa Sigma finally scoring in
the second set of overtime downs
to preserve its undefeated season.
The SAE's also tuned up for
the playoffs Saturday, defeating a
tough Whitless team 21-0. SAE's
high-powered offense was tempo
rarily shut down in the first half
by a stingy Whitless defense, re
sulting in a 0-0 halfltime tie. But
the SAE's erupted in the second
half with 21 unanswered points.
The scoreless tie was broken by
the SAE's Mason-Dixon connec
tion. Georgia's Mr. Football Mike
Sheppard threw a 30-yard touch
down pass on fourth down to Lou
isiana's Ragin' Cajun John
Thomas to make the score 7-0.
SAE added two more touch
downs, including an interception
return for a score by Chris Bailey,
leaving the final 21-0.
Rod Serling of Twilight Zone
fame would have been proud of
Kemet Nu's 10-6 win over Madera
in a Sunday B league game. This
game had it all — a full moon
rising, a pink and purple sur
realistic sunset, oncoming dark
ness and some extremely strange
football action.
Kemet Nu took an early 4-0
lead on two Madera safeties.
Madera snapped the ball into its
own end zone twice, and narrowly
missed a third safety when a
second-half snap landed on the
one-yard line.
Madera's second safety was by

far the strangest. Faced with a
fourth down, Madera elected to
punt. Under intramural rules, the
defense can't rush the punt and
the offense merely needs to toss
the ball to the punter. Yet
Madera's center snapped the ball
well over the punter's head and
into the end zone for a safety.
Madera did redeem itself on the
next play as Kemet Nu took pos
session after the safety on its own
25-yard line. On the first play
from scrimmage, Madera's Matt
Howard intercepted a Kemet Nu
pass and ran it back 30 yards for
a touchdown. After a failed extra
point, Madera led 6-4.
Kemet Nu came roaring back
with a strong offensive series, re
sulting in a touchdown pass from
quarterback Robert Reader to
flanker Mark Baker to make the
score 10-6. Kemet Nu played
strong defense in the second half,
including a goal-line stand with
less than one minute remaining
in the game, to hang on for the
10-6 victory and a playoff berth.

The water polo playoff schedule was
also announced Monday, with the
Crew team seeded first. Apparently
as comfortable in the water as they
are rowing on it, the Crew squad
warmed up for the playoffs Saturday
by crushing Trancos 13-2.

regular season limped to a close
Sunday and playoff schedules
have been posted.

regular season limped to a close
Sunday and playoff schedules
have been posted.

IM sports report

Twice as many games as usual
were played last weekend due to
rescheduling, contributing to the
number, although not the
severity, of the injuries.
Adding to the IM commotion
was a bench-clearing brawl during
Sunday's A league bout between
the Theta Delts and Biz 18. Biz
won the game, but onlookers said
the Theta Delts won the fight.
No serious iryuries were reported
at the scene.
Despite a turbulent weekend,
the IM playoffs will continue as
planned.
The schedule and seedings were
announced Monday, with games
beginning today. The Graduate
School of Economics, known as
The Invisible Hands, received the
number one seed in the B league

playoffs.
"They're a big, physical team
that played in a strong league,"
said student intramural coordina
tor Theo Smith.
The number two seed went to
3L, a Law School team. The num
ber three and four seeds went to
the Betas and the Grateful Med.
The Grateful Med team sealed
its playoff ranking Sunday with
a 21-0 victory over Carlos. Grate
ful Med quarterback Frank Lyle
cut up the Carlos defense with
surgical precision, throwing three
touchdown passes.
The Med defense also proved
itself ready for the playoffs, stop
ping Carlos on three fourth-down
opportunities.
In other B league games, Kappa
Sigma overcame Roble 6-0 in over
time to go 5-0 on the season and
earn the fifth seed in the playoffs.
Kappa Sigma and Roble were
scoreless after regulation, with
Kappa Sigma finally scoring in
the second set of overtime downs
to preserve its undefeated season.
The SAE's also tuned up for
the playoffs Saturday, defeating a
tough Whitless team 21-0. SAE's
high-powered offense was tempo
rarily shut down in the first half
by a stingy Whitless defense, re
sulting in a 0-0 halfltime tie. But
the SAE's erupted in the second
half with 21 unanswered points.
The scoreless tie was broken by
the SAE's Mason-Dixon connec
tion. Georgia's Mr. Football Mike
Sheppard threw a 30-yard touch
down pass on fourth down to Lou
isiana's Ragin' Cajun John
Thomas to make the score 7-0.
SAE added two more touch
downs, including an interception
return for a score by Chris Bailey,
leaving the final 21-0.
Rod Serling of Twilight Zone
fame would have been proud of
Kemet Nu's 10-6 win over Madera
in a Sunday B league game. This
game had it all — a full moon
rising, a pink and purple sur
realistic sunset, oncoming dark
ness and some extremely strange
football action.
Kemet Nu took an early 4-0
lead on two Madera safeties.
Madera snapped the ball into its
own end zone twice, and narrowly
missed a third safety when a
second-half snap landed on the
one-yard line.
Madera's second safety was by

far the strangest. Faced with a
fourth down, Madera elected to
punt. Under intramural rules, the
defense can't rush the punt and
the offense merely needs to toss
the ball to the punter. Yet
Madera's center snapped the ball
well over the punter's head and
into the end zone for a safety.
Madera did redeem itself on the
next play as Kemet Nu took pos
session after the safety on its own
25-yard line. On the first play
from scrimmage, Madera's Matt
Howard intercepted a Kemet Nu
pass and ran it back 30 yards for
a touchdown. After a failed extra
point, Madera led 6-4.
Kemet Nu came roaring back
with a strong offensive series, re
sulting in a touchdown pass from
quarterback Robert Reader to
flanker Mark Baker to make the
score 10-6. Kemet Nu played
strong defense in the second half,
including a goal-line stand with
less than one minute remaining
in the game, to hang on for the
10-6 victory and a playoff berth.
Im notes
The water polo playoff schedule was
also announced Monday, with the
Crew team seeded first. Apparently
as comfortable in the water as they
are rowing on it, the Crew squad
warmed up for the playoffs Saturday
by crushing Trancos 13-2.
