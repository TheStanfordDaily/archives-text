# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
As the autumn leaves turn from green to
crimson, yellow and a touch of Cardinal,
November marks the transition from fall to
winter sports on the Farm.
With the women's volleyball and men's
water polo teams surging toward the NCAA
playoffs, and the men's swimming team sig
naling the approach of winter championships
to come, a balance had to be struck between
the new and old of Cardinal athletics.

Keeping this balance in mind, this week's
winners are Bev Oden of the volleyball team
and Jeff Rouse of the swimming team.
Oden, a 6-foot-2 freshman from Irvine,
Calif., is Athlete of the Week for the second
consecutive week after directing the surging
Cardinal spikers to a two-game weekend
sweep of Arizona and Arizona State.
After threatening to disappear off the vol
leyball map, Stanford rebounded to a week
end sweep in Arizona to keep its NCAA
championship hopes alive.
Oden tallied a .532 hitting percentage Fri
day as Stanford ripped ASU 15-9, 15-13,
15-5.
Then Sunday she keyed a fifth-game de
fensive stand as Stanford edged Arizona 15-
12, 10-15, 15-9, 9-15, 15-4. Oden hit 326
for the match, recording four solo blocks
and five block assists.
Counting last night's victory over Cal,
Stanford stands at 12-4 in the Pacific 10
Conference and 16-8 overall.

Rouse, a sophomore from F redericksburg,
Va., sparked the Cardinal swimmers to a
67-46 dual meet win over No. 1 Texas Sat
urday at deGuerre Pool.
The defending NCAA champion in the 200
backstroke, Rouse set a new record for
deGuerre with a 1:48.31 time, qualifying
him easily for the 1990 NCAAs. The next
closest swimmer was over three seconds be
hind.
Rouse helped set the pace for the Cardinal

victory early in the meet, teaming with
freshmen J.J. Freitag and Erik Maurer and
senior Doug Lillydahl to beat the Longhorns
in the 400 medley relay.
Stanford swam a 3:20.47 to beat Texas,
and the stage was set for a Cardinal upset
of the defending national champions.

on Thursday at 2 p.m. with the Big Game
swim meet against California.
