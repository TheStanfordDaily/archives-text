# Reopening uncertain for three Row houses
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Because of missing blueprints and
complicated repair processes, Univer
sity administrators are still uncertain
whether Durand, Roth and Theta Xi
houses will be reopened this year.
According to Susan Tamiesie, oper
ations manager of Student Housing,
University officials were forced to
change their previous decision to open
the houses by winter quarter as reports
of the damage to these three houses
began to be compiled.
Rodger Whitney, the director of the
Housing Center, said the damage to
the three houses has not yet been fully
assessed. Without this information, it
is "premature to speculate" when any
repairs to these houses can be com
pleted, he said.
The problems are further compli
cated by the fact that no blueprints

It has not been decided whether the houses
will be reopened spring quarter, even if they
have been fully repaired.

or plans are available for the houses,
Tamiesie said. Blueprints will have to
be recreated before the exact nature
of the damage can be ascertained.
The repair process has also been
slowed because Stanford is working
with federal and state agencies to
receive earthquake relief funding,
Whitney said.
In accordance with the rules for ob
taining federal funding, repair work
on residences that exceeds $36,000
must be competitively bid on by a num
ber of different contractors.
With approximately $40,000 in as-

bestos abatement work that must be
completed before other repairs can
begin, Durand falls into this category,
according to Tamiesie. The competi
tive bidding process will add to the
delay in beginning repairs there.
All of these problems make it diffi
cult to know if the houses will be
reopened by spring quarter, Whitney
said.
Furthermore, it has not been
decided whether the houses will be
reopened spring quarter, even if they
have been fully repaired.
Whitney said the decision will

depend on whether people want to go
back to their houses and whether the
housing space is needed.
Whitney questioned whether people
would want to move again, having al
ready had to relocate once this year.
He also said there are usually a large
number of housing vacancies spring
quarter because of people going over
seas.
Because it is a fraternity house,
Theta Xi, known as the Taxi, is in a
different situation than Roth and
Durand, which are regular draw
houses. According to Whitney, the de
cision to open Taxi will depend on
different factors.
Whitney did not foresee a housing
shortage for winter quarter, when
people return from overseas campuses.
He noted that more spaces were
created than were needed after the
earthquake and that approximately
100 people were released from their
housing contracts.
