# Cardinal casts Big Game magic
## Firebrand Taylor leads red-hot California into Stanford Stadium 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
For Stanford football fans, this
week looks a lot like last week.
The Cardinal is facing a team
coming off two straight upsets

and is riding the right arm of a
red-hot quarterback.
The only difference is that this
is Big Game. And when Big Game
rolls around, past results don't
make a difference.
Previous coaches have said that

there are two seasons at Stanford
and California — the first 10
games and Big Game. And while
the 4-6 Golden Bears and the 2-8
Cardinal both wish their first
season could have been better, the
two teams have a fresh slate for
season No. 2.
"I think Big Game is important
because it's our last game of the
season and our most important
game of the season, more impor
tant than Notre Dame," Stanford
Coach Denny Green said of his
first Big Game.
The Cardinal will be without
the services of quarterback Brian
Johnson and probably also full
back Jon Volpe. Johnson is having
shoulder surgery this week, and
Volpe still has not recovered from
arthroscopic knee surgery.
On the Cal side, the Cardinal
defense will have to find a way
to stop Troy Taylor, the Bears'
quarterback. Taylor has been on
fire the last two weeks in leading
Cal to consecutive Pacific 10 Con
ference upsets over Arizona and
Washington State.
Taylor, a senior from Rancho
Cordova, Calif., was named Of
fensive Pac-10 Player of the Week
for leading the Bears past Wash
ington State.
He completed 25 of 33 passes
for 368 yards and two touchdowns
while leading California to a 38-26
win. Taylor also ran for 27 yards
to total 395 yards total offense —
the second highest single-game
total in Cal history.
"A lot of teams in the Pac-10
are throwing the ball," Green said,
"and I don't think anyone's been
doing a better job of it the last
couple of weeks than Cal."
To beat the Bears, Stanford will
have to do a better job stopping
Taylor than the team did stopping
Paul Justin last week. The Ari
zona State signal-caller threw for
296 yards in ASU's 30-22 win.
No matter what happens,
though, the odds are good that
the game will be close. "We know
it's going to be a very hard-fought
game," Green said. "We've had
five down-to-the-wire games here
at Stanford Stadium this year,
and we think this will be the same
type of game."
Last year's game ended in a 19-

19 tie as Tuan Van Le blocked a
19-yard field goal on the last play
of the game to preserve the tie
for Stanford. Neither team
seemed pleased with the outcome,
however.
"We were happy that we got
the block," guard Andy Papat
hanassiou said. "It was a great
accomplishment by Tuan. Then
we realized time ran out, and we
were tied."
This will be Papathanassiou's
final Big Game, as the senior will
graduate after having started all
45 games over the past four years.
His heir apparent as a long-term
starter on the offensive line is
Bob Whitfield, a season-long
starter at offensive tackle.
The improvement of Whitfield
has contributed to Stanford's im
provement, especially in the run
ning game. "I see a whole lot of
improvement," Whitfield said.
"I'm playing a whole lot better; I
can feel that. I'm picking up the
system."
Whitfield's improvement got
him in trouble last week, however,
when his blocking frustrated Is
rael Stanley. The ASU outside
linebacker got in a fight with
Whitfield, and the Cardinal was
penalized 15 yards.
"I was blocking the guy," Whit
field said. "He fell down and coach
tells us to cover him when your
guy falls down. When you cover
a guy you have to give him a
couple of pushes, get him in the
dirt, to let him know that if he
falls again you'll cover him again.
"I kind of pushed him a little
when I got up. Then he pushed
me first, and when I retaliated,
the ref threw the flag. I wish he
didn't do that.
"[Stanleyl was calling me a
chump before the right hook; after
it he called me Tyson."

Southern Cal wrapped up the Rose
Bowl race last week by thumping Ar
izona, 24-3. The Trojans battle
derailed UCLA this weekend, Wash
ington State visits Washington for the
Apple Cup, and Oregon State travels

game tabbed the Civil War.
Arizona will travel to Arizona State
Nov. 25 to fight the Sun Devils for
a potential bowl bid.

and is riding the right arm of a
red-hot quarterback.
The only difference is that this
is Big Game. And when Big Game
rolls around, past results don't
make a difference.
Previous coaches have said that

there are two seasons at Stanford
and California — the first 10
games and Big Game. And while
the 4-6 Golden Bears and the 2-8
Cardinal both wish their first
season could have been better, the
two teams have a fresh slate for
season No. 2.
"I think Big Game is important
because it's our last game of the
season and our most important
game of the season, more impor
tant than Notre Dame," Stanford
Coach Denny Green said of his
first Big Game.
The Cardinal will be without
the services of quarterback Brian
Johnson and probably also full
back Jon Volpe. Johnson is having
shoulder surgery this week, and
Volpe still has not recovered from
arthroscopic knee surgery.
On the Cal side, the Cardinal
defense will have to find a way
to stop Troy Taylor, the Bears'
quarterback. Taylor has been on
fire the last two weeks in leading
Cal to consecutive Pacific 10 Con
ference upsets over Arizona and
Washington State.
Taylor, a senior from Rancho
Cordova, Calif., was named Of
fensive Pac-10 Player of the Week
for leading the Bears past Wash
ington State.
He completed 25 of 33 passes
for 368 yards and two touchdowns
while leading California to a 38-26
win. Taylor also ran for 27 yards
to total 395 yards total offense —
the second highest single-game
total in Cal history.
"A lot of teams in the Pac-10
are throwing the ball," Green said,
"and I don't think anyone's been
doing a better job of it the last
couple of weeks than Cal."
To beat the Bears, Stanford will
have to do a better job stopping
Taylor than the team did stopping
Paul Justin last week. The Ari
zona State signal-caller threw for
296 yards in ASU's 30-22 win.
No matter what happens,
though, the odds are good that
the game will be close. "We know
it's going to be a very hard-fought
game," Green said. "We've had
five down-to-the-wire games here
at Stanford Stadium this year,
and we think this will be the same
type of game."
Last year's game ended in a 19-

19 tie as Tuan Van Le blocked a
19-yard field goal on the last play
of the game to preserve the tie
for Stanford. Neither team
seemed pleased with the outcome,
however.
"We were happy that we got
the block," guard Andy Papat
hanassiou said. "It was a great
accomplishment by Tuan. Then
we realized time ran out, and we
were tied."
This will be Papathanassiou's
final Big Game, as the senior will
graduate after having started all
45 games over the past four years.
His heir apparent as a long-term
starter on the offensive line is
Bob Whitfield, a season-long
starter at offensive tackle.
The improvement of Whitfield
has contributed to Stanford's im
provement, especially in the run
ning game. "I see a whole lot of
improvement," Whitfield said.
"I'm playing a whole lot better; I
can feel that. I'm picking up the
system."
Whitfield's improvement got
him in trouble last week, however,
when his blocking frustrated Is
rael Stanley. The ASU outside
linebacker got in a fight with
Whitfield, and the Cardinal was
penalized 15 yards.
"I was blocking the guy," Whit
field said. "He fell down and coach
tells us to cover him when your
guy falls down. When you cover
a guy you have to give him a
couple of pushes, get him in the
dirt, to let him know that if he
falls again you'll cover him again.
"I kind of pushed him a little
when I got up. Then he pushed
me first, and when I retaliated,
the ref threw the flag. I wish he
didn't do that.
"[Stanleyl was calling me a
chump before the right hook; after
it he called me Tyson."
Pac-10 notes
Southern Cal wrapped up the Rose
Bowl race last week by thumping Ar
izona, 24-3. The Trojans battle
derailed UCLA this weekend, Wash
ington State visits Washington for the
Apple Cup, and Oregon State travels
to Eugene to challenge Oregon in a
game tabbed the Civil War.
Arizona will travel to Arizona State
Nov. 25 to fight the Sun Devils for
a potential bowl bid.

Receiver Ed McCaffrey will be hooking up with quarterback Steve
Smith again Saturday as Stanford looks to beat California in the
Big Game. Despite Stanford's lackluster offense this year, McCaffrey
has had an outstanding season and is ranked No. 4 in the Pac-10
in receiving with 49 catches for 793 yards and four touchdowns.
For Stanford football fans, this
week looks a lot like last week.
