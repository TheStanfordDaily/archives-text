# Hoover senior fellow:
## German unification unlikely 
### Katie Lipkin 
Unification of East and West
Germany will not occur in the
near future, according to Senior
Hoover Fellow David Gress, who
spoke last night at Haus Mit
teleuropa to a group of about 20
students.
The opening of the Berlin Wall
was an "irrevocable" action that
signals "a new tone from the East
German government," said Gress,
who is from Denmark. He was
quick to add, however, that it is
"unfortunate that unification has
been raised in this context."
Gress asserted that this "star
tling" action raises the question
of serious reform in the socialist
country of East Germany. The
question of unification is second
ary.
Essentially, according to Gress,
East and West Germany are in a
state of "legal limbo" in the sense
that they cannot become a legally
united state. France, Great Brit
ain, the Soviet Union and the
United States divided Germany
following World War 11, eventually
leading to the creation of East
and West Germany. Under inter
national law, the occupying coun
tries still control Germany.
Hitler's Reich government was
never actually dissolved — it only
surrendered — and it cannot be
legally dissolved without its con
sent. Gress said this legal tangle
resulted in the birth of East and
West Germany with a "birth
defect of incompleteness."
In 1972, there seemed to be
some hope for clarity in their re
lationship, though not for unifica
tion. East and West Germany
signed the Treaty on Basis of Re
lations, in which the two states
recognized each others' existence
and agreed to conduct normal re
lations, Gress explained. Many
labeled this action as a "treaty of
division" and saw it as the aboli
tion of any hope for the two states
to merge, he said.

After this treaty, however, the
two Germanys were satisfied with
only small steps toward coexist
ence. Many concentrated their ef
forts on the unification of Eastern
Europe, Gress explained.
Referring to the East Germans
as "caught a little bit on the hop,"
Gress stated that "they are tread
ing carefully now because they
don't want to raise the unification
issue."
The reason behind opening the

wall was not the issue of unifica
tion but the "disastrous state" of
the East German economy, ac
cording to Gress.
He concluded that if unification
does occur, it will be far in the
future, and it will more likely as
sume the form of a federation.
He stressed that the solution to
the German question will arise in
a Europe with "less tension and
a more harmonious political rela
tionship."
