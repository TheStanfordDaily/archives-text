# Stanford students climb Berlin Wall

### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: The following article is the second
from a Daily staff writer in Stanford's program in
West Berlin. Several students in the Berlin program,
including the writer, watched firsthand as more
than a million Germans crossed the long-standing
harrier between East and West.

BERLIN — After the official announcement of
the opened border here Thursday around 9 p.m.,
drama began to unfold around the Brandenburg
Gate.
Citizens from both East and West began to con
gregate near the gate on their respective sides of
the wall, as the eyes of the world media turned to
the event.
The gate, built in 1789, has been the symbol of
the divided city ever since the wall was constructed.
The gate straddles Unter den Linden, the most
famous street in Berlin, which travels from east to
west.
Unfortunately, the monument now lies in no
man's land, inaccessible to citizens on either side
of the wall.

Berliners chip away at the wall that has divided their city for 28 years.
Junior Troy Haines, who is cur
rently participating in Stanford's
program in West Berlin, was
among the group of eight Stanford
students at the gate Thursday
night.
"When we first got there, one
or two people were on the wall,"
Haynes said. "There were border
guards spraying people away from
the wall (with water cannons)."
Both East and West Berliners
were trying to get over their
respective walls to walk where
only border troops have gone for
28 years. Less than seven months
ago, an East German was shot
dead trying to escape across no
man's land, not far from the Bran
denburg Gate.
As midnight drew near Thurs
day, the border troops inexplicably
dropped their water hoses and
gave up the fight. Tentatively at
first, West Berliners scaled the
wall. The eight Stanford students
were among the first wave of
people over the wall.
Explaining why the students
decided to go over the wall, Stan
ford student Peter Johnson said,
"Dave Crook (another Stanford
student) went over the wall,
walked halfway to the gate, came
back and encouraged us to go
down."
Half-jokingly, Stanford student
Andrew Schultz described his
feeling upon jumping down into
no man's land by saying, "I
thought I was going to be shot."
People from East and West
milled around talking to each
other, many shocked that they
were actually standing beneath
Brandenburg Gate.
Incredible emotion charged the
atmosphere on the "night of the
open border," as one local paper
described Thursday evening.
"People were so emotionally
charged, it seemed that the guards
didn't even want to stop them,"

Schultz said. He added that people
were "kind of walking around
slowly, with smiles and awe on
their faces, taking a lot of photos."
People chanted, "The wall must
go!" and attacked it with small
hammers and picks. A woman
playing guitar with a man accom
panying on saxophone led the
large crowd in songs.
An East German man, clearly
intent on staying in the West, held
his burning identification card
aloft as the crowd cheered. The
person spray-painted, "The wall
is gone" on the east side of the
wall, which has remained com
pletely bare since it was con
structed, in contrast to west side,
which is covered with graffiti.
But Stanford student Mark
Scheeff pointed out that the scene
at Brandenburg gate, though emo
tional, was incredibly peaceful.
People chatted with the border
guards, who were friendly and just
as surprised as everyone else at
recent developments. The border
guards said that people would be
allowed underneath the gate for
one night and then they would
tighten it up once more.
Just before dawn Friday, the
border guards finally moved in,

slowly getting people back over
the wall. But the people remained
standing on top of the wall, about
three yards wide, until early Sat
urday morning when the border
troops again used water cannons.
Beginning early Saturday, new
holes in the wall began to appear,
where new crossings were being
constructed to handle the traffic.
Nine new crossings between East
and West are planned to opened
in the next week, many of which
require holes to be cut in the wall.
Train stations that haven't been
in use in 28 years were opened,
and Glienicker Bridge, famous as
the place where captured spies
and dissidents were exchanged in
the past, was reopened to East-
West traffic Friday evening.
Crowds gathered to watch the
East German crews cut holes in
the walls with jackhammers and
pave roads over no man's land.
The most sought-after souvenir
has quickly become a piece of the
wall.
In fact, West Berlin has taken
on a kind of circus environment
as people gather in the street
celebrating — conscious of being
part of an incredible historic
event.

BERLIN — After the official announcement of
the opened border here Thursday around 9 p.m.,
drama began to unfold around the Brandenburg
Gate.
Citizens from both East and West began to con
gregate near the gate on their respective sides of
the wall, as the eyes of the world media turned to
the event.
The gate, built in 1789, has been the symbol of
the divided city ever since the wall was constructed.
The gate straddles Unter den Linden, the most
famous street in Berlin, which travels from east to
west.
Unfortunately, the monument now lies in no
man's land, inaccessible to citizens on either side
of the wall.

Berliners chip away at the wall that has divided their city for 28 years.
Junior Troy Haines, who is cur
rently participating in Stanford's
program in West Berlin, was
among the group of eight Stanford
students at the gate Thursday
night.
"When we first got there, one
or two people were on the wall,"
Haynes said. "There were border
guards spraying people away from
the wall (with water cannons)."
Both East and West Berliners
were trying to get over their
respective walls to walk where
only border troops have gone for
28 years. Less than seven months
ago, an East German was shot
dead trying to escape across no
man's land, not far from the Bran
denburg Gate.
As midnight drew near Thurs
day, the border troops inexplicably
dropped their water hoses and
gave up the fight. Tentatively at
first, West Berliners scaled the
wall. The eight Stanford students
were among the first wave of
people over the wall.
Explaining why the students
decided to go over the wall, Stan
ford student Peter Johnson said,
"Dave Crook (another Stanford
student) went over the wall,
walked halfway to the gate, came
back and encouraged us to go
down."
Half-jokingly, Stanford student
Andrew Schultz described his
feeling upon jumping down into
no man's land by saying, "I
thought I was going to be shot."
People from East and West
milled around talking to each
other, many shocked that they
were actually standing beneath
Brandenburg Gate.
Incredible emotion charged the
atmosphere on the "night of the
open border," as one local paper
described Thursday evening.
"People were so emotionally
charged, it seemed that the guards
didn't even want to stop them,"

Schultz said. He added that people
were "kind of walking around
slowly, with smiles and awe on
their faces, taking a lot of photos."
People chanted, "The wall must
go!" and attacked it with small
hammers and picks. A woman
playing guitar with a man accom
panying on saxophone led the
large crowd in songs.
An East German man, clearly
intent on staying in the West, held
his burning identification card
aloft as the crowd cheered. The
person spray-painted, "The wall
is gone" on the east side of the
wall, which has remained com
pletely bare since it was con
structed, in contrast to west side,
which is covered with graffiti.
But Stanford student Mark
Scheeff pointed out that the scene
at Brandenburg gate, though emo
tional, was incredibly peaceful.
People chatted with the border
guards, who were friendly and just
as surprised as everyone else at
recent developments. The border
guards said that people would be
allowed underneath the gate for
one night and then they would
tighten it up once more.
Just before dawn Friday, the
border guards finally moved in,

slowly getting people back over
the wall. But the people remained
standing on top of the wall, about
three yards wide, until early Sat
urday morning when the border
troops again used water cannons.
Beginning early Saturday, new
holes in the wall began to appear,
where new crossings were being
constructed to handle the traffic.
Nine new crossings between East
and West are planned to opened
in the next week, many of which
require holes to be cut in the wall.
Train stations that haven't been
in use in 28 years were opened,
and Glienicker Bridge, famous as
the place where captured spies
and dissidents were exchanged in
the past, was reopened to East-
West traffic Friday evening.
Crowds gathered to watch the
East German crews cut holes in
the walls with jackhammers and
pave roads over no man's land.
The most sought-after souvenir
has quickly become a piece of the
wall.
In fact, West Berlin has taken
on a kind of circus environment
as people gather in the street
celebrating — conscious of being
part of an incredible historic
event.
