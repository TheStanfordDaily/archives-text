Editor's note: The following article is the second
from a Daily staff writer in Stanford's program in
West Berlin. Several students in the Berlin program,
including the writer, watched firsthand as more
than a million Germans crossed the long-standing
harrier between East and West.

BERLIN — After the official announcement of
the opened border here Thursday around 9 p.m.,
drama began to unfold around the Brandenburg
Gate.
Citizens from both East and West began to con
gregate near the gate on their respective sides of
the wall, as the eyes of the world media turned to
the event.
The gate, built in 1789, has been the symbol of
the divided city ever since the wall was constructed.
The gate straddles Unter den Linden, the most
famous street in Berlin, which travels from east to
west.
Unfortunately, the monument now lies in no
man's land, inaccessible to citizens on either side
of the wall.

Berliners chip away at the wall that has divided their city for 28 years.
