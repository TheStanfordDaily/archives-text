# Chicano dean to be selected by day's end
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
After two years of efforts by Latino students
on campus, the new full-time director of El
Centro Chicano will be chosen today, said Char
lene Aguilar, chair of the El Centro Transi
tional Working Group and assistant director
of undergraduate admissions.
On Monday, faculty, students and members
of campus organizations finished a week of
intensive interviews with the five candidates.
Aguilar said that after the weeklong schedule
of interviews and presentations, the Dean
Search Committee, comprised of faculty, staff
and students, will "hash out" the interviewers'
comments.
After the committee makes its decision, the
new director, who will be an assistant dean
of student affairs, must be approved by Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael Jackson. Then
the candidate will be offered the position,
Aguilar said.
The candidates, who were selected from an
applicant pool of 40, include:
• Maria Hernandez, the assistant dean of
Special Programs and coordinator of Hispanic
Student Programs at Saint Mary's College.
Hernandez received a doctorate in community
psychology from the University of Texas at
Austin in 1985, and she was a lecturer at
Saint Mary's and at UC-Berkeley.
• Frances Morales, the training coordinator
at the Multifunctional Resource Center in Oak
land. She attended Stanford from 1975 to 1982
and received a master's degree in anthropology
and a doctorate in education. She was also
executive director of the Community Educa
tion Center in Redwood City.
• Consuelo Trevino, a student development
specialist with the Office of the Dean of Stu
dents at the University of Texas at Austin.
Trevino received a master's in counseling and
guidance at St. Mary's University in San An
tonio, Texas in 1975.
• Jenaro Valdez, an elementary school coun
selor in Santa Barbara. Valdez received a bach
elor's degree in history from UC-Santa Barbara
in 1981 and was also executive
director of the Oxnard-Port
Hueneme Youth Employment
Service from 1984 to 1988.
• Melva Ybarra-Garcia, an un
dergraduate advisor in Chicano
Studies at UC-Berkeley. She re
ceived a master's degree in coun
seling from California State
University at Hayward in 1983
and was a resident fellow at Casa
Zapata from 1979 to 1980.
Aguilar said the decision will
not be an easy one. "We must
decide whose style is best for the
students, the faculty and the com
munity," she said.
The office of full-time director
has been two years in the making,
said Gina Hernandez, a co-chair
of MEChA last year and a member
of the search committee.
At Stanford's Centennial
celebration, the Rainbow Agenda,
a coalition of campus minority
student groups formed in 1987,
presented its request for full-time
directors for all of Stanford's eth
nic community centers. "We chose

that opportunity to raise the issue
of the historic underrepresenta
tion of minorities" on campus,
Hernandez said.
Soon after, the Black Commu
nity Services Center director's po
sition was increased from half
time to full time, and the Asian-
American and Native American
community centers' directors
were given three-quarters-time
positions, she said. The Chi
cano/Latino community center
director's position remained a
half-time job.
Jon Inda, another member of
the search committee, said the ad
ministration had made little prog
ress in creating a full-time dean's
position before the May 15
takeover of President Kennedy's
office. "Nothing had really
moved," Inda said.
The takeover occurred only
after Chicano students had "ex
hausted all their channels," he
said. MEChA was instrumental in
the upgrading of the dean's office,
according to Inda. The week after
the takeover, he said, the admin
istration offered the full-time
dean position to El Centro.
According to Aguilar, there
"was never any question" that the

administration would provide El
Centro with a full-time dean,
though the student protest may
have provided a catalyst.
"The takeover had to do with
a lot of other things, too," Aguilar
said. The full-time dean position
was only one plank in the plat
form of the Agenda for Action,
the group that coordinated the
takeover, she said.
After the administration's deci
sion to hire a full-time dean, a
search committee was created,
Inda said. In early June, 200 Chi
cano students, an unprecedented
number, according to Inda, gath
ered to elect the student members
of the selection committee.
When the resignation of former
part-time director Juan Yniguez
went into effect in September, El
Centro needed a governing body
to overlook the center until a full
time dean could be found, Aguilar
said.

Jackson, with the search com
mittee's approval, appointed a
transitional working group to
handle the "day-to-day operations
of El Centro," said Aguilar, who
was chosen as chair of the group.
The candidates have each had
a full day of interviews and pre
sentations. Their day began with
interviews by the search commit
tee, Jackson, Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons, the
transitional working group and El
Centro student staff, followed by
lunch with directors of the ethnic
community centers.
Staff members from the Office
of Student Affairs, and Latino
staff and students then inter
viewed the candidates. And final
ly, candidates gave public
presentations where they outlined
key issues facing the Latino com
munity at Stanford, their vision
for the community and the proc
ess for building that vision.
