# Quad may access computer network
## 
### Marli Marinelli 
The SUNet computer network,
which provides access to main
frame computer systems, may
soon be extended to buildings in
the Quad if funding can be found.
An Oct. 26 report by the Fac
ulty Senate's Committee on Aca
demic Computing and Infor
mation Systems recommended
that departments in the Quad
should have access to SUNet,
which would pave the way for im
proved research and communica
tion among faculty.
Stanford's many diverse com
puter systems and networks are
unified through SUNet commu
nication network. SUNet links
virtually all of the University into
one channel, with the exception
of the humanities departments in
the Quad.
"What we want to do, what we
hope to do eventually is to enhance
the possibility of research in the
community using computers,"
said Slavic Languages Prof. Rich
ard Schupbach, chair of the com
mittee.
He added that many of SUNet's

benefits will come in the future
when more research and commu
nications tools for humanities
scholars will be developed.
The main advantage of SUNet
linkage is accessibility to pro
grams that are still in the devel
oping stage.
For example, programs that
may be available in the future
include access to worldwide
electronic mail and tools to
analyze text, according to Mal
colm Brown, academic computer
specialist for Academic Informa
tion Resources.
"We're beginning to look into,
in a very experimental way, that
we might be able to facilitate re
search that deals with texts, by
using text analysis tools that
would work over the network,"
Brown said.
Reactions to the committee's
recommendation of SUNet
linkage are mixed. The cost, yet
to be determined, presents an
enormous factor in linking SUNet
through the Quad.
"When SUNet was first put in,
money available at the time only
guaranteed they could build the

freeways ... ideally, the depart
ments would then find the means
to build the on- and off-ramps,"
Schupbach said.
However, the high cost of in
stalling SUNet would drain many
humanities departmental budgets,
especially in the smaller depart
ments.
AIR is presently researching
ways to cover the costs of SUNet
linkage through the Quad, other
wise known as project QUAD
NET. A report on AlR's progress
will be presented at the commit
tee's next meeting.
Two major problems that will
increase the cost are the presence
of asbestos in the Quad and
damage from the Oct. 17 earth
quake, which may cause the di
version of funds from SUNet
linkage to repairs.
While many departments oper
ate successfully without SUNet,
others have improvised, and some
departments desperately need the
linkage. The representative of one
humanities department was un
aware of the fact that SUNet
exists.

Since faculty members in the
Quad currently use computers
mainly for word processing, ad
ministrators may be the first to
reap immediate benefits from
SUNet linkage.
According to Cristen Juencke,
an administrative assistant in the
Classics Department, SUNet
would "give greater access so the
staff wouldn't seem to be over
loaded. More computing would
cut down on work overload, by
allowing access to student records,
time schedules, the Registrar's of
fice, the Dean's office and up-to
date student information."
However, the committee is pri
marily concerned with the aca
demic benefits SUNet would
provide to faculty and students.
"One of the things that would
naturally flow from this ... is the
use by the faculty and the stu
dents. There is no doubt that the
administrators stand to gain a
great deal by it, but it is not with
them in mind that we are doing
what we are doing," Schupbach
said.
