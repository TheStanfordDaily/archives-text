"Aesthetically, it's a great
place to shop, and they have
some very good values
where you wouldn't expect
them. The coffee, for
example, is less expensive at
Whole Foods. You also have
luxuries of choice you don't
get in the average grocery
store. You can pick
something up to serve a
guest on the spur of the
moment. It's a great place for
lunch. And you always know
you're getting something
that's nutritionally sound."
