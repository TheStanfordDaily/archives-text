# Tresidder clerk files grievance over party spat
## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
In response to alleged "harassment and intimida
tion" by management, Tresidder staff member Vic
toria Burnell filed a grievance this week against
Tresidder director Bobbi Braden.
Burnell alleges that a Nov. 3 letter to The Daily
sparked this harassment. In that letter, Burnell
directly challenges statements made by Tresidder
management denying that executive parties con
stituted financial waste.
The grievance was submitted to University Em
ployee Relations on Monday.
Burnell's clerical position in the Tresidder sched
uling office was cut in half last month as a way
for Tresidder management to meet budget con
straints. For the 1988-89 school year, Tresidder
faced a $210,000 deficit.
Although management cut her hours by 50 per
cent, Burnell claims she is still expected to complete
the same amount of work as before the change.
According to Burnell, she has received six to eight
reprimands since the cut in her position for not
finishing her duties.
But Braden said Burnell's claims are unfounded.
Following the cutback in employment hours, Bur
nell's work load was also cut in half, Braden said.
Furthermore, Tresidder is now in the process of
automating Burnell's job, which will also reduce her
total workload, Braden added.
In her grievance, Burnell calls the alleged intim
idation a "serious infringement on my freedom of
speech." She asks Braden to "cease and desist from
the . . . retaliation, harassment and intimidation."
Braden refused to comment on the case during
grievance procedures, in accordance with University
policy. "The employee has a right
to privacy," she said.
Although Burnell is not a mem
ber of the United Stanford
Workers, she became a player in
the union's battle against Tresid
der by addressing the issue of
managerial parties in the Nov. 3
letter.
Last month, the USW cited nu
merous executive parties as an
example of financial mismanage
ment and waste.
Tresidder Assoc. Director Paul

Szczesiul responded to the USW's
charges Oct. 31, saying, "I don't
know anything about any par
ties."
Burnell, who handles the sched
uling of Tresidder events, wrote
her letter contradicting Szczesiul's
statement. Burnell claimed that
management held "at least 10
such parties" and that "Szczesiul
was at each one that I attended."
In a Nov. 6 letter, Braden in
structed Burnell to provide her a
list of the parties with respective
dates. The letter accused Burnell
of "making statements out of con
text."
"If you are going to make public

accusations, you must be willing
to be accountable for those accu
sations by supporting them with
facts," Braden wrote in the letter.
Contending that such duties
were outside her job description,
Burnell insisted in a Nov. 9 writ
ten response to Braden that the
extra burden required a waiver of
her regular duties or extra pay.
When Braden persisted in her
request, Burnell compiled the list
of parties and then filed a griev
ance.
In addition to the cut in Bur
nell's position, the jobs of three
custodial workers have been elim
inated.
