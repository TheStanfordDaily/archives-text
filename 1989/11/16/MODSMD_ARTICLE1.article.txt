# Tresidder clerk files grievance over party spat
## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
In response to alleged "harassment and intimida
tion" by management, Tresidder staff member Vic
toria Burnell filed a grievance this week against
Tresidder director Bobbi Braden.
Burnell alleges that a Nov. 3 letter to The Daily
sparked this harassment. In that letter, Burnell
directly challenges statements made by Tresidder
management denying that executive parties con
stituted financial waste.
The grievance was submitted to University Em
ployee Relations on Monday.
Burnell's clerical position in the Tresidder sched
uling office was cut in half last month as a way
for Tresidder management to meet budget con
straints. For the 1988-89 school year, Tresidder
faced a $210,000 deficit.
Although management cut her hours by 50 per
cent, Burnell claims she is still expected to complete
the same amount of work as before the change.
According to Burnell, she has received six to eight
reprimands since the cut in her position for not
finishing her duties.
But Braden said Burnell's claims are unfounded.
Following the cutback in employment hours, Bur
nell's work load was also cut in half, Braden said.
Furthermore, Tresidder is now in the process of
automating Burnell's job, which will also reduce her
total workload, Braden added.
In her grievance, Burnell calls the alleged intim
idation a "serious infringement on my freedom of
speech." She asks Braden to "cease and desist from
the . . . retaliation, harassment and intimidation."
Braden refused to comment on the case during
grievance procedures, in accordance with University
