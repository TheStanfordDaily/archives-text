# E.German political group will challenge Communist Party
## 
### 
BERLIN (AP) — An East German po
litical group said yesterday it would make
the first direct challenge to Communist
rule by asking Parliament this week to
4nd the party's 40-year-old monopoly on
power, and predicted an easy victory.
; Also yesterday, Communist officials
spurned West Germany's offer of an eco
nomic bailout. They said they prefer their
own course to recovery and hinted at
reforms to encourage free-enterprise in
vestment. —

Bild, a mass-circulation West German
newspaper, reported yesterday that
Chancellor Helmut Kohl would meet with
party chief Egon Krenz after a Commu
nist Party congress Dec. 15-17 that is
expected to make major changes in the
East German leadership.
In West Berlin, hundreds gathered at
the enormous Brandenburg Gate, hoping
the East Germans would break through
the Berlin Wall in front of the 200-year
old "symbol of unity." A West German

television network said up to 7,000 East
German refugees were expected to return
to their homeland.
The East German constitution's guar
antee of a "leading role" for the Com
munist Party will be challenged at Fri
day's sitting of the increasingly
independent-minded Parliament, said
Manfred Gerlach, head of the Liberal
Democratic Party.
It was unclear whether a vote on the
constitutional change would come the

same day.
"I figure it will pass with a large
majority," Gerlach told West Germany's
ARD radio network. His party, once
closely allied with the Communists, has
been at the forefront of calls for change
in East Germany.
The new speaker of Parliament, non-
Communist Guenther Maleuda, on Tues
day urged a constitutional change to allow
a true multiparty-government.
The East German constitution

specifies that constitutional changes
must be approved a majority of the law
makers in the 500-member Parliament,
or People's Chamber.
Despite Gerlach's prediction, a majority
of the chamber is still believed to be
made up of orthodox members likely to
reject the measure.
For weeks, Gerlach has urged the Com
munists to abandon their "leading role,"
but Friday's motion will be thefrrstrdirect
challenge.
