►"♦WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Nicaraguan government has of
•fored a major concession in cease
-fire talks with the Contras by
Stopping its demand that the
'rebels demobilize, a Sandinista of-
said yesterday.
• »As its price for restoring the
fire the government allowed
Ito lapse Nov. 1, Vice Foreign Min
uter Victor Hugo Tinoco said the
government is insisting only that
jv'pntra forces in Nicaragua return
<o their base camps in Honduras.
*"We think that is a very impor
tant change in our position,"
rftnoco told a news conference at
Nicaraguan P>mbassy a few
before the peace talks
lieconvened at the Organization of
•American States.
!Tinoco maintained that while
ittye Sandinistas are willing to
Jlhpke concessions, the Contras
;ftave shown "not an inch of
flexibility" in four rounds of talks
last Thursday at the

United Nations.
There was no immediate re
sponse by the rebels but admin
istration officials said the Contras
have told them evaucation from
Nicaraguan territory is not
feasible.
As part of a cease-fire agree
ment, the rebels would be willing
instead to relocate in designated
"enclaves" in Nicaragua where
their activities could easily be
monitored by international ob
servers, the Contras have told
U.S. officials.
If they return to Honduras, it
is possible they could be prevented
by international monitors from re
turning to Nicaragua, the Contras
have argued.
In addition, they said, since the
Contras are Nicaraguans, it
makes more sense for them to
remain inside their own homeland
rather than in a neighboring
country.
There are an estimated 5,000

rebels in Nicaragua, about 2,000
of whom have infiltrated from the
Honduran base camps in recent
weeks.
Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega declined to renew the cease
fire on Nov. 1, drawing wide
spread international condemna
tion. Secretary of State James A.
Baker 111 said Monday that the
suspension of the truce had
created "a militarized election at
mosphere."
While allowing the truce to
lapse after 19 months, Ortega si
multaneously called for a resump
tion of discussions with the resis
tance.
Hoping to prod the negotiators
toward a settlement were repre
sentatives from the United Na
tions and the Organization of
American States. They are mem
bers of the International Commis
sion for Support and Verification,
which was set up to oversee the
peace process.
