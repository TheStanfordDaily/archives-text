No Mideast progress
WASHINGTON (AP) — An apparently friendly
meeting yesterday between President Bush and
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir failed to
break an impasse on Arab participation in
Mideast peace talks. Shamir blamed Yasser
Arafat's PLO for the delay.
"There are some obstacles that we have to
remove and work out," Shamir said after talking
to Bush for an hour. "It will be a long process.
It will take time. It's not easy."
The Israeli leader, who came to Washington
to register his concerns that the Palestine Lib
eration Organization might get a foot in the door
of the talks, blamed Arafat's group for the im
passe.
"We need some Palestinians with whom we
will have to cooperate and work together in order
to implement this process, including the first
steps," Shamir said in the White House driveway.
Afghan rebels attack
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — More than 1,000

guerrillas have attacked the eastern city of
Jalalabad and are peppering the city with rockets
and heavy artillery, the government said yester
day.
But the Soviet-backed government denied guer
rilla claims of capturing a strategic army stron
ghold in the mountains west of Kabul.
Abortion funding ban
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House complied
yesterday with President Bush's demand to keep
a ban on most federally financed abortions, in
cluding in cases of rape and incest, and abortion
rights leaders said they would take up the battle
again next year.
The House approved on a voice vote a large
appropriations bill that includes abortion lan
guage favored by Bush, limiting federal financing
to abortions for poor women whose lives are
endangered by their pregnancy.
Abortion-rights supporters did not attempt to
change the bill to broaden the circumstances
under which Medicaid would pay for abortions
for poor women, citing procedural restrictions,
and thev did not force a roll-call vote.
