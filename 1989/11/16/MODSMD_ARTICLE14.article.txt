## Grad student abuse 
### 
TIME AND TIME again, stu
dents and faculty have ques
tioned Stanford's commit
ment to academics.
Now Stanford will have to an
swer to yet another group of frus
trated students who feel that the
University has shown little concern
for students' needs.
The University has recently
passed a decision to reduce finan
cial support for first-and second
year graduate students next
summer; Graduate Studies offi
cials have decided to cut the re
search fellowships usually
available to these graduate stu
dents in 10 humanities depart
ments.
The reason for this decision was
that "three or four" previous grad
uate students who received these
fellowships remarked that they
were not conducting the research
they were supposed to.
Surely this was not an adequate

study to judge all of the graduate
students by. Now even those stu
dents who were, in fact, conducting
research with the funds will lose
out because of the mistakes of
others.
By reacting with brash actions
on the basis of a faulty study, the
University appears to be playing
roulette with the budget, as well
as with students' academic lives.
Graduate students who wish to
do research in the summer will
now have to work while at the
same time conducting their regular
research — quite a burden.
Instead of punishing students for
their supposed misuse of the funds,
the Unviersity must seek to make
it clearer what is expected of the
students who receive funds.
At the same time they should
talk to more than three or four
students to find out how the Uni
versity can appropriately satisfy
graduate students' needs.
