STANFORD
usually strives for innova-
JL tion, the University's Legal
Office recently settled for copying.
The office spent several years
negotiating a licensing agreement
several publishing companies
s<y professors could legally make
several copies of published works
for classroom use. In addition to
reducing the faculty's fear of being
slapped with a lawsuit for making
course readers, the agreement pro
vides for greater academic freedom
without being restricted by expen
sive textbook costs.
A lawsuit filed last May by eight
major publishers against Kinko's
Copies for making course readers
created concern at many univer
sities that the freedom to make
photocopies for classroom use
might be limited.

Without the ability to photocopy
excerpts of several course materi
als, professors would have two
choices: force students to bear the
outrageous cost of buying all the
original materials or limit the ed
ucation of students in the class by
cutting back on the breadth of ma
terials available to them.
It's a choice between overexpos
ing students' pocketbooks or un
derexposing students' minds.
Fortunately, Stanford professors
will not have to make that choice.
Especially considering that the
$20,000 annual cost barrier has
been reached, avoiding the poten
tial cost of more books.
Stanford is only the second uni
versity to negotiate such an agree
ment, but the trend should not end
here. There is plenty of room to
copy.
