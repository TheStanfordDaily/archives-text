## A 						more political Stanford 
### 
IN LAST YEAR'S ASSU election, two
distinct camps of thought developed.
On one side was Students First, with
the belief that the ASSU and its people
should refrain from politics. It charged
that these interests in larger causes were
detrimental to the true purpose of student
government. This purpose was to provide
services for students and the Stanford
community without a political direction.
On the other side was the People's
Platform, which claimed that these po
litical convictions gave them the fire and
the enthusiasm to make student govern
ment effective. Through a belief in mul
ticulturalism, progressive thought and
coalition building, the People's Platform
asserted that it knew what students
wanted and had the know how and the
energy to bring it to them.
It's not something new that people
think differently. The new twist wasjthat
now there was a prize that only one
group could have. Naturally, groups of
"us" and "them" came out of the wood
work, as they do in times of adversity.
Well, that was last spring. By now, the
election is long past. The Council of Presi
dents' office has its new people, there's
a whole new slew of senators' name tags
for their meetings. But the election and
all its rhetoric and promises and crusades
are gone. Also gone Eire the fears that
the world is going to crumble if certain
people don't become senators or the COP.
Or are they?
It seems that the party politics that
were the cause for both fear and admira
tion are alive and well here at Stanford.
It may be hidden, squished between other

articles in The Daily or masked in casual
comments between students, but it's there
if you look carefully.
Just lately, there was an actual debate
in our very own senate. The conflict was
over denying funds to student groups.
Supposedly the reason was that the
groups receiving money were partisan,
that is, favored by the People's Platform.
The voting went along party lines, and
luckily, the vote to deny funding didn't
go through.
If you didn't catch that one in last
Friday's Daily, you can see signs of these
party politics in The Stanford Review. I
think that some people have got it in
their heads that its already time to start
preparing for next spring's election.
Every week, in addition to The
Review's normal "I.M. Sports Update,"
"favorite Hoover fellow of the week" and
"counting the ways we hate liberals like
DaVfcl trown'and John Maflley," it seems
that there's something attacking the
People's Platform.
The People's Platform is blamed for
just about anything that's handy, from
the building takeover last spring to com
ments a columnist made two weeks ago.
The point, however, isn't to evoke sym
pathy for any group. The point is that,
like it or not, we've got the start of real
party politics here at Stanford.
People have some sort of preconceived
notion if you identify yourself as People's
Platform or Students First or the Stan
ford Review or the Students of Color
Coalition. Somehow you are instantly
branded with a title. Liberal or conser
vative are the milder terms that come to

mind, racist or radical, activist and fringe
are among the more colorful.
That's not to say that having different
parties is wrong. Much to the contrary,
it seems that having people on the other
side of the fence, making sure that every
thing's up to snuff, is a definite plus,
assuming that they are being level
headed and fair. It's a world of difference
if you're always working from behind,
trying to prove yourself. It's good to have
that watchdog, even if you don't agree
with what it says all the time.
Still, though, it's not right for people
to automatically divide up into the camps
of "us" and "them." It's destructive when
people take it into their minds that
they're the only right people and that
it's their duty to purge the world of
anyone who thinks differently.
Maybe it's the only way to motivate
people, like leaders who mobilize entire
countries to destroy other human lives
because of differences in ideology. Sadly
enough, these political factions may be a
sign that Stanford's politics, like our
selves, are growing up and getting ready
for that "real" world on the other side
of El Camino.

litical convictions gave them the fire and
the enthusiasm to make student govern
ment effective. Through a belief in mul
ticulturalism, progressive thought and
coalition building, the People's Platform
asserted that it knew what students
wanted and had the know how and the
energy to bring it to them.
It's not something new that people
think differently. The new twist wasjthat
now there was a prize that only one
group could have. Naturally, groups of
"us" and "them" came out of the wood
work, as they do in times of adversity.
Well, that was last spring. By now, the
election is long past. The Council of Presi
dents' office has its new people, there's
a whole new slew of senators' name tags
for their meetings. But the election and
all its rhetoric and promises and crusades
are gone. Also gone Eire the fears that
the world is going to crumble if certain
people don't become senators or the COP.
Or are they?
It seems that the party politics that
were the cause for both fear and admira
tion are alive and well here at Stanford.
It may be hidden, squished between other

articles in The Daily or masked in casual
comments between students, but it's there
if you look carefully.
Just lately, there was an actual debate
in our very own senate. The conflict was
over denying funds to student groups.
Supposedly the reason was that the
groups receiving money were partisan,
that is, favored by the People's Platform.
The voting went along party lines, and
luckily, the vote to deny funding didn't
go through.
If you didn't catch that one in last
Friday's Daily, you can see signs of these
party politics in The Stanford Review. I
think that some people have got it in
their heads that its already time to start
preparing for next spring's election.
Every week, in addition to The
Review's normal "I.M. Sports Update,"
"favorite Hoover fellow of the week" and
"counting the ways we hate liberals like
DaVfcl trown'and John Maflley," it seems
that there's something attacking the
People's Platform.
The People's Platform is blamed for
just about anything that's handy, from
the building takeover last spring to com
ments a columnist made two weeks ago.
The point, however, isn't to evoke sym
pathy for any group. The point is that,
like it or not, we've got the start of real
party politics here at Stanford.
People have some sort of preconceived
notion if you identify yourself as People's
Platform or Students First or the Stan
ford Review or the Students of Color
Coalition. Somehow you are instantly
branded with a title. Liberal or conser
vative are the milder terms that come to

mind, racist or radical, activist and fringe
are among the more colorful.
That's not to say that having different
parties is wrong. Much to the contrary,
it seems that having people on the other
side of the fence, making sure that every
thing's up to snuff, is a definite plus,
assuming that they are being level
headed and fair. It's a world of difference
if you're always working from behind,
trying to prove yourself. It's good to have
that watchdog, even if you don't agree
with what it says all the time.
Still, though, it's not right for people
to automatically divide up into the camps
of "us" and "them." It's destructive when
people take it into their minds that
they're the only right people and that
it's their duty to purge the world of
anyone who thinks differently.
Maybe it's the only way to motivate
people, like leaders who mobilize entire
countries to destroy other human lives
because of differences in ideology. Sadly
enough, these political factions may be a
sign that Stanford's politics, like our
selves, are growing up and getting ready
for that "real" world on the other side
of El Camino.
