## University earthquake estimates still unknown 
### 
THE DAILY (Nov. 13) reported
that I "estimated that an assess
ment of damage being conducted
by federal inspectors will cover about
$95 million of the $160 million in
damage suffered on the campus." The
story then goes on to say that "the
federal government is expected to pay
for 75 percent of the $95 million."
Actually, I have taken great pains to
explain that one ought not to take any
previous estimate and crank it into any
simple formula to reach a conclusion
that Stanford will receive or should be
expected to receive a specific amount.
The $160 million damage figure was
a very early estimate prepared in
response to legislative requests for the

best ballpark figure we could come up
with.
The figure was based on a quick,
early examination by Stanford 's facili
ties project management and was
essentially the amount estimated to
repair or replace all damaged buildings
on campus, including buildings, such as
Memorial Church or the unoccupied
Old Chemistry building, that we knew
would not likely be eligible for any
disaster assistance programs. This
estimate also included the cost of doing
such repair or replacement in compli
ance with current building codes.
The $95 million dollar figure is a
subset of the $160 million figure; this
includes only buildings which we be-

lieve may be eligible for disaster relief
assistance. This figure, again, was
prepared at the specific request of
state legislators and the governor's
office. We have always urged caution
in the use of these early, best-guess
estimates and have specifically stated
that these figures do not in any way
constitute a claim.
The plain fact is that neither Stan
ford nor anyone else now knows what
amount of assistance — federal or
state — Stanford will receive or if, in
the end, we will receive anything at
all. Stanford has no blank check for
any amount.
Quite correctly, federal and state
authorities will determine the amount

of damage that is eligible for assis
tance. And even after eligibility is
determined, payment will depend on
the availability of funds.
While we felt obliged to respond to
external requests for preliminary es
timates, we have steadfastly resisted
speculation on the specific amount of
damage that will be determined by
government authorities and the amount
of assistance we might receive.
With respect to the question of how
much government assistance Stanford
might receive, we will simply have to
rest for now on the unsatisfying but
truthful response: We don't know.
