# COP encourages Big Game spirit despite Bonfire loss
## 
### 
We would like to take this opportu
nity to wish everyone an exciting Big
Game week. We hope to see everyone
at Big Game, supporting the Cardinal
football team in their final and most
important game of the year, and at the
Big Splash (11 a.m. on Saturday), to
witness our water polo and football
teams both destroy Berkeley.
Usually the Council of Presidents
doesn't become involved with Big
Game activities, but this year we did
when many students asked us what we
could do to bring back the Bonfire.
Along with the Axe Committee we
tried our best — even enlisting the
support of University President Donald
Kennedy-when we met with him last
week. But in the end, very legitimate
safety concerns prompted the organi
zers to "axe" the Bonfire.

Additionally, we would like to point
out that if the Stanford community
would like to continue the Bonfire
tradition next year, then we should
support the endeavors of the Axe Com
mittee by voting "yes" for their annual
fee request in the spring elections.
It is unfortunate that such a popular
Stanford tradition as the Bonfire won't
be happening this year, but all is cer
tainly not lost. Tonight's rally spon
sored by the Axe Committee should
help us focus our school and team
spirit in giving the football team a big
emotional boost going into this week
end's game.
We hope students had the opportu
nity to attend the Big Sing-off on Mon
day night, and will attend the Big
Game Rally tonight, and Gaieties and
the Big Game Party (with the "Un
touchables") on Friday. These great
events will certainly lend to the spirit
of Big Game.
Finally, we would like to recognize
our new coach Danny Green, and the
fine job he and his team have done
this year. The Cardinal has had some
tough losses this year, but through it

all they have remained strong. We
salute Green and the Cardinal football
team and wish them the best of luck
in Big Game.
