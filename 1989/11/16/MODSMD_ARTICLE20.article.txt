# Intramural injury was tragic, but not isolated incident

### 
Intramural sports director Howard
Dallmar's response (The Daily, Nov.
14) to the tragic accident on the intra
mural fields this last weekend strikes
me as shallow.
While it is true that injuries do hap
pen in contact sports, no one should
have to expect them â€” especially at
the friendly, recreational level of IMs.
Perhaps Greg Smith's irgury was un
avoidable given the nature of football.

but the accident was more than just
"unfortunate."
Furthermore, I believe that as IM
director, Dallmar has the responsibility
of employing every opportunity for
safety. There is no reason IM football
should be so heavily contact-oriented if
players are not offered the same
protection varsity athletes receive.
The down-side of IM football is the
simple fact that there are people who
play the game as aggressively as if
they were wearing a helmet and pads.
Perhaps the IM program can work
on helping the referees to make sure
that unnecessary roughness will not be
tolerated. How about changing the
sport to flag football, which at least
makes the focus of a tackle something
other than the human body?
I strongly believe that 18 IM-related
injuries cannot be brushed off with a
casual air. Dallmar should not be so
content to ask, "Why should we change
because of one incident?", but rather
"What am I doing right now to try
and make IMs safer for everyone?"
