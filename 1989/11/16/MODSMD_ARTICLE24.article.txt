## Quick Card women pursue repeat title 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
There have been two prevalent rules in
sports in the 1980s. The first is that ath
letes want to get paid a lot of money to
do their stuff. The second is that it is very
difficult to repeat as champions.
While the first doesn't apply to college
athletics, usually, the Stanford women's
swim team will get the chance to test the
second when it opens its season today. The
defending NCAA Champions travel to
Berkeley to meet California in the annual
double-distance meet.
The meet, which begins at 1 p.m. at
Spieker Pool, enables both teams to swim
against real competition instead of going
against the same people in practice every
day. It will not count in the teams' records,
however, and the results don't mean a
great deal in the grand scheme of the
season.
"We look at it as a training type of meet,"
Stanford Coach Richard Quick said. "It's
good to race (another school)."
If anyone can guide the Cardinal to
repeat national titles, it is Quick. He won

five consecutive NCAA Championships at
Texas before coming to Stanford before
last season. Thus he has been the winning
coach at the last six NCAA meets, but
despite the large number of talented vet
erans and an outstanding recruiting class,
Quick doesn't think No. 1 will come easily.
"We're in real good position," he said,
"[but Texas] has a real, real good team.
We'll have our hands full with that chal
lenge."
The returnees include defending NCAA
400 individual medley champ Michelle
Griglione and a host of All-Americans.
