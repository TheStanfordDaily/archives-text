# Stanford seniors will enjoy Big Game Bear-bashing
## 
### 
This column is written and dedicated
to Alan Grant, Jim Price, Scott Eschel
man, Rob Englehardt, Lester Archam
beau, Bruce Lang, Rob Hinckley and
Andy Papathanassiou, the fifth-year sen
iors who, along with me, will be playing
in their last Big Game this Saturday.

Dear fifth-years:
At some point in our careers,
we have all heard the cliche, "Play
every down like it is going to be your
last."
This football proverb was never more
pertinent than it is right now, as we
collectively stare our last game in the
face.
We all heard the same recruiting pitch.
"Stanford offers the true student-athlete
the best of both worlds: a first-class ed
ucation, with a chance to play foot
ball in' pacific 10 Conference." As
wide-eyed recruits, we signed our letters
of intent and elevated our expectations.
We came to The Farm for a myriad of
reasons. Some of us wanted to get away
from the snow on the East Coast, and
others wanted to stay close to home in
the Bay Area. However, all of us came
here with one thing in common: we

wanted to re-establish a winning football
program at Stanford.
In the fall of '85, we showed up, both
eager and apprehensive. We were all ex
cited to be a part of the glamour of college
football, but we were a little afraid of
the challenge.
All of us were humbled during those
first early practices. After coming from
high school programs where each of us
starred, it was disheartening to be placed
on the scout team where we were the
meat on which the starters chewed. But,
by the end of that season the starters
knew that we weren't sirloin, but for
midable players who could play the game.
Now we face the end of another season.

Looking at our record over the last five
years, not too many people would say
that we have reached our goal of regain
ing the winning tradition here.
That's what makes this Big Game so
special. We have one last chance to show
86,000 people our ability. A lot of players
â™¦ tend to get sentimental and sad when
they compete in their last game. They
allow a lot of depressing emotions to seep
into their heads before the game, and
play it with a sense of lamentation.
It seems to me that we have a choice.
Instead of being sad about our finale,
let's go out and celebrate it.
We should be wilder and more relaxed
leading up to this game than we have
ever been before. If we play as hard as
we can, celebrating each block, each
tackle, and each catch, then I have no
doubt that we will walk off the field with
the Axe in our hands on Saturday.
After these five years, we have more
losses than wins on our record, but I
challenge anybody to find a loser among
us.
I can't wait for Saturday. When I look
into your eyes in the locker before the
game, I'll see every reason why I wanted

It will be an immense
honor to play this Big
Game with you guys.
Let's beat the Dirty
Golden Bear, let's keep
the Axe, and let's cele
brate!

to play college football. I'll see determi
nation, strength and courage. None of us
will know the result of the game and
therein lies the thrill.
It is the greatest part of competitive
athletics. You never are sure of the out
come and you always have to prove your
self. If you win one week, you have to
prove that you are a quality team the
next week. If you lose, there is always a
chance to redeem yourself either next
week or next year.
Well, we are out of next weeks and
next years, so we have this one game to

prove to ourselves that we are a quality
unit. The things which don't matter
won't be around. We will be isolated from
all of the awards (not that I have any),
the newspaper clippings and the atten
tion.
We will be alone, some of us quiet,
some of us shouting. There won't be
anyone on whom to rely except each other.
For one last time we can build up that
pre-game fury and let it spread to every
one around us.
This is a large step in most of our
lives. After Saturday, most of us are no
longer going to be able to call ourselves
football players.
So take a minute out of the usual
routine and appreciate all of our experi
ences. Before they meld into one lumpy
memory, let's experience a high Saturday
which is unlike anv other.
You guys are tfiF i, YeasoTr""T <\lme to
Stanford. I'll take my Gatoii, ftowl ring
and my English degree with me, but what
I'll cherish is my friendship with you. It
will be an immense honor to play this
Big Game with you guys. Let's beat the
Dirty Golden Bear, let's keep the Axe,
and let's celebrate!
I love you guys.
