# Stanford battles Bears in Big Swim
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
After leaving defending national
champion Texas struggling to stay
afloat in the wake of last Satur
day's commanding 67-46 dual
meet victory, the Stanford men's
swimming team will join the Big
Game festivities with a double
distance meet against California
today at 2 p.m.
"We view it as a fun meet,"
Coach Skip Kenney said. "It's an
opportunity to take advantage of
the Big Game hoopla and get in
a healthy competition between
Stanford and Cal."
In the past, this meet has
preceded the regular season dual
meets and has provided the swim
teams with a change of pace from
the drudgery of early-season
workouts. Reflecting the longer
distance workouts that the ath
letes go through in the preseason,
the meet doubles the normal
length of the races, and the swim
mers select the event in which
they would prefer to race.
"My main goal is to swim faster

than I did last year at this meet,"
sophomore Jeff Rouse said. "It's
not a real serious meet. I just
want to swim fast and see what
I can do."
Rouse, the defending NCAA
champion in the 200 backstroke,
showed glimpses of what he could
do this year against Texas. In his
first 200 backstroke competition
of the year, Rouse qualified for
the NCAA Championships with a
strong 1:48.31 time.

"Our goal this season is to get
more guys qualified for NCAAs
before Pac-lOs," Kenney said.
"The back-to-work mindset that
the team has exhibited since
Texas shows that we have a lot
of maturity in knowing what we
need to do."
According to Kenney, much of
the team stayed voluntarily after
Monday's practice to work on in
dividual techniques that they and
the coaches had noticed in the

films from the Texas meet.
"As a team we are a lot further
ahead than last year," Rouse said.
"We have been able to gel together
a lot faster."
Stanford (1-0) will ride the mo
mentum of the victory over the
Longhorns into today's double dis
tance races. Cal (0-1), on the other
hand, is recovering from a close
opening season 58-55 defeat to the
Longhorns.
