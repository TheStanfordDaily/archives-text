# Greeks want decision
## Suspension investigations delayed by quake 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
For a month now, the fates of two Greek
organizations have hung in limbo.
And while Interfraternity Council Pres
ident Todd Ortega questions the lengthy
suspensions of both groups, University of
ficials say they are following standard
policy and that their investigations have
been hampered by the recent earthquake.
Upon the discovery that a drunk fresh
man was hit by a truck after reportedly
leaving a Sept. 29 Phi Delta Theta frater
nity party, the University on Oct. 4 placed
the Phi Delts on social suspension pending
investigation. On Oct. 17, the Pi Beta Phi
sorority was also suspended, pending in
vestigations into alcohol-related incidents.
The University has yet to make a decision
on either case.
Ortega said that part of "due process"
should be giving the accused a "speedy,
fair hearing."
The Phi Delt suspension is "lasting too
long and [is] inappropriate to begin with,"
Ortega said.
The incident that led to the suspension
was "tragic but accidental," so the suspen
sion does not seem fair, he said. "It's like
putting the cart before the horse."
Calling the Phi Delt house a "dangerous
place," Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said the suspension is reasonable,
given the severity of the incident.
"We are stopping it because a student
almost lost his life. Phi Delts i3 a high-risk
house and the risk of death grew out of
one of their parties, said Lyons.
Under current University policy, a fra
ternity or sorority can be placed on social
suspension before officials complete an in
vestigation, according to Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Diana Conklin.

'We are stopping it be
cause a student almost
lost his life. Phi Delts is
a high-risk house.'

Conklin said officials weigh the possibil
ity of the event repeating itself and the
risk involved with a recurrence before de
ciding whether to place the group on
suspension during the investigation.
The decision is "a judgment call" made
by Lyons and Norm Robinson and Michael
Jackson, both associate deans of student
affairs. Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes also gives input, Conklin said.
This decision-making policy is no differ
ent than that used in past years, she said.
Last year, however, the University did
not suspend the Phi Delts until after a
weeklong investigation found their
Kamikaze Party to be overly focused on
alcohol.
According to Lyons, "A judgment was
made that the risk was not sufficient" to
put the fraternity on suspension during
last year's investigation.
Expressing satisfaction with officials'
handling of her sorority's suspension, Pi
Phi President Pyeatt Gravely said "Hughes
did the best job he could . . . and he sin
cerely tried" to work efficiently and gather
relevant information. Jackson also is "doing
his best," she said.
Phi Delt President Parker Blackman said
house members have been
"frustrated" by the lengthy
suspension but realize that the
earthquake set back University
administrators.
Saying that fraternity members
"are hanging in there" and that
"morale is a lot better than last
year," Blackman added that his
group has a better attitude than
past members.
In 1986, the Phi Delts also faced
a suspension after an investiga
tion of a party. The fraternity was

suspended for violating the Uni
versity noise policy at one of its
parties.
Suspension "lets the group take
time out from social programming
so it can identify the glitch in the
program," Hughes said.
However, Ortega argued that
the Phi Delt suspension is "ruin
ing house morale. [Fraternity
members] wanted to have an all-
Phi Delt bowling night and this
wasn't allowed."
The University has allowed
both the Phi Delts and the Pi
Phis to hold initiations.
Based on his investigations,

Hughes has drawn up reports de
termining the facts, relevant
policy and analysis of the situp.
tions. On Oct. 27, Hughes sub
mitted his report on the Phi Delts
to Student Affairs, which received
the Pi Phi report Nov. 6, Hughes
said.
The Phi Delt report then came
back to Hughes, who resubmitted
it Tuesday He said the new report
has additions that will "put the
incidents in a historical context,"
examine whether there are recur
ring problems and discuss what
is going to be done to fix them.
Hughes is still waiting for a re
sponse to the Pi Phi report.

nity party, the University on Oct. 4 placed
the Phi Delts on social suspension pending
investigation. On Oct. 17, the Pi Beta Phi
sorority was also suspended, pending in
vestigations into alcohol-related incidents.
The University has yet to make a decision
on either case.
Ortega said that part of "due process"
should be giving the accused a "speedy,
fair hearing."
The Phi Delt suspension is "lasting too
long and [is] inappropriate to begin with,"
Ortega said.
The incident that led to the suspension
was "tragic but accidental," so the suspen
sion does not seem fair, he said. "It's like
putting the cart before the horse."
Calling the Phi Delt house a "dangerous
place," Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said the suspension is reasonable,
given the severity of the incident.
"We are stopping it because a student
almost lost his life. Phi Delts i3 a high-risk
house and the risk of death grew out of
one of their parties, said Lyons.
Under current University policy, a fra
ternity or sorority can be placed on social
suspension before officials complete an in
vestigation, according to Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Diana Conklin.

'We are stopping it be
cause a student almost
lost his life. Phi Delts is
a high-risk house.'

Conklin said officials weigh the possibil
ity of the event repeating itself and the
risk involved with a recurrence before de
ciding whether to place the group on
suspension during the investigation.
The decision is "a judgment call" made
by Lyons and Norm Robinson and Michael
Jackson, both associate deans of student
affairs. Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes also gives input, Conklin said.
This decision-making policy is no differ
ent than that used in past years, she said.
Last year, however, the University did
not suspend the Phi Delts until after a
weeklong investigation found their
Kamikaze Party to be overly focused on
alcohol.
According to Lyons, "A judgment was
made that the risk was not sufficient" to
put the fraternity on suspension during
last year's investigation.
Expressing satisfaction with officials'
handling of her sorority's suspension, Pi
Phi President Pyeatt Gravely said "Hughes
did the best job he could . . . and he sin
cerely tried" to work efficiently and gather
relevant information. Jackson also is "doing
his best," she said.
Phi Delt President Parker Blackman said
house members have been
"frustrated" by the lengthy
suspension but realize that the
earthquake set back University
administrators.
Saying that fraternity members
"are hanging in there" and that
"morale is a lot better than last
year," Blackman added that his
group has a better attitude than
past members.
In 1986, the Phi Delts also faced
a suspension after an investiga
tion of a party. The fraternity was

suspended for violating the Uni
versity noise policy at one of its
parties.
Suspension "lets the group take
time out from social programming
so it can identify the glitch in the
program," Hughes said.
However, Ortega argued that
the Phi Delt suspension is "ruin
ing house morale. [Fraternity
members] wanted to have an all-
Phi Delt bowling night and this
wasn't allowed."
The University has allowed
both the Phi Delts and the Pi
Phis to hold initiations.
Based on his investigations,

Hughes has drawn up reports de
termining the facts, relevant
policy and analysis of the situp.
tions. On Oct. 27, Hughes sub
mitted his report on the Phi Delts
to Student Affairs, which received
the Pi Phi report Nov. 6, Hughes
said.
The Phi Delt report then came
back to Hughes, who resubmitted
it Tuesday He said the new report
has additions that will "put the
incidents in a historical context,"
examine whether there are recur
ring problems and discuss what
is going to be done to fix them.
Hughes is still waiting for a re
sponse to the Pi Phi report.
