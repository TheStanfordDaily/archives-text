# Wrestlers grapple feeble Notre Dame
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
Collegiate wrestling has
rarely been regarded one of the
more graceful sports.
When Coach Chris Horpel of
the Stanford wrestling team
describes an upcoming match
as "a rude awakening" for the
opponent, though, you know it's
not going to be pretty.
For the Cardinal, tonight's
match against the College of
Notre Dame at Burnham Pa
vilion, formerly Old Pavilion,
is definitely being viewed as
preparation.
Notre Dame, located in San
Mateo, could only produce op
ponents for three out of 10
weight classes. As a result, even
the three Stanford wrestlers
who are scheduled for matches
are finding it difficult to get
mentally prepared for their
bouts.
"It's hard to get up for this
match," co-captain Steve
Buddie said, "but it will be nice
to get one under my belt."
Buddie, who qualified for the
NCAA tournament last year, is
scheduled to wrestle tonight in
the 177-pound weight class.
"It's important in wrestling
to take one day at a time. But
I've set my goals so high for
this year that often I find
myself thinking of the next
match on the schedule." Buddie
hopes to achieve All-American
status in this year's NCAA
tournament.
Undoubtedly, Notre Dame is
not one of the Cardinal's more
formidable opponents. "They
had a lot of the problems of a

first-year progTam," Horpel ex
plained. "They originally
recruited 15 athletes, but be
cause of injuries and financial
problems, they have ended up
with a much smaller group."
Rounding out the Cardinal
roster tonight will be junior
James Dinette in the 150-
pound weight class and sopho
more Mark Graham in the
167-pound weight class.
However, instead of letting
the few matches deter the dual
meet, Horpel opted to schedule
intra-squad challenge matches
for tonight as well.
"This way," Horpel said, "a
lot of the team members can
get some competition experi
ence, in a non-practice situa
tion."
In intra-squad competition,
freshman Lance Johnson will
wrestle senior Josh Lisle for a
spot on the varsity team.
Johnson, who placed first in
Oregon state competition last
year, has already beaten Lisle
once this year. A win tonight
would earn Johnson a spot for
Stanford's upcoming road trip.
Other matches scheduled for
tonight include freshman Josh
Fleming against sophomore
Dave Nowick, and senior Trent
Smith against co-captain Ron
Perry.
For the Cardinal, setting the
sights on other upcoming
matches is an easy trap to fall
into. Over the Thanksgiving
weekend, Stanford goes up
against Portland State, return
ing national champions in Di
vision 11, and Oregon, currently
ranked second in the Pac-10
and No. 17 nationally.
