# Big Game will thrill, chill the fans
## Portable lights allow for televised game and extended tailgating 
### Nat Cousins Editorial staff 
For Coach Denny Green's Cardinal football team,
playing under the lights in Stanford Stadium may
be the shakeup Stanford needs to win Saturday's
Big Game.
Instead of a traditional sunny-afternoon 1 p.m.
start, the 92nd Big Game will kick off at 3:30 p.m.
and will be played under portable lights erected
around the Stadium.
Saturday's game will be broadcast locally and in
Northern California on the Pacific Sports Network,
available locally on cable channel 65. The late
afternoon kickoff was scheduled to accomodate the
cable broadcast.
Saturday's 3:30 start will be the latest in the
history of the Big Game, which began in 1892.
The late start will allow fans extended tailgate
time, but it will also cause the second half to be
played under significantly cooler weather conditions.
Lights will also be added in the parking lots to
increase safety and ease post-game traffic conges
tion, which may be increased because of the dark
ness.
Ticket office officials yesterday said that the Big
Game was sold out, predicting a crowd of 84,600.
Tickets for seats in the first five rows on each
sideline were not sold, reducing the capacity from
86,000.
However, approximately 200 tickets were still
available yesterday by contacting Bass/Ticketmaster.
For the Big Game, tickets are divided between
Stanford and Cal, with the Golden Bear boosters
granted 37,000 seats in Stanford Stadium.
Of course, playing the game at night probably
won't have much impact on the outcome of the
game, but in the Big Game, anything can happen.
Stanford is 0-3 in 1989 playing under the lights,
including last week's 30-22 defeat to Arizona State
in Tempe, Ariz. But a change to night football may
give Stanford some wacky sort of Big Game edge
in a series filled with strange plays and bizarre
endings.
Saturday won't be the first time that Stanford
has played under portable lights at Stanford Sta
dium. In 1984 Southern Cal defeated the Cardinal
20-11 in a late-afternoon game.
Stanford holds an overall edge of 43-37-11 in the
Big Game, including a 3-1-1 advantage in the last
five meetings. Going back to 1980 Stanford and
Cal are tied 4-4-1, so whichever team wins the 92nd
edition will win the decade. Stanford's record in the
past 28 Big Games is 18-9-1.
In the last Big Game at Stanford, 1987, Stanford
thrashed the Bears 31-7. California has not had
the Axe since 1986.
Big Game notes
Trumpet-toting Weenies from the Cal band invaded
campus early Wednesday morning, but were repelled back
to Berkeley by a vicious band of tomato-throwing Wilbur
minutemen.

Although the Bears are riding a two-game win streak, the Tree is favored in a scheduled
12-round bantamweight fight with Oski under the lights at Stanford Stadium.
