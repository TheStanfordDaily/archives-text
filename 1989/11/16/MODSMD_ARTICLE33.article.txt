FRANKFURT, West Ger
many (AP) — Four West Ger
man sites are willing to drop
out of the running for the 2004
Olympics to clear the way for
a bid by East and West Berlin,
a West German official said
yesterday.
Among the West German
sites that had expressed inter
est in holding the games were
Frankfurt, Hamburg, the Ruhr
Valley and Stuttgart.
"All have said they would
drop out of contention if Berlin
applies to host the Olympics,"
said Wolfram Kratzat,
Frankfurt's top Olympics proj
ect director.
Manfred Seeger, West Ger
many's national Olympic Com
mittee spokesman, said East
Germany's lifting of travel re
strictions made a Berlin Games
a possibility.
"The main problem was the
(Berlin) Wall, and that problem
is now gone," Seeger said. "But
we must still wait and see how
the situation develops in the
German Democratic Republic
(East Germany)."
East German officials, in a
dramatic move permitting its
citizens freedom of travel to the
West on Nov. 9, opened the
Berlin Wall and sections of bor
der barriers to West Germany.
The unexpected development
in relations between the two
German states has spurred
speculation about holding the
2004 Olympics in Germany's
former capital.
Willie Daume, National
Olympic Committee president,
said the signs were encourag
ing.
"These plans have been
around for a long time,"
Daume said. "Even (former)
U.S. President (Ronald)
Reagan said that Berlin should
hold the Olympics. The chances
are better now after all that
has happened."
But Daume, who has beer.
West Germany's Olympic Com
mittee president since 1961 and

has been a longtime proponent
of holding the Olympics in Ber
lin, cautioned against hurried
optimism. "A lot can happen
in the next 15 years," he said.
Asked about the prospects of
West Germany and East Ger
many forming a single German
Olympic team, Daume said:
"That is absolutely not a theme
because of political develop
ments since 1946. There are
now two separate Germanys."
Holding the Games in Berlin
also has the backing of Inter
national Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio
Samaranch.
Samaranch was quoted in
the French sports daily
L'Equipe yesterday as saying
that for Berlin to host the
Games "is no longer a Utopian
ideal."
"This idea (of Berlin) is ap
pealing because it is a symbol
of peace even if between now
and then there are many
changes in the present day sit
uation," L'Equipe quoted
Samaranch as saying.
If the Games are to be held
in Berlin, it would take the
agreement of both East Berlin
and West Berlin officials to
make it work.
West Berlin Mayor Walter
Momper's Olympic advisor, Ul
rich Eggestein, said the Games
would be discussed soon by
Momper and East Germany's
new premier, Hans Modrow.
"Now that the Wall is no
longer an obstacle, the chances
are greater," Eggestein said.
Berlin hosted the Olympics
in 1936, when Jesse Owens of
the United States won four
gold medals in the face of Nazi
leader Adolf Hitler's "Aryan"
theories on white supremacy.
Owens, a black, set world
records in the broad jump (now
the long jump) and the 200-
meter dash and tied the world
record in the 100 meters. His
fourth gold medal came in the
400-meter relay.
