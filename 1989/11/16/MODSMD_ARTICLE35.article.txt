They're loud. They're sort of ugly and they dress
themselves real funny. That's right — they are the one,
the only, the Leland Stanford Junior (pause) University
Marching Band.
Known across the country for their irreverent perform
ances, the Band is a collection of approximately 100
undergraduate and 15 graduate students with a single^

mission — having fun.
The band was not always as fun as it is
today. In 1928, the Band was known as the
Stanford University Military Band, and the
all-male band members wore silly military
uniforms.
In 1963, however, the band staged a coup,
discarded their military uniforms and demanded
independence. The doffed their polyester and
And they have fun by making
music. But they don't play just
any type of music. They play rock
'n' roll — and they play it in a
major way.
Like many other college rock
bands, the Band plays all the hot
test hits — Phil Collins' "Illegal
Alien," U2's "Desire," Guns 'N
Roses' "Paradise City," Van
Halen's "You Really Got Me" —
to name just a few.
But instead of having a couple
guitars, a lead singer and a drum
mer, the Band is divided into eight
separate groups: bonz (trombones),
tenrz (tenor saxophones), altoz
(alto saxophones), tubez (tubas),
mellz (mellophones), drumz,
clair/pix (clarinets and piccolos)
and trumpz (trumpets).
Keeping this motley entourage
of boisterous individuals under
something resembling control dur
ing half-time shows and other
public appearances is no easy task.
As such, it is no surprise to find
that this job falls upon the
shoulders of perhaps the loudest
and worst-dressed member of this
musical juggernaut, drum major
Kai Keasey, a senior in mechanical
engineering.
Dressed in his pink tu-tu and
lycra ensembles, Keasey chooses
which songs the Band plays from

their 700 arrangement repertoire.
He also makes sure that the Band
sounds good by blowing his whistle
and from time to time waving a
big stick at them.
Since there have been some
complaints in the past that the
Band always plays the same old
songs, Keasey has spent his year
as drum major "really trying to
introduce new music."
And his efforts have met with
much success. Of the 60 to 80
different songs that the Band
played this season, over a dozen
of them were new.
The Band has performed a new
arrangement every week this quar
ter. With these rookie songs under
their collective belt, the Band is
sounding better than ever.
Keasey is not alone at the top,
however. He receives some useful
assistance and direction from band
manager Jon Sherman (senior, Eng
lish), assistant manager Lindakay
Brow (senior, communication),
graphics coordinators Chris Adam
son (senior, English and symbolic
systems) and Justin Adams
(senior, economics and political
science).
And it's just about time for the
traditional pose-Big Game selection
of new leaders.. Every year on the
day after Big Game, the assistant
manager becomes the manager and
chooses the leaders of the band for
the next year.
Although the Band show some
times resembles little else than

semi-organized chaos, a lot of
time, preparation and effort goes
into planning what takes place on
the field.
The long process starts at rehear
sal Monday night two weeks before
the show is to be performed. After
the Band reviews the previous per
formance on video tape, drum
major Keasey leads them through
a rehearsal of about a dozen of
their songs.
The graphics coordinators,
Adamson and Adams, then hold
SMUT, Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers. During SMUT, various
creative band members come up
with several formations with a
common theme.
Those present vote on the sug
gestions, and the winning idea gets
transformed from preliminary
scratchings on paper to a real life
half-time show.
The graphics coordinators decide
which sections should go where in
each formation and how the sec
tions should move from formation
to formation. Meanwhile, the
drum major decides which songs
should be played during each
formation and at what point during
the song the formations should
change. After two field rehearsals
on Wednesday and Friday before
the show, the Band is ready to
present the finished product.

You can hear the Band in concert
this Saturday at the Stanford Sta
dium.

The long process starts at rehear
sal Monday night two weeks before
the show is to be performed. After
the Band reviews the previous per
formance on video tape, drum
major Keasey leads them through
a rehearsal of about a dozen of
their songs.
The graphics coordinators,
Adamson and Adams, then hold
SMUT, Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers. During SMUT, various
creative band members come up
with several formations with a
common theme.
Those present vote on the sug
gestions, and the winning idea gets
transformed from preliminary
scratchings on paper to a real life
half-time show.
The graphics coordinators decide
which sections should go where in
each formation and how the sec
tions should move from formation
to formation. Meanwhile, the
drum major decides which songs
should be played during each
formation and at what point during
the song the formations should
change. After two field rehearsals
on Wednesday and Friday before
the show, the Band is ready to
present the finished product.

You can hear the Band in concert
this Saturday at the Stanford Sta
dium.

Feeling lost? It probably won't help you to follow senior Kai Keasey, the Band's drum major, unless
you are looking for some helpful fashion guidance.
They're loud. They're sort of ugly and they dress
themselves real funny. That's right — they are the one,
the only, the Leland Stanford Junior (pause) University
Marching Band.
Known across the country for their irreverent perform
ances, the Band is a collection of approximately 100
undergraduate and 15 graduate students with a single^

mission — having fun.
The band was not always as fun as it is
today. In 1928, the Band was known as the
Stanford University Military Band, and the
all-male band members wore silly military
uniforms.
In 1963, however, the band staged a coup,
discarded their military uniforms and demanded
independence. The doffed their polyester and
And they have fun by making
music. But they don't play just
any type of music. They play rock
'n' roll — and they play it in a
major way.
Like many other college rock
bands, the Band plays all the hot
test hits — Phil Collins' "Illegal
Alien," U2's "Desire," Guns 'N
Roses' "Paradise City," Van
Halen's "You Really Got Me" —
to name just a few.
But instead of having a couple
guitars, a lead singer and a drum
mer, the Band is divided into eight
separate groups: bonz (trombones),
tenrz (tenor saxophones), altoz
(alto saxophones), tubez (tubas),
mellz (mellophones), drumz,
clair/pix (clarinets and piccolos)
and trumpz (trumpets).
Keeping this motley entourage
of boisterous individuals under
something resembling control dur
ing half-time shows and other
public appearances is no easy task.
As such, it is no surprise to find
that this job falls upon the
shoulders of perhaps the loudest
and worst-dressed member of this
musical juggernaut, drum major
Kai Keasey, a senior in mechanical
engineering.
Dressed in his pink tu-tu and
lycra ensembles, Keasey chooses
which songs the Band plays from

their 700 arrangement repertoire.
He also makes sure that the Band
sounds good by blowing his whistle
and from time to time waving a
big stick at them.
Since there have been some
complaints in the past that the
Band always plays the same old
songs, Keasey has spent his year
as drum major "really trying to
introduce new music."
And his efforts have met with
much success. Of the 60 to 80
different songs that the Band
played this season, over a dozen
of them were new.
The Band has performed a new
arrangement every week this quar
ter. With these rookie songs under
their collective belt, the Band is
sounding better than ever.
Keasey is not alone at the top,
however. He receives some useful
assistance and direction from band
manager Jon Sherman (senior, Eng
lish), assistant manager Lindakay
Brow (senior, communication),
graphics coordinators Chris Adam
son (senior, English and symbolic
systems) and Justin Adams
(senior, economics and political
science).
And it's just about time for the
traditional pose-Big Game selection
of new leaders.. Every year on the
day after Big Game, the assistant
manager becomes the manager and
chooses the leaders of the band for
the next year.
Although the Band show some
times resembles little else than

semi-organized chaos, a lot of
time, preparation and effort goes
into planning what takes place on
the field.
The long process starts at rehear
sal Monday night two weeks before
the show is to be performed. After
