# The 						'Don' of a new age

Editor's note: The following column was
confiscated by Stanford Police from a UC-
Berkeley senior majoring in English. The
Weenie, whose name is being withheld, was
arrested at the 1989 Gaieties dress
rehearsal on Tuesday night. According
to Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington, the Cal student had
apparently been sent to destroy
this year's Gaieties production
by stealing the plot and sub
sequently analyzing it to death.
This year's Gaieties production, "Don of
the Dead," provides viewers with a rare look
at the troubled collective psyche of Stanford
students. The fundamental elements of the
show — orchestral score, musical stage num
bers, dialogue and plot — interweave to form
a fragmented tapestry whose warp and woof
demonstrate the warped attitudes which
prevail on the Farm.
For one thing, students seem
to suffer from a phallic fixation.
Granted their / tower is
bigger, thicker and longer
than ours, but must dom
mate their minds as well as their
skyline? The humor of "Don of the Dead"
is penetrated by references to this oversized
organ of conservativism.
Is it any wonder that Stanford men are
unwilling to take the risk of going on a date,
when they live under the shadow of such a
potent symbol?
As large as the tower looms in the 1989
Gaieties production, it cannot overshadow
other troubled and troubling themes. The
plot of "Don of the Dead" reveals the Farm
folks' fascination with the macabre. From
the minds of students who dance upon their
founders' graves has come this Faustian tale
|Of*i man who sells — and the j|ic4

he pays to get it back.
Although not every scene in Gaieties
relates to the plot, an ominous mood lurks
always beneath the dialogue and music, sur
facing first in one character, then another.
The displaced Brannerite's amused reaction
to the horrible disfigurement and death of
a hapless Orientation Volunteer is reminis
cent of the soulless Sweeney Todd.
Too, the merciless Alice Puston takes a
sadistic pleasure in torturing a young man
until he loses his libido and is reduced to
a quivenng mass of useless flesh.
It is to the credit of the writers that the
villainess Puston meets a fitting end; her
demise recalls that of Margaret Hamilton,
the Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939
MGM film "The Wizard of Oz." Would that
the wnters of this year's show had borrowed
more from that classic production! Stanford's
"Don of the Dead" instead borrows some of
its central images from the fleeting world of
pop video culture.
Viewing this year's Gaieties, one is im
mediately impressed by the influence of tele
vision on the liquefied minds of Stanford
students. They are obsessed with entertain
ment personalities, from the prattling Phil
Donahue to the chic, shallow, besequined
Michael Jackson. Bits and pieces of the
dialogue harken to such mindless television
shows as "Family Feud," "Yogi Bear" and
"Scooby Doo."
Too, Gaieties has not escaped the influ
ence of the music video. In one compelling
scene, "Robert Palmer girls" appear from
nowhere to provide backup motions for the
aggrandized gesticulations of the black-clad
man who dominates them — and, appar
ently, the minds of Stanford students —
with his grating voice.
His warbling is accompanied by an eclectic
orchestral ensemble. Listening to the A
orchestra's overture, for example,
one can hear echoes of "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind" and
"Jesus Christ Superstar."
And in the show itself, whole
scenes are devoted to parodies of
television programs from "thir
tysomething" to "Mission: Impos
sible".

The latter scene features Stan
ford's Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions, Jean Fetter (irreverently
known amongst the student body
as "Dean Jean.")
Although I bear a personal
grudge against Ms. Fetter for her
refusal to admit me to the Farm,
I cannot help but applaud her
steely performance. The Welsh
born physicist-turned-thespian,
who grew up a few miles from Sir
Richard Burton's birthplace,
delivers her lines with a deliberate

ness that is truly endearing.
To be sure, tne appearance of
such Stanford favorites as Dean
Jean and Ms. Dean Seldomridge
(of Stanford Bookstore fame) could
have redeemed "Don of the Dead"
from the morass of post
earthquake angst into which it des
cends. But the resolution of the
plot spells disaster for...

Well, folks, that's all the Weenie
wrote. What an anal-retentive,
hyper-literary snob!
