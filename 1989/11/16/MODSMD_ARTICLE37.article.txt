# Come and set it: custom-built advice on respect, firm buttocks
## 
### 
Today we are going to talk about sex,
which means all you techie majors can
tune in again next week.
Ha ha ha. I'm kidding, of course. Most
of the techies I know have their sex lives
firmly in hand.
The fact that we can even discuss sex
here in a frank, open manner is a tribute
to how far newspapers have come. Before
the era of Dr. Ruth, people wanting anon
ymous sex advice had only Ann Landers
to turn to:
Dear Ann Landers,
My husband (I'll call him "Bob") thinks
I'm seeing another man. I've never, ever
cheated on "Bob." What can Ido to make
"Bob" trust met
— Miffed in Missoula
Dear Miffed,
I'm sure there's some reason that "Bob"
doesn't trust you. Perhaps it would help
to speak to your clergyman. Or consider
purchasing one of those women's
magazines with helpful articles like
"Women Speak Out: Why Men Don't Re
spect Us!" and "Firm Buttocks: Your Key
to Happiness and Success."
Dear Ann Landers,

My name is Ralph, but my wife keeps
calling me "Bob." I think she's seeing
another man. And her buttocks seem
firmer, too.
— Ralph
This doesn't mean that Ann isn't getting
some hot 'n' heavy letters as well. It's
just that she answers those confidentially:
CONFIDENTIAL TO PERTURBED IN
PENSACOLA: Go ahead and have the op
eration, but make sure that "Eddie" and
"Jim" know where they stand before you
invite the goat to the Bar Mitzvah Also,
don't wonry about being prosecuted, unless
the shipment hatches before you get it
across state lines. And I think the
detonator would be more effective if you
cross-wired it in parallel with a 30-ohm
resistor and used more plutonium in the
core.
• ♦ #
So then Dr. Ruth started her column.
It became popular both for its frank dis
cussion of explicit sexual matters and for
the peppy German slang she sprinkles
throughout:
Dear Dr. Ruth,
My boyfriend doesn't know how to turn

me on. 1 have never had an organism.
Help!
- M.B.
Dear Ml,
You must learn how to use your entire
bodies for pleasure. Do not be afraid to
stroke his wienerschnitzel while he
caresses your knockwursts. Remember
that to achieve oktobcrfcst you must
lowenbrau yourself upon his wunderbar if
you want to get hoffWau.
Pretty soon, as the Beatles once said,
"Sie liebt dich" (she'll leap his dich).
Dear Dr. Ruth.
My wife is still calling me "Bob " And
now her buttocks are so firm that 1
chipped a tooth last night.
— Ralph

But in terms of really explicit sex advice
you have to turn away from newspapers
and go straight to the Playboy Advisor:
Dear Playboy Advisor.
1 took out a hot date in my car last
Saturday night. My car's a 1989 Camaro.
custom-built, with racing stripes and a
supercharged V-6 workhorse mat makes
it purr ($36,545). We were listening to

Jethro Tull on the stereo, a Bose 1988
quad speaker surround-sound extra-bass
system with quartz tumng ($799), when
she turned to me and slowly unbuttoned
the top of my shirt, a yellow Calvin Klein
V-neck with extra cross-stitching ($65).
1 could tell that she wanted my body,
which 1 had toned up using the Nautilus
X6OO Fitness System ($1,575) and by jog
ging three miles a day in my Nike Super
burst tennis shoes ($7B), so I reached over
kissed her passionately on the mouth.
Can you suggest some quality stereo

components 1 could add to my home sys
tem!

I your clergyman's rabbi.
i Dear Playboy Advisor,

1 althoujrti it really doesn't matter anymore

you have to turn away from newspapers
and go straight to the Playboy Advisor:

Today we are going to talk about sex,
which means all you techie majors can
tune in again next week.
Ha ha ha. I'm kidding, of course. Most
of the techies I know have their sex lives
firmly in hand.
The fact that we can even discuss sex
here in a frank, open manner is a tribute
to how far newspapers have come. Before
the era of Dr. Ruth, people wanting anon
ymous sex advice had only Ann Landers
to turn to:
Dear Ann Landers,
My husband (I'll call him "Bob") thinks
I'm seeing another man. I've never, ever
cheated on "Bob." What can Ido to make
"Bob" trust met
— Miffed in Missoula
Dear Miffed,
I'm sure there's some reason that "Bob"
doesn't trust you. Perhaps it would help
to speak to your clergyman. Or consider
purchasing one of those women's
magazines with helpful articles like
"Women Speak Out: Why Men Don't Re
spect Us!" and "Firm Buttocks: Your Key
to Happiness and Success."
Dear Ann Landers,

My name is Ralph, but my wife keeps
calling me "Bob." I think she's seeing
another man. And her buttocks seem
firmer, too.
— Ralph
This doesn't mean that Ann isn't getting
some hot 'n' heavy letters as well. It's
just that she answers those confidentially:
CONFIDENTIAL TO PERTURBED IN
PENSACOLA: Go ahead and have the op
eration, but make sure that "Eddie" and
"Jim" know where they stand before you
invite the goat to the Bar Mitzvah Also,
don't wonry about being prosecuted, unless
the shipment hatches before you get it
across state lines. And I think the
detonator would be more effective if you
cross-wired it in parallel with a 30-ohm
resistor and used more plutonium in the
core.

So then Dr. Ruth started her column.
It became popular both for its frank dis
cussion of explicit sexual matters and for
the peppy German slang she sprinkles
throughout:
Dear Dr. Ruth,
My boyfriend doesn't know how to turn

me on. 1 have never had an organism.
Help!
- M.B.
Dear Ml,
