# Chinese students fear effects of U.S. activism on relatives
## 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the third
article in a four-part series on the
Chinese student movement at
Stanford. Several of those inter
viewed withheld their names
because of concerns for family
members remaining in China.

"This summer my family called
me and said, 'You feel free to
speak out over there, but here we
feel the pressure.' Then I learned
that the government has circu
lated a blacklist of active students
in the U.S. Since then I have
stayed away from the media. You
don't know how far the persecu
tion will go. Your relatives may
be denied jobs, condemned by the
government, forbidden to go to
school and have their homes
searched by the police."
These words of a Chinese grad
uate student reflect a pervasive
fear among Chinese students at
Stanford that their activism in
the United States may cause prob

lems for relatives who remain in
China.
Memories of Mao Zedong's
Great Proletarian Cultural Revo
lution and its senseless brutality
in the name of ideological purity
are still painfully vivid for many
students on campus.
Graduate student Zhou
Xueguang employs a classical
idiom, dao lu, yi mu — on the
road there are only eyes — to
describe the current climate of
fear in China. The phrase refers
to an ancient dynasty whose em
peror ruled with such tyranny
that friends, meeting on the road,
were afraid to exchange any
words. Their eyes alone could
meet.
Warnings from home
The early winter that has
struck China touches Stanford
students through letters from
home. One graduate student says,
"Almost overnight the whole tone
has changed. All the letters you
receive have become warnings."
Many Stanford students know

from firsthand experience how far
China's Communist Party can go
in expressing its wrath. "In the
countryside," says graduate stu
dent "Han Zi", "you can see how
the Communists exploit and
oppress the people. If you dare to
argue with the Party secretary,
he has the right to hang you from
the house and beat you."

The most ominous label the
government can apply to dissi
dents is "counterrevolutionary,"
because it sets the dissident in
irrevocable opposition to the gov
ernment and society of China. It
is a label that the government, in
an attempt to link the student
demonstrations to foreign govern
ments, has begun to use in refer
ring to student organizations
abroad.

One student who discovered his
name had been published in China
as a troublemaker in the United
States tried to find out why he
had been singled out. Friends in
the government service told him
that people in China had been
assembling clippings from Amer
ican newspapers.
Other students report that their
families in China have been
visited by the police as a result
of their activism here. Thus stu
dents are particularly sensitive
about contact with the media. Un
like the emotional days of spring,
students are more cautious in the
face of hard choices about loyalty
and publicity.
Against this background of sur
veillance and persecution, stu
dents are very careful about
actually breaking with the Com
munist Party. Graduate student
Douglas Pan recalls leading
chants at a demonstration in front
of the San Francisco consulate
when suddenly some of the mar
chers began to shout "Down with
the Communist Party."

"My first reaction was to use
my bullhorn to drown them out,"
he says.
Most students point out that
their most optimistic goal is not
to overthrow the Communist
Party, but to find a way to express
dissent within the system.
"We are not talking 'kill the
commies' here, just allowing free
and fair competition within
China," says David Ai, a project
manager at Hewlett-Packard who
has worked closely with the Chi
nese students at Stanford.
Longing for home
Chinese students in the United
States are caught in a double bind.
Almost all came here intending to
return home and do their part in
building a new China. It was this
same loyalty which led them to
support the democracy movement
as China's best hope for reform.
"At first I was opposed to po
litical reform," graduate student
"Lin Ming" says."I was afraid
that too much political freedom
would slow down economic

reform. . . . But as the economic
situation in China became worse
and worse, I came to realize that
political reform is necessary to
good economic reform.' 1
Lin saw the demonstrates as
the guardians of China's reforms.
"The demonstrations in China
were very exciting. We felt that
as long as there were protesters,
there was still hope for reforms."
And now, as a result of their
support, Chinese students here
face the prospect of an indefinite
period of exile in the United
States. "I can't go back to see my
parents and siblings," says one
graduate student. "I hope this gov
ernment crashes down very soon.
My parents are very old, and if
they got sick I would want to see
them, but I can't go home."
Another graduate student says,
"Before [the Tiananmen Square
massacre!, I always thought I
would go back ... but since then
I know I will not try to go
back. ... It is very sad. I feel

homeless here. China is my home
country, many of my relatives still
live there, but I cannot return."
Student leaders are afraid that,
by remaining abroad, they will be
effectively silenced as a force for
change inside China. Graduate
student Bao Yichin says, "If you
want democracy in China, you
have to set your stage in China.
The pro-democracy people must
be able to return at some point."
However, since going home is
clearly not an option now, stu
dents are devoting their efforts to
long distance education. "We have
to educate people as to what kind
of system they are living in. With
out comparison, they don't know
they have the right to ask for a
better life," says one student
leader, describing a project to send
news into China via short-wave
radios.
Graduate student Lu Mei feels
that "you cannot actually change
China by having an organization
abroad, but you can have an ef
fect. What students in the U.S.
can do is to form a group to sup
port one side in China, and to
look after their own interests in
the U.S."
Resuming forgotten studies
These interests include studies
the students originally came to
the United States to pursue. In
creasingly, Chinese students are
feeling pressure to resume the
work they abandoned last spring.
One social science graduate stu
dent speaks for almost everyone
when he says,"I have not touched
my dissertation all summer. Now
I have to get back to work."
All the students intend to go on
with their studies, even if return
ing to China is not an option at
this time. "I can't imagine all the
students dropping out and becom
ing revolutionaries," says Pan.
"One can support democracy in
China in many ways. Being a stu
dent is just one," Pan continues.
"But you can do a lot more if you
are working. In the long run,
finishing your degree will help

pro-democratic efforts."
Few students think they could
work for the current regime even
if they were able to return home.
One engineering graduate student
says, "If you go back and just stay
quiet, you'll probably be OK, but
there is no motivation for you to
work hard. You know it is the
government who gains the benefit
from your work."
Becoming professional revolu
tionaries is a fate most students
are actively avoiding. Quoting
leading dissident Wan Runnan,
Pan says, "We cannot afford to
have professional revolutionaries.
They don't know how to do any
thing else, so they become des
perate to hang on to their
positions. This is what has hap
pened to politicians in China."
Without exception, the refrain
voiced by every student was, "We
are not professional politicians."
Reluctant activists
Events at Stanford reflect Chi
nese intellectuals' love/hate rela
tionship with politics. According
to Zhou, "They hate politics in
general, especially after the cul
tural revolution, because they
know it is a game that the leaders
use to oppress their opponents.
"But intellectuals are also
keenly aware of their own desire
to do something to help change
society," Zhou continues. "In
America students always talk
about Chinese politics as if it were
a part of their personal life, but
they hate to get involved in it."
As life returns to normal, Chi
nese students expect a diminish
ing involvement in politics.
"Before, everyone was involved,
but in the next year you will prob
ably only see a percentage," says
Lu.
For those who remain active in
the movement, the switch to long
term goals involves difficult
choices. There are fears that the
Chinese consulate will not renew
passports or authorize travel doc
uments for students involved in
the new political organizations. In
the past week, students at other
universities in California have
had their passports confiscated
when they tried to renew them,
according to students at Stanford.

Ultimately most students ex
pect that the International Fed
eration of Chinese Students and
Scholars will have to develop some
sort of relationship with ihe con
sulate, although people do not yet
know what form it will take.
Choosing allies is another deci
sion that students fear may have
important consequences. The fed
eration currently maintains inde
pendence from both the
government and political opposi
tion groups, but that has not
stopped the Chinese government
from harshly condemning the or
ganization.
At the end of this month the
federation will send a delegation
to Taiwan to meet with academ
ics, observe the upcoming na
tional elections and seek financial
support, according to graduate
student Tu Shih-liang.
Taiwan: money and misgivings
The trip to Taiwan is contro
versial in light of the long
standing enmity between the
Taiwanese government, which
claims to be the true government
of China, and the mainland Chi
nese government.
Graduate student Liu
Yongchuan of the federation says
he is not worried about rumors
that the Taiwanese government
is trying to influence the student
movement in the United States.
"We have a special policy on dona
tions," he says. "We will not ac

cept any government donations."
Although most students wel
come the participation of Chinese
from Taiwan and see the col
laboration as evidence of their in
dependence from the Chinese
government, some have misgiv
ings about contact with the gov
ernment of the Republic of China
on Taiwan.
One graduate student said he
thinks "it is not good to have too
close a relationship with Taiwan
because it will alienate a majority
of Chinese students here who
want the [federation) to be an
apolitical organization. The
[federation] should stay away
from ideology and try to transcend
traditional disputes rather than
playing into the hands of the
Nationalists (the government of
Taiwan) who are still trying to
find revenge for their defeat 40
years ago."
Within China, accusations of
ties to Taiwan are used to fuel
the fires of criticism of the student
movement abroad. Graduate stu
dent Xu Guanghan says that, for
the government, "The best way
to attack people is to accuse them
of connections with Taiwan."
A role for Americans
In their search for allies, Chi
nese students welcome the in
volvement of Americans.
Ai, head of the Support Democ
racy in China coalition of Bay
Area residents, suggests several
ways for Americans to become in

volved. "The first is for everyone
to become more knowledgeable
about China. Awareness is the
number-one issue. Another way
is showing support for congres
sional bills. There is the Lantos
Bill to put pressure on the Chi
nese government and the Pelosi
Bill for the J-l visa extension."
Most Chinese students at Stan
ford are here on J-l visas, which
require the bearer to return home
for two years after completing his
or her studies.
"A third way," Ai continues, "is
to join us. The [Support Democ
racy in China coalition) is com
pletely open and meets every
Wednesday at the I-Center. And
you can always donate, although
I hesitate to even ask because this
is a war supported by information,
not money."
A member of the Association of
Chinese Students and Scholars at
Stanford adds that Americans
traveling to China can help out
by taking news to China and
bringing information back to the
United States.
"One of our biggest problems
is dwindling public interest," Ai
says. "People have too many
things to care about. As time goes
on and there are no more deaths
we hear about, no more heroes
coming out of China, the public
interest shifts away from the de
mocracy movement."
Adds Lu, "It is our responsibil
ity to let people remember there
was a massacre on June 4th."

Several Chinese students congregate in May at the Chinese consulate in San Francisco to protest
actions of the Chinese government.
