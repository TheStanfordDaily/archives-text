# Chinese students fear effects of U.S. activism on relatives

Editor's note: This is the third
article in a four-part series on the
Chinese student movement at
Stanford. Several of those inter
viewed withheld their names
because of concerns for family
members remaining in China.

"This summer my family called
me and said, 'You feel free to
speak out over there, but here we
feel the pressure.' Then I learned
that the government has circu
lated a blacklist of active students
in the U.S. Since then I have
stayed away from the media. You
don't know how far the persecu
tion will go. Your relatives may
be denied jobs, condemned by the
government, forbidden to go to
school and have their homes
searched by the police."
These words of a Chinese grad
uate student reflect a pervasive
fear among Chinese students at
Stanford that their activism in
the United States may cause prob

lems for relatives who remain in
China.
Memories of Mao Zedong's
Great Proletarian Cultural Revo
lution and its senseless brutality
in the name of ideological purity
are still painfully vivid for many
students on campus.
Graduate student Zhou
Xueguang employs a classical
idiom, dao lu, yi mu — on the
road there are only eyes — to
describe the current climate of
fear in China. The phrase refers
to an ancient dynasty whose em
peror ruled with such tyranny
that friends, meeting on the road,
were afraid to exchange any
words. Their eyes alone could
meet.
Warnings from home
The early winter that has
struck China touches Stanford
students through letters from
home. One graduate student says,
"Almost overnight the whole tone
has changed. All the letters you
receive have become warnings."
Many Stanford students know

from firsthand experience how far
China's Communist Party can go
in expressing its wrath. "In the
countryside," says graduate stu
dent "Han Zi", "you can see how
the Communists exploit and
oppress the people. If you dare to
argue with the Party secretary,
he has the right to hang you from
the house and beat you."

The most ominous label the
government can apply to dissi
dents is "counterrevolutionary,"
because it sets the dissident in
irrevocable opposition to the gov
ernment and society of China. It
is a label that the government, in
an attempt to link the student
demonstrations to foreign govern
ments, has begun to use in refer
ring to student organizations
abroad.

One student who discovered his
name had been published in China
as a troublemaker in the United
States tried to find out why he
had been singled out. Friends in
the government service told him
that people in China had been
assembling clippings from Amer
ican newspapers.
Other students report that their
families in China have been
visited by the police as a result
of their activism here. Thus stu
dents are particularly sensitive
about contact with the media. Un
like the emotional days of spring,
students are more cautious in the
face of hard choices about loyalty
and publicity.
Against this background of sur
veillance and persecution, stu
dents are very careful about
actually breaking with the Com
munist Party. Graduate student
Douglas Pan recalls leading
chants at a demonstration in front
of the San Francisco consulate
when suddenly some of the mar
chers began to shout "Down with
the Communist Party."

"My first reaction was to use
my bullhorn to drown them out,"
he says.
Most students point out that
their most optimistic goal is not
to overthrow the Communist
Party, but to find a way to express
dissent within the system.
"We are not talking 'kill the
commies' here, just allowing free
and fair competition within
China," says David Ai, a project
manager at Hewlett-Packard who
has worked closely with the Chi
nese students at Stanford.
Longing for home
Chinese students in the United
States are caught in a double bind.
Almost all came here intending to
return home and do their part in
building a new China. It was this
same loyalty which led them to
support the democracy movement
as China's best hope for reform.
"At first I was opposed to po
litical reform," graduate student
"Lin Ming" says."I was afraid
that too much political freedom
would slow down economic

reform. . . . But as the economic
situation in China became worse
and worse, I came to realize that
political reform is necessary to
good economic reform.' 1
Lin saw the demonstrates as
the guardians of China's reforms.
"The demonstrations in China
were very exciting. We felt that
as long as there were protesters,
there was still hope for reforms."
And now, as a result of their
support, Chinese students here
face the prospect of an indefinite
period of exile in the United
States. "I can't go back to see my
parents and siblings," says one
graduate student. "I hope this gov
ernment crashes down very soon.
My parents are very old, and if
they got sick I would want to see
them, but I can't go home."
Another graduate student says,
"Before [the Tiananmen Square
massacre!, I always thought I
would go back ... but since then
I know I will not try to go
back. ... It is very sad. I feel
