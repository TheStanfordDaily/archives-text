# A 						'Schuur' thing comes to Stanford

' What do you call a blind,
white woman from Seattle
named "Deedles"? If you're a
Grammy Award presenter, you
call her "the winner."
Amazing as it may seem,
Diane "Deedles" Schuur has
won two successive Grammy
Awards for Best Female Jazz
Singer. She brings her act to
Memorial Auditorium this Sat
urday.
Schuur was an unknown
kicking around the jazz scene
until she was "discovered" at
the Monterey Jazz Festival in
1979 by saxophonist Stan Getz
while she was performing an
impromptu number with Dizzy
Gillespie. Since then her career
has taken a meteoric rise to the
top, including six albums,
performances at Carnegie Hall
and the White House, and nu
merous appearances on the
Tonight Show.
In the past six years her name
has often been tossed around
in the same company as Ella
Fitzgerald's; indeed, those who
have only heard her music on
the radio often assume that she
is black. ABC News called her
"the next great jazz singer."
Schuur grew up in that hotbed
of jazz, Auburn, Washington.
She continues to live in Wash
ington today, making her home
in Seattle. Blind since birth,
Schuur began singing almost
before she could talk, eventually
developing an impressive 3 and
a half octave vocal range. (To

put that into perspective, Tracy
Chapman has a 1/8 octave vocal
range.) She nicknamed herself
"Deedles" when she was young,
and the name stuck.
Schuur made her first appear
ances at hotels and clubs in
Washington state, singing pre
dominantly country music. She
later switched to jazz, which re
mains her primary focus except
for occasional forays into the
world of pop.
Living in the wet Pacific
Northwest does have its down
side. Her first LP was recorded
on Seattle's independent label
First American in 1983. The
company went out of business
shortly thereafter, but not before
the master to her first recording
was destroyed in a flood.
Through adversity, though —
floods, blindness, appearing in
The Daily — Schuur has main
tained a legendary sense of
humor. During one Tonight
Show appearance she floored
Johnny Carson by telling him
he looked gorgeous.
Opening for Schuur on Sat
urday will be the local
jazz/fusion group A Little Night
Music, which has appeared with
The Tower of Power, David
Benoit and Dave Brubeck, and
has had albums in the top 30
for jazz airplay.

Diane Schuur with A Little
Night Music appears Saturday
at 8 p.m. in Memorial Audito
rium. All student tickets are
half-price for the show, and are
available at the Tresidder Ticket
Office.
