# Hoofing history: everything's 'copasetic'
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
History tells us that tap dancing
originated in this country more
than 200 years ago. After African
drums were outlawed in 1793 be
cause they were used to signal a
slave revolt, slaves added a patting
and rhythmic slapping of the body
to their traditional circle dances.
This new dance form then
gradually mingled with the Irish
Jig, Lancashire Waltz, Clog and
Virginia Essence to evolve into
what we know today as tap danc
ing.
Or so the story goes.
The degree to which you find
this history apocryphal probably
depends on how often you've found
yourself idly tapping your feet
along with the rhythm while at
tending a concert. For those who
have, tap doesn't seem like a long
evolved dance form but a natural
human expression presented to
music. Take your choice.
Enter the Copasetics, five guys
who know the history of tap better
than most. They are the history.
They'll be hoofing Monday at 8
p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
The Copasetics are a troupe of
legendary tap masters whose
careers date back to the 19305.
Now in their 70s, these guys are
still nimble and rhythmic, even if
it is a little harder for them to
get out of bed in the morning.
Dance performances are tradi
tionally a forum for lithe young
things to prance upon a stage,
flaunting supple bodies and et
hereal moves. Oh, every once in
a while you'll get a dancer on
stage approaching fortysometh
ing, and in fact gray-haired
modern dance innovater Merce
Cunningham "danced" (stood still
to music) last year at Memorial
Auditorium. But by and large,
dance performance has become a
forum for the young.

The Copasetics buck this no
tion. They are:
• James "Buster" Brown, who
danced for many years with the
Speed King Trio, appeared in the
movie "Something to Shout
About" and toured with the Cab
Calloway Orchestra.
• Louis Sims Carpenter, who
began dancing at the legendary
Cotton Club at the age of 12 —
before it was even called the Cot
ton Club. He appeared in Kate
Smith's first Broadway show,
"Eddie Darling's Honeymoon
Lane."
• Leslie "Bubba" Gains, a
charter member of the Three
Dukes and long-time performer

at the Casino de Paris, the Lon
don Palladium, the Empire in
Dublin and the Cotton Club.
• Henry "Phace" Roberts,
member of the Five Blazers and
The Three Rockets. He appeared
on the Milton Berle Show and in
the musical "Stormy Weather."
• Charles "Cookie" Cook, one
half of the eccentric Cook and
Brown dance team. He toured
with the Duke Ellington and
Count Basie orchestras, and ap
peared on Broadway in "Kiss Me
Kate."
• Leroy Myers, master of cer
emonies and long-time dancer, as
well as former road manager for
the Supremes and manager of

such artists as 8.8. King and
Brooke Benton.
The Copasetics dedicate much
of their art to Bill "Bojangles"
Robinson, the greatest tapper of
them all. Bojangles liked to say
that everything was fine and
dandy — copasetic. That's where
they got their name, and that's
how they feel about life. Every
thing's copasetic. Even if it's hard
to get out of bed in the morning.

The Copasetics perform Monday
at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium,
with music by the Jim Roberts
Trio. Tickets are $12 to $18
(students $3 off) and are available
at the Tresidder Ticket Office.


The Copasetics, known as the grandfathers of tap, will be kicking up their heels in Memorial Auditorium
this Monday night at 8 p.m. Tickets are still available at Tresidder Ticket Office.
