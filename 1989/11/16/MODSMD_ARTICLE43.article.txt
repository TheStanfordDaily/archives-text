# Dollies put the kick into football

While the Leland Stanford Junior University March
ing Band provides musical entertainment at half-time
shows and other public appearances, there are five
women busy dancing their hearts out.
And unless you've been in a coma all year, you've
probably noticed them. They're the Dollies, Stanford's
own dance performance team. And to set the record
straight once and for all, they're not cheerleaders.
This year's talented squad consists of Meghan
MacKay and Emily Mackenzie, both undeclared soph
omores, Dionn Stewart and Mary Gehan, sophomores
majoring in computer science and human biology,
respectively, and English and economics major Juli
Oh, a junior.
The one thing that this diverse bunch has in
common is their love of dance. And if you've ever
seen them in performance, it should be no surprise
to learn that four of the five women were cheerleaders
or songleaders in high school, and all five have had
ballet or modern jazz dance training. Most of them
also have prior choreographing experience.
They choreograph their own dances to go with the
Band numbers, "except for the five traditional lame
ones, like the Indian dance," explained MacKay.
Thanks to good relations this year with drum major

Kai Keasey the Dollies have been able to choreograph
new and improved routines to songs that the Band
plays frequently.
Yet choreography is only one part of the huge time
commitment required by the group. The women all
agree that the nearly 50 hours per week spent between
daily practices and performances is more time than
they anticipated spending in the group when they
tried out last spring for the year-long job.
But none of them regret their decision to join.
Spending this much time together has built a special
friendship between the five.
Becoming a Dollie is not an easy task. Try-outs
begin in March and take place in three rounds.
In the first round, the women audition in front of
past Dollies and are judged according to dance ability.
The second round is in front of the band. According
to Mackenzie, band members are "fairly clueless as
to who can dance," but they do their best to narrow
the group of hopefuls down to ten.
These ten are then interviewed by the band staff
to determine which five women will work best with
each other. The next morning the five women who
are selected get a 6 A.M. wake-up call and are taken
out to breakfast.
Their year-long stint with the dance performance
team began in May, and it will end next spring when
the new group members are chosen.
