# 'Candleland' echoes past
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
When Echo and the Bunnymen broke up
earlier this year, it seemed obvious what
would follow.
Echo had a huge cult following in Britain,
and gained American exposure with "Bring
on the Dancing Horses," a track from the
"Pretty in Pink" soundtrack. Yet on their
self-titled last album, lead singer lan
McCulloch took full lyrical and partial mu
sical credit for all 11 of the album's tracks.
Following in the footsteps of Sting and
Morissey, it seemed only natural for McCul
loch to find a niche of his own.
With his solo debut, "Candleland,"
McCulloch strives to reach this personal
niche. Without a doubt, "Candleland"
proves that McCulloch was the centerpiece
of his former band. However, the album's
10 tracks echo his Bunnymen days so
resoundingly that one wonders if some
where along the road to becoming a
successful solo artist, McCulloch himself
got lost.
The inaugural single, "Proud to Fall,"
is deceivingly exceptional. Musically simple
and fiendishly catchy, the song describes a
love ruined by self-esteem. McCulloch's
voice displays an uncommon crispness, es
pecially during the climactic chorus.
Through this song, McCulloch definitely
shows that he does have the potential to
be commercially successful.
But after comparing the style of the al
bum's remainder to the style of "Proud to
Fall," one wonders if McCulloch is fully
content with his shadowy cult status. In

"Candleland," "Horse's Head" and"In
Bloom" McCulloch takes listeners on a jour
ney through surreal visions which lack con
tinuity, theme or relevance. Any symbolism
is lost amidst the enigmatic lyrics, filled
with random images in dreamlike atmo
spheres. McCulloch strives too hard to be
avant-garde.
It's a pity, too, because musically, McCul
loch can definitely hold his own as a solo
artist. He successfully utilizes various tech
niques to keep from exposing the limits of
his vocal range.
In"The White Hotel," he uses rever
berating vocals to increase tone and bass
to strengthen lower notes. In "Faith and
Healing," a song about reconciliation after
the loss of a loved one, he uses a quick
start and a sharper beat to protect his soft
vocal style.
Throughout the album, backgrounds of
violins, xylophones and guitars serve to
uplift his quiet style.
Musical accomplishment is clearly
eclipsed by McCulloch's lyrical ineptitude.
This shortcoming is perhaps best ex
emplified by "I lOiow You Well," clearly
the album's nadir. The song's potential to
be a loving, soulful ballad is destroyed by
climaxing to an incredibly inane chorus. It
seems fitting that one of the song's lines
is "When everything is h0110w...."
Somewhere along the road to becoming
a solo artist, lan McCulloch lost his lyrical
skill. Paradoxically, his lyrics could support
a band of four far better than himself.
Perhaps McCulloch should consider a
reunion of Echo and the Bunnymen —
after all, there is safety in numbers.
