# Friedman soars at Kresge
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
Rarely can you feel performers putting
their whole hearts into each and every
song on stage. But for the 300 or so at
Kresge Auditorium last Sunday afternoon,
this — and a whole lot more — was
what they felt during folksinger Debbie
Friedman's two-hour set co-sponsored by
Hillel, Stanford's Jewish student organi
zation, and Congregation Shir Hadash in
Los Gatos.
The majority of the songs were about
peace and harmony.
Her best-known song, "Not by Might,"
was a definite highlight of Sunday's per
formance.
Friedman must realize, however, that

no matter how good a concert is, people
will always walk away wishing she had
sung some favorite song of theirs.
It was only after another 45 minutes
worth of songs that audience requests
finally subsided. She apologized for
keeping everybody for so long, and began
her closing sentiments.
"There is one thing we have in com
mon," she said, "and that is that we are
all on a journey and we are all struggling
to find the best way." Her rare public
display of emotion was enough to put a
tear in the eyes of many. And when Talia,
the adorable 4-year-old girl behind me
sang, "We are the light of peace/We are
the prayer of hope," there was no one
in Kresge who could possibly think other
wise.
