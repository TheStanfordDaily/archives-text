# Best 'Ciao' in the City
## 
### Marnie Rager 
If you're searching for an excellent Italian
restaurant without the standard red and
white checkered tablecloths, Ciao Northern
Italian Ristorante in San Francisco is a
must. It's 10th anniversary was not long
ago — and they certainly have reason to
celebrate. They are known as one of the
"hottest" spots for dining in the city today.
And there is reason why the "who's who"
are eating at Ciao.
The atmosphere, as you can imagine, is
alive with conversation. It's not so loud,
however, that you can hear the conversations
of those around you, unlike many other
popular restaurants.
The service is professional, and quite help
ful too. They know Ciao, so trust their
suggestions, as the variety of food can seem
overwhelming.
Since carpaccio — a paper-thin slice of
raw steak covered with a light mustard sauce
originated at Ciao — it is one of the res
taurant's most popular appetizers.
The tortelli ai carciofi — white pasta filled
with fresh artichokes and parmesan cheese,
and topped with butter and sage — also
comes highly recommended. It is simply
delicious, and the mild flavor of the tortellini
makes an excellent lead-in for the main
course.
I tried the salmone al cardone, baked sal
mon wrapped in chard, tomato and basil
sauce. Portions of this superb, lean entree
are rather large. Although this may limit

room for the garnishes, it's no loss here, as
these colorful items so often end up just
keeping the plate company anyway.
Seafood is not all that is offered, however.
Pasta and red meat make excellent alterna
tives to the fish, judging from my guest's
raves over the taste of the large veal chop.
By this point we were stuffed, yet so im
pressed with Ciao's food that we ordered
dessert even though neither of us really had
the appetite to finish it. The tiramisu and
the profiterole di nocciola — ladyfingers,
espresso, rum, mascarpone cheese and
cocoa, and fluffy puffs of hazelnut ice cream
on top of chocolate sauce, taste as good as
they sound.
And even if do not have a sweet tooth,
you should at least opt for the traditional
flavored ice to properly end the meal.
I recommend Ciao highly, and the hustle
and bustle of the place makes it obvious
that other people do, too. Because of this,
make reservations, or plan on eating some
where else.
One last thing — although the prices at
this upscale restaurant are extremely rea
sonable, the bill can quickly become expen
sive, especially with drinks. Be sure to go
with friends who can recognize and appre
ciate quality — you get what you pay for.

Ciao's Northern Italian Ristorante is located
at 230 Jackson St.in San Francisco. For
reservations, call 982-9500.
