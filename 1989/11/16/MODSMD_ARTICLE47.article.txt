# 'Hawks' doesn't ever leave ground
## 
### Greg Douglas 
Curling up under the blankets with a
good book, curling up under the blankets
with a good "friend" or perhaps just get
ting a good night's sleep — these are all
good ways to enjoy a chilly evening.
But in a dateless effort to escape study
ing and my dorm, I went out to "Hawks,"
the sometimes light and poignant movie
about two men dying of an unnamed,
degenerative disease.
In retrospect, I think it would have
been more entertaining to read the dic
tionary.
Starring in this bland flick are Timothy
Dalton and Anthony Edwards, who, after
meeting in the hospital ward, pledge to
live their dying days as adventure-seeking
"hawks." Like members of last summer's
"Dead Poet's Society," the self
proclaimed "black knights of humor" are
bent upon getting the most out of their
final days, and getting some laughs out
of "pigeons," those hapless souls who
don't share their "seize the day" attitude.

One of their confrontations with soci
ety's pigeons involves stealing a hospital
ambulance so they could visit a five-floor
whorehouse in Amsterdam. On their
way, they meet two of the movie's biggest
pigeons, Hazel and Maureen, a pair of
English women looking for the father of
Hazel's unborn child.
This chance meeting is a symptom of
the main problem of the movie — a
disjointed, unconvincing plot.
Hazel and Maureen are introduced,
without warning, in a scene depicting
Hazel's depression with her inability to
"get a man," although she's already preg
nant, while her friend Maureen comforts
her.
Unfortunately, this episode occurs in
the midst of Dalton's initial encounters
with Edwards. This sloppy tactic is jar
ring and confusing, and it detracts from
what could have been potentially inter
esting scenes between Dalton and Ed
wards.
Yet plot isn't the only bone in this

turkey of a film. The screenplay is a
masterpiece of unimaginative dialogue.
To add to the nightmare, the Bee Gees
come back from the '70s to make almost
the entire soundtrack for "Hawks." And
let me tell you, it's a real mover. Al
though they've finally realized that disco
is out, they still seem to think that bad
music is in.
Dalton does a decent job of portraying
the carpe diem dying man who talks
Edwards into mischief. Edwards, how
ever, delivers merely a mediocre perform
ance as a somewhat suicidal terminally
ill patient. And the rest of the cast con
vinces me that maybe it isn't really that
hard to break into show biz.
All things considered, movies are
pretty expensive nowadays. Although it
might be difficult to find and watch a
truly outstanding motion picture, you
can certainly get more entertainment for
the buck from some of the other less
than-great movies currently in the
theaters.
