# 'Steel Magnolias' cast blooms

### Brad Bruner 
"Laughter through tears is my
favorite emotion/' beauty-salon
owner Truvy lones (Dolly Parton)
tells her friends in "Steel Mag
nolias." Truvy's statement cap
tures everything that "Magnolias"
is all about — courage, faith and
love through adversity, and the
value that individuality has
through it all.
This perceptive film paints a pic
ture of bonds between six Southern
women with one of the most in
spired ensemble casts — Sally
Field, Shirley MacLaine, Darryl
Hannah, Parton, Olympia Duka
kis, Sam Shepard, Tom Skeritt and
relative newcomer Julia Roberts —
in recent memory.
Basing the script on his own
play, screenwriter Robert Harling
draws on the vivid differences be
tween the Southern women, as
well as the differences that charac
terize people in general to make a
very believable film.
When Shelby Eatenton, a
diabetic played by Julia Roberts,

gets married and decides to have
a child, she is defying the wishes
of her doctor and friends, who are
afraid the strain will be too much
in combination with her diabetes.
Her mother, M'Lynn worries
that Shelby's over-ambitious hus
band has pressured her into the
decision to have the baby.
Despite this, however, M'Lynn,
played by Sally Field, and the group
of women at Truvy's beauty shop
continue to support her.
The group is made of extremely
different women — Shelby's over
protective, yet perceptive mother,
the gripy curmudgeon Ouiser
(MacLaine — in overalls!), the
mayor's elegant widow Clairee
(Dukakis), Truvy and her mousy
helper, Annabelle (a scarcely
recognizable Hannah).
Yet the combination of actresses
is so strong that it rescues "Mag
nolias" from its one major flaw —
an overwhelming affinity for pert
one-liners.
Field's ability to glide from

comic foil to strong figure is par
ticularly commendable. She is
probably the only American actress
today who has the dexterity — but
not the stiffness — of actresses
like Meryl Streep.
As Shelby, Roberts performs just
as well as she did in last year's
"Mystic Pizza." Her steady, yet
sleek, presence amidst the Dig
names in the film actually helps
make the picture more coherent.
Granted, certain plot develop
ments are predictable. But the very
fact that "Magnolias" embraces
these inevitable real-life outcomes
is fresh in itself. As a result, every
character seems truly in place and
effortless — as though they are
basking in the cycle of life that
"Magnolias" celebrates.
Though "Magnolias" is certainly
not perfect, it is far better than
most of this year's crop. It breathes
with its neat mechanism of com
edy framed into real life, and
merits all the attention and spon
taneous applause that audiences
are sure to give it.
