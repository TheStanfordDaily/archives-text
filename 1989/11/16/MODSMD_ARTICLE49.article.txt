# 'Stay' Calm: The best remedy for midterm blues is on the way
## 
### Kim Kochaver 
It's Thursday afternoon and you have
just had the day from Hell.
You pulled an all-nighter only to fail
your midterm miserably. Your dorm serves
baked eggplant and pork burgers for lunch,
and the only thing you get in your mailbox
is a threatening letter from the phone
company informing you that your service
will be disconnected if you don't mail in
half of next year's salary by tomorrow
morning.
What do mature, responsible and intel
ligent students do when faced with mid

terms, an overdue paper and three weeks
of background reading?
They go to the movies, of course. Lucky
for you (and me), there is a new flick that
combines just the right amount of drama
and comedy to satisfy your discriminating
movie sensibility, as well as the other 90
percent of you that just wants a good
excuse to eat Red Vines.
"Staying Together" is the story of the
McDermotts, a small-town family that is
forced to grow up and mature with the
changes that are shaping their world.
The head of the clan, played by Jim
Haynie, owns the local fried chicken res

taurant, and he runs it with the help of
his three sons.
When he suddenly announces that he
plans to sell the family business and cash
in on the benefits of retirement — explor
ing, traveling, fishing and a big mobile
home — the brothers are forced to face
their cloudy future.
Each reacts to the news in his own way.
The eldest, Brian (Tim Quill), was the
business head of the restaurant, and is
furious with his father's unilateral deci
sion. He storms out of the house with
baggage in tow, and into the arms of his
quasi-girlfriend, Nancy Trainer, played by

Stockard Channing.
Kit (Dermot Mulroney) and Duncan
(Sean Astin) take the news better than
Brian — but they run into problems of
their own, such as cooking for themselves
when their mother goes backpacking.
Kit, who soon finds a job at the local
drugstore, is an aspiring long-distance
marathoner. He hopes to make it big with
his sport, as well as his training partner
Beverly, played by Daphne Zuniga.
Duncan's main concern is himself —
and his crusade lies in extending the con
cept of "happy hour" into "happy day."
As the family comedian, intellect and

drunk, he is the most entertaining char
acter in this film. He brings wit to scenes
that might otherwise have floundered in
happiness, yet he also manages to rise to
the dramatic heights that certain scenes
require.
While the extracurricular interests of
the brothers tend to get in the way of the
more interesting familial drama, the
strength of the family dynamic that is
portrayed makes up for the distraction.
This movie is definitely worth seeing
— even if you aced your exam and had
pizza for lunch.
