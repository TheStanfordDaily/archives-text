# German students cautious
## Elation over opening, but expecting flood of issues 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Many Stanford students from Germany
expressed elation at last week's opening of
East Germany's border to the West, but
they remain cautious as they expect a flood
of political issues to accompany the immi
grants who come through the Berlin Wall.
"When I first heard about it, I stood
there in disbelief. I needed time to collect
my emotions," said Frank Zeitz, a psychol
ogy and linguistics graduate student from
West Germany. "It's silly to cry, but I had
to hold back tears. I was very moved."
Others responded with marked surprise
because, to them, the wall was a permanent
fixture in their everyday lives.
"I look at (the walll as a fact of life. 1
didn't think it would ever come down,"
said Thomas Hellmann, a graduate student
in economics who is a German national
but resides in Brussels, Belgium. "I'm very
happy. I think it's great."
For many German students, the opening
of the wall may allow them to meet rela
tives for the first time. Many families were
separated in East Germany when the
Soviets closed the East German borders
and constructed the wall in 1961.

Reingard Schwalbe, a German student
who is studying English at Stanford and
whose husband is a graduate student here,
said she has an aunt in East Berlin whom
she has never seen.
"For things like weddings and birthdays,
it wasn't very easy to get relatives to
gether," she said of her life in West Ger
many. "I hope my East German relatives
can come now."
Zeitz said when he called home last week
to talk to his parents, he found out that
his parents were visiting some cousins in
Dresden, East Germany When he tried
telephoning his cousins' home, Zeitz was
surprised to find that the call went through.
Before last week, his relatives were not
allowed telephone contact with the West
because they had served in the East Ger
man military, and the government consid
ered them "bearers of secrets," he said.
Hellmann said he is worried, however,
that political leaders in the two Germanys
may get caught up in the "human drama"
of the event and may make irrational de
cisions, especially concerning the issue of
German reunification.
The division of Germany into two parts

Berliners climbed over the wall which separates East and West last Thursday. Back at Stanford, German students are
now wary of the political issues that may ensue as a result of the Wall's opening.
after World War II was
"completely arbitrary and a bad
idea," Hellmann said. "But you
just can't reverse a bad decision
right away. Now is not the time
for reunification."
Hellmann and Zeitz agreed that
in the 20 years since the Berlin
Wall was built, the two Germanys
have grown significantly different.
An immediate reunification would
aggravate relations not only be
tween the two countries but also
between the political powers of
the East and West.
In order to reunify, either West
Germany would have to leave the
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion or East Germany would have
to leave the Warsaw Pact, Hel
lmann said. The Soviet govern
ment has said it will not allow
East Germany to abdicate its po
sition in the Warsaw Pact, and
the Western countries fear desta
bilization in Europe if West Ger
many leaves NATO, he explained.
Also, the two economies differ
drastically, Hellmann said. West
Germany boasts one of the
strongest capitalist economies in
the West, but East Germany's
socialist economy surpasses that
of any other eastern bloc country,
he said. Attempts to impose one
system on the other could cause
serious difficulties.
One important element that
holds the two countries together,
though, is the people's common
German heritage.
"We're all the same people,"
Hellmann said of East and West
Germans. "It's purely a coinci
dence that I'm studying at Stan
ford and not at Moscow State
University — my father moved
from East Germany to Bavaria in
1933 to get a better job."
