CODE calls for aid reform
Three members of the ASSU's Committee on
Democracy in Education yesterday presented
CODE's views on perceived problems with finan
cial aid to the federal Department of Education.
The department is reviewing the Higher Edu
cation Act of 1965 which guides higher education
financial programs such as Pell Grants, Stafford
Loans and College Work-Study. The act expires
on Sept. 30, 1991.
Senior David Brown, a member of the Council
of Presidents, traveled to San Francisco with two
other CODE representatives to state their views.
"Many of HEA's provisions need to be modified,"
Brown said.
He listed several policies needing reconsidera
tion, including the definition of an "independent
student," the treatment of non-liquid assets used
to determine a family's contribution to student
aid, the determination of a student's contribution
from the previous year's income and services for
underrepresented student populations such as
those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
In addition, freshman Aimee Gym said Pell
Grants fail "to keep up with rising costs, making
students increasingly rely on larger loans."
Senior James Couture asked that the methods

for reducing the number of defaults of student
loans be "pro-student and non-punitive." He said
that such methods would include "increased coun
seling, improved communication and more
flexible repayment rates."
