## Gorbachev: Socialism hasn't failed 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev yesterday
rejected claims that reform in
Eastern Europe spell the demise
of socialism and insisted the Com
munist Revolution "was not a
mistake."
Speaking to a national student
conference in Moscow, Gorbachev
also said the existence of two Ger
manys "has been recognized by
the world community" since the
end of World War II and even talk
about reunification constitutes in
terference in the affairs of the
two countries.
The Soviet Union in the past
week has flatly opposed any sug
gestion that East and West Ger
many should be rejoined.
"Noting that certain forces in
the West try to create the impres
sion that profound changes in
socialist countries signify the fail
ure of socialist ideas, Gorbachev
said that this was wishful think
ing," according to the official
news agency Tass. It did not
specify which forces Gorbachev
had in mind.
In a televised speech that ran
almost two hours, Gorbachev
hammered home to students who
he seemed to suspect believed
otherwise that "the October revo
lution was not a mistake."
Using a persuasive, emotional
tone, Gorbachev extolled the ideol
ogy behind the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution and condemned
"people who are trying to find the
roots of our troubles not in the
distortions of socialism that took
place, but in its very nature and
principles."
"We cannot allow dissatisfac

tion with ourselves, with how we
live now, to be transformed into
attempts to question our indis
putable, universally recognized
achievements and the choice of
socialism itself," he said.
That Gorbachev felt the need
to come to the defense of the most
basic ideological postulates of So
viet society indicated that they
are coming under ever wider at
tack as the country struggles
through economic crisis and sees
East bloc neighbors moving
toward multiparty systems.
In his remarks about East Ger
many, which were carried by Tass
but not shown on television, Gor
bachev expressed for the second
day in a row concern over Western
powers' response to the demo
cratic upheaval in Eastern Eu
rope.
At a meeting Tuesday with
French Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas he denounced calls for "ex
porting capitalism" to Eastern
Europe and said it was "useless
to clamor about victory in the
Cold War, about the disintegration
of some or another social system,"
Tass reported.
The White House said yesterday
it had "no apologies" for extolling
capitalism as a remedy for the
economic woes of Eastern Europe
and said the U.S. position should
not be offensive to Gorbachev.
Press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said President Bush
views the free-market economy of
the United States as the "pride
of the world and as a good way
to reform the economic problems
that they are facing.
"We certainly are proud of the

capitalist system and the rewards
that it has offered," he added.
"We hold it up as an example to
all but we have not tried to dictate
it to any of these countries."
Nevertheless, Fitzwater said, all
the actions taken by the United
States "have been appropriate and
not been offensive and have had
the desired effect of offering our
support without inciting revolu
tion or other actions that would
take the process backward ... We
have no apologies or concern with
anything that we've done at this
point."
As for the reunification of East
and West Germany, Gorbachev
said it "is not a matter of topical
politics. Talking about reunifica
tion would mean interference in
the affairs" of the two countries,
according to Tass.
Poland and Hungary moved
away from single-party Commu
nist rule earlier this year. East
Germany reshuffled its leadership
this month and, in the most strik
ing reform, opened up the Berlin
Wall and allowed its citizens free
exit. Czechoslovakia also
liberalized its travel restrictions.
Other top Soviet officials joined

their president in condemning
Western attempts to interpret the
instability in the East bloc as sig
nifying the failure of socialism.
In Tokyo, Gorbachev adviser Al
exander Yakovlev said he was sur
prised by Western commentators
who interpret the tumult in the
region as demonstrating the fail
ure of socialism and Soviet policy.
"This is an obsolete, archaic
way of thinking," the Politburo
member told a news conference
yesterday. "We would like to have
a common European house based
on freedom. If someone interferes
in that process, we might go back
to the time of the Cold War."
Gorbachev's speech to the stu
dents touched on the widespread
alienation from the Communist
Party among Soviet youth and
their slack support for the Krem
lin's reforms.
His statements appeared at
least in part to be a response to
a recent poll published in the
state-controlled press that found
17 percent of Soviet students
thought the October Revolution
was a mistake.
He reprimanded students for
"sleeping through" the elections
to the Congress of People's
Deputies this spring, and warned
them that allowing their youthful
energy to lead them into pushing
for more radical reform could lead
to disaster.
Despite his support for East
Germany's changes, rumors that
Gorbachev would travel to Berlin
to participate in demolition of the
Berlin Wall are false, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said.

Nevertheless, Fitzwater said, all
the actions taken by the United
States "have been appropriate and
not been offensive and have had
the desired effect of offering our
support without inciting revolu
tion or other actions that would
take the process backward ... We
have no apologies or concern with
anything that we've done at this
point."
As for the reunification of East
and West Germany, Gorbachev
said it "is not a matter of topical
politics. Talking about reunifica
tion would mean interference in
the affairs" of the two countries,
according to Tass.
Poland and Hungary moved
away from single-party Commu
nist rule earlier this year. East
Germany reshuffled its leadership
this month and, in the most strik
ing reform, opened up the Berlin
Wall and allowed its citizens free
exit. Czechoslovakia also
liberalized its travel restrictions.
Other top Soviet officials joined

their president in condemning
Western attempts to interpret the
instability in the East bloc as sig
nifying the failure of socialism.
In Tokyo, Gorbachev adviser Al
exander Yakovlev said he was sur
prised by Western commentators
who interpret the tumult in the
region as demonstrating the fail
ure of socialism and Soviet policy.
"This is an obsolete, archaic
way of thinking," the Politburo
member told a news conference
yesterday. "We would like to have
a common European house based
on freedom. If someone interferes
in that process, we might go back
to the time of the Cold War."
Gorbachev's speech to the stu
dents touched on the widespread
alienation from the Communist
Party among Soviet youth and
their slack support for the Krem
lin's reforms.
His statements appeared at
least in part to be a response to
a recent poll published in the
state-controlled press that found
17 percent of Soviet students
thought the October Revolution
was a mistake.
He reprimanded students for
"sleeping through" the elections
to the Congress of People's
Deputies this spring, and warned
them that allowing their youthful
energy to lead them into pushing
for more radical reform could lead
to disaster.
Despite his support for East
Germany's changes, rumors that
Gorbachev would travel to Berlin
to participate in demolition of the
Berlin Wall are false, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said.

MOSCOW (AP) - President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev yesterday
rejected claims that reform in
Eastern Europe spell the demise
of socialism and insisted the Com
munist Revolution "was not a
mistake."
Speaking to a national student
conference in Moscow, Gorbachev
also said the existence of two Ger
manys "has been recognized by
the world community" since the
end of World War II and even talk
about reunification constitutes in
terference in the affairs of the
two countries.
The Soviet Union in the past
week has flatly opposed any sug
gestion that East and West Ger
many should be rejoined.
"Noting that certain forces in
the West try to create the impres
sion that profound changes in
socialist countries signify the fail
ure of socialist ideas, Gorbachev
said that this was wishful think
ing," according to the official
news agency Tass. It did not
specify which forces Gorbachev
had in mind.
In a televised speech that ran
almost two hours, Gorbachev
hammered home to students who
he seemed to suspect believed
otherwise that "the October revo
lution was not a mistake."
Using a persuasive, emotional
tone, Gorbachev extolled the ideol
ogy behind the 1917 Bolshevik
Revolution and condemned
"people who are trying to find the
roots of our troubles not in the
distortions of socialism that took
place, but in its very nature and
principles."
"We cannot allow dissatisfac

tion with ourselves, with how we
live now, to be transformed into
attempts to question our indis
putable, universally recognized
achievements and the choice of
socialism itself," he said.
That Gorbachev felt the need
to come to the defense of the most
basic ideological postulates of So
viet society indicated that they
are coming under ever wider at
tack as the country struggles
through economic crisis and sees
East bloc neighbors moving
toward multiparty systems.
In his remarks about East Ger
many, which were carried by Tass
but not shown on television, Gor
bachev expressed for the second
day in a row concern over Western
powers' response to the demo
cratic upheaval in Eastern Eu
rope.
At a meeting Tuesday with
French Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas he denounced calls for "ex
porting capitalism" to Eastern
Europe and said it was "useless
to clamor about victory in the
Cold War, about the disintegration
of some or another social system,"
Tass reported.
The White House said yesterday
it had "no apologies" for extolling
capitalism as a remedy for the
economic woes of Eastern Europe
and said the U.S. position should
not be offensive to Gorbachev.
Press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said President Bush
views the free-market economy of
the United States as the "pride
of the world and as a good way
to reform the economic problems
that they are facing.
"We certainly are proud of the
