As principal of George Washington Preparatory High School in South
Central Los Angeles, Dr. McKenna developed and implemented the
Preparatory School Model, stressing academic excellence at all
levels. In four years, he changed an inner-city school that had been
torn by violence, low achievement, and lack of community confidence
into one which now has an attendance waiting list, and where nearly
80% of the graduates enroll in college. His success has gained him
national recognition, and his programs are being widely modeled
throughout the nation.
