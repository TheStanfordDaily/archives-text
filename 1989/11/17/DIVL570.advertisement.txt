A NEW GENERATION OF
ASIC SYSTEM SOLUTIONS
ICS has been a provider of high performance, high density
CMOS ASIC chips since 1984 We solve customer problems by
offering chip, board, and system level product solutions. These
products are designed using DS/1, our advanced logic synthesis
based CAD system. DS/1 has produced many products including
the partitioning and synthesis of a 400,000 gate pipelined
computer system. We are now working on the next generation of
this very powerful tool.
ICS has entry level positions available in:
• ASIC Logic Design
• Static Timing Analysis
• lx)gic Optimization
• Logic Functional Verification
• Test Generation Software A Self Test Techniques
• ASIC Place arid Route
• Unix Kernel
• X windows Graphics Applications
• SQL Database Interface
If the above sounds interesting, meet us when we come to
campus NOV. Ist, NOV. 28th, write us at
the below address, or contact the CPPC.
