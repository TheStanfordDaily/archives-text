## Salvadoran priests slain, government denies involvement 
### 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP). â€” Armed
men killed and mutilated six Jesuit priests, their
housekeeper and her daughter yesterday after burst
ing into their house at a leading university. A witness
said uniformed government troops were involved.
The government denied responsibility, condemned
the slayings as "savage and irrational" and said an
investigation was under way.
The U.S. National Council of Churches also de
nounced the slayings, and the U.S. ambassador said
the slayings would have a "negative impact" on
President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government.
The killing were committed "with lavish bar
barity," said the Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit
Provincial for Central America. "For example, they
took out their brains," Tojeira said.
Roman Catholic Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas
compared the killings to the slaying of his predeces
sor, Oscar Arnulfo Romero. That 1980 assassination
marked the beginning of years of killings and kid
nappings by right-wing death squads.
"If this spiral of violence continues, death and
destruction will sweep away many, especially those
who are of most use to our people," said Rivera
Damas after leading a prayer over the mutilated
bodies.
The slayings came on the sixth day of fierce
combat around this capital following an attack by
leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
(FMLN) guerrillas.
The dead included Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of
Jose Simeon Canas Central American University,
and vice-rector Ignacio Martin-Baro, the country's
leading expert on polls and polling procedures. The
other dead priests, all educators, were Segundo
Montes, Amado Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno and
Joaquin Lopez Lopez.
A servant, Julia Elba Ramos, and her 15-year-old
daughter Celina, also were killed, said Tojeira.
"They did not want to leave witnesses," said
Eduardo Valdez, director of Jesuit Studies at the
university.
The educators had received death threats since
the heaviest fighting of the 10-year-old war began
Saturday, and callers to radio talk shows had vehe
mently chastised Jesuits as subversives and
demanded their expulsion or punishment.
The extreme right has for more than a decade
accused local Jesuits and their university of fostering
subversive ideology.
Rivera Damas said those who killed the priests
"were motivated by the same hate that snufTed out
the life of Monsignor Romero."
Romero was killed by a sniper while saying Mass
on March 24, 1980. Former President Jose Napoleon
Duarte blamed extreme rightists for that murder
and accused ideologue Roberto D'Aubuisson of mas
terminding the assassination.
D'Aubuisson is a national legislator and honorary
president of Cristiani's Arena party. Arena oppo
nents, including the FMLN, have said frequently
that they feared a resurgence of death squads since
Cristiani took over from Duarte on June 1.

In a communique, the government's National In
formation Center said the crime "is intended to
destabilize the democratic process and increase even
more the climate of anguish created by the FMLN."
A witness said the killers were part of a detail
of about 30 uniformed army or police troops that
entered the house before dawn, according to another
priest who lives nearby. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
The government and armed forces denied that
troops or police were involved and said the killings
would be investigated.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Mar
garet Tutwiler said the U.S. ambassador would ask
the Salvadoran government Thursday for "a full
inquiry into this horrendous act."
The ambassador, William Walker, called the
slayings "a barbaric act that has not only brought
shame to El Salvador but will leave a gaping hole
in this country's intellectual and academic commu
nity."
Walker compared the killings to the Dec. 2, 1980,
slayings by troops of U.S. Maryknoll nuns Ita Ford
and Maura Clarke, Ursuline sister Dorothy Kazel

and lay worker Jean Donovan.
"It is obviously going to have a negative impact
on the government of El Salvador," said Walker.
He said that he did not know anything about the
report that government troops were involved and
offered to protect the witness, who is in hiding.
The United States has supported a succession of
governments in the civil war against the FMLN
that has taken more than 70,000 lives with more
than $4 billion in military and economic aid this
decade.
Valdez said the slayings occurred about 3 a.m.,
three hours before the end of a dusk-to-dawn curfew
clamped on the city. He said neighbors reported
hearing gunshots, but thought that it was part of
the general fighting.
Another priest said the witness, who did not want
to be seen by reporters, saw about 30 uniformed
soldiers enter the university grounds and the priests'
residence shortly before the shots rang out.
"There have been soldiers posted at the gate since
Sunday. The murders were committed in the middle
of a curfew. The same house where they were killed
was raided and searched by soldiers on Tuesday,"
he said.
