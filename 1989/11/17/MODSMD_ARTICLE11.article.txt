### Jim Ron Editorial staff 
Stanford faculty close to the Jesuit priests slain
in El Salvador expressed shock and anger at yes
terday's murders and said more killings would follow
if U.S. officials do not take immediate action to
rein in the Salvadoran army and death squads.
"I expect more of these cases in the coming days
unless there is immediate pressure by the United
States," said Terry Karl, a visiting assistant pro
fessor of political science.
"U.S. pressure works in El Salvador," she said,
citing the millions of dollars in aid the United States
gives to El Salvador.
Karl, a specialist on Latin America, had phoned

Ignacio Martin-Baro, the murdered
vice rector of the University of Cen
tral America, hours before gunmen
in Salvadoran military uniforms
burst into his home and reportedly
tortured him before shooting him
to death.
"He said the Army had sur
rounded the university since Wed
nesday afternoon and were allowing
no one to enter or exit," she said.

Karl has worked closely with the Jesuit academics
over the last seven years. "They were extraordinarily
generous with their time, and were helpful to Ph.D.
students of mine," she recalled.
Describing the Jesuits at the university as social
researchers highly respected by both left and right
for their accuracy, Karl termed the killings "a tre
mendous blow for the prospects of a negotiated
settlement."
Lutheran campus pastor Herb Schmidt first met
Ignacio Ellacuria, one of the priests who were killed,
over two years ago when leading a group of Stanford
students in reconstruction efforts after El Salvador's
1987 earthquake.
"Ignacio was an outspoken critic of the govern
ment and a spokesman for the poor," he recalled.
Schmidt added that Ignacio and other churah
members were aware that their activities on behalf
of the Salvadoran poor placed them in danger from
right-wing death squads.
"They knew because of their commitment to the
truth, they were, in a sense, already dead," he said.
Karl appealed to Stanford students to place them
selves in Salvadoran students' shoes.
"I think it is important for everyone to understand
what it means to be in a university surrounded by
the military . . . and have your professors dragged
out and killed."
A vigil for yesterday's victims will be held today
at noon at Lytton plaza in downtown Palo Alto,,
