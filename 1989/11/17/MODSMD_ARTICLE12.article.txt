# Soviet easing of travel restrictions elicits lukewarm response
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Soviet
Union is nearing final passage of historic
legislation establishing the right to travel,
but U.S. trade barriers will give way only
gradually.
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mos
bacher said yesterday the Soviet travel
legislation will not lead to an immediate
dismantling of tariffs erected by Congress
15 years ago on behalf of Soviet Jews.
He said the Soviets, at best, would get
only a year-to-year waiver while restric
tions on trade credits would remain in
place.
"We'll review it to see if it is sufficient,"
Mosbacher said of the Soviet legislation
that is expected to clear its final hurdle
by December. "We can't prejudge that."
He did not spell out the U.S. conditions
at a joint news conference with Konstan

tin Katushev, the Soviet minister of
foreign economic affairs. But he said the
process could take "a lot longer" than
his initial guess of one to three months.
Besides, Mosbacher said, a new trade
agreement with the Soviet Union would
have to be negotiated first. The last ac
cord was nullified by Moscow in 1975 in
retaliation for the erection of tariff bar
riers to Soviet goods a year earlier.
Mosbacher and Katushev signed com
mercial agreements designed to to con
sider a new trade agreement "on a pre
liminary basis," Mosbacher said.
But, he added: "We want to make clear
that we are not beginning negotiation of
a trade agreement. This can come only
after the Soviets codify their emigration
legislation and after a waiver under the
Jackson-Vanik amendment becomes pos

sible."
The legislation imposed tariffs against
Soviet goods that are not applied to the
exports of most other countries. The
restriction on trade credits, known as the
Stevenson amendment, was adopted in a
parallel move by Congress.
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who has
pushed for wider Jewish emigration, said
in a statement: "The Soviet Union is
making real progress. But going all the
way toward granting most-favored nation
status strikes me as premature.
"There are several issues that need to
be cleaned up. There are 600 long-term
'refuseniks' who should be freed before
we extend the carrot of MFN status."
The National Conferece on Soviet
Jewry said, meanwhile, in a statement:
"We welcome the initiative by the Soviet

government in bringing before the Su
preme Soviet a draft law providing for
freedom of entry and exit."
The conference lists 51,336 Jews as
emigrating from the Soviet Union by the
end of October. The exodus surpasses the
all-time high of 51,320 reached in 1979.
Anticipating U.S. action to facilitate
trade, Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin
told reporters at the Soviet embassy: "We
are expecting some positive steps from
the U.S. side." He called the Soviet leg
islation a breakthrough and evidence of
"new thinking."
The legislation establishes the right of
all Soviet citizens to travel abroad —
permanently or on visits — and reduces
or eliminates most restrictions in effect
now.
Dubinin linked the legislation, which

is bound to accelerate an already quick
ening pace of Jewish, ethnic German,
Armenian and Pentecostal emigration, to
President Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to
restructure the Soviet economy.
Two-way trade now amounts to abopt
$3 billion. American grain sales to the
Soviet Union account for about $2 billion.
By contrast, Soviet trade with West
Germany is nearly $7.6 billion a ye&r
and with Finland, a much smaller coun
try, $6 billion annually.
Katushev said American businesses
were eager to invest in the Soviet Union
and were seeking "a favorable approach"
from the Bush administration.
"We have no prejudices at all to selling
to America,"he said through a Russian
translator. "We would like to see Amer
ican women in Soviet furs."
