# Israeli donates heart to Palestinian

JERUSALEM (AP) - The
heart of an Israeli soldier am
bushed and killed by Arab guer
rillas was sewn into the chest of
a Palestinian yesterday, a gift of
life that family members said
transcends the bitter war between
Arab and Jew.
Hanna Khader, 54, a former
hotel manager from Israeli
annexed east Jerusalem, was
recovering in stable condition in
the intensive care ward at Hadas
sah medical center, Khader's fam
ily said.
"God, I don't really know what
to say," said his daughter, Jamilla.
"We thank the family that agreed
to give the heart to a human being
without looking if he were an Arab
or a Jew."
Khader's wife, Mary, said: "I
can't tell you how happy 1 am.
He's a human being and there is
no difference between a Palestin
ian and an Israeli in such cases."
Jamilla told Israel radio the
family learned from the media
that her father's heart donor was
a slain Israeli soldier.
She indicated her family had
some concern that they could be
targeted by Palestinian or Islamic
radicals for accepting an Israeli's
heart, but said "in such cases we
cannot mix politics with medi
cine."
"I hope that the events (in the
occupied territories! will end and
everything will return to normal,"
she added.
The heart was removed from
Sgt. Zeev Traum, 40, after he died
Wednesday night of a head wound
suffered after Palestinian guerril

'We thank the family
that agreed to give
the heart to a human
being without looking
if he were an Arab or
a Jew.'

las raked his patrol jeep with at
least 28 rounds of automatic gun
fire in an ambush Monday, Israel
radio said. A second soldier also
was killed.
Traum, an army reservist and
father of four, was the 42nd Is
raeli to die in the violence of the
23-month uprising against Israeli
rule. At least 615 Palestinians
have been killed by Israeli troops
or civilians in the bloodshed. An
other 146 Palestinians have been
slain by others who accused them
of collaborating with Israeli au
thorities.
In an interview with Israel tele
vision that broke a day of silence,
Brenda Traum refused comment
when asked whether she agreed
to the doctor's request to
transplant her husband's heart
into the body of an Arab.
She did say, however, that she
believed her husband would have
agreed to donate an organ if it
could save a life.
"If it is possible to save a per
son, I think it is a religious com
mandment," she said, speaking
from her home in Yodfat, a col
lective farm where Traum raised
flowers for export.
"Zeev was a man who helped
people as a natural matter of

course, without being asked," she
said. "We spoke about transplants
a bit and he said it was a good
thing."
Hadassah hospital took the un
usual step of asking doctors and
spokesmen not to comment on the
transplant, Israel radio said, ap
parently because of the operation's
sensitive political nature.
Azai Applebaum, the director
of cardiology, broke the silence last
night and appeared on television.
"We treat the sick and we have
never looked at nationality or
identity," he said. "I don't think
that this point has significance in
an operation like this."
Israel radio said Traum's con
dition began deteriorating rapidly
Tuesday night and doctors asked
the family to agree to donate his
heart to one of dozens of Israelis
and Arabs waiting for a
transplant.
The family agreed and Khader
was chosen as a recipient because
his body tissue closely matched
that of Traum.
The heart was flown in a special
ice chest by military helicopter
from Soroka hospital in Beer
Sheva to Jerusalem's Hadassah
hospital at midnight Wednesday
night.
It was the ninth heart
transplant performed in Israel but
the first known case since the
uprising began of an Israeli donat
ing an organ to a Palestinian.
In December, the family of a
Palestinian youth shot to death
by an Israeli soldier in the West
Bank town of Nablus refused to
donate their son's heart to an Is
raeli civilian.
