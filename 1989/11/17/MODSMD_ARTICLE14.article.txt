Nicaraguan cease-fire attempted
WASHINGTON (AP) — Negotiators for the
Nicaraguan government and the Contra rebels
resumed cease-fire talks last night after the rebel
delegation withdrew a proposal for a weeklong
recess.
But after five days of talks, mistrust between
the two sides appeared to be on the increase as
each accused the other of wanting to prolong the
war.
A Sandinista spokesman said the Contras
agreed to resume the talks after offering as
surances that a serious attempt would be made
to reach agreement on a cease-fire.
The chief Contra delegate, Col. Enrique Ber
mudez, called on the Sandinistas to accept a
proposal offered by Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo, the main feature of which is a
cease-fire in place. There are an estimated 5,000
rebels inside Nicaraguan territory.
Non-Communist seats awarded
WEST BERLIN (AP) - The East German
leadership agreed yesterday to give more than
one-third o f the seats in the new Cabinet to
non-Communists, who now have only four,
sources involved in the negotiations reported.

small parties that have been allied with the Com
munists, said Premier Hans Modrow would
reduce the Cabinet from 44 members to 26 or
27 and assign at least 11 ministries to non-
Communists. A West German newspaper reported
a Lutheran Church leader and a prominent lawyer
would be among those named.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said
people of East Germany must decide on German
reunification, but the top Kremlin adviser on
German affairs ruled it out.
Nikolai Portugalov said in an interview with
the Soviet news agency Novosti there will be two

German states "for the foreseeable future and
also in the long term."
