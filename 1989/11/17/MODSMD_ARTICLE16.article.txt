THEY SAY the world is the
greatest classroom of all, yet
all too often Stanford stu
dents limit themselves to the world
of libraries and lectures.
Getting off campus and discov
ering the real world means not
only going overseas or even check
ing out downtown Palo Alto; it in
cludes exploring mountains, lakes
and forests.
For seven quarters, the Outdoor
Education Program at Stanford
has offered students a unique op
portunity to acquire and apply wil
derness skills. This quarter, 12 ad
venturous souls chose to bypass the
usual tennis or golf and tackle rock
climbing, hiking and camping in
the one-unit "Wilderness Skills"
class.
But now, the course is in danger
of being eliminated because of a
lack of funds and volunteers to
teach the class.
Because the graduate student
who founded the course and has
since volunteered as its general co
ordinator is stepping down, the

Athletic Department would have to
hire a full-time professional in
structor to continue offering the
class.
Yet, department officials say
they can not gather the necessary
funds without eliminating other es
tablished curriculum.
If the money is not forthcoming
for a professional coordinator, the
Athletic Department and the cur
rent volunteer instructors should
search for other people — perhaps
students who have taken the course
in the past — to take over the
instruction.
Another option is to continue the
program through the volunteer-led
Tresidder Union programs. This
way, while the course would no
longer be offered for academic
credit, it would still be available
to future lawyers or bankers and
ensure that, while at Stanford,
they would not only learn how to
win an important case or survive
on Wall Street, but also how to
navigate a river or survive in the
wilderness.
