# Season in a season
## 
### 
TOMORROW, ALL THE dis
appointment of the 1989
football season will be wiped
away. When Stanford takes the
field at 3:30 p.m. to face the
dreaded California Golden Bears,
the Cardinal's 2-8 record won't
mean a thing.
The 92nd Big Game is, as al
ways, the season with in a season
for Stanford and Cal. The winner
has bragging rights for winter and
spring — and, of course, the Axe.
The loser — well, let's not even
think about that possibility.
Though the Cardinal has been
decimated by injuries this year, no
one could question the team's char
acter. Never did Stanford give any
indication it was giving up while
the losses mounted. For that, we

salute them.
These student-athletes who give
their all on the gridiron each Sat
urday and on the practice fields
throughout the week, also give
everything they've got in the class
room. For that, too, we salute
them.
Coach Denny Green and his staff
have brought back the faith to
Stanford football. Down the road,
they are likely to deliver the wins
as well.
A victory tomorrow would be a
good starting point. It would give
the Cardinal a good feeling to carry
them through the off-season and
would also serve as a sweet send-off
for the graduating seniors.
To the Cardinal: our best wishes
and a hearty "Beat Cal!"
