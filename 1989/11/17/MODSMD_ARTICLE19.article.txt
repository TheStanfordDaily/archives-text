## Realizing the reality of rape 
### 
AS A FRESHMAN, I remember
reading the fliers in the dining
room entitled "Rethinking Rape."
I wasn't exactly sure what that meant,
and my friends and I routinely dismissed
them. What was there to rethink? I was
already convinced that rape was bad.
I still am, but now I also understand
the point of the fliers. The Stanford Rape
Education Project put on an extraordi
nary Rape Awareness Week last spring
that brought the question of "rethinking
rape" into focus for those that attended
the programs. The only fault with it was
that it was not made mandatory for the
entire campus.
This fall, the project made a vital con
tribution to Freshman Orientation with
the publication and distribution of
"Reforging Relationships," a 40-page
booklet that examines the problem of rape
at Stanford and in America, how to cope
with it and how to combat it. Of the
roughly 200 pounds of orientation litera
ture that an incoming freshman receives,
this booklet may have been the most
important.
I hope most freshmen didn't throw it
away, and upperclassmen should seek it
out. If you don't think you have cause
to worry, consider that 37 percent of grad
uate and 29 percent of undergraduate
women reported at least one incident of
sexual coercion in their lifetimes, accord
ing to a 1988 Rape Education Project
survey. If that doesn't make you think,
consider this. Suppose you have a mother,
a sister and a girlfriend: The odds are
that one has been or will be raped. Chill
ing, isn't it?

Two recent incidents at Stanford have
underscored the need for greater rape
education on campus. First, the at
tempted rape in the Foothills several
weeks back displayed a woman's per
petual vulnerability to rape; a woman
doesn't have to wear a miniskirt to a
singles' bar to be vulnerable.
Second, the awe-inspiring leap of logic
that Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes exhibited last week reveals the
desperate need to "rethink rape" as an
act, not just a violation of a legal statute.
In response to a report of an attempted
sexual assault at a Stanford fraternity
party, Hughes declared that the lack of
substantiated evidence meant that the
assault probably did not occur.
Hughes' false logic exposes a tragic
ignorance of rape. Rape is the single most
unreported crime in America, inhibiting
any discussion or understanding by the
vast majority who won't take the time
to learn. As Suzanne O'Brien of the proj
ect points out, "We have to understand
what happens to the victims, not just
what happens."
Hughes' response reveals a blindness
to the big picture. So what if the report
is false? Does Hughes' callous response
make it any easier for a victim to come
forward? No, it only intimidates future
victims.
Rape, the act, is even subject to dan
gerous misunderstanding. Date and ac
quaintance rape has only been widely;
recognized in the last five years, yet it
is the most widespread and destructive
form of the crime. Still, due to the
humiliation, anguish and fear of harrass

ment, it makes up less than one-tenth of
reported rapes.
Doctors and psychologists have
diagnosed the post-rape depression many
victims suffer as Rape Syndrome, a strain
of post-traumatic stress disorder most
frequently associated with war veterans.
The connection is clear. "Rape is not an
act of sex," O'Brien reiterates. "It is an
act of violence and a need to dominate."
Awareness of rape — and greater com
passion for its victims — will only im
prove when the "forbidden fruit" aura of
sex is removed from the stigma of rape,
and we understand the physical and emo
tional damage done to the victims.
Rethinking rape, then, is more than
just making a single normative judgment
that rape is bad. It involves understand
ing that rape does not just occur when
a ski-masked assailant leaps from behind
a tree: It involves rethinking the attitudes
that have pushed rape and rape education
to a fringe concern; and it involves ret
hinking the effects of rape on the victim
and the way the victim and the crime
must be treated. There will be no com
plete cure, but there is vast room for
desperately needed improvement.
