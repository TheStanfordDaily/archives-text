## University questions fund raising, name use by conservative journal 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
As it attempts to become an
independent corporation, The
Stanford Review has become
embroiled in a dispute with the
University over the use of the
name "Stanford" and the paper's
unorthodox fund-raising prac
tices.
The two camps have not yet
formally discussed these issues,
and until they do, the status of
The Review's incorporation ef
forts remain unclear. The Review
is in the process of filing incor
poration papers.
Under the standard policy for
student group fund raising,
alumni gifts can be made to Stan
ford and directed toward a certain
program, according to Michael
Ramsey-Perez, director of Student
Organization Services.
But The Review seeks char
itable donations directly from
alumni, according to Ramsey-
Perez. The publication received
approximately $25,000 in alumni
contributions over the summer,
Review Editor in Chief David Wal
lace said.
The Review's direct appeals to
alumni "can be counterproductive
to the University," because
alumni bombarded with fund
raising requests may not contrib
ute at all, Ramsey-Perez said.
"We're trying to persuade The

Stanford Review that they can
achieve their goals by going
through normal University pro
cesses," he said.
However, Wallace said he was
unclear about the University's
guidelines for fund raising "as far
as what is solicited and what
isn't."
Most of The Review's money
comes from unsolicited donations,
Wallace said. The Review did not
start on its campaign of direct
solicitation until the incorporation
process began, he said.
Aside from questioning The
Review's fund-raising activities,
the University has hinted at
prohibiting the weekly from using
the name "Stanford" once the
paper incorporates.
The University owns its name,
and only Stanford organizations
can use it, Ramsey-Perez said.
Once The Review incorporates, it
may need permission from the
University to continue publishing
under the Stanford name, he said.
Review Opinions Editor Keith
Rabois said the University's mo
tives are "purely political. I doubt
that if we were writing left-wing
stuff they'd make us change our
name," he said.
In addition to changing the
weekly's name, the University
may also limit The Review's access
to campus facilities if the two can
not come to an agreement,
Ramsey-Perez said.
