## Racist words shatter optimistic vision, inflict pain 
### 
I AM WRITING this letter on a
Mac II at the Meyer library com
puter cluster with a hard disk
called "Killing reds in Nam." When I
save my file, it will accompany others
someone has entitled "Chinks n' gooks"
and "Fresh meat."
I am furious that some student has
named these files and applications with
racist epithets and references to
brutality. Furious, but I will not
change the names with a simple click
of the mouse and some pecks at the
keyboard.
The names are too eloquent, much
more so than this letter could ever
hope to be. What need have I to try to
explain that racial hatred has not
passed when these names tell the story
for me?
Why waste my breath refuting the
common elitist insinuation that only

Racist words bring back a flood of half-forgotten,
deliberately forgotten incidents that one tries not to
remember, lest a pattern emerge.

Archie Bunker lower-class throwbacks
could ever conceivably use such words,
not computer-literate Stanford stu
dents?
Why bother trying to explain the
links between racism, foreign policy,
mass psychology and the Stockton
massacre when the verbal collage of
"Killing reds in Nam," "Chinks n'
gooks" and "Fresh meat" draw it out
in black and white?
I understand that not everyone feels
the way that the vandal did, secretly
giggling as he played his naughty trick

at the computer. I assume he'd never
say such scandalous words out loud,
and is politically correct when the need
arises.
I know and truly believe that such
knives cut me less often than they cut
my African-American brothers and
Chicana sisters. And I understand that
anger alone is not a solution.
But I will never understand when I
am told that such occurences are in
consequential. When such expressions
are scribbled on bathroom walls, said
out loud in plain words or pop up on
your computer screen, they cannot be

denied, and this is their power.
The pain these words can inflict is
deeper than most who never hear them
can imagine. It is not just the scorn of
the words, not even the brutality of
their connotation â€” fresh meat of
dead chinks, like dead gooks in the
jungle.
It's that the words bring back a
flood of half-forgotten, deliberately
forgotten incidents that one tries not
to remember, lest a pattern emerge.
And all of a sudden the familiar jeer,
or the pointed remark, or the words on
the computer screen shatter the opti
mistic vision we all prefer.
The names are in the computer's
memory and will stay. And my anger
is in my memory, and will stay a little
while.
