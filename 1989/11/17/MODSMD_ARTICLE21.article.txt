# Closing Greek parties would only increase hostility
## 
### 
The new fraternal advisor, Michael
Hughes, is concerned that there may
be much hostility in the Stanford com
munity toward Greek organizations,
and he attributes this hostility to the
perception of fraternities as institutions
focused on parties and alcohol.
He says, "There is no real role for
open parties on campus. They don't
perform a function in this institution,"
(The Daily, Nov. 14). He suggests
changing Greek all-campus parties to a
smaller, closed get-together between
fraternities and sororities to lessen this
hostility, but I cannot see that this
change would do anything but enhance

the problem.
Open parties, rather than having no
function as he claims, have the very
function of bringing Greeks and non-
Greeks together. He claims that closed
parties are not exclusive because every
one in the community has the opportu
nity to rush, but this makes no sense.
According to Webster's New World
Dictionary, exclusive means "shutting
out certain people or groups," and
such parties certainly would shut out
all freshmen, students who don't want
to make a commitment to a sorority or
fraternity and, most obviously, those
who have rushed and not received a
bid. This exclusivity would only in
crease the hostility which Hughes
wants to challenge.
It is true that what we Stanford
non-Greeks hear most about the frater
nities and sororities is their parties,
but closing Greek parties to the rest of
the campus is not the way to solve
this problem.

If Hughes wants to challenge
"Greekism," he should publicize Greek
community service activities and hold
campuswide Greek-sponsored
workshops on alcohol abuse and other
issues.
Let the rest of Stanford know what
there is to sororities and fraternities
besides parties. But don't reinforce old
stereotypes by making fraternities and
sororities more separatist.
