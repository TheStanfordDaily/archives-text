# Pro-choicers must preserve dignity and not name-call

### 
Attending Tuesday's Pro-Choice Rally
both stirred and angered me. I firmly

believe in the pro-choice position; how
ever, the inflammatory rhetoric used
by some speakers deeply offends me.
Diana Workman of Family Planning
Alternatives gives sound advice to pro
choice supporters when she calls on us
to "be outraged, be passionate." Out
rage and passion, however, should not
be reduced to name-calling.
When Workman called Operation
Rescue members "lunatics," she
resorted to schoolyard name-calling.
However insidious and dangerous we
find the actions of Operation Rescue,
we cannot forget that the pro-choice
movement is at its core a movement
about human dignity; the right of each
individual to control her or his body is
fundamental to human dignity. In
waging a battle for human dignity, one
must model dignified behavior, espe
cially when treating the enemy.
