## Business School students reach out to public sector 
### Lesley Barnes 
Not all MBAs have CEO men
talities.
Believe it or not, some business
school students are looking for
something more personally fulfill
ing than a lucrative job offer and
the promise of corporate prestige.
Some business students are really
more interested in public service,
and for those who are, the Public
Management Program at Stanford
exists to give them theoretical and
practical experience in the field.
"We're a business school con
cerned with public service and
public policy," said Jim
Thompson, director of the pro
gram. "We're about using the
skills we get here to make non
profit and government organiza
tions more effective."
The Public Management Pro
gram, an enhancement of Stan
ford's core MBA program,
prepares students to improve the
effectiveness of public organiza
tions and to play leadership roles
in them.
Initiated in 1971, the program,
which consists of workshops,
speakers and hands-on public
service activity, is a voluntary as
sociation of people committed to
public service. It is supported and
structured through tne business
school, with a budget provided by
corporate and individual spon
sors. This year, Thompson said,
the program is operating on a
$40,000 budget.
The program currently has
more than 700 alumni, and inter
est has been increasing in recent
years. According to Thompson,
the program attracted 44 students
in the class of 1988, 65 in the
class of 1989, and 85 have enrolled
in the class of 1990. Thompson
said there are 64 students already
enrolled from the class of 1991,
and he expects many more to join
during the year.
The only requirement for en
trance into the program is the
completion of two essays. Stu
dents can apply when they apply
for regular admission to the Busi

ness School, or they can join dur
ing the year just by completing
the essays. In order to earn a
Public Management Certificate
along with an MBA, students
must take three core Public Man
agement Program courses. Earn
ing the certificate is not a
requirement of program member
ship, however.
The program fosters a model of
people moving back and forth be
tween the public and private sec
tors, according to Thompson.
There is a great deal of crossover
between the two spheres in busi
ness due to financial considera
tions and job satisfaction, he
explained.
"Everyone in the Business
School will at some point come in
contact with the public sector,"
according to Steven Barg, student
coordinator of the program. He
said that part of the program's
mission is to break down "at
titudinal barriers" between the
private and public sectors.
According to Thompson, most
PMP students still take private
sector jobs right after graduation
— an average of only 2 to 6 per
cent of graduating students take
non-private-sector jobs. The typ
ical debt load of a Stanford Busi
ness School graduate is $20,000
to $40,000, so financial consider
ations push students toward the
more lucrative private sector, he
added.
There is, however, tremendous
interest in doing volunteer or
public-service work in addition to
a career, Thompson said. "I see
it in students' individual lives.
They want a balanced life, includ
ing career, public service and a
family — personal fulfillment," he
explained.
For this reason, the program
encourages students to at least ex
plore the possibility of a career
in public service. According to Leo
Redmond, head of the program's
careers committee, "My basic goal
is to encourage people to investi
gate, and hopefully take, public
service jobs." Redmond is cur
rently conducting a survey of stu

dents who have held public-service
jobs and setting up a job bank of
accumulated leads and job possi
bilities.
Thompson said a big part of the
Public Management Program is
the Public Management Initiative,
a series of speakers, panel discus
sions, volunteer projects, semi
nars and informal discussions
dealing with a particular public
policy issue. The series was
started three years ago by Assoc.
Dean Jim Patell, who stressed
that the initiative is a volunteer
program designed solely by stu
dents.
"I find students much more en
thusiastic about participating in
a program in which they have a
role in the design," he explained.
Patell described first-year busi
ness students as "consumers of
the program." For their second
year, however, the students take
an active role, and choose the topic
to be addressed. This year the
subject is "Corporate and Com
munity Convergence," an exam
ination of the relationship
between business and society. Ac
cording to Patell, second-year stu
dents "inherit a clean beach with
no footprints," but have the ad
vantage of a supportive environ
ment and the necessary
infrastructure to support the pro
gram.
Patell emphasized that the
Business School is not trying to
compete with schools of govern
ment or public policy, but wants
to offer an aspect of public service
in depth. "It's important not to
be superficial," he noted.
Highlights of this year will in
clude speakers such as Michael
Dukakis and Norman Lear, a vol
unteer project with a shelter for
the homeless, a weekend retreat
to debate corporate responsibility,
and a trip to Washington to meet
with elected officials and mem
bers of the labor community, busi
ness organizations and govern
ment agencies.
With a high-powered schedule
like this, the series is not just a
subset of the Public Management

Program, and in fact attracts the
interest and talents of many stu
dents not enrolled in the program.
More than 100 students are help
ing organize different aspects of
the initiative, according to series
chair Melanie Dulbecco.
Dulbecco added that she has
seen a resurgence of interest in
public service among business
school students, and that this
trend is supported and promoted
by the Public Management Pro
gram.
Redmond concurred, and said
he has been very impressed with
the program overall. He said he
doubted the program would lead
more students to public-service
jobs in the short run, but it will,
he claimed, spur people to do
periodic volunteering and non
profit work throughout their
lives.
Perhaps as an additional prod,
Redmond said he is developing an
informal program called "Second
Summer," which encourages stu
dents to take public sector jobs or
internships the summer after they
graduate. Since starting dates for
most jobs fall in October, this
gives students a couple of months
to contribute to public service.
Only a handful of people have
done this each year, he said, but
he would like to enlarge the pro
gram.
"I want to take the experiences
of those adventurous few and
make it a cultural norm, make it
the cool thing to do," Redmond
said. "Once people have become
secure and accepted a job, they
have a summer free to do some
thing low-risk. That's the window
[to public service.]"
According to Thompson, the
Business School is blessed with
"an amazing faculty" that is very
concerned with public-sector is
sues. Business school professors
who are well-known for their
public-service contributions in

George Shulz and former Secre
tary of Health, Education and
