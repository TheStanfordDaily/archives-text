# Bug ponders relation of zippers, students and the CIA
## 
### 
Dear Bug,
I stay up late at night just think
ing about this puzzling question:
What does the "YKK" on zippers
stand for?
— Tossing and Turning
Well, Tossing, I found your
question a convenient excuse to
inspect the zippers of some of my
closer female friends and found
that, indeed, no matter whether
they were wearing Guess or
Generra, their zippers had the in
itials "YKK." I also found out that
Jockey now makes briefs for wom
en. But that's another story.
At first, I thought these mys
terious letters may have been the
initials of some unusually promis
cuous tailor or, perhaps, sorority.
But I had an inkling that the
truth lay much, much deeper than
that. There had to be some reason
so many Stanford students were
walking around with the exact
same tags on their zippers.
I then called the Top Stitch
Sewing Company in Belmont to
confirm my suspicions. Sure
enough, "Henry Ford" answered
the phone. And where the Repub
licans are, I thought, the CIA
must be as well — as demonstra
ted by George Bush, for example,
or our very own Lou Hoover.
But Henry would not admit to
any knowledge of some kind of
plot between the U.S. government
and Stanford involving these YKK
zippers. "YKK stands for some
Japanese company," he
responded.
Sensing my growing suspicion,
he hastened to add, "But made

in the USA — based in the USA."
I wasn't satisfied, and pressed
him further. "I don't know"he
protested. "I used to know, but
everybody just uses the initials,"
he continued quickly.

I could tell I was getting
nowhere. This Henry Ford was
surely too low in the CIA
hierarchy to be of much help. I
got his contact's number in Los
Angeles, the site of the alleged
YKK zipper company's headquar
ters.
"YKK. May I help you?" an
swered the receptionist. I asked
her what YKK stood for. But this
was a thoroughly professional op
eration. Even the receptionists
had no idea what YKK stood for.
She transferred me to her supe
rior, the slick-talking Rollie Roth.
I questioned Rollie Roth about
his position of leadership. "I'm
the controller," he slipped acci
dentally. "But I'm not the corpo
rate controller," he hastily
clarified, "I'm the division con
troller." Right. Just like Ollie

North was only a colonel. In fact,
notice the similarity of "Rollie
Roth" to "Ollie North." A coinci
dence, you say?
I think not. I knew I was talking
to the mastermind behind the
whole operation, a man who would
not be easily fooled. So I played
along with him, acting as if I was
some naive fool who just wanted
to know about zippers. (No of
fense, "Tossing" — or at least very
little.)
So I asked him about the zip
pers, and the YKK's role in the
manufacture and distribution
thereof. It turns out that YKK
claims to be "the world's largest
line of zippers." YKK makes zip
pers for all kindsa companies,
from Levi Strauss to Laura Ashley
to Patagonia — extruded plastic
zippers for ladies' wear, nylon zip
pers for ski parkas and the like,
and brass and aluminum zippers
for jeans. YKK is based in Macon,
Ga., where they have over two
million square feet (Gosh!) of zip
per manufacturing plants.
Rollie further established the
link between YKK and the U.S.
government when he mentioned
that YKK was "recruited" by
Jimmy Carter. "I shook hands
with Jimmy just last month,"
Rollie stated. "He was here to say
goodbye to the retiring president
of YKK. They're good friends."
By "recruited," Rollie meant that
the Japanese company had been
encouraged to establish itself in
Georgia. "In fact," Rollie contin
ued, "Georgia is the state with
the second largest Japanese in-

I knew I was talking to

hind the whole opera
tion.

vestment. Next to California."
Rollie may have been slick, but
apparently he had not carefully
studied his 50 states in fifth
grade. Georgia is not next to Cal
ifornia.
I seemed to have sufficiently
lulled any suspicions Rollie Roth
may have had, so I sprang the
question: "What does YKK stand
for?"
YKK, he informed me, stood for

Yoshida Manufacturing Company.
Then the initials should be YMC,
right? No. The "KK," Rollie ex
plained, stood for the Japanese
equivalent of "Manufacturing
Company." I guess, then, that the
KKK to the Japanese means
merely "the Ku Manufacturing
Company."
I had heard enough. I thanked
Rollie Roth and hung up.
Stanford students' zippers, the
U.S. Government, the CIA and
shady Japanese and American or
ganizations — how did it all fig
ure? Where did it come together?
It didn't seem to.
But then I realized the awful
truth — these YKK zippers, I am
convinced, are the target markers
for a network of orbiting Japanese
laser satellites, established by

Stanford and the CIA to ensure
that we pay our college loans —
or suffer instant laser sterilization
by satellite. All this to ensure that
Stanford is able to pay back its
debts to Japanese investors.
And you wondered why there
were always mobs of Japanese
"tourists" wandering the Quad,
looking like they owned the place?
They do.
In the meantime, if you see a
glint of red light from Hoover
Tower focusing on the crotch of
your Levis, you'd better run for
cover, lest you find yourself with
a more permanent type of Planned
Parenthood.
