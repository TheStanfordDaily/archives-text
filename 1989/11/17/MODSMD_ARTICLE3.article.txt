# Chinese intellectuals here rethinking concept of authority
## 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the final
article in a foiir-part series on the
Chinese student movement at
Stanford. Several of those inter
viewed withheld their names
because of concerns for family
members remaining in China.

Stanford graduate student
Huang Jingsheng knows well
what the absence of democracy
means for China. In 1980, the
only time China allowed contested
elections for the National People's
Congress, he ran against the of
ficial Communist Party candi
date.

"Even though I lost, after the
election I was viewed as a political
troublemaker. Although I was at
the top of my class, the adminis
tration refused to give me my
degree. They wouldn't assign me
a job in the field I was interested
in,"he says.
Although his background of po
litical activism is atypical among
Chinese students at Stanford,
Huang's commitment to the dem
ocratic path of change in China
is shared by his colleagues.
Their experiences in the United
States and the failure of reform
in China are leading some Chinese
intellectuals here to rethink the
Chinese concept of authority.
For many Chinese students, life

in the United States provides con
crete evidence to back up their
democratic visions. "Since I have
lived in this country for such a
long time, I believe people have
the right to freedom of expression,
and the government has to listen
to them," says graduate student
"Lin Ming."
Soul-searching in the U.S.
David Ai, a project manager at
Hewlett-Packard who has worked
with Chinese students at Stan
ford, says, "By being here, and
by being able to see how free and
fair society here is, a lot of Chi
nese students have come through
a very deep soul-searching. They
have to ask themselves 'How did

the U.S. get here?' and 'What is
wrong with China?' The answers
affirm their commitment to true
democracy."

"Coming here," says graduate
student Zhou Xueguang, "we
realize there are other options
than what we have now. Before,
we were trying to help the gov
ernment to overcome its prob
lems, but now we realize the

government cannot do what we
want it to."
"Traditionally, in China we
have believed that men are good,
that we should wait for a sage to
rule us, and we should assume
that he is well-intentioned," says
Huang. "So we have built struc
tures that concentrate power in
the hands of the ruler.
"In China a very bad system
arises out of an optimistic view,"
Huang continues. "In [the United
States] you have a very cynical
view, and, generally speaking, I
prefer this. I think it is a more
realistic view of human nature.
Everyone's wisdom is limited. You
cannot have an able man to lead
the whole country. It's just not

realistic to wait for a sage. . ..
What you need is a structure that
encourages even bad people to do
good things."
The long-term goal of pro
democracy movements in the
United States is a viable multi
party system and protection of
human rights within China.
Huang sees this as a shift from
investing power in leaders to in
vesting it in institutions that will
not be hamstrung by inept
leaders.
Waiting for reformers
One of the ironies of the de

mocracy movement abroad is that,
while it wants to break with the
Chinese tradition of waiting for
good men to come to power, at
this moment it is doing precisely
that.
Students hope reformers will
come to power in the upcoming
succession after China's aged lead
ership leaves the scene. They be
lieve that a reform-oriented
government, by condemning the
massacre, could regain the
legitimacy lost in the suppression
of the democracy movement.
To illustrate the Party's crisis
of legitimacy, the president of the
Independent Federation of Chi
nese Students and Scholars, Liu
Yongchuan, relates a current Chi
nese joke:
"For several days a single man
stood outside the Xinhuamen gate
to the Zhongnanhai compound
where China's highest leaders
live. Day and night he stood there
without leaving.
"After a little while the leaders
became upset and decided he had
to go. So Deng Xiaoping went out
side and ordered him to leave im
mediately. But the man still
stayed. Next, Li Peng went outside
and told him he had to go right
then. But the man still stayed.
Then Jiang Zemin, the new gen
eral secretary of the Party, went
outside and whispered one sen
tence to the man who then ran
away as fast as he could.
"When Jiang went back into the
Zhongnanhai, the other Party
leaders clustered around him,
eager to find out how he'd done

it. 'What was the sentence?' they
asked. Jiang said, 'I told him if
he didn't leave we'd make him
general secretary of the Party.' "
Condemning the massacre
Students in the United States
hope their efforts will encourage
moderates to use the memory of
the June 4 massacre in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square as a political
tool in high-level Party infighting.
"The new government will be a
better one," Huang hopes. "If it
is against the June 4 massacre —
maybe just for political reasons
— it is nevertheless easier to deal
with."
No one expects or desires a vi
olent change of power. Graduate
student Xu Sike says, "We have
to go through the peaceful way.
It is very important that we are
against violence and the use of
force."
Chinese students see their
struggle as one in which the rest
of the world has a clear stake.
According to Xu Guanghan, "If
China becomes more democratic,
it makes the world more stable.
Change in China is a good thing
for the whole world."
There is disagreement, however,
on how much influence the rest
cf the world can expect to wield
on internal disputes within the
Party. In a recently presented
paper, Stanford graduate student
Yu Bin argues that expectations
of having a great impact are un
realistic.
"The influence of the outside
world on China's internal devel
opment could be very trivial," he
writes, "given the fact that the
übiquitous factional politics are
relatively indifferent to influences
from both outside and below."

'In [the United States] you have a very
cynical view, and, generally speaking, I
prefer this. I think it is a more realistic
view of human nature.'

As they wait for new leadership
within China, students here are
trying to make the best of their
enforced stay in the United States.
They call the United States a
"great classroom" and say that,
while they wanted to learn de
mocracy at home, after the failure
of the movement, "this is the best
environment to practice."
Democratic dreams
Summing up the difference be
tween China and the United
States, one graduate student says,
"There, democracy is a dream, but
here it is a procedure." Chinese
students here are trying to bridge
the gap by becoming both demo
cratic idealists and skilled users
of Robert's Rules of parliamentary
procedure.
Zhou says he sees little chance
of any whole scale adoption of the
American model within China.
"There is no way you can copy
this system back to China." The
real importance of the democracy
movement is how it changes its
members, he says. "What is im
portant is that the values you
learn become part of yourself.
This is crucial over the long term
because institutions can always be
destroyed."
"What we are doing," says
Huang, "is trying to learn and
educate ourselves about democra
cy. We are trying to habitualize

it, internalize its norms, so that
it is natural to argue, to vote, to
bet up branches to oversee the
decisions made."
Chinese students are not
looking at the United States as
their only model. There is a great
deal of interest in Taiwan's
gradual transition from martial
law to a more open system.
Students also are following
recent events in Eastern Europe
closely for the insights they might
yield into non-violent change in
Communist systems. One student,
looking at recent reports from
East Germany, wistfully
remarked, "They have the same
environment we do, but such dif
ferent results."
Going home
In the long run, Huang would
like to see the Chinese students
who practice democracy in the
United States return to China
"when the time comes, under a
softer government that openly
says that it opposes the massacre.
This might be a time for these
people to come back and, starting
at the county level, try to institu
tionalize these procedures."
In the meantime, students in
the United States are turning en
thusiastically to competitive de
mocracy as a way of resolving
disputes. At meetings and on the
electronic mail system China Net

the most common complaint is
"This is not democratic."
China Net itself has often been
used for national 'balloting, as in
preparation for the founding con
gress of the International Feder
ation of Chinese Students and
Scholars in Chicago, putting the
Chinese students on the cutting
edge of democratic technology.
Students at the congress agreed,
after much debate, on a tripartite
structure loosely modeled on the
the American system, with an ex
ecutive, a board of directorate uni
versities and a supervisory
committee to ensure that the ac
tions of the other two branches
are consistent with the federa
tion's constitution.
Democracy in Chicago
Participants in the Chicago con
ference take pride in it as their
first experience of a totally dem
ocratic meeting run by Chinese
students. Dai Jiangang, a Stan
ford graduate student who was on
the steering committee of the con
ference, says the gathering was
as democratic as possible. "No one
could manipulate it, not even
[prominent Chinese exile] Wuer
Kaixi himself," he says.
Although the committee work
involved in passing the constitu
tion and the resolutions often
went until 2 or 3 a.m., Dai looks
back on those long days fondly.
"We all really enjoyed it — it was
just great. We thought if we
elected our government like this
they wouldn't be able to cheat
people and the situation in China
would be much better."
Stanford's Xu Sike put his com
mitment to democracy into action
when, at the Paris conference, he
and Berkeley's Yang Jianli chal

lenged Yan Jiaqi and Wuer Kaixi
for leadership of the newly
founded Front for Democracy in
China. "I think maybe Wuer Kaixi
thought I had no qualifications
and wondered why I was opposing
him," Xu says.
"But I told him that while be
was an activist in Tiananmen
Square and I was a student, our
situation in this conference was
the same. Anyone can run for this
position."
Many students look forward to
even more democracy. Graduate
student Xu Guanghan would like
to see more organizations. "Just
one is not perfect. Although they
should have some kind of col
laboration because they have
similar goals — to make China
more democratic — we should not
have one party to dominate every
thing," he says.
Although some press coverage
has anticipated divisive breaks in
the student movement as disagree
ments arise over goals and meth
ods, Huang says, "Rumors of
schisms are natural at this point.
Dissent is no longer a vice but a
virtue. What we need now is chan
nels to arbitrate the disputes that
arise."
Students in the United States
trace their own commitment to
democracy back to the willingness
of students in Tiananmen Square
to sacrifice their lives for an ideal
that remains unrealized in China.
All the organizations, all the
debates and all the conferences
share a common ancestry of con
viction and a determination to
realize the democratic dreams of
spring. In the words of Zhou
Xueguang, democracy is a dream
"built in people's hearts."
