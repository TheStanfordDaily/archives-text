Editor's note: This is the final
article in a foiir-part series on the
Chinese student movement at
Stanford. Several of those inter
viewed withheld their names
because of concerns for family
members remaining in China.

Stanford graduate student
Huang Jingsheng knows well
what the absence of democracy
means for China. In 1980, the
only time China allowed contested
elections for the National People's
Congress, he ran against the of
ficial Communist Party candi
date.

"Even though I lost, after the
election I was viewed as a political
troublemaker. Although I was at
the top of my class, the adminis
tration refused to give me my
degree. They wouldn't assign me
a job in the field I was interested
in,"he says.
Although his background of po
litical activism is atypical among
Chinese students at Stanford,
Huang's commitment to the dem
ocratic path of change in China
is shared by his colleagues.
Their experiences in the United
States and the failure of reform
in China are leading some Chinese
intellectuals here to rethink the
Chinese concept of authority.
For many Chinese students, life

in the United States provides con
crete evidence to back up their
democratic visions. "Since I have
lived in this country for such a
long time, I believe people have
the right to freedom of expression,
and the government has to listen
to them," says graduate student
"Lin Ming."
Soul-searching in the U.S.
David Ai, a project manager at
Hewlett-Packard who has worked
with Chinese students at Stan
ford, says, "By being here, and
by being able to see how free and
fair society here is, a lot of Chi
nese students have come through
a very deep soul-searching. They
have to ask themselves 'How did

the U.S. get here?' and 'What is
wrong with China?' The answers
affirm their commitment to true
democracy."

"Coming here," says graduate
student Zhou Xueguang, "we
realize there are other options
than what we have now. Before,
we were trying to help the gov
ernment to overcome its prob
lems, but now we realize the

government cannot do what we
want it to."
"Traditionally, in China we
have believed that men are good,
that we should wait for a sage to
rule us, and we should assume
that he is well-intentioned," says
Huang. "So we have built struc
tures that concentrate power in
the hands of the ruler.
"In China a very bad system
arises out of an optimistic view,"
Huang continues. "In [the United
States] you have a very cynical
view, and, generally speaking, I
prefer this. I think it is a more
realistic view of human nature.
Everyone's wisdom is limited. You
cannot have an able man to lead
the whole country. It's just not

realistic to wait for a sage. . ..
What you need is a structure that
encourages even bad people to do
good things."
The long-term goal of pro
democracy movements in the
United States is a viable multi
party system and protection of
human rights within China.
Huang sees this as a shift from
investing power in leaders to in
vesting it in institutions that will
not be hamstrung by inept
leaders.
Waiting for reformers
