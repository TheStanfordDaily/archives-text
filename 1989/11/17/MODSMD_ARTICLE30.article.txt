## Cardinal looks to salvage season, roast Golden Bears Stanford sees Big Game as 'beginning of new season' 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
According to the way Stanford
and California have been playing
lately, the red-hot Bears should
win Big Game. According to the
Las Vegas oddsmakers, the Car
dinal is a two-point favorite. Ac
cording to history, neither makes
a bit of difference.
It is often said that any given
team can win on any given Sat
urday, and that statement has
never been more true than in the
previous 91 meetings between
Stanford and Cal. While the over
all result has been fairly even —
Stanford has won 43, Cal 37 and
there have been 11 ties — the
individual games have usually
been very unpredictable.
From the Bears' upset of bowl
bound Stanford in 1986 to last
year's improbable 19-19 tie, the
game never seems to follow any
predictable script.
This year appears to be more
of the same as both teams have
been up and down. No one can
be sure which team will be more
up tomorrow.
It could be the Golden Bears,
winners of two straight, who will

be trying to win three consecutive
Pacific 10 Conference games for
the first time since 1975.
Or maybe it will be Stanford,
a team that has slowly improved
throughout the season, despite
being hit by a rash of injuries.
"Things are just starting and
here we are at the last game,"
said Andy Papathanassiou, who
will be starting his 45th and final
game for the Cardinal. "I wish
we could play 10 more. I bet we'd
do better than we did in the first
10."
Wins over Oregon and UCLA
have been the main highlights for
the Cardinal, 2-8 overall and 2-5
in the Pac-10. Cal, with upsets
over Arizona and Washington
State the past two weeks, is cur
rently 4-6, 2-5.
"It's probably the most impor
tant game in my life," Papat
hanassiou said. "A win would be
huge, all the way around. ... I
think the thing that is different
about this year is we see this as
a beginning."
First-year Cardinal Coach
Denny Green agreed. "We feel con
fident that this year will be a
springboard for us."
Green feels that, despite the

record, the program is going for
ward and will continue to improve
next year. "I'd like to play about
six more games," he said. "I per
sonally feel like we're just getting
going." He cites returning talent
and the possibility of another good
recruiting class as the main
reasons for his optimism.
"I think we can win a mcyor
battle in our recruiting season,"
he said. Stanford also will have
highly-touted running back Glyn
Milburn next year. He was forced
to redshirt this year after trans
ferring from Oklahoma.
"It's my impression that he's
going to have a major impact on
the program," Green said. "He's
going to have a impact on
the West Coast."
Like Stanford, Cal is also going
through a rebuilding process. "I
feel in the three years I've been
here we've improved in many
ways," Bear Coach Bruce Snyder
said. "I see it as a program headed
in the right direction."
But before those futures be
come reality, the two teams will
square off tomorrow. And the
reality then will be much different
from what the future may hold.
Cal will probably put most of
its eggs in the basket of senior
quarterback Troy Taylor, one of
the hottest signal-callers in the
nation. In the Golden Bears' last
two games, Taylor completed 68.8
percent of his passes for a total
of 740 yards and four touchdowns.
He will be facing a Stanford
defense in which five starters will
be playing their last collegiate con
test. Lester Archambeau, Rob
Hinckley, Bruce Lang, Alan Grant
and Rob Englehardt have been
key fixtures in the Stanford de
fense and will be instrumental in
stopping the Bear attack.
"We have not established the
fact that we can stop the pass on
a consistent basis," Green said.
"They're going to come out throw
ing. If we can stop the run, it will
make our job a lot easier. We want
to be able to shut down the run
and concentrate on the pass."
On the other side, the Stanford
offense will try to maintain the
consistency it has had the past
two weeks. Starting quarterback

The Cardinal defense will have to smother Cal's recently inspired offense if it hopes to walk away
with the Axe in the 92nd annual Big Game Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
