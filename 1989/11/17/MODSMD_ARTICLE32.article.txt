Stanford, ranked No. 1 in the
preseason poll, got off to great start in
the meet's first event, the 2,000-yard free.
Freshman Janet Evans handily won the
first intercollegiate race of her career in
Stanford's first race of the season.
Evans won by more than 42 seconds
in that race and came back to win the
800 individual medley and swim the sec
ond leg on the triumphant 800 freestyle
relay team.
"I was happy with the way I swam,"
Evans said. "I was hurting a little during
the relay, but I think everyone was hur
ting a little.
"Ever since I got to school here, I've
been excited to swim for Stanford, and
it was as exciting as I thought it was
(going to be)."
Before anyone had a chance to think

BERKELEY, Calif. — Starting this
season right where it left off last year,
the Stanford women's swim team opened
the 1989-90 campaign with many fine
performances yesterday.
The defending NCAA champions gave
little indication of weakness at the annual
double-distance meet at Spieker Pool here
yesterday. The meet gives both squads a
chance to get in some racing early in the
season, but there was no scoring and the
meet does not count on either team's
record. California, yesterday's opponent,
is currently ranked fifth nationally.
"I'm really pleased," Stanford Coach
Richard Quick said. "We have significant
time improvements over last year."

'Ever since I got to school here I've been excited to
swim for Stanford, and it was as exciting as I thought it
was (going to be).'

of Evans as the only Cardinal freshman
star, classmate Janel Jorgensen won the
second race of the day, the 400 freestyle.
Evans, Jorgensen and Lori Heisick, who
took second in the 400 breaststroke, were
happy to finally enter the pool wearing
a block S on their cap.
"I feel like I've been waiting and wan
ting to swim for Stanford for so many
years," Heisick said. "Now that the time
is here it's as exciting as I thought."

Jorgensen agreed. "It was a new expe
rience swimming for a new team," she
said. "That made it real exciting."
The performance of the freshmen did
not escape Quick's eye. "I'm real pleased
with them," he said. "They did a good
job. And the upperclassmen are ahead of
where they were last year."
The whole team did swim well as Stan
ford won five of seven races contested
yesterday. Other winners for Stanford

were sophmore Dede Trimble in the 400
backstroke and the team of Jorgensen,
Evans, Karen Kraemer and Michelle
Griglione in the 800 freestyle relay.
Griglione also took a second to Evans
in the 800 IM and Jorgensen was the
runner-up in the 400 butterfly.
"I think the team as a whole did
awesome today," Heisick said. "I was
watching the team in the pool, and I
couldn't believe I was swimming for the
team that won NCAAs last year."
Stanford will continue intense training
leading up to the team's regular season,
which begins in January. Stanford is con
sidered one of the favorites to win the
1990 NCAA title along with Texas.
"I think the team got off to a good
start," Jorgensen said. "It's good to see
our training paying off."
