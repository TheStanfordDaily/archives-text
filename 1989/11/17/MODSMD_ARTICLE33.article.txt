# Polo looks to drown Cal at de Guerre
## Weekend contest represents last opportunity for Cardinal to break top three 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
Stanford's water polo team wants to
win tomorrow — badly. The fact that
the Cardinal's opponent is California is
only half the reason.
The Big Splash," played at noon, pits
the No. 4 Cardinal against the No. 1
Bears in a game that is vital to Stan
ford's chances in next week's NCAA
tournament.
No. 2 UC-Irvine's loss to No. 5 Cal
State-Long Beach last week and Long
Beach's subsequent win over third
ranked Pepperdine has made this week
end especially important.
Though Pepperdine takes a higher
ranking into its match against Long
Beach, the Waves do not face an easy
victory over the 49ers, who are still
battling with UCLA for a spot in the
NCAA torunament.
What this means for Stanford, now
25-7 on the season, is that a top-three
ranking is more accessible than it has
been for weeks. Even if Pepperdine wins,
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
believes the victory over Cal alone could
get his team back into the top three.
"This is a very important game for
us," Dettamanti said. "If we beat Cal,
we'll be the only team to have beaten
the No. 1 team twice."
Being in the top three come tourna
ment time means that the Cardinal
would play an easier first-round match
than the one which it currently faces.
If stays at its No. 4 spot, it will probably
face either Long Beach or UCIJV, now

ranked fifth and sixth respectively. Plac
ing in the top three means playing either
No. 8 San Diego State or No. 12
Arkansas-Little Rock.
Getting to the top three also means
beating 24-2 California, a team that has
held the No. 1 spot for all but one week
of the season. Stanford has played the
Bears tough, however, winning 10-8 in
the opening matchup and then losing
back-to-back games, 7-6 and 10-8, Oct.
29 and Nov. 1.
"We just have to score goals against
those guys (Cal)," Dettamanti said.
"That's all there is to it."
Dettamanti's statement is not as silly
as it sounds. Stanford's goal-per-game
average is 10. Its only win against Cal
ifornia came when it scored 10, some
thing the team has had trouble doing
lately.
In Stanford's last two games, played

'If we beat Cal, we'll
be the only team to
have beaten the No. 1
team twice.'

against University of the Pacific and
UCLA, the Cardinal could manage only
five goals in each game. In comparison,
Stanford scored 24 total goals against
the same two teams during its 13-game
mid-season win streak.
On the defensive end, Stanford has
allowed only two teams to score 10 goals
in regulation. Both those games resulted
in losses.
Holding California to under 10 goals
and having his team score its average
are Dettamanti's objectives, but they
will not be easy to attain. Cal is good
on offense and defense.
"They really don't have any weak
nesses, " Dettamanti said. "They are
strong in all phases of the game."
Dettamanti maintains that the Bears
are beatable, as their offense tends to
overcommit, allowing for more counter
attacking against their defense.
Dettamanti also that his team
will have to shoot at least 60 percent
on its man-up opportunities. The games
against Cal this season have come down
to who does better on the six-on-fives.
"We don't have to play a perfect
game," Dettamanti said. "The key is
keeping their scoring down."
