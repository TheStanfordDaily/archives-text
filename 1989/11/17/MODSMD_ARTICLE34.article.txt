# Water Polo vs. California
## 
### 
TOMORROW — Noon at deGuerre Pool.
RECORDS - Stanford (25-7, 3-2 and
2nd in Pac-10 play), California (24-2,4-0
and Ist in Pac-10 play).
NOTES — This is Stanford's last chance
to regain a top-three ranking and an
easy first-round game in next week's
NCAA tournament. Stanford is 1-2
against Cal this year and a win tomor
row would mean that the Cardinal
would be the only team in the country
to have beaten the No 1 team twice.
This definitely would provide the justi
fication necessary to move up from the
No 4 spot
