The men's lacrosse team opens up its 1989-
90 campaign today with a Big Game of its
own against California at 3 p.m. at deGuerre
Field.
Because the lacrosse season takes place dur
ing winter and spring, this annual "Big Game"
has typically been slated as a pre-season contest
that doesn't mean much. However, the players
will tell you otherwise.
"This game really sets the tone for the rest
of the season," co-captain John Jibilian said.
"If we can beat Cal, we go into the season
with a positive attitude. If we lose, it just
means that we have to work that much
harder."
Last year, the Cardinal traveled to Bear
territory for the "Big Game" only to get
soundly beaten. It turned out to be a sour
beginning to a mediocre season. The team won
five and lost six, narrowly missing post-season
play.
This year's team, however, has a different
look. Having lost only three players to grad
uation, this year's team is a year older and a
year better.
"We've got a solid nucleus of veterans who
have been playing together for several years,
but we've also got some excellent freshman
talent which will really help to revitalize the
team," senior defensive leader Dave Grayzel
said.
While new players will add depth to the
squad, a new head coach will add to its cohesion
and strength. Jim McGuirre, an assistant last
year, took over the top job just last month
after former Coach Sam Sadtler opted to take
a job in Oregon.
"He has a great sense for the game and
should polish our already gutty play," senior
midfielder Bruce Elvin said.
Judging from the enthusiasm on the practice
field, the team looks like it has come a long
way since last year
"We're going to win some ball games this
year," Grayzel added. "Trust me on this one."
Grayzel's trustworthiness will be tested this
afternoon against Cal.
