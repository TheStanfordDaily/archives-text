# Men's basketball to host Nosso Club-Brazil
## 
### Howard Caro Staff writer 
As the football team gets ready to rock the dirty
Golden Bears at Big Game, the men's basketball
team will focus on the mamba and samba as the
Cardinal hosts the Nosso Club team from Brazil at
7:30 p.m. today.
The Nosso squad will make Stanford its sixth
venue on a barn storming tour of U.S. college cam
puses. Last night, the team conquered Fresno State
in a 49-48 battle.
Previously, the Brazilians captured a 79-70 victory
at UC-Riverside and a 50-49 thriller at Virginia
Commonwealth, were outplayed by Baylor in a 99-90
shootout and lost a classic in Overtime to UC-Irvine
by a final score of 87-84.
"We expect a tougher match up than in our first
game," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"They're a bunch of veterans. Some of them are
around 26, 27 or 28 years old. They are well-coached
and have good size all over the court."
Led by guard Carlos Romano, the Brazilians em
ploy a deliberate style of play while enjoying success
from behind the three-point stripe.
"These guys are tremendously well-organized,"
Montgomery said. "They play that slow, interna
tional game, but they're good from the outside.
Especially that guard Romano. He can really shoot
with great range."
Romano scored 30 points and grabbed 10 rebounds
against Irvine. In the Baylor effort, Romano put
29 points on the board, including six successful
three-point tries.
Defensively, Nosso plays a tough inside game and
an occasional zone defense.
"With all that size and experience, they're really
strong in the paint," Montgomery said. "We also
expect that they'll play a little bit of a match-up
zone defense against us."
Montgomery is just glad to give his team a chance
to face real competition again, after it soundly
defeated the amateur league's Brewster Heights
Packing team 109-87 in a Sunday exhibition game.
"It's just a chance to play against somebody else.
Not to put Brewster Heights down," Montgomery
said, "but these guys should be a truer test for us.
We'll get to try out some different combinations
and give more people time to play. It's always nice
to see some faces other than our own out on the
court.
"This game should really get us ready for the
game next weekend (against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo) and the rest of the season to come," he said.
