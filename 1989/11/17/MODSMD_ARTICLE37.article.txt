# Red-hot Cardinal looks to spike Huskies
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team is on a winning streak
right now.
The Cardinal has won three
in a row and is 8-3 since a three
match mid-season losing streak.
On Tuesday Stanford looked im
pressive while defeating No. 17
California in three games. Stan
ford may be playing its best vol
leyball of the season right now.

But the Cardinal's opponent
this weekend, the 13th-ranked
Washington Huskies, may also
b*» playing at its best when it
visits Burnham Pavilion for
tonight's match with Stanford.
The Huskies are 12-5 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, just a half
game behind second-place Stan
ford. Washington has won four
straight and 11 of 13 and has
compiled a 8-1 road record. The
only road loss for the Huskies
was at the hands of No. 2 UCLA.

Tonight's match will likely
decide the second-place Pac-10
finisher and the likely second
seed in the NCAA regional tour
nament. And although both
Stanford and Washington will
host first-round tournament
matches, Stanford Coach Don
Shaw appreciates that the two
teams may face each other in
later rounds.
"It really doesn't make much
difference," he said. "We're going
to be second or third seed at
this point and Washington will
be second or third. Regardless
of how (the NCAA) pairs up the
eight teams in the region, should
we both win our first round
games, we will most likely play
each other again like we did last
year."
Shaw can hardly forget last
year's regional matchup with
Washington. The Cardinal had
gone 27-2 in the 1988 regular
season, was ranked No. 2,
defeated USC in the first round
of regionals and was poised for
its seventh consecutive NCAA
Final Four appearance.
But the Huskies upset Stan
ford in five games and ruined
once again Stanford's drive for
the elusive national title .
Upsets like that are the reason
why Shaw likes late-season
matches against tough teams.
Every contest against a potential
opponent in the NCAA tourna
ment gives Stanford a chance to
evaluate the strengths and weak
nesses of the teams the Cardinal
should beat and those that Stan
ford would like to upset.
"You're going to have to beat
everybody to win (the NCAAs),
so you might as well play
eveybody ahead of time and not
have any surprises when the
playoffs roll around," Shaw said.
The Huskies, whom most ex
perts picked to finish in the
middle of the Pac-10, have won
consistently with solid team play.
Only one Washington player,
Melinda Beckenhauer, appears
in the top five of the official
conference individual statistical
categories. Beckenhauer, the
Huskies' setter, is third in ace
average and is fifth in assist

average.
Outside of Beckenhauer,
Washington wl.is on the strength
of its team work. Kelley Larsen
leads the team in hitting per
centage at .268 and Lisa McCam
mond has compiled a team-high
297 digs.
While the Huskies win with
team work, Stanford wins with
youth. Four freshmen have been
receiving ample playing time,
with middle blocker Bev Oden
and setter Carrie Feldman
leading the way.
Oden is hitting .375 on the
season, good for second in the
Pac-10, and has been on fire in
her last few matches, including
a .441 outing against California
on Tuesday.
Feldman has replaced injured
senior Lara Asper at setter and
has engineered the resurgence
of the Stanford attack.
"Considering how down we
were in the middle of the year
and adjusting to three freshmen
in the [startingl lineup ... I
think we're coming along,"
Shaw said. "I'm happy with the
way the team has progressed."
Stanford will close its Pac-10
schedule Sunday at noon when
Washington State visits the
Farm. The Cougars are tied for
last in the Pac-10 with Oregon
State. WSU's 8-25 overall record
is also the conference's worst.
Sunday's match will be Stan
ford's last regular-season home
match.

game behind second-place Stan
ford. Washington has won four
straight and 11 of 13 and has
compiled a 8-1 road record. The
only road loss for the Huskies
was at the hands of No. 2 UCLA.

Tonight's match will likely
decide the second-place Pac-10
finisher and the likely second
seed in the NCAA regional tour
nament. And although both
Stanford and Washington will
host first-round tournament
matches, Stanford Coach Don
Shaw appreciates that the two
teams may face each other in
later rounds.
"It really doesn't make much
difference," he said. "We're going
to be second or third seed at
this point and Washington will
be second or third. Regardless
of how (the NCAA) pairs up the
eight teams in the region, should
we both win our first round
games, we will most likely play
each other again like we did last
year."
Shaw can hardly forget last
year's regional matchup with
Washington. The Cardinal had
gone 27-2 in the 1988 regular
season, was ranked No. 2,
defeated USC in the first round
of regionals and was poised for
its seventh consecutive NCAA
Final Four appearance.
But the Huskies upset Stan
ford in five games and ruined
once again Stanford's drive for
the elusive national title .
Upsets like that are the reason
why Shaw likes late-season
matches against tough teams.
Every contest against a potential
opponent in the NCAA tourna
ment gives Stanford a chance to
evaluate the strengths and weak
nesses of the teams the Cardinal
should beat and those that Stan
ford would like to upset.
"You're going to have to beat
everybody to win (the NCAAs),
so you might as well play
eveybody ahead of time and not
have any surprises when the
playoffs roll around," Shaw said.
The Huskies, whom most ex
perts picked to finish in the
middle of the Pac-10, have won
consistently with solid team play.
Only one Washington player,
Melinda Beckenhauer, appears
in the top five of the official
conference individual statistical
categories. Beckenhauer, the
Huskies' setter, is third in ace
average and is fifth in assist

average.
Outside of Beckenhauer,
Washington wl.is on the strength
of its team work. Kelley Larsen
leads the team in hitting per
centage at .268 and Lisa McCam
mond has compiled a team-high
297 digs.
While the Huskies win with
team work, Stanford wins with
youth. Four freshmen have been
receiving ample playing time,
with middle blocker Bev Oden
and setter Carrie Feldman
leading the way.
Oden is hitting .375 on the
season, good for second in the
Pac-10, and has been on fire in
her last few matches, including
a .441 outing against California
on Tuesday.
Feldman has replaced injured
senior Lara Asper at setter and
has engineered the resurgence
of the Stanford attack.
"Considering how down we
were in the middle of the year
and adjusting to three freshmen
in the [startingl lineup ... I
think we're coming along,"
Shaw said. "I'm happy with the
way the team has progressed."
Stanford will close its Pac-10
schedule Sunday at noon when
Washington State visits the
Farm. The Cougars are tied for
last in the Pac-10 with Oregon
State. WSU's 8-25 overall record
is also the conference's worst.
Sunday's match will be Stan
ford's last regular-season home
match.
