In comparison to other Big
Game events this week, yester
day's men's swimming meet
against California merited little
more than a ripple of attention.
The double distance meet,
usually held in the preseason to
break up the boring routine of
training, did not count in the
teams' dual meet records, and nei
ther team appeared to approach
the meet with much intensity.
After Cal recorded a 31-30 victory
on the scoreboard, the Stanford
squad was back in the water train

"Since none of the races are

a really intense meet," Asst. Coach
Jay Mortenson, a three-time

the long events.
"Alex Kostich had the best
swim of the day," Morten son said.
Kostich, a sophomore, swam
away from the field in the 800
individual medley with a new
meet best of 8:27.85. Kostich left
the next closest swimmer, Golden
Bear John Harlow, nearly 10
seconds behind him and wiped out
former Cardinal Matt Nance's
1987 record of 8:29.43.
Sophomore Jason Plummer also
recorded an impressive long
distance swim. In the 400 butter
fly, Plummer swam ahead of the
pack by five seconds and finished
in 3:57.41. This time shattered
the meet record of 4:06.63.
The Golden Bears, as relaxed
as Stanford on the other side of
the pool, picked up a little inten
sity in the 800 free relay, the final
event of the afternoon, in order
to jump into the lead in team
scoring. Going into the relay, the
