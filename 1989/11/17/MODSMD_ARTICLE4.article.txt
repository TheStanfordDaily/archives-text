# Nigerian author, critic debunks Eurocentrism
## 
### Kaoul Mowatt Staff writer 
Nigerian author and critic Chin
weizu last night called for a fun
damental restructuring of
scholarship to reflect an increas
ingly pluralistic world society.
Speaking in Terinan Auditori
um, Chinweizu said that as eco
nomic and political power
becomes decentralized, Europeans
will have to recognize the works
of people from other cultures.
As a result of Europe's early
adoption of an industrial base,
many scholars viewed Europe as
the fount of culture, Chinweizu
said. Some European critics would
accept works from other cultures
that appealed to European sen
sibilities, he added.
Since World War 11, however,
the balance of power has shifted
away from Europe, Chinweizu
said. Though the United States
and the Soviet Union have been
influenced by European concepts,
both incorporate many character
istics of other cultures as well, he
said.
In recent years, Asia has as
sumed a greater role in the world
community, necessitating a closer
evaluation of Asian culture, he
added.
Not even the formation of a
common European community,
which is planned for 1992, will
prevent the development of mul

ticulturalism, he said. A united
Europe will only be one of several
economic and political superpow
ers, he explained.
"There is no point in continuing
with the pretense that the Euro
pean standpoint is the correct
one," he said. "History has no
chosen people."
With the decline of Europe,
scholars must abandon the
idealization of European culture
that resulted from the continent's
former economic and political
predominance, Chinweizu said.
Instead of believing in Europe's
"uncontested superiority," schol
ars must recognize other cultures
on their own merits, Chinweizu
said. The humanities should be
expanded to include works from
all groups, he said.
Intellectuals must also work to
debunk views of history that only
discuss other cultures in terms of
their interactions with European
countries, he said.
European institutions such as
the Nobel Prize and the Olympic
Games should also broaden their
horizons or relinquish their claims
to universality, Chinweizu said.
Chinweizu's speech launched a
series of seminars celebrating the
20th anniversary of the African
and Afro-American Studies De
partment. He will also attend a
small discussion session at Har
mony House at 3:30 p.m. today.
