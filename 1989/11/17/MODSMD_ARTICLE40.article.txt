# The 						Irish they're not
## Wrestlers dominate College of Notre Dame 
### Jim Smith 
In an early season warmup, the
Stanford wrestling team clob
bered the College of Notre Dame
60-0. Notre Dame, in its initial
year, was expected to field a larger
team but was only able to send
two wrestlers to the mat. Stanford
filled the rest of the weight classes
with challenge matches to deter
mine this year's varsity lineup.
In the two matches that did
take place, 167-pound Mark
Graham and 177-pound Steve
Buddie both destroyed their op
ponents in spectacular fashion.
Graham was relentless in an 18-2
technical fall over Jeff Sharrow
while Buddie pinned Nolan Hee
in the first period.
Buddie is ranked 10th nation

ally this year.
"We did not expect Notre Dame
to be a close match," Coach Chris
Horpel said. "This match was just
to settle the starting lineup and
get a few guys to wrestle someone
other than their teammates."
Also impressive were freshman
Lance Johnson (134 pounds) and
sophomore Matt Topham (158
pounds), who both won to secure
varsity spots. Senior Geoff Baum
(150 pounds) turned in an in
spired performance, continuing to
wrestle despite severely spraining
his ankle early in the first period.
Dave Nowick (126 pounds),
James Dinette (142 pounds), and
Ron Perry (190 pounds) were also
hampered by minor injuries but
do not expect to be sidelined for
long.
