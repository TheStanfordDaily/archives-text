# Fencers begin season against Golden Bears
## 
### Andrew Wilcox Staff writer 
Although tomorrow's Big Game
will draw most of the attention
this weekend, the Stanford fenc
ing team will stage its own at
tempt to upend California in the
Cardinal's opening match of the
season today at Roble Gym at 4
p.m.
The men's and women's fencers
competed in the Stanford Col
legiate Open, a preseason individ
ual event, last weekend, and today
each squad will commence the reg
ular NCAA season. Both the men
and women will be trying to
defend their respective NCAA
West Region titles this year.

The women's squad, coached by
Sherry Posthumus, is led by
freshman phenom Lana Kang,
who captured first-place honors
in the foil division of last week
end's tournament and will be a
valuable addition to the squad.
Despite losing two-thirds of last
season's team, the men's fencers
also appear strong. Coach Zoran
Tulum will be without one of his
top fencers today, as sophomore
foilist Nick Bravin is competing
in a national tournament in
Detroit.
Sophomore Leonard D'Amico,
who finished first in the sabre in
last weekend's meet, should out
class any California opponent he
faces today.
