weeks and the pack has gained
ground. Only one game back, for
example, is the Guest Greek,
represented this week by fresh
man Janet Evans.
Evans, who began her Stan
ford swimming career in a meet
against California yesterday,
thinks being selected as the
Guest Greek ranks right up
there with, um . . . winning
three gold medals?
Well, maybe not that high, but
it's up there with meeting the
President at the White House,
isn't it?
Almost. How about eating

chicken chalupa at food service?
It's at least that good.
Actually Evans was quite
thrilled at the opportunity to
share her pigskin prognostica
tion powers with the public.
"I'm honored to be the Guest
Greek for Big Game," she said,
"especially because I'm only a
freshman."
Despite being new to the
scene, she has already learned
to express a great deal of confi
dence in the Cardinal gridders.
When asked why Stanford would
win the night before her season
opening meet, she explained,

"We just will because we're bet
ter. And because we're going to
beat them in swimming."
Also in the pack of wolves
chasing Rogowsky are Nat
Cousins and Chris Crader.
Crader vaulted himself back into
some semblence of contention by
going 9-1 two weeks ago but both
he and Cousins were 4-6 last
week to fall behind the Guest.
From those of us atop Mount
Olypmus to those of you with
problem sets due Monday, we
give our final regards for the
year.

This is it. The time you'ye all
been waiting for.
Yes, after today, there will be
no more Greeking around until
next year. Before we go off and
hibernate, however, we have this
little matter of the standings to
conclude. In one of the closest
races in recorded history, four
different Greeks have a shot at
the title, led by Mark Rogowsky.
Rogowsky has grown accus
tomed to the top spot, but he
has slipped a little the last two

weeks and the pack has gained
ground. Only one game back, for
example, is the Guest Greek,
represented this week by fresh
man Janet Evans.
Evans, who began her Stan
ford swimming career in a meet
against California yesterday,
thinks being selected as the
Guest Greek ranks right up
there with, um . . . winning
three gold medals?
Well, maybe not that high, but
it's up there with meeting the
President at the White House,
isn't it?
Almost. How about eating

chicken chalupa at food service?
It's at least that good.
Actually Evans was quite
thrilled at the opportunity to
share her pigskin prognostica
tion powers with the public.
"I'm honored to be the Guest
Greek for Big Game," she said,
"especially because I'm only a
freshman."
Despite being new to the
scene, she has already learned
to express a great deal of confi
dence in the Cardinal gridders.
When asked why Stanford would
win the night before her season
opening meet, she explained,

"We just will because we're bet
ter. And because we're going to
beat them in swimming."
Also in the pack of wolves
chasing Rogowsky are Nat
Cousins and Chris Crader.
Crader vaulted himself back into
some semblence of contention by
going 9-1 two weeks ago but both
he and Cousins were 4-6 last
week to fall behind the Guest.
From those of us atop Mount
Olypmus to those of you with
problem sets due Monday, we
give our final regards for the
year.

This is it. The time you'ye all
been waiting for.
Yes, after today, there will be
no more Greeking around until
next year. Before we go off and
hibernate, however, we have this
little matter of the standings to
conclude. In one of the closest
races in recorded history, four
different Greeks have a shot at
the title, led by Mark Rogowsky.
Rogowsky has grown accus
tomed to the top spot, but he
has slipped a little the last two
