# Labor camp veteran:
## Soviet citizens lack faith in reform efforts 
### Kim Kochaver 
A veteran of Soviet labor
camps said last night that
many Soviet citizens lack faith
in their government's efforts to
implement humanitarian and
political reforms.
Sponsored by the Stanford
chapter of Amnesty Interna
tional, an organization which
fights for the release of political
prisoners around the world, Al
exander Ogorodnikov spoke to
a group of about 40 people at
Bechtel International Center
about his experience in the
labor camps.
He was sentenced in 1979 to
one year in a labor camp for
"anti-Soviet agitation and
propaganda," but his incarcera
tion was extended until 1987
when the Soviet government,
under pressure from various
human rights organizations, fi
nally granted him freedom.
The "totalitarian" regime in
place today has "perverted all
human values" in its aim to
"crush the human individual
under the social collective," he
said. Opponents of the sys
tem are persecuted to this day
in prisons and psychiatric

wards and are assisted only by
the concerted efforts of organ
izations on their behalf, he
said.
He praised the work of such
groups and likened their influ
ence on prisoners to "a hand
through barbed wire which we
feel in the hardest moments of
our imprisonment," he said.
It is hard for the Westerner
who is accustomed to living in
freedom to imagine the bar
baric environment of the labor
camps in the Soviet Union, he
said. The complete isolation of
the camps is witnessed by the
fact that "appeals and com
plaints are heard only by the
four walls around you," he
said.
He maintained that the So
viet people, especially the
young intelligentsia, have be
come disillusioned with the
Communist ideology and have
begun to seek alternatives in
other political systems, such as
the Christian Democratic Un
ion, which Ogordnikov founded
in 1989.
True change will occur, he
claimed, only when totalitari
anism is overthrown through
free and democratic elections.
