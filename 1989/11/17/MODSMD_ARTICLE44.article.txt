# Med student seeks marrow for his mentor
## 
### Doug Fine Staff writer 
A Stanford medical student is
leading a one-man crusade aimed
at saving the life of his favorite
professor.
Dartmouth Biology Prof. Chris
topher Reed has approximately
four months to live if he does not
receive a bone marrow transplant,
according to Manuel Amieva,
Reed's former student who is now
a second-year medical student.
Reed's particular form of cancer
is terminal without treatment, ac
cording to Amieva. Even after a
donor is found, Reed's chances for
survival are estimated to be 70
percent.
As an undergraduate at
Dartmouth, Amieva became

friends with Reed when Reed was
his thesis advisor. Reed, who
Amieva described as "an interest
ing and great man," recently pub
lished an article on education in
the journal Bio Science.
Concerned about Reed's illness,
Amieva said he plans to distribute
a letter to all Stanford medical
students, urging them to have
their bone marrow typed in hopes
of finding a match for Reed's mar
row type.
About 13 people connected with
Stanford Hospital are in need of
the same procedure for which
Reed is waiting, Amieva said.
In addition to helping save the
life of his favorite professor,
Amieva said he hopes his work
will make the Stanford commu
nity more aware of the need for

bone marrow donors.
Although testing for bone mar
row type is a similar procedure
to giving blood, donating bone
marrow requires an overnight
stay in a hospital and anesthesia.
Bone marrow types are much
more difficult to match than or
dinary blood transfusions because
12 types of bone marrow exist, as
opposed to the three main types
of blood.
The chances of any two people
matching marrow types are ap
proximately one in 20,000, de
pending on how rare the bone
marrow type is. Often familial
transfusions offer the best hope
for correct matching.
Bone marrow transplants are
relatively new in treating types of
cancer such as the one from which

Reed is suffering. In the proce
dure, doctors replace the can
cerous marrow with the donor's,
hopefully removing any diseased
cells.
Reed already has received a
modified form of this procedure,
in which his own marrow was
used in the transfusion, without
success, according to Amieva.
Amieva's work will be facilitated
by the Stanford University Blood
Bank, which is part of a nation
wide computer network that
matches the names and bone mar
row types of potential recipients
with donors.
Amieva said he expects to be in
contact with Reed's physician and
relay Reed's bone marrow type to
the Stanford Blood Bank this
week, since time is crucial.
