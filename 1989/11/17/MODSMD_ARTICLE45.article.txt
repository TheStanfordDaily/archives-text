The latest attempt at glasnost
hit University Food Services yes
terday as management held a
meeting with students and
nutrition experts to demystify the
workings of Food Services and to
suggest ways to improve that next
meal that hits your plate.
"In contrast to some other uni
versities which have a manage
ment company running food
service, here it is owned and run
entirely by Stanford," explained
Lois Ohms, assistant manager of
food services. "We try to operate

on a break-even point," she added.
Jim Keeton, manager of food
services, stressed the role of the
food service committees, com
prised of representatives from
each dorm, in providing student
input to the management.
In addition, Keeton said he an
ticipates working with the stu
dents nominated by the ASSU to
the Committee on University
Food Services on a survey during
winter quarter to improve menus
and service. The group also plans
to explore implementing an & la
carte system such as the one used
in Sterling Quad for other student

residences.
Food Service, along with Bon
Appetit and Tresidder Union
management are working on the
"zillion things to be sorted out,"
like sales tax, before meal cards
can be used for purchasing meals
at Tresidder, said Keeton.
But, Keeton added, he is hope
ful that a pilot project will take
place as early as spring this year.
Students will be able to choose,
for example, a 10- or 14-meal plan
and use a separate account on
their existing meal card to eat at
Tresidder, he explained. Students
will be billed for these alternate

accounts beforehand, but details
are still to be worked out, he
added.
Laura Brainin-Rodriguez and
Alice Bender of Cowell's Nutrition
Advisory Committee, along with
members of the Stanford women's
gymnastics team and a student in
the SWOPSI class "Body-Image
and Eating Issues" attended the
meeting.
They discussed specific menus,
ways of providing nutrition infor
mation with each entree and came
up with a variety of menu sug
gestions such as frozen yogurt.
