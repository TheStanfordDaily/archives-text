# Doctor urges animal research
## 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
When Elizabeth Dement showed
rapid eye movement during her
coma after a serious auto accident,
Dr. William Dement fervently
hoped his daughter's neuro circuit
was still intact.
However, controversies involv
ing the use of animals in brain
research have made the study of
conditions similar to his
daughter's "exceedingly difficult,"
said Dement, director of the Stan
ford Sleep Disorders Research
Center.
Dement, in a talk yesterday at
Fairchild Auditorium, used his
daughter's experience to justify
the importance of using both ro
dents and primates in brain injury
research.
Hit by a car while chasing a
dog on Feb. 20, 1987, Dement's
daughter suffered from lesions in
the brain stem, among other com
plications. Her parents were told
at the time that survival was un
likely.
Watching the various monitors
and apparatuses strapped to his
daughter, Dement and his wife
"had the terror of wondering if
the treatment was correct." The
"tremendous mystery surround
ing head injury and coma" led
Dement to fight for use of animals
in brain research, which will help
patients like his daughter.
During the course of his
daughter's treatment, Dement
recognized that the answers to
many pertinent questions are still
unknown, he said. One of them
is whether stimulation of a coma
victim will make a difference in
a patient's recovery.

"We spent 24 hours a day doing
that — talking to her, keeping
the radio on . . . but we didn't
know if that would help," he said.
Elizabeth Dement received high
doses of anti-convulsants but no
hypnotics, because physicians
thought they might hinder the
recovery of her brain. Dement said
it was not known which drugs
could be applied safely, and there
is an "enormous mythology" in
this area.
"There is no real knowledge of
long-term recovery in the plas
ticity of the brain," he added.
Dement's daughter has partially
recovered, but the recovery was
extremely slow and painful, as De
ment documented during the pre
sentation with slides of his
daughter. One showed her arm in
a spastic position, and another
showed her screaming with pain,
unable to lift her head. It took
her a whole year to recover
mobility in her left land. "She
touched my finger like E.T.," De
ment said.
At present, Dement's daughter
is able to stand and speak, but
her chances of survival hang on
the thread of future research, par
ticularly on primates.
Dement described one current
study that aims to develop a safe
and effective medication that will
block lipid peroxidation and stop
progressive damage to the ner
vous system after injury.
There once were many animal
models being studied, according
to Dement. Since 1984, however,
head injury research using large
animals such as primates has
ceased to exist in the United
States. "Maybe three years were
lost in the course of all this,"

Dement said.
Animal trials should be allowed
to proceed quickly so researchers
can move on to human trials, De
ment added. Individuals who
would normally die will then be
saved and those who have mild
injuries will get excellent treat
ment, he added.
Dement said he feels his
daughter is a victim of the animal
rights movement. During the pre
vious decade, had research been
carried on at a faster pace, the
outcome might have been differ
ent, he added.
Dement explained that some
biomedical reactions occur right
after head injury and may go on
for months. Also, prolonged coma
treatment may lead to permanent
brain damage.
Therefore, Dement said, "There
is a just and desperate need for
a rational and workable national
policy on animal research." How
ever, he also recognizes the "dif
ficulty to achieve a consensus
from both sides," referring to an
imal rights activists and animal
research supporters.
Asked why he failed to mention
clinical observation as a way to
learning more about head trauma,
Dement cited the constraints the
medical-legal agenda is placing on
physicians: "Physicians these
days are not taking chances. . . .
There is a lot of frustration. . . .
We don't think we will learn what
is necessary from following
patients."
Dement's talk is the first of se
ries titled "The Importance of
Animals in Scientific Investiga
tion" sponsored by the Depart
ment of Laboratory Animal
Medicine at Stanford.

When Elizabeth Dement showed
rapid eye movement during her
coma after a serious auto accident,
Dr. William Dement fervently
hoped his daughter's neuro circuit
was still intact.
However, controversies involv
ing the use of animals in brain
research have made the study of
conditions similar to his
daughter's "exceedingly difficult,"
said Dement, director of the Stan
ford Sleep Disorders Research
Center.
Dement, in a talk yesterday at
Fairchild Auditorium, used his
daughter's experience to justify
the importance of using both ro
dents and primates in brain injury
research.
Hit by a car while chasing a
dog on Feb. 20, 1987, Dement's
daughter suffered from lesions in
the brain stem, among other com
plications. Her parents were told
at the time that survival was un
likely.
Watching the various monitors
and apparatuses strapped to his
daughter, Dement and his wife
"had the terror of wondering if
the treatment was correct." The
"tremendous mystery surround
ing head injury and coma" led
Dement to fight for use of animals
in brain research, which will help
patients like his daughter.
During the course of his
daughter's treatment, Dement
recognized that the answers to
many pertinent questions are still
unknown, he said. One of them
is whether stimulation of a coma
victim will make a difference in
a patient's recovery.

"We spent 24 hours a day doing
that — talking to her, keeping
the radio on . . . but we didn't
know if that would help," he said.
Elizabeth Dement received high
doses of anti-convulsants but no
hypnotics, because physicians
thought they might hinder the
recovery of her brain. Dement said
it was not known which drugs
could be applied safely, and there
is an "enormous mythology" in
this area.
"There is no real knowledge of
long-term recovery in the plas
ticity of the brain," he added.
Dement's daughter has partially
recovered, but the recovery was
extremely slow and painful, as De
ment documented during the pre
sentation with slides of his
daughter. One showed her arm in
a spastic position, and another
showed her screaming with pain,
unable to lift her head. It took
her a whole year to recover
mobility in her left land. "She
touched my finger like E.T.," De
ment said.
At present, Dement's daughter
is able to stand and speak, but
her chances of survival hang on
the thread of future research, par
ticularly on primates.
Dement described one current
study that aims to develop a safe
and effective medication that will
block lipid peroxidation and stop
progressive damage to the ner
vous system after injury.
There once were many animal
models being studied, according
to Dement. Since 1984, however,
head injury research using large
animals such as primates has
ceased to exist in the United
States. "Maybe three years were
lost in the course of all this,"

Dement said.
Animal trials should be allowed
to proceed quickly so researchers
can move on to human trials, De
ment added. Individuals who
would normally die will then be
saved and those who have mild
injuries will get excellent treat
ment, he added.
Dement said he feels his
daughter is a victim of the animal
rights movement. During the pre
vious decade, had research been
carried on at a faster pace, the
outcome might have been differ
ent, he added.
Dement explained that some
biomedical reactions occur right
after head injury and may go on
for months. Also, prolonged coma
treatment may lead to permanent
brain damage.
Therefore, Dement said, "There
is a just and desperate need for
a rational and workable national
policy on animal research." How
ever, he also recognizes the "dif
ficulty to achieve a consensus
from both sides," referring to an
imal rights activists and animal
research supporters.
Asked why he failed to mention
clinical observation as a way to
learning more about head trauma,
Dement cited the constraints the
medical-legal agenda is placing on
physicians: "Physicians these
days are not taking chances. . . .
There is a lot of frustration. . . .
We don't think we will learn what
is necessary from following
patients."
Dement's talk is the first of se
ries titled "The Importance of
Animals in Scientific Investiga
tion" sponsored by the Depart
ment of Laboratory Animal
Medicine at Stanford.
