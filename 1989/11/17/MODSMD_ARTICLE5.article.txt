## More law students shunning corporate world 
### Lesley Barnes 
Susan Mizner, a second-year
law student, says she has "no in
terest whatsoever" in doing any
thing other than public-interest
law when she graduates, provided
she can handle it financially.
That's a big provision: Mizner
will graduate with a loan debt of
$50,000, and the average public
interest job pays $23,000 a year.
Mizner is one of a small but
apparently growing number of law
students who plan, upon gradua
tion, to shun the financial
rewards and prestige of private
law firms. Instead, these students
are opting for public-interest law,
which they consider more reward
ing, hands-on work.
Public-interest law opportuni
ties are numerous, ranging from
work in the area of union-side
labor law to contributions to firms
handling public-interest cases.
For its part, the Stanford Law
School is making subtle but sig
nificant efforts to encourage this
trend, and the preliminary results
are encouraging. Early figures
show that three times as many
graduates from the class of 1989
took public-interest jobs as in past
years.
The increase in student interest
was evident at a recent open house
about summer jobs in public
interest programs. Tom Boasberg
and Liz Butler, second-year stu
dents who were there to answer
questions, said they were pleased
and encouraged with the large

turnout, especially of second- and
third-year students who came to
share their experiences.
Statistics from the class of
1988, however, show there is still
much room for improvement. Of
161 graduates, 64 percent took
jobs with law firms, for a median
salary of $60,000. Only one per
cent — two people — went to work
for a public-interest agency. The
rest chose judicial clerkships, fi
nancial institutions, government
or education research, or were un
decided.
Seven students from the class
of 1989 have reported taking
public-interest jobs, although the
complete annual survey has not
yet been officially conducted.
According to Butler, money
plays a large role in deciding what
kind of law career to pursue. "So
many of my friends say, 'If it
wasn't for the money, I would go
into public interest now,
forever,' " she said.
But there is more to the equa
tion than the financial inequity,
according to Jeanne Vatterott, the
public-interest programs coordi
nator in the Law School's office
of career services. Vatterott said
that private law firms make it
easy for students because they can
project their hiring and expansion
needs a year in advance.
Each fall, representatives from
500 firms come to Stanford to
impress and entice third-year stu
dents. Public-interest groups, on
uates went into public-interest
law.
Stanford's track record may
even be a bit worse, according to
Vatterott. She said this is largely
due to Stanford being an expen
sive private institution which
leaves many graduates with large
debts. Another factor, she said, is
the attractiveness of Stanford stu
dents, as graduates of one of the
country's best law schools, to a
large number of heavily courting
firms.
In order to counter this trend,
Stanford has played an increas
ingly larger role in encouraging
students to consider public
interest work. "It seems to me
that the administration has made
a real effort to get more students
to go into public-interest work
through admissions policies and
institutional changes," Mizner
said.
Stanford now offers both per
manent financial incentives and
University grants for summer
jobs. The Public Interest Low In
come Protection Plan is a loan
forgiveness program through
which the Law School lends money
to graduates working in the
public-interest or public-service
field. Graduates use the money
to pay off a portion of their reg
ular educational loan debts. After
three years of work in this area,
they become eligible for cancella
tion of part or all of the loans.

the other hand, operate on tight
budgets and don't know their
hiring needs that far in advance,
she said.
Working for a big firm is the
path of least resistance, explained
Boasberg. "It's either the big
firms come to you, or you bust
your ass to go out and find some
thing and pay your own way to
interviews."
This problem is not limited to
Stanford. At Harvard, concern
over the low number of graduates
enteri-ng public-interest law
prompted Walter Annenberg,
former publisher of TV Guide, to
donate a $1 million endowment
to support public service fellow
ships.
The gift was made after Har
vard closed the school's public
interest career planning and
placement office, a model for such
offices around the country.
Harvard's decision caused an
uproar among many students, fac
ulty and alumni who felt that
graduates need to be encouraged
to go into public-interest law. A
recent study by the Washington
based National Association for
Law Placement, Inc., showed that
even recently only slightly over 3
percent of 32,585 law school grad-

'We're not saying public-interest work is
for everyone. We try to get individuals
to realize what's important to them,
what gives them satisfaction.'

Students may also apply for
grants from the Stanford Public
Interest Law Foundation, which
awards money to students who
spend the summer doing public
service work.
The University is also exploring
ways to reach students in the
classroom. Although courses on
public-interest law already exist,
a new curriculum, called "Lawyer
ing for Social Change," is cur
rently being developed, according
to Vatterott. The program will
consist of a series of integrated
courses designed to build on each
other, which will deviate from
Stanford's "generalist program,"
she explained.
Part of the new curriculum was
informally initiated last spring,
when an introductory class titled
"Lawyering Process" offered a
more specific section, "Lawyering
Process for Social Change."
Mizner, Boasberg and Butler all
took this experimental class. "Just
from that one class, I've seen a

tremendous increase in student
involvement," Mizner said. "They
had wanted to do it but didn't
know how." The class helped stu
dents find a way to pursue public
interest work, she said.
Law Prof. Michael Wald, who is
creating the new course program,
said, "The genesis of the new cur
riculum is not necessarily for
public interest but to better train
students."
The faculty's concern, he added,
is to develop "courses that are
the best preparation intellectually
for whatever the students want
to do."
Vatterott said the role of her
office is to serve as a disseminator
of information. "We try to present
as much information as we can
to the students, to let them know
what the intangible rewards of
public-interest work are," she
said.
"We're not saying public
interest work is for everyone. We
try to get individuals to realize

what's important to them, what
gives them satisfaction. We try to
counterbalance all the attention
they get from private law firms."
Vatterott's position was created
four years ago, she said, in order
to provide a person clearly iden
tified as a public-interest coun
selor. She said her office reaches
out to students by publishing a
handbook on public-interest op
portunities and inviting employ
ers to speak to students on
campus. As of April 1989, only 10
law schools nationwide offered
this service, while three others
tried to disseminate information
using student coordinators.
According to law students, Stan
ford's effort is appreciated. Ac
cording to Mizner, law students
need this encouragement because
"the roads just aren't as well
paved to public interest."
Added Boasberg: "For most
people [who choose public interest
law], it's really not a moral choice.
They just want challenging and
eryoyable work."
Boasberg said he split his time
last summer between a large San
Francisco firm and the Washing
ton Lawyers Committee for Civil
Rights. He earned $1,000 a week
in San Francisco and wasn't paid
at all in Washington. He said the
$6,000 he made in the first six
weeks carried him through the
summer.
"At the Lawyers Committee, I

eryoyed the fact that I was work
ing toward an end I cared about.
These are the issues I'm inter
ested in and would seek out on
my own," he said. "The issues I
worked on at the law firm were
left behind at the office when I
left each night."
Boasberg said the distinction
also has to do with responsibility.
Public-interest organizations
don't have the resources to train,
he said, so a new worker experi
ences "baptism by fire" and is
exposed to all aspects of the work.
At a big firm, by contrast, "you're
at the bottom of the totem pole,"
he said. "You do all the research,"
and the senior people write the
briefs and go to court.
"If I could get a public-interest
job of the quality of the Lawyers
Committee [after graduation], I
would take it, absolutely," he said.
Mizner said she spent last sum
mer working pro bono for a law
office that handles immigration
issues for the National Lawyers
Guild. She was assigned to an
asylum case for a Salvadorean
man who had escaped to the U.S.
after death squads in El Salvador
persecuted his family.
"I could actually meet with the
client and we could talk about the
best way to approach his case,"
Mizner said. "This kind of expe
rience is more rewarding because
you feel like you've made a dif
ference for someone."
