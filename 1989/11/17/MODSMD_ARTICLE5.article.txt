## More law students shunning corporate world 
### Lesley Barnes 
Susan Mizner, a second-year
law student, says she has "no in
terest whatsoever" in doing any
thing other than public-interest
law when she graduates, provided
she can handle it financially.
That's a big provision: Mizner
will graduate with a loan debt of
$50,000, and the average public
interest job pays $23,000 a year.
Mizner is one of a small but
apparently growing number of law
students who plan, upon gradua
tion, to shun the financial
rewards and prestige of private
law firms. Instead, these students
are opting for public-interest law,
which they consider more reward
ing, hands-on work.
Public-interest law opportuni
ties are numerous, ranging from
work in the area of union-side
labor law to contributions to firms
handling public-interest cases.
For its part, the Stanford Law
School is making subtle but sig
nificant efforts to encourage this
trend, and the preliminary results
are encouraging. Early figures
show that three times as many
graduates from the class of 1989
took public-interest jobs as in past
years.
The increase in student interest
was evident at a recent open house
about summer jobs in public
interest programs. Tom Boasberg
and Liz Butler, second-year stu
dents who were there to answer
questions, said they were pleased
and encouraged with the large

turnout, especially of second- and
third-year students who came to
share their experiences.
Statistics from the class of
1988, however, show there is still
much room for improvement. Of
161 graduates, 64 percent took
jobs with law firms, for a median
salary of $60,000. Only one per
cent — two people — went to work
for a public-interest agency. The
rest chose judicial clerkships, fi
nancial institutions, government
or education research, or were un
decided.
Seven students from the class
of 1989 have reported taking
public-interest jobs, although the
complete annual survey has not
yet been officially conducted.
According to Butler, money
plays a large role in deciding what
kind of law career to pursue. "So
many of my friends say, 'If it
wasn't for the money, I would go
into public interest now,
forever,' " she said.
But there is more to the equa
tion than the financial inequity,
according to Jeanne Vatterott, the
public-interest programs coordi
nator in the Law School's office
of career services. Vatterott said
that private law firms make it
easy for students because they can
project their hiring and expansion
needs a year in advance.
Each fall, representatives from
500 firms come to Stanford to
impress and entice third-year stu
dents. Public-interest groups, on
