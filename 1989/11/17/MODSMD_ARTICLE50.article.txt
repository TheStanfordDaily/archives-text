# Fraternity safeguards parties
## SAE guest list includes Stanford students, excludes others 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
No invitation, no entrance.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Mi
chael Hughes suggested such an
admittance policy for fraternity
parties in an interview last week,
but the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fra
ternity was a step ahead of him.
SAEs began requiring invita
tions at the end of fall quarter
1988, in an effort to avoid alcohol
related injuries and decrease
liability costs for the fraternity.
The invitation policy, which
Hughes said will improve the
image of campus fraternities, is
being expanded this year by the
SAEs.
Invitations are available for
everyone in the Stanford commu
nity, and already "800 to 900 in
vitations have been given out"
through dorm visits and White
Plaza distribution by fraternity

members, SAE president John
Connolly said.
By making the parties closed to
uninvited guests, SAEs are eligi
ble for a liability-reduction insur
ance policy, Connolly said. He
added that requiring invitations
helps "keep Foothill College stu
dents and (Palo Alto High School)
students out" of the parties.
"We're not trying to be exclu
sive — just make parties safer,"
he said. SAEs began requiring in
vitations at the end of fall quarter
1988. Because of the success in
keeping parties better under con
trol, the program has been ex
panded this year.
Additions this year include
"sober drivers at our party and
sober monitors at the door to
make sure people don't leave with
drinks," Connolly said.
He added that the SAEs are
barricading driveways so guests
will not drink and drive.

Continuing a policy from last
year, the SAEs hire a professional
bouncer to stand at the door and
make sure students either have
invitations or have their names
on the guest list, Connolly said.
"I think the invitation policy is
absolutely necessary because
we're in a difficult situation. . . .
If we have an open party and
someone gets hurt, we're respon
sible," said social chair Bill I)er
win.
Freshman Justin Davis felt in
vitations are "a good idea in that
anyone who wants one can get
one," but it's a good way for SAE
to have safer, more controlled par
ties.
Connolly suggested that the
SAEs are the only fraternity to
hold closed parties because "other
fraternities may fear negative
campus reactions if they do this,"
he said.
