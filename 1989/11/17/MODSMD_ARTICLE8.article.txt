Bicyclist exposes himself
In the latest of a series of indecent
exposure incidents on campus, a man
seated on a bicycle exposed himself
to a freshman woman on a jogging
path parallel to Stanford Avenue near
the Rains Houses yesterday around
3:50 p.m.
The woman said the man was
wearing a blue T-shirt and jeans, ex
cept for his genitals, which were ex
posed. As she passed by, she said, he
was masturbating.
The freshman, who asked not to be
identified, said she saw the man
toward the end of the jogging path,
which is surrounded by trees and is
relatively secluded.
The man was fairly well built and
had dark brown hair with a beard
and mustache, she said. Although it
was difficult to tell his height because
he was seated on the bicycle, she
guessed that he was approximately 6
feet tall.
The man said nothing to her, but
stared intently, she said.
The freshman ran past the man
and returned home as soon as possible.
She said she saw two women farther
along the path and told them to turn
around.
The description and actions of the
man fit those of a suspect in a number
of reported indecent exposures on
campus and in Palo Alto, the most
recent of which occurred behind the
Environmental Safety Facility Nov. 9.
In a possibly related incident, police
records also reported a case of "suspi
cious circumstances" surrounding the
sighting of a man near the tennis

courts last Friday. However, no police
spokesperson was available to provide
details.

Principal to speak here
Noted educator George McKenna
will speak on urban school reform at
7 p.m. tonight at Kresge Auditorium.
As the principal of George Wash
ington High School in Los Angeles,
McKenna designed the "Preparatory
School Model" to address such prob
lems as low self-esteem and high crime
rates.
Over the course of the past four
years, McKenna transformed the
failing high school into a success story.
While the school had been known for
low achievement, it now sends 80 per
cent of its graduates to college.
McKenna's efforts have earned him
over 300 commendations from a va
riety of civic and professional organ
izations. He is also the 1989 recipient
of the Congressional Black Caucus
Chairman's Award.
McKenna's address marks the cul
mination of the Stanford Omega Psi
Phi fraternity's sixth annual Achieve
ment Week.
A strong advocate of building com
munities from within, McKenna views
the educational system as the primary
way to effect positive change, said
William Faucette, president of Omega
Psi Phi.

Forum will explore quake
A special conference on earthquake
activity in the Bay Area will be held

Sunday at 1 p.m. in Memorial Audi
torium.

Entitled "In the Wake of the Quake:
Perspectives on California Earth
quakes," the conference will feature
experts from Stanford's departments
of Geophysics and Civil Engineering,
the U.S. Geological Survey and the
Bay Area Regional Earthquake
Preparedness Project.
The speakers will discuss the his
tory and geology of Bay Area
earthquakes, the physics and effect of
the Oct. 17 quake and ways to prepare
for the future.
More weenie vandalism
Another case of pre-Big Game van
dalism was reported yesterday at
Stanford's Sailing Center in Redwood
City, but Robert Brown, a captain of
the sailing team, said the vandalism
was "not malicious" and there was
"no damage" to speak of.
Brown said the vandals spray
painted bear paws and slogans on the
tarmac and cordoned off the area with
yellow tape and "official-looking"
signs warning the water was unsafe
to enter.
But when Stanford team members
called the phone numbers listed on
the fliers, they confirmed their
suspicions that the blockage was a
hoax.
Brown said Berkeley sailing team
members were probably responsible,
but stressed that Stanford team mem
bers were not angered by the "minor"
vandalism.
Asked whether retaliation was
planned, Brown would only say, "We'll
see." — Elizabeth Howton

More weenie vandalism
Another case of pre-Big Game van
dalism was reported yesterday at
Stanford's Sailing Center in Redwood
City, but Robert Brown, a captain of
the sailing team, said the vandalism
was "not malicious" and there was
"no damage" to speak of.
Brown said the vandals spray
painted bear paws and slogans on the
tarmac and cordoned off the area with
yellow tape and "official-looking"
signs warning the water was unsafe
to enter.
But when Stanford team members
called the phone numbers listed on
the fliers, they confirmed their
suspicions that the blockage was a
hoax.
Brown said Berkeley sailing team
members were probably responsible,
but stressed that Stanford team mem
bers were not angered by the "minor"
vandalism.
Asked whether retaliation was
planned, Brown would only say, "We'll
see." — Elizabeth Howton
