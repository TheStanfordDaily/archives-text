# ASSU senator confusion behind funding dispute
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Although some ASSU senators alleged
political bias in the Nov. 9 attempt to deny
funding to two left-leaning student groups,
the real issue was other senators' confusion
over ASSU bylaws and University regula
tions.
According to University guidelines, the
ASSU is allowed to fund political organi
zations like the Stanford Central American
Action Network and the Democratic
Socialists, said Student Organization Serv
ices Director Michael Ramsey-Perez.
However, it is prohibited by law from
giving monetary support to any partisan
political activities, such as supporting a
political candidate in an election.
At last week's meeting, senator Enrique
Origgi proposed an amendment excising
SCAAN and the socialist group from a
Program Board bill approving funding for
voluntary student organizations. Students
First senators John Abbott, Jorge Velaz
quez and Kevin Warsh supported the bill.
But senators Stacey Leyton and Maria
Saldana alleged that Origgi's amendment
was a politically motivated opposition to
left-leaning organizations.
Origgi said he felt the two groups violated
a 1987 ASSU Senate Administration and
Rules Committee memorandum stating
that the Program Board should "follow
University regulations and not fund any
strictly partisan political activities" as well
as funding "only programming and not
operational expenses" of organizations
which engage in partisan political activity.
According to Origgi, the senate "needed
to review these [two groups] to be sure
that we were in accordance with ASSU

non-profit status as well as previous ASSU
decisions."
Because the ASSU is a non-profit, tax
exempt University organization, it is pro
hibited by law from funding such activities
as "solicitation of funds or endorsements
[for political candidates]" performed by vo
luntary student organizations.
But Ramsey-Perez said when SCAAN
and the Democratic Socialists presented
their proposals to the Program Board, "the
activities they are proposing to do are not
partisan political activities," he said.
Ramsey-Perez said any organization ap
plying to the Program Board for ASSU
funds must state the purpose of the money
and must agree that it will not use the
money for partisan political activities.
He said even though some groups do
participate in partisan political activities,
the money they use to support those ac
tivities must come from other sources be
sides the ASSU.
An example, he explained, is if "a person
wanted to bring George Bush to campus
... to give a talk... . That he is a politician
doesn't matter," and the activity can
receive funding.
But, he added, the ASSU could not fund
a lobbying campaign for pro-choice legisla
tion, for example.
Velazquez said "because of lack of infor
mation and confusion at the meeting, I
could not approve of the bill." Origgi said
he would have never proposed the amend
ment if he knew "SCAAN was not in viola
tion of those things."
Warsh said although SCAAN and the
socialist group are "more leftward leaning
than we . . . many Students First members
are very much in favor of those organiza
tions."
