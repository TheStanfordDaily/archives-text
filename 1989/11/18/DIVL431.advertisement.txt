Adapt, Improve,
Refine.
If there's one constant at Seagate Technology, it's
change. Because in a rapidly changing industry
like microcomputer mass storage, the company
that succeeds is the company that has learned
how to adapt to market conditions.
At Seagate, our success has been driven by
world-class design and manufacturing facilities
populated by outstanding engineers and re
searchers. Our high-performance solutions con
tinue to make Seagate an industry leader. And
we will improve and refine that position with
your help.
If you're looking to improve your career, and
you're ready to adapt to an environment where
excellence is expected, look into these current
opportunities to work on 3-1/2" and 5-1/4"
disc drives.
