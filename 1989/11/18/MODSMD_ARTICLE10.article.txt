# Setbacks aside, Hinckley ready to make noise in NFL
## 
### Jason Waggoner 
Vince Lombardi once said:
"Football is blocking and tackling.
Everything else is mythology."
Fifth-year senior Rob Hinckley,
perhaps one of Stanford's greatest
linebackers, seems to have heeded
the words of the great Packers
coach as far as defense goes.
Tackling opposing ball carriers,
receivers and quarterbacks has
been Hinckley's strength since he
arrived at Stanford in 1985.
Last season, Hinckley was first
in the Pacific 10 Conference in
sacks, second on the team in un
assisted tackles and fourth on the
team in total stops. In fact, last
year he had one of the most mem
orable performances by a Stan
ford football player ever by
recording 17 unassisted tackles,
six tackles-for- loss, and 4V2 quar
terback sacks against UCLA.
However, this projected 1989
Ail-American and potential first
rounder in the NFL draft ran into
a roadblock against San Jose State
this season. On the first drive of
the Sept. 30 game, Hinckley was
"bent" under a pile of Spartans
and sprained his back.
"My spine felt as if it was com
pressed like an accordion under
the weight of the players,"
Hinckley said.
Consequently, he missed the
Notre Dame, Washington State
and Utah games. Returning for
the USC and UCLA contests in
which, according to Coach Denny
Green, Hinckley was only 80 per
cent healthy, he helped anchor a
defense which played solidly
against the Trojans and was out
standing in an upset over the
favored Bruins.

At Arizona State last week,
Hinckley had what Green called
"an excellent game defending the
[run]" in Stanford's narrow 30-22
loss.
Hinckley, who according to his
teammates is a leader by example,
is portrayed by his coaches as a
hard worker who always puts out
100 percent. Although football
runs in his family his brother
is a redshirt freshman on the Car
dinal team he runs countless
sprints and spends extra time lif
ting weights to become strong
enough and fast enough for the
pro game. Hinckley is "NFL
strong-side linebacker material,"
said Green, who just last year was
an assistant with the 49ers in the
NFL.
In addition, Hinckley studies
game films of offenses for many
hours to prepare himself mentally
for what he describes as a "weekly
battle."
This football star not only
researches opposing offenses, he
also finds time to carry a 3.2 grade
point average as a communication
major. Twice he was named a Pac
-10 All-Academic honorable men
tion selection.
As Robert W. Hinckley's senior
season draws to a close, he can
ponder over a great career. His
fondest memories as a Cardinal
include the 1986 Gator Bowl in
which he contributed on special
teams in Stanford's 27-21 loss to
Clemson and this year's come
from-behind stunner against
Oregon.
"Although the Cardinal did not
have a winning season," Hinckley
commented, "I enjoyed playing
with this great group of guys. I
learned a lot about myself this

year; especially how to deal with
setbacks that will hopefully make
me a better football player and
person."

A win in today's Big Game
would be important for Hinckley
and the Cardinal for two reasons.
First, it would be another win for

Stanford against the hated cross-
Bay foe. Second, it would be the
icing on the cake for a magnificent
college football career.
