# Fifth-years bid Farm fond farewell
## 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer 
The post-practice stillness of
the corridor outside the locker
room is stirred by the soft, mel
lifluous speech of Cardinal
noseguard Buck Roggeman.
You read me right: mellifluous.
It's the kind of word he would
use. An English major, Roggeman
has found a role as a walking
thesaurus for his fifth-year foot
ball teammates. He is, by every
one's consent, their "vocabulary
policeman."
Bruce Lang was groping for a
word to describe this year's Big
Game. "Fulcrum," said Rog
geman, laughing. Apparently, the
word has been bandied about
amongst some of the nostalgia
prone fifth-year seniors Lang,
Roggeman, Lester Archambeau,
Rob Englehardt and Andy Papat
hanassiou.
"Yeah, it's the fulcrum," Lang
smiled. "I'm excited about Satur
day it's everything I've been
working for in 15 years of football,
all coming down to one game."
Today's Big Game is Lang's
farewell to football. "This is it,"
he said. "When I came to Stan
ford, I had no real hopes or ex
pectations for professional
football."
But even as they don the Car
dinal's colors for the last time
today, some of Lang's teammates
hope to sport an NFL jersey next
fall. I asked Lester Archambeau
if he thought he'd "pick up a foot
ball again" after Big Game as a
professional player.
"Well, I've never touched a foot
ball," the defensive tackle replied.
"But I'll be putting on pads again
for the Shrine Game on January
20. And who knows? I'd love to
give the NFL a shot."
However, the NFL is still a
world away today. For the red-clad
rabble cheering from the stands,
for the proudly chaotic Stanford
band, but most of all for the nine
players who have given five years
to Cardinal football, today's Big
Game assumes epic proportions.
"I love everything that Big
Game is about," Roggeman said.
"It's everything I ever wanted in
college football a good, heated
rivalry with a lot of animosity but
no hate."
"It's starting to sink in," said
teammate Rob Englehardt,
looking around at his buddies.
"It's the last time we're going to
play together." The safety had
been playful and exuberant during
our interview, but he spoke with
quiet sincerity now. "You couldn't
ask for a better bunch of guys to
be around. Really."
Offensive guard Andy Papat
hanassiou in spite of his broad
back, his name barely fits across

his jersey expressed the same
sentiments. "I feel a lot of different
things going into the game," he
said. "There's kind of a sense that
it's time to move on to other
things, but there's obviously a lot
of sadness involved."
"We're leaving a great group of
guys," Papathanassiou continued.
"It's kind of like the boat's leaving
without you you know, every
body else gets to come back, but
we have to go home."
But "Papa" and his buddies don't
plan on going home without the
Axe. "Big Game is played on emo
tion," he said. "And if it's emotion
that decides the game, I'd
definitely give the edge to us."
"I want to win. That's really
it," said Archambeau, with a de
termination you wouldn't dare
question when it comes from
someone who stands at 6'5", 260
pounds. "I've played in three Big
Games, and I'm exactly .500
one, one, and one. I really want
to get this win it would make
up for a lot of frustration this
year."
You might wonder if just one
game can make up for the frus
tration of a 2-8 season. But the
experts the guys who've fought

hard all year long, only to end up
with frustrating losses say it
can. "If you're having a great
year, and you lose to Cal, that
taints your season," Archambeau
said. "If you're having a bad
season, and you beat Cal, that
brings it up a lot."
"If you can't get up for this
game, I don't think you can get
up for any game," Englehardt said
emphatically, with a good-sized
grin. Upon request, he elaborated
on the concept of what it means
to be "up" during a game: a rush
of adrenaline and raw physical en
ergy of a high intensity.
"When you see a big hit and
I'm not sure if it's better to see
a big hit or be in on one it's
the next best thing to sex," the
brazen native of Tampa, Fl. said.
Englehardt seems to be the
"playful kid" among this group of
five-year veterans. After the foot
ball season is over this year he
plans to play rugby at Stanford.
Depending on the outcome of the
football draft, he might take some
time next year to travel through
Europe, or play rugby in
Australia.

"I want to be a kid for a couple
more years," he said. A commu
nications major, Englehardt even

tually expects to settle down to a
career in documentary film pro
duction.
In the meantime, he and the
others will find creative ways to
use up their extra energy after
football season is over. "I'll prob
ably watch a lot of TV and just
kind of wander around," Papat
hanassiou said. "I want to see
what life is like during the hours
between one and six." The
novelty of free afternoon time will
wear off soon enough as the pres
sures of the real world intrude.
Fellow teammate Bruce Lang
plans to work in the Stanford area
after he graduates in June. An
electrical engineering major, he'll
be looking for interviews with
software corporations in the
Silicon Valley.
However, lest "Cardinal Today"
readers get the impression that

Bruce is a serious sort of guy,
Papa interrupted his teammate to
bring to light an important fact.
"Bruce, by the way, gets the title
of Senior Class Dating King."
Be that as it may, Bruce and
his fifth-year teammates want to
bring home a different title today.
They and the rest of the Cardinal
team will be battling today for
the right to yell from the top of
Hoover Tower what Rob
Englehardt did not hesitate to say
for the record: "Cal sucks."
Ever the honey-tongued Her
cules, Buck Roggeman spoke with
less coarseness but no less deter
mination about what the team
will accomplish today. "They want
you to leave with a really great
taste in your mouth," he said of
the Cardinal players who will be
returning next year. "And the best
way to do that is to keep the Axe."

dinal's colors for the last time
today, some of Lang's teammates
hope to sport an NFL jersey next
fall. I asked Lester Archambeau
if he thought he'd "pick up a foot
ball again" after Big Game as a
professional player.
"Well, I've never touched a foot
ball," the defensive tackle replied.
"But I'll be putting on pads again
for the Shrine Game on January
20. And who knows? I'd love to
give the NFL a shot."
However, the NFL is still a
world away today. For the red-clad
rabble cheering from the stands,
for the proudly chaotic Stanford
band, but most of all for the nine
players who have given five years
to Cardinal football, today's Big
Game assumes epic proportions.
"I love everything that Big
Game is about," Roggeman said.
"It's everything I ever wanted in
college football a good, heated
rivalry with a lot of animosity but
no hate."
"It's starting to sink in," said
teammate Rob Englehardt,
looking around at his buddies.
"It's the last time we're going to
play together." The safety had
been playful and exuberant during
our interview, but he spoke with
quiet sincerity now. "You couldn't
ask for a better bunch of guys to
be around. Really."
Offensive guard Andy Papat
hanassiou in spite of his broad
back, his name barely fits across

his jersey expressed the same
sentiments. "I feel a lot of different
things going into the game," he
said. "There's kind of a sense that
it's time to move on to other
things, but there's obviously a lot
of sadness involved."
"We're leaving a great group of
guys," Papathanassiou continued.
"It's kind of like the boat's leaving
without you you know, every
body else gets to come back, but
we have to go home."
But "Papa" and his buddies don't
plan on going home without the
Axe. "Big Game is played on emo
tion," he said. "And if it's emotion
that decides the game, I'd
definitely give the edge to us."
"I want to win. That's really
it," said Archambeau, with a de
termination you wouldn't dare
question when it comes from
someone who stands at 6'5", 260
pounds. "I've played in three Big
Games, and I'm exactly .500
one, one, and one. I really want
to get this win it would make
up for a lot of frustration this
year."
You might wonder if just one
game can make up for the frus
tration of a 2-8 season. But the
experts the guys who've fought

hard all year long, only to end up
with frustrating losses say it
can. "If you're having a great
year, and you lose to Cal, that
taints your season," Archambeau
said. "If you're having a bad
season, and you beat Cal, that
brings it up a lot."
"If you can't get up for this
game, I don't think you can get
up for any game," Englehardt said
emphatically, with a good-sized
grin. Upon request, he elaborated
on the concept of what it means
to be "up" during a game: a rush
of adrenaline and raw physical en
ergy of a high intensity.
"When you see a big hit and
I'm not sure if it's better to see
a big hit or be in on one it's
the next best thing to sex," the
brazen native of Tampa, Fl. said.
Englehardt seems to be the
"playful kid" among this group of
five-year veterans. After the foot
ball season is over this year he
plans to play rugby at Stanford.
Depending on the outcome of the
football draft, he might take some
time next year to travel through
Europe, or play rugby in
Australia.

"I want to be a kid for a couple
more years," he said. A commu
nications major, Englehardt even

tually expects to settle down to a
career in documentary film pro
duction.
In the meantime, he and the
others will find creative ways to
use up their extra energy after
football season is over. "I'll prob
ably watch a lot of TV and just
kind of wander around," Papat
hanassiou said. "I want to see
what life is like during the hours
between one and six." The
novelty of free afternoon time will
wear off soon enough as the pres
sures of the real world intrude.
Fellow teammate Bruce Lang
plans to work in the Stanford area
after he graduates in June. An
electrical engineering major, he'll
be looking for interviews with
software corporations in the
Silicon Valley.
However, lest "Cardinal Today"
readers get the impression that

Bruce is a serious sort of guy,
Papa interrupted his teammate to
bring to light an important fact.
"Bruce, by the way, gets the title
of Senior Class Dating King."
Be that as it may, Bruce and
his fifth-year teammates want to
bring home a different title today.
They and the rest of the Cardinal
team will be battling today for
the right to yell from the top of
Hoover Tower what Rob
Englehardt did not hesitate to say
for the record: "Cal sucks."
Ever the honey-tongued Her
cules, Buck Roggeman spoke with
less coarseness but no less deter
mination about what the team
will accomplish today. "They want
you to leave with a really great
taste in your mouth," he said of
the Cardinal players who will be
returning next year. "And the best
way to do that is to keep the Axe."

After leaving the Stanford baseball team during his sophomore
year to concentrate on football, tight end Jim Price is now Stanford's
third-leading receiver.
The post-practice stillness of
the corridor outside the locker
room is stirred by the soft, mel
lifluous speech of Cardinal
noseguard Buck Roggeman.
You read me right: mellifluous.
It's the kind of word he would
use. An English major, Roggeman
has found a role as a walking
thesaurus for his fifth-year foot
ball teammates. He is, by every
one's consent, their "vocabulary
policeman."
Bruce Lang was groping for a
word to describe this year's Big
Game. "Fulcrum," said Rog
geman, laughing. Apparently, the
word has been bandied about
amongst some of the nostalgia
prone fifth-year seniors Lang,
Roggeman, Lester Archambeau,
Rob Englehardt and Andy Papat
hanassiou.
"Yeah, it's the fulcrum," Lang
smiled. "I'm excited about Satur
day it's everything I've been
working for in 15 years of football,
all coming down to one game."
Today's Big Game is Lang's
farewell to football. "This is it,"
he said. "When I came to Stan
ford, I had no real hopes or ex
pectations for professional
football."
But even as they don the Car

today, some of Lang's teammates
