# Record shows Taylor took blows and did it his way

Troy Taylor has no regrets.
Troy Taylor is disappointed, but
he has no regrets.
After four years of impressive
passing statistics, bothersome in
juries, and frustrating losses,
Taylor can sometimes look back
on it all with no reservations.
By amassing 7,749 passing
yards, Taylor managed to become
the most successful California
quarterback ever. He is the school
record-holder for total offense,
with 7,838 yards. His 50 touch
down passes is the most in Cal
history. Taylor will probably pass
Stanford alumnus Jim Plunkett
this Saturday to become the
fourth -most prolific passer in
Pacific 10 Conference history.
Despite all his success, Cal fans
and Taylor will always remember
two unfavorable things about the
Taylor era: Troy Taylor only
played two full season of football;
and, more importantly, Troy
Taylor never led California to a
winning record.
The Bears' best year under
Taylor was last year, when they
managed to break even with a
5-5-1 record. It has not helped
that injuries limited Taylor to six
games in 1986, and nine games

in 'B7 while severely restricting
his practice time this year.
In spite of the lost time and
the broken promises Taylor
refuses to be bitter about his years
at Cal. He has no use for
hindsight. "I think it's kind of
useless to think that way," said
Taylor. "A lot of people go through
their lives with one foot in the
past and one in the future, and
they're not thinking about the
present. If you have too many
regrets, you're not going to have
a happy life."
Taylor went on to contradict
himself, momentarily forgetting
about the present. "I don't allow
myself to be frustrated I'm
always looking ahead. You look
back to learn and then on to the
next game."
It would be easy to see how
Taylor could overlook the Stan
ford game despite its importance
to the students and alumni of both
schools. Taylor doesn't like the
hoopla attached to the Big Game.
"Big Game week ... I hate it. All
of a sudden, football's important
to a lot of people, when it was
important to me all along."
Taylor also has plenty of foot
ball to look forward to in his

him today.
