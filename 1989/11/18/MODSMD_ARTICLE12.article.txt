# Record shows Taylor took blows and did it his way

Troy Taylor has no regrets.
Troy Taylor is disappointed, but
he has no regrets.
After four years of impressive
passing statistics, bothersome in
juries, and frustrating losses,
Taylor can sometimes look back
on it all with no reservations.
By amassing 7,749 passing
yards, Taylor managed to become
the most successful California
quarterback ever. He is the school
record-holder for total offense,
with 7,838 yards. His 50 touch
down passes is the most in Cal
history. Taylor will probably pass
Stanford alumnus Jim Plunkett
this Saturday to become the
fourth -most prolific passer in
Pacific 10 Conference history.
Despite all his success, Cal fans
and Taylor will always remember
two unfavorable things about the
Taylor era: Troy Taylor only
played two full season of football;
and, more importantly, Troy
Taylor never led California to a
winning record.
The Bears' best year under
Taylor was last year, when they
managed to break even with a
5-5-1 record. It has not helped
that injuries limited Taylor to six
games in 1986, and nine games

in 'B7 while severely restricting
his practice time this year.
In spite of the lost time and
the broken promises Taylor
refuses to be bitter about his years
at Cal. He has no use for
hindsight. "I think it's kind of
useless to think that way," said
Taylor. "A lot of people go through
their lives with one foot in the
past and one in the future, and
they're not thinking about the
present. If you have too many
regrets, you're not going to have
a happy life."
Taylor went on to contradict
himself, momentarily forgetting
about the present. "I don't allow
myself to be frustrated I'm
always looking ahead. You look
back to learn and then on to the
next game."
It would be easy to see how
Taylor could overlook the Stan
ford game despite its importance
to the students and alumni of both
schools. Taylor doesn't like the
hoopla attached to the Big Game.
"Big Game week ... I hate it. All
of a sudden, football's important
to a lot of people, when it was
important to me all along."
Taylor also has plenty of foot
ball to look forward to in his

After missing most of Big Game with an injury last year, Brian
Treggs, Cal's leading receiver, is hoping the fates are kinder to
him today.
career. While the season ends
today for most of his California
teammates, Taylor has a two all
star games to play in before he
moves on to the NFL career that
he has dreamed about. "I have so
many things to look forward to,"
Taylor waxed whimsically, "that
it's hard not to daydream a little
bit."
Cal supporters should be quick
to bring Taylor back to earth,
reminding Taylor that, before he
embarks on his professional
career, a victory against Stanford
would take care of some of the
regrets. In his three previous

years, Cal played to a tie in 'BB,
a loss in 'B7, and a win in 'B6.
That winning squad, however, did
not include Troy Taylor, who was
sidelined with a broken jaw.
Bears' Coach Bruce Snyder in
dicated that, although Taylor
hasn't always been able to play
or live up to expectations, Snyder
has no qualms with Taylor.
"When you're under a microscope
and so much is expected of you,
that's when you show signs of
strength or weakness. Things
didn't go well, but he has been a
champion."
Snyder indicated that, through
all the struggles, Taylor has kept
his chin up. "I've seen him get
angry, but I've never seen him
deflated. Mostly he gets angry at
himself."

Senior receiver Mike Ford, who
has been in the Cal program all
four years with him, remarked on
Taylor's mood on the field: "If
you drop a ball he doesn't make
you feel guilty, he boosts you up.
He's the one who keeps us going."
All the positive attitudes in the
world, though, won't erase the
losing records and the time lost
to injury.
"Frustrated ... I hate that
word because it makes me think
of someone who loses control and
can't perform at a high enough
level. I'm disappointed. It's not
like I didn't enjoy my time here.
"I got a great education, I like
the people I met, I worked with
great players and coaches. But it's
time to move on and grow. I'm
ready to get on with my life."
