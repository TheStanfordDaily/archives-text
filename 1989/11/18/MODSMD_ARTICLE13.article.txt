# For the Bears, it's T to shining T

As fifth-year senior quarterback
Troy Taylor pulls his blue-and
gold uniform over his shoulder
pads for his final collegiate game,
his primary receiving target,
sophomore Brian Treggs, will be
preparing for what he hopes will
be his first complete Big Game.
"I get real excited about Big
Game," Treggs said. "Seeing all
those people in the stands really
motivates me. I feel I owe them
something, being that I didn't get
a chance to play a full game last
year."

Last season as a freshman,
Treggs went down early in the
second quarter of the game at
California with a hamstring pull.
He was unable to contribute sig
nificantly in the second half.
Treggs has made an explosive
return this season. He is the only
Cal receiver to have caught at
least one pass in every game and
has averaged 4.4 catches per
game, sixth in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. After catching just 19
passes for 283 yards last season,
Treggs' reception statistics this
season 44 passes for 586 yards
place him fifth in the Pac-10
in yardage, and he will be shooting

to become the first Bear receiver
to eclipse the 600-yard mark for
a season since Ranee McDougald
in 1983.

"Every year I feel that I am
going to get better and better,"
Treggs said. "This year I have
basically attained my personal
goals so far. I've had a pretty good
season, but, at the same time, at
the beginning of the season my
basic goal was to do what I could
to help my team win. I would like
to see a lot more wins."

Despite being assured of a sub
.soo mark for 1989, the Bears
shocked Arizona and Washington
State with impressive offensive
showings in the last two weeks.
While Treggs has caught 11
passes for 135 yards in November,
Cal has averaged over seven yards
per offensive play. The Bears have
the opportunity to win their third
straight conference game for the
first time since 1975.

"Lately we have just been put
ting a lot of things together,"
Treggs said. "The offensive line,
considered the dark spot in the
offense at the beginning of the
season, has been playing well, and
Troy Taylor has been playing
great."
Taylor has continually found
Treggs open for big gains this

season. Treggs has recorded 286
more yards than any other Cal
receiver, including the longest
play on which the Golden Bears
have connected for the entire
season. In the 31-15 loss to USC
Oct. 14, Taylor found Treggs for
a 75-yard touchdown pass.
"The touchdown pass against
Southern Cal has to be the indi
vidual highlight of my season,"
Treggs said. "Southern Cal is just
one of the teams I hate. Being
from down South, I have a lot of
friends on that team. When I go
home, they can say they beat us,
but I can say I beat them."
Treggs considered attending
USC during his senior year at Car
son High School. That year he
caught 21 passes for 336 yards
and five touchdowns and received
first-team Pacific League, South
Bay and all-city honors. Recruited
by USC, UCLA, Washington
State, Arizona State, Illinois aftid
Syracuse, Treggs selected Cal for
its academic reputation as well as
for his desire to make an imme
diate impact on the football pro
gram.

"At Southern Cal and UCLA,
it's hard for a player to stand out
and be noticed," Treggs said. "At
Cal I'm getting noticed and get
ting a lot of publicity."
Treggs has made his mark re
turning punts this season as well.
He has returned 27 punts for an
average of 5.8 yards and leads the
team in all-purpose running with
771 yards.
"We're coming off two big wins
and the confidence from the vic
tories helps," Treggs said. "As far
as rivalry games go, anybody can
win; it depends on who wants it
more and whose day it is. There's
nothing like the Stanford-Cal
game, and we can't get too high
on the hype and lose focus "
