Stanford

In Cal's two big upsets the last
two weeks Taylor has averaged
370 yards per game and has com
pleted 68.8 percent of his passes.
He has finally gotten rid of the
minor injuries that have plagued
him all season long and has begun
to play like the quarterback Cal
hyped as a long-shot contender for
the Heisman Trophy. Scott, Stan
ford's free safety for the past
month after he was converted
from cornerback, has played well
at his new position but will be
tested severely today.

Cal's passing offense had
struggled almost all year until the
slump was snapped two weeks
ago. The biggest beneficiary of the
new-found passing prowess has
been Treggs, who leads the Bears
in receiving with 44 catches for
586 yards. He will often be going
against Grant, a four-year starter
at cornerback. Grant has
struggled lately, however, and has
been burned for a couple of scores.
He will have a tough time ending
his Stanford career in style
against Treggs.

The Golden Bears have been
considered a passing team all
season, but their running attack
is not that bad. Their leading
rusher, Anthony Wallace, will
probably miss the game due to
injury, but Zomalt has come in
and run for over 300 yards. He
ran for 105 yards against Wash
ington State last week to become
only the third freshman in Cal
history to reach 100 yards in a
game. He will be going against a
defense that is very strong against
the run, however. Garnett has
seen limited action the past two
weeks because of injury.

As it has been all year, Stan
ford's running game will be very
important today. The Cardinal has
struggled to move the ball on the
ground all season, but Eschelman
has led a surge the past two
weeks, rushing for about 150
yards in the last two games.
Looking to stop him will be a Cal
defense led by Ortega. He is far
and away the team's leading tack
ier with 145 stops, 60 more than
anyone else on the team.

Starting quarterback Steve
Smith will probably throw the ball
a lot today. While opposing
defenses have concentrated on
stopping split end Ed McCaffrey
this year, Pinckney has gotten
open often in the other side of
the field. Pinckney has five touch
downs this year, including two
long ones last week. Parrish, who
leads the team with four inter
ceptions, will be responsible for
Pinckney at least some of the time
and will have to be at his best to
shut down Stanford's hottest
receiver.

After last year's Big Game,
nobody will ever underestimate
the importance of the kicking
game. The two kickers in this
game were expected to be two of
the top placekickers in the nation
going into this year. Instead, due
at least in part to the removal of
tees by the NCAA Rules Commit
tee, Hopkins is 15-of-27 and Keen
is 9-of-15. Keen has made his
mark as a punter this season, how
ever, as he is ranked eighth in
the nation.
