# Freshmen play for new coach, even if a bit Green
## Redshirt fast becoming an endangered species 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
New Stanford football coach Denny
Green is a young man but an old veteran
of the Farm, having assisted here twice
before becoming coach last January. He
brings with him brand-new enthusiasm
mixed with old-fashioned Stanford Cardi
nal traditions.
One of these traditions is coats and ties
for road trips, a dress code which tradition
laden teams such as Notre Dame require.
A more noticeable and significant tradition
that also follows the Irish lead is the red
shirting policy.
Put simply, Green doesn't believe in the
mass redshirting of freshman players to
give them an adjustment year. "I'm not a
big believer in holding out freshmen, be
cause I'm not necessarily a big believer in
the fifth year," Green said. "I think a fifth
year should be for guys who are hurt."
Green's predecessor, Jack Elway, believed
strongly in the system. Two years ago, only
three of the 20-odd recruits saw any playing
time. Last year, Elway redshirted every
one of his freshmen. In contrast, going into
Big Game this year Green has played 12
of his recruits, more than half of the 21-
member class.

Green doesn't just let the first-year
players in at garbage time, either. He ex
pects his freshmen to contribute, not just
get their feet wet.
Five of the 12 have started: Jimmy Klein
and Dave Garnett have been stalwarts on
the defense, Rick Pallow and Bob Whitfield
have won spots on the offensive line, and
Paul Stonehouse has been the punter since
the third game of the season.

"I believe that you play the best player,
regardless of whether he's a fourth year
or a freshman," Green said.
This abrupt change of policy in the Stan
ford program has come as a surprise to at
least a few freshmen. "The previous coach
ing staff, the Elway administration, had
redshirted everybody. I assumed that that
was the way Coach Green would do things,"
said Klein, who started at free safety
against Washington State this year. "I told
everyone at home I was expecting to red
shirt."

Although it was necessarily an adjust
ment at first, most of the freshmen who
have played this year agree with Green's
tactics. "At first I didn't want to (play
freshman year)," said Tyrone Parker, a
center who saw early-season time before
being injured. Now, "I like not having to
redshirt. It makes you more a part of the
team," he said.
Green did not hestitate to give freshmen
their first playing as late as the sixth or
seventh game of the season, when par
ticipating in even one play uses up a full
year of eligibility. Green also wants his
players to know while a fifth year for those
who do sit out is not impossible, they should
get their degree in four.
"You graduate in four years," said Green
of his polity, "like we used to. When Stan
ford has done well, that's the way they did
it. I can give you a long list of guys who
were All-Americans, first-round draft
choices, and across the board. They were
all four-year graduates."

This could result in some academic dif

ficulties for 18-year-old freshmen who must
devote much of their time to studying for
football and travelling with the team while
trying to become acclimated to Stanford
academics. John Lynch, a quarterback, tes
tifies to this.
"It's really tough," he said. "I study (for
football) as much as I study in school. As
a quarterback, you have to know so much
more."
Freshman punter Paul Stonehouse, how
ever, sees the logic behind Green's position.
"I think if you have a problem though, he
(Green) would be willing to help you out.
He just wants us not to goof off in school
and take summer school as a catch-up
course, or a fifth year as a catch-up course.
Rather, be a student and a football player."
Paul Nickel, a tight end who played spe
cial teams against Notre Dame, echoed
these sentiments. "College should be a four
year experience."
Aside from academics, there are other
typical reasons given for redshirting: 1) A
player has more chance to build strength
and grow; 2) He has a chance to mature
mentally; 3) The player gets an opportunity
to learn the complex college system.
The first situation Green is sympathetic
to, and admitted in "a special case" a player
may need a year to grow and he would
then grant a redshirt year. On the other
hand, there are guys like Garnett, Pallow,
and the 6-7, 300-pound Whitfield who are
strong, physically mature players who can
contribute now.
The second has two sides, because a
player who doesn't have a chance to play
his first year may have a poor attitude
from the experience and consequently not
mature as fast. Challenging a player to
prove himself could tend to make him ma
ture.

Finally, there doesn't seem to be that
much of a learning advantage in sitting
freshman year. Offensive and defensive
schemes change every year, as different
players graduate or coaches move on. Also,
redshirt freshmen under Elway ran the
scout team, which meant they were learn
ing the opposing team's offense or defense
each week, instead of the Cardinal's.
Injured Stanford quarterback Brian
Johnson was a scout team member three
years ago, and he takes a positive view on
Lynch and the other freshmen playing this
year.
"It will be more valuable for him to do
what he's doing now than it would be to
redshirt, just because he's going to adapt
better," said Johnson. "He's a part of the
team, rather than an outcast."
Lynch agrees. "I wanted to go through
and play anyways," he said. "That's why
I came here in recruiting. They told me,
'lf you're next in line, you go in.' I didn't
want to redshirt."

There is one benefit from playing true
freshmen which coaches hope they will
never have accrue. As in the case of wide
receiver Ed McCaffery, if a player plays
freshman year and then gets hurt later in
his college career, he can redshirt to avoid
losing that year of eligibility.
But if that player is like running backs
Charlie Young or Jon Volpe, because he
redshirted his freshman year he cannot
redshirt later on, even if he sits for an
entire season due to injury.
Finally, some true freshmen have extra
reasons for wanting to play right away.
Klein came in having struck a deal with
the Cardinal coaching staff: if he saw action
this year, he would be allowed to miss
spring football practice to play volleyball
for Stanford.

Klein has accomplished his goal, and be
comes another part of Green's vision of
bringing back old Cardinal values. "The
Stanford tradition says you're involved in
a lot of sports and you give 100 percent in
those sports," Green said.
"We look for Klein to play volleyball, and
a lot of other guys to be involved in a lot
of other sports. They'll still maintain their
grades, they'll still graduate in four years,
and they're going to have quite a career."

'I wanted to go through
and play anyways.
That's why I came here
in recruiting. They told
me, "If you're next in
line, you go in." I didn't
want to redshirt.'

cause I'm not necessarily a big believer in
the fifth year," Green said. "I think a fifth
year should be for guys who are hurt."
Green's predecessor, Jack Elway, believed
strongly in the system. Two years ago, only
three of the 20-odd recruits saw any playing
time. Last year, Elway redshirted every
one of his freshmen. In contrast, going into
Big Game this year Green has played 12
of his recruits, more than half of the 21-
member class.

Green doesn't just let the first-year
players in at garbage time, either. He ex
pects his freshmen to contribute, not just
get their feet wet.
Five of the 12 have started: Jimmy Klein
and Dave Garnett have been stalwarts on
the defense, Rick Pallow and Bob Whitfield
have won spots on the offensive line, and
Paul Stonehouse has been the punter since
the third game of the season.

"I believe that you play the best player,
regardless of whether he's a fourth year
or a freshman," Green said.
This abrupt change of policy in the Stan
ford program has come as a surprise to at
least a few freshmen. "The previous coach
ing staff, the Elway administration, had
redshirted everybody. I assumed that that
was the way Coach Green would do things,"
said Klein, who started at free safety
against Washington State this year. "I told
everyone at home I was expecting to red
shirt."

Although it was necessarily an adjust
ment at first, most of the freshmen who
have played this year agree with Green's
tactics. "At first I didn't want to (play
freshman year)," said Tyrone Parker, a
center who saw early-season time before
being injured. Now, "I like not having to
redshirt. It makes you more a part of the
team," he said.
Green did not hestitate to give freshmen
their first playing as late as the sixth or
seventh game of the season, when par
ticipating in even one play uses up a full
year of eligibility. Green also wants his
players to know while a fifth year for those
who do sit out is not impossible, they should
get their degree in four.
"You graduate in four years," said Green
of his polity, "like we used to. When Stan
ford has done well, that's the way they did
it. I can give you a long list of guys who
were All-Americans, first-round draft
choices, and across the board. They were
all four-year graduates."

This could result in some academic dif

ficulties for 18-year-old freshmen who must
devote much of their time to studying for
football and travelling with the team while
trying to become acclimated to Stanford
academics. John Lynch, a quarterback, tes
tifies to this.
"It's really tough," he said. "I study (for
football) as much as I study in school. As
a quarterback, you have to know so much
more."
Freshman punter Paul Stonehouse, how
ever, sees the logic behind Green's position.
"I think if you have a problem though, he
(Green) would be willing to help you out.
He just wants us not to goof off in school
and take summer school as a catch-up
course, or a fifth year as a catch-up course.
Rather, be a student and a football player."
Paul Nickel, a tight end who played spe
cial teams against Notre Dame, echoed
these sentiments. "College should be a four
year experience."
Aside from academics, there are other
typical reasons given for redshirting: 1) A
player has more chance to build strength
and grow; 2) He has a chance to mature
mentally; 3) The player gets an opportunity
to learn the complex college system.
The first situation Green is sympathetic
to, and admitted in "a special case" a player
may need a year to grow and he would
then grant a redshirt year. On the other
hand, there are guys like Garnett, Pallow,
and the 6-7, 300-pound Whitfield who are
strong, physically mature players who can
contribute now.
The second has two sides, because a
player who doesn't have a chance to play
his first year may have a poor attitude
from the experience and consequently not
mature as fast. Challenging a player to
prove himself could tend to make him ma
ture.

Finally, there doesn't seem to be that
much of a learning advantage in sitting
freshman year. Offensive and defensive
schemes change every year, as different
players graduate or coaches move on. Also,
redshirt freshmen under Elway ran the
scout team, which meant they were learn
ing the opposing team's offense or defense
each week, instead of the Cardinal's.
Injured Stanford quarterback Brian
Johnson was a scout team member three
years ago, and he takes a positive view on
Lynch and the other freshmen playing this
year.
"It will be more valuable for him to do
what he's doing now than it would be to
redshirt, just because he's going to adapt
better," said Johnson. "He's a part of the
team, rather than an outcast."
Lynch agrees. "I wanted to go through
and play anyways," he said. "That's why
I came here in recruiting. They told me,
'lf you're next in line, you go in.' I didn't
want to redshirt."

There is one benefit from playing true
freshmen which coaches hope they will
never have accrue. As in the case of wide
receiver Ed McCaffery, if a player plays
freshman year and then gets hurt later in
his college career, he can redshirt to avoid
losing that year of eligibility.
But if that player is like running backs
Charlie Young or Jon Volpe, because he
redshirted his freshman year he cannot
redshirt later on, even if he sits for an
entire season due to injury.
Finally, some true freshmen have extra
reasons for wanting to play right away.
Klein came in having struck a deal with
the Cardinal coaching staff: if he saw action
this year, he would be allowed to miss
spring football practice to play volleyball
for Stanford.

Klein has accomplished his goal, and be
comes another part of Green's vision of
bringing back old Cardinal values. "The
Stanford tradition says you're involved in
a lot of sports and you give 100 percent in
those sports," Green said.
"We look for Klein to play volleyball, and
a lot of other guys to be involved in a lot
of other sports. They'll still maintain their
grades, they'll still graduate in four years,
and they're going to have quite a career."

Punter Paul Stonehouse, a high school Ail-American, is one of a large number of
true freshmen who have played for the Cardinal this season.
New Stanford football coach Denny
Green is a young man but an old veteran
of the Farm, having assisted here twice
before becoming coach last January. He
brings with him brand-new enthusiasm
mixed with old-fashioned Stanford Cardi
nal traditions.
One of these traditions is coats and ties
for road trips, a dress code which tradition
laden teams such as Notre Dame require.
A more noticeable and significant tradition
that also follows the Irish lead is the red
shirting policy.
