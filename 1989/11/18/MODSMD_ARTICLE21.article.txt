# Klein proves to be a Magnum Force for Card spikers
## 
### Amy Howard 
Kristin Klein isn't known as
"Magnum" for nothing.
The blond 6-footer on the Stan
ford women's volleyball team has
been a tremendous force the last
two seasons, garnering All-
America honors last year as a
freshman. Distinguished by her
high leap and vicious wind-up for
the smash, Klein is just about as
natural a volleyball player as they
come.

But that doesn't mean she
hasn't had to work hard. Growing
up in Southern California, Klein
began her volleyball career in 7th
grade when she tried out for her
school team. After her first
season, she decided to join a club
team so she could continue play
ing through the winter and
spring.

Once the volleyball bug had bit
ten, she couldn't seem to get
enough of it. Volleyball summer
camps were soon a regular part
of young Klein's life, and she con
tinued to play year-round
throughout high school.
Needless to say, Klein was
highly sought by college coaches
nationwide. She managed to nar
row her choices down to Pacific
10 conference rivals Stanford and
UCLA. Growing up across the
street from UCLA, she knew that
its volleyball program was very
strong.

Klein felt that Stanford's team
was just as good, however, and
she "liked the atmosphere a lot.
Everybody was very friendly, and
the academic reputation of Stan
ford couldn't be passed up."

That decision has turned out
to be a good one, she said. One

of the most surprising things
Klein found about college volley
ball was that the "level of play
was much higher than what I had
expected. It was great because it
was such a step up from what I
was used to."

Klein did not have high expec
tations for her freshman year,
however. "I didn't even know if I
would be playing," she said. The
fact that she ended up being an
Ail-American on a team that ad
vanced to post-season play is a
tribute both to her natural talent
and her gift for understatement.
Despite this, Klein said she has
still worked hard to improve her
game. "When I came to Stanford,
my technical skills weren't that
strong. I've changed my whole ap
proach, which used to be back
wards, and worked a lot on my
blocking. I think I have improved,
but I still have more improving
to do."

Coach Don Shaw agreed that
Klein has developed as a player
since last year. "She has learned
a lot about how to play at this
level, and I'm very pleased with
her progress," he said.
"Although she's still only a
sophomore, she is starting to come
to the front as one of our leaders.
She's our primary hitter, and we
go to her because we know she's
going to hit well."
Although this may put a lot of
pressure on her, Shaw said she
handles it well. "She's very com
petitive and she seems to be at
her best when it's needed, which
is a nice characteristic to have."

Part of Klein's success may also
be due to the fact that she is
always a team player. "All I care
about is the team overall and

whether we win or not," she said.
"If I have a bad game but the
team wins, I'm still happy."
Klein feels the team has taken
on a different dimension this year.
Although only one senior was lost
to graduation, a lot of new fresh
men have given the team new dy
namics, she said. Klein thought

that the team has gotten stronger
overall, but the level of the com
petition has risen as well.
"This season was a little frus
trating in the beginning when we
weren't dominating everything
like we expected to. We've tried
to keep things in perspective,
though, and realize that as long

as we are improving as a team
everything should pay off in the
end," she said.
Currently, the Cardinal is
ranked second in the Pac-10. Wins
over Washington and Washington
State this weekend would clinch
this position and assure Stanford
of an NCAA berth.

Klein found about college volley
ball was that the "level of play
was much higher than what I had
expected. It was great because it
was such a step up from what I
was used to."

Klein did not have high expec
tations for her freshman year,
however. "I didn't even know if I
would be playing," she said. The
fact that she ended up being an
Ail-American on a team that ad
vanced to post-season play is a
tribute both to her natural talent
and her gift for understatement.
Despite this, Klein said she has
still worked hard to improve her
game. "When I came to Stanford,
my technical skills weren't that
strong. I've changed my whole ap
proach, which used to be back
wards, and worked a lot on my
blocking. I think I have improved,
but I still have more improving
to do."

Coach Don Shaw agreed that
Klein has developed as a player
since last year. "She has learned
a lot about how to play at this
level, and I'm very pleased with
her progress," he said.
"Although she's still only a
sophomore, she is starting to come
to the front as one of our leaders.
She's our primary hitter, and we
go to her because we know she's
going to hit well."
Although this may put a lot of
pressure on her, Shaw said she
handles it well. "She's very com
petitive and she seems to be at
her best when it's needed, which
is a nice characteristic to have."

Part of Klein's success may also
be due to the fact that she is
always a team player. "All I care
about is the team overall and

whether we win or not," she said.
"If I have a bad game but the
team wins, I'm still happy."
Klein feels the team has taken
on a different dimension this year.
Although only one senior was lost
to graduation, a lot of new fresh
men have given the team new dy
namics, she said. Klein thought

that the team has gotten stronger
overall, but the level of the com
petition has risen as well.
"This season was a little frus
trating in the beginning when we
weren't dominating everything
like we expected to. We've tried
to keep things in perspective,
though, and realize that as long

as we are improving as a team
everything should pay off in the
end," she said.
Currently, the Cardinal is
ranked second in the Pac-10. Wins
over Washington and Washington
State this weekend would clinch
this position and assure Stanford
of an NCAA berth.
