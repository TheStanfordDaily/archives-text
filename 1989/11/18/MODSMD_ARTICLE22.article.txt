Editor's note: The following story
is a dramatization of the events
surrounding the 1892 Big Game
tie between Stanford and Califor
nia. It was originally published
in the 1895 Stanford Quad, and
was written by one Winifred Har
per. Chalk it up to a little Big
Game nostalgia.

People wonder why it was a tie.
Some lay it to the Fates, others
to the Stanford coach or the
Berkeley mascot; the true story
has never yet been told.
Olive Vincey was visiting Stan
ford. She was a tall, supple girl,
with hair like burnished gold and
eyes of a peculiar, variable blue.
With her dazzling white skin and
queenly figure, she seemed a
statue animated by divine fire.
Miss Vincey was versatile, bril
liant, intense, though not without
the melancholy common to youth
ful reformers, who despair of a
wicked and refractory world. She

was used to the homage of men:
that nine-tenths of her masculine
acquaintances should fall in love
with her seemed natural a sort
of requital to her for the task of
existing.
Though the Stanford youth all
adored her (despite her enthusi
astic loyalty to Berkeley), her fa
vorite was Harold Sommerville, a
senior in biology, hitherto consid
ered unsusceptible, except to the
wooing of science. He was a tall,
dark, athletic young fellow,
adored by girls, respected by his
professor, and admired by all as
the champion football player of
the Coast.
Into his love for Olive he threw
the strength and fervor hitherto
expended upon football and
fishes. From roseate dreams of
the future he awoke to the sweeter
reality of a woman "a creature
half human, half divine"
lovelier than a dream of fame and
more fascinating than science.

They had flirted at Coronado
if flirting be strolling seaward
discussing Browning, ranging
from Darwin to dress reform, yet
feeling an undercurrent of har
mony, which a few congenial souls
know. But that was during the
summer, and now college
life, with its exciting _

them.
As Harold
stands by a
variegated
flowerbed in
the Quadrangle,
this day before
Thanksgiving,
he is a complete
stranger to her
heart. Olive's
mocking eyes are
on a geranium in
her hand.
The fact that Stan
ford's most popular man has just

declared his love seems not to dis
concert her in the least. Throwing
down the red geranium, she picks
two blue and yellow blossoms. "I
came near deserting
my colors."

she murmurs.
"Don't be flippant,
dear," he says; "answer my ques
tion." A mischievious sparkle

flashes from her eyes. "Prove your
love," she challenges: "I am yours,

if Berkeley wins tomorrow."
