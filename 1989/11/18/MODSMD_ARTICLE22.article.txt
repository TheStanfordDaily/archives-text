# A 						tie? But why? Find what was true buck in 1892

Editor's note: The following story
is a dramatization of the events
surrounding the 1892 Big Game
tie between Stanford and Califor
nia. It was originally published
in the 1895 Stanford Quad, and
was written by one Winifred Har
per. Chalk it up to a little Big
Game nostalgia.

People wonder why it was a tie.
Some lay it to the Fates, others
to the Stanford coach or the
Berkeley mascot; the true story
has never yet been told.
Olive Vincey was visiting Stan
ford. She was a tall, supple girl,
with hair like burnished gold and
eyes of a peculiar, variable blue.
With her dazzling white skin and
queenly figure, she seemed a
statue animated by divine fire.
Miss Vincey was versatile, bril
liant, intense, though not without
the melancholy common to youth
ful reformers, who despair of a
wicked and refractory world. She

was used to the homage of men:
that nine-tenths of her masculine
acquaintances should fall in love
with her seemed natural a sort
of requital to her for the task of
existing.
Though the Stanford youth all
adored her (despite her enthusi
astic loyalty to Berkeley), her fa
vorite was Harold Sommerville, a
senior in biology, hitherto consid
ered unsusceptible, except to the
wooing of science. He was a tall,
dark, athletic young fellow,
adored by girls, respected by his
professor, and admired by all as
the champion football player of
the Coast.
Into his love for Olive he threw
the strength and fervor hitherto
expended upon football and
fishes. From roseate dreams of
the future he awoke to the sweeter
reality of a woman "a creature
half human, half divine"
lovelier than a dream of fame and
more fascinating than science.

They had flirted at Coronado
if flirting be strolling seaward
discussing Browning, ranging
from Darwin to dress reform, yet
feeling an undercurrent of har
mony, which a few congenial souls
know. But that was during the
summer, and now college
life, with its exciting _
demands,
claims
them.
As Harold
stands by a
variegated
flowerbed in
the Quadrangle,
this day before
Thanksgiving,
he is a complete
stranger to her
heart. Olive's
mocking eyes are
on a geranium in
her hand.
The fact that Stan
ford's most popular man has just

declared his love seems not to dis
concert her in the least. Throwing
down the red geranium, she picks
two blue and yellow blossoms. "I
came near deserting
my colors."

she murmurs.
"Don't be flippant,
dear," he says; "answer my ques
tion." A mischievious sparkle

flashes from her eyes. "Prove your
love," she challenges: "I am yours,

if Berkeley wins tomorrow."
The championship game was to

be the next day, and upon Som
merville chiefly depended Stan
ford's victory. Yesterday, he would
have staked his life that his col
lege might win; today, he knew
that his happiness depended on
Stanford's losing.
Hamlet's struggles seemed
puerile compared to his. All night
his pride and honor struggled with
his love. He saw himself borne
upon the boys' shoulders, victori
ous, as Olive's fair face faded away
into cloud-wreaths and disap
peared. Again, he was the happy
recipient of her beaming smiles,
while his Alma Mater cast him
out-of-doors in disgrace.

Though the heavens poured

forth rainy invectives against
football, the ampitheater was
filled with a mass of moving car
dinal, blue and yellow, resembling
a titanic crazy quilt, agitated by
voluble pigmies.
Then began the game. Twenty
two mothers' darlings rushed into
the arena, in padded trousers,
false noses, and disordered hair,
to begin their task of mutual
mutilation.
Never was such playing seen
before. The men fought like tigers
for every inch, while Sommerville,
with compressed lips and pallid
face, played magnificently. It was
Stanford luck against Berkeley
pluck. The "UC's" were ahead.
Time was flying. The Stanfords,
within a few feet of the goal, were
forced back by sheer strength.
Suddenly, with head down, Som
merville dashed through the line,

striking men away with sledge
hammer blows. A Berkeleyan had
flung himself upon him, but with
one superhuman effort he
plunged on and made a touch
down.

The score was 16 to 16. The
crowd rose en masse, and screams,
hurrahs and blasts from horns
rent the air. Cardinal flashed. One
callow youth slapped his neighbor
upon the shoulder, crying, "Hur
rah for Stanford," and never knew
it was the President of Berkeley.
Soon the crowd was hushed,
and every breath held to see the
goal kicked. As Sommerville
prepared to win the two points
which would mean victory for his
college, and defeat for his love,
he cast at Olive one despairing

glance.
At first, Olive's pride had been
sorely hurt at Harold's open

defiance, but gradually admira
tion overcame vanity, and she felt
ashamed of her foolish cruelty. As
he looked appealingly at her, she
leaned forward eagerly, with
parted lips and sparkling eyes,
and waved her flowers excitedly
as a sign of encouragement. Alas,
they were gold and blue!
"She flaunts her colors," he
thought bitterly and summoned
all his force for one supreme effort
to save his University. But the
long mental and physical strain
told upon his nerves; at the cri
tical moment, they failed him; he
missed the goal and time was
called.

Christmas came. Olive was
again visiting Stanford. She had
not seen Harold since the game,
but felt that he must despise her.
He had secluded himself in des

peration. However, he determined
to make one last appeal to her.
"It was upon the condition that
Stanford lost," she insisted. "But
Berkeley did not lose," declared
he, "it was a tie." Then he mur
mured something about a ten
derer tie between Berkeley and
Stanford and other things,
which need not be chronicled.

Olive ignominously struck her
colors lowered them to the
height of a man's shoulder. In
hair, eyes and cheeks, the tints of
the two Universities were har
moniously blended.
And as her proud head rested
against his heart, its rhythmic
throbbing sounded something like
this:
Rah, rah, rah,
Rah, rah, rah,
Rah, rah,
Stanford!

upon the shoulder, crying, "Hur
rah for Stanford," and never knew
it was the President of Berkeley.
Soon the crowd was hushed,
and every breath held to see the
goal kicked. As Sommerville
prepared to win the two points
which would mean victory for his
college, and defeat for his love,
he cast at Olive one despairing

glance.
At first, Olive's pride had been
sorely hurt at Harold's open

defiance, but gradually admira
tion overcame vanity, and she felt
ashamed of her foolish cruelty. As
he looked appealingly at her, she
leaned forward eagerly, with
parted lips and sparkling eyes,
and waved her flowers excitedly
as a sign of encouragement. Alas,
they were gold and blue!
"She flaunts her colors," he
thought bitterly and summoned
all his force for one supreme effort
to save his University. But the
long mental and physical strain
told upon his nerves; at the cri
tical moment, they failed him; he
missed the goal and time was
called.

Christmas came. Olive was
again visiting Stanford. She had
not seen Harold since the game,
but felt that he must despise her.
He had secluded himself in des

peration. However, he determined
to make one last appeal to her.
"It was upon the condition that
Stanford lost," she insisted. "But
Berkeley did not lose," declared
he, "it was a tie." Then he mur
mured something about a ten
derer tie between Berkeley and
Stanford and other things,
which need not be chronicled.

Olive ignominously struck her
colors lowered them to the
height of a man's shoulder. In
hair, eyes and cheeks, the tints of
the two Universities were har
moniously blended.
And as her proud head rested
against his heart, its rhythmic
throbbing sounded something like
this:
Rah, rah, rah,
Rah, rah, rah,
Rah, rah,
Stanford!
Editor's note: The following story
is a dramatization of the events
surrounding the 1892 Big Game
tie between Stanford and Califor
nia. It was originally published
in the 1895 Stanford Quad, and
was written by one Winifred Har
per. Chalk it up to a little Big
Game nostalgia.

People wonder why it was a tie.
Some lay it to the Fates, others
to the Stanford coach or the
Berkeley mascot; the true story
has never yet been told.
Olive Vincey was visiting Stan
ford. She was a tall, supple girl,
with hair like burnished gold and
eyes of a peculiar, variable blue.
With her dazzling white skin and
queenly figure, she seemed a
statue animated by divine fire.
Miss Vincey was versatile, bril
liant, intense, though not without
the melancholy common to youth
ful reformers, who despair of a
wicked and refractory world. She

was used to the homage of men:
that nine-tenths of her masculine
acquaintances should fall in love
with her seemed natural a sort
of requital to her for the task of
existing.
Though the Stanford youth all
adored her (despite her enthusi
astic loyalty to Berkeley), her fa
vorite was Harold Sommerville, a
senior in biology, hitherto consid
ered unsusceptible, except to the
wooing of science. He was a tall,
dark, athletic young fellow,
adored by girls, respected by his
professor, and admired by all as
the champion football player of
the Coast.
Into his love for Olive he threw
the strength and fervor hitherto
expended upon football and
fishes. From roseate dreams of
the future he awoke to the sweeter
reality of a woman "a creature
half human, half divine"
lovelier than a dream of fame and
more fascinating than science.

They had flirted at Coronado
if flirting be strolling seaward
discussing Browning, ranging
from Darwin to dress reform, yet
feeling an undercurrent of har
mony, which a few congenial souls
know. But that was during the
summer, and now college
life, with its exciting _
demands,
claims
them.
As Harold
stands by a
variegated
flowerbed in
the Quadrangle,
this day before
Thanksgiving,
he is a complete
stranger to her
heart. Olive's
mocking eyes are
on a geranium in
her hand.
The fact that Stan
ford's most popular man has just

declared his love seems not to dis
concert her in the least. Throwing
down the red geranium, she picks
two blue and yellow blossoms. "I
came near deserting
my colors."

she murmurs.
"Don't be flippant,
dear," he says; "answer my ques
tion." A mischievious sparkle

flashes from her eyes. "Prove your
love," she challenges: "I am yours,

if Berkeley wins tomorrow."
The championship game was to

be the next day, and upon Som
merville chiefly depended Stan
ford's victory. Yesterday, he would
have staked his life that his col
lege might win; today, he knew
that his happiness depended on
Stanford's losing.
Hamlet's struggles seemed
puerile compared to his. All night
his pride and honor struggled with
his love. He saw himself borne
upon the boys' shoulders, victori
ous, as Olive's fair face faded away
into cloud-wreaths and disap
peared. Again, he was the happy
recipient of her beaming smiles,
while his Alma Mater cast him
out-of-doors in disgrace.

Though the heavens poured

forth rainy invectives against
football, the ampitheater was
filled with a mass of moving car
dinal, blue and yellow, resembling
a titanic crazy quilt, agitated by
voluble pigmies.
Then began the game. Twenty
two mothers' darlings rushed into
the arena, in padded trousers,
false noses, and disordered hair,
to begin their task of mutual
mutilation.
Never was such playing seen
before. The men fought like tigers
for every inch, while Sommerville,
with compressed lips and pallid
face, played magnificently. It was
Stanford luck against Berkeley
pluck. The "UC's" were ahead.
Time was flying. The Stanfords,
within a few feet of the goal, were
forced back by sheer strength.
Suddenly, with head down, Som
merville dashed through the line,

striking men away with sledge
hammer blows. A Berkeleyan had
flung himself upon him, but with
one superhuman effort he
plunged on and made a touch
down.

The score was 16 to 16. The
crowd rose en masse, and screams,
hurrahs and blasts from horns
rent the air. Cardinal flashed. One
callow youth slapped his neighbor
upon the shoulder, crying, "Hur
rah for Stanford," and never knew
it was the President of Berkeley.
