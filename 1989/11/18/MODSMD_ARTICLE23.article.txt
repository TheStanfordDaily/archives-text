# For 90 years, the Axe has symbolized the rivalry

A sharp piece of metal suitable
for cutting wood, rendered virtu
ally useless by its lack of a handle.
An object of jealousy, thievery,
competition, bloodlust. A symbol
of one of the longest-standing and
richest rivalries in collegiate ath
letics. The spoils of the Big Game.
The Axe.
Now it is mounted neatly on
polished mahogony, its 14-inch
blade shined and clean. Below it
is a plaque bearing the scores of
past Big Games. Its heading
reads, "The Stanford Axe
Forged March 1899. Captured by
California April 15, 1899. Recap
tured by Stanford April 3, 1930.
To be awarded annually to the
winner of the Big Game."
It is a simple inscription,
belying the coveted weapon's
tumultuous past. The sharp edge
of passion surrounding the Axe
seems to have been dulled in
recent years, perhaps because its
transfer from school to school is
so orderly now, an inexorable
function of the result of the Big
Game.
But in days of old, the Axe was
more of a mascot than a trophy,
and its possessor could hold on to
it as long as it liked, unless the
enemy stole it away. Back then,
the history of the blade was, as
a 1947 Daily headline read,
"replete with raids, blood, tri
umph, dull despair."
But before that, before there
was ever an Axe, there was an
Axe yell.
By the mid-1890s, shortly after
the opening of Stanford, the nat
ural geographic rivalry between
the nascent school in Palo Alto
and its more established cross-
Bay neighbor had begun to heat
up.
The Axe yell, growing out of
this budding rivalry, came from
somewhere in the imagination of
Will Irwin and Chris Bradley,

Stanford Class of '9B. Just why
the two chose an axe as Stanford's
figurative instrument of spleen
venting is unclear. In his book
titled "The Stanford Axe," R.G.
O'Neil posited this theory:

"The axe was the most terrible
of weapons. Even as an instru
ment of domestic utility, we think
of the axe not as the great boon
to the pioneers of old who forced
back our frontiers ... but rather
as the means for stopping the
squawks of excited chickens by
one clean blow which severed the
head and covered the ground with
spurting blood.

"And the stark naked truth of
the matter is simply this: the axe
is the symbol which most ac
curately describes the subcon
scious feelings of those loyal to
Stanford and California" toward
the opposing school.
And Will Irwin, according to
O'Neil, "put his finger unerringly
on this feeling, and came through
with the famous yell," which goes
as follows:

"Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the
Axe!

Give 'em the Axe, the Axe, the Axe!
Give 'em the Axe, give 'em the
Axe, give 'em the Axe!

Where?
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, the neck, the
neck!
Right in the neck, right in the
neck, right in the neck!
There!"

The Axe yell was born in 1896,
but some observers, including Ar
chie Cloud in his book "The Stan
ford Axe," have noted that the
cadence of the yell imitates the
rhythm of the chorus in the At
henian comedy "The Frogs,"
penned by Aristophanes some

2000 years earlier.

Whether or not its creation was
the result of some Western Cul
ture plagiarism, the Axe yell was
initially the sole possession of
Stanford rooters (and probably a
tad tiresome to the Berkeley faith
ful).
It was not until 1899 that
anyone had the idea of a real axe
to accompany the Axe yell. And
even then, it was only because the
Stanford baseball team was in a
crisis.

The long-time symbol of the Big Game rivalry, The Axe, has almost as interesting a history as the game itself.
