# In a topsy-turvy year, USC well ahead of the Pac
## 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
The Washington State Cougars
(two bowl wins this century) won
five of their first six games. Bar
ring an upset today, the UCLA
Bruins (seven consecutive bowl
victories) will finish the season
losers of their final six. It was
that kind of year in the Pacific
10 conference.

Heading into the final weekend
of play, the , only thing not
anomolous about the Pac-10' this
year is USC winning their third
consecutive conference title.
Going into this weekend, five
teams still have a shot at seven
wins and second place and three
teams are looking to prevent a
bottom-dwelling finish.
The Bruins are one of those
latter three teams, and the surest
bet of the group to end the season
with a loss. They face the No. 8-
ranked Trojans, who are trying
to complete their second consecu
tive campaign without a confer
ence defeat.

At the risk of being repetitious,
let's examine that unfathomable
concept one more time. The
UCLA Bruins are likely to finish
last in the Pac-10.
Sure, Washington State's fast
start was surprising. California's
late-season surge, including a vic
tory over top 20-team Arizona,
was interesting. Arizona State, 6-
3-1 and bidding for a bowl, was
unexpected.
But UCLA going 3-8? That's
downright scary. Compounding
the disbelief this presents, con
sider the fact that after five games
this year the Bruins were tied for
the Pac-10 lead with USC at 2-0.
Then they lost five straight, the
first time this ignominious feat
had happened in one season since
1943.

And the meek shall inherit the
earth. In order, the Bruins were
crushed by Arizona, nipped by

OSU and Washington, worn down
by Stanford and plain beaten by
Oregon. UCLA saw their chances
to extend their NCAA record for
bowl wins smashed to smith
ereens in five gut-wrenching
weeks.

The Huskies, the Cougars, the
Ducks, the Sun Devils, and the
Wildcats all are looking for that
magical seventh win to close the
year. These teams are hoping such
a victory would put an early
Christmas card in their mailbox
from some bowl committee. Two
are guaranteed success, as intras
tate rivalries pit UW and WSU in
Seattle, and U of A against ASU
next week in Tempe.
Oregon State will try to knock
off the Ducks and prevent their
rivals from going to a bowl for
the first time since 1963. USC
and UCLA and The Big Game at
Stanford are strictly for pride and
bragging rights.
The Trojans and the Bruins
seemed to be fairly even coming
into the year. Both had lost their
big-name quaterback of last
season to the pros, Rodney Peete
moving on to the Detroit Lions
and Troy Aikman going to Dallas.
To replace the irreplaceable, both
brought in highly-touted redshirt
freshmen to start at the position.
No matter what happens today,
there is no doubt the Trojans'
Todd Marinovich has won the bat
tle. He and UCLA's Bret Johnson,
who had battled for the headlines
in Southern California while in
high school, have seen their for
tunes head in opposite directions
this fall.

Marinovich has proved himself
a clutch player time and time
again, while Johnson faltered
when the pressure was on. While
UCLA was losing five consecutive
conference games, USC was ex
tending its conference win streak
to 19 games.

But the difference has been on
the other side of the ball, where
the Trojans are tops in the league
in total defense. They are giving
up an average of only 63 yards a
game on the ground (42 yards
better than the No. 2 team), and
are second in pass defense as well.
Teams are averaging 11 points a
game this year against the
Trojans, which is the low for the
Pac-10.

With USC on its way to their
record-setting 27th Rose Bowl
and UCLA home for the holidays,
the Pac-10 may get only three
bowl teams out of 1989. The Free

dom Bowl has said they will take
the winner of the Apple Cup be
tween the Huskies and the
Cougars, and the Copper Bowl has
indicated they will extend a bid
to Arizona regardless of next
weekend's outcome.

This could leave two good teams
scrambling for anything they can
get. Oregon could have assured
themselves a bowl with an 8-3
record, but the marquee value of
the Ducks may be too low for a
bid at 7-4. Arizona State, with
two big wins recently, could knock
off the reeling Wildcats and still
not go to a bowl at 7-3-1.

"As time goes on, things do not
look too good for ASU and
Oregon," said Troy Hansen, from
the Pac-10 public relations office.
Stanford's last-second field goal
that beat the Ducks in the fourth
week of the season may be coming
back to haunt them, as is a big
fourth-quarter lead squandered
recently against Brigham Young.
But they still must beat the
Beavers in the so-called Civil War
today. OSU, 3-3-1 in conference
games, beat the Ducks for the
first time since 1974 last year and
hopes to finish above .500 in the
league.

While there have been a lot of surprises in the Pac-10 this season, USC's defense has been a
constant, leading the league in fewest yards allowed by a large margin.
