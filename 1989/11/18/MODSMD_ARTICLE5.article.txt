# Stranger has occured in Big Game history

Going into today's showdown,
the California Golden Bears are
4-6 and the Stanford Cardinal is
2-8. Those are the records now
forget them. Instead, imagine
both teams at 10-0, with the win
ner going to the Rose Bowl to
play for the national champion
ship.
If you can do this, you have
some idea of the magnitude of
Big Game.
The quarterbacks to go today
are Cal's Troy Taylor and Stan
ford's Steve Smith. Taylor has
been on fire the last two weeks,
directing his team to conference
victories over Arizona and Wash
ington State. Smith has never
won a game as the Cardinal
starter, going 0-for-7 this season.
You can forget those numbers
as well.
If history tells us anything at
all, it is that this storied rivalry
defies the odds, subverts the sta
tistics and ignores all logic.
Nobody on earth knows who will
win this football game, and even
the Pigskin God himself may been
in suspense over the outcome.
That is what makes Big Game so
special.
Today at Stanford Stadium,
nine Cardinal and 16 Golden Bear
seniors will play football as if their
lives depended on it. In away,
their lives do depend on it. The
memories of this game will
resonate in them for the rest of
their days.
That the game is at Stanford
may mean something. The visit
ing team has not won Big Game
since 1984, when Stanford Coach
Jack Elway experienced his first
Big Game. The Cardinal beat Cal
at Memorial Stadium that year,
which bodes well for Denny Green,

who enters his first Big Game as
head coach today.
However, Green is by no means
a stranger to Big Game hoopla
and phenomena. As an assistant
at Stanford, Green had a taste of
victory two consecutive years un
der Bill Walsh. But the third Big
Game was not a charm for Green,
as the Cardinal was upset by Cal
when he returned to the Farm
under Paul Wiggin in 1980.
It has been a rough year for
both teams. Stanford has experi
enced a multitude of devastating
injuries (Jon Volpe, Rob Hinckley)
and some narrow losses (Utah,
Notre Dame, ASU). Cal has gone
through ups and downs at quar
terback and didn't win a confer
ence game until November.
The Bears do have the momen
tum, but consider two factors: Cal
has not won on the road, confer
ence or non-conference, this year;
and Stanford is 2-0 in the Pacific
10 Conference at home. Those two
wins came against schools that
beat the Bears this year by a com
bined score of 59-25.
Stanford and Cal will finally
have a chance to wipe the sour
taste out of their mouths that
lingers from last year's "kissing
your sister" 19- 19 tie. Stanford
kept the Axe, but needed a last
second blocked field goal by Tuan
Van Le to do it. The Cardinal
offense did not play well. The
Golden Bears felt cheated out of
a thrilling victory.
Because of that result, the se
ries between the teams is dead
locked at 4-4-1 for the 1980s. It
has been a remarkable decade for
Big Game dramatics, including
1982's infamous "The Play,"
1986's improbable upset by Cal
of Stanford's Gator Bowl squad,
and last year's finish. It is some
