# Stranger has occured in Big Game history
## 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
Going into today's showdown,
the California Golden Bears are
4-6 and the Stanford Cardinal is
2-8. Those are the records now
forget them. Instead, imagine
both teams at 10-0, with the win
ner going to the Rose Bowl to
play for the national champion
ship.
If you can do this, you have
some idea of the magnitude of
Big Game.
The quarterbacks to go today
are Cal's Troy Taylor and Stan
ford's Steve Smith. Taylor has
been on fire the last two weeks,
directing his team to conference
victories over Arizona and Wash
ington State. Smith has never
won a game as the Cardinal
starter, going 0-for-7 this season.
You can forget those numbers
as well.
If history tells us anything at
all, it is that this storied rivalry
defies the odds, subverts the sta
tistics and ignores all logic.
Nobody on earth knows who will
win this football game, and even
the Pigskin God himself may been
in suspense over the outcome.
That is what makes Big Game so
special.
Today at Stanford Stadium,
nine Cardinal and 16 Golden Bear
seniors will play football as if their
lives depended on it. In away,
their lives do depend on it. The
memories of this game will
resonate in them for the rest of
their days.
That the game is at Stanford
may mean something. The visit
ing team has not won Big Game
since 1984, when Stanford Coach
Jack Elway experienced his first
Big Game. The Cardinal beat Cal
at Memorial Stadium that year,
which bodes well for Denny Green,

who enters his first Big Game as
head coach today.
However, Green is by no means
a stranger to Big Game hoopla
and phenomena. As an assistant
at Stanford, Green had a taste of
victory two consecutive years un
der Bill Walsh. But the third Big
Game was not a charm for Green,
as the Cardinal was upset by Cal
when he returned to the Farm
under Paul Wiggin in 1980.
It has been a rough year for
both teams. Stanford has experi
enced a multitude of devastating
injuries (Jon Volpe, Rob Hinckley)
and some narrow losses (Utah,
Notre Dame, ASU). Cal has gone
through ups and downs at quar
terback and didn't win a confer
ence game until November.
The Bears do have the momen
tum, but consider two factors: Cal
has not won on the road, confer
ence or non-conference, this year;
and Stanford is 2-0 in the Pacific
10 Conference at home. Those two
wins came against schools that
beat the Bears this year by a com
bined score of 59-25.
Stanford and Cal will finally
have a chance to wipe the sour
taste out of their mouths that
lingers from last year's "kissing
your sister" 19- 19 tie. Stanford
kept the Axe, but needed a last
second blocked field goal by Tuan
Van Le to do it. The Cardinal
offense did not play well. The
Golden Bears felt cheated out of
a thrilling victory.
Because of that result, the se
ries between the teams is dead
locked at 4-4-1 for the 1980s. It
has been a remarkable decade for
Big Game dramatics, including
1982's infamous "The Play,"
1986's improbable upset by Cal
of Stanford's Gator Bowl squad,
and last year's finish. It is some
how very fitting that this year's
contest be the rubber match.
Stanford plans to run, and run,
and run some more on California,
which ranks last in the Pac-10
against the ground game. Jay Jay
Lasley and Scott Eschelman will
be the weapons of choice for
Green. Once the Cardinal estab
lishes the running game, look for
Smith to open up the passing at
tack to wide receivers Ed McCaf
frey and Jon Pinckney.
Pinckney has come on in the
late season, catching four TDs in
the last four contests. Last week,
Stanford quarterback Brian
Johnson hit Pinckney with scor
ing tosses of 83 (third-longest in

team history) and 41 yards. On
the day, the sophomore wideout
caught six balls for 142 yards.
The man the Cardinal will try
to steer clear of is Golden Bear
senior linebacker David Ortega,
who set a Cal record for career
tackles last week. Ortega will start
his 41st consecutive game, with
the legacy of 10 or more tackles
in 34 of his previous 40 games.
Cornerback Doug Parrish will
back up Ortega with his four in
terceptions this year, good for an
eighth-place tie in the league.
It is not secret how Cal will try

to move the ball on Stanford today
call it "Air Taylor." The senior
QB will exit his college career with
guns blazing, and the last two
weeks his shots have been finding
the mark. In the two upsets,
Taylor threw for 740 yards and
four touchdowns, completing an
astounding 69 percent of his
passes.
For his prolific efforts in these
games, Taylor was name Pac-10
Player of the Week twice. The
only other offensive player to win
the award twice this year was
USC's Todd Marinovich, who

likewise won two consecutive
awards earlier this season.
Another great quarterback who
participated in the Big Game tra
dition will be watching Taylor
with interest today. Cardinal Heis
man Trophy-winner Jim Plunkett
could see the man in blue and
gold eclipse him in two statistical
categories this afternoon, career
passing and career total offense
in the Pac-10 (Pac-8 in Plunkett's
day).
Taylor should have no trouble
with the former, needing only 60
yards through the air on the day.

If he plays like he has recently,
he could even net the 340 yards
required to pass Plunkett in the
latter category.
The job of stopping Taylor falls
to the Stanford secondary, led by
seniors Alan Grant and Rob
Englehardt. The Cardinal is cur
rently eighth in the Pac-10 in pass
ing defense, after surrendering
296 yards to Sun Devil quarter
back Paul Justin last weekend.

to the Stanford secondary, led by
seniors Alan Grant and Rob
Englehardt. The Cardinal is cur

back Paul Justin last weekend.
Big Game. As Tuan Van Le
showed us a year ago, anything
can happen.
Going into today's showdown,
the California Golden Bears are
4-6 and the Stanford Cardinal is
2-8. Those are the records now
forget them. Instead, imagine
both teams at 10-0, with the win
ner going to the Rose Bowl to
play for the national champion
ship.
If you can do this, you have
some idea of the magnitude of
Big Game.
The quarterbacks to go today
are Cal's Troy Taylor and Stan
ford's Steve Smith. Taylor has
been on fire the last two weeks,
directing his team to conference
victories over Arizona and Wash
ington State. Smith has never
won a game as the Cardinal
starter, going 0-for-7 this season.
You can forget those numbers
as well.
If history tells us anything at
all, it is that this storied rivalry
defies the odds, subverts the sta
tistics and ignores all logic.
Nobody on earth knows who will
win this football game, and even
the Pigskin God himself may been
in suspense over the outcome.
That is what makes Big Game so
special.
Today at Stanford Stadium,
nine Cardinal and 16 Golden Bear
seniors will play football as if their
lives depended on it. In away,
their lives do depend on it. The
memories of this game will
resonate in them for the rest of
their days.
That the game is at Stanford
may mean something. The visit
ing team has not won Big Game
since 1984, when Stanford Coach
Jack Elway experienced his first
Big Game. The Cardinal beat Cal
at Memorial Stadium that year,
which bodes well for Denny Green,

who enters his first Big Game as
head coach today.
However, Green is by no means
a stranger to Big Game hoopla
and phenomena. As an assistant
at Stanford, Green had a taste of
victory two consecutive years un
der Bill Walsh. But the third Big
Game was not a charm for Green,
as the Cardinal was upset by Cal
when he returned to the Farm
under Paul Wiggin in 1980.
It has been a rough year for
both teams. Stanford has experi
enced a multitude of devastating
injuries (Jon Volpe, Rob Hinckley)
and some narrow losses (Utah,
Notre Dame, ASU). Cal has gone
through ups and downs at quar
terback and didn't win a confer
ence game until November.
The Bears do have the momen
tum, but consider two factors: Cal
has not won on the road, confer
ence or non-conference, this year;
and Stanford is 2-0 in the Pacific
10 Conference at home. Those two
wins came against schools that
beat the Bears this year by a com
bined score of 59-25.
Stanford and Cal will finally
have a chance to wipe the sour
taste out of their mouths that
lingers from last year's "kissing
your sister" 19- 19 tie. Stanford
kept the Axe, but needed a last
second blocked field goal by Tuan
Van Le to do it. The Cardinal
offense did not play well. The
Golden Bears felt cheated out of
a thrilling victory.
Because of that result, the se
ries between the teams is dead
locked at 4-4-1 for the 1980s. It
has been a remarkable decade for
Big Game dramatics, including
1982's infamous "The Play,"
1986's improbable upset by Cal
of Stanford's Gator Bowl squad,
and last year's finish. It is some
how very fitting that this year's
contest be the rubber match.
Stanford plans to run, and run,
and run some more on California,
which ranks last in the Pac-10
against the ground game. Jay Jay
Lasley and Scott Eschelman will
be the weapons of choice for
Green. Once the Cardinal estab
lishes the running game, look for
Smith to open up the passing at
tack to wide receivers Ed McCaf
frey and Jon Pinckney.
Pinckney has come on in the
late season, catching four TDs in
the last four contests. Last week,
Stanford quarterback Brian
Johnson hit Pinckney with scor
ing tosses of 83 (third-longest in

team history) and 41 yards. On
the day, the sophomore wideout
caught six balls for 142 yards.
The man the Cardinal will try
to steer clear of is Golden Bear
senior linebacker David Ortega,
who set a Cal record for career
tackles last week. Ortega will start
his 41st consecutive game, with
the legacy of 10 or more tackles
in 34 of his previous 40 games.
Cornerback Doug Parrish will
back up Ortega with his four in
terceptions this year, good for an
eighth-place tie in the league.
It is not secret how Cal will try

to move the ball on Stanford today
call it "Air Taylor." The senior
QB will exit his college career with
guns blazing, and the last two
weeks his shots have been finding
the mark. In the two upsets,
Taylor threw for 740 yards and
four touchdowns, completing an
astounding 69 percent of his
passes.
For his prolific efforts in these
games, Taylor was name Pac-10
Player of the Week twice. The
only other offensive player to win
the award twice this year was
USC's Todd Marinovich, who

likewise won two consecutive
awards earlier this season.
Another great quarterback who
participated in the Big Game tra
dition will be watching Taylor
with interest today. Cardinal Heis
man Trophy-winner Jim Plunkett
could see the man in blue and
gold eclipse him in two statistical
categories this afternoon, career
passing and career total offense
in the Pac-10 (Pac-8 in Plunkett's
day).
Taylor should have no trouble
with the former, needing only 60
yards through the air on the day.

If he plays like he has recently,
he could even net the 340 yards
required to pass Plunkett in the
latter category.
The job of stopping Taylor falls
to the Stanford secondary, led by
seniors Alan Grant and Rob
Englehardt. The Cardinal is cur
rently eighth in the Pac-10 in pass
ing defense, after surrendering
