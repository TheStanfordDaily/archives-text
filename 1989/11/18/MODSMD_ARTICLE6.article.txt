# When 'Big' wasn't just talk

In the Garden, Adam was
troubled. God sent his angel, Rap
hael, to ease his mind.
"What troubles you, Sire of
Man 1 ?" asked Raphael.
"It's Big Game," said Adam,
fit doesn't have any luster. Cal is
4-6, Stanford is 2-8. Last year, it
was the same story. Why is it so
meaningless?"
"My son," said Raphael, "Big
Game has a meaning that
transcends all records. It is on
another level. Any loyal fan will
tell you that both the Golden Bears
and the Cardinal play two seasons
each year the first 10 games,
and Big Game."
"I know all of the tradition
stuff, and the bizarre Play in
1982," said the Progenitor. "But
what about bowl games, and win
ning records, and national TV?
Why doesn't Big Game have any
of that?"
To which Raphael replied, "Ah,
but this was not always so. Rest
awhile, and I will tell thee of great
battles before thy time when Big
Game really was Big."
Many will remember 1986 as
the last year that the Stanford
football team went to a bowl game,
or had a winning record. It was
also the last year Big Game could
qualify as Big outside the Bay
Area.
Stanford was 7-2, its best record
at that point in the season since
1971, a Rose Bowl year. The Car
dinal was on a high after upset
ting the favored UCLA Bruins on,
the road the previous week, 28-23.
Jack Elway's squad had an invi
tation to the Gator Bowl already
tucked in its proverbial back
pocket.
California's program, on the
other hand, was in turmoil. Coach
Joe Kapp had been warring with
the media all year, and had been

told he would be replaced at
season's end. His players
responded like a team without
faith in its coaches, building an
eight-game losing streak heading
into Big Game.
Despite playing in Berkeley,
Stanford and its fans were confi
dent. They had the Axe, a much
better team, and the possibity of
a 10-win season to motivate them.
Everyone, including the Gator
Bowl officials that extended the
invitation knowing the Cardinal
had two games left on its
schedule, was expecting a blowout
by the men of the Peninsula.
But the Almighty would not
smile on the Stanford Red, and
the Blue and Gold pulled off the
stunning upset, 17-11.
Troy Taylor, the Cal senior
quarterback who will make his
final collegiate start tbday, was
the Golden Bear starter that year.
But against USC the week before
Big Game, Taylor broke his jaw
and was not able to go against
Stanford. He would, however,
have a role to play.
Kapp went with second-stringer
Kevin Brown, who threw for 221
yards on the Cardinal in his first
full game of the season. The win
ning margin came on a 47-yard
reverse play by Mike Ford
which Taylor called from the press
box.
Going back a little more, there
was the 1980 Big Game, in which
a bowl invitation did ride on the
outcome of the contest. The Car
dinal, 6-4 going into the final
game, needed a road win against
the Bears to go to the Peach Bowl.
Led by sophomore quarterback
John Elway and junior Darrin
Nelson, Stanford had the horses.
Cal, losers of four straight in
cluding a 60-7 shellacking at the
hands of USC, had the Axe and
a bowl ring from the previous
season (the now defunct Garden
State Bowl). But at 2-8, the Bears
were looking to be spoilers this
season.
They did just that, corralling
young Elway and the Cardinal,
28-23. Twice Stanford fumbled in
side the five-yard line, and Cal's
John Tuggle became the first
Bear to gain 100 yards in a game
all year with 110 yards by land.
Miami, three years away from
their first national championship,
went to the Peach instead.
As one Stanford Daily colum
nist put it the following Monday,
"What happened this weekend
was that the Big Game turned

into what no one thought it would
be a big game."
It would seem that through the
years California has been more of
a spoiler than a contender. Fur
ther back, there are unbelievable
tales of Cal vanquishing Stanford
when the Cardinal was the Rose
Bowl victor that are very well
known upsets in the lore of all
college football.
Ask any Big Game fan what
the year 1982 evokes, and the im
mediate answer is "The Play." But
what the memory of that other
worldly finish tends to block out
is that Big Game was big that
year too. Cal was 6-4 going in,
Stanford even at 5-5.

Despite the Bears' superior
record, the Cardinal apparently
impressed scouts more. If Stan
ford had won, as many Cardinal
fans still claim they did, senior

John Elway would have finally
made it to a bowl game. When
Mark Harmon kicked the go
ahead field goal with :04 on the
clock, the Hall of Fame Bowl rep
resentative shook hands with
Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger.
But after The Play transpired,
Elway's 330 yards of passing
ended up for nought. This time
it was Cal who wound up with
the better record (7-4), but the
role of spoiler remained. "The
gentleman from the Hall of Fame
Bowl said goodbye," Geiger said
afterwards.

There are other Big Big Game
upsets, mostly won by the Bears.
Through the millenia, Stanford
has had less of a chance to spoil
California's season simply because
the Bears' season was often al
ready spoiled much earlier. Con

sequently, this account may leave
you wondering if Stanford actu
ally ever won Big Game when it
was Big.
The Biggest Big Game of them
all may have been in 1977. Stan
ford, led by freshman phenome
non Nelson and seniors Guy
Benjamin and James Lofton, was
a powerhouse with a 7-3 record.
The Bears matched this with an
equally imposing 8-2 mark. Either
team would be likely to receive a
bowl bid upon winning.
In the friendly confines of Stan
ford Stadium, the Cardinal proved
who wanted it more. Benjamin
had called a team meeting before
practice on Wednesday before the
game to correct a lack of enthu
siasm. On Saturday, the Cardinal
beat the Bears easily, 21-3.
In addition to nailing down a
Sun Bowl bid, there were some

individual performances of note
in this Ultra-Big Game. Nelson
became the first Cardinal runner
to carry for 1000 yards in a year
when he gained 94 yards on 23
carries. Benjamin closed out his
career flawlessly, with 211 yards
passing for one touchdown and
no interceptions.
Of course, Stanford went on to
win the Sun Bowl, and did the
double-whammy the following
season with a Big Game win and
a bowl triumph. Bill Walsh, the
man behind this success, was
summarily taken up into the next
world by the 49ers. He took with
him from the farm a bright young
assistant named Denny Green.
Which perhaps may lend some
hope to you, Adam, as you wait
again for a Big Game which can
he termed Big in every sense of
the word.
