# When 'Big' wasn't just talk

In the Garden, Adam was
troubled. God sent his angel, Rap
hael, to ease his mind.
"What troubles you, Sire of
Man 1 ?" asked Raphael.
"It's Big Game," said Adam,
fit doesn't have any luster. Cal is
4-6, Stanford is 2-8. Last year, it
was the same story. Why is it so
meaningless?"
"My son," said Raphael, "Big
Game has a meaning that
transcends all records. It is on
another level. Any loyal fan will
tell you that both the Golden Bears
and the Cardinal play two seasons
each year the first 10 games,
and Big Game."
"I know all of the tradition
stuff, and the bizarre Play in
1982," said the Progenitor. "But
what about bowl games, and win
ning records, and national TV?
Why doesn't Big Game have any
of that?"
To which Raphael replied, "Ah,
but this was not always so. Rest
awhile, and I will tell thee of great
battles before thy time when Big
Game really was Big."
Many will remember 1986 as
the last year that the Stanford
football team went to a bowl game,
or had a winning record. It was
also the last year Big Game could
qualify as Big outside the Bay
Area.
Stanford was 7-2, its best record
at that point in the season since
1971, a Rose Bowl year. The Car
dinal was on a high after upset
ting the favored UCLA Bruins on,
the road the previous week, 28-23.
Jack Elway's squad had an invi
tation to the Gator Bowl already
tucked in its proverbial back
pocket.
California's program, on the
other hand, was in turmoil. Coach
Joe Kapp had been warring with
the media all year, and had been

told he would be replaced at
season's end. His players
responded like a team without
faith in its coaches, building an
eight-game losing streak heading
into Big Game.
Despite playing in Berkeley,
Stanford and its fans were confi
dent. They had the Axe, a much
better team, and the possibity of
a 10-win season to motivate them.
Everyone, including the Gator
Bowl officials that extended the
invitation knowing the Cardinal
had two games left on its
schedule, was expecting a blowout
by the men of the Peninsula.
But the Almighty would not
smile on the Stanford Red, and
the Blue and Gold pulled off the
stunning upset, 17-11.
Troy Taylor, the Cal senior
quarterback who will make his
final collegiate start tbday, was
the Golden Bear starter that year.
But against USC the week before
Big Game, Taylor broke his jaw
and was not able to go against
Stanford. He would, however,
have a role to play.
Kapp went with second-stringer
Kevin Brown, who threw for 221
yards on the Cardinal in his first
full game of the season. The win
ning margin came on a 47-yard
reverse play by Mike Ford
which Taylor called from the press
box.
Going back a little more, there
was the 1980 Big Game, in which
a bowl invitation did ride on the
outcome of the contest. The Car
dinal, 6-4 going into the final
game, needed a road win against
the Bears to go to the Peach Bowl.
Led by sophomore quarterback
John Elway and junior Darrin
Nelson, Stanford had the horses.
Cal, losers of four straight in
cluding a 60-7 shellacking at the
hands of USC, had the Axe and
a bowl ring from the previous
