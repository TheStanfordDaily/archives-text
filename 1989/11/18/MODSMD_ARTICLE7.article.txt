# Grant and Scott have got the opposition covered

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
As defensive backs and kick
returners, they are widely re
garded as two of Stanford's best
players. They are also best of
friends. And while their journey
hasn't always been filled with vic
tories, Kevin Scott and Alan
Grant have persevered and kept
their senses of humor.
Grant says of Scott: "He's fun
to play with on the field. He gets
excited . . . gets you fired up. He's
fast paced, I'm pretty laid back."
Scott concurs. "I have away of
letting my emotions fly. I do the
yelling, he does the listening."

When they're not playing, if you
find one, the other is probably
close by as the two enjoy spending
time together. "We've had some
exploits, me and him. We have a
good time," Scott said. Yet, while
they possess the on-field ar
rogance necessary for all success
ful defensive backs, Scott and
Grant aren't very flamboyant.
"Off the field, I'm calm; he's cal
mer," Scott says.
But bring up how they were
once maligned in the media and
the calmness disappears. "Every
time you see an article in the
paper (about how the Stanford
secondary isn't up to par), you go
crazy," Grant says.

Scott and Grant use that as a
rallying point. They take the nega
tive comments and use them to
get fired up or more simply,
to get cocky.
"If you're not cocky it's like
you're just out there," Scott says.
"You can't just be out there....
Your psyche's going to get blown."
Says Grant: "The main com
plaint defensive backs have is
when you have these (TV) com
mentators ... they don't know
what they're talking about."
Grant notes they are always ready
to blame the defensive backs when
something goes wrong.
"You don't know what a DB is
doing unless you know the de

fense," he says. The safeties and
the corners of the world learn to
shut it out. "Cornerback isn't a
job, it's a predicament. It's: 'How
are you going to make the best
of a bad situation' ... like cover
ing Jerry Rice with 80 yards of
field (out there)."
"I guess that's why DBs are so
cocky," he says.
Scott adds: "The biggest thing
in a game situation is when a big
play happens . . . you have to get
over it. You can't dwell on the
fact that you get burned or miss
an assignment."
As veterans, Scott and Grant
are also there to help the younger
players along especially when

that big play happens. "You try
not to let them get into a funk,"
Scott says. "You say 'lt's over
with, let's get ready for the next
down.' "
With Grant playing his last
game at Stanford today and Scott
closing out his junior year, the
two look back and see the good.
"I can't see regrets about choosing
to come here or any of the teams
I've played on," Grant said.
Any regrets for Scott? "None
whatsoever. I love the guys on
the team. I couldn't see it being
[anywhere near as good] as it is
now at another school. It's not all
about winning and losing."
