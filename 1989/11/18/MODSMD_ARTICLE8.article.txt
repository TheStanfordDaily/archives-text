# He leaves 'em laughing
## Andy Papathanassiou, always quick with a joke, throws his last block for the Cardinal 
### Debbie Brear Staff writer 
He has weathered five years of
Cardinal football, and he still has
a sense of humor.
For senior offensive lineman
Andy Papathanassiou, this year's
Big Game is more than the last
game of the season: It is the last
game of his Stanford football
career. Today's game against Cal
ifornia also marks his 45th
straight start at the position of
left guard.
Coming from Emerson, N.J., "it
took a little time" for Papathanas
siou, affectionately known as
"Papa" to his teammates, to get
caught up in the cross-bay rivalry.
"But pretty soon, you know some
one or have friends at Cal, and
you get the idea that it's a very
important game, and that it gives
you bragging rights for the rest
of the year it's a tradition,"
said Papathanassiou. And this
year, he adds, "The Big Game to
me means the last game."
According to Papathanassiou,
winning Big Game has extra sig
nificance for the team. "It's nice
to come away with a win . . . it's
the last game, the team across
the Bay, and you're playing
against people you're going to
bump into for the rest of the
year." In addition, he says "in any
year, the last game is what you
will send off next year's team
with."
And with this year's record, a
win against Cal may help the Car
dinal make a turnaround next
year. Papathanassiou says that
the team now sees this season "as
a beginning, as opposed to an end.
It's where we start." He says that
the team is in a developmental
stage. "Even when you build the
tallest building, you have to start
at the basement, and that's where
we are. Hopefully, we'll have a
win against Cal, and we'll start
building our tower."
Papathanassiou says that in
preparation for the Big Game,
"nothing really special is going
on. It's just like the first week,
or the fifth week we'll just go
out and practice hard." A certain
amount of mental preparation is
necessary, though. "You have to
throw out the record it doesn't
matter who is good and who is
bad. What matters is the frame
of mind, and who has the enthu

siasm, whether it's just 'the last
game' or if it's 'hey, this is a great
opportunity for a win in front of
85,000 people.' " According to
Papathanassiou, most of the team
spirit "takes care of itself. You
hear it on the news ... it builds
on its own. You have to let that
grow inside of you."
Papathanassiou predicts "a
Stanford blowout you can fill
in the score." He is "biased"
toward his final Big Game: "I feel
it's the most important game, be
cause it's the last and because it's
my last."
In Papathanassiou's decision to
come to Stanford, "the real selling
point was the guys I saw myself
in them, and it was very easy to
fit in here with the team." As for
his family, "Sure, they would like
for me to be close by, but when
you say that you're going to Stan
ford, it takes some of the sting
away." In addition, Stanford was
one of the few schools that would
allow Papathanassiou to compete
in both football and track.
Track? That's right, Papat
hanassiou missed the last two
years of spring football training
to compete for the track team in
the shot put. He says that it
doesn't create problems "as long
as I come back in the fall with a
sound technique and know what
I'm doing." To this end, Papat
hanassiou spent this past summer
on the Farm, taking classes and
preparing for the football season.
Coach Denny Green is pleased
with Papathanassiou's perform
ance. "Andy's been a steady per
former for us at the guard
position. He has started every
game and played very hard,"
Green said. And as a fifth-year
senior, Green adds, "I think he
has leadership capabilities. The
players have a lot of respect for
him."

Papathanassiou has always
been young for his grade in
fact, he just turned 22 in July.
But now in his fifth year, he says,
"I feel old." One reason for this,
he says, is due to his younger
sister, now a freshman in college.
"I remember my freshman days
I felt mature and all, and now
she's a freshman. But somehow,
I don't see her in the same way,"
explains Papathanassiou. A sec
ond reason, he says, is that "ex
cept for some friends and some
other undergrads, we're the oldest

group here at Stanford (besides
graduates). It's weird."
Papathanassiou adds that
"some people think the fifth year
is different from the others .. .
but in a lot of ways, it's not. I
play as hard as I can, like always."
He points but one difference, how
ever. "The older guys the ones
we always looked up to are
gone. Now we're in that role, so
we have to put forth as good an
image as we can."
Just because he's a role model
doesn't mean he has to be serious,
says Papathanassiou. "I get to
give out all the old man stories
like, 'I was doing this before
you were born,' " he says.
And, his humor isn't lost on
his teammates. Junior Eric Pierce

says "Andy always keeps his sense
of humor, and puts things in per
spective. He's always able to make
you laugh, even if you've just had
the worst practice or the worst
game."
His coaches also notice his pos
itive attitude. Says Green: "Andy's
a guy that's really enjoyed his five
years here at Stanford. He's very
popular among his teammates
and very active in both football
and track. He's the type of guy
who is successful both on the foot
ball field and in the classroom."
Indeed, Papathanassiou has
taken academics here seriously.
He is an undergraduate economics
major and is also completing
coterminal graduate work in or
ganizational behavior. His plans

for the future, however, are not
quite so concrete. "If anyone has
a really good suggestion, let me
know." says Papthanassiou.
He plans to begin his job search
this winter, in the business field.
"My biggest priority this winter
is to straighten out the rest of
my life," he says.
A member and resident of the
now-closed Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, Papathanassiou didn't let
the earthquake and relocation up
set him. "The quake was on a
Tuesday, and they gave us the
next day off from practice kind
of a rare thing. So we went
straight out and were lucky
enough to find a place to live the

a starter in every game the past four years.
first day."
Papathanassiou now shares an
apartment with teammates Rob
Hinckley and Kevin Mescher.
Rather than hurting the team's
concentration, Papathanassiou
says that the earthquake may
have helped the team to focus.
"Usually there is school and you
are nervous for the game," he
explains, "But instead, all we were
worrying about was finding a

place to live and getting our stuff
out of our rooms, so in relation,
football seemed simple."
Papathanassiou feels that he's
come a long way since his first
start four years ago, against
Texas. "I found out I was starting
the Thursday before the game,"
he said. "I was the nervous type
in high school so I was really
nervous, more nervous than for
anything else in my life. I got to
the game and in the first series,
I completely forgot every play."
But teammate Andy Sinclair
came to his rescue. "I still thank

him every now and then for this
he told me what to do on every
single play for the whole game."
And Papathanassiou says that
luckily, "The coaches never found
out. I think they would have
replaced me."
Papathanassiou has "never
regretted" his decision to come to
Stanford, or his days on the of
fensive line. The lack of public
notoriety doesn't bother him, he
says. "Sure, they don't publish
my blocking stats on Sunday in
the box score, but the people that
count on me know how I've done."

In addition, "It's okay being out
of the limelight. Then when you
have a bad game, nobody knows.
And when you have a good game,
the people who know the game
notice," says Papathanassiou. He
adds with a laugh, "That's why I
do the shotput for the
notoriety."
Even after a losing season,
Papathanassiou prefers to look on
the bright side. "I try to look back
and remember the good things
a great play or a series to remem
ber. I have to go with that."
For example, "The Notre Dame

game was a downer because we
lost ... but it's nice to say that
we passed 68 times and did not
give up a sack against the No. 1
team in the country."
Papathanassiou will leave this
year with positive memories of
his Stanford experience. He con
cludes "College affects and
changes everyone's life. With foot
ball, it's more severe because foot
ball demands a lot more from you.
I am who I am because I came
to Stanford and because I play
football at Stanford. I wouldn't
have done it any other way."
He has weathered five years of
Cardinal football, and he still has

And with this year's record, a
win against Cal may help the Car
dinal make a turnaround next
year. Papathanassiou says that
the team now sees this season "as
a beginning, as opposed to an end.
It's where we start." He says that
the team is in a developmental
stage. "Even when you build the
tallest building, you have to start
at the basement, and that's where
we are. Hopefully, we'll have a
win against Cal, and we'll start
building our tower."
Papathanassiou says that in
preparation for the Big Game,
"nothing really special is going
on. It's just like the first week,
or the fifth week we'll just go
out and practice hard." A certain
amount of mental preparation is
necessary, though. "You have to
throw out the record it doesn't
matter who is good and who is
bad. What matters is the frame
of mind, and who has the enthu

siasm, whether it's just 'the last
game' or if it's 'hey, this is a great
opportunity for a win in front of
85,000 people.' " According to
Papathanassiou, most of the team
spirit "takes care of itself. You
hear it on the news ... it builds
on its own. You have to let that
grow inside of you."
Papathanassiou predicts "a
Stanford blowout you can fill
in the score." He is "biased"
toward his final Big Game: "I feel
it's the most important game, be
cause it's the last and because it's
my last."
In Papathanassiou's decision to
come to Stanford, "the real selling
point was the guys I saw myself
in them, and it was very easy to
fit in here with the team." As for
his family, "Sure, they would like
for me to be close by, but when
you say that you're going to Stan
ford, it takes some of the sting
away." In addition, Stanford was
one of the few schools that would
allow Papathanassiou to compete
in both football and track.
Track? That's right, Papat
hanassiou missed the last two
years of spring football training
to compete for the track team in
the shot put. He says that it
doesn't create problems "as long
as I come back in the fall with a
sound technique and know what
I'm doing." To this end, Papat
hanassiou spent this past summer
on the Farm, taking classes and
preparing for the football season.
Coach Denny Green is pleased
with Papathanassiou's perform
ance. "Andy's been a steady per
former for us at the guard
position. He has started every
game and played very hard,"
Green said. And as a fifth-year
senior, Green adds, "I think he
has leadership capabilities. The
players have a lot of respect for
him."

Papathanassiou has always
been young for his grade in
fact, he just turned 22 in July.
But now in his fifth year, he says,
"I feel old." One reason for this,
he says, is due to his younger
sister, now a freshman in college.
"I remember my freshman days
I felt mature and all, and now
she's a freshman. But somehow,
I don't see her in the same way,"
explains Papathanassiou. A sec
ond reason, he says, is that "ex
cept for some friends and some
other undergrads, we're the oldest

group here at Stanford (besides
graduates). It's weird."
Papathanassiou adds that
"some people think the fifth year
is different from the others .. .
but in a lot of ways, it's not. I
play as hard as I can, like always."
He points but one difference, how
ever. "The older guys the ones
we always looked up to are
gone. Now we're in that role, so
we have to put forth as good an
image as we can."
Just because he's a role model
doesn't mean he has to be serious,
says Papathanassiou. "I get to
give out all the old man stories
like, 'I was doing this before
you were born,' " he says.
And, his humor isn't lost on
his teammates. Junior Eric Pierce

says "Andy always keeps his sense
of humor, and puts things in per
spective. He's always able to make
you laugh, even if you've just had
the worst practice or the worst
game."
His coaches also notice his pos
itive attitude. Says Green: "Andy's
a guy that's really enjoyed his five
years here at Stanford. He's very
popular among his teammates
and very active in both football
and track. He's the type of guy
who is successful both on the foot
ball field and in the classroom."
Indeed, Papathanassiou has
taken academics here seriously.
He is an undergraduate economics
major and is also completing
coterminal graduate work in or
ganizational behavior. His plans

for the future, however, are not
quite so concrete. "If anyone has
a really good suggestion, let me
know." says Papthanassiou.
He plans to begin his job search
this winter, in the business field.
"My biggest priority this winter
is to straighten out the rest of
my life," he says.
A member and resident of the
now-closed Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, Papathanassiou didn't let
the earthquake and relocation up
set him. "The quake was on a
Tuesday, and they gave us the
next day off from practice kind
of a rare thing. So we went
straight out and were lucky
enough to find a place to live the

Someone will have some big shoes to fill next year after the graduation of guard Andy Papathanassiou,
a starter in every game the past four years.
first day."
Papathanassiou now shares an
apartment with teammates Rob
Hinckley and Kevin Mescher.
Rather than hurting the team's
concentration, Papathanassiou
says that the earthquake may
have helped the team to focus.
"Usually there is school and you
are nervous for the game," he
explains, "But instead, all we were
worrying about was finding a

place to live and getting our stuff
out of our rooms, so in relation,
football seemed simple."
Papathanassiou feels that he's
come a long way since his first
start four years ago, against
Texas. "I found out I was starting
the Thursday before the game,"
he said. "I was the nervous type
in high school so I was really
nervous, more nervous than for
anything else in my life. I got to
the game and in the first series,
I completely forgot every play."
But teammate Andy Sinclair
came to his rescue. "I still thank

him every now and then for this
he told me what to do on every
single play for the whole game."
And Papathanassiou says that
luckily, "The coaches never found
out. I think they would have
replaced me."
Papathanassiou has "never
regretted" his decision to come to
Stanford, or his days on the of
fensive line. The lack of public
notoriety doesn't bother him, he
says. "Sure, they don't publish
my blocking stats on Sunday in
the box score, but the people that
count on me know how I've done."

In addition, "It's okay being out
of the limelight. Then when you
have a bad game, nobody knows.
And when you have a good game,
the people who know the game
notice," says Papathanassiou. He
adds with a laugh, "That's why I
do the shotput for the
notoriety."
Even after a losing season,
Papathanassiou prefers to look on
the bright side. "I try to look back
and remember the good things
a great play or a series to remem
ber. I have to go with that."
For example, "The Notre Dame

game was a downer because we
lost ... but it's nice to say that
we passed 68 times and did not
give up a sack against the No. 1
team in the country."
Papathanassiou will leave this
year with positive memories of
his Stanford experience. He con
cludes "College affects and
changes everyone's life. With foot
ball, it's more severe because foot
ball demands a lot more from you.
I am who I am because I came
to Stanford and because I play
football at Stanford. I wouldn't
have done it any other way."
He has weathered five years of
Cardinal football, and he still has
a sense of humor.
For senior offensive lineman
Andy Papathanassiou, this year's
Big Game is more than the last
game of the season: It is the last
game of his Stanford football
career. Today's game against Cal
ifornia also marks his 45th
straight start at the position of
left guard.
Coming from Emerson, N.J., "it
took a little time" for Papathanas
siou, affectionately known as
"Papa" to his teammates, to get
caught up in the cross-bay rivalry.
"But pretty soon, you know some
one or have friends at Cal, and
you get the idea that it's a very
important game, and that it gives
you bragging rights for the rest
of the year it's a tradition,"
said Papathanassiou. And this
year, he adds, "The Big Game to
me means the last game."
According to Papathanassiou,
winning Big Game has extra sig
nificance for the team. "It's nice
to come away with a win . . . it's
the last game, the team across
the Bay, and you're playing
against people you're going to
bump into for the rest of the
year." In addition, he says "in any
year, the last game is what you
will send off next year's team
with."

it's the most important game, be
cause it's the last and because it's
my last."
In Papathanassiou's decision to
come to Stanford, "the real selling
point was the guys I saw myself
in them, and it was very easy to
fit in here with the team." As for
his family, "Sure, they would like
for me to be close by, but when
you say that you're going to Stan
ford, it takes some of the sting
away." In addition, Stanford was
one of the few schools that would
allow Papathanassiou to compete
in both football and track.
Track? That's right, Papat
hanassiou missed the last two
years of spring football training
to compete for the track team in
the shot put. He says that it
doesn't create problems "as long
as I come back in the fall with a
sound technique and know what
I'm doing." To this end, Papat
hanassiou spent this past summer
on the Farm, taking classes and
preparing for the football season.
Coach Denny Green is pleased
with Papathanassiou's perform
ance. "Andy's been a steady per
former for us at the guard
position. He has started every
game and played very hard,"
Green said. And as a fifth-year
senior, Green adds, "I think he
has leadership capabilities. The
players have a lot of respect for
him."

Papathanassiou has always
been young for his grade in
fact, he just turned 22 in July.
But now in his fifth year, he says,
"I feel old." One reason for this,
he says, is due to his younger
sister, now a freshman in college.
"I remember my freshman days
I felt mature and all, and now
she's a freshman. But somehow,
I don't see her in the same way,"
explains Papathanassiou. A sec
ond reason, he says, is that "ex
cept for some friends and some
other undergrads, we're the oldest

group here at Stanford (besides
graduates). It's weird."
Papathanassiou adds that
"some people think the fifth year
is different from the others .. .
but in a lot of ways, it's not. I
play as hard as I can, like always."
He points but one difference, how
ever. "The older guys the ones
we always looked up to are
gone. Now we're in that role, so
we have to put forth as good an
image as we can."
Just because he's a role model
doesn't mean he has to be serious,
says Papathanassiou. "I get to
give out all the old man stories
like, 'I was doing this before
you were born,' " he says.
And, his humor isn't lost on
his teammates. Junior Eric Pierce

says "Andy always keeps his sense
of humor, and puts things in per
spective. He's always able to make
you laugh, even if you've just had
the worst practice or the worst
game."
His coaches also notice his pos
itive attitude. Says Green: "Andy's
a guy that's really enjoyed his five
years here at Stanford. He's very
popular among his teammates
and very active in both football
and track. He's the type of guy
who is successful both on the foot
ball field and in the classroom."
Indeed, Papathanassiou has
taken academics here seriously.
He is an undergraduate economics
major and is also completing
coterminal graduate work in or
ganizational behavior. His plans

for the future, however, are not
quite so concrete. "If anyone has
a really good suggestion, let me
know." says Papthanassiou.
He plans to begin his job search
this winter, in the business field.
"My biggest priority this winter
is to straighten out the rest of
my life," he says.
A member and resident of the
now-closed Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity, Papathanassiou didn't let
the earthquake and relocation up
set him. "The quake was on a
Tuesday, and they gave us the
next day off from practice kind
of a rare thing. So we went
straight out and were lucky
enough to find a place to live the

a starter in every game the past four years.
first day."
Papathanassiou now shares an
apartment with teammates Rob
Hinckley and Kevin Mescher.
Rather than hurting the team's
concentration, Papathanassiou
says that the earthquake may
have helped the team to focus.
"Usually there is school and you
are nervous for the game," he
explains, "But instead, all we were
worrying about was finding a

place to live and getting our stuff
out of our rooms, so in relation,
football seemed simple."
Papathanassiou feels that he's
come a long way since his first
start four years ago, against
Texas. "I found out I was starting
the Thursday before the game,"
he said. "I was the nervous type
in high school so I was really
nervous, more nervous than for
anything else in my life. I got to
the game and in the first series,
I completely forgot every play."
But teammate Andy Sinclair
came to his rescue. "I still thank

him every now and then for this
he told me what to do on every
single play for the whole game."
And Papathanassiou says that
luckily, "The coaches never found
out. I think they would have
replaced me."
Papathanassiou has "never
regretted" his decision to come to
Stanford, or his days on the of
fensive line. The lack of public
notoriety doesn't bother him, he
says. "Sure, they don't publish
my blocking stats on Sunday in
the box score, but the people that
count on me know how I've done."

In addition, "It's okay being out
of the limelight. Then when you
have a bad game, nobody knows.
And when you have a good game,
the people who know the game
notice," says Papathanassiou. He
adds with a laugh, "That's why I
do the shotput for the
notoriety."
Even after a losing season,
Papathanassiou prefers to look on
the bright side. "I try to look back
and remember the good things
a great play or a series to remem
ber. I have to go with that."
For example, "The Notre Dame

game was a downer because we
lost ... but it's nice to say that
we passed 68 times and did not
give up a sack against the No. 1
team in the country."
Papathanassiou will leave this
year with positive memories of
his Stanford experience. He con
cludes "College affects and
changes everyone's life. With foot
ball, it's more severe because foot
ball demands a lot more from you.
I am who I am because I came
to Stanford and because I play
football at Stanford. I wouldn't
have done it any other way."
He has weathered five years of
Cardinal football, and he still has
a sense of humor.
For senior offensive lineman
Andy Papathanassiou, this year's
Big Game is more than the last
game of the season: It is the last
game of his Stanford football
career. Today's game against Cal
ifornia also marks his 45th
straight start at the position of
left guard.
Coming from Emerson, N.J., "it
took a little time" for Papathanas
siou, affectionately known as
"Papa" to his teammates, to get
caught up in the cross-bay rivalry.
"But pretty soon, you know some
one or have friends at Cal, and
you get the idea that it's a very
important game, and that it gives
you bragging rights for the rest
of the year it's a tradition,"
said Papathanassiou. And this
year, he adds, "The Big Game to
me means the last game."
According to Papathanassiou,
winning Big Game has extra sig
nificance for the team. "It's nice
to come away with a win . . . it's
the last game, the team across
the Bay, and you're playing
against people you're going to
bump into for the rest of the
year." In addition, he says "in any
year, the last game is what you
will send off next year's team
with."
And with this year's record, a
win against Cal may help the Car
dinal make a turnaround next
year. Papathanassiou says that
the team now sees this season "as
a beginning, as opposed to an end.
It's where we start." He says that
the team is in a developmental
stage. "Even when you build the
tallest building, you have to start
at the basement, and that's where
we are. Hopefully, we'll have a
win against Cal, and we'll start
building our tower."
Papathanassiou says that in
preparation for the Big Game,
"nothing really special is going
on. It's just like the first week,
or the fifth week we'll just go
out and practice hard." A certain
amount of mental preparation is
necessary, though. "You have to
throw out the record it doesn't
matter who is good and who is
bad. What matters is the frame
of mind, and who has the enthu

siasm, whether it's just 'the last
game' or if it's 'hey, this is a great
opportunity for a win in front of
85,000 people.' " According to
Papathanassiou, most of the team
spirit "takes care of itself. You
hear it on the news ... it builds
on its own. You have to let that
grow inside of you."
Papathanassiou predicts "a
Stanford blowout you can fill
in the score." He is "biased"
toward his final Big Game: "I feel
it's the most important game, be
cause it's the last and because it's
my last."
In Papathanassiou's decision to
come to Stanford, "the real selling
