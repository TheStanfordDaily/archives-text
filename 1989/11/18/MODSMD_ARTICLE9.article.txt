# Buck makes last stop
## Roggeman remembers the long journey that has taken him through five Big Games 
### TIMOTHY ROGGEMAN 
It's hard to believe that my fifth
Big Game has arrived.
The first one is just a misty
memory. Maybe that's because the
weather was pretty misty that
day. It was 1985, my redshirt year,
and I knew that I would not be
playing in the game. Nevertheless,
I was captured by Big Game hype
and all of the festivities which led
up to it.

In 1985 there was still a Big
Game rally in San Francisco. Be
cause I wasn't going to play, I
was able to go that Friday night.
All I remember is walking about
100 miles on the Marina and
standing frozen on concrete steps
while watching the Band play. I
loved it. For some reason I didn't
go to Gaieties that year.
I had heard that strange things
happen in Big Games, and 1985
was no exception to the rumor.
Stanford scored the first 24
points of the game, and I was
thinking that victory was locked.
When the other team stormed
back to score 22 points in a span
of about five minutes, I learned
that there is no such thing as a
"lock" in Big Game. They scored
on a reverse, a safety, and some
other odd plays. However, a cru
cial 34-yard pass from John Paye
to Jeff James on third-and-22
deep in our territory gave us the
first down that we needed to run
the clock out with under two
minutes left to play in the game.
We kept The Axe.
I forgot to go to Gaieties in
1986, and I couldn't go to the
rally in San Francisco, because I
was playing. However, I did attend
the reinstitution of an old tradi

tion on the Thursday night before
Big Game. It was the Big Game
bonfire (or weenie roast). As I
walked across a dry Lake Lagu
nita, and stood frozen while lis
tening to the Band play some
familiar songs, I remember think
ing that I couldn't wait until the
four-story pile of lumber was lit.
With flames licking into the black
sky, and with a 7-2 record, I
couldn't help but believe that we
would surely beat that other

team.
I learned, once again, that there
is no sure thing in a Big Game.
After we opened the game with
an impressive drive which stalled
near the enemy's goal line, we
didn't do much else that after
noon. They ran the same reverse
for another touchdown, and
before I knew what had happened
there were a bunch of blue and
gold weenies holding our Axe and
celebrating.

In 1987, I didn't even hear
about Gaieties. I was disappointed
to learn that the rally in San
Francisco had been canceled, be
cause the University could not
afford to insure the event. Tradi
tions get killed for the most
peculiar reasons.
This made the bonfire even
more special for me. I anxiously
anticipated standing in Lake Lag
frozen while the Band played
those ever-so-familiar songs. I was

still fascinated by our Stanford
version of the (Hoover) Towering
Inferno, but I think it was the
pyromaniac coming out in me
more than anything else.
The most memorable part of
Big Game 'B7 was the Friday
night before the game. Instead of
our normal meetings, the coaches
asked all of the seniors to stand
up a say what Big Game meant
to them. There was so much emo
tion in that room that I think we
would have beaten the boys from
across the Bay by 100 points. As
it turned out, we won 31-7.
We walked off with The Axe.
Last year's Big Game was my
most frustrating. I missed
Gaieties, I missed the bonfire, and
I wasn't able to play in the game,
because I had my knee
reconstructed a week and a half
earlier. I was jealous of the people
who stood frozen in Lake Lagunita
listening to the songs which had
been drummed into my head.
On Saturday, I rode up on the
bus with the rest of the guys who
didn't travel with the team.
Well, a lot of things went wrong
for the Cardinal that day, and
when those other folks lined up
to kick a 20-yard field goal with
:03 left on the clock to break a
19-19 tie, I believe they thought
they had the game locked up.
Ah, but there is no such thing
as a "lock" in Big Game, so
nobody was all too surprised when
Tuan Van Le blocked the field
goal. They were depressed, and
we were happy until we realized
that we hadn't won.
We kept The Axe by default.
This year quite a few things
have changed. I finally have a
ticket to Gaieties. Unfortunately,
there will be no bonfire because
the Axe Committee can't afford
it. Will I ever freeze and hear
those semi- beloved songs again?
Some of the recent arrivals at
Stanford don't even know that
there ever was a rally in the City.
I guess some traditions die quick
ly.



Barry Saik - Daily file
Buck Roggeman is joined by Kevin Richardson to celebrate Stanford's bowl game-clinching win over
UCLA in 1986, perhaps the best of several fond memories from the past five years.
One thing I am sure of this
year is that I can't be sure of
anything. This is what makes Big
Game truly big. No one knows
what is going to happen or how
it is going to take place. This
aspect distinguishes Big Game
from all of the other rivalries
across the nation. It is quite pos
sibly the most wild, reckless and
fun rivalry in college sports.
I guess I am a little biased.
However, this is my last one. The
others have been crazy and I think
this one will be a little odd as
well. I hope we play well.
I hope we keep The Axe.
