YOUTH, IDENTITY, POWER
The Chicano Movement
CARLOS MUNOZ, JR.
Youth, Identity, Power is a study of the origins
and development of Chicano radicalism in
Amenca. Written by a leader of the Chicano
Student Movement of the 1960s who also
played a role in the creation of the wider Chi
cano Power Movement, this is the first full
length work to appear on the subject. It fills an
important gap in the history of political protest
in the United States.
The author places the Chicano movement in
the wider context of the political development
of Mexicans and their descendants in the US,
tracing the emergence of Chicano student ac
tivists in the 1930s and their initial challenge to
the dominant racial and class ideologies of the
time. Muhoz then documents the rise and fall
of the Chicano Power Movement, situating the
student protests of the sixties within the chang
ing political scene of the time, and assessing
the movement's contribution to the cultural de
velopment of the Chicano population as a
whole. He concludes with an account of Chi
cano politics in the 1980s.
The first major book on the Chicano
movement by one of its leaders, who is also
a first-rate scholar, Youth, Identity, Power is
certain to be the benchmark for all future
work on the subject. An important and
unique contribution to the history of the
19605, it... should be required reading.
