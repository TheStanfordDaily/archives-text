FACULTY CONDEMNS
SALVADORAN MURDERS
On Thursday morning, November 16,1989, six Jesuit priests and two staff members of the Central American University
in El Salvador were brutally slain by heavily armed men dressed in military uniforms. Among the dead were three noted
scholars who have worked closely with Stanford faculty and students: Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of the university; Ignacio
Martin-Baro, vice rector; and Segundo Montes, head of the university's human rights office.
We, the undersigned faculty of Stanford University, lament and denounce the killings of our Salvadoran colleagues and
co-researchers at the Central American University. We call for an immediate and thorough investigation of their murders
— both in El Salvador and in the United States — in order to bring the perpetrators of this terrible crime to justice.
