Now the Bears are just seeing
red.

Cardinal 24
Golden Bears 14

Wearing cardinal jerseys and
pants for the first time in mem
ory, Stanford ran right, ran left
and just plain ran over the Bears
en route to a 24-14 win. Tailback
J.J. Lasley did much of the
damage, running for 101 yards on
only 17 carries for the Cardinal's
first 100-yard performance of the
year.
For the game Stanford rushed
for 229 yards, far and away the
best single-game effort of the year.
"We thought it was a tremen
dous football game," Coach Denny
Green said. "Offensively we said
we had to run the ball to win."
The Cardinal's offensive line
continued to improve and the
result was a number of big holes
for the running backs to go

through.
"Whenever the ball was called
for me I knew something good
was going to happen because the
line was blocking their guys five
yards off the line," Lasley said.
"They were just crushing
people.... It seemed like there
wasn't just one hole, there were
two or three. I just had to pick
the right hole."
"I'd say we have matured into
a good running team as the season
has gone on," senior offensive
guard Andy Papathanassiou said.
"I think our handling them on
the line and J.J.'s cutback ability
was a great combination. . . . This
game is one of those where every
thing was just clicking. In the sec
ond half the runs just clicked."
The result leaves Stanford 3-8
overall and 3-5 in the Pacific 10
Conference. Cal finishes 4-7 over
all, 2-6 in the Pac-10. For the
second year in a row the Bears
finished last in the league stand
ings while Stanford ended up tied
with Washington State in seventh
after winning two of its last three.
Stanford will now keep the Axe
for the third straight year, the
longest stretch one school has had
it since Stanford held the Axe
from 1976 to 1978.
Stanford warmed up in the
team's usual cardinal jerseys and
white pants. But when the team

returned for the game, everyone
was dressed in cardinal pants. The
team had the pants because
former Coach Jack Elway some
times liked to wear colored pants
on the road.
Green doesn't like colored pants
and said the equipment manager
had negotiated a deal to sell the
pants. But after a Friday night
meeting, Stanford elected to wear
them.
"We were eating dinner Friday
night and I said, 'Hey, we should
ask coach if we can wear the red
pants,' and some of the guys got
behind me," freshman Bob Whit
field said. "They made me go ask
coach."
"[Friday] night they came to
me with Bob Whitfield as an ad
vocate," Green said. "I'm a pretty
tough coach but I have a little
compassion — not much, but a
little. We went to the equipment
people — they said we could do
it. I honestly didn't even know if
we still had the pants."
"I guess it gave us a little mo
tivation." Whitfield said. "As soon
as coach said we could wear the
red pants we go* pumped. I guess
these are like our attitude pants."
In addition to the fashion state
ment, which Green thought
"looked pretty damn pretty," the

Freshman offensive tackle Bob Whitfield (70) congratulates running back J.J. Lasley (26) after Stanford
axed Cal 24-14 in the Big Game. Cal upset Arizona and Washington State in its previous two games,
but Saturday at Stanford Stadium the Cardinal unveiled a rejuvenated running attack and flashy red
pants, giving them the momentum to top the Bears. Stanford opens the 1990 season next fall on the
road against Colorado — currently ranked No. 2 in the nation.
key to the win was clearly the
running game. While Stanford
ran for 229 yards, including 182
in the second half, Cal rushed for
only 50 yards on 22 tries. Stanford
played an aggressive, blitzing de
fense that shut down the run and
put a lot of heat on Golden Bear
quarterback Troy Taylor.
"They played better than we
did," Cal Coach Bruce Snyder
said. "And normally the team who
plays best wins. . . . We could not
generate any running today."
"They were pressing, coming
after us. We knew that they were
going to," Taylor said. "We did
make some big plays, we just
didn't make enough of them,
enough for touchdowns."
A key part of that blitzing Car
dinal defense was cornerback
Tuan Van Le. Le put pressure on
Taylor all night and ended up
leading Stanford with 12 tackles
for the game. "I tried to be in
[Taylor's] face all the time," Le
said. "I think coach had a great
plan. We played by our plan and
not by their plan. That's the way
to win a ballgame."
Le, who blocked a field goal to
preserve a tie in last year's Big
Game, is rapidly becoming a Big
Game legend.
"I love the Big Game," he said.
"It makes the season. It doesn't
matter if both teams are 1-9 or
9-1. It's just between us and Cal.
That's it. That's Big Game —
everything else goes out the win
dow."
After stopping the Bears after
the opening kickoff, Stanford gave
an indication of what it wanted
to do right away. On the first
offensive play, Lasley ran off left
tackle for 16 yards. Running, es
pecially to the left side, would be
something California would get
enough of to last until spring prac
tice.
"It's no secret we run left a
lot," Green said. "We got in behind
Bob Whitfield and Chuck Gilling
ham a lot."
Whitfield, the 6-foot-7, 300-
pound freshman left tackle,
wouldn't have it any other way.
"It's real fun (to run block)," he
said, "until you run about eight
or nine in a row and you start
breathing hard. . . . You just go
pound it out. You see if you can
pound harder than they do, and
we did. We just got after them,
got it going, and pounded them."
Papathanassiou also liked the
idea of stampeding the Bears in
his last collegiate game. "With a
win, with a good job by the line
and a great effort by the backs:
That's about as good as it can get
for an offensive linemen unless
you run the fumblerooskie, which

'I guess it gave us
a little motivation.
As soon as coach
said we could wear
the red pants we
got pumped. I
guess these are
like our attitude
pants.'

I did suggest," he said.
Stanford's drive stalled but a
few plays later cornerback Albert
Richardson picked off a Taylor
pass and ran 13 yards up the
sideline to the Bear 35. The
ground game moved the Cardinal
to the 22, then Steve Smith found
Ed McCaffrey open for a 16-yard
pass to the six.
Fullback Scott Eschelman
caught a swing pass for three,
then Lasley eluded a Cal blitz by
getting outside around the left
end.
Once he got out there, only two
defenders stood in his way. Papat
hanassiou and flanker Jon
Pinckney blocked them and Las
ley scooted in for his first col
legiate touchdown.
"I was so excited," he said. "I
wanted to just go do somersaults
down the sideline but I couldn't."
Cal countered early in the sec
ond quarter with a 75-yard drive
on the strength of Taylor's pass
ing. The senior, who finished with
377 yards passing in his last col
legiate game, pitched to Michael
Ford on a five- yard reverse to
tie it up, but a 32-yard John Hop
kins field goal put Stanford back
ahead.
Cal nearly tied it before the half
but Robbie Keen missed a 26-yard
field goal with two seconds
remaining.
A Hopkins 24-yarder put Stan
ford up 13-7 after three quarters
— then the ground game went
wild.
Stanford drove 78 yards on
eight plays, all runs, to add to
the lead. Fullback Tom Vardell
capped the drive by running up
the middle and breaking two
tackles from 22 yards out. Stan
ford went for two and Smith found
Pinckney on the goal line to make
the lead an even 14.
Taylor drove the Bears down
to the Cardinal 31, but Richard

son came up with his second in
terception of the game, and fifth
of the year. Taylor threw a long
timing pattern to Ford, but Ford
stopped at the 15. Richardson
keep going and caught the ball
over his shoulder on the five.
Stanford ran more than four
minutes off the clock but the
Bears finally forced a punt. Taylor
needed only 47 seconds to go 69
yards on five plays, however, and
it was a seven-point game with
4:01 left.
The Bears tried an onside kick
but McCaffrey recovered at the
Cal 44. Stanford got two first
downs and Hopkins iced the win
with a 35-yard field goal.
The ending was particularly sat
isfying to a Stanford team that
has had problems closing out wins
this year. "Everytime we came
into the huddle (on that last
drive), me, Steve (Smith) and
Scott Eschelman said, 'Let's close
the door,'" Lasley said. "We
wanted to score (a touchdown) but
the field goal was good. I think
we slammed the door."
"It was a good game for us,"
Green said. "We know the foun
dation is there to have a tremen
dous team in the future."
Card notes
Lasley, who missed much of the year
with a knee injury, made a name for
himself with the 100-yard game. He
also corrected the name he had made
for himself. He is called Jay Jay Lasley
in all publications, but said that's not
how he spells it.
"My given name is Jeffrey Jay Las
ley," he said, "but J.J. is almost like
my given name. That's how I sign
everything and that's what everyone
calls me. I spell it J period, J period.
They had J-A-Y J-A-Y in the media
guide, but I'm not going to go tell
them they got it wrong."
Stanford can claim dominance over
the Bears in the '80s with Saturday's
win. This decade Stanford has won
five, lost four and tied once. Stanford
has won the last three decades and
is 19-9-1 since 1961.
