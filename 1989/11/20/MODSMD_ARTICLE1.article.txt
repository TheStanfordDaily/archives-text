All week long California saw

ning streak and to send the sen

Now the Bears are just seeing
red.

Cardinal 24
Golden Bears 14

Wearing cardinal jerseys and
pants for the first time in mem
ory, Stanford ran right, ran left
and just plain ran over the Bears
en route to a 24-14 win. Tailback
J.J. Lasley did much of the
damage, running for 101 yards on
only 17 carries for the Cardinal's
first 100-yard performance of the
year.
For the game Stanford rushed
for 229 yards, far and away the
best single-game effort of the year.
"We thought it was a tremen
dous football game," Coach Denny
Green said. "Offensively we said
we had to run the ball to win."
The Cardinal's offensive line
continued to improve and the
result was a number of big holes
for the running backs to go

through.
"Whenever the ball was called
for me I knew something good
was going to happen because the
line was blocking their guys five
yards off the line," Lasley said.
"They were just crushing
people.... It seemed like there
wasn't just one hole, there were
two or three. I just had to pick
the right hole."
"I'd say we have matured into
a good running team as the season
has gone on," senior offensive
guard Andy Papathanassiou said.
"I think our handling them on
the line and J.J.'s cutback ability
was a great combination. . . . This
game is one of those where every
thing was just clicking. In the sec
ond half the runs just clicked."
The result leaves Stanford 3-8
overall and 3-5 in the Pacific 10
Conference. Cal finishes 4-7 over
all, 2-6 in the Pac-10. For the
second year in a row the Bears
finished last in the league stand
ings while Stanford ended up tied
with Washington State in seventh
after winning two of its last three.
Stanford will now keep the Axe
for the third straight year, the
longest stretch one school has had
it since Stanford held the Axe
from 1976 to 1978.
Stanford warmed up in the
team's usual cardinal jerseys and
white pants. But when the team

returned for the game, everyone
was dressed in cardinal pants. The
team had the pants because
former Coach Jack Elway some
times liked to wear colored pants
on the road.
Green doesn't like colored pants
and said the equipment manager
had negotiated a deal to sell the
pants. But after a Friday night
meeting, Stanford elected to wear
them.
"We were eating dinner Friday
night and I said, 'Hey, we should
ask coach if we can wear the red
pants,' and some of the guys got
behind me," freshman Bob Whit
field said. "They made me go ask
coach."
"[Friday] night they came to
me with Bob Whitfield as an ad
vocate," Green said. "I'm a pretty
tough coach but I have a little
compassion — not much, but a
little. We went to the equipment
people — they said we could do
it. I honestly didn't even know if
we still had the pants."
"I guess it gave us a little mo
tivation." Whitfield said. "As soon
as coach said we could wear the
red pants we go* pumped. I guess
these are like our attitude pants."
In addition to the fashion state
ment, which Green thought
"looked pretty damn pretty," the

Freshman offensive tackle Bob Whitfield (70) congratulates running back J.J. Lasley (26) after Stanford
axed Cal 24-14 in the Big Game. Cal upset Arizona and Washington State in its previous two games,
but Saturday at Stanford Stadium the Cardinal unveiled a rejuvenated running attack and flashy red
pants, giving them the momentum to top the Bears. Stanford opens the 1990 season next fall on the
road against Colorado — currently ranked No. 2 in the nation.
