## Thousands protest in Czechoslovakia 
### 
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) — About
30,000 demonstrators yesterday denounced
police brutality and demanded that the gov
ernment and top Communist officials resign.
Authorities arrested 10 dissidents but left the
marchers alone.
The government denied reports that police
killed a student in bloody clashes Friday, when
hundreds were beaten, tear-gassed and at
tacked by dogs in the largest demonstration
in 20 years.
Yesterday's rally began with a few thousand
protesters gathering on downtown Wenceslas
Square, but the crowd grew to 30,000 as
demonstrators reached Narodini Street, where
white-helmeted riot police beat demonstrators
Friday.
"We don't let you murder us!" the crowd
chanted. They also chanted such slogans as
"Write Truthfully," "Free Unions" and "Jakes
to the dustbin."
Milos Jakes is the hard-line leader of the
ruling Communist Party and, unlike most
East bloc leaders, has resisted reforms or
chestrated by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev.
About 2,000 demonstrators split away and
crossed a bridge over the Vltava river in an
apparent attempt to reach the hillside presi
dential residence.
Police did not interfere in the march but
did block access to the hill.
Those arrested included Petr Uhl, a leading
human rights activist, who was charged in
connection with the spreading of news about
the alleged death of Martin Smid at police
hands Friday. The state news agency CTK
said he was charged with "the crimes of har
ming the interests of the republic abroad and
spreading alarming news."
Uhl, a veteran member of the Charter 77
human rights group, is associated with VIA,

the crowd chanted. They also
chanted such slogans as
'Write Truthfully,' Tree
Unions' and 'Jakes to the
dustbin.'

European countries. If convicted, he could be
sentenced to 3Vi years in prison.
Dissident sources in Prague and Vienna told
The Associated Press that police also arrested
Drahomira Drazska, who said she was Smid's
girlfriend. She claimed he was killed by special
police Friday.
Some prominent dissidents such as Hana
Marvanova of the Independent Peace Associ
ation, Emanuel Mandler of the Democratic
Initiative and Anna Sabatova, a senior mem
ber of Charter 77, also were arrested, the
sources said.
Last night, about 300 people from a dozen
political groups met, formed an organization
called the Civil Forum and adopted a resolu
tion that demands the resignation of Com
munist Party Politburo members "responsible
for the 1968 invasion," including President
Gustav Husak and Jakes. The Soviet-led in
vasion in August 1968 crushed a liberal Com
munist government.
The resolution also calls for the removal of
officials responsible for suppressing Friday's
demonstration, establishes a commission to
investigate police brutality and demands the
release of all "prisoners of conscience."
It said if the demands are not met the Civil
Forum will back a two-hour general strike
Nov. 27. A representative of a student group

told the meeting students would begin sit-in
strikes at several universities today.
Among those attending the meeting were
representatives of the Socialist Party and
People's Party, both allied with the Commu
nists.
Protests also took place in at least eight
East German cities Sunday and in the Bul
garian capital, Sofia. As in Prague, the dem
onstrators demanded democratic reforms but
also punishment of recently ousted leaders —
Todor Zhivkov in Bulgaria and Erich Honecker
in East Germany.
Plainclothes police in Prague prevented
several reporters from attending a scheduled
news conference on the Smid case in the home
of Charter 77 spokeswoman Dana Nemcova.
According to dissident sources who spoke
on condition of anonymity, police picked up
some of the arrested people as they left or
sought to enter Nemcova's apartment.
The Washington Post reported yesterday
that a 20-year-old man named Martin Smid
died after being beaten by two police near
Wenceslas Square Friday. Police notified his
parents that he had died in an accident, ac
cording to the newspaper, which quoted
friends and witnesses it did not name.
"The information we have so far indicates
that it was an unfounded rumor," government
spokesman Miroslav Pavel said.
Informed unofficial sources said there may
be three people named Martin Smid in Prague,
so the identity of the alleged victim was dif
ficult to determine. Authorities spoke only of
two Martin Smids.
State television on Sunday showed the two,
both identified as students of mathematics at
Prague's Charles University.
The first one was said to be from the town
of Beroun near Prague. The other was iden
tified as a Prague resident, who said "I was
shaken" when told of the report he was dead.

Prague citizens made two memorials with candles, flowers and a
wreath at the place where Czech student Matin Smid was reportedly
beaten to death by police.

European countries. If convicted, he could be
sentenced to 3Vi years in prison.
Dissident sources in Prague and Vienna told
The Associated Press that police also arrested
Drahomira Drazska, who said she was Smid's
girlfriend. She claimed he was killed by special
police Friday.
Some prominent dissidents such as Hana
Marvanova of the Independent Peace Associ
ation, Emanuel Mandler of the Democratic
Initiative and Anna Sabatova, a senior mem
ber of Charter 77, also were arrested, the
sources said.
Last night, about 300 people from a dozen
political groups met, formed an organization
called the Civil Forum and adopted a resolu
tion that demands the resignation of Com
munist Party Politburo members "responsible
for the 1968 invasion," including President
Gustav Husak and Jakes. The Soviet-led in
vasion in August 1968 crushed a liberal Com
munist government.
The resolution also calls for the removal of
officials responsible for suppressing Friday's
demonstration, establishes a commission to
investigate police brutality and demands the
release of all "prisoners of conscience."
It said if the demands are not met the Civil
Forum will back a two-hour general strike
Nov. 27. A representative of a student group

told the meeting students would begin sit-in
strikes at several universities today.
Among those attending the meeting were
representatives of the Socialist Party and
People's Party, both allied with the Commu
nists.
Protests also took place in at least eight
East German cities Sunday and in the Bul
garian capital, Sofia. As in Prague, the dem
onstrators demanded democratic reforms but
also punishment of recently ousted leaders —
Todor Zhivkov in Bulgaria and Erich Honecker
in East Germany.
Plainclothes police in Prague prevented
several reporters from attending a scheduled
news conference on the Smid case in the home
of Charter 77 spokeswoman Dana Nemcova.
According to dissident sources who spoke
on condition of anonymity, police picked up
some of the arrested people as they left or
sought to enter Nemcova's apartment.
The Washington Post reported yesterday
that a 20-year-old man named Martin Smid
died after being beaten by two police near
Wenceslas Square Friday. Police notified his
parents that he had died in an accident, ac
cording to the newspaper, which quoted
friends and witnesses it did not name.
"The information we have so far indicates
that it was an unfounded rumor," government
spokesman Miroslav Pavel said.
Informed unofficial sources said there may
be three people named Martin Smid in Prague,
so the identity of the alleged victim was dif
ficult to determine. Authorities spoke only of
two Martin Smids.
State television on Sunday showed the two,
both identified as students of mathematics at
Prague's Charles University.
The first one was said to be from the town
of Beroun near Prague. The other was iden
tified as a Prague resident, who said "I was
shaken" when told of the report he was dead.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) — About
30,000 demonstrators yesterday denounced
police brutality and demanded that the gov
ernment and top Communist officials resign.
Authorities arrested 10 dissidents but left the
marchers alone.
The government denied reports that police
killed a student in bloody clashes Friday, when
hundreds were beaten, tear-gassed and at
tacked by dogs in the largest demonstration
in 20 years.
Yesterday's rally began with a few thousand
protesters gathering on downtown Wenceslas
Square, but the crowd grew to 30,000 as
demonstrators reached Narodini Street, where
white-helmeted riot police beat demonstrators
Friday.
"We don't let you murder us!" the crowd
chanted. They also chanted such slogans as
"Write Truthfully," "Free Unions" and "Jakes
to the dustbin."
Milos Jakes is the hard-line leader of the
ruling Communist Party and, unlike most
East bloc leaders, has resisted reforms or
chestrated by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev.
About 2,000 demonstrators split away and
crossed a bridge over the Vltava river in an
apparent attempt to reach the hillside presi
dential residence.
Police did not interfere in the march but
did block access to the hill.
Those arrested included Petr Uhl, a leading
human rights activist, who was charged in
connection with the spreading of news about
the alleged death of Martin Smid at police
hands Friday. The state news agency CTK
said he was charged with "the crimes of har
ming the interests of the republic abroad and
spreading alarming news."
Uhl, a veteran member of the Charter 77
human rights group, is associated with VIA,
