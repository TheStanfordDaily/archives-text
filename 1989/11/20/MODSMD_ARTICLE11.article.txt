About 800 mourners attended
the burial of six Jesuit priests and
two others who were slain and
mutilated early Thursday at their
residence at Jose Simeon Canas
Central American University.
The United States has pressed
rightist President Alfredo Cris
tiani for a full investigation of the
killings. In Washington, Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
warned Sunday that U.S. aid to
El Salvador could be curtailed if
Cristiani cannot control right
wing death squads from operating
in the country.
There was virtually no gunfire
in the capital as troops regained
control of the working-class dis
tricts of Zacamil and Metropolis
on the north side and Mejicanos
in the northeast.
The guerrillas, however,
retained their grip on parts of

Soyapango, a working class sub
urb to the east of the capital, and
soldiers said there had been fight
ing throughout the day. Four
helicopter gunships were rocket
ing the area at dusk.
Around the capital, army
patrols moved through the shat

rubble of fighting. On some
streets, several burned bodies
could be seen.

A military news-release gave a
tentative count of nearly 1,000 sol
diers and guerrillas killed since
the rebels launched their nation
wide offensive Nov. 11.
The military said 784 guerrillas
were killed, 527 wounded and 129
captured and government forces
lost 208 killed and 627 wounded.
Radio Venceremos, the
Farabundo Marti National Liber
ation Front's clandestine radio
station, claimed 827 soldiers were
killed or wounded but gave no
breakdown.
Neither side gave an estimate
of casualties among civilians, who
suffered heavily in the block-by
block fighting. The Red Cross said
an estimate was difficult because
many bodies are still in the
streets.
About 800 mourners gathered
for the burial of six Jesuit priests,
their cook and her teen-age

daughter, who were slain Thurs
day and their bodies mutilated.
Cristiani and U.S. Ambassador
William Walker was among those

Rivera Damas said before the
service that "there exists the
vehement presumption that the
murders were committed by mem
bers of the armed forces or people
in intimate connivance with
them."
Later, in his regular Sunday
homily, Rivera Damas called the
rebel offensive "useless and un
justifiable" and said the military
response was "excessive."
He said with the guerrilla with

revenge, repression and witch

Rivera Damas was asked about
a letter sent by Attorney General
Mauricio Colorado to Pope John

be removed from El Salvador for
their own safety. Colorado claimed
the bishops were fomenting vio
