German protests continue
DRESDEN, East Germany (AP) — Tens of
thousands of protesters in at least eight cities
braved icy winds yesterday to keep the heat on
the Communist leadership, despite open borders
and the election of a reform-minded Cabinet one
day earlier.
Nearly 3 million East Germans crossed into
West Berlin and West Germany between Friday
and yesterday, the second weekend since the gov
ernment opened borders to the West, border police
said. Most were just visiting for the day.
Ferry service across the Elbe River, which
forms part of the border, resumed Yesterday at
Hitzacker, about 80 miles southeast of Hamburg,
for the first time since April 23, 1945.
In other changes, the official ADN news agency
reported that the roles of the party and the
government in East Germany's armed forces will
be separated.
Also yesterday, an opposition leader said his
pro-democracy group would hold a convention
next month to establish itself as a formal political
party.
Very old and very far thing found
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Astronomers say
they have discovered the oldest, most faraway
object yet found in the universe, a star-like body
called a quasar about 14 billion light years or
82 trillion billion miles from Earth.
"We've found the most distant object on
record," said astronomer Maarten Schmidt of the
California Institute of Technology. "We are now
seeing an object as it was a little over 1 billion
years after the beginning of the universe."
Other scientists called the discovery significant

because existence of the 14-billion-year-old quasar
challenges a widely accepted theory of how quickly
stars and galaxies formed. And light from the
quasar has illuminated gas in space, possibly
giving astronomers their first look at the primor
dial matter from which all stars, galaxies and
even life eventually arose.
The quasar, or quasi-stellar object, was seen
through the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar
Observatory, northeast of San Diego. It is located
in the constellation Ursa Major just below the
Big Dipper's bowl.
U.S. Ambassador back in Lebanon
EHDEN, Lebanon (AP) — U.S. Ambassador
John McCarthy presented his credentials and
pledged the United States' support for new Pres
ident Rene Mouawad amid joyous parades yes
terday in Syrian-policed northern Lebanon.
The latest U.S. pledge was contained in a mes
sage from President Bush, which McCarthy
handed to Mouawad along with his letter of
credence.
The message also stressed support for an Arab
League-brokered peace pact approved by Parlia
ment at a special session held last month in Taif,
Saudi Arabia, over the objections of Christian
leader Gen. Michel Aoun.
McCarthy, who withdrew in September after
reported threats from Aoun, became the first
foreign diplomat to present his credentials to
Mouawad since Parliament elected the Catholic
lawmaker as president Nov. 5.
It also was the first time in Lebanon's modern
history that a foreign ambassador presented his
credentials outside the traditional seat of the
head of state in Baabda east of Beirut. Aoun
occupies the presidential palace.
