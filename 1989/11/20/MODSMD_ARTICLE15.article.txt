## Intramural intensity 
### 
Attitudes about games
must be relaxed to stop
senseless fights, injuries

SOME PEOPLE think every
game is Big Game.
But the truth is, intra
mural sports are supposed to be
friendly competition. Unfortunate
ly, lately Stanford students have
been playing to win at any cost.
And sometimes the cost is too
high.
Two weekends ago, a team from
the Theta Delta Chi fraternity and
a team from the Graduate School
of Business were involved in a
bench-clearing altercation.
This incident and other serious
incidents reveal an over-intense
style of play: where players dive
for balls and are willing to fight
over the results of the play.
That same weekend, 18 students
were treated for IM-related inju
ries at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter.
A change in the actions and at
titudes of both IM organizers and
players could help reduce this
alarmingly high number.
The first step for IM organizers
is to increase the role of officials
in the game. Currently, officials
serve more as time keepers than
as safety keepers. They must start
to keep close track of how rough
play is becoming and, if necessary,
ask players to take a rest until
they start to play at a more ac
ceptable level of intensity.

In more extreme cases, students
should be asked to leave the game
permanently if it looks like the sit
uation might get out of hand.
Another step is the elimination
of playoffs. Playoffs only reinforce
the notion of the drastic impor
tance of games that should be
played for fun and exercise.
But perhaps most importantly,
the whole IM system must be sensi
tive to safety concerns. They must
take the injuries which occur dur
ing their games seriously and be
willing to change rules or sports
should this trend continue.
Of course, change must come not
only from the organizers of the
games but also from the people
who play them. There's only so
much a rule change can do â€” but
a change in players' attitudes can
do everything.
This suggestion does not imply
that people should relinquish their
desire to win. The thrill of com
petition is one of the reasons why
people play sports.
But there has to be a middle
road. A person can want to win
without being willing to hurt an
other person or risk hurting her
self or himself.
This behavior is found not only
in football but in other sports as
well. Throwing elbows and pushing
players under the goals are not
uncommon in basketball. In any
sport, however, it should not be
allowed.
Let's continue to play IMs, but
let's do so in the spiriFin which
IMs were intended to be played.
After all, it's just a game.
