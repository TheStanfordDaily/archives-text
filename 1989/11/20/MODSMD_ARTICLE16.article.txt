Flier for 'Reggae'party depicts racial stereotypes

lAM WRITING in response to the
fliers that were posted throughout
Rains Apartments advertising Fri
day's "Catch the Reggae Fever" party.
I first became alarmed at the pic
torial representation of the barefoot,
bare-chested man with dreadlocks.
I thought it strange that he should
be without a shirt and shoes but
realized that his hairstyle was chosen
because he is meant to be a ras
tafarian.
I understand that a rastafarian was
chosen because of the reggae music
theme and I wrote off his nudity and
shoelessness to artistic license, but I
can neither understand nor ignore the
reason that he is holding a spear and
shield.
I have never been to the Caribbean
(the generally accepted cradle of reggae
and calypso music), but I am assured
by both Caribbean friends and anthro
pology specialists of the region that

I understand that a rastafarian was chosen because
of the reggae music theme and I wrote off his nudity
and shoelessness to artistic license.

most rastafarians habitually wear
shirts and shoes and in general, the
Caribbean is not composed of hunter
gatherer societies.
And as we well know from recent
actions by the militarist regime in
Haiti, in displays of force, high
powered rifles and submachine guns
are used, not spears and shields.
My question is, why did the artist
choose to include the spear and shield
on the flier?
Not only is it entirely inaccurate and
irrational, but it is yet another depic
tion of a racial stereotype — that of a
black person from a predominantly
black country who is meant to repre-

sent the naked savage who obtains food
and conducts warfare with the aid of a
spear and shield.
I am not denying that there are
some indigenous people of predomi
nantly black countries who use spears
and shields daily, but they are wholly
in the minority.
I am not violently furious at seeing
this flier. Rather, I am saddened for
many reasons, two of which I will
expound.
First, at Stanford in 1989, only
about a week after two black people
set precedents in winning important
and prominent political positions (as

governor of Virginia and mayor of New
York City), 1 am confronted by such a
symbol of racism and abject ignorance.
Second, I am sad because I am not
bitterly furious at the depiction of such
a forceful racial stereotype. It happens
far too frequently for me to become
passionately incensed at each and every
incident.
After all, is this solely my problem?
For the sake of my mental and spiri
tual health, I have learned to, as
patiently as possible, confront the
person responsible for displaying the
stereotype, explain its offensiveness and
spend yet another day trying to come
to terms with the slow, seething acidic
anger which has for 22 years of my
life gnawed within my soul a 9 I am
daily confronted with the unjust treat
ment of oppressed minorities.
