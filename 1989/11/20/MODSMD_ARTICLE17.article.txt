# COP has no right to support pro-choicers in name of students
## 
### 
I am new to Stanford this year and
have much to learn about the workings
of the ASSU and Council of Presidents.
Still, I have not been impressed by
what I've seen so far.
I was particularly disturbed by COP
member Aimee Allison's pledge of COP
support for the Stanford Pro-Choice
Alliance at the Tuesday rally in White
Plaza.
Where does she get off supporting
either side of such an issue in the
name of the students â€” in my name?
Abortion is the most personal and
hotly debated topic in the political

arena today. A representative group
such as the COP has no business
taking sides on such an issue.
Either side can claim to represent
"the majority.'" Did Allison poll the
students to claim her mtyority? If so, I
never participated in such a poll. Or is
she taking her personal opinion and
assuming that she is in touch with the
political mainstream?
No matter what side of the abortion
debate you fall on, I would think that
any student would be concerned at the
liberties the COP are taking with their
positions.
Will the COP soon be decrying birth
control? Will ASSU funds be donated
to the Pro-Choice Alliance? Is big
brother alive and well at Stanford? I
would prefer that the COP concern
itself with student government.
I believe that on such a personal
issue students should be allowed to

speak for themselves rather than risk
the chance of misrepresentation by any
umbrella organization.
