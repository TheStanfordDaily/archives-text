# Ubiquitous green cans around campus make it easy to recycle
## 
### 
I often notice, as I casually stroll by
garbage cans on campus, the amount
of recyclable material which is thought
lessly disposed of.
This includes aluminum cans, glass
bottles, cardboard, loads of white paper
and even old issues of The Daily.
Realizing that a set of green cans for
recyclable materials is probably nearby,

I may even pick up the tossed items
and put them in their rightful place,
that is if they're not too soiled.
Admittedly, my actions alone proba
bly can't do much to reduce the cost
of energy or curb the landfill problem,
but I do what I can.
What I don't understand is why
these items are in the garbage and not
in the green cans.
The Stanford Recycling Center has
made it very convenient to recycle on
campus, at least more than any other
place I've ever been to. Most buildings
seem to have the green cans either
within them or near them.
With the known savings associated
with recycling, such as in energy, natu
ral resources — like trees — and
landfill space, I ask, "Why not
recycle?"
