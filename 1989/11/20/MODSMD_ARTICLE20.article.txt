## Give thanks and then give 
### 
THANKSGIVING is Thursday. Hur
ray! Real food (no offense to Uni
versity Food Service)!
Turkey day is one of my favorite
holidays. It is a time to get together with
family and friends to relax without the
pressure of expectation and disappoint
ment that may accompany gift-giving
holidays.
For many of us, Thanksgiving is a time
spent partaking of great, homecooked
food. I for one cannot wait to eat some
of my mother and grandmother's turkey,
ham, sweet potato pie, stuffing, grits,
fried eggs and collard greens.
I'm sure that many of us will return
to Stanford next week a little chubbier
and much more fulfilled than when we
departed.
Thanksgiving is an important day. It
is one of only a few days of the year
during which we pause to think about
what is important to us and the things
for which we should be thankful.
We, for the most part, have much for
which to be appreciative. Therefore, in
between dinner and the football games,
between chilling with family and friends
and catching up on sleep and between
"All My Children" and school work (yeah,
right!), we should stop to reflect on that
for which we are grateful.
I am thankful to be at Stanford. Really,
the "Farm" is more like a big playground
with all the opportunities that anyone
could ever desire at one's fingertips.
For instance, where else can one receive
an education in a foreign country, get
internships across the nation and around
the world, wage a successful campaign

for a broader curriculum that includes
works by people of color and women,
watch the latest movies in the midst of
a paper-throwing war, attend programs
in which the keynote speaker is a national
or international figure or live in a home
in which your culture and history flourish
like Ujamaa House or Casa Zapata?
Nowhere else but Stanford.
On a related note, I am grateful that
there is a coterminal degree program here
in which one can receive both an under
graduate and graduate degree in five
years. It is a godsend for seniors like me
who are stalling on entering the real world
for as long as possible.
I am thankful for the African-American
community here, which is in many ways
like an extended family. Black people on
this campus come together to support
each other and struggle together for the
common goal of a right to an education
that teaches us about our history and
greatness. ...... , ... .
We also come together to support and
work with our sisters and brothers in
East Palo Alto and South Africa. We are
a family that chills together, whether it
is Thursday evening during "The Cosby
Show" and "A Different World," Friday
noon in White Plaza or any day anywhere
any time for any reason.
I am also appreciative of all those in
the entire community who take a stand
on and defend the ideals in which they
believe.
Thank you, Stanford Pro-Choice Alli
ance, for supporting and defending a
woman's right to choose what is best for
her body.

Thank you, ASSU Council of Presi
dents and student of color organizations,
for not only working actively for a more
multicultural and inclusive University
but for also providing the student body
with much-needed student services and
activities.
Thank you, Lesbian, Gay and Bisexal
Community Center, for providing
speakers in dorms that aim to bring about
awareness and tolerance.
And for all of those other people and
things that I did not mention because of
lack of space — Thank You!
Thanksgiving inspires everyone to
reflect on what is meaningful to all of
us. I hope that it also inspires us to
venture beyond our relative comforts to
possibly take a few hours of our vacation
to give to others who are facing difficult
times.
Soup kitchens and homeless shelters
almost anywhere, I'm sure, would wel
come volunteers to give a helping hand
this weekend.
Spending time with family and friends
and giving of ourselves is, after all, in
the spirit of Thanksgiving.

venture beyond our relative comforts to
possibly take a few hours of our vacation
to give to others who are facing difficult
times.
Soup kitchens and homeless shelters
almost anywhere, I'm sure, would wel
come volunteers to give a helping hand
this weekend.
Spending time with family and friends
and giving of ourselves is, after all, in
the spirit of Thanksgiving.
