In "Miles: The Autobiography," jazz's
premier trumpeter and bandleader
swaggers and struts from bandstand to
bedroom with few breathers in between.
Always one to toot his own horn,
Davis traces his development from naive
bebopper to the father of fusion with
characteristic shamelessness. Though it
may ramble at times, "Miles," written
in conjunction with professor and poet
Quincy Troupe, does so salaciously, al
ways opting to disclose rather than
cover up. And while Davis' prose hardly
matches his lyric trumpet playing,
"Miles" is an eminently approachable,
no-bones journey across social, musical
and racial boundaries.
"Miles" confirms some of the myths
that have developed around Davis, be
ginning with his upper-middle class
upbringing in East St. Louis. While
other jazzmen were playing on Harlem
streetcorners, Davis was avoiding St.
Louis street gangs on his way to go
horseback riding.
It was during these early years that
Davis developed his trademark indepen
dence, partly under the influence of his
father, a successful dentist who dabbled
in politics: "I think I got most of my
attitude, my sense of who I was, my
confidence and race pride from my fath
er ... He didn't take no shit off nobody."
Davis moved to New York during the
war to attend Juilliard and plug into
the Harlem music scene. Once there,
he refused to accept the European bias
of his Juilliard instructors, especially
heating up when one music historian
asserted that the blues was simply
blacks' response to their poverty. Davis
shot back, "My father didn't never pick
no cotton and I didn't wake up this
morning sad and start playing the
blues." Outside of the Juilliard class
rooms, he spent his first week and his
first month's allowance seeking out
Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie on
the streets of Harlem.
Within a few months, he had dropped
out of Juilliard and was playing trumpet
in Parker's band, though still intrigued
by issues of formal music theory. When
not playing with Gillespie and Parker,
he pored over scores by Stravinsky, Berg
and Prokofiev in a public library.
And gradually he found what his
father deemed the prerequisite for suc
cess in the music world: "your own
sound." Soon white critics began to ad

mire his evocative lyricism, his some
times ecstatic, sometimes bluesy and
always personal style.
Playing Gil Evans' mainstream ar
rangements during the "Birth of the
Cool" sessions in 1949, Davis moved
away from the bebop tradition of his
tutors. Unlike the beboppers, he rarely
exploded into quick runs and instead
made his trumpet wail and plead like
a hangdog lover, with all the expres
siveness of a human voice.
Riding high on critical acclaim, Davis
embarked on a tour of France, finding
time to hobnob with Jean-Paul Sartre
("we had a great time just sitting around
talking. . .at an outside cafe"). Davis
stayed, and spent April in Paris falling
in love with cabaret star Juliette Greco,
though music was their only common
language.
However "Miles" also chronicles the
darker side of Davis' struggle with new
found celebrity, including the beginning
of his heroin use. Soon, like other jazz
greats, he was addicted. Drug habits
like Davis' are the rule, not the excep
tion in "Miles," and the narrative is
punctuated by passages of remorse for
friends whose drug abuse ultimately
ruined them: Parker, Freddie Webster,
Fats Navarro, Billie Holiday, John
Coltrane and Bill Evans, to name but
a few. By the Davis had
kicked his heroin habit but started flirt
ing with cocaine.
Nevertheless, "Miles" celebrates
Davis' work in the late '50s, when

'Music has always been
like a curse with me be
cause I have always felt
driven to play it. It has
always been the first
thing in my life and it still
is. It comes before every
thing. But I've made a
kind of peace with my
musical demons that al
lows me to live a more
relaxed life .. .The
demons are still there,
but now I know that
they're there and when
they want to be fed.'

Coltrane and Philly Joe Jones be
came active forces in his quintet,
pioneering a looser, more rebellious
sound. In the '60s, his image as
rebel began to frustrate critics who,
according to Davis, "started putting
me down because they didn't know
what I was doing." His album sales
declined and critics complained as
Davis forayed into "harder" jazz and
traded in his Brooks Brothers suits
for hippiewear.
With the release of "Bitches Brew,"
Davis astounded critics with a new
blend of rock and jazz and momentar-i
ily recaptured the public's fancy.
Though the rock-jazz fusion genre
he helped to found during these years
endures, Davis himself has since
receded into the background, and
"Miles" ends on a blue note. Rela
tively recent excursions into Sly
Stone-style funk and
synthesizer-heavy jazz have met with
critical favor, but have stirred little
public interest. According to Davis,
the most recent generation of teen
agers recognize him most for his ap
pearance in a Honda scooter
commercial.

Though he may be approaching
senior citizen status, Davis does
not seem to have mellowed
with age. Throughout "Miles," /
his tone remains unapologetic, At
especially with regard


to racial and sexual politics.
He assails the media with par
ticular fury, exculpating few (like
jazz writers Leonard Feather and
Ralph Gleason) and condemning
the multitude of mostly white
critics. "White people," Davis
writes, "always try to take credit
for something after they discover
it. Like it wasn't happening before
they found out about it — which
most times is always late, and
they didn't have nothing to do
with it happening." But while
Davis bashes his critics, he also
clutters his text with his critical
laurels, as if to suggest "I didn't
want them, but they gave them
to me anyway."
Many readers may find his
sexism distasteful. He glosses over
his callous treatment of Irene, the
high school girlfriend who trailed
him to New York with a child. He
beats another one of his
girlfriends and admits to taking
photographs of women — not his
wife — in indiscreet poses. During
the '70s he claims to have "had

so many different women that. ..
I probably wouldn't even recog
nize most of them."
Justifying his hyperactive sex
life, Davis mixes the rhetoric of
the sexual revolution with a
strong twist of artistic arrogance:
"All I was doing was what my
imagination told me to do ... I
was doing it in private and wasn't
hurting nobody else, and the
women I was with loved it as
much as or more than I did."
But if "Miles" is sexist, sordid
and relentlessly egotistical, it is
still an uncensored account of the
jazz highlife. Davis' portraits of
jazz giants — from the delirious
Bird to the solemn Monk to the
spiritual Coltrane — resonate
with an intimacy that few could
lay claim to. And while Davis the
artist seems to hide behind a
smokescreen of frank arrogance,
"Miles: The Autobiography" will
probably serve as the definitive
text on jazz's pied piper for many
years to come.
