Charles Mingus was a crazy hepcat, a revolu
tionary coolster who amused himself by stick
ing his fingers in electric sockets. A similar
power surges through both his music and
"Mingus/Mingus," a personable biography of
the late jazz composer.
In "Mingus/Mingus," Janet Coleman and A 1
Young work hard to reconcile the flip sides of

"Baron" Min
gus' larger
than-life im
age: sensitive
artiste and
nightclub
brawler.
Friends of
Mingus for
the last 20
years of his
life, Coleman
and Young are
sympathetic
to his eccen
tricities, but

resist the temptation to lionize one of jazz's
most notorious figures.
Never known for his saintliness, Mingus
matched his musical daring with an incendiary
temper legendary on the club circuit. He in
timidated personal friends and musical
enemies alike with his gargantuan frame and
substantial girth, and his sidemen performed
under threat of being battered by their disap
pointed bandleader.
Coleman and Young describe how Mingus
refused to be pigeonholed as simply a jazz
artist. They recount with affection his experi
ments with film, folk-rock, and poetry, and
his collaborations with Timothy Leary, Joni
Mitchell and even his psychoanalyst.
As a composer, Mingus seems to have had
an inexhaustible talent for improvisation, and
Coleman and Young capture the spirit behind
his music: a strong sense of tradition alter
nately manhandled, pummeled and reshaped
by innovation.
In the end, as one friend remembers, Mingus
may have stuck his hand in one too many
sockets, may have "burned too bright." But
Coleman and Young do well to rediscover the
Mingus dynasty. Their memoirs, like the man
himself, are untraditional and personal, a vi
brant jigsaw puzzle of interlocking recollec
tions.
