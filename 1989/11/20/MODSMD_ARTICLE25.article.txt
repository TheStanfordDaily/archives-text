# Inside the lives of Josephine Baker and Lionel Hampton
## Authors bring out the jazz of the past

"Corruption, lack of morality
â€” it's in the air," writes jazz
great Lionel Hampton in his new
autobiography, "Conservatism is
the only way to get back on the
right track." Clearly, "Hamp: An
Autobiography," written with
James Haskins, is about a very
different kind of jazz hero.
Published by Warner Books,
"Hamp" is the story of the ir
repressible Lionel Hampton's
rise to prominence from his
humble beginnings in Louisville,
Kentucky.
It is Hampton's tale of growing
up in Chicago during the '20s,
learning to play the vibraphone,
and meeting musicians like Jelly
Roll Morton, Jimmy Noone,
Freddie Keppert, Mugsy Spanier
and Bessie Smith.
He gives us an insider's view
of the Jazz Age, a time when A 1
Capone was the "saviour of the
black musician," employing hun
dreds in his nightclubs, and
when black and white jazz
players listened to each other's
music but could not play to
gether in public. He describes
his years with the Benny Good
man Orchestra as "some of the
best," though he was constantly
being mistaken for Goodman's
valet or water boy while on tour.
Hampton contrasts this with
his later rise to wealth and pres
tige, which he mostly attributes

to his wife and manager Gladys.
Hampton explains with obvious
delight how he became Richard
Nixon's assistant campaign man
ager when the California lawyer
first ran for Congress, and how
he seemingly singlehandedly put
George Bush on the Reagan
ticket in 1980. And he shows
how he has become involved
philanthropically in building
housing for the poor.
Throughout his narrative,
Hampton pays tribute to Louis
Armstrong, Gene Krupa, Buddy
Rich, Nat King Cole, Ella
Fitzgerald and Josephine Baker.
He savors his memories of play
ing with Billie Holliday in 1942,
jamming with a young Miles
Davis, and giving Dinah Wash
ington (nee Ruth Jones) her
stage name.
Ending with an awe-inspiring
100-page discography of
Hampton'B work alone and with
some of the greatest names in
jazz, "Hamp" is a name
dropping, folksy tour through
the jazz hall of fame.
"Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine
Baker in Her Time" is a just
published biography of the black
singer and dancer who became
one of the best-known American
stars of the Parisian theater in
the post-World War I period.

Written by Phyllis Rose, the
author of "Woman of Letters: A
Life of Virginia Woolf" and
"Parallel Lives: Five Victorian
Marriages," "Jazz Cleopatra" is
a revealing look at both Baker's
life and the interplay of French
and American cultures.
Baker, who mixed cross-eyed
and campy poses with her heavy
lidded sensuality, first appeared
in Paris in 1925. Her starring
role in the "Revue Nfcgre"
shocked and titillated Parisian
crowds, who saw in her
"African" dancing a version of
their own colonial empire, "a
world that was both mysterious
and sexually available, alien yet
subject."
Rose attempts to go beyond
the boundaries of ordinary biog
raphy by placing Baker in a full

cultural context and as part of
a larger historical trajectory. Her
book is filled with passages relat
ing Baker to broader cultural
movements and trends, includ
ing PrimitiviBm and the '20s
French interest in African art.
Rose paints a vivid portrait of
Baker's life and adventures dur
ing World War 11, when she en
tertained French troops with
Maurice Chevalier, eventually
escaping to North Africa, where
she conducted espionage for the
French resistance, winning her
De Gaulle's admiration and grat
itude.
Rose also describes Baker's
later efforts in the American
civil rights movement, including
her involvement in the Willie
McGee case and the trial of the
Trenton Six. Rose details Baker's
hope for racial equality that led
her to create a model Utopian
community on the grounds of a
renovated chateau in the Dor
dogne region of France and to
adopt twelve children from
around the world, who she
referred to as her Rainbow
Tribe.
Throughout, Baker's book is
an insightful portrait of the
woman Josephine Baker and a
revealing look at one of the
lesser-known figures of the post
war transatlantic cultural
dialogue.
