The game began with
the sun shining Satur
day and ended in
darkness for the Cali
fornia Golden Bears. For the
Axe-wielding Stanford Cardinal,
Tommy Vardell (44) and Scott
Eschelman (34) teamed with
J.J. Lasley to provide a Stan
ford running attack that
slashed away at the Cal defense
in the 24-14 slaughter. Mean
while, Ed McCaffrey (40) was
king as he accounted for more
than half of Stanford's receiv
ing yards. The Cardinal mixed
an effective offense with a
spirited defense and left the
Bears lost in a maze, closing
out the '89 season with a
sharp edge for next year.
