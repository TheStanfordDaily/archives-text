## Card steals momentum from Cal 
### 
As a high school senior in
New York five years ago,
Big Game didn't mean a
whole lot to me. As a matter of
fact, on the East Coast the
average fan does not even realize
it's one of those season-ending
rivalry games like Michigan-Ohio
State, Army-Navy or USC-UCLA.

Knowledge of the game is so
scant buck East that "The Play"
is known as the Stanford Lateral
Play to many. But then,
easterners think Stanford is in
Connecticut — they're sometimes
hard to take too seriously.
Now that I've called the West
Coast home for a half decade, I
know how truly great the Big
Game rivalry is.
While the games haven't meant
much in determining the bowl pic

ture recently, the lore surrounding
the game grows each year as Tuan
Van Le blocks a last-second field
goal to preserve a tie or the Car
dinal comes out wearing all red.
Perhaps the only drawback to
all the stories about the Axe, the
Immortal 21 or how a squad of
Stanford neophytes beat a much
more accomplished crew from Cal
ifornia in the first Big Game is
they detract from the contest at
hand.
Saturday, Stanford did what it
wanted on the football field, came
away with a win and got a strong
feeling the team had turned the
corner. True, the game marked
the end of the Cardinal's third
losing season in a row. It's equally
true Stanford has been to a bowl
game but once in the '80s.
At the same time, though, the
game may really have been the
start of something big. For those
too young to remember, Stanford
was once a football power. The
Cardinal went from 1964 to 1980
without having a single losing
season and won four bowl games
(including two Rose Bowls) during
that span.
Coach Denny Green plans on
starting another similarly suc
cessful era here. He talks of Stan
ford teams filled with All-

the '88 season opti
mistic about being in
10 of 11 games it was
one thing. Today, the
Cardinal closes out
the '89 campaign
drooling over the
prospect of having
the best running back
corps in the confer
ence next year.

Americans and future pro players.
Green doesn't talk about these
teams in the abstract, either. He
served as an assistant when such
teams played in Stanford Stadi
um. When the James Loftons and
the John Elways wore the Cardi
nal and White.
A 3-8 record in his first season
notwithstanding, Green seems
likely to get the job done. I know,
you're sitting there reading this

and mumbling: "I've heard it all
before. I'll believe it when I see it."
Fair enough, but take a quick
look at what Green has accom
plished already:
He has completely revamped
Stanford's offensive and defensive
systems and the payoff began to

show up at the end of the season.
While in the past the Cardinal
had a base defense that was
modified only slightly each week,
now defensive coordinator Fred
vonAppen produces a new scheme
for each game.
The results of this approach
have been a bit uneven. At times,
Stanford looked like a world
beater in shutting down Notre
Dame; occasionally the Cardinal

resembled a sieve in allowing 40
points to San Jose State.
But in the bigger picture, it
would be hard to find a Stanford
defender who has questioned the
changes. As for the lapses, they'll
tell you that any major overhaul
will' result in occasional break
downs and that things are certain
to improve next year.
Offensively, the future is repre
sented by Bob Whitfield. A 300-

pound tackle, Whitfield illustrates
the Green mentality in microcosm.
First of all, he's NFL and All-
America material. Second, he's
going to help Stanford run the
ball — and run it well — in the
coming years.
When Stanford ended the '88
season optimistic about being in
10 of 11 games it was one thing.
Today, the Cardinal closes out the
'89 campaign drooling over the

prospect of having the best run
ning back corps in the conference
next year. With Jon Volpe, J.J.
Lasley, Glyn Milburn, Ellery
Roberts, Tommy Vardell and
Charlie Young to carry the ball
next year, Stanford will run very
successfully indeed.
A dozen of Green's 20 recruits
saw action this past year and
many contributed. For 1990,
Green hopes to bring in a" defen

sive lineman who can have a
Whitfield-like impact. He's also
looking for a quarterback with a
shot at winning the starting job
outright as a freshman.
Recruiting, which Green's
predecessor Jack Elway called 80
percent of the job, is an area where
Stanford looks to make up a lot
of ground in a hurry. In February,
it'll become clearer just how much
magic Green can work.

Saturday, Stanford did what it
wanted on the football field, came
away with a win and got a strong
feeling the team had turned the
corner. True, the game marked
the end of the Cardinal's third
losing season in a row. It's equally
true Stanford has been to a bowl
game but once in the '80s.
At the same time, though, the
game may really have been the
start of something big. For those
too young to remember, Stanford
was once a football power. The
Cardinal went from 1964 to 1980
without having a single losing
season and won four bowl games
(including two Rose Bowls) during
that span.

and mumbling: "I've heard it all
before. I'll believe it when I see it."
Fair enough, but take a quick
look at what Green has accom
plished already:
He has completely revamped
Stanford's offensive and defensive
systems and the payoff began to

show up at the end of the season.
While in the past the Cardinal
had a base defense that was
modified only slightly each week,
now defensive coordinator Fred
vonAppen produces a new scheme
for each game.
The results of this approach
have been a bit uneven. At times,
Stanford looked like a world
beater in shutting down Notre
Dame; occasionally the Cardinal

resembled a sieve in allowing 40
points to San Jose State.
But in the bigger picture, it
would be hard to find a Stanford
defender who has questioned the
changes. As for the lapses, they'll
tell you that any major overhaul
will' result in occasional break
downs and that things are certain
to improve next year.
Offensively, the future is repre
sented by Bob Whitfield. A 300-

pound tackle, Whitfield illustrates
the Green mentality in microcosm.
First of all, he's NFL and All-
America material. Second, he's
going to help Stanford run the
ball — and run it well — in the
coming years.
When Stanford ended the '88
season optimistic about being in

Today, the Cardinal closes out the
'89 campaign drooling over the

prospect of having the best run

next year. With Jon Volpe, J.J.
Lasley, Glyn Milburn, Ellery
Roberts, Tommy Vardell and
Charlie Young to carry the ball
next year, Stanford will run very
successfully indeed.
A dozen of Green's 20 recruits
saw action this past year and
many contributed. For 1990,
Green hopes to bring in a" defen

sive lineman who can have a
Whitfield-like impact. He's also
looking for a quarterback with a
shot at winning the starting job
outright as a freshman.
Recruiting, which Green's
predecessor Jack Elway called 80
percent of the job, is an area where
Stanford looks to make up a lot
of ground in a hurry. In February,
it'll become clearer just how much
magic Green can work.
As a high school senior in
New York five years ago,
Big Game didn't mean a
whole lot to me. As a matter of
fact, on the East Coast the
average fan does not even realize
it's one of those season-ending
rivalry games like Michigan-Ohio
State, Army-Navy or USC-UCLA.

Knowledge of the game is so
scant buck East that "The Play"
is known as the Stanford Lateral
Play to many. But then,
easterners think Stanford is in
Connecticut — they're sometimes
hard to take too seriously.
Now that I've called the West
Coast home for a half decade, I
know how truly great the Big
Game rivalry is.
While the games haven't meant
much in determining the bowl pic

ture recently, the lore surrounding
the game grows each year as Tuan
Van Le blocks a last-second field
goal to preserve a tie or the Car
dinal comes out wearing all red.
