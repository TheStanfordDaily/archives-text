## Card steals momentum from Cal 
### 
As a high school senior in
New York five years ago,
Big Game didn't mean a
whole lot to me. As a matter of
fact, on the East Coast the
average fan does not even realize
it's one of those season-ending
rivalry games like Michigan-Ohio
State, Army-Navy or USC-UCLA.

Knowledge of the game is so
scant buck East that "The Play"
is known as the Stanford Lateral
Play to many. But then,
easterners think Stanford is in
Connecticut â€” they're sometimes
hard to take too seriously.
Now that I've called the West
Coast home for a half decade, I
know how truly great the Big
Game rivalry is.
While the games haven't meant
much in determining the bowl pic

ture recently, the lore surrounding
the game grows each year as Tuan
Van Le blocks a last-second field
goal to preserve a tie or the Car
dinal comes out wearing all red.
Perhaps the only drawback to
all the stories about the Axe, the
Immortal 21 or how a squad of
Stanford neophytes beat a much
more accomplished crew from Cal
ifornia in the first Big Game is
they detract from the contest at
hand.
Saturday, Stanford did what it
wanted on the football field, came
away with a win and got a strong
feeling the team had turned the
corner. True, the game marked
the end of the Cardinal's third
losing season in a row. It's equally
true Stanford has been to a bowl
game but once in the '80s.
At the same time, though, the
game may really have been the
start of something big. For those
too young to remember, Stanford
was once a football power. The
Cardinal went from 1964 to 1980
without having a single losing
season and won four bowl games
(including two Rose Bowls) during
that span.
Coach Denny Green plans on
starting another similarly suc
cessful era here. He talks of Stan
ford teams filled with All-

When Stanford ended
the '88 season opti
mistic about being in
10 of 11 games it was
one thing. Today, the
Cardinal closes out
the '89 campaign
drooling over the
prospect of having
the best running back
corps in the confer
ence next year.

Americans and future pro players.
Green doesn't talk about these
teams in the abstract, either. He
served as an assistant when such
teams played in Stanford Stadi
um. When the James Loftons and
the John Elways wore the Cardi
nal and White.
A 3-8 record in his first season
notwithstanding, Green seems
likely to get the job done. I know,
you're sitting there reading this
