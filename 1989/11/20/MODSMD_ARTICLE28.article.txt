# Mastalir, Gray run for individual titles
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
A good cross-country runner
has a strong kick at the finish.
Stanford runners Eric Mas
talir and Carol Gray look to
put a powerful kick on the end
of their Stanford cross-country
careers today as they race at
the the NCAA Championships
today in Annapolis, Md.
Both seniors have had good
seasons, yet they feel they have
something left to prove today.
Gray has raced in front at
the Pacific 10 Conference and
district championships, but
was unable to hold the lead.
As a four-time All-American,
she has high expectations to
live up to.
Her game plan for any meet
is simple. "I race for the win,"
said Gray. Today it will mean
going to the front pack and
moving up steadily.
Mastalir, by contrast, is
making his first trip to the na
tional championship meet. He
has battled the jinx that seems
to befall top high school
recruits in college and has one
last shot to prove himself
against the nation's best.
Last year, he finished out of
the money at the qualifying
meet with an injured ham
string. This year "he is 80 per
cent," according to Coach Scott
Chisam.
Mastalir will follow the strat
egy that has predominated
Stanford's tactics this year —
go out fast and hang on. "My
goal is to be an All-American,"
he said.
Mastalir has only raced in
the big meets this year, finish
ing third at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships at home and sixth at
the District-8 Meet.
He is the first Cardinal ath

lete to represent the men at
the NCAA meet since 1986,
when Mark Oelsen went with
the Stanford team and finished
third.
This year the team was close
but finished third in the
District-8 meet. Last year there
were three teams from the dis
trict, but this time only two
went.
The entire Pac-10 will be
hoping its representatives do
well enough to get back the
extra spot for the league.
Chisam has high hopes for
his two entrants. Their chances
of becoming Ail-Americans are
"very good," according to
Chisam. "The people they've
been running with all year will
be All-American."
The only potential problem
is health, with Mastalir avoid
ing his nagging injuries and
Gray experiencing pain in her
foot during practice.
Gray has one big advantage
going into this race — experi
ence. "My mistake last year
[when she finished 19th] was
that I didn't go out fast enough
and I got boxed in."
She finished 19th at the
NCAA meet in 17:07 last year,
but has a track and field best
of 16:18.8 in the 5,000 meters.
She was also an All-American,
an honor given to the top
twenty-five American finish
ers, as a freshman.
This year Gray almost
missed the cut-off. She missed
a guaranteed spot at the
District-8 Championships, but
was awarded one of a handful
of at-large berths.
"She was really disappointed
at regionals," Chisam said. "At
the NCAAs, she will get out
with the first 10-15 people."
"The most important thing,"
said Gray, "is to run my best."
