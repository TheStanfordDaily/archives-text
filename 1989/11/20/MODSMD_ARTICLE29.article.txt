# Championship hopes abound
## Stanford sinks No. 1 Cal in Big Splash 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
It might be called "The Big
Splash," but you could not have
asked for a bigger game.
Nearly 2,000 people took a
break in their tailgating and
jammed in and around deGuerre
Pool Saturday to watch the No.
4 Stanford water polo team defeat
No.l California 8-7.
In a game that meant little to
California, but had huge implica
tions to Stanford, the Cardinal
was able to score effectively on
its man-up situations while sti
fling Bear super star Chris Hum
bert and win a game that
managed to present every aspect
of a collegiate contest.

The game had everything â€”
two highly ranked teams playing
for the type of bragging rights
that only go with the best of
rivalries, a divided crowd of ener
getic and rowdy fans, ejections of
both a player and a fan, and most
importantly, what turned out to
be an exciting and entertaining
contest.
What is more, the game actually
meant something. The win im
pressed the NCAA seedings com
mittee enough to propel the
Cardinal (26-7) past Pepperdine
(losers to No. 5 Cal-State Long
Beach) and into the No. 3 seeding
at the NCAA tournament in In
dianapolis, Ind., which begins Fri
day.
Stanford finishes 4-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, while Cal
won the Pac-10 with a 5-1 mark.
Although Saturday's victory over
the Bears did not impact the Pac
-10 standings, it was a good tuneup
for the NCAA tournament. Cali
fornia, at 24-3 and the defending

national champions, is still the
top seed in the NCAA Tournament
and will be the team to beat.
"This [win] gives us lots of mo
mentum," Erik Blum said. "Con
fidence wise this is excellent for
us."
"This shows us that we are
definitely contenders against
anyone we play against," Senior
Ail-American goalie Todd Kemp
followed.
As this games shows, that in
cludes top-ranked and defending
national champion California.
The Bears are a big, physical
team, but found out that the

muscle that helped them win their
last 11 games can hurt them as
well, as six of the eight Stanford
goals were penalty-related. Actu
ally the whole game seemed
penalty-related.
California showed its physical
side just 1:16 into the game when
Rich Ambridge fouled Colin Keely
from behind and set up a four
meter penalty shot that Jeff
Oeding converted for his 44th goal
of the season. California tied the
game two minutes later in exactly
the same fashion. Steve Millham
fouled a driving Chris Humbert,
and Humbert scored easily on the

ensuing penalty shot.
Two four-meter penalties back
to-back is rare, but wound up
being prophetic of things to come.
It was obvious the referees were
in control of this game.
"They just wanted to assert
themselves as refs," Junior Chuck
Maguy said. "[Call has a history
of physical games. They just
wanted to keep it fair."
California's Rich Ambridge
found this out the hard way, as
his ejection from the game set up
the second Stanford goal.
