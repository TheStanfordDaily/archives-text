# $1 million ethnic studies grant
## Irvine money to fund course development, revision 
### Ari Richter Staff writer 
In an effort to improve Stan
ford's multicultural curriculum,
the James Irvine Foundation has
given the University a $1 million
grant.
The money, which will be used
over a six-year period, will enable
Stanford to develop three new
courses and revise three others
each year. All of these courses will
focus specifically on ethnic minor
ities, according to Dean of Under
graduate Studies Thomas Wasow,
who will administer the grant.
The project coordinator for the
grant, Asst. Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies Charles Junkerman,
explained that about 60 percent
of the grant will be spent on
salaries for visiting scholars who
will teach the new courscs. The
rest of the money will be used for
course development and revision,
Junkerman said.
Junkerman added that al
though the grant will not be used
to hire tenure-line professors,
bringing in academic visitors "will
[establish) contacts, [after which]

a department might make an offer
of tenure."
Junkerman also said the
visitors brought in by the grant
should serve as "energizers,"
aiding the process of change in
both the undergraduate and grad
uate curricula.
Leaders of two minority student
groups responded to news of the
grant similarly. Asian American
Students Association Chair Joe
Park and MEChA Chair Leticia
Valadez both said the grant
"sounds great," but tempered
their responses by noting that the
money will not be used to hire
full-time ethnic studies profes
sors.
Citing a drop-off in University
support for the Chicano Fellows
program, Valadez reiterated her
organization's belief that a neces
sary component of multicul
turalism is the full-time repre
sentation of ethnic groups on the
faculty.
Junkerman noted that the Uni
versity's "minority groups will be
consulted as broadly as possible,
both in the initial brainstorming

and as the six years go by."
Wasow explained that the
benefits of the grant will not be
recognized until at least next year.
After "a faculty committee issues
a call for proposals," Wasow said,
interested faculty will be able tc
submit budgets for new or revised
courses, and the committee will
then decide how to allocate the
funds of the grant.
In April, the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues report
called for "at least six new [ethnic
studies] courses and the modifi
cation of six existing courses per
year over the next three years."
According to Acting Assoc.
Provost Cecilia Burciaga, who
served on the committee, the dis
crepancy in numbers between the
committee's report and the
planned implementation of the
grant "is not important."
"The Irvine grant is going to
go a long way in enhancing cur
riculum development," Burciaga
said. "What is important is to get
people talking about racial issues,
and we are so fortunate to have
the .. . grant."
