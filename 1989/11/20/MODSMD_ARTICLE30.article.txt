## Cardinal volleyball clinches second place despite loss 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
Splitting with the Washington
schools this weekend was not ex
actly what Stanford women's vol
leyball Coach Don Shaw had in
mind. Nonetheless, Friday night's
loss at the hands of the 13th
ranked Washington Huskies
doesn't hurt the Cardinal.
By defeating the lowly Cougars
of Washington State yesterday af
ternoon, Stanford equaled Wash
ington's 13-5 Pacific 10 Confer
ence record and finishes tied for
second at the end of the regular
season.

Because the two teams will
likely be the second and third
seeds in the upcoming NCAA re
gional tournament, Stanford and
Washington will likely face each
other in the semifinals should
each team win its opening-round
contest. The same scenario, how
ever, would have been true had
Stanford won Friday's match.
"At times we played very, very
well," Shaw said of the Washing
ton match. "But that was just at
times. We didn't put a consistent
effort together. We didn't take ad
vantage of the oppurtunity
(Washington) gave us. We didn't
jump on them and win that first
game. I felt that was the match
right there."
In the first game, Stanford
fought back from 10-3 down to
the Huskies to take a 14-11 lead.
After the Cardinal took a 2-0 early
lead, Washington went up 6-2 on
strong passing and blocking.
At 10-4 Washington, Shaw sub
stituted junior setter Karen An
derson and senior hitter Jennifer
Chaffee for starting setter Carrie
Feldman and hitter Jessica Ben
ton. Chaffee and Anderson

sparked a 7-1 Stanford streak that
pulled the Cardinal to within a
point of winning the first game.
After the teams traded sideouts,
Washington won four straight
points to gain a game point at
15-14. Stanford hitter Kristin
Klein then won a crucial sideout
when she killed a ball deep into
the Husky backcourt.
The Cardinal again responded
to the Washington challenge by
winning two points to get another
game point at 16-15. But the
teams traded a pair of sideouts
and Washington won two points
to go up 17-16. The Huskies won
18-16 when Stanford was called
for touching the net.
"That's the fourth match . . .
where we've been down 14-10 or
14-11 against good teams, battled
back and won the game, and often
times turned the momentum in
our favor," Washington Coach
Debbie Buse said. "It's a big win
for us, but we've never had trou
ble getting up to play Stanford.
There's something about Stanford
that we love to come out and com
pete hard."
"We did a great job of fighting
back (in game one)," Shaw said.
"Chaffee and Anderson came in
and really sparked us and did
some nice things. When you're
down 10-3 and you come back to
14-11 you've got to close the door.
You just can't let a team like
(Washington) get another
chance."
Stanford performed better in
game two but the Huskies pulled
away from a 7-6 lead to win 15-7.
The Cardinal then won the third
game on the strong hitting of
freshman middle blocker Bev
Oden. The 15-4 game three vic
tory, didn't propel Stanford
enough as the Cardinal again fal
tered late in game four. Shaw
again substituted Chaffee and An
derson when Stanford was down
12-6, but the duo couldn't pull
the Cardinal back a second time.
The Cardinal rebounded yester

day with a strong performance
against Washington State, which
entered the contest with the Pac
10's worst overall record at 8-26.
Stanford was able to overcome
some inconsistent play in the first
game to defeat the Cougars. Stan
ford took an early 6-3 lead but
mental errors allowed Washington
State to fight back.
After two Stanford reception er
rors, the Cougars took a 13-11
lead. But that was as close to
victory as Shaw's troops were will
ing to allow Washington State to
come. Stanford won the final four
points to win 15-13.
Stanford hit .314 for the match
while holding the Cougars to a
mere .094. Senior captain Laura
Olesen led the team with a .636
hitting percentage and Chaffee
and sophomore Amy Cooper each
hit .500.
"I thought we did a pretty good
job," Shaw said of yesterday's vic
tory. "We were able to bring in
people who don't ordinarily get a
chance (to play) and they did a
nice job."
In the third game of the match
Shaw brought in sophomore hitter
Jodi Birk and debuted sophomore
hitter Jennifer Jackson.
Card notes
Yesterday's match was the final
regular season home match for Stan
ford and the Cardinal said farewell
to three graduating seniors. Shaw pre
sented Olesen, Chaffee and setter
Lara Asper with a bouquet of roses
and hugged each. Asper missed the
majority of this season with a back
injury. If you're sorry you missed the
farewell performance of these three
outstanding seniors, you're in luck.
The Cardinal will host at least one
match during the NCAA regional
tournament.
In Friday's match against Washing
ton, Olesen set a Stanford career
record in block assists. Olesen now
has 419 total block assists, which puts
former Stanford star Kim Oden in
second place with 412 block assists.

to go up 17-16. The Huskies won
18-16 when Stanford was called
for touching the net.
"That's the fourth match . . .
where we've been down 14-10 or
14-11 against good teams, battled
back and won the game, and often
times turned the momentum in
our favor," Washington Coach
Debbie Buse said. "It's a big win
for us, but we've never had trou
ble getting up to play Stanford.
There's something about Stanford
that we love to come out and com
pete hard."
"We did a great job of fighting
back (in game one)," Shaw said.
"Chaffee and Anderson came in
and really sparked us and did
some nice things. When you're
down 10-3 and you come back to
14-11 you've got to close the door.
You just can't let a team like
(Washington) get another
chance."
Stanford performed better in
game two but the Huskies pulled
away from a 7-6 lead to win 15-7.
The Cardinal then won the third
game on the strong hitting of
freshman middle blocker Bev
Oden. The 15-4 game three vic
tory, didn't propel Stanford
enough as the Cardinal again fal
tered late in game four. Shaw
again substituted Chaffee and An
derson when Stanford was down
12-6, but the duo couldn't pull
the Cardinal back a second time.
The Cardinal rebounded yester

day with a strong performance
against Washington State, which
entered the contest with the Pac
10's worst overall record at 8-26.
Stanford was able to overcome
some inconsistent play in the first
game to defeat the Cougars. Stan
ford took an early 6-3 lead but
mental errors allowed Washington
State to fight back.
After two Stanford reception er
rors, the Cougars took a 13-11
lead. But that was as close to
victory as Shaw's troops were will
ing to allow Washington State to
come. Stanford won the final four
points to win 15-13.
Stanford hit .314 for the match
while holding the Cougars to a
mere .094. Senior captain Laura
Olesen led the team with a .636
hitting percentage and Chaffee
and sophomore Amy Cooper each
hit .500.
"I thought we did a pretty good
job," Shaw said of yesterday's vic
tory. "We were able to bring in
people who don't ordinarily get a
chance (to play) and they did a
nice job."
In the third game of the match
Shaw brought in sophomore hitter
Jodi Birk and debuted sophomore
hitter Jennifer Jackson.
Card notes
Yesterday's match was the final
regular season home match for Stan
ford and the Cardinal said farewell
to three graduating seniors. Shaw pre
sented Olesen, Chaffee and setter
Lara Asper with a bouquet of roses
and hugged each. Asper missed the
majority of this season with a back
injury. If you're sorry you missed the
farewell performance of these three
outstanding seniors, you're in luck.
The Cardinal will host at least one
match during the NCAA regional
tournament.
In Friday's match against Washing
ton, Olesen set a Stanford career
record in block assists. Olesen now
has 419 total block assists, which puts
former Stanford star Kim Oden in
second place with 412 block assists.

Sophomore Kristin Klein lunges for a dig Friday against Washington, while Bev Oden looks on.
Splitting with the Washington
schools this weekend was not ex
actly what Stanford women's vol
leyball Coach Don Shaw had in
mind. Nonetheless, Friday night's
loss at the hands of the 13th
ranked Washington Huskies
doesn't hurt the Cardinal.
By defeating the lowly Cougars
of Washington State yesterday af
ternoon, Stanford equaled Wash
ington's 13-5 Pacific 10 Confer
ence record and finishes tied for
second at the end of the regular
season.

Because the two teams will
likely be the second and third
seeds in the upcoming NCAA re
gional tournament, Stanford and
Washington will likely face each
other in the semifinals should
each team win its opening-round
contest. The same scenario, how
ever, would have been true had
Stanford won Friday's match.
"At times we played very, very
well," Shaw said of the Washing
ton match. "But that was just at
times. We didn't put a consistent
effort together. We didn't take ad
vantage of the oppurtunity
(Washington) gave us. We didn't
jump on them and win that first
game. I felt that was the match
right there."
In the first game, Stanford
fought back from 10-3 down to
the Huskies to take a 14-11 lead.
After the Cardinal took a 2-0 early
lead, Washington went up 6-2 on
strong passing and blocking.
At 10-4 Washington, Shaw sub
stituted junior setter Karen An
derson and senior hitter Jennifer
Chaffee for starting setter Carrie
Feldman and hitter Jessica Ben
ton. Chaffee and Anderson

sparked a 7-1 Stanford streak that
pulled the Cardinal to within a
point of winning the first game.
After the teams traded sideouts,
Washington won four straight
points to gain a game point at
15-14. Stanford hitter Kristin
Klein then won a crucial sideout
when she killed a ball deep into
the Husky backcourt.
The Cardinal again responded
to the Washington challenge by
winning two points to get another
game point at 16-15. But the
teams traded a pair of sideouts
and Washington won two points
to go up 17-16. The Huskies won
18-16 when Stanford was called
for touching the net.
