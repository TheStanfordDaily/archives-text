# Cardinal cagers spoil Brazil's basketball carnival
## Vlahov's three-pointer saves win 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
For anyone headed to Maples
Pavilion hoping to see a clear-cut,
consistent display of what to ex
pect from the 1989-90 men's bas
ketball team, Friday night's game
against Brazil's Nosso Club had
to be disappointing.
But for someone looking for
hints of various possibilities for
the season, the game was satisfy
ing.

Men's Basketball

Cardinal 65
Nosso Club 63

In a game consisting of spurts
of strong play mixed with spurts
of confusion, the Cardinal basket
ball team downed Nosso 65-63
after junior Andrew Vlahov, who
made only four of 11 shots for
the game, buried a 22-foot three
point goal with four seconds
remaining on the clock.
"Vlahov struggled tonight,"
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"But he took care of the crucial
shot. I doubt we could have gotten
a better shot if we had called a
timeout to set up a play."
That Nosso, a veteran squad
which has beaten three college
teams already this season, was in
position to knock off the Cardinal
had to be a bit of surprise to the
crowd of about 800 who had
watched Stanford maintain a com
fortable eight or nine-point cus
hion throughout most of the
second half.
With just over a six minutes
left in the game, Nosso star Carlos
Romano, who had scored 30 points
in the second half in an exhibition
against UC Irvine, began chipping
away at the 58-50 Cardinal lead.
Romano hit a three-pointer to pull
Nosso within five, and five
minutes later he hit a 22-footer
to pull Nosso behind 62-60.
With fifteen seconds left in the
game, Romano finished his long
distance shooting by spinning
around on the left side of the
court and shooting over Cardinal
junior John Patrick to hit another
22-foot three-pointer to put Nosso
up 63-62.
"We knew Romano was a great

shooter," Montgomery said. "He's
the kind of guy who has unlimited
range. Those last two shots he
took were pretty dog-gone tough."
The Cardinal shooters found
the bucket a respectable number
of times themselves. Although un
able to match the 64-percent
shooting from three-point range
they attained against Brewster
Heights, Stanford did convert on
eight of 19 long distance attempts.
Freshman Kenny Hicks connected
on all three of his three-point at
tempts.
In the first half, Stanford was
able to mix up effectively the in
side and outside scoring. After
Patrick put the Cardinal on the
board with a 21-foot three
pointer, sophomore Adam Keefe,
able to score at will inside
throughout the game, banged in
10 consecutive Cardinal points, in
cluding three slam dunks. Follow
ing Keefe in Stanford's scoring,
Hicks hit a three-point goal, soph
omore Langtry Meyer followed up
with a tip-in, and freshman Peter
Dukes converted two more three
point goals.
Keefe led the team in scoring
for the second game in a row with
20 points, and junior Deshon Win
gate led the team with 11
rebounds. As a team the Cardinal,
recorded only a 33-25 rebounding
advantage against the much
smaller Nosso club.
According to Montgomery, part
of the problem for the Cardinal
may have been numerous injuries
which disrupted the continuity of
last week's practice schedule.
Freshman Paul Garrett was lost
for about three weeks with a dis
location and fracture to his finger,
Keefe was out for a couple days
with a thigh bruise, Patrick was
down for two days with turf toe,
and Vlahov struggled with knee
problems.
"As a player I want to look to
be on the court as much as pos
sible," Keefe said. "But to be
honest I got a little tired out there
in the first half today."
Stanford took this weekend off
and will try to get in an intense
week of practice before opening
regular season play Friday at
Maples Pavilion against Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo.
