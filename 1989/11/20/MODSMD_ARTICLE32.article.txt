# Daily seizes Ink Bowl, 28-7
## Crazy-legs Cousins, Ironhead Heywood rip Cal 
### Buck Montana Senior staff writer 
As in any great football game,
the battle was won in the
trenches - with the blood,
sweat and tears of several big
linemen.
No, it wasn't Big Game. It
was the bigger game with the
smaller, more dangerous sym
bol.
The Daily's crack football
team regained rights to the Ex
acto Knife Saturday by tearing
apart the Daily Californian, 28-
7, in the probably-not-92nd
annual Ink Bowl.
As the game concluded, doz
ens of Exacto Committee mem
bers dressed in red, green and
white Daily quake T-shirts
taunted the Daily Cal players
by parading the Exacto Plaque
in front of the Roble Field bleac
hers.
The fierce defensive line play
of "Ironhead" Barrett Heywood,
"Ravaging" Raoul Mowatt and
"Bruisin"' Brian W. Webber
forced Daily Cal quarterbacks
to rush several passes into the
waiting hands of The Daily's
secondary unit.
Three interceptions and seven
sacks on the afternoon pre
vented the Daily Cal's offense
from getting into any sort of
rhythm, or rhyme, as The Daily
pulled to a 14-0 halftime lead.
The Daily's offense recovered
from an early mishap when
first-play jitters struck Greg
Wounded Duck" Gottesman,
causing him to throw an errant

pass to a Daily Cal cornerback
who was a good 10 yards away
from any Daily receiver.
When asked ahout the play
after the game, Gottesman
responded, "I thought we were
wearing blue-and-gold T-shirts.
I guess I was wrong."
After the tenacious Daily de
fense shut Cal down, the offense
marched down the field, ending
in a 40-yard touchdown toss
from "Rockin"' Rob Johnstone
to Nat "Crazy-legs" Cousins.
Several drives later, Michael
"Jerry Rice" Clayton made the
Ink Bowl highlight reel when
he pulled down a 25-yard
Johnstone pass in tight triple
coverage.
The Daily Cal opened the sec
ond half with a strong march
down field to score its only
points on the day with a 12-yard
pass to tight end Vittorio Tafur
who pranced down the right
sideline for seven. Safety Mark
"Tough guy" Rogowsky, who
was playing with a shoulder in
jury suffered in the previous
week's intramural game, was
blitzing on the play.
The defense closed the gaps
for the rest of the game, as
safety Chris "The Conqueror"
Crader made a heady intercep
tion after a pass was tipped by
linebacker Tim "Majik Man"
Marklein.

"It was the pre game tip drill
that made the turnover possi
ble," Crader said in a post game
interview.
Two drives later, Marklein set
up a 32-yard touchdown pass
from Johnstone to Cousins with
a 22-yard interception return of
an off-target Daily Cal pass.
Johnstone pulled down an
other interception to stop a
threatening Daily Cal team deep
in Daily territory.
The final Daily Cal threat
ended on downs when the Bears
tricked themselves with what
appeared to be an unrehearsed
version of Nebraska's famous
"fumble-rooskie" play, even
though explicit and thoroughly
explained game rules declared a
ball dead once it hit the ground.
With about two minutes to
play, "Funny Man" Andrew
Berkowitz iced the game by dar
ting 14 yards into the end zone
with a pass from Cousins.
Ink Bowl notes
John "The Rock" Wagner played
a solid game at center, avoiding
snaps to the turf and making some
catches of his own.
June "Hit-woman" Cohen took
out three Daily Cal players in the
open field without laying a hand on
any of them. Just before they
reached her zone, Cohen's threat
ening footsteps caused all three to
collide and end the play.
"Joltin"' Jason Bloomstein single
handedly stopped one Daily Cal se
ries with a blitzing hat trick — one
sack, one rushed throw and one
batted-down pass.

"Tough guy" Rogowsky, who
was playing with a shoulder in
jury suffered in the previous
week's intramural game, was
blitzing on the play.
The defense closed the gaps
for the rest of the game, as
safety Chris "The Conqueror"
Crader made a heady intercep
tion after a pass was tipped by
linebacker Tim "Majik Man"
Marklein.

"It was the pre game tip drill
that made the turnover possi
ble," Crader said in a post game
interview.
Two drives later, Marklein set
up a 32-yard touchdown pass
from Johnstone to Cousins with
a 22-yard interception return of
an off-target Daily Cal pass.
Johnstone pulled down an
other interception to stop a
threatening Daily Cal team deep
in Daily territory.
The final Daily Cal threat
ended on downs when the Bears
tricked themselves with what
appeared to be an unrehearsed
version of Nebraska's famous
"fumble-rooskie" play, even
though explicit and thoroughly
explained game rules declared a
ball dead once it hit the ground.
With about two minutes to
play, "Funny Man" Andrew
Berkowitz iced the game by dar
ting 14 yards into the end zone
with a pass from Cousins.
Ink Bowl notes
John "The Rock" Wagner played
a solid game at center, avoiding
snaps to the turf and making some
catches of his own.
June "Hit-woman" Cohen took
out three Daily Cal players in the
open field without laying a hand on
any of them. Just before they
reached her zone, Cohen's threat
ening footsteps caused all three to
collide and end the play.
"Joltin"' Jason Bloomstein single
handedly stopped one Daily Cal se
ries with a blitzing hat trick — one
sack, one rushed throw and one
batted-down pass.
