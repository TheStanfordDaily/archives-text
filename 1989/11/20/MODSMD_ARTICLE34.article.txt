# Golfers invade Palm Springs
## 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
While most students prepare to
head home for Thanksgiving, the
Stanford men's and women's golf
teams have ventured south to
compete in today's opening round
of the UCLA Intercollegiate, in
Palm Springs, Calif.
The men'B play will commence
at 7:30 this morning, while the
women's portion of the tourna
ment begins at 11:30 a.m.
Both squads will need supreme
concentration and skillful shot
making to overcome the challenge
presented by the venerable Mis
sion Hills Country Club. The
course is home to the Dinah Shore
Classic — a Ladies' Professional
Golfers Association tour stop —
and is widely acclaimed as one of
the most difficult courses in the
country.
Beyond the problems posed by
Mission Hills, the women's team
faces an especially formidable
field. Nine of the nation's top 10
teams will participate in the
UCLA invite.
Currently ranked eighth nation
ally, the women Cardinal linksters
must defeat such powerful foes
as the defending national cham
pion Tulsa Hurricanes, Arizona
State, Arizona and San Jose State
to capture the team title.
Women's Coach Tim Baldwin

assessed the event as "highly sig
nificant" for his squad. He viewed
the tournament as an opportunity
for Stanford to confirm its place
among the finest of collegiate golf.
"We're looking to improve our
position. With the strength of this
field, a top five finish would be
a major accomplishment,"
Baldwin said.
Stanford will be represented in
Palm Springs by sophomores
Stephanie Davis, Adele Moore,
Audrey Wooding, junior Jodi
Figley and senior Stephanie Parel.
This lineup has played in all of
the fall events and has provided
the nucleus for the Cardinal's fine
showing.
Baldwin attributed his squad's
success thus far to its ability to
play well as a unit.
"Not one of our players has
played as well as they know they
can. It's just been good team ef
forts," he said.
While the women have provided
a paradigm of consistency, the
men's squad enters its fourth
event of the autumn campaign
with its fourth different roster.
This week'B version of the Car
dinal includes senior Steve White,
whose steady play in the inter
squad qualifier earned him a spot
on the traveling team.
White joins sophomore Chris
tian Cevaer, junior Johan Rem
melgas, and seniors Don

Christiansen and Marc Funseth.
These five players will enjoy an
incredibly busy Thanksgiving
week. Following the conclusion of
the UCLA tournament on Wed
nesday afternoon, the team will
fly to Houston, Texas, to compete
in the Rice Invitational, to be
played Friday through Sunday
For men's Coach Wally Good
win, the next seven days will serve
as a crucial indicator of his team's
total capabilities.
There is little doubt concerning
the squad's ability to card low
scores. Stanford has posted a
team title and second place finish
in its last two tournaments.
Despite these fine showingß,
Goodwin expressed reservations
about the team's stamina.
He appraised his team's per
formance in the middle round of
last week's UC-Santa Barbara as
"disheartening".
"We seem to be not quite as
attentive in the middle rounds.
I'm concerned about mental
fatigue, because we certainly
don't give up," Goodwin said.
By competing six of the next
seven days, the peripatetic Cardi
nal will gain vital insight on its
potential.
"We'll just see how tough we
are. We're really going to know
what kind of team we are after
these two events," Goodwin said.
