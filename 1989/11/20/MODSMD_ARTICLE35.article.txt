SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Even the team of the decade
couldn't survive its ugliest game
of the year yesterday.
The Green Bay Packers took ad
vantage of four turnovers and 10
penalties and recorded six sacks
to shock San Francisco 21-17, hal
ting the 49ers' six-game winning
streak.
It was the Packers' first trip to
Candlestick Park in 15 years and
their first victory here since 1963.
After improving their once
improbable playoff hopes and
moving within a game of the NFC
Central lead, they had to figure
it was worth the wait.
"We've been talking about this
game being a little bit of a mea
suring stick on trying to figure
out where we are on our road
back to the championship," Pack

erj coach Lindy Infante said. "It
v. as certainly a huge victory for
us, especially coming off the loss"
to Detroit last week.
Don who until Fri
day wasn't even expected to play
because of a hyperextended right
knee, ran for two touchdowns and
threw for a third. He scooted eight
yards on a quarterback draw for
the go-ahead score with 11:55 to
play, slipping up the middle al
most untouched on third-and-3.
"They faked the blitz," Mcy
kowski said. "I thought, 'They're
going to get to me, it's going to
be a busted play.' But it opened
up and I squirted through there."
Green Bay's defense preserved
the upset by limited the league's
highest-scoring offense to a 44-
yard Mike Cofer field goal on the
final two drives.

The young Packers have made
a habit of achieving the unex
pected this month, upsetting
Chicago and San Francisco and
losing to lowly Detroit in the last
three weeks.
The latest surprise enabled
them to pick up a game on both
Minnesota and the Bears. Green
Bay (6-5) can move into a tie for
the division lead by beating the
first-place Vikings in Milwaukee
next Sunday.
The 49ers, meanwhile, were
consistently sloppy all game long.
They were called for three
penalties totaling 35 yards on
Green Bay's game-winning drive,
including an offsides on defensive
end Daniel Stubbs that wiped out
a 96-yard interception return for
an apparent touchdown by Chet
Brooks.
