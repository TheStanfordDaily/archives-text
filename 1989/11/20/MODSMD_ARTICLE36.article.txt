Chicano dean selection proceeds
Although the search committee for a new full
time director of El Centro Chicano has made its
decision, the selection will be announced later
this week at the earliest, said Leticia Valadez
and Ana Mata, co-chairs of MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group.
Last week, students, faculty and staff inter
viewed the five candidates and submitted written
evaluations of the applicants. The search com
mittee, a group composed of four students, two
faculty and two staff members, made its decision
Wednesday after analyzing the reviews of the
candidates.
However, the choice must be approved by Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Michael Jackson and the
position offered to the chosen candidate.
Then the candidate must decide whether to
accept the offer. This process may take days, and
if the candidate rejects the offer, the announce
ment will be postponed while another candidate
is approved and offered the position.

Store removes L-tryptophan
Tresidder Express removed a product contain
ing L-tryptophan from its shelves Thursday after
the state health director said the dietary supple
ment may be linked to a rare blood disorder.
State Health Director Kenneth Kizer ordered
all retail merchants to discontinue the sale of
the amino acid L-tryptophan, which is commonly
used by people with sleeping problems and
premenstrual syndrome.
The dietary supplement is thought to be at
fault for 154 cases — 19 in California — of
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, a blood disorder
characterized by severe muscle pain and a higher
than-normal count of a certain white blood cell.
Other symptoms sometimes seen are weakness,

swelling of the arms and legs, fever and skin rash.
Prompted by a call from The Daily, Tresidder's
convenience store took one vitamin product con
taining L-tryptophan from its shelves.
The state Department of Health Services, the
federal Food and Drug Administration and the
national Centers for Disease Control are conduct
ing a study to determine if the food supplement
causes the syndrome.

University runs out of closets
Despite delays, displaced students relocated by
the University will be receiving wardrobes by the
end of winter break, according to Suzanne
Tamiesie, manager of housing operations.
Several displaced students have voiced concerns
about the adequacy of the furniture they received
on entering their new housing. All were given
desks, chairs, beds and dressers. However, some
displaced students did not receive "normal
closets," as Megan Williams, a sophomore dis
placed from Phi Psi to Theta Chi, puts it.
Instead, many students were provided with
"moving wardrobes," which are essentially rein
forced cardboard boxes with a metal strip to hang
clothes on. This was necessary because the Uni
versity does not keep extra wardrobes on hand.
According to L.K. Tan, a transfer student
diplaced from Durand to a study room in Yost,
the students thought they were "supposed to get
[the wardrobes] by last Tuesday."
Tamiesie said the University has rush-ordered
56 wardrobes to be built by Design/Spec Furni
ture Manufacturers of Vacaville, Ca. The new
wardrobes will be arriving on Dec. 18 or 22 and
will be installed in student rooms over the winter
holiday, she said.
The new wardrobes will cost the University
approximately $20,000, Tamiesie said.
