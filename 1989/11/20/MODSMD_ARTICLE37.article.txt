# Hospital amends disaster plan
## 
### Robert Pardington Staff writer 
Although Stanford University
Hospital came through the Oct.
17 earthquake "surprisingly
well," the 7.1 temblor did shake
some pressing needs to the sur
face in preparing for a future
large-magnitude quake.
Dr. Ricardo Martinez, clinical
director of Emergency Services
and chairman of the Medical Staff
Disaster Committee, said the
earthquake "brought out several
points that we have to focus on."
"The first thing is that we have
to find better ways to communi
cate (during a disaster) both
within the hospital and between
other universities and hospitals,"
Martinez said.
Specifically, the hospital needs
increased radio communications
and a more organized response
outside the hospital, Martinez
said.
The Emergency Services divi
sion of the hospital, however, did
respond adequately to the October

quake, according to Martinez. "We
ended up with more people
(doctors and staff) than we ended
up using," he said.
On Oct. 17, Dr. John Neale,
hospital disaster control officer,
declared a Level I emergency.
Level I emergency status means
that the Emergency Ward can ex
pect more than eight meyor cases
and/or 20 minor cases. In the
seven hours after the quake, the
department accommodated ap
proximately 30 more patients than
normally would have been ex
pected.
Physical damage to the hospital
was light. There were some spills
in the laboratories, and one
elevator linking the heliport to
lower levels was put out of com
mission. The hospital had to deal
with some problems of transport
ing patients to different floors
without the elevator.
"There were a lot of areas with
superficial damage," Martinez
said, "but everything came out
better than we would have
thought."

The phone system of the hospi
tal, luckily, operated well through
the disaster. Still, some revisions
are called for, Martinez said.
Among the changes in Martinez'
plan would be identifying a
centralized communication post to
coordinate emergency services,
and requiring identification tags
for stafT.
"A big question is what do we
do if we have to go into disaster
mode for a week or longer," Mar
tinez said. "We practice for emer
gencies for only hours at a time."
Martinez's "revised disaster
plan" was approved by the Med
ical Board Nov. 1 and is now being
recommended to the hospital
board for final approval.
"Our biggest concern," Mar
tinez said, "is the overall Bay Area
response to a mayor earthquake.
We need better communication."
Asked whether the Stanford
Hospitals would be ready for the
"Big One," a magnitude 8.0 or
greater earthquake, Martinez
said, "I don't know if anybody
will be ready for the big one."
