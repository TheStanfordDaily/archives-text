# Omission angers Native Americans
## UCMI staff report exclusion due to small size of population 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer 
A University report on minority
staff members designed to pro
mote a "multicultural, multiracial
University community" has
provoked outrage among Native
Americans on campus.
The report, released last Wed
nesday by the staff subcommittee
of the University Committee on
Minority Issues, fails to include
the responses of Native American
staff members in its findings.
According to Vice Provost
Raymond Bacchetti, who co
chaired the UCMI staff subcom
mittee, Native Americans were
excluded from the report because
accurate statistical generaliza
tions cannot be made for such a
small number of people.
"The statistics compiled from
their responses wouldn't be reli
able," Bacchetti explained.
But Native Americans at Stan
ford feel that such explanations
cannot excuse the omission of
staff responses from the final
report. "Students are very angry,"
said Colin Hampson, the external
affairs officer of the Stanford

American Indian Organization,
which held a meeting Friday to
discuss the UCMI report.
"People felt like the message
from Stanford was that Indians
are treated as a quota number
and once you're in they don't care
how you feel," Hampson said.
He said the University's deci
sion to exclude data from Native
American staff members "led
many students to question the
University's commitment to and
chosen method for dealing with
issues of racism, exclusion and
multiculturalism."
Last night the Students of Color
Coalition met to consider possible
responses to the committee's de
cision to exclude Native American
staff results.
Hampson, a Native American
of Winnebago and Chippewa des
cent, said that "given the history
of American Indians in this coun
try, it is especially painful to be
basically forgotten, left out, un
recognized, and excluded."
Those feelings were shared by
Native American staff members
who responded to the survey. "I'm
not sure if we've been forgotten
or ignored," said Asst. Dean of

Student Affairs James Larimore.
According to Larimore, a Com
anche Indian who is the director
of the Native American Cultural
Center at Stanford, the UCMI set
up two meetings with Native
American staff members to en
courage them to respond to the
survey.
"They never said, 'We're not
sure if we're going to be able to
publish these responses.' They led
us to believe that we would be
included in the final report,"
Larimore said.
The results of the report are
important to the future of the
Native American community at
Stanford, Larimore said. "My un
derstanding is that this report is
a foundation document and a
starting point for the discussion
of multicultural issues," he said.
"By not having us included in
the committee report when it
came out, that really takes us out
of the discussion."
"We were looking forward to
this survey as a chance to gather
statistics about our community,"
said Denni Woodward, an Apache
who is the Program Coordinator
for the Native American Cultural
Center.
Woodward, who served on the
UCMI last year, said she felt
"betrayed by colleagues and
friends" who led her and others
to believe that their responses
would find a place in the UCMI

staff report.
Bacchetti apologized for the
distress created by the UCMI
report. "Their statistics certainly
should have been mentioned," he
said. "It was stupid and insensi
tive of me . . . not to take their
statistics into account."
Bacchetti says the staff subcom
mittee will analyze the statistics
to see if any benefit could be
gained from their publication.
"I'm not going to publish the data

without first deciding if the raw
numbers have any statistical sig
nificance," he said.
However, Larimore and Wood
ward both felt that a delay in the
tabulation of the responses might
reflect the University's fear that
the statistics will reveal dissatis
faction among Native American
staff members. "It's not far
fetched to think the University
might have something to hide,"
Larimore said.

Bacchetti apologized for the
distress created by the UCMI
report. "Their statistics certainly
should have been mentioned," he
said. "It was stupid and insensi
tive of me . . . not to take their
statistics into account."
Bacchetti says the staff subcom
mittee will analyze the statistics
to see if any benefit could be
gained from their publication.
"I'm not going to publish the data

without first deciding if the raw
numbers have any statistical sig
nificance," he said.
However, Larimore and Wood
ward both felt that a delay in the
tabulation of the responses might
reflect the University's fear that
the statistics will reveal dissatis
faction among Native American
staff members. "It's not far
fetched to think the University
might have something to hide,"
Larimore said.
