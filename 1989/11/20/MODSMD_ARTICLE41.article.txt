# Slain priests mourned
## Victims may have become guest professors 
### Jim Ron Editorial staff 
Stanford students lost the op
portunity to meet two of El Sal
vador's leading scholars next year
when the two were assasinated
last week in San Salvador.
The Rev. Segundo Montes and
the Rev. Ignacio Ellacuria, two of
the six Salvadoran Jesuit priests
killed — apparently by right-wing
death squads — were to have been
invited to Stanford to spend a year
as visiting professors the day they
were shot to death.
"I had their letters of invitation
on my desk to sign Wednesday,
but I signed them too late to get
into the afternoon mail," said
Richard Fagen, director of Stan
ford's Center for Latin American
Studies. "When I heard about
their deaths Thursday morning,
I had the letters taken out of the
mailbox."
Stanford faculty and students
have cooperated in research ef
forts for over a decade with the
University of Central America,
where the slain priests taught.
One graduate student who met
the Rev. Segundo Montes two
years ago was "horrified ... and
outraged at the casualty and
brutality of their death," she said.
The student, who has conducted
research in the social sciences in
El Salvador, requested anonymity
for fear of reprisals in future visits
to El Salvador.
Recalling two lengthy sessions
she spent working on her research
with Montes, she said, "He struck
me as an excellent scholar, in
tensely committed to describing
the effect of the civil war on the
people of El Salvador."
She now believes "there will be
a bloodbath in the coming weeks,"

placing her many friends in El
Salvador in extreme danger, as
the government's reaction to the
rebel's offensive loses all sem
blance of restraint.
Terry Karf, an assistant profes
sor of political science, has worked
with the scholars over the last
eight years, and was "especially
close to Ignacio Martin-Baro," she
said.
Although she has often been ex
posed to mutilated bodies during
her years of research in El Sal
vador, this massacre is different.
"I have seen tortured bodies . . .
and [that] will always be with
me," she said. But "it means
something different when it is
someone you know," she added.
She said the pain she feels is
worsened by knowing the priests
had ample opportunity to leave
El Salvador and escape threats
from the right-wing elements un
happy with the Jesuits' leading
role in advocating national recon
ciliation.
But the priests "felt very
strongly their place was in El Sal
vador," she said.
Stanford faculty and students
are mobilizing in an effort to
prompt a strong U.S. reaction to
the killings.
A campus march and vigil will
take place today, and more than
50 faculty members have placed
an advertisement in today's Daily
calling for an immediate investi
gation into the killings, both in
the United States and in El Sal
vador. Professors nationwide have
placed a similar ad in the Wash
ington Post, Karl said.
The march will begin at noon
at the Bechtel International Cen
ter, proceed through White Plaza
and end with a vigil in front of
Memorial Church.
