# Quake forum focuses on causes and effects

### Kristin Farr 
Until Oct. 17 at 5:04 p.m., the
threat of mcyor earthquakes for
Bay Area residents did not seem
real.
As the old joke about Califor
nia falling into the ocean has
resurfaced since the quake hit
the Bay Area that day, earth
quake preparedness has also re
turned as a key concern for
Californians.
A public forum held yesterday
educated a concerned Memorial
Auditorium audience about the
history and geology of earth
quakes in the Bay Area, the ef
fects of the Oct. 17 quake and
ways to prepare for the future.
All of the specialists present
at the forum advocated learning
from the past to prepare for the
future. Protection from disasters
like those experienced in the
1906 earthquake, or more re
cently in the Marina district, can
be avoided through a
"knowledge of technology and a
desire to implement it," said
Civil Engineering Prof. Helmut
Krawinkler.
Through education about the
physical impact of an earth
quake, improved forecasting
ability, safe buildings and
freeways and individual prepar
edness, earthquakes don't have
to be devastating, the scientists
concluded.
The symposium featured nine
experts from Stanford's Geo
physics and Civil Engineering
Departments and the U.S.
Geological Survey who explained
the physical phenomenon of an
earthquake, and applied the in
formation to explain the San
Andreas Fault and its potential
effect on Bay Area residents.

Hundreds of area residents,
but few students, attended the
forum.
Prof. Amos Nur, chair of the
Geophysics Department, and
William Ellisworth of the
geological survey used plate tec
tonics — a theory of geology and
the evolution of the earth — to
explain the cause of an earth
quake.
Ellisworth explained that the
face of the earth is comprised of
plates which are constantly shift
ing. California rests on the
Pacific and North American
plates, which are undergoing
side-by-side sliding at a rate of
three centimeters per year.
The Pacific plate is headed
northwest while the North
American plate is shifting in a
southeastern direction. This
results in tension and static
equilibrium which cause the
plates to build and store energy.
When the force overcomes the
stress, the earth shifts and its
crust breaks in a "strain ac
cumulation and release," result
ing in an earthquake.
The San Andreas fault is the
main pressure release point be
tween the Pacific and North
American plates, and runs the
length of the state of California.
It spans 220 miles and is ap
proximately 12 miles deep.
On Oct. 17, the San Andreas
fault released a quake of mag
nitude 7.1 in the Santa Cruz
Mountains. The lateral and
vertical movement of the plates
occurred on a 70 percent inclined
plane.
This "blind thrusting" slip
page resulted in an energy in
crease, which measured 7.1 at
the epicenter on the earth's
crust.


Chris Elsenborg — Dall/
William Ellsworth, one of several speakers at yesterday's public
forum," In the wake of the Quake: Perspectives on California's
Earthquakes," speaks to a large crowd composed primarily of
community members in Memorial Auditorium. The forum ad
dressed both physical causes and potential effects of earth
quakes in the Bay Area.
