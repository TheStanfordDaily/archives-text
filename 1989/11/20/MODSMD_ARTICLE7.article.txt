# Kennedy to testify in safety suit
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
University President Donald
Kennedy must account for his
public statements echoing a 1988
report that concluded "no clear
and present danger" existed in
campus laboratories, a judge has
ruled.
The. Santa Clara County judge
ruled Friday that Kennedy must
give his sworn testimony in a
deposition to Palo Alto lawyer
John Shaffer, who is suing the
University and SRI International
on behalf of a chemistry graduate
student who claims his severe
health problems were a result of
poor laboratory safety.
Stanford lawyers said that if
Kennedy gives a deposition, it will
be his first since he became pres
ident.
Much of the suit focuses on a
1988 SRI safety study concluding
that campus laboratories could be
improved but were generally safe.
Shaffer argues that Stanford and
SRI were negligent to proclaim
that no serious dangers existed
when the report stated it was not
intended as a complete safety
review.
Kennedy is being called to ex
plain his involvement with safety
issues, particularly his public
statements about the SRI report.
In one statement at the time of
the report's release, Kennedy said,

"No evidence was found of any
risk to the public or any current
danger to University employees
or students in the workplace."
Shaffer said he would like to
establish whether Kennedy had
any knowledge of safety problems
when he said that no dangers ex
isted.
Shaffer said he has found a
paper trail indicating that the
fume hoods in the Stauffer
chemistry buildings, where his
client worked, were deficient and
known health threats. Those fume
hoods were still in place at the
time of the SRI study.
Stanford lawyers objected to
Shaffer's request for Kennedy's
deposition because they said the
president had no direct involve
ment in campus safety issues.
Further, they argued to the
courts, Shaffer was "abusive"
when taking depositions of other
key safety officials, and he would
be likely to harass Kennedy as
well.
In a document filed with the
court, Stanford staff counsel
Debra Zumwalt said Shaffer was
particularly abusive with Doug
Brown, former associate director
of Health and Safety, when Brown
asked Shaffer to clarify a ques
tion. According to Zumwalt, Shaf
fer then asked Brown whether he
could speak English and accused
Brown of having a mental
deficiency.

The judge asked that Shaffer
take depositions from officials
more intimately involved in safety
matters before he takes a deposi
tion from Kennedy.
The judge also appointed a
"referee" to the deposition to
prevent what Stanford lawyers
fear will be continued abusive be
havior from Shaffer, according to
Zumwalt. The referee will also try
to prevent Shaffer from asking
overly broad and irrelevant ques
tions.
For more than a year, Shaffer
has been pursuing litigation
against the University on health
and safety matters. He settled his
first lawsuit, on behalf of former
Health and Safety official Jon
Moldestad, out of court for
$200,000 and in the meantime
gathered many thousands of pages
of documents relating to Health
and Safety.
So far in the litigation, Shaffer
has taken a deposition from
former Health and Safety director
Alain Decleve, who was removed
from his position after the SRI
report and now is no longer at
Stanford. Shaffer has also taken
a deposition from Brown,
Decleve's right-hand man who was
also removed from Health and
Safety.
Before Kennedy's deposition,
which the judge ruled must hap
pen in the next 90 days, Shaffer
is scheduled to take a deposition
from Moldestad, his former client.
