# Tents may house sorority rush

Imagine seven tents, crowded with women, pitched
on a grassy Stanford field. This is not an outdoor
education class, but the new way sorority rush may
work this spring.
According to Liana Koontz, the Intersorority
Council rush chair, Fraternal Affairs Adviser Mi
chael Hughes suggested using tents so that rushees
"won't have to walk all over campus for parties."
"If the tents are in one area, it shows the sororities
are unified," Koontz said.
In the past, sorority rush parties have taken place
in classrooms and at the homes of local sorority
alumnae. "It was difficult to find houses last year,
and the alumnae are happy about the idea" of using
tents, said Pam Simpson, the ISC president.
Stanford's seven sororities will discuss the idea
today, and after Thanksgiving break, the ISC will

meet and vote on the tent scheme. If five of the
seven are in favor of the tents, rush will change
accordingly.
"We're starting really early on rush to make sure
it is very organized and runs smoothly and effi
ciently," Koontz added.
Other ideas for improving rush include revamping
the role of the rush counselors â€” sorority members
who help rushees. This year, these counselors will
hold information sessions and counsel prospective
rushees. The new procedure will help rushees be
better informed when choosing a sorority, Koontz
said.
Also, sororities are considering standardizing the
nametags worn by all rushees, so that sorority
members "can spend less time on making things
that get thrown out anyway," Koontz said.
This year rush will take place the third week of
spring quarter, one week later than usual, because
of Passover.
