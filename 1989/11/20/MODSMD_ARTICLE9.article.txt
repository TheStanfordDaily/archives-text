# Damage follow-up underway
## University hires firm for final assessment of quake damage 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
As another step in the long
process of evaluating and
rebuilding the buildings
damaged by the Oct. 17 earth
quake, Stanford has hired an
outside consulting firm to do a
final assessment of structural
damage.
Jack Benjamin and As
sociates, a Menlo Park struc
tural engineering firm, has been
hired to perform two crucial
functions, according to Fouad
Bendimerad, the structural en
gineer on the Facilties Project
Management staff who is over
seeing the company's work.
First, engineers from Ben
jamin and Associates will go
back into the damaged buildings
and reassess the structural
damage. Although most of the
buildings have already been ex
amined twice, once immediately
after the quake and once again
in greater detail, Bendimerad
noted that the third examina
tion will provide further detail
about structural damage that is
needed to begin repairs.
"It is important to follow up
with a more detailed inspec
tion," noted Gene Kershner, as
sociate director of Facilities
Project Management.
The Benjamin team will also
evaluate how well buildings on
campus came through the
earthquake. With this informa
tion and knowledge about other
earthquakes around the world,
they hope to be able to predict
what might happen to campus
buildings in a much stronger
quake, Bendimerad said.
Along with the team from
Benjamin and Associates, there
are a number of other engineer
ing firms on campus analyzing
the damaged buildings, accord
ing to Kershner.
Kershner said the major
rebuilding work is divided into
approximately 20 projects.
Several of the outside firms are
working on several different
projects.
As the one engineer on the

staff of Facilities Project Man
agement, Bendimerad is respon
sible for overseeing the work of
all of these outside firms and
making final conclusions as to
what work needs to be done.
This information is then used
by the various project managers,
said Bendimerad.
Bendimerad said he also
checks the accuracy and
thoroughness of the damage as
sessments of the Federal
Emergency Management
Agency, which will determine
the amount of federal aid Stan
ford receives.
From the information in
these studies, the facilties office
is beginning to make estimates
of the scope of the work that
must be done to repair and im
prove the structural strength of
the damaged buildings.
Problems in some older build
ings have been compounded by
the fact that the facilities offices
only has plans and drawings for
buildings that have been built
or remodeled since the mid
-19505, Kershner said.
In studying the pre-1950
buildings, Bendimerad said, en
gineers must rely on very
sketchy drawings, previous
studies, and field observations.
On buildings where work
needs to be done, engineers will
have to reconstruct plans and
make "as-built drawings" before
repair can begin.
Problematic asymmetry
The damage in the Graduate
School of Business, a relatively
new building, is expected to be
repaired, for the most part, by
January, Bendimerad said.
Bendimerad attributed the
damage to the difference in
structure between the offices
and the library in the building.
Because of this type of "asym
metrical" design, Bendimerad
said, different loads were
created on different parts of the
building.
In the meantime, students
and faculty in the Business
School have had "responded fan
tastically" to the situation, said

Paul Johnson, associate dean of
administration of the business
school.
Johnson said many staff
members have been moved into
unused offices and conference
rooms in the nearby Littlefield
center. Furthermore, the career
management office, the admis
sions office, the dean's office
and the accounting office, have
also been moved.
Classes are being held on the
ground floor, which is open, and
in the basement of Littlefield.
In the Jackson Business Li
brary in the Business School,
many of the shelves have been
damaged and will have to be
rebuilt, said Johnson. In addi
tion, many books fell off the
shelves during the quake and
have to be reshelved.
Although the damage in the
business school can be repaired
fairly easily, Stanford still must
decide to what extent to upgrade
the building to make it more
earthquake-proof, Bendimerad
said.
Green West may take years
Damage on the upper floors
of the West Wing of Green Li
brary may take several years to
repair, Bendimerad said.
The tile partition walls on the
upper floors have cracked, cre
ating a safety hazard if another
quake should occur, said Ben
dimerad.
All of these tiles will probably
have to be removed, and a
suitable, sturdier replacement
will have to be found. Ben
dimerad noted that although
these walls are not crucial to
the building structure, they do
absorb some of the load and
need to have some rigidity.
The ground floor of the West
Wing will probably open in a
week or so, however, Ben
dimerad said. Engineers have
built new walls around some of
the damaged ones to protect
them.
Bendimerad said the library
building as a whole is struc
turally sound and will not col
lapse.

As another step in the long
process of evaluating and
rebuilding the buildings
damaged by the Oct. 17 earth
quake, Stanford has hired an
outside consulting firm to do a
final assessment of structural
damage.
Jack Benjamin and As
sociates, a Menlo Park struc
tural engineering firm, has been
hired to perform two crucial
functions, according to Fouad
Bendimerad, the structural en
gineer on the Facilties Project
Management staff who is over
seeing the company's work.
First, engineers from Ben
jamin and Associates will go
back into the damaged buildings
and reassess the structural
damage. Although most of the
buildings have already been ex
amined twice, once immediately
after the quake and once again
in greater detail, Bendimerad
noted that the third examina
tion will provide further detail
about structural damage that is
needed to begin repairs.
"It is important to follow up
with a more detailed inspec
tion," noted Gene Kershner, as
sociate director of Facilities
Project Management.
The Benjamin team will also
evaluate how well buildings on
campus came through the
earthquake. With this informa
tion and knowledge about other
earthquakes around the world,
they hope to be able to predict
what might happen to campus
buildings in a much stronger
quake, Bendimerad said.
Along with the team from
Benjamin and Associates, there
are a number of other engineer
ing firms on campus analyzing
the damaged buildings, accord
ing to Kershner.
Kershner said the major
rebuilding work is divided into
approximately 20 projects.
Several of the outside firms are
working on several different
projects.
As the one engineer on the

staff of Facilities Project Man
agement, Bendimerad is respon
sible for overseeing the work of
all of these outside firms and
making final conclusions as to
what work needs to be done.
This information is then used
by the various project managers,
said Bendimerad.
Bendimerad said he also
checks the accuracy and
thoroughness of the damage as
sessments of the Federal
Emergency Management
Agency, which will determine
the amount of federal aid Stan
ford receives.
From the information in
these studies, the facilties office
is beginning to make estimates
of the scope of the work that
must be done to repair and im
prove the structural strength of
the damaged buildings.
Problems in some older build
ings have been compounded by
the fact that the facilities offices
only has plans and drawings for
buildings that have been built
or remodeled since the mid
-19505, Kershner said.
In studying the pre-1950
buildings, Bendimerad said, en
gineers must rely on very
sketchy drawings, previous
studies, and field observations.
On buildings where work
needs to be done, engineers will
have to reconstruct plans and
make "as-built drawings" before
repair can begin.
Problematic asymmetry
The damage in the Graduate
School of Business, a relatively
new building, is expected to be
repaired, for the most part, by
January, Bendimerad said.
Bendimerad attributed the
damage to the difference in
structure between the offices
and the library in the building.
Because of this type of "asym
metrical" design, Bendimerad
said, different loads were
created on different parts of the
building.
In the meantime, students
and faculty in the Business
School have had "responded fan
tastically" to the situation, said

Paul Johnson, associate dean of
administration of the business
school.
Johnson said many staff
members have been moved into
unused offices and conference
rooms in the nearby Littlefield
center. Furthermore, the career
management office, the admis
sions office, the dean's office
and the accounting office, have
also been moved.
Classes are being held on the
ground floor, which is open, and
in the basement of Littlefield.
In the Jackson Business Li
brary in the Business School,
many of the shelves have been
damaged and will have to be
rebuilt, said Johnson. In addi
tion, many books fell off the
shelves during the quake and
have to be reshelved.
Although the damage in the
business school can be repaired
fairly easily, Stanford still must
decide to what extent to upgrade
the building to make it more
earthquake-proof, Bendimerad
said.
Green West may take years
Damage on the upper floors
of the West Wing of Green Li
brary may take several years to
repair, Bendimerad said.
The tile partition walls on the
upper floors have cracked, cre
ating a safety hazard if another
quake should occur, said Ben
dimerad.
All of these tiles will probably
have to be removed, and a
suitable, sturdier replacement
will have to be found. Ben
dimerad noted that although
these walls are not crucial to
the building structure, they do
absorb some of the load and
need to have some rigidity.
The ground floor of the West
Wing will probably open in a
week or so, however, Ben
dimerad said. Engineers have
built new walls around some of
the damaged ones to protect
them.
Bendimerad said the library
building as a whole is struc
turally sound and will not col
lapse.
