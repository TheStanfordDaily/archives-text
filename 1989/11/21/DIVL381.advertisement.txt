MAJORS:
Interview with the
World Leader in
High Energy
Physics Research
Tuesday, November, 28th
As an Electrical, Computer or Mechanical Engineering major, you've
probably heard a great deal about the scientific breakthroughs at
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. As one of the world's most
innovative and technologically advanced leaders in high energy
physics research, "Fermilab" makes headlines through the diverse
contributions of talented professionals. The Laboratory's seeking
innovative individuals, like you, to join the challenge.
Electrical and Computer Engineers
In designing equipment for the Accelerator and Experimental area
systems, you'll be involved with everything from high and low level
processing systems to high power pulsed devices and power supplies.
Other projects will involve analog and digital design (specifically ASIC
and/or VLSI), data acquisition and high performance system
development. Knowledge of CAD/CAE systems is a definite plus.
Mechanical Engineers
The potential exists for involvement in the mechanical design and
fabrication of devices for the accelerator complex as well as the overall
design and operation of superconducting and cryogenic devices. The
opportunity to conduct finite element stress and thermal analysis of
vessels and support structures is also available. CAD training is
advantageous.
Located 40 miles west of downtown Chicago in the beautiful Fox Valley
area, Fermilab offers attractive compensation and comprehensive
benefits packages. To arrange for an on-campus interview on
