## Bush supports El Salvador 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House yesterday rejected an at
tempt to slap restrictions on U.S.
aid to El Salvador, heeding the
warnings of conservatives who
said such a move would be an
overreaction to the murders last
week of six Jesuit priests and two
others.
On a 215 to 194 procedural
vote, the lawmakers effectively
precluded the restrictions from
being added to a $14.6 billion
foreign aid bill that also includes
$533 million to aid Poland and
Hungary, and money for other
U.S. allies around the globe.
The El Salvador issue reopened
old wounds in the House, where
the recent resurgence of violence
brought to the surface harsh dif
ferences about what U.S. policy
there should be.
"To rush into this breech with
this kind of amendment is suicide,
gentlemen, for that country," said
Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.
But Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass.,
asserted that "The Salvadoran
military remains above the law,
and this Congress and this ad
ministration have responded only
with words. Words are simply not
enough."
The vote came just a few hours
after President Bush told
reporters that it was important
to continue support to the elected
government of rightist President

Alfredo Cristiani.
"There is a freely elected gov
ernment doing their very best
trying to get protection from
these Marxist-led guerrillas com
ing into the center of the city, and
we support President Cristiani in
his effort to restore order," Bush
said as he boarded Air Force One
for a day of campaigning for GOP
candidates. "This is not the time
to pull away from President Cris
tiani."
Bush had vetoed a version of
the bill a day earlier over the in
clusion of money for a United Na
tions family planning agency, and
the House was expected to vote
later on a version that would leave
out both the $15 million for the
U.N. Population Fund and the
Salvador restrictions.
The U.N. agency operates in
China, which has a one-child-per
family policy that anti-abortion
activists say results in forced
abortions and sterilizations.
Renewing assistance to the
agency after a five-year hiatus
would have placed the United
States "in the position of support
ing a program that in turn sup
ports coercive abortions, a pro
gram that is inconsistent with
American values," Bush said in
his veto message.
The new bill also would contain
a compromise on a provision in
the original bill, stemming from

the Iran-Contra scandal, which
would have prohibited the admin
istration from using foreign aid
money as leverage to get other
countries to do things it is barred
from doing.
That kind of restriction "would
interfere with my constitutional
authority to conduct the foreign
relations of the United States."
But the veto also opened the
door for Congress to make other
changes, and House liberals
moved quickly to take advantage
by proposing restrictions on as
sistance to El Salvador.
House Democratic leaders had
overridden the objections of 3ome
Republicans and cleared the way
Sunday night for Rep. George Mil
ler, D-Calif., to offer an amend
ment restricting aid to Christiani's
five-month-old government.
The move came largely in re
action to the killing last week of
six Jesuit priests, which many
take as a sign that El Salvador's
right-wing "death squads" have
renewed their activities.
Conservatives, however, wanted
to boost aid to El Salvador to help
the government combat a new of
fensive by leftist rebels.
The veto marked the third time
Bush has cited abortion provi
sions in vetoing a bill. It brought
criticism from Werner Fornos,
president of the Population Insti
tute.

stops, condemned the killings in El Salvador but refused to cut U.S. aid to the country.
