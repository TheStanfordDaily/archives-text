# U.S. shows evidence of Nicaragua supplying Salvadoran rebels
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. con
tention that Nicaragua supports the Sal
vadoran insurgency has been reinforced
by a smuggled videotape purporting to
show guerrilla leaders attending a weap
ons training exercise inside Nicaragua,
U.S. officials said yesterday.
Officials who showed the tape to
reporters said three rebels who appear
in the presentation are top guerrilla com
manders, including Joaquin Villalobos,
generally regarded as the most important
figure in the insurgent hierarchy.
Informed of the U.S. allegations,
Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister Victor
Hugo Tinoco denied that the tape was

authentic and called it a "propaganda
show of the State Department."
Tinoco is in Washington for cease-fire
negotiations with Nicaragua's Contra
rebels. The U.S. officials, who insisted
on anonymity, said the light artillery and
anti-aircraft weapons shown have been
used extensively by the Salvadoran rebels
during recent fighting but had not been
seen before this spring.
The tape is believed to have been made
in either May or June of this year and
was turned over to American authorities
by a person who wished to remain anon
ymous. It was not known who made the
tape or why.

The tape was described by
a U.S. official as 'graphic
confirmation' of the Sandi
nista role in providing
weapons training to the
FMLN.

The officials said some of the same
types of weapons shown on the tape were
used by guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, or FMLN, in
an Oct. 30 attack on Salvadoran Armv

headquarters and the Nov. 11 attacks on
the private and official residences of Sal
vadoran President Alfredo Cristiani.
U.S. analysts concluded that the site
of the taping was the El Tempisque train
ing site north of Managua because of the
terrain and the presence of Soviet weap
ons found nowhere else in Latin America
besides Cuba.
The tape was described by a U.S. of
ficial as "graphic confirmation" of the
Sandinista role in providing weapons
training to the FMLN.
Nicaraguan officials said there may
have been some unauthorized operations
carried out by Sandinista officials in sup

port of the FMLN in the early 1980s but
that these activities have long since
stopped.
The alleged Sandinista support, dating
back almost a decade, is a principal reason
for the U.S. decision to provide generous
military support for the Salvadoran gov
ernment.
As further evidence of Nicaraguan
cooperation with the FMLN, the admin
istration has cited the Oct. 18 capture
of large quantities of weapons alleged to
have been earmarked by the Sandinistas
for the FMLN. The arms were found by
Honduran security guards aboard a truck
near the border with Nicaragua.
