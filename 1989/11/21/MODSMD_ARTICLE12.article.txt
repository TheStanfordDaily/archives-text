# Krenz announces free elections in 1990

### 
EAST BERLIN (AP) â€” An emissary
from West Germany met with East Ger
man leaders yesterday and said the
Communist Party may lose its constitu
tionally guaranteed monopoly on power
as early as next year.
Rudolf Seiters, Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's chief of staff, also said he expects
a law on free elections to be approved
in 1990.
Party chief Egon Krenz, standing be
side Seiters, looked impassive as the
West German official predicted abolition
of the "leading role" guarantee for the
Communists.
More than 400,000 people demonstra
ted in several cities for rapid reform
and free elections, the official news
agency ADN reported.
It said 200,000 people marched in
Leipzig, a southern city where the lar
gest pro-democracy demonstrations
have been held; 100,000 in Dresden;
50,000 each in Halle and Karl-Marx-
Stadt; and 10,000 in Schwerin.
One speaker at the Leipzig rally, who
was not identified, said in an apparent
comment about German reunification:
"We must not suppress the will for uni
ty. We are one people."
Krenz described his talks with Seiters
as "solid," but said no specific date was
set for a summit with Kohl in East
Germany next month.
Kohl's visit, the first by a West Ger
man chancellor to East Germany, is ex
pected before Christmas but after the
special Communist Party congress Dec.
15-17.
In a televised interview Sunday night,
Krenz said the congress might remove
him as party leader.
"It is a decision of my party and I've
always respected the decisions of my
party," he said. "Naturally, I want to
fight for the changes we've managed so

far, but if the party is of another op
inion, then they should find another
general secretary."
Seiters was asked specifically whether
Kohl would meet with Krenz, and
replied: "Let's just say he will meet with
East German leadership."
Premier Hans Modrow, who took part
in the talks, said he hoped for a
"partnership" between West German
business and East Germany's state-run
industry.
Seiters said he sounded out East Ger
man leaders on some changes sought
by opposition groups, including free
elections and constitutional reform.
"I have the impression that the con
stitutional change and the new voting
law will be approved next spring," he
told the joint news conference with
Krenz and Modrow. "I have the impres
sion that Article 1 of the constitution
will be changed."
Article 1 contains the "leading role"
for the party.
Removing the guarantee and opening
the way for free elections are conditions
of a financial aid program West Ger
many has offered.
ADN said many placards and banners
carried in Leipzig, where the largest
pro-democracy protests have been held,
criticized East Germans who take ad
vantage of their new freedom to sell
valuables and currency on the black
market.
It quoted one as saying: "No East
German money in the West. We are
hurting ourselves."
Government sources in Bonn said
West Germany was considering a more
favorable rate of exchange for East Ger
man visitors.
Under the plan being studied, East
Germans would be able to exchange up
to 300 marks at a rate of 4 non

convertible East German marks for 1
West German. The black market rate
is more than 20-1.
Late yesterday, ADN said Krenz had
postponed a visit to Czechoslovakia
planned for Tuesday, but it did not give
a reason. Large pro-democracy demon
strations have been held in Prague.
Seiters, who spoke of the "dramatic
weeks" Germans had experienced,
carried with him details of Bonn's offer
of economic aid, made last week and
also conditioned on East German efforts
to create a free-market economy.
Modrow and others have rejected
what they see as an attempt to lure
East Germany away from communist
principles.
In a speech to Parliament on Satur
day, Modrow outlined a course that
mixes some capitalist elements with
communist planning and embraces
many themes of the reform program
pursued in the Soviet Union by Presi
dent Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
State TV said the main question was
whether Bonn was prepared for rela
tions "on a measurably higher level
without unacceptable conditions."
A public opinion survey reported yes
terday by a West German magazine in
dicated the Communist Party would run
third, with only 14 percent of the vote,
if elections were held now.
Otto Lambsdorff, head of the centrist
Free Democratic Party in West Ger
many, proposed Monday that tighter
controls on currency and customs con
trols be established at the border to
avoide smuggling and a "buyout" of
East German goods and valuables.
Economists in both countries fear
tourists will sell subsidized goods in the
West to earn hard currency and that
some Westerners may shop for food and
clothing in cheaper East German stores.
