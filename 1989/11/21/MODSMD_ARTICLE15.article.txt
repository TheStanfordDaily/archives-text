## Speedier justice 
### 
Slow investigations
of fraternal-sororal
cases show injustice

FOR NEARLY TWO months,
the Phi Delta Theta frater
nity has been on social
suspension pending an
investigation into an incident in
which a drunk freshman left a Phi
Delt party and was hit by a moving
truck.
For over one month, the Pi Beta
Phi Sorority has been on social
suspension pending an investiga
tion into an incident in which two
students at a Pi Phi semi-formal
were taken to the hospital because
of excessive alcohol consumption.
In both cases, the University has
not determined whether the Greek
organization is at fault for the in
cidents. But, in both cases, the
groups have suffered the penalties
with no determination of wrongdo
ing.
Where is due process? Where is
fair and speedy justice? What is
taking so long?
According to Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Hughes, the Oct.
17 earthquake delayed the inves
tigation process.
But the Phi Delt party was Sept.
29, and there were over two weeks
to investigate the incident and have
a report submitted to Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons before
the quake hit.

Hughes' report was not submit
ted until Oct. 27, but it had to be
re-submitted Nov. 14 because it
needed additions to "put the inci
dents in a historical context."
In the Pi Phi case, the earth
quake occurred just days after the
party in Encina Station, and
Hughes' report was submitted to
Student Affairs Nov. 6.
Now it's Student Affairs' turn to
take its time making a decision on
whether the Phi Delts or Pi Phis
are at fault in either incident. It
has been two weeks since the Pi
Phi report was made and one week
since the revised Phi Delt report
was submitted.
The delays are unacceptable to
both groups, since all of their social
plans have been put on hold indef
initely. Though Hughes has al
lowed both groups to hold their
initiation ceremonies, many tradi
tional social functions during in
itiation time were not possible.
Student Affairs has the right to
suspend the social activities of a
group if it thinks that doing so
will prevent serious incidents from
occurring during the investigation
period, but investigators need to
do a speedy probe of the facts.
If the inquiry will take longer
than a week, officials need to make
it clear to the group and the com
munity why the investigation will
drag on longer.
Otherwise, the fraternity or
sorority might be better off plead
ing guilty and accepting a punish
ment that would probably be
shorter.
