Excluding American Indians from UCMI offensive

LAST THURSDAY, the Under
graduate Committee on Minority
Issues (UCMI) subcommittee on
staff issues released its report stating
that its "recommendations promote a
multiracial university community."
Considering the fact that the re
sponses of American Indian staff
people were completely excluded from
the report, the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) finds this
statement to be arrogant and insulting.
In not including those responses,
UCMI failed the American Indian staff
who work at this university. American
Indian staff people had the highest
response rate of any group in the
report, as they spent countless hours
working with the committee to ensure
a comprehensive analysis of their
responses.
They struggled to make UCMI the
first step toward the creation of an
environment where they feel under-

stood and respected. This exclusion is
a slap in the face for them and a
denigration of their opinions and their
work.
They are not the only ones to suffer:
UCMI failed the greater Stanford
community as well. UCMI was estab
lished to determine how best to achieve
the goal of multiculturalism at Stan
ford, i.e., how to work toward the
successful inclusion of all people at
this university.
But in failing to include an entire
race of people in this report, the
UCMI subcommittee on staff issues
has made an essential error that com
pletely undermines its project, render
ing it virtually meaningless.
The reason given for the exclusion
was the small size of the American
Indian staff population, which could
not be subjected to the sampling tech
niques used for the other populations
in the report. "Statistically insignifi-

ln failing to include an
entire race of people in
this report, UCMI has un
dermined its project to
achieve multiculturalism.

cant" is what the report said in its two
sentences on American Indians.
But UCMI is not about statistics and
it is not about numbers — it is about
people and their existence in this
community. SAIO deplores this over
emphasis on scientific "viability" at the
expense of those whom UCMI was
designed to help.
As students, we see this action as a
statement that the Indian people do
not count and are not included in the
UCMI vision of the Stanford communi-

ty. As we trust UCMI and the Stan
ford community do not hold such a
view, we expect that the report will be
rewritten to include the data from
American Indian staff people, and then
republished to correct their error.
We also expect UCMI to apologize to
the American Indian staff community
and to the University community as a
whole. Then, with the understanding
that the task of educating ourselves
about each other and creating a truly
multicultural community requires a
great deal of work, we can unite to
make a real commitment to that goal
and take bold steps to achieve it.
