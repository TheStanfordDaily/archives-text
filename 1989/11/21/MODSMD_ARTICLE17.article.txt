# Pro-choice students should boycott Domino's Pizza
## 
### 
I would like to alert Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff to the boycott
of Domino's Pizza called for by the
National Organization for Women
(NOW) and related organizations.
Thomas Monaghan, Domino's foun
der, donates hundreds of thousands of
dollars to the pro-life movement. He
has given funds to Operation Rescue
and to other groups with strong anti
choice stances.
Last January, Monaghan and one of
his corporations in Ann Arbor, Michi
gan, gave $60,000 to organizers of a
Michigan referendum which success-

fully barred Medicaid-funded abortions
in that state.
Monaghan also canceled an Ann
Arbor NOW fundraiser when he discov
ered that the purpose was to generate
funds to fight the proposed referen
dum. The fundraiser was to be held at
his publicly available facility, Domino's
Farms. NOW has since filed a civil
rights complaint, on the grounds of
religious discrimination.
Monaghan's name has also been as
sociated with a cult-like order called
Word of God. Several of the leaders of
Word of God have been arrested at
Operation Rescue demonstrations. In
1986, Monaghan gave a $100,000
matching grant to the TV ministry
associated with Word of God.
Knowing the great quantities of
pizza that we students are capable of
ingesting, I appeal to all of you with

strong pro-choice feelings to think
twice before ordering a Domino's Pizza
There are several other pizza chains in
our area that can satisfy a late-night
pizza craving without contributing to
the profits of an anti-choice con
tributor.
