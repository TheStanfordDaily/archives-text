# Flier distributors apologize for use of poor judgment
## 
### 
The Rains Apartments staff regrets
that we distributed a flier for the Nov.
17 Reggae party which members of the

community found to be offensive. We
understood from discussions with
Trinidadian members of the reggae
band that the spear and shield are
embraced by Caribbean and African
cultures as proud symbols of strength
and liberation.
We later realized, however, that such
symbols could be easily interpreted as
racial stereotypes and we issued a new
flier without the controversial images.
Quite simply, we used poor judgment
and we apologize for any pain that the
original flier might have caused.
We planned the Reggae party as a
multicultural event. The Rains resident
assistants share Jaqueline Scott's con
cerns expressed in her letter (Daily,
Nov. 20) and hope that she and others
will continue to contribute their ideas
aa we plan future events.
