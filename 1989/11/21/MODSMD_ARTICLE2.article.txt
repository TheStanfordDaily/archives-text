# Stadium drinking appalls officials
## Alcohol-related incidents at Big Game may lead to policy changes 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
With 27 arrests for alcohol-related in
cidents, Saturday's Big Game has con
vinced University officials that alcohol
use has gotten out of hand at football
games.
University President Donald Kennedy,
who attended the entire game, expressed
dismay at the actions of people there.
"I'm really distressed by what I've seen
this fall, especially at Big Game," he
said. "At a time when people should
have been savoring the victory and en
joying the moment, a lot of people
weren't enjoying it because they were
no longer conscious."
However, Kennedy and other Univer
sity officials said they do not know how
they will respond to the high number
of incidents.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said,
"It's too soon to tell what's going to be

done regarding alcohol policy at the sta
dium." He added, however, that the
events at Big Game "bring up the sub
ject again."
Geiger said he would like to appeal
to the community to "accept the re
sponsibility of behaving at a football
game."
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
called the incidents on Saturday the
worst at a Big Game in 15 years. Most
of the arrests were related to drunken
ness, and several involved battery or
other more serious crimes, Niemeyer
said.
Throughout the game, police were
pelted with rocks and full cans of beer,
according to Niemeyer. Around
halftime, the situation got so bad that
the police decided to don helmets to
protect themselves.
Although many people complained to
the president's office about the police
wearing helmets, Kennedy said heap

proved of the decision, citing the
"extraordinary stresses" placed on the
officers.
"The police didn't come in there
wearing helmets," Kennedy said. "They
had to go back in and put them on to
keep from getting their heads bashed
in."
Two officers were hit in the head
with flying objects during the game,
according to Niemeyer.
Niemeyer blamed the incidents on the
high number of intoxicated people at
the game. He said the late starting time
of the game gave people more time to
tailgate and get drunk before kickoff.
The game started late to accommo
date the schedule of the Pacific Sports
Network, which broadcast Saturday's
game.
Niemeyer noted that there were no
problems of this kind at last month's
