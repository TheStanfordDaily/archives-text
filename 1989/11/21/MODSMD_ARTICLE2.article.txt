# Stadium drinking appalls officials
## Alcohol-related incidents at Big Game may lead to policy changes 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
With 27 arrests for alcohol-related in
cidents, Saturday's Big Game has con
vinced University officials that alcohol
use has gotten out of hand at football
games.
University President Donald Kennedy,
who attended the entire game, expressed
dismay at the actions of people there.
"I'm really distressed by what I've seen
this fall, especially at Big Game," he
said. "At a time when people should
have been savoring the victory and en
joying the moment, a lot of people
weren't enjoying it because they were
no longer conscious."
However, Kennedy and other Univer
sity officials said they do not know how
they will respond to the high number
of incidents.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said,
"It's too soon to tell what's going to be

done regarding alcohol policy at the sta
dium." He added, however, that the
events at Big Game "bring up the sub
ject again."
Geiger said he would like to appeal
to the community to "accept the re
sponsibility of behaving at a football
game."
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
called the incidents on Saturday the
worst at a Big Game in 15 years. Most
of the arrests were related to drunken
ness, and several involved battery or
other more serious crimes, Niemeyer
said.
Throughout the game, police were
pelted with rocks and full cans of beer,
according to Niemeyer. Around
halftime, the situation got so bad that
the police decided to don helmets to
protect themselves.
Although many people complained to
the president's office about the police
wearing helmets, Kennedy said heap

proved of the decision, citing the
"extraordinary stresses" placed on the
officers.
"The police didn't come in there
wearing helmets," Kennedy said. "They
had to go back in and put them on to
keep from getting their heads bashed
in."
Two officers were hit in the head
with flying objects during the game,
according to Niemeyer.
Niemeyer blamed the incidents on the
high number of intoxicated people at
the game. He said the late starting time
of the game gave people more time to
tailgate and get drunk before kickoff.
The game started late to accommo
date the schedule of the Pacific Sports
Network, which broadcast Saturday's
game.
Niemeyer noted that there were no
problems of this kind at last month's
Notre Dame game or the 49ers
game played at Stanford stadium.
Both games had large crowds
comparable in size to the Big
Game's, but they began two and
a half hours earlier, he explained.
Geiger did not consider the late
start an excuse for the incidents.
He said, "We need to be able to
handle a 3:30 p.m. start because
we're probably going to have one
again."
Problems were fairly evenly dis
tributed throughout the stadium,
Niemeyer said, although Geiger
called the Cal section "brutal."
In the Stanford student section,
Mark Andrew Nielsen, an 18-year
old Cal student, jumped over the
fence and attacked the Tree mas
cot. He took the teddy bear
strapped to the back of the tree
and threw it into the stands. Ac
cording to Niemeyer, Nielsen was
intoxicated at the time of the in
cident.
Nielsen was subdued by secu
rity and police forces and charged
with trespassing and resisting ar
rest. He was later released.

In another incident on the Stan
ford side, Shawn Wright, 22,
started fighting with people in the
stands. When security officials
told him to stop, he began fighting
with them. The police then ar
rested him.
According to Niemeyer, Wright
then claimed that he was having
difficulty opening his jaw and that
he was dizzy. Police took him to
Stanford University Medical Cen
ter, where doctors determined
that he was too drunk to take
care of himself.
Wright was charged with bat
tery and being drunk in a public
place. He was released after he
had recovered somewhat from his
intoxication, Niemeyer said.
In the traffic after the game, a
79-year-old man was hit by a
drunk driver on Serra Street in
front of the police and fire sta
tions.
The victim was taken to the
hospital and was released yester
day. Because the car was not mov
ing quickly, the injuries were
fairly minor, Niemeyer said.
The driver, Robert Robbins,
was charged with a felony for in
juring someone while driving un
der the influence.
