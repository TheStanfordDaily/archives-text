## Delusions of grandeur 
### 
NOW THAT WE have won another
Big Game and left the Weenies
axeless for the third consecutive
year, it's time to reflect on just how spe
cial we are here at the Farm. C'mon, we
all do it. You're at a restaurant and you
joke sarcastically about becoming a
bartender after graduation. Or you talk
to a friend at a community college and
gloat about what a good education you're
getting at Stanford.
At Stanford, we're not just special,
we're more virtuous. Our brains and mo
tivation obviously translate to a higher
sense of ethics. Being at Stanford guaran
tees us an environment of high morals,
open minds and intellectual stimulation.
We have every right to expect Stanford
to be a place without crime, racism or
inequity. When someone steals a wheel
chair from a student, we have every right
to be outraged. We should call the per
petrator a bastard again and again until
the wheelchair gets returned.
As I've said before, this is Stanford,
and we are obviously better than people
in the real world. Bikes can be left un
locked; dorm rooms should be left opened.
If by chance something does go wrong,
it must be some outsider who wandered
aimlessly onto campus.
Stanford students are so special that
when Stanford police apprehend a
Berkeley student at Big Game, we cheer.
When the police jerk the student's head
back by the hair and tie up his legs, we
cheer. When the police hit the student's
face into a steering wheel, we continue
to cheer, "More, more!"
If you weren't at Big Game or if you

missed this incident, I don't want to lead
you astray. It wasn't the acts of the police
that disturbed me â€” they may have been
acting out of necessity. What disturbed
me were the cheers of the crowd. People
wanted more violence.
Then, I realized that I have no right
to be disturbed. This bloodthirsty reac
tion is not out of the ordinary. At football
games everyone yells to maim or hurt
the opposing team. Whether this is bad
or not, it's normal, and Stanford students
do not deviate from this norm.
Anyone questioning just how "normal"
Stanford students are should take a quick
tour of the Green Library basement.
Notice the graffiti on the desks: "School
is tough and so is muff." This is one of
the tamer messages. On the desks and
even in the books one can find statements
which range from utter sexual frustration
to violent sexual dominance. The vast
msyority of people in Green are Stanford
students. So, surprisingly enough, the
vast majority of graffiti is probably done
by Stanford students.
In the bathrooms one can also find
evidence of just how normal we are.
People who leave faucets running, don't
flush the toilet or forget to mop up their
vomit all have the idea that someone else
should do it for them. They think they're
at Stanford and they're special. But go
into any public restroom and (surprise,
surprise) you'll find the exact same
messes. Hmm.. . Maybe it's normal not
to want to clean up after yourself.
So what does this all boil down to?
Stanford students have bloodthirsty re
actions when they're in large groups.

Danger arises when we
assume that because we
are at Stanford we can ex
pect more from people.

They have tendencies to deface private
property when they're alone. And they
are often inconsiderate. Maybe we should
change our admission policies.
But the truth of the matter is, there
is no solution. It's not that Stanford stu
dents have some dark side to them which
I've managed to expose with this column,
it'B just that people in general have bad
tendencies which they have to work to
correct.
The danger arises when we assume
that because we are at Stanford, we can
expect more from people. On the con
trary, because we are at Stanford, we
should expect more from ourselves.
So next time you think, "Wouldn't you
expect more from Stanford students?"
You should realize that these are just
delusions of Stanford grandeur. And what
should we do about these delusions? Give
'em the axe, the axe, the axe.
