## Geology prof. shows nature in action Course stresses field-based learning 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer 
Marco Einaudi couldn't have
asked for a better "learning ex
perience" for his Geology 1 stu
dents than the Oct. 17 earthquake
that rocked the Bay Area.
"The quake was useful in this
class," Einaudi said. "It was an
excellent focal point for discus
sion, because everyone had expe
rienced it and was excited about
it, and everyone had questions."
For Einaudi, a professor of ge
ology, such experience is a key
factor in teaching students about
the processes that shape and
change the earth. "Geology is an
active kind of science," he said.
"Most of the concepts that
you learn in an introductory
course are field-based."
To help his students grasp those
concepts, Einaudi has structured
Geology 1 around a series of labs
and field trips focusing upon dif
ferent geological features in the
region surrounding Stanford. For
instance, two weeks ago students
in the course traveled into the
Foothills on Old Page Mill Road
to view a trace of the San Andreas
Fault.
The trip to the fault had been
part of Einaudi's lesson plans
before the earthquake, but the
Oct. 17 shakeup made students
especially interested in the
evidence of seismic activity in the
Bay Area. "The quake had a major
effect on student interest in the
course," said Einaudi, who
devoted a lecture and a half to
the quake when the class re
convened during the week follow
ing the temblor.
The Oct. 17 quake interfered
with more than Einaudi's lec
tures; it also forced Einaudi to
cancel a class field trip to Half
Moon Bay scheduled for Sunday,
Oct. 22.
The trip was designed to add
to information about the Califor
nia coastline that the class of 53
students had gathered on an ex
cursion two weeks earlier. On that
occasion the class left at 7 a.m.
on Sunday to spend the day study
ing the geological features of the
coastline at Half Moon Bay.
"There's some geology in action
going on there which sort of
speaks to the observer," Einaudi

'Most people don't
choose to become
geologists by
reading about it;
they choose geol
ogy because they
appreciate the out
doors and enjoy
being outside.'

said. "The creation of ripple dunes
on the surface of the sand as the
surf withdraws, the collapse of sea
cliffs due to coastal erosion —
those things are fairly obvious."
But the purpose of field trips
to places like Half Moon Bay, San
Francisquito Creek and even the
San Andreas Fault is not to point
out the obvious. Rather, Einaudi
and his teaching assistants hope
to lead students toward a better
understanding of both the geologi
cal processes that formed the
region and the field of geology
itself.
Jim Farrel, a senior who is
taking the course, enjoys the trips.
"They're fun," he said. "I think
I'll remember them more than
anything else in the course."
Peter Rumelhart, a teaching as
sistant for the Geology 1 course,
feels the field trips make the
course more challenging for both
TAs and students. "It's a challenge
for me to formulate my ideas in
such a way that somebody who
hasn't taken any Geo courses can
understand," he said.
Rumelhart believes the trips are
valuable not only as a teaching
tool but also as a way of getting
students interested in studying ge
ology. "The trips show the stu
dents what a geologist really
does," he said.
Einaudi agrees. "The field is
the place where one's interest in
geology was born," Einaudi said.
"Most people don't choose to be
come geologists by reading about
it; they choose geology because
they appreciate the outdoors and

enjoy being outside."
When the class traveled to the
tributary near Portola Valley that
formed the alluvial plain upon
which Stanford rests, Rumelhart
made his way across slippery
boulders to point out a fault on
the other side of the stream in
response to a student's question.
Although he only got slightly
wet, Rumelhart's "heroism" in
the face of challenging questions
is an example of the kind of in
dividual attention the Geology 1
TAs lavish upon their sections.
"One of the real benefits of this
course is the high percentage of

teaching assistants," Rumelhart
said. "There aren't that many
courses at Stanford where you get
10 TAs for a class of 53 people."
Einaudi would like to see some
of those 53 students choose to
major in geology. Einaudi blames
the current dearth of jobs in the
petroleum and minerals industry
for the dearth of geology majors
at Stanford — there are only five.
"Students see earth sciences as
not a major job market at this
point," Einaudi said. "But things
are really turning around. The
important point is that there are
always jobs for good students."

to information about the Califor
nia coastline that the class of 53
students had gathered on an ex
cursion two weeks earlier. On that
occasion the class left at 7 a.m.
on Sunday to spend the day study
ing the geological features of the
coastline at Half Moon Bay.
"There's some geology in action
going on there which sort of
speaks to the observer," Einaudi

'Most people don't
choose to become
geologists by
reading about it;
they choose geol
ogy because they
appreciate the out
doors and enjoy
being outside.'

said. "The creation of ripple dunes
on the surface of the sand as the
surf withdraws, the collapse of sea
cliffs due to coastal erosion —
those things are fairly obvious."
But the purpose of field trips
to places like Half Moon Bay, San
Francisquito Creek and even the
San Andreas Fault is not to point
out the obvious. Rather, Einaudi
and his teaching assistants hope
to lead students toward a better
understanding of both the geologi
cal processes that formed the
region and the field of geology
itself.
Jim Farrel, a senior who is
taking the course, enjoys the trips.
"They're fun," he said. "I think
I'll remember them more than
anything else in the course."
Peter Rumelhart, a teaching as
sistant for the Geology 1 course,
feels the field trips make the
course more challenging for both
TAs and students. "It's a challenge
for me to formulate my ideas in
such a way that somebody who
hasn't taken any Geo courses can
understand," he said.
Rumelhart believes the trips are
valuable not only as a teaching
tool but also as a way of getting
students interested in studying ge
ology. "The trips show the stu
dents what a geologist really
does," he said.
Einaudi agrees. "The field is
the place where one's interest in
geology was born," Einaudi said.
"Most people don't choose to be
come geologists by reading about
it; they choose geology because
they appreciate the outdoors and

enjoy being outside."
When the class traveled to the
tributary near Portola Valley that
formed the alluvial plain upon
which Stanford rests, Rumelhart
made his way across slippery
boulders to point out a fault on
the other side of the stream in
response to a student's question.
Although he only got slightly
wet, Rumelhart's "heroism" in
the face of challenging questions
is an example of the kind of in
dividual attention the Geology 1
TAs lavish upon their sections.
"One of the real benefits of this
course is the high percentage of

teaching assistants," Rumelhart
said. "There aren't that many
courses at Stanford where you get
10 TAs for a class of 53 people."
Einaudi would like to see some
of those 53 students choose to
major in geology. Einaudi blames
the current dearth of jobs in the
petroleum and minerals industry
for the dearth of geology majors
at Stanford — there are only five.
"Students see earth sciences as
not a major job market at this
point," Einaudi said. "But things
are really turning around. The
important point is that there are
always jobs for good students."

Marco Einaudi couldn't have
asked for a better "learning ex
perience" for his Geology 1 stu
dents than the Oct. 17 earthquake
that rocked the Bay Area.
"The quake was useful in this
class," Einaudi said. "It was an
excellent focal point for discus
sion, because everyone had expe
rienced it and was excited about
it, and everyone had questions."
For Einaudi, a professor of ge
ology, such experience is a key
factor in teaching students about
the processes that shape and
change the earth. "Geology is an
active kind of science," he said.
"Most of the concepts that
you learn in an introductory
course are field-based."
To help his students grasp those
concepts, Einaudi has structured
Geology 1 around a series of labs
and field trips focusing upon dif
ferent geological features in the
region surrounding Stanford. For
instance, two weeks ago students
in the course traveled into the
Foothills on Old Page Mill Road
to view a trace of the San Andreas
Fault.
The trip to the fault had been
part of Einaudi's lesson plans
before the earthquake, but the
Oct. 17 shakeup made students
especially interested in the
evidence of seismic activity in the
Bay Area. "The quake had a major
effect on student interest in the
course," said Einaudi, who
devoted a lecture and a half to
the quake when the class re
convened during the week follow
ing the temblor.
The Oct. 17 quake interfered
with more than Einaudi's lec
tures; it also forced Einaudi to
cancel a class field trip to Half
Moon Bay scheduled for Sunday,
Oct. 22.
