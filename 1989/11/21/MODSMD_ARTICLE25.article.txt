# Children Now opens first college campus chapter
## 
### Michelle Latvala 
Stanford lecturer Jim Steyer
founded the statewide organi
zation Children Now in 1987
to increase awareness and pro
mote activism regarding
children's issues. Graduate stu
dent Jennie Glockner brought
the organization to Stanford
this October, starting a chapter
"to utilize the people and the
resources of Stanford to be a
voice for children."
Glockner hopes the Stanford
chapter will get students in
volved in educating people
about children's issues and
working toward prevention of
problems rather than ineffec
tually responding after prob
lems have occurred.

Steyer, a former civil rights
lawyer, envisions that the
pioneering chapter at Stanford
will be just the beginning of
several such campus groups
around the state. "Young
people should be leaders on
children's issues," Steyer sug
gested. "It's out of direct expe
rience and involvement that
advocacy comes — people will
get frustrated with current sit
uations and want to do more."

Children Now at Stanford
plans not only to educate the
Stanford community about the
needs of California's youth, but
also to get involved with re
search. The chapter plans to
accomplish these goals either
by identifying a school district
or organization that needs
some specific information, or
by targeting current research
and making it more available
to people who need it.
Other goals include affecting
the political agenda for children
through talking with local leg
islators or sending delegations,
and also promoting volun
teerism in general. "We want
to make it as easy as possible
for people to get involved," ex
plained Glockner, "and to let
them know that by doing so
they are being constructive —
that they really can make a
difference." Another member,
Bryan Taylor, said, "Children
are not a controversial or bi
partisan issue — everyone has
been a child at some time and
wants to help kids."
Steyer started Children Now
as a statewide organization
with the idea of it being a voice
for kids since they cannot vote.
"We've failed to invest in our
kids," he explained. "We need
to change policy but we also
need to change the way people
think about their priorities and
their values." He envisioned
Children Now as complement
ing the work of other advocacy
groups by acting as a facilitator
between organizations and
people that need their help.
Children Now does not pro
vide direct services to children,
but rather identifies the prob
lems in education and health
policy and proposes strategies
that have been effective in the
past in helping and preventing
them. Children Now put out a
report card on California's
children this past summer,
