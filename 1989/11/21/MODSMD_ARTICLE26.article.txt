# New conductor brings fresh outlook to symphony
## 
### Alison Derbenwick 
"In this section of 'Petrouchka,'
the peasants are happy because
they have a new porch," says the
tall man at the podium.
"A new Porsche?" quips a
violist, and Braun Rehearsal Hall
fills with laughter. Conductor
Peter Jaffe joins in, but the next
minute his baton is raised, and
he becomes very serious about
doing what he loves to do most
— make music.
Jaffe is at Stanford this year
as a visiting associate professor,
on leave from Pomona College.
Since his arrival in June, he has
thrown himself into his work and
has already brought new life to
the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra. He initiated interest in a
Halloween Spectacular which was
a big success. He is also helping
to plan an overseas tour for next
summer. Jaffe has the capability
to infuse old traditions with new
thoughts and vitality, creating a
group that makes music and gives
it to an audience as a living gift.
"My philosophy about conduct
ing is that the conductor acts as
a kind of conduit of musical en
ergy which comes from informed
study of what the composer
wishes. But then the energy flows
through the conductor in such a
way that it can aid and encourage
a group of musicians to play. After
all," he said, "the instrumentalists
are the people who are actually
making the sounds."
There is, however, more in
volved in Jaffe's job than conduct
ing the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra. He also conducts the
Stanford Chamber Orchestra and
teaches conducting and music the
ory. Yet Jaffe feels he is a con
ductor first and foremost. His
goal is "to inspire the orchestra
to play better than it can possibly
play." Jaffe noted that this idea
seems nonsensical, but clarified:
"There really is a sense in an
orchestra that the sum of the
whole is greater than the addition
of the individual parts. There are

really great moments in perform
ances when people really do excel
themselves and play, and creating
that atmosphere and inspiring the
conditions under which it can ex
ist is a principal goal."
Jaffe has other musical goals
as well. He feels that it is crucial
that "the composer sounds fresh
and that the piece feels alive." He
likened a good conductor to a good
actor. "The quality of a truly great
actor is that you don't see the
person acting. You hear the au
thor, or the composer, speaking
to you," he said.
Jaffe also has particular con
ceptions about the way a conduc
tor should approach a score. "The
philosophy changes from decade
to decade, and we're in a more
informed era where we go back
to the sources and we look at the
composer. But after all, (scores
are) only black and white symbols
on a page, and you can't really
tell exactly what the composer
wished," Jaffe said. "And if you
do nothing at all as far as your
own musical background goes and
play strictly what's on the page,
I don't think in any era the music
will sound fresh or alive," he
noted.
Jaffe's love of music began at
a very young age, and he learned
to play piano, violin and viola. He
has absolute pitch, which means
that he can identify a note simply
by hearing it. One of his favorite
family stories is from when he
was 5. His father was away on
business, and "there was a very
ominous storm outside with a lot
of thunder and lightning. There
were many weird, creaking noises
outside, too. My mother heard
something and went, 'What's
that?!' and little Peter said, 'B
flat!' "
His interest in conducting grew
out of his love of music. Jaffe said
that when he played in orchestras
as a youth, he "was always fasci
nated with the parts that other
people were playing." He added
that as he got older, he "just be
came more and more fascinated

with conducting; it seemed more
fulfilling to me somehow. I liked
hearing how all the parts fit to
gether, and there's something
wonderful about having a group
of 100 people help you make
music."
Jaffe has taught at Pomona Col
lege for the past six years, and
before that he was conductor of
the University of Chicago Cham
ber Orchestra for two years. He
has been on the faculty at the
Aspen Music Festival as a con
ductor and a pianist. He attended
Oberlin College and Conservatory
of Music as an undergraduate
where he received his degrees in
music and mathematics, and he
received a graduate degree from
the Stanford Music Department.
Jaffe said "there are a lot of

things I love about (Stanford) and
it's great to, in a way, come home.
But then there are many times I
have to keep reminding myself to
keep my mind open because
things might be quite different
(than they were when he was here
as a graduate student)." He noted
that he enjoys Stanford's "very
invigorating atmosphere," and
added, "I've had very few experi
ences with college orchestras that
have a governance system like this
orchestra, where the students are
so motivated to go out and create
their own committees and plan
their own tours and their own
activities. I think it's just won
derful."
Jaffe feels it is not unusual that
he does not have a favorite piece
of music. "In fact, one of my goals

is that whatever piece I'm doing
at that point is the piece I'm really
in love with," he said.
Jaffe feels that his contact with
the players in the orchestra is of
the utmost importance. He talked
about giving his family time which
today would be termed "quality
time," and then said, "It's the
same thing in an orchestra. I may
only be able to look at a player
for a split second, so I try to make
that contact as important and as
vital as possible."
According to Jaffe, so far his
experiences this year have been
wonderful. "This orchestra has
had many different periods of
golden years, and it's a luxury for
me just to come in and be a part
of that history."

way that it can aid and encourage
a group of musicians to play. After
all," he said, "the instrumentalists
are the people who are actually
making the sounds."
There is, however, more in
volved in Jaffe's job than conduct
ing the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra. He also conducts the
Stanford Chamber Orchestra and
teaches conducting and music the
ory. Yet Jaffe feels he is a con
ductor first and foremost. His
goal is "to inspire the orchestra
to play better than it can possibly
play." Jaffe noted that this idea
seems nonsensical, but clarified:
"There really is a sense in an
orchestra that the sum of the
whole is greater than the addition
of the individual parts. There are

really great moments in perform
ances when people really do excel
themselves and play, and creating
that atmosphere and inspiring the
conditions under which it can ex
ist is a principal goal."
Jaffe has other musical goals
as well. He feels that it is crucial
that "the composer sounds fresh
and that the piece feels alive." He
likened a good conductor to a good
actor. "The quality of a truly great
actor is that you don't see the
person acting. You hear the au
thor, or the composer, speaking
to you," he said.
Jaffe also has particular con
ceptions about the way a conduc
tor should approach a score. "The
philosophy changes from decade
to decade, and we're in a more
informed era where we go back
to the sources and we look at the
composer. But after all, (scores
are) only black and white symbols
on a page, and you can't really
tell exactly what the composer
wished," Jaffe said. "And if you
do nothing at all as far as your
own musical background goes and
play strictly what's on the page,
I don't think in any era the music
will sound fresh or alive," he
noted.
Jaffe's love of music began at
a very young age, and he learned
to play piano, violin and viola. He
has absolute pitch, which means
that he can identify a note simply
by hearing it. One of his favorite
family stories is from when he
was 5. His father was away on
business, and "there was a very
ominous storm outside with a lot
of thunder and lightning. There
were many weird, creaking noises
outside, too. My mother heard
something and went, 'What's
that?!' and little Peter said, 'B
flat!' "
His interest in conducting grew
out of his love of music. Jaffe said
that when he played in orchestras
as a youth, he "was always fasci
nated with the parts that other
people were playing." He added
that as he got older, he "just be
came more and more fascinated

with conducting; it seemed more
fulfilling to me somehow. I liked
hearing how all the parts fit to
gether, and there's something
wonderful about having a group
of 100 people help you make
music."
Jaffe has taught at Pomona Col
lege for the past six years, and
before that he was conductor of
the University of Chicago Cham
ber Orchestra for two years. He
has been on the faculty at the
Aspen Music Festival as a con
ductor and a pianist. He attended
Oberlin College and Conservatory
of Music as an undergraduate
where he received his degrees in
music and mathematics, and he
received a graduate degree from
the Stanford Music Department.
Jaffe said "there are a lot of

things I love about (Stanford) and
it's great to, in a way, come home.
But then there are many times I
have to keep reminding myself to
keep my mind open because
things might be quite different
(than they were when he was here
as a graduate student)." He noted
that he enjoys Stanford's "very
invigorating atmosphere," and
added, "I've had very few experi
ences with college orchestras that
have a governance system like this
orchestra, where the students are
so motivated to go out and create
their own committees and plan
their own tours and their own
activities. I think it's just won
derful."
Jaffe feels it is not unusual that
he does not have a favorite piece
of music. "In fact, one of my goals

is that whatever piece I'm doing
at that point is the piece I'm really
in love with," he said.
Jaffe feels that his contact with
the players in the orchestra is of
the utmost importance. He talked
about giving his family time which
today would be termed "quality
time," and then said, "It's the
same thing in an orchestra. I may
only be able to look at a player
for a split second, so I try to make
that contact as important and as
vital as possible."
According to Jaffe, so far his
experiences this year have been
wonderful. "This orchestra has
had many different periods of
golden years, and it's a luxury for
me just to come in and be a part
of that history."

"In this section of 'Petrouchka,'
the peasants are happy because
they have a new porch," says the
tall man at the podium.
"A new Porsche?" quips a
violist, and Braun Rehearsal Hall
fills with laughter. Conductor
Peter Jaffe joins in, but the next
minute his baton is raised, and
he becomes very serious about
doing what he loves to do most
— make music.
Jaffe is at Stanford this year
as a visiting associate professor,
on leave from Pomona College.
Since his arrival in June, he has
thrown himself into his work and
has already brought new life to
the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra. He initiated interest in a
Halloween Spectacular which was
a big success. He is also helping
to plan an overseas tour for next
summer. Jaffe has the capability
to infuse old traditions with new
thoughts and vitality, creating a
group that makes music and gives
it to an audience as a living gift.
"My philosophy about conduct
ing is that the conductor acts as
a kind of conduit of musical en
ergy which comes from informed
study of what the composer
wishes. But then the energy flows
through the conductor in such a
way that it can aid and encourage
a group of musicians to play. After
all," he said, "the instrumentalists
