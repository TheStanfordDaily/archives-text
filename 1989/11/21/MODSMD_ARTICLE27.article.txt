## Stanford football sets sights on land of milk and honey Recruits, returnees promise wins, despite rough schedule 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
When the final gun sounded in
Big Game Saturday, it marked the
end of the 1989 season for the
Stanford Cardinal. It was the
team's third losing season in a
row and the eighth this decade.
Why then, were all the players
so optimistic after the game? Do
they really sense better days on
the horizon?
The answer is a resounding yes.
And, though this may be some
what surprising, the players have
felt this way all season — even
while mired in the depths of the
losing streak.
Fueling this wave of positive
feeling is Coach Denny Green.
Taking over in the middle of
recruiting season last year, Green
still managed to bring in a top
notch class his first time around.
He then threw the Stanford
playbook on the scrap heap and
started fresh. Along the way,
there have been some growing
pains.
At times, some players have
been lost in the new schemes. In
juries left many of the Cardinal's
best players on the bench this past
year.
Still, everyone agrees down the
road the payoff will become ap
parent. Perhaps as early as next
year.
Though the schedule will be
brutal — it includes Colorado,
Notre Dame and the usual com
plement of Pacific 10 Conference
powerhouses — Stanford looks to
have a winning season on the
strength of its returnees in several
areas and another excellent
recruiting class.
Position by position, here's how
things stack up for 1990:
Quarterback: Brian Johnson
seemed certain to be headed for
the Yankees. Steve Smith didn't
have a good enough season to
guarantee him the starting spot.
John Lynch showed some scram
bling ability in limited action.
Jason Palumbis is having shoul
der surgery in the hopes that he'll
improve his velocity.
Oh, and Green promises to
recruit at least one quarterback

class.

to push them all. This area is, as
it has been since 1986, uncertain.
Running backs: Whoever takes
the helm will look great handing
off to these guys. Glyn Milburn
seems a sure starter at halfback
and is destined for greatness. The
Oklahoma transfer will do his best
to rewrite the record books in his
three years.
Backing up Milburn will be
some combination of the talented
J.J. Lasley and the hopefully
recovered-from-injury Charlie
Young.
At fullback, Jon Volpe and
Ellery Roberts (a transfer from
Miami) provide speed, strength
and talent. Tommy Vardell, who
showed some flashes, also returns.
This backfield corps will be
among the best in the conference.
Guaranteed.
Receivers: Ed McCaffrey will be
the Pac-10's best returnee next
year. Veterans Jon Pinckney,
Chris Walsh and Walter Batson
are also due back.
Pinckney was especially impres
sive toward the end of the season.
Expect them all to be pushed by
David Calomese and Darrien Gor
don, two freshmen who arrived
with impressive credentials and
saw limited action.
Stanford will be able to send
out two or three game breakers
at all times. The only dark cloud
is the threat of McCaffrey turning
pro. It's unlikely, but possible.
Tight end: Turner Baur will
likely fill the big shoes left by Jim
Price. His continued development
will be critical.
Offensive line: The operative

word here is BIG, as in 300-pound
Bob Whitfield BIG. There is so
much size and talent available
here that three-year letterman
Darran Baird might not be back
for his fifth year.
Whitfield will be joined by cur
rent and future starters Chuck
Gillingham and Rick Pallow. If
Baird returns, he'll start. If not,
Steve Hoyem, who Green says is
"bigger than Bob Whitfield, if you
can believe that," Brian Cassidy
and Glen Cavanaugh are among
the other candidates for starting
jobs.
The line, which developed into
a solid run blocking group in the
last few games, should be a
strength in 1990. Teamed with all
the talent in the backfield, strong
offensive line play should fuel a
potent offensive attack. Green
would like to rush for 200 yards
per game. That would be an im
provement of better than 100
yards from '89. It is not impos
sible.
Defensive line: Question marks
abound as the graduation of
Lester Archambeau leaves a tre
mendous gap. On the plus side,
Aaron Rembisz settled in nicely
at nose guard and seems likely to
get better. The unit did a solid
job of stuffing the run even when
playing against bigger offensive
lines.
The minus is that Stanford got
very little pressure on opposing
QBs this year. Green hopes to ad
dress this need in recruiting.
Overall, the development of
players like tackle Matt
Borkowski will play a major role
in determining how far Stanford
can go.
Linebackers: Normally, the loss
of a Rob Hinckley to the NFL
would be devastating. But
Hinckley missed much of the
season with an injury and the
team has already seen what the
future will be like without him.
What hurts the most is that
Bruce Lang, who starts outside
opposite Hinckley, is also gradu
ating. Again, filling this void is
critical. Look to Vince Otoupal
and Chris Hawkins for help. It

Bear Quarterbacks Beware!
Junior Jono Tunney, Stanford's leading tackier the past two years, looks to spearhead a 1990 defense
at his inside linebacker position. Along with the defense, the Cardinal offense will showcase some
new weapons next year as Coach Denny Green hopes to lead Stanford into the promised land.
also seems possible that freshman
Dave Garnett, who had an im
pressive season, will be moved
outside.
Inside, Jono Tunney comes
back looking for a senior season
even more spectacular than his
last two campaigns. Tunney is the
defensive leader and will be called
upon to provide leadership for the
younger players. Eric Pierce also
returns after a strong second half.
Cornerbacks: Four-year starter
Alan Grant is gone, but Albert
Richardson and Tuan Van Le —
two big-play types — are back.
Freshman Ron Redell, at 6-foot-3
should also challenge for playing
time. This unit should possess the
skill and arrogance to improve a
Stanford pass defense that was
spotty at times in 1989.

Safeties: Kevin Scott moved to
free safety after Tony Trousset
went down and excelled. He
should get even better. With Rob
Englehardt gone, look for Trous
set — who was among the team's
leading tacklers — to return and
play well.
Freshmen Jimmy Klein and
Herbie Berry also made their
marks here. All told, the second
ary should benefit from the expe
rience all the young players re
ceived this year.
Kicking game: John Hopkins
was disappointing in '89 after an
excellent '88. Still, the junior
placekicker was virtually perfect
inside of 40 and nailed a couple
of long ones.
Paul Stonehouse, a high school
All-American, failed to impress at
punter. Until Big Game, that is.
Stonehouse averaged 44 yards per
punt against California. Eleven
games like that would put
Stonehouse among the nation's

leaders. Label it possible.
Intangibles: Stanford opens on
the road at Colorado and UCLA.
The team then meets Oregon
State and San Jose State here.
Those games are followed by a
Notre Dame showdown in South
Bend and a Stanford Stadium visit
by the Trojans.
The second half of the season
includes road games at Oregon,
Arizona and Cal with home con
tests versus Washington and
Washington State. It doesn't take
a rocket scientist to realize that
a winning season will be tough.
But the Cardinal is rejuvenated.
It has the winning attitude and
a coach dedicated to bringing Ail-
Americans and first-round draft
picks to Stanford.
The '80s haven't been a vintage
decade for Stanford football, but
the '90s are a chance to start
anew. Though the wait for next
season is a long one, there's a
good chance it'll be worth it.
