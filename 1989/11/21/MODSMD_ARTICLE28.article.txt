# Berkeley should stop whining, quit lying, start respecting

### 
The best thing about Big Game
week, aside from kicking Cal's Axe,
is getting to know our cross-Bay
rivals just a little bit better.
This year we got a greater chance than
usual as the Cardinal met California in
football, water polo, women's volleyball,
men's swimming, women's swimming,
women's tennis, men's fencing and wom
en's fencing over the course of last week.
Needless to say, Stanford came out on
top in all but one of those events. But
that's not the issue. The issue at stake
here is what we think of them and what
they think of us.
To begin our discussion, here are some
quotes Cal linebacker David Ortega came
up with for the San Jose Mercury News
before Big Game: "Stanford is pampered,
we aren't. Once you're in at Stanford,
you can't fail. Sometimes it seems like
they want you to fail here. They have
all rich kids. We have some, but we're
mostly a blue-collar school. And we have
homeless in Berkeley. They don't have
homeless down there."

When Ortega was asked if he could see
himself at Stanford, he replied, "Are you
kidding? I live in Oakland."
Clearly this man is a goof. Or some
thing.
True, you can't fail a class at Stanford.
But it's not easy to get A's when everyone
in your class was a high school valedic
torian. If the Farm is full of rich kids,
how come 70 percent of all students are
on some form of financial aid?

If there aren't any homeless here, what
is East Palo Alto? Do people sleep on the
streets because that's the way yuppies
go camping? I think not.
And when Ortega said he couldn't fit
in here because he was from Oakland,
did he mean the same Oakland that Car
dinal quarterback Brian Johnson is from?
All right, perhaps that's enough
abuse for Mr. Ortega. But he's not
the only screwed-up Berkeleyite.
A good friend of mine from high school
went to Cal. I still think he's cool and
have always rooted for Cal against most
other schools. Basically, I was never a
Bear hater.
After Saturday, however, I don't know.
It all started during the national an
them. As anyone who has arrived on time
to a Stanford football team knows, the
first half of the Band's version of the
song is played by only one trumpet player.
It's pretty cool, in my opinion. Except
Saturday I couldn't hear the trumpeter.
The Cal rooting section was too busy

yipping, yapping and telling people to
"Take off that red shirt," for people to
hear our national anthem.
Classy, don't you think?
Then the sections started to
throw things at the Stanford Band
and any Cardinal football player who
came within range.
I was down on the field at the end of
the game and examined the evidence:
oranges, tomatoes and apples, oh my.
What is the purpose here? Are the fans
so malicious that they want to hit people
with high-velocity frozen fruit projectiles
just because that person didn't want to
go to the same college?
Or are they just throwing the stuff to
be cool, while not really wanting to hurt
anyone? Either way, it seems pretty dumb
to carry pounds of food across the Bay
just to throw it.
The fans also threw food and rocks at
the Clydesdale horses that paraded
around the field. Now even though I
really don't like horses, animals should

not be subjected to this sort of thing,
especially for no reason.
r | sad thing is that these people
end up representing their school.
JL While Ortega said some stupid
things, he 8 a fine football player, as are
Troy Taylor, Brian Treggs, Robbie Keen
and Joel Dickson.
But when they go out on the field and
play their hearts out, all people remember
are the stupid fans.
It's one thing to cheer and support
your team, but acting like a jerk is a
whole different ballgame.
So next time you go to a game feel
free to cheer the good guys and make a
lot of noise when it will distract the bad
guys (shooting free throws comes to mind
as an example).
Just leave the fruit at home.

venture to the East Bay any time soon as
he might not be well-received.
