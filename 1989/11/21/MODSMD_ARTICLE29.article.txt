# Men's golf holds 3rd, women 6th in desert
## 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
The desert setting provided an
oasis for the men's golf team,
which is in third place after yes
terday's opening round of the
UCLA Intercollegiate in Palm
Springs, Calif.
Success has proven as fleeting
as a mirage for the women Car
dinal linksters, who concluded the
first day of competition in sixth
place.
The men's team trails the
leading Oregon Ducks by five
strokes, while host UCLA is in
second place.
The Cardinal was led by Senior
Mark Funseth, whose scorching
one-under par 69 tamed the de
manding Mission Hills course and
earned him a share of the lead.
Funseth is tied with the Uni
versity of the Pacific's Robert
Warreri in the battle for individual
honors.
Sophomore Christian Cevaer
and junior Johan Remmelgas
aided in the drive for the team
title, as each posted a 73.
Seniors Steve White and Don
Christiansen fired steady rounds
of 76 and 77, to facilitate Stan
ford's early success.
Coach Wally Goodwin was

"satisfied" with the team's early
showing.
"We're definitely in good posi
tion. Everything has worked well
so far and we're sitting within
striking distance," he said.
The women's team entered this
event well aware of the formidable
task which awaited it. Nine of the
nation's top ten teams are repre
sented at the Bruin Classic.
No one was prepared for the
super-human effort that Arizona
State's Brandie Rurton put forth
yesterday.
Burton demonstrated why she
is currently recognized as the
number-one amateur in the world
with a stunning seven-under par
67 that brought the venerable
Mission Hills links to its knees.
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin
assessed Burton's memorable per
fomance as "simply incredible."
The Cardinal trails leading Ar
izona State by 19 strokes.
Baldwin candidly described his
squad's play as "average."
Junior Jodi Figley posted a 77,
while sophomore Audrey Wooding
and senior Stephanie Parel carded
78s.
Sophomore Adele Moore
finished with an uncharacteristic
79, while sophomore Stephanie
Davis suffered an 83.
