# Accounts offered of alleged assault
## Four say they spoke to or saw girl following incident at Deke party 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
Four individuals with information rel
evant to the investigation of an alleged
sexual assault at a campus fraternity
party have told The Daily they spoke
with or saw the young girl who was
allegedly assaulted.
An investigation of the incident by
the Dean of Student Affairs Office and
the Stanford Police began after Univer
sity officials received a letter claiming
a girl had been sexually assaulted by
two men in a stall in the second-floor
bathroom of the Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity house at an Oct. 6 party.
Based on his initial reading of the
letter, Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes, who is investigating the claims
for Student Affairs, told The Daily on
Nov. 9 that "it sound[ed] like the
woman heard of the incident second-,
third-, or even fourth-hand."

The following day, Jill Salak, the au
thor of the letter, met with Hughes.
Salak, a sophomore at Monterey Penin
sula College, told him, and later The
Daily, that she had in fact talked directly
to the girl.
According to Salak, the alleged victim
was a 13-year-old girl who has since
turned 14. Salak said she knew the
girl's age because the two have mutual
acquaintances.
Salak said she spoke with the girl
soon after the alleged assault while the
girl was sitting on a couch in the front
hall of the Deke house.
"I walked up to the girl and asked
her if she was physically harmed. She
was really shaken up and bawling," said
Salak, a 20-year-old resident of Pacific
Grove. "She also seemed drunk on top
of being upset. She said she was OK,
and I asked her if she would come with
me and try to find the [assailants].
"She wasn't willing to get up, but

gave me a really general description of
the guys. She also said that she thought
they were Cal Poly (California Polytech
nic State University) students," Salak
said.
Salak said she tried to look for the
men the girl described but had no suc
cess.
Peter Rodolpho, guitarist for Circus
of Voodoo â€” the band at the party, said
he spoke to the alleged victim this past
weekend. "It happened. I know it hap
pened," he said.
Salak and the alleged victim, as well
as many others who are not affiliated
with the University, attended the party
to see the band, Salak said. According
to Rodolpho, the band has a following
of nearly 1,000 people.
Salak said she has seen the girl in
the past at parties in Palo Alto.
The girl arrived with another ac-
