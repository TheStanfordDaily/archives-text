# Accounts offered of alleged assault
## Four say they spoke to or saw girl following incident at Deke party 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
Four individuals with information rel
evant to the investigation of an alleged
sexual assault at a campus fraternity
party have told The Daily they spoke
with or saw the young girl who was
allegedly assaulted.
An investigation of the incident by
the Dean of Student Affairs Office and
the Stanford Police began after Univer
sity officials received a letter claiming
a girl had been sexually assaulted by
two men in a stall in the second-floor
bathroom of the Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity house at an Oct. 6 party.
Based on his initial reading of the
letter, Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes, who is investigating the claims
for Student Affairs, told The Daily on
Nov. 9 that "it sound[ed] like the
woman heard of the incident second-,
third-, or even fourth-hand."

The following day, Jill Salak, the au
thor of the letter, met with Hughes.
Salak, a sophomore at Monterey Penin
sula College, told him, and later The
Daily, that she had in fact talked directly
to the girl.
According to Salak, the alleged victim
was a 13-year-old girl who has since
turned 14. Salak said she knew the
girl's age because the two have mutual
acquaintances.
Salak said she spoke with the girl
soon after the alleged assault while the
girl was sitting on a couch in the front
hall of the Deke house.
"I walked up to the girl and asked
her if she was physically harmed. She
was really shaken up and bawling," said
Salak, a 20-year-old resident of Pacific
Grove. "She also seemed drunk on top
of being upset. She said she was OK,
and I asked her if she would come with
me and try to find the [assailants].
"She wasn't willing to get up, but

gave me a really general description of
the guys. She also said that she thought
they were Cal Poly (California Polytech
nic State University) students," Salak
said.
Salak said she tried to look for the
men the girl described but had no suc
cess.
Peter Rodolpho, guitarist for Circus
of Voodoo — the band at the party, said
he spoke to the alleged victim this past
weekend. "It happened. I know it hap
pened," he said.
Salak and the alleged victim, as well
as many others who are not affiliated
with the University, attended the party
to see the band, Salak said. According
to Rodolpho, the band has a following
of nearly 1,000 people.
Salak said she has seen the girl in
the past at parties in Palo Alto.
The girl arrived with another ac-
quaintance, a man named Eric,
Salak said. According to Salak,
Eric told her later that he over
heard two men discussing "a
sexual experience with a willing
female in the upstairs bathroom."
When Eric could not find his
friend, whom he knew was intox
icated, he went upstairs to the
bathroom, Salak said.
Salak attended the party with
a friend, Paz Waksman, who is a
22-year-old Mountain View resi
dent. Waksman said he was in the
bathroom and "heard a girl's voice
coming from the stall."
Waksman explained, "I thought
at first that it must have been a
guy just kidding around." He said
he also saw a man looking over
into the stall.
"At that point, Eric rushed in
and and called the girl to get out
of there. It seemed that he knew
she was in there," Waksman said.
According to Waksman, Eric
called the girl by name, saying,
"Come out right now." Waksman
said that he "heard fumbling and
saw [the girl] come out pulling
up her stockings" and readjusting
her clothes. She was followed out
of the stall by two men who looked
like college students, he said.
"My first reaction was to get
the hell out of there. I was pretty
distraught," said Waksman, who
added that he had been drinking.
"Had I been in a different state
of mind, maybe I would have acted

differently. Now I'm kind of
blaming myself' for not following
the men or notifying the police,
he said.
Waksman went downstairs, im
mediately found Salak and told
her they should leave, both Salak
and Waksman said.
After Salak pressured him to
explain why, he told her of the
assault, she said. She then pro
ceeded to find the victim on the
couch and talk to her, Salak said.
"There was a murmur that
went through the house that there
had been a sexual assault, and
the party started to break up,"
Salak said. She added that by
then, it was late, and the band
had stopped playing.
According to Rodolpho, "Word
just spread. People were talking
about it. There were easily over
10 people who knew about it,
maybe 20."
However, Deke President Mike
Nakashima said, "No one in the
house heard anything that night
as far as we can tell."
Salak said she found it hard to
believe that no one in the frater
nity had any knowledge of the
incident.
Rodolpho said that it is possible
that only those who had come to
see the band were talking about
the incident because they knew
each other and the girl who was

allegedly assaulted.
Salak said she believes that the
Dekes are partly, but not wholly,
responsible for the incident.
"[The Dekes] chose to have a
party and that makes them re
sponsible for their guests. They
were not monitoring alcohol in
take or checking any of the
bathrooms or rooms as far as I
can tell," Salak said.
"And they let her into the party.
She does not look over 15. How
she could be taken for a Stanford
student is beyond my grasp," she
added.
Nakashima said that members
of the house were checking for
Stanford IDs all night.
Paul Davidson, a 26-year-old
Mountain View resident, said that
although he was not allowed to
enter the party through the front
door because he did not have a
Stanford ID, he was able to get in.
"I just walked in the back door,
which was wide open," he said.
He said he remembered seeing
"a little girl walking around the
party" whom he later saw crying.
At one point she left the party
and those at the door would not
allow her to come back in, he said.
He said he remembers that two
college-age males convinced the
fraternity members at the door
to let the girl back into the party.
Davidson said he did not know if

the two men had any connection
with the alleged assault.
Salak said that after her meet
ing with Hughes, she believed
that he may be biased toward the
interests of the fraternity, rather
than those of the victim.
"He seemed sincere when I was
speaking with him, but kept ex
plaining the damage that the al
legations could do to the
fraternity. My concern is for the
victim. We seemed to be coming
from two different standpoints,"
she said.
Salak referred to a quote in a
Nov. 10 Daily article about the
investigation in which Hughes
said, "The credibility of the letter
has led me to believe that the
incident did not occur."
"If he said that, he is obviously
starting out with a biased opinion
that could affect his judgment,"
Salak said.
Yesterday, Hughes denied any
bias and said he is very concerned
about the incident. He said the
situation involves "many levels of
victims," including both the girl
involved and the fraternity.
He also noted the serious
ramifications for the campus as
a whole and the challenge to the
sense of security of anyone who
has been sexually assaulted when
allegations of a sexual assault are
made.

ward with the same
sense of responsi
bility I have in any
of my other com
mitments.'
— Michael Hughes

Hughes said he has been com
municating with the Stanford
Police, but has not yet met with
Sgt. Christopher Lefferts, who is
in charge of the police investiga
tion.
"I'm doing anything I can to
follow up on any leads. It's taking
a lot of my time," Hughes said.
"I'm moving forward with the
same sense of responsibility I have
in any of my other commitments,"
he added.
According to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington, the
police are "having some prob
lems" with the investigation.
"People don't seem to be real
anxious for us to know what hap
pened, but that's only specula
tion," he said. "If we could only
find the victim, we could sit down
and talk to her, and then we

wouldn't have to go through
anyone else," he added.
Rodolpho said that he has re
cently spoken to the victim, and
that she does not want to contact
the police.
"The little girl is scared out of
her skull. She won't tell anybody
anything," he said. Rodolpho said
he also spoke to Eric, who does
not want to talk to authorities
either.
According to Herrington, "It is
really disturbing that no one
would call us in a situation like
this. We don't know why no one
called us that night," he said.
Nakashima said the Dekes are
working with both the police and
Hughes in investigating the alle
gations.
"There is a real possibility that
something may have happened,
but we don't know what," Nakas
hima said.
Interfraternity Council Vice
President Eric Jorgenson said,
"It's alarming that an assault
could occur at any fraternity or
dorm party at Stanford. Cur
rently, no one completely prevents
non-Stanford students from enter
ing parties."
However, the IFC is "re
evaluating its party policies to bet
ter secure the safety of members
and guests at fraternity parties,"
IFC President Todd Ortega said.

soon after the alleged assault while the
girl was sitting on a couch in the front
hall of the Deke house.
"I walked up to the girl and asked
her if she was physically harmed. She
was really shaken up and bawling," said
Salak, a 20-year-old resident of Pacific
Grove. "She also seemed drunk on top
of being upset. She said she was OK,
and I asked her if she would come with
me and try to find the [assailants].
"She wasn't willing to get up, but

gave me a really general description of
the guys. She also said that she thought
they were Cal Poly (California Polytech
nic State University) students," Salak
said.
Salak said she tried to look for the
men the girl described but had no suc
cess.
Peter Rodolpho, guitarist for Circus
of Voodoo — the band at the party, said
he spoke to the alleged victim this past
weekend. "It happened. I know it hap
pened," he said.
Salak and the alleged victim, as well
as many others who are not affiliated
with the University, attended the party
to see the band, Salak said. According
to Rodolpho, the band has a following
of nearly 1,000 people.
Salak said she has seen the girl in
the past at parties in Palo Alto.
The girl arrived with another ac-
quaintance, a man named Eric,
Salak said. According to Salak,
Eric told her later that he over
heard two men discussing "a
sexual experience with a willing
female in the upstairs bathroom."
When Eric could not find his
friend, whom he knew was intox
icated, he went upstairs to the
bathroom, Salak said.
Salak attended the party with
a friend, Paz Waksman, who is a
22-year-old Mountain View resi
dent. Waksman said he was in the
bathroom and "heard a girl's voice
coming from the stall."
Waksman explained, "I thought
at first that it must have been a
guy just kidding around." He said
he also saw a man looking over
into the stall.
"At that point, Eric rushed in
and and called the girl to get out
of there. It seemed that he knew
she was in there," Waksman said.
According to Waksman, Eric
called the girl by name, saying,
"Come out right now." Waksman
said that he "heard fumbling and
saw [the girl] come out pulling
up her stockings" and readjusting
her clothes. She was followed out
of the stall by two men who looked
like college students, he said.
"My first reaction was to get
the hell out of there. I was pretty
distraught," said Waksman, who
added that he had been drinking.
"Had I been in a different state
of mind, maybe I would have acted

differently. Now I'm kind of
blaming myself' for not following
the men or notifying the police,
he said.
Waksman went downstairs, im
mediately found Salak and told
her they should leave, both Salak
and Waksman said.
After Salak pressured him to
explain why, he told her of the
assault, she said. She then pro
ceeded to find the victim on the
couch and talk to her, Salak said.
"There was a murmur that
went through the house that there
had been a sexual assault, and
the party started to break up,"
Salak said. She added that by
then, it was late, and the band
had stopped playing.
According to Rodolpho, "Word
just spread. People were talking
about it. There were easily over
10 people who knew about it,
maybe 20."
However, Deke President Mike
Nakashima said, "No one in the
house heard anything that night
as far as we can tell."
Salak said she found it hard to
believe that no one in the frater
nity had any knowledge of the
incident.
Rodolpho said that it is possible
that only those who had come to
see the band were talking about
the incident because they knew
each other and the girl who was

allegedly assaulted.
Salak said she believes that the
Dekes are partly, but not wholly,
responsible for the incident.
"[The Dekes] chose to have a
party and that makes them re
sponsible for their guests. They
were not monitoring alcohol in
take or checking any of the
bathrooms or rooms as far as I
can tell," Salak said.
"And they let her into the party.
She does not look over 15. How
she could be taken for a Stanford
student is beyond my grasp," she
added.
Nakashima said that members
of the house were checking for
Stanford IDs all night.
Paul Davidson, a 26-year-old
Mountain View resident, said that
although he was not allowed to
enter the party through the front
door because he did not have a
Stanford ID, he was able to get in.
"I just walked in the back door,
which was wide open," he said.
He said he remembered seeing
"a little girl walking around the
party" whom he later saw crying.
At one point she left the party
and those at the door would not
allow her to come back in, he said.
He said he remembers that two
college-age males convinced the
fraternity members at the door
to let the girl back into the party.
Davidson said he did not know if

the two men had any connection
with the alleged assault.
Salak said that after her meet
ing with Hughes, she believed
that he may be biased toward the
interests of the fraternity, rather
than those of the victim.
"He seemed sincere when I was
speaking with him, but kept ex
plaining the damage that the al
legations could do to the
fraternity. My concern is for the
victim. We seemed to be coming
from two different standpoints,"
she said.
Salak referred to a quote in a
Nov. 10 Daily article about the
investigation in which Hughes
said, "The credibility of the letter
has led me to believe that the
incident did not occur."
"If he said that, he is obviously
starting out with a biased opinion
that could affect his judgment,"
Salak said.
Yesterday, Hughes denied any
bias and said he is very concerned
about the incident. He said the
situation involves "many levels of
victims," including both the girl
involved and the fraternity.
He also noted the serious
ramifications for the campus as
a whole and the challenge to the
sense of security of anyone who
has been sexually assaulted when
allegations of a sexual assault are
made.

ward with the same
sense of responsi
bility I have in any
of my other com
mitments.'

Hughes said he has been com
municating with the Stanford
Police, but has not yet met with
Sgt. Christopher Lefferts, who is
in charge of the police investiga
tion.
"I'm doing anything I can to
follow up on any leads. It's taking
a lot of my time," Hughes said.
"I'm moving forward with the
same sense of responsibility I have
in any of my other commitments,"
he added.
According to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington, the
police are "having some prob
lems" with the investigation.
"People don't seem to be real
anxious for us to know what hap
pened, but that's only specula
tion," he said. "If we could only
find the victim, we could sit down
and talk to her, and then we

wouldn't have to go through
anyone else," he added.
Rodolpho said that he has re
cently spoken to the victim, and
that she does not want to contact
the police.
"The little girl is scared out of
her skull. She won't tell anybody
anything," he said. Rodolpho said
he also spoke to Eric, who does
not want to talk to authorities
either.
According to Herrington, "It is
really disturbing that no one
would call us in a situation like
this. We don't know why no one
called us that night," he said.
Nakashima said the Dekes are
working with both the police and
Hughes in investigating the alle
gations.
"There is a real possibility that
something may have happened,
but we don't know what," Nakas
hima said.
Interfraternity Council Vice
President Eric Jorgenson said,
"It's alarming that an assault
could occur at any fraternity or
dorm party at Stanford. Cur
rently, no one completely prevents
non-Stanford students from enter
ing parties."
However, the IFC is "re
evaluating its party policies to bet
ter secure the safety of members
and guests at fraternity parties,"
IFC President Todd Ortega said.
Four individuals with information rel
evant to the investigation of an alleged
sexual assault at a campus fraternity
party have told The Daily they spoke
with or saw the young girl who was
allegedly assaulted.
An investigation of the incident by
the Dean of Student Affairs Office and
the Stanford Police began after Univer
sity officials received a letter claiming
a girl had been sexually assaulted by
two men in a stall in the second-floor
bathroom of the Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity house at an Oct. 6 party.
Based on his initial reading of the
letter, Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes, who is investigating the claims
for Student Affairs, told The Daily on
Nov. 9 that "it sound[ed] like the
woman heard of the incident second-,
third-, or even fourth-hand."

The following day, Jill Salak, the au
thor of the letter, met with Hughes.
Salak, a sophomore at Monterey Penin
sula College, told him, and later The
Daily, that she had in fact talked directly
to the girl.
According to Salak, the alleged victim
was a 13-year-old girl who has since
turned 14. Salak said she knew the
girl's age because the two have mutual
acquaintances.
Salak said she spoke with the girl
soon after the alleged assault while the
girl was sitting on a couch in the front

The girl arrived with another ac-
quaintance, a man named Eric,
Salak said. According to Salak,
Eric told her later that he over
heard two men discussing "a
sexual experience with a willing
female in the upstairs bathroom."
When Eric could not find his
friend, whom he knew was intox
icated, he went upstairs to the
bathroom, Salak said.
Salak attended the party with
a friend, Paz Waksman, who is a
22-year-old Mountain View resi
dent. Waksman said he was in the
bathroom and "heard a girl's voice
coming from the stall."
Waksman explained, "I thought
at first that it must have been a
guy just kidding around." He said
he also saw a man looking over
into the stall.
"At that point, Eric rushed in
and and called the girl to get out
of there. It seemed that he knew
she was in there," Waksman said.
According to Waksman, Eric
called the girl by name, saying,
"Come out right now." Waksman
said that he "heard fumbling and
saw [the girl] come out pulling
up her stockings" and readjusting
her clothes. She was followed out
of the stall by two men who looked
like college students, he said.
"My first reaction was to get
the hell out of there. I was pretty
distraught," said Waksman, who
added that he had been drinking.
"Had I been in a different state
of mind, maybe I would have acted

differently. Now I'm kind of
blaming myself' for not following
the men or notifying the police,
he said.
Waksman went downstairs, im
mediately found Salak and told
her they should leave, both Salak
and Waksman said.
After Salak pressured him to
explain why, he told her of the
assault, she said. She then pro
ceeded to find the victim on the
couch and talk to her, Salak said.
"There was a murmur that
went through the house that there
had been a sexual assault, and
the party started to break up,"
Salak said. She added that by
then, it was late, and the band
had stopped playing.
According to Rodolpho, "Word
just spread. People were talking
about it. There were easily over
10 people who knew about it,
maybe 20."
However, Deke President Mike
Nakashima said, "No one in the
house heard anything that night
as far as we can tell."
Salak said she found it hard to
believe that no one in the frater
nity had any knowledge of the
incident.
Rodolpho said that it is possible
that only those who had come to
see the band were talking about
the incident because they knew
each other and the girl who was

allegedly assaulted.
Salak said she believes that the
Dekes are partly, but not wholly,
responsible for the incident.
"[The Dekes] chose to have a
party and that makes them re
sponsible for their guests. They
were not monitoring alcohol in
take or checking any of the
bathrooms or rooms as far as I
can tell," Salak said.
"And they let her into the party.
She does not look over 15. How
she could be taken for a Stanford
student is beyond my grasp," she
added.
Nakashima said that members
of the house were checking for
Stanford IDs all night.
Paul Davidson, a 26-year-old
Mountain View resident, said that
although he was not allowed to
enter the party through the front
door because he did not have a
Stanford ID, he was able to get in.
"I just walked in the back door,
which was wide open," he said.
He said he remembered seeing
"a little girl walking around the
party" whom he later saw crying.
At one point she left the party
and those at the door would not
allow her to come back in, he said.
He said he remembers that two
college-age males convinced the
fraternity members at the door
to let the girl back into the party.
Davidson said he did not know if

the two men had any connection
with the alleged assault.
Salak said that after her meet
ing with Hughes, she believed
that he may be biased toward the
interests of the fraternity, rather
than those of the victim.
"He seemed sincere when I was
speaking with him, but kept ex
plaining the damage that the al
legations could do to the
fraternity. My concern is for the
victim. We seemed to be coming
from two different standpoints,"
she said.
Salak referred to a quote in a
Nov. 10 Daily article about the
investigation in which Hughes
said, "The credibility of the letter
has led me to believe that the
incident did not occur."
"If he said that, he is obviously
starting out with a biased opinion
that could affect his judgment,"
Salak said.
Yesterday, Hughes denied any
bias and said he is very concerned
about the incident. He said the
situation involves "many levels of
victims," including both the girl
involved and the fraternity.
He also noted the serious
ramifications for the campus as
a whole and the challenge to the
sense of security of anyone who
has been sexually assaulted when
allegations of a sexual assault are
made.

ward with the same
sense of responsi
bility I have in any
of my other com
mitments.'

Hughes said he has been com
municating with the Stanford
Police, but has not yet met with
Sgt. Christopher Lefferts, who is
in charge of the police investiga
tion.
"I'm doing anything I can to
follow up on any leads. It's taking
a lot of my time," Hughes said.
"I'm moving forward with the
same sense of responsibility I have
in any of my other commitments,"
he added.
According to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington, the
police are "having some prob
lems" with the investigation.
"People don't seem to be real
anxious for us to know what hap
pened, but that's only specula
tion," he said. "If we could only
find the victim, we could sit down
and talk to her, and then we

wouldn't have to go through
anyone else," he added.
Rodolpho said that he has re
cently spoken to the victim, and
that she does not want to contact
the police.
"The little girl is scared out of
her skull. She won't tell anybody
anything," he said. Rodolpho said
he also spoke to Eric, who does
not want to talk to authorities
either.
According to Herrington, "It is
really disturbing that no one
would call us in a situation like
this. We don't know why no one
called us that night," he said.
Nakashima said the Dekes are
working with both the police and
Hughes in investigating the alle
gations.
"There is a real possibility that
something may have happened,
but we don't know what," Nakas
hima said.
Interfraternity Council Vice
President Eric Jorgenson said,
"It's alarming that an assault
could occur at any fraternity or
dorm party at Stanford. Cur
rently, no one completely prevents
non-Stanford students from enter
ing parties."
However, the IFC is "re
evaluating its party policies to bet
ter secure the safety of members
and guests at fraternity parties,"
IFC President Todd Ortega said.
Four individuals with information rel
evant to the investigation of an alleged
sexual assault at a campus fraternity
party have told The Daily they spoke
with or saw the young girl who was
allegedly assaulted.
An investigation of the incident by
the Dean of Student Affairs Office and
the Stanford Police began after Univer
sity officials received a letter claiming
a girl had been sexually assaulted by
two men in a stall in the second-floor
bathroom of the Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity house at an Oct. 6 party.
Based on his initial reading of the
letter, Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes, who is investigating the claims
for Student Affairs, told The Daily on
Nov. 9 that "it sound[ed] like the
woman heard of the incident second-,
third-, or even fourth-hand."

The following day, Jill Salak, the au
thor of the letter, met with Hughes.
Salak, a sophomore at Monterey Penin
sula College, told him, and later The
Daily, that she had in fact talked directly
to the girl.
According to Salak, the alleged victim
was a 13-year-old girl who has since
turned 14. Salak said she knew the
girl's age because the two have mutual
acquaintances.
Salak said she spoke with the girl
soon after the alleged assault while the
girl was sitting on a couch in the front
hall of the Deke house.
"I walked up to the girl and asked
her if she was physically harmed. She
was really shaken up and bawling," said
Salak, a 20-year-old resident of Pacific
Grove. "She also seemed drunk on top
of being upset. She said she was OK,
and I asked her if she would come with
me and try to find the [assailants].
"She wasn't willing to get up, but

gave me a really general description of
the guys. She also said that she thought
they were Cal Poly (California Polytech
nic State University) students," Salak
said.
Salak said she tried to look for the
men the girl described but had no suc
cess.
Peter Rodolpho, guitarist for Circus
of Voodoo — the band at the party, said
he spoke to the alleged victim this past
weekend. "It happened. I know it hap
pened," he said.
Salak and the alleged victim, as well
as many others who are not affiliated
with the University, attended the party
to see the band, Salak said. According
to Rodolpho, the band has a following
of nearly 1,000 people.
Salak said she has seen the girl in
the past at parties in Palo Alto.
The girl arrived with another ac-
quaintance, a man named Eric,
Salak said. According to Salak,
Eric told her later that he over
