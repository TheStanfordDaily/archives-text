# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
As Big Game week wound down, the
choices for Athletes of the Week were many.
The football, water polo, volleyball, men's
and women's fencing teams all beat Califor
nia last week.
After careful deliberation, and a bit of
argument, this week's winners are Laura
Olesen of the volleyball team and Tuan Van
Le of the football team.
Olesen, a 6-foot senior middle blocker from
La Jolla, Calif., led the Cardinal to two

victories in three outings and broke a school
record last week. Tuesday she had 15 kills,
two aces, 17 digs and four blocks to lead
Stanford past the Golden Bears.
Friday night she had 12 kills, one ace,
seven digs and six blocks as No. 6 Stanford
was upset by No. 13 Washington. Her fifth
block of that match moved her past Kim
Oden on the Stanford career block assist list.
Sunday Olesen had seven kills, two aces,
three digs and four blcoks in her final
regular-season home match, a win over
Washington State. She had a .636 hitting
percentage for that match and hit .379 for
the week. She has hit over .300 in five of
her last six matches and over .600 in two
of those matches.
Olesen currently has 419 block assists,
seven more than Oden recorded while being
named NCAA Player of the Year twice in
her career here.
Olesen has served as the team captain
the last two years, and Stanford has gone
45-12 over that period.

Le, a 6-0, 185-pound sophomore from
Lafayette, Calif., saved his best game for
last for the second year in a row. Le
E reserved a 19-19 tie in Big Game last year
y blocking a field goal on the last play of
the game.
This year, Le recorded 12 tackles against
California to lead the team.
Le also got credit for one pass break-up

and spent the entire day making Cal quar
terback Troy Taylor's life hell.
Le blitzed on almost every play and forced
Taylor to unload before he wanted to many
times.
This pressure was responsible for many
of Taylor's 28 incomplete passes, and Le's
pressure also caused Taylor to loft a ball
that Cardinal cornerback Albert Richardson
ran under for an interception.
