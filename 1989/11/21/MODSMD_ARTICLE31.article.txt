Cardinal fencers mowed down their
weaker counterparts from across the Bay
Friday in yet another version of Big Game.
The "Big Fence," if you will, saw Stan
ford routing California 23-4 on the men's
side and 14-2 on the women's. According
to Stanford women's Coach Sherry Pos
thumus, it wasn't even that close.
"Cal was not that strong this year," Pos
thumus said. "That was good, though, be
cause we were able to put in all of our
fencers. Every fencer got to fence."
Stanford men's Coach Zoran Tulum
added, "For a lot of guys on the team, this
was their first fencing meet. I was espe
cially proud of those guys."
The men's team dominated each of its
three divisions: saber, epee and foil. The
men's saber contingent went undefeated 9-
0, while the epee and foil units scored 8-1
and 6-3 victories, respectively. The women's
team only competes in the foil division.
Unlike Stanford, Cal does not maintain

'Cal was not that strong
this year. Every fencer got
to fence.'

an NCAA-level fencing team. Instead, Cal
fencers compete as a club. The Bears always
scare Tulum for this reason. "You never
know who they will show up with," Tulum
said. "Because they are a club, everyone
in the school can compete. They could show
up with a Ph.D student who was an inter
national fencing champion. Basically, they
could bring someone who could destroy
everyone on our team."
In other fencing news, sophomore Nick
Bravin finished fifth at the Junior Circuit
Under-20 Championships in Detroit. Ac
cording to Posthumus, Bravin should make
the national team which will travel to
Budapest, Hungary, later in the year.
Freshman Lana Kang finished 11th at
the same tournament. Both fencers missed
last weekend's match against Cal.
