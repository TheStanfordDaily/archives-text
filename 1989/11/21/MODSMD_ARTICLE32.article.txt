# VanDerveer signs two recruits
## 
### 
Tara VanDerveer, whose
recruiting magic has turned the
Stanford women's basketball
team from a cellar dweller to a
national power, has done it
again, announcing the signing
of high school standouts Kelly
Dougherty and Niki Sevillian to
letters-of-intent yesterday.
Dougherty, a 5-foot-ll
guard/forward from Leaven
worth, Kan., will be looked upon
to fill the shoes of Katy Steding
next year. "Kelly Dougherty is
an outstanding athlete who runs
the floor very well," VanDerveer
said.
"She plays nearly every posi
tion for her team. In fact, her
versatility is one of her
strengths, although I see her
more as a forward on our team.
She shoots well and rebounds
well. I consider her a real com
petitor who will emerge as a
team leader," VanDerveer
added.
Sevillian, a 5-10 guard, hails
from Flint, Mich. "Niki Sevillian
is a team player who I believe

will really develop in college,"
VanDerveer said. "She's a very
good shooter and a very hard
worker."
She'll have to work very hard,
indeed. Sevillian has the unenvi
able task of following in the foot
steps of Jennifer Azzi at the
shooting guard position.
"I feel that both Kelly and
Niki will eventually provide good
leadership and they'll definitely
fit well into our system," Van-
Derveer said.
Dougherty was selected by the
USA Today as one of their top
15 to watch this season. Street
& Smith's named her a
preseason Ail-American her
sophomore, junior and senior
years. Last season, at Leaven
worth High School, she scored
19.6 points per game while pull
ing down an average of 9.3
rebounds. Twice she has been
named Kansas Player of the
Year and has led her team to
state titles.
Sevillian's senior season just
ended with her team finishing

No. 2 in the state. Her season
averages were 12 points, four
rebounds, four steals and seven
assists.
"Academically [Sevillian] is
No. 1 in her class as well as
class president," VanDerveer
noted. She has maintained a 4.0
grade point average since
seventh grade.
Both Dougherty and Sevillian
came down to Stanford and
Vanderbilt before choosing to
come here. Interestingly, 6-7
Heidi Gillingham and 5-11 Julie
Powell also considered Stanford
— and signed with Vanderbilt.
Had Celeste Lavoie and
Tammy Svoboda announced
their decisions to quit the team
a month earlier, Stanford would
have had fewer returning
players in the 6-foot-plus range
and Gillingham might have
wound up here.
VanDerveer said she still may
sign one or two players during
the spring signing period in
April.
