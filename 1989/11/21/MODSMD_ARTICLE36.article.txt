## Sororities once banned from campus 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
While Stanford's seven sororities now
scramble for a place to hold their rush ac
tivities, from 1944 to 1977 they were banned
from campus altogether.
The ban resulted from an April 1944 de
cision by the Board of Trustees that soror
ities were divisive and disruptive to campus
life.
The story goes back to World War 11,
when many male students were off fighting.
To keep its entering class at a high enough
level, Stanford began admitting more wom
en.
As a result, fraternities took a back seat,
and their houses were turned over to the
University to serve as dormitories for the
influx of women. With the increase in
females admitted to Stanford, there was also
an increase in the number of women rushing
sororities, which were all housed at the time.
But participation in sororities became dif
ficult as the groups became more exclusive
due to the sheer number of applicants, said
Michael Hughes, the current fraternal affairs
adviser.
Tension between sorority women and

women in Roble Hall — then the women's
dormitory — increased during this period.
With approval from the Board of Trustees,
students and alumni formed a task force to
evaluate the situation in 1943, said Rosalind
Bacon, a campus resident who was director
of Roble Hall from 1941 to 1945.
Alumni groups, sorority members and
Roble Hall sponsors — upperclass women
who were the equivalent of today's resident
assistants — all formed committees to
review the situation, Bacon said.
The board reviewed these reports, and on
April 26, 1944, University President Donald
Tresidder announced that sororities would
be discontinued.
Legend has it that sororities were banned
because a woman jumped off Hoover Tower
after being denied admission, but Hughes
said no such event took place.
In December 1977, the Board of Trustees
reversed its stance, once again allowing
sorority rush and organizational activites
on campus, the Feb. 15, 1979, Daily re
ported. The activities and organizations
were still not officially recognized.
The following year, some graduate stu
dents challenged the University, claiming
that if fraternities existed, sororities should

also be present on campus in accordance
with Title IX of the Higher Education Act
of 1974.
The act requires that opportunities for
males and females be equal. If one sex has
the opportunity to join certain organiza
tions, the other sex must have similar op
portunities, according to the act.
As reported in the Feb. 15, 1979, Daily,
the sororities submitted a letter to the Office
of Residential Education calling for Univer
sity recognition of "all or none of the
groups."
"We were afraid that some groups would
receive recognition and some wouldn't. This
would be divisive to the Greek system as a
whole," said Tammy Ritchey, Intersorority
Council president at the time.
After some deliberation, sororities were
reinstated, although they would not be
housed organizations. Housed fraternities
were not forced to give up their homes to
make the fraternity system comparable to
the sorority system.
Instead, housed fraternities were
"grandfathered" into the University policy
because officials felt it would be unfair to
take houses away from organizations that
already had them, Hughes said.
