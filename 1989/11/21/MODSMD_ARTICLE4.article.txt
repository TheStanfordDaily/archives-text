# Grad student, Redwood City firm settle 'talking glove' suit
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
After almost a year of litigation, the
University and electrical engineering
graduate student Jim Kramer yesterday
settled out of court with a Redwood City
computer company over the patent rights
to a "talking glove."
"Under the terms of the agreement, 1
won the lawsuit," Kramer said in a writ
ten statement. "All charges were dropped,
and I can do anything 1 want."
Kramer's glove, designed to help the
deaf and deaf-blind communicate, trans

lates finger movements into words which
are then spoken through a portable
speaker.
Under the settlement, VPL Research
agreed to drop its charge that Kramer
violated a confidentiality agreement. As
a result, the University, which owns the
rights to the glove, is free to market the
product in 10 months.
In return, Kramer agreed not to file
a countersuit against VPL for malicious
prosecution.
VPL filed the suit last February, charg
ing that Kramer used the company's glove
technology to design his product. Kramer

was granted access to a VPL glove pur
chased by the Veterans Administration
in November 1986 after signing a non
disclosure agreement.
But Kramer said his talking glove is
completely different from the VPL prod
uct. "Theirs uses fiber optics and mine
uses strain gages," he said yesterday, ex
plaining that his product uses electrons
rather than photons.
All parties said they were glad a settle
ment had been reached.
"Neither VPL nor Stanford has money
to waste on litigation," said VPL's Chief
Executive Officer Jaron Lanier in a

prepared statement. "With this drain on
our time and resources ended, VPL can
focus all its energies on its business," he
added.
"Stanford is satisfied with the settle
ment because all issues of principle have
been adequately dealt with," said John
Schwartz, general counsel for the Uni
versity.
He added that the suit interfered with
both a student's work and Stanford's abil
ity to transfer beneficial technology to
the public.
Now, with the settlement, "We will be
able to go forward with academic research

expanding the potential uses of this im
portant computerized glove technology,"
Schwartz said. "It is especially important
to us that the agreement assures unfet
tered academic research and use of the
results of this research."
After spending three academic quarters
on the case, Kramer said he looks forward
to "getting some work done for a change.
This last week has been heaven."
Kramer said he looks back upon the
lawsuit as a very interesting learning ex
perience. "Maybe I'll write a book about
it some day,"he said.
