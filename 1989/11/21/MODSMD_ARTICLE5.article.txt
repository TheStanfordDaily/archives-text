Remembering the many killed in El Sal
vador's civil war as well as the six Jesuit
scholars murdered there last week, about
200 members of the Stanford community
held a march and vigil yesterday.
They walked in complete silence from
the Bechtel International Center to
Memorial Church, where they took up their
vigil.
Last week, six Jesuit priests, who were
professors at the University of Central
America and among the most respected
scholars in Latin America, were killed in
San Salvador in the wake of increasing
violence against civilians.
At yesterday's vigil, sponsored by
Campus Ministries and the Stanford Cen
tral American Action Network, Political
Science Asst. Prof. Terry Karl said the
priests "consistently sought . . . and dedi
cated their lives to finding out the reality
of the civil war."
Because of their actions, Karl said, "They
consistently found themselves confronting
the government." Karl, who worked closely
with the priests for eight years, continued
correspondence with them when she left
El Salvador.
Karl warned the group of students, fac
ulty, clergy and community members not

to believe media reports that the killings
were "the acts of some aberrant death
squad."
"There is an enormous amount of
evidence that links these activities directly
into the military high command of El Sal
vador," Karl said.
While the most recent manifestations of
the unrest in El Salvador resulted in these
murders, speakers at yesterday's march
also remembered all those killed in the
latest conflict between guerrillas and gov
ernment forces. In addition, the marchers
rallied against the recent bombings of the
offices of the leading opposition party and
the leading labor union, and they called
for the end of U.S. aid to El Salvador.
The group presented a strong message
as they marched silently, carrying banners
and placards with messages like, "Stop the
killing in El Salvador, stop U.S. aid to El
Salvador," and "$1.4 million, your tax dol
lars at work ... six priests killed."
The Rev. Herb Schmidt, the Lutheran
campus pastor, began the march at the
steps of Bechtel by saying, "We are here
to recommit ourselves to a life working for
peace and justice in our world."
Capturing the general tone of the march,
he added, "America is implicated by what
is happening in Central America and in El

Salvador." He articulated SCAAN's posi
tion, calling for an end to all aid to El
Salvador, in any form, military or eco
nomic.
Steve Privett, a professor of religious
studies at the University of Santa Clara,
called for an increased role of universities
in "saving the world and ourselves from
the death-dealing power of evil which,
frankly, today seems overwhelming."
The predominantly student audience ap
plauded enthusiastically when Privett said,
"I will not accept the argument that con
cern for the poor and defenseless is a dis
traction from the university [education!
It is, in fact the very soul of it."
Further emphasizing the role the Uni
versity, Robert McAffee Brown, a former
professor of religious studies, called on stu
dents to respond to U.S. policy in El Sal
vador. "Stanford students have an
opportunity and an obligation to lean very
heavily on our congressman, Tom Camp
bell, to see that he doesn't vote for aid [to
El Salvador] at all," he said.
Other speakers at the vigil included Car

men Broz, a Salvadoran who started a child
care center in El Salvador with her life
savings, Anthropology Prof. Bill Durham
and John Chung of Amnesty International.
Karl emphasized the "symbolism" of
murder in El Salvador. If a peasant in
favor of land reform were killed, dirt would
be stuffed in his mouth, to symbolize that
he was killed for his support of land reform,
she said.
In the case of the priests, she said, they
were killed "because of their brains." She
cited reports from The New York Times
which describe the priests as being "shot
in the heads" and "their brains having
been removed."
Privett called the six priests who died in
El Salvador "martyrs, whose deaths speak
with an eloquence that far outstrips the
mindless violence in that country."
The vigil ended with a Salvadoran ritual
practiced after someone has been killed.
Survivors come together and call out the
name of the deceased. After each name,
the entire crowd yells, "Presente!" The
word means that those people are still with
them and are ready to be involved.
The group called out the names of the
six priests, as well as their cook and her
daughter who were killed with the priests,
and remembered all of those who died.
