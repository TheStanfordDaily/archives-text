'Upset' causes rumbling
An "upset condition" at the Cardinal
Cogeneration plant caused the facility
to emit a loud rumbling when its safety
valve lifted on Saturday afternoon, ac
cording to Cogen officials.
"Everything is totally under control,"
said General Manager Jim Marzonie, al
though he did not know what caused
the upset condition. The noise was heard
at many places on campus a good dis
tance from the plant.
The safety valves rose to protect the
system from an increase in pressure,
Marzonie explained.
The cogenerator facility, located on
the corner of Via Ortega and Campus
Drive, supplies the Stanford campus
with electricity, steam for heating and
chilled water.
"Things like this don't happen very
often," Marzonie said.

Tri-Delts to hold auction
The Delta Delta Delta sorority will
hold its second annual benefit auction
today from noon to 1:15 in White Plaza.
Proceeds from the auction go toward

oncology research at the Children's
Hospital at Stanford. The Tri-Delts
raised $2,500 for the hospital last year
from items donated by businesses and
students.
Items to be auctioned off include a
performance of the band Marci and the
Moongods, weekend packages at the Gar
den Court and Claremont hotels, sym
phony tickets and a party at the Kappa
Alpha house.
Some of the unique services to be
auctioned include a double motorcycle
ride up Skyline Boulevard and one hour
of "designated activity" by the Stanford
Tree mascot.
Books head for S. Africa
About 10,000 bodes collected by Stanford
students will be launched on their jour
ney to students in South Africa on
Thursday, Thanksgiving Day.
The shipment, which includes
textbooks in all fields and at all academic
levels, will depart from Oakland on the
Dutch shipping line Ned-Lloyd.
The Stanford African Schools Project
has solicited the donations from the
Stanford community over the past two
years, according to Philip Lawes, the
group's founder.
