# Minority staff: UCMI update on target
## 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer 
After years of waiting, the results
came as no surprise.
Minority staff members said a report
released last week by the University
Committee on Minority Issues ac
curately reflects their dissatisfaction
with minority hiring and promotion at
Stanford.
"The results are not really surpris
ing," said Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Keith Archuleta, director of the Black
Community Services Center. "I've gone
on record in the last 15 years that I've
been with Stanford that there's been a
great need to address these concerns."
Juan Yniguez, an assistant dean of
student affairs who is Chicano, agreed.
"I think [the report] accurately reflects
what many staff feel," he said.
The report, released Wednesday by
the staff subcommittee of the UCMI,
revealed that "large proportions of mi
nority staff — from nearly one-third to
over three-quarters — [are] more dis
satisfied than satisfied with the overall
treatment of minorities at Stanford."
University President Donald Kennedy
is scheduled to respond to the report
at the Nov. 30 meeting of the Faculty
Senate.
Compared with their white co
workers, minority staff members sur
veyed in the report did not feel "that
the University does a good job promot
ing competent minority staff members."
Black staff members were especially
critical of the University's record of pro
moting minorities. A mtgority of black
staff members surveyed said white
workers and outsiders have a better
chance at promotion than minority staff
members.
Many of the opinions expressed by
minority staff members in the report
have been of long-standing concern to
the minority communities at Stanford.
"I think (the survey) confirms what the
general feeling has been at Stanford,"
said Betty Tyson, chair of the Asian
Staff Forum.
Archuleta said Stanford students at
tempted to bring these minority con
cerns to the attention of the University
over a decade ago. "A lot of the students
in the '70s spoke to the same issues
that the UCMI as a whole has now
documented," he said.
Yniguez, Archuleta and Tyson said
they believe the official recognition of
these concerns — represented by the
publication of the report — is only a

first step toward making Stanford an
equitable employer.
"Now [these concerns] are docu
mented, and now we're all hopefully
going to be at a place where we speak
the same language about these kinds
of issues," Archuleta said.
According to Yniguez, Stanford "is to
be commended" for its willingness to
examine the status of minority staff on
campus. Yniguez said inequitable em
ployment situations "are not exclusive
to Stanford. But we're in an institution
that is at least willing to raise questions
and try to find solutions."
Tyson said the report in itself presents
no solutions. "It's really a confirma
tional report," she said. ''The real test
will be if the University is ready to act
on its findings."
The report included eight recommen
dations to encourage a "multiracial,
multicultural" work environment.
Among its suggestions, the committee
recommended that the University edu
cate staff members about minority is
sues and concerns and establish
processes that "ensure open communi
cation across racial and ethnic lines."
The report also suggested supervisors
and managers should periodically eval
uate the extent to which current em
ployment and promotion practices
exclude minority staff. Departments
should then publish these findings,
breaking down data by "racial and eth
nic group and by gender."
Regular evaluations of both employ
ees and top-level managers could also
measure the University's success in pro
viding opportunities for minorities to
advance.
Much of the responsibility for imple
menting the general aims of these rec
ommendations would be shared by the
University's Affirmative Action Council
and the Human Resources Policy Staff,
according to the report.
Henry Organ, a black staff member
who serves on the Affirmative Action
Council, said the task of expanding the
recommendations placed too much of a
burden on the council."The council is
being presented with a full platter of
responsibilities," he said.
Organ, an associate director of the
Office of Development, said the council
is already swamped with duties. "We
only meet for two hours once a month,
and we are already requested to address
significant issues with limited re
sources." Organ said the University ad
ministration should be held accountable
for implementing the recommendations.

Acting Vice Provost Cecilia Burciaga,
a member of both the UCMI and the
Affirmative Action Council, said the
burden of change would be shared by
several departments. "The staff recom
mendations are really geared to the
whole University," Burciaga said.
"The president and the provost will
look to the partnership of the vice
provosts to address the issues of staff
development, recruitment, and reten
tion," she said. "The effort has to be
orchestrated throughout the Universi
ty."
While the recommendations attempt
to address minority concerns, some staff
members criticized the broadness of the
suggestions. "I wish the recommenda
tions were more specific and
measurable, with target dates and ac
countability attached to them," said
Tyson.
But Vice Provost Raymond Bacchetti,
who co-chaired the UCMI staff subcom
mittee, said the committee "did not have
the expertise" to make more specific
recommendations.
"A lot of the recommendations have
to do with trying to get people to take
results from the report and put them
into their own setting," Bacchetti said.
"We want the report to be seen and
used as a resource for increasing and
improving local understanding. We feel
it can be used for that purpose in just
about any setting that exists in the
institution."
Many minority staff members said
they are optimistic that the University
will quickly implement some of the rec
ommendations. "The University is be
ginning to realize that there needs to
be a quickened pace in the way people
are hired and promoted," said Yniguez.
However, Tyson said she had little
hope that the recommendations could
take effect soon. "Judging by history,
it could take a long time," she said.

great need to address these concerns."
Juan Yniguez, an assistant dean of
student affairs who is Chicano, agreed.
"I think [the report] accurately reflects
what many staff feel," he said.
The report, released Wednesday by
the staff subcommittee of the UCMI,
revealed that "large proportions of mi
nority staff — from nearly one-third to
over three-quarters — [are] more dis
satisfied than satisfied with the overall
treatment of minorities at Stanford."
University President Donald Kennedy
is scheduled to respond to the report
at the Nov. 30 meeting of the Faculty
Senate.
Compared with their white co
workers, minority staff members sur
veyed in the report did not feel "that
the University does a good job promot
ing competent minority staff members."
Black staff members were especially
critical of the University's record of pro
moting minorities. A mtgority of black
staff members surveyed said white
workers and outsiders have a better
chance at promotion than minority staff
members.
Many of the opinions expressed by
minority staff members in the report
have been of long-standing concern to
the minority communities at Stanford.
"I think (the survey) confirms what the
general feeling has been at Stanford,"
said Betty Tyson, chair of the Asian
Staff Forum.
Archuleta said Stanford students at
tempted to bring these minority con
cerns to the attention of the University
over a decade ago. "A lot of the students
in the '70s spoke to the same issues
that the UCMI as a whole has now
documented," he said.
Yniguez, Archuleta and Tyson said
they believe the official recognition of
these concerns — represented by the
publication of the report — is only a

first step toward making Stanford an
equitable employer.
"Now [these concerns] are docu
mented, and now we're all hopefully
going to be at a place where we speak
the same language about these kinds
of issues," Archuleta said.
According to Yniguez, Stanford "is to
be commended" for its willingness to
examine the status of minority staff on
campus. Yniguez said inequitable em
ployment situations "are not exclusive
to Stanford. But we're in an institution
that is at least willing to raise questions
and try to find solutions."
Tyson said the report in itself presents
no solutions. "It's really a confirma
tional report," she said. ''The real test
will be if the University is ready to act
on its findings."
The report included eight recommen
dations to encourage a "multiracial,
multicultural" work environment.
Among its suggestions, the committee
recommended that the University edu
cate staff members about minority is
sues and concerns and establish
processes that "ensure open communi
cation across racial and ethnic lines."
The report also suggested supervisors
and managers should periodically eval
uate the extent to which current em
ployment and promotion practices
exclude minority staff. Departments
should then publish these findings,
breaking down data by "racial and eth
nic group and by gender."
Regular evaluations of both employ
ees and top-level managers could also
measure the University's success in pro
viding opportunities for minorities to
advance.
Much of the responsibility for imple
menting the general aims of these rec
ommendations would be shared by the
University's Affirmative Action Council
and the Human Resources Policy Staff,
according to the report.
Henry Organ, a black staff member
who serves on the Affirmative Action
Council, said the task of expanding the
recommendations placed too much of a
burden on the council."The council is
being presented with a full platter of
responsibilities," he said.
Organ, an associate director of the
Office of Development, said the council
is already swamped with duties. "We
only meet for two hours once a month,
and we are already requested to address
significant issues with limited re
sources." Organ said the University ad
ministration should be held accountable
for implementing the recommendations.

Acting Vice Provost Cecilia Burciaga,
a member of both the UCMI and the
Affirmative Action Council, said the
burden of change would be shared by
several departments. "The staff recom
mendations are really geared to the
whole University," Burciaga said.
"The president and the provost will
look to the partnership of the vice
provosts to address the issues of staff
development, recruitment, and reten
tion," she said. "The effort has to be
orchestrated throughout the Universi
ty."
While the recommendations attempt
to address minority concerns, some staff
members criticized the broadness of the
suggestions. "I wish the recommenda
tions were more specific and
measurable, with target dates and ac
countability attached to them," said
Tyson.
But Vice Provost Raymond Bacchetti,
who co-chaired the UCMI staff subcom
mittee, said the committee "did not have
the expertise" to make more specific
recommendations.
"A lot of the recommendations have
to do with trying to get people to take
results from the report and put them
into their own setting," Bacchetti said.
"We want the report to be seen and
used as a resource for increasing and
improving local understanding. We feel
it can be used for that purpose in just
about any setting that exists in the
institution."
Many minority staff members said
they are optimistic that the University
will quickly implement some of the rec
ommendations. "The University is be
ginning to realize that there needs to
be a quickened pace in the way people
are hired and promoted," said Yniguez.
However, Tyson said she had little
hope that the recommendations could
take effect soon. "Judging by history,
it could take a long time," she said.
After years of waiting, the results
came as no surprise.
Minority staff members said a report
released last week by the University
Committee on Minority Issues ac
curately reflects their dissatisfaction
with minority hiring and promotion at
Stanford.
