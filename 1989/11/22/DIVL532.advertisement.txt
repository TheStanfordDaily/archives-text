This is a time to reflect on all we are thankful for.
Residential Affairs would like to express appreciation for the
Stanford Community response to the earthquake this past month. It
was truly a united effort, a tremendous slum' of dedication and
,j , .
support for our community.
We wish to thank the many departments, staff, faculty and
students who spent their time and energy addressing the needs here,
expressed their concern and caring in their actions, and made
sacrifices of their own for their neighbors in this time of crisis. We are
not over it yet, and the community continues to res[x/nd.
THANK YOU ALL!
