The ASSU Senate voted unanimously last night
to allocate $1,500 for programs that will help stu
dents displaced by the Oct. 17 earthquake sustain
their now-scattered communities.
Graduate senator Douglas Bone said the money
was necessary to fund "additional expenses [that]
will be incurred" by students wishing to schedule
programs with former dormmates.
Senator David Rimer characterized the additional
expenses as flier costs, phone expenses, organiza
tional costs and rental fees.
Bone said the bill stipulates that a representative
from each of the closed residences serve on a board
empowered to establish procedures guiding the dis
semination of the money.
In other business, the ASSU voted 15-2 for a bill
calling the senate to join with student unions nation
wide denouncing the barbarity of the assassination
of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador last week.
A heated debate over the bill, primarily between
senator Maria Saldana, the author, and senator En
rique Origgi, dragged the meeting on until the two
reached a compromise. Origgi, arguing that no one
is yet certain of who is responsible for the murders,
characterized Saldana's bill as "blatantly false."
In a senate recess, Origgi and Saldana discussed
their differences and hammered out a compromise
that toned down the politically-charged bill.
A separate bill called for the University Committee
on Minority Issues to apologize to the Native Amer
ican community and republish its staff subcommit
tee report including data from Native American
staff members.
Members of the Native American community were
angered that statistics on the opinions of staff mem
bers in that community were excluded from the
UCMI staff report â€” an exclusion committee mem
bers said was necessary because of the small number
of Native American represented.
The bill passed on a divided voice vote.
