# SUNet cabling to reach residences
## Network access for individual rooms awaits further wiring, fund raising 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
Stanford students will hear a
dial tone as soon as they plug in
their telephones next fall since
room phones will be linked to the
University phone system.
But it will be some time before
students will be able to link their
computers to the Stanford Uni
versity Network from their
rooms.
New phone lines are being in
stalled that will link students'
phone lines to the University in
stead of through Pacific Bell. This
will not only result in quicker
hook-up time but will also feature
individual long-distance billing of
each roommate, said Jan Thom
son, manager of the University
phone system.
Taking advantage of the instal
lation of these phone wires, some
SUNet cabling will be put in the
ground simultaneously. SUNet is
a system that links campus com
puters to each other as well as to
computers around the world.
These cables are the first step in
linking all residences to the net
work, said Bill Yundt, director of
networking and communication
systems and SUNet.

Although the cables should be
in place by next fall, "that doesn't
get the network into the build
ing," Yundt said. In addition to
the ground wires, residences must
be equipped with sufficient inter
nal wiring to receive SUNet, and
most Row houses and many dorms
have no such wiring.
"It's like we're laying the high
ways, but we haven't built the
driveways yet," Yundt said, refer
ring to the internal wiring neces
sary to implement the network.
"With the existing status, there's
no way to get to your house from
the highway."
The University currently main
tains 24 computer clusters with
access to SUNet, many of them
dorm-based. The installation of
new conduits with the phone lines
should make SUNet available to
the six Row computer clusters as
well, but Yundt was not sure when
this would be completed.
The University is currently
looking into the prospect of
making SUNet available to most
individual dorm rooms in re
sponse to a Residential Education
survey last spring finding that ap
proximately 50 percent of under
graduates have their own
computers.

the highways, but we
haven't built the

"That is a huge base of com
puters that the University can
take advantage of by providing in
room connections," said Jeff Mer
riman, director of residential
computing resources.
By channeling funds now used
for maintaining computer clusters
to the installation of in-room com
puter hook-ups, "we could change
from the quantity of computers
to the quality of service we pro
vide," Merriman said.
The overall cost of implement
ing such a service would be ap
proximately $3 million, according
to Yundt.
At the present time, direct room
hook-up is available only to resi
dents of the newly constructed
Rains Apartments and the rewired
Roble Hall, Yundt said.
With the use of an adaptor,
these students can plug their per

sonal computers into wall iacks
and get access to SUNet, enabling
them to use the University's
mainframes, student residential
networks and printers from their
dorm rooms.
Only a few other residences,
most notably those in Governor's
Corner, now have the necessary
internal wiring to receive SUNet
but do not yet have the service
because the rooms lack wall jacks.
Yundt estimated that they will be
connected next winter at the ear
liest.
The University has not yet
scheduled the rewiring of any
rooms without such internal
wiring. This project has been as
signed fund raising priority,
Yundt said, but there is no esti
mate on when the funds will be
complete enough to begin the
renovations. However, any new or
rebuilt residences will be wired to
receive SUNet.
"We don't want to raise your
hopes too high," Yundt said. "The
long-term result at a minimum
would enable the Row houses to
have computer clusters connected
to the main network. At best, all
new buildings and rebuilt build
ings will be able to receive the
full range of services."
