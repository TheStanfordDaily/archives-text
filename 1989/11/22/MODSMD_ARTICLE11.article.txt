# Hotel complex planned on Stanford land
## 
### Aaron Thode 
Westin Hotels and Resorts has
recently scaled back its plans for
a hotel complex on Stanford land
near Interstate 280.
Westin hopes now the Menlo
Park Planning and Zoning Com
mission will give them the go
ahead.
The modified proposal is the
latest attempt by the interna
tional hotel chain to advance a
project that started more than
two years ago, but homeowners
who objected to the plans in a
lawsuit still are not satisfied.

In July 1987, Stanford signed
a contract that allowed Westin to
lease 21 acres of University land
for the construction and manage
ment of a 380-room hotel complex.
According to Niel Davidson, di
rector of housing development for
the the University, the hotel
would complement existing Uni
versity projects such as the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
Originally projected to cost $55
million, the hotel was expected to
raise $990,000 a year for the city
of Menlo Park. However, Westin
shelved the project in July 1988
because of a lawsuit by Rich and

Mary Rollins of the Oak Avenue
Homeowners Association against
the city.
The homeowners charged that
the city's general plan contained
inadequate provisions for regulat
ing the flow of traffic through
residential areas. Although the
lawsuit fell through on a tech
nicality, the city has since revised
its general plan. Westin reac
tivated its bid to build the hotel
last May.
However, Rich Rollins said he
considers many changes to the
general plan cosmetic, and he said
that if the hearings do not con

front the inadequacies of the city's
traffic management, the home
owners may sue the city again.
Judith Brown, a Westin spokes
person, said she believes the re
duction of the hotel's size from
387 to 350 rooms has helped
mitigate concern about traffic
problems. She also pointed out
that a hotel would have less im
pact on rush-hour traffic than an
office complex.
Westin will give another presen
tation on what is now a $70 mil
lion project to the Menlo Park
Planning Commission next Mon
day.
