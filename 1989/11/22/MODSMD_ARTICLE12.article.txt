## 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
Stanford Hospital will face several fi
nancial challenges oVef the next 1 few
years.
The problems of declining patient ad
mittance and lower rates of reimburse
ment for services are expected to come
to a head.
To rectify the situation, the hospital
will "increase efficiency, while improving
[its] services to patients, by making de
cisions based on a careful analysis of [its]
situation from multiple perspectives,"

wrote acting chief operating officer
Malinda Mitchell in a letter to all hospital
employees earlier this month.
Director of Finance David Sakai said
the hospital will compare its productivity
with other local university hospitals in
California to determine where improve
ments can be made. "We will make sure
we are as productive," he said.
For the past several years, the hospital
has made important adjustments in its
budgets in response to current economic
trends, Sakai said. "However, in spite of
cost efficiency and the growth of new

programs, we have not been able to shel
ter ourselves from industry-wide prob
lems," the letter stated.
For the 1990-91 budget process, the
hospital will approach the issue of cost
management in a different way, looking
to its physicians, managers, supervisors
and employees to find more efficient and
productive ways to perform daily activi
ties, according to the letter.
Sakai added that the hospital board
does not wish to increase patient charges
to solve the budget problems. The hospi
tal will try to raise revenue by providing

better services to attract patients, he said.
Sakai said, however, that hospital rev
enue will only come from patients. The
hospital receives no support from the
University, and student tuition will hot
be used to lessen its financial problems.
In other developments, the hospital is
working with the School of Medicine to
recruit chairs for several clinical
departments, Mitchell said. With appoint
ments to these key leadership roles, the
hospital will "continue to see revitaliza
tion in the Medical Center's clinical pro
gram," which will in turn provide
"important support for growth in the

hospital's patient base and program of
ferings," she added.
According to Sakai, the hospital 1 ftfhbw
awaiting the arrival of chafrs fbr the slir
gery and the obstetrics-gynecology de
partments, which will be considerably
strengthened.
The new president and chief executive
officer of the hospital, Kenneth Bloem,
took office Monday. He has already begun
working with the difficult issues that the
hospital faces, according to the letter. The
hospital was "looking forward to his ar
rival with enthusiasm," Mitchell said.
