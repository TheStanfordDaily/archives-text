## Salvadoran rebels renew fighting, corner foreigners in hotel 
### 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
(AP) — Armed guerrillas raided
a luxury hotel before dawn yes
terday, trapping dozens of foreign
ers, including eight U.S. Green
Berets.
Both NBC and CBS television
reported last night that all the
Americans, including military
personnel, were freed unharmed.
The reports were attributed to the
U.S. Embassy but the reports
were refuted late yesterday by the
Red Cross and sources from the
scene.
Red Cross spokeswoman Marie
Aude Lude said 17 people had
been evacuated safely in the early
evening but that it appeared no
U.S. military personnel or guer
rillas were among those
evacuated.
"All the people are over 30, and
none of them looks like an Amer
ican soldier," she said.
Knowledgeable diplomatic
sources, who insisted on
anonymity for security reasons,
said the American soldiers bar
ricaded inside the hotel will spend
the night there. The eight are de
scribed as heavily armed Green
Berets from Fort Bragg, N.C.
Instead, it appeared a standoff
was continuing — and would con
tinue through the night — inside
the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel's
VIP Tower more than 17 hours
after rebels surprised the govern
ment with their assault in an
upper-class neighborhood of this
capital.
Ms. Lude said none of the
evacuees — who were French
speakers, Spanish-speakers and
English-speakers — appeared to
be guerrillas.
Earlier yesterday the guerrillas
claimed they had captured four
U.S. military advisors. But the
AP reached the occupied sector of

the tower and was told the heavily
armed Americans were barricaded
in one or two rooms and controlled
the fourth floor hallway, only
about 20 yards from where the
guerrilla were on the third and
fifth floors.
One of the barricaded Ameri
cans told reporters that he had
been talking with the rebels at
one point early in the standoff.
The Americans said they had fired
no shots and would not fire unless
fired upon.
"We're here because we don't
feel we can leave safely," said one
of the soldiers, who declined to
provide his name.
One source said it was unclear
whether the guerrillas had slipped
out of the hotel, or were still in
side. The rebels may have left be
hind mines or booby-traps, he
said.
"Before daylight it would be dif
ficult to be sure they'd be safe
and secure coming out," said the
source.
Col. Carlos Aviles of the Salva
doran army also said the Ameri
can soldiers remained inside the
hotel. He said it was unclear
whether any rebels remained on
the hotel grounds.
The hotel manager told the AP
by telephone that there was still
sporadic firing around the build
ing.
State Department sources said
last night that many of the guests
trapped in the Sheraton Hotel,
including several Americans, had
been allowed to leave the building
in the custody of the Red Cross.
The sources, who declined to be
identified, did not say whether
American military personnel were
among those who were freed.
Soldiers from an armored per
sonnel carrier earlier rescued the
secretary-general of the Organi

zation of American States, who
had been in a different part of the
Sheraton Hotel when the guerril
las mounted the bold attack.
At 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. EST),
a half-hour before the 6 p.m. cur
few, Monsignor Gregorio Rosa
Chavez, the Roman Catholic aux

iliary bishop of San Salvador, ar
rived at the hotel.
He was accompanied by Fran
cois Musy, head of the Interna
tional Red Cross office in El Sal
vador, and Monsignor Emil Stehe,
the archbishop of Ecuador who
arrived in El Salvador last week.

One of the barricaded Americans told
reporters that they had been talking with the
rebels at one point early in the standoff. The
Americans said that they had fired no shots
and would not fire unless fired upon.

Rosa Chavez asked the army
officer in charge of the troops
around the hotel to withdraw the
soldiers from the hotel grounds,
and he complied. The troops
pulled back about a half-block.
Rosa Chavez, Stehe and Musy
then entered the building.
Rose Chavez had been asked
who would be evacuated, and he
said, "Everybody comes out."
Journalists had to leave the
area shortly before curfew.
Earlier yesterday, the army
moved tanks and hundreds of sol
diers into the western neighbor
hood of Escalon to fight the at
tackers, who were renewing an
urban offensive that had appeared
to be dying out. At least 1,000
people have been killed since the
offensive, the largest of the
decade-old civil war, began the
night of Nov. 11.
The Bush administration said
the United States was "making
plans as necessary" to protect the
lives of Americans. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
no options — including military
ones — were ruled out.
State Department spokes
woman Margaret Tutwiler said
the Salvadoran armed forces
rescued 20 hotel guests, including
several Americans, from a part of
the hotel not penetrated by guer
rillas.
Israel radio reported without
elaboration late yesterday that six

Israelis also were holed up inside
the hotel but there was no inde
pendent confirmation immedi
ately available.
The attack comes one day after
President Bush reaffirmed strong
U.S. support for President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government.
The United States has provided
about $3.5 billion to oppose the
insurgency, in which more than
71,000 people, mostly civilians,
have died. Fifty-five U.S. military
advisers are assigned to El Sal
vador.
An Associated Press reporter
saw at least six armed men,
believed to include U.S. advisers,
barricaded on the fourth floor of
the "VIP Tower" of the hotel,
which is no longer part of the
U.S.-based hotel chain.
A U.S. source said the military
men trapped in the raid were not
part of the adviser group but were
on a two-week training mission
and had been scheduled to leave
Yesterday.
Salvadoran troops were
deployed at the hotel's main build
ing, 100 yards from the five-story
VIP Tower.
Speaking to reporters who made
their way into the tower, one
trapped American said he and his
companions were not hostages but
could not leave.
"We would like to leave," he
said. "We're here because we feel
we can't leave safely."

Journalists had to leave the
area shortly before curfew.
Earlier yesterday, the army
moved tanks and hundreds of sol
diers into the western neighbor
hood of Escalon to fight the at
tackers, who were renewing an
urban offensive that had appeared
to be dying out. At least 1,000
people have been killed since the
offensive, the largest of the
decade-old civil war, began the
night of Nov. 11.
The Bush administration said
the United States was "making
plans as necessary" to protect the
lives of Americans. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
no options — including military
ones — were ruled out.
State Department spokes
woman Margaret Tutwiler said
the Salvadoran armed forces
rescued 20 hotel guests, including
several Americans, from a part of
the hotel not penetrated by guer
rillas.
Israel radio reported without
elaboration late yesterday that six

Israelis also were holed up inside
the hotel but there was no inde
pendent confirmation immedi
ately available.
The attack comes one day after
President Bush reaffirmed strong
U.S. support for President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government.
The United States has provided
about $3.5 billion to oppose the
insurgency, in which more than
71,000 people, mostly civilians,
have died. Fifty-five U.S. military
advisers are assigned to El Sal
vador.
An Associated Press reporter
saw at least six armed men,
believed to include U.S. advisers,
barricaded on the fourth floor of
the "VIP Tower" of the hotel,
which is no longer part of the
U.S.-based hotel chain.
A U.S. source said the military
men trapped in the raid were not
part of the adviser group but were
on a two-week training mission
and had been scheduled to leave
Yesterday.
Salvadoran troops were
deployed at the hotel's main build
ing, 100 yards from the five-story
VIP Tower.
Speaking to reporters who made
their way into the tower, one
trapped American said he and his
companions were not hostages but
could not leave.
"We would like to leave," he
said. "We're here because we feel
we can't leave safely."

Hotel yesterday, where FMLN guerrillas are holding some 25
hostages. The rebels renewed fighting by attacking the wealthy
neighborhood of Escalon.
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
(AP) — Armed guerrillas raided
a luxury hotel before dawn yes
terday, trapping dozens of foreign
ers, including eight U.S. Green
Berets.
Both NBC and CBS television
reported last night that all the
Americans, including military
personnel, were freed unharmed.
The reports were attributed to the
U.S. Embassy but the reports
were refuted late yesterday by the
Red Cross and sources from the
scene.
Red Cross spokeswoman Marie
Aude Lude said 17 people had
been evacuated safely in the early
evening but that it appeared no
U.S. military personnel or guer
rillas were among those
evacuated.
"All the people are over 30, and
none of them looks like an Amer
ican soldier," she said.
Knowledgeable diplomatic
sources, who insisted on
anonymity for security reasons,
said the American soldiers bar
ricaded inside the hotel will spend
the night there. The eight are de
scribed as heavily armed Green
Berets from Fort Bragg, N.C.
Instead, it appeared a standoff
was continuing — and would con
tinue through the night — inside
the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel's
VIP Tower more than 17 hours
after rebels surprised the govern
ment with their assault in an
upper-class neighborhood of this
capital.
Ms. Lude said none of the
evacuees — who were French
speakers, Spanish-speakers and
English-speakers — appeared to
be guerrillas.
Earlier yesterday the guerrillas
claimed they had captured four
U.S. military advisors. But the
AP reached the occupied sector of

the tower and was told the heavily
armed Americans were barricaded
in one or two rooms and controlled
the fourth floor hallway, only
about 20 yards from where the
guerrilla were on the third and
fifth floors.
One of the barricaded Ameri
cans told reporters that he had
been talking with the rebels at
one point early in the standoff.
The Americans said they had fired
no shots and would not fire unless
fired upon.
"We're here because we don't
feel we can leave safely," said one
of the soldiers, who declined to
provide his name.
One source said it was unclear
whether the guerrillas had slipped
out of the hotel, or were still in
side. The rebels may have left be
hind mines or booby-traps, he
said.
"Before daylight it would be dif
ficult to be sure they'd be safe
and secure coming out," said the
source.
Col. Carlos Aviles of the Salva
doran army also said the Ameri
can soldiers remained inside the
hotel. He said it was unclear
whether any rebels remained on
the hotel grounds.
The hotel manager told the AP
by telephone that there was still
sporadic firing around the build
ing.
State Department sources said
last night that many of the guests
trapped in the Sheraton Hotel,
including several Americans, had
been allowed to leave the building
in the custody of the Red Cross.
The sources, who declined to be
identified, did not say whether
American military personnel were
among those who were freed.
Soldiers from an armored per
sonnel carrier earlier rescued the
secretary-general of the Organi

zation of American States, who
had been in a different part of the
Sheraton Hotel when the guerril
las mounted the bold attack.
At 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. EST),
a half-hour before the 6 p.m. cur
few, Monsignor Gregorio Rosa
Chavez, the Roman Catholic aux

iliary bishop of San Salvador, ar
rived at the hotel.
He was accompanied by Fran
cois Musy, head of the Interna
tional Red Cross office in El Sal
vador, and Monsignor Emil Stehe,
the archbishop of Ecuador who
arrived in El Salvador last week.

One of the barricaded Americans told
reporters that they had been talking with the
rebels at one point early in the standoff. The
Americans said that they had fired no shots
and would not fire unless fired upon.

Rosa Chavez asked the army
officer in charge of the troops
around the hotel to withdraw the
soldiers from the hotel grounds,
and he complied. The troops
pulled back about a half-block.
Rosa Chavez, Stehe and Musy
then entered the building.
Rose Chavez had been asked
who would be evacuated, and he
said, "Everybody comes out."
