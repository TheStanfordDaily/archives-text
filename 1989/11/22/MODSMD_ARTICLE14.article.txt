# President endorses bills during pre-vacation congressional rush

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush signed a $286 billion military
spending bill yesterday that contained the
first budget reductions in the Star Wars
missile defense plan and a cutback in the
B-2 stealth bomber program.
Working from a stack of legislation ap
proved by Congress as it rushed to leave
town for the year, Bush also signed:
—A measure to guarantee reparations
to Japanese-Americans interned in U.S.
camps during World War 11. The provi
sion, part of a $17.2 billion appropriation
for the State, Justice and Commerce de
partments, contains no money for the
estimated 60,000 camp survivors but says
that up to $500 million would be provided

as an "entitlement" in 1991.
Congress has authorized $20,000 for
each survivor, a total of $1.2 billion.
—A ban on smoking on virtually all
domestic airline flights, an expansion of
current rules forbidding passengers from
lighting up on routes lasting two hours
or less. The new regulations take effect
96 days after signing, which would be
Feb. 25.
—A $44 billion spending bill for agricul
ture, rural development and other pro
grams, including soup kitchens for the
homeless and funds for the Food and
Drug Administration's fight against
AIDS.
The defense bill provides $3.8 billion

for the Star Wars program, also known
as the Strategic Defense Initiative. That's
$1.1 billion less than Bush requested for
fiscal 1990, the first budget reduction in
the program in its six-year history.
Bush said he was disappointed by the
cut and expressed hope that Congress
would support the administration's fu
ture requests.
The measure provides $4.3 billion for
two B-2 stealth bombers, $430 million
and one plane less than the administra
tion sought in the fiscal year that began
Oct. 1.
The money also will be used for some
advance procurement costs for five planes
to be bought in fiscal 1991 and for spare

parts.
Approximately $1.1 billion is included
for the 10-warhead, rail-based MX and
the single-warhead, truck-based Midget
man nuclear missiles.
The amount is about $150 million less
than the administration requested for the
two weapons and includes House lan
guage imposing a 50-missile cap on the
MX.
Among other provisions is a cut of
$400 million from the administration's
$1.8 billion request for procurement of
the Trident 2 missile and $11 million
from Bush's proposal of $216 million for
testing the problem-plagued missile.
The Trident 2 had its second successive

failure in undersea test firings in August.
Bush praised Congress for removing
from the agriculture and rural develop
ment measure a provision that would
have required the Rural Electrification
Administration to make $252 million in
"highly subsidized direct loans" in addi
tion to $1.8 billion in other REA loans
that the bill provides.
The change will save taxpayers $78
million in extra interest costs, Bush said.
He also praised the bill for providing
most of the funding requested for the
Department of Agriculture's portion of
an initiative to reduce groundwater and
surface water pollution from farm
sources.
