WASHINGTON (AP) - A senior
member of the House Armed Services
Committee said yesterday that Panama
nian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has
executed "probably more than 100" of
ficers and troops since a failed Oct. 3
coup.
"As a result, there cannot be a chival
rous coup d'etat in the future. The next
batch of coup plotters won't be inter
ested in handing Noriega over to us or
dispatching him into exile," said Rep.
Ike Skelton, D-Mo.
"Noriega has changed the ground
rules, so the next coup will be bloody."
The purge, Skelton said, amounts to
3 percent of the men in the Panamanian
Defense Force.
Skelton's comments came a day after
his Defense Policy Panel received a
closed-door, top-secret briefing from
Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of the U .S.
Southern Command, which is based in
Panama.
Intelligence sources have said that, in
the wake of the failed coup, the Central
Intelligence Agency has received congres
sional clearance for a new covert plan
that would spend up to $3 million to
depose Noriega. The plan would permit
aiding coup plotters, even if violence
were likely, as long as the plot did not
include plans for assassination.
A longstanding executive order bars
U.S. operatives from participating in any
plot to assassinate a foreign leader.
Skelton said he was satisfied that the
likelihood Noriega could die in a later
coup does not necessarily represent an
impediment to U.S. involvement.
"A death involved in a coup is different
from an out-and-out assassination at
tempt," he said.
Interim gov't in Greece
ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Leaders of
Greece's three main parties reached
agreement yesterday for an all-party, in
terim government to end the stalemate
that followed inconclusive elections on
Nov. 5.
"The three parties agreed to support
a government whose life term will last
until mid-April," conservative leader

Constantine Mitsotakis told a news con
ference.
The decision to hold general elections
in April follows four rounds of talks
between conservative, socialist and com
munist leaders with President Christos
Sartzetakis.
Mitsotakis said the interim adminis
tration will be headed by Xenophon
Zolotas, an economist and former gover
nor of the Bank of Greece. Zolotas is
not a member of Parliament.
The government will include members
of all parties and also non-political per
sonalities, Mitsotakis said, but compo
sition of the Cabinet has not been
decided.
He said the administration's first
tasks will be to deal with economic prob
lems and negotiations with the United
States on whether to renew an agree
ment for U.S. bases in Greece.
In Washington, the State Department
said the United States looks forward to
working with the new government and
will raise the question of the status of
the U.S. bases once a Cabinet is formed.
Czech protests continue
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) — Un
der pressure by thousands of demon
strators for a fifth day, Czechoslovakia's
premier told opposition leaders yester
day he favored a role for non-
Communists in the government.
Dissidents, including banned
playwright Vaclav Havel, addressed a
crowd of 150,000 people jamming Wen
ceslas Square without police inter
ference. An actor later called for the
resignations of Communist Party
leaders, and demonstrators chanted:
"Punish! Punish! Punish!"
The comments by Premier Ladislav
Adamec, relayed by participants in the
meeting, were a sharp break with cur
rent government policy. It was not clear
what significance his statements would
have because the head of government
traditionally has far less power than the
Communist Party leader.
Party chief Milos Jakes, in a television
appearance last night, accused the dem
onstrators of trying to "disrupt the
socialist system" and "unleash emotion
and passions with unforeseeable conse
quences."

resignations of Communist Party
leaders, and demonstrators chanted:
"Punish! Punish! Punish!"
The comments by Premier Ladislav
Adamec, relayed by participants in the
meeting, were a sharp break with cur
rent government policy. It was not clear
what significance his statements would
have because the head of government
traditionally has far less power than the
Communist Party leader.
Party chief Milos Jakes, in a television
appearance last night, accused the dem
onstrators of trying to "disrupt the
socialist system" and "unleash emotion
and passions with unforeseeable conse
quences."
