BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -
Delegates to a Communist Party con
gress yesterday extolled hard-line leader
Nicolae Ceausescu and offered lavish
praise for his rejection of democratic
reform.
Politburo member and labor leader
Miu Dobrescu said Ceausescu's nearly
six-hour speech to delegates Monday
was "an exemplary model of creative
tackling of present-day realities, a
genuine thesaurus of social and political
thinking."
Ceausescu, the East bloc's fiercest
hard-line leader, opened the party con
gress with a firm rejection of reforms
sweeping the region. Instead, he
declared his intention to increase gov
ernment and party control of daily af
fairs.
"The ruling out of the capitalist sys
tem ... is the leading requirement of a
just society," Ceausescu asserted to or
chestrated displays of adulation from

more than 3,000 delegates at downtown
Palace Hall in Bucharest.
He also called for the cancellation of
the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939, under
which Germany and the Soviet Union
later annexed parts of Eastern Europe.
The Romanian province of Bessarabia
was annexed by Moscow a year later
under the pact's secret protocol. It was
the first time Ceausescu had mentioned
the accord.
"A clear, unequivocal stand of con
demnation and cancellation must be
taken against all the accords concluded
with Hitler's Germany, practical conclu
sions being drawn to eliminate all the
consequences of those accords and dic
tates," he said in his speech.
Romanian Communist leaders never
reclaimed the province, now called So
viet Moldavia. However, the party daily,
Scinteia, for the first time published a
story Nov. 14 describing recent popular

unrest in Kishinev, the republic's cap
ital.
The delegates' support underscored
Ceausescu's tight control of the congress
and the personality cult that has grown
up around him during his 24 years in
power.
His comments were interrupted for
up to 50 seconds by shouts of "Romania,
Communism! Ceausescu, Heroism!" and
other slogans shouted in unison to the
accompaniment of rhythmic clapping.
The five-day congress is expected to
approve Ceausescu's economic plan for
the next five years.
The plan continues strong state con
trol of the economy. Ceausescu has in
vested billions of dollars in a crash in
dustrialization program that led to
widespread food and energy shortages
for Romania's 23 million people.
Although a nominal ally, Hungary for
the first time sent no party delegation
to the congress.
