# Sandinista-Contra talks break down
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Peace talks
between the Nicaraguan government
and the Contra rebels were suspended
last night after the two sides were un
able to agree on terms for a cease-fire.
Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister
Victor Hugo Tinoco told reporters his
government plans to call for an emer
gency meeting of Central American
presidents to decide on the next steps.
The chief Contra negotiator, Col. En
rique Bermudez, expressed regret over
the breakdown, and he blamed the San
dinista negotiators.
He said the rebel side had made
flexible proposals and was willing to
continue the talks.
The talks collapsed when the Contras
refused a Sandinista demand that they
agree to a partial withdrawal of their
forces to base camps in Honduras, said
Paul Reichler, an American member of
the Sandinista negotiating team.
The Contras refused to go beyond a
promise not to infiltrate any more forces
from the units based in Honduras.
Tinoco said the Contra refusal to
withdraw troops to Honduras "shows
they are not interested in peace." He
also criticized the State Department for
doing "absolutely nothing" to facilitate
an agreement.

Mediators from the Organization of
American States and the United Na
tions issued a statement saying they
will remain in contact with both sides
for the purpose of reconvening the dis
cussions "at the earliest date."
Hours earlier, the Sandinistas un
veiled a comprehensive cease-fire pro
posal that omitted a previous demand
for the withdrawal of all Contra forces
from Nicaragua and called instead for
a pullback of 2,300 insurgents.
The new proposal, outlined by Tinoco
at a news conference, would establish
corridors through which the retreating
Contras would return safely to base
camps in Honduras.
The process would be verified by 620
United Nations peacekeepers who are
scheduled to take up duties in Central
America shortly. Under the proposal,
both sides would agree to cease all mil
itary operations inside Nicaragua until
Dec. 31.
"If the Contras do not accept the
proposal, they have no interest in a
cease-fire," Tinoco told reporters at the
Nicaraguan Embassy.
The U.N. peacekeepers will be com
prised of West Germans, Spaniards and
Canadians. In addition to monitoring
the cease-fire, they also are entrusted

with ensuring that the territory of one
Central American county is not used to
launch subversive activities in another.

The negotiations began on Nov. 9 and
were aimed at restoring the cease-fire
that President Daniel Ortega suspended
eight days earlier after alleging that the
rebels had engaged in widespread ter
rorist activities.
As of Monday, the negotiators had
met eight times, with mediators from
the Organization of American States
and the United Nations prodding the
two sides toward agreement.
The Contras have called for a cease
fire in place as an initial step aimed at
an overall accommodation between the
two sides, culminating in the peaceful
rebel reintegration in Nicaraguan soci
ety. National elections are set for Feb.
25.
Tinoco said the 2,300 Contras being
asked to leave under the Sandinista pro
posal represent the number of rebels
who have infiltrated into Nicaragua
from the Honduran base camps in
recent weeks.
The Contras maintain that there has
been no increase, only a rotation of
forces. But the State Department has
said there has been a infiltration
of Contras since early October
