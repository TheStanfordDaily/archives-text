## Bylaws, by golly

ANSWER: The ASSU Bylaws,
the Student Organization
Sourcebook and Robert's
Rules of Order.
Question: What are three things
ASSU senators probably haven't
read?
Not surprisingly, another misun
derstanding erupted Nov. 9 in the
ASSU Senate.
Four senators, three of whom
are Students First party members,
attempted to deny Program Board
funds to two student groups based
on their "partisan political activi
ties."
The attempt to deny the funds
stemmed from a memorandum by
the senate Administration and
Rules Committee in 1987 stating
that the Program Board should
"follow University regulations and
not fund any strictly partisan po
litical activities."
Pointing out that the two groups
in question, the Democratic
Socialists and the Stanford Central

American Action Network, were
both left-leaning organizations, ac
cusations were made by other
senators that political motives dic
tated the four senators' actions.
Beneath the political infighting,
however, an important question
emerges: Who really knows the
rules and what they mean?
Last week Student Organization
Services Director Michael Ramsey-
Perez explained that, while these
groups may support partisan po
litical activities, the ASSU can
fund the groups as long as the
ASSU funds are not specifically
used to further these partisan ac
tivities.
Instead of having a chaotic base
for decision-making, the ASSU
senate should try to maintain some
sense of definitive, legislative his
tory. Though senators change
every year, efforts should be made
to establish some continuity if the
senate ever wants to really be taken
seriously.
