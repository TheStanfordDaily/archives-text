# Not money-grubbers

IMAGINE A STANFORD pro
fessional school student.
Chances are, lots of regret
table stereotypes pop into mind:
driver, money-grubber, more con
cerned about doing well than doing
good.
But at Stanford's Graduate
School of Business, Law School and
School of Medicine, programs exist
to counter those stereotypes.
Two problems make it difficult
to go into public service.
One obstacle is the overwhelm
ing financial cost of a professional
school education.
The Law School has designed a
pragmatic and generous program
to solve this problem by subsidiz
ing graduates who go into public
interest work; it will help them
with their loan payments if they

go into public service.
A more subtle obstacle involves
institutional attitudes toward
public service.
Innovative programs like the
three-year-old Public Management
Initiative at the Business School
and the Lawyering for Social
Change classes now being designed
at the Law School help meet that
need for support.
The Medical School lags behind
the other two schools in providing
public service opportunities.
With the aid of creatively
designed programs like these,
Stanford's professional school stu
dents should find it more feasible,
financially and otherwise, to use
the skills they have learned to help
others directly.
