Keeping names confidential in keeping with goals

THE DAILY'S Nov. 9 editorial
"Justice in the dark" is a mixed
blessing. While it draws attention
to a central and controversial charac
teristic of the judicial process — the
confidential nature of disciplinary
records — it also overlooks or mis
states some key facts.
1. The judicial process at this Uni
versity is governed by The Legislative
and Judicial Charter of 1968 (as subse
quently amended in 1969, 1975 and
1981).
Unless a student requests a public
hearing, which has happened only once
since 1982, one of 12 "rights of the
person charged" takes over "to be
assured that, in private hearings, any
matters of fact that would tend to
identify the person charged would be
kept confidential" (Regulations, p. 12).
To call this a "tradition of secrecy"
is sheer histrionics: It is a requirement
of the process that neither I nor

others are free to ignore.
2. Like any other requirement
around here, this assurance of con
fidentiality can be changed by the
appropriate body — in this case, the
Committee of Fifteen, a standing com
mittee appointed annually by the Uni
versity president. (Regulations, p. 13).
3. The only disciplinary records that
are "virtually impossible for interested
outsiders to access" are those where
the students involved are easily identi
fied even though their names are
concealed. With that exception, people
may — and do — peruse the anony
mous conviction records that are kept
in the Judical Affairs Office.
Anonymous case records are also
used in orientation programs to illus
trate the various routes through the
judicial process.
The editorial urges that the "names
of convicted violators ... be made
public." As I indicated above, this

could happen through a change to the
current Judicial Charter. Such a
change, however, would signal a shift
from a disciplinary system that em
phasizes educational goals.
Stanford's judicial process does im
pose sanctions, but we assume that the
student will learn from his or her
mistake and go on to become a suc
cessful student, indistinguishable from
others whose ethical shortcomings were
less serious and less visible.
In my view, to identify convicted
violators is to impose another penalty,
that of publicity — a penalty which
could not be either controlled or cali
brated.
Were the names of highly visible
violators, whose success depends on
their clean names, and lesser-known
violators, whose success does not, to be
released, what would happen to the
concept of equal punishment for equal
offenses?

Perhaps one could argue that the
additional penalty of publicity is
deserved for the student who is a
public figure and who is convicted of
dishonesty, but what about situations
where the media glare also deeply
wounds others — especially friends and
family — who are innocent of any
wrongdoing?
At what point are the costs of
publicity too high for the benefit of
deterring other possible violators?
Strict confidentiality is a requirement
of the current judicial process, not the
result of any individual's desire to be
secretive.
The requirement supports the Uni
versity's emphasis on education and
rehabilitation, but perhaps it is time to
take a fresh look at that long-standing
institutional policy.
