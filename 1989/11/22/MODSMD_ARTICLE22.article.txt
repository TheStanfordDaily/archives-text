# Democratic Socialists do not fund partisan political activities
## 
### 
We, as members of Stanford Demo
cratic Socialists of America (DSA), are
writing in response to an article pub
lished in Friday's Daily. At the Nov. 9
ASSU Senate meeting, senator Enrique
Origgi attempted to deny funding to
the Stanford Central American Action
Network and the Stanford DSA, alleg
ing that we are partisan political
groups and, as such, should not receive
funding.
We believe this allegation has no
basis in fact, and we would like to
clarify the nature of our activities for
those who might share his concern.
According to ASSU guidelines, the

Program Board is prohibited by law
from funding any groups who will use
that money for political partisan activi
ties.
The federal tax guidelines define this
as directly or indirectly supporting
candidates for political office or sup
porting ballot initatives.
Stanford DSA has never used ASSU
funds for these purposes. Stanford
DSA receives annual funding from the
ASSU Program Board to support our
programming and mailings.
This money is used for speakers as
well as to help with copying and
mailing our newsletter, which we dis
tribute several times a year.
The specific purpose for which we
requested the funding that was nearly
denied Nov. 9 was to help us bring
Barbara Ehrenreich to speak on
campus.

Although Stanford DSA receives an
nual funding from the Program Board,
we requested additional funds for the
Ehrenreich event, since it was more
ambitious than the event we had previ
ously budgeted.
Ehrenreich is a well-respected
feminist author and social critic. She
writes for Ms. and Mother Jones
magazines and has published articles
in The New York Times. Her books
and articles are read by students in
Feminist Studies courses. Ehrenreich is
also an honorary chair of Democratic
Socialists of America.
In addition to the Program Board,
we received support from Residential
Eduaction, the ASSU Speakers'
Bureau, the Stanford Women's Center,
the Program in Feminist Studies, the
Stanford Pro-Choice Alliance and other
groups.

Ehrenreich met informally with stu
dents in Robinson House over dinner
before speaking to an enthusiastic audi
ence in Cubberley Auditorium.
Stanford DSA has been an ASSU
funded student group for over eight
years. It is open to Stanford students,
faculty and staff. Its purpose is to
educate the Stanford community about
current issues, to bring a democratic
socialist perspective to current debates
and to involve people in action around
issues of concern.
We believe that our activities are
within both the letter and the spirit of
ASSU regulations, and we invite stu
dents with further questions to contact
us directly.
