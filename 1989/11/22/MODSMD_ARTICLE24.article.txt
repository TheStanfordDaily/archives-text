## The
						East Palo Alto wall 
### 
THE OPENING of the Berlin Wall
is an image that is hard for a col
umnist desperate for ideas to
resist. It is a powerful picture â€” a barrier
separating two very different places sud
denly crumbling to create a freer and
fairer society.
The Berlin Wall is so famous that it
is known simply as "The Wall," as if it
were the only barricade of its kind. But
there are similar walls present in the
United States today, although they are
rarely the focus of intense media cover
age.
The walls in this country are less tan
gible than the sprawling cement structure
in Germany, but they do exist.
In fact, there is a wall in the Stanford
area, dividing the towns of Palo Alto and
East Palo Alto.
There are a lot of differences between
these neighboring communities, but the
one I'm most familiar with is in the
schools.
I started tutoring this year with the
Ravenswood-Stanford Tutoring Project,
and I've learned that the gaps between
the Palo Alto and East Palo Alto school
districts are immense.
The Palo Alto Unified School District
is one of the wealthiest in the state. The
Ravenswood City School District in East
Palo Alto is one of the most underfunded.
Palo Alto's per-pupil expenditures are
among the highest in California.
Ravenswood's per-pupil allocations are
below the local median. While a large
number of Palo Alto students go off to
college, about 60 percent of Ravenswood
children drop out of high school.

The two districts are as physically close
as East and West Berlin, and the dis
parities between the two systems are just
as great.
But the comparison between the wall
splitting Berlin and the wall splitting Palo
Alto is not entirely consistent.
Reactions by local people to the opening
up of portions of the wall between the
Palo Alto and Ravenswood City school
districts would probably be quite different
than the excited reactions of West Ger
mans greeting their Eastern counter
parts.
The reception for a large number of
Ravenswood students entering the Palo
Alto schools would be a little less enthu
siastic. Instead of champagne corks pop
ping in celebration, there would more
likely be lawyers filing lawsuits challeng
ing the new open policies, and parents
predicting the future erosion of quality
in their schools.
There have been minor breakthroughs,
though, and small portions of the wall
have fallen. The Tinsley Desgregation
lawsuit, which was filed in 1976 and
settled in 1986, did introduce a few meas
ures to help the Ravenswood district.
According to the tutoring program's
information manual, the suit provided
the opportunity for up to 206 voluntary
transfers for Ravenswood children who
wished to attend school in other districts.
In addition, the settlement required a
state-funded study on methods of improv
ing academic achievement in the
Ravenswood district.
A study on the feasibility of magnet
schools was also commissioned.

There is a wall In the
Stanford area, dividing the
towns of Palo Alto and
East Palo Alto.

Of course, general studies and trans
ferring students out of the district don't
do much to improve the schools them
selves. And while tutoring programs can
act as small hammers chiseling away at
the wall of inequality, they can't really
do much more than create a few cracks.
The only way for the wall to suffer a
significant blow is through a dedicated,
long-term commitment to increased fund
ing for the Ravenswood district. A strong
financial bulldozer is necessary to destroy
the wall and to bring the two districts
closer together academically and econom
ically.
The excitement about the opening of
the Berlin Wall is certainly justified, but
it need not exclude concern about other
walls, like the one separating the Palo
Alto and East Palo Alto schools.
This wall may be less famous but it
divides people just as effectively, and the
result is just as harmful.
