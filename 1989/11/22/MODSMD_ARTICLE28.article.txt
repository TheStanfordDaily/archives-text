## Do you ever nod off in your afternoon class? Here's why 
### Joanna Sosinska 
Is it your Greek history profes
sor or is it you?
Every day at 2:15 you walk into
the class vowing that today will
be different, today you'll control it.
And then what happens? Ten
minutes into the lecture, you start
yawning regularly every five
minutes. The head droops, the eye
lids begin to feel heavy, the con
centration falters, the pen starts
writing scribbles on a blank sheet
of paper.
You are not alone. The cause
of your afternoon sleepiness is not
a boring professor or a lack of
interest in classical Greece. Sleep
researchers, including ones at the
Stanford Sleep Disorder Clinic,
have found strong evidence of a
biological readiness to nap in the
mid-afternoon, regardless of the
amount of sleep received the pre
vious night.
"It seems nature definitely in
tended that adults should nap in
the middle of the day, perhaps to
get out of the midday sun," says
Psychiatry Prof. William Dement,
director of Stanford's highly ac
claimed sleep laboratories.
Studies at Stanford have found
that an urge to nap is built in.
In 1986, researchers set up a sum
mer sleep camp in Lambda Nu to
study the cycles of sleepiness and
wakefulness in student volunteers
throughout the 24 hours of the
day.

Polysomnographers, who tap
sleepers' brains with fancy equip
ment, used brain wave recordings
to measure the subjects' greatest
tendency to sleep. To their
surprise, sleep researchers discov
ered that the inclination to nap
was strongest in mid-afternoon.
At first, afternoon drowsiness
was attributed to eating a big
lunch, but studies at the Univer
sity of Ottawa pointed out that
alertness decreased whether or
not subjects ate lunch. Sleepiness
is purely dependent on time of
day rather than on eating, the
Ottawa researchers found.
This new evidence on napping
has important consequences for
several professions. Truck drivers
and hospital workers, whose ur
gent need for alertness must often

compete with building drowsi
ness, can benefit greatly from af
ternoon naps, reserachers say.
And for college students, whose
sleep cycles are often very unsta
ble, mid-afternoon naps can sig
nificantly increase mental
alertness and intellectual ability.
So if you've ever been accused
of laziness because you sneaked
a snooze at 3 p.m., feel guilty no
more. Your incessant yawning in
afternoon classes may be no more
under your control than is your
hunger at noon.
But, researchers say, an after
noon nap does not make up for
significant sleep deprivation. Ac
cording to Dement, studies reveal
that almost no one gets the opti
mal amount of sleep, and this is
definitely true of college students.

If you've ever been
accused of lazi
ness because you
sneaked a snooze
at 3 p.m., feel
guilty no more.

During most of the day, Dement
says, "this sleep debt is masked
by stimulation: things like phys
ical activity, conversation, and
hunger." But during times of little
stimulation, your physics lecture
for example, the sleep debt
manifests itself.
A study of Stanford students
revealed that over half had a rat
ing of "severely impaired" on a
standard sleep test. "If their
length of sleep was extended to
10 hours over four or five days,"
Dement says, "they would achieve
a level of alertness that is nearly
ideal."
And 10 hours of sleep each night
is what Dement claims to be the
ideal amount for any individual.
Anything less than that attributes
to frequent bouts of sleepiness and
decrease in alertness and intellec
tual ability. But even if you got
plenty of sleep, that desire to doze
in the afternoon would still be
apparent during your 2:15 p.m.
lecture.
