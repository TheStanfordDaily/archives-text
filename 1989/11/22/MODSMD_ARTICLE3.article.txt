# Student helps found S. African paper
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
In South Africa, the times are chang
ing. But many note that the basic social
structures and laws underlying that
country's apartheid system are not.
Several critical observers feel that the
development of a free press should be
the next step in South Africa.
To that end, Dr. Teu Hargey has been
traveling around the United States to
drum up support for his group's plan
to establish the first free and indepen
dent multiracial newspaper in South
Africa's history.
Hargey, the first "colored" Rhodes
scholar from South Africa, is president
of a group of Cape Town intellectuals
known as the Open House Society.
Hargey has already received support
for the newsweekly, which will be called
"The Forum," from several Silicon Val
ley companies. Hargey has a building
in Cape Town, a potential staff of jour
nalists and a March deadline to put out
the first issue of his ground-breaking,
desktop-published paper.
But March is still far away and Har
gey came to the Bay Area with a laundry
list of things he needed.
One pair of sympathetic ears that
heard his calls for help belong to Stan
ford senior Lena Slachmuylder.

None of the nuts and
bolts of apartheid has
been changed or dis
cussed.

Slachmuylder heard about Hargey's
plana last year when she was working
on South African issues for a Berkeley
based organization.
Slachmuijlder will finish up next
quarter with a degree in international
relations. She was planning to travel to
Zimbabwe and get an internship when
she heard about Hargey's plan.
"I've been interested in journalism
for a long time," she said. "Working for
'The Forum' seemed appropriate and
useful."
Slachmuijlder said her studies have
focused on southern Africa over the past
two years.
"The recent changes in South Africa
are superficial," she said. "None of the
nuts and bolts of apartheid have been
changed or discussed."
Slachmuijlder plans to travel to South
Africa in the next few months and join
others on the project, many of whom
are established South African jour

nalists who have pledged to quit their
jobs when "The Forum" gets rolling.
Until then, Slachmuijlder is meeting
with campus groups to try to raise funds
and get the equipment needed to launch
the project.
Last week, she met with the Black
Student Union and spoke to residents
of Ujamaa House. So far, she said, stu
dents have been receptive.
"I plan to go to the co-op community,
too," said Slachmuijlder, who was a res
ident of Columbae.
"We need equipment for desktop pub
lishing, and we also need students who
are interested in serving as contacts in
this area," she added.
Though "The Forum" will focus on
the community surrounding Cape
Town, tackling tough issues of race and
gender that many other South African
papers do not, Slachmuijlder said Har
gey hopes to sell at least 1,000 subscrip
tions in the U.S. at first.
Slachmuijlder also suggested that,
when the project gets oft the ground,
journalism students at Stanford might
be able to work as interns with "The
Forum."
Such an internship would offer great
opportunities to journalism students
who want to test their mettle in the
fire of one of the world's hottest
hotspots.
