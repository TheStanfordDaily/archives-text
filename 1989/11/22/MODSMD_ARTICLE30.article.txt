The academy is an indepen
dent scientific society sup
ported by the Swedish
government, with a mission to
promote research activities in
Sweden and worldwide. The
Academy selects the winners
of Nobel Prizes in Physics and
Chemistry.
Bjorkman came to the Car
negie Institution in 1964,
where for some years he
worked with the experimental
taxonomy group and col
laborated with the bio
chemistry group in invest
igations for the basic mecha
nisms of photosynthesis.

Bjorkman has undertaken
wide-ranging field and labora
tory studies of environmental
aspects of photosynthesis.
Hospital nursing
renovations
The Stanford Hospital is
upgrading its nursing units to
be state-of-the-art facilities, in
what is expected to be a $6
million project.
Some work on the project is
already underway, including
asbestos removal and demoli
tion to get the second- and
third-floor units ready for
rehabilitation. The work is ex
pected to be completed in
summer 1990.
When the project is com
pleted, the renovated units
should look similar to the nurs
ing units in the new hospital
wing that opened in January,
said Malinda Mitchell, acting
