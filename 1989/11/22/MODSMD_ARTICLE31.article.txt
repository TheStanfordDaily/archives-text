# Alcohol is pervasive, but knowledge isn't

Stanford students have a prob
lem. A drinking problem.
So says University President
Donald Kennedy, who was partic
ularly disturbed by the many
alcohol-related incidents at this
weekend's Big Game.
Stanford students have another
alcohol problem. They don't know
much about it, particularly about
the way the body processes it.
While students may enjoy the
effects of alcohol, they
probably dislike at least one of
the effects of drinking: the"beer
belly" or excess body fat that
results from overconsumption.
Perhaps contrary to a common
belief, alcohol contains no fat.
While it is true that some alcoholic
drinks, such as piria coladas, have
a high fat content, alcohol itself
is fat-free. However, alcohol does
promote the production of fat.
The liver, which contains the
alcohol-breaking enzymes, is the
only organ that degrades alcohol.

When the liver gets hold of the
alcohol, the liver enzyme alcohol
dehydrogenase starts to degrade
it. Since there is only a fixed
amount of this enzyme available
at a given time, any extra Jllcohol
must wait for its turn to be broken
down.
As it waits, the extra alcohol is
shunted out of the liver into the
blood. It is the alcohol in the blood
that provides the sedating effects.
But face it. Too much alcohol
can have bad effects.
Besides causing damage to liver
and brain cells, alcohol can build
up in the tissues to the point of
toxification if too much is in the
blood. The liver enzymes cannot

work fast enough to degrade a
huge amount of alcohol at one
time. This is why 20 beers in one
hour may be toxic, but 20 beers
in 20 hours is not.
When alcohol is broken down,
it has two possible fates: the pro
duction of energy or the produc
tion of fatty acids. The choice
between these is based on the
amount of energy needed by the
body.
If you have not eaten for a while
and are burning stored energy,
you will use the alcohol for energy.
But, if you are not in the so-called
energy deficit, you will produce
fatty acids which will be converted
to body fat.
Everbody is different, and
everyone breaks down alcohol at
a different rate. A person with
low alcohol dehydrogenase will get
a higher blood alcohol level and
a higher state of drunkeness than
someone with higher levels of the
enzyme.
The amount of alcohol

dehydrogenase available depends
on how often a person drinks and
how much food he or she has
eaten. A person on a very low
calorie diet or who is fasting, even
for only a day, will have lower
levels of the enzyme than someone
on a normal diet. Consequently,
someone who has been eating less
experiences both a greater and
longer effect.
Eating while drinking alcohol
will decrease the effect of alcohol
because it will take longer for the
alcohol to get into the blood. This
will not affect the enzyme as much
as normal eating patterns do,
though. The more often a person
drinks, the more alcohol
dehydrogenase they have. This is
why alcoholics can drink a lot and
not experience as great an effect
as someone who drinks infre
quently.
Although there are many inter
actions and factors involved in the
metabolism of alcohol, alcohol can
be metabolized differently depend
ing on how you eat.
