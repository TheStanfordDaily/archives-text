# With Grecian Formula, you too can look like Reagan

with graying hair. Among other things,
they promise to "restore your natural color."
Now this might be fine for Ronald Reagan,
but I have red hair. What color would my
hair become if I used this stuff?
A. To solve this week's mystery, I made
• the long trek to Men's Hair Care at
the local drug store. I found the correct
aisle, took out my trusty notebook and
well-chewed pen and started inspecting the
box labels for clues.
I knew immediately that I was on to
something when I saw Grecian Formula
among the store's wide selection of products
to get rid of gray hair. While the others

were al! simple hair dyes, Grecian claimed
to "work for any hair color," because it
"works with the hair's natural chemistry."
I pondered this strange claim while I
slowly pedaled back from the store. As I
reached home, I decided to go straight to
the source and call up Combe Inc., the
makers of Grecian Formula.
I talked with a woman in Consumer
Service. She told me that Grecian Formula
"actually works the fastest on red hair."
That was a good enough answer for me.
I scrawled down the quotation you just
read and asked for her name. I suppose I
could have called her a "high-placed cor
porate staff member with inside informa
tion," but why bother?
It was then that she made her mistake.
She lost her cool and refused to give me
her name. Since answering questions was

supposed to be her job, her attempt to
remain anonymous made me suspicious.
My questions became sharper, and she
attempted to throw me off the track by
suggesting I contact other company offi
cials.
Realizing I could learn nothing more
from her, I made a few additional phone
calls.
I contacted Herbert Lapidus, Combe's
chief of research and development. (Rumor
has it that he is also known as the "Einstein
of Odor." I don't know why.)
All colors of hair are some mixture of
varying amounts of three different pig
ments — yellow, brown and black. Accord
ing to Lapidus, when hair loses this
pigment, it turns gray.
Grecian Formula gets rid of gray hair
by replacing the hair's lost natural pigment

with a not-so-naturaJ one. Using the prod
uct daily creates very dark brown hair.
Less frequent use creates light brown hair.
Grecian Formula does not restore red hair,
Lapidus said.
This fact explained the Consumer Service
representative's desire not to be identified,
but it still doesn't really explain the lan
guage on the box label. But, since people's
hair tends to turn darker as they age (how
many 50-year-olds do you know with
screaming red hair?), perhaps they can get
away with it.
