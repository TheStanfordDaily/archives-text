## Third-ranked water polo pushes for national title San Diego, Irvine and Cal float in the path to the championship 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
It is NCAA tournament time, and for
the 17th time in the 20-year history of
the event the Stanford water polo team
will be vying for the National Champi
onship, a crown the Cardinal has worn
six times.
With its emotionally-charged win over
No. 1 California last Saturday, the Car
dinal finds itself with a three-game win
streak and proud owners of the No. 3
seed in the NCAA tournament, which
begins Friday at the Natatorium in In
dianapolis, Ind. According to team mem
bers, things could not be any better.
"We are peaking right now," junior
Chuck Maguy said. "[The California
win] gave us momentum and confi
dence."
"I'm really happy," senior Jeff Oeding
echoed. "We couldn't have been seeded
better."
Oeding, who leads the team with 46
goals, was named to the All-Pacific 10
Conference team. Junior Rick McNair
(45 goals) and goalie Todd Kemp were
also honored as All-Pac 10.

Each of these players will be key to
the Cardinal's championship hopes, but
in a year where any of the top five
seeds could win, Dettamanti sees his
All-American net man as the key.
"Our ace in the hole is Kemp," Det
tamanti said. "Everyone who has won
the NCAAs has had a strong goalie.
Todd could be the difference."
Stanford's position as the number
three seed has them meeting No. 6 UC-
San Diego in the first round Friday,
with the likelihood of then meeting No.
2 seed UC-Irvine in the semifinal round
on Saturday.
A win against the Anteaters could
mean another re-match against top
seeded California Sunday night. Stan
ford has beaten the defending-champion
Bears twice this year.
The Cardinal beat San Diego 11-6
earlier in the year, but Dettamanti in
sists they can not be overlooked. Still,
both players and coaches alike have
their sights set on Irvine. No one is
worried about the championship game,
because as Dettamanti said, "that takes
care of itself."
"The second game is the most impor

tant," assistant coach Matt Tingler said.
"The guys like playing Irvine."
Stanford and Irvine are 1-1 against
each other, but Irvine's win came during
its own tournament, one in which Stan
ford lost two games in a row and
dropped from its No. 1 ranking to No.
6. Irvine has also been struggling of late.
"I'd rather play Irvine than any other
team," Oeding said. "They just aren't
playing that well right now."

Stanford goalie Todd Kemp was named the best goalie in the Pacific 10 Conference
Monday. Kemp, who led the Cardinal to a national title his freshman year, will look to
repeat the championship feat this weekend in his final performance at net. Coach Dante
Dettamanti says that Kemp will be the key if the Cardinal is to take the national title away
from California, the defending champ and No. 1 seed.
