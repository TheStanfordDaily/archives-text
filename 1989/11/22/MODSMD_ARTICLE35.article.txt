# Mr. Clutch protects Cardinal net
## 
### Jason Wagoner 
The scenario: One minute and 12
seconds remain in the Stanford water
polo team's last regular-season game
against No. 1 California. Stanford leads
8-7. A Cal player rockets the ball from
six meters out, targeted at the upper
right-hand corner of Stanford's goal.
The man: Senior goalie Todd Kemp,
a three-time AU-American and a 1989
first-team All-Pacific Coast Conference
goalie, lunges to his left, enveloping the
ball in his soft hands. The momentum
swings back into Stanford's favor and
the Cardinal holds on to defeat the
Bears.
Like a great clutch hitter in baseball
who comes through in the bottom of

the ninth with runners in scoring po
sition, Kemp seems to have a knack for
pulling down key shots to give his team
a psychological boost.
Kemp will have one final chance to
come through in the clutch this weekend
as Stanford seeks a national title in
Indianapolis, Ind. He will man the net
Friday as Stanford opens against UC-
San Diego in the NCAA tournament.
As senior Jeff Oeding describes,
"When Todd's out there, I don't have
to worry because I know he's always
going to do his part."
Kemp has been "doing his part" since
1985 when the freshman took over as
the starting goalie on a team that won
the NCAA Championship.
According to Coach Dante Det

tamanti, "Todd's unusual because he
started as a freshman goalie, and he
played an important role in helping the
team win the NCAAs." That year Kemp
was chosen a first-team Ail-American.
In Kemp's sophomore season his level
of play steadily improved as he led his
team to the NCAA Championships and
a perfect 36-0 record. Again, he collected
first-team All-America honors.
Redshirting his junior year because
he planned to pursue a coterminal
degree in computer science and history,
Kemp roared back in 1988, again nab
bing All-America honors.
As his college water polo career winds
down, Kemp has established himself as
one of the premiere shot blockers
in the nation. However, Kemp,
who stands 6-foot-2, is "short for
an NCAA goalie, and does not
have really long arms," Det
tamanti explains. Why then has
Kemp been so successful at Stan
ford?

'When Todd's out
there, I don't have
to worry because I
know he's always
going to do his
part.'
— Jeff Oeding

First of all, Kemp is extremely
disciplined, both mentally and
physically. "He never lets any
thing get to him. He has definitely
mastered the mental aspect of the
game," Oeding says.
Kemp is also gifted with pow
erful legs. "Todd's legs are so
strong that he probably could
have been a high-jumper if he
didn't end up playing water polo,"
Dettamanti explains. "If he keeps
his legs fresh, he's like a spring
in the water."
These mental and physical at
tributes may put Kemp in a po
sition to vie for the starting job
on the United States water polo
team.
"Todd is third on the depth
charts (on the U.S. team) right
now, but after last summer's club
championships in San Diego and
this season's solid performances
he could be opening some eyes on
the international level," Det
tamanti says.
Anything is possible — Kemp
may star in the 1992 Olympics,
diving to block a shot as time runs
out in the gold medal game.
Much like he did many times
for Stanford, Mr. Clutch comes
through.
