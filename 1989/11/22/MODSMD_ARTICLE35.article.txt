# Mr. Clutch protects Cardinal net

The scenario: One minute and 12
seconds remain in the Stanford water
polo team's last regular-season game
against No. 1 California. Stanford leads
8-7. A Cal player rockets the ball from
six meters out, targeted at the upper
right-hand corner of Stanford's goal.
The man: Senior goalie Todd Kemp,
a three-time AU-American and a 1989
first-team All-Pacific Coast Conference
goalie, lunges to his left, enveloping the
ball in his soft hands. The momentum
swings back into Stanford's favor and
the Cardinal holds on to defeat the
Bears.
Like a great clutch hitter in baseball

Kemp will have one final chance to
come through in the clutch this weekend
as Stanford seeks a national title in
Indianapolis, Ind. He will man the net
Friday as Stanford opens against UC-
San Diego in the NCAA tournament.

the starting goalie on a team that won
the NCAA Championship.
According to Coach Dante Det

tamanti, "Todd's unusual because he
started as a freshman goalie, and he
played an important role in helping the
team win the NCAAs." That year Kemp
was chosen a first-team Ail-American.
In Kemp's sophomore season his level
of play steadily improved as he led his
team to the NCAA Championships and
a perfect 36-0 record. Again, he collected
first-team All-America honors.
Redshirting his junior year because
he planned to pursue a coterminal
degree in computer science and history,
Kemp roared back in 1988, again nab
bing All-America honors.
As his college water polo career winds
down, Kemp has established himself as
