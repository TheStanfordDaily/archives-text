# Shoeless center says Big Game victory was no turkey
## 
### 
Thanksgiving was made for me.
I want to shake the person's
hand who thought of a holiday
where all you are supposed to do is eat
a huge meal and then lie around and
watch football games for the rest of the
day. It almost sounds Roman.
Although I enjoy Thanksgiving, there
will be a couple of things missing about
this year's celebration at the Roggeman
house.
First of all, my two little nephews,
Brandon (age 5) and Matthew (age 2),
won't be at Mom and Dad's house like
usual. Normally, they make Pilgrim hats
and Indian headdresses out of paper for
us all to wear during dinner. It's really
amusing to see Dad with a headdress
which reads, "Big Chief Papa."
Also, instead of having close to 10 fam
ily members at the meal, there are only
going to be four of us there this year.
All the more turkey and mashed potatoes
for me.
One of the Thanksgiving traditions

that will still be practiced at my house
is taking a moment to realize all the
things for which we are grateful.
The end of a football season is a good
time for similar reflection, and there are
many things for which I am thankful.
I'm thankful to be walking. Last year,
at this time, I wasn't. The much-more
mobile me is happy that I won't be toting
around crutch sticks to match my
drumsticks on Turkey Day.
I'm thankful to have six more hours

a day to study (or play pool) now that
my career has run its course.
There are some odd occurrences that
I am grateful to have seen throughout
this season.
After our last Thursday practice, fresh
man Steve Hoyem accepted a bet. Six
guys chipped in two dollars each to see
him keep an entire can of chewing tobacco
in his mouth for 20 minutes — without
spitting. He did it. Yuck.
Another sight I am thankful to have
witnessed occurred on the same day. Our
freshmen are forced to sing a rendition
of "The Dirty Golden Bear." Halfway
through the song I thought I felt another
tremor from the earthquake, but it was
only Bob Whitfield breakdancing.
I am thankful that I was treated to
an odd experience every day that Tuan
Van Le walked into the locker room. I
have never seen, and will never see,
clothes that look as strange as his. I
consider myself lucky — I guess.
I must admit that I am thankful that

most of the people watching our game
against Cal were wearing sunglasses.
That fashion faux pas of red on red would
have damaged the unprotected eye (Tuan
loved the look).
There are many other things for which
to be thankful in the football program.
Our trainers work an abundance of
hours every week. They are understaffed
and underpaid, but their devotion to
Stanford's athletes is exemplary. They
know some pretty good jokes, too.
I also appreciate the efforts of our
equipment managers. They have to pack
all the equipment for 60 players, in ad
dition to remembering to bring every
thing that we could possibly forget. It
was nice to know that I could go to the
equipment window and ask for anything
and get it.
Our conditioning coach, Steve "Sarge"
Schulz, has not always been easy to
thank. After running sprints and lifting
weights under his tutelage, I sometimes
thought I should choke him, but I didn't

have the energy. Now that I'm done, I
can appreciate all of the rigorous training
through which he put me.
I still don't envy all the returning
players who have to go through it.
I am thankful for everybody that works
in Athletic Administration, especially Sue
Lemmon. More than a few times, my
pudgy little fist was pounding on her
door, looking for answers to logistical
questions. Sue, I promise I'll make a
purely social visit soon.
I am most thankful to every man with
whom I played football. They made the
college football experience full and re
warding for me.
There is something which cannot be
expressed in terms of Thanksgiving. Ap
preciation is far too mild to describe what
happened in Stanford Stadium on Satur
day, November 18, 1989.
I am simply ecstatic and overjoyed that
we have The Axe.


TIMOTHY ROGGEMAN
THE BUCK STOPS HERE
I have been smiling ever since
I saw 24-14 in favor of the good
guys with no time left on the
clock. I walked out of the stadium
feeling a sense of completion at
the end of my football career and
not even an inkling of emptiness.
There were the usual groups of
young kids seeking autographs
and chin straps after the game. I
signed a few programs and started
feeling bad that I had nothing to
give away.
I looked down at my shoes and
realized that I would never have
to wear them again. I looked at
the wide-eyed little boy whose pro
gram 1 was signing, and said, "Do
you want my shoes?" His face lit
up, and before I knew it, I was
walking back to the locker room
in my socks.
He sure appreciated it, but I
don't think his family will be that
thankful when the aroma from
those shoes drowns out the smell
of turkey tomorrow.

Buck Roggeman was the long
snapper on the football team. He
ends his career short a pair of
shoes but with enough memories
to last his whole life long.
