After two exhibition victories,
the Cardinal men's basketball
team starts its season for real Fri
day night.
The team defeated Brewster
Heights 109-87 and the Nosso
Club 65-63 but those exhibitions
don't count in the team's record.
Friday night at Maples Pavilion,
however, Stanford meets Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo.
Game time is 7:30 p.m., and
the contest will be televised live
on the Pacific Sports Network.
"Now is a counter," Cardinal
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"There'll be a little more nervous
ness, a little bigger crowd, 1
hope. ... I think we're ready to
play."
Montgomery is not sure exactly
who will be in the starting lineup,
but the frontcourt is probably set.
Derek Bruton started both exhibi
tions at center and will probably
do no again.
The forward spots will be filled
by Adam Keefe and Andrew
Vlahov. Keefe led the team in scor
ing in each of the two games and
Vlahov hit a game-winning three
pointer with four seconds remain
ing against Nosso.
Another frontline player who
has played well so far is Deshon
Wingate, who has 25 rebounds in
the two games. "Deshon has
played awfully well," Montgomery
said. "Coming ofT the bench, he's
really given us a lift."

The backcourt is more jumbled.
John Patrick and Kenny Ammann
started the exhibitions but red
shirt freshman Peter Dukes has
played well off the bench. Dukes
had six assists against Brewster
Heights and 10 against Nosso.
"I'm just trying to find out
what my best combinations are,
who plays well together and who
makes the other players look
good," Montgomery said.
Card notes
Redshirt freshman forward/center
Paul Garrett broke a finger in practice
and will be out for about three weeks.
Stuart Thomas will return to
Maples Pavilion tonight for the first
time in two years. Thomas came to
Stanford out of high school but trans
ferred to Cal Poly-SLO after his soph
omore year here. He averaged 1.5
points per game as a freshman for
the Cardinal and 2.2 per game as a
sophomore.
Freshmen forwards Jim Morgan,
Jason Weaver and Hrent Williams
will redshirt this year.
