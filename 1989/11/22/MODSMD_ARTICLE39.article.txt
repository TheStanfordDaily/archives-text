The preliminaries are over. Let the games begin.
After weeks of preparation, the shocking loss of
two players who decided to transfer and an exhibi
tion that allowed the team to show off its talented
freshmen, the Stanford women's basketball team
embarks on the 1989-90 season this Friday at the
Communiplex National Hall of Fame Classic in Cin
cinnati.
The Cardinal will face Michigan State in its opener
and then the winner of the Ohio University-
Cincinnati game Saturday.
It's unlikely the team will encounter any trouble
along the way — unless they run out of chocolate
chip cookies.
For the benefit of those who missed it, senior
All-American Jennifer Azzi was the featured wom
en's hoopster in the Sports Illustrated College Bas
ketball Preview. In a profile by Douglas S. Looney,
readers were told of Azzi's love of basketball and
of chocolate chip cookies.
Oh, and SI ranked the team No. 1 in the nation.
That ranking was the second top spot the Cardinal
garnered — the first being from the Women's Bas
ketball News Service. In the preseason Associated
Press poll announced Sunday, the squad was placed
at No. 3. USA Today gave it the same spot Monday.
