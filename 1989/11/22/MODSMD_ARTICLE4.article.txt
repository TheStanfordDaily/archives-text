# Battery, inciting charges against Jackson dropped
## Junior pleads 'no contest' to reduced charges 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Louis Jackson got an early birthday pres
ent yesterday.
As part of a plea bargain, four mis
demeanor charges against him stemming
from the May 15 takeover of Building 10
were dismissed, including the most serious
charges Jackson had faced, inciting to riot
and battery.
Jackson, who turns 21 today, pleaded
"no contest" to the two remaining charges,
trespassing and resisting arrest, and will
be sentenced next week.
Jackson's lawyer, Joseph Billingsley, said
his client's punishment would most likely
consist of public service work, though what
kind of work and how much work was not
clear, he said. There is no reason to believe
that Jackson will receive any jail time as
part of his sentence, Billingsley said.
The in-court announcement of yester
day's plea bargain followed a 90-minute
closed-chambers session between Bil
lingsley, Asst. District Attorney Thomas
Fahrenholz and Palo Alto Municipal Court
Judge Stephen Manley.
Following the court hearing, Jackson
called the plea bargain "an agreement that's
going to benefit both sides."
The plea bargain announcement marked
the first substantial on-the-record progress
toward pretrial resolution of Jackson's case,

which has endured several delays and ac
cusations of racially biased prosecution.
At Jackson's last court appearance, on
Nov. 1, Billingsley said after a closed
chambers conference that the case was

nearing resolution, but the
only in-court announce
ment was that the recent
earthquake had thrown
the court calendar off, fur
ther delaying Jackson's
case.
Until yesterday, the dis
trict attorney had not been
willing to drop the battery
charge against Jackson.

Mandy MacCalla, the receptionist who
was the alleged victim in the battery, signed
a civil compromise agreement saying she
had no complaint against Jackson. The dis
trict attorney, however, argued that the
agreement was not valid because the alleged
misdemeanor occured under "riotous" con
ditions.
Fahrenholz was not available for com
ment following yesterday's proceedings.
Jackson's inciting to riot charge was of
ficially amended to resisting arrest yester
day. The charges of unlawful assembly and
refusal to disperse were dropped as part
of the plea bargain.
Since Jackson's arrest in June, support-


Jackson
era have said he was unfairly sin
gled out for his role in the
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office. Fifty
eight students were arrested in
connection with the takeover, but
only Jackson faced six mis
demeanor charges and a possible
sentence of up to two years in jail.
Fifty-three of the protesters
were sentenced Oct. 4 on the
charge of trespassing and received
a penalty of 40 hours of service
work and six months probation.
Upon his sentencing next Tues
day, Jackson will deliver a state
ment in court regarding his case.
Jackson said yesterday that he

hoped that his life would return
to normal following his sentenc
ing. "After next week, I'll be
chilled," he said. "I've pretty
much had to ditch the whole quar
ter because of dealing with this."
But he said his experience with

the county judicial system would
not affect his commitment to the
issues of multiculturalism that led
him to participate in the May 15
takeover.
"If I have to go through this
again, I will," Jackson said.
