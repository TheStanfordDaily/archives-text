day as the Stanford men's golf
team ignited past Oregon and
UCLA and into first place at
the UCLA Intercollegiate in
Palm Springs.
Heading into today's final

team led San Diego State by
three strokes and the host
Bruins by four shots.

round," said Goodwin. "He was
an excellent junior college
player, and he is doing just as
we expected. But really, every
body did very well today."
Stanford sophomore Chris
tian Cevaer and senior Mark
Funseth boosted the Cardinal
cause with rounds of 70 and
74, respectively. Funseth, who

after the first day, faded at the
end of the second round but is

golf team cut three strokes off
its first-round total of 312, but

Whitfield named
2nd team All-Pac-10

Stanford Cardinal couldn't
have expected to place too
many players on the All-Pacific
10 Conference team. But when
the team was announced yes
terday and freshman offensive
tackle Bob Whitfield was the
only Stanford representative, it
was nonetheless surprising.
Whitfield, the 6-foot-7, 300-
pounder, was a second-team se
lection. Stanford was the only
Pac-10 team that failed to place
anyone on the first team.
