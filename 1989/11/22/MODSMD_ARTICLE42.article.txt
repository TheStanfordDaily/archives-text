The Stanford women's volley
ball team concludes the 1989
season in Hawaii this Thanksgiv
ing weekend. It's a nice way to
spend the holiday, but Plum Gym
on the University of Hawaii
campus is no paradise. And play
ing the Rainbow Wahinis twice
will be no feast.
Hawaii, which has yet to lose
at home this season, is currently
ranked second in the nation after
losing just its second match the
year to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
over the weekend. Hawaii's only
other loss was to top-ranked
UCLA in Los Angeles.
"They're one of the best teams
in the country, and they're always
tough at home," Stanford Coach
Don Shaw said. "It's about as good
a test as we can possibly ask
for. ... These are good practice
matches for us. It should help
prepare us for the NCAAs.
"We know that anything can
happen once you get into the
playoffs. If one team gets hot, you
can really go a long way. We just
hope we can string together a
bunch of good matches, and this
(weekend) will be something that
will help get us going in that di
rection," Shaw said.
Stanford concluded its Pacific
10 Conference schedule over the
weekend by losing to Washington
before rebounding to trounce
Washington State. The Cardinal
ends the season tied for second
in the Pac-10 with Washington
and will receive either the second
or third seed in the NCAA re
gional tournament.
With the weekend matches, the
Cardinal upped its record to 17-9
on the season, good enough to
receive a seventh-place ranking in
this week's Tachikara/AVCA na
tional poll. But Stanford has had
no success against teams ranked
higher than itself in the poll. The
Cardinal is 0-5 versus teams in
the top six, including two losses

to both UCLA and Pacific.
The Rainbow Wahinis, however,
have stormed through the regular
season, piling up 25 wins along
the way.
Stanford will conclude a frus
trating regular season this week
end, a season in which the Car
dinal has already lost three times
as many matches as it lost last
year (including the postseason).
In spite of the losses, however,
Shaw feels that this year's squad
is every bit as good as last year's.
"I think we can beat anybody
in the country," he said. "But
we've got to go out and do it.
What I think doesn't mean a
whole lot unless we go out there
and prove it. The players need to
do that, they need to prove it to
themselves and they need to ex
ecute. That's the bottom line."
"We need to just execute well
and do some of the things that
we've worked on all year and do
them well against a good team.
(We need) to prove to ourselves
that if we do them well, it doesn't
matter who it is we're playing
against, we can be successful,"
Shaw said.
The Cardinal will return to Cal
ifornia on Sunday afternoon,
probably around the time that the
NCAA selection committee will be
announcing its regional tourna
ment pairings. Because Stanford
will be the region's second or third
seed, the Cardinal will host a first
round match in Bumham Pavil
ion next Thursday evening. The
site of the regionals will also be
announced Sunday.
