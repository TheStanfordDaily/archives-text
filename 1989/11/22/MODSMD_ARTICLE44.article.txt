# Reality check: no journey to the tourney
## 
### 
When the Stanford men's
basketball team reached
the NCAA tournament
last year for the first time in a
half century, many felt it would
usher in a new era of basketball
greatness on the Farm.
Unfortunately, as this era
enters its second year, reality is
setting in a hurry.
The team's chances of a second
straight appearance in the tour
ney lie somewhere between slim
and none. The returning guard
corps played a total of under 100
minutes last season. None of
Coach Mike Montgomery's five
recruits is likely to make half the
impact Adam Keefe did in 1988-
89.
No one is suggesting the Car
dinal will be terrible this season.
Stanford has enough big, bruising
bodies to out-muscle almost any
team. Montgomery has never had
a losing season as a head coach
— and says he doesn't plan on
doing so now.
Then, of course, there is Keefe.
The 6-foot-9 sophomore promises
to blossom into a bona fide star
as the season progresses. He can
not carry the team, though. Un
like the superstar guard who can
take over a game all by himself,
the superstar big man needs
someone to help.
He needs someone to get him
the ball when he's in position, and
he needs someone to keep the de
fense honest so it can't collapse
on the middle.
That inside-outside threat came
in the form of Howard Wright

and Todd Lichti last year. They
are both gone. While Keefe has
the ability to become Mr. Inside,
Mr. Outside is probably playing
for another team.
Probably even in another con
ference. Stanford's problem, you
see, is not entirely self-created.
Yes, it's true few of the top high
school basketball players have a
chance of playing here because
they don't meet the school's aca
demic requirements.
But the "we can't get them past
admissions" refrain only tells half
the story. The biggest handicap
facing Montgomery and Stanford
in their quest to build a national
powerhouse is that they toil in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
In order to entice top talent to
Stanford, the Cardinal has to pro
vide the big arenas, the television
exposure and the high-caliber
competition found in the Big East,
Big Ten and Atlantic Coast Con
ference. The Pac-10, regrettably,
offers none of these.
It's not likely to anytime soon,
either. While new schools join the
basketball elite each year, they

The prospects aren't
bright. Not only is the
improvement of the
Pac-10 halting at best,
Stanford basketball
1989 is going to have
to scratch and claw
all year just to finish
in the first division.

tend to be the lesser teams in the
top conferences. Consider, for ex
ample, that Villanova, Providence
and Seton Hall — three recent
Cinderellas that reached the Final
Four — are all out of the Big East.
This rich-get-richer syndrome is
fostered by an ever-increasing
flow of NCAA tournament dollars
into the conferences that place the
most teams in the postseason
party — and send them the far
thest. Meanwhile, the Pac-10 has
its share of March Madness mar
ginals who get knocked out in the
first round.
But money isn't the only prob
lem. Let's take the case of Duke
and see what Stanford has to com
pete against. Duke has three Final
Four appearances in four years,

a top-flight academic reputation
and an ability to attract blue-chip
recruits.
While the Blue Devils play in
an arena no larger than Maples,
they play in the ACC. Mont
gomery can offer a chance to play
against Arizona and a resurgent
UCLA with an occasional ESPN
appearance. Duke Coach Mike
Krzyzewksi can promise two or
more meetings a year with North
Carolina, N.C. State and Georgia
Tech in places like the Dean Dome
and on networks like CBS and
NBC.
Plus Krzyzewski can get a
made-for-TV matchup with Ari
zona at the 50,000-plus seat
Meadowlands in East Rutherford,
N.J., like he did last season.
For Stanford basketball to
develop, the team is going to have
to be a contender for the confer
ence crown in a conference that
goes more than two or three
schools deep. In other words, the
Cardinal has to be a better team
in a conference that gets better
each year.
The prospects aren't bright. Not
only is the improvement of the
Pac-10 halting at best, Stanford
basketball 1989 is going to have
to scratch and claw all year just
to finish in the first division.
At the moment, that is the only
reality that matters for the Car
dinal.

When the Stanford men's
basketball team reached
the NCAA tournament
last year for the first time in a
half century, many felt it would
usher in a new era of basketball
greatness on the Farm.
Unfortunately, as this era
enters its second year, reality is
setting in a hurry.
The team's chances of a second
straight appearance in the tour
ney lie somewhere between slim
and none. The returning guard
corps played a total of under 100
minutes last season. None of
Coach Mike Montgomery's five
recruits is likely to make half the
impact Adam Keefe did in 1988-
89.
No one is suggesting the Car
dinal will be terrible this season.
Stanford has enough big, bruising
bodies to out-muscle almost any
team. Montgomery has never had
a losing season as a head coach
— and says he doesn't plan on
doing so now.
Then, of course, there is Keefe.
The 6-foot-9 sophomore promises
to blossom into a bona fide star
as the season progresses. He can
not carry the team, though. Un
like the superstar guard who can
take over a game all by himself,
the superstar big man needs
someone to help.
He needs someone to get him
the ball when he's in position, and
he needs someone to keep the de
fense honest so it can't collapse
on the middle.
That inside-outside threat came
in the form of Howard Wright

and Todd Lichti last year. They
are both gone. While Keefe has
the ability to become Mr. Inside,
Mr. Outside is probably playing
for another team.
Probably even in another con
ference. Stanford's problem, you
see, is not entirely self-created.
Yes, it's true few of the top high
school basketball players have a
chance of playing here because
they don't meet the school's aca
demic requirements.
But the "we can't get them past
admissions" refrain only tells half
the story. The biggest handicap
facing Montgomery and Stanford
in their quest to build a national
powerhouse is that they toil in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
In order to entice top talent to
Stanford, the Cardinal has to pro
vide the big arenas, the television
exposure and the high-caliber
competition found in the Big East,
Big Ten and Atlantic Coast Con
ference. The Pac-10, regrettably,
offers none of these.
It's not likely to anytime soon,
either. While new schools join the
