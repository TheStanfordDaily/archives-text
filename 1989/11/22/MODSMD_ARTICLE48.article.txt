# Rocking Roble rolls in playoffs
## 
### Rob Johnstone Staff writer 
It is often suggested that the
number of teams be reduced in
the intramural playoffs to avoid
merciless blowouts. After all, tele
vision revenue isn't part of the
equation like in the professional
ranks.

With 32 or 64 teams qualifying
for the playoffs, first-round
playoff games are typically not
very exciting. The top-seeded
teams usually crush their oppo
nents by scores of 42-0 and 34-2.
But, as this week's first-round
action in the B league football
playoffs showed, these games can
be extremely exciting. They pro
vide opportunities for colossal up
sets, with teams who barely
qualified for the playoffs shocking
the seeded teams with upset vic
tories.
By far the biggest upset of the
week came Friday when Donner
(2-3) beat 3L (5-0), the number
two seed in the tournament. Play
ing in front of a huge, screaming
Donner crowd, Donner rallied late
in the game to break a scoreless
tie and beat 3L, 6-0.
The Donner defense stifled the

previously unstoppable Law
School offense, led by Eddie
Donovan's three interceptions.
Donovan's third interception came
late in the second half, setting up
Donner's winning touchdown
drive.
Donner moved the ball inside
the 3L 15-yard line, with time
running and under a minute
remaining in the game. The play
of the game — possibly of the
intramural football season —
came on a third and goal from
the 10 with 11 seconds remaining.
Donner quarterback Ross Shell
went back to pass and was chased
back 30 yards by two 3L pass
rushers. Shell eluded the rushers
with an 180 degree spin move and
began to sprint back toward the
line of scrimmage. He then fired
a pass into the corner of the end
zone to a diving Donnerite, James
Assey, for the winning touchdown.
The Donner crowd erupted,
mobbing quarterback Ross Shell,
who had run out of bounds after
making his winning pass.
"I felt like the game really
meant something with our crowd
backing us up like that. It was
our intensity and the crowd that
pulled us through," said a jubilant
Shell after the game.
Unfortunately, the crowd
couldn't help the Donner team to
a second-round victory, as Roble

IB ended Donner's Cinderella
story with a 6-2 defeat.
The other huge upset of the
week came when (3-2) Roble 1A
beat the Grateful Med 12-6 in
overtime. The Grateful Med (5-0),
the number four seed in the tour
nament, had numerous opportu
nities to win the game in
regulation, but could not convert
these opportunities into touch
downs.
The number one and number
three seeds both avoided first
round upsets. No. 1 Invisible
Hands pummeled Toyon 26-0, and
the No. 3 Betas edged OrthoMed
7-0.
In other B league playoff games,
Oh Larry beat Taxi 25-21 in a
seesaw battle which saw five lead
changes in the second half. Taxi
scored with three minutes left in
the game to take the lead 21-19.
But Oh Larry bounced right
back and marched down the field,
finally scoring on a touchdown
pass from quarterback Bruce
Arndtsen to receiver Mike Kesti
with 1:15 left in the game.
In coed playoff action, Roble
scored on its first two plays from
scrimmage to build a 14-0 lead
over Flo Mo that it would not
relinquish. Roble looked strong on
both offense and defense, winning
27-7.
