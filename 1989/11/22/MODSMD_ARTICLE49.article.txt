# Pentecostalism strong in Mexico

### Jonathan Eisenberg Editorial staff 
A speakers series on Latino
spirituality began last night with
a lecture by Dr. Manuel Gaxiola,
director of Mexico City's Center
for the Study of Religion in Latin
America, on the growth of Pen
tecostalism in Central and South
America.
Addressing an audience of
about 30 in a History Corner lec
ture hall, Gaxiola, a Pentecostal
theologian, presented his thesis
that Pentecostalism can spread
even more quickly throughout
Latin America than it already has
if it goes back to its religious roots
in the spirituality of the native
Indian cultures.
Pentecostalism has become the
second largest force in Christian
ity behind Roman Catholicism,
Gaxiola said.
Pentecostalism is a religious
movement that arose in the early
20th century and separated from
historic Protestant denomina

tions. Pentecostals believe in the
tangible manifestations of the
Holy Spirit, oflen in demonstra
tive, emotional ways such as
"speaking in tongues" and
healing.
According to Gaxiola, there are
about 70 million Protestants in
Latin America today and, by the
year 2000, there will be 140 mil
lion Protestants, of whom 100 mil
lion will be Pentecostals.
However, some Latinos resist
it because they see the spread of
Protestantism as a reflection of
U.S. and European imperialism.
The European conquerors intro
duced Protestantism to the Native
Americans in the late 16th cen
tury and "free-lance" American
missionaries continue to attempt
to bring their religions to Mexico
and Central America.
Gaxiola emphasized that
Protestantism spread throughout
Latin America before the time of
the American colonists. And he
said that Latin America was per

meated by native Indian religions
in pre-Columbian times.
According to Gaxiola, the native
Indians had a concept of salvation,
although it was more about com
munal salvation than individual
salvation.
Also, the Indians recorded their
metaphysics in rich poetrv and
songs, had a very spiritual mys
ticism — a "quietness and profun
dity of feeling" — and had a tra
dition of fiestas, theatre and
storytelling.
These Indian practices would
appeal to the "Latin American
temperament" if they could be in
corporated into modern Christi
anity, Gaxiola said.
Gaxiola's vision of Pentecos
talism is distinctly Latin Ameri
can, as opposed to Western Euro
pean, because it incorporates In
dian spirituality. In responding to
a question at one point, he said
with a smile that Latinos should
never forget that "tortillas are
perhaps better than cornflakes."
