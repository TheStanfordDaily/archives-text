# Alpha Delts admit women

When the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity in
itiated its first pledge class as an unhoused
fraternity last weekend, it also became the
first nationally-affiliated coed fraternity at
Stanford.
Out of the pledge class of about 20 people,
about 15 are women, according to Chandra
Hampson, a sophomore who is one of the
new active members.
Hampson said she drew into the house
before she knew they would be having a
coed fall rush. "I liked the people . . . and
wanted to keep up the Alpha Delt theme
Pledging was an extra bonus," she said.
The Alpha Delts had been wanting to let
women in for many years, but the Univer
sity and their international organization
would not let them, according to Steve
Miller, a senior who joined the fraternity
in spring 1987.
"For years, we were saying (to the Uni
versity), 'if you let us have females in the
house, we'll fill it,' " Miller said. "All the
girls who joined have been hanging out [at
Alpha Delts] anyway," he added.
"Ironically, by losing our house we get
to go coed," Alpha Delts President Manoj
Waikar said.
The University announced last December
that the Alpha Delts would lose their house
after they failed to meet their quota for
three out of four years and after the housed
fraternity system as a whole failed to meet
its pledge quota.
Five other Alpha Delt chapters nation
wide admit women, though the interna

tional organization does not fully endorse
the practice. The international currently
admits women as "associate members," but
says it wants to ban coed chapters,
Hampson said.
But Charity Kahn, another new Alpha
Delt member, commented that if more and
more chapters keep going coed, "they can't
ban all of us."
Kahn, a junior, says there has been "no
opposition" to women joining the fraternity
from the male members.
Another new member, Dan Catherwood,
said his decision to join was partly influ
enced by the group's going coed. Mainly,
though, he said he thought the house was
cleaner and more livable than it was last
year.
Jody Burkes, a newly initiated member
who rushed last spring before he knew the
house was going coed, said he thought
having women in the group was "definitely
a positive experience. . . . you get a different
view of things, a different perspective."
"More fraternities should go coed,"
Burkes said. "A lot of fraternities that now
experience trouble with their rush would
be rejuvenated."
Burkes also felt that if more fraternities
were coed, "a lot of the sexism inherent
in ... an all-male living situation . . . would
go away." But Miller and Kahn both said
they did not think there was much sexism
at Alpha Delts to begin with.
Kahn said she didn't think there had
been many changes to the initiation proc
ess, though Catherwood said he thought
the words to a few songs had been changed.
