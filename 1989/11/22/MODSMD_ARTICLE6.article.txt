# Federal inspection gets underway
## Examination centers on badly damaged Geology Corner

As she reached for the
doorknob, Sally Nyman reflected
on her job over the past few
weeks.
"This is like 'Let's Make a Deal.'
Just pick a door," she joked.
But instead of finding
showrooms filled with glamorous
prizes on the other side, Nyman
saw classrooms covered with fal
len plaster.
Nyman, a state inspector,
belongs to an outside team of ex
perts who are examining buildings
campuswide for earthquake
damage.
The consultants have been
recruited by the Federal Emer
gency Management Agency from
diverse organizations to double
check Stanford's damage es
timates. Their report will better
enable the agency to recommend
federal aid to the University,
Nyman said.
Yesterday, she and her group

examined the cracked walls and
buckling floor that marred many
rooms in Geology Corner.
The building was among the
hardest hit on campus, said the
consultants. Upon entering it,
they could not help but notice the
numerous cracks evident through
out.
"Looking at this ceiling, could
I tell that there was an earth
quake?" Nyman asked.
"In a building like this, you
could go around and count cracks
all day," she *dded.
As the party proceeded from
room to room, inspectors noted
additional d3mage to the building.
Some new proulems had resulted
from aftershocks, while others
had come from the building eet
tling in pla^.
AJong the wall of Room 327, an
alumni directory from another
university had lodged itself in the
wall.
Most likely, the floor of the
room began to separate from the
wall during the quake. This al

lowed the book to fall in the crack,
Hart said.
"It seems wedged in there
pretty good," he added, tugging
at the directory, which wouldn't
budge.
At one point, the group heard
footsteps from the floor above and
went upstairs to check. Because
of safety hazards, Geology Comer
is locked and access to the build
ing is limited.
Once there, they found a geol
ogy professor and five others sort
ing a rare rock collection to be
shipped to the Smithsonian Insti
tute. None of them were wearing
protective helmets.
Fearing for the group's well
being, the engineers asked the re
searchers to leave the unsafe
building and don helmets before
continuing.
"I've got my life's work here,
and I've got to put it away," the
professor protested.
"It's up to you if you want to

The Geology Corner was hit hard by the earthquake; nearly every room la In disarray, and the
building Is In noed of much structural repair. Federal Emergency Management Agency consultants
will be Inspecting some 240 University buildings for damage over the next week.
