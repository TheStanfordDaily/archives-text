Stanford contributes
to new soccer field
East Palo Alto children will
finally be able to play soccer
near their schools, thanks to
volunteers from Stanford and
other community organiza
tions.
A new soccer field, the first
in East Palo Alto, has been
built adjacent to the
Ravenswood Middle School and
Green Oaks Academy, which is
a newly opened alternative
school for "at risk" children.
The University donated the
seed and fertilizer for the proj
ect and is supervising the in
stallation of a sprinkler system.
In addition, Stanford is arrang
ing the general maintenance of
the soccer field.
The Foothill-DeAnza Com
munity College District's
landscape crew prepared the
land according to plans de
signed by the American Society
of Landscape Architects. The
regional Kiwanis Club donated
goal posts.
The soccer field was dedi
cated last weekend. Volunteers
are currently painting and
landscaping the two East Palo
Alto schools.
Kahn art exhibit
closes this weekend
An exhibition commemorat
ing Art. Prof. Matt Kahn's 40
years of teaching studio art at
Stanford closes this Sunday.
The exhibition, in the Stan
ford Art Gallery, includes 52
of Kahn's works. The gallery
is open weekdays, 10 a.m. to 5
p.m., and Saturday and Sun
day, 1 to 5 p.m.
The paintings reflect what
Kahn calls his "three major
sustaining qualities: my love of
pattern, of structure and of
composition." Compositions of
simple shapes apparent in his

early work give way to later
works addressing natural phe
nomena and architecture in its
broader natural context.
One room of the gallery
traces the evolution of Kahn's
work from paintings featuring
round forms to canvases that
were themselves round or oval
in shape. A distinction of
Kahn's work is its use of the
cornerless canvas as "a most
willing new kind of stage for
spatial and rotary composi
tions," according to Kahn.
Grant received for
resources study
A recent monetary grant will
enable students from develop
ing countries to come to Stan
ford and study international
issues such as global warming,
deforestation and overpopula
tion.
Stanford's Morrison Insti
tute for Population and
Resource Studies has received
a $490,000 grant from the John
D. and Catherine T. Mac Arthur
Foundation and will begin the
international exchange pro
gram later this year.
The grant will enable people
from India, China, Africa and
South America to come to
Stanford to study demography,
population biology, ecology and
other social sciences that will
help them address environmen
tal problems in their own coun
tries.
In addition, the exchanges
will help American scholars and
policymakers understand
global problems from the per
spectives of developing coun
tries, an opportunity that has
often been neglected according
to Biological Sciences Prof.
Marcus Feldman, director of
the Morrison Institute.
The institute started at
Stanford in 1984 as the Com
mittee on Population Studies.
