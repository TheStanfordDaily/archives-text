THE TECHNOLOGIES/THE PRODUCTS
Over the years, Raychem has built a family of products through the successful
interaction of diverse technologies including: •Crosslinked Polymers *High
Performance Polymers • Adhesives • Fiber Optics •Shape-Memory Alloys
• Electrochemistry 'Elastic Memory • Ceramics • Liquid Crystals "Conductive
Polymers 'Gels 'Thin Films "Advanced Materials Engineenng.
To manufacture its wide variety of products efficiently, the company has
developed expertise in many areas of unique process technology
Compounding, beaming, extrusion, molding, and deformation are Raychem's
fundamental production processes
We offer thousands of products to hundreds of markets around the world. Our
products include the XAGA multi-purpose cable closure system, used by the
telecommunication industry This heat-shnnkable sleeving device is
