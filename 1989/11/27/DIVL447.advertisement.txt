Am I cut out to be an Engineer?
• Considering an engineering major?
• Feel like physics or calculus is genetic, but not in your family?
• Wondering what industrial or mechanical engineering actually is?
• Worried about course scheduling?
• Concerned that your double major in electrical engineering and
physics might not be worth it?
•Just curious about why 1 /5 of Stanford's undergraduates decide to
major in engineering?
If you find yourself asking any of these questions or others remotely similar,
then the Undergraduate Advising Center can give you the answers.
In addition to our regular advising staff you 11 find a new engineering peer
advisor interested in helping you get the facts as well as talking about your
concerns.
So..
Call the UAC at 723-2426 to make an appointment, or
