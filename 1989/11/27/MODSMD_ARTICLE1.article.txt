# Chinese students fear veto
## Kennedy telegram, bike rally support visa bill 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
Fear that President Bush will
veto legislation to extend their
visas left Chinese students at
Stanford with little to be thankful
for over the holiday weekend.
Faced with the prospect of
being required to return to China,
students here searched for ways
to make their voices heard in
Washington.
Representatives of the Associa
tion of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford met
Wednesday with University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy and former
Secretary of State George Shultz.
Kennedy sent a personal telegram
to Bush supporting the students.
The same day, Chinese students
staged a bike rally from White
Plaza to Sunnyvale.
In the past week, the House of
Representatives and the Senate
both unanimously passed a visa
extension bill sponsored by Rep.
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. The
"Emergency Chinese Immigration
Relief Act" would lift the require

ment that Chinese visiting the
United States on J visas return
home for two years before being
able to go abroad again.
About 90 percent of the 400
Chinese students at Stanford are
on J visas.
Despite the wide congressional
support enjoyed by the bill, it is
likely that Bush will veto the bill,
according to Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., in an interview with The
New York Times Friday. Simpson
is a close friend of Bush.
The State Department has come
out in strong opposition to the
waiver. In a letter sent to all con
gressmen, the department points
to threats made by the Chinese
government to terminate educa
tional exchanges with the United
States, including the currently
suspended Fulbright exchange
program, as reasons to veto the
bill.
U.S. officials suspended the
Fulbright program following the
Tiananmen Square massacre in
June.
But Kennedy, in his telegram
to Bush, cited his concern for the

community of Chinese nationals
at Stanford and urged him to sign
the Pelosi bill.
"We are fearful that, given the
current political situation in
China, even the perception that
students were involved in [the pro
democracy movement] will likely
subject them to serious penalties
and personal harm if they were
compelled to return to China at
this time," Kennedy wrote in his
telegram to Bush Wednesday.
Chinese students said Shultz
promised them that he too would
urge Bush to support the bill, but
they did not know if he has done
so.
About 50 Chinese students
gathered in White Plaza at noon
Wednesday to rally in support of
Pelosi's bill and convey their mes
sage to other Stanford students
that "the situation is critical."
"Every day our passports and
visas are expiring," one Chinese
student said.
After the White Plaza gather
ing, students began a bike rally

distributing fliers opposing President Bush's expected veto of a bill which would lift a requirement
