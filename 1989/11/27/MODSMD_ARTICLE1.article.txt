# Chinese students fear veto
## Kennedy telegram, bike rally support visa bill 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
Fear that President Bush will
veto legislation to extend their
visas left Chinese students at
Stanford with little to be thankful
for over the holiday weekend.
Faced with the prospect of
being required to return to China,
students here searched for ways
to make their voices heard in
Washington.
Representatives of the Associa
tion of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford met
Wednesday with University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy and former
Secretary of State George Shultz.
Kennedy sent a personal telegram
to Bush supporting the students.
The same day, Chinese students
staged a bike rally from White
Plaza to Sunnyvale.
In the past week, the House of
Representatives and the Senate
both unanimously passed a visa
extension bill sponsored by Rep.
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. The
"Emergency Chinese Immigration
Relief Act" would lift the require

ment that Chinese visiting the
United States on J visas return
home for two years before being
able to go abroad again.
About 90 percent of the 400
Chinese students at Stanford are
on J visas.
Despite the wide congressional
support enjoyed by the bill, it is
likely that Bush will veto the bill,
according to Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., in an interview with The
New York Times Friday. Simpson
is a close friend of Bush.
The State Department has come
out in strong opposition to the
waiver. In a letter sent to all con
gressmen, the department points
to threats made by the Chinese
government to terminate educa
tional exchanges with the United
States, including the currently
suspended Fulbright exchange
program, as reasons to veto the
bill.
U.S. officials suspended the
Fulbright program following the
Tiananmen Square massacre in
June.
But Kennedy, in his telegram
to Bush, cited his concern for the

community of Chinese nationals
at Stanford and urged him to sign
the Pelosi bill.
"We are fearful that, given the
current political situation in
China, even the perception that
students were involved in [the pro
democracy movement] will likely
subject them to serious penalties
and personal harm if they were
compelled to return to China at
this time," Kennedy wrote in his
telegram to Bush Wednesday.
Chinese students said Shultz
promised them that he too would
urge Bush to support the bill, but
they did not know if he has done
so.
About 50 Chinese students
gathered in White Plaza at noon
Wednesday to rally in support of
Pelosi's bill and convey their mes
sage to other Stanford students
that "the situation is critical."
"Every day our passports and
visas are expiring," one Chinese
student said.
After the White Plaza gather
ing, students began a bike rally

Chinese students participate in a bike rally in White Plaza Wednesday. Ralliers rode to Sunnyvale
distributing fliers opposing President Bush's expected veto of a bill which would lift a requirement
that Chinese students return home for two years before going abroad again.
along El Camino Real, flying bal
loons with slogans urging Bush
to support human rights in China
by signing Pelosi's bill. The two
and-a-half hour rally concluded in
Sunnyvale, following several stops
at shopping centers and grocery
stores along the way to distribute
fliers and collect signatures.
The Chinese student association
has also sent a representative to
Washington to meet with legisla
tors and policy advisers in an at
tempt to persuade Bush not to
veto the bill.
Shortly after the Tiananmen
Square massacre, all Chinese stu
dents in the United States were
granted an automatic visa exten
sion until June 1990. Chinese stu
dents say Bush's advisers are
considering a similar program in
stead of the home country return
waiver mandated by Pelosi's bill,
but this plan does not meet with
the students' approval.
Yin Hezhu, president of the
Stanford association, rejected the
idea of a second extension as a
substitute to Pelosi's bill.
"It is not a question of how
long an extension, but a question
of the two-year return require
ment. It is a chain around Chinese
students' and scholars' necks,
pulling you back to China."
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center,
agreed. The extension programs
are simply ways of avoiding the
question of whether or not the
two-year return requirement will
be enforced, he said.

Chinese students at Stanford
dismiss the arguments offered by
the State Department supporting
a presidential veto. They point out
that the Fulbright program is al
ready in a state of suspension and,
while they would like to see con
tinued educational exchanges be
tween China and the United
States, the personal safety of stu
dents here now is a more pressing
issue.
"Those who are in China now
who might be able to go abroad
are not at immediate risk," said
one Stanford student, "but if we
return we face going to jail."
Pelosi has called on Bush not
to her bill and promised that, if
he does, she will go ahead with
efforts to override the veto, given
the unanimous support received
by the bill in Congress.
Chinese students across the
United States have voiced dismay
at the possibility of being forced
to return home after their studies,
whether or not the political situ
ation in China has changed.
The ongoing persecution of
those involved in the pro
democracy movement within
China has led many students to
believe that, as a result of their
activities in the United States,
they will suffer similar treatment
should they have to return to
China.
Events in the United States ap
pear to support that conviction.
Recent visitors to the Chinese con
sulate in San Francisco reported
that there is a blacklist of students
who have been politically active
in the United States. Students on
this list have had their passports
confiscated when they attempted

'It is a question of the two-year return
requirement. It is a chain around Chi
nese students' and scholars' necks,
pulling you back to China.'

to renew them.
According to a position paper
of the Independent Federation of
Chinese Students and Scholars,
"For those of us whose visas have
not expired, the fact that we will
eventually have to return to China
for two years gives Beijing a pow
erful repressive tool. We live in
constant fear and anxiety that
whatever we say or do in America
will bring punishment when we
return home."
Luo Zhexi, chair of the Harvard
University Association of Chinese
students, wrote in the statement,
"If we do not get any protection
from the United States govern
ment and Congress, the result will
be that the Chinese democracy
movement in this country will
perish."
As it is, more and more Chinese
students are entering an uncom
fortable state of limbo as they
approach graduation. One Chi
nese student said there are from
30 to 40 students at Stanford who
are on the verge of graduating
but are afraid to lose their student
status.
"Right now they are just sitting
on their theses," he said.
The long-term consequences for
American scholars doing research
in China are unclear if the Chi
nese government goes ahead with
its threat to cut off exchanges in

the wake of a veto override.
Several Stanford faculty members
are involved in collaborative re
search projects in China, but at
least one of these, a geology proj
ect in Xinjiang, is already
suspended because of American
fears about the security of re
searchers.
Theodore Foss, assistant direc
tor of Stanford's Center for East
Asian Studies, said it is unlikely
that the Chinese government will
cut off all exchange because of its
interest in preserving at least
some semblance of normalcy.
More important to the Chinese
government, in Foss's view, is the
threat of lost talent should the
40,000 Chinese students, among
them many of China's best and
brightest, decide to take advan
tage of the extension to remain
in the United States.
Most Chinese students at Stan
ford are very adamant about their
intentions to return; they just do
not want to go back under the
present government. "We are not
seeking permanent residency,"
said one rally participant.
"Objectively, life is much better
here than in China," Yin said,
"but psychologically, in our
feelings and our hearts we want
to go back to China. I don't want
to stay here — my whole cultural
background is in China."
