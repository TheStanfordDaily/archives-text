PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP)
— The Communist premier held
unprecedented talks with opposi
tion leaders yesterday and then
joined bold reformer Alexander
Dubcek at a pro-democracy rally
before 300,000 elated, flag-waving
demonstrators.
Even the armed forces and riot
police, who jusc nine days ago beat
peaceful protesters, indicated
backing for the growing reform
movement. "We support the dem
ocratic changes," a riot policeman
told the crowd, which braved
freezing weather and snow.
Premier Ladislav Adamec be
came the first top official in 20
years to share a platform with
Dubcek, the former Communist
Party leader who spent two
decades in political exile after
Warsaw Pact tanks crushed his
"Prague Spring" reform move

ment in 1968.
Adamec also held his first talks
with leading dissident Vaclav
Havel and independents in an ef
fort to find a way to end the po
litical crisis and propel Czechoslo
vakia toward democracy.
The talks seemed intended to
clarify the situation as the Com
munist Party's policy-making
Central Committee began its sec
ond emergency session in three
days Sunday.
New party chief Karel Urbanek,
addressing the meeting, said the
Central Committee will make fur
ther personnel changes following
a msyor shakeup in the ruling
party last Friday. He also pro
posed an extraordinary party con
gress on Jan. 26 which would have
the power to elect an entirely new
Central Committee.
Urbanek also asked the Czec

hoslovak premier and the premier
of the Czech republic to submit
proposals on changing the func
tions of their interior ministries
— which are responsible for the
police — in the wake of police
brutality against peaceful Prague
demonstrators Nov. 17 that
touched off the past nine days of
mammoth anti-government
rallies.
The powerful Prague Commu
nist Party, in a harsh condemna
tion of party leadership,
demanded that Adamec, dumped
from the Politburo along with six
others Friday, be restored to the
panel.
"Dialogue has begun!" Havel
declared triumphantly at the rally,
which capped a week of pro
democracy demonstrations and
hectic moves by the Communists
to regain control.
