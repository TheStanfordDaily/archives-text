BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — After more than
40 years of Communist rule, Hungarians voted
freely yesterday on when and how to choose the
president of the new Hungarian republic.
"We wanted to take into our own hands the
possibility to decide on the people's future," said
Imre Loerincz, a printer, after voting.

His words were echoed by many as they
emerged from polling stations set up in schools,
hospitals and municipal buildings.
"After 40 years, it's high time" people can vote
freely on issues important to them, said Erzsebet
Nemere, a pensioner from a working-class district
of Budapest, the capital.
Final results were expected sometime today or
tomorrow.
