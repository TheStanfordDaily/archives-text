The UCMI staff report
documents problems but
offers vague answers

THE RECENTLY released
report of the University
Committee on Minority Is
sues subcommittee on staff issues
makes some important points but
ultimately raises more questions
than it answers.
The true test will come with the
University's response to the infor
mation contained in the report.
It is extremely valuable to have
documented evidence of the tre
mendous disparities between the
levels of satisfaction of white staff
and staff of color.
The extremely low percentage —
26 percent — of African-American
executive, administrative or pro
fessional staffers who expressed
satisfaction with their opportu
nities for advancement is particu
larly disturbing. While we are all
troubled by this knowledge, we
should be grateful to the committee
for placing an important problem
squarely before the campus com
munity.
With the exception of Recom
mendation 2, the proposal to give
greater authority to the Affirma
tive Action Council for all staff
matters, the committee's recom
mendations are fairly thin and gen
eral.
That the recommendations are
not on a par with the rest of the
report released last spring is not
necessarily the fault of the com
mittee members themselves. It is
understandably difficult for com
mittee members to put together a
megor report on top of their already
onerous responsibilities.
The fault with the inadequacy
of the report lies with the Univer

sity's leadership. If this investiga
tion was a priority, then the
committee members should have
received greater support in terms
of additional staff or a temporary
reduction in the job responsibilities
of those people compiling the
report.
That the University failed to put
more resources into this report
gives the impression that the well
being of the staff members on
campus is not a high priority. Ironi
cally, the medium of a reader
unfriendly and vague report is in
itself a message about the impor
tance of staff concerns.
Another problem in the produc
tion of the report was the exclusion
of the data on Native Americans.
This oversight is a slap in the face
to an entire community.
Statistical considerations should
not overshadow sensitivity to the
very groups that the report is sup
posed to benefit. It could have been
entirely possible to communicate
the findings regarding Native
Americans without skewing the
statistics.
Just listing the findings in a sep
arate table and including a few
paragraphs about the views of that
community would have alleviated
the problem.
Since the report mainly high
lights problems, it is up to the
administration to propose solu
tions and to provide institutional
direction and leadership to the ef
forts to improve the quality of life
for staff of color.
University President Donald
Kennedy's speech at Thursday's
faculty senate meeting will be an
excellent place to start. Kennedy
should lay out a plan of concrete
recommendations, and then the en
tire campus should come together
and display initiative and creative
energy in the struggle to create a
truly multicultural institution.
