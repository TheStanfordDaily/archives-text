New rules cannot prevent accidental IM injuries

THE SERIOUS INJURY to sopho
more Greg Smith in a Nov. 12
intramural football game has all
of us in the intramural department
deeply concerned.
We ask, "Could this injury have been
avoided? Can we avoid this type of
injury in the future?"
The problem is that there does not
appear to be a way to prevent the type
of action that led to the injury. Two
competent officials worked the game,
and in their written and oral explana
tions, they felt it was a good clean
contest.
The official covering the play during
which the injury occurred stated at the
conclusion of his report that "the
contact was purely accidental."

The play occurred with Greg as
offensive pass receiver and two
defenders attempting to deflect the
pass. While in mid-air, incidental con
tact took place and the injury occurred
when they hit the ground.
A rule cannot be legislated to
prevent this type of action unless, of
course, the players are not allowed to
leave their feet to receive or deflect a
pass. The same jumping situations
occur in basketball, soccer, ultimate
frisbee, etc.
Concerning football injuries on the
weekend of Nov. 11-12, first of all we
had approximately 70 games scheduled,
many more than usual. It was a
makeup weekend because we had to
reschedule games from the Sundays of

the USC and 49ers games.
Eight injuries were reported to our
two IM field supervisors. We had no
knowledge of any others who reported
to Cowell Student Health Center after
the completion of their games. We are
in the process of obtaining these
names and the extent of the injuries so
that we can contact them to find out
how the injuries occurred.
One IM participant recommended
"flag football" as a possible solution to
the injury problem. We believe there
would be more knee and ankle injuries
because of offensive players twisting to
avoid defensive players grabbing their
flag (to tackle them).
In fact, we once tried a 10 minute
game of "flag football" and all the

players preferred "touch tag football,"
the style of play we currently use.
The number of injuries this year are
about the same as in previous years
(with the exception of the weekend of
Nov. 11-12), but if they continue to
increase we will be forced to use
screen blocking with hands behind the
back to prevent injurious contact.
We are always looking for "iryury
proof rules" that do not take away
from the enjoyment of playing football.
We are open to suggestions.
We all have affectionate compassion
for the Smith family and hope for
Greg's recovery.
