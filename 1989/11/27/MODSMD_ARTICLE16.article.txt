# University needs to reconsider worth of wilderness course
## 
### 
According to an article in the Nov.
13 Daily, the Athletic Department said
financial constraints in hiring a new
coordinator are the reason for the dis
continuation of the "Wilderness Skills"
course.
Financial constraints are interesting
words when talking about the existence
of a non-profit program like Outdoor
Education in a department that brings
in big bucks from many of its competi
tive programs.
That competitive sports programs
receive a grossly disproportionate slice
of the budgetary pie is no surprise to
anyone. That there is not enough
money for one staff member for a non
competitive sports program like Out
door Education, then, may seem
expected, too.

The Stanford community derives
education, enjoyment and lots of money
from its football program. Outdoor
Education can boast only the first two.
The question the Athletic Depart
ment and the University need to ask is
whether Stanford is to remain an insti
tution of higher education, or one of
education for hire.
