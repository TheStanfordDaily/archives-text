# Students too timid to oppose sexist loudmouth at Flicks
## 
### 
At the Nov. 19 ASSTJ Sunday Flick,
"Lethal Weapon 2," some jerk sitting
two rows behind me decided to elo
quently voice his appreciation of Patsy
Kenzit's (the lead actress) beauty by
screaming "Yeeeowwwwww!" every
time she appeared on the screen.
He continued to do so long after the
rest of the crowd had decided to shut

up and watch the movie. He didn't
stop until he caught a glimpse of her
breasts in the sex scene.
Now maybe I, as a woman, am inca
pable of understanding why some men
lose control of their vocal chords when
they are aroused by some "hot bod,"
but I cannot imagine that I was the
only one in the entire audience who
wanted this loudmouth to shut up.
So why was I the only one who
shouted, "Shut up"?
Didn't anyone think that if they
conveyed their annoyance to Mr.
Mouth that he might just shut up,
having lost the support of his peers?
Were they so afraid of breaking out
of the norm that they would rather
put up with Mr. Mouth than open
their own (and believe me, you didn't
have to be a radical feminist to find
him obnoxious)?
We aren't afraid to condemn an en
tire nation's people by screaming, "We
hate all you South Africans" (also an
occurrence at this flick) in order to
gain some cheap applause, but when
we aren't sure of how our peers will

accept us, when there is the faint pos
sibility that we might just be labeled a
prude, or a bitch, or touchy or hyper
sensitive, we'll gladly keep our
thoughts to ourselves or say nothing.
Next time you keep your mouth
shut, think about why you're not
opening it.
