## The 						changes of decades 
### 
IN A LITTLE more than a month,
the 1980s will come to a close.
Quite a bit has happened in this
decade. For instance, disco, once all the
rage, has been replaced to everyone's
relief by house, rap and new age music.
Fortunately, bell bottoms, wide collars
and 100 percent polyester clothing in gen
eral have met their demises (although I
still see a graduate student here and there
making these fashion violations).
But aside from music and fashion —
politically, socially, economically and
educationally, this nation has witnessed
dramatic events and has been subject to
great changes.
For better or for worse, former Pres
ident Reagan's tenure in office has had
the most fundamental and long-lasting
impact on people's lives.
Reagan's theory of supply side econom
ics or the revised "triclde down" theory
resulted in a policy of cutting taxes by
about 20 percent for the wealthiest 10
percent of the nation in an effort to en
courage more business investment.
His administration also cut business
taxes and decreased government regula
tion of business in order to stimulate
production.
Reagan is gone now. However, his
legacy remains: The poorest 10 percent
of the nation now pays about 20 percent
more in taxes than it did in 1977.
The Civil Rights Commission has been
gutted, jeopardizing affirmative action in
education, employment and industry for
African-Americans and the rest of the
nation's people of color.
The 1973 Supreme Court decision in

Roe v. Wade, a monumental judicial af
firmation of a woman's right to choose,
is also in danger of being repealed.
The 1980s has also been a time in
which organized labor — beginning with
the air traffic controllers — has experi
enced intense attacks on its right to exist
and struggle for better working condi
tions.
It has also been a time in which
African-Americans, Asian-Americans and
Chicanos/Latinos have also experienced
an intensification of racist discrimination
and violence.
One need only mention Michael
Stewart (Howard Beach), Vincent Chin
(Detroit), Yusef Hawkins (Bensonhurst)
or the murders of Asian children in Stock
ton to be reminded that episodes of at
tacks on black, Asian and Chicano people
are replayed daily everywhere in the
country.
Concurrently, the 1980s has also been
a time in which progresssive people have
achieved a lot of victories.
In broad numbers, Americans said no
to Reagan's Supreme Court justice nom
inee Robert Bork, an extreme and
narrow-minded conservative, and his
nomination was rejected.
In his 1988 bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination, Jesse Jackson
became the highest second-place finisher
in the history of the primaries, capturing
nearly seven million votes.
And recently, voters in New York City
dumped Mayor Ed Koch and his racially
divisive politics for former Manhattan
borough president David Dinkins and his
politics of inclusion.

Reagan is gone now.
However, his legacy
remains.

Chicana cannery workers in Watson
ville achieved an unprecedented victory
resulting from their two-year strike
against the Watsonville Canning Compa
ny.
Students of color and progressive
whites have reactivated their desire to
determine how they are educated, as wit
nessed by Stanford's victorious CIV
struggle and the 1987 and 1989 statewide
marches on Sacramento for educational
rights.
The 1980s, although a watershed for
conservative and reactionary politics, has
also been an era in which blacks, other
people of color and liberal whites have
reasserted their voices and renewed the
struggle to improve the lives of everyone.
As we end this decade and approach
the 19905, this movement of people will
gain even more strength and move this
nation to become one in which the needs
and the interests of the majority of people
are served.
