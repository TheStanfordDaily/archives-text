### Ken Yew Staff writer 
â€¢ John Kaplan, a popular Stan
ford law professor and leading au
thority on criminology, died of
cancer Thursday at his home in
Palo Alto. He was 60.
Kaplan was best known for his
work linking sociological research
with legal policies, especially as
applied to drug regulation. He
served on several government
committees, advising mostly on
drug laws and criminal law.
Kaplan began teaching at the
Law School in 1965 and has since
introduced hundreds of first-year
law students to criminal law. He
also taught a very popular under
graduate course on criminal jus
tice.
Law School students in the
graduating class of 1989 voted to

give Kaplan the John Bingham
Hurlburt award for excellence in
teaching. He was also elected chair
of the Faculty Senate for the
1988-89 year.
"He became one of the major
social scientists of criminal law,"
said Law Prof. Robert Weisberg.
"He always demanded that the
theoretical discussion of law con
front the hard facts produced by
criminological research."
Law School Dean Paul Brest
said Kaplan was nationally
renowned in criminal policy. Brest
said Kaplan "had the eye of a
hard-nosed policy analyst. ... He
was one of a few legal academics
who also had an expertise in policy
analysis without ideological
preconceptions. He always called
things as he saw them."
Brest added that Kaplan was
one of the Law School's most

popular teachers and "was fast on
his feet, funny and got right to
the point. He was a spellbinding
teacher."
"He was a legendary teacher,"
said Weisberg, a former student
of Kaplan. "He was known for a
crackling wit and a boisterous
sense of humor."
In one of his best-known books,
"The Hardest Drug: Heroin and
Public Policy," Kaplan wrote that
present drug policies "are about
as good as we're going to get. . . .
Heroin maintenence won't work
and free availability would be even
worse." He noted, however, that
"increased Jaw enforcement may
not prove very cost-effective. You
could send two prisoners to Stan
ford for the cost of sending one
to prison."
Among Kaplan's other works
was a 1972 textbook, "Criminal

Justice," that was adopted at
more than 100 colleges nationally.
According to his wife, Elizabeth
Kaplan, John Kaplan underwent
a revolutionary experimental
therapy to treat the brain tumor
that eventually killed him. Work
ing with Dr. Frances Conley of
the Medical Center and Dr. Ray
Miller of the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic, Kaplan was infected with
a killed bacterium, called C par
vum. The bacterium, in conjunc
tion with other chemicals, helped
stimulate Kaplan's immune sys
tem to fight off the cancerous
cells.
In studies of the experimental
treatment done on mice, there was
an almost 80 percent elimination
of brain tumors. However,
Kaplan's tumor was a different
type of cancer than the ones
studied in mice.

Elizabeth Kaplan said while the
tumor suffered by her husband
was not eliminated by the treat
ment, his life was prolonged by
several months.
Weisberg said Kaplan was "very
aggressive in trying to conquer
the illness." He added that
Kaplan's motives for undergoing
the experimental treatment came
from a "selfless interest in seeing
whether this therapy might
work."
Kaplan held two degrees from
Harvard University, an bachelor's
in physics and a law degree magna
cum laude. Before joining the
Stanford law faculty, Kaplan
served as a federal prosecutor, a
Hudson Institute research analyst
and a law professor at Northwest
ern University and UC-Berkeley.
He is survived by his wife,
mother and three children.
