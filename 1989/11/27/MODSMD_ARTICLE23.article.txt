And the Walls Came Tumbling Down:
An Autobiography
By the Rev. Ralph David Abemathy
Harper & Row, $25.00
Reviewed by Pete Holloran
In the introduction to "And the Walls
Came Tumbling Down," the Rev. Ralph
David Abernathy likens his memoir of
the civil rights movement to Stephen
Crane's civil war novel "Red Badge of
Courage" — "a narrative of how it felt
rather than of everything that hap
pened."
It is an ironic comparison: Crane wrote
his realistic masterpiece without ever
being on the battlefield, whereas Aber
nathy knows from firsthand experience
"how it felt" to campaign for civil rights
beside Martin Luther King, Jr. From the
bus boycott to the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference's massive cam
paigns, from Montgomery's city jail to
Birmingham's, Abernathy was there: "no
one else experienced it all, so no one else
can really tell the whole story from the
viewpoint of an eyewitness."
Sadly, "And the Walls Came Tumbling
Down: An Autobiography" evokes neither
the "whole story" nor the experiences of
the "eyewitness." The book is instead a
minutely detailed and richly decorated
account... of Abernathy's ego and his
centrality to the movement. We find Aber
nathy pompously remembering "when we
were all younger and hadn't taken on
the burdens of the black people." And,
most disappointingly, we see Martin Lu
ther King, Jr. only when he turns, tear
fully, to Abernathy for advice and sup
port.
For all of Abernathy's personal ac
complishments, he is most widely known
as King's closest associate; indeed, even
after the assassination of King, their close
relationship dominated — Abernathy had
the unenviable role of being King's ap
pointed "successor." The events of the
first night of the Montgomery bus
boycott in 1955 illustrate the relationship
King and Abernathy maintained over the
years. King preached a rousing and elo
quent sermon, while Abernathy delivered
some comments and read the demands
of the boycotters. The pattern repeated
itself: Abernathy was a gifted and

humorous speaker, but King became the
keynote speaker wherever they went.
But Abernathy accompanied him
nearly everywhere, and for this reason,
Abernathy's memoirs held tremendous
promise for those interested in Martin
Luther King Jr. What a portrait of King
he should be able to sketch: rich in pathos,
resplendent in detail, respectful in its
faith to King's vision. Abernathy could
bring a breath of humanity to King's
stature, enormous in life and mythic with
death.
However, "And the Walls Came Tum
bling Down" presents the least subtle
portrait of King yet, painted with large
strokes across a muddy canvas. Motiva
tions, deep and spiritual, turn splotchy,
even sordid, in Abernathy's narrative.
For instance, when King moved to At
lanta to share Ebenezer Baptist Church's
pulpit with his father, Abernathy re
mained in Montgomery. We learn from
Abernathy only that King felt "a deep
sense of loss" due to their separation and
that "for Martin, my coming to Atlanta
was an important ingredient in his life."

Frequently the only detail
given is King's reliance on
Abernathy for support and
advice.

Also, King's views on poverty underwent
considerable change during the last five
years of his life; Abernathy facilely ex
plains that King saw impoverished and
malnourished children for the first time
in early 1968 and decided that "we've
got to do something for them."
King's actions and reactions, emotions
and decisions, are rendered with little
depth, and frequently the only detail
given is King's reliance on Abernathy for
support and advice.
Other figures and events suffer from
a similar stinginess of detail. The Albany
Movement, a broad-based organization
led by community activists associated
with the Student Nonviolent Coordinat
ing Committee, is pictured as a "mess"
for Abernathy (and King) to fix, at the
request of one of Abernathy's college
schoolmates.

'That Sunday I went to hear him (Martin Luther
King Jr.) and he was indeed impressive. He was
about my age, but already he had begun to build a
reputation in a city the size of Atlanta. So I sat there
burning with envy at his learning and confidence.
Already he was a scholar; and while he didn't holler
as loud as some of the more famous preachers I had
heard, he could holler loud enough when he wanted.'

Abernathy's unsubtle approach often
errs by omission as well, and he is silent
on an extraordinary number of events
and issues. He does not deign to mention
the student sit-ins of 1960, the freedom
rides of 1963 or King's Nobel Peace Prize
of 1964. Even John F. Kennedy's death
does not impinge on Abernathy's presen
tation of events. .
Imprecision, omission, egotism — these
do not sell a book. The tremendous at
tention and controversy that this book
has earned stems from very few pages,
that seem to have been inserted almost
as an afterthought. A look at the index
reveals: "Martin Luther King; as a
womanizer, 470-75." Those
searching for tabloid tales should search
elsewhere; Abernathy hints in mild lan
guage that something must have hap
pened, on one occasion. The momentous
nature of that occasion — the night
before the assassination — appears tail
ored toward headlines and newsbites.
Regardless of the truth of Abernathy's
assertions (and many doubt their
veracity, including Andrew Young and
Jesse Jackson), their presence adds noth
ing to Abernathy's portrait of King, save
hypocrisy. The index should also list the
many pages on which Abernathy boasts
of his dalliances: at the time of his en
gagement he was seeing three different
women.
In a telling phrase, Abernathy writes:
"I think I can make some attempt to
render justice to the dead without causing
too much unnecessary pain to the living."
His discussion allows little justice and
too much pain. The pain is a public one,
for the controversy over King's alleged

sexual affairs is a headline-making topic.
Some of the blame for this must go to
the media who discovered this aspect of
the book (with some help from the pub
lisher?) and ran with it.
The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy that
emerges from his own book is not very
flattering. At times Abernathy seems to
have treated the ministry as a sinecure,
and we wonder if status held more appeal
than religion: "Of course, from the time
I knew my name I also knew I was going
to be a preacher. The preacher, after all,
was the finest and most important person
around, someone who was accorded re
spect wherever he went."
Also troubling is the continual reliance
on military imagery, particularly in the
autobiography of an apostle of non
violence. Abernathy's career in the army
helps explain the imagery, but the metap
hors are overpowering and persistent, en
listed without irony. Nearly every page
contains a war image: talk of battles won,
regiments to be committed to the front,
sentries and security patrols. "In effect,
we had driven him from his own citadel,
forcing him to vacate the seat of govern
ment. Had he come out, received our
petition, and behaved in a gracious man
ner, he might have salvaged some dignity
for himself and his cause. As it stood,
our triumph over him was complete, and
we left the square in a state of joyous
vindication, certain that we had won a
great victory."
Abernathy's style is clearly suited for
oral presentation, and loses some of its
style and humour during the transfer to
prose. Six cassettes of his tales would
attempt less and accomplish more than

these 600 pages. Abernathy's humour and
ability with a crowd is well-known, and
this book captures little of it. Committed
to paper, his words acquire sometimes
unbearable weight, burdened with ego
and without lightness. Some well-phrased
questions might help the Rev. Aber
nathy's charm, wit and experience come
through — one can only wait for Bill
Moyers to interview him.
I yearn for more. Although several ex
cellent movement autobiographies exist,
I still wait for the story to capture the
spirit of the times, to evoke the spirits
of the participants, and to unravel the
narrative. Perhaps it is too much to ask
for someone to weave two decades into
several hundred pages, but Abernathy's
tells a story all too recent: kiss-and-tell,
or rather sell. It also tells an ancient one.
If egotism is the peculiar pride (and price)
of autobiography, we nevertheless expect
less radiated "I" than that offered in
Abernathy's gigantic, all-consuming tale.
Emerson noted that every man and
woman has a great autobiography to tell,
if only she understood how it is unique.
Clearly, in Abernathy's life uniqueness
abounds. We must demand then that it
be told well.

Other figures and events suffer from
a similar stinginess of detail. The Albany
Movement, a broad-based organization
led by community activists associated
with the Student Nonviolent Coordinat
ing Committee, is pictured as a "mess"
for Abernathy (and King) to fix, at the
request of one of Abernathy's college
schoolmates.

'That Sunday I went to hear him (Martin Luther
King Jr.) and he was indeed impressive. He was
about my age, but already he had begun to build a
reputation in a city the size of Atlanta. So I sat there
burning with envy at his learning and confidence.
Already he was a scholar; and while he didn't holler
as loud as some of the more famous preachers I had
heard, he could holler loud enough when he wanted.'

Abernathy's unsubtle approach often
errs by omission as well, and he is silent
on an extraordinary number of events
and issues. He does not deign to mention
the student sit-ins of 1960, the freedom
rides of 1963 or King's Nobel Peace Prize
of 1964. Even John F. Kennedy's death
does not impinge on Abernathy's presen
tation of events. .
Imprecision, omission, egotism — these
do not sell a book. The tremendous at
tention and controversy that this book
has earned stems from very few pages,
that seem to have been inserted almost
as an afterthought. A look at the index
reveals: "Martin Luther King; as a
womanizer, 470-75." Those
searching for tabloid tales should search
elsewhere; Abernathy hints in mild lan
guage that something must have hap
pened, on one occasion. The momentous
nature of that occasion — the night
before the assassination — appears tail
ored toward headlines and newsbites.
Regardless of the truth of Abernathy's
assertions (and many doubt their
veracity, including Andrew Young and
Jesse Jackson), their presence adds noth
ing to Abernathy's portrait of King, save
hypocrisy. The index should also list the
many pages on which Abernathy boasts
of his dalliances: at the time of his en
gagement he was seeing three different
women.
In a telling phrase, Abernathy writes:
"I think I can make some attempt to
render justice to the dead without causing
too much unnecessary pain to the living."
His discussion allows little justice and
too much pain. The pain is a public one,
for the controversy over King's alleged

sexual affairs is a headline-making topic.
Some of the blame for this must go to
the media who discovered this aspect of
the book (with some help from the pub
lisher?) and ran with it.
The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy that
emerges from his own book is not very
flattering. At times Abernathy seems to
have treated the ministry as a sinecure,
and we wonder if status held more appeal
than religion: "Of course, from the time
I knew my name I also knew I was going
to be a preacher. The preacher, after all,
was the finest and most important person
around, someone who was accorded re
spect wherever he went."
Also troubling is the continual reliance
on military imagery, particularly in the
autobiography of an apostle of non
violence. Abernathy's career in the army
helps explain the imagery, but the metap
hors are overpowering and persistent, en
listed without irony. Nearly every page
contains a war image: talk of battles won,
regiments to be committed to the front,
sentries and security patrols. "In effect,
we had driven him from his own citadel,
forcing him to vacate the seat of govern
ment. Had he come out, received our
petition, and behaved in a gracious man
ner, he might have salvaged some dignity
for himself and his cause. As it stood,
our triumph over him was complete, and
we left the square in a state of joyous
vindication, certain that we had won a
great victory."
Abernathy's style is clearly suited for
oral presentation, and loses some of its
style and humour during the transfer to
prose. Six cassettes of his tales would
attempt less and accomplish more than

these 600 pages. Abernathy's humour and
ability with a crowd is well-known, and
this book captures little of it. Committed
to paper, his words acquire sometimes
unbearable weight, burdened with ego
and without lightness. Some well-phrased
questions might help the Rev. Aber
nathy's charm, wit and experience come
through — one can only wait for Bill
Moyers to interview him.
I yearn for more. Although several ex
cellent movement autobiographies exist,
I still wait for the story to capture the
spirit of the times, to evoke the spirits
of the participants, and to unravel the
narrative. Perhaps it is too much to ask
for someone to weave two decades into
several hundred pages, but Abernathy's
tells a story all too recent: kiss-and-tell,
or rather sell. It also tells an ancient one.
If egotism is the peculiar pride (and price)
of autobiography, we nevertheless expect
less radiated "I" than that offered in
Abernathy's gigantic, all-consuming tale.
Emerson noted that every man and
woman has a great autobiography to tell,
if only she understood how it is unique.
Clearly, in Abernathy's life uniqueness
abounds. We must demand then that it
be told well.

And the Walls Came Tumbling Down:
An Autobiography
By the Rev. Ralph David Abemathy
Harper & Row, $25.00
Reviewed by Pete Holloran
In the introduction to "And the Walls
Came Tumbling Down," the Rev. Ralph
David Abernathy likens his memoir of
the civil rights movement to Stephen
Crane's civil war novel "Red Badge of
Courage" — "a narrative of how it felt
rather than of everything that hap
pened."
It is an ironic comparison: Crane wrote
his realistic masterpiece without ever
being on the battlefield, whereas Aber
nathy knows from firsthand experience
"how it felt" to campaign for civil rights
beside Martin Luther King, Jr. From the
bus boycott to the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference's massive cam
paigns, from Montgomery's city jail to
Birmingham's, Abernathy was there: "no
one else experienced it all, so no one else
can really tell the whole story from the
viewpoint of an eyewitness."
Sadly, "And the Walls Came Tumbling
Down: An Autobiography" evokes neither
the "whole story" nor the experiences of
the "eyewitness." The book is instead a
minutely detailed and richly decorated
account... of Abernathy's ego and his
centrality to the movement. We find Aber
nathy pompously remembering "when we
were all younger and hadn't taken on
the burdens of the black people." And,
most disappointingly, we see Martin Lu
ther King, Jr. only when he turns, tear
fully, to Abernathy for advice and sup
port.
For all of Abernathy's personal ac
complishments, he is most widely known
as King's closest associate; indeed, even
after the assassination of King, their close
relationship dominated — Abernathy had
the unenviable role of being King's ap
pointed "successor." The events of the
first night of the Montgomery bus
boycott in 1955 illustrate the relationship
King and Abernathy maintained over the
years. King preached a rousing and elo
quent sermon, while Abernathy delivered
some comments and read the demands
of the boycotters. The pattern repeated
itself: Abernathy was a gifted and

humorous speaker, but King became the
keynote speaker wherever they went.
But Abernathy accompanied him
nearly everywhere, and for this reason,
Abernathy's memoirs held tremendous
promise for those interested in Martin
Luther King Jr. What a portrait of King
he should be able to sketch: rich in pathos,
resplendent in detail, respectful in its
faith to King's vision. Abernathy could
bring a breath of humanity to King's
stature, enormous in life and mythic with
death.
However, "And the Walls Came Tum
bling Down" presents the least subtle
portrait of King yet, painted with large
strokes across a muddy canvas. Motiva
tions, deep and spiritual, turn splotchy,
even sordid, in Abernathy's narrative.
For instance, when King moved to At
lanta to share Ebenezer Baptist Church's
pulpit with his father, Abernathy re
mained in Montgomery. We learn from
Abernathy only that King felt "a deep
sense of loss" due to their separation and
that "for Martin, my coming to Atlanta
was an important ingredient in his life."

Frequently the only detail
given is King's reliance on
Abernathy for support and
advice.

Also, King's views on poverty underwent
considerable change during the last five
years of his life; Abernathy facilely ex
plains that King saw impoverished and
malnourished children for the first time
in early 1968 and decided that "we've
got to do something for them."
King's actions and reactions, emotions
and decisions, are rendered with little
depth, and frequently the only detail
given is King's reliance on Abernathy for
support and advice.
Other figures and events suffer from
a similar stinginess of detail. The Albany
Movement, a broad-based organization

vindication, certain that we had won a
great victory."
Abernathy's style is clearly suited for
oral presentation, and loses some of its
style and humour during the transfer to
prose. Six cassettes of his tales would
attempt less and accomplish more than

these 600 pages. Abernathy's humour and
ability with a crowd is well-known, and
this book captures little of it. Committed
to paper, his words acquire sometimes
unbearable weight, burdened with ego
and without lightness. Some well-phrased
questions might help the Rev. Aber
nathy's charm, wit and experience come
through — one can only wait for Bill
Moyers to interview him.
I yearn for more. Although several ex
cellent movement autobiographies exist,
I still wait for the story to capture the
spirit of the times, to evoke the spirits
of the participants, and to unravel the
narrative. Perhaps it is too much to ask
for someone to weave two decades into
several hundred pages, but Abernathy's
tells a story all too recent: kiss-and-tell,
or rather sell. It also tells an ancient one.
If egotism is the peculiar pride (and price)
of autobiography, we nevertheless expect
less radiated "I" than that offered in
Abernathy's gigantic, all-consuming tale.
Emerson noted that every man and
woman has a great autobiography to tell,
if only she understood how it is unique.
Clearly, in Abernathy's life uniqueness
abounds. We must demand then that it
be told well.

And the Walls Came Tumbling Down:
An Autobiography
By the Rev. Ralph David Abemathy
Harper & Row, $25.00
Reviewed by Pete Holloran
In the introduction to "And the Walls
Came Tumbling Down," the Rev. Ralph
David Abernathy likens his memoir of
the civil rights movement to Stephen
Crane's civil war novel "Red Badge of
Courage" — "a narrative of how it felt
rather than of everything that hap
pened."
It is an ironic comparison: Crane wrote
his realistic masterpiece without ever
being on the battlefield, whereas Aber
nathy knows from firsthand experience
"how it felt" to campaign for civil rights
beside Martin Luther King, Jr. From the
bus boycott to the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference's massive cam
paigns, from Montgomery's city jail to
Birmingham's, Abernathy was there: "no
one else experienced it all, so no one else
can really tell the whole story from the
viewpoint of an eyewitness."
Sadly, "And the Walls Came Tumbling
Down: An Autobiography" evokes neither
the "whole story" nor the experiences of
the "eyewitness." The book is instead a
minutely detailed and richly decorated
account... of Abernathy's ego and his
centrality to the movement. We find Aber
nathy pompously remembering "when we
were all younger and hadn't taken on
the burdens of the black people." And,
most disappointingly, we see Martin Lu
ther King, Jr. only when he turns, tear
fully, to Abernathy for advice and sup
port.
For all of Abernathy's personal ac
complishments, he is most widely known
as King's closest associate; indeed, even
after the assassination of King, their close
relationship dominated — Abernathy had
the unenviable role of being King's ap
pointed "successor." The events of the
first night of the Montgomery bus
boycott in 1955 illustrate the relationship
King and Abernathy maintained over the
years. King preached a rousing and elo
quent sermon, while Abernathy delivered
some comments and read the demands
of the boycotters. The pattern repeated
itself: Abernathy was a gifted and

humorous speaker, but King became the
keynote speaker wherever they went.
But Abernathy accompanied him
nearly everywhere, and for this reason,
Abernathy's memoirs held tremendous
promise for those interested in Martin
Luther King Jr. What a portrait of King
he should be able to sketch: rich in pathos,
resplendent in detail, respectful in its
faith to King's vision. Abernathy could
bring a breath of humanity to King's
stature, enormous in life and mythic with
death.
However, "And the Walls Came Tum
bling Down" presents the least subtle
portrait of King yet, painted with large
strokes across a muddy canvas. Motiva
tions, deep and spiritual, turn splotchy,
even sordid, in Abernathy's narrative.
For instance, when King moved to At
lanta to share Ebenezer Baptist Church's
pulpit with his father, Abernathy re
mained in Montgomery. We learn from
Abernathy only that King felt "a deep
sense of loss" due to their separation and
that "for Martin, my coming to Atlanta
was an important ingredient in his life."

Frequently the only detail
given is King's reliance on
Abernathy for support and
advice.

Also, King's views on poverty underwent
considerable change during the last five
years of his life; Abernathy facilely ex
plains that King saw impoverished and
malnourished children for the first time
in early 1968 and decided that "we've
got to do something for them."
King's actions and reactions, emotions
and decisions, are rendered with little
depth, and frequently the only detail
given is King's reliance on Abernathy for
support and advice.
Other figures and events suffer from
a similar stinginess of detail. The Albany
Movement, a broad-based organization
led by community activists associated
with the Student Nonviolent Coordinat
ing Committee, is pictured as a "mess"
for Abernathy (and King) to fix, at the
request of one of Abernathy's college
schoolmates.

'That Sunday I went to hear him (Martin Luther
King Jr.) and he was indeed impressive. He was
about my age, but already he had begun to build a
reputation in a city the size of Atlanta. So I sat there
burning with envy at his learning and confidence.
Already he was a scholar; and while he didn't holler
as loud as some of the more famous preachers I had
heard, he could holler loud enough when he wanted.'

Abernathy's unsubtle approach often
errs by omission as well, and he is silent
on an extraordinary number of events
and issues. He does not deign to mention
the student sit-ins of 1960, the freedom
rides of 1963 or King's Nobel Peace Prize
of 1964. Even John F. Kennedy's death
does not impinge on Abernathy's presen
tation of events. .
Imprecision, omission, egotism — these
do not sell a book. The tremendous at
tention and controversy that this book
has earned stems from very few pages,
that seem to have been inserted almost
as an afterthought. A look at the index
reveals: "Martin Luther King; as a
womanizer, 470-75." Those
searching for tabloid tales should search
elsewhere; Abernathy hints in mild lan
guage that something must have hap
pened, on one occasion. The momentous
nature of that occasion — the night
before the assassination — appears tail
ored toward headlines and newsbites.
Regardless of the truth of Abernathy's
assertions (and many doubt their
veracity, including Andrew Young and
Jesse Jackson), their presence adds noth
ing to Abernathy's portrait of King, save
hypocrisy. The index should also list the
many pages on which Abernathy boasts
of his dalliances: at the time of his en
gagement he was seeing three different
women.
In a telling phrase, Abernathy writes:
"I think I can make some attempt to
render justice to the dead without causing
too much unnecessary pain to the living."
His discussion allows little justice and
too much pain. The pain is a public one,
for the controversy over King's alleged

sexual affairs is a headline-making topic.
Some of the blame for this must go to
the media who discovered this aspect of
the book (with some help from the pub
lisher?) and ran with it.
The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy that
emerges from his own book is not very
flattering. At times Abernathy seems to
have treated the ministry as a sinecure,
and we wonder if status held more appeal
than religion: "Of course, from the time
I knew my name I also knew I was going
to be a preacher. The preacher, after all,
was the finest and most important person
around, someone who was accorded re
spect wherever he went."
Also troubling is the continual reliance
on military imagery, particularly in the
autobiography of an apostle of non
violence. Abernathy's career in the army
helps explain the imagery, but the metap
hors are overpowering and persistent, en
listed without irony. Nearly every page
contains a war image: talk of battles won,
regiments to be committed to the front,
sentries and security patrols. "In effect,
we had driven him from his own citadel,
forcing him to vacate the seat of govern
ment. Had he come out, received our
petition, and behaved in a gracious man
ner, he might have salvaged some dignity
for himself and his cause. As it stood,
our triumph over him was complete, and
we left the square in a state of joyous
vindication, certain that we had won a
great victory."
Abernathy's style is clearly suited for
oral presentation, and loses some of its
style and humour during the transfer to
prose. Six cassettes of his tales would
attempt less and accomplish more than

these 600 pages. Abernathy's humour and
ability with a crowd is well-known, and
this book captures little of it. Committed
to paper, his words acquire sometimes
unbearable weight, burdened with ego
and without lightness. Some well-phrased
questions might help the Rev. Aber
nathy's charm, wit and experience come
through — one can only wait for Bill
Moyers to interview him.
I yearn for more. Although several ex
cellent movement autobiographies exist,
I still wait for the story to capture the

Clearly, in Abernathy's life uniqueness
abounds. We must demand then that it
be told well.
