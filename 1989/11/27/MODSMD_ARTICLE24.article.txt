### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The wave the Stanford water polo team
rode into the playoffs met a jagged coral
reef Saturday as UC-Irvine snagged the
Cardinal 8-7 in the semifinals of the NCAA
Championships.
Stanford, riding a crest after beating top
ranked California in the season finale, was
ready for the NCAAs. But so was everyone
else.

Stanford third in NCAAs

The Cardinal's bid for a seventh national
water polo title fell one game and goal
short at the Natatorium in Indianapolis,
as No. 2 Irvine (26-6) sank the Cardinal
in the second round.
Stanford vented its frustrations yester
day, smashing Pepperdine 7-5 to claim
third place in the tournament. The third
place finish is Stanford's highest since the
undefeated NCAA title team of 1986.
Pepperdine (26-7), the fourth seed, was
the only NCAA tournament team the Car
dinal had not defeated in 1989. Powered
by goalie Todd Kemp's tournament-high 12
saves, Stanford rode easily by the Waves.
Stanford, seeded third in the NCAAs
after placing second in the Pacific 10 Con

ference behind California, finishes the
season 28-8.
Cal (26-3), the defending champion,
played Irvine last night for the title.
Coach Dante Dettamanti's squad
rebounded from a 2-0 deficit to edge first
round opponent UC-San Diego 7-6 on Fri
day night, but the Cardinal could not repeat
the act Saturday, falling behind 2-0 early
before losing to the Anteaters.
After trailing Irvine 2-0, Stanford recov
ered to tie the Anteaters at 6-all, but the
comeback ended there as Irvine advanced
to its ninth tournament final.
"We got behind early and spent a lot of
energy catching up," said Dettamenti.
"After we got to 6-all, we didn't take ad
vantage of the situation."
Stanford had the momentum, but Irvine
had Tom Warde. Warde, who plays on the
national team, scored five goals against
Stanford, including a go-ahead shot to make
the score 7-6 Irvine in the final period.
John Redd buried his first and only shot
of the day with 2 minutes and 40 seconds
left to secure the victory. His shot glanced
off JefT Oeding's arm just enough to trip
up goalie Todd Kemp.
Oeding scored his third goal of the game
on a 4-meter penalty shot to make the
score 8-7, but only 38 seconds were left.
The season was over.
"Redd's shot really killed us," said Det
tamanti. "It was the only one he took all
night. We gave him the shot because he's
not one of their big guns."
Stanford had enough trouble with its

The Cardinal water polo squad rounded out the 1989 campaign this weekend with a third-place finish at the NCAA
Championships in Indianapolis. Stanford's finish is its best since 1986 when the Cardinal wore the NCAA crown.
own offensive guns. Though
Oeding scored three and Jon
Swerdloff found the mark twice,
the Cardinal could not get on
track offensively.
Stanford was 4-for-4 in man
advantage opportunities, but suf
fered 7-for-30 shooting against a
tough Irvine press defense.
"Their all-out press hurt us,"
senior Steve Millham said. "We
had trouble getting it into the
holeman."
Defensively, Stanford knew the
threat Warde presented, but could
do little to slow him down as he
shredded the Cardinal for five
scores.
"In the games where we have
played a star player, we have won
when we hold him to a couple
goals," Millham said. "But we let
Warde score five goals and we
can't let that happen."
Irvine grabbed the early advan
tage, scoring just 25 seconds into
the game. The Cardinal trailed
until four minutes remained, but
the quick Anteater start left Stan
ford mouths hanging open.
"Their score on the first pos
session surprised [goalie] Todd
Kemp and surprised all of us,"
said Millham.
Irvine kept up the blitzkrieg as
sault, shooting to a 2-0 lead before
Stanford awoke on goals by Mil
lham and Swerdloff.
Millham scored aga n in the
first half, but two tallies by Warde
— including one with just 25
seconds left in the half — put the
Anteaters ahead 5-3 at halftime.

Stanford led the shooting 13-8,
but still could not take the lead.
Warde started the second stanza
with his fourth goal before Stan
ford — trailing by three goals —
began its surge.
Oeding scored during a man
advantage situation to start the
recovery, but Stanford never held
a lead in the game.
Stanford had split two previous
games with Irvine in 1989, but
the Anteaters — who had slumped
recently — were back on track in
the NCAAs.
Friday night Stanford cruised
to a 7-6 victory over No. 6 UC-San
Diego in a game that was closer
than it should have been. Stanford
clobbered the Tritons (20-13) by
an 11-6 margin earlier this year.
Yesterday against the Waves
Stanford jumped out to a 1-0 lead
on a man-advantage score by
Swerdloff, but the Waves rolled
back for a 2-1 first-quarter lead.
Keyed by the the play of Kemp,
the best goalie in the Pac-10, Stan
ford then held Pepperdine to just
one goal in the next 11 minutes.
At the start of the fourth period
the Cardinal exploded on a four
goal blitz in just four minutes,
knocking the wind out of the
Waves.
Junior Rick McNair launched
the barrage, scoring on a coun
terattack goal just 30 seconds into
the final quarter. He then scored
again on a lob shot to increase
the Cardinal lead to 6-3.
Greg Olson tallied the final
points of the year for Stanford,
intercepting a Pepperdine pass
and driving the length of the pool
for the score.
