### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The wave the Stanford water polo team
rode into the playoffs met a jagged coral
reef Saturday as UC-Irvine snagged the
Cardinal 8-7 in the semifinals of the NCAA
Championships.
Stanford, riding a crest after beating top
ranked California in the season finale, was
ready for the NCAAs. But so was everyone
else.

Stanford third in NCAAs

The Cardinal's bid for a seventh national
water polo title fell one game and goal
short at the Natatorium in Indianapolis,
as No. 2 Irvine (26-6) sank the Cardinal
in the second round.
Stanford vented its frustrations yester
day, smashing Pepperdine 7-5 to claim
third place in the tournament. The third
place finish is Stanford's highest since the
undefeated NCAA title team of 1986.
Pepperdine (26-7), the fourth seed, was
the only NCAA tournament team the Car
dinal had not defeated in 1989. Powered
by goalie Todd Kemp's tournament-high 12
saves, Stanford rode easily by the Waves.
Stanford, seeded third in the NCAAs
after placing second in the Pacific 10 Con

ference behind California, finishes the
season 28-8.
Cal (26-3), the defending champion,
played Irvine last night for the title.
Coach Dante Dettamanti's squad
rebounded from a 2-0 deficit to edge first
round opponent UC-San Diego 7-6 on Fri
day night, but the Cardinal could not repeat
the act Saturday, falling behind 2-0 early
before losing to the Anteaters.
After trailing Irvine 2-0, Stanford recov
ered to tie the Anteaters at 6-all, but the
comeback ended there as Irvine advanced
to its ninth tournament final.
"We got behind early and spent a lot of
energy catching up," said Dettamenti.
"After we got to 6-all, we didn't take ad
vantage of the situation."
Stanford had the momentum, but Irvine
had Tom Warde. Warde, who plays on the
national team, scored five goals against
Stanford, including a go-ahead shot to make
the score 7-6 Irvine in the final period.
John Redd buried his first and only shot
of the day with 2 minutes and 40 seconds
left to secure the victory. His shot glanced
off JefT Oeding's arm just enough to trip
up goalie Todd Kemp.
Oeding scored his third goal of the game
on a 4-meter penalty shot to make the
score 8-7, but only 38 seconds were left.
The season was over.
"Redd's shot really killed us," said Det
tamanti. "It was the only one he took all
night. We gave him the shot because he's
not one of their big guns."

Championships in Indianapolis. Stanford's finish is its best since 1986 when the Cardinal wore the NCAA crown.
