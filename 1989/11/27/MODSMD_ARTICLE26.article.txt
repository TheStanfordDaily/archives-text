# Lichti-less Card licks Cal-Poly
## Wingate tallies 10 rebounds, 14 points in blowout victory 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
After opening the season with
a 32-point win, the Stanford bas
ketball team knows one thing.
Not every game will be that
easy.
The Cardinal beat Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo 88-56 at Maples Pa
vilion Friday night in the season
opener for both schools. But while
beating a Division II school is
nothing to crow about, the fact
that a young Cardinal team was
able to dominate is a good sign.

Mustangs 56 •

With eight freshmen on the
team, Stanford won't be as good
as last year. But the team showed
signs Friday that the drop-off
might not be as big as some had
feared.
"I think we're coming along real
well," forward Adam Keefe said
after he scored 21 points and had
nine rebounds. "I've played
against some of these guys before
and they're not that bad. I was
happy with how badly we beat
them. That's a great win for us. n
In addition to Keefe, forwards
Andrew Vlahov and Deshon Win
gate also had big nights. Vlahov
had 13 of Stanford's first 19
points and Wingate had 14 points
while again leading the Cardinal
in rebounding. Wingate had 25
boards in two exhibition games
and pulled down 10 against the
Mustangs.
Stanford will have a better
standard against which to judge
itself tonight when the team plays
at UC-Irvine. The Anteaters have
three starters back from the team
which beat both UNLV and UCLA
last year.
"It'll be a really good ballgame
for us," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We're going to
have to play as well as we know
how to play to beat Irvine."
The game will be a homecoming
for Keefe, who is from Irvine.
"That'll be real nice for me," he
said. "If you have a chance to play

I've played against
some of these guys
before, and they're
not that bad. I was
happy with how badly
we beat them. That's
a great win for us.'

with your parents watching, what
can be better than that?"
The Cardinal started slowly
against the Mustangs, perhaps
due to the nervousness on the
team's first game. But with the
score 7-7, Stanford went on an
18-4 run with Vlahov scoring eight
points and guard John Patrick hit
ting consecutive three-pointers.
Keefe scored 10 in the last six
minutes, eight seconds of the half
and Stanford pulled out to a 43-22
halftime lead. The Anteaters
never got closer than 19 in the

second half.
"1 think our strong point was
that we were able to get on top
of them early," Vlahov said. "It
made then nervous instead of us."
Stanford's guard play, a definite
question mark before the season
began, was a pleasant surprise.
All six of the Cardinal's guards
played and they combined for 13-
of-23 shooting and 30 points.
Walk-on Mike Morris was espe
cially impressive, scoring seven
points including a trey in seven
minutes.
"I think this helped us," Mont
gomery said. "It got us some con
fidence. Next time we go out on
the floor we should be that much
better."
