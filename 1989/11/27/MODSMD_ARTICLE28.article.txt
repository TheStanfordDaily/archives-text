# Cagers win Hall of Fame
## Third-ranked women obliterate Ohio University for title 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Pity Ohio University. The
Bobcat women's basketball team
had the misfortune of facing the
Cardinal one night after the na
tion's third-ranked team was
disappointed with the way it had
played.
The Cardinal took out its frus
tration on Ohio and the result
was a 113-65 shellacking in the
championship game of the Com
muniplex National Hall of Fame
Classic in Cincinnati Saturday
night.
In Friday's first-round
matchup Stanford won its

Women's Basketball

Cardinal 73, Spartans 63 \
Cardinal 113, Bobcats 65

season opener over Michigan
State by a too-close-for-comfort
73-63 margin. The Cardinal's
record now stands at 2-0 and
the team is idle until the home
season kicks off Dec. 10 with a
game against San Diego State
in Maples Pavilion.
Saturday's contest was as
clear a mismatch as the score
indicated. Six Stanford players
scored in doubles figures led by
Trisha Stevens with 20 points.

Stevens also pulled down a
game-high 10 rebounds to
record the double-double.
Coach Tar a VanDerveer said
she "was especially pleased with
the defensive effort" Saturday.
She praised Stevens' job guard
ing the Bobcats Dawn
Heideman, who had gone off for
29 points the night before
against Cincinnati. Heideman
scored only 11 against the Car
dinal.
Stanford took the lead at 5-4
on a three-pointer by Jennifer
Azzi two minutes into the game
and never looked back. Ahead
