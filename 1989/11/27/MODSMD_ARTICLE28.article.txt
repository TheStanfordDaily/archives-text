# Cagers win Hall of Fame
## Third-ranked women obliterate Ohio University for title 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Pity Ohio University. The
Bobcat women's basketball team
had the misfortune of facing the
Cardinal one night after the na
tion's third-ranked team was
disappointed with the way it had
played.
The Cardinal took out its frus
tration on Ohio and the result
was a 113-65 shellacking in the
championship game of the Com
muniplex National Hall of Fame
Classic in Cincinnati Saturday
night.
In Friday's first-round
matchup Stanford won its

Women's Basketball

Cardinal 73, Spartans 63 \
Cardinal 113, Bobcats 65

season opener over Michigan
State by a too-close-for-comfort
73-63 margin. The Cardinal's
record now stands at 2-0 and
the team is idle until the home
season kicks off Dec. 10 with a
game against San Diego State
in Maples Pavilion.
Saturday's contest was as
clear a mismatch as the score
indicated. Six Stanford players
scored in doubles figures led by
Trisha Stevens with 20 points.

Stevens also pulled down a
game-high 10 rebounds to
record the double-double.
Coach Tar a VanDerveer said
she "was especially pleased with
the defensive effort" Saturday.
She praised Stevens' job guard
ing the Bobcats Dawn
Heideman, who had gone off for
29 points the night before
against Cincinnati. Heideman
scored only 11 against the Car
dinal.
Stanford took the lead at 5-4
on a three-pointer by Jennifer
Azzi two minutes into the game
and never looked back. Ahead
11-10, the Cardinal went on a 16-2
run with six different players scor
ing in that span. By halftime, the
score was 56-35.
The Bobcats scored the first
four points of the second stanza
in what would be their last charge.
Stanford pushed the lead to 50
at 113-63 with 1:10 left to play.
It was the Cardinal's sixth 100-
point effort in its last 10 games
dating back to the end of last year.
Things didn't go nearly as well
for Stanford Friday. Though the
team was never seriously in dan
ger of losing, VanDerveer was less
than thrilled with the Cardinal's
performance.
"The facility was freezing cold,"
she said of the temperature in
the Riverfront Coliseum, adding,
"We were freezing cold, too." On
ihe night, Stanford was 28 of 68
from the field, a 41 percent clip.
Actually, the Cardinal heated
up quickly as the team took a
15-4 lead over the Spartans in
the first four minutes. Twice
Stanford opened 13-point leads in
cluding a 34-21 bulge with 2:30
remaining in the first half.
At the intermission the Cardi
nal led 39-29. Michigan State
scored the first six points of the
second half to pull close at 39-35
but never got any closer. Stanford
outscored the Spartans 21-13 over
the next seven minutes to open
up its largest lead of the game at
60-42.
With 2:30 left to play the Car
dinal was up by 16. Michigan
State then poured in six un

answered points. When it was
over, Stanford had a 73-63 vic
tory.
"The best thing was, we shot
10 threes," VanDerveer noted. De
spite poor shooting overall, Stan
ford was an impressive 10-of-22
from outside the arc. Those 10
treys tied the Pacific 10 Confer
ence record and set a school
record.
Azzi had a game-high 20 points
and Katy Steding chipped in 18.
Each tied personal bests with four
three-pointers.
"Personally, I was disappointed
with our intensity and effort,"
VanDerveer said, noting that the
smaller, quicker Spartans out
rebounded the Cardinal 48-42.
She was especially concerned as
the game progressed. "It really
scared me a lot. I said: 'Oh my,
this is trouble,' " VanDerveer ex
plained. "It made me feel real vul
nerable.
"It created a little doubt in my
mind. Saturday was reassuring to
me. It showed people have pride
in the way they play. As a team,
they asserted themselves," she
added. The strong performance
made it clear all the advanced
publicity the team has received
"isn't a bunch of hype."
Card notes
Azzi and Sonja Henning were the
only Stanford players to make the
all-tournament team. A strong case
could have been made to include
Stevens, who had 34 points and 14
rebounds, and Steding, who scored
28. Tournament officials, though,
decided to honor at least one player
from each of the four teams.
