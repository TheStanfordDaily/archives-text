SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP)
— Sophomore forward Sean
Rooks said Arizona's young
basketball team had something
to prove.
And challenging fourth
ranked Michigan's inside power
head on, the sixth-ranked Wild
cats knocked off the defending
national champions 82-75 Sat
urday in the Hall of Fame Tip-
Off Classic.
"Some people got down and
doubted us," Rooks said, a ref
erence to Arizona being beaten
71-60 by the Australian Na
tional Team in an exhibition
game. "And we had that in the
back of our mind."
Arizona coach Lute Olson
had a special strategy for
dealing with the defending
champions.
"I figured if we could get one
or two of their big guys in foul
trouble they would be hurt,"
he said.
His squad obliged and Mich
igan lost two front-court
starters, Terry Mills and Loy
Vaught, on fouls down the
stretch.
"It surprised me that they
were so sucessful inside," Mills
said. "They are a young team
and they wanted to come out
and make an impression on
Michigan — and they did."
After Mills, who finished
with 16 points, went to the
bench with 5Vz minutes left,
Arizona went on a 16-7 run,
rallying from a 68-66 deficit.
Michigan's Rumeal Robin
son, the free-throw hero of
NCAA championship, was the
game's top scorer with 27
points, but this time the foul
line belonged to Rooks. The 6-
foot-11 sophomore, who led Ar
izona with 20 points, sank six
consecutive free throws in the
final minutes.
"It wasn't just me," said
Rooks, who came off the bench
to earn most outstanding
player honors.
"We have to give Arizona
credit," Michigan coach Steve
Fisher said. "They got the ball
inside and got our big men in
foul trcuble."
