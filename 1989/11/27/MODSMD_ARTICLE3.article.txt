# Med student favors broad education

unique individuals in Stanford's
graduate schools.

Julie Seavello always knew
she wanted to go to medical
school. "But medicine is an in
credibly demanding field, and
you don't have much time for
outside interests," she says."I
wanted to be a wider person
first."
That meant learning seven
languages, spending one year in
Italy and two in Niger, earning
a masters degree in public health
and working as an AIDS coor
dinator for Santa Cruz County.
If Seavello, a first-year student
at the School of Medicine, were
any wider, she would burst.
Slight and blonde, Seavello
sits on the grass outside the
Medical School student lounge.
She's leafing through a photo
album of her Peace Corps stint
in the West African country of
Niger.
"The song 'We Are The World'
was written for us," she says of
her time there, fighting drought
and famine.
During her second year in
Niger, she built a children's
hospital out of mud bricks and
cement, "although hospital is a
big word for a three-room build
ing," she says. "At first I was
hospitalizing babies in my house,
which meant I wasn't sleeping."
Seavello is vivid in describing
her time in Africa. "The famine
was on, the starvation was in
credible. We lost all of our herds,
then all of our grain stores," she
says. "There were no immuniza

tions, no medicine, no way to
sterilize our needles."
When she left for Niger, the
AIDS crisis in the United States
was just beginning. "I was in a
place where I might have seen
it," she said, "but people starved
to death (in Niger) before they
ever died of AIDS."
Eventually, however, acquired
immune deficiency syndrome

would have a great impact on
Seavello.
A year after her Peace Corps
work, Seavello, with a masters
degree from Johns Hopkins Uni
versity under her belt, was de
termined to work fighting the
disease. She spent the next year
and-a-half as AIDS coordinator
for Santa Cruz County.
"Working with AIDS," she

says, "teaches me so much —
virology, immunology, human
clinical disease, human behavior,
addiction, poverty, sexual
choices, public policy and distri
bution of resources."
Seavello, "almost 30" years old
by her account, thinks that her
medical school class is "pretty

young" when compared to the di
versity of ages that Stanford's
other graduate schools are known
for.
For Seavello, the advantage of
her extensive experience before
medical school is that "now I'm
not interested in getting stressed
out," she says."I really pay at
tention to sleeping a lot and eating
well and exercising. It's taken a
decade for me to become commit
ted to these things."
In the spare time that Seavello
makes for herself, she likes to
"run, sing, cook, sew and write,"
she says quickly and energetically.
Nevertheless, she doesn't rec
ommend her background to every
body. "There are different needs,"
she says."I took care of what I
thought was important when I had
the time and liberty to do it."
Seavello does believe very
strongly, however, that physicians
should have a "renaissance" edu
cation. "People are so different,"
she says ; "and one needs to build
a base on which to understand
them."
Her most valuable classes as an
undergraduate, she says, were the
histories of art and music.
"They're the expression of man's
feelings about the world and his
society. When you study the evolu
tion of changes in art and music,
you get a real sense of our con
tinuity and our struggles, why we
are what we are today."
Throughout her various under
takings, Seavello knew she
"wanted to do medicine." How

ever, she says, because of her
roundabout past, "I had a hard
time convincing admissions com
mittees that this was really what
I wanted to do."
She applied to the Medical
School for fall 1988 and ended up
"at the top of the waiting list,"
she remembers. She spent a year
at Michigan State University's
medical school before transferring
to Stanford.
At Michigan State, Seavello or
ganized a medical school student
speakers bureau to visit high
schools and colleges. Her goal, she
says, "was not only to teach med
ical school students more about
disease in depth, but to teach
them how to teach ... not as an
expert, but as a peer."
Although a first-year student in
standing, Seavello calls herself a
"first-and-a-half." None of her
credits transferred with her to
Stanford, only "what I carried in
my brain," she says.
This circumstance has allowed
her to test out of several of the
introductory medical courses, in
cluding anatomy. "This meant
that when the building fell down
on all the med students in lab"
during the earthquake, she says,
smiling wickedly, "I wasn't
there."
Particularly at Stanford, medi
cal school "is an honor and a
privilege," Seavello says.
"I think that much of the rea
son I filled in my life so much
before was that I didn't think
medical school would allow it," she
said.
But, "here, you can study art,"
she says,"and I probably will."
