unique individuals in Stanford's
graduate schools.

Julie Seavello always knew
she wanted to go to medical
school. "But medicine is an in
credibly demanding field, and
you don't have much time for
outside interests," she says."I
wanted to be a wider person
first."
That meant learning seven
languages, spending one year in
Italy and two in Niger, earning
a masters degree in public health
and working as an AIDS coor
dinator for Santa Cruz County.
If Seavello, a first-year student
at the School of Medicine, were
any wider, she would burst.
Slight and blonde, Seavello
sits on the grass outside the
Medical School student lounge.
She's leafing through a photo
album of her Peace Corps stint
in the West African country of
Niger.
"The song 'We Are The World'
was written for us," she says of
her time there, fighting drought
and famine.
During her second year in
Niger, she built a children's
hospital out of mud bricks and
cement, "although hospital is a
big word for a three-room build
ing," she says. "At first I was
hospitalizing babies in my house,
which meant I wasn't sleeping."
Seavello is vivid in describing
her time in Africa. "The famine
was on, the starvation was in
credible. We lost all of our herds,
then all of our grain stores," she
says. "There were no immuniza

tions, no medicine, no way to
sterilize our needles."
When she left for Niger, the
AIDS crisis in the United States
was just beginning. "I was in a
place where I might have seen
it," she said, "but people starved
to death (in Niger) before they
ever died of AIDS."
Eventually, however, acquired
immune deficiency syndrome

would have a great impact on
Seavello.
A year after her Peace Corps
work, Seavello, with a masters
degree from Johns Hopkins Uni
versity under her belt, was de
termined to work fighting the
disease. She spent the next year
and-a-half as AIDS coordinator
for Santa Cruz County.
"Working with AIDS," she

says, "teaches me so much —
virology, immunology, human
clinical disease, human behavior,
addiction, poverty, sexual
choices, public policy and distri
bution of resources."
Seavello, "almost 30" years old
by her account, thinks that her
medical school class is "pretty
