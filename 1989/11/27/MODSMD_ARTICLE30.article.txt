# Hawaii blanks Card
## No. 3 Stanford hosts USC Thursday 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
After losing twice to the top
ranked Hawaii Rainbow Wahinis
over the Thanksgiving weekend,
the Stanford women's volleyball
team eagerly awaits the NCAA
regional tournament and a chance
to put an up-and-down 1989
season behind it.
The ninth-ranked Cardinal con
cluded a frustrating regular
season Friday night by losing
three straight games to Hawaii
after falling in four games on Wed
nesday night. Stanford finishes
the season with a 17-11 overall
record and a tie for second place
in the Pacific 10 Conference with
Washington.

The Cardinal, the West Region
al's third seed, will host a first
round regional match on Thurs
day night when sixth-seeded USC
visits Burnham Pavilion.
"I'm excited to have a fresh
start (in the regional tourna
ment)," Stanford Coach Don Shaw
said. "We've played hard all year
long, we've taken our lumps, and
hopefully we've learned a lesson."
The Cardinal took more than
its fair share of lumps from
Hawaii, now 27-2. On Wednesday,
Stanford spotted early leads to the
Rainbow Wahinis in every game
and had to battle back. Hawaii
capitalized on the Cardinal's early
lapses, winning the first game 15-
13 in spite of allowing Stanford
to come back from 10-3 down to
take a short-lived 13-11 lead.
Hawaii took control of the
match in the fourth game, holding
Stanford to just six points after
the Cardinal had won the third
game. The Rainbow Wahinis hit
an impressive team average of
.321 to offset a strong Cardinal
attack. Stanford was led by middle
blocker Bev Oden and outside hit
ter Jennifer Chaffee, who hit .484
and .474 respectively.
Setter Cheri Boyer spearheaded
the Hawaii attack on Wednesday,
adding her .667 hitting percentage
to the .563 tallied by 5-foot-9 out
side hitter Toni Nishida. Hawaii

won 15-13, 15-10, 7-15, 15-6.
Outside hitter Teee Williams-
Sanders single-handedly
dominated the Cardinal on Friday,
hitting .595 on 37 total attacks
and adding 12 digs, offsetting
Oden's .444 hitting percentage.
Hawaii hit .364 as a team and
held Stanford to a paltry .162 as
the Rainbow Wahinis won 15-6,
15-1, 15-13.
"We played okay on Wednes
day," Shaw said. "(But) on Friday
we plain and simple just got
whipped. They made a good team
look bad. They were pumped up
and we didn't stop them."
Stanford received word of its
regional seeding when the NCAA
Selection Committee announced
yesterday the 32-team field in the
1989 tournament. The Cardinal
drew USC as its first-round op
ponent in the West Regional. Stan
ford and the Women of Troy split
the two matches they played this
season; USC won in three games
Oct. 6 in Los Angeles, but Stan
ford returned the favor by sweep
ing USC at Burnham Pavilion
Nov. 2.
Second-ranked UCLA, which
fell from No. 1 after losing to
Pacific last weekend, is the West's
top seed. The Bruins host eighth
seeded Pepperdine in the first
round. Second-seeded Washington
hosts Western Athletic Conference
Champion and seventh-seeded
Wyoming; Oregon, the fourth
seed, travels to Arizona to face
the fifth-seeded Wildcats.
Should the Cardinal defeat USC
on Thursday, Stanford would play
the winner of the Washington-
Wyoming match. The winner of
UCLA-Pepperdine will face the
winner of Arizona-Oregon. The
regional semifinals and finals will
be held in Pauley Pavilion on the
UCLA campus should the Bruins
win their first round match. If
UCLA loses to Pepperdine and
Stanford wins, then the Cardinal
would host the remainder of the
West Regional.

said. "We've played hard all year
long, we've taken our lumps, and
hopefully we've learned a lesson."
The Cardinal took more than
its fair share of lumps from
Hawaii, now 27-2. On Wednesday,
Stanford spotted early leads to the
Rainbow Wahinis in every game
and had to battle back. Hawaii
capitalized on the Cardinal's early
lapses, winning the first game 15-
13 in spite of allowing Stanford
to come back from 10-3 down to
take a short-lived 13-11 lead.
Hawaii took control of the
match in the fourth game, holding
Stanford to just six points after
the Cardinal had won the third
game. The Rainbow Wahinis hit
an impressive team average of
.321 to offset a strong Cardinal
attack. Stanford was led by middle
blocker Bev Oden and outside hit
ter Jennifer Chaffee, who hit .484
and .474 respectively.
Setter Cheri Boyer spearheaded
the Hawaii attack on Wednesday,
adding her .667 hitting percentage
to the .563 tallied by 5-foot-9 out
side hitter Toni Nishida. Hawaii

won 15-13, 15-10, 7-15, 15-6.
Outside hitter Teee Williams-
Sanders single-handedly
dominated the Cardinal on Friday,
hitting .595 on 37 total attacks
and adding 12 digs, offsetting
Oden's .444 hitting percentage.
Hawaii hit .364 as a team and
held Stanford to a paltry .162 as
the Rainbow Wahinis won 15-6,
15-1, 15-13.
"We played okay on Wednes
day," Shaw said. "(But) on Friday
we plain and simple just got
whipped. They made a good team
look bad. They were pumped up
and we didn't stop them."
Stanford received word of its
regional seeding when the NCAA
Selection Committee announced
yesterday the 32-team field in the
1989 tournament. The Cardinal
drew USC as its first-round op
ponent in the West Regional. Stan
ford and the Women of Troy split
the two matches they played this
season; USC won in three games
Oct. 6 in Los Angeles, but Stan
ford returned the favor by sweep
ing USC at Burnham Pavilion
Nov. 2.
Second-ranked UCLA, which
fell from No. 1 after losing to
Pacific last weekend, is the West's
top seed. The Bruins host eighth
seeded Pepperdine in the first
round. Second-seeded Washington
hosts Western Athletic Conference
Champion and seventh-seeded
Wyoming; Oregon, the fourth
seed, travels to Arizona to face
the fifth-seeded Wildcats.
Should the Cardinal defeat USC
on Thursday, Stanford would play
the winner of the Washington-
Wyoming match. The winner of
UCLA-Pepperdine will face the
winner of Arizona-Oregon. The
regional semifinals and finals will
be held in Pauley Pavilion on the
UCLA campus should the Bruins
win their first round match. If
UCLA loses to Pepperdine and
Stanford wins, then the Cardinal
would host the remainder of the
West Regional.
