MILWAUKEE (AP) - Don
Majkowski threw two touch
down passes to Sterling
Sharpe, and Dave Brown had
two interceptions in the final
four minutes as Green Bay
scored its second big upset in
two weeks, beating Minnesota
20-19 yesterday.
The victory came a week
after the Packers defeated San
Francisco 21-17 and tied Green
Bay with the Vikings for the
NFC Central lead, both at 7-5.
Majkowski's second touch
down pass to Sharpe covered
9 yards, capped a 65-yard drive
and gave the Packers a 20-16
lead with 11 minutes left.
Majkowski, who did not prac
tice all week because of soie
ribs, completed his first 14
passes and was 17-for-19 at the
first half for 177 yards. He
finished with 26 completions
in 35 attempts for 276 yards
with Sharpe catching 10 passes
for 157 yards.
Minnesota then moved to the
Green Bay 6 as Wade Wilson
hit Anthony Carter for two
passes covering 30 yards and
connected with Steve Jordan
for 1"/ yards.
The Packers gave up 5 yards
to Herschel Walker in three
downs before Rich Karlis
kicked his fourth field goal,
making it 20-19 with 6:07 to go.
It was the fourth time during
the game the Packers' defense
forced field goals after the
Vikings had moved inside the
20.
Brown then made intercep

tions — the 58th and 59th of
his career — with 3:57 and 1:31
to go. Brown is now sixth on
the all-time NFL interception
list and the leader among active
players.
Walker's 6-yard run, set up
by Joey Browner's interception
and 34-yard return to the
Green Bay 9, gave the Vikings
a 16-10 lead with 7:13 left in
the third quarter.
Chris Jacke's 42-yard field
goal with 2:45 to go in the
quarter brought the Packers
within 16-13.
Green Bay led 10-6 at the
half, but Karlis kicked a 27-
yard field goal, to make it 10-9
with 10:52 left in the third
quarter.
That scoring drive was kept
alive when video replay
reversed an interception by the
Packers' Tim Harris on the
third scrimmage play of the
second half.
Harris grabbed a tipped Wil
son pass at the 40-yard line,
took two steps toward a wide
open field and dropped the ball.
Instead of an interception and
fumble recovery by Green Bay's
Brian Noble, as called on the
field, it was ruled incomplete.
Majkowski lifted a 34-yard
touchdown pass to Sharpe with
13:01 in the first half, giving
the Packers a 10-3 lead.
Wilson completed four
straight passes, moving the
Vikings to the Green Bay 22.
But three running plays netted
only 6 yards, and Karlis hit his
second field goal of the game,
a 34-yarder to make it 10-6.
