# A 						shot in the arm
## Council's role to expand as result of staff report 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
The University's Affirmative
Action Council got a "shot in the
arm" from the Nov 14 UCMI
staff report and may soon serve
as a barometer of minority staff
concerns and grievances.
The University Committee on
Minority Issues supplemental
staff report, which recommends
ways to improve race relations
and job conditions for minority
staff members, assigns the Af
firmative Action Council to over
see the implementation of many
of its recommendations.
"We are concerned about seeing
that the spirit of UCMI is met,"
said Affirmative Action Officer
Cecilia Burciaga. "The recommen
dations require consistent moni
toring."
The 24-member council was set
up a year and a half ago as an
advisory body to the affirmative
action officer.
Now, however, the council will
take a more active role in campus
minority relations.
Burciaga said the council will
now serve in a "partnership" with
individual University offices in
addressing concerns raised in the
report. "We are not playing an
adversarial role," she said.
The UCMI staff report recom
mended, for instance, the devel
opment of increased under
standing of racial and ethnic dif
ferences in the workplace and in
creased communication between
minority workers and supervisors.
Much of the council's adminis
trative power is derived from the

individual authority of various
members, Burciaga said. In addi
tion to Burciaga, influential
administrators on the council in
clude Director of Human Re
sources Mary Moore and Director
of Office Planning and Manage
ment Ray Bacchetti.
The new responsibilities recom
mended by the report will require
some "major changes" in the Af
firmative Action Council, accord
ing to member Harold Boyd of
the Office of Development.
In September, the council will
shrink to 16 members and will
coalesce into a more unified
decision-making body, Burciaga
said.
Though the council "has been
particularly revitalized and active
in the past five or six months,"
she said, the new oversight re
sponsibilities for the staff portion
of the UCMI "have been a shot
in the arm to us. We are a group
of individuals more collectively in
synch."
However, Boyd said the coun
cil's new role will require new def
initions of the council's authority
as well as increased commitment
among the members.
"We have to get serious about
what we mean by empowerment,"
Boyd said. The council will have
to examine how it "interplays with
"the Provost's Office and with the
workers themselves," he added.
In addition, Boyd suggested
that the council meet more than
once every three weeks, as it does
now.
"We have an enormous agenda,"
he said. "It will almost be like a
full-time responsibility."
If the council monitors minority
staff rights effectively, it may
more accurately reflect the con
cerns of minority workers than it
now does, some members sugges
ted.
Burciaga said that because so
many University activities are de
centralized into the various

schools and departments, a
centralized oversight body such as
the Affirmative Action Council
would "embody the University's
efforts" in keeping minority stafT
pleased with their working condi
tion.
"There will always be a need
for somebody to remain vigilant
over the overall trends [in staff
race relations]," she said.
Boyd said that in achieving such
a goal, the council must take on
more widespread ethnic represen
tation.
