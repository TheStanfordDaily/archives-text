# Focus houses taking shape at Stanford
## 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
When Robinson House became
the gender issues focus house this
quarter, it joined Adams House,
the human biology focus house,
doubling the number of focus
houses at Stanford — to two.
A relatively new feature of the
Office of Residential Education,
the focus house system is having
some trouble getting on its feet,
though many residents and staff
feel the program is worth pursu
ing.
Robinson and Adams "provide
an opportunity for students who
are interested in an issue be
with others who share these in
terests," Robinson Resident Fel
low Ken Fields said. He added
that a focus house "provides a
coherent subject for program
ming."
However, unlike academic and
ethnic theme houses, which also
focus on a particular subject,
focus houses do not require stu
dents to get special priorities in
the Draw. Students living in a
theme house must participate in
an activity related to the theme,
such as take a class or put on a
program. But this is not the case
with a focus house.
Each focus house is staffed by
the usual resident assistants and
several focus assistants, who plan
programs related to the focus.
This year, Robinson has hosted
a gender issues workshop from
Students Speaking About Race
and Culture, a talk by the Body,
Image and Self-Esteem group and

a program on rape education. The
focus assistants are also planning
a program on perceptions of men
and women in different religions,
Robinson focus assistant Jill
Banatoski said.
Programs at Adams have in
cluded a presentation about evo
lutionary psychology and a debate
on the legalization of drugs, said
Sunita Dwivedy, an Adams focus
assistant.
Clifford Yee, an RA at Adams,
said attendance at focus-related
programs varies depending on the
program. Dan Dermer, a focus as
sistant at Robinson, estimated
that at least 20 people have at
tended every program at the
house this year.
However, Andrew Parnell, an
Adams focus assistant last year,
said that in his experience, "a
majority of the house does not
participate" in focus-related pro
grams. The program "really
fizzled" by the end of last year,
he said.
"People were not as interested
in living in a focus house as they
were in living in Adams," which
is perceived to be a "good" dorm,
he added.
Students in both houses sup
ported Parnell's view. Derek
Armfield, a sophomore in Adams,
noted that while "some programs
are interesting," on the whole he
is "indifferent" to living in a focus
house.
Sophomore Nicholas Szeto, an
other Adams resident, said he
thinks it is "nice to have some
thing to discuss," but human bi
ology is "not a main focus" for

most people living in the house.
And Ed Morimoto, also a sopho
more in Adams, added that the
house "doesn't really seem differ
ent from anywhere else."
However, not all Adams and
Robinson residents are indifferent
to their house's focus.
Jackie Chang, a junior in
Adams, noted that since she is a
human biology major, she "takes
a great interest" in dorm pro
grams. Living in the focus house
provides "a great opportunity to
meet faculty," she added.
The environment in Robinson
"makes people talk about [gender]
issues more." said junior Yu-Min
Shen, a Robinson resident. Living
in a focus house enables him to
"get different viewpoints," he said.
David Lansdale, an evaluation
specialist for Res Ed who conducts
an annual survey on residential
life, said past surveys showed
mixed reactions to life in Adams.
While some residents said there
was "too much" focus, 68 percent
of students said they felt Adams
was intellectually stimulating.
This figure is "significantly
higher" than that in other upper
class dorms, he added.
Reactions among the staff of
each house is varied. While Fields
said he does not see any problems
with the focus house system, Lor
raine Morgan, the RF at Adams,
said she feels the dorm is "still
working to develop an identity."
The house is "an organism in the
stages of development," she said.
The job of focus assistants is
also "not really well-defined," said
Cathy Belcher, an RAin Robin

son, adding that as a result, "it's
been rough" this year. However,
she said that she thinks this lack
of definition can be changed and
will probably not remain a prob
lem.
Focus assistants need "some
good background" on what their
role is, Parnell said, adding that
he thinks paying the focus assis
tants would improve the focus
houses. Currently focus assistants
can get housing in an unguaran
teed year and extra points in their
house's room draw, but no money.
Many other students agree that
focus assistants should be paid.
Carrie Sims, a focus assistant last
year in Adams, said remuneration
in the form of money or academic
credit would "encourage a wider
pool of applicants" for the job.
But Karen Kinney, assistant di
rector of Res Ed, said that al
though there has been "ongoing
discussion" at Res Ed about
paying focus assistants, she thinks
"volunteering should be one of the
things Stanford students do."
Jennifer Mason, a Robinson
focus assistant, said RAs and
focus assistnats in the house
"don't know who is supposed to
do what" in terms of program
ming, and this confusion has led
to "some strain" in the house.
She suggested including focus as
sistants in RA training might help
alleviate this strain.
In spite of these problems, stu
dents and faculty are optimistic
about the focus house system.
The program is "still in adoles
cence," Morgan said.

to their house's focus.
Jackie Chang, a junior in
Adams, noted that since she is a
human biology major, she "takes
a great interest" in dorm pro
grams. Living in the focus house
provides "a great opportunity to
meet faculty," she added.
The environment in Robinson
"makes people talk about [gender]
issues more." said junior Yu-Min
Shen, a Robinson resident. Living
in a focus house enables him to
"get different viewpoints," he said.
David Lansdale, an evaluation
specialist for Res Ed who conducts
an annual survey on residential
life, said past surveys showed
mixed reactions to life in Adams.
While some residents said there
was "too much" focus, 68 percent
of students said they felt Adams
was intellectually stimulating.
This figure is "significantly
higher" than that in other upper
class dorms, he added.
Reactions among the staff of
each house is varied. While Fields
said he does not see any problems
with the focus house system, Lor
raine Morgan, the RF at Adams,
said she feels the dorm is "still
working to develop an identity."
The house is "an organism in the
stages of development," she said.
The job of focus assistants is
also "not really well-defined," said
Cathy Belcher, an RAin Robin

son, adding that as a result, "it's
been rough" this year. However,
she said that she thinks this lack
of definition can be changed and
will probably not remain a prob
lem.
Focus assistants need "some
good background" on what their
role is, Parnell said, adding that
he thinks paying the focus assis
tants would improve the focus
houses. Currently focus assistants
can get housing in an unguaran
teed year and extra points in their
house's room draw, but no money.
Many other students agree that
focus assistants should be paid.
Carrie Sims, a focus assistant last
year in Adams, said remuneration
in the form of money or academic
credit would "encourage a wider
pool of applicants" for the job.
But Karen Kinney, assistant di
rector of Res Ed, said that al
though there has been "ongoing
discussion" at Res Ed about
paying focus assistants, she thinks
"volunteering should be one of the
things Stanford students do."
Jennifer Mason, a Robinson
focus assistant, said RAs and
focus assistnats in the house
"don't know who is supposed to
do what" in terms of program
ming, and this confusion has led
to "some strain" in the house.
She suggested including focus as
sistants in RA training might help
alleviate this strain.
In spite of these problems, stu
dents and faculty are optimistic
about the focus house system.
The program is "still in adoles
cence," Morgan said.
When Robinson House became
the gender issues focus house this
quarter, it joined Adams House,
the human biology focus house,
doubling the number of focus
houses at Stanford — to two.
A relatively new feature of the
Office of Residential Education,
the focus house system is having
some trouble getting on its feet,
though many residents and staff
feel the program is worth pursu
ing.
Robinson and Adams "provide
an opportunity for students who
are interested in an issue be
with others who share these in
terests," Robinson Resident Fel
low Ken Fields said. He added
that a focus house "provides a
coherent subject for program
ming."
However, unlike academic and
ethnic theme houses, which also
focus on a particular subject,
focus houses do not require stu
dents to get special priorities in
the Draw. Students living in a
theme house must participate in
an activity related to the theme,
such as take a class or put on a
program. But this is not the case
with a focus house.
Each focus house is staffed by
the usual resident assistants and
several focus assistants, who plan
programs related to the focus.
This year, Robinson has hosted
a gender issues workshop from
Students Speaking About Race
and Culture, a talk by the Body,
Image and Self-Esteem group and

a program on rape education. The
focus assistants are also planning
a program on perceptions of men
and women in different religions,
Robinson focus assistant Jill
Banatoski said.
Programs at Adams have in
cluded a presentation about evo
lutionary psychology and a debate
on the legalization of drugs, said
Sunita Dwivedy, an Adams focus
assistant.
Clifford Yee, an RA at Adams,
said attendance at focus-related
programs varies depending on the
program. Dan Dermer, a focus as
sistant at Robinson, estimated
that at least 20 people have at
tended every program at the
house this year.
However, Andrew Parnell, an
Adams focus assistant last year,
said that in his experience, "a
majority of the house does not
participate" in focus-related pro
grams. The program "really
fizzled" by the end of last year,
he said.
"People were not as interested
in living in a focus house as they
were in living in Adams," which
is perceived to be a "good" dorm,
he added.
Students in both houses sup
ported Parnell's view. Derek
Armfield, a sophomore in Adams,
noted that while "some programs
are interesting," on the whole he
is "indifferent" to living in a focus
house.
Sophomore Nicholas Szeto, an
other Adams resident, said he
thinks it is "nice to have some
thing to discuss," but human bi
ology is "not a main focus" for

most people living in the house.
And Ed Morimoto, also a sopho
more in Adams, added that the
house "doesn't really seem differ
ent from anywhere else."
