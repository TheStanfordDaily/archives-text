SIDO fast to benefit
world food projects
The Stanford International
Development Organization is
this week sponsoring a series
of speakers on issues of eco
nomic development and world
hunger leading up to its annual
fast Thursday.
The fast benefits Stanford,
Bay Area and international
grassroots projects working on
Third World development and
food supply issues.
To participate in the fast,
students on University meal
plans may turn in their meal
cards at dinner Wednesday and
pick them up again Friday.
University Food Service will
give SIDO a check for the
money it would have spent
Thursday on those students'
food.

Three presentations lead up
to the fast. Julie Bunn, a doc
toral candidate in resource and
developmental economics and a
co-director of last year's You
Can Make a Difference confer
ence, will speak in Roble lounge
at 7 tonight. Her topic will be
"Natural Disasters and
Hunger: Acts of God or Acts
of Man?"
Tomorrow, three panelists,
including Economics Prof.
Partha Gupta, will address
"How to Solve World Hunger"
at 7 p.m. in the front dining
room of the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
The series winds up Wednes
