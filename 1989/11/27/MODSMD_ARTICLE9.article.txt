## Salvador breaks Nicaragua ties 
### 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — President
Alfredo Cristiani suspended diplomatic and com
mercial relations with Nicaragua's Soviet-backed
government yesterday to protest the alleged smug
gling of weapons to leftist guerrillas.
Also yesterday, police arrested an American
woman and said they confiscated some 80,000
rounds of ammunition, explosives, detonators and
grenades stored in her house and several other
locations.
The move announced by Cristiani in a nationally
televised address occurred one day after military
authorities discovered two light planes delivering
weapons to the rebels fighting the U.S.-backed gov
ernment.
One plane crashed in eastern El Salvador and
army troops recovered mostly Soviet weapons, in
cluding 25 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles.
One of the missiles was U.S.-made. Three crewmen
died, and the fourth committed suicide.
The other plane apparently was able to unload
its cargo after landing in the southern part of the
country, but it was unable to take off either for
lack of fuel or other reasons and was set on fire
by its crew, which then fled.
Three photographers were detained briefly by the
military Sunday when they went to photograph the
plane. The three are Juana Anderson of The Asso
ciated Press, Dayna Smith of The Washington Post
and Daymon Hartley of the Detroit Free Press.
They were held for not having permission to be in

the zone of the plane.
Cristiani told a news conference relations will
remain suspended until Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega "stops intervening in El Salvador" or loses
in national elections Feb. 25.
Missiles and other weapons taken from the
wreckage of the plane that crashed were displayed
at the news conference. As Cristiani spoke, sounds
of renewed fighting — automatic weapons and ex
ploding rockets — could be heard after a pause of
several days.
Later, the military explained in a news release
that an army patrol had sighted a group of guerrillas
near a power transformer on the northwest edge
of the capital and helicopters and C-47 warplanes
chased them as they fled up the slopes of San
Salvador Volcano.
The aircraft rocketed and strafed the area for
several hours.
In Managua, Ortega said Sunday it gives "honor
and pride" to the Nicaraguan people that the gov
ernment "of assassins of priests and religious
workers" in Salvador broke relations with Nicara
gua.
He apparently was referring at least in part to
the Nov. 16 massacre of six Jesuit priests, their
cook and her daughter at a Roman Catholic uni
versity residence. Other Jesuits at the school say
witnesses saw army troops enter the residence before
the killings. The government has denied responsi
bility.
