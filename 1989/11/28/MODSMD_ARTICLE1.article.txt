### Aaron Thode 
The greatest challenge facing
the United States during the
next 15 years "can be described
in two words: economic efficien
cy," Sen. Pete Domenici told an
audience in Cubberley Audito
rium yesterday.
Domenici, R-N.M., who un
abashedly proclaims himself as
"pro-American," noted that

other countries, especially
Mexico, have successfully ap
plied the American economic
system to their own economies.
However, as a result of their
success, "the United States no
longer has a lock on easy for
tune," he said.
Unless the country improves
its economic structure, "we face
recession and depression," he
added.

Domenici is the ranking Re
publican on both the Senate
Budget Committee and the En
ergy Research and Development
Subcommittee. He is also a
member of the Appropriations
and Natural Resources Commit
tees.
