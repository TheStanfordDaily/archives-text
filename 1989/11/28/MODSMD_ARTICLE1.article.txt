# Senator stumps for 'efficiency'
## Domenici cites need to change structure of U.S. economy 
### Aaron Thode 
The greatest challenge facing
the United States during the
next 15 years "can be described
in two words: economic efficien
cy," Sen. Pete Domenici told an
audience in Cubberley Audito
rium yesterday.
Domenici, R-N.M., who un
abashedly proclaims himself as
"pro-American," noted that

other countries, especially
Mexico, have successfully ap
plied the American economic
system to their own economies.
However, as a result of their
success, "the United States no
longer has a lock on easy for
tune," he said.
Unless the country improves
its economic structure, "we face
recession and depression," he
added.

Domenici is the ranking Re
publican on both the Senate
Budget Committee and the En
ergy Research and Development
Subcommittee. He is also a
member of the Appropriations
and Natural Resources Commit
tees.

Speaking in Cubberley last night, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the U.S. must become more
economically efficient in the next 15 years.
as "a source of intellectual lead
ership in Congress."
Domenici's speech, which was
sponsored by Stanford in Govern
ment, focused on health care and
education as primary examples of
economic inefficiency.
"The United States spends
more money on health care than
any other country. This system is
the fifth largest economy in the
world," Domenici said. Although
the government allocates huge
amounts of money to health care,
the system has improved little, he
added.
He predicted major changes
would occur in health care legis
lation over the next 18 months.
With respect to education,
Domenici considers the lack of
qualified teachers a mtyor prob
lem. "Knowledge, not natural
resources, is the source of
strength of a country," he said.
"Ninety percent of our college
graduates who say they want to
be teachers were in the bottom
15 percent of their entering
classes," he said.

As a partial remedy, Domenici
said he co-wrote a bill with Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., that
would establish a "Teachers
Corps." Such a program would
offer strong incentives to gradu
ating seniors to teach subjects the
nation deems crucial for economic
survival, he explained.
During the question period that
followed the speech, Donald Ken
nedy suggested the federal gov
ernment provide graduates some
form of need-based aid that would
pay for the year of graduate study
required to obtain a master's
degree in education.
However, Domenici replied, "We
need to find people who are
trained in their subject, not in
education."
In addition to responding to
questions about health care and
education, Domenici outlined his
views on a variety of other issues.
He said he is "not terribly
enamored" with the idea of a pres
idential line-item veto, which
would allow the president to reject
parts of a bill instead of vetoing
the entire bill. Such power would
allow the president to "punish
mightily and reward mightily," he
said.
