Green documents libraiy reopens
After suffering heavy damage from the Oct.
17 earthquake, the Jonsson Library of Govern
ment Documents opened yesterday for regular
business.
The west wing of Green Library, where the
collection is held, was heavily damaged in the
earthquake, but construction workers have built
wooden support arches to give the building more
stability.
Access to some areas in the building will be
limited, but the collection is fully accessible, said
Ann Latta, assistant chief of the Jonnson collec
tion. The collection escaped harm in the earth
quake because bracing of bookshelves had been
completed last year.
