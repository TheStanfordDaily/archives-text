## Pressure for Czech reform mounts Millions participate in nationwide strike 
### 
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP)
— Millions of people ignored gov
ernment pleas and joined a nation
wide general strike yesterday in
the largest and most dramatic
demonstration so far for democ
racy and an end to Communist
Party rule.
"We don't want you anymore!"
a flag-waving crowd of 200,000
roared in a thunderous chant that
echoed off the 19th-century build
ings surrounding downtown Wen
ceslas Square. It was the 11th
straight day of massive protests
in Czechoslovakia.
Huge crowds of workers also
poured into the streets of Bratis
lava, the east Slovak industrial
center of Kosice, the mining center
of Ostrava on the Polish border,
and in Usti nad Labem, the heart
of industrial north Bohemia.
The showing was a resounding
victory for the opposition, which
had called the two-hour strike a
referendum on the Communists'
40-year monopoly on power.
Communist leaders' frantic at
tempts to avert the strike failed,
as workers joined the pro
democracy movement started by
students, artists and intellectuals.
Shaken leaders continued to
make new concessions to the op
position:
• The party's Central Commit
tee dumped three more hard
liners from the ruling Politburo,
the second major leadership res
huffle in three days.
• The Czech and Slovak mini
stries of culture announced they
had lifted most forms of press

censorship.
• The Central Committee ap
proved an inquiry by a parliamen
tary commission into a Nov. 17
rally in which riot police clubbed
hundreds of peaceful pro
democracy demonstrators.
• Deputy premier Jaromir Zak
said on state TV that after long
discussion, it was decided to drop

the article enshrining the leading
role of the Communists in the
constitution from a new draft of
the document. "Every political
party has the right to a leading
role as long as it is based on
results," he said. "It's not possible
to lay this down in the constitu
tion."
• The official CTK news agency

said parliament, until now a
rubber-stamp body under firm
Communist control, also would be
open to discussion of any draft
laws. Vladimir Janku, head of the
state's commission on church af
fairs, was quoted as saying these
would include new laws on reli
gion that would end state control
over churches.
