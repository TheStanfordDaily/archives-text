SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO,
Calif. (AP) - A CalTrain com
muter train collided with a
charter bus loaded with pas
sengers, killing two people and
injuring about two dozen
others during the rush hour
last night, police said.
The two victims were em
ployees of ABC-TV, which char
tered the bus to carry workers
and guests around the San
Francisco Bay area, according
to South San Francisco Police
Sgt. Mike Guglielmoni.
The employees were in town
for the broadcast of Monday
Night Football, which was
celebrating its 20th anniversa
ry. Bus passengers included
network employees and clients
of ABC, said Guglielmoni.
The victims were not identi
fied pending notification of
family. One was a network
sales executive based in Los
Angeles and the other a sports
executive with ABC Sports in
New York, according to Bob
Wheeler, manager of sports in
formation for the network.
The bus was the third in a
convoy of four vehicles full of
ABC employees and clients who
had taken a cruise on the San
Francisco Bay and were headed
to Candlestick Park to watch
the San Francisco 49ers play
the New York Giants, Wheeler
said.

South San Francisco Police
Officer Greg Hart said the bus
was caught on the train tracks
when the collision occurred at
5:45 p.m.
The train did not derail and
none of its passengers were in
jured, according to Andy An
derson, a spokesman for South
ern Pacific, which operates the
commute line.
The bus drove across the
tracks at Oyster Point Boule
vard and Old Bayshore High
way, about five miles south of
San Francisco, but came to a
stop behind a double tractor
trailer truck.
"The gates came down and
the bus was stuck," said Hart.
"The driver tried to get around
and honked his horn several
times to clear traffic.
"It's just a question of get
ting caught in a situation
where you're in between the
arms," said Hart. "The south
bound train hit the rear end
of the bus and spun it around
clockwise."
The driver has volunteered
to take drug and alcohol tests,
Guglielmoni said.
As many as 25 people were
injured in the accident, said
Hart, basing his reports on dis
cussions with paramedics. The
injuries included those treated
at the scene.
