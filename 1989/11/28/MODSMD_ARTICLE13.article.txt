SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -
The last words anyone heard the Rev.
Ignacio Martin-Baro say were: "What an
injustice. What carnage."
A few minutes later, he and five Jesuit
colleagues were shot down. The killers
seemed determined to leave no witnesses.
The cook and her teen-age daughter were
slaughtered, too.
But someone survived the blood bath
Nov. 16 at Jose Simeon Canas Central

American University: a cleaning woman
named Lucia Barrera de Cerna.
In sworn testimony the judge made
available yesterday to The Associated
Press, Mrs. Barrera, 44, said the killers
wore military uniforms.
Until yesterday, only sketchy second
hand accounts were available of her tes
timony about the killings that stunned
El Salvador and caused an international
outcrv.

"1 don't discount any possibility; it's
probably members of the military," said
Ricardo A. Zamorra, the investigating
judge who took her statement Nov. 22 at
the Spanish Embassy, where the woman
hid until fleeing to Miami last week under
the protection of U.S. officials.
Mrs. Barrera said she was awakened
by gunfire at about 1 a.m. and ran to a
window. In "moonlight that was like
daytime," she reported seeing five uni

formed men close in, shooting, on the
residence the six Jesuits shared across
the way.
Two assailants wore camouflage, she
said, like the uniforms "I have seen on
the soldiers in the street," and the others
were clad in dark uniforms.
She heard doors flung open and more
shots, then "voices, without being able to
distinguish who spoke at first. Only the
voice of Padre Nachito (Martin-Baro) was

I finally able to hear. He was saying:
'What an injustice. What carnage.' "
After an outburst of gunfire, "Padre
Nachito spoke no more," she said.
A few seconds later, Mrs. Barrera heard
furniture crashing and glass breaking.
She said she left the window and rushed
to tell her husband what she had seen,
"crying for what I imagined might have
happened, because I couldn't hear the
padre." [I|M
