BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) - A Colom
bian jetliner crashed on the outskirts of
Bogota shortly after takeoff yesterday and
all 107 people aboard were killed. A caller
to a radio station claimed drug traffickers
bombed the jet.
Witnesses said the Avianca Airlines
Boeing 727-100 exploded before it plunged
into a hilly area south of the capital, about
a mile from a neighborhood of slum houses
and factories. Pieces of the jet were found
up to six miles from the main point of
impact, police said.
Hours later, a man called Radio Caracol
and claimed that a group called The Ex
traditables blew up the jet to kill five police
informants. He said the five gave police
information that led to the discovery of
the Medellin drug cartel leader's hideout.
The man did not identify himself, and
the claim could not be immediately aut
henticated.
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in
Bogota said one U.S. citizen, Andres Escabi,
was known to have been killed in the crash.
He said Escabi, a native of Puerto Rico,
also held Colombian citizenship and lived
in Bogota.
"The plane was flying along when sud
denly it exploded, broke in two and fell in
flames and smoke," said a witness, Alfonso
Moreno, in an interview with the radio
network Caracol.
Flight 203 was bound for Cali, about
190 miles southwest of Bogota. Cali is the

headquarters of one of Colombia's biggest
cocaine cartels and has been the site of
frequent bombings and other attacks since
the government declared war on drug lords
in August.
"I heard explosions and I thought there
was some problem with transformers in
the electrical station, but I looked up and
saw a plane explode in the air, and bodies
and pieces of luggage were falling," said
another witness, Mario Vasquez.
Two Colombian air force pilots in another
plane reported seeing two explosions on
the jet, said the director of Colombia's Civil
Aviation Authority, Col. Jorge Gonzalez.
The airline refused comment on the
reports of explosions. Avianca spokes
woman Patricia Duarte said the plane
carried 101 passengers and a crew of six
and that all were killed. Their nationalities
were not immediately known.
Investigators found no evidence of a
bomb, said Col. Gustavo Leal, chief of na
tional police for the state.
Radio Caracol said the flight recorder
was found and civil aeronautics specialists
were analyzing its data.
The plane took off from Bogota's El
Dorado International Airport at 7:15 a.m.,
and the pilot, Jose Ossa, told the tower at
7:18 a.m. that everything was normal, Ms.
Duarte told The Associated Press. It
crashed shortly afterward.
