Reforms praised
MOSCOW (AP) — The Communist
Party daily Pravda, in its loudest
praise so far for the political changes
in Czechoslovakia, yesterday called it
a "natural and appropriate" process
of renewal.
The Pravda commentary also in
dicted the old Czechoslovak leadership
for letting its chance to oversee reform
go by, saying it "waited, vacillated,
for every step forward made one step
back."
In a similar vein, Soviet Foreign
Ministry spokesman Yuri
Gremitskikh said the government
hopes the growing dialogue among po
litical groups in Czechoslovakia "will
further the renewal of socialism in
Czechoslovakia."
He also indicated the Soviet Union
won't reject the 1968 Soviet-led War
saw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia
to crush the "Prague Spring" reform
until the Czechoslovak leadership does
its own historical revision.
"If there is to be a re-evaluation,
it has to be a re-evaluation by every
one," Gremitskikh said.
Pravda concluded that "Czechos
lovakia is once again on a crossroads.

There, the natural and appropriate
process of the renewal of socialism,
which started earlier in other coun
tries of Eastern Europe, is taking
place."
Ambushes encouraged
JERUSALEM (AP) - An Islamic
fundamentalist group yesterday
praised the killing of Israeli soldiers
and urged that more be ambushed in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
The call for more attacks was in a
leaflet distributed in the West Bank
by the fundamentalist group Hamas,
or Zeal. It called for a strike Dec. 9,
as the third year of the uprising in
the occupied lands begins.
In the Hamas leaflet, the group said
it had mobilized "several thousand
strugglers" to step up the uprising.
It praised the shooting deaths of
two Israeli soldiers in mid-November
and the deaths of two others earlier
this year and called for "the increased
use of ambushes against Israeli sol
diers in the third year of the uprising."
Hamas has been outlawed by Israel,
and more than 250 of its leaders have
been arrested, according to the army.

Soldiers released
PESHAWAR. Pakistan (AP) - Two
Soviet soldiers held for more than two

Dozens of mujahedeen, Islamic
"holy warriors," toting Soviet-made
