Inadequate investigator
of alleged assault
should be replaced

WANTED: A NEW inves
tigator for the alleged
sexual assault at the Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity house on
Oct. 6.
Reason: The investigation of the
alleged sexual assault is being
bungled, and it's time to find some
one who can get the job done.
The amount of information on
the alleged incident is growing.
Now four people have come for
ward to say that they spoke to the
girl or saw her after the incident.
Apparently, the people involved
in the case are not Stanford stu
dents. The alleged victim is a 13-
year-old girl, and the alleged
perpetrators were California
Polytechnic State University stu
dents.
More problems have resulted,
however, because Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Hughes is inves
tigating the incident.
First, it is questionable as to
why any fraternal affairs adviser
is handling the investigation.
Though the incident occurred in a
fraternity, none of the fraternity
members have been accused of any
wrongdoing in the matter, and
there are other members of the
Student Affairs office who are ex
tremely experienced and knowl
edgeable about rape.
Hughes, however, has only made
the situation worse with his callous
comments. Because of the sensitive
nature of the case, he should be
removed from the investigation.
The evidence of mishandling
comes both from the impressions
of witnesses who have talked to
Hughes and from his comments to

The Daily about "levels of victims."
Jill Salak, who wrote the original
letter to Hughes about the inci
dent, said that Hughes "kept ex
plaining the damage that the
allegations could do to the frater
nity."
These comments, compounded
with Hughes' earlier comment on
the original letter that "the
credibility of the letter has led me
to believe that the incident did not
occur," points to a significant bias
on his part.
The investigator of this incident
needs to understand that the only
victim with whom the investigation
should be immediately concerned
is the alleged victim of the assault.
To label any other actor as a "vic
tim" is to minimize the possibly
tremendous damage to this young
girl.
In addition, Hughes has not yet
talked to the Stanford police, who
are also investigating the incident.
A cooperative effort could result
in a quicker resolution to the in
cident.
These factors contribute to the
most damaging publicity to the fra
ternity: the incident is in the news
because the matter has not been
handled expeditiously and sensi
tively.
In the future, more investigation
of the circumstances surrounding
the incident may be jiecessary. All
Stanford parties should be careful
to prevent the circumstances where
this type of event could happen.
For now, however, the case needs
to be settled, for there may be a
traumatized young girl out there
who needs help. At the same time
there could be perpetrators of this
alleged crime running loose who
need to be shown just how serious
a crime sexual assault is.
This is a job for someone else
in the Student Affairs office, some
one who will get the job done right.
