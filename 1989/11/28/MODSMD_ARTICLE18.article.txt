Senators seek consistent standard for student funding

WE, AS MEMBERS of Students
First, could not agree more
with The Daily's editorial
board when it claims, "the ASSU
Senate should try to maintain some
sense of definitive, legislative history."
(Nov. 22)
However, this is where our agree
ment with the editors (and coinciden
tally, the People's Platform) ends. The
Daily's Nov. 22 editorial blatantly
misrepresents the facts surrounding
the Program Board allocations of
student funds and the grounds on
which Students First senators objected
In fact, Students First senators did
not wish to deny Program Board
funds. Rather, we asked that the

money for the Democratic Socialists
and the Stanford Central American
Action Network (SCAAN) be delayed
until the Administration and Rules
Committee met to define the criteria
under which student groups could
apply for funding for political causes.
Students First senators only want to
establish a consistent standard so that
all student groups are judged by the
same criteria.
The Daily must realize that no
consensus could be reached during the
Nov. 9 senate meeting among the
participants in the debate as to the
"legislative history" of this type of
allocation. We, as Students First
senators, were not willing to sacrifice
our responsiblity of allocating student

funds for the sake of expediency.
In addition, The Daily only told half
of the story in regard to the 1987
Administration and Rules memoran
dum which specifically held that the
senate could not issue funds to cover
the "operating expenses" of political
groups. Indeed, a portion of SCAAN's
funding would already be disallowed
under this provision.
The Daily editorial substantiated
their opinion from the words of Stu
dent Organization Services Director
Michael Ramsey-Perez. Unfortunately,
Mr. Ramsey-Perez's clarification as to
the type of funds that could be alloca
ted to student groups occurred after
the Nov. 9 senate meeting.

If the People's Platform had allowed
this rule clarification to be made at
the following Administration and Rules
Committee meeting, the two groups in
question would have received the full
support of Students First, and a set
criteria would have been established.
As it stands, "politics" will continue
to dominate the senate until the
People's Platform abandons their own
political ideologies and focuses on
providing student services.
