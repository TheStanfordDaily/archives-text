Something amazing is happening at
Stanford. Students are getting involved.
What's more amazing, these are gradu
ate students, and they're getting in
volved in their own education.
A small but hearty lot has been
meeting over the last month to discuss
issues that are important to graduate
students, issues like the recent cut
backs in summer funding for research
in Humanities and Sciences depart
ments on the Fellows Plan, reported in
The Daily on Nov. 9.
Under the auspices of the ASSU and
with help from the Council of Presi
dents, we've formed the Graduate Con
cerns Committee. We feel that gradu
ate students should speak out and be
heard on issues that affect them di
rectly.

On Nov. 17, we had a meeting with
Elizabeth Traugott, dean of graduate
studies, and Karlene Dickey, associate
dean of graduate studies, to discuss
the summer cutbacks. The meeting
proved to be very productive and
helped to clarify the concerns of both
the administration and the students.
The administration seemed delighted
to finally have a group of students to
talk to, students who are interested in
maintaining the quality of education
we've come to expect at Stanford. It's
up to us, working with the faculty and
the administration, to insure that we
can continue to study here without
continual concern about funding, while
conducting meaningful research and
making steady progress toward the
completion of our degrees.
We've made the first step, now we
need students. We encourage any grad
uate students who want to be heard on
matters that affect them to join us. We
meet every Thursday at noon in the
Tresidder ASSU offices.
