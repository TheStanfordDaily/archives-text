Stanford alumna Frances
Morales will become the Univer
sity's first full-time director of El
Centro Chicano, it was announced
yesterday.
The selection concluded a six
month search by students, faculty
and staff. Morales will assume her
duties as El Centro director and
assistant dean of Student Affairs
in late December.
"We're looking forward to her
presence on campus," said Char
lene Aguilar, chair of the El Centro
group overseeing the transition to
a new dean. "She brings a lot of
breadth and depth from her many
experiences."
Morales attended Stanford from
1975 to 1982 and received both

a master's degree and doctorate
in education and a master's in
anthropology.
"I have a familiarity with the
campus, and I know the important
role El Centro can play with stu
dents," Morales said yesterday.
"El Centro was a support for me
while I was here."
Morales also received a master's
in guidance and counseling from
the University of New Mexico in
1974. Currently she is the training
coordinator of Oakland's Multi
functional Resource Center, which
"provides training and technical
assistance to educators working
with language-minority students,"
Morales said.
"I'm happy about the decision,"
said Graduate School of Business
Prof. Jerry Porras, chair of the
dean search committee. The

search committee, created last
spring, is composed of four stu
dents, two faculty and two staff
members.
The committee selected the new
dean after analyzing the written
opinions of the students, faculty
and staff who interviewed Morales
and four other candidates two
weeks ago.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson then approved
the choice and offered the position
to Morales. One of Jackson's ad
ministrative assistants said Jack
son was "pleased with the work
of the search committee and is
looking forward to working with
Morales and the Chicano commu
nity."
Porras said he and the search
