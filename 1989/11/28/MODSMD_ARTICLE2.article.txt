Stanford alumna Frances
Morales will become the Univer
sity's first full-time director of El
Centro Chicano, it was announced
yesterday.
The selection concluded a six
month search by students, faculty
and staff. Morales will assume her
duties as El Centro director and
assistant dean of Student Affairs
in late December.
"We're looking forward to her
presence on campus," said Char
lene Aguilar, chair of the El Centro
group overseeing the transition to
a new dean. "She brings a lot of
breadth and depth from her many
experiences."
Morales attended Stanford from
1975 to 1982 and received both

a master's degree and doctorate
in education and a master's in
anthropology.
"I have a familiarity with the
campus, and I know the important
role El Centro can play with stu
dents," Morales said yesterday.
"El Centro was a support for me
while I was here."
Morales also received a master's
in guidance and counseling from
the University of New Mexico in
1974. Currently she is the training
coordinator of Oakland's Multi
functional Resource Center, which
"provides training and technical
assistance to educators working
with language-minority students,"
Morales said.
"I'm happy about the decision,"
said Graduate School of Business
Prof. Jerry Porras, chair of the
dean search committee. The

search committee, created last
spring, is composed of four stu
dents, two faculty and two staff
members.
The committee selected the new
dean after analyzing the written
opinions of the students, faculty
and staff who interviewed Morales
and four other candidates two
weeks ago.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson then approved
the choice and offered the position
to Morales. One of Jackson's ad
ministrative assistants said Jack
son was "pleased with the work
of the search committee and is
looking forward to working with
Morales and the Chicano commu
nity."
Porras said he and the search
committee were impressed by
Morales' "thoughtfulness and in
sight into the issues ... in the
Stanford Chicano community."
He added she was "quick to pick
up the central needs and themes
in the community, and she was
insightful about what to do here."
He said he was encouraged by
Morales' attitudes toward build
ing the community, collaborating
in decision making and setting
goals for El Centro. "She's the
person who will bring people to
gether," Porras said.
Morales said she was excited
about her new position. Her first
actions as dean will be to learn
what the group overseeing the
transitional period has done and
to work with the community to
establish a policy board for El
Centro, she said.

In five years she hopes to see
El Centro as "a vital part of the
community," a place where people
can come to study, plan activities
and feel at home, she said. El
Centro should also play a role in
educating other minority and
white students about Chicano cul
ture, she added.
Students responded positively
to the new dean. "I'm ecstatic,"
said sophomore Alma Medina,
publicity coordinator of MEChA,
the Hispanic student organiza
tion. "Now we can move on to
improve El Centro Chicano and
make it the true center of Chicano
life at Stanford."
Chicano students mentioned a
number of factors they felt were
integral in the choice of Morales
as the dean. "She had a firm grasp
of the community at Stanford,"
said junior Anita DeLucio, an un
dergraduate in the Chicano Fel
lows Program.
DeLucio was impressed by

Morales' ideas about the facilita
tion of the Chicano community's
transition. "The community is
going to be happy" with the new
dean, she said.
DeLucio was also excited to
have a woman administrator in
Student Affairs and at one of the
ethnic centers. "Sometimes in our
race struggle, our gender struggle
is ignored," DeLucio said.
Sophomore Ana Mata, co-chair
of MEChA, said Morales' out
standing feature was her ability
to communicate with the stu
dents. "She'll be a well-qualified
administrator who will effectively
advocate for the students," she
said.
Senior Jon Inda, a member of
the search committee, said, "As a
student I felt comfortable with
talking to her. She had the best
ideas of what needed to be done
... and she had a concrete pro
posal about her plans for El
Centro.
