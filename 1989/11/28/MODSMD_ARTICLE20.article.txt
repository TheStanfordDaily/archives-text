## 
### 
The Hillel Foundation at Stanford
and we, as three Jewish students con
cerned with Latin American Studies,
would like to express our outrage at
the recent slayings of six Jesuit priests
and two others in El Salvador. We
recognize that these human rights
violations have implications not only
for the Christian community but for
all free people and all religions.
Donations to the Salvadoran Human
itarian Aid, Research and Education
(SHARE) Foundation can be made at
the Hillel Foundation in the Old Union
Clubhouse. SHARE has requested fi
nancial aid in the amount of $650,000
for the ecumenical agency DIACONIA
and the Archdiocese of the Roman
Catholic Church in El Salvador. These
funds are needed for food, water,
medicines and blankets for the civilian

population. Besides donating funds you
can help by calling and writing your
senator.
The Hillel Foundation joins in
mourning the recent deaths and need
less violence in El Salvador.
