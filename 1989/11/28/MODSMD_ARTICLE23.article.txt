## The 						decade that won't die 
### 
BECAUSE THIS IS the decade of
visual imagery from television and
movies to MTV, I thought it fitting
to compare America in the 1980s to a
movie. I considered using "Who Framed
Roger Rabbit?" Lots of visual thrills and
funny moments but very little substance.
The New York Times claimed "Sex, Lies
and Videotape" was the movie to close
the decade, but being at Stanford for
three years, it's hard to endorse anything
with "sex" in its title as representative.
I finally chose the "Friday the 13th" se
ries. The 1980s and Jason just won't die.
Just when you think Jason is dead, he
comes back with a whole new way to
maim. The problem is that he has re
turned so many times, he is now comical.
Audiences went to the first installment
to be scared, but now they go to laugh
at the stupidity of the victims.
Similarly, this decade has had its share
of motifs which won't die: Live-Aid,'Band-
Aid, AIDS, lemonade (fruit juices have
more vitamins than Coke,) Bike-Aid, you
name it. Indeed the 1980s itself is some
what of a recurring theme. We can't
predict when the decade-ending event will
come. Wouldn't the corruption laced with
a healthy dose of patriotism from good
ole Ollie be a perfect ending to this dec
ade? But wait, that was way back in 1986.
The Wall Street crash Monday, October
19, 1987, also could have been the perfect
climax to an era that saw the rise and
fall of greed. We could consider Black
Monday as the demise of the wealthy
images which prospered in the early
1980s. Maybe we should consider the loss
of Dukakis, despite a 17 point lead in

the polls during the summer of 1988, as
a poetic anti-climax to the decade.
Who really knows how we can close
out the 1980s? Just when you thought
it was safe to call it quits, poof! Another
blunder appears. One thing is for sure.
The 1980s (and hopefully Jason) must
end on December 31, 1989.
Unfortunately, the same question
arises when we consider the end of either
"Friday the 13th" or the yuppie-infested
1980s. What can we replace them with?
More importantly, how can people fall
prey to religious leaders again and again?
Reverend Moon is Jimmy Swaggart is
Jim Bakker. Why is the same issue which
Roe v. Wade solved so eloquently return
ing to the political forefront?
We have no improvements. Only sub
stitutes. Yeah, the materialism of "Dal
las" is gone, but what is it replaced with?
The safe capitalism and beautiful clothing
of "The Cosby Show." We still love to
watch rich, greedy bastards. We just don't
want them to admit how materialistic
they are. The 1980s were the "don't wor
ry, be happy" decade, and who wants to
consider reality after that?
We're learning our lesson, but only as
we pay the price of profligacy. To stretch
the analogy beyond all reasonable pro
portions, consider that the last "Friday
the 13th" made less money than the pre
vious ones. The studio might finally have
to pay the price. Likewise, America is
beginning to pay the price for supply-side
Reaganomics. Who really thought people
would spend more money than they saved
through tax cuts? Many of the boom
towns of the Southwest and the whole

state of Texas are hurting for reasons
ranging from the oil crisis to overspecula
tion in real estate.
Don't despair. As Woody Allen once
said, "The heart is a very resilient little
muscle." I suspect America is equally
flexible. We won't realize that we all want
happiness. We won't notice that there is
very little difference between the ideals
of the Democrats and the Republicans.
We won't admit that people are basically
good. But if we simply learn to stress
education and deny the sordid themes
which the media stuffs down our throats,
we will survive.
Yes, the 1990s are upon us. This is
our generation to ignite a spark. We get
to choose our initial profession and start
playing our part in the world. In the face
of these overwhelming tasks being put
on our shoulders, it helps me to remem
ber those few constant symbols we have
to comfort us among all the schlock:
mom, a starry night's walk to the Dish
and the feeling one gets after taking the
last final of the quarter. Have a good
winter break (and remember, the 1990s
are only 34 days away).

las" is gone, but what is it replaced with?
The safe capitalism and beautiful clothing
of "The Cosby Show." We still love to
watch rich, greedy bastards. We just don't
want them to admit how materialistic
they are. The 1980s were the "don't wor
ry, be happy" decade, and who wants to
consider reality after that?
We're learning our lesson, but only as
we pay the price of profligacy. To stretch
the analogy beyond all reasonable pro
portions, consider that the last "Friday
the 13th" made less money than the pre
vious ones. The studio might finally have
to pay the price. Likewise, America is
beginning to pay the price for supply-side
Reaganomics. Who really thought people
would spend more money than they saved
through tax cuts? Many of the boom
towns of the Southwest and the whole

state of Texas are hurting for reasons
ranging from the oil crisis to overspecula
tion in real estate.
Don't despair. As Woody Allen once
said, "The heart is a very resilient little
muscle." I suspect America is equally
flexible. We won't realize that we all want
happiness. We won't notice that there is
very little difference between the ideals
of the Democrats and the Republicans.
We won't admit that people are basically
good. But if we simply learn to stress
education and deny the sordid themes
which the media stuffs down our throats,
we will survive.
Yes, the 1990s are upon us. This is
our generation to ignite a spark. We get
to choose our initial profession and start
playing our part in the world. In the face
of these overwhelming tasks being put
on our shoulders, it helps me to remem
ber those few constant symbols we have
to comfort us among all the schlock:
mom, a starry night's walk to the Dish
and the feeling one gets after taking the
last final of the quarter. Have a good
winter break (and remember, the 1990s
are only 34 days away).

BECAUSE THIS IS the decade of
visual imagery from television and
movies to MTV, I thought it fitting
to compare America in the 1980s to a
movie. I considered using "Who Framed
Roger Rabbit?" Lots of visual thrills and
funny moments but very little substance.
The New York Times claimed "Sex, Lies
and Videotape" was the movie to close
the decade, but being at Stanford for
three years, it's hard to endorse anything
with "sex" in its title as representative.
I finally chose the "Friday the 13th" se
ries. The 1980s and Jason just won't die.
Just when you think Jason is dead, he
comes back with a whole new way to
maim. The problem is that he has re
turned so many times, he is now comical.
Audiences went to the first installment
to be scared, but now they go to laugh
at the stupidity of the victims.
Similarly, this decade has had its share
of motifs which won't die: Live-Aid,'Band-
Aid, AIDS, lemonade (fruit juices have
more vitamins than Coke,) Bike-Aid, you
name it. Indeed the 1980s itself is some
what of a recurring theme. We can't
predict when the decade-ending event will
come. Wouldn't the corruption laced with
a healthy dose of patriotism from good
ole Ollie be a perfect ending to this dec
ade? But wait, that was way back in 1986.
The Wall Street crash Monday, October
19, 1987, also could have been the perfect
climax to an era that saw the rise and
fall of greed. We could consider Black
Monday as the demise of the wealthy
images which prospered in the early
1980s. Maybe we should consider the loss
of Dukakis, despite a 17 point lead in

the polls during the summer of 1988, as
a poetic anti-climax to the decade.
Who really knows how we can close
out the 1980s? Just when you thought
it was safe to call it quits, poof! Another
blunder appears. One thing is for sure.
The 1980s (and hopefully Jason) must
end on December 31, 1989.
Unfortunately, the same question
arises when we consider the end of either
"Friday the 13th" or the yuppie-infested
1980s. What can we replace them with?
More importantly, how can people fall
prey to religious leaders again and again?
Reverend Moon is Jimmy Swaggart is
Jim Bakker. Why is the same issue which
Roe v. Wade solved so eloquently return
ing to the political forefront?
We have no improvements. Only sub
stitutes. Yeah, the materialism of "Dal
las" is gone, but what is it replaced with?
