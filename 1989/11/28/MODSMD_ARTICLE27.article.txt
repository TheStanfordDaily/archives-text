## Professor mixes fun with environmental concerns

What do you get when you com
bine four egg-shaped L'Eggs
panty hose covers, a calculator, a
few magnets, a Jeep and the des
olate parking lot of the Stanford
Shopping Center at midnight?
No, silly, not that. It's an
anemometer, of course — those
rotating devices that measure
wind velocity.
It crossed the mind of Civil En
gineering Prof. Gilbert Masters
one day many years ago how to
simply and cheaply build one of
those meteorological doohickeys.
So, as has always been his nature,
he started to tinker.
He used the panty hose eggs to
cause an axis to rotate as the
captured wind. Magnets closed a
switch in a cheap K-Mart calcu
lator, which in turn counted the
number of revolutions.
Masters was faced with one
problem: how to calibrate the
anemometer to determine how the
counts per minute on the calcu
lator readout corresponded to the
wind velocity.
Enter the Jeep. Attaching the
device to the top of the car, he
circled the shopping center
parking lot at various constant
speeds which corresponded to the
wind speed. When he reached a
careening 40 mph, however, his
work was rudely interrupted by a
curious Palo Alto police officer
who wanted to know just what in
the heck was going on.
Masters flipped out his faculty
ID card and said, "Research."
"The officer just laughed and
drove away," Masters recalls.
To this day, Masters still loves
to play, but these days his toys

are much more serious. The
popular professor of Civil Engi
neering 170, "Environmental Sci
ence and Technology," is much
more interested in how alternative
forms of energy, such as solar
power, can be used to thwart an
imminent energy crisis and lessen
the environmental hazards caused
by current forms of energy.
His laboratory, an unassuming
shrine to the potentials of solar
power nestled within the husky
Terman engineering laboratories,
is cluttered with various devices
that convert California's wonder
ful golden rays of sun into useful
forms of heating and cooling.
Floor-to-ceiling "direct gain"
windows on the south wall of the
lab open wide to gather in the
sun's rays, which hit "Trombe
walls" just beyond the window
and also the concrete floor. The
walls and floors are excellent heat
storage materials, so when the
outside temperature cools off, the
stored heat is released into the
room.
Concrete floors, however, are
rather unseemly in homes where
such forms of solar heating can
potentially be used. Thus Masters
and his students in CE 176 and
CE 177 are experimenting with
different floor coverings that will
allow the sun's rays to pass freely
through to the cement while sat
isfying even the most demanding
interior decorator.
High-tech gadgets are scattered
around the room for use in ob
taining measurements. Several
rather unassuming and surpris
ingly simple devices also lurk
throughout the lab, which may
have far-reaching consequences in
solar power. Masters and his stu
dents use a kerosene heater to

measure the amount of room pol
lution given off by conventional
heating devices, and a box that
resembles an air-conditioner is
really an "air-to-air filter," a
device for expelling room air pol
lution while keeping the toasty
air inside...
For those wfro don't believe in
the reality of solar devices, con
sider Masters' other laboratory,
his Menlo Park house. In 1983 he
converted his typical one-story
California flat into a model of an
energy-efficient residence,
employing many of the technolo
gies developed in his Stanford lab.
In an article published in The
Stanford Engineer magazine in
1984, he detailed the results of
his home improvements, and
wrote that his highest gas and
electricity bill ever received in his
remodeled house was $23. In the
mild months, Masters' gas bill was
only $1 per month.
Masters' latest brainchild sits
quietly in a corner of his lab, but
perhaps someday it may
revolutionize the cooking in many
Third World countries.
The problem in such countries,
he says, is that wood for cooking
is becoming scarce. Solar cookers

have been suggested for some
communities, but this would re
quire cooking during the day,
which may significantly alter the
lifestyles of other cultures. Thus
Masters is developing a solar
cooker for night use.
Masters' cooker relies on many
of the principles in use in his lab.
Photovoltaic cells, those mirror
like sheets that capture the sun's
rays and convert them into energy,
are used to heat a concrete block.
The warmed-up block is stored in
a super-insulated box during the
day, and at night is taken out to
serve as a "hot plate" for heating
food and boiling water.
Advances in the device have
been so notable that some of
Masters' experiments have been
hampered, as the heat stored in
the block was so great that it
seared some wires used in meas
urements.
Masters admits he has some
pressing questions concerning the
use of such a cooker. For example,
are remote Third World villagers
realistically going to use photovol
taic cells? The answer, in fact,
could be yes. Masters noted that
