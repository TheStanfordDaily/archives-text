"We refuse to be harmless any longer,"
claims junior Michele Nigh, the new
music director of Counterpoint. "This
year we are combining excellent musician
ship with complete craziness. don't
know wha Mte are, you will. If you do
know who we are, guess again."
Counterpoint is one of the five acap
pella singing groups on campus and has
the distinction of being the only all
female vocal ensemble. It is the second
oldest group at Stanford, tracing its
beginning back to winter quarter of 1979.
At that time the only singing group
was the Mendicants, composed of 16 men.
The time was right for a sister group to
the Mendicants to emerge, and under the

leadership of sophomores Joyce Rogers
and Linda Chin, auditions were held in
the basement of Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
By the time Manzanita Park held its
traditional Day on the Green in spring
quarter, Counterpoint was ready to make
its debut. The group's first performed
song, "Java Jive," received a standing
ovation from the picnickers on the lawn.
From its conception, Counterpoint has
been entirely student-run, a distinction
that can be both satisfying and frustrat
ing. According to Rhonda Rosales, singing
her fifth year this fall, "Because we are
self-run, we put a lot of pressure on
ourselves to be perfect. Each year I am
in the group, my expectations go up â€”
I expect this year to be fantastic."
Counterpoint does not, however, keep

its perfection to itself. Each January, the
12 women of Counterpoint join with the
Mendicants to go on a five-day tour of
Los Angeles, a tradition that began in
Counterpoint's first year. The two groups
sing at Disneyland, Magic Mountain,
Southern California college campuses,
high schools and at an annual Stanford
alumni party. Last winter, the singing
extravaganza also extended to San Diego.
In the past decade, Counterpoint and

the Mendicants have even toured together
to Hawaii, and this bond between the
two groups has led to several "Mendi
point" weddings.
In 1988 Counterpoint began changing
its image, from a musical but meek group,
to an ensemble ready to dazzle and en
tertain the Stanford community. This at
titude is reflected in the group's cassette
tape, just released in June. Entitled "Run
With It,"the tape includes traditional

songs from Counterpoint's repertoire
("Java Jive" and "Goodnight Sweet
heart"), as well as spicy arrangements of
highly-charged songs ("Love Will Keep
Us Together" and "Housework").
Last year also brought a full-house au
dience to Kresge Auditorium for a ten
year Reunion Concert. The concert
featured spots by the other four campus
a cappella groups, four Counterpoint
reunion groups and a set by the current
Counterpoint.
Counterpoint members promise even
more activity this year. Their 1989-1990
kickoff included a successful Big Game
Sing-off, held the Monday before Rig
Game. In January the group will tour
