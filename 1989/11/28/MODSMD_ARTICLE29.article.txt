The Daily announced the be
ginning of a Sunday night
movie series at Stanford to
bring "choice foreign films" to
campus. The weekly film se
ries, the precursor to Sunday
Flicks, included English,
French, German and Russian
films, with English subtitles.
They didn't get to see Mel
Gibson blast evil South
Africans back then, but then
again, they didn't have to see
"Harold and Maude" two
weeks in a row, either.

The Stanford Daily
A vote challenging a campus
dress code for women taken by
the Associated Women Stu
dents of Stanford University
failed to achieve the two-thirds
majority needed to overturn
the regulations. The regula
tions stated that women must
wear formal "Quad" clothes in
classes, libraries, laboratories,
sports events and on campus
between Memorial Auditorium
and the Post Office. The reg
ulations stated that women
passing through this last area
wearing informal clothes had
to wear long coats. Only art
students, who needed to wear
loose clothing, could wear in
formal attire to class, and then
only within an art classroom.
While 855 women voted to
change the dress policy, this
was about 100 votes short of
the two-thirds majority needed.
Now, of course, the ASSU is
thinking of adopting a dress

code which requires students in
these areas to wear the same
inside out sweats in which they
slept.

The Stanford Daily
The Executive Committee of
the Academic Council recom
mended that the Council
abolish the "activity require
ment" for graduation. The re
quirement obligated Stanford
students to participate in a cer
tain number of extra-curricular
activities in order to graduate.
Students earned one activity
credit for each quarter in which
they participated in one of
more than 50 approved campus
organizations including physi
cal education classes, band, or
chestra, student government,
student publications, tutoring
and the Axe Committee. Stu
dents could not earn more than
two activity credits for any
quarter. Students needed six
activity credits to graduate.
The report of the Executive
Committee declared that the
activity requirement had "out
lived its usefulness."
