# Police still searching for leads
## Investigation continues in exposure, attempted rape cases 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Stanford police still have no
leads in the investigation of a rash
of sex-related incidents including
17 cases of indecent exposure and
one attempted rape, Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said yesterday.
In addition, police are still in
vestigating five reports of a male
intruder defecating and loitering
in women's dormitory bathrooms.
Niemeyer said he does not be
lieve the incidents of exposure are
related to the cases of intrusion.
The 17 indecent exposure cases
have been reported since August.
At this point, the police cannot

take much further action until the
flasher or the intruder is caught
in the act, according to Niemeyer.
So far, the information obtained
by the police from the victims of
these incidents has not been par
ticularly helpful in finding the
perpetrators, he said.
Some dorms, however, have
decided to try to prevent addi
tional intrusions themselves. The
University placed locks on the
women's bathroom doors in Rob
inson House as a result of an
intrusion in one of the bathrooms,
according to Facilities Manager
Lynn Glick.
Glick said the new bathroom
locks, which fit residents' room
keys, will be placed on bathroom

doors in any dorms that request
them.
Besides Robinson, none of the
other three dorms that reported
a visit by the intruder have re
quested locks, according to Glick.
From the series of indecent ex
posures — which have occurred
all over campus in such places as
a jogging path, a road near the
Environmental Safety Facility and
most recently near Terman Engi
neering Building — the police
have compiled a description of the
flasher, Niemeyer said.
In most of the incidents, victims
described the flasher as a white
male with thick brown hair and
a bushy beard, in his mid-20s to
mid-30s. He is between 5 feet 10
inches and 6 feet tall. Police say
they are not sure whether this
man is responsible for all of the
incidents.
The police have stopped several
people fitting the description and
asked them to participate in a
lineup. However, none of the vic
tims identified any of these people
as the perpetrator.
Niemeyer said the flasher has
been difficult to apprehend be
cause he often rides a bike and

has great mobility. Although
many of the exposures have taken
place in the Foothills during
daylight hours, Niemeyer said he
has not found a definite pattern
in the location of the exposures.
Police patrols have been stepped
up all over campus in an attempt
to catch the flasher in the act.
Niemeyer said these patrols are
concentrating on open areas that
have already been hit by the flas
her.
According to Niemeyer, no one
has reported seeing the bathroom
intruder since Nov. 12. As a
result, except for the descriptions
from the earlier intrusions, the
police have no new information

to assist their investigation.
Niemeyer said the intruder
might have been a transient who
has since moved on, although
there is no direct evidence sup
porting this conclusion.
