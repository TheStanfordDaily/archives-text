## Cardinal hoopsters surge late to upend Irvine 70-57 Keefe scores 20, rebounds 11 in front of hometown crowd 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
After playing two exhibition games
and the season opener in the friendly
confines of Maples Pavilion, it would
be natural for the Cardinal men's bas
ketball team to fear the first road game
of the year.
Even last year's edition of the Cardi
nal, which was 13-0 at home, lost five
times on the road. And this year's team
has eight freshmen on the roster.
Despite all this, however, the Cardinal
kicked off the road portion of its season
on a high note last night, defeating
UC-Irvine 70-57 in Irvine.

'I told the team, 'Can we play any worse?' I told
them to relax, to play, run the offense and don't
hesitite.'

6-foot-9 and 6-7, were too much for the
shorter Anteater front line.
"We played with little confidence in
the first half," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "I told the team, 'Can
we play any worse?' I told them to relax,
to play, run the offense and don't
hesitate."
The Cardinal took the lead at 35-34
when Vlahov spun in the lane and tossed
in a four-footer. Five lead changes and
three ties later Keefe hit a pair of free
throws to give Stanford the lead for
good at 49-48.
With Keefe continuing to crash the
offensive boards and Wingate hitting
everything from a 17-footer to two two
hand slams, the Cardinal finished a 16-3
run and possessed a 61-51 lead with
two minutes, 20 seconds remaining.
Stanford hit 11-of-13 free throws down
the stretch to give the Cardinal its first
2-0 start since 1985.
"Irvine played harder than we did in
the first half," Montgomery said. "In
the second half we played strong man
to-man defense and UCI never got much
into the rhythm of its offense. We re
ceived excellent play from the bench,
particularly Wingate, who gave us a big
lift."
In addition to scoring a career-high
19, Wingate hit on 8-of-9 shots from
the field and made all three of his free
throws.
Keefe, who has 41 points and 20
rebounds in the two regulation games,
had the opportunity to play in front of
his parents and friends in his home
town. Keefe trained with a couple of
the Irvine players this summer and at
tends the same church as Anteater
Coach Bill Mulligan. He showed them
no mercy last night.
After committing six turnovers in the
first half, Keefe committed none in the
second and made 6-of-ll shots, 4-of-4
free throws and pulled down seven
rebounds while playing the entire sec
ond half. Keefe played 38 of the 40
minutes in the game and showed little

Stanford started slowly but gradually
pulled away from Irvine in the second
half as forward Adam Keefe had 16 of
his 20 points after intermission.
Forward Deshon Wingate added a
career-high 19 points in addition to his
six rebounds and forward Andrew
Vlahov pumped in 14 points to move
Stanford's record to 2-0. The Anteaters
fell to 0-2.
The game, much like Stanford's
opener against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
Friday night, began very slowly. In the
first half it seemed at times like the
two teams were going back and forth,
trading turnovers. At one point there
were five consecutive turnovers without
either team even taking a shot.
Vlahov scored the first three field
goals of the game to give Stanford a
6-1 lead but turnovers and missed shots
hurt the Cardinal. Irvine strung to
gether 21 points while holding Stanford
to a mere six but the Cardinal came
back from that 22-12 deficit.
Wingate hit a short turn-around and
was fouled. The free throw cut the An
teater lead to seven and Stanford ended
up coming all the way back to a 24-24
tie just before the half.
Irvine got two baskets right before
the half, however, to give the Anteaters
a 28-24 lead.
Stanford had 12 turnovers in the first
half and shot only 35.5 percent but was
able to stay in the game by outrebound
ine Irvine 2Q-14. Keefe and Vlahov, at

signs of the thigh bruise that has both
ered him the last two weeks.
Point guard John Patrick also had a
good game for the Cardinal. He had a
career-high 13 points, pulled down five
boards and dished out a career-best six
assists. He, like Wingate, also played
without committing a single foul.
The only other down note, aside from
the turnovers, is the fact that Stanford
hit only l-of-10 three-point shots. The
two are actually related, as the Cardi
nal's inability to hit the outside shot
allowed the Irvine defense to crowd in
and pack the passing lanes, forcing
many steals.
For Irvine, small forward Jeff
Herdman went 0-for-4 from trifecta ter
ritory after hitting better than 51 per
cent of his threes last year. Justin An
derson also continued his slump as he
was l-for-5. He missed all seven shots
he took in the Anteaters' opener Satur
day night.
Point guard Rod Palmer led the team
with 18 points, including four three
pointers, and Herdman had 11.
Stanford now turns its thoughts back
to Maples Pavilion where the Apple In
vitational will be played this Friday and
Saturday nights. Stanford opens the
tournament against Lehigh at 6:30 Fri
day night, and that game will be fol
lowed by a contest between Louisiana
Tech and Southern Methodist.
The consolation game will be at 6:30
p.m. Saturday with the championship
game at 8:30 p.m.
Card notes
How well did Stanford rebound last night?
The Cardinal had 15 offensive rebounds,
compared to 13 defensive rebounds for the
Anteaters. That means Stanford out
rebounded Irvine in Irvine's end. Overall,
the Cardinal won the rebounding war 42-28.
Anderson's sister, Kami Anderson, was in
the crowd of 2,986 last night. The Stanford
graduate probably had a difficult time trying
to decide whether to root for her brother's
team or for the school where she played four
years of basketball.

boards and dished out a career-best six
assists. He, like Wingate, also played
without committing a single foul.
The only other down note, aside from
the turnovers, is the fact that Stanford
hit only l-of-10 three-point shots. The
two are actually related, as the Cardi
nal's inability to hit the outside shot
allowed the Irvine defense to crowd in
and pack the passing lanes, forcing
many steals.
For Irvine, small forward Jeff
Herdman went 0-for-4 from trifecta ter
ritory after hitting better than 51 per
cent of his threes last year. Justin An
derson also continued his slump as he
was l-for-5. He missed all seven shots
he took in the Anteaters' opener Satur
day night.
Point guard Rod Palmer led the team
with 18 points, including four three
pointers, and Herdman had 11.
Stanford now turns its thoughts back
to Maples Pavilion where the Apple In
vitational will be played this Friday and
Saturday nights. Stanford opens the
tournament against Lehigh at 6:30 Fri
day night, and that game will be fol
lowed by a contest between Louisiana
Tech and Southern Methodist.
The consolation game will be at 6:30
p.m. Saturday with the championship
game at 8:30 p.m.
Card notes
How well did Stanford rebound last night?
The Cardinal had 15 offensive rebounds,
compared to 13 defensive rebounds for the
Anteaters. That means Stanford out
rebounded Irvine in Irvine's end. Overall,
the Cardinal won the rebounding war 42-28.
Anderson's sister, Kami Anderson, was in
the crowd of 2,986 last night. The Stanford
graduate probably had a difficult time trying
to decide whether to root for her brother's
team or for the school where she played four
years of basketball.

After playing two exhibition games
and the season opener in the friendly
confines of Maples Pavilion, it would
be natural for the Cardinal men's bas
ketball team to fear the first road game
of the year.
Even last year's edition of the Cardi
nal, which was 13-0 at home, lost five
times on the road. And this year's team
has eight freshmen on the roster.
Despite all this, however, the Cardinal
kicked off the road portion of its season
on a high note last night, defeating
UC-Irvine 70-57 in Irvine.

'I told the team, 'Can we play any worse?' I told
them to relax, to play, run the offense and don't
hesitite.'

6-foot-9 and 6-7, were too much for the
shorter Anteater front line.
"We played with little confidence in
the first half," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "I told the team, 'Can
we play any worse?' I told them to relax,
to play, run the offense and don't
hesitate."
The Cardinal took the lead at 35-34
when Vlahov spun in the lane and tossed
in a four-footer. Five lead changes and
three ties later Keefe hit a pair of free
throws to give Stanford the lead for
good at 49-48.
With Keefe continuing to crash the
offensive boards and Wingate hitting
everything from a 17-footer to two two
hand slams, the Cardinal finished a 16-3
run and possessed a 61-51 lead with
two minutes, 20 seconds remaining.
Stanford hit 11-of-13 free throws down
the stretch to give the Cardinal its first
2-0 start since 1985.
"Irvine played harder than we did in
the first half," Montgomery said. "In
the second half we played strong man
to-man defense and UCI never got much
into the rhythm of its offense. We re
ceived excellent play from the bench,
particularly Wingate, who gave us a big
lift."
In addition to scoring a career-high
19, Wingate hit on 8-of-9 shots from
the field and made all three of his free
throws.
Keefe, who has 41 points and 20
rebounds in the two regulation games,
had the opportunity to play in front of
his parents and friends in his home
town. Keefe trained with a couple of
the Irvine players this summer and at
tends the same church as Anteater
Coach Bill Mulligan. He showed them
no mercy last night.
After committing six turnovers in the
first half, Keefe committed none in the
second and made 6-of-ll shots, 4-of-4
free throws and pulled down seven
rebounds while playing the entire sec
ond half. Keefe played 38 of the 40
minutes in the game and showed little

Stanford started slowly but gradually
pulled away from Irvine in the second
half as forward Adam Keefe had 16 of
his 20 points after intermission.
Forward Deshon Wingate added a
career-high 19 points in addition to his
six rebounds and forward Andrew
Vlahov pumped in 14 points to move
Stanford's record to 2-0. The Anteaters
fell to 0-2.
The game, much like Stanford's
opener against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
Friday night, began very slowly. In the
first half it seemed at times like the
two teams were going back and forth,
trading turnovers. At one point there
were five consecutive turnovers without
either team even taking a shot.
Vlahov scored the first three field
goals of the game to give Stanford a
6-1 lead but turnovers and missed shots
hurt the Cardinal. Irvine strung to
gether 21 points while holding Stanford
to a mere six but the Cardinal came
back from that 22-12 deficit.
Wingate hit a short turn-around and
was fouled. The free throw cut the An
teater lead to seven and Stanford ended
up coming all the way back to a 24-24
tie just before the half.
Irvine got two baskets right before
the half, however, to give the Anteaters
a 28-24 lead.
Stanford had 12 turnovers in the first
half and shot only 35.5 percent but was
able to stay in the game by outrebound
ine Irvine 2Q-14. Keefe and Vlahov, at

signs of the thigh bruise that has both
ered him the last two weeks.
Point guard John Patrick also had a
good game for the Cardinal. He had a
career-high 13 points, pulled down five
boards and dished out a career-best six
assists. He, like Wingate, also played
without committing a single foul.
