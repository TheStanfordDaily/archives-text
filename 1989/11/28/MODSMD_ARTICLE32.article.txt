# Heisman voters beWare! Rice should make room for Andre
## 
### 
About this time of year college foot
ball always gets a little weird.
A great deal of attention goes to
the teams selected to play in the top bowl
games. Usually there is one game that
most people think will decide the national
title, but it's never cut and dried.
Some other team somewhere else tries
to convince the public that if it can beat
Dog-Catching University in the Mustard
Bowl, it deserves to be No. 1.
In this regard, this year is even more
unusual. Even Florida State, a team with
two losses, is thinking that if all the right
things happen, it could take the national
championship.
Similar to the jockeying for the na
tional title, this is also the time players
make their final moves in the Heisman
Trophy race. Unlike past years, there is
no clear winner this season, at least as
far as people are letting on.
Coming into the season, Notre Dame
quarterback Tony Rice appeared to have
the inside track. After leading the Irish
to a 12-0 season last year, Rice was
known as a winner and a great team
leader.

After Notre Dame got off to a great
start this year in winning the team's first
11 games, most people still loved Tony
Rice. But they were too busy looking at
the big picture to notice the major flaws
in Rice's game.
Nobody in Division I college football
has as successful a team as Rice
has had over the past two years.
But giving a man the Heisman for that
would set a bad precedent. In addition
to Rice, there are 10 other guys on the

field working their tails off and none of
them have a shot at the award.
When it comes right down to it, how
ever, Rice just isn't a great player. He is
a good running quarterback but is not
as good as Air Force's Dee Dowis. And
when it comes to passing the ball, well,
look out.
Rice has rarely demonstrated the abil
ity to hit an open receiver but he still
has delusions when he thinks he can
whip the ball into triple coverage for an
easy completion. The result is often a
batted-down pass at best or an intercep
tion at worst.
The true mark of a great player is his
ability to rise to the occasion in the big
games. Given the opportunity to do just
that against Miami over the weekend,
Rice failed. Instead, the Hurricanes bat
tered the Irish 27-10, and the Notre Dame
offense couldn't figure out how to score.
The Irish's lone touchdown came on
an interception return by Ned Bolcar,
and the field goal came after the officials
blew a fumble call and allowed Notre
Dame to keep the ball on the Miami 2.
Thus, if there's any justice, Rice will

meet the same fate as last year's early
front-runners, Troy Aikman and Rodney
Peete. Both were way out in front in the
hype race last year before Barry Sanders
let his numbers do the walking.
Duplicating Sanders' performance
of last year, Andre Ware has put
up numbers that cannot be ig
nored. Despite a lack of preseason hype,
NCAA probation and no televised games,
Ware's passing at the University of Hous
ton has turned heads everywhere.

A typical day for Ware this season has
been to go out and pass for about 300
yards and three or four touchdowns. In
the first half. Then he'll throw a couple
more touchdowns in the second half
before being pulled because the score got
out of hand.
Ware would usually finish with about
480 yards passing and five touchdowns
in a 40-point win. While there is certainly
no lack of qualified candidates, Ware has
simply had the best year of any college
football player.
West Virginia's Harris and In
diana's Anthony Thompson are listed as
the top threats to Ware along with Rice.
While those two are both tremendous
football players, they have not done what
Ware does each and every week.
The Heisman has never before gone to
a player from a school on probation, but
now's a good time to start. If not, let's
put the voters on probation.

Trophy race. Unlike past years, there is
no clear winner this season, at least as
far as people are letting on.
Coming into the season, Notre Dame
quarterback Tony Rice appeared to have
the inside track. After leading the Irish
to a 12-0 season last year, Rice was
known as a winner and a great team
leader.

After Notre Dame got off to a great
start this year in winning the team's first
11 games, most people still loved Tony
Rice. But they were too busy looking at
the big picture to notice the major flaws
in Rice's game.
Nobody in Division I college football
has as successful a team as Rice
has had over the past two years.
But giving a man the Heisman for that
would set a bad precedent. In addition
to Rice, there are 10 other guys on the

field working their tails off and none of
them have a shot at the award.
When it comes right down to it, how
ever, Rice just isn't a great player. He is
a good running quarterback but is not
as good as Air Force's Dee Dowis. And
when it comes to passing the ball, well,
look out.
Rice has rarely demonstrated the abil
ity to hit an open receiver but he still
has delusions when he thinks he can
whip the ball into triple coverage for an
easy completion. The result is often a
batted-down pass at best or an intercep
tion at worst.
The true mark of a great player is his
ability to rise to the occasion in the big
games. Given the opportunity to do just
that against Miami over the weekend,
Rice failed. Instead, the Hurricanes bat
tered the Irish 27-10, and the Notre Dame
offense couldn't figure out how to score.
The Irish's lone touchdown came on
an interception return by Ned Bolcar,
and the field goal came after the officials
blew a fumble call and allowed Notre
Dame to keep the ball on the Miami 2.
Thus, if there's any justice, Rice will

meet the same fate as last year's early
front-runners, Troy Aikman and Rodney
Peete. Both were way out in front in the
hype race last year before Barry Sanders
let his numbers do the walking.
Duplicating Sanders' performance
of last year, Andre Ware has put
up numbers that cannot be ig
nored. Despite a lack of preseason hype,
NCAA probation and no televised games,
Ware's passing at the University of Hous
ton has turned heads everywhere.

A typical day for Ware this season has
been to go out and pass for about 300
yards and three or four touchdowns. In
the first half. Then he'll throw a couple
more touchdowns in the second half
before being pulled because the score got
out of hand.
Ware would usually finish with about
480 yards passing and five touchdowns
in a 40-point win. While there is certainly
no lack of qualified candidates, Ware has
simply had the best year of any college
football player.
West Virginia's Harris and In
diana's Anthony Thompson are listed as
the top threats to Ware along with Rice.
While those two are both tremendous
football players, they have not done what
Ware does each and every week.
The Heisman has never before gone to
a player from a school on probation, but
now's a good time to start. If not, let's
put the voters on probation.

Crader is the senior sports editor of The
Daily. He's picking Glyn Milburn for the
1991 Heisman.
