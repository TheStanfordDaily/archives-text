# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Thanksgiving finds most — even the na
tion's best athletes — lounging around the
dinner table stuffing themselves with turkey
and all the trimmings. This week's winners,
however, did a lot more than shove down
the Stove-Top.
Indeed, Trisha Stevens of the women's
basketball team and Mark Funseth of the

men's golf team led their respective teams
to impressive victories over the Thanksgiv
ing weekend.
Stevens, a 6-foot-3 center from Philomath,
Ore., spearheaded a potent Cardinal offense
with 20 points against Ohio University in
the finals of the Communiplex National Hall
of Fame Classic. She also had 10 rebounds,
recording a double-double and helping the
Cardinal shellack the Bobcats 113-65.
Despite scoring 34 points and grabbing
14 rebounds in the two games the Cardinal
played in Cincinnati, Stevens did not make
the all-tournament team. Senior Jennifer
Azzi and junior Sonja Henning both were
given that honor. Stevens was just too
good to be ignored.

Funseth, a native of Napa, Calif., led the
Cardinal linksters to consecutive tourna
ment titles at the UCLA Bruin Desert Classic
and Rice Invitational this past week.
The senior tamed the demanding Mission
Hills hotel course with a one-under par 69
in the opening round of the UCLA tourney
and ended up finishing 11th. His play helped
secure Stanford's six-shot victory over
Oregon.
In addition, his blistering rounds of 72-
72-73 placed him second individually at the
Rice Invite. Led by Funseth, the Cardinal
finished six shots ahead of runner-up Baylor.
In its last four events, the men's golf team
has posted three victories and a second-place

finish. Along with Funseth, sophomore
Christian Cevaer and junior Johan Rem
melgas should lead the Cardinal to continued
success in the 1990 campaign.
