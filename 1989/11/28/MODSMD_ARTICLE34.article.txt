SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Mike Cofer, given a reprieve by a
penalty, kicked a 45-yard field goal
with 4:12 remaining Monday
night to put the San Francisco
49ers ahead to stay in a 34-24
victory over the New York Giants.
Cofer had missed badly from
50 yards, but got a second chance
because New York's Reyna
Thompson lined up offside.
Joe Montana threw three touch
down passes, Pierce Holt had four
of seven sacks and the San Fran
cisco defense forced five turnovers
as the 49ers took the inside track
to the homefield advantage in the
NFC playoffs by winning the
matchup of teams with 9-2
records.
The Giants, boasting the stin
giest defense in the conference
(allowing 16 points per game),
permitted Montana to improve his
league-leading 70 percent comple
tion rate, hitting 27 of 33 passes
for 292 yards. Montana's scoring
passes were in the first half as
the defending Super Bowl cham
pions moved to a 24-7 lead.
But Phil SimmB brought the
Giants back, engineering two
second-half touchdown drives and
New York eventually tied the score

at 24 midway through the final
period.
After Cofer's field goal, how
ever, Simms was intercepted for
the third time on the night, by
Eric Wright, setting up Tom Rath
man's 1-yard insurance TD with
1:08 remaining.
The loss leaves the Giants a
game in front of Philadelphia in
the East entering Sunday's game
against the Eagles at the
Meadowlands. The 49ers boosted
their hopes of gaining the
homefield advantage throughout
the playoffs and retained a two
game lead over the Los Angeles
Rams in the West. They play in
Los Angeles on Dec. 11.
Simms was 25 of 48 for 326
yards.
The mistake-prone 49ers nearly
fumbled away the game in the
second half in a manner similar
to their collapse against the
Giants nearly three years ago. In
a Monday night game in Candle
stick Park on Dec. 1, 1986, New
York overcame a 17-0 halftime
deficit with three third-period
touchdowns for a 21-17 victory,
and this second half seemed like
a rerun.
Rookie David Meggett took a
swing pass from Simms, raced
through the secondary and
slipped a tackle by Chet Biard
Brooks at the 15 as he completed
a 53-yard scoring play to cut the
lead to 24-17.
When Carl Banks slapped the
ball out of Montana's hands and
defensive end John Washington
recovered at the New York 13,
the Giants had a chance to tie it.
But long-time Giant Jim Burt, a
recent 49er pickup to shore up
the nose tackle in Michael Carter's
absence, forced a fumble by Meg
gett to kill one threat, and Brooks'
interception of a Simms pass at
the 49ers' 1 with 11:40 left in the
game wiped out another.
The Giants finally drew even

with 7:06 left after Banks ham
mered Mike Wilson and Mark Col
lins recovered at the San Fran
cisco 30. Disdaining a field goal
on 4th-and-goal from the 7,
Simms lofted the tying pass to
Odessa Turner in the left corner
of the end zone.
Montana dissected the defense
on an 80-yard drive to open the
game, rolling out and finding
John Taylor in the right rear cor
ner of the end zone on a 4-yard
play after cornerback Collins had
slipped. Those were the first
points New York had allowed on
an opponent's first drive all
season.
Montana gave San Francisco
the lead for good late in the first
quarter, three plays after Spencer
Tillman's 60-yard kickoff return
down the right sideline. He tossed
to Jerry Rice on the 3 and Rice
ducked under Terry Kinard's
tackle for a 4-yard TD play to

make it 14-7.
Cofer's 44-yard field goal and
Montana's 17-yard TD pass over
the middle to Brent Jones made
it 24-7 with 5:29 left in the half
before New York rallied.
The Giants' only first-half
points were the result of gifts by
the 49ers, who made four turn
overs in losing to Green Bay a
week ago.
Ottis Anderson bulled in from
2 yards out for his ninth touch
down one play after Darryl Pol
lard was called for roughing
kicker Bjorn Nittmo on a 22-yard
field goal.
The 49ers were driving again
when Greg Cox sacked Montana
at the New York 41 and recovered
his fumble. Nittmo, the rookie out
of Appalachian State on emer
gency duty for the injured Raul
Allegre, kicked a wobbly 39-yard
field goal to make it 24-10 at
halftime.
