SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Mike Cofer, given a reprieve by a
penalty, kicked a 45-yard field goal
with 4:12 remaining Monday
night to put the San Francisco
49ers ahead to stay in a 34-24
victory over the New York Giants.
Cofer had missed badly from
50 yards, but got a second chance
because New York's Reyna
Thompson lined up offside.
Joe Montana threw three touch
down passes, Pierce Holt had four
of seven sacks and the San Fran
cisco defense forced five turnovers
as the 49ers took the inside track
to the homefield advantage in the
NFC playoffs by winning the
matchup of teams with 9-2
records.
The Giants, boasting the stin
giest defense in the conference
(allowing 16 points per game),
permitted Montana to improve his
league-leading 70 percent comple
tion rate, hitting 27 of 33 passes
for 292 yards. Montana's scoring
passes were in the first half as
the defending Super Bowl cham
pions moved to a 24-7 lead.
But Phil SimmB brought the
Giants back, engineering two
second-half touchdown drives and
New York eventually tied the score

at 24 midway through the final
period.
After Cofer's field goal, how
ever, Simms was intercepted for
the third time on the night, by
Eric Wright, setting up Tom Rath
man's 1-yard insurance TD with
1:08 remaining.
The loss leaves the Giants a
game in front of Philadelphia in
the East entering Sunday's game
against the Eagles at the
Meadowlands. The 49ers boosted
their hopes of gaining the
homefield advantage throughout
the playoffs and retained a two
game lead over the Los Angeles
Rams in the West. They play in
Los Angeles on Dec. 11.
Simms was 25 of 48 for 326
yards.
The mistake-prone 49ers nearly
fumbled away the game in the
second half in a manner similar
to their collapse against the
Giants nearly three years ago. In
a Monday night game in Candle
stick Park on Dec. 1, 1986, New
York overcame a 17-0 halftime
deficit with three third-period
touchdowns for a 21-17 victory,
and this second half seemed like
a rerun.
