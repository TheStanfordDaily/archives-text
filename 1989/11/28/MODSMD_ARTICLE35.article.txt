# Spikers blast Hawaii four times
## Men's volleyball has shot at No. 1 preseason national ranking 
### 
The men's volleyball team spent
Thanksgiving feasting in the
Hawaiian islands. But turkey was
not the only thing Stanford
spikers devoured.
Indeed, after beating defending
national champion UCLA in five
games Nov. 11, Stanford contin
ued to munch on top-ranked com
petition with a four-match anni
hilation of the University of
Hawaii.
In the first of the four matches
Nov. 20 in Hilo, Hawaii, Stanford
blew past the Rainbows in three
straight games. The next meeting
Nov. 22 in Hana, Maui, saw Stan
ford edge the Rainbows in five.
After the close match, the Cardi
nal started rolling again, dominat
ing Hawaii in four games Nov. 24
and in three Nov. 25.
"We played intelligent volleyball
over the week," junior setter Ryan

On the second night, we had to put up with
some horrendous hometown referees, but we
kept out heads in the match.'

O'Hara said. "On the second
night, we had to put up with some
horrendous hometown referees,
but we kept out heads in the
match and eventually prevailed."
After losing to Stanford last
year, Hawaii placed third in the
Western Regional. The Cardinal
went on to finish second in NCAA
tournament, losing a close contest
to UCLA in the finals.
According to O'Hara, all 12
players contributed to the success
ful road trip. Sophomore Duncan
Blackman had an especially good
showing, establishing himself as
one of the most consistent and

reliable hitters on the team. De
spite frequent double commits by
the Hawaiian blockers, senior Ail-
American Dan Hanan also played
well, showing why he is considered
by some to be the nation's best
collegiate volleyball player.
The Cardinal, by virtue of its
excellent showings in the
preseason, should be a favorite to
take the NCAA title in 1990.
"After having beat the two of
the top three teams from last
season, I feel we have an excellent
chance at No. 1 in the preseason
polls," O'Hara said.
