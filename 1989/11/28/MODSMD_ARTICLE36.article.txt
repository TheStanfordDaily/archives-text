# Masters to decide No. 1 ranking
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Boris Becker and Ivan Lendl
both believe the Masters tennis tournament will
have a strong bearing on this year's No. 1 ranking.
The year-ending, eight-player tournament at
Madison Square Garden begins Tuesday night. Fol
lowing four nights of round robin play, the semi
finals will be held Saturday afternoon and the final
on Sunday.
No matter what happens on the court, Lendl will
retain the top spot in the computer rankings, some
thing both he and Becker believe is wrong.
"The Grand Slam is the most important thing,"
Becker said Monday. "And I've won two of them
and was in the semifinals at one. I beat Ivan in
two of them. To me, it's clear (who's No. 1)."
Becker won Wimbledon for the third time and
his first U.S. Open in 1989. He ousted Lendl in
the semifinals at Wimbledon and beat him in the
U.S. Open title match.
"If Boris won this tournament, very clearly he
would be No. 1 in my mind, and he would be No.
1 in your mind," said Lendl, who has won 10 titles
this year. "The question is if he doesn't win and I
win, what is going to happen then?
"Normally I would say that he should be consid
ered the best player because he won Wimbledon
and the U.S. Open, which are the two biggest tour
naments.
"On the other hand, in '86 I won two Grand
Slam tournaments and he won one, and he won
more tournaments during the year than I did. I
kept reading articles saying if he won the Masters,
he should be No. 1. So, unless there are double
standards, you should keep that option open."
While Becker is the defending champion, Lendl
has reached the final at the last nine Masters,

winning five, two more than John McEnroe, who
also is in the field.
And, like Lendl, McEnroe once ruled as the world's
top-ranked player. Perhaps not suprisingly, Lendl
and McEnroe aren't as enamored with the computer
ranking as Becker, who never has been higher than
No. 2.
"It's probably much more important to Boris if
he can be No. 1 than to me because I have been
there before, and I have other priorities in my
career right now," Lendl said.
McEnroe, making his first Masters appearance
since January 1986, agrees with his longtime foe.
"I'm not sure I want to be No. 1 at this point,"
the left-hander said. "If I win some tournaments,
win a major and my outlook on tennis and life is
improving, I could live without being No. 1 very
easily.
"I was No. 2 in 1980 and 1981 when (Bjorn)
Borg was No. 1, and those were two of the most
eryoyable years of my life."
Third-ranked Stefan Edberg of Sweden and Andre
Agassi battle to begin the tournament, followed by
Lendl against French Open champion Michael Chang
and Becker against Brad Gilbert.
On Wednesday, McEnroe will play Aaron Krick
stein, Becker meets Agassi and Edberg takes on
Gilbert. Thursday's matches will pit Lendl against
Krickstein, McEnroe against Chang and Agassi
against Gilbert, while Edberg plays Becker, Lendl
plays McEnroe and Chang plays Krickstein Friday.
Each player receives $15,000 for qualifying and
$30,000 for each round robin victory. The winning
semifinals collect $60,000 each and the champion
an additional $150,000. A player who wins the title
undefeated would pocket $315,000.
