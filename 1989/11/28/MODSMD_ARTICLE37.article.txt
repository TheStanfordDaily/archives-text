# Golfers take sixth in desert
## Women linksters still locking to break into nation's elite 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
As the curtain falls on the
fall season of the women's golf
team, the hopes of capturing a
lead role among the sport's elite
have gone one largely unful
filled.
The women's team concluded
its fall campaign with a sixth
place finish at last week's UCLA
Intercollegiate in Palm Springs.
The team's performance in
the Bruin Desert Classic is in
dicative of its play throughout
the last three months. The Car
dinal linksters have played con
sistent golf yet have been unable
to gain a place among the na
tional collegiate powers.
Stanford began the year
ranked eighth in the country
and has maintained that posi
tion by securing top-ten finishes
in each of its four tournaments.
One need only look at the five
schools that bested the Cardinal
last week to realize the arduous
task the squad faces in improv
ing its national ranking.
Victorious Oklahoma State,
Arizona State, Arizona, San
Jose State and defending na
tional champion Tulsa com
prised a leading pack which
finished within 20 strokes of the
lead. Stanford, conversely, was
an additional 20 shots off the
pace.
Coach Tim Baldwin conceded
that, for now, his team can only
claim a fringe membership to
golfs elite.
"We're just slightly behind
them right now. We know we
have a lot of work to get to that
level" he said.
The team can find solace in
its triumph over the University
of Georgia, currently the No. 1
squad in the nation. The Car
dinal finished eight shots ahead
of the Bulldogs.
The quest for admission to
the game's inner circle might be
facilitated by the revival of fine
play from junior Jodi Figley.
Figley's steady rounds of 77-
77-79 in Palm Springs marked
a needed recovery from an in
consistent season and placed her
19th individually.

Baldwin hoped that Figley
could serve as a catalyst for con
tinued success in the winter.
"Jodi's back on her game,
which will bode well for us the
rest of the season," he said.
The team also will rely on
excellent play from sophomore
Audrey Wooding. Baldwin em
phasized that her "very steady
performances" were a crucial
factor in the Cardinal's drive for
national prominence.
Wooding was confident that
the team could contend with the
game's national powers.

"I think we have a realistic
chance of competing with the
best. All it will take is putting
together some consistent
rounds," she said.
In addition, Stanford will
depend on the return of Adele
Moore.
After enjoying a marvelous
freshman season, Moore has fal
len victim to somewhat of a
"sophomore slump." Her two
under-par 72 on day two at
UCLA raised expectations that
she will return to her first year
form.
