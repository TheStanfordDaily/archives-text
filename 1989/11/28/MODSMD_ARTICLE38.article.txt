# For the record
## 
### 
In a story preview on the front
page last Wednesday, The Daily
inaccurately reported that Salva
doran rebels had gunned down
tourists in a hotel. The rebels held
the tourists hostage in the hotel
but did not harm them. Though
the preview was inaccurate, the
story on page three correctly re
ported the facts.
