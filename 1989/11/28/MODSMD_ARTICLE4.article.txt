# Experts excited, optimistic about change in Czechoslovakia

### Jim Ron Editorial staff 
Stanford and Hoover Institution ex
perts reacted to the swiftly unfolding
drama in Czechoslovakia with excitement
and optimism yesterday and predicted
far-reaching reforms in one of Eastern
Europe's last Communist regimes to cave
in to pressure for democratic change.
"There will be open elections within a
year," predicted Jan Triska, a
Czechoslovakian-born professor emeritus
of political science.

Triska was in Czechoslovakia in 1968
arranging a student-exchange program
between Stanford and the University of
Prague when Soviet tanks crushed Czech
attempts at reform.
Triska said the huge demonstrations
for democratic change in Prague during
the last few days have been "so terribly
moving . . . especially the television (news
broadcasts). It is so genuine."
Triska predicted that a gradual
strengthening of the liberal elements in
the Communist Party will be followed by

the acceptance into the government of
opposition groups such as the Civic
Forum, an ad hoc group of dissident in
tellectuals including Alexander Dubcek,
who led the reform government in 1968.
Triska is in constant telephone contact
with friends and relatives in his native
country and is following events as they
unfold by the hour on Czech shortwave
news broadcasts.
"The broadcasts, as of four days ago,
are markedly different," he said, referring
to the lifting of media censorship, a sig

nificant concession to the pressures for
change sweeping the country.
Richard Staar, coordinator of the In
ternational Studies Program at the Hoo
ver Institution, emphasized that as long
as constant pressure in the streets is
maintained, the momentum for change
will continue.
"The demonstrators are not stopping,"
he said. According to Staar, they realize
that Kark Urbanek, who was chosen as
party General Secretary Friday, is not
progressive. "He is a product of the sys

tem," Staar said.
The rapidity of events in Eastern Eu
rope has taken Stanford experts by
surprise.
"History moves more quickly than
anyone can predict," said Norman
Naimark, a professor of 20th century
Eastern European history.
Naimark said events in East Germany,
a nation similar to Czechoslovakia in
terms of industrial development and rel-
ative economic well-being, played
a role in motivating Czechs
to brave the threat of police
brutality and take to the streets
to demand reforms.
"East Germany fell apart in
three weeks," he said. "For
Czechs, it then seemed possible

to change, because East Germany
is so like them."
Triska added that the Soviet
Union, somewhat ironically, has
been instrumental in initiating the
Czech government's retreat.
He said the Soviet ambassador
to Czechoslovakia, Victor
Lamakin, met a week ago with
then-Communist Party General
Secretary Milos Jakesh, a conser
vative stalwart, and

"recommended" changes be in
stituted.
"These Eastern European
regimes are a house of cards,"
Triska added, emphasizing that
without Soviet support, the old
guard cannot survive.
Comparing the Czech upheaval
to that of Poland, Triska said the
Czech reformists were led by in
tellectuals, not workers, as was
the case in Poland.
