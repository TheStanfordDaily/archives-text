The shooting took place between
the Palace of Justice and a build
ing across the street in the center
of Bogota, Colombia. The army
held the building. The palace was
held by the guerrilla group M-19,
which had seized it in a violent
assault earlier that day, Nov. 6,
1985.
A 22-year-old Colombian televi
sion intern and her camera crew
were running between the build
ings, trying to get an exclusive
angle for the report — her first
— that evening.
They were refused entrance to
the army-held building. The in
tern pleaded with the soldier at
the door. "We are from television,"

"the language" of images. She
managed to land an internship
with Bogota's "24 Horas," Colom
bia's best news station, she says.
Munoz Rocha was offered a job
with the station after her intern
ship, but her family was leaving
the country and she had a senior
thesis to finish for her degree.
She remained in Colombia, alone
for the first time, working part
time while she completed her
studies.
Soon, however, she returned to
