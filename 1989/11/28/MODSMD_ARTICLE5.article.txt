The shooting took place between
the Palace of Justice and a build
ing across the street in the center
of Bogota, Colombia. The army
held the building. The palace was
held by the guerrilla group M-19,
which had seized it in a violent
assault earlier that day, Nov. 6,
1985.
A 22-year-old Colombian televi
sion intern and her camera crew
were running between the build
ings, trying to get an exclusive
angle for the report — her first
— that evening.
They were refused entrance to
the army-held building. The in
tern pleaded with the soldier at
the door. "We are from television,"
she said. "If you don't let us in,
all your life you will know that
because you didn't open this door,
three people died here today."
The soldier let them in.
Sitting on a bench near her Es
condido Village apartment, that
young intern, Claudia Munoz
Rocha, recalls her first assign
ment. "It wasn't just a college in
ternship to me," she says."It was
my life, and it was the proof I
needed that I wanted to become
a journalist."

Munoz Rocha is now a student
of North American media in the
Communication Department's
journalism masters' program.
Her harrowing introduction to
television reporting began in
auspiciously. As a college senior
at Bogota's Universidad
Haveriana in November 1985,
Munoz Rocha needed a month
long internship to complete her
studies.
She chose television, she says,
because she enjoys working with
"the language" of images. She
managed to land an internship
with Bogota's "24 Horas," Colom
bia's best news station, she says.
Munoz Rocha was offered a job
with the station after her intern
ship, but her family was leaving
the country and she had a senior
thesis to finish for her degree.
She remained in Colombia, alone
for the first time, working part
time while she completed her
studies.
Soon, however, she returned to
"24 Horas" as a full-time national
security reporter and Colombian
correspondent for the Atlanta
based Cable News Network's
weekend foreign news program,
"World Report."
The middle of three sisters,
Munoz Rocha says she is very
close to her family. This closeness

ficult times, but causes her worry
as well, she says. Journalism in
Colombia is a calling with a very
low life-expectancy.
"My family supports me be
cause they know I love what I
do," she says. "But for them it is
hard, knowing that something can
happen to me."
She tries to call her family from
wherever she is on assignment,
but there are times when contact
is impossible, she says.
While she was reporting on
drug trafficking in the Colombian
province of Arauco, Munoz
Rocha's life was threatened. She
believed the local government was
involved and knew that her phone
calls were being monitored.
"I didn't want to call home,"
she says, "because then they
would have my number."
At Stanford, she continues to
report for "24 Horas," filing

reports on life here for her viewers
back home. She wants to show
Colombians "the real United
States," and is planning a story
on a San Francisco AIDS fund
raising project, a look at Latino
targeted alcohol advertising and a
profile of baseball's Jose Canseco.
Munoz Rocha says her return
to university studies has been dif
ficult, not only in interrupting her
professional life, but also in forc
ing her to think, and especially
write, in a language she is "not
entirely comfortable with yet."
But she loves the life of a stu
dent. "I'm proud of the three
years of (professional) experience
I have, but I need time to think,
to gain perspective on my life and
my country."
If she accomplishes anything
here, Munoz Rocha says she wants
Americans to know what her
country is really like. "I want to
show America that Colombia is
not just drug trafficking and vi
olence. I want to show you our
people — our novelists, our sci
entists, our children."
