# Losing landfill access in '91
## University searches for place to dump its trash 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Stanford is waist-deep in its
own garbage, and now it's trying
to dig its way out.
The Palo Alto landfill, where
the Univerity dumps its garbage,
is closing its gates to Stanford
trash in April 1991, several years
before the 1999 date when the
site is expected to be full. The
ultimatum by the city of Palo Alto
has left University officials scram
bling to determine what to do with
the mounds of trash they will
have on their hands.
The task is not exactly trivial.
Not including the Medical Center,
Stanford produces 20,000 tons of
garbage every year, enough to fill
about 2,000 garbage trucks.
So far in the quest for a new
home for the garbage, a number
of possible solutions have sur
faced, but no University official
has yet signed on the dotted line
of any plan. Whatever plan Stan
ford accepts, University officials
say it must be cost-effective and
environmentally sound.
At present, two companies —
Peninsula Sanitary Service and
Waste Management Inc. — are
vying for rights to Stanford's
$780,000 garbage contract.

owned company that has handled
Stanford's waste for more than
three decades, is trying to con
vince University officials to build
a facility on Stanford land that
would process waste before it is
transported to a permanent dis
posal site.
Recyclable materials could be
hand-picked from the garbage,
easing environmental strain and
cutting down on the ever
increasing disposal costs the Uni
versity faces, according to Louis
Pellegrini, a vice president at Pen
insula Sanitary. Newspapers, soda
cans, plastics and construction
debris will all be removed from
the waste at the facility and
shipped to a recycler.
The state of California has
mandated that 25 percent of the
waste stream be recycled by 1995
and 50 percent be recycled by the
turn of the century. Environmen
talists say the mfyority of trash
is recyclable, but that the current
level is only a small fraction of
that.
Having an on-site sorting facil
ity, which is hailed by environ
mentalists as the most responsible
disposal method, is expected to
save the University millions of
dollars over the next few years,
according to a study performed
by Brown, Vance and Sons.
The study chose a specific site,
however, that is no longer
feasible, according to Ron Parker,
an engineer who deals with the
University's disposal options. If
an on-campus facility is built, en
gineers will have to reinitiate the
whole process of assessing costs
of a site.
"We feel that a small-scale ma
terials recovery system would be
the best, most cost-effective way
to handle the waste," Pellegrini
said. "There's no big trick to it."

The front-runner of the disposal
proposals, pushed by Waste Man
agement, is to send the garbage
to Sunnyvale to what is called a
transfer station, where garbage
will be loaded from the smaller
trucks into larger, more efficient
ones. Once loaded into the larger
trucks, the trash will be shipped
to Kirby Canyon, a dump site near
San Jose expected to last for many
more years.
The multimillion dollar transfer
station, which is in the final plan
ning stages, will mechanically sift
through the garbage to recycle as
much as possible.
The Sunnyvale site was chosen
after more than a decade of
tinkering with the idea of devel
oping a waste disposal facility as
a long-term solution to their gar
bage woes. After several years,
Stanford and several cities in
northern Santa Clara County —
including Palo Alto, Sunnyvale,
Los Altos, Cupertino and Moun
tain View — focused on a facility
to be built in the Foothills near
Cupertino.
A 1983 study of the proposed

facility, however, showed that even
though the plant was technically
and economically feasible, it was
politically impossible, according to
Tim Flanagan, an assistant re
gional manager for Waste Man
agement. In the meantime, the
cities had sunk several million dol
lars into a project that was clearly
going nowhere.
In 1987, the cities attacked the
problem with renewed vigor and
finally selected the Sunnyvale
site. Last year, Stanford and
several cities signed a memoran
dum of understanding to clarify
their intentions of building the fa
cility. Although Stanford is
leaning toward the Sunnyvale
site, it is not nailing itself down
to this option, Parker said.
On the one hand, the University
might save millions of dollars op
erating its own facility. On the
other hand, Stanford will avoid a
politically and economically risky
project by shipping its waste to
Sunnyvale.
Barbara Voss, director of Stan
ford's Recycling Center, said she
would like to see an on-campus
facility to handle the waste since

it would be more environmentally
responsible and her office could
share equipment with the sanita
tion facility.
"I think there are many
benefits to keeping it in-house,"
she said. She acknowledged, how
ever, that the Sunnyvale transfer
station is also an environmentally
sound alternative to the present
system.
Voss said an on-campus facility
would give Stanford more control
over what garbage collection
routes to take, to minimize the
time to sift through trash looking
for recyclables.
And Pellegrini of Peninsula
Sanitary said his company would
be the best to maximize the effi
ciency of the recycling. "We're
probably in the best position to
know what to do" with Stanford's
garbage, he said.
Voss also pointed to the liability
issue. Just two months ago, Stan
ford was cited for accidentally
dumping used hypodermic needles
in the Palo Alto landfill, and this
incident was not the first.
"Stanford has had problems in
the past with the Palo Alto
landfill," she said. "I think a lot
of liability issues will be solved"
by handling waste on campus.
Waste Management officials ar
gue that Stanford would make a
big political mistake in trying to
operate a smelly, loud, unsightly
and large facility. "If they have
had enough trouble getting a li
brary, even if it was Ronald
Reagan's, I can't imagine they
would be too overjoyed to accept
a transfer station," said Flanagan
of Waste Management.
"This is a fairly complex proc
ess," he said. "It's not an insig
nificant task to take over."
Further, Flanagan said, Waste
Management is guaranteeing a 25
percent reduction in the number
of tons they have to send to the
landfill, thereby saving Stanford
the disposal costs. "If I am right,
this is the only agreement of its
type in the country," he said.
The University is expected to
make a decision about the garbage
situation in the next two or three
months.
Voss said she does not expect
the decision to be an earth
shaking one. "Garbage is gar
bage," she said wryly. "Not a lot
of people care about it."

The Palo Alto landfill will shut its doors to Stanford in 1991, eight years before it is expected to be
full. That move has Stanford officials scrambling to find a place for the University's garbage.
