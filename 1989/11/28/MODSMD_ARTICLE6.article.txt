# Losing landfill access in '91
## University searches for place to dump its trash 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Stanford is waist-deep in its
own garbage, and now it's trying
to dig its way out.
The Palo Alto landfill, where
the Univerity dumps its garbage,
is closing its gates to Stanford
trash in April 1991, several years
before the 1999 date when the
site is expected to be full. The
ultimatum by the city of Palo Alto
has left University officials scram
bling to determine what to do with
the mounds of trash they will
have on their hands.
The task is not exactly trivial.
Not including the Medical Center,
Stanford produces 20,000 tons of
garbage every year, enough to fill
about 2,000 garbage trucks.
So far in the quest for a new
home for the garbage, a number
of possible solutions have sur
faced, but no University official
has yet signed on the dotted line
of any plan. Whatever plan Stan
ford accepts, University officials
say it must be cost-effective and
environmentally sound.
At present, two companies —
Peninsula Sanitary Service and
Waste Management Inc. — are
vying for rights to Stanford's
$780,000 garbage contract.

owned company that has handled
Stanford's waste for more than
three decades, is trying to con
vince University officials to build
a facility on Stanford land that
would process waste before it is
transported to a permanent dis
posal site.
Recyclable materials could be
hand-picked from the garbage,
easing environmental strain and
cutting down on the ever
increasing disposal costs the Uni
versity faces, according to Louis
Pellegrini, a vice president at Pen
insula Sanitary. Newspapers, soda
cans, plastics and construction
debris will all be removed from
the waste at the facility and
shipped to a recycler.
The state of California has
mandated that 25 percent of the
waste stream be recycled by 1995
