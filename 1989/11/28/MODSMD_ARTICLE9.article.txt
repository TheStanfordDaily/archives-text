# Meeting the challenge
## Innovative dean works for multiculturalism at Stanford 
### Paul Owens Staff writer 
Martin Hellman does not
shrink from challenges.
Beginning in 1984, the Stanford
electrical engineering professor
helped gather prominent U.S. and
Soviet scientists to discuss ways
to move their nations "beyond
war."
Those discussions led to a 1987
book, "Breakthrough: Emerging
New Thinking," a series of essays
in which the scientists agreed that
world war can be avoided only if
their nations recognize that global
interests must take precedence
over national interests.
Today, Hellman is aiming
toward another breakthrough,
but one closer to home. As this
year's associate dean of Graduate
Studies for recruitment and reten
tion, he is placing top priority on
working to make Stanford a mul
ticultural community.
For Hellman, multiculturalism
means that the ethnic and racial
groups within a community both
understand and respect each
other's different outlooks. Hell
man said he learned from the
U.S.-Soviet discussions that
understanding and respect are cri
tical to bridging gaps between
groups, whether or not the groups
actually agree on the issues.
He is quick to acknowledge that
multiculturalism is not a modest
goal for Stanford, given the cur
rent atmosphere on campus.
"Right now we've got polariza
tion," he said.
But bringing together U.S. and
Soviet scholars in 1984 was also
ambitious. It was a time of greater
polarization between East and
West. Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev had not yet come to power,
and the Soviet Union was still the
"evil empire" in the eyes of
Ronald Reagan.
In their first meetings, the two
delegations of scholars criticized
the foreign and domestic policies
of each others' countries. Hellman
admits that some of the criticism
from both sides was on target.
But the scientists came to realize
that trading accusations was not
advancing their objectives.
"One of the key points in the
dialogue with the Soviets was an

agreement that we would have to
stop blaming each other," Hell
man said.
He plans to make use of this
and other lessons he learned from
the international discussions to
promote a constructive dialogue
between members of different ra
cial and ethnic groups at Stanford.
The goal of the discussions will
be understanding and respect for
each other's positions, true to his
definition of multiculturalism.
Hellman said he is still working
out the details for this "intercul
tural dialogue." In the meantime,
he is committed to continuing his
office's efforts to attract minority
candidates for graduate programs
at Stanford.
Those efforts include organizing
and supporting recruiting trips,
mailings and telephone campaigns
directed at targeted minority can
didates — Native Americans,
blacks, Chicanos and Puerto
Ricans. The office has also helped
to pay the costs of visits to campus
by minority students who have
been accepted to Stanford.
According to the final report of
the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues, the percentage of
targeted minorities among grad
uate students at Stanford has in
creased each year between 1986
and 1988. The report points out,
however, that the 1988 figure of
6.7 percent enrolled was still below
the peak of 9.4 percent in 1973.
Hellman hopes to enhance his
office's effectiveness by encourag
ing more students to help in
recruiting by contacting
minorities themselves. He used
this approach in the past in the
engineering school, working with
members of minority student or
ganizations.
But Hellman sees minority
recruiting as only part of the so
lution to creating a multicultural
community.
"At the base," he said, "is the
question of what are we going to
do to change the environment so
that the minorities who are here
feel comfortable and welcome, like
Stanford students first and mi
norities second.
"If more minorities enroll at
Stanford, but are alienated, then
we haven't solved the problem."
Hellman understands the

alienation that minorities can feel.
He is Jewish, but he spent most
of his childhood living in an Irish-
Catholic neighborhood in the
Bronx.
A professor at Stanford since
1971, Hellman has in recent years
counseled the minority students
in the Electrical Engineering De
partment. He has received three
teaching awards from minority
student organizations. Last year,
he was named his department's
first minority student affairs of
ficer.
As associate dean, Hellman
hopes to enlist all of the depart
ments in a partnership with his
office. Departments can help, not
only by recruiting minority stu
dents, but by being sensitive to
their needs once they arrive, he
said.
Hellmann is eager to support
those efforts through his office.
He pointed out that most Stanford
graduate students only interact
occasionally with the Graduate
Studies office but work with their
departments almost every day.
Hellman sees a common theme
in the discussions between U.S.
and Soviet scholars and in his new
challenge at Stanford.
"I am really convinced," he said,
"that unless we learn to overcome
the barriers that separate the dif
ferent peoples of the world — the
different nations, the different
races, the different religions — we
are not going to survive as a
species."

helped gather prominent U.S. and
Soviet scientists to discuss ways
to move their nations "beyond
war."
Those discussions led to a 1987
book, "Breakthrough: Emerging
New Thinking," a series of essays
in which the scientists agreed that
world war can be avoided only if
their nations recognize that global
interests must take precedence
over national interests.
Today, Hellman is aiming
toward another breakthrough,
but one closer to home. As this
year's associate dean of Graduate
Studies for recruitment and reten
tion, he is placing top priority on
working to make Stanford a mul
ticultural community.
For Hellman, multiculturalism
means that the ethnic and racial
groups within a community both
understand and respect each
other's different outlooks. Hell
man said he learned from the
U.S.-Soviet discussions that
understanding and respect are cri
tical to bridging gaps between
groups, whether or not the groups
actually agree on the issues.
He is quick to acknowledge that
multiculturalism is not a modest
goal for Stanford, given the cur
rent atmosphere on campus.
"Right now we've got polariza
tion," he said.
But bringing together U.S. and
Soviet scholars in 1984 was also
ambitious. It was a time of greater
polarization between East and
West. Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev had not yet come to power,
and the Soviet Union was still the
"evil empire" in the eyes of
Ronald Reagan.
In their first meetings, the two
delegations of scholars criticized
the foreign and domestic policies
of each others' countries. Hellman
admits that some of the criticism
from both sides was on target.
But the scientists came to realize
that trading accusations was not
advancing their objectives.
"One of the key points in the
dialogue with the Soviets was an

agreement that we would have to
stop blaming each other," Hell
man said.
He plans to make use of this
and other lessons he learned from
the international discussions to
promote a constructive dialogue
between members of different ra
cial and ethnic groups at Stanford.
The goal of the discussions will
be understanding and respect for
each other's positions, true to his
definition of multiculturalism.
Hellman said he is still working
out the details for this "intercul
tural dialogue." In the meantime,
he is committed to continuing his
office's efforts to attract minority
candidates for graduate programs
at Stanford.
Those efforts include organizing
and supporting recruiting trips,
mailings and telephone campaigns
directed at targeted minority can
didates — Native Americans,
blacks, Chicanos and Puerto
Ricans. The office has also helped
to pay the costs of visits to campus
by minority students who have
been accepted to Stanford.
According to the final report of
the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues, the percentage of
targeted minorities among grad
uate students at Stanford has in
creased each year between 1986
and 1988. The report points out,
however, that the 1988 figure of
6.7 percent enrolled was still below
the peak of 9.4 percent in 1973.
Hellman hopes to enhance his
office's effectiveness by encourag
ing more students to help in
recruiting by contacting
minorities themselves. He used
this approach in the past in the
engineering school, working with
members of minority student or
ganizations.
But Hellman sees minority
recruiting as only part of the so
lution to creating a multicultural
community.
"At the base," he said, "is the
question of what are we going to
do to change the environment so
that the minorities who are here
feel comfortable and welcome, like
Stanford students first and mi
norities second.
"If more minorities enroll at
Stanford, but are alienated, then
we haven't solved the problem."
Hellman understands the

alienation that minorities can feel.
He is Jewish, but he spent most
of his childhood living in an Irish-
Catholic neighborhood in the
Bronx.
A professor at Stanford since
1971, Hellman has in recent years
counseled the minority students
in the Electrical Engineering De
partment. He has received three
teaching awards from minority
student organizations. Last year,
he was named his department's
first minority student affairs of
ficer.
As associate dean, Hellman
hopes to enlist all of the depart
ments in a partnership with his
office. Departments can help, not
only by recruiting minority stu
dents, but by being sensitive to
their needs once they arrive, he
said.
Hellmann is eager to support
those efforts through his office.
He pointed out that most Stanford
graduate students only interact
occasionally with the Graduate
Studies office but work with their
departments almost every day.
Hellman sees a common theme
in the discussions between U.S.
and Soviet scholars and in his new
challenge at Stanford.
"I am really convinced," he said,
"that unless we learn to overcome
the barriers that separate the dif
ferent peoples of the world — the
different nations, the different
races, the different religions — we
are not going to survive as a
species."
