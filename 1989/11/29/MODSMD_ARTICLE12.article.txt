## Communists relinquish monopoly 
### 
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP)
— The premier pledged to include
non-Communists in a new gov
ernment, and new Communist
Party chief Karel Urbanek said
yesterday the party would give up
its constitutional monopoly on
power.
Premier Ladislav Adamec made
his pledge in a meeting with the
opposition Civic Forum movement
after 11 days of unprecedented
protest. Millions of workers ob
served a two-hour general strike
Monday, but the streets were
quiet yesterday because the Civic
Forum asked for calm.
After the meeting, government
minister Marian Calfa said
Adamec would submit a coalition
government to President Gustav
Husak by Sunday and would ask
Parliament, which meets today, to
delete the guarantee of a "leading
role" for the party from the con
stitution.
Hours later, party chief Karel
Urbanek told 3,500 party activists
in Prague the "future of the party
requires giving up the monopoly
of power," the official news agency
CTK reported.
Urbanek, elected Friday in a
meg or reorganization of the party
leadership, said Saturday he
favored a broad-based coalition
government.
Central Committee spokesman
Josef Hora said Urbanek would
visit Moscow after the U.S.-Soviet
summit off Malta this weekend.
Civic Forum spokesman Jiri

Kanturek appeared on state tele
vision's evening news with a 10-
point statement outlining conces
sions made and further opposition
demands.
Two demands were for free elec
tions and the resignation by Dec.
10 of Husak, a central figure in
the crackdown on reform after the
Soviet-led invasion of August
1968.
At a news conference, promi
nent dissident Jiri Dienstbier read
a letter saying Husak's resigna
tion "would calm the situation."
The Civic Forum, and the allied
Public Against Violence in
Slovakia, also demanded revision
of the official view that the
"Prague Spring" reforms of 1968
were worthless.
Czechoslovakia should urge the
Soviet, East German and Bul
garian parliaments to follow those
of Poland and Hungary in con
demning the 1968 invasion by the
five Warsaw Pact countries as "a
violation of international norms
and the Warsaw Treaty itself,"
Kanturek said on television.
His two-minute appearance was
the first opportunity for Civic
Forum to make its case on a na
tional television news program.
Kanturek said Adamec
promised to seek access to state
run media for the opposition, and
permission to publish its own
journals. The premier also said
he would try to obtain the release
by Dec. 10 — International
Human Rights Day — of political

prisoners named by Civic Forum,
he reported.
Dienstbier told the news con
ference a list of 30 political pris
oners had been submitted, with
the right reserved to add more
names.
On television, Kanturek said
the government should urge Par
liament to adopt new laws guaran
teeing free elections and freedom
of speech, press, assembly, asso
ciation and religion, and to abolish
the People's Militia, the Commu
nist Party paramilitary force.
"If the public is not satisfied
with the new program, the Civic
Forum and Public Against Vio
lence will ask for the premier's
resignation," Kanturek said.
He concluded with an appeal to
Czechoslovaks to work peacefully
while remaining on alert to strike
if necessary. He said students and
actors still on strike probably
would end their sit-ins in a day
or so, but that Civic Forum would
support them if they continued.
In Washington, State Depart
ment spokeswoman Margaret Tut

wiler said: "We applaud Civic
Forum for its commitment to
peaceful transformation to de
mocracy."
Urbanek said without being
specific that many points in the
Civic Forum program were accept
able. Differences exist, he said,
but "we shall have to get used to
making politics not just with those
who agree with us," CTK re
ported.
Among demands he found "to
tally unacceptable" were disband
ing the People's Militia and get
ting the party out of the
workplace.
Calfa, a minister without
portfolio, told a news conference
the coalition would be "a govern
ment constituted primarily of ex
perts and professionals" including
Communists, members of other
parties traditionally allied to the
ruling Communists, and outside
figures. Ke did not mention free
electons.
Whether Civic Forum represen
tatives would be among the non-
Communists in the government
was not clear, and Calfa did not
indicate how many non-
Communists there would be.
Banned playwright Vaclav
Havel, the country's most promi
nent dissident, led the opposition
delegation yesterday and told
reporters afterward that Civic
Forum "is not a political party
and cannot be, and therefore
probably cannot delegate mem
bers to such positions."

Parliament, which meets today, to
delete the guarantee of a "leading
role" for the party from the con
stitution.
Hours later, party chief Karel
Urbanek told 3,500 party activists
in Prague the "future of the party
requires giving up the monopoly
of power," the official news agency
CTK reported.
Urbanek, elected Friday in a
meg or reorganization of the party
leadership, said Saturday he
favored a broad-based coalition
government.
Central Committee spokesman
Josef Hora said Urbanek would
visit Moscow after the U.S.-Soviet
summit off Malta this weekend.
Civic Forum spokesman Jiri

Kanturek appeared on state tele
vision's evening news with a 10-
point statement outlining conces
sions made and further opposition
demands.
Two demands were for free elec
tions and the resignation by Dec.
10 of Husak, a central figure in
the crackdown on reform after the
Soviet-led invasion of August
1968.
At a news conference, promi
nent dissident Jiri Dienstbier read
a letter saying Husak's resigna
tion "would calm the situation."
The Civic Forum, and the allied
Public Against Violence in
Slovakia, also demanded revision
of the official view that the
"Prague Spring" reforms of 1968
were worthless.
Czechoslovakia should urge the
Soviet, East German and Bul
garian parliaments to follow those
of Poland and Hungary in con
demning the 1968 invasion by the
five Warsaw Pact countries as "a
violation of international norms
and the Warsaw Treaty itself,"
Kanturek said on television.
His two-minute appearance was
the first opportunity for Civic
Forum to make its case on a na
tional television news program.
Kanturek said Adamec
promised to seek access to state
run media for the opposition, and
permission to publish its own
journals. The premier also said
he would try to obtain the release

Dienstbier told the news con
ference a list of 30 political pris

the right reserved to add more

On television, Kanturek said
the government should urge Par

teeing free elections and freedom
of speech, press, assembly, asso

the People's Militia, the Commu
nist Party paramilitary force.
"If the public is not satisfied
with the new program, the Civic
Forum and Public Against Vio
lence will ask for the premier's
resignation," Kanturek said.
He concluded with an appeal to
Czechoslovaks to work peacefully
while remaining on alert to strike
if necessary. He said students and
actors still on strike probably
would end their sit-ins in a day
or so, but that Civic Forum would
support them if they continued.

ment spokeswoman Margaret Tut

wiler said: "We applaud Civic
Forum for its commitment to
peaceful transformation to de
mocracy."
Urbanek said without being
specific that many points in the
Civic Forum program were accept
able. Differences exist, he said,
but "we shall have to get used to
making politics not just with those
who agree with us," CTK re
ported.

ruling Communists, and outside

electons.
Whether Civic Forum represen
tatives would be among the non-
Communists in the government
was not clear, and Calfa did not
indicate how many non-
Communists there would be.
Banned playwright Vaclav
Havel, the country's most promi
nent dissident, led the opposition
delegation yesterday and told
reporters afterward that Civic
Forum "is not a political party
and cannot be, and therefore
probably cannot delegate mem
bers to such positions."

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP)
— The premier pledged to include
non-Communists in a new gov
ernment, and new Communist
Party chief Karel Urbanek said
yesterday the party would give up
its constitutional monopoly on
power.
Premier Ladislav Adamec made
his pledge in a meeting with the
opposition Civic Forum movement
after 11 days of unprecedented
protest. Millions of workers ob
served a two-hour general strike
Monday, but the streets were
quiet yesterday because the Civic
Forum asked for calm.
After the meeting, government
minister Marian Calfa said
Adamec would submit a coalition
government to President Gustav
Husak by Sunday and would ask
Parliament, which meets today, to
delete the guarantee of a "leading
role" for the party from the con
stitution.
Hours later, party chief Karel
Urbanek told 3,500 party activists
