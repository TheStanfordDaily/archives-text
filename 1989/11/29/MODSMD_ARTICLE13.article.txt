# Crane crashes in San Francisco, killing 5 and injuring 21
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A crane
plummeted from the 16th story of a
building under construction yesterday
flattening a school van, several cars and
smashing into an office building across
the street. At least five people were killed,
21 injured and five left missing, author
ities said.
"It felt like an earthquake," said Mer
rill Lynch Vice President Joe McLaughlin,
who was in the damaged office building.
"I looked out and saw two bodies. One
construction worker's boots were sticking
yp through a mass of jagged metal."
In the aftermath of the accident that

rained concrete and twisted steel on one
of the busiest intersections in the finan
cial district, a prosecutor said criminal
negligence charges twice previously had
been filed against the project's general
contractor for accidents on Los Angeles
construction sites.
There were conflicting statements on
what was happening before the crane fell.
Fire Chief Fred Postel said it was hoisting
steel beams, but the general contractor
said the crane was being repositioned
from the 16th to the 20th floors.
A piece of the crane at least three
stories long dangled from the side of the

building under construction two hours
after the 8:30 a.m. accident. Police roped
off the area and ambulances rushed in
and out.
The street was littered with flattened
cars and a mangled motorcyle. Gas was
cut off to the damaged 21-story office
building for fear of an explosion.
"The wreckage looks absolutely incred
ible — steel beams look like pickup
sticks," said Acting Mayor Angela Alioto,
sitting in while Mayor Art Agnos tours
the country urging tourists to return in
the wake of the Oct. 17 earthquake.
At an afternoon news conference at

the scene, Alioto said experts could not
immediately determine the cause of the
collapse. She also said streets in a four
square-block area would be closed for at
least a week for cleanup and repairs, and
the California Street cable car also was
shut down.
Alioto said the dead were four con
struction workers, all from the Seattle
area, and the woman driving the school
van, operated by Laidlaw Transit Inc.
"It's pretty rough," said Laidlaw Senior
Vice President Howard Wallack. "They
(other employees) are pretty upset, and
we are arranging a chaplain and psychol

ogist to go over to our offices."
The fire chief said five people were
listed as missing in the twisted steel and
broken concrete.
Swinerton & Walberg Co. of San Fran
cisco, the general contractor on the job,
said the crane was being repositioned
from the 16th story to the 20th story,
the second such repositioning of the proj
ect.
Criminal negligence charges were twice
filed against Swinerton and Walbert in
1981 and 1986 for separate accidents on
the Los Angeles sites, said Los Angeles
Deputy City Attorney Michael Guarino.
