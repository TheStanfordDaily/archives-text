# U.N. chief says U.S. must pay bill
## Showdown expected Friday over recognition of PLO 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said yesterday the United
States is obligated to pay its U.N.
dues even if the General Assembly
votes to recognize the PLO as the
nation of Palestine.
With a showdown vote between
the United States and PLO
looming Friday, diplomats said
they have little hope for a com
promise that would avert a U.S.
cutoff of funds for the United Na
tions.
On Monday, the Palestine Lib
eration Organization said Arab
nations plan to push a resolution
through the General Assembly
recognizing the PLO as an obser
ver nation.
The State Department immedi
ately threatened to cut off all U.S.
support for the United Nations if
the General Assembly approved
the step. Washington is assessed
$216 million annually, one-fourth

of the U.N. budget.
"1 don't like the word 'threat,'"
Perez de Cuellar said yesterday.
"You cannot threaten me if I ask
you to pay what you owe me,
don't you think so?
"Sometimes I think 1 have the
impression that the Americans
think that they're making a loan.
The Americans ought to pay what
they owe.
"What I don't understand is the
link, how they link the two things
together," he said.
"It is an obligation under the
U.N. Charter, it's a treaty obliga
tion," added his spokesman, Fran
cois Giuliani.
European and Nordic
diplomats, who often play a buffer
role in the recurring U.S.-PLO
confrontations, worked on a com
promise but said privately they
had little hope.
The anticipated assembly action
also could jeopardize U.S.-PLO

talks, Washington's ambassador
to the United Nations, Thomas
R. Pickering, said yesterday.
"It has serious consequences for
the peace process in the Middle
East, our ongoing dialogue with
the PLO, a lot of very important
issues, issues that I would say
should be much more important
to the PLO than the mere change
on a nameplate here in the United
Nations," he said.
The United States has been en
gaged in talks since December
with PLO representatives in
Tunis, Tunisia, through U.S. Am
bassador Robert Pelletreau.
The PLO wants its status as a
permanent observer mission
raised from that of organization
to nation, like North Korea and
South Korea, Monaco, the
Vatican, San Marino and Switzer
land.
Observer nations don't have
voting rights and can speak only
if invited by the assembly.
