Poland, Israel restore ties
Warsaw, Poland (AP) â€” Poland will restore
full diplomatic relations with Israel next year, a
government spokesman said yesterday, and Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said later he would
like to visit the Jewish state.
Mazowiecki said he was invited to Israel by
Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres, who is on
the second day of a three-day visit to Poland.
Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski on
Monday informed Peres of Warsaw's decision to
restore relations broken off 22 years ago, said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski.
"The resumption of relations can take place
in the first quarter of next year," Staniszewski
said. After the meeting with Peres, Mazowiecki
said the date for the resumption of relations is
not yet fixed.
Except for Romania, all Warsaw Pact nations
severed diplomatic relations with Israel following
the 1967 Middle East War.
Hungary on Sept. 18 became the first Warsaw
Pact country to restore relations. Poland has had
low-level ties since 1986, allowing Israel to main
tain a diplomatic office in Warsaw.
