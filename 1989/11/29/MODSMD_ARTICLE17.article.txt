### 
Big Game drinking
injuries show need to
rethink alcohol policy

Football is a violent con
tact sport, but watching a
football game should not be.
At Big Game this year, there
were 27 arrests for alcohol-related
incidents. Fights broke out, the
Stanford Tree was attacked and
police were hit with rocks and full
beer cans. Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer called the inci
dents the worst in 15 years of Big
Game.
Such alcohol-related problems
have been snowballing for a long
time. Though a college football
game is a combination of a social
function and a sporting event, too
many students have viewed them
as an occasion to get drunk. And
sometimes they get violent.
In order to change the environ
ment at the games, the University
should no longer allow fans to take
alcohol into the Stadium. Instead,
like most other stadiums in the
country, beer should only be avail
able at the concession stands dur
ing the game.
Currently, every ticket holder
who is of legal drinking age can
take a six-pack of beer into games.
That seems like a lot of beer, but
not so long ago students could take
kegs into games. So things should
be getting better, right?
Wrong. Many students, fans and
alumni start drinking before games
at tailgaters and are half-drunk

when they get into the Stadium
with their six-packs tucked under
their arms.
Preventing fans from taking al
cohol into the Stadium won't stop
tailgaters, and selling alcohol dur
ing the game won't keep people
sober. But it is a better compro
mise.
No longer will an innocent fan
have to keep an eye out for beer
cans — some of them full — that
drunken spectators have thrown
into the crowd.
If people have to buy beer at the
game, the price they pay will prob
ably prevent them from spraying
people with their purchase. If they
do, at least, plastic cups don't hurt
as much as cans.
Also, selling beer at games will
naturally lower the amount of al
cohol people consume. The long
lines and the cost will discourage
people from drinking to get drunk.
Granted, some people will still
drink heavily at pre-game tail
gaters. Ticket-takers should be on
the lookout for those who seem
intoxicated.
Only when adults act like
children (or worse) do rules have
to be made. The rule limiting each
ticket holder over 21 years of age
to a six-pack was the first step.
But, at Big Game this year, football
fans (albeit many of whom were
from UC-Berkeley) showed that
that first step was not enough.
A new compromise must be
reached in an effort to solve the
problem of alcohol abuse in the
Stadium. Hopefully, this new so
lution will be enough to jar people
into acting responsibly.
