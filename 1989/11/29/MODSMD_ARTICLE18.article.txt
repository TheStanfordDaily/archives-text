Focus assistants foster relaxed, learning atmosphere

WE, THE FOCUS ASSISTANTS
at Adams House, the human
biology focus house, are writing
to clear up some misinformation in the
Nov. 27 article on Stanford's focus
houses.
First, Adams House considered its
focus in an in-house survey conducted
by the focus assistants in early 1989.
Most residents concluded that they
preferred the program to be a focus as
opposed to a theme, with no pressure
to participate in programs. This is not
to say that people do not attend our
programs. Interested residents contrib
ute greatly to the success of our
planned programs.
The role of the focus assistants,
simply, is to work as a staff with the

resident assistants to produce a com
fortable, stimulating and educational
atmosphere for our residents.
From our orientation in September,
we have had a cohesive and coopera
tive relationship with our RA's; the
house has one staff, not two. Our
focus provides an umbrella of program
ming guides and an access to the
broad range of faculty involved in
human biology's interdisciplinary pro
gram.
We also support the human biology
program and encourage the extension
of classroom learning to the dorm by
organizing office hours for student
advisers, teaching assistants and writ
ing assistants.
Our main goal this quarter has been

introducing the program to our resi
dents. We feel we have accomplished
this goal with a variety of social activi
ties, student-faculty contact and the
programs mentioned in the article.
Further definition of our roles will
come from future involvement in house
activities.
In the application process, we were

told that participation is strictly volun
tary and involves no remuneration. If
we have any remaining guaranteed
years, we use one to participate in the
program. Residential Education pro
vides only one unguaranteed spot.
While the question of compensation
can still be debated, our participation
is independent of those considerations.
We would like to encourage attend
ance at our future focus programs and
hope that this letter ends some misun
derstandings about the program.
