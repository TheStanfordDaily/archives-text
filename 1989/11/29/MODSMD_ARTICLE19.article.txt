# COP represents campus majority by supporting choice
## 
### 
We are members of the Pro-Choice
Alliance writing in response to a letter
in The Daily on Monday, Nov. 20, that
raises questions about the Council of
Presidents' statement at the Pro-Choice
Rally held earlier this month.
The letter questioned the right of
the COP to represent the majority of
Stanford students on this issue and the
appropriateness of their involvement
with an issue such as this, which is
national in scope and not just limited
to the campus.
Last spring in the runoff elections
there was a referendum on the ballot
that showed 85 percent of the campus
was pro-choice. This is clearly a
majority. All national and other polls
we have seen indicate that a majority
of college students are consistently pro
choice.

Second, we asked the COP to speak
at our rally because we thought it was
part of their responsibility as the stu
dent presidents of Stanford to take a
stand and give support to the pro
choice movement.
Losing the right to choose would
have a huge impact on students lives,
and hundreds of Stanford students are
involved in working to keep that right.
The COP has clearly responded to the
stand of the mEyority of students and
the involvement of many, and we
thank them for their support.
