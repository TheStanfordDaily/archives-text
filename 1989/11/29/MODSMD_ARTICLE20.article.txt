# Graduate students should seek broader academic exposure
## 
### 
I'm a second-year graduate student
in the Electrical Engineering Depart
ment and I'm very pleased to have
read The Daily's article about Julie
Seavello (Nov. 27). I admire her desire
for achievement in many areas of
human knowledge. I really look for
ward for the rest of the series which
might show what a person can be.
However, I have been disappointed to
realize that Stanford graduate pro
grams do little to increase the student's
interest in areas other than the one to
which the individual applied. I have
been told stories about people not
taking classes in other departments
because .. it would not count
towards my degree." That is sad.
When I arrived here, I made a
longtime dream into reality. I knew

that I would be sharing the place with
some of the most interesting people in
the world and I decided to spend time
taking classes in other departments
and knowing people in other disci
plines.
I have been very thankful to my
academic adviser, Dwight Nishimura,
who likes the idea of broadening an
individual's interests, and I would like
to see, from other advisers and depart
ment heads, a similar open attitude.
I have been wondering if we should
go back to the good old times when
doctoral students, in any area, were
required to know at least one foreign
language well, have some knowledge of
art and be complete individuals.
