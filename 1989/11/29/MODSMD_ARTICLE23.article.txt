## Studying: the key to love 
### 
IT HAPPENED AGAIN. A UC-
Berkeley football player made some
comments to the press implying that
Stanford students are pampered rich kids,
removed from the real world.
These kind of accusations pop up all
the time against prestigious universities.
Students at schools like Stanford are said
to be hiding in the ivory tower of
academia, studying irrelevant topics with
little or no practical value.
And in the past, I've sometimes felt
these allegations were justified. How was
learning how to make Karel the Robot
pick up beepers going to help society?
Was analyzing Plato's allegory of the cave
going to put food in the mouth of a
starving child?
But my attitude has completely
changed. I've finally learned something
here that can apply to one of the most
serious problems Stanford students en
counter — no dating.
Almost everyone here complains about
the lack of dating. It is as cliche as ob
serving that Branner sucks. It's been
blamed on everything from the
peculiarities of Stanford men and women
to the sheer enormity of Hoover Tower.
The real problem, however, is that few
people here have actually studied the sub
ject of love.
So for the benefit of those of you whose
love lives are less than ideal, I will sum
marize some sociological theories I've
picked up in my Interpersonal Relations
class and show you how to implement
them in your own lives.
We'll begin with Elizabeth Wolster's
theory of passionate love. Her basic idea

is that love is a combination of misery
and ecstasy and that negative conditions
can actually increase physiological arous
al. Specifically, she says that people who
have just experienced fear or have re
ceived some type of rejection are more
likely to fall in love.
Now let's apply Wolster's theory to the
real world and discover how to meet those
scared people with lowered self-esteem.
First — people who have recently felt
afraid. That earthquake was probably
just about as good as it's going to get in
the fear department. The shifting of the
earth's plates should have created a
hotbed of passion on campus. But by
now, the after-quake nervousness has
probably worn off. For those of you who
didn't strike when the iron was hot, your
best bet is to cross your fingers and prav
'for aftershocks.'f • HI fffn 1* V • O ill
Finding people suffering from rejection
is a little easier. Have you ever wondered
why spring quarter seems to be the prime
time for romance? Rejection letters from
medical, law, and graduate schools. Rejec
tions for resident assistant applicants.
Rejections from fraternities and
sororities during Rush.
But spring quarter is months away, so
what should you do now? Luckily for the
Stanford lovelorn, finals are just around
the corner. Final exams bring a plethora
of rejections, so get out there and revel
in it. I'd suggest waiting outside the In
ternational Politics final, or maybe a
chemistry exam, for some hapless student
who tried to cram 700 pages of reading
into the previous evening.
Another sociologist, George Homans,

Stanford's lack of dating
can be blamed on the fact
that few people here have
actually studied love.

suggests that people are more likely to ,
fall in love with people who have power.
This would explain my friends' crushes
,on their human biology professor and on
last ye&Ps'feand ladder.
So to make people fall in love with j
you, you should try to obtain a powerful
position. Just think about how loved the
Council of Presidents members are! And
being one of the oh-so-influential Daily
columnists has really boosted my love
life into new dimensions.
I hope these theories and suggestions
will finally remove the scourge of date
lessness from the Stanford scene. And if
you see me outside of an economics final,
holding a copy of my column and jumping !
up and down in an attempt to provoke J
an aftershock, just wave and wish me '
luck.
