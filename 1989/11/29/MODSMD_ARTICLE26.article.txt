## Drug test may save animals 
### Dan Cory Staff writer 
Using a silicon chip, researchers
at Stanford and in Menlo Park
have developed a test that may
replace the Draize rabbit eye
irritation test, long a target of
animal rights activists.
To perform the Draize test, a
researcher holds a rabbit's eye
open while a chemical is applied.
Later, the rabbit's eye is compared
to a set of standard photographs
that represent various levels of
irritation. The test is used on any
commercial product that may get
in the eyes, including cosmetics,
shampoos, liquid drugs and even
cleaners like bleach and ammonia.
The new test uses a silicon chip
that can detect damage to cells
from a wide range of irritants.
Scientists at Molecular Devices
Corporation, founded by Chemis
try Prof. Harden McConnell,
created channels 50 micrometers
thick in the surface of a silicon
wafer.
A fluid containing the cells to
be studied flows slowly over the
wafer. As the cells pass over the
channels, some are trapped and
remain motionless at the bottom
of the channels.
Live cells are continously con
suming glucose as a source of en
ergy. This process, known as
respiration, produces lactic acid
and carbon dioxide. As these are
released into the surrounding
fluid, it becomes more and more
acidic.
When a light is shined on the

fluid, the current in the silicon
changes depending on the acidity
of the fluid. The resulting current
measurements are analyzed by a
computer.
Patricia Elsen, president of the
Palo Alto Humane Society, said,
"I think it's terrific news." She
looks forward to any replacement
for the Draize test. "The thought
of putting bleach in a rabbit's eye
is so hideous," she said.
She points out, however, many
other alternatives to the Draize
test exist, including computer
models, cell cultures and tests on
chicken eggs. She claims that the
toxicologists just aren't ready to
let go of the Draize test.
McConnell, founder of Molecu
lar Devices, says that there is "not
anything that comes anywhere
near" the silicon biosensor. As
McConnell says, "Bacteria are not
human cells" and the silicon
biosensor can be used on any cell
type unlike older replacements for
the Draize test.
Further, testing with the device
is more repeatable and much
cheaper than rabbit testing. The
two-dimensional surface of the
cell even enables the scientist to
run multiple tests at the same
time.
Wally Parce, the principal scien
tist of Molecular Devices, reports
that Proctor and Gamble is study
ing the reactions of cells to their
soap and detergent line with the
silicon biosensor. The results cor
respond with previously per
formed Draize tests to a high
degree of accuracy.

He said he expects that the new
testing method will be phased in
slowly. Before it can completely
replace the Draize test, the
"morass of regulation" by the
Food and Drug Administration
and other government agencies
will have to be changed. He said
he looks forward to the day when
his sensor could replace all Draize
testing.
University President Donald
Kennedy, who was FDA Commis
sioner under the Carter
administration, says the FDA
does not require by law the Draize
test, and he said he thinks the
Draize test is not specifically
called for in any regulation.
Sylvia Bancroft, an animal
rights activist of the Humane Ed
ucation Network, says the num
ber of Draize tests performed
yearly is in the millions. Compan
ies are not required to report the
tests, so it is impossible to know
exactly how many rabbits are used
each year.
The animal rights groups plan
to press once again for legislation
against the Draize and other tests.
Efforts in the California legisla
ture last year to prevent animal
tests were lobbied against by
toxicologists and university re
searchers and eventually failed to
pass.
McConnell says that the re
search is a "pretty spectacular de
velopment." The device, with its
small size arid high accuracy,
should be useful in other situa
tions.

changes depending on the acidity
of the fluid. The resulting current
measurements are analyzed by a
computer.
Patricia Elsen, president of the
Palo Alto Humane Society, said,
"I think it's terrific news." She
looks forward to any replacement
for the Draize test. "The thought
of putting bleach in a rabbit's eye
is so hideous," she said.
She points out, however, many
other alternatives to the Draize
test exist, including computer
models, cell cultures and tests on
chicken eggs. She claims that the
toxicologists just aren't ready to
let go of the Draize test.
McConnell, founder of Molecu
lar Devices, says that there is "not
anything that comes anywhere
near" the silicon biosensor. As
McConnell says, "Bacteria are not
human cells" and the silicon
biosensor can be used on any cell
type unlike older replacements for
the Draize test.
Further, testing with the device
is more repeatable and much
cheaper than rabbit testing. The
two-dimensional surface of the
cell even enables the scientist to
run multiple tests at the same
time.
Wally Parce, the principal scien
tist of Molecular Devices, reports
that Proctor and Gamble is study
ing the reactions of cells to their
soap and detergent line with the
silicon biosensor. The results cor
respond with previously per
formed Draize tests to a high
degree of accuracy.

He said he expects that the new
testing method will be phased in
slowly. Before it can completely
replace the Draize test, the
"morass of regulation" by the
Food and Drug Administration
and other government agencies
will have to be changed. He said
he looks forward to the day when
his sensor could replace all Draize
testing.
University President Donald
Kennedy, who was FDA Commis
sioner under the Carter
administration, says the FDA
does not require by law the Draize
test, and he said he thinks the
Draize test is not specifically
called for in any regulation.
Sylvia Bancroft, an animal
rights activist of the Humane Ed
ucation Network, says the num
ber of Draize tests performed
yearly is in the millions. Compan
ies are not required to report the
tests, so it is impossible to know
exactly how many rabbits are used
each year.
The animal rights groups plan
to press once again for legislation
against the Draize and other tests.
Efforts in the California legisla
ture last year to prevent animal
tests were lobbied against by
toxicologists and university re
searchers and eventually failed to
pass.
McConnell says that the re
search is a "pretty spectacular de
velopment." The device, with its
small size arid high accuracy,
should be useful in other situa
tions.
