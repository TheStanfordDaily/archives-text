# Garbage woes can be avoided
## 
### Jessica Hirst 
Chris, a Stanford student, gets
out of bed, blissfully unaware of
how much garbage he is going to
create today. Three-and-a-half
pounds, approximately.
In the shower, he uses up the
last of his shampoo and con
ditioner, which he bought in
travel size to save space. Chris
throws two blue plastic bottles
into the abyss of the bathroom
trash can.
Next, Chris shaves with his
handy disposable razor. Plastic
item number three becomes a test
of early morning dexterity — yes,
he makes the shot. Moving right
along, Chris washes his hands and
dries them on three finely tex
tured paper towels, which he
promptly adds to the growing pile
in the garbage can.
Chris squeezes the last bit of
moisturizer out of the plastic
squeeze bottle onto his hands and
throws it away. He makes a men
tal note to go by Tresidder Union
to pick up more shampoo, con
ditioner and lotion. Every time
he turns around, it seems like it's
time to go shopping.
At breakfast, lunch and dinner,
Chris uses four of those cute
waxed paper cups plus two
styrofoam coffee cups in the quest
to satisfy his thirst. He throws
away yesterday's Daily, along with
last quarter's captivating lecture
notes.
That night while writing an in
spired essay on the wonders of
gracefully vanishing garbage, the
ink runs out of his plastic dis
posable pen. After uttering the
appropriate four-letter words, his
writing instrument embarks on
the mysterious journey to "Away."

Frustrated, Chris flees his room
for the comfort of study break
snacks, served on polystyrene
plates with plastic utensils.
Reflecting on the sticky pile of
study-break remains, Chris begins
to wonder just where this magical
"Away" is located. He envisions
it as sort of a black hole into which
his razors, cups and pens disap
pear — along with one member
of every pair of his socks — never
to be heard from again. After ask
ing around, Chris finds that
nobody in his residence has heard
of an Away, Calif. Chris decides
to take it upon himself to find
the true resting place of his gar
bage, whatever the risk.
His journey leads him to the
Palo Alto landfill. Some "Away,"
he thinks. This place is nothing
like a black hole. In fact, it's an
anaerobic pile of unpleasant stuff
in which decomposition of any
thing takes a very, very long time.
The friendly attendant informs
Chris that as of April 1991 Stan
ford will have to find another
"Away" for its garbage. The
landfill will be no longer take
campus garbage and before the
decade is over, the landfill is ex
pected to be completely full.
What are Stanford's options?
Well, the two closest landfills —
Kirby Canyon and Newby Island
— are south of San Jose. Both
transporting and dumping will be
a lot more expensive than at the
Palo Alto landfill.

Stanford's garbage will either
be hauled in all its aromatic glory
directly to San Jose or it will make
an intermediate stop in Sunnyvale
at a transfer station, where the
garbage will be sorted for any
recyclables.
There is the possibility of a
Stanford mini-transfer facility,
which will have a high initial cost,
but a potential savings of millions
over the next couple decades.
The next morning the newly
enlightened Chris washes his hair
with his economy size shampoo
and conditioner, thinking that
maybe he'll head into Palo Alto
to find the store that refills sham
poo bottles. He shaves with his
non-disposable razor with blade
refills. He dries his hands on his
very own plush terry towel. And,
his hands are marvelously soft
from his refillable moisturizer
bottle.
At meals, Chris chugs lemonade
from his king-size mug, then goes
to request that Food Service make
glasses available to everyone. He
carries his caffeine fix to class in
his mug, remembering as he
rinses it how much landfill money
he'll save in the long run.
Yesterday's Daily and miscel
laneous fliers start on their way
to the Recycling Center. Chris en
courages his friends to bring their
own mugs to study breaks. While
writing his paper — with a new
topic of how to reduce waste —
his ink runs out again. This time
our environmentally sound Stan
ford student whips out his sleek
refills, slips one into his writing
instrument and pens in his next
support: Reusable products save
time, money and the environment.
Even a Weenie can figure that out.
