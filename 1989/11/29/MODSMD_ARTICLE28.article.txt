Editor's note: The following
stories come from this past
weekend's meeting of the
Radiological Society of North
America, held in Chicago.
Imaging discovery
Magnetic resonance imaging,
a Stanford-developed process of
viewing the human body, might
be used in a variety of new ap
plications, a Stanford scientist
suggests.
A new form of catheter, a
probe inserted in the human
body for a variety of important
clinical uses, may be used with
magnetic resonance imaging, a
commonly used medical imaging
technique.
Catheters are commonly
made with barium because that
element can be differentiated by
X-rays, but magnetic resonance

imaging is based on a very dif
ferent technology.
The new catheters incor
porate a ferromagnetic compo
nent, making them visible in a
magnetic resonance image.
Daniel Rubin, a fellow in the
Felix Bloch Magnetic Resonance
Imaging Laboratory, said he will
do further tests to determine
whether the new catheter will
be of clinical use.
Bone strengthening
The natural substance that
gives bone and teeth their
rigidity has proven effective in
facilitating bone healing in an
imal studies, Stanford research
ers have found.
These agents are expected to
provide doctors with an im
proved way to treat fractures
and osteoporosis, the break

down of the bones commonly
occuring in elderly women, ac
cording to Stuart Young, an as
sociate professor of diagnostic
radiology and nuclear medicine.
Researchers are testing an
agent called Biofibre and and
Superbone, two products in
vented by Norian Corp. of
Mountain View. The agents are
made of calcium phosphate,
hydroxyapatite and inorganic
compounds naturally found in
bones and teeth.
"The Superbone may prove to
be a truly unique approach to
treating osteoporosis," Young
said.
Clinical trials of Superbone
for dental applications are ex
pected to start within the next
year. It may be used, for exam
ple, in root canals when the pa
tient does not have enough jaw
bone to bore into or when the
bone has been weakened.
