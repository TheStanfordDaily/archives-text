# Plants can catch colds, but don't sneeze

Q.Do plants have immune
• systems?
A. Well ... kind of.
• Plants do resist the
microbes, or germs, that attack
them, but their methods are dif
ferent from those used by mam
mals.
One difference, a trait you may
have noticed if you've ever
mowed a lawn or chopped vege
tables, is that plants do not have
blood.
This means they can't circ
ulate disease-battling antibodies
to infected areas. This is not a
big problem, according to Bio
logical Sciences Prof. Sharon
Long, because plants don't make
antibodies.
"But they do have ways of
fighting against invaders," Long
said.
The types of diseases a plant
reacts to are controlled by the
plant's genes. This varies a lot,
Long said. If you compared the
resistance of all rice plants, for
example, some would be resis
tant to a given disease, some not.
The method plants use to
resist disease is a suicidal tactic
called "necrosis."
In one version, the attacked
cells produce a compound that
kills all the nasty microbes in
the area. This saves the rest of
the plant, but the compound is
deadly to the cells that make it.

Another variation of necrosis
is for the cells to strengthen their
walls in the attacked area. This
creates a physical barrier that
seals off the microbes from the
rest of the plant. It does nothing
for the areas that are already
diseased, so the cells there even
tually die.
For a mammal, these kinds of
disease fighting mechanisms
would be inconvenient at best
(You would hear people saying,
"*&*s#! I cut my finger. I sure
hope it doesn't get infected and
die.") But for plants, killing a
leaf or root or stem is not such
a big deal. They get over it.

Q. Years ago my mother had
• a "recipe" for making
paper fireplace logs that would
burn with various colors.
Newsprint was coated with cer
tain chemicals, rolled up and left
to dry. During the Yuletide and
other holidays, my mother would
let us kids take out one of the
special paper logs to set afire.
Here's my problem — I can't
for the life of me recall the chemi
cals used. Of course the "recipe"
is long gone (so is my mother;
may she rest in peace). I've tried
using copper sulfate to obtain a
greenish flame, but it's not what
I remember at all. However, I
am especially looking to obtain
a nice green flame either by
sprinkling on some powdered
crystals, as I do now, or by that
old magic.
Your help would really
brighten our holidays.
A. Personally, I've always
• been partial to the tradi
tional orange and yellow flames;
no high-tech special effects re
quired. But such a courteous let
ter deserves at least some kind
of answer (even if it was ad
dressed to "Gentlemen" — which
I'm not — and while I suppose
there may exist a few Megans
of the masculine persuasion, I
doubt that many of them are
plural.)
Anyway, a friend suggested
mixing chemicals at random and
throwing them in the fire. That
might be worth a try, but don't

sue me if the house blows up in
your face first.
Another option is to move to
New York City. Rumor has it
there's a television channel there
that shows a roaring fireplace
all Christmas Eve. You could
simply adjust the color knobs on
the set until you get the perfect
nostalgic shade of green. You
could even tape the program on
a videocassette recorder and
have colorful flames readily
available for festive occasions
throughout the year.
For a more scientific answer,
I talked to Chemistry Prof.
James Collman. He suggested
adding the chemical they use to
make green fireworks.
"I think it's barium, but I
can't remember," he said. Clear
ly, one of Collman's research
grants is not from a fireworks
company.
