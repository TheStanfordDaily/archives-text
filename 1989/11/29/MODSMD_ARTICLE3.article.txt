# Dorm computer clusters expand
## University favors Macintoshes in residence computer update 
### Kim Freidberg 
Apple Macintosh computers now dom
inate all Stanford dormitory computer
clusters and have expanded into many
Row houses.
In addition, University departments
have pushed for Macintoshes, and as a
benefactor of Apple's many dona
tions, Stanford has now become a leader
in the academic use of Macintosh
software.
In residential clusters, all but a few
IBMs were shipped out and replaced
with Macintoshes this year. Freshman
dormitories were given special priority,
and all cluster computers were con
nected to the campus mainframes.
"Apple basically took over the campus

this year," said Steve Jurvetson, a
second-year graduate student and resi
dent computer coordinator in Roble
Hall.
Some expansion also took place into
the Row this year, as all theme houses
were given two Macintosh SEs. A cluster
at Schiff House will also be in place by
the end of the week for the use of all
Governor'B Corner residents, and all
clusters have been provided with access
to LaserWriters.
Residential Education officials say
they chose to update the clusters partly
because of support for Macintoshes
within various University departments.
"Students and faculty were clearly be
ginning to prefer Macs, and we take
our direction from the academic side,"

said Jeff Merriman, director of residen
tial computing resources in the Office
of Residential Affairs.
"Freshman English and AIR
(Academic Information Resources)
chose the Mac, and we like to work
closely with them," said Merriman.
Residences have in fact used some
extra computers originally slated for use
in various departments. The office of
Residential Education first received the
impetus to update residential clusters
after acquiring 35 surplus computers
from the Freshman English Depart
ment, which received a large donation
from Apple for use in a writing lab.
Computing in various depart
ments has shifted from an IBM
based system and Apple has
become entrenched, according to
Merriman. Largely due to student
and faculty preferences, Macin
tosh computers now set the pace
for a wide variety of uses.
Sensing the demand, Apple has
donated hundreds of computers
to the University over the years.
Usually Apple receives and
reviews requests from specific de
partments, explained Apple Ac

count Executive Margie Kriebel.
Stanford is not the only uni
versity which has adopted the Ap
ple system, said Merriman.
Dartmouth College committed it
self to Macintoshes in 1984, build
ing a compatible mainframe and
connecting it to every room.
Many other universities
adopted the IBM system and are
now slowly shifting to Apple,
added Merriman. Stanford, how
ever, seems to have made the
greatest commitment.
"Stanford is certainly leading
the country in the use and devel
opment of Macintosh software,"
said Kriebel.
