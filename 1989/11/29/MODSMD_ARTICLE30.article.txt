# Tumor therapy works

### Katherine Hemela 
In the hopes of developing a
human cancer therapy, Stanford
scientists are studying a new drug
shown to shrink cancerous tumors
drastically in mice when used in
conjunction with radiation.
Dr. J. Martin Brown, director
of the Cancer Biology Research
Laboratory and Stanford's radia
tion biology division, and Dr. Mi
chael Tracy, director of the
synthetic cancer drugs program
at SRI International in Menlo
Park, hope to have a drug ready
for humans within 18 months.
The two scientists have been
studying the drug for its potential
to cure cancer since its discovery
in 1985.
"We first thought the drug had
the marvelous feature of killing
cells in the absence of oxygen,"
Brown said. "Since we know that
tumors have cells deficient in
oxygen and that those cells are
resistant to radiation, it was a
reasonable idea to put the two
together so that the radiation kills
the oxic cells and the drug could
kill the hypoxic cells."
Brown and Tracy found that
the drug, not yet given a name
but labeled SR 4233, is only ac
tivated in hypoxia, or lack of
oxygen. "What we are doing here
is exploiting a difference that
exists in solid tumors compared
to normal tissue," Brown said.
"This is a mtgor advantage in tar
geting the compound into solid
tumors."
Presently, only about half of the
cancer patients receiving radiation
therapy alone are cured. "What

we are looking at," Brown said,
"is an ability, in combining the
drug with radiation, to be able to
dramatically increase the cure
rate."
The researchers are examining
mice with tumors who receive
both SR 4233 and multiple daily
doses of radiation. However, be
cause of this special combination,
the tumors are cured with half
the number of doses as is pres
ently given to patients. Because of
this, the effect on the normal
tissue surrounding the tumor —
which also gets radiated — is
much less, the researchers found.
According to Brown, if the mice
would receive the same radiation
dose as patients in conjunction
with the drug, the tumor would
"think it had twice as much ra
diation. For years, radiation
therapists have been trying to give
tumors more radiation with less
damage to the surrounding
tissues. The drug seems to be the
potential answer to this problem."
The scientists' next step is to
decide whether SR 4233 is the
compound that Sterling Drugs
Inc., the funder of the almost $3
million research project, will
develop, or whether one of the
four or five other close analogues
would have more potential in
treating cancer in humans.
"I sometimes like to say that
hypoxia is the 'Achilles' heel* of
tumors. For 20 years we have been
thinking it is a problem in treat
ment since it is resistant to a lot
of radiation and anti-cancer
drugs. However, here is a way
that we are actually benefiting
from them," Brown said.
