## Ole jumps from redshirt twilight to gym limelight 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
After redshirting her freshman
year at Stanford, Laura Olesen
was ready to quit.
"I was scared of everything,"
said Olesen, now a fifth-year
senior and captain of the Stanford
volleyball team. "I didn't feel
ready physically, I didn't know
anyone, and I was afraid of every
body."
Yet, of all her accomplishments
as a five-year member and three
year starter for the Cardinal,
Olesen remains most "proud" of
her decision at that time to
remain with the club: an action
sparked by her own successful
suppression of the insecurity so
characteristic of her nature.
It has been to the immeasurable
benefit of the team that she opted
to remain. Guiding Stanford into
tomorrow's first-round NCAA
match against USC, Olesen has
proved to be both an instrumental
force of cohesion and a menacing
figure over which opponents must
hit.
It has been a gradual — yet
noticeable — growth in mental
strength that has enabled Olesen
throughout her career to partici
pate in the 1987 NCAA champi
onship match, to break the career
record in block assists previously
held by Olympic Captain Kim
Oden, and to successfully unify a
newly-revamped 1989 team in the
midst of a difficult transition from
experience to youth.
Building this confidence,
though, was never really an easy
task with the fifth-year senior
from La Jolla, Calif., initially con
sidered a "project" by the Stan
ford coaching staff.
"On the first day of preseason
practice during her freshman
year," Coach Don Shaw fondly

recalls, "Laura was so scared and
intimidated that on the first serv
ing drill, she couldn't serve the
ball over the net."
"I cried the whole drive up to
preseason camp," Olesen admits.
"I pictured myself getting
destroyed every day in practice."
Resolving this intense in
feriority complex, however,
proved exceedingly difficult. "For
the whole first year, I was scared
to death to play for the team,"
Olesen stressed. "I didn't know
what to expect."
Olesen attributes her eventual
boost in confidence to a "heart
to-heart talk" she had the follow
ing summer. "A friend told me to
just go for it because I had noth
ing to lose," Olesen explained.
"For some reason, that really
clicked with me. It made a huge
difference."
Concrete results immediately
followed. During the preseason of
her sophomore year, Olesen com
mandeered a starting position she
would never relinquish and even
tually played in both the finals
and semifinals of the NCAA
championships.
Since then, Olesen has emerged
as the most steadying, consistent
force on a stunningly precocious
team. Despite, in her own percep
tion, not being a very "glorious,
dazzling" player with a whole lot
of strength, Ole — as she is called
on the team — has established
herself as a bulwark of reliability.
Hitting better than .280 for her
career, recording 134 blocks last
year alone, and starting for two
teams that advanced to the Final
Four, Olesen is justly lauded by
Shaw for her stellar performance.
"When you look at the course
of four years and what Ole has
done," Shaw reiterates, "you just
have to be pleased with the
results."

Freshman middle-blocking
counterpart Bev Oden says simply,
"Ole has been playing awesome."
Perhaps Olesen's most steadfast
contribution to the Cardinal is the
remarkable skill with which she
has melded the disparate team.
Starting frequently with three
freshmen and a sophomore, Ole
often finds herself as the only ex
perienced player on the court. She
has taken charge of an unnerving
situation.
"Laura has very high expecta
tions of herself and the team,"
Shaw noted. "But she has
definitely put the team before her
own personal goals."
Olesen, as captain, has been re
sponsible for organizing the
team's activities, deciding practi
cal issues such as which uniforms
they will wear, addressing any
problems, calling team-specific
meetings, and serving as liaison
between her teammates and
Shaw.
It is with this capacity that
Shaw is most impressed. "Al
though Laura's basically a shy
person," Shaw said, "more so than
any other captain I've had, she's
come in and told me what's on
her mind. She's always commun
icated well."
"If something's bothering me,"
Olesen concurs, "I'll let him
know."
Such accomplished leadership
abilities certainly seem to be the
product of her heightened level of
confidence. "Last year, I wasn't
positive. I'm trying to stay posi
tive now so I don't bring down
other players," Olesen said.
As the vigilant guardian of this
year's squad, Olesen has been
forced for the first time to deal
with an "inconsistent" season.
"Laura has played on teams of

Fifth-year senior Laura Olesen may be seeing her last volleyball action at Stanford when the Cardinal
takes on USC Thursday at Burnham Pavilion in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Olesen, a
three-year starter for Coach Don Shaw, hit .205 for the Cardinal in 1989.
