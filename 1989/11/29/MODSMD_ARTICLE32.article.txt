# Sports-crazed Santa stuffs hoops, halfbacks and stockings
## 
### 
There are only 27 shopping days left
until Christmas. For those of you
who haven't selected gifts yet, I
present The Sports Fan's Holiday Shop
ping Guide.
For openers, a surefire stocking stuffer
— guaranteed to please — is a year's
subscription to Sports Illustrated. Order
now and the recipient will get coverage
of the NFL playoffs and, of course, the
swimsuit issue in February.
They'll also get one of those nifty high
light videos. They're all great, but the
basketball one is my personal favorite.
While the writing in SI sometimes
leaves a bit to be desired, the photography
is the best anywhere. The year-end, year
in-pictures issue is worth the price of
admission all by itself.
If you're behind the times, order them
a year of The Sporting News, a publica

tion in danger of going under because of
The National. A sports daily, The Na
tional is due to start up in late January
or early February. I don't know how sub
scriptions will work, but it might make
a great gift.
Books, of course, are always crowd
pleasers. Anything by Roger Angell will

be a fixture on the shelf for a lifetime.
Roger Kahn's "The Boys of Summer"
might be the greatest baseball book ever
written.
Other selections of less merit are Lou
Holtz' book or anything written by a
member of a recent championship team
in a m«yor sport, especially if its along
the line of "Bad Boys" by any member
of the Detroit Pistons.
Maybe the sports fan in your life isn't
into reading. In that case a videocassette
of a great sports movie might be just the
ticket. My all-time favorite, "Field of
Dreams", will be out by Dec. 10 if you
can wait. If not, you could hardly go
wrong with "The Natural," "Bull Dur
ham," "Slap Shot," or the timeless classic
"Brian's Song."
"Brian's Song" tells the tragic story of
Brian Piccolo, a running back who teams

with the great Gayle Sayers and is dying
of cancer. Guaranteed to bring a tear to
even the most jaded eye.
Less expensive than videos, but still
visually pleasing, are posters. A life-size
Michael Jordan looks great on almost
any wall. For the more eclectic fan, a
Leroy Niemann could do the trick.
Better yet, bring 'em Jordan live — or
Magic Johnson. A pair of courtside seats
at a Warriors-Bulls or Warriors-Lakers
game is a can't-miss selection. If you're
lucky, the person you give the tickets to
will take you along.
Some sporting gear is a good choice for
the active ones in your life. Gloves with
Gore-tex and/or Thinsuiate are ideal for
any skier and reasonably priced. A nice
wool scarf is also a perennial winner.
Hoops fans with access to an indoor
court (wasn't Old Pavilion supposed to

be open to students by now?) would no
doubt appreciate a Wilson real leather
basketball for twinkling the twine with
this winter.
Perhaps your pockets are a little deeper
than most. In that case, a Soloflex
weightlifting machine of a cross-country
ski simulator by Nordic Track are excel
lent choices. Both are expensive, but are
clearly the best in their respective classes.
A membership to a 24 Hour Nautilus
Fitness Center or a season pass at Squaw
Valley are also solid choices, albeit costly
ones.
For around $400, you could buy some
one a picture-in-picture device. This
gadget allows you to simultaneously
watch two programs on the same televi
sion by putting one up in a corner. The


MARK ROGOWSKY
good ones a|low you to switch the one in
the corner to the main screen and switch
the main screen to the corner with a touch
of a button.
Moving from the realm of reality to fan
tasy, I offer these dream gifts:
A Vitale silencer. This electronic device
would mute your TV automatically when
ever Dick Vitale started speaking — on
ESPN or ABC. You'd never have to hear
"PTPer," "He knows what to do with the
rock," or "Slam, bam, jam" again.
Better still: a lifetime pass to the Final
Four. College basketball has become the
most exciting spectator sport in the land.
What better way to enjoy it than to be
there live as the national champion is cho
sen. Every year, something fantas
tic/unbelievable/thrilling happens and as

great as it is on the tube, it just has to
better at the arena.
While we're on the subject, how about
an end to corporate seat-mongering at
major events. This year's Final Four is is
Denver's McNichols Arena. A small facility,
like McNichols, seems to foster those stun
ning upsets like Villanova over Georgetown
and Kansas over Oklahoma.
Thanks to the mega-corporations,
though, only about 1,000 seats are available
to the public. I know the big companies
make these events possible, but you'd think
with the new $1 billion TV package the
NCAA could make it easier for you and I
to get tickets for these events.
Tickets to U.S. Open tennis are another
case in point. Unless your mom works for
one of the sponsors or John McEnroe is
your third cousin, your only chance is the
scalpers. The USTA counts its hordes of
money while the general public is left out
in the cold.
Ah well, we can always dream.

While we're on the subject, how about
an end to corporate seat-mongering at
major events. This year's Final Four is is
Denver's McNichols Arena. A small facility,
like McNichols, seems to foster those stun
ning upsets like Villanova over Georgetown
and Kansas over Oklahoma.
Thanks to the mega-corporations,
though, only about 1,000 seats are available
to the public. I know the big companies
make these events possible, but you'd think
with the new $1 billion TV package the
NCAA could make it easier for you and I
to get tickets for these events.
Tickets to U.S. Open tennis are another
case in point. Unless your mom works for
one of the sponsors or John McEnroe is
your third cousin, your only chance is the
scalpers. The USTA counts its hordes of
money while the general public is left out
in the cold.
Ah well, we can always dream.
There are only 27 shopping days left
until Christmas. For those of you
who haven't selected gifts yet, I
present The Sports Fan's Holiday Shop
ping Guide.
For openers, a surefire stocking stuffer
— guaranteed to please — is a year's
subscription to Sports Illustrated. Order
now and the recipient will get coverage
of the NFL playoffs and, of course, the
swimsuit issue in February.
They'll also get one of those nifty high
light videos. They're all great, but the
basketball one is my personal favorite.
While the writing in SI sometimes
leaves a bit to be desired, the photography
is the best anywhere. The year-end, year
in-pictures issue is worth the price of
admission all by itself.
If you're behind the times, order them
a year of The Sporting News, a publica

tion in danger of going under because of
The National. A sports daily, The Na
tional is due to start up in late January
or early February. I don't know how sub
scriptions will work, but it might make
a great gift.
Books, of course, are always crowd
pleasers. Anything by Roger Angell will

be a fixture on the shelf for a lifetime.
Roger Kahn's "The Boys of Summer"
might be the greatest baseball book ever
written.
Other selections of less merit are Lou
Holtz' book or anything written by a
member of a recent championship team
in a m«yor sport, especially if its along
the line of "Bad Boys" by any member
of the Detroit Pistons.
Maybe the sports fan in your life isn't
into reading. In that case a videocassette
of a great sports movie might be just the
ticket. My all-time favorite, "Field of
Dreams", will be out by Dec. 10 if you
can wait. If not, you could hardly go
wrong with "The Natural," "Bull Dur
ham," "Slap Shot," or the timeless classic
"Brian's Song."
"Brian's Song" tells the tragic story of
Brian Piccolo, a running back who teams

with the great Gayle Sayers and is dying
of cancer. Guaranteed to bring a tear to
even the most jaded eye.
Less expensive than videos, but still
visually pleasing, are posters. A life-size
Michael Jordan looks great on almost
any wall. For the more eclectic fan, a
Leroy Niemann could do the trick.
Better yet, bring 'em Jordan live — or
Magic Johnson. A pair of courtside seats
at a Warriors-Bulls or Warriors-Lakers
game is a can't-miss selection. If you're
lucky, the person you give the tickets to
will take you along.
Some sporting gear is a good choice for
the active ones in your life. Gloves with
Gore-tex and/or Thinsuiate are ideal for
any skier and reasonably priced. A nice
wool scarf is also a perennial winner.
Hoops fans with access to an indoor
court (wasn't Old Pavilion supposed to

be open to students by now?) would no
doubt appreciate a Wilson real leather
basketball for twinkling the twine with
this winter.
Perhaps your pockets are a little deeper
than most. In that case, a Soloflex
weightlifting machine of a cross-country
ski simulator by Nordic Track are excel
lent choices. Both are expensive, but are
clearly the best in their respective classes.
A membership to a 24 Hour Nautilus
Fitness Center or a season pass at Squaw
Valley are also solid choices, albeit costly
ones.
For around $400, you could buy some
one a picture-in-picture device. This
gadget allows you to simultaneously
watch two programs on the same televi
sion by putting one up in a corner. The


MARK ROGOWSKY
good ones a|low you to switch the one in
the corner to the main screen and switch
the main screen to the corner with a touch
of a button.
Moving from the realm of reality to fan
tasy, I offer these dream gifts:
A Vitale silencer. This electronic device
would mute your TV automatically when
ever Dick Vitale started speaking — on
ESPN or ABC. You'd never have to hear
"PTPer," "He knows what to do with the
rock," or "Slam, bam, jam" again.
Better still: a lifetime pass to the Final
Four. College basketball has become the
most exciting spectator sport in the land.
What better way to enjoy it than to be
there live as the national champion is cho
sen. Every year, something fantas
tic/unbelievable/thrilling happens and as

great as it is on the tube, it just has to
better at the arena.
