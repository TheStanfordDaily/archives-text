# Gritty grapplers won't play as Gator bait
## 
### Jim Smith 
After a grueling weekend trip
to Oregon, the Stanford wrestling
team carries its 2-1 record to San
Francisco State tonight to face
the Division II Gators.
Under coach Chris Horpel, the
Cardinal grapplers have amassed
a 6-3 record against the Gators
and have won the last three con
tests, including 28-15 and 24-19
wins last year. However, San
Francisco expects to challenge the
Cardinal this year.
The Cardinal wrestlers have
looked tough, and coming off a

19-16 victory over defending Di
vision II champion Portland
State, a confident Stanford team
has different ideas.
"We just beat the defending Di
vision II national champions and
there is no reason we should lose
to a lower caliber team," said co
captain Steve Buddie. "We should
just hurdle over teams like this."
San Francisco returns two-time
All-American Rick Goodwin at
118 pounds to face Cardinal fresh
man Josh Fleming. In addition,
the Gators will send three junior
college state place-winners and a
high school state place-winner to

the mat. One decisive match will
be between sophomore Mark
Graham and last year's junior col
lege state champion at 167
pounds.
"Local teams like San Francisco
State get pumped to beat us since
we are bigger and a Division I
school," said Coach Horpel. "They
pick up the top transfers from
the junior colleges and this
usually makes for a good rivalry."
While the Cardinal expects to
defeat the Gators, they will face
some problems with the loss of
it\jured heavyweight Trent Smith
last week. Usually facing 300-

pound behemoths, the 190-pound
senior has consistently pulled out
big wins, including last year when
his victory assured the Cardinal
of a 24-19 win over San Francisco.
Without Smith, Horpel plans to
juggle the lineup at the heavier
weights.
"Depending on how close the
match is, we may put Mat Nowlis
in at 177 pounds, bump Buddie
to 190, and wrestle Ron Perry at
heavyweight," said Horpel.
Also injured for the Cardinal
are freshman Lance Johnson and
senior Geoff Baum. Johnson re
cently ii\jured his shoulder and
will have to undergo surgery,
making him doubtful for the rest
of the season. Baum has a
sprained ankle but does not expect
to be sidelined for long.
Stanford will finish the week
at the Las Vegas tournament
where they will face top competi
tion from all over the nation. The
next home match will be Jan. 5
against 15th-ranked Notre Dame.
