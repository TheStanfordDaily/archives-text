Intramural playoff teams
have rounded the final bend
for thf» stretch run, and with
whips flaying and froth flying,
the stage is set for a heart
stopping finish.

IM sports report

Tournaments, which range
from handball to three-on
throe basketball to tennis, have
narrowed down to four or eight
teams. By next Tuesday all of
the fall intramural sports will
have champions.
The inner tube water polo
final four is set. Club Med and
SchifT will be trying to prevent
an all-Biz final as the playoffs
resume this weekend. Biz 2B
plays Club Med in one semi
final, and Biz IB goes up
against Schiff in the other
semifinal.
In B-league football, the last
qualifier for the quarterfinals
was set on Tuesday as the
Hardhats (4-2) upset the third
ranked and previously unde
feated Betas 17-14 in a
stunning 17-14 victory.
The Hardhats, civil engineer
ing graduate students, jumped
out to an early 2-0 lead when
defensive lineman Bill Cords
tagged Beta quarterback Craig
Owen in the end zone for a
safety. The Betas' offense was
ineffective in the first half,
moving backward more often
than forward.
The Hardhats next opponent
is Kemet Nu, 6-0 winners over

Flo Mo in their last game.
Kemet Nu features a run and
shoot offense, with up to four
players rotating at quarterback
with surprising effectiveness.
In another quarterfinal
match-up, Kappa Sigma faces
Oh Larry. Kappa Sigma has
not been scored on yet in the
playoffs, winning 7-0 and 6-0.
With the number two, three,
and four seeds eliminated from
the playoffs, the first-seed In
visible Hands have the inside
track to the championship.
The B-league quarterfinal
games will be played Thursday,
with the semifinals on Friday
and the final Sunday at 2:00
pm.
The Daily Sports C-league
team enters the playoffs with
momentum, fresh oft two late
season victories and a 28-7
thumping of the Daily
Californian in the Ink Bowl.
The Daily opens against
Roble on Wednesday, with the
winner facing Okada Friday in
the semifinals.
The Daily will be hoping to
utilize the height of 6-foot-5
receiver and Daily Sports
Editor Nat Cousins. Often con
fused with Stanford Cardinal
receiver Ed McCaffrey — more
because of his height than his
ability — Cousins is the man
the Daily looks to in key situ
ations.
IM notes
All tournaments must be com
pleted by Tuesday If your team la
still in a tournament, you should
contact your opponent and
schedule a game immediately If
you are unsure of your opponent,
