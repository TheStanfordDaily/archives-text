# Card out-jibes Japanese sails

The Stanford sailing team's Thanksgiving turkey
had a definite international flavor and left an af
tertaste of sushi.
Competing nationally and internationally over
Thanksgiving break, the Cardinal sailors finished
second at the U.S.-Japan Collegiate Challenge in
Newport Beach, Calif., and placed 10th at the Timme
Angsten Regatta in Chicago.
Robert Brown and Heidi Park helped the U.S.
dominate the Japanese in the Goodwill Regatta at
Newport Beach. Teams from California placed first,
second and third in the challenge, followed closely
by Nihun University and Chuo University of Japan.
The Cardinal finished behind top-ranked UC-Irvine.
The first annual challenge was a success by all
accounts. Sponsored by Japanese corporations, the
regatta set new standards for organization and hos
pitality.
"Even the language barrier couldn't get in the
way of good sailing and a good time," said Brown,
who was impressed with the well-coordinated event.
On Lake Michigan, four Cardinal sailors competed
at the annual Timme Angsten Regatta, placing 10th
overall in the 18-boat fleet.
Matt Sanford and Lydia Snape placed ninth in A
division and Brett Adams and Evita Rend finished
eighth in B division.
In the wild, flukey conditions of the first two
days on Lake Michigan, the Cardinal placed well,
with both teams finishing in the top five. But on
the third day, in a position to take sixth place for
the regatta, the Stanford sailors lost focus and
finished at the back of the fleet in most of the
races. However, their lOth-place finish was only 25
points out of sixth.
"It was frustrating, we knew what we had to do
and we couldn't do it," Adams said.
Stanford will open its spring season in January,
when the push toward nationals begins.
