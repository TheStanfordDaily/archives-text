More than 100 Graduate School of
Business students today will repair home
less shelters, serve in soup kitchens and
work with students at a local grade school
as part of Business School Volunteer Day.
According to Business School Assoc.
News Director Cathy Castillo, the goal
of the event is to have every business

student participate in a charitable activity
at least one day out of the year.
"They're considering whether to do it
again next year," Castillo said. "They
certainly plan to make it an annual
event."
The idea of a volunteer day was born
when six student groups decided to pool
their resources to give business students
an opportunity to participate in not-for
profit activities.

The six groups that organized and
sponsored the event are Students Against
Homelessness, Food Net, the Flood School
Project, GSB Volunteers, Challenge for
Charity and the Public Management Pro
gram.
The coordinators say they hope to in
still in students the habit of doing vol
unteer work so they will continue to
volunteer after graduation.
One of the organizations that will ben

efit from Volunteer Day is Family Living
Centers, which operates homeless shelters
in Menio Park and in Redwood City.
The Menlo Park shelter houses 16
families, and the Redwood City shelter
houses nine families, according to
Rosemary Rodriguez, an employee of the
center.
At the shelters, the Business School
volunteers will do general repair work,
play with the children and organize ac

tivities for Christmas.
Other charitable organizations will also
receive assistance. Students will work in
soup kitchens at Glide Memorial Church
in San Francisco and at St. Anthony de
Padua's dining hall in Menlo Park.
Students will also work at the Flood
School in East Palo Alto and build and
repair trails for the Mid-Peninsula Open
Space District, which maintains public
land in the Stanford area.
