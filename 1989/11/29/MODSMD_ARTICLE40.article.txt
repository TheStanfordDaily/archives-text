Predicting that 1989 would be
remembered as "the year the last
colonial empire began to disin
tegrate," former U.S. Ambassador
Richard Starr summarized the
events leading up to the recent
changes in Eastern Europe in a
speech last night at Kresge Audi
torium.
Starr, a Hoover fellow, pin
pointed several areas within East
ern Europe that would not change
rapidly, namely foreign trade and
the Warsaw Pact, which still
maintains 565,000 Soviet troops
in Eastern Europe.
Asked about the potential inclu
sion of Eastern Europe in the
Western European Economic
Community, Starr replied that he
did not foresee this until
"economies are compatible — that
means convertible currencies as a
prerequisite, and similar econ
omies — that means not a com
mand economy." Without the
elimination of a command, or
centralized, economy, he contin
ued, foreign assistance will "go

countries.

down the drain like it has before,"
he said.
Starr described West Germany
as developing an "intermediate
stage leading to reunification,"
while the United States was cau
tious and fearful of the potential
economic powerhouse of a
reunified Germany.
According to Starr, Moscow
played an important role in the
transitions through strategic
phone calls and the work of Soviet
ambassadors in Eastern Europe,
yet he said the Soviet Union has
different, deeper problems than
those of the Eastern European

countries. The USSR has yet to
gain support from its border
regions, explained Starr; from the
Baltics to the Ukraine to the
southern Muslim republics, "they
all feel like they have been con
quered."
Starr gave one-line predictions
for the political futures of coun
tries in Eastern Europe. He stated
that East Germany would tend
toward a brand of socialism found
in Sweden, while Poland, "because
of its strong ties to the United
States — through relatives and
assistance" would strive more for
an American-style economy. For
Czechoslovakia, Starr referred to
their inter-war period as a "model
democracy," while Hungary
would perhaps turn to its Austro-
Hungarian heritage and work
toward socialism.
Starr participated in the
Mutual and Balanced Force Re
duction negotiations in Vienna
and is the author of two books,
"Communism in Eastern Eu
rope," and "U.S.-Eastem Euro
pean Relations in the 19905,"
which was published this year.

Europe in a speech in Kresge Auditorium last night. He predicted that East Germany and Hungary would
