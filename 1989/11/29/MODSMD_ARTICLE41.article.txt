# Fast to aid hunger relief projects
## 
### Alex Hoye Staff writer 
Remember when your mother
used to tell you to finish eating
because "there are people starving
in the world who would love to
have that dinner?" And remember
the quintessential reply, "then
why don't you send it to them?"
Tomorrow the Stanford Inter
national Development Organiza
tion kicks off its own variation
on that age-old scenario. Each
year the student-run organization
sponsors a fast in which they ask
Stanford students to turn in their
meal cards for a day and then
donate the money that would have
been spent on food to various relief
groups. Participants this year
must turn in their meal cards
after dinner tonight.
This year the group will dis
tribute these funds among several
groups active in hunger relief and
development. The projects range
in scope from the Palo Alto Ecu

menical Hunger Project to the In
ternational Development Ex
change, which focuses on the im
provement of living conditions in
the Third World.
The event not only works to
put food on the table of the un
dernourished, but also to spread
awareness of the worldwide
hunger problem to the members
of the Stanford community, or
ganizers say.
"The project is not solely fo
cused on hunger, but also pro
motes development worldwide,"
according to junior Waseem Noor,
one of the project's co-chairs. The
organizations to benefit from the
fast were selected for their differ
ent approaches for the promotion
of development around the world,
he said.
Noor, originally from poverty
stricken Bangladesh, stressed that
the "activities of the organization
are not just to teach, but provide
introspection as well."
In addition to the fast, the de

velopment group has organized a
speaker series which will cover
topics in hunger and development.
Tonight Political Science Prof. Da
vid Abernethy will speak on the
topic "Why Should I Fast?" in
Casa Zapata at 6:30.
Last night the group sponsored
a panel discussing ways to solve
world hunger. The panel featured
Anthropology Prof. Partha Gupta
and representatives from the In
ternational Development Ex
change and Global Exchange, two
international development organ
izations benefiting from the event.
The event has taken place for
several years now and last year
raised about $3,000. The organi
zation members say they hope to
make the event into a biannual
one.
The group sponsors a movie se
ries and speaker series through
the year and encourages those in
terested to join them every Wed
nesday at 6:30 at the Haas Public
Service Center.
