## Salvadoran opposition seeks political freedom 
### Michelle Campos 
"It is clear that the Salvadoran
people have made a decision not
to turn back in history, but to
give concrete steps for real de
mocracy and peace," said Gladis
Sibrian, a representative of the
opposition party of El Salvador,
in a speech last night in Meyer
Library.
According to Sibrian, her party,
the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front/Democratic
Revolutionary Front, has sought
a peaceful end to the 10-year civil
war raging in El Salvador, but
the ruling Arena government has
refused to negotiate with repre
sentatives.
On several occasions, the oppo
sition party has proposed a cease
fire to the government, but the
latest received "a total rejection,"
she said. Instead, the government
is looking for the destruction of
opposition movements, and, in ef
fect, a military victory, Sibrian
said.
"How can we go to another
meeting with them when every
thing is a declaration of total war,
not just to the FMLN but to
anyone in El Salvador that op
poses the oppressive system?"
Sibrian said.
She said the apparent stubborn
ness of the Arena government is
the reason the opposition this

month launched a political, mili
tary and diplomatic offensive
against the Arena government.
The opposition party says it rep
resents the Salvadoran people who
"cannot tolerate any longer the
level of the lack of democracy and
social ir\justice," she said. These
injustices have been magnified
since the right-wing Arena party
took control in June. Sibrian
claimed that the elections held
last May, while called "a presen
tation of the democratic system,"
were actually fascist in nature.
Citing last week's massacre of
six Jesuit priests, their house
keeper and her daughter, al
legedly by the ruling government,
as proof of the Arena govern
ment's violent nature, Sibrian said
"this is who we are talking with
at the negotiating tables."
Sibrian said she holds the
United States government respon
sible for the Arena dictatorship.
The U.S. government has been
funding the Salvadoran govern
ment for the past 10 years and
has given them over $4 billion in
aid.

Sibrian said it is time for a
change in U.S. policy. "We are not
able to stop them, but the United
States can," Sibrian said. "If the
U.S. government will withhold aid
to the Arena government and
armed forces, they will
[negotiate)."
