unique individuals in Stanford's
graduate schools.

If God had meant for man to
fly, he would have given him
wings.
A Stanford graduate student
once had those wings: 112-foot
spans of graphite and mylar given
to him by a very human team of
researchers and technicians
Frank Scioscia, now a first-year
student in the Law School, was
one of five pilots — all top-notch
cyclists — chosen to power the
Daedalus Project, a 1988 attempt
to trace the flight of the mythical
Greek hero with a modern,
human-powered aircraft.
One of the five would pedal the
fragile, 68-pound Daedalus '88
through the air 72 miles from the
Greek island of Crete to Santorini,
or like Icarus, Daedalus' ill-fated
son, crash into the Aegean Sea.
The task would require the pilot
to be rested, and the weather to
be perfect. The five pilots — four
Americans and one Greek — were
put on a rotating schedule, with
one ready to fly on any given day
and the other four in training.
A perfect Saturday morning
dawned April 23, after nearly a
month in Greece, and five month's
training in the United States. Sat
urday was the Greek pilot's "ready

day," so Kanellos Kanellopoulos,
a 14-time Greek national cycling
champion, climbed into the plane
and pedaled himself to Santorini's
Perissa Beach and three world
records.
"I used to kid around, saying
that if I was the one I could have
been doing Coca-Cola commercials
or been on David Letterman,"
Scioscia recalls. "That had been
my big hope — to be on David
Letterman."
Scioscia, 27, says he always had
law school in the back of his mind.
"I was finishing my applications
at JFK (airport), with them all
spread out around me on the
lobby floor, an hour before I left
for Greece and the Daedalus proj
ect," he says.
When he graduated from
Lehigh University in 1983 with a
degree in economics, Scioscia
thought he would "just race [that]
summer, and then start working."
He had even taken a job with a
consulting firm, delaying his
starting date until September.
At all his job interviews senior
year, Scioscia says, people would
ask "what do you want to be doing
in five years?" As he began to
think "what really do I want to
do?" he realized that what he
wanted to do more than anything,
"was race my bike," he says.
Already a seven-year racing vet
eran, Scioscia competed in "all the
