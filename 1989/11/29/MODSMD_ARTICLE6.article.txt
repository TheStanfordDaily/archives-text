# Cyclist, law student missed chance to fly

Editor's note: This is the third
article in a four-part series on
unique individuals in Stanford's
graduate schools.

If God had meant for man to
fly, he would have given him
wings.
A Stanford graduate student
once had those wings: 112-foot
spans of graphite and mylar given
to him by a very human team of
researchers and technicians
Frank Scioscia, now a first-year
student in the Law School, was
one of five pilots — all top-notch
cyclists — chosen to power the
Daedalus Project, a 1988 attempt
to trace the flight of the mythical
Greek hero with a modern,
human-powered aircraft.
One of the five would pedal the
fragile, 68-pound Daedalus '88
through the air 72 miles from the
Greek island of Crete to Santorini,
or like Icarus, Daedalus' ill-fated
son, crash into the Aegean Sea.
The task would require the pilot
to be rested, and the weather to
be perfect. The five pilots — four
Americans and one Greek — were
put on a rotating schedule, with
one ready to fly on any given day
and the other four in training.
A perfect Saturday morning
dawned April 23, after nearly a
month in Greece, and five month's
training in the United States. Sat
urday was the Greek pilot's "ready

day," so Kanellos Kanellopoulos,
a 14-time Greek national cycling
champion, climbed into the plane
and pedaled himself to Santorini's
Perissa Beach and three world
records.
"I used to kid around, saying
that if I was the one I could have
been doing Coca-Cola commercials
or been on David Letterman,"
Scioscia recalls. "That had been
my big hope — to be on David
Letterman."
Scioscia, 27, says he always had
law school in the back of his mind.
"I was finishing my applications
at JFK (airport), with them all
spread out around me on the
lobby floor, an hour before I left
for Greece and the Daedalus proj
ect," he says.
When he graduated from
Lehigh University in 1983 with a
degree in economics, Scioscia
thought he would "just race [that]
summer, and then start working."
He had even taken a job with a
consulting firm, delaying his
starting date until September.
At all his job interviews senior
year, Scioscia says, people would
ask "what do you want to be doing
in five years?" As he began to
think "what really do I want to
do?" he realized that what he
wanted to do more than anything,
"was race my bike," he says.
Already a seven-year racing vet
eran, Scioscia competed in "all the

of the mythical Daedalus.
major races in the U.S." in the
summer of 1983. At the end, he
says,"I realized I didn't want to
cash in my one opportunity to do
this thing full-fledged and with
all my heart. I would do it until
I felt I had got everything out of
it."
Four years later, after countless
races and three trips to the hospi
tal — one for a feared broken
neck — Scioscia "was ready to
stop."
"The same time I was ready to
say 'I've given this thing as much
of a shot as I can give it,' " Scioscia
says,"I got the call to test for
the Daedalus Project."
Scioscia believes the rigors of
amateur athletics have prepared
him for those of law school. The
six years he spent between Lehigh
and Stanford weren't a lark, he
says.
"Amateur athletics are very dif

ficult. You're not earning any
money, and you need it to get
yourself to events. At the same
time, if you work too hard earning
money, then you can't compete at
the level you need to, so you might
as well not go to the event,"he
says.
To support his racing, Scioscia
sold vacuum cleaners door-to-door
and insurance over the phone.
Although no one in Scioscia's
family in Scranton, Pa., is "much
of an athlete," he says, they gave
him a great deal of support. That
support was vital, because "you're
questioning your existence quite
a bit as an amateur athlete," he
says.
Scioscia says he was always ask
ing himself "What am I doing,
why am I doing it?" If his family
had been asking the same ques
tions, "it would have been a lot
more difficult," he says.
"When I decided to race, as a
21-year-old graduating college,"
Scioscia says,"the only people
who ever gave me any kind of

grief were my peers, who didn't
have the perspective of the older
people who said 'Do what you
want to do.' "
Now, two months into his first
semester as a law student, Scioscia
says "there's still a small part of
me that says 'maybe I should have
raced one more year.' " Fortunate
ly, he quips, it's not a large part.
"But I couldn't be happier that
I stepped out of the normal track
for the length of time I did," he
adds.
Ironically, as a new Stanford
student Scioscia at first stayed
away from his bike. Now, how
ever, he is starting to ride every
day. He says he would like to ride
with the cycling team if club
sports rules will allow it.
Stanford is hosting the 1990
Collegiate National Champion
ships for cycling, and Scioscia
hopes he can help the team bring
home the national title.
"That is," he says, "if I don't
get hit by one of the bike riders
zipping around campus."
