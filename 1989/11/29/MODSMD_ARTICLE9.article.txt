# Business School students found worldwide service organization
## 
### Doug Fine Staff writer 
A group of Graduate School of
Business students has traveled
worldwide over the past few years
enlisting support for a self
organized service group that they
hope will become "a Peace Corps
of the '905."
Business student Bill McGlas
han Jr. is optimistic about the
prospects for the World Service
Project, the group he helped
found nearly two years ago, and
is encouraged by the achievements
of the organization thus far.
The main goal of the group is
to enhance existing service organ
izations around the world by of
fering financial, administrative
and practical support in the areas
of environmental preservation,
hunger and other areas of con
cern.
"The original idea for the proj
ect came about when I was in
volved in an exchange program in
the Soviet Union, and a group of
us, both Soviet and American stu
dents, agreed that there was some
thing inherently non-productive
about student exchanges,"
McGlashan said. He felt that not
much was accomplished by sitting
around talking, and he wanted to
do more.
Upon arriving at Stanford,
McGlashan launched his plan.
Using a $78,000 grant from the
Beyond War Foundation, and later
funds from the Rockefeller Foun
dation and private donors, he
worked full-time with several
friends for about four months,

traveling around the country and
abroad to places like Costa Rica,
Tanzania and the Soviet Union
in an attempt to enlist support
for his fledgling organization.
"By speaking with several other
organizations, such as Habitat For
Humanity, we tried to find out
what they're doing right, what
they're doing wrong, what can be
done differently," McGlashan said.
"We came up with a basic idea
that if we could get greater
cooperation (among similar or
ganizations), we could develop
incredible synergies."
A m£\jor theme of the group
was that a multinational team
working on a project could be even
more effective than traditional
single-nation organizations like
the Peace Corps.
"Rather than become just an
other huge bureaucratic organi
zation, we saw ourselves as a
service organization broker,"
McGlashan said. He added that
such organizational work has
never before been done.
Because World Service Project
is multinational, and some of its
members are from developing na
tions themselves, its founders
hope that it can eliminate tradi
tional feelings of resentment
toward service volunteers and
their powerful developed nation
sponsors.
The group's pilot project — de
veloping parks and trails in a rain
forest at Guanacaste National
Park in Costa Rica — has been
underway for about a year.

organizations.

describes this type of project as
"eco-tourism," which involves not
only saving the rain forest, but
also generating income for the lo
cal community through tourism.
The team working on the current
project consists of an American,
a Tanzanian, a Costa Rican and
a Soviet.
The World Service Project en
joys notable support. Several U.S.
senators and representatives are
involved, and Costa Rican Presi
dent and Nobel laureate Oscar
Arias Sanchez sits on the board
of directors of the organization.
Business School Prof. George
Parker, a former Peace Corps vol
unteer, is also helping Olsen with
long-term business development.
The group's long-range plans
are still vague, according to Olsen.
There are service projects in the
planning stage, such as develop
mental ideas in the Soviet Union
and the United States, but con
tinued success might be cause for
a re-evaluation of the founders'
roles within the organization.
"We are, after all, full-time stu
dents," McGlashan said. "It's un
realistic to assume that we could
manage this type of organization
beyond the start-up stage that
we're in right now. It's been tough

to do, but a great experience,"
Olsen added.
"As we expand, we have to ask
ourselves, 'What should we do?
Hire a person to work full-time
in conjunction with us? . . . Should
we hook up with some organiza
tion which already has an estab
lished infrastructure and

resources in place?' We'd love to
hear from people who have ideas
about how to make the move from
a pilot project to a full-blown,
long-term program. We're just a
bunch of young people who
started something," McGlashan
said.
The members admit there are

many unanswered questions
about the project's future. Among
the factors the group's leaders will
have to face are the establishment
of clear goals and caution about
the organization becoming too bu
reaucratic. What they do know
now is that, as McGlashan said,
"We've proven it works."
