COMMITTEE OF THE WEEK
The COMMITTEE ON UNDERGRADUATE
ADMISSIONS AND FINANCIAL AID is a policy
setting body that oversees the Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aids offices.
Last year the committee decided to
continue the Pro-Fro Travel Grant Program
(paying for visiting costs of minority and Jordan
Scholar pro-fros who have a high level of financial
need). In addition, the committee discussed the
lowering of the self-help requirement. A meeting
was held to consider the slowing down of planned
increases of financial aid. There was also
discussion on targeting minority groups for
admission as well as continuing to exercise non
bias with the increasing trend of Asian-American
applicants.
This year the committee will focus on the
UCMI findings regarding minority issues on
campus.
