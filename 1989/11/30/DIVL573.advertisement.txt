The ASSU Council of Presidents would like to wish you the best of the
Season's Greetings — whether you celebrate Christmas, Chanukah, Kwanzaa,
or nothing at all. This past quarter has been a most trying one for us all, but in
the aftermath of the earthquake we have shown the strong and caring character
of our community as we've come together to help rebuild Stanford as well as those
communities most in need. As for the ASSU, most of our projects are underway
and our campaigns in motion. Through these, we have been able to involve more
students than ever before in working for a postive change on campus. However,
our New Year's resolution is to bring even more people to the ASSU to help us
build a better Stanford. So go home, rest, and enjoy the holidays with your family.
