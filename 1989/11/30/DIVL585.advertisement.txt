There is a better way to earn your wings.
In this day and age, earning your wings is no easy task.
We at the Stanford Flying Club can help. We offer flying lessons at affordable prices.
Our Instructor-Pilots will take you all the way from your first lesson to your pilot's
license. Most students obtain their Solo License with only 10 to 20 hours of flying time,
And we also have advanced and aerobatics classes when you're ready.
Give us a call today and find out more. Earning your wings was never so much fun.
