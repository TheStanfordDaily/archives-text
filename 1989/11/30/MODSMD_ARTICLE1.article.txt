# Jackson sentenced, reprimanded
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
Louis Jackson's six-month legal saga ended
yesterday with the imposition of a six-month
probation period and 70 hours of community
service work.
As part of a plea bargain, Jackson last week
entered a "no contest" plea to charges of
trespassing and resisting arrest in connection
with the May 15 takeover of University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's office. In exchange
for his plea, the district attorney agreed to
effectively drop four of the charges Jackson
had faced, including inciting to riot and bat
tery.
Yesterday, in addition to sentencing for the
two remaining charges, Jackson received a
scathing lecture from Palo Alto Muncipal
Court Judge Stephen Manley. During his 30-
minute lecture, Manley questioned Jackson's
future commitment to working within the law.
"It's not clear to me, Mr. Jackson, that you
understand . . . what you're responsible for,"
Manley said.
"Unless you understand, then we should
take this case to trial.... If I'm going to
uphold this plea bargain between you and the
district attorney, I'm going to have to be
satisfied that you are prepared to uphold the
law and work in the confines of the law."
Prior to his sentencing, Jackson read a
prepared statement explaining why he partic
ipated in last spring's takeover of the Presi
dent's office.
"I was aware that it took bold and dramatic
action in the 1960s to create black studies
programs and to raise University sensitivity
to issues of racism and pluralism," Jackson
said. "It seemed to me it was time once again
to act in that tradition."
Much of his impetus to participate in the
takeover resulted from his frustration with
the University's response to incidents in
Ujamaa House last year, Jackson said. Last
fall, two freshmen defaced a flier in a racially

offensive manner but were not punished under
the Fundamental Standard.
"The University chose to put the issue of
speech above the issue of freedom of harass
ment even though the clear and present danger
stemmed from . . . racial harassment," Jackson
said. "These and other concerns left me no
choice but to become involved in the peaceful
occupation of President Kennedy's office."
Jackson said that he was willing to suffer
the consequences of his actions, but that he
and the other protesters expected to be treated
"fairly and equally."
Manley said Jackson's plea for equal treat
ment showed a cloudy perception of simplistic
laws. "[The lawsl are very clear and they
become very unclear when you begin to ad
dress them as questions of freedom of speech,
the right to equal protection . . . and so forth,"
he said. "What I'm talking about are very
clear statutes."

Upon futher questioning of Jackson, Manley
said he would take Jackson's word that he
would work within the law during his proba
tion period and beyond.
Jackson's community service hours should
serve as proof of Jackson's commitment to
issues of multiculturalism, Manley said.
"Seventy hours [of service] is all 1 expect,"
Manley said. "But if you truly believe every
thing you've said, then it's my expectation
that I don't have to ask you to do 3,000 hours
of work, because you'll gladly do it on your
own."
Manley said that although Jackson's offen
ses were punishable with jail time, he believed
service was the preferable alternative. "Jail
and incarceration is a punishment," Manley
said. "Society gains when you, Mr. Jackson,
help other people, because you are one of the
very few who are privileged to attend a great
university, who have great talents."
