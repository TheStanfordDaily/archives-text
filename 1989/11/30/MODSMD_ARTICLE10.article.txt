Soviet exchange takes off
The Soviets from Novosibirsk have cut
through the red tape and are coming to

Pete Hopkins, director of the Stanford

from Novosibirsk earlier this week saying
the 14 Soviet students had finally obtained
plane tickets on Aeroflot. The trip, originally
scheduled for this fall, was delayed because
of a backlog in ticket availability to the
United States.

The Soviet students will visit the U.S. for
two weeks. Stanford students will be return
ing to the Soviet Union in September for
the reciprocal exchange.
The Soviets will visit Los Angeles for three
or four days and will spend the rest of the
trip staying in dorms at Stanford, participat
ing in campus programs.
