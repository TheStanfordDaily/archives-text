Some served as peppy Pro Fro
coordinators. Others act as dedi
cated tutors. But all 12 share a
common goal — bettering the
Stanford community.
Last night, these 12 students
received the Dean's Award for
Outstanding Service to the Stan
ford community — an honor
presented by Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons and University
President Donald Kennedy.
Throughout the year, Stanford
faculty and staff nominate a group
of students, from which Lyons
selects the award winners at the
end of each quarter.
The fall quarter winners are
Kim Akers, Ted DesMaisons, Da
vid Frazee, Kim Geil, David Hor
nik, Alysia Hubbard, Jonathan
Jansen, John Keller, Daniel Nash,
Suzanne O'Brien, Morris Sim and
Jacqueline Trager.
Responsible for welcoming 600
prospective freshmen to the Farm
last year, freshmen Kim Geil,

Recipients were cited for long and extra
hours' of work, uncommon energy and
'unusual skill' in making service contributions
to Stanford.

John Keller and Morris Sim were
nominated by Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions Jean Fetter and
Asst. Admissions Director Greg
Smith for their efficient organi
zation of Prospective Freshman
Week.
Sophomore David Frazee, who
together with DesMaisons and
O'Brien dedicated his time to
educating the community about
acquaintance rape, said the most
important aspect of winning the
award was that the complexity of
rape issues was being recognized.
Frazee said the rewards help
counteract the "burnout level
(that) is very high with people
involved in public service."
The three students had to
analyze endless amounts of data,

conduct numerous surveys and
hold presentations campus-wide to
educate the community, he said.
Lyons recognized Kim Akers,
Alysia Hubbard and Daniel Nash
for "long and extra hours" of work
as tutors for student athletes at
the Academic Resource Center.
A student athlete herself, Hub
bard said she could understand
the time management struggles
that athletes experience and
found that morning tutorial ses
sions helped students who usually
have practice in the afternoons.
It was "a joy helping people," she
said.
Lyons recognized Jonathan
Jansen for his success as chair of
the Stanford African Students As

sociation, calling Jansen an "un
commonly energetic educator
about conditions in South Africa."
David Hornik was nominated
by Kennell Jackson, professor of
history and Branner Hall resident
fellow, for his leadership of Bran
ner Presents — an annual dorm
series that draws well-known
speakers and performers. Accord
ing to Jackson, Hornik "is one of
the sweetest people you can meet
and a great person to work with."
Praised for her counseling work
and other contributions to the Bi
ological Sciences Department, Jac
queline Trager was nominated for
her "unusual skill in finding re
search opportunities and caring
advisers" and for "organizing par
ties, courses and lecture series,"
according to Lyons. Trager also
acts as a counselor and tutor.
Lyons said that the success of
the award program depends on
Stanford faculty and staff
nominating students who contrib
ute exceptionally to the
University
