## Bush prepares for summit 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush'B weekend summit with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev should leave the superpow
ers "better prepared to make sub
stantial progress" on a treaty to
slash long-range nuclear weapons,
Secretary of State James A. Baker
111 said yesterday.
However, he emphasized anew
that no such agreement would be
reached during the two-day meet
ing.
In a pre-summit news confer
ence at the White House, Baker
also said the democratic reforms
that are bringing down Eastern
Europe's hard-line communist
regimes are "the only path to
long-term legitimacy and stability
in the region," and he warned
against any crackdown by author
ities.
While saying Moscow has not
stood in the way of the stunning
changes, Baker declared, "We
firmly believe that any attempts
to forcibly intervene and prevent
continued reform will be ex
tremely destabilizing and danger
ous."
The secretary spoke on the eve

of the president's departure for
the Mediterranean island of
Malta. Bush and Gorbachev will
hold talks Saturday and Sunday
on U.S. and Soviet warships
anchored in Malta's Marsaxlokk
Bay.
Bush spent yesterday preparing
for his first meeting as president
with Gorbachev, discussing the
talks in a telephone conversation
with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said the two
leaders also talked about Kohl's
new proposal Tuesday for a con
federation with East Germany as
a step toward eventual reunifica
tion.
On that point, Baker said, "If
there's unification, it should occur
in the context of Germany's con
tinued alignment with NATO and
an increasingly integrated Euro
pean Community."
Mindful of some reservations
among U.S. allies in Europe,
Baker said he preferred a gradual,
step-by-step process of bringing
the two Germanys together.
At his news conference, Baker

'Either the Nicara
guans are lying to the
Soviet Union or the
Soviet Union is lying
to us.'

said Bush would complain to Gor
bachev about what U.S. officials
say is a continuing flow of Soviet
made weapons to the Moscow
backed government of Afghani
stan, as well as to leftist rebels
in El Salvador through Nicaragua.
Noting that Soviet officials have
promised to prevent Nicaragua
from shipping Soviet arms to El
Salvador, Baker said, "Either the
Nicaraguans are lying to the So
viet Union or the Soviet Union is
lying to us.
"We prefer to believe it's the
former."
At the White House, Baker
hailed warmer ties between Wash
ington and Moscow and said, "We
want reforms in Soviet domestic,
foreign and defense policy to
succeed."
