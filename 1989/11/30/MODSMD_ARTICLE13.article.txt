# Fighting resumes in El Salvador; Embassy dependents evacuated
## 
### 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -
Leftist rebels invaded parts of the capi
tal's most affluent neighborhoods before
dawn yesterday and dug in after often
fierce combat with government forces.
How many people had been killed in
the latest guerrilla offensive was not
clear. Eleven bodies of combatants were
seen lying in the streets.
In Washington, Secretary of State
James A. Baker 111 said guerrillas "briefly
overran" a U.S. Embassy officer's home
and "we are taking steps to assure the
safety of embassy personnel."
Embassy personnel were told not to
report to work yesterday, and the em
bassy was closed for the day, White House
spokesman Roman Popadiuk said. Ad
ministration officials said no Americans
were injured.
A State Department committee moni
toring events in El Salvador reported that
the home of the embassy employee, who
was not identified, apparently was seized
at random.
"The family was safely evacuated by

'Our units have instruc
tions not to attack
North American per
sonnel.'

Salvadoran government forces, and the
family was not actually in the hands of
the guerrillas at any time," said David
Denny, a department spokesman.
Heavy and sustained fire was reported
blocks from the residence of U.S. Am
bassador William Walker. Embassy
spokesman Jeff Brown had said Walker
was "fine ... working in his office at the
embassy."
Denny said, "Several families are un
able to leave their homes because of fight
ing in their locations," which included
the neighborhoods of San Benito, Escalon
and San Francisco.
A statement from the leftist guerrillas

said their fighters had been told not to
attack Americans.
Guerrillas took over the Japanese Em
bassy, four blocks from Walker's house,
an El Salvador Foreign Ministry source
said privately.
He said only a few embassy personnel
were inside and the insurgents allowed
relief workers to evacuate them.
A diplomatic source, also speaking
anonymously, said the guerrillas seized
the residence of a French diplomat, but
allowed those inside to be evacuated. He
gave no details.
U.S. Embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs
said a charter flight might depart today
with embassy dependents who want to
leave El Salvador, and embassy personnel
who planned to go home for Christmas
would leave early.
He said some dependents and other
Americans had moved into the heavily
fortified embassy in downtown San Sal
vador to get away from the fighting a
few miles away.
A home about a half-mile from Walker's

house was burned after having been taken
over by rebels, and unconfirmed reports
said a U.S. Embassy employee lived in
it. The Washington officials said nothing
of a fire at the house seized by rebels.
Whether rebels burned the house or it
caught fire as a result of fighting was
not clear.
The guerrillas attacked working-class
districts of San Salvador earlier this
month in their biggest offensive of a 10-
year-old civil war that has killed more
than 71,000 people, most of them
civilians.
Yesterday, their clandestine Ven
ceremos radio said: "We're already sitting
in the oligarchy's best mansions."
A statement from the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, the rebel
umbrella group, said U.S. personnel and
buildings were not targets.
Americans in the area should "stay
sheltered in their residences," and "if
they come in contact with our forces,
they should identify themselves," it said.
"Our units have instructions not to at

tack North American personnel."
Fighting began well before dawn in the
western neighborhoods of San Benito and
Escalon, the capital's wealthiest residen
tial areas. Most people stayed inside the
comfortable homes, which are sur
rounded by trees and 15-foot walls, as
the chatter of assault rifles sounded in
the winding streets.
It appeared about a dozen homes were
taken over by the scores of insurgents,
who apparently came down from the San
Salvador volcano northwest of the city.
"By taking this part, we bring the war
to the rich," said the leader of a rebel
squad behind a barricade of cars with
their tires shot out, arranged to block a
tree-lined street. He said the guerrillas
were beginning the second phase of the
offensive launched Nov. 11.
In Washington, CIA Director William
Webster said the rebels were continuing
to "make a symbolic and important state
ment about their ability to keep causing
trouble" through urban attacks, but
posed no threat to the government.

'Our units have instruc
tions not to attack
North American per
sonnel.'

Salvadoran government forces, and the
family was not actually in the hands of
the guerrillas at any time," said David
Denny, a department spokesman.
Heavy and sustained fire was reported
blocks from the residence of U.S. Am
bassador William Walker. Embassy
spokesman Jeff Brown had said Walker
was "fine ... working in his office at the
embassy."
Denny said, "Several families are un
able to leave their homes because of fight
ing in their locations," which included
the neighborhoods of San Benito, Escalon
and San Francisco.
A statement from the leftist guerrillas

said their fighters had been told not to
attack Americans.
Guerrillas took over the Japanese Em
bassy, four blocks from Walker's house,
an El Salvador Foreign Ministry source
said privately.
He said only a few embassy personnel
were inside and the insurgents allowed
relief workers to evacuate them.
A diplomatic source, also speaking
anonymously, said the guerrillas seized
the residence of a French diplomat, but
allowed those inside to be evacuated. He
gave no details.
U.S. Embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs
said a charter flight might depart today
with embassy dependents who want to
leave El Salvador, and embassy personnel
who planned to go home for Christmas
would leave early.
He said some dependents and other
Americans had moved into the heavily
fortified embassy in downtown San Sal
vador to get away from the fighting a
few miles away.
A home about a half-mile from Walker's

house was burned after having been taken
over by rebels, and unconfirmed reports
said a U.S. Embassy employee lived in
it. The Washington officials said nothing
of a fire at the house seized by rebels.
Whether rebels burned the house or it
caught fire as a result of fighting was
not clear.
The guerrillas attacked working-class
districts of San Salvador earlier this
month in their biggest offensive of a 10-
year-old civil war that has killed more
than 71,000 people, most of them
civilians.
Yesterday, their clandestine Ven
ceremos radio said: "We're already sitting
in the oligarchy's best mansions."
A statement from the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, the rebel
umbrella group, said U.S. personnel and
buildings were not targets.
Americans in the area should "stay
sheltered in their residences," and "if
they come in contact with our forces,
they should identify themselves," it said.
"Our units have instructions not to at

tack North American personnel."
Fighting began well before dawn in the
western neighborhoods of San Benito and
Escalon, the capital's wealthiest residen
tial areas. Most people stayed inside the
comfortable homes, which are sur
rounded by trees and 15-foot walls, as
the chatter of assault rifles sounded in
the winding streets.
It appeared about a dozen homes were
taken over by the scores of insurgents,
who apparently came down from the San
Salvador volcano northwest of the city.
"By taking this part, we bring the war
to the rich," said the leader of a rebel
squad behind a barricade of cars with
their tires shot out, arranged to block a
tree-lined street. He said the guerrillas
were beginning the second phase of the
offensive launched Nov. 11.
In Washington, CIA Director William
Webster said the rebels were continuing
to "make a symbolic and important state
ment about their ability to keep causing
trouble" through urban attacks, but
posed no threat to the government.
