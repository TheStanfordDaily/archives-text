Abortion laws reviewed
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court was asked yesterday to rule that
most young girls have no right to abor
tions without first telling their parents.
The justices, who have allowed limits
on the availability of abortions for
minors in the past, questioned lawyers
defending and attacking parental
notification laws in Minnesota and Ohio.
In two hours of relatively narrow ar
guments, they gave no sign they are
considering the broader possibility of

scrapping the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion — an
idea much discussed outside the court
whenever they take up any abortion
case.
"The court showed no interest in over
turning a woman's constitutional right
to abortion," Cleveland lawyer Linda
Sogg said after the argument session in
which she attacked the Ohio law.
Death squads investigated
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — President F.W. de Klerk declared
yesterday that no one can kill with im
punity, and said he will reveal next week
what the government plans to do about
alleged murders by police death squads.
In a speech to the Johannesburg Press
Club, de Klerk said his Cabinet had
received an official report and was giving
it urgent attention. He said criminal ac
tion in government service would not be
tolerated.
