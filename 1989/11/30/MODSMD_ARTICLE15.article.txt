ROME (AP) — Soviet officials
rejected West German Chancellor Hel
mut Kohl's German reunificiation plan
yesterday, the first day of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's visit to Italy They said a
united Germany could upset European
stability.
As the Soviet president was. hailed in
the streets of Rome by throngs shouting,
"Bravo, Mikhail, bravo!," a Soviet
spokesman dismissed the 10-point plan
for phased reunification of the two Ger
manys outlined Tuesday by Kohl.
The rejection showed mounting Soviet
concern that the Kremlin's tolerance of
democratic reforms in the East bloc
could be used to disrupt Gorbachev's
vision of a "common European home"
erasing the lines between East and West.
While Gorbachev met privately for
more than IV2 hours with Premier
Giulio Andreotti, Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze expressed
Moscow's concerns to Foreign Minister
Gianni De Michelis and other Italian
officials, a spokesman said.
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news brief

ing, "Not one country in Europe is anx
ious to see a united Germany because
it could upset the present stability in
Europe."
Gerasimov said Shevardnadze told the
Italians the Soviet Union would not
reconsider its opposition to the Kohl
plan unless West Germany first
renounces any claim to the pre-World
War II borders of Germany, which in
cluded many areas now belonging to
F'oland, the Soviet Union and other bor
der states.
In Moscow, Gerasimov deputy Yuri
Gremitskikh rejected the Kohl plan in
even harsher language, calling it "an
attempt to shift the movement that
started in East Germany to nationalistic
lines."
On the first day of his three-day state
visit, Gorbachev waded into cheering
crowds who shouted "Gorby! Gorby!"
as he and his wife took a whirlwind
tour of Rome between official talks that
focused on the tumultuous changes
taking place in Eastern Europe.
Gorbachev met Andreotti in a tete-a

tete that stretched from the half-hour
scheduled to more than three times
that, leaving official delegations to carry
on without them.
In remarks prepared for a state din
ner in his honor at the presidential
palace, Gorbachev expressed gratitude
for Italy's willingness to help the Soviet
Union recover economically, but said
that in the end only the Soviets can
implement perestroika — restructuring
of the economy and politics.
"It is not rare that in the West we
are asked how we can be helped," he
said. "The biggest help consists in un
derstanding our processes and prob
lems. We are open to cooperation, we
are favorable to its new forms. But
perestroika has to be realized by our
selves.
"All the riches of the West cannot
substitute what we have to do ourselves
... We have enormous natural riches, a
powerful production system, an ines
timable intellectual potential. It is
through perestroika that we have to
put all of this to its best use."
