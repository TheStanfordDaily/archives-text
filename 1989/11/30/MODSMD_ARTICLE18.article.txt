Pride takes a back
seat as fairness
prevails in Jackson case

IT'S OVER.
With yesterday's sentencing,
the drawn-out, sometimes ugly
legal saga of Louis Jackson came
to a close.
The legal battle that began with
Jackson's arrest three weeks after
the May 15 takeover of Building
10 ended yesterday when Jackson
was sentenced on trespassing and
resisting arrest charges.
The punishment of six months
probation and 70 hours community
service is reasonably just. Other
protesters involved in the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office received
probation and 40 community serv
ice hours on the charge of trespass
ing.
The district attorney should be
commended for agreeing to drop
the battery and inciting to riot
charges against Jackson, especially
since — in doing so — he con
tradicted earlier statements which
indicated a strong resolve to pros
ecute Jackson on these two un
founded charges.
Following one of Jackson's early
court dates, Asst. District Attorney
Thomas Fahrenholz said that "an
illegal touching" had taken place
and he was therefore obligated to
pursuer the matter. —
Prior to last week, the district
attorney had argued that — de
spite the lack of complaint by the

alleged victim of the battery — the
charge should stick because the
battery took place under "riotous"
circumstances. In a written state
ment of opposition, the district at
torney's office argued that Jackson
"terrorized and bullied" the oc
cupants of Building 10.
Such rhetoric appeared contrived
and contrary to the facts of the
case. The tenacity with which the
district attorney was pursuing the
battery charge was disturbing.
Last week, however, he put an
end to what could have become a
pride-driven prosecution attempt.
For that, he should be credited
with a good-faith attempt to bring
the matter to a just conclusion
before trial.
By reaching a pretrial agree
ment, not only will taxpayers be
spared expenses — as the judge
noted last week — but Jackson
will be able to get on with his life
after what have undoubtedly been
stressful summer and fall quarters.
For the Stanford community, the
end of Jackson's case signifies the
next-to-last chapter of a divisive
period stemming from the May 15
takeover. Three protesters still
await another pretrial hearing Dec.
13.
The whole legal process has dis
tracted students committed to mul
ticulturalism from their education
and their work toward to make
Stanford more reflective of a cul
turally diverse society.
Once the legal proceedings come
to-a close, students, faculty and
staff can refocus their attention on
building a more pluralistic Stan
ford community.
