Senators misinterpret Program Board funding rules

AS A FORMER ASSU senator and
former chair of the Student
Affairs Committee, I would like
to respond to the letter in Tuesday's
Daily from Students First senators
Kevin Warsh, John Abbott and Jorge
Velazquez regarding their "confusion"
over the ASSU Program Board funding
rules of procedure.
The ASSU funding policies are clear,
consistent and well-known to senators;
I hope this letter helps make them
clearer for all.
The Program Board exists to fund
programming by student groups on
social, cultural, educational and politi
cal issues. One restriction that governs
the Program Board, because of Univer
sity rules, is that it may not fund
strictly partisan causes or functions,

such as the visit of a political candi
date who is running for office or politi
cal lobbying efforts.
However, organizations who choose
to do political programming or educa
tional efforts may receive funds for
these purposes.
"Partisan" and "political" are not
synonymous. The ASSU cannot fund
partisan activities but can and in fact
regularly does fund student organiza
tions who seek to promote political
debate and discussion by advocating
their own points of view.
At the ASSU Appropriations Com
mittee meeting prior to the Nov. 9
senate meeting where the controversy
occurred, some senators raised the
point that they did not understand the
distinction.
Therefore, the committee consulted

with more experienced ASSU officials
and me. We clarified the legislative
history of the issue to the committee
and further consulted with administra
tion officials to make sure that we
were indeed following University rules.
Some senators also explained this
clearly at the senate meeting.
Despite the extensive clarification, at
the senate meeting some senators
sought to deny funding to the Stanford
Central American Action Network
(SCAAN) and the Stanford Democratic
Socialists of America (DSA), going so
far as to threaten funding to other
student groups who had no role at all
in the controversy
It is one thing to be confused and it
is quite another to disingenuously deny
student group funding until senators
who have not done their homework can

overcome their "confusion."
Perhaps the most serious issue at
hand is that some senators sought to
deny student group funding based on
the political perspective of these organ
izations rather than on the merit of
these groups' proposals.
Not only did they seek to justify
these efforts with claims of "confusion"
over the handling procedures, but in
their letter, Warsh, Abbott and Velaz
quez attempt to blame even this confu
sion on the People's Platform.
Such attacks and attempts to deny
student groups the funding they
deserve are examples of the most petty
partisan politics at the expense of
student needs.
