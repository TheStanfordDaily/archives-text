# Reflections on a six-month legal saga
## 
### John Wagner Editorial staff 
The knock on his dorm room door
awakened him.
It was shortly after 3 p.m. and Louis
Jackson appeared somewhat groggy as he
opened the door and invited us in. The
hourlong interview that was to follow had
been bodied as a chance to look back at
his six-month adventure in the county legal
system.
His room was messy, but no more so
than an average dorm room. His walls were
adorned with images of Martin Luther King
Jr., Jesse Jackson posters and campaign
paraphernalia, and a photo collage of black
Americans who had graced the pages of
popular magazines. All these images were

backed with red, green and black construc
tion paper, which ran from ceiling to floor
in the room.
It was Monday afternoon. Jackson had
yet to be sentenced, but he and his attorney
were fairly certain of the outcome: He
wouldn't get any jail time but would have
to complete about 80 hours of community
service.
Throughout the interview, Jackson was
perfectly at ease discussing the details of
his case and what his life has been like for
the last Bix months.
But, as we paused halfway through the
interview to shoot some photos, Jackson
appeared uneasy with the process.
He graciously complied with our requests
to pose in various spots in his
room, even volunteering to make
his bed so we could capture him
sitting under his King poster.
But as the dialogue between
reporter and interview subject
was suspended, and it became in
escapably clear that he was the
sole focus of attention — that his
face would be splashed across the
front page of The Daily again —
Jackson seemed much less com
fortable.
"It's really weird having your
life unfold in The Daily, and
having it be an issue of debate,"
he said as the interview resumed.
Due to the media attention his
case has received, Jackson has be
come a very familiar figure
around campus and in his classes.
"It's funny," he said, "because
people I don't know know me. ...
People on campus will see me in
White Plaza and wish me luck
who I don't even know.
"In the Coffee House the other
day, I just asked a guy if I could
borrow his chair. I didn't even
know him, but I guess he'd seen
my picture in the paper, because
he was like, 'Oh, yeah, sure
Louis.' "
His new distinction has it draw
backs, however. Jackson said he
often feels he is being scrutinized
and has felt somewhat inhibited
in his social life.
Perhaps it's far-fetched, he said,
but he's been paranoid about
drinking at parties. "You never
know if anyone will report it,"he
said. Jackson just turned 21 last
week.
He said he's had visions of Stan
ford Review writers seeing him at
a party and then coming out with
a story. "Jackson: Drunken
Slime," he said, laughing. "You
never know."
Despite the embarrassment it
has caused him, Jackson is con
vinced that his case would not
have been resolved as favorably if
it weren't for all the publicity he's
received.
"I wish it could have been
[resolved] some other way, but it
couldn't have," he said.
Jackson is convinced that
people behind the scenes — pos
sibly within the Legal Office and
the Stanford Police Department
— have been pushing for his con
viction ever since he was arrested,
three weeks after the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office.
"(University General Counsel)
John Schwartz was on the scene
the entire day [of the takeover],
basically putting forth what Stan
ford was going to do in this case,"
he explained.
The police, he said, "just looked
stupid that day. They looked like
real idiots. They bring in this big

huge riot bus. They were stupid
enough to bring it all the way into
History Corner. There was one
opening. There were 500 people
out there, then they start putting
people on the bus. What did they
think was going to happen?"
Efforts to prosecute and convict
him have been an attempt of the
Legal Office and the police to
prove they really had the upper
hand the day of the takeover,
Jackson said. "I think they just
wanted to save face."
The political pressure mounted
by the Black Student Union and
other students, the support of
some faculty and staff members,
and the ensuing media coverage
were all necessary to block his
selective prosecution, Jackson
said.
"The way the judicial process
works — what I found out —
unless there's political pressure,
you're hung," he said.
"If I hadn't been connected, I
would have been in jail [on the
day of my arrestl for I don't know
how long, because they would
have kept me there until I got
some bail money. And then they
would have been able to get a

ident of a university, it

one of his students is
having all this done to
him. ,

conviction on everything because
the issue wouldn't have been out
there at all, nobody would have
known what was happening.
"Then they could have done
anything they wanted to. . . . They
could've really made the shit
stick."
The district attorney didn't
budge on dismissing charges,
Jackson said, until he had re
ceived the backing of the county's
Human Relations Commission.
On Oct. 24, Jackson and other
students appeared before the com
mission, which is an arm of the
Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors. The commission then
voted to take several actions on
Jackson's behalf.
"If all that hadn't been there,
if all the press and coverage
hadn't been there, then it would
have been straight procedure,
would have gone to trial, and I
would have been convicted of who
knows what."
Jackson's in-court experiences
have left him quite disillusioned

with the legal system.
"If the United States is sup
posed to be one of the more model
legal systems, this world is in
seriously sorry shape," he said.
"In my opinion, it's not about jus
tice or anything like that. You
need to mount enough political
pressure to save your ass.
"Void of any type of political
backing or organizing, anything
can happen, anything. They can
interpret the law any way they
want to, they can convict you of
anything anytime, the judge can
act as prosecuter, the district at
torney's office doesn't have to
come to court prepared, because
they know the judge will step in
on their behalf."
For people who don't have the
backing he has had and aren't as
well-connected as himself, the le
gal system is "disgusting," Jack
son said.
Jackson said he was particu
larly disturbed by the case of a
black man who appeared on the
same court calendar as he did a
few weeks ago. The man didn't
know why he was there, Jackson
said. "It seemed like he was being
totally railroaded and the judge
is like, 'Well according to the law
and penal code blah blah
blah.
The man didn't understand
what was going on and was even
tually told to go back to jail to
wait for an attorney to contact
him, Jackson said.
"There wasn't any press there
covering his shit," he said. "There
wasn't any media there, there
wasn't any big issue about that."
For quite some time, Jackson
said, he feared that his own case
would end in some jail time.
The maximum penalty for the
six misdemeanors he was charged
with is two years in the county
jail.
"The judge in the past had said
that usually in cases like this, he
prefers that people do jail time,"
Jackson said.
His fear was greatest following
his Oct. 12 court date, he said,
at which the district attorney
tried to block a motion to dismiss
the battery charge.
At the time, the receptionist in
the president's office who was the
alleged victim of the battery had
signed a civil compromise agree
ment, saying she had no complaint
against Jackson. The district at
torney, however, entered a state
ment of opposition, arguing that
the battery had taken place dur
ing "riotous" circumstances, dis
qualifying it from settlement by
civil compromise agreement.
"I was like, 'What the hell do
they want?' " Jackson recalled. "It
really scared me. I didn't know
what they were after. When I saw
them actively pursuing the most

ridiculous charge, it was kind of
a scary thing."
Jackson was not the only one
frightened by the proceedings that
day.
"When my family heard about
this, they were like, 'You're com
ing home. We want you to leave
there and come home.' "
Jackson grew up in Houston,
where his father is a computer
programmer and his mother is an
executive secretary at the Hous
ton Post.

'If the United States is
supposed to be one
of the more model le
gal systems, this
world is in seriously
sorry shape.'

"They had definite views about
what was happening," Jackson
said. That night his parents told
him that if he stayed at Stanford,
they would no longer pay his tui
tion.
"They were frustrated because
they couldn't do anything," he
said. "They were in Texas, they
didn't really know what was going
on . . . and they were just really

scared for my life."
But Jackson said he has never
considered leaving Stanford dur
ing his six-month legal battle. "It
sends a message to students on
campus if they can successfully
beat down and batter one leader.
If he'll buckle down under all that
pressure, then what does that say
about the rest of us?"
Once his mother got over the
initial scare, Jackson said, she
began organizing her family and
friends to write letters to Ken
nedy. "The pastor of my church
was writing letters and calling
Donald Kennedy," Jackson said,
laughing.
Despite statements by the BSU
harshly criticizing Kennedy's lack
of intervention in Jackson's case,
Jackson harbors few ill feelings
toward Kennedy.
"I honestly think he was
genuinely concerned," Jackson
said. "As a president of a univer
sity, it reflects on him when one
of his students is having all this
done to him.
"You know, Kennedy is really
a very liberal person. . . . Our
goals are the same. The way we
pursue them may diverge."
But, Kennedy could have had a
tremendous impact on the case,
Jackson said. "I think it would
have been a really wise move for
him to just say, 'This is ridiculous.

One of my students shouldn't have
to go through this. I want to see
this thing resolved.' Something
that simple would have had a
huge impact on speeding this
thing up."
But, due to the case dragging
on this quarter, Jackson's aca
demics have been hindered and
his life has been "hell stressful,"
he said. He's had to drop one of
his classes and is struggling to
get by in the others, he said.
"I have paid the price for justice
— academic difficulty, family anx
iety, emotional stress and finan
cial hardship," Jackson said yes
terday in court."I hope that this
price is enough to buy more black
faculty, more black courses and a
greater commitment to the issues
of multiculturalism."
He is even more committed to
the issues he has spent the last
few years fighting for, Jackson
said, and his experience with the
legal system will not deter him
from future activism.
"If there's some civil dis
obedience, I'm not going to be out
on the front line, obviously, be
cause I'm the first person they
would arrest, the first person that
would get prosecuted," Jackson
said. "But if there is just cause
to make any kind of statement or
action, then hell, yeah, I'm going
to be involved in it."

Junior Louis Jackson stands in front of a poster of Martin Luther King Jr. which adorns his dorm

backing he has had and aren't as
well-connected as himself, the le
gal system is "disgusting," Jack
son said.
Jackson said he was particu
larly disturbed by the case of a
black man who appeared on the
same court calendar as he did a
few weeks ago. The man didn't
know why he was there, Jackson
said. "It seemed like he was being
totally railroaded and the judge
is like, 'Well according to the law
and penal code blah blah
blah.
The man didn't understand
what was going on and was even
tually told to go back to jail to
wait for an attorney to contact
him, Jackson said.
"There wasn't any press there
covering his shit," he said. "There
wasn't any media there, there
wasn't any big issue about that."
For quite some time, Jackson
said, he feared that his own case
would end in some jail time.
The maximum penalty for the
six misdemeanors he was charged
with is two years in the county
jail.
"The judge in the past had said
that usually in cases like this, he
prefers that people do jail time,"
Jackson said.
His fear was greatest following
his Oct. 12 court date, he said,
at which the district attorney
tried to block a motion to dismiss
the battery charge.
At the time, the receptionist in
the president's office who was the
alleged victim of the battery had
signed a civil compromise agree
ment, saying she had no complaint
against Jackson. The district at
torney, however, entered a state
ment of opposition, arguing that
the battery had taken place dur
ing "riotous" circumstances, dis
qualifying it from settlement by
civil compromise agreement.
"I was like, 'What the hell do
they want?' " Jackson recalled. "It
really scared me. I didn't know
what they were after. When I saw
them actively pursuing the most

ridiculous charge, it was kind of
a scary thing."
Jackson was not the only one
frightened by the proceedings that
day.
"When my family heard about
this, they were like, 'You're com
ing home. We want you to leave
there and come home.' "
Jackson grew up in Houston,
where his father is a computer
programmer and his mother is an
executive secretary at the Hous
ton Post.

'If the United States is
supposed to be one
of the more model le
gal systems, this
world is in seriously
sorry shape.'

"They had definite views about
what was happening," Jackson
said. That night his parents told
him that if he stayed at Stanford,
they would no longer pay his tui
tion.
"They were frustrated because
they couldn't do anything," he
said. "They were in Texas, they
didn't really know what was going
on . . . and they were just really

scared for my life."
But Jackson said he has never
considered leaving Stanford dur
ing his six-month legal battle. "It
sends a message to students on
campus if they can successfully
beat down and batter one leader.
If he'll buckle down under all that
pressure, then what does that say
about the rest of us?"
Once his mother got over the
initial scare, Jackson said, she
began organizing her family and
friends to write letters to Ken
nedy. "The pastor of my church
was writing letters and calling
Donald Kennedy," Jackson said,
laughing.
Despite statements by the BSU
harshly criticizing Kennedy's lack
of intervention in Jackson's case,
Jackson harbors few ill feelings
toward Kennedy.
"I honestly think he was
genuinely concerned," Jackson
said. "As a president of a univer
sity, it reflects on him when one
of his students is having all this
done to him.
"You know, Kennedy is really
a very liberal person. . . . Our
goals are the same. The way we
pursue them may diverge."
But, Kennedy could have had a
tremendous impact on the case,
Jackson said. "I think it would
have been a really wise move for
him to just say, 'This is ridiculous.

One of my students shouldn't have
to go through this. I want to see
this thing resolved.' Something
that simple would have had a
huge impact on speeding this
thing up."
But, due to the case dragging
on this quarter, Jackson's aca
demics have been hindered and
his life has been "hell stressful,"
he said. He's had to drop one of
his classes and is struggling to
get by in the others, he said.
"I have paid the price for justice
— academic difficulty, family anx
iety, emotional stress and finan
cial hardship," Jackson said yes
terday in court."I hope that this
price is enough to buy more black
faculty, more black courses and a
greater commitment to the issues
of multiculturalism."
He is even more committed to
the issues he has spent the last
few years fighting for, Jackson
said, and his experience with the
legal system will not deter him
from future activism.
"If there's some civil dis
obedience, I'm not going to be out
on the front line, obviously, be
cause I'm the first person they
would arrest, the first person that
would get prosecuted," Jackson
said. "But if there is just cause
to make any kind of statement or
action, then hell, yeah, I'm going
to be involved in it."

Junior Louis Jackson stands in front of a poster of Martin Luther King Jr. which adorns his dorm
room. Jackson's six-month legal saga came to a close yesterday.
The knock on his dorm room door
awakened him.
It was shortly after 3 p.m. and Louis
Jackson appeared somewhat groggy as he
opened the door and invited us in. The
hourlong interview that was to follow had
been bodied as a chance to look back at
his six-month adventure in the county legal
system.
His room was messy, but no more so
than an average dorm room. His walls were
adorned with images of Martin Luther King
Jr., Jesse Jackson posters and campaign
paraphernalia, and a photo collage of black
Americans who had graced the pages of
popular magazines. All these images were

backed with red, green and black construc
tion paper, which ran from ceiling to floor
in the room.
It was Monday afternoon. Jackson had
yet to be sentenced, but he and his attorney
were fairly certain of the outcome: He
wouldn't get any jail time but would have
to complete about 80 hours of community
service.
Throughout the interview, Jackson was
perfectly at ease discussing the details of
his case and what his life has been like for
the last Bix months.
But, as we paused halfway through the
interview to shoot some photos, Jackson
appeared uneasy with the process.
He graciously complied with our requests
to pose in various spots in his
room, even volunteering to make
his bed so we could capture him
sitting under his King poster.
But as the dialogue between
reporter and interview subject
was suspended, and it became in
escapably clear that he was the
sole focus of attention — that his
face would be splashed across the
front page of The Daily again —
Jackson seemed much less com
fortable.
"It's really weird having your
life unfold in The Daily, and
having it be an issue of debate,"
he said as the interview resumed.
Due to the media attention his
case has received, Jackson has be
come a very familiar figure
around campus and in his classes.
"It's funny," he said, "because
people I don't know know me. ...
People on campus will see me in
White Plaza and wish me luck
who I don't even know.
"In the Coffee House the other
day, I just asked a guy if I could
borrow his chair. I didn't even
know him, but I guess he'd seen
my picture in the paper, because
he was like, 'Oh, yeah, sure
Louis.' "
His new distinction has it draw
backs, however. Jackson said he
often feels he is being scrutinized
and has felt somewhat inhibited
in his social life.
Perhaps it's far-fetched, he said,
but he's been paranoid about
drinking at parties. "You never
know if anyone will report it,"he
said. Jackson just turned 21 last
week.
He said he's had visions of Stan
ford Review writers seeing him at
a party and then coming out with
a story. "Jackson: Drunken
Slime," he said, laughing. "You
never know."
Despite the embarrassment it
has caused him, Jackson is con
vinced that his case would not
have been resolved as favorably if
it weren't for all the publicity he's
received.
"I wish it could have been
[resolved] some other way, but it
couldn't have," he said.
Jackson is convinced that
people behind the scenes — pos
sibly within the Legal Office and
the Stanford Police Department
— have been pushing for his con
viction ever since he was arrested,
three weeks after the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office.
"(University General Counsel)
John Schwartz was on the scene
the entire day [of the takeover],
basically putting forth what Stan
ford was going to do in this case,"
he explained.
The police, he said, "just looked
stupid that day. They looked like
real idiots. They bring in this big

huge riot bus. They were stupid
enough to bring it all the way into
History Corner. There was one
opening. There were 500 people
out there, then they start putting
people on the bus. What did they
think was going to happen?"
Efforts to prosecute and convict
him have been an attempt of the
Legal Office and the police to
prove they really had the upper
hand the day of the takeover,
Jackson said. "I think they just
wanted to save face."
The political pressure mounted
by the Black Student Union and
other students, the support of
some faculty and staff members,
and the ensuing media coverage
were all necessary to block his
selective prosecution, Jackson
said.
"The way the judicial process
works — what I found out —
unless there's political pressure,
you're hung," he said.
"If I hadn't been connected, I
would have been in jail [on the
day of my arrestl for I don't know
how long, because they would
have kept me there until I got
some bail money. And then they
would have been able to get a

nedy was genuinely
concerned. As a pres
ident of a university, it
reflects on him when
one of his students is
having all this done to
him. ,

conviction on everything because
the issue wouldn't have been out
there at all, nobody would have
known what was happening.
"Then they could have done
anything they wanted to. . . . They
could've really made the shit
stick."
The district attorney didn't
budge on dismissing charges,
Jackson said, until he had re
ceived the backing of the county's
Human Relations Commission.
On Oct. 24, Jackson and other
students appeared before the com
mission, which is an arm of the
Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors. The commission then
voted to take several actions on
Jackson's behalf.
"If all that hadn't been there,
if all the press and coverage
hadn't been there, then it would
have been straight procedure,
would have gone to trial, and I
would have been convicted of who
knows what."
Jackson's in-court experiences
have left him quite disillusioned

with the legal system.
"If the United States is sup
posed to be one of the more model
legal systems, this world is in
seriously sorry shape," he said.
"In my opinion, it's not about jus
tice or anything like that. You
need to mount enough political
pressure to save your ass.
"Void of any type of political
backing or organizing, anything
can happen, anything. They can
interpret the law any way they
want to, they can convict you of
anything anytime, the judge can
act as prosecuter, the district at
torney's office doesn't have to
come to court prepared, because
they know the judge will step in
on their behalf."
For people who don't have the
backing he has had and aren't as
well-connected as himself, the le
gal system is "disgusting," Jack
son said.
Jackson said he was particu
larly disturbed by the case of a
black man who appeared on the
same court calendar as he did a
few weeks ago. The man didn't
know why he was there, Jackson
said. "It seemed like he was being
totally railroaded and the judge
is like, 'Well according to the law
and penal code blah blah
blah.
The man didn't understand
what was going on and was even
tually told to go back to jail to
wait for an attorney to contact
him, Jackson said.

He graciously complied with our requests
to pose in various spots in his
room, even volunteering to make
his bed so we could capture him
sitting under his King poster.
But as the dialogue between
reporter and interview subject
was suspended, and it became in
escapably clear that he was the
sole focus of attention — that his
face would be splashed across the
front page of The Daily again —
Jackson seemed much less com
fortable.
"It's really weird having your
life unfold in The Daily, and
having it be an issue of debate,"
he said as the interview resumed.
Due to the media attention his
case has received, Jackson has be
come a very familiar figure
around campus and in his classes.
"It's funny," he said, "because
people I don't know know me. ...
People on campus will see me in
White Plaza and wish me luck
who I don't even know.
"In the Coffee House the other
day, I just asked a guy if I could
borrow his chair. I didn't even
know him, but I guess he'd seen
my picture in the paper, because
he was like, 'Oh, yeah, sure
Louis.' "
His new distinction has it draw
backs, however. Jackson said he
often feels he is being scrutinized
and has felt somewhat inhibited
in his social life.
Perhaps it's far-fetched, he said,
but he's been paranoid about
drinking at parties. "You never
know if anyone will report it,"he
said. Jackson just turned 21 last
week.
He said he's had visions of Stan
ford Review writers seeing him at
a party and then coming out with
a story. "Jackson: Drunken
Slime," he said, laughing. "You
never know."
Despite the embarrassment it
has caused him, Jackson is con
vinced that his case would not
have been resolved as favorably if
it weren't for all the publicity he's
received.
"I wish it could have been
[resolved] some other way, but it
couldn't have," he said.
Jackson is convinced that
people behind the scenes — pos
sibly within the Legal Office and
the Stanford Police Department
— have been pushing for his con
viction ever since he was arrested,
three weeks after the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office.
"(University General Counsel)
John Schwartz was on the scene
the entire day [of the takeover],
basically putting forth what Stan
ford was going to do in this case,"
he explained.
The police, he said, "just looked
stupid that day. They looked like
real idiots. They bring in this big

huge riot bus. They were stupid
enough to bring it all the way into
History Corner. There was one
opening. There were 500 people
out there, then they start putting
people on the bus. What did they
think was going to happen?"
Efforts to prosecute and convict
him have been an attempt of the
Legal Office and the police to
prove they really had the upper
hand the day of the takeover,
Jackson said. "I think they just
wanted to save face."
The political pressure mounted
by the Black Student Union and
other students, the support of
some faculty and staff members,
and the ensuing media coverage
were all necessary to block his
selective prosecution, Jackson
said.
"The way the judicial process
works — what I found out —
unless there's political pressure,
you're hung," he said.
"If I hadn't been connected, I
would have been in jail [on the
day of my arrestl for I don't know
how long, because they would
have kept me there until I got
some bail money. And then they
would have been able to get a

conviction on everything because
the issue wouldn't have been out
there at all, nobody would have
known what was happening.
"Then they could have done
anything they wanted to. . . . They
could've really made the shit
stick."
The district attorney didn't
budge on dismissing charges,
Jackson said, until he had re
ceived the backing of the county's
Human Relations Commission.
On Oct. 24, Jackson and other
students appeared before the com
mission, which is an arm of the
Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors. The commission then
voted to take several actions on
Jackson's behalf.
"If all that hadn't been there,
if all the press and coverage
hadn't been there, then it would
have been straight procedure,
would have gone to trial, and I
would have been convicted of who
knows what."
Jackson's in-court experiences
have left him quite disillusioned

with the legal system.
"If the United States is sup
posed to be one of the more model
legal systems, this world is in
seriously sorry shape," he said.
"In my opinion, it's not about jus
tice or anything like that. You
need to mount enough political
pressure to save your ass.
"Void of any type of political
backing or organizing, anything
can happen, anything. They can
interpret the law any way they
want to, they can convict you of
anything anytime, the judge can
act as prosecuter, the district at
torney's office doesn't have to
come to court prepared, because
they know the judge will step in
on their behalf."
For people who don't have the
backing he has had and aren't as
well-connected as himself, the le
gal system is "disgusting," Jack
son said.
Jackson said he was particu
larly disturbed by the case of a
black man who appeared on the
same court calendar as he did a
few weeks ago. The man didn't
know why he was there, Jackson
said. "It seemed like he was being
totally railroaded and the judge
is like, 'Well according to the law
and penal code blah blah
blah.
The man didn't understand
what was going on and was even
tually told to go back to jail to
wait for an attorney to contact
him, Jackson said.
"There wasn't any press there
covering his shit," he said. "There
wasn't any media there, there
wasn't any big issue about that."
For quite some time, Jackson
said, he feared that his own case
would end in some jail time.
The maximum penalty for the
six misdemeanors he was charged
with is two years in the county
jail.
"The judge in the past had said
that usually in cases like this, he
prefers that people do jail time,"
Jackson said.
His fear was greatest following
his Oct. 12 court date, he said,
at which the district attorney
tried to block a motion to dismiss
the battery charge.
At the time, the receptionist in
the president's office who was the
alleged victim of the battery had
signed a civil compromise agree
ment, saying she had no complaint
against Jackson. The district at
torney, however, entered a state
ment of opposition, arguing that
the battery had taken place dur
ing "riotous" circumstances, dis
qualifying it from settlement by
civil compromise agreement.
"I was like, 'What the hell do
they want?' " Jackson recalled. "It
really scared me. I didn't know
what they were after. When I saw
them actively pursuing the most

ridiculous charge, it was kind of
a scary thing."
Jackson was not the only one
frightened by the proceedings that
day.
"When my family heard about
this, they were like, 'You're com
ing home. We want you to leave
there and come home.' "
Jackson grew up in Houston,
where his father is a computer
programmer and his mother is an
executive secretary at the Hous
ton Post.

'If the United States is
supposed to be one
of the more model le
gal systems, this
world is in seriously
sorry shape.'

"They had definite views about
what was happening," Jackson
said. That night his parents told
him that if he stayed at Stanford,
they would no longer pay his tui
tion.
"They were frustrated because
they couldn't do anything," he
said. "They were in Texas, they
didn't really know what was going
on . . . and they were just really

scared for my life."
But Jackson said he has never
considered leaving Stanford dur
ing his six-month legal battle. "It
sends a message to students on
campus if they can successfully
beat down and batter one leader.
If he'll buckle down under all that
pressure, then what does that say
about the rest of us?"
Once his mother got over the
initial scare, Jackson said, she
began organizing her family and
friends to write letters to Ken
nedy. "The pastor of my church
was writing letters and calling
Donald Kennedy," Jackson said,
laughing.
Despite statements by the BSU
harshly criticizing Kennedy's lack
of intervention in Jackson's case,
Jackson harbors few ill feelings
toward Kennedy.
"I honestly think he was
genuinely concerned," Jackson
said. "As a president of a univer
sity, it reflects on him when one
of his students is having all this
done to him.
"You know, Kennedy is really
a very liberal person. . . . Our
goals are the same. The way we
pursue them may diverge."
But, Kennedy could have had a
tremendous impact on the case,
Jackson said. "I think it would
have been a really wise move for
him to just say, 'This is ridiculous.

One of my students shouldn't have
to go through this. I want to see
this thing resolved.' Something
that simple would have had a
huge impact on speeding this
thing up."
But, due to the case dragging
on this quarter, Jackson's aca
demics have been hindered and
his life has been "hell stressful,"
he said. He's had to drop one of
his classes and is struggling to
get by in the others, he said.
"I have paid the price for justice
— academic difficulty, family anx
iety, emotional stress and finan
cial hardship," Jackson said yes
terday in court."I hope that this
price is enough to buy more black
faculty, more black courses and a
greater commitment to the issues
of multiculturalism."
He is even more committed to
the issues he has spent the last
few years fighting for, Jackson
said, and his experience with the
legal system will not deter him
from future activism.
"If there's some civil dis
obedience, I'm not going to be out
on the front line, obviously, be
cause I'm the first person they
would arrest, the first person that
would get prosecuted," Jackson
said. "But if there is just cause
to make any kind of statement or
action, then hell, yeah, I'm going
to be involved in it."


Chris Eisenberg — Dally
Junior Louis Jackson stands in front of a poster of Martin Luther King Jr. which adorns his dorm
room. Jackson's six-month legal saga came to a close yesterday.
The knock on his dorm room door
awakened him.
It was shortly after 3 p.m. and Louis
Jackson appeared somewhat groggy as he
opened the door and invited us in. The
hourlong interview that was to follow had
been bodied as a chance to look back at
his six-month adventure in the county legal
system.
His room was messy, but no more so
than an average dorm room. His walls were
adorned with images of Martin Luther King
Jr., Jesse Jackson posters and campaign
paraphernalia, and a photo collage of black
Americans who had graced the pages of
popular magazines. All these images were

backed with red, green and black construc
tion paper, which ran from ceiling to floor
in the room.
It was Monday afternoon. Jackson had
yet to be sentenced, but he and his attorney
were fairly certain of the outcome: He
wouldn't get any jail time but would have
to complete about 80 hours of community
service.
Throughout the interview, Jackson was
perfectly at ease discussing the details of
his case and what his life has been like for
the last Bix months.
But, as we paused halfway through the
interview to shoot some photos, Jackson
appeared uneasy with the process.
He graciously complied with our requests
to pose in various spots in his
room, even volunteering to make
his bed so we could capture him
sitting under his King poster.
But as the dialogue between
reporter and interview subject
was suspended, and it became in
escapably clear that he was the
sole focus of attention — that his
face would be splashed across the
front page of The Daily again —
Jackson seemed much less com
fortable.
"It's really weird having your
life unfold in The Daily, and
having it be an issue of debate,"
he said as the interview resumed.
Due to the media attention his
case has received, Jackson has be
come a very familiar figure
around campus and in his classes.
"It's funny," he said, "because

borrow his chair. I didn't even

he was like, 'Oh, yeah, sure

His new distinction has it draw
backs, however. Jackson said he
often feels he is being scrutinized
and has felt somewhat inhibited

but he's been paranoid about
drinking at parties. "You never

Jackson said.
His fear was greatest following
his Oct. 12 court date, he said,
at which the district attorney
tried to block a motion to dismiss
the battery charge.
At the time, the receptionist in
the president's office who was the
alleged victim of the battery had
signed a civil compromise agree
ment, saying she had no complaint
against Jackson. The district at
torney, however, entered a state
ment of opposition, arguing that
the battery had taken place dur
ing "riotous" circumstances, dis
qualifying it from settlement by
civil compromise agreement.
"I was like, 'What the hell do
they want?' " Jackson recalled. "It
really scared me. I didn't know
what they were after. When I saw
them actively pursuing the most

ridiculous charge, it was kind of
a scary thing."
Jackson was not the only one
frightened by the proceedings that
day.
"When my family heard about
this, they were like, 'You're com
ing home. We want you to leave
there and come home.' "
Jackson grew up in Houston,
where his father is a computer
programmer and his mother is an
executive secretary at the Hous
ton Post.

'If the United States is
supposed to be one
of the more model le
gal systems, this
world is in seriously
sorry shape.'

"They had definite views about
what was happening," Jackson
said. That night his parents told
him that if he stayed at Stanford,
they would no longer pay his tui
tion.
"They were frustrated because
they couldn't do anything," he
said. "They were in Texas, they
didn't really know what was going
on . . . and they were just really

scared for my life."
But Jackson said he has never
considered leaving Stanford dur
ing his six-month legal battle. "It
sends a message to students on
campus if they can successfully
beat down and batter one leader.
If he'll buckle down under all that
pressure, then what does that say
about the rest of us?"
Once his mother got over the
initial scare, Jackson said, she
began organizing her family and
friends to write letters to Ken
nedy. "The pastor of my church
was writing letters and calling
Donald Kennedy," Jackson said,
laughing.
Despite statements by the BSU
harshly criticizing Kennedy's lack
of intervention in Jackson's case,
Jackson harbors few ill feelings
toward Kennedy.
"I honestly think he was
genuinely concerned," Jackson
said. "As a president of a univer
sity, it reflects on him when one
of his students is having all this
done to him.
"You know, Kennedy is really
a very liberal person. . . . Our
goals are the same. The way we
pursue them may diverge."
But, Kennedy could have had a
tremendous impact on the case,
Jackson said. "I think it would
have been a really wise move for
him to just say, 'This is ridiculous.

One of my students shouldn't have
to go through this. I want to see
this thing resolved.' Something
that simple would have had a
huge impact on speeding this
thing up."
But, due to the case dragging
on this quarter, Jackson's aca
demics have been hindered and
his life has been "hell stressful,"
he said. He's had to drop one of
his classes and is struggling to
get by in the others, he said.
"I have paid the price for justice
— academic difficulty, family anx
iety, emotional stress and finan
cial hardship," Jackson said yes
terday in court."I hope that this
price is enough to buy more black
faculty, more black courses and a
greater commitment to the issues
of multiculturalism."
He is even more committed to
the issues he has spent the last
few years fighting for, Jackson
said, and his experience with the
legal system will not deter him
from future activism.
"If there's some civil dis
obedience, I'm not going to be out
on the front line, obviously, be
cause I'm the first person they
would arrest, the first person that
would get prosecuted," Jackson
said. "But if there is just cause
to make any kind of statement or
action, then hell, yeah, I'm going
to be involved in it."
