# Educational gap between rich and poor schools narrowing
## 
### 
I found Malinda McCollum's Nov. 22
column entitled "The East Palo Alto
wall" to be astute and timely. To liken
the Berlin Wall to a less visible but
equally divisive "educational wall" be
tween rich and poor communities is
not really as unbelievable as some may
think.
McCollum is probably right in as
suming that any attempts to remove
this wall between the Palo Alto
Unified and the Ravenswood City
school districts would meet great resis
tance.
However, there is some evidence
coming from other parts of the country
that, one by one, barriers are starting
to topple.

Until very recently, a fully state
operated fiscal delivery system for
public schools existed only in Hawaii.
Because Hawaii's system distributes
educational resources equitably, one
does not find egregious disparities be
tween schools.
The other states, with the possible
exception of Alaska, have local delivery
systems based on property tax which
automatically favor affluent communi
ties. These systems allow the rich to
have low tax rates that produce high
per-pupil expenditures whereas the
poor must endure high tax rates that
result in low per-pupil expenditures.
Therefore, it should come as no
surprise that an educational gap be
tween advantaged and disadvantaged
schools exist in the United States.
There are some individuals, like
economist Eric Hanushek of the Uni
versity of Rochester in New York, who
will claim that research has consis
tently shown no relationship between
school expenditures and student per-

formance.
This type of argument against fiscal
reform is unconvincing because, as a
New Jersey administrative law judge
observed recently, the studies that
Hanushek cites are "relatively primi
tive" in both substance and methodolo
gy-
Following a 1988 New Jersey deci
sion in the Abbott v. Burke case, the
state supreme courts in Kentucky and
Texas ruled that public school expendi
ture systems based on property tax are
unconstitutional.
Through her own experience as a
student and tutor in East Palo Alto,
McCollum has seen that the impor
tance of education to the individual
empowers those who seek to change
and who seek to be changed.
When efficiently and thoroughly ap
plied, it is undoubtedly the most ap
propriate and lasting means by which
disadvantaged groups can lift them
selves out of poverty and deprivation.
I believe that individuals like McCol

lum have reason to feel heartened. It
does not appear that a long-awaited
"revolution" in American education is
about to happen. Perhaps it has just
begun.
