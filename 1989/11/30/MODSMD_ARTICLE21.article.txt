A brief word to columnist Cheryl
Taylor about her Monday column:
"Mayor Ed Koch and his racially
divisive politics?" Get real.
I don't think Commissioner Ben
jamin Ward, Koch's appointee to the
highest position in the New York City
Police Department, would agree with
your statements comparing Koch and
fellow Democrat David Dinkins. Ward,
who is black, resigned from his post
shortly after Dinkins won the mayoral
election.
