## On the outside looking in 
### 
I KNOW THAT Big Game was well
over a week ago, but there was some
thing that I saw there that I just
can't shake from my mind.
It wasn't the police in their riot gear,
it wasn't that lunatic attacking the Tree
and it wasn't the two alumni sitting be
hind the student section who tried to kill
each other after halftime.
No, it was the guy in front of me with
the "peace" earring who was hurling
oranges and apples at the UC-Berkeley
Band as they marched by our side of the
stadium.
So what's the big deal? Lots of people
on our side were throwing things at their
band. My younger brother, a freshman
at UC-Berkeley, confirmed that it was
much the same on the other side. UC-
Berkeley students were throwing just as
much stuff, if not more.
But again what's so interesting about
something that seems so commonplace
at football games? Well, aside from the
irony of this peacenik heaving projectiles
at other people, there's the general
cowsft-dliness of it all:
He was guilty of doing what most of
us do every once in awhile. Like him,
we give in to the security and power of
the crowd every so often, sometimes even
at football games.
Think about it. How many of us would
scream the obscenities that we say in the
stands, if we were face to face with
Berkeley's center?
In the crowd, there's a sense of
righteousness because everyone else
around you is doing it or doesn't question
what you're doing. At the game, I only
heard one person object to the throwing

while it was happening.
It was disheartening. Not so much be
cause these people were being rude and
destructive, but because it was so easy.
No one took the time to think, examine
agendas or ask hard questions twice.
Like throwing fruit at a football game,
giving criticism here at Stanford is easy.
It really doesn't take too much effort to
look at someone else's work and say that
it's foolish or worthless.
Anyone can find errors in any publi
cation, whether it be The Stanford
Review or The Daily or just a flier sitting
on the dining table.
It's easy to make a target of anyone
who's out there doing something that's
visible. They're the ones who will write
the letters, circulate the petitions, do the
work that's necessary to get the job done.
Naturally, they're criticized more; more
people know what they do.
Here at Stanford we seem to make a
habit of standing on the outside looking
in, using the detached, third-person voice
to pass judgment on everything.
We look at school politics and scoff at
how insignificant they are. We look at
straight-A students and say how socially
unbalanced they are.
Closely intertwined with our observa
tions while standing outside is the sense
that we are better since we are above
the fray, out of the battle between people
who can't see the big picture like we do.
Somehow, we're taught that we're
more intelligent, more educated, more ob
jective if we can rise above it all and
criticize everything.
So, what's the problem? Isn't it good

to be objective, questioning and distrust
ing? In theory, yes. But in reality few of
the critics do anything positive with their
ideas. They put in their two cents, get a
quick charge out of hearing themselves
talk and then withdraw, claiming that
they're above what's going on.
They're the people who are hard to pin
down. They're the ones who you never
see or hear about. Like the student who
is safe because he throws fruit from the
middle of the crowd, they keep to the
well-beaten path, doing the "safe" thing,
avoiding any conflict that may rock the
boat. Â®
Some of our most successful politicians
use this strategy to survive election~Bfler
election. They're the ones who only take
on the clear-cut, black and white issues.
They put on their teflon suits to avoid
anything out of the ordinary that could
jeopardize their re-election.
What's to be done? First of all, we
could just recognize that it's going on.
We could also start by actually doing
something about it when we have criti
cisms ... or is that too risky?
