'Statistical genocide' committed against Native American staff

IN ITS STUDY of minority life at
Stanford released in March, the
Univeristy Committee on Minority
Issues cautioned: "We have witnessed
the reopening of old wounds in a new
generation — sometimes by means of
deliberate racism, more often out of
ignorance and insensitivity."
We condemn the UCMI Staff Sub
committee for demonstrating the time
lessness of those words. The subcom
mittee, empowered by the University
to seek "an interactive, multiracial
community" has made a mockery of its
own misssion by deliberately excluding
the Native American staff from its
final report.
By denying Native American staff
their rightful inclusion in the staff
report, the subcommittee has con
tradicted the charge of UCMI to
"promote a University environment in
which all members have equal opportu
nity to develop full human potential —
an environment in which respect,
mutual regard for cultural differences

and full participation and partnership
are the norm."
The staff subcommittee cited two
reasons for our exclusion: statistical
insignificance and confidentiality con
cerns. Neither reason can justify the
silencing of an entire group of people,
particularly by a group professing to
evaluate the quality of life for all racial
minorities at Stanford.
Native American staff members
completed and returned the surveys,
participated in community meetings
with the staff subcommittee and looked
forward to positive change believing
that their concerns would be included
in the staff report.
The small size of the Native Ameri
can staff community was known both
to the Staff Subcommittee and to the
researchers before the survey was
begun. Any potential problems relating
to surveying a small community there
fore could have been solved in advance.
In the months between the distribu
tion of the staff survey and the presen

tation of the subcommittee's final
report, methods should have been
developed to analyze and include the
Native American staff data. Similar
difficulties were overcome in the pre
sentation of Native American student
data included in the UCMI report in
March.
Native American staff responded to
the survey at rates higher than any
other racial or ethnic group — re
sponse rates of 83 percent for Native
American exempt staff and 81 percent
for Native American non-exempt staff.
Because such a high response rate is
as likely to be as representative of a
small population as a similar response
rate would be in a larger population,
the excluded American Indian statistics
would have been, at the very least,
significant indicators of the quality of
American Indian staff life at Stanford.
American Indian staff members came
forward to be heard in numbers that
should not have been deemed insignifi
cant. Indian staff came forward in the

largest numbers possible to voice their
concerns, not to be categorized in a
column labeled "others," and certainly
not to be excluded.
If the researchers and the staff
subcommittee worried that confiden
tiality could not have been maintained
with an 80 percent response rate,
would they have been confident if the
response rate of Native American staff
had been 100 percent? Or would we
have been excluded even then?
Keenly aware of the disadvantages of
being a silent small population, Ameri
can Indian staff members believed it
was more important to be heard than
it was to worry about possible prob
lems of confidentiality.
Stanford's Native Amerian staff,
having always been referred to as
statistically insignificant with numbers
too low to count or made to be
grouped together with "other" small
populations, has formed the American
Indian Staff Forum to create a

stronger voice for Indian staff within
the University.
What has been perpetrated against
us is nothing short of statistical
genocide. The Native American staff
members deserve more than an apol
ogy. Nothing less than a full public
censure of the staff subcommittee and
the reissuing of the report will begin
to heal the old wounds which have
been reopened by our exclusion from
this report.
Being included as a footnote or an
addendum will not correct the wrong,
but would reinforce the idea that
Native American staff are merely an
afterthought in Stanford's version of a
pluralistic community.

American exempt staff and 81 percent
for Native American non-exempt staff.
Because such a high response rate is
as likely to be as representative of a
small population as a similar response
rate would be in a larger population,
the excluded American Indian statistics
would have been, at the very least,
significant indicators of the quality of
American Indian staff life at Stanford.
American Indian staff members came
forward to be heard in numbers that
should not have been deemed insignifi
cant. Indian staff came forward in the

largest numbers possible to voice their
concerns, not to be categorized in a
column labeled "others," and certainly
not to be excluded.
If the researchers and the staff
subcommittee worried that confiden
tiality could not have been maintained
with an 80 percent response rate,
would they have been confident if the
response rate of Native American staff
had been 100 percent? Or would we
have been excluded even then?
Keenly aware of the disadvantages of
being a silent small population, Ameri
can Indian staff members believed it
was more important to be heard than
it was to worry about possible prob
lems of confidentiality.
Stanford's Native Amerian staff,
having always been referred to as
statistically insignificant with numbers
too low to count or made to be
grouped together with "other" small
populations, has formed the American
Indian Staff Forum to create a

stronger voice for Indian staff within
the University.
What has been perpetrated against
us is nothing short of statistical
genocide. The Native American staff
members deserve more than an apol
ogy. Nothing less than a full public
censure of the staff subcommittee and
the reissuing of the report will begin
to heal the old wounds which have
been reopened by our exclusion from
this report.
Being included as a footnote or an
addendum will not correct the wrong,
but would reinforce the idea that
Native American staff are merely an
afterthought in Stanford's version of a
pluralistic community.
