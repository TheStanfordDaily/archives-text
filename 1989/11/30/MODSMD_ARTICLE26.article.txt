## Hoopsters to rock Maples in quest for 1st national title 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
How about this for a good bar
room argument:
Somebody says to the
bartender: "Jennifer Azzi is the
best women'B basketball player in
the country."
From the far end of the bar,
another patron shouts: "She ain't
even the best player on her own
team."
"Oh yeah. Who is then?"
"Sorya Henning, that's who."
"Why, I oughtta .. .
"Hold on folks," the bartender
says, separating the combatants.
"Let's just say that Stanford has
the best backcourt in the coun
try."
Everybody nods in agreement
and a woman standing near the
door says: "Their frontcourt isn't
too shabby, either."
Not too shabby, indeed. As a
matter of fact, Stanford has a
near-perfect starting five and a
second unit that, all by itself,
might crack the top 20.
Azzi is the nation's lone return
ing All-American and leads the
way. Last year, the 5-foot-9 senior

guard scored 16.6 points per game
on 54 percent shooting from the
field. Azzi shot a sizzling 50 per
cent from behind the three-point
arc and 79 percent at the free
throw line.
For good measure, she chipped
in 203 assists, 129 rebounds and
69 steals. Already her name is
indelibly etched all over the Stan
ford record books.
Henning starts alongside Azzi
and runs the offense flawlessy. An
All-America candidate, Henning
knows the system so well it has
been said repeatedly that if Coach
Tara VanDerveer was unavail
able, Henning could run practice
and the team wouldn't skip a beat.
The frontcourt returns starters
Katy Steding and Trisha Stevens
along with key reserve Julie
Zeilstra. Stevens and Steding
would be worthy of the title Ms.
Inside and Ms. Outside. Steding's
sweet jumper is good out to three
point range, and Stevens is a dom
inant low post player.
Zeilstra is penciled in as the
starting center. It is her ability to
score from anywhere and rebound
that sets her apart. Still, Zeilstra
may wind up back in a reserve

role if freshman Val Whiting
comes along quickly.
Whiting, a 6-3 Delaware native,
brings to Stanford the intense
physical dimension that may have
been the only thing lacking in last
year's squad. She will crash the
boards with a toughness and
agressiveness that could well be
contagious.
If that occurs, the Cardinal's
one weakness from 1988-89 — a
tendency to get outrebounded —
may go by the wayside, making
the squad's national champion
ship dreams that much more re
alistic.
Stanford's deep bench also in
cludes Stacy Parson, Martha Ric
hards, Chris MacMurdo and Molly
Goodenbour. Parson, a senior, is
an experienced reserve guard who
always goes full tilt. Goodenbour,
the team's fourth guard, comes
in as a highly-touted freshman
and is not likely to disappoint.
She is another excellent outside
shooter and has the potential to
be a defensive standout.
MacMurdo is coming off a red
shirt year in which a back injury
kept her out of action. A superb
athlete, MacMurdo should make
her presence felt.
Richards is a star ready to
shine. With the ability to play
both guard positions as well as
the small forward spot, look for
Richards to see significant action.
There is nothing she can't do,
especially on offense. Like the
Detroit Piston's Vinnie Johnson,
a.k.a. "The Microwave," Richards
can heat up in a hurry.
Injury is the only lurking horror
for the Cardinal, particularly at
the center position. If Zeilstra,
who is coming off an Achilles prob
lem, or Whiting goes down there
is no backup. The reason is the
team's third center, Tammy
Svoboda, decided to transfer last
month.
Obviously, an injury to Azzi or
Henning would be devastating as
well, though the effect would be
more emotional than anything
else. The frightening reality is
there are few teams in the nation
that could defeat Stanford even
with one of the team's best guards
out of action.
Capturing a national title is an
other matter entirely. Steding,
Stevens, Azzi and Henning have
started 58 of Stanford's last 61
games together. All four will need
to be there if the team is to meet
VanDerveer's goal.
The Converse National Coach
of the Year put it this way, "Every
pitcher starts a game saying 'I
want to pitch a no hitter.' That's
what we're doing. We are saying
we would like to win it all."
For Stanford to do that, they'll
have to first reach the Final Four.
Last season, the Cardinal came
up one game short of reaching the
NCAA semifinals, losing to
Lousiana Tech in the regional

final on the Lady Techsters' home
floor.
This season Stanford is hosting
the West Regional and has its
sights set on doing so as the No.
1 seed. Stan ford Romped through
the Pacific 10 Conference with a
perfect 18-0 mark en route to a
29-3 season and a similar per
formance would place the team
atop the heap in the West.
Better still, the team would love
to go into the NCAAs unbeaten.
The biggest obstacle on the path
to that goal comes Dec. 15 in the
Cardinal's fourth regular-season
game when the Lady Vols of Ten
nessee visit Maples.
Stanford was blown out exactly
once last year and the deed was
performed in Knoxville. Tennes
see handed Stanford a 23-point
defeat in an 83-60 shellacking last
December.
While the Cardinal would love
to return the favor, it is aware of
the consequences of that action:
The Final Four will be played on
the Tennessee campus and the
home team will almost certainly
be represented.
As if the Lady Vols won't be
motivated enough in front of their
screaming fans, an opportunity to
avenge what might have been the
team's only loss of the season,
combined with Tennessee's talent,
might be too much for the Car
dinal to overcome.
The intangible working in Stan
ford's favor is that Azzi is a Ten
nessee native and was not even

recruited to play for the Lady
Vols. She would like nothing more
than to capture the national
crown for her home team.
But that's getting ahead of
things a bit. Stanford is currently

2-0 and preparing for its home
opener Sunday against San Diego
State. Five days later is the Ten
nessee game.
The Cardinal will host a mini
tournament over Christmas break
and kick off conference play Jan.
5 at Oregon State.
From there, it is nothing but
conference games with the excep
tion of an ESPN-televised contest
versus highly-rated Long Beach
State. That showdown will take
place here Jan. 23.
The fast-breaking Stanford
women, who score 100 points al
most as often as the Oklahoma
tnen's team, are currently third in
the Associated Press poll behind
Tennessee and Louisiana Tech.
They are in that spot because they
have not yet established an ability
to beat either of those teams.
Sports Illustrated, who tabbed
the Cardinal as its preseason No.
1, is foremost among those who
believe that Stanford will make a
breakthrough against the Lady
Techsters and Lady Vols.
If the Stanford women are to
grab the brass ring this April, they
will have to.

Junior Sonja Henning, who runs the Cardinal floor attack with the
potency of the best five-star general, balances out the best back
court combination in the nation.
How about this for a good bar
room argument:
Somebody says to the
bartender: "Jennifer Azzi is the
best women'B basketball player in
the country."
From the far end of the bar,
another patron shouts: "She ain't
even the best player on her own
team."
"Oh yeah. Who is then?"
"Sorya Henning, that's who."
"Why, I oughtta .. .
"Hold on folks," the bartender
says, separating the combatants.
"Let's just say that Stanford has
the best backcourt in the coun
try."
Everybody nods in agreement
and a woman standing near the
door says: "Their frontcourt isn't
too shabby, either."
Not too shabby, indeed. As a
matter of fact, Stanford has a
near-perfect starting five and a
second unit that, all by itself,
might crack the top 20.
Azzi is the nation's lone return
ing All-American and leads the
way. Last year, the 5-foot-9 senior

guard scored 16.6 points per game
on 54 percent shooting from the
field. Azzi shot a sizzling 50 per
cent from behind the three-point
arc and 79 percent at the free
throw line.
For good measure, she chipped
in 203 assists, 129 rebounds and
69 steals. Already her name is
indelibly etched all over the Stan
ford record books.
Henning starts alongside Azzi
and runs the offense flawlessy. An
All-America candidate, Henning
knows the system so well it has
been said repeatedly that if Coach
Tara VanDerveer was unavail
able, Henning could run practice
and the team wouldn't skip a beat.
The frontcourt returns starters
Katy Steding and Trisha Stevens
along with key reserve Julie
Zeilstra. Stevens and Steding
would be worthy of the title Ms.

sweet jumper is good out to three
point range, and Stevens is a dom
inant low post player.
Zeilstra is penciled in as the
starting center. It is her ability to
score from anywhere and rebound
that sets her apart. Still, Zeilstra
may wind up back in a reserve

role if freshman Val Whiting
comes along quickly.
Whiting, a 6-3 Delaware native,
brings to Stanford the intense
physical dimension that may have
been the only thing lacking in last
year's squad. She will crash the
boards with a toughness and
agressiveness that could well be
contagious.
If that occurs, the Cardinal's
one weakness from 1988-89 — a
tendency to get outrebounded —
may go by the wayside, making
the squad's national champion

Stanford's deep bench also in

always goes full tilt. Goodenbour,
the team's fourth guard, comes
in as a highly-touted freshman
and is not likely to disappoint.
She is another excellent outside
shooter and has the potential to
be a defensive standout.
MacMurdo is coming off a red
shirt year in which a back injury
kept her out of action. A superb
athlete, MacMurdo should make
her presence felt.
Richards is a star ready to
shine. With the ability to play
both guard positions as well as
the small forward spot, look for
Richards to see significant action.
There is nothing she can't do,
especially on offense. Like the
Detroit Piston's Vinnie Johnson,
a.k.a. "The Microwave," Richards
can heat up in a hurry.
Injury is the only lurking horror
for the Cardinal, particularly at
the center position. If Zeilstra,
who is coming off an Achilles prob
lem, or Whiting goes down there
is no backup. The reason is the
team's third center, Tammy
Svoboda, decided to transfer last
month.
Obviously, an injury to Azzi or
Henning would be devastating as
well, though the effect would be
more emotional than anything
else. The frightening reality is
there are few teams in the nation
that could defeat Stanford even
with one of the team's best guards
out of action.
Capturing a national title is an
other matter entirely. Steding,
Stevens, Azzi and Henning have
started 58 of Stanford's last 61
games together. All four will need
to be there if the team is to meet
VanDerveer's goal.
The Converse National Coach
of the Year put it this way, "Every
pitcher starts a game saying 'I
want to pitch a no hitter.' That's
what we're doing. We are saying
we would like to win it all."
For Stanford to do that, they'll
have to first reach the Final Four.
Last season, the Cardinal came
up one game short of reaching the
NCAA semifinals, losing to
Lousiana Tech in the regional

final on the Lady Techsters' home

This season Stanford is hosting
the West Regional and has its
sights set on doing so as the No.

the Pacific 10 Conference with a
perfect 18-0 mark en route to a
29-3 season and a similar per
formance would place the team
atop the heap in the West.
Better still, the team would love
to go into the NCAAs unbeaten.
The biggest obstacle on the path
to that goal comes Dec. 15 in the
Cardinal's fourth regular-season
game when the Lady Vols of Ten
nessee visit Maples.
Stanford was blown out exactly
once last year and the deed was
performed in Knoxville. Tennes
see handed Stanford a 23-point
defeat in an 83-60 shellacking last
December.
While the Cardinal would love
to return the favor, it is aware of
the consequences of that action:
The Final Four will be played on
the Tennessee campus and the
home team will almost certainly
be represented.
As if the Lady Vols won't be
motivated enough in front of their
screaming fans, an opportunity to
avenge what might have been the
team's only loss of the season,
combined with Tennessee's talent,
might be too much for the Car

The Converse National Coach
of the Year put it this way, "Every
pitcher starts a game saying 'I
want to pitch a no hitter.' That's
what we're doing. We are saying
we would like to win it all."
For Stanford to do that, they'll
have to first reach the Final Four.
Last season, the Cardinal came
up one game short of reaching the
NCAA semifinals, losing to
Lousiana Tech in the regional

final on the Lady Techsters' home
floor.
This season Stanford is hosting
the West Regional and has its
sights set on doing so as the No.
1 seed. Stan ford Romped through
the Pacific 10 Conference with a
perfect 18-0 mark en route to a
29-3 season and a similar per
formance would place the team
atop the heap in the West.
Better still, the team would love
to go into the NCAAs unbeaten.
The biggest obstacle on the path
to that goal comes Dec. 15 in the
Cardinal's fourth regular-season
game when the Lady Vols of Ten
nessee visit Maples.
Stanford was blown out exactly
once last year and the deed was
performed in Knoxville. Tennes
see handed Stanford a 23-point
defeat in an 83-60 shellacking last
December.
While the Cardinal would love
to return the favor, it is aware of
the consequences of that action:
The Final Four will be played on
the Tennessee campus and the
home team will almost certainly
be represented.
As if the Lady Vols won't be
motivated enough in front of their
screaming fans, an opportunity to
avenge what might have been the
team's only loss of the season,
combined with Tennessee's talent,
might be too much for the Car
dinal to overcome.
The intangible working in Stan
ford's favor is that Azzi is a Ten
nessee native and was not even

recruited to play for the Lady
Vols. She would like nothing more
than to capture the national
crown for her home team.
But that's getting ahead of
things a bit. Stanford is currently

2-0 and preparing for its home
opener Sunday against San Diego
State. Five days later is the Ten
nessee game.
The Cardinal will host a mini
tournament over Christmas break
and kick off conference play Jan.
5 at Oregon State.
From there, it is nothing but
conference games with the excep
tion of an ESPN-televised contest
versus highly-rated Long Beach
State. That showdown will take
place here Jan. 23.
The fast-breaking Stanford
women, who score 100 points al
most as often as the Oklahoma
tnen's team, are currently third in
the Associated Press poll behind
Tennessee and Louisiana Tech.
They are in that spot because they
have not yet established an ability
to beat either of those teams.
Sports Illustrated, who tabbed
the Cardinal as its preseason No.
1, is foremost among those who
believe that Stanford will make a
breakthrough against the Lady
Techsters and Lady Vols.
If the Stanford women are to
grab the brass ring this April, they
will have to.

Senior All-America Jennifer Azzi, who has been compared to every
thing from Magic Johnson to a chocolate chip, will lead Stanford
in its quest for a national title.
