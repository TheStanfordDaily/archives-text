# Spikers open postseason against USC
## Cardinal team says it will not overlook inconsistent, talented Women of Troy 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
The regular season is over. The sec
ond season begins today.
After struggling to a 17-11 record in
1989 and a third-place finish in the
Pacific 10 Conference, the Stanford
women's volleyball team hosts the
Women of Troy from USC tonight in
the first round of the NCAA West Re
gional tournament.
USC, whose 10-8 record was good
enough for a tie for fourth in the Pac-10
and the region's sixth seed, has as many
looming questions as does the Cardinal.
"(USC) has been up and down this
year more so than us," Stanford Asst.
Coach Denise Corlett said. "Their best
match of the year, from what I've seen
of them, was against us the first time
(we played this season). They haven't
been able to keep that up throughout
the year."
In that match on Oct. 6, the Women
of Troy dominated Stanford, winning
in three games 15-11, 15-6, 16-14. Al
though Stanford was ranked sixth at
the time and USC was 12th, four players
hit over .300 for the Women of Troy to
offset a .424 performance from Stanford
freshman middle blocker Bev Oden and
a .500 showing by senior outside hitter
.Jessica Benton.
At that time, USC was 11-4 overall
and 4-1 in the conference. Since then
USC has gone 6-7 in the Pac-10 and
struggled to a tie for fourth place with
a surprising Oregon team that was 21-8,
the second-best overall mark in the con
ference.
One of those seven losses since USC's
victory over Stanford was the rematch
at Burnham Pavilion on Nov. 2. The
Cardinal returned the favor by sweeping
the Women of Troy 15-4, 15-12, 15-10
in what may have been Stanford's best
match of the year Oden hit .659 and
sophomore outside hitter Kristin Klein
pounded out a .359 hitting percentage
as the Cardinal tallied a .424 team hit
ting mark.

'If you know you've already beaten a team, some
times it's a disadvantage. We've just got to build up
our own confidence and not worry about the other
team as much, just worry about us.'

Although they dominated each other
on their respective home floors, Stan
ford realizes that hosting tonight's
match doesn't necessarily give the Car
dinal an advantage.
"We know that USC has a lot that
we need to worry about," Oden said.
"If they play the way they did before,
we're going to have to play really well
to beat them."
"Last time we took them out of their
game and won in three," freshman out
side hitter Laurie Sawin said. "The first
time we played them we didn't. So it's
just a matter of whether we can play
it smart because we know what to do.
It's just a matter of doing it."
Sawin points out, however, that Stan
ford must avoid thinking that it can
handle USC at Burnham like it did the
last time the teams played here.
"If you know you've already beaten
a team, sometimes it's a disadvantage.
You could be overconfident, but I don't
think we will be. We've just got to build
up our own confidence and not worry
about the other team as much, just
worry about us," she said.
For Stanford, the key to the match
is to control USC's diverse attack by
keeping the Women of Troy out of their
offensive rhythm. The Cardinal serving
game will therefore be vital in Stanford's
efforts to keep USC off balance.
"They run a lot of plays. But they
can't run anything unless they have a
pass," Sawin said. "If we can serve
tough enough that they can't get that
pass, they won't be able to run (their
offense)."
"We're gonna have to serve strong
and pass well," Coach Don Shaw said.
"And we have to avoid mistakes on our
side of the net."

If Stanford wins tonight, the Cardinal
may face a rematch of last year's re
gional semifinal with Washington. In
the 1988 tournament, the Huskies upset
a 28-2 Cardinal squad that was ranked
second in the nation. Washington also
beat Stanford in Burnham in its last
conference match this year to tie Stan
ford for second place in the Pac-10.
That late-season victory also gave
Washington the region's second seed and
forced the Cardinal to accept the third
seed. Washington therefore has a better
first-round draw and will host the West
ern Athletic Conference Champions, the
Wyoming Cowboys.
But Stanford isn't worried about the
future. The team realizes tonight's
match could be the start of a strong
second season and a step toward that
elusive national title. A loss, conversely,
would signal the end of a difficult 1989,
something the team desperately would
like to prolong.
"It's the beginning of a new season,"
Shaw said. "If we win, we can keep
playing."

Freshman Carrie Feldman and senior Laura Olesen will try to set and spike the
Women of Troy out of Maples Pavilion tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the first round of the
NCAA West Regional.
The regular season is over. The sec
ond season begins today.
After struggling to a 17-11 record in
1989 and a third-place finish in the
Pacific 10 Conference, the Stanford
women's volleyball team hosts the
Women of Troy from USC tonight in
the first round of the NCAA West Re
gional tournament.
USC, whose 10-8 record was good
enough for a tie for fourth in the Pac-10
and the region's sixth seed, has as many
looming questions as does the Cardinal.
"(USC) has been up and down this
year more so than us," Stanford Asst.
Coach Denise Corlett said. "Their best
match of the year, from what I've seen
of them, was against us the first time
(we played this season). They haven't
been able to keep that up throughout
the year."
In that match on Oct. 6, the Women
of Troy dominated Stanford, winning
in three games 15-11, 15-6, 16-14. Al
though Stanford was ranked sixth at
the time and USC was 12th, four players
hit over .300 for the Women of Troy to
offset a .424 performance from Stanford
freshman middle blocker Bev Oden and
a .500 showing by senior outside hitter
.Jessica Benton.
At that time, USC was 11-4 overall
and 4-1 in the conference. Since then
USC has gone 6-7 in the Pac-10 and
struggled to a tie for fourth place with
a surprising Oregon team that was 21-8,
the second-best overall mark in the con
ference.
One of those seven losses since USC's
victory over Stanford was the rematch
at Burnham Pavilion on Nov. 2. The
Cardinal returned the favor by sweeping
the Women of Troy 15-4, 15-12, 15-10
in what may have been Stanford's best
match of the year Oden hit .659 and
sophomore outside hitter Kristin Klein
pounded out a .359 hitting percentage
as the Cardinal tallied a .424 team hit
ting mark.

'If you know you've already beaten a team, some
times it's a disadvantage. We've just got to build up
our own confidence and not worry about the other
team as much, just worry about us.'

Although they dominated each other
on their respective home floors, Stan
ford realizes that hosting tonight's
match doesn't necessarily give the Car
dinal an advantage.
"We know that USC has a lot that
we need to worry about," Oden said.
"If they play the way they did before,
we're going to have to play really well
to beat them."
"Last time we took them out of their
game and won in three," freshman out
side hitter Laurie Sawin said. "The first
time we played them we didn't. So it's
just a matter of whether we can play
it smart because we know what to do.
It's just a matter of doing it."
Sawin points out, however, that Stan
ford must avoid thinking that it can
handle USC at Burnham like it did the
last time the teams played here.
"If you know you've already beaten
a team, sometimes it's a disadvantage.
You could be overconfident, but I don't
think we will be. We've just got to build
up our own confidence and not worry
about the other team as much, just
worry about us," she said.
For Stanford, the key to the match
is to control USC's diverse attack by
keeping the Women of Troy out of their
offensive rhythm. The Cardinal serving
game will therefore be vital in Stanford's
efforts to keep USC off balance.
"They run a lot of plays. But they
can't run anything unless they have a
pass," Sawin said. "If we can serve
tough enough that they can't get that
pass, they won't be able to run (their
offense)."
"We're gonna have to serve strong
and pass well," Coach Don Shaw said.
"And we have to avoid mistakes on our
side of the net."

If Stanford wins tonight, the Cardinal
may face a rematch of last year's re
gional semifinal with Washington. In
the 1988 tournament, the Huskies upset
a 28-2 Cardinal squad that was ranked
second in the nation. Washington also
beat Stanford in Burnham in its last
conference match this year to tie Stan
ford for second place in the Pac-10.
That late-season victory also gave
Washington the region's second seed and
forced the Cardinal to accept the third
seed. Washington therefore has a better
first-round draw and will host the West
ern Athletic Conference Champions, the
Wyoming Cowboys.
But Stanford isn't worried about the
future. The team realizes tonight's
match could be the start of a strong
second season and a step toward that
elusive national title. A loss, conversely,
would signal the end of a difficult 1989,
something the team desperately would
like to prolong.
