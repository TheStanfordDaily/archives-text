### Mark Davies Staff writer 
Top rugby teams the world
over will invade Stanford as the
Cardinal rugby team hosts the
21st annual Stanford Ten-A-Side
Tournament from 8:30 a.m. to
4:30 p.m. at the IM fields Sat
urday.
"The Stanford Tens is one of
the nation's largest tourna
ments," said Rich Cortez, coor
dinator of the event. "We should
have thousands of spectators
watching and over 70 teams
competing.
Teams attending this year's
tournament come from many
different states and from as far
away as Australia. They will be
competing in seven different divi
sions: A, B, C, D, Master's, Wom
en's, and High School.
Rugby is normally played with
15 players on a team. At the
Tens Tournament, however,
teams are comprised of only 10
players. Since the matches are
still played on regulation fields,
this reduction in the number of
players leads to a fast-paced,
wide-open style of play.
Stanford Rugby Coach Franck

Boivert looks forward to the
Tens Tournament as "a good way
to finish off the preseason and
see how far we have advanced
in terms of our level of play and
fitness."
This year Stanford will be en
tering five different teams so
that all players will get to com
pete in at least three matches.
In addition, former Stanford
safety Rob Englehardt will make
his Stanford rugby debut Satur
day. "I'm eager to see how Rob
performs — to see how he trans
fers his football skills to rugby,"
Boivert said.
Cortez added that both Coach
Dennis Green and Asst. Coach
Dave Tipton have encouraged
their football players to come out
for rugby to assist in their winter
conditioning.
John McPherson, president of
the rugby club, encouraged all
Stanford students to attend this
weekend's event. "Stanford is
now at the forefront of college
rugby," he said. "I urge anyone
who enjoys exciting intercol
legiate action to come cheer us
on and join in the fun."
The Stanford ruggers have a
preseason record of 4-1.
