# Res Ed creates position to handle multicultural education
## 
### Lena Slachmuijlder 
"Twenty-five dollars to anyone who can
give me an accurate definition of cul
ture," rang out the voice of Maria Colvin
yesterday afternoon. Colvin is one of four
candidates vying for a newly-created po
sition in Residential Education.
Expounding her views on cultural
pluralism, Colvin addressed a University
selection committee that is seeking to
find a "Multicultural Education Special
ist" for Res Ed.
The specialist, who will begin work next
quarter, will "develop and implement a
plan for a comprehensive residential pro

gram of education about race, class and
culture," according to the job description.
The specialist will earn $40,000 to
$50,000 annually.
Why this new position? Assoc. Dean of
Residential Affairs Alice Supton said thr
job comes in response to recommenda
tions from the report of the University
Committee on Minority Issues, released
last spring.
"We want a more coherent approach to
education in this important area," said
Supton. "Multicultural education is
something for everyone — not only for
whites."
Supton, one of nine members on the

selection committee, explained the goal
of the position is to present multicultural
education in a "coordinated" manner, yet
through "appealing, non-threatening"
ways such as dorm-based drama, dance
and music programs,
She expects the new staff member to
work closely with resident assistants, res
ident fellows, ethnic center deans and
student groups such as the ASSU Com
mittee on Democracy in Education. Fu
ture programs will "complement
academic programs and (will ensure that)
students graduate with a certain kind of
understanding that they don't have now,"
Supton said.

The selection committee includes Keith
Archuleta of the Black Community Serv
ices Coiter, Michael Jackson of Student
Affairs, Jim Larimore of the Native
American Cultural Center and Rick Yuen
of the Asian American Activities Center.
No students sit on the selection commit
tee.
"We recognize the importance of stu
dent input, and we intended to include
RAs on the committee; but the search
got delayed, and we decided to go ahead,"
Supton said.
Each of the four candidates is required
to spend a full day in meetings, including

one with "interested students." Students
who attend the meeting with the candi
dates are requested to fill out an evalu
ation form that goes to the selection
committee. Less than five students have
attended any one of these meetings,
which have been advertised in The Daily
this week.
The candidates' application materials
are accessible to students at the Res Ed
office. Their past professions range from
psychology professors and college deans
to an "intercultural trainer." Colvin, who
gave her presentation yesterday after
noon, expressed regret at only meeting
three Stanford students all day.
