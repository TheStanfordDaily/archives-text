# German unification doubted
## Experts address problems resulting from opening of Berlin Wall 
### Kristin Farr 
When the Berlin Wall opened
on Nov. 9, champagne flowed. But
Stanford experts were not quite
as optimistic last night in their
analysis of the historic event.
In a packed Bishop Auditorum,
four University foreign policy ex
perts addressed the political and
economic effects on Germany and
Europe now that the wall has
crumbled.
Predicting a "winter of crisis,"
History Prof. Norman Naimark
did not have a bright forecast for
the unification of the two German
states.
According to Naimark, a spe
cialist in Eastern European his
tory, the opening of the wall and
the German Democratc Republic
will result in political and eco
nomic problems. The two eco
nomic systems are diametrically
opposed, and the two countries
have unequal exchange rates, he
said.

The mix of socialism and
capitalism will result in "chaos,"
Naimark predicted.
Visiting German Prof. Hans-
Dieter Jacobsen also foresaw
problems for the two countries.
Like Naimark, Jacobsen cited
the two countries' different ex
change rates as hurdles to their
unification. He said he doubted
that dismantling the Berlin Wall
would lead to a union because
"neither population is prepared."
Jacobsen cited nationalism as
another obstacle to the two coun
tries' unification. According to
Jacobsen, the West German
government is considering provid
ing East Germany with loans to
stabilize East Germany's eco
nomy, thereby encouraging East
Germans to stay in their own
country.
Education and Political Science
Prof. Hans Weiler concentrated
his analysis on historical events
which led to the opening of the
Wall.

According to Weiler, the peace
movements of the late '60a and
early '70a in Eaat Germany
"planted the first seed of diaaant"
aa citizens began to challenge their
government and dedicate their
energies to meeting eapouaed
goals of open communication be
tween the two states.
Weiler said the key isaue that
will determine the relationahip
between East and West Germany
lies in a "tension between unity
and identity."
While West Germany haa a
strong identity resulting from its
ecomomic prosperity and identifi
cation with the western world, it
lacks a sense of unification with
its citizens, he said.
East Germany, on the other
hand, is going through an "iden
tity crisis." The country's tradi
tion stems from communism,
which it is now breaking from, he
noted.
