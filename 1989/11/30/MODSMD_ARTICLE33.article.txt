THE STANFOIfItoAILY'S ENXEEXAINIJ^^fcEEKLY

Like a lot of things at Stanford, it started out with
a buiich of engineers monkeying around.
That monkey business has evolved over the last

50 years into KZSU Radio, Stanford's station
of-all-trades that broadcasts 24 hours a day
from the bowels of Memorial Auditorium.
"We tried 25 hours a day, but it didn't
work," admitted program director Kim Gupta.
Even though they didn't get the extra hour,
KZSU hasn't given up on its long-term goal
to blossom into a formidable information and
alternative entertainment source.
The station began its quest for excellence
in the '50s by opening its coverage to include
general campus events. It wasn't until 20 years
later, however, that KZSU carved its niche as
a radio force to be reckoned with.
Covering political upheaval on campus
proved to be the springboard that catapulted
KZSU into the campus ear during the early
'70s when their news department probed the
trial of H. Bruce Franklin, a Stanford professor
accused of inciting riot.
Their award-winning coverage also included
the whirlwind of charged rallies, marches and
police activities that whipped the campus.
KZSU's 1978 conversion from 10 to 500
watt transmission established it as a perma
nent broadcasting presence in the Bay Area.
"We made a deal with God to get the 500
watts" from the FCC, praised promotions di
rector Dan Rosenberg.

The power boost allowed KZSU to broadcast from
Livermore to Gilroy, reaching "pretty much the same
area as commercial stations," he added.
The Bay Area radio audience is the fifth largest in
the nation, according to news director Claire Greene.
Greene, a freelancer at San Francisco's KQED, is in
the middle of a one-year stint at KZSU.
She strives to help the station take advantage of
the active radio audience, "to sound as professional
as [the station] can.
To that end, KZSU broadcasts Stanford and local
news nightly at 7 p.m., as well as daily updates at
10 a.m., 2 and 5 p.m. Tuesdays at 7:30, KZSU offers
a weekly talk show covering both Stanford and global
issues.
In addition to news, the station covers sports
weeknights at 7:30, live band performances Wednes
day nights at 9 and radio drama Sundays from 9:30
p.m. to midnight.
But music — especially the kind that rarely travels
mainstream airwaves — is the station's forte. Rosen
berg explained, "KZSU plays a lot of formats from
jazz to folk to world pop music — but most of all
we play alternative music."
Music director Lea Kent accounted for KZSU's
alternative music focus, "It's the best way we can
attract listeners. They're not going listen to a 500
watt transmitter station" unless the disc jockeys spin
a hard-to-come-by mix.
DI Steve Tzraskoma agreed that the focus allows
the station to play "just about anything that isn't
played on mainstream radio/' from "harder hip-hop"
to reggae, world beat and rarely heard guitar music.
Contrary to popular misconception, alternative
music isn't always new. Classic rock director Pete
Bailey said, "We'll go back in time and play music
that is rarely heard on the radio, stuff from the early
'80s and late '70s that has almost become obsolete."
KZSU DJs have a lot of autonomy when it comes
to programming their shows. Unlike commercial sta
tions where playlists are computer-generated, or de
termined by people other than the jockeys, Bailey
explained that KZSU DJs have the freedom to "play
things that people might not have heard before, open
listeners to their tastes."
Sometimes, however, listeners prefer to expose the
DJs to new and interesting things. Trzaskoma
recalled, "There was this guy that used to call up
and request Pink Floyd. We don't play Pink Floyd
He worked at 7-Eleven and sat around crushing V-8
cans. I don't know what he did with them. ..."

For anyone interested in joining Trzaskoma at KZSU,
the station has an organizational meeting the first
Wednesday of each quarter, 7:30 p.m. in History
Corner, Room 2. leave your V-8 cans at home.
