# Death-defying disc jockey keeps radio drama alive
## 
### Kurt Kuersteiner 
Many people believe video killed the radio
star — but this is a mere myth.
The real kilohertz killer continues to cause
death and destruction on radio every Sunday
night. His name is Dr. Morgan. This mad
doctor of radio brings to life — if life is the
right word — radio drama from both the
past and future.
Morgan hosts Mystery Playhouse, a one
hour series featuring the best of mystery,
horror and science fiction. To most listeners,
Morgan is a devilish character that plays
his morbid assortment of programs from a
dungeon-like cavern — not much unlike the
real KZSU studios.
But unlike his mysterious character, Dr.
Morgan is really a regular guv, who just
happens to enjoy scaring people. His real
name is Rick Kaybrich, and his association
with Stanford is rather unique.
"I've been going to Stanford medical center
since I was a kid to receive treatment for
eye cancer," he says, "Stanford saved my
sight for most my childhood "
Although he has been blind since he was
20, this hasn't been an obstacle in his radio
drama career. Kaybrich explains, "I got in

volved with the campus radio station when
I called to thank them for playing radio
dramas. It just so happened that the disc
jockey at the time was also the production
manager. ... He liked my voice and asked
if I would be interested."
Kaybrich has been broadcasting ever since.
Because they project the same sinister
image, Kaybrich is often compared to radio
legend Boris Karloff.
"Most people aren't too surprised when
they meet me," Kaybrich explains. "They
usually say I look just like I sound. I think
that's a compliment, although I try to sound
dead. He laughs ghoulishly, as is his Mystery
Playhouse custom."
Too many jokes about death from some
one who has come so close to it can be
disturbing. Not to Kaybrich. "When some
body says 'see you later,' I'll joke about it
instead of letting them feel like they may
have hurt my feelings."
And, consistent with his customary dark
repartees that keep fans listening to his
show every week, Kaybrich adds, "As far as
death is concerned, I never have to worry
about offending anyone else. The only folk
with more experience in that field are lying
down in them."
