# Turn to phone sex and personal ads after big holiday break-up scene
## 
### 
With finals week approaching quickly
many of you freshmen will be experiencing
college exams for the first time. At the
same time, many of you freshmen will
also be preparing to return home for
Christmas break, during which time you
will break up with your high school
boyfriend or girlfriend. It's the law.
1 don't care how miserable and lonely
you have been here at Stanford. Rest as
sured that your high school sweetie has
been getting laid regularly by (pick one):
• 14 Chippendales dancers, simultane
ously
• Playboy's Miss November
• His/her resident assistant
• All of the above
So while you prepare for finals you
should also be preparing to find a new
relationship.
Different people employ different meth
ods of finding love. Jews, for instance, use
matchmakers, a technique that was best
demonstrated in the fine documentary on
contemporary icwish life, "Fiddler on the
Roof." You remember that showstopping
song:
Matchmaker, matchmaker make me a
match
Find me a find, catch me a catch

Not that I'm looking for something to
catch
At least nothing that can't he cured
with penicillin.
Another, more gentile wav of finding
eternal love is to call one of those long
distance "sex lines" where kinky men or
women talk dirty to you over the phone.
Unfortunately, the phone company uses
the same cheap switchboard for all long
distance service calls — Sex Hotline,
Sports Hotline, USA Today Weather Hot
line, Sears Customer Service Hotline.
Sometimes the switchboard mixes the
coversations:
YOU: (after dialing 1-976-HOT-SF.XX)
Uh, hi, my name's Eugene. I'm single and
I was, uh, wondering if Candy was there?
SEX HOTLINE: Hi Eugene, this is
Candy and I've got something that's hot
and wet.
SEARS HOTLINE: You say it's hot and
wet? You'd better unplug it immediately
or you could get a serious electrical shock!
WEATHER HOTLINE: A serious shock
indeed. The forecast calls for the weather
to be cool and dry through Friday, not
hot and wet.
YOU: Wait, where's Candy?
SPORTS HOTLINE: The San Francisco
Giants are asking just that question.

Where's Candy? Candy Maldonado has
been on the shelf for two months now
with a bad leg
SEARS HOTLINE: If it's got a bad leg
you should have brought it in for repair
two months ago, especially if it's over
heating and moist like you say.
YOU: No, no, no. This is Eugene.
WEATHER HOTLINE: The forecast for
Eugene, Oregon, calls for a chance of
showers.
SEX HOI LINE: Forget it, Eugene,
there's no chance we can take a shower.
This is phone sex, remember?
But if you're really, truly serious about
finding a new partner, the only way to go
is to read the personal ads in your local
newspaper. It is important to realize,
though, that the people who place these
ads arc desperate to the point that, in
their quest for a date, they will occasionally
miss the personals altogether and find love
in the classifieds. I have a friend who has
been seeing a 1979 Mazda (in good con
dition) for three years.
Reading and understanding these per
sonal ads, then, is more of an art than a
science, as the people who placc the ads
will occasionally exaggerate to make them
selves seem less, well, maggot-like. Let's
analyze a typical personal ad line by line:

SWM, mid-20s, seeks SWF to share
moonlit walks on the beach and candle
light dinners in front of a roaring fire. I
believe in honesty and commitment, and
am looking for a permanent relationship
based on love and shared interests. Please
reply with photo to Reply Pox No. 8327.
"SWM" — Somewhat Weird Male.
"MID-20s" — 41 years old
"SEEKS SWF" — Seeks anything he can
get
"TO SHARE MOONLIT WALKS ON
THE BEACH" - This is a blatant lie
used to impress women Men, as a rule,
do not want to walk along the beach It's

cold, it's wet and seagulls will poop on
your head. Walking in the moonlight is
even worse, because the chances of step
ping on a jellyfish and having to go to
the emergency room are very high.
"CANDLELIGHT DINNERS IN
FRONT OF A ROARING FIRE" - Notice
that this guy wants to do everything by
moonlight or candlelight What is he trying
to hide* His face? That boil on his neck
the size of a chinchilla- The lellyfish he
has next to the roaring fire?
"I BELIEVE IN HONESTY AND COM
MITMENT" — He also believes that he
is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. That's
why they had him committed
"AM LOOKING FOR A PERMANENT
RELATIONSHIP" — Permanent, in the
"until morning" sense.
"BASED ON LOVE AND SHARED IN
TERESTS" — And shared bodily fluids
"PLEASE REPLY WITH PHOTO" -
He has to train the jellyfish to attack you
on sight.

Andrew Berkowitz, SWM, 21, seeks gain
ful employment after graduation. He en
joys moonlit walks while on fire and
roaring at jellyfish over dinner. Please
reply with photo to P.O. Box 3487, Stan
ford, CA, 94309. No freaks
