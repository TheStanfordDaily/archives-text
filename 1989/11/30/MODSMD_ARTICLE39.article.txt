# Little Copenhagen would suit a viking

If months of greenish University
Food Service entrees have pushed
you to think twice before biting
into any hamburger, Scandinavian
cuisine might be just the thing to
revive your interest in the con
sumption of earn.
When you park beneath the sign
saying "Little Copenhagen," on El
Camino in Redwood City, you
may wonder where the restaurant
went. Look for a gingerbread house
in the middle of the lot. Like the
compact cars parked next to it,
Little Copenhagen is bigger on the
inside than on the outside.
As you step through the restau
rant's heavy door, you are struck
not only by the unexpected airiness
of the place, but also by its cheerful
lighting and decor.
Little Copenhagen is one of
those rare restaurants where you
can actually see what you're eating.
Though this fact is bound to please
Food Service victims who remain
sceptics even in this land of Odin,
bright lighting has the greater ad
vantage of showing off food beauti
fully arranged on the plate.
The meat at Little Copenhagen
is far from green, but that color
does play an important role in the
complete Norse dining experience.
The walls of the restaurant are
cool pastel green, saved from tacki
ness by cream and beige furniture
and dark-stained wood trim.

Various Scandinavian objects grace
the walls, including a bona fide
Asterix helmet.
The appetizer of marinated
celery hearts and prawns is not to
be missed. The dish's sour flavor
resembles that of marinated artic
hoke hearts except for a surprising
mellow, almost woody note. The
house salad, lettuce with creamy
dressing, is less exotic but equally
delicious.
And then there's the meat. The
menu contains mostly beef, lamb
and veal dishes, but fish and
chicken are also available for
people who truly avoid red meat
by choice.
And skipping red meat is no
sacrifice at Little Copenhagen if
the grilled salmon with dill is at
all representative of the fish
entrees. Meat lovers will want to
try the frikadeller (veal dumplings)
for a taste of traditional, rich north
ern food.
With entrees at around $15 and
appetizers at $6, you probably
won't be eating at Little Copen
hagen every week. But the food
and atmosphere are worth the price
at least once. And remember that
the Vikings, who crossed the At
lantic in a rowboat, ate this stuff
all the time.

Little Copenhagen is located at
2826 El Camino Real, in Redwood
City. Reservations are recom
mended; call 365-6616.
