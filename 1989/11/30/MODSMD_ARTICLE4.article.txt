Editor's note: This is the final
article in a four-part series on
unique individuals in Stanford's
graduate schools.

In the fall of 1970, a 20-year
old American arrived, unan
nounced, in a small Indian
village in the foothills of the
Himalayas.
His purpose? To become a
Buddhist monk.
The village, Dharamsala, is
the cultural center of the exiled
Tibetan Buddhists and home to
their spiritual and political
leader, the Dalai Lama. The
American, Alan Wallace, wanted
to study and live in Dharamsala
for 10 years, learning to become
a Buddhist monk.
Wallace's interest in eastern
philosophy and religion was not
unusual for a student of the
19605. "I was feeling less and
less satisfied in terms of the
questions and issues that I was
dealing with in my personal life
and the kind of responses I was
given by religion and science,"
he says."I was having a difficult
time making coherent sense of
the world."
Howevrt", Wallace, now a grad
uate student in comparative re
ligion at Stanford, arrived in
Dharamsala with a unique
quality: he spoke Tibetan.
Wallace had become interested

in Tibetan Buddhism during a
college year abroad in Germany
when he found the University
of Gottingen lacking offerings in
ecology and philosophy, the
fields he originally intended to
study By the end of the year,
he had dropped all his courses
except Tibetan, and he decided
that what he wanted to learn
about Buddhism required total
immersion.
After more than a year of fur
ther language study in Dharam
sala, Wallace followed the Dalai
Lama's prompting and enrolled
in the Buddhist School of Dialec
tics, a monastic training school
for young Tibetans who have al
ready had some religious educa
tion.
During his training, Wallace
memorized entire Buddhist
texts, reciting from them during
daily debates that often lasted
more than five hours.
"On the debating ground you
don't bring any books," he
recalls. "Everything you bring
in is citations you quote from
memory "
His American Baptist parents
were appalled at his training,
and during the five years he
spent in India, Wallace had little
contact with his family.
"I had no financial support
from my parents, who were to
tally averse to my doing this,"

more about the religion, Wallace joined a Himalayan monastery
where he sought to "make coherent sense of the world."
he says. "So I was cut off even
from my own money. I had no
source of money except for dona
tions, so it was very hard physi
cally. We (the monks) were living
on $8 a month."
By late summer 1973, Wallace
was so near death from malnutri
tion that monks were performing
a funeral ceremony in the next
room. He says he owes his sur
vival to Tibetan medicine and a
"source of inspiration."
When Wallace speaks, his train
ing is evident. He has a soft, in
tense voice that quickens as he
expands on a point, as if his words
can not keep up with his ideas.
Wallace describes his back
ground as two-fold — raised in a
very religious household, yet
trained from a very early age to
be a scientist. In 1983, 10 years
after he dropped out of UC-Davis
to study Buddhism, Wallace
decided to complete his under
graduate degree. He attended Am
herst College, where he compared

modern physics with Buddhist
philosophy
"I came back to science because
I wanted to make my peace with
it,"he sayß. "And I did."
Feeling that further intensive
monastic training was no longer
relevant to what he wanted to
pursue, Wallace gave up his
monastic vows in 1987. He says
he now considers himself a Bud
dhist, but not a monk.
Wallace is considered an excel
lent teacher by both his students
and professors. Mark Unno, a doc
toral candidate in religious studies
who took Tibetan from Wallace as
a student at Amherst, says Wal
lace was a "very clear and thor
ough teacher."
Wallace's physics professors at
Amherst admired his ability to
explain complex Buddhist philos
ophy to scientists with no back
ground in religion.
"The interface between Bud
dhism and science, and Buddhism
and Western philosophy and reli
gion, is an integration of my own
life," says Wallace.
Most of Wallace's Vietnam-era
peers who turned to eastern reli
gion eventually lost interest and

moved on to new things. Some
have returned in the 1980s
through the New Age movement,
which Wallace says he views with
"severe misgivings."
Like much of the diluted Bud
dhism that was followed during
the '60s and '70s, "the New Age
movement fails to confront an es
sential issue — it doesn't want to
deal with suffering or evil," Wal
lace says.
The "four noble truths" that
underlie all Buddhism are that
life is suffering, that suffering is
caused by desire, that you can
liberate yourself from desire and
that the path to this liberation
involves discipline. "You can't
overlook [the suffering]," Wallace
says."And if you do you simply
miss the whole point."
The Dalai Lama has said that
"the task of a true teacher is to
help people become what they
are."
And Alan Wallace is a good stu
dent. He has taken what he
learned in India and used it to
enrich — not escape — his life as
an American, a Buddhist, a scien
tist and a scholar.

cally. We (the monks) were living
on $8 a month."
By late summer 1973, Wallace
was so near death from malnutri
tion that monks were performing
a funeral ceremony in the next
room. He says he owes his sur
vival to Tibetan medicine and a
"source of inspiration."
When Wallace speaks, his train
ing is evident. He has a soft, in
tense voice that quickens as he
expands on a point, as if his words
can not keep up with his ideas.
Wallace describes his back
ground as two-fold — raised in a
very religious household, yet
trained from a very early age to
be a scientist. In 1983, 10 years
after he dropped out of UC-Davis
to study Buddhism, Wallace
decided to complete his under
graduate degree. He attended Am
herst College, where he compared

modern physics with Buddhist
philosophy
"I came back to science because
I wanted to make my peace with
it,"he sayß. "And I did."
Feeling that further intensive
monastic training was no longer
relevant to what he wanted to
pursue, Wallace gave up his
monastic vows in 1987. He says
he now considers himself a Bud
dhist, but not a monk.
Wallace is considered an excel
lent teacher by both his students
and professors. Mark Unno, a doc
toral candidate in religious studies
who took Tibetan from Wallace as
a student at Amherst, says Wal
lace was a "very clear and thor
ough teacher."
Wallace's physics professors at
Amherst admired his ability to
explain complex Buddhist philos
ophy to scientists with no back
ground in religion.
"The interface between Bud
dhism and science, and Buddhism
and Western philosophy and reli
gion, is an integration of my own
life," says Wallace.
Most of Wallace's Vietnam-era
peers who turned to eastern reli
gion eventually lost interest and

moved on to new things. Some
have returned in the 1980s
through the New Age movement,
which Wallace says he views with
"severe misgivings."
Like much of the diluted Bud
dhism that was followed during
the '60s and '70s, "the New Age
movement fails to confront an es
sential issue — it doesn't want to
deal with suffering or evil," Wal
lace says.
The "four noble truths" that
underlie all Buddhism are that
life is suffering, that suffering is
caused by desire, that you can
liberate yourself from desire and
that the path to this liberation
involves discipline. "You can't
overlook [the suffering]," Wallace
says."And if you do you simply
miss the whole point."
The Dalai Lama has said that
"the task of a true teacher is to
help people become what they
are."
And Alan Wallace is a good stu
dent. He has taken what he
learned in India and used it to
enrich — not escape — his life as
an American, a Buddhist, a scien
tist and a scholar.

unique individuals in Stanford's
graduate schools.

In the fall of 1970, a 20-year
old American arrived, unan
nounced, in a small Indian
village in the foothills of the
Himalayas.
His purpose? To become a
Buddhist monk.
The village, Dharamsala, is
the cultural center of the exiled
Tibetan Buddhists and home to
their spiritual and political
leader, the Dalai Lama. The
American, Alan Wallace, wanted
to study and live in Dharamsala
for 10 years, learning to become
a Buddhist monk.
Wallace's interest in eastern
philosophy and religion was not
unusual for a student of the
19605. "I was feeling less and
less satisfied in terms of the
questions and issues that I was
dealing with in my personal life
and the kind of responses I was
given by religion and science,"
he says."I was having a difficult
time making coherent sense of
the world."
Howevrt", Wallace, now a grad
uate student in comparative re
ligion at Stanford, arrived in
Dharamsala with a unique
quality: he spoke Tibetan.
Wallace had become interested

in Tibetan Buddhism during a
college year abroad in Germany
when he found the University
of Gottingen lacking offerings in
ecology and philosophy, the
fields he originally intended to
study By the end of the year,
he had dropped all his courses
except Tibetan, and he decided
that what he wanted to learn
about Buddhism required total
immersion.
After more than a year of fur
ther language study in Dharam
sala, Wallace followed the Dalai
Lama's prompting and enrolled
in the Buddhist School of Dialec
tics, a monastic training school
for young Tibetans who have al
ready had some religious educa
tion.
During his training, Wallace
memorized entire Buddhist
texts, reciting from them during
daily debates that often lasted
more than five hours.
"On the debating ground you
don't bring any books," he
recalls. "Everything you bring
in is citations you quote from
memory "
His American Baptist parents
were appalled at his training,
and during the five years he
spent in India, Wallace had little
contact with his family.
"I had no financial support
from my parents, who were to
tally averse to my doing this,"
