Editor's note: This is the final
article in a four-part series on
unique individuals in Stanford's
graduate schools.

In the fall of 1970, a 20-year
old American arrived, unan
nounced, in a small Indian
village in the foothills of the
Himalayas.
His purpose? To become a
Buddhist monk.
The village, Dharamsala, is
the cultural center of the exiled
Tibetan Buddhists and home to
their spiritual and political
leader, the Dalai Lama. The
American, Alan Wallace, wanted
to study and live in Dharamsala
for 10 years, learning to become
a Buddhist monk.
Wallace's interest in eastern
philosophy and religion was not
unusual for a student of the
19605. "I was feeling less and
less satisfied in terms of the
questions and issues that I was
dealing with in my personal life
and the kind of responses I was
given by religion and science,"
he says."I was having a difficult
time making coherent sense of
the world."
Howevrt", Wallace, now a grad
uate student in comparative re
ligion at Stanford, arrived in
Dharamsala with a unique
quality: he spoke Tibetan.
Wallace had become interested

in Tibetan Buddhism during a
college year abroad in Germany
when he found the University
of Gottingen lacking offerings in
ecology and philosophy, the
fields he originally intended to
study By the end of the year,
he had dropped all his courses
except Tibetan, and he decided
that what he wanted to learn
about Buddhism required total
immersion.
After more than a year of fur
ther language study in Dharam
sala, Wallace followed the Dalai
Lama's prompting and enrolled
in the Buddhist School of Dialec
tics, a monastic training school
for young Tibetans who have al
ready had some religious educa
tion.
During his training, Wallace
memorized entire Buddhist
texts, reciting from them during
daily debates that often lasted
more than five hours.
"On the debating ground you
don't bring any books," he
recalls. "Everything you bring
in is citations you quote from
memory "
His American Baptist parents
were appalled at his training,
and during the five years he
spent in India, Wallace had little
contact with his family.
"I had no financial support
from my parents, who were to
tally averse to my doing this,"
