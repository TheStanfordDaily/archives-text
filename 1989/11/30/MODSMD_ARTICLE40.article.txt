# Strange rumblings from Nitery Theater
## 
### 
Not everything that goes bump
in the night is scary.
Sometimes, nocturnal
thumpers can be downright
hilarious. "Playing the Palace,"
the Drama Department's latest
presentation, is just such a play.
Set in San Francisco's Palace
Hotel, the new American trans
lation of Ferenc Molnar's com
edy revolves around a cast of

glamorous guests. Famous
playwight Sandor Turai'and his
collaborator Gal have invited
their young protege, Albert and
his fiancee, Annie, on a vacation.
Yet when the trio of men over
hears strange rumblings from
Annie's room, Turai and Gal are
hard-pressed to convince young
Albert that all he overheard was
a rehearsal from a scene in a

new play.
"Playing the Palace" was di
rected by Anne McNaughton,
who is currently studying at
Stanford for her Ph.D. in Direct
ing and Dramatic Criticism.

"Playing the Palace" runs
tonight, tomorrow and Saturday
at 8 p.m., with a 2 p.m. matinee
Sunday, in the Nitery Theater.
