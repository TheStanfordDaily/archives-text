# Eating at De Angelo's is much cheaper than flying to Europe
## 
### Kim Kochaver 
Since returning from Berlin last year I
have been searching for restaurants that
have the same casual and relaxed atmos
phere common to many German cafes. I
believe I have finally found one.
Unlike many restaurants where you are
assaulted at the door by a mini-skirted
blonde equipped with a plastic smile and
menus, at DeAngelo's you order at the
register, pay and then seat yourself. Since
the cafe is neither too large nor packed
to the hilt, this does not involve waiting
in line or fighting over chairs. It does,

however, dramatically decrease the price
of the food, with entrees ranging from
only $3.10 to $4.75.
The walls are lined with colorful modern
paintings and the lights arc appropriately
dimmed without making the room dark.
Live entertainment is featured nightly
from Tuesday to Saturday with perform
ances ranging from jazz to reggae to
bluegrass.
We were treated to an outstanding dis
play of what two musicians with a Mac
intosh computer can create. "Pieces of
Magic," is a two-man group specializing
in computer music.

The size of the restaurant made both
the music and the musicians accessible.
We were even able to approach the stage
during a break for a first-hand demonstra
tion of the system.
Additionally, DeAngelo's promises veg
etarian specialties of many nationalities
— and the menu doesn't lie. From Greek
yohas to Chinese eggrolls to Jewish
knishes and Mideastern falafels, DeAn
gelo's offers a much wider range of vege
tarian dishes than can be found in almost
any other local restaurant.
We started with "Fruit Smoothies" —
an improved version of Hobees' "Energy

Blends." A mixture of fresh fruit, yogurt,
juice and honey, these "health shakes" are
excellent. They are a bit filling as a drink,
but make refreshing desserts.
A fervent supporter of Italian food, I
had to order the Vegetarian Spinach
Lasagne. Made with pasta, cheeses, tangy
tomato sauce and — of course — spinach,
the lasagne that came with a large piece
of sourdough bread made quite a favorable
impression.
The Deluxe Falafel interestingly com
bined chick peas and spices to form its
falafel balls, and along with tomatoes,
cucumbers, lettuce and a home-made

ranch dressing, the falafel came stuffed in
pita bread. The ingredients may sound
light, but the sandwich is definitely enough
to fill you up.
Although the dessert menu is not elab
orate, the baklava and truffle-like "moun
tain logs" go well with after-dinner coffee
and tea.
Like European cafes, DeAngelo's is not
in a rush to hurry out its customers after
the meal is finished. Just order one of
their coffee specialties and kick back.

DeAngelo's Delicafe is at 951 W. Dana
St.in Mountain View.
