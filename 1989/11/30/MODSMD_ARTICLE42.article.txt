# Some Branner boys make good

About once every four years
something good actually comes out
of Branner Hall, or so I hear. This
time, that one good thing just
might be Area One, a band formed
two years ago by a group of five
eager freshmen.
The band started when guitarist
Tony Lillios (junior, electrical en
gineering) got together with bassist
Soham Roy (junior, human biol
ogy) for a Branner talent show.
Their impressed resident assis
tant suggested that they form a
band and play at an upcoming
Branner party — a suggestion the
freshmen took to heart. And thus,
Area One was formed.
After a quarter of shuffling
through various players and sing
ers, they happened upon their cur
rent line-up consisting of Lillios,
Roy, Clarke Watson (junior, elec
trical engineering) on drums, Rod

Atamain (junior, human biology
and economics) also on guitar,
Sean Botkin (junior, music) on
keyboards and Danny Yu (junior,
mechanical engineering) on vocals.
With this line-up, they began
performing regularly at campus
parties. And since spring quarter
1988, Area One has earned a rep
utation as one of the hippest dance
bands on campus.
Their shows combine a wide va
riety of pop music from the '70s
and '80s, including covers of bands
such as Tommy Tutone, The Cars
and The Beatles. In short, they
love to play those songs that "you
used to roller skate to" in junior
high.
Old pop tunes are not the only
music Area One does. You can
also hear everything from The
Cure to U2 to AC/DC during an
Area One performance.
Vocalist Yu was originally a
guitarist. But when opportunity
knocked, Yu flung the door wide

open. Area One already had two
men on guitar, so he decided to
audition as a singer.
Other band members have mu
sical interests outside of Area One.
For example, Botkin is majoring
in music and has received national
recognition for his talents on the
piano.
Roy plays the violin and writes
musicals outside the band.
The band has managed to work
out a peaceful method of integrat
ing new songs into their repertoire.
Each member brings about three
songs to their weekly rehearsal,
and they all vote on them. The
three songs with the most votes
are then learned and included in
the playlist.
Yet the true backbone of this
band is the friendship between its
members. Having lived together,
taken classes together and skipped
sections together, playing music
together has become that much
more fun.
