# Scorpions really sting

Every so often a band releases
a "best of" album with one or two
new tracks on it â€” and this is
exactly what the Scorpions have
just done.

The two new tracks
are definitely worth
picking up anyway,
even though Klaus
Meine looks way
whipped on the cover.

After ten studio albums, two live
albums and a tour of the Soviet
Union last year, the Scorpions
decided it was time to gather ten
of their best songs since signing
guitarist Matthias Jabs.
Going back to 1979's "Love
drive," the Scorpions included hard
rock classics like "The Zoo" and

"Rock You Like A Hurricane" to
the equally memorable love songs
"Still Loving You," "No One Like
You" and "Holiday."
Nestled amongst these tracks are
two new songs, "I Can't Explain"
and "Hey You." Together, they
form "Best of Rockers 'N' Ballads,"
the Scorpions' third compilation al
bum.
If you are a hard-core Scorpions
fan and won't be happy unless you
own everything they've ever re
corded, you will like the"I Can't
Explain" CD maxi-single that in
cludes both new tracks along with
1982's "Blackout."
The two new tracks are
definitely worth picking up any
way, even though Klaus Meine
looks way whipped on the cover.
Equally impressive is the track
"Hey You," which demonstrates a
Jabs/Schenker guitar mix that dif
fers noticeably from anything they
have previously released. Not to
worry, though; it's also a great
tune.
"I Can't Explain" is unmis
takeably Scorpions in style and
content. In other words, it's great.
