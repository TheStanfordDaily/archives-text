# Whitesnake makes a 'Slip of the Tongue'

Few rock bands have much of
a history behind them. They
usually record a few albums, have
a hit or two then fade away to
become answers to obscure music
trivia questions.
This is where the hard-rocking
band Whitesnake differs from vir
tually every other glam rock band.
Whitesnake's genealogy goes all
the way back to the very roots of
Europe's classic hard rock scene.
Singer/songwriter David Cover
dale began his career with Deep
Purple, replacing lan Gillian in the
early '70s. And if you know rock,
you know that Deep Purple
spawned and influenced some of
the hardest rocking bands of the
'70s and '80s including Black Sab

bath, Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow
and, of course, Whitesnake.
Coverdale is the only original
member still with the band, but
Whitesnake's current line-up is
more impressive than ever.
Tommy Aldridge utilizes his
Yamaha drums to their thundering
fullest, while bassist Rudy Sarzo
(formerly of the post-Randy
Rhodes Quiet Riot) lays down pow
erful bass-lines in track after rock
ing track.
Although both musicians dem
onstrate great talent, the true ar
tistry in Whitesnake's latest
release, "Slip of the Tongue," is
the guitar work provided by guitar
virtuoso Steve Vai (formerly with
David Lee Roth). His brilliant per
formance has hints of early Van
Halen and Led Zeppelin influences
— but it remains unquestionably

pure Vai.
Coverdale's co-writer is guitarist
Adrian Vandenbcrg who could not
play on this album because of an
injury to his left wrist. Don't fret
(no pun intended); he is fine now
and is practicing for their upcom
ing tour in support of "Slip of the
Tongue" which kicks off in Feb
ruary.
After standing in the shadow of
near-obscurity for over a decade,
Whitesnake broke loose with their
nine-time platinum self-titled al
bum in 1987. They hope to keep
the ball rolling with "Slip of the
Tongue."
With such hard core rock clas
sics as "Slow An' Easy" and "Spit
It Out" from 1984's "Slide It In"
and the more restrained love songs
"Here I Go Again" and "Is This
Love" from 1987's "Whitesnake,"

Whitesnake has already proven
their talents go far beyond those
of most heavy metal bands.
"Slip of the Tongue" continues
where their "Whitesnake" album
left off — and it goes much, much
further. It has its share of down
'n' dirty hard rock tunes, like the
title track, "Cheap An' Nasty" and
the high-powered "Kittens Got
Claws," which showcases Vai's un
deniably awesome talents.
Of the 10 songs on "Slip of the
Tongue," nine are easily good
enough to release as singles. The
only one that falls noticeably short
of the rest is "Slow Poke Music."
The not-so-subtly entitled "Slip
of the Tongue" ensures that
Whitesnake will continue to be one
of the best and hardest rocking
bands well into the '90s.
