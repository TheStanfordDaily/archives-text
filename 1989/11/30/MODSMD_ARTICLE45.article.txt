# Go sink your teeth into D'Arby's 'Flesh'

"I think I'm a genius."
— Rolling Stone June 16, 1988
Though his first album,
"Introducing the Hardline Accord
ing to Terence Trent D'Arby,"
included such top-ten hits as
"Wishing Well" and "Sign Your
Name," what brought D'Arby
widespread recognition was his
brash arrogance and egotistical per
sonality.
Soon, D'Arby's mouth was as
sociated with not only an impres
sive vocal style but also a
magnificent tendency for self-hype.
After he personally described his
album as "a better work than 'Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band,' " it became clear that
D'Arby's vanity was unbounded.
In his mind he was a musical
genius.

Although some of the
album's songs are
overambitious, "Nei
ther Fish Nor Flesh"
highlights his impres
sive vocal capabili
ties.

With his second album, "Neither
Fish Nor Flesh," D'Arby proves
that his claim was not unfounded.
Although some of the album's
songs are overambitious, "Neither
Fish Nor Flesh" highlights his im
pressive vocal capabilities and
provocative song-writing style.
D'Arby may be pretentious — but
this second album proves that his
talent is no fluke.
"Rock 'n' roll has never been
about just music. It is music, at
titude, personality, persona, myth,
legend."
- L.A. Times Oct. 29, 1989
"Fish" is subtitled "A Sound
track of Love, Faith, Hope and
Destruction." Only someone as
ambitious as D'Arby would at
tempt to address such a diversity
of song topics.

In "Billy Don't Fall," D'Arby
reflects on the death of a homo
sexual friend alienated by his fam
ily in his final days. "Billy died a
young man/His face to the
wind/And of the things I regret the
most/Was seeing how hate and fear
killed a friend." Obviously, D'Arby
is unafraid to address even the
most delicate issues.
He also successfully adapts his
vocal stvle to the atmosphere and
mood of the song. In"I Have Faith
in These Desolate Times," his
light, serene voice reveals a slight
sense of naivete, as he counters
the sorrows of today with op
timism for the future.
Yet, on the album's faster tracks,
D'Arby also shows he definitely
knows funk. "I'll Be Alright" begins
with a gospel-style opening that
breaks into a resounding chorus
of piano, saxophone and a strong
bass. His limitless energy radiates
from the speakers.
In "You Will Pay Tomorrow"
and "Attracted to You," D'Arby
alludes to the funky style of lames
Brown and Prince. Backed by
catchy beats and quick guitar riffs,
D'Arby's voice sounds raspy, sharp
and solid. The variety and strength
of his vocal styles is quite remark
able.
"I don't think there is anyone
I've ever met who has been more
passionate about music than me."
—L.A. Times. Oct. 29, 1989
Sometimes, however, D'Arby is
too enigmatic. The title track, a
one-verse epigram, loses its sym
bolic punch in an inane echoing
fade. "Roly Poly" overwhelms with
confusing imagery. The lyrics run,
". . . if you listen to confusion/Long
enough it starts to make sense."
D'Arby is apparently striving to be
a step beyond comprehension.
This yearning detracts from an
otherwise enjoyable album.
On the album's opening track,
D'Arby asserts that he "will not
be defined." Ironically, "Neither
Fish Nor Flesh" does just that; it
defines him as one of the up-and
coming stars of the future.
D'Arby may not be a genius.
But he certainly has the talent,
ambition and creativity to become
one.
