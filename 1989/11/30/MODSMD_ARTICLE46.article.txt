Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Murphy, Eddie
Murphy, Eddie Murphy. No less than five times does
Mr. "you know who" receive a credit in the opening
of "Harlem Nights." However, the real issue is not
Murphy's egomania, but if this film is any good.
Frankly, it's cinematic swill. Who's to blame? Eddie
Murphy.
After opening with a scene in 1918 that establishes
the relationship between Sugar Ray (Richard Pryor)
and Quick (Eddie Murphy), the action shifts forward
20 years to the nightclub that the two of them run
in Harlem.
Unfortunately, the club is too popular and attracts
the attention of the local crime boss, Bugsy Calhoun.
From there the rest of the film concerns the crime
boss' efforts to shut down Sugar Ray and Quick.
The film's problems are apparent in the first scene
when it ends with murder instead of a laugh. It was
at that point that it occurred to me that "Harlem
Nights" might be a serious homage to 1930s gangster
films. However, that theory falls apart with such
unfunny attempts at comedy as Murphy shooting
off the little toe of Vera (Delia Reese), the club's
motherly madam.
Another misguided stab at comedy involves a
bizarre Arsenio Hall cameo. I say bizarre because it
seems that Hall is "acting" under the delusion that
his scenes are even remotely funny. The whole cameo
comes off as awkward as a Pat Sajak monologue.
Talk about potential, the cast of "Harlem Nights"
has it to spare â€” and Eddie Murphy's pathetic di
rection manages to waste it all. Murphy never gives
his cast any opportunity or reason to do anything
more than sleepwalk through their roles. Only Rich
ard Pryor and Danny Aiello are worth noting, and
that is simply because they give believable perform
ances.
The script by Murphy is half profanity. The other
half is a combination of the films "Scarface," "The
Sting" and"The Cotton Club."
One thing is for sure, Murphy should stick with
John Landis instead of trying to direct his own films.
Several times throughout "Harlem Nights," Murphy
will assemble almost all of the characters in one
room and have them sit around like they're waiting
to have a family portrait taken.
With the exception of the scenes in Sugar Ray's
club, the film looks and feels low budget.
