# 'Future' is guaranteed
## Sequel succeeds in recapturing past creativity

Many "intellectual" people don't ap
prove of films that don't offer morally
challenging, intellectually stimulating
themes. These people deny themselves
the pleasure of viewing a movie "just for
fun."
And when films like the extremely en
tertaining "Back to the Future Part 2"
come out, I pity such ascetics.
"Back to the Future Part 2" is the long
awaited sequel to the original Bob
Zemeckis flick — that's right, you
guessed it — "Back to the Future." How
ever, unlike the vast majority of uncrea
tive, formula-bound sequels, the most
uninspired thing about this movie is its
title.
The film begins exactly where the first
left off, with Marty McFly (Michael J.
Fox), Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher
Lloyd) and Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer
(Elizabeth Shue), about to embark on a
journey to 2015 A.D. to fix up some
problems with the McFly kids.
Zemeckis' vision of the future is en
tertaining. There is a remarkable conti
nuity running throughout all scenes of
this movie to tie it in with the first.
For example — and I feel okay telling
you about this since it's all over the
television previews — the skateboard
scene from the original movie's 1950s
sequence recreates itself in the future on
hoverboards, or floating skateboards.
While this may seem uncreative and
repetitive in words alone, on the silver
screen the scene emerges as both
suspenseful and amusing. Zemeckis also
builds upon the set created for the 1950s
and 1980s and depicts the evolution of
the same edifices in the town square.
Although the certain resurfacing situ
ations are somewhat predictable,
Zemeckis consistently goes beyond our
expectations, giving us surprise after
surprise.
Pleasantly surprising also is the quality

of the special effects. Industrial Light and
Magic once again lends its superior skills
to produce a range of believable, visually
effective scenes of flying cars, advertise
ment holograms and other "future stuff"
that you'd be angry at me for giving awav

Michael J. Fox plays a
teenage Marty, a middle
age Marty and the
teenage daughter of the
older Marty — and he
even has a nice pair of
legs.

The makeup, too, is superb. Michael
J. Fox plays not only a teen-age Marty,
but also a middle-aged Marty and the
teen-age daughter of the older Marty —
and he even has a nice pair of legs. Lea
Thompson, as Marty's mother, and
Thomas Wilson, as the evil Biff, also
reemerge in several impressive, different
guises.
The only real reservation I have about
the movie is the prevalence of motion
picture "ads" in the form of spots for
Nike, Pepsi and Texaco. Although such
appearances do serve a purpose in further
illustrating the continuity among the dif
ferent eras, at times they are blatant
enough to make me groan. Even in this
case, however, the products have some
sort of twist that is entertaining.
All things considered, I don't see how
you couldn't enjoy watching this movie.
It has a clever plot (that I'm trying des
perately to conceal). It's well directed.
The actors deliver good performances.
The special effects, costumes and
makeup are wonderful. But most of all,
"Back to the Future Part 2" is fun.
