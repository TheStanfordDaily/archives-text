# Trailers will replace damaged classrooms
## 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
When geology students return
to Stanford from winter break,
they may find themselves in a
strange kind of classroom â€” a
trailer.
These trailers, officially called
"modular units," will soon be set
up as temporary offices and class
rooms for University departments
displaced by the Oct. 17 earth
quake.
The modular units, which are
60 feet long and 12 feet wide, will
be bolted together to form build
ings on three separate locations
on campus: Roble Field, Galvez
Mall and a portion of the Wilbur
Hall parking lot near the corner
of Campus Drive and Escondido
Road.
The units will cover about
65,000 square feet of space and
are likely to remain on campus
for at least two years, said Tom
Dipressi, chair of a Facilities Proj
ect Management task force coor
dinating the modular unit project.
The trailers were originally
scheduled to arrive at Stanford
early this week from the Los An
geles area, Dipressi said. How
ever, highway officials would not
allow big rigs which transport the
modulars to travel on the roads
because of strong Santa Ana
winds. Dipressi expects the
modulars to arrive tomorrow
morning.
Three large modular units will

be set up on the Wilbur parking
lot, covering 25,000 square feet.
A memorandum distributed ear
lier this week to residents on the
east side of campus urged stu
dents to move their cars to an
other section of the lot sometime
today or tomorrow.
According to the memorandum,
"site clearance" in the lot will con
sist of removing some trees and
perhaps demolishing some curbs
and dismantling one or two
lampposts.
Once the modular units are in
stalled, contractors will set up the
interiors. The furniture will come
from the buildings damaged by
the earthquake. Dipressi said he
hopes that the trailers will be
ready for use in the first week of
January.
Modular units in Galvez Mall
will house library offices and some
classrooms. The University's lan
guage departments will fill the
units in Wilbur parking lot, and
the Geology Department will use
the trailers located in Roble Field,
according to Julia Fremon,
managing director of Real Estate
and Lands Management.
The Modular Task Force,
chaired by Dipressi and consisting
of about 15 members, had its first
meeting Nov. 9. Members have
spent the time since then trying
to solve the problem of displaced
offices and classrooms, Dipressi
said.
"It seems like 10 years but it's
only been three weeks," he said.
