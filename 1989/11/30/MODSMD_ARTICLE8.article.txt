# After 2-month wait, SCLC ready to meet
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Fall quarter might be winding
down, but the Student Conduct
Legislative Council is just getting
started. It will hold its first meet
ing of the year today.
The 12-member council will
wrestle with the same heated
issue it faced last year: whether
it is possible and desirable for
Stanford to limit free speech and
protect individuals from verbal
harassment.
Already tackling this question
is Law Prof. Thomas Grey. At
today's meeting, the council will
discuss Grey's revised Fundamen
tal Standard interpretation, which
seeks to limit certain types of
speech considered racially offen
sive.
First introduced last April,
Grey's proposal more closely ad
hered to judicial interpretations
of the First Amendment than an
earlier interpretation which the
Stanford community rejected in
March. But the academic year
ended before the council could
take any action on Grey's propos
al.
Grey has made slight modifica
tions and reworded some phrases
in the proposal the council will
examine today.
"We're going to get down to
business on Grey's proposal," said
SCLC member Perry Friedman,
a senior.
But Friedman and other council
members contacted last night ex
pressed reservations about Grey's
proposal.
Junior Ravi Bellur said he does
not support amending the Fun-

damental Standard and does not
believe in restricting free speech
in any way.
"I think a lot of [Grey's pro
posal] is just clarification," he
said. "If people misbehave ... and
if anyone is blatantly racist on
this campus ... the community's
censure is very effective" as dis
cipline.
Friedman also opposed Grey's
proposal. "I'd like to see if we can
drop the proposal," he said. Fried
man said the proposal poses the
ambiguous problem of deciding
what type of speech is acceptable.
"It's trivializing the Fundamental
Standard to tack things on to it,"
he said.
According to Bellur, this year's
council got off to a late start be
cause it had a difficult time find
ing someone to chair the group.
Eventually, Law Prof. Robert
Rabin volunteered to head the
council.
According to Friedman, "no one
really wanted to chair (the SCLC)
because of all the responsibility
and all the public backlash last
year."
Besides discussing Grey's pro
posal, council members will sum
marize last year's SCLC activities
and set their schedules for up
coming meetings, Bellur said.
Discussing goals for the year,
Friedman said he would like to
see the council appoint a "public
defender and student advocate" to
the group.
According to Friedman, SCLC
ex officio member and Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole cur
rently fills this role but often
encounters conflicts of interest as
both an adviser and a prosecutor.
