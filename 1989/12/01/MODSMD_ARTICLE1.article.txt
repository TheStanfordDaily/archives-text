# Visa bill veto shocks Chinese students here
## 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer With wire reports 
Despite intensive lobbying from Chinese students
around the nation, including many at Stanford,
President Bush yesterday announced he was vetoing
a bill to allow Chinese students to stay in the United
States after their visas expire.
Calling the bill an infringement on his presidential
authority, Bush said in a statement that the measure
was unneeded in light of administrative steps he
had taken to accomplish the same ends.
In a memorandum released yesterday, Bush called
on the Attorney General to provide protections to
Chinese students, including an irrevocable waiver
of the two-year home-country return requirement,
continued lawful immigration status, authorization
for employment, and notice of expiration of non
immigrant status rather than institution of depor
tation procedures.
Bush claims his four-part memorandum is at least
equivalent to Rep. Nancy Pelosi's bill, if not more
comprehensive.
However, a congressional sponsor of the legisla
tion, Rep. Bruce Morrison, accused Bush of yielding
to pressure from the Beijing government, which had
strongly opposed the bill.
"I'm shocked that the president would kowtow in
this way to the demands of the Chinese communist
government, especially when that government was
threatening Chinese students here in the United
States and telling them that the United States was
not going to protect them," said Morrison, chair of
a House judiciary subcommittee on immigration.
Chinese students at Stanford received the news
of the veto late Thursday afternoon with confusion.
"I am very disappointed and very frustrated," said
one graduate student, who requested anonymity.
Students are puzzled by Bush's insistence on going
ahead with the veto despite the wide support enjoyed
by the bill, which encountered no opposition in
Congress. The veto came on the heels of a letter
in support of the bill signed by 71 senators. The
bill was sponsored by Pelosi.
"If this bill represents the opinions of most Amer
icans," queried Yin Hezhu, president of the Asso
ciation of Chinese Students and Scholars at Stanford,
"why does Bush have to veto it?"
Despite Bush's claims about the merits of his
memorandum, students are not ready to abandon
the Pelosi bill.
"We wanted the Pelosi bill, we still want it, and
we regret that Bush vetoed it," a student here said.
The seeming inconsistency between State Depart
ment opposition to the Pelosi bill on the grounds
that it would be offensive to the Chinese government
and Bush's claim that his alternative is more com
prehensive than Pelosi's plan leads students here
to wonder what the president's real motives are.
"I don't think it's very logical," said one student.
"If he had really intended to help Chinese students,
he would have introduced something like [the Pelosi
