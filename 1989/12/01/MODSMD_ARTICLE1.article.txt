# Visa bill veto shocks Chinese students here
## 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer With wire reports 
Despite intensive lobbying from Chinese students
around the nation, including many at Stanford,
President Bush yesterday announced he was vetoing
a bill to allow Chinese students to stay in the United
States after their visas expire.
Calling the bill an infringement on his presidential
authority, Bush said in a statement that the measure
was unneeded in light of administrative steps he
had taken to accomplish the same ends.
In a memorandum released yesterday, Bush called
on the Attorney General to provide protections to
Chinese students, including an irrevocable waiver
of the two-year home-country return requirement,
continued lawful immigration status, authorization
for employment, and notice of expiration of non
immigrant status rather than institution of depor
tation procedures.
Bush claims his four-part memorandum is at least
equivalent to Rep. Nancy Pelosi's bill, if not more
comprehensive.
However, a congressional sponsor of the legisla
tion, Rep. Bruce Morrison, accused Bush of yielding
to pressure from the Beijing government, which had
strongly opposed the bill.
"I'm shocked that the president would kowtow in
this way to the demands of the Chinese communist
government, especially when that government was
threatening Chinese students here in the United
States and telling them that the United States was
not going to protect them," said Morrison, chair of
a House judiciary subcommittee on immigration.
Chinese students at Stanford received the news
of the veto late Thursday afternoon with confusion.
"I am very disappointed and very frustrated," said
one graduate student, who requested anonymity.
Students are puzzled by Bush's insistence on going
ahead with the veto despite the wide support enjoyed
by the bill, which encountered no opposition in
Congress. The veto came on the heels of a letter
in support of the bill signed by 71 senators. The
bill was sponsored by Pelosi.
"If this bill represents the opinions of most Amer
icans," queried Yin Hezhu, president of the Asso
ciation of Chinese Students and Scholars at Stanford,
"why does Bush have to veto it?"
Despite Bush's claims about the merits of his
memorandum, students are not ready to abandon
the Pelosi bill.
"We wanted the Pelosi bill, we still want it, and
we regret that Bush vetoed it," a student here said.
The seeming inconsistency between State Depart
ment opposition to the Pelosi bill on the grounds
that it would be offensive to the Chinese government
and Bush's claim that his alternative is more com
prehensive than Pelosi's plan leads students here
to wonder what the president's real motives are.
"I don't think it's very logical," said one student.
"If he had really intended to help Chinese students,
he would have introduced something like [the Pelosi
bill] a half year ago, rather than
at the last minute."
There are fears that an admin
istrative action will not provide
the same protection as would a
law. "We prefer law to regula
tion," a student said at the Chi
nese scholars' association meeting
Thursday night. "It's more se
cure."
The question that remains un
answered is how Bush's memoran
dum will be implemented. John
Pearson, director of the Interna
tional Center, said he is waiting
to see "how [Bush's proposal] will
be translated into administrative
action."
Chinese students at Stanford
share Pearson's caution. There is
a general hesitancy to comment
on the memorandum until it has
been painstakingly examined.
Right now we are waiting to see
what kind of package the State
Department comes up with," said
one Stanford graduate student.

"I really feel that we need to
talk to lawyers before anything
can be said," explained another
graduate student.
One particular concern is
whether or not the return waiver
is something the students have to
opt for on an individual basis,
rather than the blanket exemp
tion of the Pelosi bill.
"Those who want it waived are
hesitant to stick out their necks
and say 'I want a waiver,' " said
Douglas Pan, a graduate student
in electrical engineering. The fear
is that by the act of requesting a
waiver they will be identified by
the government as dissidents in
opposition to communist policies.
Students at Stanford do not
know what is next for the Pelosi
bill. They point out that there are
more actors involved in mustering
support for an override of the veto
than just the students, and they
do not know how members of Con
gress will react.
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said in a statement, "I oppose the
veto and I hope Congress will
override it. The president should
have stood up for the courageous

Chinese students, instead of
bowing to the cruel Chinese
regime."
"We will stand with Congress,"
said a student here, "and we hope
the administration will help us."
Although no one is suggesting
giving up the struggle, students
do not look forward to the process
of reintroducing the bill when
Congress comes back into session
in January. "The whole process
is very time-consuming," said one
graduate student who has been
active in lobbying efforts. "It
severely interferes with our nor
mal studies."
But students anticipate contin
ued activism as long as there is
a threat of forced return to their
homeland. "Our goal is to fight
to get protection of our personal
safety. It is a life-and-death mat
ter in which we have no choice
but to fight," said one.
Bush's plan has not allayed the
deep-rooted anxiety felt by Chi
nese students at Stanford. "The
gun pointed to our head is still
there," said one Chinese student
last night. "Until we get some
thing concrete, we live in fear."

'The gun pointed to
our head is still there.
Until we get some
thing concrete, we
live in fear.'

The lobbying effort in Washing
ton was led by the Independent
Federation of Chinese Students
and Scholars, the newly founded
union of Chinese students in the
United States. The president of
the federation, Liu Yongchuan, is
a Stanford sociology graduate stu
dent.
Liu and other members of the
federation attempted to deliver a
letter to Bush on Wednesday but
were rebuffed by White House
guards and told to leave their mes
sage in the Executive Office
Building.
Yesterday, following a call from
the White House, five leaders of
the federation, including Liu, had
a meeting with advisers to the
president. They were told that

Bush opposed the bill as an in
stance of Congress attempting to
"micromanage" foreign policy,
and that the administration
wanted to save face for the Chi
nese leadership if at all possible,
according to accounts circulated
on China Net, a nationwide com
puter network among Chinese
students.
Bush echoed this argument in
his "memorandum of disap
proval" of the Pelosi bill. "Such
legislation puts America in a
straightjacket and can render us
incapable of responding to chang
ing circumstances," Bush said.
Bush earlier criticized the
Pelosi bill, claiming it was
unneeded because he already
agreed to extend student visas in
the aftermath of the government's
bloody crackdown on protesters
in Tianenmen Square in June.
Congressional sponsors of the
Pelosi measure, however, said
that Bush's gesture did not go far
enough and that many of the
40,000 Chinese students now
studying in the United States had
not taken advantage of it.
In most cases, visas for visiting

foreign students are issued for two
years. The bill Bush vetoed would
extend the Chinese students' visas
for four more years and then give
them a chance at applying for per
manent residency.
"Chinese and other foreign
visitors should know that this is
not an expedient or temporary ac
tion, but one reflecting fundamen
tal American humanitarian
values," he said.
Bush said he was re
emphasizing "my commitment —
as I have told Chinese students
in America, and as I have told
Congress — to never allow any
action that would force the return
of Chinese students if their lives
or liberty are at risk."
The president said he was re
jecting the legislation with a
"pocket" veto, a procedural device
available when Congress is in
recess which has the same impact
as a regular veto.
Bush also announced that he
was expanding a program for of
fering political asylum to Chinese
visitors who opposed that nation's
policy of forced sterilization or
abortion.

40,000 Chinese students now
studying in the United States had
not taken advantage of it.
In most cases, visas for visiting

foreign students are issued for two
years. The bill Bush vetoed would
extend the Chinese students' visas
for four more years and then give
them a chance at applying for per
manent residency.
"Chinese and other foreign
visitors should know that this is
not an expedient or temporary ac
tion, but one reflecting fundamen
tal American humanitarian
values," he said.
Bush said he was re
emphasizing "my commitment —
as I have told Chinese students
in America, and as I have told
Congress — to never allow any
action that would force the return
of Chinese students if their lives
or liberty are at risk."
The president said he was re
jecting the legislation with a
"pocket" veto, a procedural device
available when Congress is in
recess which has the same impact
as a regular veto.
Bush also announced that he
was expanding a program for of
fering political asylum to Chinese
visitors who opposed that nation's
policy of forced sterilization or
abortion.
Despite intensive lobbying from Chinese students
around the nation, including many at Stanford,
President Bush yesterday announced he was vetoing
a bill to allow Chinese students to stay in the United
States after their visas expire.
Calling the bill an infringement on his presidential
authority, Bush said in a statement that the measure
was unneeded in light of administrative steps he
had taken to accomplish the same ends.
In a memorandum released yesterday, Bush called
on the Attorney General to provide protections to
Chinese students, including an irrevocable waiver
of the two-year home-country return requirement,
continued lawful immigration status, authorization
for employment, and notice of expiration of non
immigrant status rather than institution of depor
tation procedures.
Bush claims his four-part memorandum is at least
equivalent to Rep. Nancy Pelosi's bill, if not more
comprehensive.
However, a congressional sponsor of the legisla
tion, Rep. Bruce Morrison, accused Bush of yielding
to pressure from the Beijing government, which had
strongly opposed the bill.
"I'm shocked that the president would kowtow in
this way to the demands of the Chinese communist
government, especially when that government was
threatening Chinese students here in the United
States and telling them that the United States was
not going to protect them," said Morrison, chair of
a House judiciary subcommittee on immigration.
Chinese students at Stanford received the news
of the veto late Thursday afternoon with confusion.
"I am very disappointed and very frustrated," said
one graduate student, who requested anonymity.
Students are puzzled by Bush's insistence on going
ahead with the veto despite the wide support enjoyed
by the bill, which encountered no opposition in
Congress. The veto came on the heels of a letter
in support of the bill signed by 71 senators. The
bill was sponsored by Pelosi.
"If this bill represents the opinions of most Amer
icans," queried Yin Hezhu, president of the Asso
ciation of Chinese Students and Scholars at Stanford,
"why does Bush have to veto it?"
Despite Bush's claims about the merits of his
memorandum, students are not ready to abandon
the Pelosi bill.
"We wanted the Pelosi bill, we still want it, and
we regret that Bush vetoed it," a student here said.
The seeming inconsistency between State Depart
ment opposition to the Pelosi bill on the grounds
that it would be offensive to the Chinese government
and Bush's claim that his alternative is more com
prehensive than Pelosi's plan leads students here
to wonder what the president's real motives are.
"I don't think it's very logical," said one student.
"If he had really intended to help Chinese students,
he would have introduced something like [the Pelosi
bill] a half year ago, rather than
at the last minute."
There are fears that an admin
istrative action will not provide
the same protection as would a
law. "We prefer law to regula
tion," a student said at the Chi
nese scholars' association meeting
Thursday night. "It's more se
cure."
The question that remains un
answered is how Bush's memoran
dum will be implemented. John
Pearson, director of the Interna
tional Center, said he is waiting
to see "how [Bush's proposal] will
be translated into administrative
action."
Chinese students at Stanford
share Pearson's caution. There is
a general hesitancy to comment
on the memorandum until it has
been painstakingly examined.
Right now we are waiting to see
what kind of package the State
Department comes up with," said
one Stanford graduate student.

"I really feel that we need to
talk to lawyers before anything
can be said," explained another
graduate student.
One particular concern is
whether or not the return waiver
is something the students have to
opt for on an individual basis,
rather than the blanket exemp
tion of the Pelosi bill.
"Those who want it waived are
hesitant to stick out their necks
and say 'I want a waiver,' " said
Douglas Pan, a graduate student
in electrical engineering. The fear
is that by the act of requesting a
waiver they will be identified by
the government as dissidents in
opposition to communist policies.
Students at Stanford do not
know what is next for the Pelosi
bill. They point out that there are
more actors involved in mustering
support for an override of the veto
than just the students, and they
do not know how members of Con
gress will react.
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said in a statement, "I oppose the
veto and I hope Congress will
override it. The president should
have stood up for the courageous

Chinese students, instead of
bowing to the cruel Chinese
regime."
"We will stand with Congress,"
said a student here, "and we hope
the administration will help us."
Although no one is suggesting
giving up the struggle, students
do not look forward to the process
of reintroducing the bill when
Congress comes back into session
in January. "The whole process
is very time-consuming," said one
graduate student who has been
active in lobbying efforts. "It
severely interferes with our nor
mal studies."
But students anticipate contin
ued activism as long as there is
a threat of forced return to their
homeland. "Our goal is to fight
to get protection of our personal
safety. It is a life-and-death mat
ter in which we have no choice
but to fight," said one.
Bush's plan has not allayed the
deep-rooted anxiety felt by Chi
nese students at Stanford. "The
gun pointed to our head is still
there," said one Chinese student
last night. "Until we get some
thing concrete, we live in fear."

'The gun pointed to
our head is still there.
Until we get some

The lobbying effort in Washing
ton was led by the Independent
Federation of Chinese Students
and Scholars, the newly founded
union of Chinese students in the
United States. The president of
the federation, Liu Yongchuan, is
a Stanford sociology graduate stu
dent.
Liu and other members of the
federation attempted to deliver a
letter to Bush on Wednesday but
were rebuffed by White House
guards and told to leave their mes
sage in the Executive Office
Building.
Yesterday, following a call from
the White House, five leaders of
the federation, including Liu, had
a meeting with advisers to the
president. They were told that

Bush opposed the bill as an in
stance of Congress attempting to
"micromanage" foreign policy,
and that the administration
wanted to save face for the Chi
nese leadership if at all possible,
according to accounts circulated
on China Net, a nationwide com
puter network among Chinese
students.
Bush echoed this argument in
his "memorandum of disap
proval" of the Pelosi bill. "Such
legislation puts America in a
straightjacket and can render us
incapable of responding to chang
ing circumstances," Bush said.
Bush earlier criticized the
Pelosi bill, claiming it was
unneeded because he already
agreed to extend student visas in
the aftermath of the government's
bloody crackdown on protesters
in Tianenmen Square in June.
Congressional sponsors of the
Pelosi measure, however, said
that Bush's gesture did not go far
enough and that many of the
40,000 Chinese students now

sage in the Executive Office
Building.
Yesterday, following a call from
the White House, five leaders of
the federation, including Liu, had
a meeting with advisers to the
president. They were told that

Bush opposed the bill as an in
stance of Congress attempting to
"micromanage" foreign policy,
and that the administration
wanted to save face for the Chi
nese leadership if at all possible,
according to accounts circulated
on China Net, a nationwide com
puter network among Chinese
students.
Bush echoed this argument in
his "memorandum of disap
proval" of the Pelosi bill. "Such
legislation puts America in a
straightjacket and can render us
incapable of responding to chang
ing circumstances," Bush said.
Bush earlier criticized the
Pelosi bill, claiming it was
unneeded because he already
agreed to extend student visas in
the aftermath of the government's
bloody crackdown on protesters
in Tianenmen Square in June.
Congressional sponsors of the
Pelosi measure, however, said
that Bush's gesture did not go far
enough and that many of the
40,000 Chinese students now
studying in the United States had
not taken advantage of it.
In most cases, visas for visiting

foreign students are issued for two
years. The bill Bush vetoed would
extend the Chinese students' visas
for four more years and then give
them a chance at applying for per
manent residency.
"Chinese and other foreign
visitors should know that this is
not an expedient or temporary ac
tion, but one reflecting fundamen
tal American humanitarian
values," he said.
Bush said he was re
emphasizing "my commitment —
as I have told Chinese students
in America, and as I have told
Congress — to never allow any
action that would force the return
of Chinese students if their lives
or liberty are at risk."
The president said he was re
jecting the legislation with a
"pocket" veto, a procedural device
available when Congress is in
recess which has the same impact
as a regular veto.
Bush also announced that he
was expanding a program for of
fering political asylum to Chinese
visitors who opposed that nation's
policy of forced sterilization or
abortion.
