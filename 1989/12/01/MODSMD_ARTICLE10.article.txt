More flashings reported
Police now believe more than one per
petrator may be involved in the three latest
indecent exposures on campus, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said the descriptions of two of
the perpetrators differed and noted that one
might be a "copycat" crime.
In one of the incidents, a man exposed
himself while riding his bicycle by Building
300 at 12:45 p.m. yesterday, Niemeyer said.
Approximately five minutes later, a man
fitting the same description exposed himself
near Branner Hall, once again while riding
his bicycle.
Niemeyer described the flasher as a white
male about five feet six inches tall with
light brown or blond hair and a beard, fitting
the same description as the perpetrator of
several other exposures over the past few
weeks.
Another exposure was reported on a bike
path near Stanford Avenue. However, ac
cording to witnesses, this flasher did not
have a beard and was dressed differently
than the man in the other incidents,
Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer said in spite of the different
descriptions of the flashers, police can not
be totally certain that they are not the same
person.

Escort serv ice extends hours
In an effort to respond to the recent in
crease in cases of sexual assaults of women
on campus, the Council of Presidents and
the directors of Stanford United for Rape
Elimination have decided to extend the hours
for SURE escort services during Dead Week
and Finals Week.
Normally SURE only operates until mid
night and does not provide any services dur
ing Finals Week. However, the COP and
the SURE directors believe the situation on
campus warrants increased services during

the next two weeks.
SURE's hours for Dead and Finals Weeks
will coordinate with the closing of Green
and Meyer Libraries. Starting Monday, Dec.
4, and continuing until Wednesday, Dec. 13,
the hours will be from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. The
only exceptions will be on Friday and Sat
urday, Dec. 8 and 9, when the hours will
be 7 p.m. to midnight. The final night of
service will be Thursday, Dec. 14. That
night, escort services will end at midnight,
when the library closes.
Those who need an escort should call 725-
SURE.
Earthquake memories sought
The Stanford University Archives is gath
ering recollections of the Oct. 17 Loma
Prieta earthquake from members of the
Stanford community.
Individuals are invited to help document
this period of University history by sending
written or taped recollections and photo
graphs, according to Maggie Kimball, acting
University archivist. Tapes should be 60-
minute cassettes.
"These recollections will help future
generations understand what happened at
Stanford and what individuals experienced,"
she said.
The University Archives has many copies
of letters that students wrote home following
the 1906 San Francisco quake. These letters
and other accounts "fill in gaps in the news
coverage and give a much more personal
account of what people experienced at Stan
ford," she said.
Recollections about the 1989 quake will
be cataloged, entered into the online catalog
Socrates and made available to researchers,
Kimball said.
Materials will not circulate but will be
available for use in the department's reading
room.
Recollections may be sent to Kimball at
the University Archives, Green Library, mail
code 6004.

Panel to discuss student ethics
University Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole will lead a panel discussion on student
ethical standards today at noon in Kresge.
Others on the panel include Physics Prof.
Alexander Fetter, Education Prof. Nel Nod
dings and third-year law student Juan
Sabateur.
The panelists will discuss the question of
whether the consequences for misconduct
should be the same for undergraduates and
graduates, Cole said. She cited a hypothetical
example of two cases of plagiarism, one in
volving a freshman and one involving a doc
toral student about to become a professional.
Currently, she said, only the Medical
School takes students' preprofessional status
into account when deciding judicial cases,
but Cole and Dean of Graduate Studies
Elizabeth Traugott are preparing a presen
tation for the Committee on Graduate
Studies on the question of whether punish
ments should be stricter for graduate stu
dents.
