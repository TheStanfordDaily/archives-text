## Rebel Filipino troops attack palace 
### 
MANILA, Philippines (AP) â€” Rebel
pilots bombed the presidential palace
compound this morning after mutineers
seized the air force headquarters and
two broadcast stations in a bid to over
throw President Corazon Aquino.
Mrs. Aquino vowed to smash the
"shameless and naked attempt" to drive
her from power, but provincial Gov.
Rudolfo Aguinaldo said the military was
committed to ousting her and rebels
were moving artillery and armor from
his region into the capital.
The coup attempt, which has left at
least 10 dead and 10 wounded, was the
most serious since a civilian-military
uprising swept Mrs. Aquino to power
in February 1986 and forced the late
President Ferdinand E. Marcos into
exile.
The U.S. military increased security
at its six military bases here. But the
bases, containing 40,000 troops, mili
tary dependents and Defense Depart

ment civilians, are more than 50 miles
from Manila and somewhat removed
from the action. Up to 100,000 other
U.S. civilians also are in the Philippines.
A rebel spokesman, who refused to
give his name, said on radio station
DZXL that the mutineers will soon "en
joy the fruits of our hardships.
"Let's pray together for the enlight
enment of those people pretending to be
leaders like Cory ... and their
henchmen," he said.
Later, a military helicopter dropped
a bomb on the rebel-held government
television station. Rebel aviators
responded by dropping three bombs
from helicopters on Camp Crame, head
quarters of the Philippine Constabulary,
and one at Camp Aguinaldo, headquar
ters of the armed forces general staff.
Another bomb damaged the transmit
ter of RPN-Television, knocking out the
only Manila television station still on
the air today. The government had been

using the station to broadcast demands
for the rebels to surrender.
The military chief of staff, Gen
Renato de Villa, conceded that the rebels
seized Villamor Air Base, headquarters
of the Philippine air force; the govern
ment broadcast center; a private TV sta
tion; and parts of Ninoy Aquino Inter
national Airport. The airport was closed
to all flights.
Who was leading the mutiny was un
clear. Rebel soldiers would not say. They
were believed loyal to renegade Lt. Col.
Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan, who led
an August 1987 coup attempt in which
at least 53 people were killed.
Besides dissatisfaction within the mil
itary, public discontent with the Aquino
government has been growing because
of rising prices, a critical shortage of
electricity in Manila, allegations of cor
ruption and deterioration of the city's
transport system.
