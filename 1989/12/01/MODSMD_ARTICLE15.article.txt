BAD HOMBURG, West Germany
(AP) — The terrorist Red Army Faction,
dormant for three years, killed West
Germany's most powerful banker yes
terday by blowing apart his armored
Mercedes with a light-sensitive bomb
on a bicycle.
Alfred Herrhausen was chairman of
Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest,
and one of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
chief economic advisers.
Police said the bicycle-bomb appar
ently was placed on a street of this spa
town outside Frankfurt, where the 59-
year-old banker lived, and detonated by
a sophisticated light-beam device as he
drove by on his way to work.
They said it was the first time ter
rorists used such a detonator in West
Germany.
Federal criminal police offered a
reward of up to $2.2 million, one of the
largest here ever.
Police with helicopters were searching
for two men seen leaving the area. A
stolen white Lancia believed to have

been used in the getaway was found
abandoned in a Frankfurt suburb.
"For a long time, the Deutsche Bank
and Herrhausen in particular have been
targeted by the Red Army Faction," said
Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for
the chief federal prosecutor's office. He
said the ultraleftists accuse Deutsche
Bank of financing a worldwide
"military-industrial" complex.
The explosion, heard three miles
away, turned Herrhausen's armored
limousine into a heap of twisted metal
and blew out windows in buildings.
His driver, Jakob Nix, was seriously
injured, but police said his condition
was not critical. Security agents follow
ing in another car were unhurt.
A letter found at the scene claimed
responsibility on behalf of the Red Army
Faction, West Germany's deadliest ter
rorist group, of which little had been
heard since 1986.
Foerster said the letter "was not typ
ical" of Red Army Faction claims be
cause it did not explain motives. After

previous attacks, the terrorist group left
lengthy statements giving detailed
reasons for the actions.
Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble,
who is in charge of police and security
issues, said protection for prominent fig
ures was stepped up after a Red Army
Faction hunger strike that ended last
April.
During the fast, one imprisoned ter
rorist called for increasing activities
"with al 1 means."
Chancellor Kohl, his eyes filled with
tears and his voice breaking, condemned
the "cowardly and brutal murder" of
his personal friend.
In Washington, State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said,
"We deplore this terrorist act ... and
stand ready to assist in any way that
we can."
Herrhausen, the best-known figure
in West German business, often advised
Kohl and frequently accompanied him
on trips abroad.
