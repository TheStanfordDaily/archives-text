PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP)
— The government said yesterday
it will tear down the fences on its
-bordar with Austria and lift vir
tually all restrictions on travel to
the West.
The Communist Party held its
first talks with the opposition,
and members of Parliament pro
posed the repeal of tough laws
used to imprison and fine dissent
ers.
The party also said it would
announce a new program to in
clude "an objective revision" of
its attitude toward the "Prague
Spring" reform movement of 1968
and the Soviet-led invasion that
crushed it.
Spokesman Josef Hora said the
new policies might allow for read
mission to the party of half a
million people expelled after the
invasion. They include Alexander
Dubcek, who was Communist
Party chief and led the reforms.
Hora said two Politburo mem
bers met for the first time with
the opposition Civic Forum group
and students, who led 11 days of
mass protest that toppled the old

party leadership.
He said the meeting occurred
because "we are just one of the
political parties in this country,
and we have to find our place."
Civic Forum previously had met
only with Premier Ladislav
Adamec and other government of
ficials.
State radio began broadcasting
twice-daily programs about Civic
Forum activities, and also fea
tured music by singers who had
been banned for years.
Government spokesman Marcel
Jansen said the Interior Ministry
would begin the "removal of tech
nical equipment" on the frontier
with neutral Austria, which
bristles with barbed wire,
watchtowers and trip wires.
He did not say whether similar
action would be taken on the long,
fortified border with West Ger
many.
Hungary started tearing down
its border barriers with Austria
in May, and tens of thousands of
East Germans fled across the
frontier to the West before the
East German government

abolished travel restrictions.
The Interior Ministry said that
starting Monday, citizens will be
allowed to use their passports for
unrestricted travel to the West
and all East bloc countries except
the Soviet Union and Poland, the
state news agency CTK reported.
The only remaining formality
will be completion of a simple
"statistical card," to be filled out
as people leave the country, CTK
said.
The government had announced
Nov. 14 that its citizens would be
able to go to the West and Yugos
lavia, a popular vacation spot, be
ginning Jan. 1 without waiting 30
days for an exit visa.
CTK said six political prisoners
were released and that President
Gustav Husak granted amnesty
to Stanislav Devaty, a former
spokesman for the Charter 77
human rights group who went un
derground weeks ago, and another
activist.
State radio said Marxism-
Leninism was being abolished as
a compulsory subject at univer
sities.
