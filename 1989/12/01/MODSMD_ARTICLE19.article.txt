## No women allowed 
### 
The alpha delta phi
fraternity is breaking down
one more sexist barrier at
Stanford by admitting women for
the first time.
Unfortunately, according to As
st. Dean of Residential Affairs
Diana Conklin, University policy
states that groups that are "sub
jectively selective" cannot house
both men and women â€” while
groups such as fraternities that
have single-sex housing can be sub
jectively selective. Thus, the Alpha
Delts did not have a chance to
prove that a co-ed housed frater
nity could work.
This policy seems paradoxical for
a University that is trying dis
courage sexism. Even if fraternities
or sororities want to hold rush for
both sexes, the University will not
let them.
Who can imagine rules in the
21st century which state that
women are not allowed in one

group or another? It would sound
kind of like a third graders' neigh
borhood tree house with a sign out
front pronouncing "No girls al
lowed!"
Admitting women does not
hinder the fraternal process. The
men and women of Alpha Delta
Phi and also Alpha Sig House,
which lost its national fraternal
charter when they elected a woman
president and sent her to the na
tional convention, are still properly
initiated into the "brotherhood."
Alpha Delts has just changed the
words to a few of their songs.
If fraternities want to get off the
defensive and re-establish a strong
position on this campus, they
should consider leading the way
toward a more progressive future
where men and women can both
enjoy the bonds of friendship and
loyalty that fraternities develop.
And the University should support
this movement.
