# Finally full-time
## 
### 
THE FRUITS OF a long,
hard-fought struggle are fi
nally going to be seen by
Stanford's Chicano/Latino commu
nity.
Stanford alumna Frances
Morales has been selected as the
University's first full-time director
of El Centro Chicano, and many
members of the community are ec
static about the possibilities this
opens up for the development of
El Centro Chicano and for the
Stanford community as a whole.
The selection process for the new
dean was democratic; the selection
committee was comprised of stu
dents, faculty and staff. Hopefully
this process will prove to be effec
tive — it is important that the
dean fully supports the students
apd works toward understanding
and meeting their needs.

Students have already voiced
that they felt included in the se
lection process and are happy with
the choice of Morales. This op
timism is a nice change from the
frustration that many Chi
cano/Latino students felt last year
— along with the many other stu
dents of color.
Morales has already expressed
her enthusiasm in working to ex
pand El Centro Chicano into a sec
ond home for Chicano/Latino stu
dents while at the same time
making it a source of education
for the community as a whole.
These are the kind of positive
changes that many students have
been working to achieve at Stan
ford, and Morales appears to be
the most promising candidate for
the job.
