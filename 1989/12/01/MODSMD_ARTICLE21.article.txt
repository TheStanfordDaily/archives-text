Staff committee not partner to Affirmative Action Council

AFTER BEING QUOTED in an
article in the Nov. 21 Daily
about the recently released Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues
Staff Subcommittee final Report, I
would like to elaborate on the thoughts
I shared during the interview.
First, I agree with the Stanford
American Indian Organization's con
cern about the responses of individuals
in their community not being included
in the report.
I want to express my ambivalence
that the responses of the other com
munities of color were reported at all
because the responses of the African-
American community were presented as
if the community was "the bad guy" at
Stanford.
I believe the message to the Univer
sity would have been the same if the
responses of the communities of color
had been averaged and not delineated.
Second, accepting the fact that the
responses of the respective communi
ties were reported, I think it

noteworthy that 100 percent of the
African-American executive, administra
tive and professional staff responded
that Stanford . . should do more to
recruit and promote minority staff to
senior management positions."
No other question is reported to
have earned such unanimity among the
tables in the report. That being the
case, whatever the University does, it
should focus its efforts on senior man
agement positions.
Third, I note that several recommen
dations involve participation by the
Affirmative Action Council, of which I
am a member. Considering the fact
that the Affirmative Action Council
has been referred to as a partner, I
think it would have been appropriate
for the authors of the report to have
briefed their partner on what was
being proposed.
Also, I feel that if such a briefing
had occurred, the objection would
surely have surfaced regarding the
exclusion of data on Native Americans.

Fourth, the role of the Affirmative
Action Council in human resources
matters in general is being seriously
debated within and without.
Where it has been aggressive, the
council has been occasionally con
demned for "micromanagement."
Where it has not been aggressive, it
has been occasionally condemned for
not being accountable. This dilemma
must be resolved or the council should
fold its tent.
Fifth, I said in the interview that
the report speaks of "managing diversi
ty." The University should dismiss the
entire concept and focus instead on
achieving "diversified management" —
if it has the desire and the will — at
senior levels, as observed above.
Sixth, Recommendation 7 refers to
evaluating senior managers on multi
cultural and associated matters. This
attention is also misplaced and, most of
all, comes too late in the process.
Individuals should not be appointed
to or promoted in senior management.

positions unless they have already
demonstrated a successful track record
in such matters. There are many
senior managers at Stanford who have
hired or promoted a person of color
into an exempt position. "Keep us
forever in the path, we pray."
Lastly, on Recommendation 8 per
taining to a system for resolving dis
putes in the workplace, I believe the
key office and policy here is Employee
Relations and the grievance procedure.
This office, in my opinion, has been
employing egregious practices.
That being the case, this office and
policy are in desperate need of investi
gation and reformation. In the interim,
the University would be well served to
defer filling the manager position for
that office until such an investigation
has occurred. It would be better for
the employees and certainly better for
the University.
