# SCAAN is a 'political' group and supports the People's Platform
## 
### 
Who is being political? Several mem
bers of Students First wrote in Tues
day's Daily that they wanted to delay
funding for the Stanford Central Amer
ican Action Network (SCAAN) and the
Stanford Democratic Socialists (DSA)
because they "were not willing to
sacrifice (their) responsiblities of al
locating student funds for the sake of
expediency."
And those presumably apolitical re
sponsibilities included attempting to
single out two of the University's most

active groups for a special financial
audit.
As treasurer of SCAAN I would just
like to set the record straight on our
role in the Stanford community and
our support for the strong, steady and
honest work of the People's Platform.
SCAAN has received funding from
the ASSU for the last nine years,
which makes us one of the oldesst
continuously operating social activist
groups on campus.
In those nine years, I believe that
SCAAN has aquired a national reputa
tion as one of the most hard-working
and consistent groups involved in
educating the United States about Cen
tral America.
We have published a book and tran
scripts of two international symposin.
We sponsor an average of five speakers
every quarter. Film series, information

tables, letter writing campaigns â€” you
name it, SCAAN has been there, work
ing to educate and enrich the Stanford
community.
Because of our visible and effective
work, because of our work on the be
half of Stanford, the ASSU has sup
ported us in our funding requests.
That means we have been receiving
ASSU support since long before the
People's Platform was pushing a sup
posedly "ideological" agenda.
I would suggest that Students First
do a little introspection and ask them
selves about their own political
agendas. Neither SCAAN nor the
People's Platform deny that they are
"political." Just the opposite: we are
each clear and honest about our
priorities.
The People's Platform says student

services are important, and to that end
they started "Beat the Bookstore" and
the Airport Shuttle Service. They take
a stand for multicultural education and
at the same time are there for campus
earthquake relief.
SCAAN likewise is clear on what we
consider important: we don't advertise
to the ASSU that we'll keep Stanford
calm and pretty as a golf course. We
propose in our budget requests to
make Stanford a challenging, searching
and responsible community, a commu
nity well aware of its connection with
the world.
Because we deliver, and not because
of any hidden agenda, we receive the
support of the ASSU and the People's
Platform.
