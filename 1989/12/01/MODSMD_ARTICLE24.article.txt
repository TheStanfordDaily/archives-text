## Big Game drinking blame 
### 
BIG GAME is nearly impossible to
describe to anyone that doesn't at
tend. Trying to explain the spec
tacle to my family, the closest I could
get was, "Well, it's sort of like an English
soccer game," which isn't even close.
What can be said about a game with
27 arrests? Some of the arrests were
almost, but not quite, worth the price of
admission — especially the one ol the
guy who managed to flip off the entire
student section despite being handcuffed.
Of course, it can't compete with the
fight last year between the Tree and UC-
Berkeley mascat Oski. The sight ol the
two clumsy mascots beating on each other
(a tree attacking a giant teddy bear?) was
surreal.
However, a limit has to be set on how
weird a good time can get. Stanford Sta
dium is the only one in the Pacific 10
Conference that still allows beer to be
brought into the
occurs Tor hours before- kickoff.
That the administration is questioning
this policy in light of Big Game '89 is
understandable. The, I {Diversity must be
careful not to overreact, however, and
miss the potential contradictions in any
policy change.
The University is right to be concerned.
Students come to games drunk and then
continue to drink. University President
Donald Kennedy put it aptly Nov. 21
when he told The Daily that "a lot of
people weren't enjoying I Big Game] be
cause they were no longer conscious."
A 79-year-old man received minor in
juries when he was hit by a drunk driver
after the game and Stanford police offi
cers were hit in their heads by flying

objects during the game.
Clearly, the University has a duty to
protect residents and guests from ir
responsible students.
While some students objected to the
wearing of riot gear by police, the actions
of the police should be commended. I'm
sure no officer looks forward to working
Big Game, but considering the abuse they
received the police showed remarkable
restraint.
In Seattle on the same day, according
to the University of Washington's daily
newspaper, students that raced onto the
field to tear down the goalposts after a
victory were maced by police with official
university orders to mace any student
that came onto the field. Imagine the
violence that would have erupted had
Stanford police used mace to control
rowdy students.
ior. But it accepts that reality.
Personally, it won't bother me if the
administration bans alcohol in the sta
dium in the future. Such a decision-, how
ever, will also require more responsibility
on the part of the University, for it shares
much of the blame for the problems of
Nov. 18.
By postponing kickoff to 3:30 p.m. in
order to accomodate television and who
knows how much money, the University
made a potentially bad situation even
more volatile.
As my friend Tim says, "What do you
expect students to do with those extra
hours except to tailgate?" Pre-game
drinking is the source of the problems
and the University simply extended the

happy hour.
Meanwhile, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger neatly sidestepped the issue of
University responsibility, saying that
Stanford needs to be prepared for late
starts in the future.
Geiger should pay less attention to po
tential television revenue and more at
tention to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Nierrleyer, who pointed out that the Notre
Dame game, which also drew a sell-out
crowd and began two and one-half hours
earlier than Big Game, witnessed far
fewer problems.
If the administration bans alcohol con
sumption at athletic events, then they
also must refute to allow BudvMwifrr ad
vertisements to appear on pocket athletic'
schedules or Miller Beer logos to appear
on items such as the painters' caps given
away at last year's basketball games.
While displaying these ads does not
cause students to drink, they reveal a
greater University concern for revenue
than for student drinking. Continuing to
allow the ads would seriously undermine
any attempt to ban alcohol at future ath
letic events.
The University is right to be concerned
about alcohol abuse, but it should also
worry about its own role in facilitating
such behavior.

to the University of Washington's daily
newspaper, students that raced onto the
field to tear down the goalposts after a
victory were maced by police with official
university orders to mace any student
that came onto the field. Imagine the
violence that would have erupted had
Stanford police used mace to control
rowdy students.
ior. But it accepts that reality.
Personally, it won't bother me if the
administration bans alcohol in the sta
dium in the future. Such a decision-, how
ever, will also require more responsibility
on the part of the University, for it shares
much of the blame for the problems of
Nov. 18.
By postponing kickoff to 3:30 p.m. in
order to accomodate television and who
knows how much money, the University
made a potentially bad situation even
more volatile.
As my friend Tim says, "What do you
expect students to do with those extra
hours except to tailgate?" Pre-game
drinking is the source of the problems
and the University simply extended the

happy hour.
Meanwhile, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger neatly sidestepped the issue of
University responsibility, saying that
Stanford needs to be prepared for late
starts in the future.
Geiger should pay less attention to po
tential television revenue and more at
tention to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Nierrleyer, who pointed out that the Notre
Dame game, which also drew a sell-out
crowd and began two and one-half hours
earlier than Big Game, witnessed far
fewer problems.
If the administration bans alcohol con
sumption at athletic events, then they
also must refute to allow BudvMwifrr ad
vertisements to appear on pocket athletic'
schedules or Miller Beer logos to appear
on items such as the painters' caps given
away at last year's basketball games.
While displaying these ads does not
cause students to drink, they reveal a
greater University concern for revenue
than for student drinking. Continuing to
allow the ads would seriously undermine
any attempt to ban alcohol at future ath
letic events.
The University is right to be concerned
about alcohol abuse, but it should also
worry about its own role in facilitating
such behavior.
