## Renovation of Church windows beginning 
### Patty Kao 
Since 1903, the exquisite glass
depictions of the life of Christ
have withstood the effects of
weather, earthquakes and struc
tural fatigue. But now Memorial
Church's large windows require
immediate attention to avoid the
risk of irreparable damage.
Not only has the glass buckled
and cracked in many instances,
but even the lead framework is
exceptionally corroded upon close
inspection. "Sometimes you can't
even tell how bad it is until you
take the window down and start
working on it, " commented Halle
Fassett, one of the two artisans
working on a University project
to restore the windows.
Fassett, who had only worked
with stained glass before this proj
ect, assists John Foster, one of
the few artisans today who has
experience in multi-layering. Par
tially retired, Foster began work
ing with multi-layering in the
1930s as an apprentice in San
Francisco. Coincidentally enough,
he helped install some of the sup
port work of the larger windows
when Memorial Church was built.
The windows were designed and
cut by Frederick Lamb, who won
the commission from Jane Stan
ford in November, 1899. Using
the multi-layering technique de
veloped by Tiffany, Lamb and his
assistants worked on the windows
in their New York studio for three
years.
Unlike the painting of glass, the
actual "stained glass" process that
originated in Europe, multi
layering is strictly an American
technique. This elaborate method
of layering differently colored and
differently patterned pieces
creates a shading and depth un
achievable by single-layer stained
glass. Both the difficulty of the
construction of this type of win
dow and the sophistication of its
final effect are what makes multi
layering so unique. "Nobody does
it nowadays. I don't think they
know how to do it!" Fassett noted.
The process of restoring the
windows is also very complicated.
The window is first completely

Because each win
dow costs $100,000
to restore, it could
take anywhere from
10 to 20 years to com
plete all the windows.

taped to prevent it from falling
apart when it is removed from
the frame. After a pattern of the
design is made, each piece of glass
is carefully numbered, cleaned
and repaired in the studio.
The hardest part is keeping
careful track of the pieces so that
they may be fitted together prop
erly afterwards and releaded. Ex
tra support is provided by hidden
thin brass rods which help relieve
some of the pressure caused by
the massive weight of each win
dow.
A window of Lexan is fitted out
side each completed glass window
for even more support and protec
tion. Originally developed by the
space program as a high-grade
plastic, it is remarkably clear and
impermeable to weather, dust and
vandals. The Lexan provides
much more effective and subtle
protection than the unsightly pig
wire mesh presently used. Fassett
added, "It really enhances it. It
allows a lot more light to come
into the church."
The results of the restoration
may be seen in the two finished
windows of the right transept of
Memorial Church.
However, the windows now face
a mtyor problem funding. Though
Foster and Fassett could restore
at least one complete window and
half of another every year, the
fiscal situation has allowed only
two windows to be completed
since the project was initiated four
years ago. Because each window
costs $100,000 to restore, it could
take anywhere from 10 to 20 years
to complete all the windows de
pending on the budget.
Valerie Veronin, the assistant
provost of the project who works

through Stanford's planned main
tenance program, commented,
"Yes, the windows need immedi
ate attention, but so do a lot of
other things."
Structural damage to the
church itself, caused by the Oct.
17 earthquake, has temporarily
halted the window restoration.
Once the University decides on a
definite plan of action to repair
the church, the two projects will
be worked on simultaneously.
Where Stanford will get adequate

funding, when the church's plan
will be formulated and what effect
the church reparation will have
on the speed of window restora
tion is still unknown. "It's all up
in the air right now," Fassett said.
No matter how long the resto
ration takes, the importance of
preserving the beautiful windows
is obvious. Memorial Church is
possibly the most glorious site on
the Stanford campus and
definitely a vital part of Stanford's
history.

The University restoration project has completed two of the 21
large windows of Memorial Church, one of which is shown above.
