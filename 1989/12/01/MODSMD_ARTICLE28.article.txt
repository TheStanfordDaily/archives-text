# Ombudsperson is problem helper

The University Ombudsper
son. Ombudsperson? It sounds
like a tongue twister gone
wrong, but it is actually an of
fice at Stanford that is helpful
for just about any kind of prob
lem you may face.
The position was established
in 1970 and is now held by the
University's fifth Ombudsper
son, Leah Kaplan.
Kaplan says her goal as Om
budsperson is to "direct people
to what they need. We want
them to feel free to come in.
Confidence is absolutely as
sured." She stresses that the
Ombudsperson is independent
of other organizations and that
no one else has access to their
records. The office is funded
by the University through the
President's Office.
The Ombudsperson's aims
can be summed up through the
original charge of 1973: "The
Ombudsman's task is to protect
the interests and rights of
members of the Stanford com
munity from injustices or
abuses of discretion. . . . The
Ombudsman exists to receive,
examine and channel the com
plaints and grievances of mem
bers of the Stanford
community, and to secure ex
peditious and impartial
redress."
"If someone isn't sure how
to deal with a problem and does
not wish to take any action,
that is very much permitted.
We like to talk to them and let
them know what their options
are," Kaplan said. The Om
budsperson attempts to give a
person all the information they
need. As an independent office
from the rest of the University,
the Ombudsperson will then
advise the person on whom to

approach or approach people on
the individual's behalf.
Kaplan, who has held the po
sition for five years, is aided
by Special Assistant John
Goheen, a former Ombudsper
son, and Assistant Ombudsper
son Carmen Joves. Kaplan has
been associated with the Uni
versity for over 30 years as a
member of the Counseling and
Health Services at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center. She still
spends 40 percent of her time
as director of the HELP center.
The Ombudsperon's office Is
usually located in Building 260-
261 in the Main Quad, but has
temporarily been relocated to
Room 209 of Cowell due to the
earthquake.
"Although possessing no
decision-making authority, the
Ombudsperson has wide
powers of inquiry," Kaplan
said. For example, students can
approach the Ombudsperson if
they have any questions re
garding Honor Code violations,
but "once the complaint is


Leah Kaplan
made, it is out of our hands." The
matter is then dealt with by Jud
icial Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
Another positive aspect of the
office is that it sometimes stops
people from rushing to court.
"There seems to be an increase
of people turning to grievance pro
cedures or litigation. When we can
offer them alternatives and
choices, it frequently works out
better for them and the Univer
sity," Kaplan said. In that way, it

acts as a legal buffer for the Uni
versity, giving people a choice that,
can sometimes show a quicker and
more satisfactory solution.
The Ombudsperson has dealt
with a fantastic range of problems
that span from complaints about
computer porn to issues about the
Honor Code and housing. About
500 separate cases are dealt with
by the office every year. However,
Kaplan noted, "There have been
no Food Service complaints for
the last several years, whereas
years ago there were many com
plaints. That represents real prog
ress."
Kaplan said that there seem to

be no solutions to some problems.
"A lot of people come in to sound
off about something. You do a lot
of listening sometimes, when
there isn't anything you can do,"
she noted. According to Kaplan,
this may be because of the "awful
lot of catch-22s that exist in any
big organization. Some people also
complain because people's feelings
are very involved, and policies are
not flexible enough to suit indi
vidual concerns."
However, regardless of prob
lems, Kaplan felt that the position
was rewarding. "You feel good if
you can help someone, and make
it better," she said.

need. As an independent office
from the rest of the University,
the Ombudsperson will then
advise the person on whom to

approach or approach people on
the individual's behalf.
Kaplan, who has held the po
sition for five years, is aided
by Special Assistant John
Goheen, a former Ombudsper
son, and Assistant Ombudsper
son Carmen Joves. Kaplan has
been associated with the Uni
versity for over 30 years as a
member of the Counseling and
Health Services at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center. She still
spends 40 percent of her time
as director of the HELP center.
The Ombudsperon's office Is
usually located in Building 260-
261 in the Main Quad, but has
temporarily been relocated to
Room 209 of Cowell due to the
earthquake.
"Although possessing no
decision-making authority, the
Ombudsperson has wide
powers of inquiry," Kaplan
said. For example, students can
approach the Ombudsperson if
they have any questions re
garding Honor Code violations,
but "once the complaint is

made, it is out of our hands." The
matter is then dealt with by Jud
icial Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
Another positive aspect of the
office is that it sometimes stops
people from rushing to court.
"There seems to be an increase
of people turning to grievance pro
cedures or litigation. When we can
offer them alternatives and
choices, it frequently works out
better for them and the Univer
sity," Kaplan said. In that way, it

acts as a legal buffer for the Uni
versity, giving people a choice that,
can sometimes show a quicker and
more satisfactory solution.
The Ombudsperson has dealt
with a fantastic range of problems
that span from complaints about
computer porn to issues about the
Honor Code and housing. About
500 separate cases are dealt with
by the office every year. However,
Kaplan noted, "There have been
no Food Service complaints for
the last several years, whereas
years ago there were many com
plaints. That represents real prog
ress."
Kaplan said that there seem to

be no solutions to some problems.
"A lot of people come in to sound
off about something. You do a lot
of listening sometimes, when
there isn't anything you can do,"
she noted. According to Kaplan,
this may be because of the "awful
lot of catch-22s that exist in any
big organization. Some people also
complain because people's feelings
are very involved, and policies are
not flexible enough to suit indi
vidual concerns."
However, regardless of prob
lems, Kaplan felt that the position
was rewarding. "You feel good if
you can help someone, and make
it better," she said.
