The University Ombudsper
son. Ombudsperson? It sounds
like a tongue twister gone
wrong, but it is actually an of
fice at Stanford that is helpful
for just about any kind of prob
lem you may face.
The position was established
in 1970 and is now held by the
University's fifth Ombudsper
son, Leah Kaplan.
Kaplan says her goal as Om
budsperson is to "direct people
to what they need. We want
them to feel free to come in.
Confidence is absolutely as
sured." She stresses that the
Ombudsperson is independent
of other organizations and that
no one else has access to their
records. The office is funded
by the University through the
President's Office.
The Ombudsperson's aims
can be summed up through the
original charge of 1973: "The
Ombudsman's task is to protect
the interests and rights of
members of the Stanford com
munity from injustices or
abuses of discretion. . . . The
Ombudsman exists to receive,
examine and channel the com
plaints and grievances of mem
bers of the Stanford
community, and to secure ex
peditious and impartial
redress."
"If someone isn't sure how
to deal with a problem and does
not wish to take any action,
that is very much permitted.
We like to talk to them and let
them know what their options
are," Kaplan said. The Om
budsperson attempts to give a
person all the information they
need. As an independent office
from the rest of the University,
the Ombudsperson will then
advise the person on whom to

approach or approach people on
the individual's behalf.
Kaplan, who has held the po
sition for five years, is aided
by Special Assistant John
Goheen, a former Ombudsper
son, and Assistant Ombudsper
son Carmen Joves. Kaplan has
been associated with the Uni
versity for over 30 years as a
member of the Counseling and
Health Services at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center. She still
spends 40 percent of her time
as director of the HELP center.
The Ombudsperon's office Is
usually located in Building 260-
261 in the Main Quad, but has
temporarily been relocated to
Room 209 of Cowell due to the
earthquake.
"Although possessing no
decision-making authority, the
Ombudsperson has wide
powers of inquiry," Kaplan
said. For example, students can
approach the Ombudsperson if
they have any questions re
garding Honor Code violations,
but "once the complaint is
