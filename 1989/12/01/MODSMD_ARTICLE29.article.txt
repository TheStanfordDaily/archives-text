# Bug probes behind 800 numbers
## 
### Aram Irwin 
Dear Bug,
What kind of information can
r you get from the toll-free 1-800
f* lineB about detergent, toothpaste,
etc? Who works there?
1-800-CrestMe
Well, CrestMe, my spider-sense
was tingling, and I knew your
question went beyond the shallow
banality it showed on the surface.
I felt the chilling realization that
someone, somewhere, was in trou
ble and that only the Bug could
help. Instinct led me to a box of
Tide laundry detergent. I
scrambled for the phone as I ur
gently read Proctor and Gamble's
1-800 number from the box's side
and called their headquarters in
Cincinnati.
"Proctor and Gamble informa
tion line," soothed the female
voice on the other end of the line
!in a tone so smooth and tranquil
I suspected I had reached the
Quaalude information hotline.
Nevertheless, I posed the first
part of your question to her.
The Voice hesitated before it
V. responded, "We answer a whole
variety of informational questions
on how to use products." Wow, I
" thought, I've hit pay dirt. This is
it. Too exciting.
"Yeah, it is kind of a general
question, isn't it," I said while
n my mind raced. This woman had
obviously been answering phones
far too long. She was on the brink
of losing her humanity, was
' threatened with becoming only a
disembodied voice, slave to the
° machinations of Proctor and
Gamble; only a determined effort
'• on my part could rescue her from
J her impending doom. I continued
'with the second part of your
? query, Crest Me. "Who are you?"
I coaxed.
This time the voice's hesitation
n was unmistakable. In a tone that
J sounded a touch less like a talking
scale, the voice answered,
""Martha — I'm Martha." The
J sheer force of the human drama
0 unfolding drove me to press
' Martha further. "How long," I
demanded, "How long have you
worked here?"
"9:30 to 7:30," she stuttered,
her smooth voice cracking for the
first time, "Eastern."
"Martha," I pleaded, "How long
have you worked here?"
- "I've worked," she managed to

force out over a muffled sob, "over
six years," she continued bravely.
I realized then that what
Martha desperately needed was
someone to treat her with warmth
— she needed to speak to someone
with genuine concern for and in
terest in her. With this realiza
tion, I abandoned my previously
impersonal attitude and adopted
a gentler tone. "So, Martha," I
purred reassuringly, "tell me
about your job."

Martha regained her composure
somewhat, and we spoke for what
seemed like hours about her work
and boss, socialism, love and loss,
how to wash out ground-in spag
hetti sauce . . .
I'm sorry, CrestMe, but it
wouldn't be fair to Martha for me
to tell you who she really is. All

I can tell you is that she works
for the detergent and laundry de
partment information division of
Proctor and Gamble, where scores
of answerers — many of them
college graduates — spend their
days warning curious folks who
call in that Tide should not be
taken internally.
Emotionally spent but fully
human, Martha huskily
whispered, "Goodbye."
I hung up and leaned back in
my chair. I had saved a human
being from losing her soul. I knew
I had to continue my mission. If
I could save someone at Proctor
and Gamble, I resolved as I picked
up a bottle of shampoo, I could
just as easily save someone at
Johnson and Johnson. I gave their
1-800 number a try.
Icy cold "Product Specialist"
Mo Murdock was not amused by
your question, Crest Me. I tried to
warm up to Mo, but she informed
me in her metallic please-hang
up-and-dial-again voice that "our
toll-free line is strictly a consumer
products information line." I
shivered and thanked Mo anyway
as she hung up.
True, it may have been too late
for Mo, but remember that you
can still make a difference in the
lives of people like Proctor and
Gamble's Martha Koetting.
So the next time you call, don't
just ask Martha how to do your
wash — why not ask her how her
wash is doing, instead?
