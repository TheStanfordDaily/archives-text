# Kennedy delivers report on UCMI goals progress
## Faculty urged to assume 'personal responsibility' 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
urged faculty members to assume "per
sonal responsibility" in implementing the
recommendations of the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues at yesterday's
meeting of the Faculty Senate.
Kennedy presented the senate with a
draft of a UCMI Progress Report, outlining
the current status of the committee's 130
recommendations on improving minority
life here.
According to the committee's own assess
ment, "strong support and uneven momen
tum" mark Stanford's reception of the
UCMI guidelines.
"It's not really surprising that there is
strong support for the recommendations,"
Kennedy said, noting that half of the rec
ommendations have been adopted already.
The items not yet implemented either re
quire more time for committee review or
require money not available in the current
budget, he said.
Senate members received the 45-page
progress report at the meeting and had no
questions for Kennedy. Campus Report will
publish a copy of the progress report in
its Dec. 6 issue.
In his address, Kennedy directed the sen
ate's attention to the "troubling skepticism
about the University's commitment to af
firmative action" revealed in the UCMI
staff subcommittee report, released Nov.
14.
Kennedy said the committee regretted
that the omission of Native American
workers from the study caused offense to
the American Indian community. The com
mittee is considering reissuing the report
with the American Indian statistics in
cluded.

The items not yet imple
mented either require
more time for committee
review or money not
available in the current
budget, Kennedy said.

Kennedy also called attention to the
"impressive performance" of the School of
Education in its successful minority
recruitment.
Over the past four years, the percentage
of minorities enrolled in the Stanford
Teacher Education Program rose from 6
percent to 25.4 percent. Minority enrollment
in the School of Education's doctoral pro
gram also increased, from 10.3 percent to
28.2 percent.
In other business, the Committee on Un
dergraduate Admissions and Financial Aids
presented its annual report to the Senate.
The report did not contain any recom
mendations requiring senate approval, al
though the senate expects to vote at a later
date on policy items concerning affirmative
action in admissions and the possible in
clusion of Native Hawaiians among groups
targeted for admission at Stanford.
CUAFA proposes to treat Native
Hawaiians as a subgroup of Native Amer
icans for purposes of undergraduate ad
missions and financial aid.
However, the committee has not yet
decided on a satisfactory definition of a
Native Hawaiian.
Native Americans are tradition
ally defined in terms of tribal af
filiation. The federal government
requires an individual to be at
least one-eighth Native American
to be considered a Native Amer
ican, according to the committee's
report.
However, the definition sugges
ted to CUAFA designated Native
Hawaiians as people having one
ancestor who was living in the
islands at the time of European
settlement. Under this definition,
people with as little as 1/256 Na
tive Hawaiian blood are consid
ered of that background, commit
tee chair Denis Phillips told the
senate.
Once the committee finds an

appropriate definition of Native
Hawaiians, the senate will vote
on the proposed recruitment.
The committee also looked at
the larger issue of targeting mi
nority groups for admission
The committee suggested that
a group should be targeted if it
is underrepresented in Stanford's
student body by both national and
state standards, and if this un
derrepresentaiton results from
clear historical inequities in this
country.
CUAFA also studied the admis
sion of Asian-American applicants
by the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions to "ensure there's no
intended or unintended bias,"
Phillips said.
In other action, the senate
unanimously approved guidelines
for multi-authored research
papers proposed by the Commit
tee on Research more than a
month ago.
