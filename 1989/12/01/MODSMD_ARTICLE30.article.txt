# Big siblings provide guidance
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
Life for a Stanford student
frequently involves adopting
buddies and dormmates as
members of a family. However,
students such as senior Howard
Finkelstein have taken the proc
ess one step further, and per
haps a little closer to the heart.
Finkelstein, along with 20
other Stanford students, has
adopted a little sibling from the
Bay Area through the local Big
Brothers/Big Sisters chapter on
campus. "There's more to life
than schoolwork, the usual ac
tivities and local politics. It
means a lot more to me to spend
quality time with a child without
a father, who is looking for a
hand and direction," Finkelstein
said.
Stanford representatives Jeff
Schaffer and David Morales
volunteered their time to work
with Beth Kruger, the full-time
Bay Area coordinator for the na
tional organization, to structure
quarterly events and to organize
orientation programs. Schaffer
and Morales try to coordinate
at least two activities a quarter
to publicize the sibling program.
The most recent event took
place Nov. 11, when Phi Delta
Theta and Pi Beta Phi jointly
sponsored a bowl-a-thon which
raised $500 for the organiza
tion.
The little siblings involved in
the program range from 5 years
old and up. All come from single
parent families, and 90 percent
of the children are raised by a
single mother. According to
Schaffer, "What the volunteers
will be doing is providing a role
model for a little brother or little
sister; someone who they can
really look up to and seek advice
from."
Most students spend from
three to six hours a week with
their little sibling. "I was
brought up in a real, solid family
setting, and I would like to help
someone who isn't as fortu
nate," Finkelstein said. He tries
to spend up to six hours of
quality time a week with his
little brother, eating out, going
to football games, or watching
him play hockey. Finkelstein is

presently planning to take his
brother surfing.
There are nine Stanford stu
dents who have completed the
application process but have not
yet been matched up with a little
sibling. However, there is room
for many more volunteers. Pres
ently, there are around 80 kids
in the Bay Area who are waiting
for a Big Brother or a Big Sister.
Applicants to be big siblings
should have access to cars and
must commit to spend at least
one academic year with their
little siblings. Seniors are not
accepted into the program be
cause they will have less than
one year to spend with a little
sibling.

"We're looking for applicants
who can and want to start las
ting relationships," Schaffer
said.
The adoption process involves
a detailed application, in which
students can shortly describe
their personal background, fa
vorite interests and activities,
and age and sex preference of
their little sibling. An interview
follows, and the applicant is re
quested to pass out three refer
ence forms to be completed by
friends. Then, the coordinators
select a compatible little sibling;
the matching process often
takes several weeks to several

months.
According to Schaffer, "We are
especially seeking students who
want minority matches. Around
10 of the current 21 matches in
volve minority kids. We are in par
ticular need of Spanish speakers,
as some of the kids from the East

Palo Alto area don't speak Eng
lish, but want an older sibling."
Big Brothers and Sisters can
take advantage of the special op
portunity presented by working
with younger children, Schaffer
said.
"Because of my little brother,
I get the chance to do a lot of
things I wouldn't be able to do
with my friends at Stanford be
cause I'm too old for it,"he said.

Junior Kathryn Evans has been
close friends with her little sister,
Karrie Hills, since freshman year.
"It's been so rewarding. I've seen
her change a whole lot. I've gotten
to watch her grow up in a way
and she has helped me. As I've
watched her grow, she's helped
give me a different perspective to
things I'm doing in my life."
"It's definitely a two-way
street," Finkelstein said, "I get so
much out of this program.

Life for a Stanford student
frequently involves adopting
buddies and dormmates as
members of a family. However,
students such as senior Howard
Finkelstein have taken the proc
ess one step further, and per
haps a little closer to the heart.
Finkelstein, along with 20
other Stanford students, has
adopted a little sibling from the
Bay Area through the local Big
Brothers/Big Sisters chapter on
campus. "There's more to life
than schoolwork, the usual ac
tivities and local politics. It
means a lot more to me to spend
quality time with a child without
a father, who is looking for a
hand and direction," Finkelstein
said.
Stanford representatives Jeff
Schaffer and David Morales
volunteered their time to work
with Beth Kruger, the full-time
Bay Area coordinator for the na
tional organization, to structure
quarterly events and to organize
orientation programs. Schaffer
and Morales try to coordinate
at least two activities a quarter
to publicize the sibling program.
The most recent event took
place Nov. 11, when Phi Delta
Theta and Pi Beta Phi jointly
sponsored a bowl-a-thon which
raised $500 for the organiza
tion.
The little siblings involved in
the program range from 5 years
old and up. All come from single
parent families, and 90 percent
of the children are raised by a
single mother. According to
Schaffer, "What the volunteers
will be doing is providing a role
model for a little brother or little
sister; someone who they can
really look up to and seek advice
from."
Most students spend from
three to six hours a week with
their little sibling. "I was
brought up in a real, solid family
setting, and I would like to help
someone who isn't as fortu
nate," Finkelstein said. He tries
to spend up to six hours of
quality time a week with his
little brother, eating out, going
to football games, or watching
him play hockey. Finkelstein is

presently planning to take his
brother surfing.
There are nine Stanford stu
dents who have completed the
application process but have not
yet been matched up with a little
sibling. However, there is room
for many more volunteers. Pres
ently, there are around 80 kids
in the Bay Area who are waiting
for a Big Brother or a Big Sister.
Applicants to be big siblings
should have access to cars and
must commit to spend at least
one academic year with their
little siblings. Seniors are not
accepted into the program be
cause they will have less than
one year to spend with a little
sibling.

"We're looking for applicants
who can and want to start las
ting relationships," Schaffer
said.
The adoption process involves
a detailed application, in which
students can shortly describe
their personal background, fa
vorite interests and activities,
and age and sex preference of
their little sibling. An interview
follows, and the applicant is re
quested to pass out three refer
ence forms to be completed by
friends. Then, the coordinators
select a compatible little sibling;
the matching process often
takes several weeks to several

months.
According to Schaffer, "We are
especially seeking students who
want minority matches. Around
10 of the current 21 matches in
volve minority kids. We are in par
ticular need of Spanish speakers,
as some of the kids from the East

Palo Alto area don't speak Eng
lish, but want an older sibling."
Big Brothers and Sisters can
take advantage of the special op
portunity presented by working
with younger children, Schaffer
said.
"Because of my little brother,
I get the chance to do a lot of
things I wouldn't be able to do
with my friends at Stanford be
cause I'm too old for it,"he said.

Junior Kathryn Evans has been
close friends with her little sister,
Karrie Hills, since freshman year.
"It's been so rewarding. I've seen
her change a whole lot. I've gotten
to watch her grow up in a way
and she has helped me. As I've
watched her grow, she's helped
give me a different perspective to
things I'm doing in my life."
"It's definitely a two-way
street," Finkelstein said, "I get so
much out of this program.
