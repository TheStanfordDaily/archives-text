# HEAR aims for rape awareness
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
"I was literally meeting people
that didn't know acquaintance
rape existed ... it amazed me,"
says Suzanna Mack, creator and
coordinator of Project HEAR.
HEAR, or Heightened Educa
tion on Acquaintance Rape, is a
residence-based rape awareness
program Mack initiated last year.
"I was a resident assistant my
junior year and managed to find
a good number of people . . . who
had had problems with rape," she
said. "They seemed to be of the
opinion that things would have
been differently for them if there
had been something when they
were freshmen to let them know
that acquaintance rape does ex
ist."
HEAR's approach to rape
awareness is unique. The program
involves acted-out rape scenarios
followed by discussion.
"I think live role play is one of

the biggest assets of our group.
It brings it one step closer when
there are people three feet in front
of you who are acting out a rape
or a situation leading up to rape,"
Mack said.
Mack had the idea for HEAR
early last spring quarter. The di
rectors of the Santa Monica Rape
Treatment Center helped Mack
coordinate the progam. Through
in-depth sessions with psyc
hologists and psychiatrists, Mack
and other project members as
sembled a training program.
Fall quarter, the HEAR mem
bers gave a scaled-down presen
tation for RAs, which resulted in
a great success. They were asked
to present their program to every
freshman dormitory.
According to Mack, "In every
audience of 40, there's a sure bet
that at least one woman has been
raped. The latest anonymous
campus survey shows that one in
four undergraduates are victims
of rape or attempted rape, and

Stanford is consistent with the na
tional campus rape statistics."
The HEAR presentations aim
to educate the male and female
audience. "There is always a male
and a female presenter, but I
think sometimes men feel that
they are being attacked, person
ally, just by virtue of their being
men. We try to put some kind of
comment in the middle (of the
program) to say that we hope that
men don't think we're pointing
the finger and accusing them of
being rapists," Mack said.
"I really can't blame them for
(being defensive), but I think they
get over that as the discussions
continue," she added.
HEAR has visited 26 dormitor
ies and will soon have visited
every freshman dormitory on
campus. The project is then mov
ing on to the Greek system and
residences on the Row.
Mack said that HEAR will be
looking for new members to help
the program winter quarter.
