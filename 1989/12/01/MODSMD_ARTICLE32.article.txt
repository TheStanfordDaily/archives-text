## Spikers smash Women of Troy Four-game triumph moves Cardinal into Regional semifinals 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
Losing is rarely a good thing. But the
manner in which the Stanford women's
volleyball team lost the second game of
last night's NCAA West Regional match
against USC was perhaps the best thing
that could have happened to the team.
After being down 12-3 to the Women
of Troy in the second game, the Cardinal
asserted its dominance by storming back
to take a 13-12 lead before relenting
three straight points and the game to
USC. But the momentum Stanford gen
erated propelled the third-seeded Car
dinal to a 15-8, 13-15, 15-5, 15-7 victory
over sixth-seeded USC.

"We lost it so quickly in that last
rotation. It was very frustrating," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said of losing the
second game. "But the key thing was
that we did come back. That's when I
knew that we were in good shape for
the match. Even though it was one to
one in games, we had established the
momentum again."
After Stanford won the first game in
which both teams played sloppily, USC
jumped out to 4-0 and 7-3 leads
bolstered by Cardinal errors. Two recep
tion errors by senior hitter Laura Olesen
and a blocking error charged against
freshman setter Carrie Feldman gave
the Women of Troy a 10-3 advantage
that appeared insurmountable.
USC won two more points to go up
12-3 and Shaw decided to insert soph
omore hitter Amy Cooper to try to slow
USC. Although Cooper played only in
that game, her service turned the mo
mentum in Stanford's favor for the
remainder of the match.
Stanford won a side out and Cooper
went back to serve. With the rotation,
middle blocker Bev Oden and hitters

Jessica Benton and Kristion Klein
moved to the front court and proceeded
to smother the USC attack. Cooper
banged two kills and added an ace to
pull the Cardinal to 7-12, and USC
began to wilt in the face of Stanford's
dominant front three.
At 10-12 Stanford was awarded a point
as the Women of Troy were charged
with a rotation violation off of Cooper's
serve. After a USC timeout senior out
side hitter Yleana Carrasco was whistled
for a blocking error to give the Cardinal
another point. One more point off
Cooper's serve gave Stanford its first
lead of the game at 13-12.
The Cardinal appeared poised to
snatch the game away, but the Women
of Troy won a crucial sideout. USC won
the next two points to win a game point
at 14-13 and Carrasco killed a ball
through Oden and Benton's block to
save the game for USC.
"The rotation of Klein, Benton and
Oden is quite a blocking wall to have
to contend with," USC Coach Lisa Love
said. "We needed to do some certain
things to get out of that rotation and
it took us a while to do it. 1 thought
'Oh, gosh. It's going to be an uphill
battle.' But we were able to do it and
win the second game, which was critical
for us."
USC may have won the game, but
Stanford won the 1,019-person crowd's
raucous support and regained its con
fidence.
"Even though we were down 10-3, I
felt that if we just had it out one point
at a time we could really come back,"
Klein said. "I think even though we
were down we had a lot of confidence
and knew that we could do it."
"You've got to play well to get the
crowd into it," Shaw said. "I think that
really helped us."
After such a comeback the third and
fourth games were no more than a for
mality. The Women of Troy briefly en
joyed a 4-2 lead in game three before
handing the lead back to Stanford.
Sloppy play like that which has plagued

USC all year gave the Cardinal 7-4 and
then 14-5 margins.
USC self-destructed in the fourth
game as Stanford took the lead at 4-3
and never looked back. Stanford cruised
to 9-3 and 12-6 advantages. USC then
took a timeout but was unable to stop
the Cardinal afterward.
The Cardinal blockers and USC errors
held the Women of Troy to a .083 hitting
percentage for the match. USC middle
blocker Megan McCallister and hitter
Lonise Norfleet hit only .135 and .125,
respectively.
Stanford was led by Olesen, who hit
.368 and had a game-high 16 digs in
what could be her final home game at
Stanford. Oden pounded a .357 hitting
percentage and led all players with six
block assists. Klein, nicknamed "Mag
num," appropriately hit .357.
Stanford now advances to the region's
semifinal round to face the winner of
the Washington-Wyoming match, to be
played tonight in Seattle. The regional
semifinals and finals will be held at
UCLA if the Bruins defeat eighth
seeded Pepperdine tonight, but if UCLA
loses then Stanford will host the tour
nament.
Irrespective of where they play, how
ever, the Stanford players have a
preferred opponent. Washington and
Stanford split their regular season
Pacific 10 Conference matches, each
winning on the other's floor. But Stan
ford has revenge on its mind for last
year's upset loss to the Huskies in the
regional semifinal.
"We feel like we didn't play a good
match against them last time," Shaw
said. "We want to play a good, consistent
match one time and return the favor
of last year's tournament."
The region semifinals and final will
be held next Friday and Saturday.

Oden tied sister Kim Oden's Stanford
single-season block assist mark with 134.
She will break that record in the region's
semifinal.
