# Men's basketball surprises soothsayers, opens Invite against Lehigh
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
As .*1989-90 basketball
season approached, almost every
one had the same opinion about
the team. What appeared obvious
was that the Cardinal would look
for sophomore Adam Keefe to
score a lot of points and that
teams would try to double- and
triple-team him.
After two games this year, Stan
ford's opponents have followed
this scouting report and swarmed
Keefe in the low post. The result,
however, has been that Keefe is
averaging 20.5 points and 10
rebounds a game anyway, and the
Cardinal is 2-0.
While the competition has not
been that formidable, the Cardi
nal is surprising the soothsayers
who predicted a fall from glory
for the team ranked as high as
12th nationally last year. Tonight
Stanford opens the Apple Invita
tional against Lehigh, with Lou
isiana Tech and SMU playing in
the other semifinal.
The consolation and champion
ship games will be played tomor
row. Game times are 6:30 p.m.
and 8:30 p.m. both nights and all
games will be held in Maples Pa

The keys for Stanford so far
this season have been the inside
play of Keefe and juniors Deshon
Wingate and Andrew Vlahov, out
side shooting from almost every
one and the ability tc get the job
done defensively when the need
arises.
After losing six seniors to grad
uation last year, the Cardinal has
quickly gone from being one of
the most experienced teams in the

Pacific 10 Conference to one of
the youngest. With eight fresh
men on the roster, and only one
senior, the team has followed such
"veterans" as the 19-year-old
Keefe.
"I went from one of the
youngest players last year to one
of the oldest," Vlahov said. "[Butl
I think it's coming together. The
influx of six [true] freshmen, and
eight guys who have never played
before ... I think that's kind of
a culture shock for the old guys."
Vlahov, who at 6-foot-7, 225
pounds was known mostly as a
powerful rebounder last year, has
played well defensively — and of
fensively — since the season
began. After hitting a game
winning three-pointer in an ex
hibition against a club team from
Brazil, he exploded in the opener.
Vlahov scored 13 of Stanford's
first 19 points of the year as Stan
ford went on to handily defeat Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, 88-56.
Vlahov, a small forward last
season, is adjusting to playing in
side more this year as he oflen
plays power forward for the Car
dinal. He is third on the team in

both scoring and rebounding and
is tied for the team lead in steals.
"It was good to see Vlahov
develop a post game," Coach Mike
Montgomery said after the win
over the Mustangs. "That's a plus
because I don't think there are
too many guys as strong as he is
in there."
"People aren't used to Vlahov
the scorer," Keefe said. "They're
used to Vlahov as a team player.
But he's capable of scoring 20 on
a given night."
That scoring should take the
pressure off Keefe, who is averag
ing over 18 points an outing in
his last six games. Another way
to take the pressure off him is
for the Cardinal to hit the outside
shot. The Mustangs keyed on
Keefe and shut him out for the
first 13 minutes of the game, but
the Cardinal's outside shooting
freed him up for a 10-point ex
plosion at the end of the first half.
"They came out strong and
really concentrated down inside,"
he said. "I think that really cost
them because we can really hit
from outside. . . . We just lit it up."
Montgomery's other bigtime
front-liner this season has been
the 6-7 Wingate. The junior
toured in Hungary playing with
a Pac-10 all-star team over the
summer and led the Americans
in rebounding on the tour. He
started on the Farm where he left
off in Europe, pulling down 25
boards in the team's two exhibi
tion wins.
In the two non-exhibition
games, Wingate has 16 rebounds
and is averaging 16.5 points a
game, both second on the team.
Unlike last year when he played
both forward and guard, Wingate
has found his niche coming off
the bench, grabbing every re
bound in sight and taking a lot
of high-percentage shots. He has
made a team-leading 78.6 percent
of his shots this year and has hit
over 90 percent of his free throws.
Complementing this front court
is a back court that is answering
the questions asked of it before
the season. John Patrick and
Peter Dukes both have seen a lot
of time at point guard and both
have scored, rebounded and main
tained good turnover-to-assists
ratios.
The off-guard spot has been

filled by junior college transfer
Kenny Ammann and freshman
Kenny Hicks. Ammann is a fine
outside shooter, and Hicks ap
peared to improve minute by min
ute in the Cal Poly-SLO game.
Montgomery also has freshmen
Marcus Lollie and Mike Morris in
the back court who combined to
make 4-of-6 shots against the

Mustangs.
A concern is the play at center
where Derek Bruton and Langtry
Meyer have both started some
what slowly. A key here could be
the return of redshirt freshman
Paul Garrett, who has been
sidelined with a broken finger.
Garrett is expected to see limited
action this weekend.

Another concern is the difficult
schedule. The Cardinal will likely
play No. 4 Kansas in a Christmas
tournament. In addition, No. 2
Arizona and No. 15 UCLA both
meet the Cardinal twice in Pac-10
play. But Montgomery has never
had a losing season in his 11 years
of college coaching and has no
intention of starting now.
