# Men's swim team eyes Invite

### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
As most Stanford students
trudge into their final classes
before Dead Week, the Cardinal
men's swimming team will be
diving into the pool at the Belmont
Plaza in Long Beach for the USC
Invitational.
After churning out two weeks
of intense training following its
upset of defending national
champion Texas in a dual meet
Nov. 11, the Stanford swimming
team will jump into the pool for
its first invitational meet of the
season this morning. The Cardi
nal will race against swimmers
from USC, UCLA and California.
"The team's still excited about
Texas, but training is our first
priority right now," senior
sprinter Doug Lillydahl said. "We
are no longer resting on the
laurels of the victory because we
realize we will need to improve
by March."
This meet will be the first
chance under ideal conditions for
many of the Cardinal swimmers
to reach NCAA-qualifying times

needed for the team to challenge
Texas in March. Sophomore Jeff
Rouse became the first Stanford
swimmer to qualify for NCAAs,
recording an NCAA-qualifying
time in the 200-meter backstroke
of the opening dual meet. In Bel
mont Plaza's indoor pool, the site
of the 1990 Pac-10 Champion
ships, the swimmers will not be
hampered by less-than-perfect
weather conditions and will be
able to shoot for fast times.
"This will be an excellent chance
for our freshmen to get used to
the facility," Lillydahl said.
"Hopefully, we will have many of
our swimmers qualified before
NCAAs but, if not, this allows our
swimmers to visualize the pool
better and perform less 'fresh
many' when Pac-lOs come
around."
According to Lillydahl, despite
the team still being a little broken
down from the intense early
season training, the squad still
should record strong times this
weekend. Rouse, freshman Erik
Maurer and seniors John Witchel
and Rick Gould have been swim
ming especially well.

"This meet will provide a very
nice pool with good competition,
Lillydahl said. "I anticipate most
of our people swimming really
well."
The Cardinal squad will com
pete without sophomore distance
swimmer Alex Kostich, who will
be in Orlando, Fla., for the U.S.
Open. The meet, which begins
Sunday, will bring together some
of the strongest American racers,
as well as swimmers from the So
viet Union, East Germany, Yugos
lavia, France, Australia and
Canada.
"I thought that this would be
a good opportunity for me to com
pete against people from all over
the world," Kostich said. "I feel
really confident about how hard
1 have been training this year,
and I am looking forward to com
peting. I am not going to be
shaved or rested, like a lot of the
other swimmers, so it will be in
teresting to see how fast I can go."
Following this weekend's races,
the Cardinal will return to
deGuerre Pool to continue train
ing until the Jan. 6 dual meet
against UC-Santa Barbara.
