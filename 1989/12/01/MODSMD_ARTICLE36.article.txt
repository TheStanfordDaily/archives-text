# Women's swim team sends five to Open, others to Trojan land
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Two weeks from now, Stanford stu
dents will be getting on airplanes and
flying all over the country to get a break
from school.
This weekend the women's swim team
will get a jump on everybody else as two
different groups of swimmers head off to
two different meets.
The U.S. Open meet in Orlando, Fla.,
and the Trojan Grand Prix Invitational
in Long Beach, Calif., will give the swim
mers a break from their regular training

schedule and also provide them with an
indication as to where they stand nation
ally a month before the season begins in
earnest.
"We've trained extremely well this
fall," Coach Richard Quick said. "I look
for us to swim real well in the meets.
It'll be a really good measure of how
good we are and what our potential is
for the future."
Quick will be taking five of his top
swimmers to Orlando for what he called,
"the United States' biggest international
meet of the year." In addition to many
of this country's top swimmers, many

foreign teams are expected to attend, in
cluding a group from powerhouse East
Germany.
The Cardinal contingent should be able
to hold its own, however. The group con
sists of junior Michelle Griglione, soph
omore Dede Trimble and freshmen Janet
Evans, Lori Heisick and Janel Jorgensen.
Griglione, the defending NCAA champ
in the 400-yard individual medley, will
compete in the 200-meter butterfly and
the 200-meter and 400-meter IMs.
Trimble, the 200 backstroke champion at
last year's U.S. Short Course Nationals,
will compete in both the 100-meter and

200-meter backstroke.
Evans will compete in the three events
she won in the 1988 Olympics — the
400-meter IM, the 400-meter freestyle
and the 800-meter freestyle — as well
as the 200-meter freestyle, the 200-meter
butterfly and perhaps the 200-meter
backstroke. Jorgensen, another 1988
Olympic medalist, will swim the
200-meter IM, the 100-meter and 200-
meter freestyles and the 200-meter but
terfly. Heisick, who just missed making
the Olympic team, will swim the 100-
meter and 200-meter breaststroke.
The meet begins Sunday and runs

through Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Asst. Coach Mike Chasson
will bring the rest of the team to Long
Beach to compete against some of the
nation's finest teams. Top-10 powers Ten
nessee, California, Michigan, UCLA and
USC will all be in attendence as the Car
dinal will put its preseason No. 1 national
ranking on the line for the first time.
Ten returning Ail-Americans will swim
for the defending NCAA champions in
the three-day meet that begins today.
After these two meets, the Cardinal will
return for the end of classes and Christ
mas training.
