It will be like duck-hunting
With a bazooka," Stanford Coach
t Zoran 1 ulum said in reference to
'the fencing team's dual meet
against San Jose State tomorrow
At 1 p.m. in Roble Gym.
After decisively beating Califor
nia 24-3 Nov. 17, Cardinal fencers
will continue to try to defend their
NCAA West Regional Champion
ship as they square off against
the Spartans. Like Cal, San Jose
State does not maintain an
NCAA-level fencing squad. In
stead, it competes as a club team.
Ironically, women's Coach
Sherry Posthumus is concerned
Tor this reason. "Because they are
k club team, they could show up
here with anyone from a class
level fencer to someone who has
7>een fencing for 20 years and just
went back to school," she said.
- Both coaches are treating the
match as good practice. "As soon
as I feel comfortable (with the

outcome of the meet), I'll give
everyone on the team a chance
to fence," Tulum said.
Currently, Stanford holds the
No. 1 spot in both the men's and
women's divisions on the West
Coast.
Interestingly, the Spartans once
reigned supreme in the West. Un
til 1986, when financial problems
rocked the university, San Jose
State had the strongest team this
side of the Rockies. At that time,
fencing was a varsity sport, and
the Spartans had Olympic-caliber
fencers on both men's and wom
en's teams.
"They used to walk into our
gym and just take over," Pos
thumus said. "Our kids would just
roll over."
Stanford has not been rolling
over much lately, however, as both
teams remain undefeated this
year. In addition, the women's
team is seeking its seventh con
secutive Regional title.
