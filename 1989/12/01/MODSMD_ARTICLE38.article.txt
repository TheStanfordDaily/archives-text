# Baseball ranked No. 4
## Carey, Mussina lead Cardinal into new season 
### 
Despite coming off its worst
.season in the 1980s, Sport Mag
azine has tabbed the Stanford
-baseball as the nation's No. 4
team in its preseason poll.
H The Cardinal finished 1989
with a 30-28 record and was not
'invited to the NCAA playoffs for
the first time since 1980. Sport
ranked the Cardinal behind Flor
ida State, Wichita State and Texas
in that order.

Wichita State is the defending
national champion.
Stanford's hopes rest largely on
the shoulders of senior outfielder
Paul Carey and junior pitcher
Mike Mussina â€” both named
preseason All-Americans by
Sport.
Carey, with a career average of
.337, spurned a contract offer
from the Detroit Tigers to return
to Stanford for his final year.
