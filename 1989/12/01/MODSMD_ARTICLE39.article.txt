# Wrestlers down San Francisco State, 28-16
## 
### Jim Smith 
In a Bay Area showdown,
Stanford's wrestling team
pounded San Francisco State
Wednesday night 28-16, improv
ing its record to 3-1.
Fielding three Lumberjack
Open champions, the Gators felt
they would have a chance to beat
the Cardinal this year. Cardinal
wrestlers, however, quickly dis
missed these hopes by dominat
ing from the start as freshman
Josh Fleming opened the match
with a pinning of his opponent
in the first period. After Dave
Nowick lost a tough match to
two-time All-America Rick
Goodwin at 126 pounds, the
grapplers won five of the next
seven matches by superior deci
sions (winning by eight points
or more). James Dinette and
Ron Perry both crushed their
opponents, nearly recording
technical falls.
"We had a great attitude going
out there," Coach Chris Horpel
said. "When someone needed
that extra point for a superior
decision or worked into a pinning
situation, they came through
and did the job. There was little
hesitation in our technique."
Both Mark Graham (4-0) and
Steve Buddie (3-0-1) improved
their unblemished records with
ease. In what was expected to
be a close match, Graham steam
rolled a former junior college
champion 11-3. Buddie,
meanwhile, dominated his op
ponent 15-5.
While Stanford did record
seven victories, one of the most
impressive bouts was Matt Top
ham's tie with the Gator's un

beaten Claude Claybrook.
Claybrook, a two-time California
state champion, had just wont
he Lumbeijack Open. Topham
controlled the match and
grabbed a late lead before
Claybrook was able to tie it up
in the final seconds. "Matt
wrestled very well," Horpel said.
"He should be able to win if he
faces Claybrook again."
In the matches at 134 and 142
pounds, Josh Lisle and Dave
Sacks both turned in gritty

performances. Lisle shut down
his opponent en route to a 9-1
victory, while Sacks lost a hard
fought 5-3 decision to a tough
opponent.
"I was pleased with the match
and the progress we have made
to this point," Horpel said. "The
team looks balanced and well
prepared."
This weekend, Stanford
travels to the Showboat Hotel
in Las Vegas for one of the big
gest tournaments of the year.

This competition features top
wrestlers from all over the na
tion and promises to be a stern
test. Last year, 167-pound Steve
Yarbrough placed fourth and
won the award for recording the
most pins as the Cardinal placed
23rd in the 85-team tournament.
"The Las Vegas Invitational
is basically the equivalent of the
NCAAs," Horpel said. "I hope to
see a few guys place or, if they
do an outstanding job, maybe
even win."
