# Students preserve Native American history

In the darkrooms of the Stanford
Art Department, students in Anthro
pology 126 are recreating a part of the
past.
With access to 1,500 negatives taken
by Native American photographer
Horace Poolaw, they are looking at
one man's view of a changing culture.
From the 1920s until his death in
1984, Poolaw photographed various
tribes and captured the transition of
his people from the teepee into houses
and from traditional dress to
European-style clothing. He based

much of his work in Oklahoma and
extensively documented his own tribe,
the Kiowa.
While some of his photos were sold
on the streets as postcards and were
eventually reproduced without his per
mission in history textbooks, most of
the negatives being developed here as
part of the Kiowa Ethnography Project
have never been printed before.
Poolaw later turned to other profes
sions like farming and ranching, but
he never stopped taking pictures of
his people.
In one photo, a Native American
man stands in full headdress and trade

cloth draped over his shirt and tie.
Next to him is a Native American
woman wearing a buckakin dress with
the signature short hair of the 1920s
and 19305.
Students involved with the project
come from various backgrounds. They
include Native American, Asian, black
and Peruvian students, and comprise
what instructor Linda Poolaw, the
photographer's daughter, called "a
little United Nations."
Janine Jones, a junior, describes the
class as an opportunity she would not
have been able to pass up. A photog
raphy she is part Native Amer

ican and felt the class with its artistic
and ethnographic aspects "seemed per
fect" for her, she said.
"The significance [of the project! has
a lot to do with working with some
thing that hasn't been examined by a
large group of people who have put
their stamp of approval on it. That's
what we're doing," Jones said.
She also noted that before coming
to Stanford, she wasn't culturally con
nected to the Native American side of
her heritage. The class has inspired
her to investigate her own family in
