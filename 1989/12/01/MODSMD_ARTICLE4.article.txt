# Students preserve Native American history
## 
### Vivian Louie 
In the darkrooms of the Stanford
Art Department, students in Anthro
pology 126 are recreating a part of the
past.
With access to 1,500 negatives taken
by Native American photographer
Horace Poolaw, they are looking at
one man's view of a changing culture.
From the 1920s until his death in
1984, Poolaw photographed various
tribes and captured the transition of
his people from the teepee into houses
and from traditional dress to
European-style clothing. He based

much of his work in Oklahoma and
extensively documented his own tribe,
the Kiowa.
While some of his photos were sold
on the streets as postcards and were
eventually reproduced without his per
mission in history textbooks, most of
the negatives being developed here as
part of the Kiowa Ethnography Project
have never been printed before.
Poolaw later turned to other profes
sions like farming and ranching, but
he never stopped taking pictures of
his people.
In one photo, a Native American
man stands in full headdress and trade

cloth draped over his shirt and tie.
Next to him is a Native American
woman wearing a buckakin dress with
the signature short hair of the 1920s
and 19305.
Students involved with the project
come from various backgrounds. They
include Native American, Asian, black
and Peruvian students, and comprise
what instructor Linda Poolaw, the
photographer's daughter, called "a
little United Nations."
Janine Jones, a junior, describes the
class as an opportunity she would not
have been able to pass up. A photog
raphy she is part Native Amer

ican and felt the class with its artistic
and ethnographic aspects "seemed per
fect" for her, she said.
"The significance [of the project! has
a lot to do with working with some
thing that hasn't been examined by a
large group of people who have put
their stamp of approval on it. That's
what we're doing," Jones said.
She also noted that before coming
to Stanford, she wasn't culturally con
nected to the Native American side of
her heritage. The class has inspired
her to investigate her own family in
upstate New York.
For Jones, though, the most im
portant aspect of the project is its
value as a great body of work.
Race doesn't factor into it."It is
a unique view of something you
don't get to see. You don't need
to be [of any one race] to learn
something from it," she said.
Susan Kalter, a junior in Eng
lish, took the class to complement
the English and American literary
canon of her Her interest
in Native American history drew
her to the class as well.
"I want to bring these things
into the open for the general
public to see and discuss," Kalter
said.
She said the opportunity to do
something concrete rather than
abstract also excited her.
"This has a concrete outcome.
For a lot of us in the class, it's
one of the first things we do here
where we can work and produce
something," Kalter said.
Linda Poolaw remembers that
for her father, photography was
a mystery.
"It was nothing like his culture
had taught him. His people could
be preserved," Poolaw said.
Preservation, Poolaw pointed
out, became increasingly impor
tant as the government took Na
tive Americans out of their
teepees into houses and onto a
course of white acculturation.
"Dad saw a lot of things leaving,
going away. In his lifetime, he
saw everything happen to his
people," she said. "He saw
storytellers disappear and televi
sion come. I don't know if he
thought about the importance [of
the photos]. But he preserved
something for us."

The members of the class plan
to print all 1,500 negatives, some
of which measure 5 inches by 7
inches and some 4 inches by 5
inches, and select the best prints
for an exhibition, which is slated
for sometime next year.
According to Larry Holloway, a
professional photographer in
volved in making a visual and au
dio history of the project, the
students hope to finish printing
before the end of this quarter.
This time frame would allow the
students to bring selected photos
on a trip to Oklahoma in January
to trace tribe members who might
remember and identify the sub
jects.
The class emerged out of the
efforts of Ewart Thomas, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, to pro
vide more Native American
studies at Stanford. According to
Charles Junkerman, assistant
dean of undergraduate studies,
the project is a way of putting
some Native American curricu
lum in place.
Junkerman termed the class "a
collaborative effort of the Art De
partment, the Anthropology De
partment, and the School of
Humanities and Sciences."
Linda Poolaw was able to come
to Stanford as a resident artist
through the Department of Resi
dential Education.

and ethnographic aspects "seemed per

"The significance [of the project! has
a lot to do with working with some
thing that hasn't been examined by a
large group of people who have put
their stamp of approval on it. That's
what we're doing," Jones said.
She also noted that before coming
to Stanford, she wasn't culturally con
nected to the Native American side of
her heritage. The class has inspired
her to investigate her own family in
upstate New York.
For Jones, though, the most im
portant aspect of the project is its
value as a great body of work.
Race doesn't factor into it."It is
a unique view of something you
don't get to see. You don't need
to be [of any one race] to learn
something from it," she said.
Susan Kalter, a junior in Eng
lish, took the class to complement
the English and American literary
canon of her Her interest
in Native American history drew
her to the class as well.
"I want to bring these things
into the open for the general
public to see and discuss," Kalter
said.
She said the opportunity to do
something concrete rather than
abstract also excited her.
"This has a concrete outcome.
For a lot of us in the class, it's
one of the first things we do here
where we can work and produce
something," Kalter said.
Linda Poolaw remembers that
for her father, photography was
a mystery.
"It was nothing like his culture
had taught him. His people could
be preserved," Poolaw said.
Preservation, Poolaw pointed
out, became increasingly impor
tant as the government took Na
tive Americans out of their
teepees into houses and onto a
course of white acculturation.
"Dad saw a lot of things leaving,
going away. In his lifetime, he
saw everything happen to his
people," she said. "He saw
storytellers disappear and televi
sion come. I don't know if he
thought about the importance [of
the photos]. But he preserved
something for us."

The members of the class plan
to print all 1,500 negatives, some
of which measure 5 inches by 7
inches and some 4 inches by 5
inches, and select the best prints
for an exhibition, which is slated
for sometime next year.
According to Larry Holloway, a
professional photographer in
volved in making a visual and au
dio history of the project, the
students hope to finish printing
before the end of this quarter.
This time frame would allow the
students to bring selected photos
on a trip to Oklahoma in January
to trace tribe members who might
remember and identify the sub
jects.
The class emerged out of the
efforts of Ewart Thomas, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, to pro
vide more Native American
studies at Stanford. According to
Charles Junkerman, assistant
dean of undergraduate studies,
the project is a way of putting
some Native American curricu
lum in place.
Junkerman termed the class "a
collaborative effort of the Art De
partment, the Anthropology De
partment, and the School of
Humanities and Sciences."
Linda Poolaw was able to come
to Stanford as a resident artist
through the Department of Resi
dential Education.
In the darkrooms of the Stanford
Art Department, students in Anthro
pology 126 are recreating a part of the
past.
With access to 1,500 negatives taken
by Native American photographer
Horace Poolaw, they are looking at
one man's view of a changing culture.
From the 1920s until his death in
1984, Poolaw photographed various
tribes and captured the transition of
his people from the teepee into houses
and from traditional dress to
European-style clothing. He based

much of his work in Oklahoma and
extensively documented his own tribe,
the Kiowa.
While some of his photos were sold
on the streets as postcards and were
eventually reproduced without his per
mission in history textbooks, most of
the negatives being developed here as
part of the Kiowa Ethnography Project
have never been printed before.
Poolaw later turned to other profes
sions like farming and ranching, but
he never stopped taking pictures of
his people.
In one photo, a Native American
man stands in full headdress and trade

cloth draped over his shirt and tie.
Next to him is a Native American
woman wearing a buckakin dress with
the signature short hair of the 1920s
and 19305.
Students involved with the project
come from various backgrounds. They
include Native American, Asian, black
and Peruvian students, and comprise
what instructor Linda Poolaw, the
photographer's daughter, called "a
little United Nations."
Janine Jones, a junior, describes the
class as an opportunity she would not
