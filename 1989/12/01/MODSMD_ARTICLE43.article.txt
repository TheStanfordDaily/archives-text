# New SCLC revives Standard discussion
## 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
The new members of the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
officially renewed discussion of
the Fundamental Standard in
their first 1989-90 meeting last
night, though no concrete answers
emerged in the free-speech-vs.-
freedom-from-harassment debate
that caused so much controversy
last year.
The council, which was delayed
in meeting this quarter because
of problems in finding a new
chair, is charged with ruling on
a revised interpretation of the
Standard proposed last spring by
Law Prof. Thomas Grey. The pro
posal arose in response to several
racial harassment incidents at
Stanford in the last two years.

The meeting began with an in
troduction of the new members
— including the new chair, Law
Prof. Robert Rabin — and a
review by Sally Cole, the Univer
sity judicial affairs officer, of the
events surrounding the activity of
last year's council. The council is
composed of five students and five
faculty representatives.
John Perry, professor of philos
ophy, explained the revision of
Grey's first proposal, which dis
turbed many in the Stanford com
munity when it was released last
March. The new proposal is
separated into two parts — a spe
cific "fighting words" statement
and more explanatory second sec
tion, according to Perry.
Although the mtyority of the
current debate over the Funda

mental Standard centers on racial
harassment, Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. Tom Kane sugges
ted that issues of drug and alcohol
abuse may be more relevant.
"I'm of the opinion that we
should drop the discussion of ra
cial harassment, but everyone else
should have their say first," said
Kane, who has served on the coun
cil for three years.
Kane expressed reservations
that the council could not legislate
against the expression of emo
tions. Senior Constantino Pena
argued that the Fundamental
Standard should nonetheless try
to provide a measuring stick by
which to judge harassment cases.
Perry noted that a problem
arose in the past when the Uni
versity acted under the residential
contract rather than the Funda

mental Standard. "Stanford is
punishing people with the housing
agreement, not the Fundamental
Standard," he said, referring to
incidents at Ujamaa and Otero
Houses where students were
removed from their dorms be
cause they violated their housing
agreements, but were not charged
with Fundamental Standard vio
lations.
Among other issues touched on
were the applicability of Grey's
proposal in reverse-discrimination
cases, and the question of punish
ing for intent vs. effects.
The council agreed to meet
early next quarter, and hopes to
discuss its questions with Grey
and other constitutional law ex
perts such as Law Profs. Charles
Lawrence and Gerald Gunther.
