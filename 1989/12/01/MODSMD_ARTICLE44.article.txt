# Expert predicted Oct. 17 earthquake through the 'seismic window'
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
Relating the number of missing
cats and dogs in classified adver
tisements, geological insight on
the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and
calculations of high tides seems
difficult all in one speech.
However, geologist Jim
Berkland accomplished that feat
last night at Kresge Auditorium
in a talk on his methods of earth
quake prediction.
Berkland is known for his
prediction of the Oct. 17 earth
quake and claims he has foretold

240 other quakes since 1974. His
method involves calculating the
"seismic window," an eight-day
period of time in which there is
a probability that an earthquake
will occur.
"This is not mythology or
astrology; this is science," said
Berkland, who calculates his seis
mic windows by the phases of the
moon and the proximity of the
sun and moon to the earth, which
causes higher tides. The high tides
release strain upon the faults on
the earth's crust and overcomes
friction resistance movements,
causing quakes to occur, he said.

Berkland said the occurrence of
the sky darkening and the earth
shaking at the crucifixion of Jesus
is a possible example where the
eclipse of the moon related to the
occurrence of a quake.
He even relies on the reactions
of animals to predict earthquakes.
Dogs and cats are especially sensi
tive to changes in the earth's mag
netic field, which will occur
several days before an earth
quake, he said.
The disturbances will cause
dogs and cats to run away from
home, he said, causing the num
bers of lost pets in the classified

ads to skyrocket. Berkland com
pared the reaction of dogs before
an earthquake to how they react
during Fourth of July fireworks.
He explained how his own cat,
Rocky, disappeared a few days
before four different earthquakes
from the late '70s to the early
'80s.
A 1958 UC-Berkeley graduate,
Berkland has studied geological
hazards for the past 31 years. He
was recently asked to take admin
istrative leave from his position
as a Santa Clara County geologist,
perhaps due to his co-workers'
dislike of his methods, he said.

"I'm batting about a .750
predicting earthquakes," said
Berkland, who remains confident
of his theory, despite the reactions
of doubting geologists.
"I am suprised at the difficulty
of explaining my methods to fel
low scientists. ... I have been ac
cused of being lucky so many
times. I find the concept of luck
to be rather mystical ... some of
my scientific colleagues who need
to call upon luck need to have
their credentials examined."
Berkland predicted that the
next earthquake between a mag
nitude of 7.5 on the Richter

scale will strike the Bay Area
within two to five years. A up
coming minor earthquake of mag
nitude 3.5 to 5.5 will occur in the
Bay Area between Dec. 10 and
Dec. 17, according to Berkland's
seismic window calculations.
"At no time do I think I have
all of the answers of earthquake
prediction, but I do have a couple
of pieces of the puzzle which
others need to examine," he said.
Last night's lecture, which was
sponsored by the ASSU Speaker's
Bureau, was attended by about
60 students and community mem
bers.
