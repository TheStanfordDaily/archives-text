From the looks of the chain-link and
barbed-wire fence around Columbae, won
dering if the kitchen stove still works may
seem slightly overdue.
Nonetheless, Columbae is one of a group
of Row and cluster houses scheduled for
overall inspection this week. Director of
Housing and Food Services Keith Guy, how
ever, said he was "not sure" about whether
they would actually include Columbae in
the review.
In fact, the review — which will even
tually encompass all student residences and
food service facilities on campus — is en
tirely unrelated to the earthquake. "We've
been trying to get this done for over two
years," said Guy. "We know that there are

things that need fixing in Lag(unita) and
Branner, while in Rains it won't be for
another 10 years," he said.
Housing and Food Service has hired
ISES, an outside consulting firm, to do
the audit.
"The inspections will look at every build
ing from top to bottom," said Guy, who
explained that plumbing, electrical and ven
tilation systems as well as foundations and
structures will be assessed. Eighty percent
of student rooms will be reviewed.
"We are developing a comprehensive list
for each building so that we can plan for
things breaking down," said Guy. "We want
to develop a 10- to 20-year plan," he said.
Although the review has already begun,
the engineers will not enter student rooms
during Dead and Finals Weeks.
