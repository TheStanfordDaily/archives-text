A computer was stolen from the ASSU
Lecture Notes office Tuesday between 5
and 7 p.m., according to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
However, there were no signs of forced
entry to the office, Niemeyer said.
Workers at Lecture Notes say the door
was locked when they left, according to
police records. When Lecture Notes man
ager Burt Loosmore returned later, the
door was propped open, and a Macintosh
SE computer, which was not secured to a
table, was missing.

Niemeyer said the lack of evidence of
forced entry indicates that either the door
was not actually locked or that the thief
had a key.
The only people who should have keys
to the office are the project manager
(I-oosmore), the ASSU business manager
and Council of Presidents members, ac
cording to ASSU business manager Sandra
Leal.
Police have no other clues at this time,
Niemeyer said.
The computer was used to keep files and
records for the lecture notes service, Loos
more said, noting that Lecture Notes has
copies of most of the information on the
computer.
