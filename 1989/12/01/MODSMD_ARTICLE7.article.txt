# George Schultz:
## Central Europe's 'dam has burst' 
### Patrick Rollins 
Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
said yesterday that "the dam has burst" in Central
Europe, and the changing political condition is some
thing Westerners should be "exuberant about."
Speaking before a crowd of about 60 at Haus
Mitteleuropa, he said the leadership in Central Eu
rope finally "saw that their societies are sick, and
to prosper, they must change their ways," he said.
Shultz, now an honorary fellow at the Hoover
Institution and a professor at the Graduate School
of Business, said Americans should appreciate the
revolutionary changes in Central Europe, but added,
"Let's not get in the habit of saying things are
perfect" and thereby lose sight of problems at home.
"Despite what's happening there, the first thing
on our plate is to do as well as we can here," he said.
He called upon allies of the United States to
proceed "energetically forward" to help the Euro
pean countries as they loosen the yoke of commu
nism.
Addressing the widely debated issue of a possible
reunification of East and West Germany, he said,
"In a de facto sense, these people . . . are reunified,"
citing the fact that the borders between the two
countries are now open. The opening of the borders,
he said, permits the free exchange of information,
money, ideas, and "unfortunately, drugs," he said.
Shultz said borders do not have the same meaning
they did 40 to 50 years ago, largely because the
arrival of the information age has nullified them.
According to Shultz, the biggest problem facing
East Germany is the need to establish its
"legitimacy" as a sovereign state, one that "shows
it's there because the people want it there."
