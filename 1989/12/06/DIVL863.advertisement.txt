J—/very book is the end result of a writer's
unique vision. A bookstore is, however, more
than a collection of books, it is a unique
composite, a personal statement and
a reflection of community.
Kepler's Books and Magazines thanks the
communities of the Mid-Peninsula for their
support over the years.
We moved into our new location on
Sept. 1 st, and in the last three months we have
adapted to our new store. We are confident that
a beautiful environment and expanded space
will help us be the bookstore we want
to be: unique, community oriented,
and independent.
Best wishes for the holidays, and
Happy New Year!
We hope to see you soon.
