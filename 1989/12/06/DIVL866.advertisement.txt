Holiday
Greetings
To The Stanford
Community
We want to thank everyone at
Stanford — students, faculty and staff
— for the extraordinary contributions
you have made in the weeks following
the earthquake. As we approach the
holidays, we share this community's
gratitude for its good fortune in
weathering that disaster; and we look
forward to the partnership that will
bring us together in the task
of recovery.
We hope that you and your families
will be blessed with a safe and joyous
holiday season.
Donald and Robin Kennedy
