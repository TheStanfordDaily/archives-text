"I've been shopping at health
foods stores since the early
70s, and I used to have to go
to several places to get what I
needed. Not any more.
Whole Foods is a wonderful
blend. I can do all my
shopping, I know the quality
is there, and the people are
wonderful. But most of all, I
just like the atmosphere of
the place. There's a spacious,
open feeling that makes you
feel good. I look forward to
coming in here."
