Editor's note: The following are excerpt* from journals chronicling
the experiences of two students who were in the Dance Heritage
class.
From journal entry number one, fill Antonides (after watching
Cunningham's dance company perform "Inventions" with a score
by fohn Cage in Berkeley this September)
What I realized when watching "Inventions" was that I was
viewing dance with music very differently than dance without
music. I was giving dancers credit for emotional height and tension
that rightfully belonged to Cage. I realized that most notably while
watching a woman executing slow turns during a "silent" part of
the piece. Suddenly, a tone in the score started, and my initial
reaction was, "Wow, all of a sudden, she's dancing with so much
more meaning...
"She isn't doing anything different," I immediately chided myself.
The music added another layer of complexity, resulting in my
heightened emotional tension.... So I was exposed in all my
subjectivity and chance modes of interpretation.
From journal entry number three, fill Antonides
There's one thing about Cunningham that I'm somewhat con
fused about — the "great paradox" that the critics talk about
regarding his work, between his spontaneity and his demand for
rigorous discipline.
Well, I don't think there's a paradox at all. I say Cunningham's
work is in a way as planned AND as spontaneous ... as any
dance work ever done I think art by its nature is deliberate;
it cannot be spontaneous. In trying to think up a work of spon
taneous art, I imagined someone walking along and suddenly
tripping, and then deciding to spin around on her back and do a
few cartwheels. That's spontaneous ... but is it art?
From journal entry number four, Sairus Patel
I don't see any scrambling happening yet; the movements are
unbelievably technical — just the kind of creative-ballet stuff I
think is not my "type." ... And what is my "type?" Is it the kind
of dance/movement I can do easiest or mindlessly? Or should it
reflect the kind of person I am, or think I am?
