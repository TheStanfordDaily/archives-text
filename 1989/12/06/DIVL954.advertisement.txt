### 
THE UNDERGRADUATE ADVISING CENTER
PRESENTS
Am I cut out to be an Engineer?
♦ Considering an engineering major?
♦ Feel like physics or calculus is genetic, but not in your family?
♦ Wondering what industrial or mechanical engineering actually is?
♦ Concerned that your double major in electrical engineering and physics might not be worth it?
♦ Just curious about why 1/5 of Stanford's undergraduates decide to major in engineering?
If you find yourself asking any of these questions, or others remotely similar, then the Undergraduate Advising Center can
give you the answers.
In addition to our regular advising staff, you'll find a new engineering peer advisor interested in helping you get the
facts as well as talking about your concerns.
Call the UAC at 723-2426 to make an appointment, or stop by the UAC on the first floor of Sweet Hall.
