# Students get break because of the quake

No students will automatically be put on academic
probation based on their academic record this quar
ter.
In response to the Oct. 17 earthquake, the Office
of the Registrar has decided to "find the most
flexible reading of the existing policy," University
Registrar Sally Mahoney said.
The reading means that dropping below nine units
this quarter will not automatically lead to academic
probation. Instead, students will be evaluated over
a span of three quarters: spring 1988-89, fall 1989-90
and winter 1989-90. Students will only risk academic
probation if they have fallen below the 36-unit
minimum over the three quarters.
Students already on academic probation will also
be evaluated at the end of winter quarter before
any further actions are taken. Entering students'
records will be evaluated following winter quarter,
based on a two-quarter span.
This reading of the policy will apply to all students,
not only those who lost their housing in the earth
quake. "Some students were physically displaced,
some had families in trouble," said Mahoney. "Some
students have needs that we can't see. We're not
focusing only on displaced students," she said.
Following the earthquake, the Committee on Ac
ademic Appraisal and Achievement, which includes
faculty, student and administration representatives,
decided to extend the deadline for declaring the
pass/no credit option.
"Students seemed very glad about this extension,"
said Mahoney. About 600 students opted to modify
their grading options, many students reduced units,
and five students stopped out mid-quarter as a
result of the earthquake.
Although students were requested to write
"earthquake" on the back of drop forms where it
was relevant, Mahoney said no "blanket" rulings
will be made regarding academic loads affected by
the earthquake, and probation decisions will still
be made on a case-by-case basis.
Mahoney said she will know next quarter exactly
how many students took advantage of the flexible
probation policy.
