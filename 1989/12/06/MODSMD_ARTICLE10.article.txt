# Student and roommate use computer to forge Stanford IDs
## 
### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
Tipped off by a Daily article about
ink on the new Stanford identification
cards rubbing off in people's pants pock
ets, they realized the IDs were printed
on something like a LaserWriter, and
thought, "that would be pretty easy to
copy," recalls Geoff Engman, a senior
in biology.
Engman and his roommate, Seth
Schneider, who is not a Stanford stu
dent, have used several Macintosh pro
grams to create an exact facsimile of a
Stanford ID that can be personalized.
"We started talking about all the
things you can do with a Stanford ID,"
Engman said. Schneider cites large dis
counts on computers at the Stanford
Bookstore, admission to campus libra
ries and parties and easier check cashing
as some of the benefits.
"The best thing is, I know some
Grateful Dead people who would love
to have more IDs," Schneider said.
Though Schneider and Engman joke
about the "potentially huge market" for
fake IDs among "Paly High students"

and others, they say their real purpose
in making the IDs is twofold: to raise
awareness of the ease with which the
cards can be duplicated, and to raise
money by printing the ID image onto
T-shirts and selling them in White
Plaza.
"We wanted to create awareness; this
is so easy to do and it could be used
wrongly," Schneider said. He said they
had made fake ID cards to show Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and
Registrar Sally Mahoney to alert them
to the possibility of forgery.
Schneider said the two were also able
to obtain real names and ID numbers
of Stanford students by photocopying
the sign-up list for unofficial transcripts

in the Old Union lobby. Although the
Registrar's Office was closed when they
went by, the list was left lying on the
counter in the lobby.
Schneider, a computer programmer
for a local company, said he made the
IDs using the Macintosh programs
Freehand, Image Studio and Digital
Darkroom, along with a scanner and a
LaserWriter. He used the scanner to
duplicate the Stanford seal on the ID.
The serrated edges were produced
using scissors, but looked quite authen
tic. Only the color of the paper and the
type style of the word "valid" differed
slightly from the genuine article.
Schneider said the potential for trans
mission of the false ID file is enormous,
commenting that he could put it on the
Stanford Macintosh Users Group com
puter network or pass it to others on
floppy disks. He added that he did not
intend to do so.
He said the two planned to sell per
sonalized Stanford ID T-shirts in White
Plaza, but they first have to obtain a
license from the Office of Technology
Licensing for the use of the Stanford
name.
