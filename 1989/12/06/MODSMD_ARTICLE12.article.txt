## Trapped foreigners freed 
### 
MANILA, Philippines (AP) —
Government and rebel forces
declared a temporary cease-fire
today and began evacuating
Americans and other foreigners
from hotels in the financial dis
trict where they had been trapped
for four days during a coup at
tempt against President Corazon
Aquino.
Vicky Benito, a receptionist at
the Manila Garden Hotel in the
Makati district of the capital, said
this morning that the rebels were
freeing Americans.
"All Americans are safe," she
said. "The Americans are all
0.K."
Yesterday, a rebel officer said
the estimated 215 Americans
might not be set free because of
U.S. support for Mrs. Aquino dur
ing the uprising, including pro
viding air cover in the opening
hours of the revolt.
"1 just want to report that we
have successfully evacuated the
tourists and the guests here at
the Manila Garden," said Nar
zalina Lim, an undersecretary of
tourism. "I hope the other hotels
will follow suit."
Max Motchmann, a West Ger
man expatriate who helped in the
negotiations, said the rebels and
government forces agreed to a

cease-fire until the evacuation is
complete. He expected the opera
tion to be complete by midday.
He said rebels were allowing
only two buses at a time to enter
the battle zone. They were shut
tling back and forth between the
hotel district and a staging area
a short distance away.
Manila radio stations said about
nine busloads of foreigners had
been taken out of the fashionable
Makati suburb.
About 2,000 foreigners were
believed trapped in the hotels and
apartments in the area, which the
rebels seized Saturday on the sec
ond day of their coup attempt.
But officials said the figure was
an estimate, and they had no firm
idea how many foreigners were
actually there.
Safe passage for the trapped
foreigners was delayed yesterday,
although hundreds of others
living in the district were able to
flee to safer areas amid the most
serious coup attempt so far
against Mrs. Aquino, who took of
fice in February 1986.
Scores of Americans arrived
yesterday at the U.S. Seafront
housing compound, where U.S.
Marines were on guard. Others
moved to hotels near Manila Bay,

about five miles west of the fight
ing.
At least 77 people have been
killed and more than 540
wounded since rebel soldiers
launched the coup attempt Friday.
Rafael Alunan, undersecretary
of tourism, negotiated for hours
yesterday with the leader of rebels
in Makati. The talks at the Inter
continental Hotel ended at sunset,
and Alunan said they would con
tinue today. The rebels offered
Monday to let the foreigners
leave.
Capt. Albert Yen, one of the
insurgents, said "the intention is
not to release Americans."
"U.S. meddling has caused the
failure of the first wave of our
assault, so we hold them liable,"
Yen said. "It is the responsibility
of the U.S. government if we take
their nationals hostage."
On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom
jets flew air cover for loyalist
forces, without firing on the
rebels, and prevented insurgents
from continuing air strikes from
Villamor Air Base.
Yen said the rebellion was
codenamed "Seven Days and
Seven Nights in December," and
would involve a seven-stage oper
ation.
