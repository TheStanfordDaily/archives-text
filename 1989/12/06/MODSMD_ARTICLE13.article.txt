# Former East German leader placed under house arrest
## 
### 
EAST BERLIN (AP) - Erich Honecker
and other disgraced former leaders were
put under house arrest yesterday, the
government disarmed the Communist
Party's private army and the chiefs of
the once-feared secret police resigned.
East Germans, furious about past cor
ruption, surrounded secret police offices
in several cities to stop further destruc
tion of documents that could be used to
prosecute Honecker, who was party chief
for 18 years, and his former lieutenants.
Under Honecker, the secret police were

the main instrument for keeping people
under control. The official news agency,
ADN, reported last night that its 19 top
officials resigned but that the new chief,
Lt. Gen. Wolfgang Schwanitz, would
remain in office.
Schwanitz has criticized the organiza
tion's past role in crushing dissent.
Guenter Wendland, the chief prosecu
tor, also resigned following allegations
that he was unfit to lead corruption in
vestigations. Wendland was a holdover
from the Honecker era.

Communist Party leaders appealed for
calm to avoid "anarchy and chaos" in a
nation that, in two months, has seen the
dismissal of two sets of leaders, mass
pro-democracy protests, the historic
opening of its borders and promises of
free elections and other reforms.
The Interior Ministry said the gover
nment was disarming the "fighting
groups," party-run militias based in fac
tories.
It said the weapons taken away in
cluded automatic rifles, rocket-propelled

grenades, anti-aircraft guns and armored
personnel carriers.
Western estimates said the militias had
3,000 active members but could draw on
reserves of 500,000.
On Monday, militia officers had urged
the rank-and-file to break their oath of
loyalty to the Communist Party.
In Czechoslovakia, the army began Sat
urday to disarm the Communist Party's
paramilitary People's Militia, which was
created 40 years ago to protect factories
from counterrevolutionaries. Opposition

leaders had demanded the militia be dis
banded.
Authorities placed Honecker and other
former top officials under house arrest
yesterday in their luxurious Wandlitz
compound north of East Berlin. The com
pound has become a symbol of past cor
ruption and abuse.
"The former general secretary (of the
Communist Party) and president, Erich
Honecker, is among those who are not
allowed to leave their houses in the ele
gant compound," ADN reported.
