### 
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) —
Crash investigators said yesterday
that a Colombian jet carrying 107
people disintegrated in a fireball
two weeks ago, moments after a
bomb blew a hole in the fuselage
and flooded the passenger cabin
with fuel.
The disclosure came hours after
a judge investigating drug traf
fickers was assassinated, the
fourth judge killed in 15 weeks.
The government did not say
who planted the bomb under a
strategically located seat in the
15th row of the Avianca Airlines
Boeing 727, which was bound for
Cali from Bogota.
But suspicion immediately fell
on drug lords who targeted
schools, hotels, restaurants and
other public buildings in bom
bings throughout Colombia after
the government declared war on
illegal drug operations last Au
gust. The 201 bombings have
killed 29 people and wounded 238.

Authorities assume the traffick
ers are trying to force the gov
ernment to stop extraditing
Colombian drug suspects. Presi
dent Virgilio Barco's administra
tion has sent nine suspects to the
United States since launching its
anti-narcotics offensive.
Minister of Government Carlos
Lemos told a news conference yes
terday the airliner bomb "is per
haps a sign of what lays ahead"
for Colombia. Lemos is acting as
president while Barco is on a state
visit to Japan.
Flight 203 exploded minutes
after taking off from Bogota's in
ternational airport on a Nov. 27
domestic flight, killing all aboard.
Investigators said a bomb blast
ruptured the fuel tank in the right
wing.
"The bomb was placed strategi
cally under seat 15F, which is very
close to the fuel tank that burst
and caused the fire the destroyed
the aircraft," the director of the

Civil Aviation Authority, Yezid
Castano, told reporters.
"Around an emergency door
there is evidence of an outward
force of such power that objects
inside the plane were blown out
at 20,000 feet per second."
Police sought a mystery man
suspected of planting the bomb,
Castano said. He said one of two
men who had reserved seats 15E
and 15F returned to the Avianca
counter after passing through se
curity.
The man had purchased two
tickets, one for himself in the
name of Julio Santodomingo, the
other in the name of Alberto
Prieto. "Prieto" stayed aboard.
"Santodomingo" left the Avianca
counter and vanished.
On Tuesday, Judge
Bernardo Jaramillo Uribe was
shot dead on a stroll in Medellin,
hub of this South American coun
try's drug trade.
