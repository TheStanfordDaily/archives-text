Israel slays infiltrators
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli soldiers yesterday
killed five heavily armed Arab guerrillas who
crossed the border from Egypt and planned a
"spectacular" terrorist attack to mark the anni
versary of the Palestinian uprising, the army said.
The clash in the Negev desert occurred before
dawn when an Israeli force encountered the five
guerrillas and gave chase. The soldiers killed all
the guerrillas in the hilly area of Mount Harif
and suffered no casualties themselves, the army
said.
The guerrillas carried Soviet-designed Kalash
nikov assault rifles, 51 hand grenades, a pistol
with magazines, binoculars and wire cutters, and
were on their way to a "spectacular attack" in
Israel, the army said.
Vilnai said the guerrillas' equipment "shows
that they simply meant to kill. Not to argue too
much, not to carry out a hostage-taking operation,
but a killing operation."
American woman charged
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — A Con

necticut woman, in whose backyard police found

thorities.
Jennifer Casolo, 28, spent more than four hours

to military Judge Guillermo Romero.
Casolo, a native of Thomaston, Conn., and a
former Seattle resident, has spent nearly five
years here as the representative of Christian Ed
ucational Seminars, a San Antonio-based organ
ization.
Most expensive Bible
LONDON (AP) — A 1,000-year-old Hebrew
Bible sold for a world record auction price of
$3.19 million yesterday in London, Sotheby's said.
Yecheskel Toporowitch, identified only a resi

Bible, which is believed to have been written in
the Jewish community in Babylon in the 9th or
10th century.
Sotheby's said it was the highest price ever
paid for a Hebrew manuscript and the second
highest price for any manuscript.
