## Building the decade 
### 
Stanford has been at
the cutting edge of
change in the decade

IF NOTHING ELSE, the 1980s
have proven that Stanford is
not an isolated ivory tower. The
University and its students have
played an important and influential
role in confronting and resolving
many of the critical challenges
facing society.
Stanford has demonstrated ad
mirable foresight in recognizing
emerging trends and embracing
key developments in their early
stages.
The decision to join the Macin
tosh consortium back in 1984
transported Stanford students in
just six years from composing
papers on typewriters to employing
the latest technology on the mul
titude of Mac lis around campus,
providing a quantum leap in edu
cational innovation.
In last spring's ASSU elections,
elections officials took the bold and
unprecedented step of designing a
completely computerized election.
The leadership qualities of our
community have extended beyond
the realm of the computer-chip
revolution to the challenge of con
structing a truly pluralistic
community. While we have seen
vivid examples of tension and con
flict, the University has consis
tently moved forward toward the
ideal of a multicultural community.
Student of color organizations
have served as important catalysts
by raising important, if
troublesome, issues. The adminis
tration, to its credit, has played an
active role in introducing more di
versity into the curriculum and
creating the University Committee
on Minority Issues.
Another example of Stanford's

leadership during the '80s is the
emphasis placed on public service
and social responsibility by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
and others on campus.
As the administration challenged
students to serve the public, so too
did students challenge the admin
istration to demonstrate its social
responsibility by not supporting
South African apartheid with Stan
ford's investments.
Much of the debate over
America's priorities, direction and
values took place at our campus.
Governance of the Hoover Institu
tion and a proposal to locate the
Reagan library here brought sig
nificant amounts of politically
charged controversy.
Student politics as well tended
to mirror developments of the so
ciety at large. In the ASSU, two
political parties emerged as stu
dents with divergent views of stu
dent government tried to maximize
the effectiveness of their efforts.
Because Stanford's issues and
struggles have placed the Univer
sity on the cutting edge of critical
national issues, the eyes of the na
tion have watched our efforts un
fold here.
Time magazine, The New York
Times, the Wall Street Journal and
ABC News Nightline have all fo
cused on various Stanford issues,
while key national figures such as
Jesse Jackson and former Secre
tary of Education William Bennett
lent their voices to Stanford
debates.
While the past decade has not
been without its share of disap
pointments, frustrations and em
barrassments, the overall lesson is
that talented and committed people
at Stanford working together for
the common good can help make
progress for the nation.
The 1990s and Stanford's second
100 years offer tremendous chal
lenges and immense opportunities
to leave our mark on the world.
