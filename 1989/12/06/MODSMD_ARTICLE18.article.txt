## Alcohol should be banned or controlled in Stadium 
### 
THE DAILY'S EDITORIAL, "A
semi-dry Stadium" (Nov. 29)
expresses a commonly held point
of view: that people can be "jarred into
acting responsibly." I'm not sure how
selling beer in the Stadium will ac
complish this, especially in light of
your observation that "some people
will drink heavily at pregame tail
gaters".
Availability of alcohol impacts con

the more people will drink it. If "too

as an occasion to get drunk . . . and

um? Do we really consider alcohol as a
necessary ingredient to watching a
football game?
There are those who would consider
a football game a "high-risk" situation
given the sheer number of people
present, the potential for violence and

injury, and the fact that significant
numbers will drive home after the
game. In this situation, consumption of
alcohol is unsafe.
According to David Price, associate
commissioner of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, most other campus stadiums in
the Pac-10 do not allow alcohol to be
sold or brought in. Many professional
stadiums that sell it at concession
stands have instituted responsible
beverage-service practices.

kinds of problems relating to violence
at games, as well as concern for fans
driving home after drinking several
hours at the game.
If we do decide to serve beer at
concession stands, I think it is prudent
to consider implementing a responsible
beverage-service program. Such a
program includes developing clear
policies regarding how, when, where
and to whom alcohol may be served.
The goal is to reduce the inherent
risk surrounding the service of alcohol.

Lower risk practices include using
smaller size cups, limiting the number
of drinks sold to one per customer per
occasion, no vending in the stands,
training servers to recognize the signs
of intoxication (it is illegal to sell to an
obviously intoxicated person) and in
tactful ways to refuse service, strict
enforcement of minor drinking age and
setting a price high enough to dis
courage increased consumption.
Alcohol is not a soft drink; it has
potent effects and should be treated
accordingly. The Stanford community
must ask itself some hard questions
about how much we are willing to pay
for the use of a drug that has clearly
caused a great many problems, not the
least of which is the transformation of
an enjoyable social function into a
collection of alcohol-related incidents.
