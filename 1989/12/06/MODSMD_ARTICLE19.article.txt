# SCAAN promotes limited view of El Salvador issue
## 
### 
Recently something has reached our
attention that disturbs us greatly. On
occasion, we have noticed a shortcom
ing by certain organizations to make a
well-rounded and diverse presentation
of both facts and opinions regarding
issues that the particular group may
be advocating.
Foremost in our minds are the ac
tions of Stanford Central American
Action Network. SCAAN's attempts to
promote political and social awareness
on campus regarding the situation in
El Salvador, for example, have resulted
in nothing mores than a constant
stream of one-sided information aimed

toward influencing students as they
endeavor to take a standpoint on the
current events in this country.
This past Tuesday night, SCAAN
jointly sponsored a presentation made
to the Stanford community by a repre
sentative of FMLN, the left-wing guer
rilla faction in El Salvador.
Unfortunately, however, it is doubtful
that a representative of the other fac
tion in El Salvador, the democratically
elected government, will be offered the
opportunity to present its perspective
in the same manner.
It is true that in order to be truly
informed about a subject, one must be
exposed to all the facts. Yet it is dis
turbing to realize that many members
of the Stanford community are forming
ideas from limited, and oflen-times
very biased, information.
Students should be encouraged to

challenge that which they hear, realiz
ing that only when one has been ex
posed to the full perspective that in
volves input from all sides, can a re
sponsible and intelligent decision about
what standpoint to take on an issue be
made.
We would urge the Stanford commu
nity to realize that the opinions that
have been expressed by SCAAN and
the FMLN representative regarding the
current situation in El Salvador are
but one of many, and that before we
may take an intelligent standpoint
and/or make a statement, we must
first hear and examine the others.
