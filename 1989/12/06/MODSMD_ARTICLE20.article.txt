# And by the way...

We are four lonely political science
graduate students who are saddened to
hear how cynical Malinda McCollum
has become about dating (Nov. 29). To
make our own small contribution to
the solution, we would like to invite
McCollum out on a date.
She can find us anytime in our base
ment office in the Political Science
Department and is welcome to go out
with all of us, just one of us, or any
combination thereof!
