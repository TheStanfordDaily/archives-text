## Not defining the decade 
### 
IT WAS 10 YEARS ago on New Year's
Eve. My friends and I crowded around
the radio listening to Casey Casern's
year-end Top-40 countdown. "My
Sharona," the number one song of 1979,
had already been played. Now Casey was
preparing to announce the decade's top
tune. And the number one song of the
'70s was (drum roll) . . . "You Light Up
My Life."
I'm not proud of it, but I ushered in
the '80s and ended my first nine years
of existence by listening to Debbie Boone
wail, "It can't be wrong when it feels so
right."
Now, a decade later, that magical time
has arrived again, and everyone is drool
ing with anticipation about marking the*
momentous occasion when the '90s begin.
Columnists are eagerly compacting the
past 10 years into two double-spaced
typed pages. One Stanford writer got so
worked up about his chance to assess the
'80s that he actually said Ronald Reagan
was the most successful president of the
20th century.
Magazines are publishing retrospec
tives highlighting the most impressive of
the decade's inventions, like NutraSweet,
mousse, Trivial Pursuit and Pee-Wee
Herman. And Duran Duran is releasing
"Decade," an album of their greatest hits
since 1981.
I can kind of understand all the hype.
Marking the end of the decade is like
watching the great odometer of life roll
over. Who doesn't want to gather their
loved ones in the car and shout it to the
world when the "9" slowly flips to "0"?
Quietly noting the change while driving
alone to Safeway just isn't as much fun.

But this incessant need to sum up the
'80s with a few concise paragraphs is
starting to irritate me. First of all, the
decade is getting trashed. People paint
the past 10 years as an orgy of
materialism, greed and moral disintegra
tion.
The '80s are as villified as the '60s
are idealized. Junk bonds, AIDS,
fluorocarbons and a more-than-trillion
dollar deficit don't have quite the same
ring as free love and flower children.
Admittedly, some awful things have de
veloped in the past 10 years. But progress
has also occured. It's ridiculous to think
that the events of 10 years can be
generalized into an all-encompassing label
for a random designation like a decade.
Personal and public experiences during
this time differ so greatly that it is futile
to attempt to create a singular definition
of the period.
For instance, I spent most of the '80s
trapped in the great vacuum called
elementary and secondary education. I
remember the outfit I wore to school the
first day of seventh grade better than I
do the stagflation that was occuring in
1982. I even liked Reagan for the first
half of the decade â€” that is, until I
developed a conscience.
My personal characterization of the
'80s as "The Basically Fun and Carefree
Decade" would probably not coincide with
many who lived through the same time
period.
Differences in perceptions of the past
10 years are everywhere. People in the
inner cities probably won't look back at
the '80s as the period when car phones
and Reeboks were all the rage. The af-

The events and experi
ences of the past 10 years
are far too diverse to
shrink into a simplistic
label like the '70s' 'Me
Decade.'

fluent probably won't remember the past
decade as a time of drastic cuts in social
programs and a stagnant minimum wage.
Formulating a cohesive idea of what
the '80s legacy is or will be is close to
impossible. The events and experiences
of the past 10 years are far too diverse
to shrink them into a simplistic label like
the '70s' "Me Decade." Any kind of as
sessment of such a broad category is
bound to be lacking. The decade label is
practically meaningless.
It's not very exciting to think about
the '80s as just another 10-year span in
history. But if it's thrills you're looking
for, just tune into Casey's countdown with
me December 31 and discover if "Beat
It" will win out as the number-one song
of the decade.
