## Jackson's six-month saga small price to pay for multiculturalism 
### 
EVER SINCE I came to Stanford,
I have worked to make my
university a better and more
multicultural institution. As a student
of African-American history, I have
known about and willingly committed
myself to paying the price for progress:
creativity, hard work, commitment and
personal sacrifice.
Last fall, when a series of racist
incidents swept through Ujamaa, I was
personally dismayed because this dorm
has been my home for three years.
After the incidents, I focused my ef
forts on trying to achieve justice for
my community.
Despite my efforts and the efforts of
many others, the University chose
instead to put the issue of freedom of

speech above the issue of freedom of
harassment, even though the clear and
present danger stemmed from numer
ous incidents racial harassment.
At the same time, my ability to
pursue my own academic aspirations
was hindered by the lack of support
for my intellectual interest, Afro-
American Studies.
These and many other concerns left
me no choice but to become involved in
the peaceful occupation of Kennedy's
office last spring. I was aware that it
took bold and dramatic action in the
1960s to create African-American
studies programs and to raise Univer
sity sensitivity to issues of racism and
pluralism. It seemed that it was time
once again to act in that tradition.

The day of the protest was terrifying
because I was forced to confront doz
ens of riot police, but at the same time
empowering because I witnessed the
strength of a rising student movement.
When the riot police arrived on the
scene I was scared and visions of
Selma, Birmingham, Mississippi and
Los Angeles came into my mind. When
my friends began to be loaded onto the
riot bus, I forsaw a potential violent
conflict.
It was then that I knew someone
would have to take a risk and pay the
price for justice. As I spoke, I saw the
police videotaping me, but I wanted
the demonstration to remain peaceful,
and I did my best to see that things
did not get out of hand.

I have paid the price for justice:
academic difficulty, family anxiety,
emotional stress and financial
hardship. I hope that this price is
enough to buy more African-American
faculty, more African-American courses
and a greater commitment to the
issues of multiculturalism.
I have been moved by the demon
stration of concern and supported by
the hundreds of people who stood with
me on May 15 and who continued to
stand by me as I pursued a just and
fair resolution to my case.
That is perhaps the most positive
aspect of the past six months. There is
now a large and dedicated community
of people committed to making our
vision of multicultural education for a

multicultural society a reality.
I accept the consequences for my ;
actions. My ordeal of the past six •
months is a small price to pay knowing
that future generations of Stanford I
students will be able to benefit from|
the emerging multiculturalism at Stan
ford. I am confident that there now'
exists on the campus an improved I
atmosphere for negotiation.
