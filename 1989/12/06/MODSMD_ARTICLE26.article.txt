## German professor emphasizes obstacles of unification 
### Jennifer Schmid Editorial staff 
Visiting Prof. Hanns-Dieter
Jacobsen has just returned from
a trip to his hometown of Berlin
and he's brought back souveneirs.
Jacobsen takes two foil-wrapped
rocks from the drawer of his desk
and says with a smile: "Pieces of
the Berlin Wall."
Then he smiles a little more.
"Be careful, the Wall has asbestos
in it — that's why the pieces are
wrapped." He finally laughs, and
shares the humor of a cancer
causing agent built into the infa
mous Wall: "It's Honecker's
Revenge!"
Jacobsen, who is teaching in
Stanford's Political Science de
partment for the 1989-90 school
year, has a great sense of humor
when dealing with a very sensitive
subject, namely the opening of
East German borders and the im
plications this has for East-West
relations.
Jacobsen knows his subject
well, for he is a professor of po
litical science, specializing in the
international political economy, at
the Free University of Berlin.
Aside from stints in the United
States, including fellowships at
Harvard University and at the
Smithsonian Institution in Wash
ington, D.C., Jacobsen has lived
in Berlin for over 25 years, mov
ing there just three years after
the Wall was erected.
The German expert says he was
as surprised as anyone else when
the East German government sud
denly opened its borders Novem
ber 9. In fact, Jacobsen says, he
gave a speech in October in which
he said there would be no real
changes after Honecker stepped
down. "I guess that shows you
even experts are wrong!" Jacobsen
laughs.
Jacobsen terms the recent
events in East Germany, "The
first successful revolution in Ger
many." He elaborates further on
this idea: "The West Germans got
democracy as a gift, the Marshall
Plan and all that. The East Ger
mans, on the other hand, had to
work for what they have.
"It's a big question — what do
you have when you remove
socialism from East Germany?"
Jacobsen says the answer to
this is not "national identity,"
which the East Germans have not
yet achieved, but "national pride."
The East Germans, he states, are

In Jacobsen's view,
East German citizens
are more interested in
keeping the countries
separate, and pursu
ing a form of demo
cratic socialism.

proud of what they have accom
plished, and even view the idea
of a unified Germany as a "gloomy
opportunity."
He says there are naturally
East Germans who are more in
terested in capitalism, but on the
other hand, there are many who
dislike the idea that East Ger
many could be "bought out" by
the larger, economically stronger
West Germany.
In Jacobsen's view, East Ger
man citizens are more interested
in keeping the countries separate,
and pursuing a form of democratic
socialism as found in European
countries like Sweden.
The West German attitude is a
different story, and here Jacobsen
speaks not just as a professor of
political science, but as a West
German citizen who has observed
the rapid changes in his country.
While not necessarily agreeing
with these views, Jacobsen says
recent opinion polls taken in West
Germany indicate that 70-80 per
cent of its citizens would like some
sort of East-West unification.
Asked about potential hardships
for the West Germans, Jacobsen
says the average citizen may not
fully be aware of the economic
strains that would occur in the
West Germany economy. He spec
ulated that once the West Ger
mans realize the implications of
unification — including strains on
housing, the job market and social
security payments — they may
prefer the granting of funds and
credit that the West German gov
ernment is proposing.
Jacobsen says that West Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Kohl is
speaking of unification with the
next elections in mind. His ruling
party, the conservative Christian
Democratic Union, faces increas
ing competition from the radical
right-wing Republican Party,
which had surprisingly strong
election results in both Berlin and
Munich last year.

As a result, the Christian Dem
ocratic Union is shifting farther
toward the right, where calls for
unification are always part of the
political agenda.
Jacobsen says a fact which is
largely ignored in the American
press is that German calls for uni
fication are always qualified by
ackowledgements of European in
terdependence. Kohl, for instance,
speaks of unification with the in
sistence that "it must take place
within a united Europe."
Kohl naturally is aware that
other European nations such as
France are wary of the idea of a
united Germany, and with 1992
just aound the corner, the Ger
mans cannot afford to jeopardize
European integration, according
to Jacobsen.
He notes that only recently U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker
said a German unification would
have to occur "on the basis of
Western values." "But this makes
the whole idea impossible!" says
Jacobsen, since the Warsaw Pact
countries would never accept a
"Westernized" united Germany.
"I don't think any of the allies
are really interested in unifica
tion."
A further problem arises from
reminders that Germany still is
not a fully sovereign nation. The
Allied Forces from World War II
still have a large degree of power
in determining the Federal Re
public's future, not to mention the
unusual status of Berlin as an
occupied city. Jacobsen says
reminding the German people of
this situation increases their
feelings of nationalism, which ex
plains the increase in conservative
voting patterns. The increase in
nationalism, according to Jacob
sen, is a trend which the Allies
should perhaps be concerned with,
considering the disastrous results
of German nationalism in the
19305. The potential for German
nationalism is still there, he says,
as evinced by a shift toward the
right of the entire German polit
ical spectrum.
Asked about the future of East-
West German relations, Jacobsen
has no difficulty in replying. He
will be considering questions like
these for the remainder of the
year, as he is teaching classes on
both overall East-West relations
and specifically on East German-
West German relations this winter
quarter.
Jacobsen, who was trained as

an economist, quickly points out
that beyond all the political ma
neuvering which is taking place,
there are substantial economic
problems which must be solved
as well.
An example he gives is the prob
lem of the official exchange rate,
which has always been set at a
1-1 ratio by East Germany. Jacob
sen says the black market value
of a West German mark is actually
somewhere between 10 and 20
East German marks, however.
Since the border is now open
for East German citizens to pass
freely to the West, a citizen could
now cross the border to take a
part-time job in West Germany
and be paid up to 450 West marks
per month without legally needing
to declare this income. The East
German could then exchange the
money at a rate of 1 to 10 or
better, and return to East Ger
many to "live like a king," says
Jacobsen.
In order to solve this problem,

"There will have to be reform to
make the Ost mark convertible,"
he says. Jacobsen notes that the
West German government is con
sidering granting huge funds to
East Germany to stop the ex
change of East German goods for
cheaply acquired East marks.
Such a grant will occur, according
to the West German government,
only when free elections take
place. Jacobsen says"he has no
doubt" elections will take place
sometime next year.
Jacobsen says financial assis
tance from the West is crucial be
cause without outside help, the
East German economy will con
tinue to deteriorate and lose fur
ther economic competitiveness.
About 150,000 citizens have left
the country just this year, and
this creates labor problems not
just for East Germany, but also
for West Germany which must ab
sorb them into its workforce.
Already this realization is
sinking in, as the emotional jubi

lation settles and the economic
problems remain. Jacobsen says
that already during his trip to
Berlin last week, the celebrations
were calming down.
Lest this prognosis sound as
"gloomy" as the thought of uni
fication, Jacobsen offers a more
optimistic side to the recent
changes in East Germany. With
the promise of free elections and
the opportunity to travel un
restricted, he points out, there is
no longer a political reason to
leave the country.
In Jacobsen's view, the East
German citizens "have a new hope
in East Germany and for this rea
son will decide to stay."
"Right now people in Berlin are
crossing the border to do a little
shopping and observe capitalism
firsthand. Afterward, they return
to their homes (in East Ger
many)," he says.
"In my opinion, despite the
problems, the future East Ger
many will boom economically."
