If you've missed some
familiar names in the pages of
The Daily this quarter, it's prob
ably because of the high number
of Daily staffers who are study
ing abroad. The following are
reports by The Daily's foreign
correspondents on life at six of
Stanford's eight overseas cam
puses.
Although not everyone got a

chance to help tear down the
Berlin Wall, each is reaping the
unique benefits that their over
seas experience has to offer: a
look at the world beyond the
Farm, an opportunity to meet
and mingle with the natives, the
affirmation that there is cuisine
out there beyond Food Service's
wildest dreams, excursions to all
corners of Europe, increasing

fluency in a foreign language,
the humbling experience of
being the outsider and the thrill
when you finally feel like you
fit in.
So, check out what these
reporters have to say and then,
as Overseas Studies would ad
vise, Go Away! and experience
the world for yourself.
