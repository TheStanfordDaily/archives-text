# Bitter goes better with chips in Oxford, or was it lager?

### Rob Burwell Special to The Stanford Daily 
OXFORD, England — Have you
ever wanted to live in a country
where fries are called chips, chips
are called crisps, "z" is pronoun
ced "zed," and zero is "naught?"
Have you ever wanted to live
in a scale replica of San Jose's
Winchester Mystery House?
Have you ever wanted to study
at the same university as Dudley
Moore, William Golding, Michael
Palin (of Monty Python fame) and
just about every other famous
Briton you can think of?
The students in the Stanford
Programme in Oxford do all this
— and more — every day.
All 52 students, and one British

resident assistant, live at the Stan
ford Center on High Street, Ox
ford's main strip. The dormitory
is actually five buildings with the
walls knocked out between them,
and consequently, there is roughly
one staircase per student.
It is not unusual to have to go
up four staircases and down three
to get to your room. One quirky
spiral staircase actually goes up
one flight clockwise and the next
counterclockwise.
Students live in singles, doubles
and triples overlooking either a
street that is busier (and louder)
than University Avenue, or the
Center's modest garden and lawn.
The rooms are often shaped in
rather bizarre ways, especially the
floors which are always at some

strange angle.
Oxford, a city as well as a uni
versity, lies about 50 miles west
of London in more or less the
center of England. It is a remark
able old city, founded in roughly
the 10th century. Many of the
older buildings here were built
centuries before Columbus set
sail, and the newer ones stood
years before Leland and Jane
Stanford ever met.
The Stanford students here are
divided roughly evenly among
four Oxford colleges: Brasenose,
Magdalen (pronounced Maudlin),
St. Catherine's and St. Edmund
(Teddy) Hall.
The RA, Jon Crews, is a fourth
year student at Brasenose "read
ing" (the Oxford word for

studying) chemistry.
Students' affiliations with the
colleges are limited to dining
privileges, the right to use the
college's Junior Common Room
and to participate in the college
clubs and sports teams. No aca
demic work is done through the
colleges.
Students take four meals a week
at their colleges and pay for the
rest of their meals with their
biweekly meal allowances, paid
out in cash. Food at the colleges
makes Food Service seem like
Mac Arthur Park. Actual dishes at
Brasenose (the college considered
to have the best food) have in
cluded "Toad in the Hole,"
"Spotted Dick with Custard,"
(honestly) and "Gammon steak
with vinegar sauce." Potatoes
come with every meal and cucum
bers are found on every sandwich.
Like the Stanford Programme
in Palo Alto, the work load at
Oxford varies from person to per
son, but overall, most would agree
that the workload at the Oxford
center is considerably more chal
lenging than back on the Farm.
At Oxford, midterms and finals
are unheard of — papers are the
end-all of academic life.
A moderate-to-heavy load
would consist of an eight-page
tutorial paper each week and
roughly three eight-page papers
for each of two other classes.
The centerpiece of the students'
coursework here is the tutorial —
a weekly or biweekly one-on-one
meeting with a regular Oxford
professor, or "Don" as they are
called. Students can arrange
tutorials on almost any subject,
from the Cold War to Hamlet.
Tutors usually ask their students
to write an eight-page paper every
week, and students then read their
papers aloud to get immediate
feedback from the tutors.
The rest of a student's academic

load consists of courses offered
through the Oxford center. Two
classes, concerning the Middle
East, are taught by Stanford As
soc. Prof, of History Joel Beinin.
Beinin is teaching here for just
one term and will be back in Palo
Alto to teach a seminar winter
quarter.
In fact, many of the students
here decided to come this term
so they could take the more ad
vanced of the two classes which
Beinin teaches.
Other classes offered include an
art history course taught by the
director of the Stanford program,
Geoffrey Tyack, a modern drama
class, and a philosophy class called
"Values, Ethics and Law."
Some students have also en
rolled in regular Oxford seminars
offered through St. Catherine's
College. The most popular of
these is the Shakespeare seminar
taught by Michael Gearin-Tosh, a
well-liked Oxford professor.
Field trips are also an important
part of any Oxford experience.
The first week of the term con
sisted of trips organized through
the center to London, Avebury,
Warwick and Stratford upon
Avon. Trips to art museums are
a required part of the art history
class.
Many people take advantage of
Oxford's three- and four-day
weekends to take trips to other
parts of Britain, as well as Paris
and Amsterdam.
Although the work load is dif
ficult, and the weather slightly
less mild than in California, most
students make the effort to go out
to pubs or college butteries as of
ten as possible.
English beer is excellent and
very different from what you
would find at a Stanford frater
nity party. It comes in three main
varieties: Guiness, Bitter and
Lager.

Guiness, the opposite of light
beer, has roughly the consistency
of 30-weight motor oil, but has a
reputation for being rather tasty.
Bitter is a mild dark beer with
an aftertaste reminiscent of coffee
ice cream. Most British lagers are
imported, the most popular of
which are Carlsberg and Foster's.
Students usually find that the
best way to meet Oxford students
is through clubs or college sports.
Rowing is by far the most popular
college sport among the Stanford
students, evidenced by the con
stant chatter about boats, 6:30
a.m. outings and the dreaded Erg
machine. In fact, all 10 students
affiliated with Brasenose did
either some rowing or coxing this
quarter.
Some especially athletic or en
ergetic students have also gone
out for University level sports.
Three play volleyball, one swims,
three play water polo and two
women have decided to subject
themselves to the rigors of the
women's varsity rugby squad —
regarded as the best in England.
Many students were involved
with the production of "Trap
pings," Stanford's entry in the Ox
ford Cuppers Drama competition.
The play, written and directed by
junior Thomas Clyde, won awards
for acting, directing and writing.
Other students are involved in
the orchestra here at Oxford in
cluding seniors Sue Soong and
Paui Chin. Chin played last
month in the Sheldonian Theater,
a building designed by Sir Chris
topher Wren.
News of the Oct. 17 earthquake
hit many students here hard, es
pecially those with families in the
Bay Area. People were up all night
trying to put calls through to the
area, but they were met consis
tently with a message that said,
"Due to the earthquake, many
phone lines are out of order. . . ."
