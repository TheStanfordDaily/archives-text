# Cathedrals, pasta abound in Florence

FLORENCE, Italy — For some, Florence
is the medieval world of Dante, feuding
families and 12th century towers. Dotted with
art-filled churches, rich palaces and the works
of Michelangelo, the city is referred to as the
"Heart of the Renaissance." And, tourists rec
ognize its famous cathedral, Ponte Veccio
Bridge and expensive shopping streets.
This quarter, 33 Stanford students call
Florence home. a
Studying at a 14th-century campus perched
over the Arno River and just feet from the
Ponte Veccio, Stanford students cannot com
plain that they are far from the action. And
with hundreds of n useums, churches, palaces,
cafes, boutiques and a train station within
one's reach, the scenery rarely gets dull when
books are put away.
Glancing out the library window at the
spires of the Palazzo Veccio and the cathedral
clocktower, one wonders if the San Francisco
earthquake was just a bad dream. No drinking
age, 100,000 lira bills, weekly excursions and
a relatively light workload are reality — but
Memorial Church in shambles?
The present for the "Americani" includes
classes held in the heart of Florence — a
breathtakingly beautiful city. •
"Incredible," said senior David Telander.
"When I walked in, I couldn't believe it."
Senior Dana Anderson added, "I love being
right on the river. Stanford is a little utopia
and you can get stuck on campus. Here you're
forced to go out and deal with others."
As opposed to the Farm, where most stu
dents live with friends and attend a variety
of classes spread around campus, the tempo
rary Florentines board with locals around the
city and choose from eight classes given in
one building.
While living around the city forces students
to get out and around a little, being in the
same building, sometimes for an entire day,
can be limiting. One can surround oneself in
classes, campus life and fellow Americans and
forget to take advantage of being in Italy. And
after 8,000 acres of the Farm, having classes
on one floor of one building is almost
claustrophobic.
"I haven't had all my classes in the same
place since grammar school," junior Michelle
Pearl said.
Italy is the theme word for academics. In
addition to one and a half hours of Italian
per day, students choose from Italian art his
tory, Italian political science, Florentine his
tory and Italian literature.
"Classes are more focused here and are all
on Italian life and culture — but that's what
you're here for," Telander said.
Most students are excited about class sizes.

The biggest class — Tuscan art history —
totals 32 students, Etruscaty art has three and
the remainder fall somewhere in between. Get
ting to know professors is much easier than
at Stanford — for good or for bad.
"Classes are long and intimate," senior Mi
chelle Donahue said. "You can't hide, espe
cially in Italian." ;m
"The professors here are all so great because
they're quirky. They're all cult figures," added
junior Susan Infantino.
Classrooms and books are not the only
sources of learning, however. Experiencing
Italian culture through direct involvement is
stressed, and field trips are an integral part
of the curriculum. In addition to field work
throughout Florence, art history students take
weekly trips to museums and churches, in
cluding excursions to Siena and Assissi.

'It's interesting trying to 4
play a sport in another
language.' #

Discovering Italian life through meeting
Tt&lian students, going to Florentine hangouts,
attending popular events such as soccer games,
and traveling are all considered pa|rt of
■ "school." All the students spent three days in
112 Rome and most travel somewhere in ; Italy
©very weekend. Pisa, Milan, San Gimiagno
and Cinqueterre are all considered part of the
extended campus. L
For some, local learning takes place via
usual Italian social activities — chatting at
cafeg, cruising shopping streets and hanging
out in bars and clubs.
A few students have investigated more di
verse offerings of Italian culture. Anderson,
a former swimmer, decided to broaden her
athletic horizons and join the rowing club.
Seniors Heather Westwater and Kristin
Sweeny decided to clieck out the national pas
time and joined the women's soccer team.
Senior Ricnard Green teaches jazz dancing,
and senior Dana Young attends pottery
classes. Air, of course, participate with
Italians, speaking Italian.
"It's interesting trying to play a sport in
another language," Westwater said. "But
everyone is totally friendly."
Can one word say it all? Incomparable is a
try. Italian food is not just a meal, it is an
art, and the Florentine students are taking
full advantage of the culinary offerings of
Italy. Both lunches by Graziela at the campus
and dinners with families are veritable feasts.
Pasta two times a day? No problem when
there are 25 types of noodles and hundreds

of sauces. And when it is followed by a main
dish, vegetable, dessert and bread you know
you are not going to have to order a Domino's
pizza to make it through the night. Getting
up from the dinner table is the only problem
here.
Macaroni and cheese, Monterey casserjole
and unidentifiable hamburgers are replaced
by fettucini bolognese, homemade minestrone
soup, penne with prosciutto and roasted
chicken. "Op a scale of one to 10 food service
breaks into the negatives in comparison," said
junior Martha Cocke.
Mausoleum bashes and dorm parties simply
do not exist. You cannot kick back with some
friends in : your room with a few brews and
a blaring itereo. Partying Italian style is quite
different than raging in California.
The Italian of partying is so different
V- it doeen'tnnAn getting drunk. You go to
bars or cafes ;ind sit and drink and rap. You're
not running all over the place," Infantino said.
Bear is not exactly Italy's strong point, but
with the Chianti region just 10 miles south
it's no wonder Florentines are a wine drinking
population.
Along with pitchers of beer, most bars sell
wine by the Dottle. BYOB means bring your
own bottle — red or white — not Coors Lite
or Bud.
Most Stanfordites, however, are 15 to 30
minutes from the center of the city, and with
buses that stop at 12:30 a.m., partying is not
always an option. "It's so much more mellow
here than Stanford," said Liao Cassanova. "It,
takes an effort to go out and do stuff at night,
plus dinner is so much later (8:30 p.m.) that
you end up just hanging around a lot."
The pace of life is much slower than in
America* Everything closes for two hours for
lunch, phone calls take time to go through
and dinner can last two hours. This can be
enjoyable but it does take an effort to adapt.
"Never before have I finished lunch and said,
'I think I'll write some letters,' " junior Dan
Vernon said.
The lack of campus life has also been a
shock for some. Tnere are no football games
or athletic facilities, dance troupes or clubs
associated with the campus. European uni
versities are strictly learning institutions,
quite a change from the all-encompassing
Farm. Florentines are also introverted people
and are difficult to get to know at first. Lan
guage i3 not a problem, but while their Italian
rapidly improves, most Stanford students find
themselves speaking English a majority of the
time.
For most, however, pasta, vivoli gelato and
a great cultural experience outweigh the
sacrifice of keg parties, football games and
VCR3. Fitting in does take more of an effort
than on the Farm, but all 33 agree it is time
well spent. Firenze va bene.
