# Alleged victim located
## Reported assault may have involved Stanford students 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
Police have located and interviewed the
14-year-old who was allegedly the victim
of an Oct. 6 sexual assault at the Delta
Kappa Epsilon house, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The victim was forcibly "grabbed, kissed
and fondled" by a white male in the second
floor bathroom of the Deke house, she told
Sgt. Christopher Lefferts and Deputy Kath
leen Strehl in an interview Friday at her
Palo Aito home.
The girl told police the incident did not
occur in a stall, as others had alleged, and
that there were four or five other men in
the bathroom who did not attempt to assist
her, Niemeyer said.
According to Niemeyer, the investigation
"indicates that the students there were
probably Stanford students." The girl did
not say the students were from the Cali
fornia Polytechnic State University, as pre
viously reported.
Last month, a Pacific Grove woman who
attended the party told University officials
and The Daily that she spoke with the girl
that night. Much of the information the
police had prior to contacting the girl was
based on this woman's story.
The girl was 13 at the time of the incident
but has since turned 14.
The police found the alleged victim after
receiving two anonymous phone calls and
talking to a Gunn High School official.
According to Niemeyer, the girl said she
arrived at the party alone but later met
two teenage friends, Eric and Doug, who
had told her about the party. The two men
are not Stanford students.
She entered through the front door of
the Deke house without being questioned
or checked for identification, she said.
Police stressed that she is "very young
looking."
Deke president Mike Nakashima said, "It
might have been possible that she just
walked in, but I find that hard to believe."
The girl also told police that she served
herself beer from a keg at the bar.
According to Nakashima, there were

people behind the bar all night. He added
that the possibility of her serving herself
is "questionable."
The girl said she danced with a white
male between the ages of 18 and 20 who
is of medium height and weight. He has
dark brown medium-length hair and was
wearing a light pink coral necklace and a
light blue, long-sleeved shirt with a logo
on the back. She described him as a "surfer
type."
Later that night, she talked with the
individual upstairs. He took her into a
room, which turned out to be the men's
room, and he grabbed her. She tried to
leave, but he wouldn't allow her to go, she
said.
He kissed and fondled her, but they did
not have sex, the girl said.
Shortly afterward, her friend Eric came
into the bathroom and escorted her out,
she said.
Soon after the incident, she talked to Jill
Salak, a Pacific Grove resident. Salak later
wrote a letter to Stanford authorities al
leging a sexual assault had occurred.
The alleged victim told police that much
of the story had been blown out of pro
portion by people who have talked to the
press.
"The investigation will continue in an
effort to identify the suspect. It appears to
be a child molestation case," Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer said the police will notify the
girl's mother, who was not present at the
time of the interview. Police will also notify
Child Protective Services to obtain coun-
