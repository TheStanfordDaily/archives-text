# Trying to experience the 'normal' Berlin
## 
### Burke Smith Special to The Stanford Daily 
BERLIN — Many of the stu
dents attending Stanford's West
Berlin campus this fall can only
imagine what a "nonnaT quar
ter here is like. The breakneck
pace of developments in East
Germany, especially since the
opening of the border to East
Germans on Nov. 7, has over
shadowed many of the normal
pursuits of Stanford students
in Berlin.
Describing how life changed
after Nov. 7, junior Mario Reza
said, "Classes were completely
secondary. It was utterly more
important to go out and expe
rience what was going on."
Reza and other students also
noted the flexibility of the pro
fessors in the program, who al
lowed students time to
experience the incredible
changes taking place here.
But certain aspects of the
program have remained the
same despite the political
whirlwind swirling around Ber
lin.
West Berlin's nightlife has
remained just as hopping as in
the past, though an additional
aspect of festivity has been
added. "It is such a contrast
from campus because you can
do anything at any time,"
junior Scott Hines said. Most
nightspots in the city stay open
past 4 a.m. and many stay open
all night.
Students have visited the
opera, the theater, museums,
dance clubs and punk, jazz and
rock concerts — often hitting
many different spots in the
same evening.
Of course most of this activ
ity takes place within a differ
ent culture, and usually in a
different language. The initial
fluency level among the stu
dents here really varied, from
none to very good.
Junior Mike Leetmaa said
that when he arrived in Ger
many, he "pretty much had for
gotten a lot of it (his German)."

'Classes were
completely sec
ondary' after the
border was
opened.
— Mario Reza

Although Leetmaa said he has
picked up enough German to
"get by," he adds that he still
is not completely comfortable.
Students with a better back
ground certainly have an easier
time understanding and com
municating, but in the first few
weeks everyone learns enough
German to survive.
Because of the varying levels
of proficiency in German, most
of the non-language classes in
the program are taught in Eng
lish.
Just as language ability
varies among students, so do
living arrangements. Four
Stanford students and two Ger
mans live on the top floor of
the Stanford villa in one-room
doubles, with the advantage of
convenience since classes are
also held thereT.
Th* rest of the Stanford stu
dents live with families, stu
dents or landlords throughout
the city, although West Berlin
has a pretty stiff housing short
age — especially with the influx
of East Germans — and it has
become increasingly hard to
find places for students tolive.
Many Students who drcided
to live outside said
they dici so in gain
contact with Germans.
Junior Cliff Lam lives with
a single mother and two
children in a three-bedroom
apartment. "I have chats with
them (the family he lives with)
every now and then over cof
fee," he said.
