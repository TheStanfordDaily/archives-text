# School seems secondary with Paris swirling around you

### April Pearson Special to The Stanford Daily 
PARIS — Imagine yourself strolling
down a cobblestone street at 5:30 in the
morning after dancing the night away,
buying the first croissants out of the
oven of the closest boulangerie and then
dipping them into hot chocolate at a cafe
that's just opened. All of a sudden, you
realize that you have roughly 10 papers
in French to do before February. C'est
la vie (such is life) at the Stanford pro
gram in Paris.
At first the lack of work is deceiving
but by the time the middle of November
rolls around, you realize you have to limit
your gung-ho Paris nights. A Stanford
student's life here is intense, balancing a
demanding work load with the desire to
take advantage of all that Paris has to
offer.
Stanford's nerve center in Paris, the
office of Resident Director Estelle Halevi,
is located close to the Latin Quarter, the
heart of intellectual Paris and student
life. Stanford Art Prof. Paul Turner of
fers his History of Paris architecture
course there, the only available course
in English.
International Relations majors take
classes at the prestigious Institut Des
Sciences Politiques, while literature stu
dents can sample courses throughout the
University of Paris.
The students are officially enrolled at
Jussieu, or Paris VII, one of the Univer
sity of Paris' 13 schools. However, they
are free to take classes anywhere in the
system, limited only by their initiative
and level of proficiency in French.
While picking classes at the Institut
Des Sciences Politiques is relatively
simple, finding the "right" literature
course is difficult.
The worst part about selecting courses
is working with French administration,
notorious for ignoring, snubbing or con
fusing students. The notion of customer
service is not very widespread in France.
The complicated Paris libraries are but
one example of difficult administration.
As junior Garrett Scott puts it, "I've been

abused by so many librarians SUK
dents regularly groan about
French libraries that are inaccessible on
Sundays and have a card catalog system
that makes Socrates 100k 1 simple. When
requesting a book, one never knows what
to expect: a prompt 20-minute retrieval,
a wave off to "the annex" or a suggestion
to come back the next day.
At "Sciences-Pol," the majority of the
students' classes are with other foreign
ers, mostly Americans. Literature classes
mostly consist of French students, g
Professors are funny, animated and
open. Often well-known in their fields,
they tend to give lectures that are botn
interesting and casual. In general, they
are hospitable to Stanford students but
have a distinct methodology, most want
you to get into a pattern of plans
detailles, or outlines.
In addition to learning a new way of
thinking, studpnts 3re faced with a heavy
work load. "Be prepared to work," said
junior Beth Baltzan.
While not intolerable, classes and dis
cussion sections require serious concen
trated studying. Courses meet at most
once a week or every fifteen days for one
and a half hours. The French equivalent
of discussion sections, travaux dirges
(directed works), are led by French pro
fessors or graduate students hired by
Stanford. The mainstays of TDs, as they
are called, are exposes — oral presenta
tions that are demanded of each student
and then critiqued and discussed.
French classes in general demand a lot
more independence and self-motivation
than their American counterparts. Since
classes are not as frequent, however, one
is tempted to blow off work and go to
museums. This is not a good idea; there
is always more work to do than you
think, because professors assume their
students have a basic knowledge of the
subject, or at least familiarity with it.
Students this year at Sciences-Pol have
wished they knew the basic history of
the European Economic Community or
brought along their macro-economic
textbooks. However overwhelming the
work may seem at times, one has to

remember that, while the experience can
be challenging and humbling, it will turn
out to be rewarding.
French studeots seem to take difficul
ties in stride, lighting up a cigarette and
passing time la cafes between classes.
Unfortunately it's hard to meet natives
bilong to a university sports
clujb. You have to make an effort to meet
French students and then profit from the
times you do meet them.
Obsessed with neatness and aesthetics,
French students tend to dress nicely and
are definitely the "tick-in" type of people.
According to an anonymous Stanford stu
dent, students at Sciences- Pol "dross like
secretaries.*
Referring to a particular French fetish
with school supplies, another Stanfordite
who wished to remain anonymous ob
served, "It seems silly to spend an hour
getting your Holly Hobbie pencil case at
a right argle to your stapler on the desk."
Much to the Stanford students' amuse
ment, French students spend all their time
during lectures either writing every
single word down or underlining their
notes with a ruler.
The students' most direct contact with
the French comes outside of school. Three
students live at the Fondation des Etats-
Unis (U.S. House) of the University of
Paris' international residence campus
with other American and French stu
dents. One student lives in an apartment,
and 16 live elsewhere in Paris with
families — retirees, single mothers or
more typical nuclear families.
Students living with families say they
like the personal attention they can't get
elsewhere. On the other hand, one learns
to become considerate of other people's
needs without compromising one's own.
Dinner usually provides animated con
versations and real insight into the
peculiarities of the French personality.
Argot (slang) is often passed back and
forth, and you get to enjoy an unparal
leled home-cooked French meal. The
French take their cooking very seriously.

action-packed, but is obviously colder, than Palo Alto.
