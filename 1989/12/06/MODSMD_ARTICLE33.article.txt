# Salamanca offers study and siesta by day, dancing 'til dawn

SALAMANCA, Spain - This
university city has as many dif
ferent faces as the motley group
of Stanford students who are
studying here until March 1990.
Salamanca is a city where you
can satisfy your appetite for the
rich style of baroque and
plateresque architecture and then
fill your stomach at a cheap Chi
nese restaurant; where the slow
mail service and bad phone con
nections can make you feel like
you are in the middle of nowhere
and bar-hopping among swarms
of nocturnally active youth can
make you feel like you are in
Party Central; where dormitories
are single-sex and run by religious
orders; and where American
music and movies eryoy incredible
popularity.
Few, if any of the Stanford
group of eight men and seven
women knew quite what to expect
upon arriving. But it did not take
long to find one's way around this
city of 160,000 people. Most na
tives, accustomed to hearing
foreign students' heavily-accented
Spanish, will take the time to give
directions, and then repeat them
if they see a blank stare.
Roughly the size of l'alo Alto,
Salamanca is easily divisible into
old and new zones. Old
Salamanca, encircled by a wide,
busy avenue, is a dense collection
of university buildings, churches,
homes and stores. Divided by a
web of narrow streets, some of
these architectural wonders date
back to the 12th century.
Several small public squares, or
plazas, dot old Salamanca. 1 he
main square, Plaza Mayor, is not
only the physical center of the city
but is a social center as w Â®"-
Salamanca's winter chill and fre
quent rains do not deter scores of
people from strolling through this
baroque structure with four

ground level arcades supporting
three stories of balconied win
dows.
New Salamanca, with business
and residential districts and a few
university buildings, stretches
west, north and east from the his
toric center. This contemporary
part of the city is filled with wide,
orderly streets lined with three
to seven-story apartment build
ings, many of which have the aes
thetic character of Wilbur Hall.
To break up the monotony, how
ever, there are a few parks and
small, open plazas. New
Salamanca's southern zone,
across the famous but visually dis
appointing Tonnes River, is an in
dustrial district with a small
residential area.
Finding Stanford's overseas of
fice in Salamanca means knowing
the location of the program's di
rector, Isabel Criado. A literature
professor at the University of
Salamanca, Isabel, as she is
known here, is rarely found sit
ting in her office. The energetic
director seemingly knows every
thing about Salamanca and can
be found just about anywhere in
the city.
Isabel instantly became a
noticeable presence for the Stan
ford group. She assumed the role
of advisor, mother, professor and
crisis handler. And for Isabel
there is no crisis so big that it
cannot be smoothed out with a
little patience and calm thought.
To aid Stanford students in get
ting over the difficulties of living
and studying in a foreign country,
she emphasizes that "Spain is nei
ther better nor worse than the
U.S.; it's different."
Yes, to say the least, it's differ
ent. For example, for computer
dependent Stanford students,
Salamanca's lack of computers is
different. For students who might
usually utter, "Hey, what's up? n
as they ride past friends in the
Quad, the traditional two kissec

on the cheek and the slow pace
of Salamanca are different.
With a whole nation of people
and customs to get used to, the
Stanford group spent little time
on school work. Weeks passed
before professors handed out any
reading or writing assignments.
Only last month, the Stanford stu
dents in Isabel's contemporary
Spanish literature class received
a list of books.
So with a light academic load
during the first month and a half,
travel was on almost everyone's
mind. Trips ranged from excur
sions to Madrid to voyages to
Paris and Lisbon, Portugal.
Nevertheless, Salamanca does
not just serve as a return desti
nation on train or bus tickets.

There could not be a better or faster way to
learn Spanish. It is incredible how the mind
becomes more retentive when the body is
surrounded by foreign speakers day and
night.

There is an academic load to face.
Most Stanford students here are
currently taking five classes, or
18 units.
University classes range from
sculpture to psychology and from
logic to philosophy. There are
mixed reviews about both the
work load and professors.
Because Spanish students at the
university take year-long classes,
the pace is usually considerably
slower than a comparable class
taught during a Stanford quarter.
There is generally less required
reading as well. A typical univer
sity class period consists of a pro
fessor giving a 50-minute lecture
and the constant scratch of pen
on paper as hunchbacked students
scribble notes at a furious pace.

These notes are what usually be
come the primary study source
for their final exams in June.
But, since Overseas Studies
gets students from this cold region
back in time for the Palo Alto
spring, Stanford students cannot
complete any university classes
here. Therefore there are tutors
for each student or group of stu
dents who takes a university class.
The tutor, not a university pro
fessor, assigns and grades work.
The tutor can also help lift away
that musty veil of confusion that
can close in on a student after a
lecture or reading assignment.
Not all contact with the univer
sity is related to the classroom.
There are open sign-ups for sports
and tournaments ranging from

soccer, this country's passion, to
chess, another popular pastime.
Be it ever so humble during the
day, Salamanca's night life can
hold its own with bigger Spanish
cities. The young crowd's noctur
nal playground consists largely of
the bars and discotheques in Old
Salamanca, especially along the
Great Way, or Gran Via.
Dressed in everything from
blue jeans to more formal night
wear, thousands of students take
part in bar hopping and disco
dancing each night from Thurs
day until Saturday. The mayhem
usually gains momentum around
midnight and, for the strong at
heart, can last until about 6 a.m.
Ironically, Stanford students
hear a lot of English when they

are out on the town because so
much of the music here is from
the United States or Britain.
Coming from health-conscious
Stanford University, it came as a
surprise to see at least half of the
college crowd reveling with alcohol
in one hand and a cigarette in
the other But one soon learns
that Stanford's fierce anti
smoking stance has not hit home
in most of Europe.
It's helpful to know you can
leave your fake I.D. in the dorm
if you happen to be a minor. The
legal drinking age in Spain is 16,
but bartenders seem to sell a
drink to anyone old enough to
order for himself. If you smoke,
cigarettes are just as easy to buy.
Some of the other forms of en
tertainment include jazz clubs and
a reggae bar. Movies in Salamanca
are usually dubbed from English
speaking countries.
The dormitory is an integral
part of one's stay in Salamanca.
The Stanford women are divided
between three dorms; the Stan
ford men are all placed in one.
As can be expected, each dor
mitory has its own personality
which changes each year. But gen
erally, life in a women's dorm does
not provide as many perks as does
a stay in a men's dorm.
For example, the women's
dorms have curfews ranging from
11 p.m. to 2 a.m. while the men's
dorm has no curfew, the men's
dorm has a laundry service and
maid service while the women in
dorms wash much of their clothes
by hand and must clean their own
rooms. Some women's dorms also
require residents to do house
chores such as to clean off the
trays afler meals.
Some similarities do exist for
male and female dorms, however.
There is a hierarchy in the resi
dences. The veterans usually re
quire the new residents to go
through an initiation period, las
ting from about two weeks to

months. Like initiations at most
fraternities or sororities, the
rituals mix a healthy dose of fun
and embarrassment.
Another similarity is that the
food in the residences can be dis
appointing at times. For a change
of pace, it is possible to work one's
way through Salamanca to find
good, cheap restaurants.
Some sure bets are the Chinese
restaurants in Salamanca which
will fill you up for about $5.
To avoid the unpleasant dorm
food many Spaniards go home for
the weekend, and Stanford stu
dents are apt to accept invitations
to a dormmate's home. A trip to
a friend's house means not only
good food but the chance to get
a look at regular home life.
The Spaniards at the University
of Salamanca come from till over
Spain and from other European
countries. There are also students
in Salamanca from such places as
the Ivory Coast and Japan who
are enrolled in language-intensive
courses. And although most other
American students are in Madrid,
a three-hour bus ride from
Salamanca, it is not too uncom
mon to see Americans when pass
ing through the Plaza Mayor.
Even though no two people in
the Stanford group look at
Salamanca in exactly the same
light, almost everyone agrees that
there could not be a better or
faster way to learn Spanish. It is
incredible how the mind becomes
more retentive when the body is
surrounded by foreign speakers
day and night. Not only is vocab
ulary easier to learn, but distinct
accents also become clearer to
American ears.
The first few weeks seemed to
be the time when everyone in the
group was learning at the fastest
rate. With a little over two months
in Salamanca, many Stanford stu
dents say they are learning at a
slower rate but still retain a great
deal of vocabulary.
