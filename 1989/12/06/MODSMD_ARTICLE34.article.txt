# Shakespeare on campus
## Authentic signature of bard found in library

December 3, 1936
The Stanford Daily
Nathan Van Patten, director
of the Stanford library, an
nounced the discovery of
William Shakespeare's signa
ture in a book of autographs
held by the library.
The signature appears on a
piece of paper pasted into the
book, which contains over 3,000
autographs. While the signa
ture had not yet been chemi
cally analyzed to tests its
authenticity, experts declared
that it seemed genuine upon
preliminary examination.
In an even more amazing
discovery, librarians will soon
announce that they have found
"KAs rule!!!" written by Saint
Augustine among the graffitti
on a Meyer study carrel.

Twenty-five percent of the
women who entered Stanford
in 1932 were married before
their four-year course was com
pleted.
So who said there was no
dating at Stanford?

The Stanford Daily
The Stanford football team
beat UC-Berkeley in the an
nual Big Game 13-7 to clinch
the top spot in the Pacific
Coast Conference and send

them to the Rose Bowl. Stan
ford went on to beat Nebraska
in the Rose Bowl 21-13.
Sigh. ... I guess that's why
they call them, "The good old
days."

December 1, 1970
The Stanford Daily
A survey of Stanford under
graduates reported that 70 per
cent of Stanford students
smoked marijuana at least once
during the 1969-70 academic
year. According to the study,
"It may not be at all out of
line to expect a figure of 80-90
percent for the class of 1971."
The report included stories
of joints being passed out at
dorms as party favors and to
trick-or-treaters on Halloween.
Sounds like there are a few
nervous judges out there right
now thinking about Alan
Ginsberg's rejection by the Su
preme Court for his own college
