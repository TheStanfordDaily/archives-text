# Handicapped teens find friendship at Stanford
## 
### Dan Sommerfield 
Mentally handicapped children
often lead isolated lives, pushing
through childhood with little sup
port from the friends most people
take for granted. Usually their iso
lation only gets worse when they
reach high school.
For some of those high school
students, however, companionship
is on the way. Thanks to a na
tional program called Best
Buddies, there is now a way of
promoting friendship between
mentally handicapped high school
students and their more privileged
peers at colleges and universities
nationwide.
Just established at Stanford,
the program has a simple opera
tional format. A number of stu
dents are matched with the
mentally handicapped students at
a nearby high school. In Stanford's
case, the participating high school
is Palo Alto High.
The students are matched ac
cording to the interests listed on
each university student's applica
tion, and the pair then become
Best Buddies. Buddies meet about
twice a month, in an effort to give
the mentally handicapped stu
dents the type of one-on-one con
tact they sometimes lack. Buddies
can plan or do anything — a trip
to the movies, walk around
campus, meals in the dining hall
— as long as the activity involves
one-on-one contact. In addition,
each chapter provides about six
group activities per year for all
the Best Buddies pairs.
The national program was
started in 1987 by Anthony Ken

nedy Shriver at Georgetown Uni
versity. Since then it has become
incorporated and has spread to
24 other universities, including
Duke University, UCLA, USC and
UC-Berkeley. Unfortunately,
the program at Stanford took
much more time and effort to es
tablish than most other chapters.
According to Dawn Purtee, the
program's University Western Re
gional director, she originally ap
proached the Stanford Democrats,
who declined to handle the pro
gram. She then tried the Owen
House Public Service Center, only
to find it already swamped with
service programs. In fact, only
five people attended the first Best
Buddies meeting.
Since then, however, the con
cept of Best Buddies has grown
more popular. Purtee said she was
excited to see that most of the
interested students at Stanford
had either already worked with
or had a strong interest in men
tally handicapped members of so
ciety. In fact, she said, some of
Stanford's members actually have
siblings or relatives who are men
tally handicapped.
The Stanford chapter of Best
Buddies is currently run by three
sophomores, chapter director
Vanita Bhargava and vice direc
tors Kristin Farr and Amy
Arends. All three are extremely
optimistic about the program and
the chapter members. According
to Bhargava, "There are so many
opportunities for community
service here, while at other Uni
versities, Best Buddies is one of
the few chances to get involved.
But people the here (in Stanford's

chapter) are not just interested in
community service in general, but
in mentally handicapped students
specifically."
The Stanford chapter has so far
matched 15 Stanford students
with mentally handicapped
"Buddies" between the ages of 14
and 21. These Buddies are clas
sified as "educable mentally hand
icapped," which means that,
although they might be seen as
"special students," they are really
members of mainstream society.
According to Jean Ching, the
liason from Palo Alto High's Spe
cial Education Program, many of
the handicapped students have
Down's Syndrome and similar dis
eases.
Purtee, Ching and the three

student directors are interested in
attracting students who will sup
port the ideals of Best Buddies.
The program is not for people
interested in simple one-day out
ings and group programs. Arends
explained: "Best Buddies is more
than a one-day relationship. It's
a continual evolution of a friend
ship."
Added Purtee, "So far with
everybody, it's been a lifetime
friendship, not just for an
academic year."
It would seem, in that case, that
the program benefits more than
just the handicapped. Farr con
firmed this simply: "This program
has the potential to change your
life and the way you look at all
the people in it."

gram. She then tried the Owen
House Public Service Center, only
to find it already swamped with
service programs. In fact, only
five people attended the first Best
Buddies meeting.
Since then, however, the con
cept of Best Buddies has grown
more popular. Purtee said she was
excited to see that most of the
interested students at Stanford
had either already worked with
or had a strong interest in men
tally handicapped members of so
ciety. In fact, she said, some of
Stanford's members actually have
siblings or relatives who are men
tally handicapped.
The Stanford chapter of Best
Buddies is currently run by three
sophomores, chapter director
Vanita Bhargava and vice direc
tors Kristin Farr and Amy
Arends. All three are extremely
optimistic about the program and
the chapter members. According
to Bhargava, "There are so many
opportunities for community
service here, while at other Uni
versities, Best Buddies is one of
the few chances to get involved.
But people the here (in Stanford's

chapter) are not just interested in
community service in general, but
in mentally handicapped students
specifically."
The Stanford chapter has so far
matched 15 Stanford students
with mentally handicapped
"Buddies" between the ages of 14
and 21. These Buddies are clas
sified as "educable mentally hand
icapped," which means that,
although they might be seen as
"special students," they are really
members of mainstream society.
According to Jean Ching, the
liason from Palo Alto High's Spe
cial Education Program, many of
the handicapped students have
Down's Syndrome and similar dis
eases.
Purtee, Ching and the three

student directors are interested in
attracting students who will sup
port the ideals of Best Buddies.
The program is not for people
interested in simple one-day out
ings and group programs. Arends
explained: "Best Buddies is more
than a one-day relationship. It's
a continual evolution of a friend
ship."
Added Purtee, "So far with
everybody, it's been a lifetime
friendship, not just for an
academic year."
It would seem, in that case, that
the program benefits more than
just the handicapped. Farr con
firmed this simply: "This program
has the potential to change your
life and the way you look at all
the people in it."
