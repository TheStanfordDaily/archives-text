## How much for that greenhouse? A lot Global warming price tag might reach trillions of dollars, Stanford prof. says 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Once upon a time, nobody could
lgree on whether the greenhouse
effect was real. Times have
changed.
Now scientists and policy
nakers generally agree that the
i greenhouse effect is very real, that
ncreased levels of such trace
I rases as carbon dioxide and met
lane will absorb sunlight, increa»-
ing global temperatures, perhaps

drastically altering agriculture,
ecosystems and tne shapes of
coastlines.
Despite the concensus, scien
tists publish wildly varying
reports on how much global tem
peratures will change. And be
cause the science is so little
understood, economists are strug
gling to determine exactly how
much the greenhouse effert will
cost.
Operations Research Prof. Alan
Manne, a noted economic

modeler, recently released a study
saying the cost of changing to en
ergy sources that do not contrib
ute as much to the greenhouse
effect would be staggering.
Manne's calculations show that
the minimum cost, based on what
he calls optimistic assumptions,
will be at least $800 billion and
could be as much as $3.6 trillion
through the next century.
"We think we have been sensible
in figuring out what's possible,"
Manne said about the costs he
calculated with colleague Richard
Richels of the Electric Power Re
search Insitute. EPRI, a Palo Alto
company sponsored by the power
industry, funded the research.
The pessimistic calculation is
based on a scenario where energy
efficiency does not increase and
no shifts are made toward cleaner
energy technologies. The most op
timistic, yet still costly figure, is
based on a 1 percent increase in
energy efficiency per year, which
follows the pattern established
since OPEC's skyrocketing oil
prices encouraged conservation in
the 19705.
To perform the calculations,
Manne and Richels assumed a
global temperature rise of 3
degrees Celsius and accounted for
the different levels of carbon
dioxide, released from the burning
of various fuels.
Oil releases relatively large
amounts of carbon dioxide, and
coal releases about 25 percent
more than that per energy unit.
Oil from shale, which President
Carter proposed as the energy
source of the future, emits even
more carbon when burned, almost
double that released from ordi
nary oil. Because of the high emis
sions and the high expense, shale
oil is not often considered a
serious contender as an energy
source in an increasingly
environment-conscious age.
Nuclear energy and solar energy
release no carbon dioxide and do
not directly contribute to the
greenhouse effect. However, nu
clear energy has faced staunch
opposition from environmentalists

worried about radiation leaks and
long-term waste storage prob
lems.
Solar energy, on the other hand,
has enjoyed strong support from
environmentalists, but they say
the United States has not suffi
ciently pushed for research to
make the technology affordable
and widely available.
An intermediate option is using
natural gas, which produces 70
percent more energy for the same
carbon emissions. Because gas is
already used extensively in the en
ergy market, gas would be an at
tractive alternative fuel except
that the limited gas reserves are
dwindling and are not expected
to carry the United States too far
into the next century.
"You can't rely on natural gas
to get you out of this hole," Manne
said.
Manne said none of the options
are godsends barring any techno
logical advances such as fusion,
hot or cold. "It's a very difficult
problem," he acknowledged.
Other environmentalists and
scientists, including Civil Engi
neering Prof. Gil Masters, argue
that at least part of the solution
to the greenhouse effect can be
easily achieved without a trillion
dollar price tag.
Masters says much of the green
house gas buildup is due to this
country's inefficient use of energy
and that at least 50 percent of
the country's energy supply could
be conserved at no cost with
present-day technologies. This
comes from the man whose largest
electricity and gas bill since he
moved into his self-designed,
energy-efficient house was $23.
The problem, he argues, is that
the current incentive system does
not encourage energy efficiency.
For example, landlords do not in
stall more costly, energy-saving
devices even though it will save
more money in the long run with
decreased energy costs because
they don't pay the monthly bills.
Masters said the answer to this
Catch-22 is for the government to

institute standards, for instance
that consumers can only use
energy-saving fluorescent bulbs
for ordinary uses. Masters said
that everything from refrigera
tors and cars can made far more
energy-efficient with higher, and
also realistic, standards.
Manne disagrees: "You talk to
the refrigerator and auto manu
facturer and they will tell you
something different."
Manne and many other
economists say that standards
limit the ability of companies to
come up with clever, environmen
tally sound technologies and that
they are ineffective and politically
impossible.

"It's fiction to suppose you'll
acccomplish anything with regu
lations," according to Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel
laureate who has worked on the
economics of the greenhouse ef
fect.
According to Warner North, a
consulting professor at Stanford
and one of the state's top experts
on toxics and environmental is
sues, the industrialization of the
Third World is the most difficult
policy matter to deal with, since
those countries are unlikely to in
stitute the most environmentally
safe technologies as they continue

Greenhouse effect costs are staggering under three scenarios:
a — Substitutes for fossil fuel cost-effective and available; 1 percent
increase in energy efficiency per year
b — Energy efficiency Increase of 1 percent per year
c — No shift in energy sources; no Increase In energy efficiency

Operations Research Prof. Alan Manne thinks the greenhouse effect
will cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars.
