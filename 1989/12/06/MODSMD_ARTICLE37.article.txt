# What's the attraction to Cocoa Pebbles?.

Q # I've heard that Cocoa
• Krispies are fortified with
so much iron that a magnet will
attract the dregs left in the milk
when you've finished eating. Is
this true? Is this much iron good
for you? Is this eating this much
iron healthy?

A, After a few bottles of wine
.one Thursday night, a few
friends and I decided to test this
one out for ourselves.
We prepared the requisite dregs
(substituting Cocoa Pebbles for
the Cocoa Krispies) and grabbed
a magnet from the refrigerator
door (one of those nifty vegetable
shaped ones used to attach mes
sages before the invention of
Post-It Notes). Then we each tried
to attract the dark-colored little
cereal remains to the magnet.
Of the four of us, two said they
saw the flecks moving toward the
magnet, one said she wasn't sure,
and one (yours truly) didn't see
a thing.
That's the kind of result scien
tists call inconclusive, so I con
tacted Prof. Reynaldo Martorell,
a nutrition expert at Stanford's
Food Research Institute. He said
that cereal is usually fortified by
adding ferrous sulfate to the flour.
Iron in this form is not attracted
to magnets.
That leaves open the question
of what's actually going on in our
cereal bowls — perhaps we've dis
covered a new form of cold fusion.
To make a complete study of
this problem, our research group
needs a grant of several hundred
dollars to purchase calibrated
cereal bowls, stronger magnets
and a year's supply of Cocoa

Krispies. There is also a 74 per
cent overhead fee to cover indirect
costs. Send your cash donation to
The Stanford Daily.
As for the health effects of iron
consumption, Martorell said that
no matter how much iron has been
added to the Cocoa Krispies,
eating the cereal is unlikely to
cause serious health problems.
(That is, problems due to the iron
— he made no claims for the
cereal'B other ingredients.)
While there are about 2,000 in
cidents of iron poisoning in the
United States eadi year, these are
not the result of eating fortified
cereals. Most are cases of young
children swallowing iron supple
ments meant for adults.
Also, Martorell said, some
people have a hereditary defect
called "idiopathic hemochromato
sis," that keeps the body from
correctly regulating the amount
of iron it absorbs. The absorption
of too much iron can damage
many body tissues, especially the
liver where excess iron is stored.
Except for the situations de
scribed above, eating iron is bas
ically a good thing. The body
usually efficiently regulates the
amount of iron it absorbs based
on the amount of iron it has
stored.
In fact, eating too little iron is
a much more common problem

than eating too much, especially
among young children, adoles
cents and women of reproductive
age. The iron is needed to form
the hemoglobin in red blood cells
that soaks up oxygen in the lungs
and distributes it to rest of the
body.
(In case you were wondering,
this does not mean that blood is
attracted to magnets.)
More on Rip-Roaring Holiday
Fires:
To follow up on last week's
column about ways to create
colorful fireplace flames: Barium
is an element used to make
fireworks green, but it is unlikely
to work in your fireplace, accord
ing to John Beale (who I assume
is an expert in something, al
though he didn't say what).
Since the only flames hot
enough to burn barium are in the
area flickering above the logs,
sprinkling barium powder on the}
logs doesn't work. Beale says
tried this himself with barium
carbonate and had no luck. (Don't
try this at home, kids, and
cially don't breathe the smoke —j
barium carbonate is toxic.)
So be warned, be careful, an(j
do any experimenting a few thout
sand miles away from me. Happy
Holidays!
