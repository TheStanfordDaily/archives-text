The burping Earth
The Oct. 17 earthquake that hit
the Bay Area, as well as the long-
Eredicted "Big One," might be caused
y sudden "burps" by water that has
been trapped deep in the earth's crust,
says Geophysics Prof. Amos Nur.
The "burp theory," which is being
studied by Nur and student Joe
Walder, was presented at the annual
American Geophysical Union meeting
in San Francisco yesterday.
According to Nur's theory, water or
oil trapped in pores and cracks of
rocks 10 to 15 kilometers below the
earth's surface, due to pressure from
the rocks above, can cause the rocks
containing the fluids to split, releasing

sudden "belches" of liquid. This, in
turn, can cause earthquakes, Nur
speculates. After the pressure drops,
the fractured rocks seal themselves
again and the cycle will begins once
more.
According to the a spokesperson for
the U.S. Geological Survey, an earth
quake "can definitely be lubricated by
the presence of such fluids."

Shooting space guns
The same phenomenon causing the
Northern Lights may soon be used to
send messages from space, a Stanford
researcher will announce today.
Researchers from Stanford and

other universities are trying to use
an electron "gun" with the power of
a handful of hair dryers to generate
radio waves in the earth's outer at
mosphere that could transmit mes
sages from satellites to receivers on
earth.
Torsten Neubert, an associate re
searcher at Stanford's Space Telecom
munications and Radioscience
Laboratory, said recent experiments
have solved a problem that had
stumped those working on the project
for more than 20 years. He will pres
ent his results today at the American
Geophysical Union fall conference.
Ordinary radio waves are generated
by sending electrons back and forth
in an antenna and to send waves the
frequency the researchers studied, un
realistically long antennas were
needed. But by pulsing the electron
beam at the right frequency, the re
searchers can simulate antennas.
In previous experiments, scientists
never received radio transmission at
earth because their experiments
clashed with theories. The guns shot
out more electrons than their theories
allowed.
Neubert has now explained that this
effect arises from when the electron
beam strike atoms in the atmosphere,
tearing away some of their electrons.
Some of these electrons scatter back
towards the electron gun, changing
the charge of the gun and allowing
more electrons to be pumped out.
Neubert said with the additional
knowledge, researchers should be able
to receive an electron beam message
on earth.
