# Verdict out on caffeine
##

It is one of the most popular drugs in
America, one that has been banned by the
NCAA. It is also a very addictive drug.
Virtually all of us use it in one form or
another, and sometimes we do not even
know we are using it.
Caffeine has a variety of physiological
effects on the body. Its main and best
known effect is stimulation of the nervous
system, providing the lift we all need, es
pecially during Dead Week. At the same
time, though, it also increases heart rate,
urine production and the metabolic rate.
The big question surrounding caffeine is
how much is too much. Excessive caffeine
consumption leads to "caffeinism," the
most common symptom being nervousness.
For some people, the equivalent of a large
cup of coffee a day, or about 200 milligrams,
can cause caffeinism. For others, it can
take more than 750 milligrams per day.
The most common sources of caffeine
are coffee, tea and soda drinks. The amount
varies, but drip coffee tends to have the
most with about 150 milligrams per five
ounces. The same amount of tea only has
50 milligrams. Most soft drinks have less
than 50 milligrams.
Although some people think the colas
contain the most caffeine, this is not true.
Mr. Pibb, Mountain Dew and Mello Yello
all have 50 to 55 mg per 12 ounce can.
Sunkist and Tab have over 40 mg, while
Coke and Dr. Pepper have only 35 mg.
Sodas with no caffeine include 7-Up, Sprite
and Diet Sunkist.
Many people have wondered why soft
drinks have caffeine added to them, and
there seems to be no clear answer. Officials
of Sunkist Soft Drink Co. say that caffeine
reduces the sweetness to provide a better
flavor. According to official industry infor-

mation, though, caffeine is added to provide
stimulation.
Although chocolate contains caffeine, it
is a small amount compared to coffee. An
ounce of baking chocolate has 35 mg, and
an ounce of milk chocolate has only 6 mg.
But caffeine is not just found in food.
The drug can be found hidden in medica
tion. A dose of Midol or Anacin provides
65 mg, and a dose of Excedrin has 130
milligrams of caffeine.
The health effects of caffeine are still
unclear. Some data conflict and some
studies are uncontrolled. Excessive doses
can cause headaches, depression, heart pal
pitations and diarrhea. The general recom
mendation for a safe dose is 200 milligrams
per day or less. Since it is so variable
between individuals, though, it is important
to adjust based on personal reactions to
caffeine.
Because caffeine can cause sleep prob
lems, it is important to avoid it before
going to bed. The half-life of caffeine is
three-and-a-half hours, so in that time, only
half of the caffeine is broken down. That
means that two or three cups of coffee
severaJ hours before bedtime may disrupt
sleep.
Until the controversial issues surround
ing caffeine are solved, it is best to take
it in moderation. Doses that do not cause
caffeinism or its symptoms are probably
OK, though. Small doses are good for stim
ulation and muscle energy.
