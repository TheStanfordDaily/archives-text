# University responding to UCMI report recommendations
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
The symbolic move of the Affirmative
Action Office to Building 10, which also
houses the Office of the President, shows
a growing concern by high-ranking offi
cials over the implementation of recom
mendations by the University Committee
on Minority Issues.
University officials have spent "con
siderable effort" this fall embedding the
UCMI recommendations in Stanford's ad
ministrative framework "so that respon
sibility and accountability are well
described and understood," according to

University officials have
spent 'considerable effort'
this fall on UCMI recom
mendations.

the UCMI progress report released last
Thursday.
In addition to the Affirmative Action
Office relocation, the University and its
departments have taken several concrete
steps towards achieving diversity, accord

ing to the report.
The President's Office has created the
Annual Review Panel to examine the Uni
versity's response to the UCMI recom
mendations and to report annually on
progress towards multiculturalism.
"The approach will be comprehensive
and influential, and it naturally encom
passes staff considerations along with fac
ulty, student, curriculum and other
areas," the progress report stated.
In response to a UCMI recommenda
tion, the Office of Student Affairs is de
veloping a comprehensive, long-term plan
for making multicultural learning part
of every student's experience.

The office is planning to hire a full-time
multicultural educator for this purpose.
Funds for the new position are being
supplied by Student Affairs.
The UCMI report proposed the devel
opment of a postdoctoral program for
minority scholars in order to address the
"pipeline problem" — a lack of qualified
minorities to hire as faculty — cited by
several departments.
In addition, the Office of Graduate Ad
missions has agreed not to send out rejec
tions to targeted minorities until staff
from the Office of Recruitment and
Retention have the opportunity to review
the application and agree that a rejection

is warranted.
Graduate Studies "is hopeful" it can
double minority student enrollment over
the next five years, the progress report
stated.
Funding for targeting minority doc
toral candidates comes primarily from
the Irvine Minority Program. The Irvine
Foundation funds provided about
$500,000 for 20 programs involving 243
students and 188 faculty members for
the 1988-89 academic year.
Beneficiaries of the funds ranged from
specific targeted recruitment projects and
undergraduate summer programs
to advanced programs for faculty
development in the Law School.
The Irvine Foundation has also
donated $1 million for curricular
development at both the under
graduate and graduate levels over
the next six years.
Stanford has also recently re
ceived funding from the Mellon
Foundation for providing loan
repayment for minority students
who pursue doctorates in the hu
manities.
Although University President
Donald Kennedy commended the
School of Educations success at
recruiting minorities, school offi
cials expressed discontent at what
they consider a failure to improve
minority hiring rates among their
staff.
