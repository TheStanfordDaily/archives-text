## 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
Stanford is one of the most
popular U.S. destinations for
foreign students, according to a
survey released last month.
Stanford has the fifth highest
percentage of foreign students
among the 80 most popular uni
versities attended by students
from other countries, according to
the survey, conducted by the In
stitute of International Educa
tion.
In 1989, foreign students made
up 15.5 percent of Stanford's stu
dent body, continuing a trend of

steady growth in the number of
international students at Stanford
since the early 19705. This fall
2,081 undergraduates and gradu
ate foreign students enrolled at
Stanford.
Nationally, the number of
foreign students in the United
States increased 2.9 percent to an
all-time record of 366,354.
The newly released figures
came as a surprise to John Pear
son, director of the International
Center. "If you had asked me last
year if this number would go up,
I would have said no," he said "I
expected it to level oft or decline."
Pearson attributes Stanford's

popularity to its geographical lo
cation on the West Coast and the
fact that Stanford has become
"extremely well-known interna
tionally over the past 10 to 15
years."
Stanford now has students from
100 foreign nations, with the most
coming from Canada. China, In
dia, Korea, Japan and Taiwan fol
low Canada with more than 150
students each.
The predominance of students
from the Pacific Rim reflects a
national trend. Eight of the top
10 nations of origin for foreign
students are located in Asia, with
Malaysia, Hong Kong and In

donesia rounding out the list.
Foreign students at Stanford
also follow the national lead in
their choice of fields of study. Elec
trical engineering, mechanical en
gineering and business are the
most popular fields at Stanford.
Across the nation, almost 40 per
cent of foreign students mf\jor in
business and engineering.
Pearson thinks the impact of
the international students will be
a good one, in light of Stanford's
goal of becoming a multicultural
university.
"To say we have 2,081 [foreign
students] does not give any indi
cation of the variety," he said.
