# Afro-American Studies panel relates experiences with racism
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Staff writer 
Senior Canetta Ivy didn't learn
everything she needed to know in
kindergarten. Or in high school,
for that matter.
It wasn't until Ivy's freshman
year at Stanford that she first
learned about prejudice.
By contrast, Floyd Thompkins,
associate dean of the chapel at
Memorial Church, recognized rac
ism from his youth. Growing up
in the South prior to the civil
rights movement, Thompkins was
forced to flee Ku Klux Klan vio
lence.
Ivy and Thompkins on Friday
recounted their experiences with
prejudice as part of a six-member

panel examining racism's implica
tions for the Stanford community.
The seminar was sponsored by
the Afro-American Studies De
partment. About 25 people lis
tened to the panelists as they
relived situations involving dis
crimination.
Ivy said she felt comfortable at
tending her predominantly white
Houston school as a black student.
At the same time, however, she
never thought of her blackness as
a predominant part of her identity.
"Racism didn't exist — no one
was calling me 'nigger,' so every
thing was fine," Ivy said, describ
ing her former world view.
But upon entering Stanford, Ivy
experienced a different atmos
phere. Her ethnicity seemed to

draw attention from some white
students here, she said.
"All of a sudden, I was being
forced to stand up and be an am
bassador for my race," she said.
As she became increasingly
aware of racial factors in her re
lationships, Ivy noticed few reflec
tions of black life in Stanford's
institutions and courses, she said.
Ivy was surprised to find a lot
of racial incidents on campus, she
added.
"I felt everywhere I was going,
I was being denied," Ivy said.
Ivy turned to Stanford's black
community for support and guid
ance. "I needed to start to learn
about me so I could have some
thing to feel proud of," she said.
Though she worries about being

called hypersensitive on racial is
sues, she said people need to be
come more aware of discrim
ination in all its forms.
As a pastor in the Bedford-
Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn,
Thompkins experienced racism as
an inner-city phenomenon. Ten
sions between blacks and whites
in that area of New York City led
filmmaker Spike Lee to choose it
as the setting of "Do The Right
Thing," a controversial film that
scrutinized race relations.
After accepting a position at
Princeton University, Thompkins
found that the staff there antici
pated that he would only focus
on ethnic concerns. Thompkins
said that expectation was demean
ing.

Because of her identity as an
African-American and a Chicana,
Mary Haynes, residence dean for
Governor's Corner and another
panelist at the talk, said she ex
perienced racism from a unique
perspective.
Because Haynes appears to be
black, some people treat her as
such, ignoring half her heritage
in the process, she explained.
"So much of the world is still
seen in terms of black and white,"
Haynes said. This limited view

"knocks out the struggles of other
people of color," she said.
As an undergraduate at Stan
ford in the early 1980s, Haynes
countered apparent prejudice with
militancy. In her courses, she con
fronted her professors when they
proposed biased theories, she said.
A former admissions officer,
Haynes adopted additional duties
to help minority students make
the transition between high school
and college, she said.
