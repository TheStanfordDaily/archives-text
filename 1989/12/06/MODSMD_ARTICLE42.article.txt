# Congresswoman addresses Farm
## Speech in Kresge focuses on abortion, Central America 
### Molly Conroy 
Congresswoman Barbara
Boxer, who has represented Marin
and San Francisco counties since
1982, addressed the issues of
abortion rights, U.S. aid to Cen
tral America and government
spending in a speech in Kresge
Auditorium last Friday.
Boxer focused on pro-choice is
sues early in her talk, saying "(it
is] ironic that as the walls are
torn down in Eastern Europe, in
this country freedom is being
eroded."
Boxer, who strongly supports
and often authors pro-choice leg
islation, called it the "ultimate
issue of freedom." She said she
believes that President George
Bush is using abortion as a

"litmus test" to prove himself to
conservative factions.
"He picked the wrong issue to
do this," Boxer said, claiming that
Bush has made "a deal with the
devil." She clarified this state
ment by explaining that Bush is
no longer "protected by the
[Supreme] Court as Reagan was"
and that "the issue has been
thrown back to the politicians."
She continued by discussing
some of the pro-choice legislation
that Congress has recently
created, including the Washing
ton, D.C. bill which was vetoed
by Bush because it called for
Medicaid funds for abortions.
She said that without such
funds, poor women really have no
choice, and abortion becomes a
privilege for the wealthy. She

added that Congress needs 50
more pro-choice members to gain
the power needed to override
Bush's veto.
Boxer briefly discussed U.S. in
volvement in Central America, es
pecially the government's role in
El Salvador. She said the problem
with the U.S. aid was that Con
gress "gave hundreds of millions
of dollars without the leverage to
reform society. We did not estab
lish policy; [we] gave them money
and forgot about them."
She said she proposed a bill that
called for the aid to be reversed
to one-third military and two
thirds economic — as opposed to
the current two-thirds slice for
military aid — but the bill never
had a hearing.
