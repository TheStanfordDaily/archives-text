# Staff report excludes unions
## Underrepresentation blamed on lack of returned surveys 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
Due to what one union official
calls a "lack of faith" in the Uni
versity, members of the United
Stanford Workers union did not
respond to the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues staff
subcommittee survey in sufficient
numbers to be included in the
final report.
The low numbers of returned
surveys, which were intended to
contrast the views of white and
minority staff members, did not
make the subcommittee "confi
dent that these replies are repre
sentative," according to the
report. Only 36 percent of the
workers returned the lengthy sur
vey to the subcommittee.
Although the USW was not in
cluded, "I don't think it skewed
the results in the large sense,"
said Director of Undergraduate
Advising Hector Cuevas, who was
one of five members of the sub
committee. "I think that it's an
accurate report in that it points
out the msyor problems in work
ing conditions," he said.
"We had a special mission and
a limited lifetime," said Director
of Office Planning Management
Raymond Bacchetti, who co
chaired the subcommittee. The
report "was as complete as we
could get it,"he said.
The subcommittee report,
issued Nov. 14 as a companion to
the original 240-page UCMI
report released in April, at
tempted to determine how white
and minority University workers
felt about their jobs and the over
all workplace at Stanford.
The report, based on a poll of
University employees conducted
last spring by SRI International,

discovered a wide gap between the
views of white and minority staff
members on such issues as ad
vancement opportunities and staff
development.
Cuevas said he could not ex
plain why the response rate was
so low among the USW staff mem
bers, which represents about
1,300 University workers. "There
were several sets of letters sent
out to everyone" to convince them
to respond, he said. "There was
a good amount of time to re
spond."
Bacchetti said the subcommit
tee even attempted to assist the
staff members with translating
the survey in case language was
a barrier to responding.
But USW field representative
Rodney Barnette said the subcom
mittee could have done a better
job of persuading the USW mem
bers to respond to the survey by
calling departmental meetings or
by working with the union.
"People just have a defeatist at
titude about the University," said
USW President Alan Wagner.
"We've gone to the University
before . .. and it hasn't made a
difference," he said.
According to Barnette, many
USW members are currently in
volved in grievances with the Uni
versity, which causes much of the
frustration with Stanford. The
USW members "feel pretty hope
less about the University dealing
with these issues," he said.
Barnette cited one ongoing six
year complaint at the School of
Medicine in which life science
technicians, who are mostly wom
en, are paid between seven and
21 percent less than science and
engineering technicians, who are
mostly men, despite the similarity
in their jobs.
When this grievance is still in
progress, "how can you expect
large numbers of women to par
ticipate in the survey?" Barnette
asked.
The report itself also detected
a "general, institutional distrust"

of the University. For example,
65 percent of black staff members
felt the University administration
was not committed to affirmative
action, whereas only 13 percent
of white employees felt the same.
The report cited "poor communi
cation" between workers and
management as one possible
reason for the distrust.
Cuevas said the subcommittee
publication is a "launching report
to look at other issues," including
the question of why greater num
bers of the union workers did not
respond to the survey.
Wagner and Barnette said they
could not comment on the ac
curacy of the subcommittee report
because neither of them had fully
read it.
Although the report eventually
did not include the USW, its pub
lication was delayed by a request
from the University Legal Office
that it be postponed because the
University and the USW were in
the midst of collective bargaining.
The request was made because
the relations between the Univer
sity and its workers "should be
stable" when a survey is taken,
according to Bacchetti.
The USW is awaiting the pub
lication of a report from the Bay
Area Civil Rights Coalition on em
ployment discrimination at Stan
ford, based on a tribunal held last
May by the USW. The tribunal
brought numerous examples of
discrimination against minority,
female and gay University staff
members to the coalition.
The UCMI staff subcommittee
report divided the staff members
into three categories: exempt,
non-exempt and bargaining
unit/police. Exempt staffers are
those who work in executive or
administrative University jobs.
Non-exempt employees are in
volved with office support and
clerical jobs, while the third
category includes maintenance
and service personnel who are rep
resented by the United Stanford
Workers, as well as the police.

issued Nov. 14 as a companion to
the original 240-page UCMI
report released in April, at
tempted to determine how white
and minority University workers
felt about their jobs and the over
all workplace at Stanford.
The report, based on a poll of
University employees conducted
last spring by SRI International,

discovered a wide gap between the
views of white and minority staff
members on such issues as ad
vancement opportunities and staff
development.
Cuevas said he could not ex
plain why the response rate was
so low among the USW staff mem
bers, which represents about
1,300 University workers. "There
were several sets of letters sent
out to everyone" to convince them
to respond, he said. "There was
a good amount of time to re
spond."
Bacchetti said the subcommit
tee even attempted to assist the
staff members with translating
the survey in case language was
a barrier to responding.
But USW field representative
Rodney Barnette said the subcom
mittee could have done a better
job of persuading the USW mem
bers to respond to the survey by
calling departmental meetings or
by working with the union.
"People just have a defeatist at
titude about the University," said
USW President Alan Wagner.
"We've gone to the University
before . .. and it hasn't made a
difference," he said.
According to Barnette, many
USW members are currently in
volved in grievances with the Uni
versity, which causes much of the
frustration with Stanford. The
USW members "feel pretty hope
less about the University dealing
with these issues," he said.
Barnette cited one ongoing six
year complaint at the School of
Medicine in which life science
technicians, who are mostly wom
en, are paid between seven and
21 percent less than science and
engineering technicians, who are
mostly men, despite the similarity
in their jobs.
When this grievance is still in
progress, "how can you expect
large numbers of women to par
ticipate in the survey?" Barnette
asked.
The report itself also detected
a "general, institutional distrust"

of the University. For example,
65 percent of black staff members
felt the University administration
was not committed to affirmative
action, whereas only 13 percent
of white employees felt the same.
The report cited "poor communi
cation" between workers and
management as one possible
reason for the distrust.
Cuevas said the subcommittee
publication is a "launching report
to look at other issues," including
the question of why greater num
bers of the union workers did not
respond to the survey.
Wagner and Barnette said they
could not comment on the ac
curacy of the subcommittee report
because neither of them had fully
read it.
Although the report eventually
did not include the USW, its pub
lication was delayed by a request
from the University Legal Office
that it be postponed because the
University and the USW were in
the midst of collective bargaining.
The request was made because
the relations between the Univer
sity and its workers "should be
stable" when a survey is taken,
according to Bacchetti.
The USW is awaiting the pub
lication of a report from the Bay
Area Civil Rights Coalition on em
ployment discrimination at Stan
ford, based on a tribunal held last
May by the USW. The tribunal
brought numerous examples of
discrimination against minority,
female and gay University staff
members to the coalition.
The UCMI staff subcommittee
report divided the staff members
into three categories: exempt,
non-exempt and bargaining
unit/police. Exempt staffers are
those who work in executive or
administrative University jobs.
Non-exempt employees are in
volved with office support and
clerical jobs, while the third
category includes maintenance
and service personnel who are rep
resented by the United Stanford
Workers, as well as the police.
Due to what one union official
calls a "lack of faith" in the Uni
versity, members of the United
Stanford Workers union did not
respond to the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues staff
subcommittee survey in sufficient
numbers to be included in the
final report.
The low numbers of returned
surveys, which were intended to
contrast the views of white and
minority staff members, did not
make the subcommittee "confi
dent that these replies are repre
sentative," according to the
report. Only 36 percent of the
workers returned the lengthy sur
vey to the subcommittee.
Although the USW was not in
cluded, "I don't think it skewed
the results in the large sense,"
said Director of Undergraduate
Advising Hector Cuevas, who was
one of five members of the sub
committee. "I think that it's an
accurate report in that it points
out the msyor problems in work
ing conditions," he said.
"We had a special mission and
a limited lifetime," said Director
of Office Planning Management
Raymond Bacchetti, who co
chaired the subcommittee. The
report "was as complete as we
could get it,"he said.
