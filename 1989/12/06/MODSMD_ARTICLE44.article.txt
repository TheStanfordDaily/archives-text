Red and green, the customary colors for
Christmas time celebrations, were accom
panied by black when the Black Student
Union decked the walls of Elliott Program
Center.
Tricolor flags, gala African tapestries and
other decorations in red, green and black
helped to create a festive atmosphere for
the BSU's annual presentation on Kwan
zaa, a recently created holiday promoting
black pride and cultural awareness.
The program, held Saturday evening, fea
tured a number of black artistic groups,
such as the Kuumba Dance Ensemble and
Stanford's Gospel Choir. As they performed
songs and dances that commemorated
black culture, the dancers and musicians
sought audience participation.
Many joined in, clapping, swaying and
dancing until the floor of the hall shook
rhythmically with African percussion and
applause.
Amid this light-hearted setting, a black
felt banner provided a somber reminder
that further social and personal change is
needed within the black community.
The banner listed the Seven Principles
of Kwanzaa, guidelines that emphasize
such qualities as faith, self-determination
and unity.
Though Kwanzaa officially begins Dec.
26, more than 200 people joined the BSU
in observing the holiday early.
Celebrating early helps the BSU bring
Stanford's black community together, said
sophomore Bacardi Jackson, general repre
sentative of the BSU.
"Just learning about the Seven Principles
puts us back in touch with a lot of our
heritage and with each other," she added.
The BSU's Kwanzaa program also at
tracted people from East Palo Alto. Stu
dents, parents and faculty from the Shula
Mandela Academy took part in the pro

gram. The Mandela Academy is an inde
pendent school with an Afro-centric
curriculum, said Nobantu Ankoanda, its
executive director. Accordingly, the school
marks Kwanzaa each year.
During the BSU's presentation, students
from the academy enacted a skit stressing
the importance of understanding the Seven
Principles of Kwanzaa.
About a million people celebrate Kwan
zaa annually throughout the United States,
Ankoanda said. Nevertheless, millions
more need to learn about the holiday, she
added.
"Your children's children should know
what Kwanzaa's about, but it's up to us
to pass it along," she said.
The holiday was first established in 1965,
when Maulana Karenga, founder of a black
nationalist organization, urged blacks to
rediscover their African heritage, said soph
omore Tara Walters, coordinator of this
year's Kwanzaa ceremony.
Drawing from African customs, Karenga
designed the seven-day holiday and intro
duced its Seven Principles, she added.
On each day of the festival, a different
theme provides a source of meditation for
families. At the end of the week, on New
Year's Day, children receive gifts according
to their observance of the principles over
the past year, Ankoanda explained.
During the celebration, the BSU recog
nized graduate student Philip Lawes for
his efforts in supplying black South African
schools with textbooks.
The BSU also congratulated junior Louis
Jackson for his perseverance in his six
month judicial ordeal. Sophomore Valerie
Minor of the BSU's Educational Rights
Committee gave Jackson a plaque to
reward his sacrifices for the community.
As a result of his role in the May 15
takeover of University President Donald
Kennedy's office, Jackson was sentenced to
six months probation and 70 hours of com
munity service.
