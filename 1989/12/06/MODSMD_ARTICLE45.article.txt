Construction of the new Gilbert Biological Sci
ences Building is progressing steadily to its sched
uled completion in the summer of 1991.
The Gilbert Building is located in the Near West
area of campus, near the StaufTer Buildings and
Mudd Chemistry Building. Currently, erection of
the steel framework is in progress, Facilities Project
Manager Russ Quacchia said, together with con
struction of the structural flooring.
Budgeted at approximately $25 million, the build
ing will have four floors and a basement. Construc
tion began in May.
It will serve as a research facility for the Biology
Department and will also house the department's
administrative offices. The building has no real
"unique functions," Quacchia said, except to provide
more space for the department and, specifically,
expanded research facilities.
Most importantly, the new building will allow the
department to spread out from its now cramped
quarters in the Herrin Building.
"We are tremendously overcrowded," Associate
Chair of the Biology Department Pat Jones said.
"(The Gilbert Building) will be able to handle some
of our overflow. We should be able to spread out a
little bit."
The new floor space will be used for biology
faculty and their labs, Jones said. In addition, the
department will probably add a couple of faculty
members.
According to Jones, the Biology Department had
been feeling restricted for the past several years,
both physically and in terms of what it could ac
complish. This "decompaction" is a welcome im
provement, Jones said.
"We feel that we've been very lean in the past
in terms of classes, faculty and research," Jones
said. "We made that argument to the University a
few years back, and they agreed."
