On the Opinions page in Fri
day's Daily, the word "never" was
omitted from a sentence in a letter
by Henry Organ, associate direc
tor of the Office of Development.
The first sentence in the fourth
column should read, "There are
many senior managers at Stan
ford who have never hired or
promoted a person of color into
an exempt position."
