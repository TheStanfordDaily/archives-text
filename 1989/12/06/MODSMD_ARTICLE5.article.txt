The final reports on both the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity and Pi Beta Phi sorority
investigations should be released "before stu
dents go into finals," Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Michael Hughes said Monday.
The Phi Delts were suspended pending in
vestigation of a Sept. 29 accident in which an
intoxicated freshman was hit by a truck after
reportedly leaving a Phi Delt party held earlier
that evening.
On Oct. 17, the Pi Phis were also suspended,
pending investigations into alcohol-related in
cidents.
While the Pi Phis' social suspension has
not been officially revoked, Hughes permitted

the sorority to hold a formal in San Francisco
last Saturday, according to Pi Phi president
Pyeatt Gravely.
"When we had to put money down for the
formal, [Hughesl said go ahead and do it.
Since the investigation has taken longer than
expected, I asked if it would be OK [to hold
the formal anyway, and Hughes] said yes,"
Gravely said.
"The Pi Phi report in essence has been
approved," Hughes said. "Based on findings
of the report" and the preparations the Pi
Phis made during a retreat with alumni, it
seemed reasonable to let them hold the event.
According to Phi Delt president Parker
Blackman, the fraternity was "allowed to have
dinner with alums after Big Game" but could
not hold a formal.

Hughes originally submitted reports of his
findings on the Phi Delt incident to Student
Affairs on Oct. 27 and on Nov. 6 for the Pi
Phis.
The latest Phi Delt report was "generally
accepted with brief, minor changes," while
the most current Pi Phi report was "submitted
and approved," Hughes said.
The reports include findings concerning the
incidents that led to the suspensions, the
status of the groups and recommendations
for future action, Hughes said.
According to Hughes, it is mostly "ad
ministrative protocol" that needs to be taken
care of before there is an official announce
ment. This involves figuring out who will get
copies of the reports and who will make the
information public, Hughes said.
