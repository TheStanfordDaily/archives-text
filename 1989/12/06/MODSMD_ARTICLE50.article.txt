# Sorority rape survey underway

### Minal Hajratwala 
A survey of sorority members
on rape has raised both awareness
and concern within Stanford's
Greek system, even though the
results have not yet been released.
Juniors Sally Bennett, a Kappa
Alpha Theta member, and Debbie
Chang, a Delta Gamma member,
formulated the survey, which they
say may be the first of its kind
in the nation.
"Our goal is to raise awareness
to document that date rape does
occur in our own fraternities and
sororities," said Bennett. "We are
asking whether the atmosphere
at a fraternity or sorority function
can lead to instances where it is
more apt to happen."

The survey's results, due to be
released in the spring, will be of
interest to students nationwide,
according to David Frazee, co
author of a study on sexual vio
lence published last spring by the
Rape Education Project. Chang
and Bennett modeled their survey
on this study.
Controversy over the survey has
already surfaced, although statis
tics have neither been compiled
nor interpreted. "A lot of people
are concerned about what to do
with the results, because they are
worried about what the results
will be," Bennett said.
Because members of the Greek
system initiated and executed the
survey, however, sorority mem
bers have for the most part been

supportive of it, according to Ben
nett.
About 150 of the 400 women
in seven University-recognized so
rorities returned the question
naire.
"It has started people talking
and generated interest in the
issue," Chang said.
Taking the survey may also
help individual women under
stand personal experiences in a
new light, said Intersorority
Council President Pam Simpson.
Recent reports of sexual crimes
on campus have heightened the
survey's relevance, making people
"more aware, more cautious,
more interested in how to prevent
those things from happening,"
Simpson said.
