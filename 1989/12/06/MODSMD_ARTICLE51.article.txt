March against rape held tonnorrow
A coalition of student groups pledges to "Take
Back the Night" with a candlelight march across
campus tomorrow night.
The march comes in response to two recent
attempted rapes and a series of indecent exposure
incidents on campus. It aims to make women
feel comfortable walking across campus at night.
Marchers will meet at 11 p.m. between Green
and Meyer libraries.
The march was initiated by the Stanford Pro-
Choice Alliance when many members expressed
concern over the recent incidents at a meeting
last week, member Kathleen Coll said.

The march is co-sponsored by at least 10 other
student groups.
Math Corner evacuated briefly
Burning plastic in a small electrical box on the
second floor of Math Corner resulted in the build
ing being evacuated briefly last night.
Greg O'Hair, a visiting scholar, said the librar
ian of the Mathematics and Computer Science
Library, which is on the fourth floor of building
380 in the Quad, smelled smoke at about 5:30
p.m. and called the fire department.
People were allowed back in the building by
5:45 p.m., and there was no damage.
