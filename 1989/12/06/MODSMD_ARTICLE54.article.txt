It may be winning ugly, but it beats
the heck out of losing.
Despite coming out slow in the first
halves of both games, the Cardinal
men's basketball team won its own Ap
ple Invitational for the fourth consecu
tive year by defeating Lehigh and Lou
isiana Tech at Maples Pavilion over the
weekend. The two victories moved Stan
ford to 4-0 on the young season, the
best start for a Cardinal club since 1985.

Men's Basketball
Stanford wins Apple Invitational.
The Cardinal trailed Lehigh 23-16
before pulling away and shot 27.7 per
cent in the first half against Louisiana
Tech, but the inside play of tournament
MVP Adam Keefe and the scoring of
all-tournament selection Kenny Am
mann helped Stanford take the title.
"We don't like to lose at home and
we don't like to lose our own tourna
ment," junior forward Deshon Wingate

said after scoring 21 points and pulling
down 11 rebounds for the weekend.
Stanford almost did lose at home for
the first time in over a year as the
Bulldogs took a 30-26 halftime lead in
the championship game. In the first
half, Stanford made l-of-15 three-point
shots as Tech played a sagging man-to
man defense that clogged the low post
so Keefe and center Derek Bruton could
not get the ball.
The night before, against Lehigh,
Keefe had 19 points and a career-high
15 rebounds and Bruton had the best
game of his career, getting 17 points
and eight rebounds, both personal bests.
"I rolled the dice," Bulldog Coach
Jerry Loyd said. "I decided our strategy
would be to let Stanford beat us from
the outside. I didn't want those two
guys to maul us inside. I was sitting
pretty for a while."
With the defense so packed in, the
Cardinal shooters were so wide open
they couldn't pass up shots. The prob
lem, according to Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery, was that the shooters
hesitated to see if they would be
guarded. When they realized the shot
was open and decided to the ball fly,
they were out of sync.
"They just played real soft," he said

of the Bulldogs. "It's a gamble, but it's
smart. We fell into the trap. The result
was we shot out of rhythm, out of mo
tion and out of patience."
The only saving grace was the play
of freshman point guard Marcus Lollie,
who got a lot of playing time when
Ammann picked up three fouls in under
sVfc minutes. Lollie buried two 18-
footers and hit four free throws to lead
Stanford at the half with eight points.
"I just felt that I had to come in and
get the offense going and establish a
rhythm," Lollie said.
A halflime talk with Montgomery also
helped the Cardinal solve the defense.
"We just tried to be more patient," Mont
gomery said. "It's just, 'Why shoot 15
three-pointers when the guy's 10 feet
off you? Take the ball in to about 16
feet and set yourself.'
"We shot 56 percent — same scenario
— in the second half."
Ammann hit 6-of-7 shots for the game
to finish with a Stanford-high 14 points
and Keefe finished with 13. But forward
Anthony Dade and guard Reggie Gibbs
were playing Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside
for Louisiana Tech and kept the Bull
dogs right in the game.
