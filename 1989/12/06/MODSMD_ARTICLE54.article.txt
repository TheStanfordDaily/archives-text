# Cardinal lashes cajun cagers
## Stanford improves to 4-0 by winning Apple Invitational 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
It may be winning ugly, but it beats
the heck out of losing.
Despite coming out slow in the first
halves of both games, the Cardinal
men's basketball team won its own Ap
ple Invitational for the fourth consecu
tive year by defeating Lehigh and Lou
isiana Tech at Maples Pavilion over the
weekend. The two victories moved Stan
ford to 4-0 on the young season, the
best start for a Cardinal club since 1985.

Men's Basketball
Stanford wins Apple Invitational.
The Cardinal trailed Lehigh 23-16
before pulling away and shot 27.7 per
cent in the first half against Louisiana
Tech, but the inside play of tournament
MVP Adam Keefe and the scoring of
all-tournament selection Kenny Am
mann helped Stanford take the title.
"We don't like to lose at home and
we don't like to lose our own tourna
ment," junior forward Deshon Wingate

said after scoring 21 points and pulling
down 11 rebounds for the weekend.
Stanford almost did lose at home for
the first time in over a year as the
Bulldogs took a 30-26 halftime lead in
the championship game. In the first
half, Stanford made l-of-15 three-point
shots as Tech played a sagging man-to
man defense that clogged the low post
so Keefe and center Derek Bruton could
not get the ball.
The night before, against Lehigh,
Keefe had 19 points and a career-high
15 rebounds and Bruton had the best
game of his career, getting 17 points
and eight rebounds, both personal bests.
"I rolled the dice," Bulldog Coach
Jerry Loyd said. "I decided our strategy
would be to let Stanford beat us from
the outside. I didn't want those two
guys to maul us inside. I was sitting
pretty for a while."
With the defense so packed in, the
Cardinal shooters were so wide open
they couldn't pass up shots. The prob
lem, according to Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery, was that the shooters
hesitated to see if they would be
guarded. When they realized the shot
was open and decided to the ball fly,
they were out of sync.
"They just played real soft," he said

of the Bulldogs. "It's a gamble, but it's
smart. We fell into the trap. The result
was we shot out of rhythm, out of mo
tion and out of patience."
The only saving grace was the play
of freshman point guard Marcus Lollie,
who got a lot of playing time when
Ammann picked up three fouls in under
sVfc minutes. Lollie buried two 18-
footers and hit four free throws to lead
Stanford at the half with eight points.
"I just felt that I had to come in and
get the offense going and establish a
rhythm," Lollie said.
A halflime talk with Montgomery also
helped the Cardinal solve the defense.
"We just tried to be more patient," Mont
gomery said. "It's just, 'Why shoot 15
three-pointers when the guy's 10 feet
off you? Take the ball in to about 16
feet and set yourself.'
"We shot 56 percent — same scenario
— in the second half."
Ammann hit 6-of-7 shots for the game
to finish with a Stanford-high 14 points
and Keefe finished with 13. But forward
Anthony Dade and guard Reggie Gibbs
were playing Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside
for Louisiana Tech and kept the Bull
dogs right in the game.
Those two combined for 36
points in the game and after 6-
foot-11 center P.J. Brown hit two
shots, Stanford was only up 61-59
with 1:59 remaining. Wingate had
a chance to extend the lead with
1:22 left but missed a pair of free
throws. Keefe grabbed the re
bound, however, and Stanford was
able to run more time off the
clock.
The Bulldogs got the ball back
and gave it to Dade, who tried to
drive against Andrew Vlahov.
Keefe double-teamed him and the
two defenders forced him to miss
a layup with 42 seconds left. While
going for a steal, Tech knocked
the ball out of bounds with 33
seconds left and Brown stole the
inbounds pass to give the Bulldogs
new life.
After running down the clock,
Gibbs missed a three-pointer with
six seconds left and then John
Patrick made the first of a pair
of free throws after being fouled.
Brett Guillory's 55-foot heave
at the buzzer banked harmlessly
off the backboard and Stanford
was 4-0.
"It's a win," Montgomery said.
"It's not real pretty and it's not
the kind of basketball we are
going to need to play down the
stretch. ... I guess its good we
can win a game like this. Tech's
good — they're going to win some
games."
Lollie finished with 10 points
and Bruton broke the career best
he had set the night before by
grabbing a game-high 11
rebounds.
Friday night Stanford met what

it thought would be an over
matched Lehigh team with no
players over 6-7. The Engineers
(the guys on trains, not the guys
at Terman) surprised a few people
by hitting 5-of-6 three-pointers in
the first half to jump out to a
30-25 lead.
Stanford got the inßide game
going, however, and took a 34-32
lead into the locker room. Stan
ford scored the first eight points
of the second half and never
looked back. Ammann made 7-of-9
for the game to finish with 16
points and Stanford outrebounded
Lehigh 48-28 for the win.
"I think they took us by
surprise in the first half with
their outside shooting," Mont
gomery said. "Part of the reason
was we were kind of lazy. Once
we got a little bit more aggressive,
stopped letting them stand and
shoot, we got going a little better."
Lehigh defeated SMU 69-49 in
the consolation game.
Keefe and Ammann were joined
by Gibbs, Dade, Bob Krizansky of
Lehigh and John Colborne of
SMU on the all-tournament team.
Apple notes
This weekend's Apple Invitational
was well worth the price of admission
for Stanford students Sean Greenlee
and Nat Cousins.
Participating in Apple's halftime
shootout, both sophomores won Apple
Macintosh SE computers. Apple,
which hosts the tournament, gave
away a computer during halftime of
each of the four games. Ten names
were drawn for each shootout.
Greenlee, competing against nine
other Stanford students, tallied seven
points to bag his SE during Saturday's
championship. Cousins, Sports Editor
of The Daily, scored six points Friday
in the general public draw.

off you? Take the ball in to about 16
feet and set yourself.'
"We shot 56 percent — same scenario
— in the second half."
Ammann hit 6-of-7 shots for the game
to finish with a Stanford-high 14 points
and Keefe finished with 13. But forward
Anthony Dade and guard Reggie Gibbs
were playing Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside
for Louisiana Tech and kept the Bull
dogs right in the game.
Those two combined for 36
points in the game and after 6-
foot-11 center P.J. Brown hit two
shots, Stanford was only up 61-59
with 1:59 remaining. Wingate had
a chance to extend the lead with
1:22 left but missed a pair of free
throws. Keefe grabbed the re
bound, however, and Stanford was
able to run more time off the
clock.
The Bulldogs got the ball back
and gave it to Dade, who tried to
drive against Andrew Vlahov.
Keefe double-teamed him and the
two defenders forced him to miss
a layup with 42 seconds left. While
going for a steal, Tech knocked
the ball out of bounds with 33
seconds left and Brown stole the
inbounds pass to give the Bulldogs
new life.
After running down the clock,
Gibbs missed a three-pointer with
six seconds left and then John
Patrick made the first of a pair
of free throws after being fouled.
Brett Guillory's 55-foot heave
at the buzzer banked harmlessly
off the backboard and Stanford
was 4-0.
"It's a win," Montgomery said.
"It's not real pretty and it's not
the kind of basketball we are
going to need to play down the
stretch. ... I guess its good we
can win a game like this. Tech's
good — they're going to win some
games."
Lollie finished with 10 points
and Bruton broke the career best
he had set the night before by
grabbing a game-high 11
rebounds.
Friday night Stanford met what

it thought would be an over
matched Lehigh team with no
players over 6-7. The Engineers
(the guys on trains, not the guys
at Terman) surprised a few people
by hitting 5-of-6 three-pointers in
the first half to jump out to a
30-25 lead.
Stanford got the inßide game
going, however, and took a 34-32
lead into the locker room. Stan
ford scored the first eight points
of the second half and never
looked back. Ammann made 7-of-9
for the game to finish with 16
points and Stanford outrebounded
Lehigh 48-28 for the win.
"I think they took us by
surprise in the first half with
their outside shooting," Mont
gomery said. "Part of the reason
was we were kind of lazy. Once
we got a little bit more aggressive,
stopped letting them stand and
shoot, we got going a little better."
Lehigh defeated SMU 69-49 in
the consolation game.
Keefe and Ammann were joined
by Gibbs, Dade, Bob Krizansky of
Lehigh and John Colborne of
SMU on the all-tournament team.
Apple notes
This weekend's Apple Invitational
was well worth the price of admission
for Stanford students Sean Greenlee
and Nat Cousins.
Participating in Apple's halftime
shootout, both sophomores won Apple
Macintosh SE computers. Apple,
which hosts the tournament, gave
away a computer during halftime of
each of the four games. Ten names
were drawn for each shootout.
Greenlee, competing against nine
other Stanford students, tallied seven
points to bag his SE during Saturday's
championship. Cousins, Sports Editor
of The Daily, scored six points Friday
in the general public draw.

Junior Kenny Ammann, whose shooting in this weekend's Apple
Invitational melted Lehigh and Louisiana Tech's hopes for a title,
could provide the Cardinal with the outside shooting it sorely needs
in its upcoming season.
It may be winning ugly, but it beats
the heck out of losing.
Despite coming out slow in the first
halves of both games, the Cardinal
men's basketball team won its own Ap
ple Invitational for the fourth consecu
tive year by defeating Lehigh and Lou
isiana Tech at Maples Pavilion over the
weekend. The two victories moved Stan
ford to 4-0 on the young season, the
best start for a Cardinal club since 1985.

Men's Basketball
Stanford wins Apple Invitational.
The Cardinal trailed Lehigh 23-16
before pulling away and shot 27.7 per
cent in the first half against Louisiana
Tech, but the inside play of tournament
MVP Adam Keefe and the scoring of
all-tournament selection Kenny Am
mann helped Stanford take the title.
"We don't like to lose at home and
we don't like to lose our own tourna
ment," junior forward Deshon Wingate

said after scoring 21 points and pulling
down 11 rebounds for the weekend.
Stanford almost did lose at home for
the first time in over a year as the
Bulldogs took a 30-26 halftime lead in
the championship game. In the first
half, Stanford made l-of-15 three-point
shots as Tech played a sagging man-to
man defense that clogged the low post
so Keefe and center Derek Bruton could
not get the ball.
The night before, against Lehigh,
Keefe had 19 points and a career-high
15 rebounds and Bruton had the best
game of his career, getting 17 points
and eight rebounds, both personal bests.
"I rolled the dice," Bulldog Coach
Jerry Loyd said. "I decided our strategy
would be to let Stanford beat us from
the outside. I didn't want those two
guys to maul us inside. I was sitting
pretty for a while."
With the defense so packed in, the
Cardinal shooters were so wide open
they couldn't pass up shots. The prob
lem, according to Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery, was that the shooters
hesitated to see if they would be
guarded. When they realized the shot
was open and decided to the ball fly,
they were out of sync.
"They just played real soft," he said

of the Bulldogs. "It's a gamble, but it's
smart. We fell into the trap. The result
was we shot out of rhythm, out of mo
tion and out of patience."
The only saving grace was the play
of freshman point guard Marcus Lollie,
who got a lot of playing time when
Ammann picked up three fouls in under
sVfc minutes. Lollie buried two 18-
footers and hit four free throws to lead
Stanford at the half with eight points.
"I just felt that I had to come in and
get the offense going and establish a
rhythm," Lollie said.
A halflime talk with Montgomery also
helped the Cardinal solve the defense.
"We just tried to be more patient," Mont
gomery said. "It's just, 'Why shoot 15
three-pointers when the guy's 10 feet
off you? Take the ball in to about 16
feet and set yourself.'
"We shot 56 percent — same scenario
