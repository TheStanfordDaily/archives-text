# Stanford says Amen for Ammann
## 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
He was great. No, incredible. No,
unconscious.
Stanford's Kenny Ammann had an
unconscious shooting performance in
this weekend's Apple Invitiational,
helping the host Cardinal to wins over
Lehigh and Louisiana Tech.
Ammann, a redshirt junior guard
who transfered from Rancho Santiago
Junior College in Santa Anna, Calif,
two years ago, lit up the Maples Pa
vilion scoreboard for 14 points in Sat
urday's championship game after hit
ting for 16 points Friday. For the tour

nament, he shot an amazing 13-of-16
from the floor, including 4-of-6 on
three-pointers.
Ammann's hot hand came during a
cold spell for most of the rest of the
Stanford team, which shot a combined
39 percent from the field over the two
games. His steady shooting Saturday
offset twin 2-of-13 performances by
backcourt mate John Patrick and for
ward Andrew Vlahov.
Ammann also handed out six assists
over the weekend and played two
steady defensive games. In the first
half of the game against Lehigh, Am
mann showed his quickness with a
steal for a break-away lay-up.

In the championship game, Am
mann hit two long jumpers early but
then drew three quick personal fouls
and had to sit down for the rest of
the first half. Stanford ended the half
down 30-26.
He returned in the second stanza
and promptly sank a three-pointer
from the far left corner, drawing the
Cardinal to within one. Two minutes
later, Ammann drove baseline and
sank a running four-footer to tie the
game. Another three-pointer with ten
minutes left put Stanford up for good.
With 41 seconds remaining, Ammann
pulled down a rebound that all
but sealed the win.
Ammann joined forward Adam
Keefe as Stanford's representa
tives on the all-tournament team.
So, Kenny, great tournament?
"I was happy," Ammann said.
"It was nice to get a win, espe
cially when the team didn't play
all that well."
Asked if he is being asked to
provide the bulk of the outside
scoring this year, Ammann played
down his importance.
"We've got a lot of good
shooters," he said. "John (Patrick)
can shoot, and Andrew (Vlahov)
will be back. Look for a lot more
three-pointers in the future."
Ammann has been starting at
off-guard, but Coach Mike Mont
gomery likes to rotate freshmen
Marcus Lollie and Kenny Hicks

into the backcourt for significant
minutes. Ammann got his 14
points Saturday in only 22
minutes.
This situation works fine for
Ammann, who is finally getting
to play after being slowed all of
last year with a bad back.
"He (Coach Montgomery) is just
giving us all a good look," he said.
"So far it's working out pretty
well — we're 4-0."
Ammann's long-range excel
lence has helped make up for the
loss of marksman Todd Lichti,
who now plays for the NBA's Den
ver Nuggets, and of Terry Taylor,
the all-time Pacific 10 Conference
leader in career three-pointers.
Montgomery conservatively
calls Ammann "one of our better
percentage shooters. . . . He's
going to get even better, get more
confidence with his shot."
Judging by his numbers this
past weekend, Kenny Ammann
looks pretty confident already.
He was great. No, incredible. No,
