He was great. No, incredible. No,
unconscious.
Stanford's Kenny Ammann had an
unconscious shooting performance in
this weekend's Apple Invitiational,
helping the host Cardinal to wins over
Lehigh and Louisiana Tech.
Ammann, a redshirt junior guard
who transfered from Rancho Santiago
Junior College in Santa Anna, Calif,
two years ago, lit up the Maples Pa

Ammann also handed out six assists
over the weekend and played two
steady defensive games. In the first
half of the game against Lehigh, Am

In the championship game, Am
mann hit two long jumpers early but
then drew three quick personal fouls

the first half. Stanford ended the half
down 30-26.
He returned in the second stanza
and promptly sank a three-pointer
from the far left corner, drawing the
Cardinal to within one. Two minutes
later, Ammann drove baseline and
sank a running four-footer to tie the
game. Another three-pointer with ten
minutes left put Stanford up for good.
With 41 seconds remaining, Ammann
