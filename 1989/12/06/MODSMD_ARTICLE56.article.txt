# Happy holiday hopes: basketball wins and volleyball title
## 
### 
As a transplanted New Yorker, it's
hard to get into the Christmas
spirit when it's 75 degrees and
sunny in good ol' California.
Luckily — with temperatures barely
reaching 50 of late — that isn't a problem
this year.
It makes it so easy to get into the
holiday spirit, spread good cheer and
think happy thoughts.
To wit:
The women's volleyball team heads
south this week, to warmer climates in
cidentally, coming off what was arguably
its best match of the year. The Cardinal
spiked USC in four games Thursday
night at Burnham Pavilion and looked
strong.
Stanford had hoped to face Washington
in the regional semifinal to exact revenge
for last year's season-ending loss in the
same round of NCAA tournament. In
addition, the Husky women defeated the

Cardinal in one of their two meetings
this season.
Those plans went awry when the Cow
girls of Wyoming decimated Washington
Saturday night. That means Stanford will
face the nation's 18th-ranked team in
stead of No. 10 Washington, a lucky break
of sorts.
Should the Cardinal get by that match,
the squad will likely face UCLA with a

Final Four bid on the line. The Bruins
are ranked No. 1 and they too have spe
cial motivation. Seemingly an unstop
pable juggernaut in 1988, UCLA was
derailed on the road to a national cham
pionship by Texas.
A Cardinal triumph in unfriendly
Pauley Pavilion would be a tall order but
is still within the realm of possibility.
Kristin Klein and Bev Oden continue to
star as the big guns in the Stanford
arsenal. Lately though, the squad has
gotten a big boost from the resurgence
of captain Laura Olesen who is making
a strong bid to close out her college career
in grand fashion.
To best the Bruins, Stanford needs a
perfect match and perhaps a secret
weapon. Senior Jennifer Chaffee hasn't
seen much action recently, but has the
ability to be that weapon. Whether she,
or someone else, will provide what the
Cardinal needs to confound UCLA and

snatch a spot in the Final Four will be
come apparent soon enough.
The one thing that is certain, however,
is that Stanford has chosen a good time
to put things together and the team
promises to make things exciting. A
surprise trip to Hawaii and the national
semifinals would be a well-deserved
Christmas present.
Yet another of the wonderful
wonders on the Stanford sports
scene is the men's basketball team.
While no one is suggesting that wins over
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, UC-Irvine,
Lehigh and Lousiana Tech means the
squad is headed for the top-20 ranking
it earned last year, 4-0 is, well, a perfect
start.
Ironically, the team isn't even really
playing that well. The Cardinal hasn't
put together a solid first half and has
struggled with its outside shooting. All

that bad news is actually good news, for
it means Stanford can get better.
The buzzword is execution. If the Car
dinal starts executing its offensive and
defensive schemes, Coach Mike Mont
gomery will feel less desire to execute
some of the players.
Just how good the team will be should
become apparent in the coming weeks.
The road test against Santa Clara Dec.
18 will give Stanford a chance to dem
onstrate its ability to win outside of
Maples against solid opposition.
A golden opportunity could come two
weeks later when the Cardinal gets a
shot at No. 2-ranked Kansas in the BMA
Holiday Classic. ESPN commentator Dick
Vitale said the Jay hawks would win 17
in a row before losing. A Stanford upset
isn't likely, but ...
The Cardinal has found a way to win


MARK ROGOWSKY
a couple of games the past few
seasons no one gave them a
chance in. The Jayhawks, inciden
tally, execute well, running their
offense to perfection and helping
out on defense. Athletically, they
will not blow too many teams
away
To win, Stanford will have to
hit the three-pointer, a shot many
of the team's players are capable
of making but only Kenny Am
mann has hit on consistently so
far. If John Patrick and Andrew
Vlahov get hot from behind the
arc, the Cardinal should be in the
game all the way.
The reason is twofold. First, as
many math whizzes point out,
three adds up faster than two.
Second, the outside game will
force Kansas to extend the de
fense, freeing up Adam Keefe in
the post. There are few defenders
in the country who can stop the
big redhead one-on-one in the
blocks.
Final note: Friday, Dec. 15 is
the last day of final's week.
It also happens to be the
date of one of the year's biggest
sporting events at Stanford. The
Tennessee women's basketball
team — ranked No. 1 and the
defending national champions —
will visit Maples for a showdown
with the No. 3 Cardinal.
Last season, Tennessee dusted
Stanford in Knoxville and the
Cardinal is gunning for revenge.
If you're still around Friday night,
head on down and cheer like
you're at a Stanford-Arizona
men's game.
The women run and stun with
the best of the them and are a
lot of fun to watch.
Merry Christmas. Happy
Chanukah.
