# Card spikers set NCAA title sights
## Path to the championship winds through Los Angeles 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
After playing what Coach Don Shaw
called the team's "best match of the
year," the Stanford women's volleyball
team moved a step to closer toward the
national championship that has eluded
the Cardinal program for seven years
now. But it was a small step on a very
long road.
The Cardinal, by defeating the West
Region's sixth-seeded USC last Thurs
day, advances to Friday's regional semi
final in Los Angeles to play the High
Country Athletic Conference Cham
pions, the Wyoming Cowgirls.
Wyoming, seeded seventh in the West
Region, improved its season record to
23-6 by upsetting the second-seeded
Washington Huskies in Seattle Saturday
night. The Cowgirls hit .311 as a team
en route to a 15-9, 15-8, 15-10 sweep
of Washington.
Although Wyoming is a lower seed
than Washington, the Cardinal did not
necessarily want the Cowgirls to win.
Stanford was hoping to avenge a four
game home loss to the Huskies on Nov.
17 that gave Washington a tie with Stan
ford for second place in the Pacific 10
Conference. That victory also gave
Washington the higher seed in the West
Region (but that didn't impress
Wyoming).
The Cardinal players also looked for
ward to avenging an upset-loss to the
Huskies in last year's regional semi
finals. Washington, by defeating a 28-2
Cardinal team, broke Stanford's string
of six consecutive Final Four appear
ances.
"Washington has given us so much
trouble in the past," Shaw said. "I don't
know who the players wanted to play,

but seeing a different team will be nice."
It may be a refreshing break from
the Pac-10 bloodbath, but Wyoming will
not roll over for the Cardinal. The Cow
girls lost their first five matches of the
year before winning 23 of their last 24.
Wyoming lost only six games in a 13-
match mid-season winning streak. After
losing to Brigham Young in Provo, Utah
(the Cowgirls' only conference loss),
Wyoming rolled up another 10 consecu
tive victories while losing only seven
games in the process.
In short, Wyoming is very hot right
now.
Because the region's top seed, No.
1-ranked UCLA, won their opening
round match against Pepperdine, the
Bruins will host the West Region Semi
finals and Final in Pauley Pavilion this

Volleyball vs. Wyoming
FRIDAY — The West Regional semifinal match featuring Stanford and Wyoming will
begin at 8:30 p.m. The other semifinal, between UCLA and Arizona, will kick off at
6:30 p m. Both matches will be played in Pauley Pavilion at UCLA.
SATUROAY — The West Regional championship match will begin at 7:30 p.m.
RECORDS — Stanford (18-11, ranked No 8 nationally), Wyoming (23-6, ranked No. 18),
Arizona (18-12, ranked No 13), UCLA (28-2, ranked No 1).
SERIES — Stanford has won both matches that Wyoming and the Cardinal have played.
Stanford swept the Cowgirls 15-8, 15-9, 15-10 in the semifinals of the 1982 Tachikara
Invitational in Stockton, Calif. Stanford won the rematch in Laramie 15-9, 15-11, 15-7
on Sept. 8, 1987.
COWGIRL UPDATE — Sophomore middle blocker Judy Peck hit 423 and added three
blocks to lead Wyoming to an upset victory over Washington in a first-round regional
match in Seattle. Senior outside hitter Darcy Cudabeck added 14 kills and five blocks
to pace an offense that pounded out a .311 team hitting percentage Cudabeck is
hitting .319 for the season and leads the team in kills with 522. Peck leads the team
in hitting percentage at .329 and in blocks with 118
CARDINAL UPDATE — Sophomore outside hitter Kristin Klein and freshman middle
blocker Bev Oden, both 1989 All-Pacific 10 Conference selections, paced the Cardinal
to a four-game victory over USC, hitting .357 a piece. Freshman setter Carrie Feldman,
who was named to tho conference's All-Freshman team, assisted 42 times and added
15 digs On the year, Oden leads the team in hitting at 377 and in solo blocks, with
41, and block assists, with 134.

Friday and Saturday night.
"This is a different situation for us,"
Shaw said. "We're playing an opponent
we haven't seen before on a neutral
court."
The neutral site will have the same
effect on Wyoming, Stanford and fifth
seed Arizona as well. Pauley is strictly
the domain of UCLA, where the Bruins
are undefeated in Pac-10 play the last
two seasons. That fact favors UCLA
over the Wildcats in the first region
semifinal. UCLA has won four matches
in a row over Arizona.
Stanford, should the Cardinal defeat
Wyoming and advance to play UCLA,
will have a hard time defeating the
Bruins. Stanford lost in five games to
UCLA in Pauley Oct. 5 and was swept
at home Nov. 3.
