##

Although it is still 1989, the
Stanford women's swim team has
already proven it has a leg up on
the competition in 1990.
With two groups of swimmers
competing on either coast, the

defending NCAA champions have
shown they will be hard to knock
off this season.
Five of Stanford's top swim
mers went to the U.S. Open
Championships in Orlando, Fla.,
and through the first two days of
the three-day meet, Cardinal
swimmers had won three events

and had 12 top-eight finishes.
In Long Beach, Calif., the
remainder of the Stanford team
competed at the Trojan Grand
Prix Invitational. California had
its teams rested and shaved for
the meet, but Stanford still held
its own despite lacking that ad
vantage, finishing second to the

Bears.
In Orlando, freshman Janet
Evans won her 27th straight race
Sunday, taking the 400-meter
freestyle. Her streak, which dated
back to 1987, ended a few minutes
later, however, when she placed
second swimming the 200-meter
backstroke for the first time ever
in a national meet. Evans did
finish nearly two seconds ahead
of world record-holder Betsy
Mitchell, however.
Evans won the 400-meter indi
vidual medley and took third in
the 200-meter freestyle Monday.
"I asked Janet if the winning
streak she had was important to
her and she said, 'No.' " Coach
Richard Quick said. "I feel the
important thing is for her to swim
all the races and swim against
the best competition. Janet is a
very, very good in the backstroke
but it's not her best event."
The Cardinal's other winner
was freshman Janel Jorgensen,
who easily beat the international
field in the 100-meter butterfly.
Jorgensen also had an eighth in
the 200-meter IM.
Michelle Griglione took fifth in
the 200-meter IM and seventh in
both the 100-meter butterfly and
the 400-meter IM and freshman
Lori Heisick took sixth in the 100-
meter breaststroke.
Jorgernsen, Dede Trimble,
Griglione and Evans took second
in the 800-meter freestyle relay
and Trimble, Heisick, Jorgensen

Competing against some of the best swimmers in the world, junior Michelle Griglione raced to fifth
n the 200-meter IM and seventh in both the 100-meter butterfly and 400-meter IM this past week at
:he U.S. Open in Orlando, Fla.
and Griglione placed third in 400-
meter medley relay.
"I think we're doing very well
considering the fact that we've
been training hard to prepare a
background for the rest of the
year," Coach Richard Quick said.
"You have to lay the background
and the background hurts you
speedwise early in the season."
In Long Beach, sophomore
Karen Kraemer had three second
place finishes to lead the Cardinal.

Kraemer was the runner-up in
the 500-yard freestyle, the 400
IM and the 1,650 free, which was
won by teammate Barb Metz.
Susannah Miller joined Metz in
the winners' circle, winning the
200 backstroke, and Suzy Buck
ovich took second in the 100 but
terfly.
"We did great," said Asst. Coach
Mike Chasson, who went with the
team to Long Beach. "We're way
ahead of last year at this time.
The times were outstanding. We
weren't tapered, but we just rose
to the occasion against the com
petition."
