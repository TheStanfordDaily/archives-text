## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Although it is still 1989, the
Stanford women's swim team has
already proven it has a leg up on
the competition in 1990.
With two groups of swimmers
competing on either coast, the

defending NCAA champions have
shown they will be hard to knock
off this season.
Five of Stanford's top swim
mers went to the U.S. Open
Championships in Orlando, Fla.,
and through the first two days of
the three-day meet, Cardinal
swimmers had won three events

and had 12 top-eight finishes.
In Long Beach, Calif., the
remainder of the Stanford team
competed at the Trojan Grand
Prix Invitational. California had
its teams rested and shaved for
the meet, but Stanford still held
its own despite lacking that ad
vantage, finishing second to the

Bears.
In Orlando, freshman Janet
Evans won her 27th straight race
Sunday, taking the 400-meter
freestyle. Her streak, which dated
back to 1987, ended a few minutes
later, however, when she placed
second swimming the 200-meter
backstroke for the first time ever
in a national meet. Evans did
finish nearly two seconds ahead
of world record-holder Betsy
Mitchell, however.
Evans won the 400-meter indi
vidual medley and took third in
the 200-meter freestyle Monday.
"I asked Janet if the winning
streak she had was important to
her and she said, 'No.' " Coach
Richard Quick said. "I feel the
important thing is for her to swim
all the races and swim against
the best competition. Janet is a
very, very good in the backstroke
but it's not her best event."
The Cardinal's other winner
was freshman Janel Jorgensen,
who easily beat the international
field in the 100-meter butterfly.
Jorgensen also had an eighth in
the 200-meter IM.
Michelle Griglione took fifth in
the 200-meter IM and seventh in
both the 100-meter butterfly and
the 400-meter IM and freshman
Lori Heisick took sixth in the 100-
meter breaststroke.
Jorgernsen, Dede Trimble,
Griglione and Evans took second
in the 800-meter freestyle relay
and Trimble, Heisick, Jorgensen
