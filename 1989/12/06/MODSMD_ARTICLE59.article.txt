# Men cruise to third

Very few sports demand that
you understand the importance
of a good rest and a shave.
But to understand why the
Stanford men's swimming
team was satisfied with last
weekend's performance at the
Trojan Grand Prix Invitational
in Long Beach, you must rec
ognize the tremendous differ
ence a clean shave can make.
In a meet bringing together
USC, California, Arizona State,
UCLA and Long Beach, the
Cardinal finished much more
than a hair out of first and
was unable to place any swim
mers among the top 10 indi
vidual scorers.
As a team, the squad finished
a distant third behind USC and
California. Still, under the cir
cumstances, Stanford, which
last month upended defending
national champion Texas,
seemed extraordinarily pleased
with the performance.
"As a team, we have to be
extremely happy with the way
we swam," senior co-captain
Rick Gould said. "We were the
only team there that was not
shaved and rested for this
meet. This was obviously a big
disadvantage for the team scor
ing."
Training for swimming is a
process of breaking down
muscles to get them into
aerobic shape and then allow
ing the muscles to recover so

that, at the point of an impor
tant event, the muscles have
been strengthened. When the
muscles are prepped for peak
performance, swimmers shave
to gain an extra physical and
psychological advantage.
"Shaving not only takes off
the hair but also a couple of
layers of dead skin, which
makes the skin more sensitive
to the water," Gould said. "You
get a better feel for the water
and are more powerful."
A conflict in training
philosophies worked to Stan
ford's disadvantage in this
meet. Both USC and California
started training a month ear
lier than Stanford, and, conse
quently, their muscles had
recovered fully enough that
they decided to shave in order
to make their NCAA cuts early
in the season.
The Cardinal, on the other
hand, is still entrenched in the
middle of breaking down the
swimmers' muscles.
"What Stanford traditionally
does is not to shave until Pac
10s in order to make NCAA
cuts there," Gould said.
Despite this immediate dis
advantage, the Cardinal still
swam well enough this week
end to leave Arizona State and
UCLA behind. While most of
the other squads were
separated by increments of
about 100 points, the Sun
Devils and the Cardinal had
