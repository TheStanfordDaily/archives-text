# Fencers slay Spartans

Stanford continued to dominate
West Coast fencers Saturday at
Roble Gym by pointedly defeating
San Jose State in Stanford's sec
ond dual meet of the season.
The men's team never trailed
in the meet and recorded a final
victory of 16-11. Likewise, the
women's team matched its per
formance against Cal two weeks
ago, downing the Spartan squad
14-2. "Stanford has a much
stronger women's team this year
than in the past," San Jose State
Coach Peter Burchard said.
According to Cardinal men's
Coach Zoran Tulum, the score
does not fairly describe Stanford's
control of the meet. "I wanted to
give everyone a chance to fence,"
he said. "We could have won by
much more if I didn't want every
one on the team to get some ex
perience."
Out of the 20 men that com
prise the men's team, only two
epee fencers did not have the
chance to compete.
Both Stanford coaches ap
proached the meet with the idea
that it would be good practice.
The men compete in three divi
sions which differ — for the most
part — by the thickness of the
blade and the legal target area.
The foil and epee are both thrust

ing weapons, while the saber is
also a slashing weapon. The men
recorded 7-2 and 5-4 victories,
respectively, in foil and sabre.
Sophomore Nick Bravin, who
according to women's coach
Sherry Posthumus, should make
the national team, went unde
feated in both foil and saber.
In addition, the Cardinal won
the saber division without the
benefit of its number-one saber
fencer, Leonard D'Amico, who is
in New York competing in a
United States Fencing Association
Circuit Event.
San Jose State won the epee
category 5-4. According to Tulum,
however, because the Spartans
maintain only a club-level team,
they were able to bring several
fencers with many years of expe
rience.
With the exception of team cap
tain Richard Reader, Tulum said,
"None of our fencers even had
two years experience." Zoran also
said that he wanted to give the
Spartan team some good compe
tition rather than using all of his
best fencers throughout the meet.
"San Jose State is always a
pleasant team to fence, but
beating them isn't always as easy
as it would seem," Reader said.
"They bring some guys with ex
perience. It was a good meet for
us."
