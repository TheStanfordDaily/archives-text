# Roble stuns Six Jerks for IM crown
## 
### Rob Johnstone Staff writer 
For the two weeks preceding
the Super Bowl, there is no
hiding from the media hype.
Then comes Super Bowl Sunday,
which often turns out to be a
rout.
While the play may not have
been as crisp, and there was no
Bud Bowl during timeouts, Sun
day's intramural football finals
were much more exciting, with
two of the four finals being
decided by an extra point and
another decided in triple
overtime.
For the second straight year,
the B-league football final went
into overtime. Last year, 553
Mayfield beat Kappa Sigma in
an overtime final. This year, it
was the surprising Roble IB
team which came out the cham
pions in the overtime battle,
beating Six Jerks and a Squirt,
19-13.
In other finals, Biz 1A staged
a mild upset in the A-league
final, beating the more experi
enced Biz 2A team, 7-6. In the
coed final, Geek Mystique edged
Grateful Med by an identical
score, 7-6.
The Roble-Six Jerks game un

folded as a defensive struggle,
as both teams went scoreless un
til the end of the first half. Roble
quarterback Scott Alvarez broke
the scoreless tie when he hit
wide receiver Pat Johnston in
the end zone with a 5-yard pass
on the last play of the half.
Roble's extra point try failed,
giving it a 6-0 halftime lead.

IM Sports Report

Six Jerks and a Squirt opened
the second stanza with a
seemingly unstoppable drive,
highlighted by a 50-yard pass
play to the Roble 5-yard line.
Roble's defense then came up
with what turned out to be a
huge goal-line stand.
Aided by a key sack on second
and-goal from the 1-yard line,
Roble turned back the Six Jerks
offense and regained possession
of the football.
Six Jerks and Roble then
traded touchdowns, with Roble
ending up with a 13-7 lead as
the game clock wound down un
der two minutes. Six Jerks
marched down the field with rel
ative ease on its final drive in
regulation, capping the drive

with a 40-yard touchdown pass
with 40 seconds remaining in
the game.
The touchdown tied the score
at 13-13, with the Six Jerks pre
paring to attempt the winning
extra point. Roble put on a
strong rush on the extra point
play, which forced the Six Jerks
quarterback to hurry his throw
— incomplete.
Six Jerks was again unable to
capitalize on a great scoring op
portunity in the first 3-minute
overtime. With less than 15
seconds remaining in the first
overtime, Six Jerks had three
opportunities at a winning
touchdown from inside the Roble
15-yard line but was unable to
convert.
The teams traded possessions
in the second overtime period,
with neither squad able to put
a substantial drive together. Fi
nally, in the third overtime,
Roble moved deep into Six Jerks
territory. Faced with a key
fourth-and-one from the Six
Jerks 19-yard line with 37
seconds remaining, Roble quar
terback Alvarez found releasing
lineman Scott Poholsky for a
first-down at the 12.
On the next play, Alvarez hit

Travan Jasper in the corner of
the end zone for a 19-13 Roble
victory. In the tradition of great
crowds, the numerous Roble
fans swarmed the field, some
how overcoming the riot police
and guard dogß stationed on the
field to hold the crowd back.
In the A-league final, Biz 1A
opened the game with a strong
scoring drive, capped by a 25-
yard touchdown pass. Quarter
back Craig Landis found receiver
Matt Landa open in the corner
of the end zone, putting Biz 1A
up early, 7-0.
Biz 2A came right back on the
next play, beginning its first pos
session with a 50-yard pass com
pletion. It finally scored on a
5-yard touchdown pass, but
missed the extra point to trail
7-6. This turned out to be all
the scoring in the game, but not
because of a lack of opportunity.
With under two minutes
remaining in the first half, Biz
2A moved the ball inside Biz
lA's 15-yard line. Biz 2A then
threw four passes into the end
zone, all of them falling incom
plete. As neither team was able
to score in the second half, Biz
1A came out with a hard-fought
7-6 victory.

with neither squad able to put
a substantial drive together. Fi
nally, in the third overtime,
Roble moved deep into Six Jerks
territory. Faced with a key
fourth-and-one from the Six
Jerks 19-yard line with 37
seconds remaining, Roble quar
terback Alvarez found releasing
lineman Scott Poholsky for a
first-down at the 12.
On the next play, Alvarez hit

Travan Jasper in the corner of
the end zone for a 19-13 Roble
victory. In the tradition of great
crowds, the numerous Roble
fans swarmed the field, some
how overcoming the riot police
and guard dogß stationed on the
field to hold the crowd back.
In the A-league final, Biz 1A
opened the game with a strong
scoring drive, capped by a 25-
yard touchdown pass. Quarter
back Craig Landis found receiver
Matt Landa open in the corner
of the end zone, putting Biz 1A
up early, 7-0.
Biz 2A came right back on the
next play, beginning its first pos
session with a 50-yard pass com
pletion. It finally scored on a
5-yard touchdown pass, but
missed the extra point to trail
7-6. This turned out to be all
the scoring in the game, but not
because of a lack of opportunity.
With under two minutes
remaining in the first half, Biz
2A moved the ball inside Biz
lA's 15-yard line. Biz 2A then
threw four passes into the end
zone, all of them falling incom
plete. As neither team was able
to score in the second half, Biz
1A came out with a hard-fought
7-6 victory.
For the two weeks preceding
the Super Bowl, there is no
hiding from the media hype.
Then comes Super Bowl Sunday,
which often turns out to be a
rout.
While the play may not have
been as crisp, and there was no
Bud Bowl during timeouts, Sun
day's intramural football finals
were much more exciting, with
two of the four finals being
decided by an extra point and
another decided in triple
overtime.
For the second straight year,
the B-league football final went
into overtime. Last year, 553
Mayfield beat Kappa Sigma in
an overtime final. This year, it
was the surprising Roble IB
team which came out the cham
pions in the overtime battle,
beating Six Jerks and a Squirt,
19-13.
In other finals, Biz 1A staged
a mild upset in the A-league
final, beating the more experi
enced Biz 2A team, 7-6. In the
coed final, Geek Mystique edged
Grateful Med by an identical
score, 7-6.
The Roble-Six Jerks game un

folded as a defensive struggle,
as both teams went scoreless un
til the end of the first half. Roble
quarterback Scott Alvarez broke
the scoreless tie when he hit
wide receiver Pat Johnston in
the end zone with a 5-yard pass
on the last play of the half.
Roble's extra point try failed,
giving it a 6-0 halftime lead.

Six Jerks and a Squirt opened
the second stanza with a
seemingly unstoppable drive,
highlighted by a 50-yard pass
play to the Roble 5-yard line.
Roble's defense then came up
with what turned out to be a
huge goal-line stand.
Aided by a key sack on second
and-goal from the 1-yard line,
Roble turned back the Six Jerks
offense and regained possession
of the football.
Six Jerks and Roble then
traded touchdowns, with Roble
ending up with a 13-7 lead as
the game clock wound down un
der two minutes. Six Jerks
marched down the field with rel
ative ease on its final drive in
regulation, capping the drive

with a 40-yard touchdown pass
with 40 seconds remaining in
the game.
The touchdown tied the score
at 13-13, with the Six Jerks pre
paring to attempt the winning
extra point. Roble put on a
strong rush on the extra point
play, which forced the Six Jerks
quarterback to hurry his throw
— incomplete.
Six Jerks was again unable to
capitalize on a great scoring op
portunity in the first 3-minute
overtime. With less than 15
seconds remaining in the first
overtime, Six Jerks had three
opportunities at a winning
touchdown from inside the Roble
15-yard line but was unable to
convert.
