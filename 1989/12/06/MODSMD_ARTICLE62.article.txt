# Cardinal women shoot for strong Volunteers
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The box score still hangs on the wall of
Coach Tar a VanDerveer's office as a grim
reminder. The Lady Vols of Tennessee took
the Cardinal women's basketball team to
school, 83-60, in Knoxville last Dec. 18.
The Volunteers went on to capture the
national championship.
VanDerveer still remembers how Tennes
see's 50-32 rebounding edge killed Stan
ford. More frightening still is that the Lady
Vols converted on only 14 of 30 free-throw
attempts. Realistically, the margin of vic
tory could have been 30.
That was then.
VanDerveer, ever the pessimist, actually
called Tennessee "beatable." Not surpris
ingly, she stressed rebounding as the Car
dinal's key to victory in the Dec. 15 rematch
at Maples Pavilion.
She noted that Stanford had to close the
gap in offensive boards — where Tennessee
had a two-to-one edge last season — and
defensive boards as well. The Cardinal
would like to run against the Lady Vols
and will have to rebound on the defensive
end to do that.
If Stanford is successful there, the team
has the kind of explosiveness to present
problems for the nation's top-ranked team.
"We've got to excel offensively," sophomore
Martha Richards said. "We've got enough
offensive firepower to beat them."
Richards and VanDerveer both noted
that having the game on the last day of
finals was less than ideal. But that obstacle
to proper preparation wasn't dimming their
enthusiasm. "We're all really excited," Ric
hards said.
She and her teammates are on a mission.
"Until we beat them, we haven't proved
anything (as far as being one of the best
teams in the country)," Richards noted,
adding it was time to make a breakthrough.
She summed it up this way: "Like the

'Until we beat them, we ha
ven't proved anything (as
far as being one of the best
teams in the country).'

Nike commercial says, 'Just do it.' H
Before facing Tennessee, Stanford has to
contend with San Diego State in the Car
dinal's home opener Sunday. The Aztecs
are working to overcome the loss of three
starters, but VanDerveer isn't looking past
them.
The game will be Stanford's first since
Nov. 25 and the last until the Lady Vols
come to town. Tennessee, on the other
hand, will have played seven times, giving
it a much greater opportunity to hone its
game against live competition.
But Stanford isn't whining about finals
or fewer games. Instead, the squad is get
ting down to business. VanDerveer said
the team was working hard on shoring up
its post defense. That is an area where
Stanford will have to take its game to a
new level if it is to beat the Tennessees
and the Louisiana Techs of the world.
The Lady Vols top low-post player is
6-foot-3 junior Daedra Charles. It will be
up to sophomore Julie Zeilstra and fresh
man Val Whiting to contain Charles. Those
two and junior Trisha Stevens will have
to be Windex-like in cleaning the glass.
Tennessee's 5-10 guard Tonya Edwards
leads the way, running the offense to near
perfection. But Stanford senior Jennifer
Azzi, a Tennessee native, teams with junior
Sor\ja Henning to form the nation's best
backcourt.
No matter what the outcome, the Car
dinal may wind up facing the Lady Vols
again on their home court with the national
crown on the line.
