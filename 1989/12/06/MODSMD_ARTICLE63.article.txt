Kaes, a professor of German
literature at the University of Cal
ifornia, Berkeley, who earned his
doctorate at Stanford, offers con
vincing reasons why film is a pow
erful medium worthy of historical
study. First, unlike academic ar
ticles or political speeches, films
have the ability to reach and affect
large audiences. Second, they are
effective at manipulating emo
tions: "to unlock hidden wishes
and fears, and liberate fantasies."
Finally, because of the power of
the visual, films leave a deep im
print on our memory. For Kaes,
films not only reflect certain at
titudes, but also shape and influ
ence the way people perceive their
past.
Therefore Kaes does not just
interpret movies as simple auton
omous artifacts, or as unique ex
pressions of an artist; instead, he
insists on reading them within
their historical context, seeing
them as both responding to and
functioning within a political and
social atmosphere. Kaes master
fully interweaves his interpreta
tion of narrative forms, cinematic
techniques and thematics with in

and political history in which the

From Hitler to Heimat:
The Return of History as Film
By Anton Kaes
Harvard University Press, $25.00
Reviewed by Ross Lewin
A country's national identity
manifests itself, in large part, in
the way it writes its history. It
should, therefore, comes as no
surprise that the Germans are
obsessed with trying to represent
their past in a new and more pos
itive light. In the preface of "From
Hitler to Heimat," Anton Kaes
notes: "No other country has

other, equally dangerous ways.
It all depends on the juxtaposi
tion and content of the images.
In his analysis of Kluge's "The
Patriot," for example, Kaes ex
plores how the filmmaker layers
documentary footage of bombs
falling from an airplane and bur
ning houses with a voice-over that
announces, "Let us not forget that
60,000 people burned to death in
Hamburg." In Syberberg's "Hit
ler: A Film From Germany" — a
movie enthusiastically received by

such American notables as Susan
Sontag — Kaes highlights a scene
in which the filmmaker represents
Hitler and the other Nazi leaders
as mere childrens' puppets.
Kaes suggests that such jux
tapositions legitimize current ef
forts by revisionists "to rewrite
German history in order to
relativize the crimes of the past."
Kaes points out that, while Syber
berg's use of puppets may imply
the banality of evil, such an image
also renders Nazi crimes "harm-

'A new focus on individual life stories and the
history of everyday life (rather than political
history), an emphasis on subjective memory,
a differently nuanced concern and empathy
with the Germans as victims... these are
some of the most visible tendencies in the
New German Cinema's recent attempts to
reevaluate and reappropriate German history.'

less and insignificant." This leads
the audience to believe that the
past was nothing more than a
children's game, that it did not
exist at all.
But Kaes deals with more than
postmodernist films in his analy
sis; he also shows that less preten
tious, more realistic films are
equally deceptive. Edgar Reitz's
epic "Heimat," a 16-hour televi
sion miniseries that was greeted
with excitement by West German
audiences, portrays the Nazi era
from the perspective of everyday
life in a small German village.
While Reitz's decision to write a
German "history from below"
gives a voice to historically un
derrepresented groups, his deci
sion to exclude the experiences of
Jews from his film lends credence
to the idea that the "simple Ger
man" knew nothing about
Auschwitz.
One may think that Kaes is
paranoid for dissecting a film
which seems so politically progres
sive, such as Helma Sander-
Brahm's feminist depiction of her
mother's wartime experience,
"Germany, Pale Mother." Al
legorizing the allegedly real
experiences of her mother in order
to prove that all women were vic
timized by the history men
created, she thereby denies the
fact that many women were

culprits during the Third Reich.
Kaes claims that even putatively
liberal films like this can reinforce
revisionist claims.
According to Kaes the motiva
tion for making films such as
these stems from a deep-rooted
resentment over having inherited
the legacy of the Third Reich from
their parents. He suggests that,
with the possible exception of
Rainer Werner Fassbinder's "The
Marriage of Maria Braun," these
filmmakers betray more anger
toward the American influence on
their culture than toward the
Nazi one. He insightfully shows
how Syberberg derived his inspi
ration to write a film that
resembled a Wagnerian opera
from frustration over the desic
cation of post-war German cul
ture by American consumerism.
Equally telling is Reitz's insis
tence on beginning his film with
a shot of a rock with the chiselled
inscription "Made in Germany."
In each of these cases, Kaes
reveals how Germans think their
past has been invaded, occupied
and expropriated, inverting the
traditional history. The Germans
suddenly replace the Jews as vic
tims.

timized in the present. Kaes shows

how in these films Germans long
for some kind of fairy-tale past,
in which they could claim in
nocence, unity and sovereignty.
This attitude produces images
such as Kluge's and Syberberg's
dream of a Kulturnation, and
Sander-Brahm's and Reitz's
yearning for a paradise lost, a
simple and innocent "heimat"
that never existed. Disturbingly,
Kaes' book suggests that even
many younger, innocent Germans
may themselves have inherited
this psychology from their par
ents.
With the prospect of Germany
becoming an economic super
power, one of today's biggest con
cerns is whether history is
doomed to repeat itself. After
World War I, many Germans felt
exceedingly insecure and resentful
for having lost the war; such
feelings led to the most terrifying
nationalism the world has ever
known. Though for the past 40
years West Germany has been
seen as a stable and solid par
liamentary democracy, Kaes' book
still gives us reason to believe that
Germany may still harbor in
securities and resentment.
At one point in"From Hitler
to Heimat," Kaes cites a chilling
quote that a German psychologist

drive Nazi structures out of the
world of education, of behavior,

genuine concern about the pres
