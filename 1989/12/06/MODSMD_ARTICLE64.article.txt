The Dead Magician

It couldn't have been an easy
trick to pull off, but in her first
novel, "The Dead Magician,"
Evelin Sullivan not only plays
with the notion of literary biog
raphy, but does it in an adopted
language.
Born in West Germany, Sul
livan moved to the United States
at the age of 18, where she
studied physics before receiving
her doctorate in English and
American literatures. Now a
visiting scholar and writing tutor
at Stanford, Sullivan writes with
a confidence and charm that
make "The Dead Magician" a
remarkable bock.
Written in the form of a biog
raphy, "The Dead Magician"
chronicles the spectacular life of
G. H. Bodamien, a world
renowned author who spends the
final three years of his life in
San Quentin for murdering his
older brother. The narrator,
Charles Butler, a professor of

English with a rather stuffed
shirt, recounts Bodamien's
poverty-stricken childhood in
Suffolk and Philadelphia, his
father's slow decline into insan
ity, and the emotionally complex,
adversarial relationship between
Bodamien and his brother Adam.
By following the development of
Bodamien's personal life and
literary career (during which he
spends a somewhat volatile quar
ter teaching at Stanford), Butler
attempts to understand his sub
ject's gruesome crime.
A simple factual account of
Bodamien*B life and misdeed
could have been the full scope
of Sullivan's novel. But "The
Dead Magician" marks itself as
truly noteworthy by reflecting
upon the nature of biography at
the same time that it purports
to be one. Although he presents
himself as an objective narrator,
Butler also reveals some of his
own past in the course of de
scribing Bodamien's life. As a
result, the reader begins to call
into question Butler's "un
biased" scholarship, as well as
his or her understanding of
Bodamien'B character.

Sullivan clouds the biograph
ical waters still further by in
cluding, as an appendix to
Butler's work, a draft of a novel
which Bodamien wrote during
his imprisonment. Titled "The
Case of the Dead Magician," the
unfinished work begins as a
humorous satire of detective
novels, but gradually changes in
tone, becoming both the author's
introspective account of his
fratricide and a commentary on
his biographer.
By providing these different
modes of access to Bodamien's
character, Sullivan highlights
the problems of writing literary
biography and manages to paint
a far richer portrait of Bodamien
than could have been achieved
through a single "objective" nar
rative. The picture of Bodamien
that emerges from Sullivan's
novel is provocative and highly
ambiguous.
"The Dead Magician" leaves
the reader with some serious,
enduring questions â€” what is
the relationship between a biog
rapher's personal life and the
character portrait he presents?
Can any individual know an

other through the lens of biog
raphy? But it's also a great deal
of fun. Sullivan's novel is ap
pealing on both an intellectual
and emotional level. Butler is
charming, but a nerd; erudite,
but filled with self-pity; arro
gant, but humorous.
When you read "The Dead
Magician," have patience with
Sullivan's sometimes unconvinc
ing plot devices: Butler's
self-indulgent discussion of his
past in the context of a literary
biography doesn't always work
(any good editor would have
deleted such digressions); and
Bodamien's novel, while fasci
nating, isn't good enough to be
the product of one of the
foremost literary intellects in the
English language.
But let these faults pass, and
you're sure to enjoy a novel that
inaugurates a career begun with
6clat.
