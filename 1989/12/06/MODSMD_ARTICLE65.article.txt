# California ruggers sweep Tens tourney
## 
### Mark Davies Staff writer 
Over 4,000 spectators wit
nessed Ten-A-Side rugby at its
finest last Saturday as Stanford
hosted the 21st annual Tens Tour
nament. Four teams competed for
Stanford, which finished the day
with a combined record of 7-5.
Stanford Rugby Coach Franck
Boivert was pleased with the
results. "Every team played with
great intensity and determina
tion," he said. "In addition, all
the players kept their composure
in the face of poor officiating and
during frustrating moments."
Boivert also saw the Tens as
being invaluable in that "it pro
vided me with a good opportunity
to review all of the players' abil
ities — it's very instructive for
future team selections."
California's alumni team, the
Old Blues — best known for being
featured in a recent BMW com

mercial — captured the A-division
title.
Cal itself exhibited its national
caliber play as it swept the B
division with a 4-0 record to
procure first place.
Cal and Stanford are both mem
bers of the Northern Division of
the Pacific Coast Collegiate Rugby
Conference, which has boasted a
national champion seven of the
last 10 years. As a result all of
Stanford's league games will be
tough matches.
Boivert responded to questions
concerning the upcoming season
positively. "I feel that we are very
much ahead of schedule compared
to last year," he said. "Our team
is extremely strong mentally,
which is the most important
quality a team can have."
The Cardinal will host five op
ponents in the 1989-90 season,
starting with Santa Clara Jan. 13.
All home games will be played on
Harry Maloney field.
