# Cagers count more wins in new year
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Winter break won't be that at
all for the Stanford basketball
team as the squad has seven
games scheduled before classes
resume again.
Stanford has a two-week
break over dead and finals week,
but the Cardinal returns to ac
tion Dec. 16 to put its perfect
4-0 record on the line. While the
team will leave the Bay Area
only once in that span, the op
position should prove a challenge
as the Cardinal prepares to begin
Pacific 10 Conference play.
Stanford has struggled some
what, especially in first halves,
but has managed to pull out
every game so far this season.
Coach Mike Montgomery is
happy with the 4-0 record but
feels his team needs to improve,
and the current two-week break
would be the perfect time for
that.
"We're certainly not playing
the kind of basketball we're ca
pable of," he said. "We have
some talent. I think we have to
work a little harder at practice
on playing at game speed. . . .
We just have to improve."
With the next seven games in

cluding everyone from Colgate
and first-year Division-I school
Missouri-Kansas City to second
ranked Kansas and Oregon
State, the Cardinal will be able
to accurately gauge its potential.
Here is the schedule that lies
ahead:
University of San Francisco
Maples — Dec. 16
The Dons are 1-2 this season
after opening with a come-from
behind win over UC-Irvine in
their opener. After trailing by as
much as 11 in the second half,
USF came back to beat the Ant
eaters. Since then, however, USF
has lost to Notre Dame and Cal
ifornia. Joel Deßortoli is the top
returning rebounder and scorer
and had a team-leading 18 points
and six rebounds in the loss to
Cal Saturday.
Santa Clara
Toso Pavilion — Dec. 18
Santa Clara is one of the
tougher games on the Cardinal's
non-league slate. The Broncos
upset St. Mary's, a top-20 team,
in Moraga last year and nearly
made the NCAA field. They are
off to a 2-2 start and opened the
season by nearly beating UCLA

in Pauley Pavilion. Like USF,
Santa Clara lost its best player
to graduation.
Colgate
Maples — Dec. 22
Colgate will come to Stanford
knowing what to expect at least.
Followers of Red Raider basket
ball can watch their team play
Lehigh in their last game prior
to coming to Stanford. Stanford
beat the Engineers fairly hand
ily, and Colgate is probably not
that good.
Missouri-Kansas City
BMA Holiday Classic at UMKC —
Dec. 29-30
The only time Stanford will
leave the Bay Area over Winter
break will be to play in a Christ
mas tournament in Kansas City.
The Kangaroos' top returning
scorer and rebounder is a 6-foot
-11 center named David Robin
son. No, not that David Robin
son, silly. This guy's a mere mor
tal.
Missouri-Kansas City only
joined the Division I ranks this
year. Stanford will likely meet
Kansas, who plays Texas-Pan
American in the other semifinal.
The Jayhawks did what no team

had ever done before, defeating
the No. 2 (LSU) and No. 1
(Nevada-Las Vegas) in back-to
back games en route to winning
the preseason NIT.
Oregon State
Maples — Jan. 5
"In my opinion, it's not us or
UCLA, but definitely Oregon
State. I don't think there's any
question that they're the best
team in the conference."
That was Arizona Coach Lute
Olson after the Beavers beat the
then-No. 2 Wildcats by 23 points
Saturday.
The Beavers, led by perhaps
the best point guard in the na
tion in Gary Payton, are for real.
They are also 3-0 and on a roll.
Oregon
Maples — Jan. 7
Oregon lost its last 10 Pac-10
games of last season and re
turned only one player who
averaged over six points a game
last year. So what do the Ducks
do but open the season with two
league wins, including a huge
upset of Arizona.
Senior swingman Keith
Reynolds is the top returnee.

the kind of basketball we're ca
pable of," he said. "We have
some talent. I think we have to
work a little harder at practice
on playing at game speed. . . .
We just have to improve."
With the next seven games in

cluding everyone from Colgate
and first-year Division-I school
Missouri-Kansas City to second
ranked Kansas and Oregon
State, the Cardinal will be able
to accurately gauge its potential.
Here is the schedule that lies
ahead:
University of San Francisco
Maples — Dec. 16
The Dons are 1-2 this season
after opening with a come-from
behind win over UC-Irvine in
their opener. After trailing by as
much as 11 in the second half,
USF came back to beat the Ant
eaters. Since then, however, USF
has lost to Notre Dame and Cal
ifornia. Joel Deßortoli is the top
returning rebounder and scorer
and had a team-leading 18 points
and six rebounds in the loss to
Cal Saturday.
Santa Clara
Toso Pavilion — Dec. 18
Santa Clara is one of the
tougher games on the Cardinal's
non-league slate. The Broncos
upset St. Mary's, a top-20 team,
in Moraga last year and nearly
made the NCAA field. They are
off to a 2-2 start and opened the
season by nearly beating UCLA

in Pauley Pavilion. Like USF,
Santa Clara lost its best player
to graduation.
Colgate
Maples — Dec. 22
Colgate will come to Stanford
knowing what to expect at least.
Followers of Red Raider basket
ball can watch their team play
Lehigh in their last game prior
to coming to Stanford. Stanford
beat the Engineers fairly hand
ily, and Colgate is probably not
that good.
Missouri-Kansas City
BMA Holiday Classic at UMKC —
Dec. 29-30
The only time Stanford will
leave the Bay Area over Winter
break will be to play in a Christ
mas tournament in Kansas City.
The Kangaroos' top returning
scorer and rebounder is a 6-foot
-11 center named David Robin
son. No, not that David Robin
son, silly. This guy's a mere mor
tal.
Missouri-Kansas City only
joined the Division I ranks this
year. Stanford will likely meet
Kansas, who plays Texas-Pan
American in the other semifinal.
The Jayhawks did what no team

had ever done before, defeating
the No. 2 (LSU) and No. 1
(Nevada-Las Vegas) in back-to
back games en route to winning
the preseason NIT.
Oregon State
Maples — Jan. 5
"In my opinion, it's not us or
UCLA, but definitely Oregon
State. I don't think there's any
question that they're the best
team in the conference."
That was Arizona Coach Lute
Olson after the Beavers beat the
then-No. 2 Wildcats by 23 points
Saturday.
The Beavers, led by perhaps
the best point guard in the na
tion in Gary Payton, are for real.
They are also 3-0 and on a roll.
Oregon
Maples — Jan. 7
Oregon lost its last 10 Pac-10
games of last season and re
turned only one player who
averaged over six points a game
last year. So what do the Ducks
do but open the season with two
league wins, including a huge
upset of Arizona.
Senior swingman Keith
Reynolds is the top returnee.
