# Wrestlers hold no aces at Las Vegas Invite
## Despite not placing wrestlers, Horpel pleased with results, impressed by competition 
### Jim Smith 
Stanford's wrestling team
traveled to Las Vegas over the
weekend and found out just how
tough it would be to crack the
top 20 as it faced 15 of those
teams at the Las Vegas Invita
tional. The Cardinal finished 30th
out of a field of 45.
"This was the toughest Las
Vegas tournament that I've seen,"
Coach Chris Horpel said. "Con
sidering the level of competition,
I think we wrestled fairly well."
Although no Cardinal grapplers
placed in the top eight, several
turned in excellent performances.
Junior Steve Buddie led the team,
coming one match from breaking
into the top eight. His final loss

was a close 10-6 decision at the
wrestler in the nation, Oklaho
ma's Chris Bollin.
Despite losing, Matt Topham
(158 pounds) and Dave Nowick
(118 pounds) were also impres
sive. Each wrestler faced eventual
top-eight placers but was able to
score consistently. Topham lost a
close bout, 6-4, to No. 16 Brandon
Dennington of Oklahoma.
"It's one thing to get beaten
badly, but it's another thing to be
able to challenge the tough com
petition we faced here," Horpel
said. "I think we may have been
a little intimidated at first and
that hurt us in the early rounds,
but we looked a lot better after
that."
Mark Graham (167 pounds) and

Ron Perry (190 pounds) were two
Card wrestlers who were not in
timidated early. Graham won his
initial match handily, 7-2, before
losing his first match of the
season, 8-7, to Wisconsin's Matt
Abad. Perry was dominant in his
7-0 first round victory but lost
his second match, 5-2, to 16th
ranked Chris Nelson of Nebraska.
"This tournament was a good
experience for us," Horpel said.
"When you get close matches like
these, you can win by bullying
your opponent and throwing him
off track. I think our guys under
stand that now. We can learn a
lot by being exposed to high
caliber wrestling like this."

3 wrestler in the nation in the

177 pound division. Buddie, how
ever, was able to avenge a loss to
Arizona State's G.T. Taylor in the
Ohio high school state champion
ships.
"I am encouraged by Steve's
performance," Horpel said. "He's
not far from being one of the best,
and I think he's beginning to
realize that."
Other wrestlers who turned in
good performances included
James Dinette at 142 pounds and
Josh Lisle at 126 pounds. Dinette
came back to beat Michigan's
James Feldkamp and nearly
placed before losing by one point.
