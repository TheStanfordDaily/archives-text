## Students learn about dance and themselves in 'Scramble' 
### Francis Quaratiello Editorial staff 
THE STANFORD DA/W'S WEEKLY

The best way to learn how to
do something is to do it.
This quarter, the Dance Divi
sion's Dance Heritage class is put
ting that principle into motion.
Adding a new dimension to the
dance history and technique class,
instructor Diane Frank is teaching
her students how to perform world
renowned choreographer Merce
Cunningham's "Scramble."
"Scramble" is a modern dance
made up of rigorously choreo
graphed sections that can be per
formed in parts or rearranged, ac
cording to Frank. The movements
of the dance allow the dancers to
explore the space around them and
their bodies.
Dance is the subject of the
dance, and like many other 20th
century artists, Cunningham
focuses the attention of his audi
ence on the art itself.
Frank explained that the best
way to understand Cunningham's
work is to dance it.
"Understanding manifests itself
in doing the dance, not in writing
a paper," according to Frank, who
trained at Cunningham's studio in
New York for 11 years and taught
there for eight years.
Frank said the performance
aspect of the class complements
the other elements of the class
well. It helps students to under
stand and feel "the continuity of
energy involved in the dance," she
said.
Frank chose to teach the stu
dents "Scramble" because she had
taught the dance before in Paris
and because, she said, "It is a good
first piece."
" 'Scramble' is arduous, but

fairly simple and direct," Frank ex
plained. "It has many phrases, but
the degree of activity depends upon
the dancers themselves."
For this reason, the dance is
well-suited for a class in which
students have varying levels of
ability and commitment, she said.

"The students get out of the
class what they put into it," she
explained.
Sairus Patel, a junior who is
taking the class, agreed.
"It is one of the most intense
dance courses offered," he said.
The 14 students in the class

have been putting in long hours,
reading a lot of background mate
rial, watching videos, practicing
and keeping dance journals.
The journals are a new idea, too.
"The journals are a reflective ac
tivity," Frank explained. "They
help the students to progress and
keep track of their thoughts."
The students turn in their jour
nals once a week to Frank, and
she gives the students feedback.
For Patel, the class revolves
around the journal entries.
"Diane [Frank) returns them
with observatory comments and
answers to questions, but no judg
ments on what we have written,"
he explained. "It's strange, because
I rarely talk with her. But, in the
journal, she reads some of my in
nermost thoughts. It is as if we
communicate through the journal.
"During the quarter, I have come
to realize how much dance is in
termixed with the rest of my life.
For instance, I am taking a
feminist studies class, and the is
sues of gender roles and body
image that I am learning about
there are causing me to re-examine
the way I think about dance. The
journal has helped me to explore
those thoughts/' Patel added.
That time of reflection comple
ments the dance, according to
Patel. He said "Scramble" engages
the mind of the dancer as well as
the minds of audience members
at all times.
" 'Scramble' is rhetorical dance,"
Frank said. "The subject of the
dance is dance itself."
Actually, class members only
learned about half of "Scramble."
But the dance can be performed
in parts or parts of the dance can
be rearranged without detracting
from the dance itself.

According to Frank, "Scramble,"
which was first performed in 1967,
has not been staged in its entirety
since then. But Cunningham and
his dance company frequently use
parts of "Scramble" in the 90-
minute "events," or dance se
quence medleys, which they per
form.
Cunningham's dances use in
determinate structures. They allow
dancers to explore the open field
of space around them. In addition,
they do not focus attention on par
ticular members of the dance
troupe.
To reinforce Cunningham's
belief in a non-hierarchical com
pany, every student in the class is
learning every part of "Scramble."
Any member of the class could be
called upon to perform any part of
the dance.
Patel said at first he was upset
because, unlike many other
modern dance classes, this class
offered no opportunity for him to
gain experience doing choreog
raphy. But Patel added that the
class has given him a new per
spective on dance.
"In some senses, choreography
is putting new meaning into a
piece," he explained. " 'Scramble'
uses the vocabulary of ballet in a
new, different way and it is chal
lenging to try to express yourself
within those new limits, with
those new tools."
Patel sat out of the class for two
weeks because he dislocated his
shoulder earlier in the quarter. He
said watching the dance gave him
a new appreciation for it.
" 'Scramble' is a plotless dance
that undermines your expecta
tions," he explained "For instance,
one of the things Diane em
phasizes is the importance of

standing still sometimes. When I
got out of my sling and started
dancing again, I gained a new ap
preciation for movements as
simple as standing up and stretch
ing out my arms."
Frank encourages the students
to "take the material and make it
their own with some degree of
clarity and amplitude.
"I want the students to learn
how to dance by themselves, to
hold onto a rhythm with or with
out a partner, with or without ac
companiment," she explained.
Patel agreed that the dance was
a challenge.
"As a dancer, your mind is heav
ily involved," he explained. "To
the audience, the movements may
seem random, but they are not.
All that means a lot of hard
work. This Friday, members of the
community can attend an open
rehearsal and see just what the
students have been working on.
The versatility of the dance and
of the students will surely come
across. The students will run
through the piece twice, with dif
ferent students dancing different
parts in each performance, and the
audience will even be asked to
move to a different part of the
studio between the two perform
ances so that they can get a new
perspective on the piece.
In addition, the dance students
will be performing to two scores
written by students in Gwendolyn
Watson's Chamber Music Im
provisation class. This mixture of
sight and sound is sure to be a
treat.

"Scramble" will be performed Fri
day at 4:30 p.m. in Roble Dance
Studio.

That time of reflection comple
ments the dance, according to
Patel. He said "Scramble" engages
the mind of the dancer as well as
the minds of audience members
at all times.
" 'Scramble' is rhetorical dance,"
Frank said. "The subject of the
dance is dance itself."
Actually, class members only
learned about half of "Scramble."
But the dance can be performed
in parts or parts of the dance can
be rearranged without detracting
from the dance itself.

According to Frank, "Scramble,"
which was first performed in 1967,
has not been staged in its entirety
since then. But Cunningham and
his dance company frequently use
parts of "Scramble" in the 90-
minute "events," or dance se
quence medleys, which they per
form.
Cunningham's dances use in
determinate structures. They allow
dancers to explore the open field
of space around them. In addition,
they do not focus attention on par
ticular members of the dance
troupe.
To reinforce Cunningham's
belief in a non-hierarchical com
pany, every student in the class is
learning every part of "Scramble."
Any member of the class could be
called upon to perform any part of
the dance.
Patel said at first he was upset
because, unlike many other
modern dance classes, this class
offered no opportunity for him to
gain experience doing choreog
raphy. But Patel added that the
class has given him a new per
spective on dance.
"In some senses, choreography
is putting new meaning into a
piece," he explained. " 'Scramble'
uses the vocabulary of ballet in a
new, different way and it is chal
lenging to try to express yourself
within those new limits, with
those new tools."
Patel sat out of the class for two
weeks because he dislocated his
shoulder earlier in the quarter. He
said watching the dance gave him
a new appreciation for it.
" 'Scramble' is a plotless dance
that undermines your expecta
tions," he explained "For instance,
one of the things Diane em
phasizes is the importance of

standing still sometimes. When I
got out of my sling and started
dancing again, I gained a new ap
preciation for movements as
simple as standing up and stretch
ing out my arms."
Frank encourages the students
to "take the material and make it
their own with some degree of
clarity and amplitude.
"I want the students to learn
how to dance by themselves, to
hold onto a rhythm with or with
out a partner, with or without ac
companiment," she explained.
Patel agreed that the dance was
a challenge.
"As a dancer, your mind is heav
ily involved," he explained. "To
the audience, the movements may
seem random, but they are not.
All that means a lot of hard
work. This Friday, members of the
community can attend an open
rehearsal and see just what the
students have been working on.
The versatility of the dance and
of the students will surely come
across. The students will run
through the piece twice, with dif
ferent students dancing different
parts in each performance, and the
audience will even be asked to
move to a different part of the
studio between the two perform
ances so that they can get a new
perspective on the piece.
In addition, the dance students
will be performing to two scores
written by students in Gwendolyn
Watson's Chamber Music Im
provisation class. This mixture of
sight and sound is sure to be a
treat.

"Scramble" will be performed Fri
day at 4:30 p.m. in Roble Dance
Studio.

preparation for the "fast dance" in Cunningham's "Scramble."


THE STANFORD DA/W'S WEEKLY

The best way to learn how to
do something is to do it.
This quarter, the Dance Divi
sion's Dance Heritage class is put
ting that principle into motion.
Adding a new dimension to the
dance history and technique class,
instructor Diane Frank is teaching
her students how to perform world
renowned choreographer Merce
Cunningham's "Scramble."
"Scramble" is a modern dance
made up of rigorously choreo
graphed sections that can be per
formed in parts or rearranged, ac
cording to Frank. The movements
of the dance allow the dancers to
explore the space around them and
their bodies.
Dance is the subject of the
dance, and like many other 20th
century artists, Cunningham
focuses the attention of his audi
ence on the art itself.
Frank explained that the best
way to understand Cunningham's
work is to dance it.
"Understanding manifests itself
in doing the dance, not in writing
a paper," according to Frank, who
trained at Cunningham's studio in
New York for 11 years and taught
there for eight years.
Frank said the performance
aspect of the class complements
the other elements of the class
well. It helps students to under
stand and feel "the continuity of
energy involved in the dance," she
said.
Frank chose to teach the stu
dents "Scramble" because she had
taught the dance before in Paris
and because, she said, "It is a good
first piece."
" 'Scramble' is arduous, but

fairly simple and direct," Frank ex
plained. "It has many phrases, but
the degree of activity depends upon
the dancers themselves."
For this reason, the dance is
well-suited for a class in which
students have varying levels of
ability and commitment, she said.

"The students get out of the
class what they put into it," she
explained.
Sairus Patel, a junior who is
taking the class, agreed.
"It is one of the most intense
dance courses offered," he said.
The 14 students in the class

have been putting in long hours,
reading a lot of background mate
rial, watching videos, practicing
and keeping dance journals.
The journals are a new idea, too.
"The journals are a reflective ac
tivity," Frank explained. "They
help the students to progress and
keep track of their thoughts."
The students turn in their jour
nals once a week to Frank, and
she gives the students feedback.
For Patel, the class revolves
around the journal entries.
"Diane [Frank) returns them
with observatory comments and
answers to questions, but no judg
ments on what we have written,"
he explained. "It's strange, because
I rarely talk with her. But, in the
journal, she reads some of my in
nermost thoughts. It is as if we
communicate through the journal.
"During the quarter, I have come
to realize how much dance is in
termixed with the rest of my life.
For instance, I am taking a
feminist studies class, and the is
sues of gender roles and body
image that I am learning about
there are causing me to re-examine
the way I think about dance. The
journal has helped me to explore
those thoughts/' Patel added.
