# Elvis, wide ties and the '80s may be dead, but Dan Quayle isn't
## 
### 
The '80s arc dead, long live the '80s.
What a fun decade it's been. No, sci
entists didn't find that elusive cure for
cancer — though if they had they could
have sold it on the Home Shopping Net
work for $49.95 (plus tax where applica
ble).
New, innovative technologies were ev
erywhere. VCRs, Sony Walkmen and per
sonal computers made home life more
convenient and more flexible. Facsimile
machines allowed office workers to send
photocopies of their buttocks all over the
country, instantly.
And Elvis is still dead.
The military gave us the "Stealth" bomb
er, or so they claim. Like the Emperor's
new clothes, I'm not so sure there isn't
some guy working in Appropriations who
just says there arc 50 or 60 of 'em flying
over the Soviet Union.
This was the decade that many of us
will remember with great fondness for the
rest of our lives. Sure, it doesn't seem so
great right now. Maybe now you still re
member the time your date wore a silk
genie costume to the high school formal.
(I'm not making this up. My friend Bren
dan's date wore a genie costume to the
prom. He's still in therapy.) But mark my
words, you'll look back on this someday
as the decade in which you Came of Age
Hollywood in the '80s looked quite

fondly upon Coming of Age: "Diner,"
"Happy Days," "Porky's," "Stand By Me."
Come to think of it, the movies and tele
vision of the '80s looked upon Coming of
Age as something that happened exclu
sively in the 19505. Didn't anybody come
of age in the '60s or '70s? Knowing those
decades, probably not.
The '60s was not a good time to come
of age, what with Vietnam and Jimi
Hendrix and all that. Some of our young
men, who didn't want to fight, went to
Canada to avoid the draft altogether. In
return, Canada sent us their hockey
players, who did want to fight. Most of
the people who came of age in the '60s
took so many drugs that they don't re
member coming of age at all.
Nobody came of arc in the 70s. At
least, nobody who will admit to it. You
and I were in elementary school then, so
we didn't have to dress ourselves. We have
an excuse. The rest of the citizenry wore
a style of clothing that can best be de
scribed as "wide." Wide tics, wide collars,
wide hair. No one wore shirts or pants
during the '70s, just a big collar extending
down the back and a tie the size of Elvis
Presley Icirca 1977) down the front.
So when Hollywood finally finishes
making their witty little Coming of Age
films about the '50s it'll be our turn. The
'80s turn. I think we'll look back fondly

on what wc have wrought this dccade. As
a humorist, I couldn't be more pleased.
On the political front wc had Ronald
Reagan, the funniest President since
Jimmy Carter, who in turn was the fun
niest President since Gerald Ford. As it
turns out Carter actually ends up having
spent more days in office during the '80s
than George Bush. Forty-one days longer,
to be exact. He was funnier in those 41
days, too. When Carter used to give live
speeches to the nation on TV, folks used
to gather round their television sets to see
whether he could get through the speech
without having a member of his staff or
family taken hostage by an Iranian Billy
Beer-drinking killer rabbit.
It's not that the Democrats didn't mean
well in the '80s, it's just that they tried
to ascend to the Presidency by using the
Vice-President as their main candidate. In
1984 the Democrats' secret vice
presidential weapon was a woman; in 1988
it was Dan Quayle. Neither launched the
Democrats into power, though Quayle
turned out to be a godsend for humor
writers nationwide.
Dan Quayle, it should be noted, Came
of Age in the '60s.
Sex underwent a revolution of sorts in
the '80s, as well. Condoms, like yuppies,
became a sort of unpleasant reality of life.
If the '60s was the decade of Free Love,

and the '70s the dccade of You-Expcct-
Mc-To-Go-To-Bed-With-Somcone-
Who's-Wearing-A-Tie-The-Width-
Of-A Halibut Lovr, the '80s was the dec
ade of cautious love. Soothsayers said this
caution would bring back that good old
time religion, and it did, on several net
works, until the religion was caught having
a good old time in a motel room with a
founding member of the church of Our
Lady of the Evening
Over in Europe times arc a-changin',
too. It wasn't but the beginning of this
dccade that the Soviet Union was the Evil
Empire, the Cold War was at its coldest
and places like Czechoslovakia were

stumpers on the seventh grade spelling
bee.
Now the East Germans have opened
the Berlin Wall in hope that its citizenry
will stay put in the East Maybe that's
why New Yorkers stay put in New York.
New York City's about the nastiest place
to live on the planet, but since its citizens
arc free to come and go as they please,
New Yorkers continue to reside there year
after year. (Those who participated in the
sit-in in President Kennedy's officc last
year should seriously consider a move to
New York. After all, shooting people on
the subways there is not against the law
if you BELIEVE what you arc doing is
right )
What do the 1990s bring that we should
look forward to? As always, predictions
will most likely hit far astray from the
reality of the decade to come But one
thing is for certain Since the 19305, every
sitting Vice-President has gone on to seek
his party's nomination for President in a
future election.
Dan Quayle for President in 1996? As
a voter, I cringe at the thought As a
humor writer, I'm starting a grass roots
campaign this very minute.
Happy New Year.

The '80s arc dead, long live the '80s.
What a fun decade it's been. No, sci
entists didn't find that elusive cure for
cancer — though if they had they could
have sold it on the Home Shopping Net
work for $49.95 (plus tax where applica
ble).
New, innovative technologies were ev
erywhere. VCRs, Sony Walkmen and per
sonal computers made home life more
convenient and more flexible. Facsimile
machines allowed office workers to send
photocopies of their buttocks all over the
country, instantly.
And Elvis is still dead.
The military gave us the "Stealth" bomb
er, or so they claim. Like the Emperor's
new clothes, I'm not so sure there isn't
some guy working in Appropriations who
just says there arc 50 or 60 of 'em flying
over the Soviet Union.
This was the decade that many of us
will remember with great fondness for the
rest of our lives. Sure, it doesn't seem so
great right now. Maybe now you still re
member the time your date wore a silk
genie costume to the high school formal.
(I'm not making this up. My friend Bren
dan's date wore a genie costume to the
prom. He's still in therapy.) But mark my
words, you'll look back on this someday
as the decade in which you Came of Age
Hollywood in the '80s looked quite

fondly upon Coming of Age: "Diner,"
"Happy Days," "Porky's," "Stand By Me."
Come to think of it, the movies and tele
vision of the '80s looked upon Coming of
Age as something that happened exclu
sively in the 19505. Didn't anybody come
of age in the '60s or '70s? Knowing those
decades, probably not.
The '60s was not a good time to come
of age, what with Vietnam and Jimi
Hendrix and all that. Some of our young
men, who didn't want to fight, went to
Canada to avoid the draft altogether. In
return, Canada sent us their hockey
players, who did want to fight. Most of
the people who came of age in the '60s
took so many drugs that they don't re
member coming of age at all.
Nobody came of arc in the 70s. At
least, nobody who will admit to it. You
and I were in elementary school then, so
we didn't have to dress ourselves. We have
an excuse. The rest of the citizenry wore
a style of clothing that can best be de
scribed as "wide." Wide tics, wide collars,
wide hair. No one wore shirts or pants
during the '70s, just a big collar extending
down the back and a tie the size of Elvis
Presley Icirca 1977) down the front.
So when Hollywood finally finishes
making their witty little Coming of Age
films about the '50s it'll be our turn. The
'80s turn. I think we'll look back fondly

on what wc have wrought this dccade. As
a humorist, I couldn't be more pleased.
On the political front wc had Ronald
Reagan, the funniest President since
Jimmy Carter, who in turn was the fun
niest President since Gerald Ford. As it
turns out Carter actually ends up having
spent more days in office during the '80s
than George Bush. Forty-one days longer,
to be exact. He was funnier in those 41
days, too. When Carter used to give live
speeches to the nation on TV, folks used
to gather round their television sets to see
whether he could get through the speech
without having a member of his staff or
family taken hostage by an Iranian Billy
Beer-drinking killer rabbit.
It's not that the Democrats didn't mean
well in the '80s, it's just that they tried
to ascend to the Presidency by using the
Vice-President as their main candidate. In
1984 the Democrats' secret vice
presidential weapon was a woman; in 1988
it was Dan Quayle. Neither launched the
Democrats into power, though Quayle
turned out to be a godsend for humor
writers nationwide.
Dan Quayle, it should be noted, Came
of Age in the '60s.
Sex underwent a revolution of sorts in
the '80s, as well. Condoms, like yuppies,
became a sort of unpleasant reality of life.
If the '60s was the decade of Free Love,

and the '70s the dccade of You-Expcct-
Mc-To-Go-To-Bed-With-Somcone-
Who's-Wearing-A-Tie-The-Width-
Of-A Halibut Lovr, the '80s was the dec
ade of cautious love. Soothsayers said this
caution would bring back that good old
time religion, and it did, on several net
works, until the religion was caught having
a good old time in a motel room with a
founding member of the church of Our
Lady of the Evening
Over in Europe times arc a-changin',
too. It wasn't but the beginning of this
dccade that the Soviet Union was the Evil
Empire, the Cold War was at its coldest
and places like Czechoslovakia were

stumpers on the seventh grade spelling
bee.
Now the East Germans have opened
the Berlin Wall in hope that its citizenry
will stay put in the East Maybe that's
why New Yorkers stay put in New York.
New York City's about the nastiest place
to live on the planet, but since its citizens
arc free to come and go as they please,
New Yorkers continue to reside there year
after year. (Those who participated in the
sit-in in President Kennedy's officc last
year should seriously consider a move to
New York. After all, shooting people on
the subways there is not against the law
