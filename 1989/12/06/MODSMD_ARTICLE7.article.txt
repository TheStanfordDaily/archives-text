A claim to a Stanford doc
torate by one of the top ad
visers to Mexico's president has
thrust the Stanford Economics
Department into the midst of
an international dispute over
credentials.
Jos6 Maria C6rdoba Mon
toya, a principal economic ad
viser to Mexican President
Carlos Salinas, claimed in his
resume to have a doctorate in
economics from Stanford, ac
cording to an article in the San
Jos6 Mercury News.
The resume was printed in
Mexico's 1987 Biographic Dic
tionary of Federal Govern
ment. In October, the Mexican
magazine Proceso printed the
news that C6rdoba did not, in
fact, have the doctorate.
According to Economics
Prof. Mordecai Kurz, who was
Cordoba *8 adviser at Stanford
from 1974 to 1977, Cordoba
did present a dissertation to the
faculty, who approved it. But,
Kurz said, he never formally
typed and submitted the paper
in the correct format. Cordoba

Cbrdoba never for
mally submitted his
dissertation.

also neglected to pay the nec
essary fees, and therefore did
not receive his doctorate.
"Don't ask me why" Cdrdooa
failed to properly submit his
dissertation, Kurz said. He
added that C6rdoba left Stan- &
ford for another university, and
then "disappeared.**
Kurz expressed surprise at
the publicity that C6rdoba is
receiving. He said that C6rdoba
was "very withdrawn ... the
last person I would have ex
pected to be involved in
politics."
He added that there are
"substantial cultural differ
ences'* between Mexico and the
United States and that Amer
icans "should not be passing
judgment" on Cordoba.
Gavin Wright, ch*ir of the
Economics Department, and
Elizabeth Traugott, dean of
graduate studies, could not be
reached for comment.
