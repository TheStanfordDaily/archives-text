# You'll be 'Miserable' if you miss this show
## 
### Damian Marhefka Editorial staff 
After hearing raves about "Les
Miserables," the musical sensa
tion, I vowed to go into the show
with a hyper-critical eye. Soon into
the evening, however, I realized
that to look for major flaws would
be a futile task.
From the opening curtain to the
final bow, "Les Miserables" proved
to be an extraordinary display of
musical talent, acting perfection
and technical wonders that all
worked to support a magnificently
written script.
The story revolves around the
characters of Jean Valjean, a con
vict imprisoned for stealing a loaf
of bread, and Javert, a militant
policeman whose quest is to
punish the scum of society.
Valjean is released from the
chain-gang and put on parole only
to find that he is an outcast be
cause of his criminal record. The
Bishop of Digne takes Valjean into
his home to feed him, but Valjean
cannot resist the urge to steal the
Bishop's silver cups.
When caught by the police, the
Bishop lies to protect his charge,
claiming that he gave Valjean the
silver cups as a gift. Once the police
leave, the Bishop tells Valjean to
go and to live his life doing good
and serving God. Valjean then
breaks his parole to start a new
life with a new identity.
From this point on, the musical
focuses on Valjean's life-long serv
ice to God by helping others and

on Javert's life-long quest to bring
Valjean to justice. There are many
other themes in the show as well.
The idealism of the students in
Paris lead them to start a revolu
tion, and there are sub-plots of
love, rejection, new beginnings and
death.
"Les Miserables'" power stems
from its ability to bring the audi
ence into the minds of the char
acters and its ability to make the
audience feel the strong emotions

present throughout the show. Even
though the U.S in the '80s is far
removed from 19th-century
France, the musical enables a
modern audience to understand
the atmosphere of the time and
relate to the characters who were
there.
Rich Hebert and Richard Kinsey
as Jean Valjean and lavert gave
exceptional performances. Their
characters were bold and believable
and wonderfully portrayed. The

technical marvels of the show were
equally impressive and must be
seen to be believed.
Don't allow this show to leave
San Francisco without experienc
ing it for yourself. Even if you
vowed never to see another musi
cal after your high school did "Ok
lahoma," you must go see "Les
Miserables."
