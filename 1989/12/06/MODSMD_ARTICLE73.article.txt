# Dip into Andre's for Swiss tradition
## 
### Marnie Rager 
It's time to dip back into an
old tradition. Fondue — the
traditional, social Swiss concoc
tion — has become popular once
again.
And the only place you can
get it around here is Andre's
Confiserie Suisse, a quaint and
cozy chalet-like restaurant in
Menlo Park.
A combination of wine and
cheese melted together in a pot
over a flame, fondue originated
centuries ago in Switzerland.
Small pieces of bread are
skewered by utensil that resem
bles a long, skinny fork and then
dipped into the hot fondue.
It is interesting to note that
fondue became a common part
of the Swiss diet because both
cheese and wine are ingredients
that could be easily preserved.
More than being just a practical
alternative, it has now become
a fun tradition.
Andre's owner and chef is
Ernst Wiedmer, who, like all
chefs, takes takes pride in his
creative concoctions.
He prepares his fondue with
two cheeses, gruyere and em
mentaler. White wine and
kirsche, a cherry liqueur, are
added to the cheeses carefully.

The delicious combination is
seasoned with pepper, nutmeg
and garlic.
Andre's fondue is a bit differ
ent from what I've eaten in the
past. It was not as thick, and
I found I rather liked the thinner
consistency, as it was less fill
ing.
If you enjoy fondue you'll
probably try Andre's sooner or
later because it is the only res
taurant that serves it in this
area.
There are some traditional
rules you must play by, how
ever. If someone in your party
drops a piece of bread into the
fondue there are two rules to
follow, depending on the gender
of the offender. A woman must
kiss everyone at the table, and
a man must buy another bottle
of wine.
Along with the fondue, salad
and dessert are included to
round out the package. If you
haven't tried fondue, you
should. Because it is only served
on Thursdays and Fridays from
6 to 9 p.m., plan in advance
and make reservations.

Andre's Suisse Confiserie is lo
cated at 898 Santa Cruz Ave.
in Menlo Park. For reservations,
call 325-4776.
