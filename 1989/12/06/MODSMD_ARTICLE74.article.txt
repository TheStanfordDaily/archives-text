# Vaughan 'In Step, invincible, incredible
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Stevie Ray Vaughan played guitar
standing up, crouching down, be
hind his back and on the floor.
Wherever he played it, he and
Double Trouble jammed solidly
Sunday night.
Singing before a sold-out Oak
land Coliseum audience for two
guitar-banging, mind-blowing
hours, Vaughan belted out a
healthy core of his older material
punctuated with gut-wrenching
new hits like "Crossfire" and
"Tightrope" off his new album "In
Step."
Guitar master Jeff Beck opened
with a slamming one-hour set. Un
shackled from playing cheesy love
songs as lead guitarist for Rod
Stewart, Beck sizzled with string
plucking virtuosity, blending one
ear-piercing instrumental into the
next.
Beck's drummer, Terry Bozzio,
nearly stole the show in his solo.
For nearly three minutes, Bozzio
melted into an imbroglio of fling
ing white arms and flowing blonde
hair.
Backed by the flawless sounds

of Double Trouble — bassist
Tommy Shannon, keyboardist
Reese Wynans and drummer Chris
Layton — Vaughan dug deeply into
his vast repertoire of scorching
hard blues- Southern rock, flinging
off the likes of "Mary Had a Little
Lamb," "Superstition" and "Cold
Shot" with tJie precision and vigor
that he has come to be known for.
To a rousing cheer from the
crowd, in the middle of "Texas
Flood" Vaughan twirled his guitar
180 degrees and finished off the
song picking the notes behind of
his back.
The show smoked through
several more of his core tunes, and
in his first of three encores
Vaughan awed the crowd with his
skull-rattling renditions of fimi
Hendrix's "Voodoo Child (A Slight
Return)" and "Third Stone from
the Sun." The encore saw him lay
his guitar on the stage and play it
in a crouched, praying position,
reminiscent of Hendrix's Monterey
debut.
Vaughan closed the spectacular
show with a massive instrumental
that easily summarized his ac
complishments to date.
