# A 						handful stands out from mediocre field
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
Musically, 1989 was like
every other year this decade —
some definite standouts but not
much consistency. We heard
more and more radio stations
relying on classic rock formats
to attract listeners. And while
many of the old time rockers
returned to the studio, nothing
earth-shattering seemed to
result.
The following five albums
came closest to shaking us out
of the mediocrity mode and
sending the music scene back
in the right direction. (To
qualify for the list, the album
had to be a non-compilation
commercial release that entered
the stores after January 1, 1989.)
1. Lou Reed — "New York"
(Sire)
"New York" has to be con
sidered Lou Reed's best work

since his Andy Warhol
produced days in the Velvet Un
derground. Between the lyrics
and the music you walk away
from this album affected.
Reed sounds angrier than ever
with his hometown. Songs like
"Dirty Blvd." depict the troubled
streets of N.Y. with lines like,
"It's hard to run when a coat
hanger beats you on the thighs."
Everything from crack abuse
to back alley abortions to AIDS
are covered on this 58-minute
album. Regardless of his Amer
ican Express ads, Reed confirms
his title as the toughest street
poet around. Just think about
this line, "Give me your tired,
your poor; I'll piss on them/
That's what the Statue of
Bigotry says."
The music highlights the
lyrics by quietly thumping along
in the background, never over
whelming the lyrics. This al
bum stands out not just as the
best of '89 but as a possible con
tender for the top honors for the
decade.
2. Peter Case — "The Man with
the Blue Post-modern Frag
mented Neo-traditionalist
Guitar" (Geffen)
You're thinking who is this guy
and what type of album title is
that?
The answers are simple. Case,

the ex-lead singer of the Plimsouls,
emerged as a solo artist in 1986
and since then has earned the right
to be considered the new Bob
Dylan.
Not since Dylan's mid-'7os
work has an artist been able to
tell a story the way Case does.
Playing mostly acoustic guitar, and
surrounding himself with a strong
supporting cast featuring T-Bone
Burnett and members from the
Heartbreaks and Los Lobos, Case
uses a modern folk sound to dis
cuss things like loneliness, love
and small towns.
Themes weave themselves effec

tively into engaging stories about
everyday characters. One listen to
either "Put Down the Gun" or "En
tella's Hotel," will make Case's
brilliance obvious. As far as the
album title my only guess is that,
after the N.Y. Times named his
1986 self-titled debut the best al
bum of the year, and still no one
heard of him, Case felt a need for
a more original name.
3. Tom Petty — "Full Moon Fever
(MCA)
All skepticism about Petty aban
doning the Heartbreakers for a solo
effort should be quickly dispelled

after a handful of listens to "Full
Moon Fever."
While the album often lacks the
obvious hooks that Petty used to
get with his band, the solo release
is much more subtle and grows
on you. Songs like "Free Fallin'"
and"I Won't Back Down" may
shock the purist, but understand
that Petty embarked on this ad
venture to do songs that were out
of the ordinary.
4. Indigo Girls — Indigo Girls
(Epic)
Any top five list from this past
year that does not include the In

digo Girls just can't be taken
seriously. This duo's combination
of moving harmonies by Amy Ray
and Emily Saliers with good 'ol
strumming acoustic guitars,
makes you forget Tracy Chapman.
With songs ranging from the
catchy hit "Closer to Fine" to "Kid
Fears," featuring the haunting
background vocals of fellow Geor
gian Michael Stipe, this album has
to be considered one of the finest
debuts in years.
5. Elvis Costello — "Spike"
(Warner Brothers)
After listening to this collection

of Elvis Costello's most recent ma
terial, it becomes very clear why
he has always been a critic's fa
vorite.
Few lyricists can equal his mas
tery over words, while only the
likes of Prince can compete with
his versatility. "Spike" features
chilling political attacks as heard
in "Tramp the Dirt Down" or rock
'n' roll odes to such subjects as
an aging grandmother.
Although not as strong as his
1986 "King of America," this al
bum demonstrates the maturity of
an artist who consistently puts to
gether songs that grab our ears.

Heartbreaks and Los Lobos, Case
uses a modern folk sound to dis
cuss things like loneliness, love
and small towns.
Themes weave themselves effec

tively into engaging stories about
everyday characters. One listen to
either "Put Down the Gun" or "En
tella's Hotel," will make Case's
brilliance obvious. As far as the
album title my only guess is that,
after the N.Y. Times named his
1986 self-titled debut the best al
bum of the year, and still no one
heard of him, Case felt a need for
a more original name.
3. Tom Petty — "Full Moon Fever
(MCA)
All skepticism about Petty aban
doning the Heartbreakers for a solo
effort should be quickly dispelled

after a handful of listens to "Full
Moon Fever."
While the album often lacks the
obvious hooks that Petty used to
get with his band, the solo release
is much more subtle and grows
on you. Songs like "Free Fallin'"
and"I Won't Back Down" may
shock the purist, but understand
that Petty embarked on this ad
venture to do songs that were out
of the ordinary.
4. Indigo Girls — Indigo Girls
(Epic)
Any top five list from this past
year that does not include the In

digo Girls just can't be taken
seriously. This duo's combination
of moving harmonies by Amy Ray
and Emily Saliers with good 'ol
strumming acoustic guitars,
makes you forget Tracy Chapman.
With songs ranging from the
catchy hit "Closer to Fine" to "Kid
Fears," featuring the haunting
background vocals of fellow Geor
gian Michael Stipe, this album has
to be considered one of the finest
debuts in years.
5. Elvis Costello — "Spike"
(Warner Brothers)
After listening to this collection

of Elvis Costello's most recent ma
terial, it becomes very clear why
he has always been a critic's fa
vorite.
Few lyricists can equal his mas
tery over words, while only the
likes of Prince can compete with
his versatility. "Spike" features
chilling political attacks as heard
in "Tramp the Dirt Down" or rock
'n' roll odes to such subjects as
an aging grandmother.
Although not as strong as his
1986 "King of America," this al
bum demonstrates the maturity of
an artist who consistently puts to
gether songs that grab our ears.
Musically, 1989 was like
every other year this decade —
some definite standouts but not
much consistency. We heard
more and more radio stations
relying on classic rock formats
to attract listeners. And while
many of the old time rockers
returned to the studio, nothing
earth-shattering seemed to
result.
The following five albums
came closest to shaking us out
of the mediocrity mode and
sending the music scene back
in the right direction. (To
qualify for the list, the album
had to be a non-compilation
commercial release that entered
the stores after January 1, 1989.)
1. Lou Reed — "New York"
(Sire)
"New York" has to be con
sidered Lou Reed's best work

since his Andy Warhol
produced days in the Velvet Un
derground. Between the lyrics
and the music you walk away
from this album affected.
Reed sounds angrier than ever
with his hometown. Songs like
"Dirty Blvd." depict the troubled
streets of N.Y. with lines like,
"It's hard to run when a coat
hanger beats you on the thighs."
Everything from crack abuse
to back alley abortions to AIDS
are covered on this 58-minute
album. Regardless of his Amer
ican Express ads, Reed confirms
his title as the toughest street
poet around. Just think about
this line, "Give me your tired,
your poor; I'll piss on them/
That's what the Statue of
Bigotry says."
The music highlights the
lyrics by quietly thumping along
in the background, never over
whelming the lyrics. This al
bum stands out not just as the
best of '89 but as a possible con
tender for the top honors for the
decade.
2. Peter Case — "The Man with
the Blue Post-modern Frag
mented Neo-traditionalist
Guitar" (Geffen)
You're thinking who is this guy
and what type of album title is
that?
The answers are simple. Case,

the ex-lead singer of the Plimsouls,
emerged as a solo artist in 1986
and since then has earned the right
to be considered the new Bob
Dylan.
Not since Dylan's mid-'7os
work has an artist been able to
tell a story the way Case does.
Playing mostly acoustic guitar, and
surrounding himself with a strong
supporting cast featuring T-Bone
Burnett and members from the
Heartbreaks and Los Lobos, Case
uses a modern folk sound to dis
cuss things like loneliness, love
and small towns.
Themes weave themselves effec

tively into engaging stories about
everyday characters. One listen to
either "Put Down the Gun" or "En
tella's Hotel," will make Case's
brilliance obvious. As far as the
album title my only guess is that,
after the N.Y. Times named his
1986 self-titled debut the best al
bum of the year, and still no one
