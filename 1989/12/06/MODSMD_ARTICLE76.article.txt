# Despite hype, new Furs won't keep you warm this Christmas
##

The Psychedelic Furs almost did
it.
With the moderate success of
their last album, "Midnight to
Midnight," and the dance hits
"Heartbreak Beat" and "Angels
Don't Cry," the band appeared on
the verge of breaking out of their
underground status. And after CBS

Records heavily-hyped their latest
album as a "return to form for the
Psychedelic Furs," "Book of Days"
was expected to be the
breakthrough album for the cult
group.
CBS Records couldn't be farther
from the truth. Within the 10
chapters of "Book of Days" lies all
the excitement of a congressional
record. Even without all of the hype
and expectations, the album is no

more than a droning, monotonous
compilation of directionless songs.
Part of the blame falls on Rich
ard Butler, tlie lead singer of the
Psychedelic Furs. His raspy,
grating voice reflects a markedly
limited range.
Additionally, because his vocal
style is so distinctive, many of the
songs sound similar. In the title
track, for example, his annoyingly
rough vocals are compounded by

the lack of lyrical meter or rhyme.
The result is a droning vocal track
that wanders aimlessly throughout
the entire song.
Musically, though, John Ash
ton's guitars don't seem to give
Butler's vocals any help. Through
out the album, the guitar's reverb
is so overwhelming that all of the
notes blend together into a con
tinual monotony.
The guitars and vocals are both

so burdensome that comparing the
two is like evaluating the lesser of
two evils.
The album does contain scat
tered bright spots. "Should God
Forget," a pessimistic view of one's
personal world, utilizes a quick,
strong bass line to carry the song.
"Mother â€” Son" is also a fast,
danceable song, whose guitars give
the spiraling effect of vertigo. And
in "Torch," the Furs use acoustic
guitars to accompany Butler's vo
cals, which fare surprisingly well
in the slow ballad.
Flowever, the album's other
tracks share a common sound

which regresses from redundantly
boring to strikingly annoying. In
many of the songs, like "Shine"
and "Parade," the Furs remain
stuck in a minor key for the song's
duration. Vocals, guitars, bass and
drums all seem to follow their own
path.
In "House," when Butler ex
claims, "We'll shake this house!",
one has to laugh not only because
the lyrics are cliche-ridden, but
also because his claim is so im
plausible.
For the Psychedelic Furs' sake,
one can only hope that CBS
Records was mistaken in its claim.
