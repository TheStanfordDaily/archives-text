## Santa celebrates helliday spirit 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
If you're looking for a Christmas
movie that dares to be different,
I've got one for you.
How about a movie that wonders
what Christmas would be like if
Santa Claus was an axe-wielding
type of guy? Well, if you're at all
interested in seeing a classic
Christmas movie that takes the
holiday spirit a different direction
from benign classics such as
"Miracle On 34th Street" and "It's
A Wonderful Life," by all means
rent "Silent Night, Deadly Night."
I especially recommend this one
for any of you who might want to
show a Christmas film to children
under five. This cinematic master
piece will give the kiddies a whole

new outlook on jolly ol' St. Nick.
Ho, ho, ho.
"Silent Night, Deadly Night"
opens with a visit to Grandpa at
a Utah mental facility by young
Billy and his family. Loony
Grandpa gives Billy some insight
â€” Santa Claus is a psychotic, so
cial deviant who punishes small
children in an effort to overcome
the emotional pain of his enslave
ment to shopping malls and toy
stores.
On the way home a tragic event
occurs. A man dressed as Santa
Claus kills Billy's parents. The
movie then shifts forward four
years to St. Mary's Orphanage,
where Billy gets the impetus tor
his future life as a psycho-santa.
redruM, redruM.
Fate's cruelty takes Billy to a
toy store during the Christmas

season, where he is employed as
the store's Santa Claus. The suit
dredges up so many painful mem
ories that all he can do is twitch
spasmodically.
By the time Christmas Eve rolls
around, Billy can't take it any
more, in a scene that rivals the
baby carriage on the steps in
Eisenstein's "The Battleship
Potempkin/' Billy decapitates a
sledder. The body and the sled con
tinue unimpeded down the hill,
with the head rolling along right
behind.
Once the local police realize they
have a psycho St. Nick on their
hands, it becomes open season on
Santa.
Never letting up on the viewer,
"Silent Night, Deadly Night"
rushes toward a moving and
thought-provoking climax that's
too good to give away.
