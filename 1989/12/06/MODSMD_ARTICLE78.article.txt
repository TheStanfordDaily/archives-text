# 'Lampoon's' trips up
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
If nothing else, this third install
ment in the National Lampoon's
"Vacation" series puts them only
five behind the "Friday the 13th"
series. It won't be long before
"Vacation VIII: The Griswolds
Take Manhattan."
As it is, the Griswolds don't take
anything in "National Lampoon's
Christmas Vacation" — except,
perhaps, your money. This time
they stay home on their vacation,
and the results, while mildly amus
ing, are not up to the laugh-a
minute standards set by "Vacation"
or "European Vacation."
Chevy Chase and Beverly
D'Angelo reprise their roles as
Clark and Ellen Griswold, the fun
loving parents of the oft
vacationing Griswold clan. The

Griswold kids are played by two
new actors, though it's hardly a
surprise.
So this time, instead of taking
their annual vacation on the road,
the Griswolds decide to invite their
relatives to come visit for Christ
mas. For a family as goofy as the
Griswolds, they have a remarkably
boring set of relatives.
The bonng relatives do come,
though, and they crack a few pre
dictable jokes and act their way
through yet another fluffy John
Hughes script.
"Christmas Vacation" seems like
a movie they thought up about
three months ago and had to have
finished by Christmas. Conceptu
ally, putting the Griswolds back
on the silver screen was not all
that bad an idea. But leaving the
family at home was less than
thrilling.
