WINTER QUARTER
"HIGH TECH" COURSE
Professor Textor has changed his schedule and will offer "Sociocultural
Implications of High Technology" (Anth. 138,238/VTSS 159) Winter Quar
ter, 3-5 units, Tu & Th, 3:15-5:05, Room 111J, Building 110. Open to
grads, seniors, and juniors; no pre-reqs. Satisfies following requirements:
DRS; Cluster A or C for 1R majors; VTSS for Engineers.
Lecture-discussion explorations of the development, diffusion, and utiliza
tion of technology -- especially "high" technology such as developed in and
around Stanford, e.g. biogenetics, microelectronic information technology,
and superconductors. Guest lectures on "how it is" by local technologists,
venture capitalists, and political activists.
Course examines ways in which technological innovations can enable or
drive profound changes in other parts of a sociocultural system (e.g. sym
bolic, value, and belief patterns; social and economic organization); surveys
types of unintended human damage such innovations can produce; and
weighs various implications for appropriate technological design and for
public and educational policy. Looks at non-Western cultures at various ev
olutionary levels of sociotechnical complexity, and at instructor's own field
experience in Japan, Thailand, and Austria.
