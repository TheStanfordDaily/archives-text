Serving the Stanford Community
You've had your checking account
for at least a month now. And if
it's not with Stanford Federal
Credit Union, you might be tired
of it already. Tired of fees ... tired
of low or no interest... tired of
so-so service ...
If this is you: Drop your account
and Add the financial institution
which has been owned & operated
by the Stanford community for
thirty years.
YES! I would like to know
more about the Stanford Federal
Credit Union's checking account
and other services.
Please send me your ADD/DROP
Form.
