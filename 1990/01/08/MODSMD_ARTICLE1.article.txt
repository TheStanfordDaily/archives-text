# Mosher drops last of charges
## Stanford cleared by 'abandonment' of 1986 suit 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Steven Mosher, expelled in 1983
from Stanford's doctoral program
in anthropology for alleged uneth
ical counduct while conducting re
search in China, has dropped the
last of the legal charges he
brought against the University re
garding his dismissal.
Mosher sued the University in
1986 on eight counts, seven of
which were dropped by the state
superior court. Mosher recently
dropped the remaining count of
defamation after claiming that he
had discarded a key piece of
evidence.
He will receive neither his doc
torate nor any monetary compen
sation from Stanford. In addition
to abandoning the suit, Mosher

has agreed to turn over to the
University all documents and
photos of documents he collected
while doing research in China. He
will have exclusive use of these
documents for one year before
releasing them to the University.
David Heilbron of McCulchen,
Doyle, Brown and Enerson in San
Francisco, who represented Stan
ford in the case, said Mosher's
"complete abandonment of the
lawsuit for no payment — not a
single dime — speaks for itself on
the merits of his claims."
Neither Mosher nor his attor
ney was available for comment
last night. Heilbron discussed the
case with Stanford News Service
and provided details of the dis
pute's history.
In 1979, Mosher became one of
the first American students per

mitted to conduct extensive field
research in China. While enrolled
in Stanford's graduate anthropol
ogy program, Mosher spent nine
months observing the lifestyle on
a rural Chinese commune.
Mosher's doctoral candidacy
was terminated in 1983 by unan
imous vote of the Anthropology
Department faculty. The decision
to dismiss Mosher followed an ex
tensive investigation by an ad hoc
University committee and was
based on the conclusion that
Mosher had engaged in "illegal
and seriously unethical conduct"
that "seriously endangered his re
search subjects."
The findings of the committee
were contained in a 47-page
report, a copy of which was given
to Mosher. According to the fac
ulty, the report demonstrated his
unethical behavior using "per
suasive evidence that cannot be
revealed without endangering in
nocent persons." For this reason,
the report has never been made
public by the University or Mosh
er.
Mosher, while providing only a
blanket denial for the items con
tained in the report, still claimed
that the University's motives be
hind his dismissal were based on
"slanderous" allegations by his ex
wife, Maggie So, and pressure
from the Chinese government,
which objected to an article
Mosher published dealing with
forced abortions he witnessed
while in China.
Although Mosher was accused
of various offenses by the Chinese
government, the most controver
sial of his actions concerned an
article published by Mosher in the
popular Taiwan newspaper, Chi
nese Weekly.
The article, which dealt with
birth control practices in China,
described infanticide and forced
abortions as late as eight and nine
months into pregnancy. The arti
cle included identifiable photo
graphs of women about to
undergo abortions.
Although the anthropology fac
ulty upheld Mosher's right to
publish his article wherever he
chose, severe objections were
raised to what the faculty consid
ered a violation of proper ethical
conduct by not concealing the
identity of his subjects.
There were adverse political im

plications of Mosher's choice to
publish his article in Taiwan,
where it could be interpreted as
a political attack on China; how
ever, the anthropology faculty dis
counted this when considering his
dismissal.
Mosher made three appeals to
the University to rescind his ex
pulsion, all of which were rejected.
He insisted that his dismissal was
based on his views on abortion,
as expressed in the article, and
was largely due to the University
bowing to political pressure from
the Chinese government and
China scholars in the United
States who objected to the article.
University President Donald
Kennedy, however, in addressing
Mosher's appeal, upheld the ex
pulsion and denied the existence
of outside pressure in the initial
decision-making process.
In his decision, Kennedy stated
that he found no evidence that,
prior to his review of the case,
any faculty involved in the deci
sion to expel Mosher received any
threats from the Chinese govern
ment.
During his consideration of the
appeal, however, Kennedy re
ceived a letter from a Chinese of
ficial stating that Mosher's
"behavior seriously damaged the
cultural and scholastic inter
change between China and the
U.S." and urging Kennedy to
"make a correct judgment, based
on the facts."
Kennedy, in his response to
Mosher, said that the letter "does
sound like a threat.... It is wrong
to give in to a threat. It is equally
wrong, however, to alter a decision
in order to avoid the appearance
of yielding to a threat."
In his response to Mosher's
final appeal, Kennedy refuted

Mosher's claim that the article
was the main issue in his dismis
sal. Instead, Kennedy pointed to
Mosher's "lack of candor" in
dealing with his advisers and a
pattern of behavior which
"destroyed the confidence" of the
Anthropology Department in his
ability to meet the requirements
of his profession.
James Gibbs, Anthropology De
partment chair, said the Mosher
case was "an important one ...
because, as the department viewed
it, it began and ended with the
principle that anthropology de
mands high ethical standards and
veracity on the part of the field
researchers."
Prof. Clifford Barnett, who was
chair of the department during
the investigation of Mosher's case,
was pleased with the legal out
come of the case, but viewed the
situation in general as unfortu
nate.
"It is a tragic situation to find

it necessary to dismiss an other
wise bright student from a grad
uate program. But the Anthro
pology Department has a respon
sibility to the profession and to
itself to enforce the standards as
it sees them," he said.
After his third appeal was
turned down in 1984, Mosher
decided to take legal action
against the University.
In 1986, Mosher sued Stanford
on eight different counts. The
first, that Stanford had violated
his federal constitutional rights,
was soon dropped on the grounds
that the case did not involve a
federal question. Six of the seven
remaining counts addressed the
process by which the Anthropol
ogy Department terminated
Mosher's candidacy and con
sidered his appeal.
Mosher claimed that the proce
dure by which he was expelled
was unfair and the findings
wrong.
The six counts were all dis
missed by the California Superior
Court. The court stated that Stan
ford appeared to "have a full, fair
and thorough investigation of the
facts."
The final remaining count, that
of defamation, was based largely
on Kennedy's publicized response
to Mosher's third appeal, accord
ing to attorney Heilbron. In pre
paring a motion for dismissal of
this final count, the University
was permitted to question Mosher
under oath.
Much of the questioning cen
tered around a camera and lens
which Mosher supposedly pur
chased using a federal grant he
received for his fieldwork in
China. Mosher claims that he dis
carded both items shortly after
filing the legal charges, according

to Heilbron.
The camera and lens could have
been important evidence in Mosh
er's case, Heilbron added, helping
either to undermine the
credibility of the evidence against
Mosher or to confirm other
evidence against him.
"Destruction of important
evidence, such as the camera, is
known as spoliation of evidence,
and in certain situations it may
be viewed as a violation of civil
and criminal law," Heilbron said.
The University moved to ask
for penalties against Mosher for
spoliation of evidence, and Mosh
er's deposition was scheduled to
continue. In that setting, Mosher
decided to drop the entire suit:
the defamation count, as well as
the possibility of any appeals
based on his claims that his ex
pulsion was due to his stance on
abortion, according to Heilbron.
The conclusion and outcome of
the case was hailed by Kennedy,
who viewed it as "a welcome vin
dication of the University's pro
cesses."

on eight different counts. The
first, that Stanford had violated
his federal constitutional rights,
was soon dropped on the grounds
that the case did not involve a
federal question. Six of the seven
remaining counts addressed the
process by which the Anthropol
ogy Department terminated
Mosher's candidacy and con
sidered his appeal.
Mosher claimed that the proce
dure by which he was expelled
was unfair and the findings
wrong.
The six counts were all dis
missed by the California Superior
Court. The court stated that Stan
ford appeared to "have a full, fair
and thorough investigation of the
facts."
The final remaining count, that
of defamation, was based largely
on Kennedy's publicized response
to Mosher's third appeal, accord
ing to attorney Heilbron. In pre
paring a motion for dismissal of
this final count, the University
was permitted to question Mosher
under oath.
Much of the questioning cen
tered around a camera and lens
which Mosher supposedly pur
chased using a federal grant he
received for his fieldwork in
China. Mosher claims that he dis
carded both items shortly after
filing the legal charges, according

to Heilbron.
The camera and lens could have
been important evidence in Mosh
er's case, Heilbron added, helping
either to undermine the
credibility of the evidence against
Mosher or to confirm other
evidence against him.
"Destruction of important
evidence, such as the camera, is
known as spoliation of evidence,
and in certain situations it may
be viewed as a violation of civil
and criminal law," Heilbron said.
The University moved to ask
for penalties against Mosher for
spoliation of evidence, and Mosh
er's deposition was scheduled to
continue. In that setting, Mosher
decided to drop the entire suit:
the defamation count, as well as
the possibility of any appeals
based on his claims that his ex
pulsion was due to his stance on
abortion, according to Heilbron.
The conclusion and outcome of
the case was hailed by Kennedy,
who viewed it as "a welcome vin

Steven Mosher
Steven Mosher, expelled in 1983
from Stanford's doctoral program
in anthropology for alleged uneth
ical counduct while conducting re
search in China, has dropped the
last of the legal charges he
brought against the University re
garding his dismissal.
Mosher sued the University in
1986 on eight counts, seven of
which were dropped by the state
superior court. Mosher recently
dropped the remaining count of
defamation after claiming that he
had discarded a key piece of
evidence.
He will receive neither his doc
torate nor any monetary compen
sation from Stanford. In addition
to abandoning the suit, Mosher

has agreed to turn over to the
University all documents and
photos of documents he collected
while doing research in China. He
will have exclusive use of these
documents for one year before
releasing them to the University.
David Heilbron of McCulchen,
Doyle, Brown and Enerson in San
Francisco, who represented Stan
ford in the case, said Mosher's
"complete abandonment of the
lawsuit for no payment — not a
single dime — speaks for itself on
the merits of his claims."
Neither Mosher nor his attor
ney was available for comment
last night. Heilbron discussed the
case with Stanford News Service
and provided details of the dis
pute's history.
In 1979, Mosher became one of
the first American students per

mitted to conduct extensive field
research in China. While enrolled
in Stanford's graduate anthropol
ogy program, Mosher spent nine
months observing the lifestyle on
a rural Chinese commune.
Mosher's doctoral candidacy
was terminated in 1983 by unan
imous vote of the Anthropology
Department faculty. The decision
to dismiss Mosher followed an ex
tensive investigation by an ad hoc
University committee and was
based on the conclusion that
Mosher had engaged in "illegal
and seriously unethical conduct"
that "seriously endangered his re
search subjects."
The findings of the committee
were contained in a 47-page
report, a copy of which was given
to Mosher. According to the fac
ulty, the report demonstrated his
unethical behavior using "per
suasive evidence that cannot be
revealed without endangering in
nocent persons." For this reason,
the report has never been made
public by the University or Mosh
er.
Mosher, while providing only a
blanket denial for the items con
tained in the report, still claimed
that the University's motives be
hind his dismissal were based on
"slanderous" allegations by his ex
wife, Maggie So, and pressure
from the Chinese government,
which objected to an article
Mosher published dealing with
forced abortions he witnessed
while in China.
Although Mosher was accused
of various offenses by the Chinese
government, the most controver
sial of his actions concerned an
article published by Mosher in the
popular Taiwan newspaper, Chi
nese Weekly.
The article, which dealt with
birth control practices in China,
described infanticide and forced
abortions as late as eight and nine
months into pregnancy. The arti
cle included identifiable photo
graphs of women about to
undergo abortions.
Although the anthropology fac
ulty upheld Mosher's right to
publish his article wherever he
chose, severe objections were
raised to what the faculty consid
ered a violation of proper ethical
conduct by not concealing the
identity of his subjects.
There were adverse political im

plications of Mosher's choice to
publish his article in Taiwan,
where it could be interpreted as
a political attack on China; how
ever, the anthropology faculty dis
counted this when considering his
dismissal.
Mosher made three appeals to
the University to rescind his ex
pulsion, all of which were rejected.
He insisted that his dismissal was
based on his views on abortion,
as expressed in the article, and
was largely due to the University
bowing to political pressure from
the Chinese government and
China scholars in the United
States who objected to the article.
University President Donald
Kennedy, however, in addressing
Mosher's appeal, upheld the ex
pulsion and denied the existence
of outside pressure in the initial
decision-making process.
In his decision, Kennedy stated
that he found no evidence that,
prior to his review of the case,
any faculty involved in the deci
sion to expel Mosher received any
threats from the Chinese govern
ment.
During his consideration of the
appeal, however, Kennedy re
ceived a letter from a Chinese of
ficial stating that Mosher's
"behavior seriously damaged the
cultural and scholastic inter
change between China and the
U.S." and urging Kennedy to
"make a correct judgment, based
on the facts."
Kennedy, in his response to
Mosher, said that the letter "does
sound like a threat.... It is wrong
to give in to a threat. It is equally
wrong, however, to alter a decision
in order to avoid the appearance
of yielding to a threat."
In his response to Mosher's
final appeal, Kennedy refuted

Mosher's claim that the article
was the main issue in his dismis
sal. Instead, Kennedy pointed to
Mosher's "lack of candor" in
dealing with his advisers and a
pattern of behavior which
"destroyed the confidence" of the
Anthropology Department in his
ability to meet the requirements
of his profession.
James Gibbs, Anthropology De
partment chair, said the Mosher
case was "an important one ...
because, as the department viewed
it, it began and ended with the
principle that anthropology de
mands high ethical standards and
veracity on the part of the field
researchers."
Prof. Clifford Barnett, who was
chair of the department during
the investigation of Mosher's case,
was pleased with the legal out
come of the case, but viewed the
situation in general as unfortu
nate.
"It is a tragic situation to find

it necessary to dismiss an other
wise bright student from a grad
uate program. But the Anthro
pology Department has a respon
sibility to the profession and to
itself to enforce the standards as
it sees them," he said.
After his third appeal was
turned down in 1984, Mosher
decided to take legal action
against the University.
In 1986, Mosher sued Stanford
on eight different counts. The
first, that Stanford had violated
his federal constitutional rights,
was soon dropped on the grounds
that the case did not involve a

that he found no evidence that,
prior to his review of the case,
any faculty involved in the deci
sion to expel Mosher received any
threats from the Chinese govern
ment.
During his consideration of the
appeal, however, Kennedy re
ceived a letter from a Chinese of
ficial stating that Mosher's
"behavior seriously damaged the
cultural and scholastic inter
change between China and the
U.S." and urging Kennedy to
"make a correct judgment, based
on the facts."
Kennedy, in his response to
Mosher, said that the letter "does
sound like a threat.... It is wrong
to give in to a threat. It is equally
wrong, however, to alter a decision
in order to avoid the appearance
of yielding to a threat."
In his response to Mosher's
final appeal, Kennedy refuted

Mosher's claim that the article
was the main issue in his dismis
sal. Instead, Kennedy pointed to
Mosher's "lack of candor" in
dealing with his advisers and a
pattern of behavior which
"destroyed the confidence" of the
Anthropology Department in his
ability to meet the requirements
of his profession.
James Gibbs, Anthropology De
partment chair, said the Mosher
case was "an important one ...
because, as the department viewed
it, it began and ended with the
principle that anthropology de
mands high ethical standards and
veracity on the part of the field
researchers."
Prof. Clifford Barnett, who was
chair of the department during
the investigation of Mosher's case,
was pleased with the legal out
come of the case, but viewed the
situation in general as unfortu
nate.
"It is a tragic situation to find

it necessary to dismiss an other
wise bright student from a grad
uate program. But the Anthro
pology Department has a respon
sibility to the profession and to
itself to enforce the standards as
it sees them," he said.
After his third appeal was
turned down in 1984, Mosher
decided to take legal action
against the University.
In 1986, Mosher sued Stanford
on eight different counts. The
first, that Stanford had violated
his federal constitutional rights,
was soon dropped on the grounds
that the case did not involve a
federal question. Six of the seven
remaining counts addressed the
process by which the Anthropol
ogy Department terminated
Mosher's candidacy and con
sidered his appeal.
Mosher claimed that the proce
dure by which he was expelled
was unfair and the findings
wrong.
The six counts were all dis
missed by the California Superior
Court. The court stated that Stan
ford appeared to "have a full, fair
and thorough investigation of the
facts."
The final remaining count, that
of defamation, was based largely
on Kennedy's publicized response
to Mosher's third appeal, accord
ing to attorney Heilbron. In pre
paring a motion for dismissal of
this final count, the University
was permitted to question Mosher
under oath.
Much of the questioning cen
tered around a camera and lens
which Mosher supposedly pur
chased using a federal grant he
received for his fieldwork in
China. Mosher claims that he dis
carded both items shortly after
filing the legal charges, according

to Heilbron.
The camera and lens could have
been important evidence in Mosh
er's case, Heilbron added, helping
either to undermine the
credibility of the evidence against
Mosher or to confirm other
evidence against him.
"Destruction of important
evidence, such as the camera, is
known as spoliation of evidence,
and in certain situations it may
be viewed as a violation of civil
and criminal law," Heilbron said.
The University moved to ask
for penalties against Mosher for
spoliation of evidence, and Mosh
er's deposition was scheduled to
continue. In that setting, Mosher
decided to drop the entire suit:
the defamation count, as well as
the possibility of any appeals
based on his claims that his ex
pulsion was due to his stance on
abortion, according to Heilbron.
The conclusion and outcome of
the case was hailed by Kennedy,
who viewed it as "a welcome vin
dication of the University's pro
cesses."
