# Mosher drops last of charges
## Stanford cleared by 'abandonment' of 1986 suit 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Steven Mosher, expelled in 1983
from Stanford's doctoral program
in anthropology for alleged uneth
ical counduct while conducting re
search in China, has dropped the
last of the legal charges he
brought against the University re
garding his dismissal.
Mosher sued the University in
1986 on eight counts, seven of
which were dropped by the state
superior court. Mosher recently
dropped the remaining count of
defamation after claiming that he
had discarded a key piece of
evidence.
He will receive neither his doc
torate nor any monetary compen
sation from Stanford. In addition
to abandoning the suit, Mosher

has agreed to turn over to the
University all documents and
photos of documents he collected
while doing research in China. He
will have exclusive use of these
documents for one year before
releasing them to the University.
David Heilbron of McCulchen,
Doyle, Brown and Enerson in San
Francisco, who represented Stan
ford in the case, said Mosher's
"complete abandonment of the
lawsuit for no payment — not a
single dime — speaks for itself on
the merits of his claims."
Neither Mosher nor his attor
ney was available for comment
last night. Heilbron discussed the
case with Stanford News Service
and provided details of the dis
pute's history.
In 1979, Mosher became one of
the first American students per

mitted to conduct extensive field
research in China. While enrolled
in Stanford's graduate anthropol
ogy program, Mosher spent nine
months observing the lifestyle on
a rural Chinese commune.
Mosher's doctoral candidacy
was terminated in 1983 by unan
imous vote of the Anthropology
Department faculty. The decision
to dismiss Mosher followed an ex
tensive investigation by an ad hoc
University committee and was
based on the conclusion that
Mosher had engaged in "illegal
and seriously unethical conduct"
that "seriously endangered his re
search subjects."
The findings of the committee
were contained in a 47-page
report, a copy of which was given
