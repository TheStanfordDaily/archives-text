## Noriega plea bargain ruled out Potentially embarrassing documents may be exposed in trial 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush's national security adviser and an
attorney for Manuel Noriega said yes
terday they didn't know which, if any,
sensitive U.S. documents could aid the
fallen dictator's defense against drug
charges, but the lawyer ruled out plea
bargaining to prevent their exposure.
"The government chose to bring Gen
eral Noriega to trial and they shall have
their trial," said Frank Rubino, one of
several attorneys defending the former
Panamanian ruler against U.S. indict
ments in Miami.
He said he would "absolutely not"
plea bargain. Such action normally
results in a guilty plea to lesser charges
in exchange for information the govern
ment can use in other cases.
A plea bargain would prevent a trial
and possible release of documents sensi
tive to national security or embarrass
ing to the government. The potential
threat of documents being released
could hamper U.S. prosecutors.
Last week, President Bush refused to
rule out a plea bargain, although one
of his aides indicated yestereday the
administration was comfortable with
the idea of a trial.
Presidential chief of staff John
Sununu, appearing on CBS-TV's "Face
the Nation," said the administration
wants to make sure Noriega gets a fair
trial.
'We ought not to do anything that
creates a different category for the de
fendant once he enters the judicial sys
tem," Sununu said in response to a
question about plea bargaining.
Rubino, appearing on ABC-TV's "This
Week With David Brinkley," said he
hadn't started looking for federal
records of U.S. involvement with Nori
ega that would clear his client, saying
it would be "speculation" to discuss

The government chose
to bring General Noriega
to trial and they shall
have their trial.'
— Noriega's attorney

what might exist.
Bush's national security adviser,
Brent Scowcroft, also on the ABC pro
gram, said the government would not
try to block release of documents simply
because they could be embarrassing to
the White House.
But he said he didn't know if any
documents existed relevant to the case
that might be injurious to national se
curity.
"As far as I know there aren't any,"
said Scowcroft. "You had the attorney
general saying he didn't anticipate any
problems of that character. I don't know
whether the files have been searched
to the ultimate."
A new book by Wall Street Journal
reporter Frederick Kempe charges that
the CIA under President Bush's direc
tion in 1976 began paying former Pan
amanian dictator Manuel Antonio Nor
iega $110,000 a year to keep quiet about
U.S. wiretapping in that country.
Kempe's book said the payments were
made even after Noriega bribed U.S.
officials to obtain secret intelligence
tapes and was linked to bombings aimed
at American targets.
Noriega had been ordered to "stir
things up" by then-Panamanian dictator
Omar Torrijos, who hoped to pressure
the United States to speed talks on
handing over the Panama Canal, ac
cording to the book, "Divorcing the Dic
tator." Excerpts of the book were printed

in the Jan. 15 issue of Newsweek mag
azine.
At the same time, Noriega discovered
an extensive U.S. wiretapping operation
in Panama and bribed American offi
cials to hand over copies of intelligence
tapes, the book said.
When the affair came to light, Lew
Allen Jr., then head of the National
Security Agency, wanted to send a mes
sage to other would-be traitors by
prosecuting Noriega and others.
"But CLA director Bush balked," the
book said.
Bush not only let Noriega and the
others go unpunished, he also opted to
continue paying Noriega $110,000 an
nually "for his CIA liaison," wrote
Kempe.
"Even back in 1976, Bush realized
that paying Noriega didn't mean buying
him," he wrote. "New intelligence in
the fall linked Noriega to a chain of
three bombings aimed at American
property and civilians."
The White House did not immediately
return telephone calls for reaction yes
terday night.
The book is to be published in March
by G.P. Putnam's Sons.
Also yesterday, the papal nuncio in
Panama said Noriega decided to give
himself up after an aide warned he
risked the same end as Italy's fascist
dictator, Benito Mussolini.
Monsignor Jose Sabastian Laboa, the
Vatican's representative in Panama, said
Capt. Eliecer Gaitan, Noriega's personal
security chief, helped persuade Noriega
to leave the Vatican Embassy, newspa
pers reported.
Gaitan told Noriega they risked the
same fate as Mussolini because Pana
manians would one day storm the em
bassy, Laboa was quoted as telling Ital
ian journalists in Panama.

eral Noriega to trial and they shall have
their trial," said Frank Rubino, one of
several attorneys defending the former
Panamanian ruler against U.S. indict
ments in Miami.
He said he would "absolutely not"
plea bargain. Such action normally
results in a guilty plea to lesser charges
in exchange for information the govern
ment can use in other cases.
A plea bargain would prevent a trial
and possible release of documents sensi
tive to national security or embarrass
ing to the government. The potential
threat of documents being released
could hamper U.S. prosecutors.
Last week, President Bush refused to
rule out a plea bargain, although one
of his aides indicated yestereday the
administration was comfortable with
the idea of a trial.
Presidential chief of staff John
Sununu, appearing on CBS-TV's "Face
the Nation," said the administration
wants to make sure Noriega gets a fair
trial.
'We ought not to do anything that
creates a different category for the de
fendant once he enters the judicial sys
tem," Sununu said in response to a
question about plea bargaining.
Rubino, appearing on ABC-TV's "This
Week With David Brinkley," said he
hadn't started looking for federal
records of U.S. involvement with Nori
ega that would clear his client, saying
it would be "speculation" to discuss

The government chose
to bring General Noriega
to trial and they shall
have their trial.'
— Noriega's attorney

what might exist.
Bush's national security adviser,
Brent Scowcroft, also on the ABC pro
gram, said the government would not
try to block release of documents simply
because they could be embarrassing to
the White House.
But he said he didn't know if any
documents existed relevant to the case
that might be injurious to national se
curity.
"As far as I know there aren't any,"
said Scowcroft. "You had the attorney
general saying he didn't anticipate any
problems of that character. I don't know
whether the files have been searched
to the ultimate."
A new book by Wall Street Journal
reporter Frederick Kempe charges that
the CIA under President Bush's direc
tion in 1976 began paying former Pan
amanian dictator Manuel Antonio Nor
iega $110,000 a year to keep quiet about
U.S. wiretapping in that country.
Kempe's book said the payments were
made even after Noriega bribed U.S.
officials to obtain secret intelligence
tapes and was linked to bombings aimed
at American targets.
Noriega had been ordered to "stir
things up" by then-Panamanian dictator
Omar Torrijos, who hoped to pressure
the United States to speed talks on
handing over the Panama Canal, ac
cording to the book, "Divorcing the Dic
tator." Excerpts of the book were printed

in the Jan. 15 issue of Newsweek mag
azine.
At the same time, Noriega discovered
an extensive U.S. wiretapping operation
in Panama and bribed American offi
cials to hand over copies of intelligence
tapes, the book said.
When the affair came to light, Lew
Allen Jr., then head of the National
Security Agency, wanted to send a mes
sage to other would-be traitors by
prosecuting Noriega and others.
"But CLA director Bush balked," the
book said.
Bush not only let Noriega and the
others go unpunished, he also opted to
continue paying Noriega $110,000 an
nually "for his CIA liaison," wrote
Kempe.
"Even back in 1976, Bush realized
that paying Noriega didn't mean buying
him," he wrote. "New intelligence in
the fall linked Noriega to a chain of
three bombings aimed at American
property and civilians."
The White House did not immediately
return telephone calls for reaction yes
terday night.
The book is to be published in March
by G.P. Putnam's Sons.
Also yesterday, the papal nuncio in
Panama said Noriega decided to give
himself up after an aide warned he
risked the same end as Italy's fascist
dictator, Benito Mussolini.
Monsignor Jose Sabastian Laboa, the
Vatican's representative in Panama, said
Capt. Eliecer Gaitan, Noriega's personal
security chief, helped persuade Noriega
to leave the Vatican Embassy, newspa
pers reported.
Gaitan told Noriega they risked the
same fate as Mussolini because Pana
manians would one day storm the em
bassy, Laboa was quoted as telling Ital
ian journalists in Panama.

Panamanian prisoners are guarded by U.S. Army personnel as they demolish a
portion of a detainee camp in Panama City on Saturday. Parts of the camp are being
dismantled as more detainees are released. 682 Panamanians are currently held in
the camp and a total of 4,268 have been processed.
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush's national security adviser and an
attorney for Manuel Noriega said yes
terday they didn't know which, if any,
sensitive U.S. documents could aid the
fallen dictator's defense against drug

bargaining to prevent their exposure.
