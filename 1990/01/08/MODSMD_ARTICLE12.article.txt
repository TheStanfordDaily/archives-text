# Investigation into mass Panamanian corruption underway
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Panamanian
investigators are preparing more than
300 corruption cases against officials of
♦Hp deposed regime, whose take may have
UlllO anted to one-fifth of Panama's na
tional budget, the Los Angeles Times re
ported yesterday.
Officials with the new civilian govern
ment say documents of the government
run by deposed Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega indicated 20 percent of the
budget went to pay political employees
who never worked, the Times reported.

Along with padding payrolls, former
municipal authorities are being investi
gatv for illegal procurement and other
emhi zlement schemes, the paper said,
quoting officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity. Investigations also-are un
derway in 12 ministries of the_ federal
government; ■ including finffWVo arW*
justice ministries, officials for those agen
cies said.
Three hundred criminal cases being
prepared by Panamanian authorities are
based on evidence gathered by the office

of Controller General Ruben Carles,
Panama's chief fiscal investigator, and
sent to the Attorney General, the paper
said.
"The public administration of the Nor
tecs regime was based only on seeing
how much they could steal. And what
■"ftrpy stole was incredible," Panama City
Mayor Guillermo Cochez said.
Cochez saicl his staff has identified and
fired employees who served in Noriega's
paramilitary Dignity Battalions. Officials
also are hunting phantom workers — the

no-show cronies who regularly received
government paychecks.
But corruption prosecutions are hin
dered by the sabotage of Supreme Court
records by Noriega loyalists early during
fighting in the capital on Dec. 21, the
paper said^.
Colfrt employees told investigators they
saw several Supreme Court magistrates
setting their own files afire. A blaze swept
through the court offices at the Justice
Ministry, destroying most of the case
records.

Computers, photocopiers, fax machines
and filing cabinets were methodically
smashed with axes and iron bars. Other
federal agencies were similarly sabotaged
before they were secured by U.S. forces.
After the U.S. invasion Dec. 20, about
40 tons of files were captured and taken
to U.ST. military bases in Panama for
analysis by the CIA and the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration.
Officials in the Controller General's of
fice said half the cases they have received
had been shelved by the Noriega regime.
