# Ethnic Slavs protest in Bulgaria against Turkish minority rights
## 
### 
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Demonstra
tors protesting the restoration of ethnic
and religious rights to the Turkish mi
nority yesterday shouted down Commu
nist officials and demanded they resign.
"Bulgaria — a one-nationality coun
try," read banners carried by some of
the 10,000 ethnic Slavs who rallied out
side Alexander Nevski Cathedral.
Standing in zero-degree weather, the
protesters booed, hissed or chanted
"Resignation! Resignation!" as Premier
Georgi Atanassov and Interior Minister
Atanas Semerdzhiev tried to address
them.

In an apparent attempt to appease the
protesters, Atanassov said Bulgarian
would remain the official language. But
both his and Semerdzhiev's speeches were
drowned out.
"A hard time will befall the country
whose people is divided," the official Bul
garian news agency BTA quoted
Semerdzhiev as saying. He appealed to
the crowd not to undermine "the tenden
cies towards democracy in the country."
The demonstrators were demanding
the repeal of a Dec. 29 order allowing
Bulgaria's 1.5 million ethnic Turks and
Moslems to use their Moslem names and

practice their religion without restric
tions.
That decision reversed the assimilation
policy introduced by ousted Communist
leader Todor Zhivkov, who forced ethnic
Turks to change their names to Bulgarian
ones and barred them from speaking
Turkish in public.
Nationalists among the Slav majority
fear the Turkish minority is growing too
fast and poses a threat to the country
of nearly 9 million.
BTA said residents from the southern
town of Kardzhali, where almost half the
50,000 inhabitants are ethnic Turks, said

Turkish flags had been seen on public
buildings.
Atanassov, in a television address yes
terday, said it was "inadmissable to raise
the flag of a foreign state at demonstra
tions and rallies in public and private
places."
He said the interior minister had been
told to maintain public peace and
"neutralize any anti-constitutional and
extremist acts under the framework of
law." He did not elaborate.
In an evening radio broadcast, Parlia
ment President Stanko Todorov proposed
a seven-day "social forum" to open today

and to discuss "several aspects of the
national question."
Todorov invited representatives of the
Bulgarian and Turkish-speaking popula
tions from northeastern and southern
regions to join the forum, which he said
should also include members of Parlia
ment, opposition groups and the Com
munist Party, as well as orthodox Chris
tian and Moslem religious leaders.
Some Bulgarians' anti-Turkish senti
ments are fueled by their Orthodox reli
gion and anger over centuries of Turkish
rule.
