# East Europeans seek advice
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Nobody has
much experience in moving a country from
communism to a system with a big role
for private business, so East European gov
ernments have turned for guidance to a
pair of worldwide bodies based in Wash
ington.
They are the World Bank and the Inter
national Monetary Fund, both owned by
152 countries which have many different
mixes of public and private ownership. The
United States takes a leading role in both
organizations.
Their headquarters face one another in
Washington, three blocks from the White
House. The bank is headed by President
Barber B. Conable, a former Republican
congressman from New York and a friend
of President Bush. At the fund, the top
official is traditionally a European, now
Managing Director Michel Camdessus of
France.
A senior IMF official said last week that
the fund is now in contact with all the
East European countries.
The Soviet Union has said it wants to
join, but the United States has opposed
that on the ground that the country is far
from a market economy. Poland and Hun
gary are already members. The new Czec
hoslovak government says it would like to
be.
Camdessus himself put the final touches
to an accord with Poland that has brought
decontrol of prices, a convertible currency
and other measures that the fund tradi
tionally advises.
"We believe that the program the Polish
authorities have adopted is a very strong
one," said the official, who spoke on con
dition he not be identified. "They are trying
to tackle in a very determined fashion the
key problem in the country, which is
skyrocketing inflation."
The fund and bank influence govern
ments mostly through loans and the con
ditions attached to them. They promote

The Soviet Union wants
to join the IMF, but the
U.S. is opposed to that

conservative policies: sale of state-owned
industry, reduced government deficits,
abolition of price controls, holding down
wages, promotion of exports, cuts in sub
sidies.
Poland has promised such policies, and
in return is expected to get a loan of $710
million from the fund. Billions in other
loans are expected to follow, on top of the
$42 billion Poland already owes.
The fund has been making similar ar
rangements for years with Third World
countries. The borrowing government's
promises generally result in a time of aus
terity: higher prices for food and other
basic goods as government subsidies are
cut; higher unemployment as unprofitable
enterprises are shut down. The fund says
the austerity will be worse if the measures
are delayed.
Sometimes the belt-tightening programs
have resulted in bloody rioting, as occurred
last year in Venezuela and Jordan.
In Poland, bus fares and gasoline prices
were doubled at the start of the new year.
Food prices are also rising. Higher food
prices previously have brought unrest when
they were imposed by the Warsaw govern
ment.
Because of the IMF's stiff requirements,
other lenders usually wait for the fund to
act before making new loans themselves.
The agreement between the fund and the
borrowing country has teeth. If the fund
decides that the hrrower has not kept its
promises, disbursements are cut off.
