Armed infiltrator shot
JERUSALEM (AP) - Soldiers
killed an armed infiltrator from Jor
dan near an Israeli tourist resort yes
terday in what was the fifth shooting
this year along the countries' border,
an army spokesman said.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
issued a tough statement on behalf of
the government, saying Israel regards
Jordan as fully responsible for any
border infiltrations.
The army spokesman said troops

opened fire on a gunman wearing a
Jordanian army uniform near the
Hamat Gader sulpher springs park,
five miles east of the Sea of Galilee.
The spokesman, who under military
regulations was not identified, said
the gunman was carrying a U.S.-made
M-16 assault rifle, standard equipment
in the Jordanian army. No Israeli sol
diers were reported wounded.
The gunman carried nine clips of
ammunition, four of which were
empty, the spokesman said, adding
that he believed it was likely that the
lone gunman was responsible for all
five shooting incidents this year.
Hostage-taking: supported
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Iranian
Parliament member Ali Akbar Moh
tashemi said in an interview released
yesterday that Iran does not want ties
with the United States and that the
Lebanese have a right to hold foreign
hostages.
In the interview with the English
language Tehran Times, the former
Iranian foreign minister said Iran is
interested in developing diplomatic re
lations with all the countries of the
world except the United States, Israel
and South Africa.
Mohtashemi said the holding of
foreign hostages in Lebanon was an
internal matter and he believes the
Lebanese are within their rights.
"Lebanese Sunnis, Shiites, Druse
and Christians are the hostages of the
U.S., Israel and other Western
powers," Mohtashemi said. "So it's
their natural right to take hostages

to inflict heavy blows on their
enemies."
"No negotiations, but force is the
answer to what the enemies of the
Lebanese have done against that
deprived nation," he said.
The 18 foreigners held hostage in
Lebanon are believed held by Shiite
Moslem groups loyal to Iran. The
hostages include eight Americans,
among them Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The As
sociated Press.
President Hashemi Rafsanjani
ousted Mohtashemi as interior minis
ter after his election last July. Moh
tashemi, a leader of a radical group
of clergy, was elected to Parliament
in a by-election last month.
