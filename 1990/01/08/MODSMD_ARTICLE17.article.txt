## Annual advances 
### 
New year should bring
improved curriculum,
Tresidder and budget

AS THE UNIVERSITY moves
closer to its imminent Cen
tennial Celebration in fall
1991, Leland and Jane Stanford
can be proud of the progress made
by the keepers of their son's
memorial.
In less than 100 years, Stanford
has joined a premier league of top
universities that have had many
more years of experience.
But this is no time for Stanford
to rest on laurels. As the Univer
sity embarks on a new year and
new decade, it must adapt to a
new set of educational values while
grappling with the fiscal realities
of the 19905.
• The University's budget prob
lems, along with rising tuition and
student costs that are pushing a
Stanford education out of reach
for many must receive prompt at
tention as the University's largest
immediate crisis.
Studies are being conducted by
various task forces and committees
to streamline wherever possible,
but all University personnel must
commit themselves to cooperative
efforts at budget reduction. More
joint ventures with other univer
sities will become increasingly nec
essary to share research and
teaching costs.
Passing increasing University
costs directly to students is no
longer a viable option, especially
considering limited financial aid
resources. A reasonable goal: tui
tion that rises at the rate of
inflation, but no faster.
• Stanford's curriculum must
change with the times and continue
to reflect global concerns associ
ated with contemporary social life.

The distribution requirement
system must be revamped to make
room for an ethnic studies require
ment that places no added credit
burden on students. Gender issues
and environmental studies must
also be addressed more thoroughly.
A more conscious effort also
needs to be made to mainstream
these topics, especially ethnic
studies, so they no longer have a
fringe status.
• The vision of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
must not fall by the wayside. Some
one has to make the changes hap
pen, and it's going to fall to
individuals as well as the institu
tion; it has to work from the bot
tom up as well as the top down.
Hiring of more minority faculty
and other goals outlined in the
committee's report will move the
University beyond diversity and
tolerance of difference to pluralism
and respect of individuality.
• Four years of guaranteed
housing remains an elusive goal,
and the planned Kimball Hall will
only be the foundation. Continued
commitment by alumni through
donations will help the University
rid itself of the Manzanita legacy.
• An improved Tresidder may fi
nally come to fruition in the next
year, but the union still falls far
short of being a student center —
as can be found at other schools.
Students need a 24-hour hangout
and study center, and Tresidder
should be it.
• Growing numbers of student
organizations that serve the Stan
ford community create a need for
more space. Visible action must
follow the stated commitment
made by University officials, and
Student Organization Services
should publicly release its current
plans and make sure they receive
speedy implementation.
Each new year has its own
resolutions. One should be that
next year's list can be different.
