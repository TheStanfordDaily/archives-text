## Realizing King's dream 
### 
AS WE CELEBRATE the 61st an
niversary of Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birth next Monday, we should
all stop to consider his dream — the
context in which it arose, what measures
it took or takes to achieve it and what
it means for our lives today.
King had a dream that one day African-
American people would not have to suffer
the indignities of racism because of their
color or nation of origin. That instead,
they would be regarded as the equals of
whites and given all the rights and
privileges of citzenship.
When King first rose to national
prominence, black people had suffered
from a whole host of racist injustices,
from segregation to disenfranchisement,
from lynchings to labor exploitation
dating back to the first Africans who
were stolen from their home to lahor for***"
a cruel and despotic people.
By 1955, African-Americans in Mont- ~
gomery, Ala. had endured the humiliation
of bus segregation for far too long. By
1955, seamstress Rosa Parks — as well
as the countless black women and men
before her — had grown too tired to have
to find a seat in the back of the bus or
remain standing over empty seats so that
white people could enjoy a comfortable
ride just because of their color.
The time had come for black
Montgomerians to rise up and take bold,
dramatic action to seize their rights of
respect, citizenship and freedom from
racist laws because they were certainly
not going to be given them by those in
power.
On Dec. 5, 1955, when Rosa Parks sat
down, the African-American community

of Montgomery stood up. The bus boycott
had begun. For a full year, the black
community refused to ride the buses until
they, as the most frequent patrons on
the buses, were afforded just and respect
able treatment.
Although a portion of whites applauded
what was considered to be bold and ag
gressive action by the city's black popu
lation, many whites — mostly those in
elected positions — felt vehemently that
what blacks were doing was at best
fomenting racial tension when things
were getting better (in their eyes), and
at worst, what blacks were doing was
illegal.
They took oft-used measures t " livide
and conquer" the movement, i. iuding
bombing King's home, arresting h .g and
other leaders on phony charges and basic
'harassment, all characteristic of those in
power threatened by the rising movement
of people whom they have denied basic
rights for so long.
But in the end, the African-Americans
of Montgomery were victorious. Their
movement sent ripples across America.
In 1990, as black people and all Amer
icans look back over these 35 years since
King's first rise to national acclaim to
this fourth celebration of his birth, we
need to examine how far we have come
to realize King's dream and the long dis
tance which we must yet go.
As we rang in the new decade, New
York City, plagued by racial tension, wit
nessed the swearing in of its first African-
American mayor, David Dinkins. How
ever, no meaningful motion toward the
capture of the presumably racist white
supremacist group responsible for the

recent mail bombings of selected National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People officials, and elected black
and progressive officials has been made.
In Boston, a pregnant white women
was fatally shot and her husband
wounded, according to the husband, by
a black man. Now, after racist backlash
and police brutality against the city's
black men, African-Americans are out
raged at the revelation that the m'-
was apparently committed by the wmie
husband.
In 1990, why do make-believe attacks
on white people such as in the Boston
story command so much more attention
and unquestioned indignation than those
real physical, educational, economic and
political attacks against black people that
occur daily?
No, we have not forgotten Tawana
Brawley, Howard Beach, Yusef Hawkins,
Virginia Beach or any of the other count
less attacks against African-Americans.
In 1990, havn't we come far enough
to realize King's dream? Or does African-
American life mean as little as it did
when we first stepped off the slave ship?

The time had come for black
Montgomerians to rise up and take bold,
dramatic action to seize their rights of
respect, citizenship and freedom from
racist laws because they were certainly
not going to be given them by those in
power.
On Dec. 5, 1955, when Rosa Parks sat
down, the African-American community

of Montgomery stood up. The bus boycott
had begun. For a full year, the black
community refused to ride the buses until
they, as the most frequent patrons on
the buses, were afforded just and respect
able treatment.
Although a portion of whites applauded
what was considered to be bold and ag
gressive action by the city's black popu
lation, many whites — mostly those in
elected positions — felt vehemently that
what blacks were doing was at best
fomenting racial tension when things
were getting better (in their eyes), and
at worst, what blacks were doing was
illegal.
They took oft-used measures t " livide
and conquer" the movement, i. iuding
bombing King's home, arresting h .g and
other leaders on phony charges and basic
'harassment, all characteristic of those in
power threatened by the rising movement
of people whom they have denied basic
rights for so long.
But in the end, the African-Americans
of Montgomery were victorious. Their
movement sent ripples across America.
In 1990, as black people and all Amer
icans look back over these 35 years since
King's first rise to national acclaim to
this fourth celebration of his birth, we
need to examine how far we have come
to realize King's dream and the long dis
tance which we must yet go.
As we rang in the new decade, New
York City, plagued by racial tension, wit
nessed the swearing in of its first African-
American mayor, David Dinkins. How
ever, no meaningful motion toward the
capture of the presumably racist white
supremacist group responsible for the

recent mail bombings of selected National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People officials, and elected black
and progressive officials has been made.
In Boston, a pregnant white women
was fatally shot and her husband
wounded, according to the husband, by
a black man. Now, after racist backlash
and police brutality against the city's
black men, African-Americans are out
raged at the revelation that the m'-
was apparently committed by the wmie
husband.
In 1990, why do make-believe attacks
on white people such as in the Boston
story command so much more attention
and unquestioned indignation than those
real physical, educational, economic and
political attacks against black people that
occur daily?
No, we have not forgotten Tawana
Brawley, Howard Beach, Yusef Hawkins,
Virginia Beach or any of the other count
less attacks against African-Americans.
In 1990, havn't we come far enough
to realize King's dream? Or does African-
American life mean as little as it did
when we first stepped off the slave ship?
