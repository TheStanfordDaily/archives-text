# Beyers departs News Service
## 28-year veteran, administrators didn't see eye to eye 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Twenty-eight years ago, Bob
Beyers arrived at the Stanford
News Service determined to put
his many journalistic talents to
work at a news agency that was
not a slave to public relations.
Now, after winning many ac
colades and awards, Beyers is
retiring, the confidence in his
leadership crumbling and his faith
in the University's administration
shaken. Beyers, who took a leave
of absence fall quarter, has
decided not to come back.
In his resignation letter, Beyers,
58, wrote to University President
Donald Kennedy that he has been
told by administrators "that the
University has become a billion
dollar corporation, and we in
News Service should behave ac
cordingly." He continued, "I be
lieve people respond to ideas, not
bureaucracies — to stories, not
memos."
Beyers' final years at the News
Service were marred by personal
ity conflicts within the adminis
tration, particularly with Robert
Freelen, vice president for public
affairs. Beyers said none of the
conflicts involved Kennedy or
Provost James Rosse.
The News Service produces
Campus Report, the Stanford Ob
server, special-issue tabloids and

press releases, which are sent to
journalists around the Bay Area
and the country. The News Serv
ice, which falls under the juris
diction of the Office of Public
Affairs, serves as a link between
journalists and Stanford, and
much of the country's coverage of
the University is shaped by that
office.
Freelen and Beyers clashed of
ten about the role of the News
Service within the University, and
Freelen has rejected Beyers' at
tempts to make the News Service
more independent of University
control.

Freelen has also said that the
University is not best served by
a news bureau that focuses on
Stanford's failures, but Beyers
said he holds a deep-rooted belief
that Stanford gains respect by
openly admitting its own
shortcomings.
The personality conflict was so
bad that the two conversed pri
marily by memorandum.
In the spring, the conflict
reached a bitter climax. "I told
my wife, 'I don't see how this can
go on,' " Beyers said. He drafted
his resignation letter but never
sent it.
The Public Affairs Office, at the
request of Beyers, asked John
Burness, vice president for uni
versity relations at Cornell
University, to make recommenda
tions about the organizational and
personality tensions.
After interviewing 33 people
and reading through material 10
inches thick supplied by Freelen
and Beyers, Burness concluded
that Beyers should step down
from management to continue ed
ucation writing with the News
Service.
The Public Affairs Office re
leased a copy of the report with
the permission of Burness,
Freelen and Beyers. The release
marks a shift in the University's


Bob Beyers
policy of not disclosing reports cri
tical of any personnel.
Burness concluded, with special
emphasis in the report, "I found
no evidence to support Bob
Beyers' assertion that Bob
Freelen's focus on 'the manage
ment of productivity' is related to
a desire on his part, or that of
anyone else in a position of au
thority at Stanford, to change the
fundamental underlying philoso
phy of openness that has served,
and continues to serve the Uni
versity so well."
About Beyers, Burness found,
"Beyers is regarded by virtually
everyone I spoke to at Stanford
as an individual of extraordinary
dedication, loyalty and commit
ment to Stanford University."
Freelen concurred: "He's terrific.
There's no question about that."
The report continues, "The un
derlying philosophy of openness

and integrity that characterizes
the Stanford News Service has
led to the national media's per
ception of Stanford as a great
place and of Bob Beyers as abso
lutely trustworthy."
But the report is also extremely
critical of his managerial ability
and his independence.
"It is clear that Beyers does
what Beyers does magnificently;
the question is whether Bob does
what Stanford needs," the Bur
ness report said. "He appears to
be mired in a culture of indepen
dence and to take a black-and
white, absolutist approach to
questions about how the News
Service should operate."
One person told Burness,
"Beyers has created a siege men
tality within the administration
so that you feel if you're talking
with him, you need to ask the
question whether you're on the
record or off. When he comes into
my office, I turn over everything
on the desk."
"I think the report made it

quite clear that I did not have
the support of many other people
in the administration," Beyers
said. "It's better to start with a
clean slate rather than hanging
around."
After the confidential report
was finished, Beyers said he told
Kennedy that his "heart was no
longer in working for the Univer
sity." Kennedy suggested he take
a leave of absence to rethink his
plans, and now, after three
months away from the University,
Beyers said he is definitely
leaving.
"I remain very concerned about
the trends which I see ... in terms
of the allocations of resources and
the openness," he said.
The budget for the News Serv
ice has remained virtually un
changed for four years. Beyers
said he thinks Stanford needs to
devote more money and resources
toward broader coverage of the
University, particularly in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and on multicultural and environ

mental issues.
Two years ago, Beyers found
fundamental problems at the En
vironmental Safety Facility, the
building housing Stanford's safety
office, but his office lacked the
resources to investigate the prob
lems.
Beyers wrote in a reply to Bur
ness's report: "I deeply regretted
what followed: a whistle-blower's
report that culminated in a
$200,000 out-of-court settlement,
a public apology from the presi
dent, a $1.3 million increase in
budget base for safety-related con
cerns and a bundle of headlines
that continues to this day."
Beyers' resignation has sparked
concern from news writers
throughout the Bay Area.
Bill Workman, the San Fran
cisco Chronicle reporter who
covers Stanford, said that in his
20 years working with Beyers he
has "had the highest regard for
his professionalism. He's like
dealing with a fellow newspaper
man."

Workman described Beyers as
a "beacon of timeliness," a "man
of principle" with "encyclopedic
knowledge of Stanford." He said
Beyers has helped to shape Stan
ford's public image. "The impres
sion one gets of Stanford is an
outstandingly open campus."
When asked whether he was
worried about a potential decline
in credibility of the News Service,
Workman said, "I must say I'm
concerned. I'm not extremely
worried."
"Bob's resignation in itself is a
blow to Stanford, but we should
cross our fingers that the News
Service's open and honest ap
proach will win out over the forces
that want to gloss over the Uni
versity's mistakes," stated Tim
Marklein, editor in chief of The
Daily.
Beyers was named "most out
standing news director for 1989"
by the editors of TQS News, a
national Chicano publication em
phasizing higher education.

Beyers also won the Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson award for excep
tional service to Stanford in 1983.
Beyers came to Stanford in
1961 as director of the News Serv
ice after five years as assistant
managing editor of the University
of Michigan's News Service. He
graduated in 1953 from Cornell,
where he edited the Cornell Daily
Sun.
In 1964, while on leave from
Stanford, he served as volunteer
coordinator of media and police
relations for the Mississippi Sum
mer Project.
Eileen Walsh, who has been the
editor of Campus Report, will
remain acting director of the
News Service. She said despite
natural tensions between the
News Service and the rest of the
administration, she will continue
Beyers' policy of openness.
According to Freelen, "I don't
think anyone can accuse us of
running a news service that is a
PR arm or approaching one."

Beyers arrived at the Stanford
News Service determined to put
his many journalistic talents to

has "had the highest regard for

Workman described Beyers as
a "beacon of timeliness," a "man

Beyers has helped to shape Stan

outstandingly open campus."
When asked whether he was
worried about a potential decline
in credibility of the News Service,
Workman said, "I must say I'm
concerned. I'm not extremely

"Bob's resignation in itself is a
blow to Stanford, but we should
cross our fingers that the News
Service's open and honest ap
proach will win out over the forces
that want to gloss over the Uni
versity's mistakes," stated Tim
Marklein, editor in chief of The

Beyers was named "most out
standing news director for 1989"
by the editors of TQS News, a
national Chicano publication em
phasizing higher education.

Beyers also won the Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson award for excep
tional service to Stanford in 1983.
Beyers came to Stanford in
1961 as director of the News Serv
ice after five years as assistant
managing editor of the University
of Michigan's News Service. He
graduated in 1953 from Cornell,
where he edited the Cornell Daily
Sun.
In 1964, while on leave from
Stanford, he served as volunteer
coordinator of media and police
relations for the Mississippi Sum
mer Project.
Eileen Walsh, who has been the
editor of Campus Report, will
remain acting director of the
News Service. She said despite
natural tensions between the
News Service and the rest of the
administration, she will continue
Beyers' policy of openness.
According to Freelen, "I don't
think anyone can accuse us of
running a news service that is a
PR arm or approaching one."
Twenty-eight years ago, Bob
Beyers arrived at the Stanford
News Service determined to put
his many journalistic talents to
work at a news agency that was
not a slave to public relations.
Now, after winning many ac
colades and awards, Beyers is
retiring, the confidence in his
leadership crumbling and his faith
in the University's administration
shaken. Beyers, who took a leave
of absence fall quarter, has
decided not to come back.
In his resignation letter, Beyers,
58, wrote to University President
Donald Kennedy that he has been
told by administrators "that the
University has become a billion
dollar corporation, and we in
News Service should behave ac
cordingly." He continued, "I be
lieve people respond to ideas, not
bureaucracies — to stories, not
memos."
Beyers' final years at the News
Service were marred by personal
ity conflicts within the adminis
tration, particularly with Robert
Freelen, vice president for public
affairs. Beyers said none of the
conflicts involved Kennedy or
Provost James Rosse.
The News Service produces
Campus Report, the Stanford Ob
server, special-issue tabloids and

press releases, which are sent to
journalists around the Bay Area
and the country. The News Serv
ice, which falls under the juris
diction of the Office of Public
Affairs, serves as a link between
journalists and Stanford, and
much of the country's coverage of
the University is shaped by that
office.
Freelen and Beyers clashed of
ten about the role of the News
Service within the University, and
Freelen has rejected Beyers' at
tempts to make the News Service
more independent of University
control.

Freelen has also said that the
University is not best served by
a news bureau that focuses on
Stanford's failures, but Beyers
said he holds a deep-rooted belief
that Stanford gains respect by
openly admitting its own
shortcomings.
The personality conflict was so
bad that the two conversed pri
marily by memorandum.
In the spring, the conflict
reached a bitter climax. "I told
my wife, 'I don't see how this can
go on,' " Beyers said. He drafted
his resignation letter but never
sent it.
The Public Affairs Office, at the
request of Beyers, asked John
Burness, vice president for uni
versity relations at Cornell
University, to make recommenda
tions about the organizational and
personality tensions.
After interviewing 33 people
and reading through material 10
inches thick supplied by Freelen
and Beyers, Burness concluded
that Beyers should step down
from management to continue ed
ucation writing with the News
Service.
The Public Affairs Office re
leased a copy of the report with
the permission of Burness,
Freelen and Beyers. The release
marks a shift in the University's


Bob Beyers
policy of not disclosing reports cri
tical of any personnel.
Burness concluded, with special
emphasis in the report, "I found
no evidence to support Bob
Beyers' assertion that Bob
Freelen's focus on 'the manage
ment of productivity' is related to
a desire on his part, or that of
anyone else in a position of au
thority at Stanford, to change the
fundamental underlying philoso
phy of openness that has served,
and continues to serve the Uni
versity so well."
About Beyers, Burness found,
"Beyers is regarded by virtually
everyone I spoke to at Stanford
as an individual of extraordinary
dedication, loyalty and commit
ment to Stanford University."
Freelen concurred: "He's terrific.
There's no question about that."
The report continues, "The un
derlying philosophy of openness

and integrity that characterizes
the Stanford News Service has
led to the national media's per
ception of Stanford as a great
place and of Bob Beyers as abso
lutely trustworthy."
But the report is also extremely
critical of his managerial ability
and his independence.
"It is clear that Beyers does
what Beyers does magnificently;
the question is whether Bob does
what Stanford needs," the Bur
ness report said. "He appears to
be mired in a culture of indepen
dence and to take a black-and
white, absolutist approach to
questions about how the News
Service should operate."
One person told Burness,
"Beyers has created a siege men
tality within the administration
so that you feel if you're talking
with him, you need to ask the
question whether you're on the
record or off. When he comes into
my office, I turn over everything
on the desk."
"I think the report made it

quite clear that I did not have
the support of many other people
in the administration," Beyers
said. "It's better to start with a
clean slate rather than hanging
around."
After the confidential report
was finished, Beyers said he told
Kennedy that his "heart was no
longer in working for the Univer
sity." Kennedy suggested he take
a leave of absence to rethink his
plans, and now, after three
months away from the University,
Beyers said he is definitely
leaving.
"I remain very concerned about
the trends which I see ... in terms
of the allocations of resources and
the openness," he said.
The budget for the News Serv
ice has remained virtually un
changed for four years. Beyers
said he thinks Stanford needs to
devote more money and resources
toward broader coverage of the
University, particularly in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and on multicultural and environ

mental issues.
Two years ago, Beyers found
fundamental problems at the En
vironmental Safety Facility, the
building housing Stanford's safety
office, but his office lacked the
resources to investigate the prob
lems.
Beyers wrote in a reply to Bur
ness's report: "I deeply regretted
what followed: a whistle-blower's
report that culminated in a
$200,000 out-of-court settlement,
a public apology from the presi
dent, a $1.3 million increase in
budget base for safety-related con
cerns and a bundle of headlines
that continues to this day."
Beyers' resignation has sparked
concern from news writers
throughout the Bay Area.
Bill Workman, the San Fran
cisco Chronicle reporter who
covers Stanford, said that in his
20 years working with Beyers he
has "had the highest regard for
his professionalism. He's like
dealing with a fellow newspaper
man."

Workman described Beyers as
a "beacon of timeliness," a "man
of principle" with "encyclopedic
knowledge of Stanford." He said
Beyers has helped to shape Stan
ford's public image. "The impres

so that you feel if you're talking
with him, you need to ask the
question whether you're on the
record or off. When he comes into
my office, I turn over everything
on the desk."
"I think the report made it

quite clear that I did not have
the support of many other people
in the administration," Beyers
said. "It's better to start with a
clean slate rather than hanging
around."
After the confidential report
was finished, Beyers said he told
Kennedy that his "heart was no
longer in working for the Univer
sity." Kennedy suggested he take
a leave of absence to rethink his
plans, and now, after three
months away from the University,
Beyers said he is definitely
leaving.
"I remain very concerned about
the trends which I see ... in terms
of the allocations of resources and
the openness," he said.
The budget for the News Serv
ice has remained virtually un
changed for four years. Beyers
said he thinks Stanford needs to
devote more money and resources
toward broader coverage of the
University, particularly in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and on multicultural and environ

mental issues.
Two years ago, Beyers found
fundamental problems at the En
vironmental Safety Facility, the
building housing Stanford's safety
office, but his office lacked the
resources to investigate the prob
lems.
Beyers wrote in a reply to Bur
ness's report: "I deeply regretted
what followed: a whistle-blower's
report that culminated in a
$200,000 out-of-court settlement,
a public apology from the presi
dent, a $1.3 million increase in
budget base for safety-related con
cerns and a bundle of headlines
that continues to this day."
Beyers' resignation has sparked
concern from news writers
throughout the Bay Area.
Bill Workman, the San Fran
cisco Chronicle reporter who
covers Stanford, said that in his
20 years working with Beyers he
has "had the highest regard for
his professionalism. He's like
dealing with a fellow newspaper
man."

Workman described Beyers as
a "beacon of timeliness," a "man
of principle" with "encyclopedic
knowledge of Stanford." He said
Beyers has helped to shape Stan
ford's public image. "The impres
sion one gets of Stanford is an
outstandingly open campus."
When asked whether he was
worried about a potential decline
in credibility of the News Service,
Workman said, "I must say I'm
concerned. I'm not extremely
worried."
"Bob's resignation in itself is a
blow to Stanford, but we should
cross our fingers that the News
Service's open and honest ap
proach will win out over the forces
that want to gloss over the Uni
versity's mistakes," stated Tim
Marklein, editor in chief of The
Daily.
Beyers was named "most out
standing news director for 1989"
by the editors of TQS News, a
national Chicano publication em
phasizing higher education.

Beyers also won the Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson award for excep
tional service to Stanford in 1983.
Beyers came to Stanford in
1961 as director of the News Serv
ice after five years as assistant
managing editor of the University
of Michigan's News Service. He
graduated in 1953 from Cornell,
where he edited the Cornell Daily
Sun.
In 1964, while on leave from
Stanford, he served as volunteer
coordinator of media and police
relations for the Mississippi Sum
mer Project.
Eileen Walsh, who has been the
editor of Campus Report, will
remain acting director of the
News Service. She said despite
natural tensions between the
News Service and the rest of the
administration, she will continue
Beyers' policy of openness.
According to Freelen, "I don't
think anyone can accuse us of
running a news service that is a
PR arm or approaching one."
