# Beyers departs News Service
## 28-year veteran, administrators didn't see eye to eye 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Twenty-eight years ago, Bob
Beyers arrived at the Stanford
News Service determined to put
his many journalistic talents to
work at a news agency that was
not a slave to public relations.
Now, after winning many ac
colades and awards, Beyers is
retiring, the confidence in his
leadership crumbling and his faith
in the University's administration
shaken. Beyers, who took a leave
of absence fall quarter, has
decided not to come back.
In his resignation letter, Beyers,
58, wrote to University President
Donald Kennedy that he has been
told by administrators "that the
University has become a billion
dollar corporation, and we in
News Service should behave ac
cordingly." He continued, "I be
lieve people respond to ideas, not
bureaucracies â€” to stories, not
memos."
Beyers' final years at the News
Service were marred by personal
ity conflicts within the adminis
tration, particularly with Robert
Freelen, vice president for public
affairs. Beyers said none of the
conflicts involved Kennedy or
Provost James Rosse.
The News Service produces
Campus Report, the Stanford Ob
server, special-issue tabloids and

press releases, which are sent to
journalists around the Bay Area
and the country. The News Serv
ice, which falls under the juris
diction of the Office of Public
Affairs, serves as a link between
journalists and Stanford, and
much of the country's coverage of
the University is shaped by that
office.
Freelen and Beyers clashed of
ten about the role of the News
Service within the University, and
Freelen has rejected Beyers' at
tempts to make the News Service
more independent of University
control.

Freelen has also said that the
University is not best served by
a news bureau that focuses on
Stanford's failures, but Beyers
said he holds a deep-rooted belief
that Stanford gains respect by
openly admitting its own
shortcomings.
The personality conflict was so
bad that the two conversed pri
marily by memorandum.
In the spring, the conflict
reached a bitter climax. "I told
my wife, 'I don't see how this can
go on,' " Beyers said. He drafted
his resignation letter but never
sent it.
The Public Affairs Office, at the
request of Beyers, asked John
Burness, vice president for uni
versity relations at Cornell
University, to make recommenda
tions about the organizational and
personality tensions.
After interviewing 33 people
and reading through material 10
inches thick supplied by Freelen
and Beyers, Burness concluded
that Beyers should step down
from management to continue ed
ucation writing with the News
Service.
The Public Affairs Office re
leased a copy of the report with
the permission of Burness,
Freelen and Beyers. The release
marks a shift in the University's
