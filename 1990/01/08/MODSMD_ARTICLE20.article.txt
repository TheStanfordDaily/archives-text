## Outgoing news director deserves praise, recognition 
### 
I WRITE TO honor Robert Beyers,
who has resigned as the director of
the University's News Service. I
met Beyers when I arrived at Stanford
over 20 years ago; the News Service
was cramped into the third floor of
Encina Hall along with the General
Secretary's Office (prior title of the
Office of Development).
It was immediately observable to me
that Beyers was one of the few people
who effectively implemented affirmative
action program at Stanford — and he
did so enthusiastically and without
urging from above.
That commitment continued over the
years, as he consistently found for his
staff competent and professional people

of color and women — individuals of
outstanding caliber that most of his
colleagues about the University cannot
seem to locate.
Also over the last few years, rarely
have documents published by the News
Service not included articles about or
by people of color, women and people
with disabilities. I also grew to appreci
ate Beyers' personal commitment to
human and civil rights causes beyond
the Stanford campus.
I think the Stanford community
need not worry about Beyers' future,
for there is news after Stanford for
him to record. I do think, however,
that those who remain should worry
about what is ahead for a most impor-

tant medium of expression within the
Stanford community: the Campus
Report.
Readers of the Campus Report have
to acknowledge its balance, objectivity
and the access it provides for individ
uals of varying perspectives to matters
on the University's agenda.
Will Beyers' departure signal an end
to the journalistic integrity that has
been a trademark of the News Service
and the Campus Report? Will the
Campus Report become a campus rag?
Will the burden increase on The Stan
ford Daily, The Real News and other
publications?
Will the charge of Beyers' successor

be to cook the news, and put a favor
able "spin" on all issues reported by
the News Service and printed in the
Campus Report? Will this person be
the likes of Pat Buchanan, or a former
editor of the Dartmouth Review? Will
the Girauds, Manleys and Rebholzes of
the University continue to have access
to the Campus Report, or will they be
censored?
The University has bestowed Beyers
with one of its highest honors, the
Cuthbertson Award, and I would like
to join it in praising his contributions
to Stanford.
