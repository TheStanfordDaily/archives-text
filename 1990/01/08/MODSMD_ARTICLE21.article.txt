# Library staff can assist with new limits on copying
## 
### 
We read with interest The Daily's
report and editorial on Stanford's new
license agreement with the Copyright
Clearance Center.
It is true that the copyright picture
is changing for the better for faculty,
students and library reserve units.
However, there are still some impor
tant limitations on copying that we
must keep in mind.
The Copyright Clearance Center
License currently covers but a fraction
of the thousands of publishers whose
works might be copied for class read
ings. In certain cases, such as use of
the same articles quarter after quarter
and anthologies or course readers that
include publications not covered under
the terms of the agreement, permission
to copy may be necessary

We would like to point out that the
library course reserves collections are
another very good alternative to asking
students to purchase all of the original
materials on a class reading list or to
reduce the number of required read
ings for a course.
Library reserves staffers pay close
attention to dozens of major copyright
interpretations. The reserves staff
maintains lists of publishers from
whom blanket permission to copy has
been obtained, writes to request per
mission to copy under certain circum
stances and keeps abreast of changes
in the copyright laws.
So while the new agreement is a
positive step and we are fortunate to
have a more open policy, we wanted to
make clear that there are still con
straints and that the library reserves
staff will be prepared to assist faculty
in working within the guidelines.
