# Breach of honor when Dead Week policies not upheld
## 
### 
Being a senior, I should be accus
tomed by now to the fact that Dead
Week and finals rarely conform to the
rules regulating them. But I surprised
myself by getting upset over another
rule violation.
I had a take-home due in a few
days, and being pressed for time, I
checked the finals policy statement in
the autumn time schedule to see if I
could wrangle some extra time.
Concerning take-home exams, the
rules say, "Although the instructor
may ask students to return take-home
examinations early in the final examin
ation period, the instructor may not
call them due until the end of the reg
ularly scheduled examination time for
that course."
The wording is a little ambiguous,

but I took the rule to mean that I
didn't have to turn the final in until
3:15 p.m., when the in-class test, if
we'd had one, would have ended. Since
the final was assigned to be due at
noon, that gave me three extra hours.
Wanting to be sure of my conclusion,
I called Academic Standing. The
woman to whom 1 spoke said that, no,
the final is due at noon; she cited
Sally Mahoney as having ruled that
professors may call exams due at the
beginning of the in-class final period.
"So the rule doesn't mean anything,"
I said. "No," the woman replied. I
tried to convince her that that since
this rule doesn't mean what it says, it
should be revised or omitted from the
policy statement altogether. In the end,
the woman and I came to an impasse.
It is a breach of honor for the Uni
versity to publish rules it doesn't fol
low. If de facto policy is to let profes
sors conduct Dead Week and finals as
they please, then don't mislead stu
dents by printing something else.
