## U.S. must try to demilitarize Panama if democracy is to survive 
### 
THE UNITED STATES had an op
portunity to remove former Pana
manian leader Manuel Noriega
from power peacefully in May 1988
through a negotiated settlement. The
Reagan administration rejected the idea
because George Bush, then a candidate
for President, was already known to have
ties to Noriega and could not be seen
making a deal with the drug kingpin.
After Noriega canceled the 1989 Pan
amanian election results that would have
removed him from power, there was a
loud appeal from the Panamanian people
for U.S. help in removing the dictator it
had previously installed. Instead of
removing the dictator, we imposed eco
nomic sanctions that destroyed the
Panamanian economy.
In October 1989, the Bush administra

tion had a chance to painlessly get rid
of Noriega by supporting a coup attempt
that would easily have succeeded with
U.S. help. Again we were useless.
When President Bush finally sent in
troops last month it seemed that our
waiting had been for the best after all.
If we had supported the coup in October,
the civilian government would probably
have been installed, but the Panamanian
military (the PDF) would have remained
intact. The PDF has become a vast engine
of corruption, patronage and oppression
that a civilian government would have
been powerless to dislodge.
President Bush seemed to have in
herited some of former President
Reagan's stumblebum luck. The invasion
routed the entire PDF. Panama could
now be demilitarized and the civilian gov-

Panamanian military. Will we never learn?

ernment could actually run the country.
But this optimism was premature. It
now seems that President Bush is intent
on re-establishing the Panamanian mil
itary. Will we never learn?
In the Philippines, former President
Reagan clearly expressed amenability to
election fraud (Vice President Bush's dec
laration of "love" for former Filipino
leader Ferdinand Marcos' "great democ
racy") and encouraged Marcos to hold

the elections that were his downfall. But
Filipino leader Corazon Aquino has been
harried by the U.S. created and financed
military ever since and is beginning to
look helpless.
In El Salvador, the U.S. created,
trained, organized and financed military
has never submitted to civilian rule. The
"14 generals" have now replaced the "14
families" as the ruling oligarchy. They
have siphoned off enough military aid

and exercised enough corruption that
they now dominate the El Salvadorian
economy. They will never be removed.
In Panama, the PDF, complete with
its dictators Torrijos and Noriega, was
100 percent "made in the USA." The
Panamanian military was created by the
U.S. in 1959, and 10 years later it over
threw the democratically-elected govern
ment of Panama and remained in power
until last month.
Everywhere the story is the same.
What makes President Bush think the
PDF won't take power again? More to
the point, why risk it? What conceivable
reason is there to enrich a corrupt mil
itary that is the only threat to democracy
in Panama?
