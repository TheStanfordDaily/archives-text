The Manson Family. The Hill
side Strangler. The Vampire of
Sacramento. Like banner head
lines on a newspaper's front page,
they are the mass media
cultivated anti-heroes of the last
20 years: the serial murderer, the
sociopath and the homicidal
maniac.
Juries express horror at their
crimes, but the public seems to
have an insatiable appetite for
more details of their grotesque
exploits. What intrigues us so
much about these gruesome
crimes, and why have images of
mutilated bodies become, through
the "slasher" film, routine
slumber-party fare?
In "Alone With the Devil,"
forensic psychiatrist and attorney
Ronald Markman's answer is
simple: We see ourselves reflected
in the Mansons and the
Stranglers, the Jasons and the
Freddies. A Neo-Freudian, Mark
man holds that we are all alone
with our devilish drives and
destructive instincts.
In his disconcerting memoir,
written with journalist Dominick
Bosco, Markman minces few

words and spares even fewer
details as he recounts his experi
ences with some of the most in
famous trials in recent history.
He includes enough bone crunch
ing, head splitting and body man
gling to satisfy the most lurid
tastes, but he manages to sneak
in a hidden agenda, more substan
tial and less sensational. "Alone
With the Devil" is also a thinly
veiled attack on a legal system
whose mind is as "chaotic, disor
dered and cruel as the wildest
killer's."
Violent crime in all its forms —
decapitations, strangulations and
eviscerations — takes center stage
in Markman's book. For example,
in a chapter on the so-called
"Vampire of Sacramento," Rich
ard Chase, Markham describes
how the killer's psychotic nature
and lack of conscience led him to
believe he needed to drink animal
and human blood to survive.
Markman's experiences with
such bloodthirsty killers helped to
form his opinion that the courts
seemed to operate under prin
ciples of irony, not justice. A child,
abused by his mother, appeals to
the court to be separated from
her, but she wins the custody bat
tle; only after he murders her does
the court extend its sympathy to
the original victim. Members of
the Manson family re-enter soci
ety, but filmmaker Roman
Polanski — the husband of one
of their victims — is prohibited

from returning to America after
molesting an adolescent and jump

These and other cases under
score Markman's point, a perhaps
surprising one for a forensic psy
chiatrist: the courts protect
criminals in lieu of victims, rather
than protecting both. By "vic
tims," Markman means not just
the battered wife or the widower,
but also the general public. Soci
ety as a whole, Markman claims,
grows anxious and is driven to
even more violence when
criminals go unpunished.

Markman documents his indi
vidual cases well, but his analysis
is rooted in a curmudgeonly dis
dain for the intricasies of the legal
system. Society may be "bru
talized not by punishing
criminals, but by failing to punish
them." But shouldn't the alleged
criminal receive the same protec
tion as the victim? Markman's im
plicit solution — a sort of Star
Chamber where criminals are
deemed guilty until proven inno
cent — is ultimately more
nightmarish than all the legal
