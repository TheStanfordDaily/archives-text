## 
### Scott Saul Staff writer 
Author and psychiatrist Ronald
Markman had been mugged a few days
earlier: two youths had pressed the
muzzle of a gun to his head and taken
his money.
But Markman seemed remarkably un
fazed as he discussed his latest book,
"Alone With the Devil" at his Beverly
Hills home recently. In his line of work,
that gimlet-eyed confidence is a necessity;
as a courtroom psychiatrist, Markman
analyzes the potentially insane for a
living. His subjects have included mem
bers of the Manson Family, the Hillside
Strangler, Marvin Gay Sr., and his ex
pertise has earned him appearances on
television programs such as "Nightline,"

"Larry King Live" and"The Oprah
Winfrey Show."
In the following excerpts, Markman
discusses his views on the psychological
make-up of the criminal population, his
grievances with the legal system, and his
experiences with the psychotic and the
sociopathic.
Daily: There's been an explosion of
lurid homicide cases in recent years. Why
do there seem to be more sociopaths and
psychotics in the news?
Markman: There seems to be more
because there are more. In our society
weYe fflrdmotlrtg a family disintegration"
Sixty-five percent of children are raise#
in one-parent families. Psychologically
speaking, there's got to be a reason why
children need fathers and mothers.
In years two to seven, kids develop

their conscience. They're trained and so
cialized, they're taught that when you
sit in a sandbox with another person and
he's got something you want, you don't
just grab it because you're stronger.
They're taught that if you don't like
someone, you don't hit him.
If you don't develop a conscience be
tween the ages of two and seven, you
have no internal policeman, no guilt and
you can blow someone away on the street
and not feel any anxiety at all.
Daily: How are these sociopaths able
to get along in our society?
Markman: You can be a sociopath and
succeed in other endeavors. You can go
to Wall Street, you can become a used
car salesman, you can sell encyclopedias.
They're scam artists, and they perform
sociopathic undertakings within the

framework of an acceptable social order.
Daily: But don't we all seem to be
somehow sociopathic?
Markman: I asked a group of people
if they would steal Gucci aftershave or
perfume, if they knew that they wouldn't
be caught. Sixty percent of the people
said they would.
Daily: So are you saying that mur
derers seem, at least on the surface, more
normal?
Markman: If you walk into a jail and
you separate those people who have killed
from tiiose who have committed rape,
arson and other crimes, the people who
committed murder would fit into an
opening at the Music Center if they were
washed, shaved and dressed. The people
who committed other crimes wouldn't.
Murderers cut across all parts of soci

ety and mirror our society more than
other criminals.
Daily: And what are their motivations?
Markman: In every case, I've been in
volved in, the unifying emotioned factor
has not been craziness or rage, it's been
humiliation. Humiliation is the major fac
tor, and the prototype is the story of
Cain and Abel. Was Cain angry fat God
or Abel], or was he humiliated? What
better way to reverse the humiliation
than by demonstrating control over an
other person's life?
Daily: How do you see the relationship
between violent crime and the violentv
on television and the movie screen?
Markman: Everybody tried to amke a
correlation between violence and toy
