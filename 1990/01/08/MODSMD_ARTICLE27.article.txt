# Author Markman analyzes sociopathic behavior, blasts legal system
## 
### Scott Saul Staff writer 
Author and psychiatrist Ronald
Markman had been mugged a few days
earlier: two youths had pressed the
muzzle of a gun to his head and taken
his money.
But Markman seemed remarkably un
fazed as he discussed his latest book,
"Alone With the Devil" at his Beverly
Hills home recently. In his line of work,
that gimlet-eyed confidence is a necessity;
as a courtroom psychiatrist, Markman
analyzes the potentially insane for a
living. His subjects have included mem
bers of the Manson Family, the Hillside
Strangler, Marvin Gay Sr., and his ex
pertise has earned him appearances on
television programs such as "Nightline,"

"Larry King Live" and"The Oprah
Winfrey Show."
In the following excerpts, Markman
discusses his views on the psychological
make-up of the criminal population, his
grievances with the legal system, and his
experiences with the psychotic and the
sociopathic.
Daily: There's been an explosion of
lurid homicide cases in recent years. Why
do there seem to be more sociopaths and
psychotics in the news?
Markman: There seems to be more
because there are more. In our society
weYe fflrdmotlrtg a family disintegration"
Sixty-five percent of children are raise#
in one-parent families. Psychologically
speaking, there's got to be a reason why
children need fathers and mothers.
In years two to seven, kids develop

their conscience. They're trained and so
cialized, they're taught that when you
sit in a sandbox with another person and
he's got something you want, you don't
just grab it because you're stronger.
They're taught that if you don't like
someone, you don't hit him.
If you don't develop a conscience be
tween the ages of two and seven, you
have no internal policeman, no guilt and
you can blow someone away on the street
and not feel any anxiety at all.
Daily: How are these sociopaths able
to get along in our society?
Markman: You can be a sociopath and
succeed in other endeavors. You can go
to Wall Street, you can become a used
car salesman, you can sell encyclopedias.
They're scam artists, and they perform
sociopathic undertakings within the

framework of an acceptable social order.
Daily: But don't we all seem to be
somehow sociopathic?
Markman: I asked a group of people
if they would steal Gucci aftershave or
perfume, if they knew that they wouldn't
be caught. Sixty percent of the people
said they would.
Daily: So are you saying that mur
derers seem, at least on the surface, more
normal?
Markman: If you walk into a jail and
you separate those people who have killed
from tiiose who have committed rape,
arson and other crimes, the people who
committed murder would fit into an
opening at the Music Center if they were
washed, shaved and dressed. The people
who committed other crimes wouldn't.
Murderers cut across all parts of soci

ety and mirror our society more than
other criminals.
Daily: And what are their motivations?
Markman: In every case, I've been in
volved in, the unifying emotioned factor
has not been craziness or rage, it's been
humiliation. Humiliation is the major fac
tor, and the prototype is the story of
Cain and Abel. Was Cain angry fat God
or Abel], or was he humiliated? What
better way to reverse the humiliation
than by demonstrating control over an
other person's life?
Daily: How do you see the relationship
between violent crime and the violentv
on television and the movie screen?
Markman: Everybody tried to amke a
correlation between violence and toy
guns, tanks and G.I. Joe. But
most kids watching "Friday the
13th" and "Halloween" don't do
what Freddy and Jason do.
When I was a kid, we didn't
have Freddy and Jason, but we
had Frankenstein and the
Wolfman. Horror is a necessary
part of the human fantasy life. . . .
I don't think we're any more
violent than any other society. In
England, they have soccer
matches where people get killed
in the stands by the score, and
in South America too.
What manifests our violence so
directly is our freedom. We have
freedom that people in Europe
don't have. They have to show
papers every time they go some
where, and if a bobby in England
asks you for 1.D., he doesn't need

probable cause. In America, Ted
Bundy goes from Washington to
Colorado to Florida, having com
mitted crime after crime after
crime.
Arthur Jackson, who stalked
[actress] Theresa Saldan, was an
undesirable alien. He had been in
this country, had threatened Pres
ident Kennedy's life, and was
deported. He reapplied for a visa
and got it without hassle. He came
to this country and then spent
umpteen weeks looking for
Theresa Saldan, who was a face
he saw in a movie in New York
when he arrived. He was free to
do that.
When you have people who are
anti-social or psychotic in Euro
pean countries, they don't have
the right to walk the streets. Here
they do. They have the right to
refuse treatment, the right to be
crazy. I would say that 60 percent
of the people we call homeless
should be in mental hospitals.

I asked a group of people if they would
steal Gucci aftershave or perfume, if they
knew that they wouldn't be caught. Sixty
percent of the people said they would.

Daily: In "Alone With the
Devil," you argue that the law
protects criminals over victims.
Markman: Absolutely. Having
been a victim less than a week
ago, I can say that the fact that
we bend over backwards to protect
criminals doesn't make our coun
try freer or safer. The lowliest of
the criminals has to have all of
his rights protected. But when his
rights are protected, the streets
aren't protected....
The law says that unless your
life is being threatened at that
moment, you can't use deadly
force. It also requires that there
be no avenue of escape.
There was a case in lowa where

a man had been burglarized re
peatedly, and finally he set up a
trip gun. The same burglar came
in and was shot. The burglar sued
the man and won because the trip
gun was illegal. The burglar was
only found guilty of trespassing,
which is a prostitution of the law
really. It's illogical, it makes little
sense, but lawyers see a lot of
sense in it.
Daily: Many lawyers grumble
about abuse of psychiatric tes
timony. Do psychiatrists abuse the
legal system, or does the legal sys
tem abuse them?
Markman: If you have an issue
that is beyond the lay jury, then
expert testimony is admissable.

We're not infallible like the Pope,
and certainly my diagnoses are
prone to error like anybody else's.
But we are more capable of pro
viding understandable evalua
tions and conclusions that will al
low the trial to deal with complex
issues. ...
Lawyers come in and use psy
chiatrists. Like all other people,
psychiatrists are subject to ma
nipulation, and one of those
manipulations can be financial.
And there are some psychia
trists who will only testify for the
defense. That's like a cancer doc
tor saying "Everybody I examine
has cancer."
Daily: Then how can these
abuses of psychiatric testimony be
controlled?
Markman: If I were a
benevolent dictator, I would not
want the psychiatrist to be an ad
vocate. I think the expert should
be a friend of the court, an un
biased expert.
