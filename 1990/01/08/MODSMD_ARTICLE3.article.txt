# Learning in Legoland
## 35 classes to open in modulars 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Officially they're called
"quake modulars," but Stanford
News Service noted that the
buildings have turned Stanford
into "Legoland."
Three complexes of modular
units — located at Roble Field,
Galvez Mall between Green Li
brary and Crothers Hall, and
the Wilbur Hall parking lot —
will become the temporary home
for between 35 and 40 classes
beginning tomorrow.
Construction workers and
moving crews worked over the
weekend to finish last-minute
work, and Assoc. Registrar Jack
Farrell said workers will "tie up
loose ends" today for the class
rooms.
"Everything should be ready
by Tuesday," Farrell said, ad
mitting that officials may have
to do "some scrambling" to
make that happen.
The units became a needed
temporary fix after the Oct. 17
earthquake displaced about
14,000 square feet of classroom

space, as well as offices for
several departments and pro
grams. Asst. Provost Valerie
Veronin said the units will be
dismantled as repairs are com
pleted at Geology Corner, Lan
guage Corner and Green West.
• The 10,000-square-foot Gal
vez Mall complex will house
seven classrooms and offices for
staff members displaced from
Green Library's west wing.
• Four classrooms will be in
the 22,000-square-foot Roble
Field complex, which will also
be used by the School of Earth
Sciences while Geology Corner
undergoes repairs.
• The Wilbur parking lot
modular will become a new
"Language Corner" with 25,000
square feet of office space for
foreign language departments
displaced from Building 260
Only 8,000 square feet in le
temporary units will be used for
classrooms.
Though the classrooms in the
Galvez and Roble structures will
be ready tomorrow, many of the
offices will not be ready until
later this month. "As we set

priorities, classrooms were at
the top for obvious reasons,"
Farrell said.
Three large classrooms have
fixed theater seating, while the
rest have central seminar tables
with additional seating around
the perimeter. The rooms will
be used more as discussion sec
tions seek meeting space during
the first two weeks of the quar
ter.
The classrooms range in
capacity from 26 to 142 stu
dents.
The Wilbur lot occupants will
move in from mid-January to
early March, as different parts
of that complex are completed.
The University allocated $2
million to $3 million to install
and furnish the temporary fa
cilities, including the cost of
leasing the Roble and Galvez
units. A separate contractor was
hired to move furniture and
other material from the build
ings under repair to the new
structures.

ricated buildings installed at Wil
bur were donated by IBM, which
no longer needed them at their
Cottle Road facility in San Jose.
The value of the donated complex
is estimated at $1 million.
Vietor Construction of Napa
was hired to dismantle the units
and install them on campus. The
IBM units, which were prewired
and plumbed, came in 10-by-30
foot sections that were bolted to
gether end to end and side by side.
Complete with mansard roofs
and lots of windows, the three
building Wilbur temporary com
plex will also feature connecting
walkways, decks and landscaping.
Plywood shear walls connect
the buildings to their foundations,
and 4,000-pound support posts
every 6 feet under the buildings
carry the weight. Additional sup
ports can be added to support
heavier materials.
