Beavers 77, Cardinal 76 OT
Cardinal 58, Ducks 56

In the league opener Friday night the
Cardinal's 18-game home winning
streak was snapped by Oregon State in
a thrilling 77-76 overtime loss as star
guard Gary Payton scored 36 for the
Beavers. Stanford bounced back to
upend Oregon 58-56 at Maples Pavilion
yesterday when guard Kenny Ammann
hit an eight-footer at the buzzer.
The Cardinal needed a win against
the Ducks yesterday to avoid the
prospect of an 0-2 Pac-10 start and the
inside play of Adam Keefe and clutch
play down the stretch gave Stanford the
narrow victory.
Keefe had 15 points in the first half
but Stanford held only a one-point lead
thanks to the play of Oregon point guard
Terrell Brandon. Brandon, a Prop. 48
casualty last season, had nine points
and three assists in the first half to
keep Oregon in the game.
Neither team led by more than four
until a 8-0 Stanford run made it 45-37
with 11 minutes to play. After an ex
change of jumpers, Brandon scored
eight of 10 Oregon points to spark the
begining of a 12-2 run that tied the
game at 51.
Oregon's Kevin Mixon hit a three
pointer to make it 56-54 with 1:38 left

and it began to look like Stanford might
be swept at home over the weekend.
With 1:05 to play, however, forward Des
hon Wingate drew a foul while shooting.
After a Stanford timeout he calmly
stepped to the line and drilled the pair
to tie the game for the seventh time.
"I was pretty much thinking that a
free throw was a free throw," Wingate
said. "I went up there and relaxed. . . .
I wasn't feeling the pressure; I was just
taking them one at a time."
Oregon tried to work the ball around
for a good shot, but Ammann tipped
away a pass from Bob Fife, knocking
it to Keefe with 44 seconds left.
Stanford ran the clock down, calling
timeout with 14 seconds left. The ball
came in to John Patrick, then to Am
mann, then to Wingate on the left
sideline. The Ducks trapped him there
but Wingate found Ammann on the
baseline.
Ammann drove baseline, clutched in
the air and drilled the game-winner. "I
didn't know if it was going in or not,"
he said.
It did, and Stanford upped its record
to 9-2 on the year.
Keefe was high man again for the
Cardinal, scoring 23 points and grabbing
12 rebounds despite a bad cold. "It
didn't bother me in the game," he said.
"What hurt me was after we warmed
up when I came back in to stretch."
Despite the cold, Keefe played all 40
minutes for the first time in his Stan
ford career.
Ammann finished with 11, Wingate
had nine and Andrew Vlahov had 10
points, six rebounds and five assists.
Brandon, who along with center Rich
ard Lucas and forward Keith Reynolds
played the entire way for the Ducks,
finished with 21 points and four assists.
"We finally get rid of Payton and now
Brandon shows up," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "The zone
(defense) saved our bacon. Brandon

looked like he was going to take it and
go with it.
"We played hard. It looked like we
were a little flat but Oregon's a pretty
good team.... That's a big win for us."
Beating 23rd-ranked Oregon State
would have been an even bigger win
but the Cardinal came up just short.
Payton was unstoppable all night as
Patrick, Marcus Lollie and Ammann
took turns guarding him.
He scored the Beavers' first seven
points and 18 in the first half to give
OSU a 36-33 halftime lead.
The lead see-sawed in the second half
but things looked bad for the Cardinal
when Keefe fouled out with 5:24
remaining. It seemed an impossible task
for the team to come back from being
down 57-54 with the team's leading
scorer fouled out and Payton scoring
almost at will.
Center Derek Bruton took it upon
himself to keep the Cardinal in the
game, however. A Bruton dunk cut the
lead to one, and after Payton made a
jumper, Ammann hit a three-pointer
and was fouled.
It appeared he was fouled well after
he released the ball, but the officials
only gave him one shot instead of a
one-and-one. He made the free throw,
then Vlahov converted a three-point play
to put Stanford up by four.
A reserve Oregon State guard named
Allan Celestine then became the latest
in the long line of Cardinal killers. He
hit a pair of free throws to cut it to
two but Bruton responded with a layup.
A Payton jumper brought it back to
two with 1:41 remaining, and a Celes
tine layup with 1:13 to go sent the game
into overtime, tied at 65.
Celestine grabbed the jump ball to
start the overtime, and hit an 18-footer
a minute and a half later to make it
69-67 OSU. Bruton tied it with a layup

and was fouled but Stanford was
unable to take the lead as Bruton
missed the free throw.
Stanford had a second chance
to take the lead but Vlahov missed
the front end of a one-and-one.
Payton hit a jumper for a two
point Beaver lead, then was fouled
25 seconds later. He missed his
front end, but Celestine got the
offensive rebound and got it to
Payton for another jumper.
Vlahov missed another front
end moments later but Stanford
controlled the rebound and
Bruton had a two-handed follow
dunk soon after to cut it to two
with 57 seconds left.
Stanford only had to hold the
Beavers scoreless then hit a shot
to tie the game again but Celestine
got away from Ammann and
Payton found him for an easy
back-door layup.
A Bruton layup cut it to two
with 13 seconds left but Earl Mar
tin hit two free throws with 11
seconds left. Patrick hit a 21-
footer with two defenders in his
face to cut it to one, but Celestine
took the inbounds pass and ran
out the clock.
Keefe had a season-low 11
points before fouling out. Patrick
was 6 of 7 from three-point range
to keep Stanford in the game and
finished with 18. Vlahov had 15
points and 11 rebounds and
Bruton 12, 10 of them after Keefe
fouled out.
In addition to his 36 points,
Payton had a game-high eight as
sists and a team-high seven
rebounds. Celestine had eight, all
in the last eight and a half
minutes of the game.
"We made all of the bad plays
at a time when the game was
there to be won and they took
advantage of it," Montgomery
said. "There were things that
were bright spots but this was a
game we could've, should've
had. . . . It's a reasonably well
played ballgame on our part . . .
but the bottom line is when the
game was there to be won or lost
we didn't make the plays and
Oregon State did."
Both Oregon State and Oregon
pressed almost the entire game
and Stanford never attacked the
press despite having a few chances
at two-on-ones. The cautious at
titude worked well as the Cardinal
rarely lost the ball against the
press, but turnovers in the half
court game really hurt Stanford.
"We're getting used to these
presses," Ammann said. "We've
seen them a lot. We've been pretty
solid this year. . . . We have to
start taking advantage of it more
often."
Stanford travels to Washington
this weekend to face the Huskies
Thursday night and the Washing
ton State Cougars Sunday after
noon.
"I'm afraid the whole conference is
going to be like this."
That is the feeling of basketball Coach
Mike Montgomery after opening Pacific
10 Conference play over the weekend.
After being the bully on the block and
going 15-3 in league play last year, grad

Beavers 77, Cardinal 76 OT
Cardinal 58, Ducks 56

In the league opener Friday night the
Cardinal's 18-game home winning
streak was snapped by Oregon State in
a thrilling 77-76 overtime loss as star
guard Gary Payton scored 36 for the
Beavers. Stanford bounced back to
upend Oregon 58-56 at Maples Pavilion
yesterday when guard Kenny Ammann
hit an eight-footer at the buzzer.
The Cardinal needed a win against
the Ducks yesterday to avoid the
prospect of an 0-2 Pac-10 start and the
inside play of Adam Keefe and clutch
play down the stretch gave Stanford the
narrow victory.
Keefe had 15 points in the first half
but Stanford held only a one-point lead
thanks to the play of Oregon point guard
Terrell Brandon. Brandon, a Prop. 48
casualty last season, had nine points
and three assists in the first half to
keep Oregon in the game.
Neither team led by more than four
until a 8-0 Stanford run made it 45-37
with 11 minutes to play. After an ex
change of jumpers, Brandon scored
eight of 10 Oregon points to spark the
begining of a 12-2 run that tied the
game at 51.
Oregon's Kevin Mixon hit a three
pointer to make it 56-54 with 1:38 left

and it began to look like Stanford might
be swept at home over the weekend.
With 1:05 to play, however, forward Des
hon Wingate drew a foul while shooting.
After a Stanford timeout he calmly
stepped to the line and drilled the pair
to tie the game for the seventh time.
"I was pretty much thinking that a
free throw was a free throw," Wingate
said. "I went up there and relaxed. . . .
I wasn't feeling the pressure; I was just
taking them one at a time."
Oregon tried to work the ball around
for a good shot, but Ammann tipped
away a pass from Bob Fife, knocking
it to Keefe with 44 seconds left.
Stanford ran the clock down, calling
timeout with 14 seconds left. The ball
came in to John Patrick, then to Am
mann, then to Wingate on the left
sideline. The Ducks trapped him there
but Wingate found Ammann on the
baseline.
Ammann drove baseline, clutched in
the air and drilled the game-winner. "I
didn't know if it was going in or not,"
he said.
It did, and Stanford upped its record
to 9-2 on the year.
Keefe was high man again for the
Cardinal, scoring 23 points and grabbing
12 rebounds despite a bad cold. "It
didn't bother me in the game," he said.
"What hurt me was after we warmed
up when I came back in to stretch."
Despite the cold, Keefe played all 40
minutes for the first time in his Stan
ford career.
Ammann finished with 11, Wingate
had nine and Andrew Vlahov had 10
points, six rebounds and five assists.
Brandon, who along with center Rich
ard Lucas and forward Keith Reynolds
played the entire way for the Ducks,
finished with 21 points and four assists.
"We finally get rid of Payton and now
Brandon shows up," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "The zone
(defense) saved our bacon. Brandon

looked like he was going to take it and
go with it.
"We played hard. It looked like we
were a little flat but Oregon's a pretty
good team.... That's a big win for us."
Beating 23rd-ranked Oregon State
would have been an even bigger win
but the Cardinal came up just short.
Payton was unstoppable all night as
Patrick, Marcus Lollie and Ammann
took turns guarding him.
He scored the Beavers' first seven
points and 18 in the first half to give
OSU a 36-33 halftime lead.
The lead see-sawed in the second half
but things looked bad for the Cardinal
when Keefe fouled out with 5:24
remaining. It seemed an impossible task
for the team to come back from being
down 57-54 with the team's leading
scorer fouled out and Payton scoring
almost at will.
Center Derek Bruton took it upon
himself to keep the Cardinal in the
game, however. A Bruton dunk cut the
lead to one, and after Payton made a
jumper, Ammann hit a three-pointer
and was fouled.
It appeared he was fouled well after
he released the ball, but the officials
only gave him one shot instead of a
one-and-one. He made the free throw,
then Vlahov converted a three-point play
to put Stanford up by four.
A reserve Oregon State guard named
Allan Celestine then became the latest

game at 51.
Oregon's Kevin Mixon hit a three
pointer to make it 56-54 with 1:38 left

and it began to look like Stanford might
be swept at home over the weekend.
With 1:05 to play, however, forward Des
hon Wingate drew a foul while shooting.
After a Stanford timeout he calmly
stepped to the line and drilled the pair
to tie the game for the seventh time.
"I was pretty much thinking that a
free throw was a free throw," Wingate
said. "I went up there and relaxed. . . .
I wasn't feeling the pressure; I was just
taking them one at a time."
Oregon tried to work the ball around
for a good shot, but Ammann tipped
away a pass from Bob Fife, knocking
it to Keefe with 44 seconds left.
Stanford ran the clock down, calling
timeout with 14 seconds left. The ball
came in to John Patrick, then to Am
mann, then to Wingate on the left
sideline. The Ducks trapped him there
but Wingate found Ammann on the
baseline.
Ammann drove baseline, clutched in
the air and drilled the game-winner. "I
didn't know if it was going in or not,"
he said.
It did, and Stanford upped its record
to 9-2 on the year.
Keefe was high man again for the
Cardinal, scoring 23 points and grabbing
12 rebounds despite a bad cold. "It
didn't bother me in the game," he said.
"What hurt me was after we warmed
up when I came back in to stretch."
Despite the cold, Keefe played all 40
minutes for the first time in his Stan
ford career.
Ammann finished with 11, Wingate
had nine and Andrew Vlahov had 10
points, six rebounds and five assists.
Brandon, who along with center Rich
ard Lucas and forward Keith Reynolds
played the entire way for the Ducks,
finished with 21 points and four assists.
"We finally get rid of Payton and now
Brandon shows up," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "The zone
(defense) saved our bacon. Brandon

looked like he was going to take it and
go with it.
"We played hard. It looked like we
were a little flat but Oregon's a pretty
good team.... That's a big win for us."
Beating 23rd-ranked Oregon State
would have been an even bigger win
but the Cardinal came up just short.
Payton was unstoppable all night as
Patrick, Marcus Lollie and Ammann
took turns guarding him.
He scored the Beavers' first seven
points and 18 in the first half to give
OSU a 36-33 halftime lead.
The lead see-sawed in the second half
but things looked bad for the Cardinal
when Keefe fouled out with 5:24
remaining. It seemed an impossible task
for the team to come back from being
down 57-54 with the team's leading
scorer fouled out and Payton scoring
almost at will.
Center Derek Bruton took it upon
himself to keep the Cardinal in the
game, however. A Bruton dunk cut the
lead to one, and after Payton made a
jumper, Ammann hit a three-pointer
and was fouled.
It appeared he was fouled well after
he released the ball, but the officials
only gave him one shot instead of a
one-and-one. He made the free throw,
then Vlahov converted a three-point play
to put Stanford up by four.
A reserve Oregon State guard named
Allan Celestine then became the latest
in the long line of Cardinal killers. He
hit a pair of free throws to cut it to
two but Bruton responded with a layup.
A Payton jumper brought it back to
two with 1:41 remaining, and a Celes
tine layup with 1:13 to go sent the game
into overtime, tied at 65.
Celestine grabbed the jump ball to
start the overtime, and hit an 18-footer
a minute and a half later to make it
69-67 OSU. Bruton tied it with a layup

and was fouled but Stanford was
unable to take the lead as Bruton
missed the free throw.
Stanford had a second chance
to take the lead but Vlahov missed
the front end of a one-and-one.
Payton hit a jumper for a two
point Beaver lead, then was fouled
25 seconds later. He missed his
front end, but Celestine got the
offensive rebound and got it to
Payton for another jumper.
Vlahov missed another front
end moments later but Stanford
controlled the rebound and
Bruton had a two-handed follow
dunk soon after to cut it to two
with 57 seconds left.
Stanford only had to hold the
Beavers scoreless then hit a shot
to tie the game again but Celestine
got away from Ammann and
Payton found him for an easy
back-door layup.
A Bruton layup cut it to two
with 13 seconds left but Earl Mar
tin hit two free throws with 11
seconds left. Patrick hit a 21-
footer with two defenders in his
face to cut it to one, but Celestine
took the inbounds pass and ran
out the clock.
Keefe had a season-low 11
points before fouling out. Patrick
was 6 of 7 from three-point range
to keep Stanford in the game and
finished with 18. Vlahov had 15
points and 11 rebounds and
Bruton 12, 10 of them after Keefe
fouled out.
In addition to his 36 points,
Payton had a game-high eight as
sists and a team-high seven
rebounds. Celestine had eight, all
in the last eight and a half
minutes of the game.
"We made all of the bad plays
at a time when the game was
there to be won and they took
advantage of it," Montgomery
said. "There were things that
were bright spots but this was a
game we could've, should've
had. . . . It's a reasonably well
played ballgame on our part . . .
but the bottom line is when the
game was there to be won or lost
we didn't make the plays and
Oregon State did."
Both Oregon State and Oregon
pressed almost the entire game
and Stanford never attacked the
press despite having a few chances
at two-on-ones. The cautious at
titude worked well as the Cardinal
rarely lost the ball against the
press, but turnovers in the half
court game really hurt Stanford.
"We're getting used to these
presses," Ammann said. "We've
seen them a lot. We've been pretty
solid this year. . . . We have to
start taking advantage of it more
often."
Stanford travels to Washington
this weekend to face the Huskies
Thursday night and the Washing
ton State Cougars Sunday after
noon.
