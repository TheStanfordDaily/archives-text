# Card red-hot over break

### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Nineteen eighty-nine was a good year for
the Stanford men's basketball team. The
team spent almost the whole season in the
top 20 and advanced to the NCAA Tour
nament for the first time in 47 years.
After losing six of the squad's top eight
players to graduation, the team appeared
to be headed for a tumble. But so far it
seems success has been more tied to the
calendar year than to the school year as
Stanford completed the nonleague portion
of its schedule, and the 1980s, with an 8-1
record.
The Cardinal played five games between
the end of school and the end of the year,
beginning the day after finals ended.

Maples Pavilion, Dec. 16
The Cardinal ran its record to 5-0 against
the Dons as forwards Adam Keefe and
Deshon Wingate dominated inside. Keefe
was 11 of 12 from the field and Wingate
was 6 of 8 as the two combined for 36
points and 11 rebounds.
The Cardinal continued its trend of
struggling early and guard Shawn Sykes
poured in 19 for the Dons but Stanford
pulled away in the second half.

Guard Kenny Ammann had a season-best
eight assists and freshman guard Marcus
Lollie came off the bench to hit all three
of his shots. The Cardinal outrebounded
the Dons 33-25 and shot .612 from the
field, but had 20 turnovers and was only
l-of-7 from three-point territory in por
tends of problems to come.

SANTA CI.ARA â€” The Cardinal took
its show on the road for the second time
this season and Keefe and Co. handled the
short-handed Broncos after surviving a
scare. Santa Clara was playing without its
starting small forward and point guard due
to injuries and the game looked like it
would be a blowout as the Cardinal opened
up a 12-2 lead. Keefe and point guard John
Patrick had six apiece and SCU couldn't
buy a bucket.
But the Broncos didn't go away. James
Renfro came off the bench to score 10
straight points for Santa Clara, cutting it
to 18-12. Stanford fought back, however,
and took a 15-point lead into the halftime
break.
Six-foot-10 forward Nils Becker hit three
three-pointers, however, and Renfro's
