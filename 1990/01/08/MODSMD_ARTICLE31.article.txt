# Card red-hot over break
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Nineteen eighty-nine was a good year for
the Stanford men's basketball team. The
team spent almost the whole season in the
top 20 and advanced to the NCAA Tour
nament for the first time in 47 years.
After losing six of the squad's top eight
players to graduation, the team appeared
to be headed for a tumble. But so far it
seems success has been more tied to the
calendar year than to the school year as
Stanford completed the nonleague portion
of its schedule, and the 1980s, with an 8-1
record.
The Cardinal played five games between
the end of school and the end of the year,
beginning the day after finals ended.
Stanford 74, USF 5.3
Maples Pavilion, Dec. 16
The Cardinal ran its record to 5-0 against
the Dons as forwards Adam Keefe and
Deshon Wingate dominated inside. Keefe
was 11 of 12 from the field and Wingate
was 6 of 8 as the two combined for 36
points and 11 rebounds.
The Cardinal continued its trend of
struggling early and guard Shawn Sykes
poured in 19 for the Dons but Stanford
pulled away in the second half.

Guard Kenny Ammann had a season-best
eight assists and freshman guard Marcus
Lollie came off the bench to hit all three
of his shots. The Cardinal outrebounded
the Dons 33-25 and shot .612 from the
field, but had 20 turnovers and was only
l-of-7 from three-point territory in por
tends of problems to come.
Stanford 66, Santa Clara 51
Toso Pavilion, Dec. 18
SANTA CI.ARA — The Cardinal took
its show on the road for the second time
this season and Keefe and Co. handled the
short-handed Broncos after surviving a
scare. Santa Clara was playing without its
starting small forward and point guard due
to injuries and the game looked like it
would be a blowout as the Cardinal opened
up a 12-2 lead. Keefe and point guard John
Patrick had six apiece and SCU couldn't
buy a bucket.
But the Broncos didn't go away. James
Renfro came off the bench to score 10
straight points for Santa Clara, cutting it
to 18-12. Stanford fought back, however,
and took a 15-point lead into the halftime
break.
Six-foot-10 forward Nils Becker hit three
three-pointers, however, and Renfro's
jumper made it 51-48 Stanford with 6:33
left. But with the crowd getting back into
the game, the Cardinal finished off the
Broncos with a 15-1 run, holding SCU with
out a basket until the final second of the
game.
Keefe, the Pacific 10 Conference's Player
of the Week following the USF game, con
tinued his outstanding play, scoring 24 and
pulling down 13 boards. Patrick finished
with 13 points and six assists and center
Derek Bruton went 3-for-4 from the field
for the second straight night.
The Cardinal received two votes in the
Associated Press poll released that day, the
team's first appearence in the poll this
season.
Stanford 77, Colgate 66
Maples Pavilion, Dec. 22
When 0-6 Colgate came to play 6-0 Stan
ford, everybody expected a blowout. Every
body was wrong, however, as in the first
half the Red Raiders rarely seemed to miss,
and when they did they usually got the
rebound.
Colgate took a 32-31 lead into the locker
room after 20 minutes and had out
rebounded the Cardinal 16-12. It was still
a two-point game with four and a half
minutes left but the Cardinal pulled away
at the end.
Keefe hit a career-high in points for the
third straight game, scoring 32, and pulled
down 12 rebounds. Ammann chipped in 14
points and Stanford had a season-low nine
turnovers. Colgate hit 10 three-pointers in
19 tries and became the first team to out
rebound the Cardinal, doing so by a 32-31
margin.
Stanford 70, Missouri-KC 50
Kemper Arena, Dec. 29
The Cardinal was up to 45th in the AP
poll with 11 votes and went to the BMA
Holiday Classic looking to improve on its
7-0 record. And for the first time since the
season opener against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, the Cardinal opened up a big
halftime lead and was never threatened.
Keefe had 14 points and nine boards in
the first half as Stanford outshot the Kan
garoos 54 percent to 31 percent. The Car
dinal continued to gradually pull away
throughout the second half as UMKC never
got closer than 12.
Keefe finished with 20 points and 12
rebounds to again lead the team in both
categories and center Langtry Meyer came
off the bench to yank down nine rebounds.
The only bad news was that Stanford com
mitted 19 turnovers but Stanford's 49-31
rebounding advantage and the Roos' 29-

The team's record is a
surprise to some, but Stan
ford has proven itself so far.

of outside shooting, but

season play.

start since 1953-54.
No. 2 Kansas 83, Stanford 61
Kemper Arena, Dec. 30
After winning eight straight games the
Cardinal finally had a big challenge. The
Jayhawks defeated the No. 1 and No. 2
teams in the nation back-to-back earlier in
the season and were one of only 10 unde
feated teams in the country, along with
Stanford.
Sixteen and a half minutes into the game
forward Andrew Vlahov threw an alley-oop
pass to Keefe for a slam and Stanford
trailed the No. 2 team in the nation by
two, 28-26. That was as good as it would
get for Stanford, however, as turnovers and
cold outside shooting did in the Cardinal.
The Jayhawks closed the half on a 12-2
run and Stanford never got back in the
game.
The Jayhawks were masters of execution,
running their offense to perfection and
proving they are probably the best passing
team in the nation. Their defense wasn't
bad either, forcing 28 turnovers.
No, that wasn't a misprint. Forced, un
forced, apple or cinnamon, turnovers
prevented the Cardinal from closing the
gap. Stanford outrebounded Kansas 37-29
and forced 18 turnovers themselves, but it
was not enough to unseat the country's
second-best team.
Keefe finished with 20 points and nine
boards, Ammann had 12 and Vlahov had
11 for the Cardinal with Keefe and Vlahov
making the all-tournament team.
Kevin Pritchard and JefT Gueldner had
15 each for Kansas and three other players
were in double figures.
Stanford thus took an 8-1 record into
the start of Pacific 10 Conference play over
the weekend. The team's record is a
surprise to some but Stanford has proven
itself so far. The big problems have been
turnovers and a lack of outside shooting,
but improvement in these areas will make
the Cardinal a definite contender for post

The Cardinal played five games between
the end of school and the end of the year,
beginning the day after finals ended.
Stanford 74, USF 5.3
Maples Pavilion, Dec. 16
The Cardinal ran its record to 5-0 against
the Dons as forwards Adam Keefe and
Deshon Wingate dominated inside. Keefe
was 11 of 12 from the field and Wingate
was 6 of 8 as the two combined for 36
points and 11 rebounds.
The Cardinal continued its trend of
struggling early and guard Shawn Sykes
poured in 19 for the Dons but Stanford
pulled away in the second half.

Guard Kenny Ammann had a season-best
eight assists and freshman guard Marcus
Lollie came off the bench to hit all three
of his shots. The Cardinal outrebounded
the Dons 33-25 and shot .612 from the
field, but had 20 turnovers and was only
l-of-7 from three-point territory in por
tends of problems to come.
Stanford 66, Santa Clara 51
Toso Pavilion, Dec. 18
SANTA CI.ARA — The Cardinal took
its show on the road for the second time
this season and Keefe and Co. handled the
short-handed Broncos after surviving a
scare. Santa Clara was playing without its
starting small forward and point guard due
to injuries and the game looked like it
would be a blowout as the Cardinal opened
up a 12-2 lead. Keefe and point guard John
Patrick had six apiece and SCU couldn't
buy a bucket.
But the Broncos didn't go away. James
Renfro came off the bench to score 10
straight points for Santa Clara, cutting it
to 18-12. Stanford fought back, however,
and took a 15-point lead into the halftime
break.
Six-foot-10 forward Nils Becker hit three
three-pointers, however, and Renfro's
jumper made it 51-48 Stanford with 6:33
left. But with the crowd getting back into
the game, the Cardinal finished off the
Broncos with a 15-1 run, holding SCU with
out a basket until the final second of the
game.
Keefe, the Pacific 10 Conference's Player
of the Week following the USF game, con
tinued his outstanding play, scoring 24 and
pulling down 13 boards. Patrick finished
with 13 points and six assists and center
Derek Bruton went 3-for-4 from the field
for the second straight night.
The Cardinal received two votes in the
Associated Press poll released that day, the
team's first appearence in the poll this
season.
Stanford 77, Colgate 66
Maples Pavilion, Dec. 22
When 0-6 Colgate came to play 6-0 Stan
ford, everybody expected a blowout. Every
body was wrong, however, as in the first
half the Red Raiders rarely seemed to miss,
and when they did they usually got the
rebound.
Colgate took a 32-31 lead into the locker
room after 20 minutes and had out
rebounded the Cardinal 16-12. It was still
a two-point game with four and a half
minutes left but the Cardinal pulled away
at the end.
Keefe hit a career-high in points for the
third straight game, scoring 32, and pulled
down 12 rebounds. Ammann chipped in 14
points and Stanford had a season-low nine
turnovers. Colgate hit 10 three-pointers in
19 tries and became the first team to out
rebound the Cardinal, doing so by a 32-31
margin.
Stanford 70, Missouri-KC 50
Kemper Arena, Dec. 29
The Cardinal was up to 45th in the AP
poll with 11 votes and went to the BMA
Holiday Classic looking to improve on its
7-0 record. And for the first time since the
season opener against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, the Cardinal opened up a big
halftime lead and was never threatened.
Keefe had 14 points and nine boards in
the first half as Stanford outshot the Kan
garoos 54 percent to 31 percent. The Car
dinal continued to gradually pull away
throughout the second half as UMKC never
got closer than 12.
Keefe finished with 20 points and 12
rebounds to again lead the team in both
categories and center Langtry Meyer came
off the bench to yank down nine rebounds.
The only bad news was that Stanford com

No. 2 Kansas 83, Stanford 61
Kemper Arena, Dec. 30
After winning eight straight games the
Cardinal finally had a big challenge. The
Jayhawks defeated the No. 1 and No. 2
teams in the nation back-to-back earlier in
the season and were one of only 10 unde
feated teams in the country, along with
Stanford.
Sixteen and a half minutes into the game
forward Andrew Vlahov threw an alley-oop
pass to Keefe for a slam and Stanford
trailed the No. 2 team in the nation by
two, 28-26. That was as good as it would
get for Stanford, however, as turnovers and
cold outside shooting did in the Cardinal.
The Jayhawks closed the half on a 12-2
run and Stanford never got back in the
game.
The Jayhawks were masters of execution,
running their offense to perfection and
proving they are probably the best passing
team in the nation. Their defense wasn't
bad either, forcing 28 turnovers.
No, that wasn't a misprint. Forced, un
forced, apple or cinnamon, turnovers
prevented the Cardinal from closing the
gap. Stanford outrebounded Kansas 37-29
and forced 18 turnovers themselves, but it
was not enough to unseat the country's
second-best team.
Keefe finished with 20 points and nine
boards, Ammann had 12 and Vlahov had
11 for the Cardinal with Keefe and Vlahov
making the all-tournament team.
Kevin Pritchard and JefT Gueldner had
15 each for Kansas and three other players
were in double figures.
Stanford thus took an 8-1 record into
the start of Pacific 10 Conference play over
the weekend. The team's record is a
surprise to some but Stanford has proven
itself so far. The big problems have been
turnovers and a lack of outside shooting,
but improvement in these areas will make
the Cardinal a definite contender for post
