# Swimmers slaughter Santa Barbara
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Displaying the depth expected of a
national power, the Stanford men's
swim team defeated UC-Santa Bar
bara handily at deGuerre Pool Satur
day.
Nine Stanford swimmers won
events in the meet which was
dominated by the home team. The
final score was 89-32 but would have
been 104-17 as all the Cardinal
entrants in the last two events were
entered as "unofficial" swimmers.
The meet came following a week
and a half of two-a-day Christmas
training sessions and raised the third
ranked Cardinal's record to 2-0. The
other dual-meet victory was a 67-46
decision over top-ranked Texas Nov.
11.
"This is the first time we've had a
meet during Christmas training,"
Coach Skip Kenney said. "I didn't
know what to expect. I'm very, very
pleased with the way we swam. In
the middle of the type of training
we've done, we swam really well."

Freshman Brad Budney won both
the 100-yard and the 200 butterflies
to lead Stanford to the win. Sopho
more Alex Kostich won the 1000 free
style and recorded the fastest time in
the 400 individual medley but was
listed as unofficial.
Two other freshmen won events for
the Cardinal as J.J. Freitag won the
100 breaststroke and Erik Maurer
won the 100 freestyle. Maurer also
swam the anchor leg of the unofficial
200 freestyle relay team. He followed
John Witchel, Doug Lillydahl and Jeff
Garr and pulled away convincingly at
the end.
Stanford also won the 200 medley
relay with Rick Gould, Freitag, Jeff
Rouse and Garr swimming the four
legs.
The other winners for Stanford
were J.B. Barr in the 200 freestyle,

Gould in the 100 backstroke, Witchel
in the 50 freestyle, Ken Brakebill in
the 200 breaststroke and Lunn Lus
tina in the 500 freestyle.
Kenney used the meet as a training
exercise and held some of the team's
stars out of their strongest events and
tried to put some of his other swim
mers in position to win events.
"We just have to give the people at
that level the chance to feel they can
win," he said. "That's the only way
we can beat Texas (at the NCAA
Championships).
"We also gave our individual medley
swimmers a chance to race in their
weakest stroke. It's one thing to train
in your weakest stroke but it's another
to race in it. This will really help their
IMs."
The Cardinal will compete in two
two-day meets this weekend, traveling
to Ann Arbor for the Michigan Invi
tational Friday and Saturday and
going to the Cal Invitational across
the Bay Saturday through Monday.
