Cardinal 85
Lady Vols 71

After their Dec. 15 victory over
Tennessee, though, the members
of the Stanford women's basket
ball team can now be regarded as
legitimate contenders for the na
tional championship.
The 85-71 thrashing of the
Lady Vols, winners of two of the
past three NCAA tournaments,
was the highlight of a busy Christ
mas break for the Cardinal as the
team raced to an 11-0 start in
cluding two Pac-10 wins.
Even before the tipoff of the
showdown with Tennessee, it was
clear the game was a special event.
All three local network affiliates
were at Maples Pavilion for
pregame interviews with Coach
Tara VanDerveer. A crowd offi
cially listed at 5,425 — though it
was clearly over 6,000 — showed
up for what may have been the
biggest women's sporting event
ever held in the Bay Area.

The attendance smashed the
previous Stanford women's bas
ketball record of 3,600.
The Cardinal didn't disappoint
the home fans. With just over 12
minutes remaining in the first
half, freshman Val Whiting was
fouled while making a basket. She
missed the free throw but Katy
Steding came down with the re
bound and passed off to Sor\ja
Henning, who then drilled a three
pointer.
Henning's basket gave the Car
dinal a 22-12 lead and forced the
Lady Vols to call a timeout. What
ever Tennessee Coach Pat Sum
mitt told her troops seemed to
work. The Lady Vols reeled off
an 8-0 run to pull within two.
But the Cardinal held together
and moved back on top 32-24 on
a fast-break layup by Whiting
with 3:21 to play in the half. Again
the Lady Vols called a timeout.
This time Stanford held onto most
of its lead and headed for the
locker room with a 38-31 edge.
The defending champs were
down, but they weren't yet out.
The Lady Vols got two hoops for
every Stanford one to start the
second half and pulled to 45-41.
Tennessee center Daedra Charles
then drew a foul while burying a
6-footer on the baseline. She con
verted the free throw to pull the
Lady Vols within one at 45-44.
Stanford came back strong,
however, as Henning, who
finished with a game-high 23
points, keyed the Cardinal attack
from the point guard position and

'We hadn't really
beaten anybody
that big. It'll really
be a challenge for
us to keep improv
ing from here.'
— Tara VanDerveer

contributed to the scoring as well.
With the Cardinal ahead 67-58
and 5:24 to play, Trisha Stevens
scored to open the lead to 11.
Following a Tennessee turnover,
Stevens scored again. The Lady
Vols missed a shot on their next
possession.
With 4:22 left Stanford came
down again, Jennifer Aizi hit a
three-pointer and the game was
essentially over as Stanford led
74-58. The Lady Vols called a
timeout, the crowd went bananas
and Stanford went on to salt away
its watershed victory over Ten
nessee.
"We hadn't really beaten
anybody that big," VanDerveer
said afterward. "It'll really be a
challenge for us to keep improving
from here."

Last Tuesday, the Cardinal
downed USF at Maples. And fi

with triumphs at Oregon State
Friday and Oregon yesterday.
Against the Ducks, Stanford
was led by Steding with 21 points
and Azzi with 19 as the squad
scored a 76-57 win at McArthur
Court. Though Stanford couldn't
contain the Webfoots' 6-foot-7
center Stefanie Kasperski, who
finished with 23 points on 11-of
-21 shooting, the Cardinal held the
Ducks to 30 percent shooting from
the field.
Vonda Anderson (3 of 16) and
Vanessa Selden (2 of 10) were the
biggest culprits in Oregon's blank
shooting spree.
Azzi is leading Stanford with
an average of over 16 points per
game with Steding a close second.
Whiting and Julie Zeilstra join Az
zi, Stevens and Steding with
double-figure scoring averages.
Henning is the Cardinal's only
starter scoring in the single digits.
She is, however, chipping in seven

But the Cardinal held together
and moved back on top 32-24 on
a fast-break layup by Whiting
with 3:21 to play in the half. Again
the Lady Vols called a timeout.
This time Stanford held onto most
of its lead and headed for the
locker room with a 38-31 edge.
The defending champs were
down, but they weren't yet out.
The Lady Vols got two hoops for
every Stanford one to start the
second half and pulled to 45-41.
Tennessee center Daedra Charles
then drew a foul while burying a
6-footer on the baseline. She con
verted the free throw to pull the
Lady Vols within one at 45-44.
Stanford came back strong,
however, as Henning, who
finished with a game-high 23
points, keyed the Cardinal attack
from the point guard position and

With the Cardinal ahead 67-58

scored to open the lead to 11.
Following a Tennessee turnover,
Stevens scored again. The Lady
Vols missed a shot on their next
possession.
With 4:22 left Stanford came
down again, Jennifer Aizi hit a
three-pointer and the game was
essentially over as Stanford led
74-58. The Lady Vols called a
timeout, the crowd went bananas

its watershed victory over Ten

Last Tuesday, the Cardinal
downed USF at Maples. And fi
nally, Stanford opened league play
with triumphs at Oregon State
Friday and Oregon yesterday.
Against the Ducks, Stanford
was led by Steding with 21 points
and Azzi with 19 as the squad
scored a 76-57 win at McArthur
Court. Though Stanford couldn't
contain the Webfoots' 6-foot-7
center Stefanie Kasperski, who
finished with 23 points on 11-of
-21 shooting, the Cardinal held the
Ducks to 30 percent shooting from
the field.
Vonda Anderson (3 of 16) and
Vanessa Selden (2 of 10) were the
biggest culprits in Oregon's blank
shooting spree.
Azzi is leading Stanford with
an average of over 16 points per
game with Steding a close second.
Whiting and Julie Zeilstra join Az
zi, Stevens and Steding with
double-figure scoring averages.
Henning is the Cardinal's only
starter scoring in the single digits.
She is, however, chipping in seven
assists per game.
They were ranked No. 1 in the
preseason by Sports Illustrated.
They could boast of possessing
some of the top talent in the na

Pacific 10 Conference champions
after going undefeated through
league play last year.

Cardinal 85
Lady Vols 71

After their Dec. 15 victory over
Tennessee, though, the members
of the Stanford women's basket
ball team can now be regarded as
legitimate contenders for the na
tional championship.
The 85-71 thrashing of the
Lady Vols, winners of two of the
past three NCAA tournaments,
was the highlight of a busy Christ
mas break for the Cardinal as the
team raced to an 11-0 start in
cluding two Pac-10 wins.
Even before the tipoff of the
showdown with Tennessee, it was
clear the game was a special event.
All three local network affiliates
were at Maples Pavilion for
pregame interviews with Coach
Tara VanDerveer. A crowd offi
cially listed at 5,425 — though it
was clearly over 6,000 — showed
up for what may have been the
biggest women's sporting event
ever held in the Bay Area.

The attendance smashed the
previous Stanford women's bas
ketball record of 3,600.
The Cardinal didn't disappoint
the home fans. With just over 12
minutes remaining in the first
half, freshman Val Whiting was
fouled while making a basket. She
missed the free throw but Katy
Steding came down with the re
bound and passed off to Sor\ja
Henning, who then drilled a three
pointer.
Henning's basket gave the Car
dinal a 22-12 lead and forced the
Lady Vols to call a timeout. What
ever Tennessee Coach Pat Sum
mitt told her troops seemed to
work. The Lady Vols reeled off
an 8-0 run to pull within two.
But the Cardinal held together
and moved back on top 32-24 on
a fast-break layup by Whiting
