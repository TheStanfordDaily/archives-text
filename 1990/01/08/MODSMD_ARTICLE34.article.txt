WESTWOOD, Calif. — Closing
a season of frustration and mis
fortune with perhaps the most
frustrating match of all, the Stan
ford women's volleyball team fell
to Wyoming in the semifinals of
the NCAA West Regional Dec. 8.
The eighth-ranked Cardinal
lost 15-6, 3-15, 10-15, 15-12, 15-11
to the 18th-ranked Cowgirls in
Pauley Pavilion. Wyoming lost to
UCLA the next night.
Long Beach State defeated Ne
braska to win the national title a
week later.

"I'm disappointed," Coach Don
Shaw said. "I didn't think we
played very well."
Stanford was out of it in the
first game, losing it quickly and
decisively. But the Cardinal
rebounded to trounce the Cow
girls in the second and third
games.
Stanford had an 11-10 lead in
the fourth game but couldn't hold
on as Wyoming came back to win
15-12 to even the match at two
games each.
At this point deja vu set in. In
the same round of the playoffs,
in the same gym, Stanford played
Washington last year. Like the
Cowgirls, Washington was ranked
18th a year ago. The Huskies won
the first game but Stanford came
back to win the next two 15-3,
15-9.
The Cardinal was close but
came up short in the fourth game
in 1988 and then lost the fifth
game as well.
History repeated itself last
month as game five went back
and forth. The Cardinal took a
9-7 lead but a kill by Tyree Leut
hauser made it 9-8. A block tied
the score, then a few minutes later
Leuthauser served up an ace. An
other ace made it 11-9 and left

people scrathing their heads as to
where Leuthauser came from.
The freshman did not start the
match but was sent in as a sub
for Darcy Cudaback. Cudaback, a
second-team All-American,
finished among the national
leaders in kills for the season but
was pulled for being ineffective.
Leuthauser was certainly effec
tive, rallying Wyoming to within
four points of a big upset. Stan
ford came back to tie it at 11,
however, and appeared to have
momentum.
Unlike Cardinal teams of the
past, however, this year's Stanford
squad had no experienced veter
ans to take over the match. Senior
setter Lara Asper had been out
since the beginning of the year
with a back injury and while
senior captain Laura Olesen kept
swinging away, no one else on the
Cardinal seemed to have the con
fidence necessary to upend the
inspired Cowgirls.
Wyoming continued to dig
nearly every ball in sight and took
a 13-11 lead. It was nearly 14-11
when Leuthauser crushed a ball
that Cheryl Conly managed to dig.
She deflected it right back to a
surprised Leuthauser who swung
again, sending the ball just long.
Stanford couldn't capitalize,
however, and a side out later Leut
hauser got a kill to make it 14-11.
Second-team All-American Kris
tin Klein got a side out for the
Cardinal with a kill, but Erin Can
tacessi returned the favor with a
deep shot that landed on the line.
Facing match point No. 2,
Carrie Feldman again set to Klein
but Cantacessi and Dailene Glenn
blocked her for the match.
Stanford ended the season 18-
12, marking the first time Stan
ford failed to win 20 in a season
in the '80s. The Cardinal ended
up the year by going 10-10 over
its last 20 matches while the win
over Stanford was Wyoming's
24th in 25 matches.
"Wyoming's a good team but all
they did was hang in there long
enough to let us beat ourselves,"
Shaw said. "They made some
great plays at the end.
