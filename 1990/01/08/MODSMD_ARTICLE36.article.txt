### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
After a week and a half of gruel
ing two-a-day training sessions,
the Stanford women's swim team
needed a break.
Fortunately, that's just what
the team got Saturday. The team
took off from training long enough
to swim its first dual meet of the
season and overwhelmed UC-
Santa Barbara 108-13 at deGuerre
Pool.

Women's Swimming

Cardinal 108
Gauchos 13

Freshman Janel Jorgensen and
senior co-captains Jill Johnson
and Susannah Miller won two
events each and the Cardinal held
the Gauchos to no firsts, one sec
ond and three thirds.
"We've all done significant
things in training and we saw
some significant swims in the
meet by some people," Coach
Richard Quick said. "I'm pleased
with where we are."
The defending NCAA cham
pions' first dual meet of the

season marked the home debut of
four Cardinal freshmen. Jorgen
sen, a butterflier and sprint free
styler, made her debut by winning
the 200-yard and 500 freestyles
and swimming the anchor leg of
the victorious 200 medley relay.
Also making her debut was
Janet Evans, the nation's most
highly-sought recruit. Evans, the
world record-holder in the 400-
meter, 800-meter and 1500-meter
freestyles, won the 1000 freestyle
by nearly 28 seconds in her first
race at deGuerre. She missed the
school record by .51 seconds after
nearly 10 minutes of swimming.
Evans also placed second in the
200 butterfly and third in the 200
breaststroke.
Palo Alto native Katherine
Comanor scored in both the 1000
freestyle and the 200 backstroke
in her first collegiate meet and
international-caliber backstroker
Anne Mahoney placed fourth in
both backstroke events in her
deGuerre debut.
Johnson and Miller, two of the
Cardinal's most consistent scorers
over the past three years, did their
share as well, leading the
youngsters by example.
Johnson, the NCAA runner-up

in both breaststroke events last
year, won the 100 breaststroke
and the 400 individual medley
while Miller won both the 100
freestyle and the 100 backstroke.
Stanford's only other senior
swimmer, Bethanne Lambert,
also fared well. After missing the
end of last season due to an injury,
she started 1990 by winning the
200 breaststroke and almost qual
ifying for the NCAA meet in the
process.
Other winners for the Cardinal
were Barb Metz in the 200 but
terfly, Jamie Rugless in the 50
freestyle, Dede Trimble in the 200
backstroke and Suzy Buckovich in
the 100 butterfly.
Miller, J.T. Toten, Buckovich
and Jorgensen led a Stanford
sweep in the 200 medley relay
and Michelle Griglione, Metz, Mi
chelle David and Karen Kraemer
won the 200 freestyle relay.
Stanford travels to the Michi
gan Invitational this weekend in
Ann Arbor, then swims dual meets
at USC and UCLA the following
weekend. The next home meets
are combined men's and women's
meets against Arizona State and
Arizona Jan. 26 and 27.
