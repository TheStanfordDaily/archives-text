# NCAA pledges return to academics

DALLAS (AP) — NCAA executive di
rector Dick Schultz said yesterday that
the $1 billion in television revenue to
be derived from the Division I basketball
tournament offers a unique opportunity
to reform college athletics.
Schultz told about 2,000 delegates at
the NCAA's 84th annual convention
that the organization and its members
need to change their focus.
"Let's go back to playing for the
trophy, eliminate the incentives to break
rules because of dollars," Schultz said.
"Let's eliminate the comment about the
$300,000 free throw. Let's reward in
tegrity, quality education and good grad
uation rates."
"We have a unique opportunity with
this new contract that we cannot afford
to waste," Schultz added. "It is impor
tant that we have student-athletes, not
athlete-students. Education is our busi
ness and must come first."
The NCAA's Executive Committee
will offer a plan in August for distribut

ing the $1 billion that CBS will pay for
to show the Division I championships
over the next seven seasons.
Schultz urged passage of the four
m£yor reform questions to be voted on
Monday:
• Whether to disclose what percentage
of each college's athletes graduate.
• Whether to cut spring football prac
tice in half, wnth no contact drills, as
well as slice the basketball season by
three games to 25, reduce preseason
practice by a month and curtail
preseason tournaments.
• Whether to increase penalties for
drug use, including steroids, and insti
tute year-round testing.
• Whether to alter or delay for one
year Proposition 42, which beginning
Aug. 1 will deny scholarship money to
in-coming athletes who don't meet two
academic requirements. Proposition 48
requires a C-average in 11 core high
school courses and minimum scores on
standardized college entrance exams.

Currently, students who meet one of the
two requirements still can receive ath
letic scholarships, although they are not
eligible for practice or competition.
Proposition 42, which prompted
Georgetown basketball coach John
Thompson to boycott two games last
season after its approval, is expected to
be revised, NCAA president A 1 Witte
said.
One proposal, supported by the NCAA
Presidents Committee, would still make
the student who can only meet one of
the two Proposition 48 requirements
ineligible for athletic scholarship money,
but would let those "partial qualifiers"
gain scholarships under regular non
athletic financial aid programs.
Another proposal would delay the
scholarship cutoff for one year while
studies on the impact of Proposition 48
continue. A third proposal, not given
much chance of passage, would repeal
Proposition 42 completely.
