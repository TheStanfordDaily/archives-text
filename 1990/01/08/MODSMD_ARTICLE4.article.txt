# Longevity raises expectations, Kennedy says

Now in his 10th year as Stanford's president,
Donald Kennedy said he believes people see him as
a "fixture."
"Being new in a job causes people to look else
where for solutions. Now, people expect more of
me," he explained.
These increased expectations have brought about
misunderstandings about exactly what role the pres
ident of the University plays â€” what he can and
cannot, and will and will not, do, Kennedy said in
a recent interview with The Daily.
This year, he is aiming to clear up some of those
misunderstandings.
"The students and faculty see the president as a
chief executive officer, like that of a corporation,
but a lot of the most vital decisions in the University,
those close to the heart of academic matters, are
decisions that faculty make," Kennedy said.
"Students are responsible for most, if not all, of
the student conduct legislation and its enforcement,"
he added. "It's a very democratic place."
That is not to say that Kennedy does not make
decisions critical to Stanford on a daily basis. He
must "invest money, make budgets, reach policy
decisions on how to pay for things, deploy revenue
and take care of the physical planning" of the Uni
versity, he explained.
In addition to acting as "steward" of the physical
aspects of campus, Kennedy said he considers him
self "a protector of the values, the reputation and
the sense of adventure" that make Stanford what

feels increased expectations have led to misunderstandings about
the scope of his job. He hopes to clear up some of those misun
derstandings this year.
