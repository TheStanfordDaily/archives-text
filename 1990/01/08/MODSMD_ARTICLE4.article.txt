# Longevity raises expectations, Kennedy says
## 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
Now in his 10th year as Stanford's president,
Donald Kennedy said he believes people see him as
a "fixture."
"Being new in a job causes people to look else
where for solutions. Now, people expect more of
me," he explained.
These increased expectations have brought about
misunderstandings about exactly what role the pres
ident of the University plays — what he can and
cannot, and will and will not, do, Kennedy said in
a recent interview with The Daily.
This year, he is aiming to clear up some of those
misunderstandings.
"The students and faculty see the president as a
chief executive officer, like that of a corporation,
but a lot of the most vital decisions in the University,
those close to the heart of academic matters, are
decisions that faculty make," Kennedy said.
"Students are responsible for most, if not all, of
the student conduct legislation and its enforcement,"
he added. "It's a very democratic place."
That is not to say that Kennedy does not make
decisions critical to Stanford on a daily basis. He
must "invest money, make budgets, reach policy
decisions on how to pay for things, deploy revenue
and take care of the physical planning" of the Uni
versity, he explained.
In addition to acting as "steward" of the physical
aspects of campus, Kennedy said he considers him
self "a protector of the values, the reputation and
the sense of adventure" that make Stanford what

Following 10 years on the job, University President Donald Kennedy
feels increased expectations have led to misunderstandings about
the scope of his job. He hopes to clear up some of those misun
derstandings this year.
it is.
It is important to express Stan
ford's values to outside groups
such as government agencies,
alumni and donors and to "also
remind people inside (the Univer
sity) of the values they share,"
he said.
One particular value, that of a
commitment to multicultural ed
ucation, has caused Kennedy to
be involved in the past few years
in issues that he sees as lying
outside his jurisdiction.
"For some great issues that
have put the University in the
glare of national attention, like
the conversion from Western Cul
ture to [Cultures, Ideas and
Values], responsibility lies with
the faculty, not with the presi
dent," Kennedy said.
He added that he believes a
"failure to recognize certain is
sues as faculty issues" partly
caused the takeover of Building
10 last May.
"I think that, in part, the de
cision to occupy my office was a
misapprehension of presidential
authority. Many of the issues the
Students of Color Coalition put
forth are not the kind that can

be decided by a central authority,"
Kennedy said.
According to Kennedy, his role
as president was again misjudged
this year when students and
others asked him to intervene in
the case of junior Louis Jackson,
who had been charged with bat
tery and inciting to riot, among
other charges, for his participa
tion in the May takeover.
Kennedy said that such an in
tervention was "not in Stanford's
interest" because it would "es
tablish a precedent that would
present enormous problems for
my successors."
He added, "I knew it was inap
propriate to ask [the district at
torney] to drop the charges, and
he knew I knew. The only thing
he would have learned was that
I wasn't being true to my prin
ciples."
In order to help avoid misun
derstandings about presidential
power, Kennedy said he and
others in the University are "all
making a bigger effort to explain
how things are done," stressing
the importance of committees and
other decision-making bodies.
However, "you can't give a lec
ture on the way things work and
expect people to listen. You have
to say to them, 'Here's a goal that
you have and here's what you

have to do to get there,' " he
added.
Kennedy plays other roles out
side the University, as well. He
explained that sometimes he feels
the need to take a public position
on issues beyond the campus per
sonally — not just as president of
a university.
It is, however, impossible to just
make a disclaimer detatching him
self from the University, he added.
"Essentially, the president can
never take off all of his clothes
as president. I've been at Stanford
for 30 years and have been pres-

ident for 10. I can take off a lot
of clothes, and I'll still be wearing
Cardinal red underwear under
neath," he said.
In deciding when to speak per
sonally on issues, Kennedy said
he uses two guidelines.
In one case, he speaks on issues
"not . . . completely unconnected
to Stanford," issues related spe
cifically to Stanford or to higher
education, he said.
The other case involves issues
in which Kennedy is personally
interested, such as food safety 01
environmental issues.

"There is a point at which you
feel a tremendous personal need
to speak out," he said.
Kennedy has not reached this
point many times in the past 10
years, but last year he wrote a
letter to Harvard Magazine when
Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a
candidate for Harvard Universi
ty's Board of Overseers. The letter
expressed concern that Harvard
was plunging into single-issue
politics — in Tutu's case, the issue
was divestment — in academic
governance.
"If there is something I really
think I know about, it is the
governance of higher education. I
thought, ate and slept this busi
ness for a long time and Hnaliy
decided that constituency politics
is habit-forming. It is a very bad
idea to elect people to a board of
an academic institution on single
issue campaign promises," Ken
nedy said.
"I got some flak for Ithe letter]
in some quarters, but I don't
regret doing it,"he added.
Off the Farm, Kennedy is
"solidly committed" to three in
stitutions.
He serves as chair of Medical
Education for South African
Blacks, a Washington, D.C.-based
fund-raising -rganization.
Kennedy also works with the
California Nature Conservancy,

which acquires ecologically unique
private land and manages it
before turning it over to other
agencies.
In addition, he is a member of
the Health Effects Institute,
which he found shortly
after he left his position as com
missioner of the Food and Drug
Administration in 1979. The In
stitute is a private, non-profit or
ganization that was created to
help implement Clean Air Act reg
ulations.
Although he has served as FDA
commissioner and in the govern
ment's Office of Science and Tech
nology, Kennedy said his only
influence in government is "with
particular individuals I knew who
had reason to respect my perform
ance there."
It would be difficult, however,
for Kennedy to deny his influence
at Stanford after a decade of
presidency.
In considering how the job has
changed over the past 10 years,
Kennedy said, "We're trying to do
some more difficult things. We're
trying to become a benchmark
multicultural community. It's a
challenge.
"It is certainly true that the job
has gotten more difficult, but it
has also gotten more interesting."
