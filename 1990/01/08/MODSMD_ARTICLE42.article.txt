# Revised report will call for more Native American staff
## 
### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
The UCMI staff subcommittee will
reissue its final report, including survey
results from Native American staff mem
bers that were initially omitted.
The reissued report also will contain
an additional recommendation calling for
increased attention to the recruitment
and retention of Native Americans on the
staff.
The original University Committee on
Minority Issues staff report, issued Nov.
15, had cited the small number of Native

Americans on the Stanford staff — a
total of 36 at the time of the staff survey
— in explaining why it did not report
separate results for Native Americans.
Two prominent members of the Native
American community at Stanford —
James Larimore, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs and director of the Native
American Cultural Center, and Denni
Woodward, the center's program coordi
nator — strongly objected to this omis
sion, calling it a "statistical genocide."
In a letter to the American Indian Staff
Forum, members of the UCMI staff sub
committee apologized for excluding Na-

tive American responses from the Nov.
15 report. Although the omission was
based on "statistical limitations," the
subcommittee said, "We realize now that
the exclusion insulted the American In
dian community, and we greatly regret
our insensitivity to such feelings."
In addition, members of the subcom
mittee met with members of the staff
forum in December to discuss details of
the reissue. Larimore characterized the
meeting as "friendly but tense," and said
he was "generally very pleased with the
meeting and the decisions made."
"Trust takes a while to rebuild, but

we're well on the way," he said.
Staff subcommittee co-chair and Vice
Provost Raymond Bacchetti said, "There
wasn't any disagreement that a mistake
had been made," so the meeting focused
on the best way to correct that mistake.
The report will be reissued as a sepa
rate newsprint publication and mailed to
all full-time faculty and staff members,
Bacchetti said. It will also be distributed
to students at central locations. In addi
tion, a paperbound edition of the report
will be given to administrators who work
in areas such as human resources and
staff affairs, he said.

Bacchetti said the cost of the reissue
was "manageable" — something more
than $1,000, though he did not know the
exact figure.
In the revised report, data will be in
cluded for Native American exempt and
non-exempt staff, both of which had high
percentage response rates despite their
small numbers.
But the report will not include data
for the bargaining unit/police group, in
which only three out of 10 responded.
The subcommittee believes that publish
ing responses from such a small group
"might compromise confidentiality."
