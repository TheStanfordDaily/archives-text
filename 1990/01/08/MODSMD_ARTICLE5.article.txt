### Paul Owens Staff writer 
A suit filed by a visiting professor in
1986 after Stanford denied him a perma
nent appointment was thrown out by a
Santa Clara County judge on Dec. 22.
Professor Norman Davies, a Polish his
tory scholar who taught at Stanford in
1985-86, contended that he was rejected
for a tenured position because Jewish pro
fessors in the History Department took
issue with his portrayal of the history of
Jews in Poland.
In granting summary judgment to Stan
ford, however, Superior Court Judge James
Stewart ruled that "Stanford . . . did no
more than evaluate (Davies') scholarship
as contained in his scholarly works."
Stewart concluded that Davies' lawsuit had
"no triable issue."
Davies, a professor in the School of
Slavonic and East European Studies at the
University of London, came to Stanford in
1985 on the unanimous recommendation
of a faculty search committee. While serv
ing as a visiting professor, Davies was un
der consideration for a $70,000-a-year
tenured position in the History Depart
ment.
By a 12-11 vote, the department turned
down Davies' appointment.
In his lawsuit, Davies alleged that he
was rejected for his viewpoints rather than
for the quality of his research. He sought
$3 million in damages from Stanford for
what he characterized as fraud, mis
representation, breach of contract, discrim
ination and defamation.

In granting summary judg
ment to Stanford, Superior
Court Judge James Stewart
ruled that 'Stanford ... did
no more than evaluate
(Davies') scholarship as
contained in his scholarly
works.'

Works by Davies have been criticized by
some historians for understating the extent
of anti-Semitism in Poland and for arguing
that the Poles could not have prevented
the murder of three million of the country's
Jews after the Nazis invaded in 1939.
However, Ronald Hilton, a professor
emeritus in the History Department, said,
"Davies is recognized as the leading scholar
on Polish affairs in the English-speaking
world." Hilton added, "The consensus of
scholars, including rabbis and other Jews,
is that Davies is not anti-Semitic."
Testimony by Hilton that Davies did not
receive the treatment due a tenure-track
professor was dismissed by the court. Ac
cording to Campus Report, Judge Stewart
ruled that Hilton "was unable to cite a
single instance, practice or custom that
would support the view that a visiting pro
fessor is a member of the tenure-line fac
ulty."
Davies' attorney, former U.S. Rep. Pete
McCloskey, said that his client will appeal
