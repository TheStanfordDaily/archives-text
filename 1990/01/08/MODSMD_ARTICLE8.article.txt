# Seniors garner one Rhodes, two Marshall Scholarships
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
While most Stanford students spend their
senior years deciding what they will do
after graduation, that choice has become
much simpler for three seniors. Kim Grose
was named one of 32 Rhodes scholars in
the nation and Reid Hoffman and Sanjoy
Mahajan are two of 30 recipients of Mar
shall scholarships.
Rhodes scholarships provide two years of
fees and living expenses at Oxford Univer
sity, while Marshall scholars receive one
year of study in Great Britain.
Grose, an anthropology major, is the 63rd
Stanford student to win a Rhodes scholar
ship. The award was established by the
estate of Cecil Rhodes in 1902.
Grose worked with the Coalition for the
Homeless in her native New York City her
senior year in high school. She has contin
ued her involvement in public service at
Stanford, combining it with a distinguished
academic record and a spot on the varsity
sailing team. She is a resident advisor in
Otero this year.
She founded the Stanford Project on Na
tional Service, a student lobbying organi
zation concerned with state and national
voluteer service legislation. She also de
signed and led a seminar entitled Motivated
to Serve: The Philosophy and Practice of
Public Service.
She also help organize and raise funds
for the first Stanford-Soviet student ex
change program.
At Oxford she plans to study for a second
bachelor's degree in human sciences, a com
bination of natural and social sciences.
"Kim combines many of the virtues that
the Rhodes people are seeking — sensitivity,

thoughtfulness and worldliness — all in
one person," said anthropology Prof.
William Durham, Grose's advisor. "What
amazes me most is her ability to combine
the life of the mind with public service."
Hoffman and Mahajan bring the total of
Stanford students selected as Marshall
scholars to 33. The program was estab
lished by the British government in 1954
as an expression of thanks for the post-war
aid given by the United States under the
Marshall Plan.
Hoffman is a San Francisco native major
ing in symbolic systems. He received the
University's Golden Grant Award for his
research project dealing with the
procedural and declarative controversy in
artificial intelligence, linguisitcs and psy
chology.
He also founded and chaired the Sym
bolic Systems Forum, the only student ac
ademic society of its kind.
He plans to use his Marshall scholarship
to study cognitive science at Edinburgh
University in Scotland.
Mahajan, a Pittsburgh native, is major
ing in physics and mathematics.
He was ranked as one of the leaders in
a problem-solving seminar including some
of the best young computer scientists in
the world.
Mahajan is an accomplished piano player
and competes in Ultimate Frisbee, karate,
chess and tennis. He is also an expert card
counter and is using that knowledge to
develop the optimal player strategy for
blackjack.
He hopes to use his scholarship to study
mathematics at Oxford. His ambition is to
work of the unification of quantum me
chanics and general relativity.
