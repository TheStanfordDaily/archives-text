New trustee elected
The Board of Trustees increased its
membership to 33 with the Dec. 12
election of George Hume, president
and chief executive officer of Basic
American Foods of San Francisco.
A 1969 graduate of Yale in political
science and economics, the 43-year-old
Hume earned his law and business
degrees from Stanford in 1975. He is
one of eight vice chairs of the San
Francisco Campaign Council of the
Stanford Office of Development.
After receiving his Stanford degree,
Hume was a senior associate at the
management consulting firm McKin
sey & Co. in San Francisco. He then
joined Basic American Foods in 1979
as director of planning. He has served
as president and CEO since 1986.
Each trustee serves a five-year term
and can be re-elected for a second
consecutive term.
New VA building planned
Officials at the Veterans Adminis
tration Medical Center in Palo Alto
say one of the hospital's quake
damaged wings will be replaced by a
$200 million building.
The medical center's Building 1 was
seriously damaged in the Oct. 17
earthquake. The building was closed,
eliminating 300,000 square feet of
space.
The building housed many Stanford
research projects, and the quake set
back some projects several months.
Medical center officials said the new
building had been planned for some
time, but the quake will speed up
construction. Work may begin next
year and could be finished within five
years.
In the meantime, hospital employ
ees are using makeshift offices in 40
temporary trailers on hospital

grounds. Some researchers have relo
cated their operations to Stanford
Hospital.
Commissioner new prof.
WANTED: A new associate profes
sor of business law at Stanford Law
School.
QUALIFICATIONS DESIRED: At
least four years' experience specializ
ing in corporate law, securities regula
tion, and mergers and acquisitions.
Experience as a commissioner of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Com
mission helpful.
Though the job description was
slightly different, Joseph Grundfest
met those qualifications after four
years as SEC commissioner and will
join the Law School faculty this
month.
Grundfest received his law degree
from Stanford in 1978. At the time,
he had also completed all require
ments other than a dissertation for a
doctorate in economics.
Drunk drivers beware
It now takes less alcohol in a
motorist's bloodstream to be consid
ered legally drunk in California,
thanks to a new state law that took
effect Jan. 1.
The law lowers the drunk threshold
from .10 percent blood alcohol content
to .08 percent. State officials said the
change brings state law into alignment
with research results on driving im
pairment obtained by the American
College of Emergency Physicians.
The new threshold means that most
people will cross the line between legal
and illegal driving one drink sooner.
In fact, many people weighing 160
pounds may cross the cutoff after only
three drinks, a spokesperson said.

Since 1980, California police officers
have arrested more than 2.7 million
drunk drivers, an average of 344,150
a year. More than 20,000 of the 40,048
traffic fatalities between 1980 and
1988 occurred as a result of alcohol
related collisions.
Before accepting the council post in
1984, he served as a research fellow
in economics at the Brookings Insti
tution and practiced law with the firm
of Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering in
Washington, D.C. He also previously
served as counsel and senior econo
mist for legal and regulatory matters
for the Council of Economic Advisers.
Grundfest's term as commissioner
expires in June, but his resignation
is effective no later than Jan. 31.
Prof, to pick Pulitzers
James Risser, teaching professor of
communication and director of Stan
ford's Knight Fellows program for pro
fessional journalists, has been elected
to the Pulitzer Prize Board.
Risser has won two Pulitzer Prizes,
in 1976 and 1979, for national report
ing while on the staff of the Des
Moines Register. The first was for
stories exposing corruption in the U.S.
grain exporting industry; the second
for a series showing the destructive
impact of modern agriculture on the
environment.
The board meets each spring at Co
lumbia University to make final de
cisions on awards on journalism, arts
and literature.
Risser holds degrees from the Uni
versity of Nebraska and the Univer
sity of San Francisco School of Law.
He practiced law in Nebraska before
turning to journalism and joined the
Stanford faculty in 1985.

New VA building planned
Officials at the Veterans Adminis
tration Medical Center in Palo Alto
say one of the hospital's quake
damaged wings will be replaced by a
$200 million building.
The medical center's Building 1 was
seriously damaged in the Oct. 17
earthquake. The building was closed,
eliminating 300,000 square feet of
space.
The building housed many Stanford
research projects, and the quake set
back some projects several months.
Medical center officials said the new
building had been planned for some
time, but the quake will speed up
construction. Work may begin next
year and could be finished within five
years.
In the meantime, hospital employ
ees are using makeshift offices in 40
temporary trailers on hospital

grounds. Some researchers have relo
cated their operations to Stanford
Hospital.
Commissioner new prof.
WANTED: A new associate profes
sor of business law at Stanford Law
School.
QUALIFICATIONS DESIRED: At
least four years' experience specializ
ing in corporate law, securities regula
tion, and mergers and acquisitions.
Experience as a commissioner of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Com
mission helpful.
Though the job description was
slightly different, Joseph Grundfest
met those qualifications after four
years as SEC commissioner and will
join the Law School faculty this
month.
Grundfest received his law degree
from Stanford in 1978. At the time,
he had also completed all require
ments other than a dissertation for a
doctorate in economics.
Drunk drivers beware
It now takes less alcohol in a
motorist's bloodstream to be consid
ered legally drunk in California,
thanks to a new state law that took
effect Jan. 1.
The law lowers the drunk threshold
from .10 percent blood alcohol content
to .08 percent. State officials said the
change brings state law into alignment
with research results on driving im
pairment obtained by the American
College of Emergency Physicians.
The new threshold means that most
people will cross the line between legal
and illegal driving one drink sooner.
In fact, many people weighing 160
pounds may cross the cutoff after only
three drinks, a spokesperson said.

Since 1980, California police officers
have arrested more than 2.7 million
drunk drivers, an average of 344,150
a year. More than 20,000 of the 40,048
traffic fatalities between 1980 and
1988 occurred as a result of alcohol
related collisions.
Before accepting the council post in
1984, he served as a research fellow
in economics at the Brookings Insti
tution and practiced law with the firm
of Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering in
Washington, D.C. He also previously
served as counsel and senior econo
mist for legal and regulatory matters
for the Council of Economic Advisers.
Grundfest's term as commissioner
expires in June, but his resignation
is effective no later than Jan. 31.
