# Families face financial hardship
## Grad students struggle to pay for child care 
### Paul Owens Staff writer 
While most students at Stan
ford are preoccupied with raising
their grades, some are more con
cerned with raising something
else — their children.
There are about 500 students,
most in graduate programs, with
children here. For those students
and their families, the high cost
of child care is making life in
creasingly complicated.
While a typical graduate
stipend may provide enough sup
port for a single student, it does
not cover the cost of raising a
family. Angie Patterson, the wife
of a graduate student and
mother of a 17-month-old son,
said that her husband's stipend
"doesn't even cover a month's
worth of groceries after we get
the rent out of the way."
Graduate families without
savings need a second income to
meet their expenses. And when
one parent is studying and the
other working, someone has to
watch the children.
Stanford supports a variety of
programs on campus offering
care for children of students, fac
ulty and employees. The Univer
sity provides space rent-free for
child care centers and pays for
major building maintenance.
Child care programs are coor
dinated and supported by the
Childcare Resource Center, a
unit of the Campus Affairs of
fice. The center also provides in
formation and referral services
for Stanford families seeking
child care. And the center over
sees a network of family day care
homes in Escondido Village.
Costs force spouses to work
But most of the cost of child
care lies in teacher salaries, not
rent, maintenance or technical
support. Consequently, while
University support promotes the
availability and quality of care

on campus, it does not signifi
cantly reduce the cost. And that
cost is too high for most grad
uate families.
At the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community, one of the
four centers on campus provid
ing child care, the cost of full
time care ranges from $475 a
month for a child aged 3 to 5 to
$680 for a child under age 2.
And as a non-profit cooperative,
the center's rates are comparable
to or lower than those charged
at the other child care centers
on campus and the family day
care homes.
Given such rates, a student's
spouse may be hard pressed to
find a job that pays enough, after
taxes and job-related expenses,
to cover the cost of care for even
one child.
Students at Stanford are not
alone in facing steep child care
costs. At MIT and Harvard,
where space for child care and
major maintenance are also pro
vided by the University, child

care is even more expensive than
at Stanford.
At Berkeley, the university
provides child care on campus
for student families and charges
fees based on their ability to pay.
Bob Buckles, the budget mana
ger for child care services at
Berkeley, estimated that one
half of the students using child
care on campus do not have to
pay for it. But as a public uni
versity, Berkeley receives state
funds to subsidize the cost of
providing child care.
Stay-at-home students
Many spouses at Stanford see
no choice but to stay at home
with the children. Those spouses
may bring in some extra money
if they can find other children
to care for in addition to their
own.
Some students with families
squeeze in a part-time job be
tween studying or spend part of
the day themselves caring for
their children while their

spouses work. Both arrange
ments save the cost of paying
for full-time child care, but the
student's work inevitably suf
fers.
Sue Allen, a teacher at
Children's Center, has seen the
number of graduate families who
can afford child care drop since
she began working at the center
eight years ago.
"It's not fair," she said. "The
students are coming here to get
an education, but the University
won't give them enough support
to concentrate on their studies."
Stanford grants stipends for
graduate students based on ac
ademic merit rather than finan
cial need. Stipends are the same
whether a student is single or is
married and has children.
But while a single student can
expect to pay around $300 a
month for rent in campus
housing, a student with a family
must pay $669 a month for a

bedrooms.
Health insurance expenses are
also significantly higher for
families. A single graduate stu
dent pays about $50 a month. A
family with two parents and one
or more children pays $166 a
month.
After absorbing these expenses,
it is difficult for a family to con
template spending an additional
$400 to $600, or even half that
amount, for child care each
month.
Few options leave flexibility
Some families take out loans to
meet their expenses, including
child care. Unlike stipends, loans
for Stanford graduate students
take into account basic living costs
for dependents.
For families of students in busi
ness, law or medical school, who
can reasonably expect comfortable
incomes after graduating, borrow
ing may make sense. For graduate
students studying history or Eng
lish or classics, who will probably
be paid less when they graduate,
a loan burden will be harder to
carry.
The challenge of caring for
children is compounded when the
student is a single parent. About
40 single parents study at Stan
ford.
One of those parents, Renee
Remy, is a 25-year-old mother of
a 2-year-old son. She is studying
for a bachelor's degree in psychol
ogy and a master's in education
concurrently.
With a combination of aid from
Stanford and her salary from a
job on which she spends 20 hours
each week, Remy can pay for full
time care for her son at Children's
Center. This leaves her days "free"

for attending classes, studying
and working.
Remy's obligations leave her al
most no flexibility in her schedule.
When she is assigned a research
paper, she must skip classes in
order to find time to work in the
library during the day.
Because she is still completing
her bachelor's degree, Remy is el
igible for need-baaed aid made
available to undergraduates. But
after winter quarter, when she is
working only on her master's,
Remy may no longer be eligible
for need-based aid. Her future as
a full-time graduate student is un
certain.
A few graduate families are re
ceiving additional grants from
Stanford this year. In 1988, a
donor established a fund to make
rent subsidies available for some
of the families with two or more
children in Escondido Village.
There are 179 such families this
year. Forty-six applied for sub
sidies from the rent fund, and 25
were approved. Those families
receive $200 rent subsidies each
month.
There are also a limited number
of annual need-based grants avail
able for graduate students. This
year, nine students with families
have received such grants.
Parent discrimination?
For several year 3, Children's
Center has been setting aside a
portion of its own operating
funds, collected from parent fees,
to provide scholarships. This year,
care for one out of every 12
children at the center is paid for
by scholarship.
The director of the center,
Nancy Golden, called that number
"a drop in the bucket," but said
that the center does not have the
money to offer any additional
scholarships. As its costs have
risen in the past few years, she
added, the center has lost families,
particularly graduate student
families.

The spouse of one graduate stu
dent, who has two children and a
third on the way, wondered
whether Stanford was
deliberately discouraging families
from coming here.
"Maybe Stanford thinks stu
dents without children are better
students," said the spouse, who
asked not to be identified.
The administration official who
oversees child care on campus
rejected that suggestion. Jim Bou
quin, assistant dean of student af
fairs, said, "Stanford has more
care than any other university
that I've heard of." But, he added,
"that doesn't mean that we can't
do more, that we shouldn't do
more."
Bouquin said families are an
important part of a multicultural
university, and Stanford has
taken several steps that demon
strate its resolve to address their
needs.
Last year, Stanford established
a committee to study student
families and to develop recom
mendations for University policy
on child care.
This year, Stanford appointed
Kathleen Ritchie as the first full
time director for the Childcare
Resource Center. Bouquin, who
chaired the search committee that
eventually named Ritchie, said
that she is "the best person in
the country for the job."
'Too many hurting'
Ritchie said her priority in her
first year would be to re-examine
the role that Stanford should play
in supporting child care. She is
confident, she said, that "Stanford
will address the issue with its
usual quality."
Jeremy Cohen, an assistant pro
fessor in the communication de
partment and a former president
of the board at Children's Center,
is concerned about the difficulty
of affording child care at Stanford,
not only for students, but for em
ployees and junior faculty.

"Raising children is an enor
mous stress on young people at
Stanford," said Cohen, who has
two young children. "We appreci
ate the help that Stanford pro
vides. But the University has got
to do more — there are too many
people hurting."
Both Bouquin and Ritchie said
Stanford would consider provid
ing specific child care support. But
Bouquin added, "The University
has to be wary when making long
term commitments."
Bouquin is himself a single par
ent, the father of a 5-year-old
daughter he leaves at the center
each day. He agreed that child
care on campus is expensive. "I
can barely afford it,"he said.
Bouquin considers child care a
more serious burden for Stanford
employees than for students. Em

ployees cannot take advantage of
the sources of aid that students
can, he said, like the fund for
families in Escondido Village.
Students have more flexibility
than the average office worker at
Stanford to adjust their schedules
for child care. And because stu
dents finish their degrees within
a few years, "studenthood is a
temporary poverty," he said.
Many Stanford parents believe
that financial pressures like ex
pensive child care are turning stu
dents with families away from the
University.
In fact, the number of students
with children has decreased over
the last decade. Jean Kim, assis
tant dean of graduate student af
fairs, said that in Escondido
Village, where families are given
preference in housing, 500 spaces

were left over for single students
in 1977. This year, there are about
1,000 single students living in Es
condido Village.
Kim said she thinks the decline
is probably part of a pattern na
tionally of fewer graduate stu
dents with families, rather than
a response to conditions for
families here. "Stanford has al
ways been at the head of the pack
in terms of child care policy," she
said.
Kim also said she believes that
Stanford is moving in the right
direction on child care. She cau
tioned that change would not oc
cur overnight.
Bouquin said, "Stanford is a
big, complex place, but we are
moving on child care." More sup
port is coming, he said, although
he's "not sure what kind."

The director of the center,
Nancy Golden, called that number
"a drop in the bucket," but said
that the center does not have the
money to offer any additional
scholarships. As its costs have
risen in the past few years, she
added, the center has lost families,
particularly graduate student
families.

The spouse of one graduate stu
dent, who has two children and a
third on the way, wondered
whether Stanford was
deliberately discouraging families
from coming here.
"Maybe Stanford thinks stu
dents without children are better
students," said the spouse, who
asked not to be identified.
The administration official who
oversees child care on campus
rejected that suggestion. Jim Bou
quin, assistant dean of student af
fairs, said, "Stanford has more
care than any other university
that I've heard of." But, he added,
"that doesn't mean that we can't
do more, that we shouldn't do
more."
Bouquin said families are an
important part of a multicultural
university, and Stanford has
taken several steps that demon
strate its resolve to address their
needs.
Last year, Stanford established
a committee to study student
families and to develop recom
mendations for University policy
on child care.
This year, Stanford appointed
Kathleen Ritchie as the first full
time director for the Childcare
Resource Center. Bouquin, who
chaired the search committee that
eventually named Ritchie, said
that she is "the best person in
the country for the job."
'Too many hurting'
Ritchie said her priority in her
first year would be to re-examine
the role that Stanford should play
in supporting child care. She is
confident, she said, that "Stanford
will address the issue with its
usual quality."
Jeremy Cohen, an assistant pro
fessor in the communication de
partment and a former president
of the board at Children's Center,
is concerned about the difficulty
of affording child care at Stanford,
not only for students, but for em
ployees and junior faculty.

"Raising children is an enor
mous stress on young people at
Stanford," said Cohen, who has
two young children. "We appreci
ate the help that Stanford pro
vides. But the University has got
to do more — there are too many
people hurting."
Both Bouquin and Ritchie said
Stanford would consider provid
ing specific child care support. But
Bouquin added, "The University
has to be wary when making long
term commitments."
Bouquin is himself a single par
ent, the father of a 5-year-old
daughter he leaves at the center
each day. He agreed that child
care on campus is expensive. "I
can barely afford it,"he said.
Bouquin considers child care a
more serious burden for Stanford
employees than for students. Em

ployees cannot take advantage of
the sources of aid that students
can, he said, like the fund for
families in Escondido Village.
Students have more flexibility
than the average office worker at
Stanford to adjust their schedules
for child care. And because stu
dents finish their degrees within
a few years, "studenthood is a
temporary poverty," he said.
Many Stanford parents believe
that financial pressures like ex
pensive child care are turning stu
dents with families away from the
University.
In fact, the number of students
with children has decreased over
the last decade. Jean Kim, assis
tant dean of graduate student af
fairs, said that in Escondido
Village, where families are given
preference in housing, 500 spaces

were left over for single students
in 1977. This year, there are about
1,000 single students living in Es
condido Village.
Kim said she thinks the decline
is probably part of a pattern na
tionally of fewer graduate stu
dents with families, rather than
a response to conditions for
families here. "Stanford has al
ways been at the head of the pack
in terms of child care policy," she
said.
Kim also said she believes that
Stanford is moving in the right
direction on child care. She cau
tioned that change would not oc
cur overnight.
Bouquin said, "Stanford is a
big, complex place, but we are
moving on child care." More sup
port is coming, he said, although
he's "not sure what kind."


N °, It isn't early ROTC training, just playtime at the Bing Nursery School, where many campus parents
enroll their children.
While most students at Stan
ford are preoccupied with raising
their grades, some are more con
cerned with raising something
else — their children.
There are about 500 students,
most in graduate programs, with
children here. For those students
and their families, the high cost
of child care is making life in
creasingly complicated.
While a typical graduate
stipend may provide enough sup
port for a single student, it does
not cover the cost of raising a
family. Angie Patterson, the wife
of a graduate student and
mother of a 17-month-old son,
said that her husband's stipend
"doesn't even cover a month's
worth of groceries after we get
the rent out of the way."
Graduate families without
savings need a second income to
meet their expenses. And when
one parent is studying and the
other working, someone has to
watch the children.
Stanford supports a variety of
programs on campus offering
care for children of students, fac
ulty and employees. The Univer
sity provides space rent-free for
child care centers and pays for
major building maintenance.
Child care programs are coor
dinated and supported by the
Childcare Resource Center, a
unit of the Campus Affairs of
fice. The center also provides in
formation and referral services
for Stanford families seeking
child care. And the center over
sees a network of family day care
homes in Escondido Village.
Costs force spouses to work
But most of the cost of child
care lies in teacher salaries, not
rent, maintenance or technical
support. Consequently, while
University support promotes the
availability and quality of care

on campus, it does not signifi
cantly reduce the cost. And that
cost is too high for most grad
uate families.
At the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community, one of the
four centers on campus provid
ing child care, the cost of full
time care ranges from $475 a
month for a child aged 3 to 5 to
$680 for a child under age 2.
And as a non-profit cooperative,
the center's rates are comparable
to or lower than those charged
at the other child care centers
on campus and the family day
care homes.
Given such rates, a student's
spouse may be hard pressed to
find a job that pays enough, after
taxes and job-related expenses,
to cover the cost of care for even
one child.
Students at Stanford are not
alone in facing steep child care
costs. At MIT and Harvard,
where space for child care and
major maintenance are also pro
vided by the University, child

care is even more expensive than
at Stanford.
At Berkeley, the university
provides child care on campus
for student families and charges
fees based on their ability to pay.
Bob Buckles, the budget mana
ger for child care services at
Berkeley, estimated that one
half of the students using child
care on campus do not have to
pay for it. But as a public uni
versity, Berkeley receives state
funds to subsidize the cost of
providing child care.
Stay-at-home students
Many spouses at Stanford see
no choice but to stay at home
with the children. Those spouses
may bring in some extra money
if they can find other children
to care for in addition to their
own.
Some students with families
squeeze in a part-time job be
tween studying or spend part of
the day themselves caring for
their children while their

spouses work. Both arrange
ments save the cost of paying
for full-time child care, but the
student's work inevitably suf
fers.
Sue Allen, a teacher at
Children's Center, has seen the
number of graduate families who
can afford child care drop since
she began working at the center
eight years ago.
"It's not fair," she said. "The
students are coming here to get
an education, but the University
won't give them enough support
to concentrate on their studies."
Stanford grants stipends for
graduate students based on ac
ademic merit rather than finan
cial need. Stipends are the same
whether a student is single or is
married and has children.
But while a single student can
expect to pay around $300 a
month for rent in campus
housing, a student with a family
must pay $669 a month for a

two-bedroom apartment in Escon
dido Village or $807 for three
bedrooms.
Health insurance expenses are
also significantly higher for
families. A single graduate stu
dent pays about $50 a month. A
family with two parents and one
or more children pays $166 a
month.
After absorbing these expenses,
it is difficult for a family to con
template spending an additional
$400 to $600, or even half that
amount, for child care each
month.
Few options leave flexibility
Some families take out loans to
meet their expenses, including
child care. Unlike stipends, loans
for Stanford graduate students
take into account basic living costs
for dependents.
For families of students in busi
ness, law or medical school, who
can reasonably expect comfortable
incomes after graduating, borrow
ing may make sense. For graduate
students studying history or Eng
lish or classics, who will probably
be paid less when they graduate,
a loan burden will be harder to
carry.
The challenge of caring for
children is compounded when the
student is a single parent. About
40 single parents study at Stan
ford.
One of those parents, Renee
Remy, is a 25-year-old mother of
a 2-year-old son. She is studying
for a bachelor's degree in psychol
ogy and a master's in education
concurrently.
With a combination of aid from
Stanford and her salary from a
job on which she spends 20 hours
each week, Remy can pay for full
time care for her son at Children's
Center. This leaves her days "free"

for attending classes, studying
and working.
Remy's obligations leave her al
most no flexibility in her schedule.
When she is assigned a research
paper, she must skip classes in
order to find time to work in the
library during the day.
Because she is still completing
her bachelor's degree, Remy is el
igible for need-baaed aid made
available to undergraduates. But
after winter quarter, when she is
working only on her master's,
Remy may no longer be eligible
for need-based aid. Her future as
a full-time graduate student is un
certain.
A few graduate families are re
ceiving additional grants from
Stanford this year. In 1988, a
donor established a fund to make
rent subsidies available for some
of the families with two or more
children in Escondido Village.
There are 179 such families this
year. Forty-six applied for sub
sidies from the rent fund, and 25
were approved. Those families
receive $200 rent subsidies each
month.
There are also a limited number
of annual need-based grants avail
able for graduate students. This
year, nine students with families
have received such grants.
Parent discrimination?
For several year 3, Children's
Center has been setting aside a
portion of its own operating
funds, collected from parent fees,
to provide scholarships. This year,
care for one out of every 12
children at the center is paid for
by scholarship.
The director of the center,
Nancy Golden, called that number
"a drop in the bucket," but said
that the center does not have the
money to offer any additional
scholarships. As its costs have
risen in the past few years, she
added, the center has lost families,
particularly graduate student
families.

to care for in addition to their

Some students with families
squeeze in a part-time job be
tween studying or spend part of
the day themselves caring for
their children while their

spouses work. Both arrange

for full-time child care, but the
student's work inevitably suf

Sue Allen, a teacher at
Children's Center, has seen the
number of graduate families who
can afford child care drop since

eight years ago.

Health insurance expenses are
also significantly higher for
families. A single graduate stu
dent pays about $50 a month. A
family with two parents and one
or more children pays $166 a
month.
After absorbing these expenses,
it is difficult for a family to con
template spending an additional
$400 to $600, or even half that
amount, for child care each
month.
Few options leave flexibility
Some families take out loans to
meet their expenses, including
child care. Unlike stipends, loans
for Stanford graduate students
take into account basic living costs
for dependents.
For families of students in busi
ness, law or medical school, who
can reasonably expect comfortable
incomes after graduating, borrow
ing may make sense. For graduate
students studying history or Eng
lish or classics, who will probably
be paid less when they graduate,
a loan burden will be harder to
carry.
The challenge of caring for
children is compounded when the
student is a single parent. About
40 single parents study at Stan
ford.
One of those parents, Renee
Remy, is a 25-year-old mother of
a 2-year-old son. She is studying
for a bachelor's degree in psychol
ogy and a master's in education
concurrently.
With a combination of aid from
Stanford and her salary from a
job on which she spends 20 hours
each week, Remy can pay for full
time care for her son at Children's
Center. This leaves her days "free"

for attending classes, studying
and working.
Remy's obligations leave her al
most no flexibility in her schedule.
When she is assigned a research
paper, she must skip classes in
order to find time to work in the
library during the day.
Because she is still completing
her bachelor's degree, Remy is el
igible for need-baaed aid made
available to undergraduates. But
after winter quarter, when she is
working only on her master's,
Remy may no longer be eligible
for need-based aid. Her future as
a full-time graduate student is un
certain.
A few graduate families are re
ceiving additional grants from
Stanford this year. In 1988, a
donor established a fund to make
rent subsidies available for some
of the families with two or more
children in Escondido Village.
There are 179 such families this
year. Forty-six applied for sub
sidies from the rent fund, and 25
were approved. Those families
receive $200 rent subsidies each
month.
There are also a limited number
of annual need-based grants avail
able for graduate students. This
year, nine students with families
have received such grants.
Parent discrimination?
For several year 3, Children's
Center has been setting aside a
portion of its own operating
funds, collected from parent fees,
to provide scholarships. This year,
care for one out of every 12
children at the center is paid for
by scholarship.
The director of the center,
Nancy Golden, called that number
"a drop in the bucket," but said
that the center does not have the
money to offer any additional
scholarships. As its costs have
risen in the past few years, she
added, the center has lost families,
particularly graduate student
families.

The spouse of one graduate stu
dent, who has two children and a
third on the way, wondered
whether Stanford was
deliberately discouraging families
from coming here.
"Maybe Stanford thinks stu
dents without children are better
students," said the spouse, who
asked not to be identified.
The administration official who
oversees child care on campus
rejected that suggestion. Jim Bou
quin, assistant dean of student af
fairs, said, "Stanford has more
care than any other university
that I've heard of." But, he added,
"that doesn't mean that we can't
do more, that we shouldn't do
more."
Bouquin said families are an
important part of a multicultural
university, and Stanford has
taken several steps that demon
strate its resolve to address their
needs.
Last year, Stanford established
a committee to study student
families and to develop recom
mendations for University policy
on child care.
This year, Stanford appointed
Kathleen Ritchie as the first full
time director for the Childcare
Resource Center. Bouquin, who
chaired the search committee that
eventually named Ritchie, said
that she is "the best person in
the country for the job."
'Too many hurting'
Ritchie said her priority in her
first year would be to re-examine
the role that Stanford should play
in supporting child care. She is
confident, she said, that "Stanford
will address the issue with its
usual quality."
Jeremy Cohen, an assistant pro
fessor in the communication de
partment and a former president
of the board at Children's Center,
is concerned about the difficulty
of affording child care at Stanford,
not only for students, but for em
ployees and junior faculty.

"Raising children is an enor
mous stress on young people at
Stanford," said Cohen, who has
two young children. "We appreci
ate the help that Stanford pro
vides. But the University has got
to do more — there are too many
people hurting."
Both Bouquin and Ritchie said
Stanford would consider provid
ing specific child care support. But
Bouquin added, "The University
has to be wary when making long
term commitments."
Bouquin is himself a single par
ent, the father of a 5-year-old
daughter he leaves at the center
each day. He agreed that child
care on campus is expensive. "I
can barely afford it,"he said.
Bouquin considers child care a
more serious burden for Stanford
employees than for students. Em

ployees cannot take advantage of
the sources of aid that students
can, he said, like the fund for
families in Escondido Village.
Students have more flexibility
than the average office worker at
Stanford to adjust their schedules
for child care. And because stu
dents finish their degrees within
a few years, "studenthood is a
temporary poverty," he said.
Many Stanford parents believe
that financial pressures like ex
pensive child care are turning stu
dents with families away from the
University.
In fact, the number of students
with children has decreased over
the last decade. Jean Kim, assis
tant dean of graduate student af
fairs, said that in Escondido
Village, where families are given
preference in housing, 500 spaces

were left over for single students
in 1977. This year, there are about
1,000 single students living in Es
condido Village.
Kim said she thinks the decline
is probably part of a pattern na
tionally of fewer graduate stu
dents with families, rather than
a response to conditions for
families here. "Stanford has al
ways been at the head of the pack
in terms of child care policy," she
said.
Kim also said she believes that
Stanford is moving in the right
direction on child care. She cau
tioned that change would not oc
cur overnight.
Bouquin said, "Stanford is a
big, complex place, but we are
moving on child care." More sup
port is coming, he said, although
he's "not sure what kind."


N °, It isn't early ROTC training, just playtime at the Bing Nursery School, where many campus parents
enroll their children.
While most students at Stan
ford are preoccupied with raising
their grades, some are more con
cerned with raising something
else — their children.
There are about 500 students,
most in graduate programs, with
children here. For those students
and their families, the high cost
of child care is making life in
creasingly complicated.
While a typical graduate
stipend may provide enough sup
port for a single student, it does
not cover the cost of raising a
family. Angie Patterson, the wife
of a graduate student and
mother of a 17-month-old son,
said that her husband's stipend
"doesn't even cover a month's
worth of groceries after we get
the rent out of the way."
Graduate families without
savings need a second income to
meet their expenses. And when
one parent is studying and the
other working, someone has to
watch the children.
Stanford supports a variety of
programs on campus offering
care for children of students, fac
ulty and employees. The Univer
sity provides space rent-free for
child care centers and pays for
major building maintenance.
Child care programs are coor
dinated and supported by the
Childcare Resource Center, a
unit of the Campus Affairs of
fice. The center also provides in
formation and referral services
for Stanford families seeking
child care. And the center over
sees a network of family day care
homes in Escondido Village.
Costs force spouses to work
But most of the cost of child
care lies in teacher salaries, not
rent, maintenance or technical
support. Consequently, while
University support promotes the
availability and quality of care

on campus, it does not signifi
cantly reduce the cost. And that
cost is too high for most grad
uate families.
At the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community, one of the
four centers on campus provid
ing child care, the cost of full
time care ranges from $475 a
month for a child aged 3 to 5 to
$680 for a child under age 2.
And as a non-profit cooperative,
the center's rates are comparable
to or lower than those charged
at the other child care centers
on campus and the family day
care homes.
Given such rates, a student's
spouse may be hard pressed to
find a job that pays enough, after
taxes and job-related expenses,
to cover the cost of care for even
one child.
Students at Stanford are not
alone in facing steep child care
costs. At MIT and Harvard,
where space for child care and
major maintenance are also pro
vided by the University, child

care is even more expensive than
at Stanford.
At Berkeley, the university
provides child care on campus
for student families and charges
fees based on their ability to pay.
Bob Buckles, the budget mana
ger for child care services at
Berkeley, estimated that one
half of the students using child
care on campus do not have to
pay for it. But as a public uni
versity, Berkeley receives state
funds to subsidize the cost of
providing child care.
Stay-at-home students
Many spouses at Stanford see
no choice but to stay at home
with the children. Those spouses
may bring in some extra money
if they can find other children
to care for in addition to their
own.
Some students with families
squeeze in a part-time job be
tween studying or spend part of
the day themselves caring for
their children while their

spouses work. Both arrange

the last decade. Jean Kim, assis
tant dean of graduate student af
fairs, said that in Escondido
Village, where families are given
preference in housing, 500 spaces

were left over for single students
in 1977. This year, there are about
1,000 single students living in Es
condido Village.
Kim said she thinks the decline
is probably part of a pattern na
tionally of fewer graduate stu
dents with families, rather than
a response to conditions for
families here. "Stanford has al
ways been at the head of the pack
in terms of child care policy," she
said.
Kim also said she believes that
Stanford is moving in the right
direction on child care. She cau
tioned that change would not oc
cur overnight.
Bouquin said, "Stanford is a
big, complex place, but we are
moving on child care." More sup
port is coming, he said, although
he's "not sure what kind."

enroll their children.
