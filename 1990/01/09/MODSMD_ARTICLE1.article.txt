# Families face financial hardship
## Grad students struggle to pay for child care 
### Paul Owens Staff writer 
While most students at Stan
ford are preoccupied with raising
their grades, some are more con
cerned with raising something
else — their children.
There are about 500 students,
most in graduate programs, with
children here. For those students
and their families, the high cost
of child care is making life in
creasingly complicated.
While a typical graduate
stipend may provide enough sup
port for a single student, it does
not cover the cost of raising a
family. Angie Patterson, the wife
of a graduate student and
mother of a 17-month-old son,
said that her husband's stipend
"doesn't even cover a month's
worth of groceries after we get
the rent out of the way."
Graduate families without
savings need a second income to
meet their expenses. And when
one parent is studying and the
other working, someone has to
watch the children.
Stanford supports a variety of
programs on campus offering
care for children of students, fac
ulty and employees. The Univer
sity provides space rent-free for
child care centers and pays for
major building maintenance.
Child care programs are coor
dinated and supported by the
Childcare Resource Center, a
unit of the Campus Affairs of
fice. The center also provides in
formation and referral services
for Stanford families seeking
child care. And the center over
sees a network of family day care
homes in Escondido Village.
Costs force spouses to work
But most of the cost of child
care lies in teacher salaries, not
rent, maintenance or technical
support. Consequently, while
University support promotes the
availability and quality of care

on campus, it does not signifi
cantly reduce the cost. And that
cost is too high for most grad
uate families.
At the Children's Center of the
Stanford Community, one of the
four centers on campus provid
ing child care, the cost of full
time care ranges from $475 a
month for a child aged 3 to 5 to
$680 for a child under age 2.
And as a non-profit cooperative,
the center's rates are comparable
to or lower than those charged
at the other child care centers
on campus and the family day
care homes.
Given such rates, a student's
spouse may be hard pressed to
find a job that pays enough, after
taxes and job-related expenses,
to cover the cost of care for even
one child.
Students at Stanford are not
alone in facing steep child care
costs. At MIT and Harvard,
where space for child care and
major maintenance are also pro
vided by the University, child

care is even more expensive than
at Stanford.
At Berkeley, the university
provides child care on campus
for student families and charges
fees based on their ability to pay.
Bob Buckles, the budget mana
ger for child care services at
Berkeley, estimated that one
half of the students using child
care on campus do not have to
pay for it. But as a public uni
versity, Berkeley receives state
funds to subsidize the cost of
providing child care.
Stay-at-home students
Many spouses at Stanford see
no choice but to stay at home
with the children. Those spouses
may bring in some extra money
if they can find other children
to care for in addition to their
own.
Some students with families
squeeze in a part-time job be
tween studying or spend part of
the day themselves caring for
their children while their

spouses work. Both arrange
ments save the cost of paying
for full-time child care, but the
student's work inevitably suf
fers.
Sue Allen, a teacher at
Children's Center, has seen the
number of graduate families who
can afford child care drop since
she began working at the center
eight years ago.
"It's not fair," she said. "The
students are coming here to get
an education, but the University
won't give them enough support
to concentrate on their studies."
Stanford grants stipends for
graduate students based on ac
ademic merit rather than finan
cial need. Stipends are the same
whether a student is single or is
married and has children.
But while a single student can
expect to pay around $300 a
month for rent in campus
housing, a student with a family
must pay $669 a month for a
