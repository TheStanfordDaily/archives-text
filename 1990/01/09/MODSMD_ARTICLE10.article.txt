## Bulgarians appeal for calm 
### 
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) â€”
Leaders of the Communist Party,
opposition and ethnic groups
united in appealing yesterday for
an end to protests and strikes over
the decision to restore rights to
Bulgaria's ethnic Turks.
Consultations about settling
the ethnic dispute began yester
day and will continue all week,
the official news agency BTA re
ported.
Politburo member Mincho Yov
chev said "unrest over the ... de
cision" Dec. 29 to restore religious
rights to 1.2 million ethnic Turks
and withdraw the requirement
that they take Bulgarian names
had created the "first serious
crisis" since reforms began two
months ago.
Petar Mladenov, who replaced
Todor Zhivkov as party chief Nov.
10 and ended 35 years of Stalinist
rule, defended the policy reversal
in a meeting with Slav
nationalists.
He told leaders of the Council
for the Defense of National Inter
ests that the 1984 decisions re
stricting the rights of ethnic
Turks, most of whom are Mos
lems, "were very grave errors,"
BTA reported.
"One result of these errors has
been Bulgaria's complete interna
tional isolation," Mladenov said,
and the only way out of that sit

uation was "to restore the consti
tutional rights of all citizens," the
agency reported.
Yovchev, a deputy premier, said
the "wounds inflicted on Bul
garian society as a whole" by Zhiv
kov's persecution of ethnic Turks
"turned out to be much more
serious than we assumed."
After Zhivkov granted passports
last May, 325,000 ethnic Turks
fled Bulgaria for Turkey. About
96,000 have returned, complain
ing of poor housing and lack of
jobs.
"Pressed for time, we were un
able to accompany our decision in
principle (Dec. 29) with a com
prehensive program on the ethnic
issue," he said in a television in
terview.
His comments reflected the
predicament of a leadership
caught between demands by the
ethnic Turkish minority for rights
and protests by tens of thousands
of Slav nationalists against con
cessions.
"Different forces take advantage
of this to discredit the new lead
ership of the Bulgarian Commu
nist Party and the state" and the
Politburo is seeking a "practical
solution" to the ethnic problem,
Yovchev said. He and others have
hinted that Zhivkov loyalists in
cited ethnic unrest.

Foreign Minister Boiko
Dimitrov of Bulgaria and the
Turkish foreign minister, Mesut
Yilmaz, are to discuss the problem
at a meeting tomorrow in Kuwait.
At yesterday's meeting of
delegates from all groups con
cerned with the ethnic conflict,
trade union official Krasniu Pet
kov urged that demonstrations
and strikes cease "during this
week of dialogue," BTA reported.
Petkov said all participants in
the talks at the National Assem
bly supported Petkov.
About 200 people demonstrated
in front of the parliament build
ing, demanding the restrictions on
ethnic Turks continue. They dis
played placards with such
nationalist slogans as "One
People, One Language, One Flag."
Nationalists have expressed
fear their own culture would at
one time be overshadowed by that
of the Turks, whose birth rate is
increasing as that of Slavs
declines.
Mistrust of Turks has lingered
in Bulgaria since 500 years of oc
cupation by the Ottoman Empire
ended a century ago.
Nationalist demonstrators deny
pro-Zhivkov elements are behind
the protests.
