# Members of U.N. Security Council to meet on Cambodia
## 
### 
PARIS (AP) â€” Representatives of the
U.N. Security Council's five permanent
members will meet in Paris next week
to consider ways of bringing peace to
Cambodia, diplomatic sources said Mon
day.
They said the two-day talks would
focus on an Australian proposal to replace
Cambodia's Communist government with
a U.N. administration until formation of
a new government after free elections.
Deputy foreign ministers of the United
States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and
France are to participate in the Paris
meeting Jan. 15-16, the diplomats said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

Michael Costello, Australia's deputy
foreign minister, met with Premier Hun
Sen of Cambodia yesterday about the pro
posal. The official Cambodian news
agency SPK said they met in an "eastern
province of Cambodia" and agreed to the
idea of involving the United Nations in
an interim administration.
Guerrilla attacks in western Cambodia
have increased international pressure to
find ways of preventing a return to power
by the Khmer Rouge, who conducted a
reign of terror from the end of the In
dochina war in 1975 until the Vietnamese
invasion of Cambodia in December 1978.
In Washington, State Department

spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
talks among the five countries would take
place "in the near future," but would
not confirm the date or place.
"Reports of stepped-up military activ
ity by the Khmer Rouge underscore the
need to move quickly toward a diplomatic
solution," she said. "We believe that a
comprehensive settlement is the best way
to ensure that the Khmer Rouge do not
enhance their influence in Cambodia by
means of force."
The Khmer Rouge is allied with two
non-Communist resistance groups
backed by the United States in a coalition
led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cam

bodia's former ruler. They are fighting
the Hun Sen government, which Vietnam
sponsors.
Vietnam says it completed withdrawing
its occupation army from Cambodia at
the end of September.
In an intrerview broadcast by Cam
bodian state radio Sunday, the defense
minister acknowledged guerrilla advances
in western areas near the Thai border
and said his fortes had left some positions
to concentrate defenses on major towns
and roads.
"The enemies have been gradually ad
vancing in their attacks against a number
of our positions along the border," Gen.

Tea Banh said. "We have lost some po
sitions. We cannot stay in every village.
We have to abandon some and keep some
strategic ones."
Peace efforts, notably an international
conference last summer in Paris, have
failed in large part because the Hun Sen
government refuses to include the Khmer
Rouge in an all-party interim adminis
tration.
Sihanouk argues that excluding the
Khmer Rouge, the strongest guerrilla
group, would only ensure continued fight
ing.
Australia suggests about 200 adminis
trators be sent to govern Cambodia.
