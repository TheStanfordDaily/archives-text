9 Contras convert
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — A top official
and 8 others from the U.S.-backed Contra guer
rillas yesterday ended their armed fight against
the leftist Sandinista government to return home
and take part in the electoral process.
It was the first Contra group to return to
Nicaragua under the auspices of a United
Nations-Organization of American States com
mittee charged with supervising demobilization
of the rebel force.
Luis Fley, a long-time official at the rebels'
Honduras office, said the group decided to return
as an expression of support for the Central Amer
ican peace process and to "contribute to the proc
ess of national reconciliation."
The UN-OAS committee was established under
the terms of accords reached by Central American
presidents calling for demobilization of the Con
tras in exchange for fair elections in Nicaragua.
Contras who want to take part in elections sched
uled for Feb. 25 must return to Nicaragua by
Feb. 5.
Baker to discuss arms
WASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary of State
James A. Baker 111 will go to Moscow early next
month to try to clear away key obstacles to a
new U.S.-Soviet treaty sharply reducing long
range nuclear missiles, Bush administration of
ficials disclosed yesterday.
Baker also is considering a visit to Prague to
demonstrate U.S. support for the peaceful revo

lution in Czechoslovakia that displaced a hard-line
Communist government, the officials told The
Associated Press.
The trip to Moscow for talks Feb. 6-7 is one
of three sessions Baker intends to hold with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze before
a U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Washington in
June.
The projected centerpiece of the summit is a
treaty slashing U.S. and Soviet arsenals of long
range bombers, submarines and missiles by 30
to 50 percent.
The most complex of the three issues Baker
will try to resolve with Shevardnadze concerns
how long-range, air-launched cruise missiles
carried by bombers should be counted against a
treaty limit of 6,000 strategic warheads.
Drug problem worsens
WASHINGTON (AP) — Drug problems wor
sened last year in more than half the nation's
cities, making the issue the top worry of urban
leaders, a survey of elected officials said yesterday
Fewer than one city in 10 reported making
any headway locally in the war on drugs, accord
ing to the survey by the National League of Cities.
"There's been a lot of talk about drugs coming
out of Washington, and our city leaders are now
sending back a message — a message that it's
time for Washington to get a front-line report
on what's happening and what's needed," said
Alan Beals, executive director of the league.
