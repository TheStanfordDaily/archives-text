# Soviet head condemns Lithuanians

### 
MOSCOW (AP) - The Krem
lin's ideology chief told Lithuanian
Communists yesterday their
break with Moscow is a blow to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reform program at its most criti
cal moment.
Vadim A. Medvedev, a member
of the ruling Politburo, made the
comment as he laid the
groundwork for a trip to Lit
huania this week by Gorbachev,
a visit that will test Gorbachev's
ability to end one of the worst
political crises of his nearly five
year tenure.
Violence along the Soviet-
Iranian border meanwhile was re
ported to have reignited and
spread to an area that also is close
to Turkey. Soviet Azerbaijani pro
testers reportedly destroyed more
border posts.
Medvedev told Communists and
workers at a factory in Vilnius,
the capital of Lithuania, that their
party's decision Dec. 20 to declare
independence from the national
party has "effects on the problems
of interethnic relations and
national-state structure and eco
nomic reforms," Tass said.
In a dispatch paraphrasing him,

the official news agency did not
say how economic reforms would
be damaged.
"The decisions made by the
20th Congress of the Lithuanian
Communist Party are a blow to
the Soviet Communist Party's
unity, to the construction of a
revitalized federation and to all
of perestroika," Tass said,
paraphrasing Medvedev.
The decision is seen as a pos
sible precursor to secession by the
Baltic republic of 3.7 million
people.
The Kremlin is clearly ex
tremely concerned over the
prospect that the entire Soviet fed
eration could break apart if other
republics follow Lithuania's move.
Politburo member Alexander N.
Yakovlev said in an interview
Monday with Interfax, a news
service of Radio Moscow, the Lit
huanian move might cause a
"domino effect" — implying that
Communists in the 14 other
republics might also break from
Moscow.
Medvedev said the split cuts off
Lithuanians from democratic pro
cesses throughout the country
and "cannot be assessed otherwise

but as an expression of no
confidence in the Soviet Commu
nist Party and its course for
perestroika, as a blow to
perestroika at the most critical
time of its development."
In remarks carried by Soviet
TV, he asked Lithuanian Commu
nists to compromise, saying,
"Nobody is against independence.
But let this be together with the
Soviet Communist Party.
"We have to unite, then we will
have nothing to fear."
Gorbachev is expected to arrive
in Vilnius tomorrow and spend
three days trying to persuade the
Lithuanians to return to the fold.
The Lithuanian grassroots move
ment Sfyudis is calling for a giant
demonstration during the visit
show the people's determination
to pursue independence.
The government daily Izvestia
said Monday that Azerbaijani pro
testers destroyed border posts at
Ilichevsk, continuing a wave of
unrest that began Dec. 31. Pro
testers demanding to cross the
Aras River, which borders Iran,
confronted guards who set up ar
mored personnel carriers and
trucks to blockade a bridge
