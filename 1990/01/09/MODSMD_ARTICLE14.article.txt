# Panamanian army restructured

### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) — Panama's new
security force will include specialized military units,
but they will not be big enough to threaten the
government, First Vice President Ricardo Arias Cal
deron said yesterday.
The government also said it was studying whether
it would allow the family of Manuel Antonio Noriega
safe passage to the Dominican Republic.
Foreign Minister Julio Linares said he "had passed
the request for safe conduct to the Ministry of
Government and Justice, and if there is no complaint
against them they will get consent."
Noriega's wife Felicidad, three daughters and son
in-law, a Dominican citizen, have taken refuge in
the Cuban Embassy.
Arias told reporters the security units will be
limited to a few hundred people and will not be an
army.
"Panama is a country in the crossroads of the
world and that presents several potential dangers,"
he said of the units.
Civilians in the government installed by the U.S.
invasion Dec. 20 have tried to limit the size of any
new security force to avoid danger of coups. The

armed forces ruled Panama from 1968 until Gen.
Noriega's overthrow and have been an important
political factor since Panama was founded.
Officials refer to the new security force only as
the "public force." It is being formed with members
of Noriega's old Defense Forces with advice from
U.S. officers, who said they want a professional
army to defend the Panama Canal.
In other developments, armored vehicles and
about 30 U.S. soldiers surrounded the Peruvian
ambassador's residence, more than 600 members of
the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division left Panama Mon
day and the daily La Prensa, closed nearly two
years ago by Noriega's regime, resumed publication
with an editorial that assailed the Organization of
American States and defended the U.S. invasion
that overthrew Noriega.
Mercedes Morris, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Southern Command, told The Associated Press by
telephone the surrounding of the ambassador's res
idence was taken "to prevent an individual who is
trying to escape Panamanian and U.S. justice from
leaving." She did not identify that person.
