## In favor of openness 
### 
Beyers' departure must
not result in a News
Service policy shift

THOUGH they sometimes
seem monolithic, organiza
tions are made up of indi
viduals and shaped by personalities
— by some more than others.
For 28 years, Bob Beyers has
been the dominant personality at
the Stanford News Service. But
after taking a leave of absence last
quarter, Beyers has decided to
resign from hii position with the
News Service.
If it were a simple case of Beyers
wanting a change of pace or of him
moving on to bigger and better
things, then it would be appropri
ate to just wish him well, thank
him for a job well done and hold
back our regrets. But this is not
just a simple case.
Beyers and certain administra
tion personnel — most notably
Robert Freelen, vice president for
public affairs — have been at log
gerheads for some time. The main
source of conflict has been a fun
damental difference in their beliefs
about the role of the News Service
itself.
Beyers believes that the News
Service should report the good and
the bad. He feels that the Univer
sity gains respect by openly admit
ting its own shortcomings. Largely
due to the tenacity with which
Beyers has followed this policy, the
Stanford News Service has gained
a national reputation for its open
ness.
Freelen and other administra
tors in the Public Affairs Office
and the Legal Office emphasize the
News Service's public relations
function and thus believe that the
News Service should focus more

on Stanford's successes.
At the height of the conflict, the
dialogue between Freelen and
Beyers has been primarily through
the impersonal memo.
Because the News Service falls
under the jurisdiction of the Office
of Public Affairs and is financed
by the University, there are times
when reporting the news could lead
to a tendency to gloss over Stan
ford's mistakes and shortcomings.
Though Beyers will be departing,
the News Service's policy of open
ness should not leave with him.
Without a willingness to admit its
mistakes, the University cannot
make the progress it so eagerly
strives for.
Some journalists who have cov
ered Stanford and worked with
Beyers through the years feel that
open approach might fade. But if
the quality of the News Service's
reporting goes downhill, then
Beyers' leaving will surely be a
blow to the University.
The press release from the News
Service announcing Beyers' resig
nation, which failed to mention the
long-standing tension between
Beyers and administrators, may be
an ominous indication of the fu
ture path of the News Service.
However, the weekly Campus
Report discussed the conflict.
Beyers leaves behind a News
Service greatly advanced because
of his efforts, and many capable
journalists remain to continue the
strong tradition that has won the
service national awards. The News
Service has so far maintained its
straightforward approach in the
past three months under acting di
rector Eileen Walsh.
As journalists, News Service per
sonnel will strive to uphold Beyers'
standards, but to do it they will
need the cooperation of adminis
trators — especially those who hold
the purse strings.
