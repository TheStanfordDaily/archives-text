## Paper or plastic questions 
### 
THE MISTREATED, under
privileged question mark. Every
one seems to ignore it.
Of course people still care about big
questions such as: "Will Noriega get a
fair trial?" or "Can Eastern Europe keep
up the momentum?"
Yes, these are all the big topics of the
hour. But what about the little questions
which get lost in the shuffle?
Surely you've been asked 20 million
times (or six and two-thirds million
times) "How was your break?" and "What
are you taking?" But does anyone really
care about the answers?
Better yet, do you ever really consider
what you reply? For example someone
might ask "How was break?" You answer
"Fine." But in actuality, you spent five
days vomiting because you had some flu
virus called A HSN3 Shanghai 11§T.
Naturally the most ignored questions
are those which appear in everyday con
versation, such as: "How are you doing?"
"Can I help you find something?" No
one really listens to these questions. We
all have our programmed responses.
"Never better." "Thank you very much,
but I'm just looking." Such phrases allow
us to ignore trivial matters. After all, we
are busy Stanford students.
Unfortunately, not all common ques
tions should be so carelessly tossed aside.
Take for example the simple question
the bagger at the supermarket asks you:
"Paper or plastic?"
I once believed, in all my naivete, that
paper is always the correct choice. Every
one knows plastic isn't biodegradable,
and besides, factories pollute the air with

all those nasty chemicals when they make
plastic.
In fact, I was so secure with my re
sponse, I'd usually add some snide
remark like "Paper, of course" or "Don't
you know plastic is bad for the environ
ment?" Well, the day came when a clerk
was clever enough to answer back: "We
only use biodegradable plastic."
Biodegradable plastic? Sounds like
"low-calorie ice cream" or "tuition
decrease," just one of those things that's
too good to be true. So I did a little
research, and I found out that some su
permarkets do use biodegradable plastic.
Apparently "biodegradable" a legal
term, so if something will decc pose in
some arbitrary time, say 200,0 years,
it can be considered biodegradable.
I'm not sure the exact lengtii of time
required Tor plastic* but it still seems we
would all be smothered in Zip-loc baggies
before any of it starts decomposing.
Then a look into Omni magazine a
couple months ago revealed that in some
areas it takes so much water to make
paper bags that plastic may be the ecologi
cally sound choice. To be honest, I don't
know enough about the production of
paper or plastic to make an educated
decision, but I let my conscience guide
me to use paper.
The important thing is that I always
ignored the question until that super
market clerk challenged my response.
So nowadays I give all questions a
chance. Over break I went up to many
unsuspecting people in the shopping
malls. I went up to everyone wearing a
fur coat and said: "Do you realize you

are an animal killer?" Almost everyone
ignored me.
I only asked it to raise consciousness.
It's so easy to avoid considering issues.
Because a person does not physically have
to strangle 20 minks and skin them, that
person can forget that death is necessary
to make a fur coat.
I claim the reason we forget these
sacrifices is that we ignore many ' f t';e
simple questions in our life.
Recently, when someone asks me how
I'm doing, I think about it for a second
and then answer. Sure, I still have four
or five set answers like "dandy" or "not
so great," but at least my reply ap
proximates how I actually am.
Maybe it would help if we all treated
our brain as a muscle and used these
questions like "How are you doing?" and
"Is there something wrong?" as warm-up
exercises for the really tough questions
like "What is Joyce's idea of scrupulous
meanness?" or "Do I really need this fur
coat?"
Then the question mark could recover
some of its waning respect.

all those nasty chemicals when they make
plastic.
In fact, I was so secure with my re
sponse, I'd usually add some snide
remark like "Paper, of course" or "Don't
you know plastic is bad for the environ
ment?" Well, the day came when a clerk
was clever enough to answer back: "We
only use biodegradable plastic."
Biodegradable plastic? Sounds like
"low-calorie ice cream" or "tuition
decrease," just one of those things that's
too good to be true. So I did a little
research, and I found out that some su
permarkets do use biodegradable plastic.
Apparently "biodegradable" a legal
term, so if something will decc pose in
some arbitrary time, say 200,0 years,
it can be considered biodegradable.
I'm not sure the exact lengtii of time
required Tor plastic* but it still seems we
would all be smothered in Zip-loc baggies
before any of it starts decomposing.
Then a look into Omni magazine a
couple months ago revealed that in some
areas it takes so much water to make
paper bags that plastic may be the ecologi
cally sound choice. To be honest, I don't
know enough about the production of
paper or plastic to make an educated
decision, but I let my conscience guide
me to use paper.
The important thing is that I always
ignored the question until that super
market clerk challenged my response.
So nowadays I give all questions a
chance. Over break I went up to many
unsuspecting people in the shopping
malls. I went up to everyone wearing a
fur coat and said: "Do you realize you

are an animal killer?" Almost everyone
ignored me.
I only asked it to raise consciousness.
It's so easy to avoid considering issues.
Because a person does not physically have
to strangle 20 minks and skin them, that
person can forget that death is necessary
to make a fur coat.
I claim the reason we forget these
sacrifices is that we ignore many ' f t';e
simple questions in our life.
Recently, when someone asks me how
I'm doing, I think about it for a second
and then answer. Sure, I still have four
or five set answers like "dandy" or "not
so great," but at least my reply ap
proximates how I actually am.
Maybe it would help if we all treated
our brain as a muscle and used these
questions like "How are you doing?" and
"Is there something wrong?" as warm-up
exercises for the really tough questions
like "What is Joyce's idea of scrupulous
meanness?" or "Do I really need this fur
coat?"
Then the question mark could recover
some of its waning respect.
