# Investigation over, Pi Phis cleared
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
The suspension of the Pi Beta
Phi sorority has been retracted
after nearly a two-month-long in
vestigation, but a decision about
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity
suspension has still not been
reached.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Mi
chael Hughes said yesterday that
the Pi Phis were "not responsible
for any negligence" at their party
on Oct. 14. The decision to lift
the suspension was made by Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons
after reviewing Hughes' final
report on the party, which was
submitted last month.
The Pi Phis were suspended
Oct. 17 pending an investigation
into alcohol-related incidents fol
lowing the party.
Hughes based his report on in
terviews with sorority members,
the three students involved in the
incidents and the manager of En

cina Station, a campus eating fa
cility where the party was held.
At 12:45 a.m. during the party,
police found two seniors, a male
and a female, outside in the
bushes in "a very intoxicated con
dition . . . so the police had them
transported to the hospital and
issued citations," according to
Hughes' report on the incident.
Later that evening, another stu
dent entered the party and was
served beer even though she was
under age. She was not sure
whether "the bartender was spe
cifically serving her the beer or
if she was just lucky and had a
beer pushed in her direction,"
Hughes reported.
"It is the individual students
involved in [these] incidents who
must be held accountable for the
consequences of their decisions re
garding alcohol usage rather than
the sorority as a collective group,"
Hughes wrote in his report.
Pi Phi president Pyeatt Gravely
was not available for comment
yesterday, and other Pi Phi mem
bers would not talk with The
Daily about the decision.
The Phi Delts were suspended
pending investigation of a Sept.
29 accident in which an intox
icated freshman was hit by a truck
after reportedly leaving a Phi Delt
party held earlier that evening.
Hughes submitted the findings
of his investigation Oct. 27, but
his report had to be revised. He
resubmitted the report in Novem
ber and said yesterday he was
"not real sure" why a decision
was not released before winter
break.
The report now lies in the
hands of Lyons, who was away
from campus yesterday.
