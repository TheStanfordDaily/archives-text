## Columnist divides America into black and white 
### 
WHILE I applaud the effort of
Cheryl Taylor to remember
one of America's greatest
heroes in her Monday column, the
manner in which she divides this
country into its black and white com
ponents remains disturbing.
The Boston murder/suicide case can
be interpreted quite differently if one
ignores the headlines and looks slightly
deeper.
While most of the circumstances
remain quite murky, one fact remains
clear. The police in this case did not
stop investigation when they found
their politically acceptable "black
scapegoat."
I have even read one account that
theorized that the white brother of the

The world of Martin Luther King Jr. is not one where
fists are shaken and fingers are pointed. It is a world
where hands are clasped in friendship and their color
makes no difference.

husband felt guilty when this black
man was charged and that he brought
evidence that incriminated his own
brother to the police.
The charge that times have not
changed in the last 35 years seems
impossible to accept. In fact, the ac
tions of the misdirected police in this
case were unwise and unacceptable but
quite understandable when you realize

that they were under a great deal of
political pressure to draw conclusions
and act quickly.
Decisions made in haste are often
mistaken.
It has been validated by experience
that civil rights are often violated in
the hasty search for truth, and for
that reason the FBI is to be applauded

in their careful search for a suspect in
the mail bombings that have occurred
recently. These cowardly attacks are
not just racially motivated homicide,
they are attacks meant to intimidate
the entire judicial system.
The bombings were meant to
provoke a knee-jerk response, and one
can only hope this type of response
will not occur. It seems unwise and
unfair to accuse the FBI of inaction in
this case at this point in time.
The world of Martin Luther King Jr.
is not one where fists are shaken and
fingers are pointed. It is a world where
hands are clasped in friendship and
their color makes no difference.
