We are long-time season ticket
holders to California football games.
However, the Big Game held on No
vember 18, 1989 will probably be the
last game we attend at Stanford —
unless the University changes its alco
holic beverage policy.
A college football game should be a
fun family event. That's what we ex
pected when we brought our 8-year-old
son to Big Game.
The fun ceased when our child was
hit in the back by a large-size un
opened beer can during the game.
Luckily for us and the University, he
wasn't severely wounded. However, he
experienced pain that brought him to
tears, and our day was ruined by the
incident.
We read with interest in The San

Francisco Chronicle about the student
who required 13 stitches as a result of
being hit with a beer can at Big Game.
The policy on alcoholic beverages is
leaving the University open to mtgor
lawsuits, not to mention bad public
relations.
We hope this policy is changed before
anyone else is injured.
