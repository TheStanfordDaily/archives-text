# Beyers refused to compromise integrity and will be missed
## 
### 
Back in the days of the Vietnam
War, police in full riot gear were a
regular sight on this campus and half
of the first-floor windows of University
buildings were broken.
Mass rallies were organized by both
students and University officials, with
charges and counter-charges flying back

and forth.
It could not have been easy to report
fully and objectively on the events of
this period, but Bob Beyers at the
Stanford News Service managed to do
it. He was usually in the center of the
greatest activity, sometimes in actual
Ehysical danger, but always impertur
able.
Although the University paid his
salary, no one ever doubted his
honesty, his accuracy or his fairness.
Apparently these qualities are now
responsible for his having to leave
Stanford.
According to a report by John Bur
ness, vice president of university rela
tions at Cornell University, Beyers
"appears to be mired in a culture of
independence and to take a black-and
white, absolutist approach to questions
about how the news service should
operate."
Translated from the double-speak,
this means only that Beyers is totally
committed to journalistic integrity and
refuses to fudge the news for anyone.
The fact that a University official com

plained, "When he comes into my of
fice I turn over everything on the
desk," says more about Stanford today
than about Bob Beyers, and makes it
all the sadder that he is leaving.
