## Mem Chu organ program set back by quake 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer 
In the frightening stillness that
followed the October 17 earth
quake, Kimberly Marshall did
what any mother would do: She
rushed to rescue her babies, Mur
ray Harris and Charles Fisk.
"You hear about mothers run
ning into burning buildings to
save their babies," Marshall
laughed. "So after the Big One,
the University organist hops on
her bike and makes a bee line for
the church."
Marshall, director of Stanford's
organ program, was worried
about damage to Stanford's two
giant organs. After all, the Murray
Harris organ, built in 1901, had
barely survived the 1906 quake
that leveled much of the campus.
"You can talk about the cost of
replacing these organs, but
they're works of art," Marshall
said. "It's like talking about how
much it would cost to replace the
Mona Lisa."
As Marshall rushed up the
stairs to the organ loft, she
realized that she would have to
work quickly. "I knew they were
going to come in there and rush
me out right away," she said. "So
I said to myself, what's the quick
est way I can assess the damage?"
Heedless of the danger of after
shocks and falling rock, Marshall
turned on the motor which oper
ates the bellows and began to play.
"I went through each division
and played something quickly, and
it was really great because I
realized that there was no serious
damage."
While Marshall was checking on
the organs, Diane Hill, assistant
to the dean of Memorial Church,
had returned to the church to
make sure no one had been
trapped or injured in the sanctu
ary.

"l got there, and I heard some
one playing the organ," Hill
recalls. "I went into the sanctuary
and looked up in the loft and there
was Kimberly." Concerned about
the organist's safety — and per
haps her sanity — Hill called out,
"Kimberly, what are you doing?"
"The Fisk is fine!" came down
the shouted reply.
While the Fisk organ suffered
minimal damage, the Murray M.
Harris organ was not so fortu
nate. According to Assistant Or
ganist Robert Bates, the three
largest pipes of the Murray Harris
fell over during the quake.
The Murray Harris organ is
built in two large cases which face
each other across the choir loft.
The cases, measuring 22 feet by
12 feet, together house 3,355 or
gan pipes.
Flanked by the two cases of the
Murray Harris organ, the 4,422
pipes of the Fisk organ tower
above its keyboard at the center
of the loft. This stunning new
organ, built by Stanford alumnus
and organ builder Charles B. Fisk,
was completed in 1984 at a total
cost of $1.9 million. The Fisk or
gan is equipped with an elaborate
dual-tuning system that allows
artists to perform both 16th and
18th century compositions.
An organ repairman who spent
the last several weeks closely ex
amining both organs also reported
to Bates that several of the or
gan's pipes were damaged and
would need to be repaired. "There
were a lot of dents in the pipes
when they banged into each other
during the quake," Bates said.
"Some of them are just cosmetic,
but some will change the sound
of the pipes."
Bates indicated that about one
third of the 7,777 pipes will need
to be removed and cleaned.
"These aren't severe structural
problems," he said. "All the mov

ing parts of the organ are fine."
Nevertheless, the two organs will
need to be tuned, and the total
cost of repairs could run as high
as $50,000.
Marshall said that the repairs
could take anywhere from six
months to two years.
The damage to the organs and
the structure of Memorial Church
"put the whole organ program out
of commission," Bates said. Ac

cording to Marshall, Stanford's
highly-acclaimed organ program
attracts "the finest applicants
from all over the world."
While the University organists
and their eight students await the
completion of repairs that have
not yet begun, they are able to
continue their practicing and
performances on a Fisk concert
organ built into the home of Por
tola Valley resident Jacques Lit
tlefield.

shocks and falling rock, Marshall
turned on the motor which oper
ates the bellows and began to play.
"I went through each division
and played something quickly, and
it was really great because I
realized that there was no serious
damage."
While Marshall was checking on
the organs, Diane Hill, assistant
to the dean of Memorial Church,
had returned to the church to
make sure no one had been
trapped or injured in the sanctu
ary.

"l got there, and I heard some
one playing the organ," Hill
recalls. "I went into the sanctuary
and looked up in the loft and there
was Kimberly." Concerned about
the organist's safety — and per
haps her sanity — Hill called out,
"Kimberly, what are you doing?"
"The Fisk is fine!" came down
the shouted reply.
While the Fisk organ suffered
minimal damage, the Murray M.
Harris organ was not so fortu
nate. According to Assistant Or
ganist Robert Bates, the three
largest pipes of the Murray Harris
fell over during the quake.
The Murray Harris organ is
built in two large cases which face
each other across the choir loft.
The cases, measuring 22 feet by
12 feet, together house 3,355 or
gan pipes.
Flanked by the two cases of the
Murray Harris organ, the 4,422
pipes of the Fisk organ tower
above its keyboard at the center
of the loft. This stunning new
organ, built by Stanford alumnus
and organ builder Charles B. Fisk,
was completed in 1984 at a total
cost of $1.9 million. The Fisk or
gan is equipped with an elaborate
dual-tuning system that allows
artists to perform both 16th and
18th century compositions.
An organ repairman who spent
the last several weeks closely ex
amining both organs also reported
to Bates that several of the or
gan's pipes were damaged and
would need to be repaired. "There
were a lot of dents in the pipes
when they banged into each other
during the quake," Bates said.
"Some of them are just cosmetic,
but some will change the sound
of the pipes."
Bates indicated that about one
third of the 7,777 pipes will need
to be removed and cleaned.
"These aren't severe structural
problems," he said. "All the mov

ing parts of the organ are fine."
Nevertheless, the two organs will
need to be tuned, and the total
cost of repairs could run as high
as $50,000.
Marshall said that the repairs
could take anywhere from six
months to two years.
The damage to the organs and
the structure of Memorial Church
"put the whole organ program out
of commission," Bates said. Ac

cording to Marshall, Stanford's
highly-acclaimed organ program
attracts "the finest applicants
from all over the world."
While the University organists
and their eight students await the
completion of repairs that have
not yet begun, they are able to
continue their practicing and
performances on a Fisk concert
organ built into the home of Por
tola Valley resident Jacques Lit
tlefield.
