When Timothy "Teabag"
Biglow and a few friends began
singing together as Branner
frosh, "It was just a bunch of
lonely heart bachelors." Now,
less than a decade after their
first performances, the Fleet
Street Singers are one of Stan
ford's most selective a capella
singing groups.
At the time, the Mendicants
were the only a capella group
on campus. After being turned
down by the Mendicants,
Biglow and his friends decided,
"That's it, we're starting our
own group." They modeled
themsleves after the Wiffen
poofs, a singing group at Yale
that Biglow's father had
belonged to.
The repertoire began with
old Wiffenpoof songs and has
expanded to originals such as
"Moonlight on the Quad" and
the recent re-arrangement of
the Stanford Hymn into a rap.
The group's three founders
— B'glow, Kyle Kashima and
Chris Tucci — were members
of LSJUMB and active in
Gaieties when they started
singing together informally in
1979. Biglow enjoyed acting,
"and Kyle was 'Mr. Piano
Proficiency,' so we drew on all
our talents," Biglow said.
That year, Biglow and Kas

In addition to the vocal
aspect of their performance,
the original Fleet Street mem
bers wanted to show off their
dramatic skill and humor. The
group is now well-known for
the comical interludes in their
songs.
"We had to be different in
some way," Biglow explained.
So when Fleet Street sang
for the farewell ceremonies for
Admissions Dean Fred Har
gadon in 1984, they chose "Is
tanbul" for their performance
and parodied the lyrics to fit
the occasion.
Later, they sang at Com
mencement and impressed Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy so much that he asked
them to sing for the Com
mencement dinner at his house.
Biglow recounted some of the
earlier, pre-glory days of the
group. "Oh, you wanna come
over and sing? Bring some beer
and come on over and sing."
Biglow said he is still amazed
