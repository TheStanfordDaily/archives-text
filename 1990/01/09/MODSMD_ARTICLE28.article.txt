# Fleet Street thrives on laughs and lyrics

When Timothy "Teabag"
Biglow and a few friends began
singing together as Branner
frosh, "It was just a bunch of
lonely heart bachelors." Now,
less than a decade after their
first performances, the Fleet
Street Singers are one of Stan
ford's most selective a capella
singing groups.
At the time, the Mendicants
were the only a capella group
on campus. After being turned
down by the Mendicants,
Biglow and his friends decided,
"That's it, we're starting our
own group." They modeled
themsleves after the Wiffen
poofs, a singing group at Yale
that Biglow's father had
belonged to.
The repertoire began with
old Wiffenpoof songs and has
expanded to originals such as
"Moonlight on the Quad" and
the recent re-arrangement of
the Stanford Hymn into a rap.
The group's three founders
— B'glow, Kyle Kashima and
Chris Tucci — were members
of LSJUMB and active in
Gaieties when they started
singing together informally in
1979. Biglow enjoyed acting,
"and Kyle was 'Mr. Piano
Proficiency,' so we drew on all
our talents," Biglow said.
That year, Biglow and Kas
hima arranged the Stanford
Hymn into a slow, barber shop
style. When Fleet Street "offi
cially" assembled as a singing
group two years later, they
"wanted to be Stanford's sing

'Whenever
there's four of us
together, we end
up singing — it's
borderline ob
noxious that way.'

ing group," Biglow said.
In addition to the vocal
aspect of their performance,
the original Fleet Street mem
bers wanted to show off their
dramatic skill and humor. The
group is now well-known for
the comical interludes in their
songs.
"We had to be different in
some way," Biglow explained.
So when Fleet Street sang
for the farewell ceremonies for
Admissions Dean Fred Har
gadon in 1984, they chose "Is
tanbul" for their performance
and parodied the lyrics to fit
the occasion.
Later, they sang at Com
mencement and impressed Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy so much that he asked
them to sing for the Com
mencement dinner at his house.
Biglow recounted some of the
earlier, pre-glory days of the
group. "Oh, you wanna come
over and sing? Bring some beer
and come on over and sing."
Biglow said he is still amazed
when he hears people say, "I
didn't make it into Fleet Street."
So why the name Fleet Street
Singers? The name comes from
the demon barber of Fleet Street,
a character from a Steven
Sondheim musical. The name was
meant to emphasize the group's
barber shop style.
According to Biglow, the
original group members had end
less arguments over what they
should name themselves.
"So one night we said, 'This is
it.' So we took a vote, secret ballot.
Negative one by the name if you
didn't want it. Zero if you didn't
care. Positive one if you wanted
it."
"Fleet Street Singers was the
only name with a positive score."
Today, auditions for Fleet
Street consist of two rounds, in
which the second round the stu
dent is asked to bring a joke. Ac
cording to senior Martin Puryear,
the selection process aims to "see
how (potential members) blend in.
It's more of a group sound."
Puryear, who directed Fleet
Street for three years, said he
feels Fleet Street's competitive
ness and success hasn't
diminished the comradery that
existed in the group's earlier
years.
"We're just a group of guys,

and we try to make the best music
we can," said Puryear.
"It's just a love of singing," he
said. "Whenever there's four of
us together, we end up singing —
it*B borderline obnoxious that way.
According to Puryear, group
members used to play a game of
"song tag" whenever they saw«
each other at parties or around
campus. "You'd tag someone at a
party, and they'd have to sing
their part."
Fleet Street's first perform
ances took place in the dormitor
ies of group members' friends.
"We had to adopt a philosophy of
'give, and you shall receive,' " said
Biglow. So the group offered free
concerts to any audience willing
to listen.
Now the group is part of the
National Centennial Celebration
(NCC), the drive to raise money
for the Centennial Celebration in
1991. Group members spend
weekends in various parts of the
country performing at fund
raising functions.
Puryear affirms Biglow's desire
that the group be Stanford
oriented. "Teabag and Kyle ar
ranged tons of Stanford songs —
some songs that people don't even
know,"he said. "We're always
learning Stanford songs."
The "Stanford Hymn Rap," a
performance that characterizes
the group's combination of music
and comedy, is used at University
events such as Frosh Orientation,
NCC functions and Big Game.
