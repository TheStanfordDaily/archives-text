## Irish fight past Cardinal Buddie, Perry capture top honors at Doc Petersen 
### Greg Gottesman Editorial staff 
Stanford wrestlers came back to the
Farm with a vengeance, almost playing
David against a Goliath Notre Dame team
and later placing nine wrestlers in the Doc
Petersen Open at Chico State last weekend.
This past Friday the Cardinal lost to a
heavily-favored Fighting Irish team, 19-16.
The home meet was deadlocked at 16 going
into the final match. But heavyweight
Trent Smith was outmanned — or, more
specifically, outweighed — as he lost a 7-2
decision to Notre Dame's Chuck Weaver.
Unlike Stanford, which gives no wres
tling scholarships, Notre Dame's wrestling
program has money — and lots of it. "They
are the most affluent program in the coun
try. Every wrestler on their team is en
dowed," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said.
Wins by Ron Perry (190 lbs.), Steve
Buddie (177 lbs.) and a mfyor decision by
Dave Sacks (134 lbs.) highlighted the Car
dinal's performance.
"We were the extreme underdog — kind
of like the football team," Horpel said.
"But we came close. It's disappointing be
cause several matches could have gone
either way. I thought we did really well
just to push them the way we did."

mental wounds Stanford was feeling after
the disappointing loss to Notre Dame.
Buddie and Perry won their respective
divisions, while Josh Lisle (126 lbs.)
finished second. In the finals of the 177
lbs. division, Buddie squared off against
an uncommon foe, teammate and friend
Steve Yarbrough. Yarbrough, who is not
offically wrestling with the team this year,
entered the tournament as an "unattached"
wrestler. Buddie won the duel 11-4.
Stanford had two fourth-place winners,
James Dinette (142 lbs.) and Sacks. In
addition, Mark Graham (167 lbs.) and
Smith garnered fifth-place finishes, while
Matt Topham (158 lbs.) grabbed sixth.
According to Horpel, Graham "probably
would have been a finalist," but a knee
injury forced him to default from compe
tition.
"All in all, it was a great weekend. People
are pretty psyched," Horpel said. "We did
have some injuries, but I'm hoping to be
at 100 percent [before next weekend's meets
begin]."
