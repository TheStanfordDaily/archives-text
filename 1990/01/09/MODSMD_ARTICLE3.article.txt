# One flasher caught, burglars still sought
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Stanford Police had their hands
full with the usual burglaries and
break-ins over vacation, but they
achieved a victory with the iden
tification of a suspected campus
flasher.
A suspect in the series of in
decent exposures on campus and
in Palo Alto over the past few
months was identified and inter
viewed in late December, accord
ing to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
The suspect's name and other
information could not be released
because the suspect has not yet
been formally charged. Niemeyer
said the case will probably be sent
to the district attorney sometime
later this week.
Niemeyer said the suspect was
caught after exposing himself to

a woman while riding by Meyer
Library on his bicycle Dec. 20.
A few minutes earlier, the
suspect rode by a woman in White
Plaza and made "suggestive com
ments" to her, according to a
police report.
In all, at least 20 incidents of
indecent exposure have occurred
on campus since August. Most of
these incidents took place on
bicycle paths in more isolated
parts of campus.
It is possible that more than
one person has been responsible
for the incidents, according to
Niemeyer.
The suspect in the Dec 20 in
cident fit the description of the
perpetrator of several of the other
indecent exposures, Niemeyer
said, and officers detained him at
the scene.
