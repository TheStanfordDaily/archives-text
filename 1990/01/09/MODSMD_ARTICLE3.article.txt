# One flasher caught, burglars still sought
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Stanford Police had their hands
full with the usual burglaries and
break-ins over vacation, but they
achieved a victory with the iden
tification of a suspected campus
flasher.
A suspect in the series of in
decent exposures on campus and
in Palo Alto over the past few
months was identified and inter
viewed in late December, accord
ing to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
The suspect's name and other
information could not be released
because the suspect has not yet
been formally charged. Niemeyer
said the case will probably be sent
to the district attorney sometime
later this week.
Niemeyer said the suspect was
caught after exposing himself to

a woman while riding by Meyer
Library on his bicycle Dec. 20.
A few minutes earlier, the
suspect rode by a woman in White
Plaza and made "suggestive com
ments" to her, according to a
police report.
In all, at least 20 incidents of
indecent exposure have occurred
on campus since August. Most of
these incidents took place on
bicycle paths in more isolated
parts of campus.
It is possible that more than
one person has been responsible
for the incidents, according to
Niemeyer.
The suspect in the Dec 20 in
cident fit the description of the
perpetrator of several of the other
indecent exposures, Niemeyer
said, and officers detained him at
the scene.
However, the women were un
able to identify him positively, and
there was not enough evidence to
arrest the suspect at that time,
according to Niemeyer.
The suspect was asked to come
in for an interview, in which he
admitted to committing several of
the indecent exposures reported.
According to police records,
there were two other possibly
related incidents earlier in Decem
ber.
On Dec. 13, a man fitting the
suspect's description exposed him
self to a woman near Lake Lagu
nita. On Dec. 9, a man on a bicycle
stopped and made lewd remarks
to a woman sitting near the foun
tain in front of Memorial Audito
rium.

Police were also busy handling
11 dorm burglaries, six vehicle
burglaries, 12 bicycle thefts and
three scooter thefts during vaca
tion.
A series of burglaries occurred
at three houses in the Cowell
Cluster. The police have some
leads and potential suspects in
these burglaries, Niemeyer said.
However, no details were avail
able.
Craig Mallery, a resident assis
tant at Alpha Sigma, said six two
room doubles and one single were
burglarized.
More than 100 compact disks
and a radio were among the items
stolen from the Alpha Sig house,
according to Mallery. In several
of the rooms, nothing had been
stolen but items within the room
had been disturbed.
Mallery said the windows in
these rooms had been tampered
with and were probably used to

enter the rooms. He also said he
believed that the burglars were
looking for specific items for their
personal use, as many valuable
things were not taken.
At least one room was broken
into in Terra House. Carl Yee, a
senior and a resident in Terra,
said his compact disc player,
guitar, camera and binoculars
were stolen.
Yee also remarked that some of
these items later turned up in the
Alpha Sig house.
Yee said he also felt that the
thieves were looking for items for
their personal use. As an example,
he said his roommate's
rollerblades were taken, while his
were not.
A break-in was also reported at
the ZAP house, but no one could
be reached for comment.
Burglaries were also reported
at the Alpha Delt House and the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
