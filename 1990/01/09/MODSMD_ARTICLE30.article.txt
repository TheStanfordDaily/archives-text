# TV basketball provides last-second shots — and fills time slots

Cable television is evil.
Now, 1 have cable. I like it a lot.
But it is definitely evil.
If it weren't for cable, I could get so
much stuff done. As it is, however, I
spend my life staring at televised basket
ball. I wake up in the middle of the night
hearing Dick Vitale saying "Slam bam
jam, baby!"
Well, maybe it's not that bad. But cable
TV is the sports junkie's best friend and
worst enemy. Reason number one is Big
Monday. Last night ESPN showed
Georgetown-Pittsburgh from the Big
East, Michigan-Indiana from the Big Ten
and UNLV-New Mexico State from the
Big West.
All in a row.
Tonight ESPN will have Arkansas-
Little Rock vs. Oklahoma and Georgia-
Alabama. Tomorrow it's Big East-ACC
Wednesday with St. John's-Syracuse fol
lowed by North Carolina-Maryland. Then
there are three games on Thursday night.
And that's just on ESPN.
So when am I supposed to find time

to write this column?
Combined with broadcast TV, PSN,
WTBS and TNT's pro games, hoops
heaven makes house calls each and every
-light.
Here, for those of you not as fortunate
as I (either on-campus residents who can't
get cable or those who feel the need to
prioritize studying instead of TV) is a
collection of hoops memories from break.
Perhaps the best game over break was

the Loyola Marymount-Oregon State
game from Corvallis. Gary Payton was
unstoppable, scoring 48 for the Beavers,
but it was not enough. Bo Kimble went
for 54 points for the Lions, giving them
a four-point upset in a hostile arena.
Loyola Marymount did this with the
nation's leading scorer and leading re
bounder from last year on the sidelines.
Hank Gathers, who scored 34 points and
pulled down 13 rebounds a game last
year, missed two games after passing out
on the free throw line against UC-Santa
Barbara.
Kimble, who played with Gathers in
high school, at USC for a year and at
LMU for three years after transfering,
basically decided, "If my buddy led the
nation in scoring last year, why can't I
do it this year?"
He is so far, scoring 38 a game.
Another thought: The LMU-La Salle
contest brought together three of
Philadelphia's best in their home
town. The Explorers' Lionel Simmons

lost to Kimble and Gathers' Dobbins Tech
team in the city championship four years
ago. The three were reunited in Philly's
Civic Center for the game and scored 91
points in the 121-116 Lion win. Simmons,
the greatest player no one had ever heard
of last year, is now one of the best players
a lot of people have heard of. Proving
that even the great ones aren't perfect,
Simmons airballed three free throws in
the second half. In fact, one of them
didn't even reach the bottom of the net.
Perhaps it was because Simmons
played every minute of the super-fast
run-and- gun game. In fact, Simmons
has played all but six minutes through
nine games. That's 354 of 360 minutes.
Does anyone believe what's going
on at Indiana? So freshman
Lawrence Funderburke quit.
Frosh Calbert Cheaney has led the team
in scoring in seven games already. Fresh
men and sophomores have scored 89 per
cent of the Hoosiers' points, have pulled
down 88 percent of their rebounds and

have 80 percent 0 f the team's assists.
Indiana trailed No. 3 Michigan by as
much as 20 points last night and the
game looked over only eight minutes in.
Indiana came back, however, winning by
a pair.
I guess one staple of this type of
column is the "so-and-so is the
greatest player you've never seen."
Here's my list: Elliott Perry, a.k.a. The
Frogman, of Memphis State: He never
met a shot he didn't like — or couldn't
make. Lee Mayberry and Todd Day,
Arkansas: Mayberry runs the offense at
100 mph and never turns the ball over,
while Day is a 6-foot-8 (and still growing)
off guard who can dribble, drive and shoot
from downtown. Kenny Anderson, Geor
gia Tech: The freshman will score 2000
points and break the NCAA career assists
record the way he's going. Anthony Dade,
Louisiana Tech: Following in the foot
steps of Karl Malone arid Randy White
at Tech, Dade is a 6-7 power forward
who socres — A lot.
