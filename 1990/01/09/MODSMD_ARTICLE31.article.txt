# NCAA alters scholarship rule
## 
### 
DALLAS (AP) - The NCAA
rescinded the stringent scholar
ship requirement of Proposition
42 Monday but kept the heart of
its academic rules for incoming
athletes.
By a 258-66-1 vote, delegates
decided to allow freshmen who can
only partially meet academic
standards to earn regular school
scholarship aid — but not athletic
scholarships.
Proposition 42, which prompted
Georgetown basketball coach
John Thompson to boycott two
games last season after its ap
proval, would have banned all
scholarship money beginning Aug.
1 for freshman athletes who meet
only part of the grade-point
average and test score minimums
created three years ago by
Proposition 48.
The 84th annual convention
still must deal with the meat of
its main theme — beginning a
reform of college athletics by em
phasizing books over blocking.
UCLA chancellor Charles
Young told the delegates that the
Proposition 42 modification will
"retain the academic incentives
without the potential devastating
financial side effects."
The convention spent 85
minutes wrangling over amend
ments to the wording of the pro
posal, called Proposition 26, then
voted without debate on the main
issue when Division I vice presi
dent B.J. Skelton, the chairman
of the session, cut off discussions
abruptly.

After the vote, black academic
leaders, who claim the reliance on
standardized test scores discrim

inate against underpriviliged and
minority students, said they
would try again next year to res
tore athletic scholarships.
"A half loaf is better than noth
ing," Edward Fort, chancellor at
North Carolina A&T University,
said after the vote. "The powers
that-be (in the NCAA) are deathly
afraid that something will happen
to denigrate Proposition 48."
Delegates also voted down a
proposal to repeal Proposition 42
altogether.
Penn State football coach Joe
Paterno said total repeal "would
be taking one big step backward."
"I've been in the field for 40
years, and I know what has hap
pened since Proposition 48. Kids
are better prepared academically,"
Paterno told the convention.
Voters also flip-flopped Monday
on a plan to allow students to
earn back the year of athletic
eligibility lost by not meeting
Proposition 48's standards. The
convention first approved award
ing a fourth year of athletic
eligibility to students who earn
about 80 percent of their college
credits by their fifth academic
year.
But after complaints that the
plan undercut Proposition 48, it
was defeated on a second vote.
Delegates also voted Monday to
keep the number of football schol
arships a Division I-A team can
award annually at 25, despite an
appeal from Nebraska football
coach Tom Osborne to return it
to 30.
That 26-80-3 vote retains a
cost-cutting measure passed two
years ago that dropped the schol

arship number. Schools still can't
exceed the 95-player limit.
Osborne said the change would
have allowed schools short of
players to catch up more quickly
and would have promoted a better
caliber of competition.
"It's better for attendance and
television," Osborne said.
The NCAA still must vote on
propositions designed to give ath
letes more time for education.
Those measures include
whether to publish schools' grad
uation rates for athletes, shorten
spring football practice, cut the
basketball season by three games
to 25 and curtail preseason tour
naments.
In addition, delegates have to
decide whether to increase
penalties for drug use, including
steroids, and institute year-round
testing and whether to allow
scholarship awards for summer
school for incoming freshmen.
Proposition 42 would have
denied scholarship money to in
coming athletes who have a C
average in high school but do not
meet the two other academic re
quirements of Proposition 48 —
a C-average in 11 core courses
and minimum scores on standard
ized college entrance exams.
Currently, "partial qualifiers"
still can receive athletic scholar
ships, although they are not eli
gible for practice or competition.
About 600 "partial qualifiers"
have received athletic scholarships
in the three years since Proposi
tion 48 was adopted.

"A half loaf is better than noth
ing," Edward Fort, chancellor at
North Carolina A&T University,
said after the vote. "The powers
that-be (in the NCAA) are deathly
afraid that something will happen
to denigrate Proposition 48."
Delegates also voted down a
proposal to repeal Proposition 42
altogether.
Penn State football coach Joe
Paterno said total repeal "would
be taking one big step backward."
"I've been in the field for 40
years, and I know what has hap
pened since Proposition 48. Kids
are better prepared academically,"
Paterno told the convention.
Voters also flip-flopped Monday
on a plan to allow students to
earn back the year of athletic
eligibility lost by not meeting
Proposition 48's standards. The
convention first approved award
ing a fourth year of athletic
eligibility to students who earn
about 80 percent of their college
credits by their fifth academic
year.
But after complaints that the
plan undercut Proposition 48, it
was defeated on a second vote.
Delegates also voted Monday to
keep the number of football schol
arships a Division I-A team can
award annually at 25, despite an
appeal from Nebraska football
coach Tom Osborne to return it
to 30.
That 26-80-3 vote retains a
cost-cutting measure passed two
years ago that dropped the schol

arship number. Schools still can't
exceed the 95-player limit.
Osborne said the change would
have allowed schools short of
players to catch up more quickly
and would have promoted a better
caliber of competition.
"It's better for attendance and
television," Osborne said.
The NCAA still must vote on
propositions designed to give ath
letes more time for education.
Those measures include
whether to publish schools' grad
uation rates for athletes, shorten
spring football practice, cut the
basketball season by three games
to 25 and curtail preseason tour
naments.
In addition, delegates have to
decide whether to increase
penalties for drug use, including
steroids, and institute year-round
testing and whether to allow
scholarship awards for summer
school for incoming freshmen.
Proposition 42 would have
denied scholarship money to in
coming athletes who have a C
average in high school but do not
meet the two other academic re
quirements of Proposition 48 —
a C-average in 11 core courses
and minimum scores on standard
ized college entrance exams.
Currently, "partial qualifiers"
still can receive athletic scholar
ships, although they are not eli
gible for practice or competition.
About 600 "partial qualifiers"
have received athletic scholarships
in the three years since Proposi
tion 48 was adopted.
