OAKLAND (AP) - Depite the
presence of former Stanford guard
Todd "The God" Lichti, the Den
ver Nuggets came up short against
the Golden State Warriors last
night.
Led by Mitch Richmond's
season-high 32 points and forward
Chris Mullin's 30, the Warriors
pulled off a 139-122 victory over
the Nuggets in Oakland.
Rookie guard Tim Hardaway
added 19 points, 10 rebounds and
19 assists as the Warriors won
their fourth straight. Michael
Adams led the Nuggets with 26

Playing without Coach Doug
Moe, who was back in Denver
recovering from the flu, the Nug
gets trailed by one at halftime.
The lead exchanged hands several
times before the Warriors scored
the last 14 points of the third
quarter to take a 103-94 lead into
the final 12 minutes.
A 17-foot jumper by Mullin gave
the Warriors a 116-105 lead with
8:43 remaining. Hardaway then
canned a layup and Golden State
was up 129-111 with 4:58 left in
the game.
Adams had 21 points in the first

half but was unable to find his
range after intermission.
Lafayette Lever paced the Nug
gets' second-half effort with 13
points and finished with 25.
Rookie Lichti added 10 points
in his second and final appearance
in the Bay Area during the 1989-
90 season. Lichti, who graduated
last spring as Stanford's all-time
leading scorer, led the Cardinal
to a second-place Pacific 10 Con
ference finish and the squad's
first appearance in the NCAA
tournament in 49 years last
season.
