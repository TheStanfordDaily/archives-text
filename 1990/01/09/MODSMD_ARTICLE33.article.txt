### Greg Gottesman Editorial staff 
On the strength of its second
place finish in the last year's
NCAA championships and its
preseason victories over powers
such as UCLA and Hawaii, the
Stanford men's volleyball team
garnered the No. 1 ranking in
both an NCAA and a Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Asso
ciation (WIVA) coaches' poll.
"It's a really nice honor for
the program," Stanford Coach
Fred Sturm said. "It's basically
a reflection of our preseason
performances."
In the preseason, Stanford
topped No. 2-ranked UCLA in
an exhibition match and man
handled No. 3-ranked Hawaii
four straight times.
Despite the top ranking,
Sturm said he did not think the
seeding would affect his team's

play. "The ranking should not
affect us that much. It's how we
practice and train each day
which will really determine how
successful we are," Sturm said.
"Part of becoming a top team
is understanding that you have
to prove yourself each time you
step onto the court."
Sturm added, "Besides, I
think the players understand
that it's not where you start the
season but where you end the
season in the rankings which is
really more important."
The WIVA has split into two
divisions this season, with
teams playing each squad in
their respective division twice
and teams in the opposite divi
sion once. "It got to where there
was just too many teams [in the
WIVA division]," Sturm ex
plained.
This season Stanford will join
Hawaii, Long Beach State, USC,

Loyola Marymount and San
Diego State to form the Harry
Wilson Division. UCLA, last
year's NCAA champion, will
compete in the other section,
the Burt DeGroot Division.
The top three teams in each
division will advance to the
WTVA Tournament April 26-28.
In the WIVA coaches' poll,
Stanford received 64 points and
seven first-place votes, enough
to place first ahead of Hawaii
and Long Beach State in the
Harry Wilson division. Stanford
also edged UCLA for the overall
No. 1 ranking in the WTVA, cap
turing 24 points and five first
place votes. UCLA had 22 points
and three first-place votes.
Along with UCLA, other
members of the Burt DeGroot
Division include Pepperdine,
UC-Santa Barbara, Brigham
Young, CSU-Northridge and
UC-Irvine.
