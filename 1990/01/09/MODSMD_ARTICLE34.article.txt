LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -
Kentucky football players were
not lamenting the departure of
Coach Bill Curry from Ala
bama. They were glad to have
him as their own.
"I'm delighted he's here,"
quarterback Freddie Maggard
said. "He's their loss and our
gain. I'm sure not crying about
it for them. I'm happy about
it."
Curry, who resigned at Ala
bama on Sunday, was named
Kentucky's coach on Monday
night after a vote by the Uni
veristy of Kentucky Athletic
Association Board of Directors.
He replaces Jerry Claiborne,
who retired Nov. 28 after eight
seasons with the Wildcats.
"He's one of the finest
coaches in the country, not only
in Alabama, but in the United
States," cornerback Chris Tol
bert said.

Curry spoke to the team for
about 45 minutes on Monday
before formally accepting the
job.
"He told us what he expected
of us to be a championship
team," flanker Steve Phillips
said. "He told us we need to
care about our fellow team
mates. Everybody was feeling
excited when he gave his
speech.
"He had us writing down
things about our faith and fam
ily, and he talked about
priorities in education and foot
ball."
Linebacker Randy Holleran
said, "He brought a lot of ex
citement."
Curry also told the players
that one of the reasons he left
Alabama was because he felt
his players there were under
undue pressure because of his
presence.
