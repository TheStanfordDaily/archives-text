# Voorsanger captures all-around at Open
## Forman, Loop leave meet with injuries 
### Patrick Tower 
"Inspiring."
That was the way teammate
Jair Lynch summed up Conrad
Voorsanger's performance at the
Spartan Open gymnastics meet
Friday and Saturday at San Jose
State.
Voorsanger showed that he was
clearly the class of the meet as
he dominated the all-around com
petition, winning the event by
over eight points. He also took
top honors on the floor exercise
and parallel bars at the seven
team meet.
While most of the gymnasts at
the meet were checking the early
season progress of their routines,
the Cardinal co-captain was
showing the form which has
earned him the No. 2 ranking in
the United States.
"I've been training for compe
tition for a year and three months
because of Nationals and Worlds.
That made a big difference, espe
cially in the compulsories,"
Voorsanger said.
Meanwhile, freshmen Jeff
Bender and Lynch, competing in
Stanford uniforms for the first
time, had promising showings as
well. Bender placed second on the
pommel horse, and Lynch finished

third on the pommel horse and
fourth on the high bar.
"Jair could have won both
events, but he made some slight
mistakes," Coach Sadao Hamada
said. "If he can avoid the mis
takes, no one can beat him on
pommel horse."
Tim Wang also performed well,
turning in strong performances
on the parallel bars and floor ex
ercise. In addition, Tim Ryan's
high bar routine was considered
the most difficult at the meet.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal
squad, these bright spots were ac
companied by injuries. Adam For
man suffered a knee injury,
perhaps serious enough to keep
him out of action for the rest of
the season.
Charles Loop also sustained an
injury. After making the finals on
the parallel bars and high bar,
Loop ii\jured his back on his high
bar dismount and was forced to
withdraw from the meet. But, ac
cording to Hamada, Loop should
be back in action soon.
"It was really a rough meet be
cause our main goal was to avoid
getting injured," Voorsanger said.
"It will put more pressure on
others to pick up the slack, but
this could still be one of the
strongest Stanford teams ever."
