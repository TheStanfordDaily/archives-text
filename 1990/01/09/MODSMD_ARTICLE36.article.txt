# Schembechler leaves Michigan for baseball

### 
DETROIT (AP) - Bo Schem
bechler, who earned fame as the
hot-tempered football coach at
Michigan, will now devote his
organization skills to baseball.
The 60-year-old Schembechler,
who finished with the fifth-best
Division I-A college coaching
record in history (234-65-8), will
become president of the Detroit
Tigers baseball club early this
week, according to a team offi
cial.
The official announcement
could come as early as today,
but may be held up until mid
week, according to the official
who called it"the worst-kept se
cret in town."
Schembechler, who wrapped
up a 27-year football coaching
career in Michigan's 17-10 loss
in the Rose Bowl last week, will
resign as Michigan's athletic di
rector and succeed Jim Campbell
as chief executive officer of the
Tigers.
As Michigan coach and athletic
director, Schembechler was in
charge of an $18 million budget,
nearly $8 million of which was
produced by football. He also
raised nearly $12 million for a
nearly-completed football build
ing to be called the Center of

Champions.
It was those organizational
skills which made Schembechler
attractive to the Tigers.
"When I first came here
(following graduation from Ohio
State in 1949), one guy did
everything," said Campbell, who
will be 66 in February.
"Baseball's not that way any
more. When you walk into a
league meeting, you're lucky if
you recognize three people any
more. All the departments are
specialized now.
"The key element to this job
now is organization."
The appointment would make
Schembechler the 12th president
of the Tigers since the franchise
entered the American League as
a charter member in 1901.
A high-ranking Tiger official,
who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said Campbell will
remain and become chairman of
the board, replacing John E. Fet
zer, who will become chairman
emeritus.
Schembechler could not be
reached for comment. Coaches
said he had left his office and
calls to his home went un
answered Sunday.
But he said the day after the

Rose Bowl loss to Southern Cal
ifornia that he would continue
to live in Ann Arbor.
"I will never be far away from
Michigan," Schembechler said.
"I will always be available for
consultation. I will forever be a
Michigan man."
Tigers owner Tom Monaghan,
who bought the club from Fetzer
in 1984, named Schembechler to
the team's six-member Board of
Directors on Jan. 12, 1989. He
is a board member of Domino's
Pizza Inc., which is also owned
by Monaghan.
Schembechler became head
coach at Michigan in 1969, fol
lowing six years at Miami of
Ohio, and led the Wolverines to
a 194-48-5 record and 13 Big
Ten Conference championships.
He was named Big Ten Coach
of the Year seven times. Al
though he led Michigan to bowl
games and Top-10 national
rankings in 17 of his 21 seasons
there, Schembechler never
coached a national champion. He
selected Gary Moeller, his
longtime assistant and friend, to
succeed him as coach.
Former Wolverine fullback
Fritz Seyferth, the associate di
rector of development and

alumni relations, is likely to
succeed Schembechler as athletic
director. Seyferth, 39, played on
Schembechler's first Michigan
team, has served as recruiting
coordinator and was in charge
of raising the $12 million for
the football building.
Jack Weidenbach, senior asso
ciate director of athletics who
handled the department's day-to
day operations while Schem
bechler concentrated on football,
is expected to stay on for a few
years while Seyferth learns the
ropes.
Schembechler, who succeeded
Don Canham as Michigan ath
letic director on July 1, 1988,
has built a reputation for
morality and sticking with tough
decisions.
Schembechler made the con
troversial call to prevent
longtime basketball coach Bill
Frieder from leading the Wol
verines into the 1989 NCAA
tournament after the latter ac
cepted the coaching job at Ari
zona State.
Schembechler named assistant
Steve Fisher as interim coach
during the tournament. Under
Fisher, Michigan went 6-0.
