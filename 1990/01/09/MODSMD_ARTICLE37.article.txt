### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Although she has only swum in
one collegiate meet, freshman
Janet Evans is the recipient of
two honors awarded over break.
Evans was named the female
swimmer of the year for 1989 by
Swimming World magazine.
Evans also won the award in 1987
and was named the American
female swimmer of the year in
1988. East Germany's Kristin
Otto won the world award that
year based on her winning six
gold medals.
"I was really happy with that,"
she said. "I was surprised. .. . It's
a great honor."
Evans was also selected a
finalist for the country's most
prestigious amateur athletic
award, the James E. Sullivan
Memorial Award. Evans is one of
the 10 finalists for the award for
the third straight year.
"I'm just real happy to be a
finalist again," she said. "It's a
real honor. It's great just to go to
the banquet and meet the other
finalists. To be considered in the
same category as them â€” that's
neat."
The other finalists for the 1989
award are speedskater Bonnie
Blair, gymnast Brandy Johnson,
rower Kristin Karlson, hurdler
Roger Kingdom, canoeist John
Lugbill, skier Tamara McKinney,

pentathlete Lori Norwood,
wrestler John Smith and diver
Wendy Lian Williams.
Evans could have taken her
Olympic success and converted it
into endorsement money, but she
decided to retain her amateur
status. "I think it had to do with
college swimming," she said. "I
wanted to keep swimming faster.
I don't regret the decision to go
to college at all. I like it a lot."
The Sullivan Award winner will
be announced Mar. 12 at a ban
quet in Indianapolis. Evans will
compete for the Cardinal in the
NCAA Championships begining
Mar. 15 in Austin, Texas.
