# Final damage report, quake repair plans due in February
## 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Final plans and cost estimates for
repairing University buildings damaged
in the Oct. 17 earthquake will not be
available until mid-February, when the
Board of Trustees will face several op
tions in deciding how to proceed with the
repairs.
Assoc. Provost John Hughes said yes
terday that those repair options include:
• Repairing and strengthening build
ings to life-safety standards, which would
put them in approximately the same state
they were in before the quake;
• Upgrading buildings to current Uni
form Building Code, which would make

similar damage during a future quake
"much less likely," according to Hughes;
or
• Making additional "program im
provements," such as remodeling for
more efficient use of space.
Preliminary estimates place the cost
of the life-safety standard repairs at $130
million. A plan limiting the potential dis
ruption of programs after another quake
would cost about $235 million, which
includes the cost of reconstructing Old
Chemistry and the east and south wings
of Encina Hall, which were closed before
the earthquake because they were
deemed seismically unsafe.
"We're working hard to get better cost
estimates," Hughes said.

Much of the University's decision-making will be
based on a $100,000 study being conducted by a
structural engineering firm.

Additional costs would be incurred for
program improvements, but Hughes
projected that those would be determined
on an individual basis while the other
improvements would be recommended as
package deals.
For example, climate controls could be
added to the Stanford Museum, which
has had difficulty attracting top traveling
exhibits because it does not have them.

Hughes estimated that repairs and im
provements will take between two and
three years once projects are approved.
In addition to many studies already
conducted, much of the University's
decision-making will be based on a
$100,000 study being conducted by a
structural engineering firm and directed
by Fouad Bendimerad, Facilities Project
Management's lone seismic engineer.

Bendimerad has provided the technical
expertise for the University's Earthquake
Risk Management Program since 1986.
The 180-building analysis will examine
the damage caused by the earthquake
and the capacity of buildings to withstand
a future temblor. "If the building receives
a D, it is essentially on probation,"
Hughes said, explaining that those build
ings would receive higher priority in
repair plans.
Funding options for the repairs are
still in the works, though Hughes said
$41 million in facilities reserves and other
reserves can be reallocated in the next
five years. That shift would leave less
