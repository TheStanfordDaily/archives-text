# 4,000-year-old onGoing tradition is a new obsession at Stanford

Is that Othello?
Are those mints or giant M&M's?
These are the questions Go participants
are often asked by passers-by in the Tres
idder dining room, where the Stanford Go
Club meets every Tuesday night at 8:30.
Most people don't realize that Go, a game
not widely known, has been played for more
than 4,000 years. Go is the oldest game
in the world and was first invented by the
Chinese.
The game is played on a 19-by-19 inch
board with white and black stones that
look like enlarged M&M's. Each player in
turn strategically places a stone on a dif
ferent square in an attempt to surround
an opponent's stone. The winner is the one
who captures the most stones in the time
allotted, which could be as short as an hour
or as long as a month.
As American champion Paul Hu tells his

Stanford pupils, Go is easy to learn but
difficult to master.
After all these years, the ancient Eastern
board game is finally gaining popularity in
the West, so it is a fairly fresh phenomenon
at Stanford.
But the Chinese and Japanese have
played the game for centuries, and it's
serious business to them.
From the beginning, China had the best
Go players in the world — until the Jap
anese caught on, that is. Japan was on top
for a time, but in the past five years China
has regained the number-one spot. Korea
and Taiwan, among others, have also be
come exceptionally successful Go fanatics.
It should therefore come as no surprise
that the U.S. national champion did not
grow up watching American Sesame Street
or eating peanut butter and jelly sand
wiches.

Regardless of GPA, all students had to wait in the same long lines in Dinkelspiel Auditorium to find out their
fall quarter grades.
Thirty-five-year-old Paul Hu
(known as Hu Shih in China) was
born in and learned the game in
Taiwan. He now teaches Go to
members of the Stanford Go Club
in lessons at the Palo Alto Com
munity Center twice a week,
bringing in about $3,000 a month
in the process. He currently has
about 20 students.
Hu moved to America from Tai
wan two years ago, following his
family which had settled in Los
Angeles 13 years ago.
He managed to teach himself
the nuances of the game and work
his way up to being a world class
Go player — as well as one of the
top four players in all of Taiwan.
"This is incredibly rare," said
Go Club member and Stanford
graduate Troy Anderson. A
former defensive tackle for the
Cardinal, Anderson started play
ing Go less than a year ago and
is now under Hu's instruction.
"Usually it takes years of learn
ing and practice under care and

Anderson said.
"It's hard for us Westerners,"
explained Reed Augustin, a
former student of Hu's and a
member of the club."I wasn't
introduced to the game until I
was 20, and that's 15 years too
late. Japanese professionals al
ready know how to play Go when
they're five."

This wasn't the case for Paul
Hu and is what makes his success
so brilliant. Hu first learned about
Go at age 12 by reading the local
Japanese newspaper. He read all
about his idol Rin Kaiho, the
champion Go player of the time.
Hu bought a game and taught

himself how to play.
Soon Hu was hooked. "I went
to a club in Taipei to watch" the
world's best players in action.
By the time he was 22, Hu be
came the youngest Go profes
sional in Taiwan. Most of the pros
were in their late 20s and early
30s. He proved his dedication by
playing about four times a week
for three to four hours a sitting.
But more than dedication goes
into the making of a Go champion.
"Before it was done by the el
derly in their leisure time," Hu
explained. "Now it's not leisure.
It's work. To be great at the game,
to reach a point that is higher
than the pros, one must read,
read, read."
Hu, a resident of San Mateo,
studies two hours a night. His
materials are sent from Japan,
China and a library in San Fran
cisco.
