Is that Othello?
Are those mints or giant M&M's?
These are the questions Go participants
are often asked by passers-by in the Tres
idder dining room, where the Stanford Go
Club meets every Tuesday night at 8:30.
Most people don't realize that Go, a game
not widely known, has been played for more
than 4,000 years. Go is the oldest game
in the world and was first invented by the
Chinese.
The game is played on a 19-by-19 inch
board with white and black stones that
look like enlarged M&M's. Each player in
turn strategically places a stone on a dif
ferent square in an attempt to surround
an opponent's stone. The winner is the one
who captures the most stones in the time
allotted, which could be as short as an hour
or as long as a month.
As American champion Paul Hu tells his

Stanford pupils, Go is easy to learn but
difficult to master.
After all these years, the ancient Eastern
board game is finally gaining popularity in
the West, so it is a fairly fresh phenomenon
at Stanford.
But the Chinese and Japanese have
played the game for centuries, and it's
serious business to them.
From the beginning, China had the best
Go players in the world — until the Jap
anese caught on, that is. Japan was on top
for a time, but in the past five years China
has regained the number-one spot. Korea
and Taiwan, among others, have also be
come exceptionally successful Go fanatics.
It should therefore come as no surprise
that the U.S. national champion did not
grow up watching American Sesame Street
or eating peanut butter and jelly sand
wiches.
