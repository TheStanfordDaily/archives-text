# Repair deadline lifted

A looming state deadline for
upgrading unreinforced masonry
buildings will no longer be a thorn
in the side of the University's
earthquake repair planners.
An exception to a new county
ordinance, approved Dec. 12 by
the Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors, grants Stanford one
more year to develop a plan for
bracing its 49 unreinforced
masonry buildings for future
earthquakes.
The 1986 state law, known as
58547, required each county to
identify unreinforced masonry
buildings by Jan. 1, 1990, and
formulate a plan to improve the
resistance of those buildings to
earthquake damage. The model
ordinance provided by the state
also included a four-year deadline

for making those upgrades.
The ordinance exception "al
lows Stanford a little more than
four years because of the amount
of damage," Assoc. Provost John
Hughes said.
He noted, however, that Stan
ford has not been complacent
about bracing those buildings.
"We would like to get things done
much sooner (because of chances
for other earthquakes) than we
would have otherwise," he said.
Several buildings have under
gone seismic reinforcement proj
ects in recent years, including
Roble Hall.
Stanford's number of unrein
forced masonry buildings is un
usually large because of the
unique architectural design. Only
15 other buildings with unrein
forced masonry construction were
noted by county officials.
