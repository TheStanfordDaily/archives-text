Time changes need changes
An advertisement in yesterday's Daily con
taining winter quarter time schedule
changes had two incorrect entries, which
have been corrected in the version appearing
today.
There is no room change for Political Sci
ence 1. It will meet in 160-161J, as listed
in the Time Schedule.
Anthropology 119/219 will meet in Roble
Mod 103 Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10
a.m. to noon. It is being offered for 5 units.
Profs wife found dead
Helen Mayhew, 69, wife of Education
Emeritus Prof. Lewis Mayhew, was found
dead in her campus home Saturday. Her
death was an apparent suicide, Stanford
News Service reported.
A spokesperson for the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office said Mrs. Mayhew left a
suicide note. The Mayhews had been married
for a year and a half.
She was born in Tientsin, China and was
a graduate of UC-Berkeley. She was
employed for 25 years with Ampex Corp.
on the Peninsula and is survived by two
sons and five grandchildren.
Fire destroys RF bedroom
A Dec. 24 fire in the resident fellow apart
ment in the Ujamaa wing of Lagunita Court
destroyed one bedroom and its contents and
caused extensive smoke damage.
The apartment is the residence of Rachel
Bagby, associate director of the Martin Lu
ther King, Jr. Papers Project, and her hus
band, Martin Davidson.

University fire marshal Ray Gamma said
the fire started when a candle burning in
the bedroom fell onto the floor and ignited
some papers. Bagby, who was home at the
time, was alerted by a smoke detector and
left the apartment.
Donations to help offset the damage are
being accepted by the Dean of Student Af
fairs Office.
These ones you can't forge
Many Stanford students were surprised
when they returned to campus and found
the familiar "Registration Materials
Enclosed" envelope in their mailboxes —
the second in a month.
The Registrar's Office has reissued stu
dent ID cards, this time with the red Stan
ford seal on it. The change was made after
a student and his roommate demonstrated
how easy it was to forge the cards using
software on the Apple Macintosh, said Asst.
Registrar Joy Parker.
Parker added that the ID cards issued in
the first week of December have been in
validated by the new IDs.
Green Library will not be issuing books
to anyone without the new ID, and portal
monitors will honor the old ID for access
into the building only for the next two weeks.
Parker said that a universal ID card is
on its way and should be ready by fall 1991.
These cards would serve both to get into
University libraries and to get meals
through University Food Service.
