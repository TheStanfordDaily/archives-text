# Columbia launch a success

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
â€” Shuttle Columbia opened a new
decade of space travel yesterday
with a letter-perfect launch and
the start of a search-and-rescue
mission for a scientific satellite
drifting back to Earth.
After three weeks of delays, the
shuttle lifted off precisely on time
just after dawn at 7:35 a.m. and
began chasing the satellite, which
was 1,500 miles ahead of the
shuttle.
"I don't think I've ever seen a
cleaner countdown and launch,"
said Richard Truly, administrator
of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration. "What a
marvelous way to start the
19905."
The flight begins a decade in
which shuttles will transport
astronauts and materials to build
America's space station. The sta
tion is an essential step for a
return to the moon and expedi
tions to Mars envisioned by Pres
ident Bush.
Columbia's mission is scheduled
to last 10 days, the second-longest

since shuttles began flying in
1981. The ship is being modified
gradually for 16-day journeys and
the extended mission is to be a
test toward that objective.
The 200-mile-high pursuit is to
end Friday morning when com
mander Dan Brandenstein and his
crew of four catch up with the
bus-size satellite called the Long
Duration Exposure Facility. It will
take 14 course corrections to get
them there.
The first of those, in midafter
noon, edged Columbia closer to
the invisible path traveled by the
satellite.
It was, said Mission Control's
Brian Welch, "like changing lanes
on the freeway"
The crew, meanwhile, ran the
shuttle's remote crane through its
paces and found it in good shape,
beamed some spectacular televi
sion pictures to the ground and
activated two of eight experiments
on their to-do list. There were a
few small problems but none
caused Mission Control any head
aches.

"Columbia is a very clean ma
chine," Welch said.
Atmospheric drag has been pull
ing LDEF to Earth about half a
mile a day, a rate that is increas
ing.
In a slightly lower orbit, Co
lumbia was circling the globe a
little faster, gradually narrowing
the distance with Brandenstein
and pilot Jim Wetherbee at the
controls.
"Dan is one of the finest stick
handlers we've seen, and Jim is
not far behind," said flight direc
tor A 1 Pennington in Houston.
If all goes as planned, mission
specialist Bonnie Dunbar will
snare the satellite with the
shuttle's robot crane on Friday
and lift it into the cargo bay for
the trip home.
There is other work, too, for
the five astronauts. Today they
will release a 17,000-pound com
munications satellite to complete
a set of four leased to the Navy
by their owner, Hughes Commu
nications.
