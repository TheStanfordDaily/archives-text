Comecon reforms
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Czechoslovakia, Hun
gary and Poland said yesterday that the Soviet
Union must pay for 40 years of economic stagna
tion caused by their membership in Comecon.
The three tentatively united in a front that
could become Eastern Europe's economic power
house.
The 45th session of the Council for Mutual
Economic Assistance also heard at its opening
session yesterday a Soviet proposal that the group
start trading on a hard currency basis next year
at world market prices.
But Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland called
for even more radical reforms to revive the lum
bering trading bloc, which has been viewed by
some of its members as obsolete because of the
reforms that have swept Eastern Europe since
last year.
