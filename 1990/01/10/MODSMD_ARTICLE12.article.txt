SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov. George
Deukmejian proposed yesterday that
earthquake insurance should be manda
tory for all "at risk" homes and busi
nesses in California.
In his eighth and final "State-of-the-
State" address to a statewide television
audience and a joint session of the Cal
ifornia Legislature, the Republican gover
nor also proposed giving local schools cash
incentives to convert to year-round class
room schedules, and he said he would
support a constitutional amendment to
lower the required voter approval on local
school bonds from two-thirds to 60 per
cent.
"It is simply inexcusable and wasteful

to allow school facilities to sit idle and
unused for up to three months per year,"
Deukmejian said of his proposal to en
courage more local districts to convert
to year-round class schedules.
Previewing the 1,'200-page-plus budget
message which he will submit to the
Legislature on Wednesday, Deukmejian
said his spending proposal for the 1990-91
fiscal year would be $3.4 billion more
than the $49.13 billion annual budget he
signed last June for the current fiscal
year.
But, Deukmejian warned, without
citing specific budget items, despite that
increase in tax revenues, the new budget
won't include enough money to meet all

of the expected caseload increases and
automatic cost-of-living adjustments in
current state programs required by exist
ing state laws.
He said there will be a gap between
revenues and those spending mandates
and expected revenues of 2.6 percent.
That would amount to about 1.3 billion,
but Deukmejian didn't cite any specific
figures, or say what programs he planned
to either cut or cap at increases that are
less than current statutory requirements.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must face
reality," Deukmejian told the joint session
of the state Senate and Assembly. "When
you have laws requiring spending in
creases of 11 percent and additional in

come of 8.4 percent, it is evident that
adjustments in some programs will be
needed to bring the projected rise in
spending in line with the projected rise
in income.
"And so, I will propose a number of
reasonable and necessary legislative
changes in some programs," he said. He
didn't list specific cuts, and went out of
his way to stress that he was willing to
negotiate the final list of cuts with the
Democratic leadership of the Legislature.
Both the tone and specifics of Deuk
mejian's address won praise from leaders
of both parties in the Assembly, while
Senate leaders from both sides of the
aisle were more guarded.

Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, the
Democratic leader of the lower house,
said Deukmejian deserved an A grade for
both the content of his address and for
his conciliatory tone.
"It was a fine, forward-looking address.
It was in the spirit of cooperation," said
Assembly Republican leader Ross
Johnson of Fullerton, who had special
praise for aid to first-time home buyers.
"It was more of a status-quo, whats
going-to-happen-in-the-immediate-future
kind of speech, not a kind that commands
Californians to do great things," said Sen
ate Democratic leader David Roberti of
Los Angeles.
