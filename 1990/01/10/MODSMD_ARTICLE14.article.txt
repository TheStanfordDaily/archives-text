Quake modulars are
an ugly and hopefully
temporary necessity

WHEN MANY of us were in
baby-strollers back in
1969, the University put
up the Manzanita trailers as "tem
porary emergency" housing, to be
removed in "three to five years,"
according to a Board of Trustees
resolution.
Over 20 years later, the "tem
porary" Manzanita trailers still
stand as housing for 352 students.
Recently the University built an
other "temporary" complex — the
quake modulars which were
needed to replace the 14,000
square feet of classroom space
damaged in the Oct. 17 earth
quake.
The quake modulars, located at
Roble Field, Galvez Mall and
Wibur Hall, are supposed to house
the 35 to 40 classes displaced by
the earthquake.
Hopefully the University is not
defining "temporary" as 20 years,
as it did in the case of the Man
zanita trailers.
Besides the same "temporary"
designation originally given the
Manzanita trailers, the modulars
are just as ugly. The buildings look

more like convenience stores than
proper university classrooms.
The University should dispel
fears that these buildings will be
around forever by making concrete
plans for replacement — so we
don't end up with another case
like the eternal trailers.
Once students return to classes
in permanent structures, the temp
tation to house student groups
wanting office space may be too
great for the University to resist.
Of course, the University did a
quick job of replacing the damaged
buildings and should be com
mended for working well under dis
asterous circumstances.
Classes can be held in the
modulars, and they serve that pur
pose fine for the time being. It is
understandable given the time
crunch that aesthetics was proba
bly not the University's primary
concern.
In fact, the higher-quality
modulars at Wilbur Hall would not
exist had it not been for the
generosity of IBM, which gra
ciously donated the buildings when
they were no longer needed.
So although the modulars are
very much needed by this quake
ravaged campus and were provided
in a timely fashion, they should
indeed be gone from Stanford's
sight in a time period that makes
them what they are — temporary
classroom space.
