## Legalizing drugs would be a detriment to society 
### 
IT HAS BECOME fashionable to
argue for the legalization of addict
ing drugs. Legalization, so the
argument goes, would take the crime
out of the drug business.
The proponents — politicians, politi
cal scientists, economists, judges —
have one remarkable thing in common:
their lack of expertise concerning the
drugs themselves. How can there be
rational debate on drug policy without
reference to the pharmacologic and
toxicologic effects of the drugs?
If drugs were innocuous, we might
argue that any kind of prohibition
brings more harm than good to society.
But they are not innocuous. Each
drug has its own pattern of toxicity, its
own addictive potential.
Some cause behavioral effects that
are dangerous to society, such as ag
gressiveness and lack of judgment due
to alcohol, or paranoid violence due to
cocaine.
Some cause physical harm to the
user, such as heart disease, emphysema
and cancer from tobacco, unpredictable
heart stoppage from cocaine, and brain
damage to the unborn child from
alcohol, heroin and cocaine.
The number of addicts would cer
tainly increase if cocaine or heroin, for
example, were legalized. Such drugs
control behavior so powerfully that
even now people pay exorbitant prices
and risk arrest in order to sustain
their habits.
Is it not self-evident that many more
would use these drugs if they were
cheap, available and sanctioned by the
government?
But on this point we don't have to
speculate, we can draw on facts. Alco
hol and cigarettes, although under
some degree of regulation, are widely
available, and as a result we have
more than 10 million alcohol addicts
and over 17 million nicotine addicts.
Yet alcohol and nicotine are certainly

Most people, after all, tend to respect and
observe (or nearly observe) the law. One could
say that the speed limit of 55 miles per hour
'doesn't work,' but the truth is that more people
drive near 55 now than when the limit was 65,
and the highway accident and death rates are
demonstrably lower.

not more addictive than heroin or
cocaine. Indeed, in animal experiments,
cocaine is so addicting that a monkey,
allowed to self-inject it freely, prefers
cocaine to food, water and sex and
actually kills itself with it.
One can predict with some confi
dence, therefore, that legalizaion of
heroin and cocaine would result in a
vast expansion of the present pool of
one-half million heroin addicts and
(perhaps) a few million cocaine addicts.
That is exactly what did happen with
cocaine, which was prohibitively expen
sive a decade ago, a rare "treat" for
the rich; when its price dropped, the
number of users at all income levels
escalated sharply.
If we relaxed the prohibitions on
such drugs, and allowed the expansion
of the user pool, we would then face
the same demand-reduction problem as
now, but on a much larger scale.
So whatever we would do then to
reduce demand — investing more in
education, prevention and treatment —
why not do it now, and thus reduce
drug-related crimes without changing
the legal status of the drugs?
It is often said that "we tried
Prohibition and it didn't work." What
is meant by "didn't work" is that there

were violations of the law (e.g.,
speakeasies) and that criminality was
fostered (rum-runners, gang wars).
But here again the effect on users is
ignored. During national Prohibition
and the preceding period of widespread
regional restrictions, far less alcohol
was consumed, and objective measures
of excessive use, such as alcoholic liver
disease, fell sharply, only to rise again
after repeal.
I do not argue that we should return
to Prohibition (although some degree
of stricter regulation of alcohol and
tobacco would, indeed, be beneficial); I
only assert that legal status does
indeed influence drug use.
Most people, after all, tend to respect

but the trutn is that more people drive
near 55 now than when the limit was
65, and the highway accident and
death rates are demonstrably lower.
No laws have ever completely elimi
nated undesirable social behaviors.
Nevertheless, the growing number of
murders, rapes, robberies, burglaries,
frauds, briberies and a variety of
white-collar crimes does not provoke

suggestions that these anti-social be
haviors should be legalized.
Perhaps the difference lies in the
fiction that drug abuse harms only the
user and not others, that it is "victim
less crime." Not so. Addicts not only
risk their own health, they ultimately
burden a compassionate society with
their medical care and with support of
their bereaved families.
Among the innocent victims are the
babies born with brain damage to
addict mothers and the battered
children of addict parents. Moreover,
any of us could be killed or maimed as
a result of the dangerous behaviors
induced by some of the drugs.
Finally, the whole of society pays for
the loss of productivity due to drugs.
Simplistic proposals for sweeping
legalization should be rejected. How
ever, we should consider how to make
the degree of prohibition or regulation
more responsive to the actual danger
posed by each drug.
Laws that are consistent and logical,
that treat all drugs in an even-handed
way according to their real potential
for harm, will command greater re
spect.
Our guiding policy should be demand
reduction coupled with more stringent
law enforcement. This seems, on the
whole, to be the Bush administration's
position, and I support it.
Two urgent specific needs are to
ensure that treatment is available to all
who desire it, and to invest in research
on developing better methods of treat
ing cocaine addiction.

vast expansion of the present pool of
one-half million heroin addicts and
(perhaps) a few million cocaine addicts.
That is exactly what did happen with
cocaine, which was prohibitively expen
sive a decade ago, a rare "treat" for
the rich; when its price dropped, the
number of users at all income levels
escalated sharply.
If we relaxed the prohibitions on
such drugs, and allowed the expansion
of the user pool, we would then face
the same demand-reduction problem as
now, but on a much larger scale.
So whatever we would do then to
reduce demand — investing more in
education, prevention and treatment —
why not do it now, and thus reduce
drug-related crimes without changing
the legal status of the drugs?
It is often said that "we tried
Prohibition and it didn't work." What
is meant by "didn't work" is that there

were violations of the law (e.g.,
speakeasies) and that criminality was
fostered (rum-runners, gang wars).
But here again the effect on users is
ignored. During national Prohibition
and the preceding period of widespread
regional restrictions, far less alcohol
was consumed, and objective measures
of excessive use, such as alcoholic liver
disease, fell sharply, only to rise again
after repeal.
I do not argue that we should return
to Prohibition (although some degree
of stricter regulation of alcohol and
tobacco would, indeed, be beneficial); I
only assert that legal status does
indeed influence drug use.
Most people, after all, tend to respect
and observe (or nearly observe) the
law. One could say that the speed limit
of 55 miles per hour "doesn't work",
but the trutn is that more people drive
near 55 now than when the limit was
65, and the highway accident and
death rates are demonstrably lower.
No laws have ever completely elimi
nated undesirable social behaviors.
Nevertheless, the growing number of
murders, rapes, robberies, burglaries,
frauds, briberies and a variety of
white-collar crimes does not provoke

suggestions that these anti-social be
haviors should be legalized.
Perhaps the difference lies in the
fiction that drug abuse harms only the
user and not others, that it is "victim
less crime." Not so. Addicts not only
risk their own health, they ultimately
burden a compassionate society with
their medical care and with support of
their bereaved families.
Among the innocent victims are the
babies born with brain damage to
addict mothers and the battered
children of addict parents. Moreover,
any of us could be killed or maimed as
a result of the dangerous behaviors
induced by some of the drugs.
Finally, the whole of society pays for
the loss of productivity due to drugs.
Simplistic proposals for sweeping
legalization should be rejected. How
ever, we should consider how to make
the degree of prohibition or regulation
more responsive to the actual danger
posed by each drug.
Laws that are consistent and logical,
that treat all drugs in an even-handed
way according to their real potential
for harm, will command greater re
spect.
Our guiding policy should be demand
reduction coupled with more stringent
law enforcement. This seems, on the
whole, to be the Bush administration's
position, and I support it.
Two urgent specific needs are to
ensure that treatment is available to all
who desire it, and to invest in research
on developing better methods of treat
ing cocaine addiction.

IT HAS BECOME fashionable to
argue for the legalization of addict
ing drugs. Legalization, so the
argument goes, would take the crime
out of the drug business.
The proponents — politicians, politi
cal scientists, economists, judges —
have one remarkable thing in common:
their lack of expertise concerning the
drugs themselves. How can there be
rational debate on drug policy without
reference to the pharmacologic and
toxicologic effects of the drugs?
If drugs were innocuous, we might
argue that any kind of prohibition
brings more harm than good to society.
But they are not innocuous. Each
drug has its own pattern of toxicity, its
own addictive potential.
Some cause behavioral effects that
are dangerous to society, such as ag
gressiveness and lack of judgment due
to alcohol, or paranoid violence due to
cocaine.
Some cause physical harm to the
user, such as heart disease, emphysema
and cancer from tobacco, unpredictable
heart stoppage from cocaine, and brain
damage to the unborn child from
alcohol, heroin and cocaine.
The number of addicts would cer
tainly increase if cocaine or heroin, for
example, were legalized. Such drugs
control behavior so powerfully that
even now people pay exorbitant prices
and risk arrest in order to sustain
their habits.
Is it not self-evident that many more
would use these drugs if they were
cheap, available and sanctioned by the
government?
But on this point we don't have to
speculate, we can draw on facts. Alco
hol and cigarettes, although under
some degree of regulation, are widely
available, and as a result we have
more than 10 million alcohol addicts
and over 17 million nicotine addicts.
Yet alcohol and nicotine are certainly

not more addictive than heroin or
cocaine. Indeed, in animal experiments,
cocaine is so addicting that a monkey,
allowed to self-inject it freely, prefers
cocaine to food, water and sex and
actually kills itself with it.
