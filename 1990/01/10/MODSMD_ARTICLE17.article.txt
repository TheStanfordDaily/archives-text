## No wimps or grown-ups

I WATCHED a lot of television over
the break.
When the thermometer hit 20
degrees below zero in lowa, wiling away
the hours wrapped up in a blanket in
front of the television became the perfect
way for me to spend my vacation.
I watched so much television that as
news of the United States' invasion of
Panama began to dominate the airwaves,
I thought I was watching the debut of a
whole new program.
Sort of a Saturday morning ac
tion/adventure type about these govern
ment and military officials who had been
exposed to some kind of powerful radio
active time warp device which caused
them to regress to the aggressive,
horomone-crazed state of many adoles
cent males.
It was "Invasion of the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Politicians and Military Person
nel." Government and military leaders
abandoned the caution and restraint that
adulthood sometimes imposes and instead
acted like wild, insecure teenagers in jus
tifying and carrying out the invasion of
Panama.
My extensive knowledge of pop psy
chology tells me that as many males reach
adolescence, they often begin to feel a
little anxious about their manhood. They
worry that their peers may think they
are weak or call them sissies. To coun
teract this fear, teenage boys sometimes
overcompensate and try to act tough and
aggressive to prove they are not wimps.
Sound familiar? President Bush him
self is no stranger to the wimp label.
His soft image dogged him throughout

his 1988 campaign. When the problem
arose then, he attacked Dan Rather in
hopes of boosting his macho quotient.
When the public perception of him as
indecisive and cautious persisted after
the election, he decided to go after Gen.
Manuel Noriega in Panama.
First a network news anchor, then the
leader of a small country. A logical pro
gression for George "Macho Man" Bush.
Apparently this insecurity about mas
culinity is not limited to the chief exec
utive. During television coverage the day
after the invasion, several government
and military officials explained the inci
dent as necessary to prevent the United
States from being seen as "wimpish" or
"Lilliputian."
One official declared that the invasion
showed that "America will not stand im
potently by." Instead, the United States
thrust its military might deep into Latin
America and showed tne world how truly
buff it is.
The government and military's trip
down Adolescent Avenue didn't end im
mediately after the original invasion,
however. When the military learned,
through what it likes to call "intelligence"
(and sometimes it even calls it that with
a straight face), that Noriega hated rock
music, huge speakers were set up outside
the Vatican Embassy.
Clever selections like "I Fought the
Law (and the Law Won)" and "We're Not
Gonna to Take It" were cranked up out
side of Noriega's hideaway.
Yes, the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Mili
tary Personnel" were at their finest,
blasting their tunes away like teenage

boys turning up their stereos to irritate
Mom and Dad.
Their return to adolescence had appar
ently convinced them that listening to
Twisted Sister at a high enough volume
would drive Noriega to surrender. Well,
maybe teenage males aren't completely
irrational.
In perhaps the perfect ending to this
tale of transported teenagers trashing the
Panamanian political and economic sys
tem, the most famous adolescent of all
will be sent to that country to put a lid
on the whole affair.
Vice President Dan Quayle has been
selected to lead a "fence-mending" mis
sion to Panama, a move so bizarre that
it has convinced me that the events I've
witnessed in the past three weeks really
are only a television pilot gone hopelessly
awry.
