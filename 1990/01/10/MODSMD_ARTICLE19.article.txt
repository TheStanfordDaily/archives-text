## When and where to run stories are tough questions 
### 
WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE hit
the Bay Area last October, the
role of The Daily and other
Bay Area media was very clear.
More than ever, Stanford community
members relied on The Daily to let
them know whether classes would be
held, what buildings were open, what
activities were canceled — and for
some, where they would be living in
the next few months.
The Daily became the most compre
hensive forum for spreading earth
quake news to the entire campus, a
function that we took to heart and did
our best to perform.
While major disasters clarify to
readers the usefulness and purpose of
the news media, confusion over that
role seems to be the order of the day
when it comes to more personal issues
that deal with problems or disasters
that face individuals, rather than an
entire community.
That distinction was evident in some
responses we received to two other
stories that did not have as universal
an impact as the events of Oct. 17: the
paralyzing injury sustained by junior
Greg Smith during an intramural
football game Nov. 12, and the alleged
sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl
initially reported by a Monterey Penin
sula woman who had attended an Oct.

6 Delta Kappa Epsilon party.
Our reasons for covering the inci
dents are consistent with our reasons
for covering the aftermath of the
quake; as our articles of incorporation
state, we have a responsibility as the
campus newspaper to "act as a
source of news relating to or otherwise
of interest to the Stanford University
community."
In simpler terms, we have a duty to
keep our readers up to date on every
thing of significance that happens on
campus.
One letter said our coverage of the
IM accident showed "journalistic ir
responsibility and gross insensitivity."
The writer, along with some people we
interviewed at the time, said that we
should have delayed printing the story
"until friends and housemates could be
notified in a way more appropriate
than a Daily headline. . . . Even such a
standard journalistic procedure as
reporting the accident but withholding
the names involved pending notifica
tion of those close to the victim was
not followed."
The concern is warranted, and it is
the reason more sensitivity is needed
when it comes to personal issues. We
try to hold to that standard.
Because it was a serious accident, we
did make sure Smith's family had been

notified before deciding to use his
name, but it is not standard journalis
tic procedure to wait until all persons
who know an accident victim are
notified.
Also, news of such a serious accident
spreads very quickly by word of
mouth, making it important to report
the facts expediently. Without a story
in that Monday's paper, many people
still would have heard about what
happened, but accuracy would be ques
tionable as word spread farther from
the closest source.
The letter further criticizes the
questions asked by reporters — "to dig
for facts, some of them relevant, others
clearly not." Especially under fire were
attempts to find out the name of the
person Smith collided with during the
game.
Again, questions are not asked to
upset interviewees or find out needless
information. Our aim is to ascertain all
the facts from several people, so false
rumors or inaccurate accounts do not
nullify an otherwise well-reported
story.
Determining all the pertinent infor
mation requires asking a breadth of
questions, some of which will seem
irrelevant to those who know all the
facts but must be asked by the
reporter who was not at the scene.

For a reporter to develop a clear
sense of events when he or she did not
witness the incident, cooperation of
sources or witnesses goes a long way
to making a reporter's account more
accurate.
The story that faced the most
criticism for being published was the
reported sexual assault of a 13-year-old
at the fraternity party.
Interfraternity Council members
tried to convince editors that there was
not enough information to run a story
about the investigation, a Stanford
Review columnist slammed the ongoing
coverage and a class debate even oc
curred between a Daily staffer and a
fraternity member about the original
story.
Despite the lack of information
known at the time by Stanford Police
and Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes, we believed it was important
that the Stanford community be aware
that an assault had been reported.
The infrequent reporting of sexual
assaults made the case important
enough for police and Hughes to inves
tigate, even though no victim had come
forward.
More importantly, other people on
campus may have had useful informa
tion to bring forward that would have
been lost if an investigation was not

public knowledge.
The lack of confirmed facts about
the case led to a placement of the
story on Page 2, so people would know
about the investigation, but the probe
would not be blown out of proportion.
Continued efforts by police and The
Daily's reporter led to an eventual
confirmation of the source's story with
other people, as well as identification
and location of the alleged victim by
police. Partially because of our efforts,
the girl can undergo counseling and
other measures to help her overcome
any emotional problems she has be
cause of the incident.
By no means are editorial decisions
clear cut; they are often difficult, and
sensitive issues must be handled very
delicately. In the two most prominent
cases fall quarter, we have no regrets
about running the stories when and
where we did.
