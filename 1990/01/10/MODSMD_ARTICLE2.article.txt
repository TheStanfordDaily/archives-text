# Rape victims given options
## Task force report outlines possible aid for assaulted 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
The University's Task Force on
Sexual Assault, attempting to
raise awareness of a campus prob
lem, will release next week a draft
report detailing options for vic
tims of date rape and other forms
of sexual coercion.
The draft will put forth proce
dures victims can follow in the
event of a sexual attack and will
provide guidance for resident as
sistants, resident fellows and
others who want to help assault
victims.
"Stanford cares about victims
of sexual assault and wants to put
that caring into an understanda
ble, helpful set of procedures that
will assist the victim," said
Patricia Fabiano, who co-chairs
the task force and is Cowell Stu
dent Health Center director of
health promotion.
Resident assistants and resident
fellows will meet next Thursday
night to receive copies of the "In
terim Response Protocol" and to
undergo training to help counsel
victims of sexual assault.
The protocol marks the first at
tempt by the University to create
a standardized procedure for as
sault victims to follow. "All this
adds up to the statement that this

is an important issue on campus,"
Fabiano said.
The one-page draft will be pub
lished in Campus Report and will
be widely distributed around
campus for student comment. The
protocol is a temporary rendition
of an official, more specific ver
sion that will be ready in Novem
ber.
Because the protocol encour
ages victims to report sexual as
saults, Fabiano said she expects
an increase in the number of re
ported rapes once the report is
published.
"We're providing a climate that
will be supportive to reporting,"
she said.
However, Fabiano added that
reporting an assault entails "more
than just calling the police."
"Reporting is the beginning of
a healing process from sexual as
sault. It's coming out of secrecy
and isolation. ... It enhances the
opportunity for recovery and
helps the victim accept the reality
of what'B happened and assert the
reality that it shouldn't have hap
pened," she said.
The protocol will outline "three
major gateways into services that
will aid victims of sexual assault,"
Fabiano said, summarizing the
protocol's contents.
One gateway is the Stanford

Police Department, which,
Fabiano emphasized, will not re
quire the filing of a report, but
will place the victim in contact
with a sensitive, trained officer
who will provide medical, legal
and counseling services.
Another gateway is the Stan
ford Rape Response Group, a
group of trained couselors who
will provide guidance and support.
The third gateway, the YMCA
Rape Crisis Center, will also advise
victims of their medical, legal and
counseling options.
"All of the gateways will be
equally helpful," Fabiano said.
"All three gateways are there
to tell survivors that you don't
have to go through this alone.
You have choices; we're here to
let you know your options and to
be with you for whatever you need
to help in your healing," she said.
Fabiano and junior Suzanne
O'Brien chair the task force,
which is made up of various stu
dents and representatives from
the Public Safety Department,
residence deans, Residential Edu
cation, Fraternal Affairs, Cowell
Student Health Center, Counsel
ing and Psychological Services,
Health Promotion, Rape Educa
