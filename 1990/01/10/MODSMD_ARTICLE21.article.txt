# Quirk quake find
## Signal may have warned of temblor 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
In what may have been a
warning of the earthquake,
Stanford research equipment in
Santa Cruz detected unusually
high levels of radio waves hours
before the massive Oct. 17
temblor.
The atmospheric and space
researchers were performing
unrelated defense research
when their sensors detected
electromagnetic signals that re
searchers are unable to explain.
The waves are a complete mys
tery, said Antony Fraser-
Smith, a senior research
associate in electrical engineer
ing, when he unveiled the data
at a December meeting of the
Geophysical Union.
The ability to predict earth
quakes has long been sought
by seismologists, and research
ers have had only sporadic luck
detecting any precursor sig
nals. The prediction of earth
quakes, even with just hours
notice, has the potential for
saving millions of dollars and
many lives in earthquake
prone areas of the world.
Sensors scattered through
out the region operated by the
U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park detected nothing
that could be easily identified
as a precursor. Only the Stan
ford equipment, which was
searching for ultralow
frequency electromagnetic
waves.
The sensors had been moved
to Corralitos, only seven miles
from the epicenter of the Loma
Prieta earthquake, completely
by chance.
The Bay Area, which would
have been a more convenient
locale for the research, is filled
with electromagnetic "smog"
from the BART trains, as
Fraser-Smith discovered in
1980. To avoid the electromag
netic noise, the researchers

moved the equipment to the
house of a sister of one of the
graduate students working on
the project.
Three hours before the
earthquake that devastated
much of the Bay Area, the sig
nals, which had been building
slowly for weeks, suddenly shot
upward off the charts. The
crazy readings stopped sud
denly when the power was dis
connected.
Although the researchers are
hopeful that seismologists
might use similar sensors to
detect future earthquakes, they
were quick to caution that, be
cause this was an accidental
find, there were no controls in
their experiment.
Other Californian research
ers have expressed both op
timism and caution about the
findings. On the one hand, the
discovery may yield promise as
an earthquake predictor, or at
least might spur research in a
field many scientists say is un
derfunded. On the other, the
findings might have an expla
nation that is not related to
the earthquake that ravaged
northern California.
The Stanford findings were
not the first indication that
earthquakes might cause un
usual radio waves. Researchers
from Japan and the Soviet Un
ion have previously seen unus
ual behavior in higher
frequency radio waves. Unlike
the Japanese and Soviet
results, however, the Stanford
group has data gathered in
Corralitos over a period of two
years prior to the October
earthquake that shows no un
usual signals.
At the time of the finding,
Fraser-Smith was studying
very low frequency radio waves
in the earth and its atmosphere
because they can travel far
through the earth and water.
