## Student engineers build for homeless 
### Dan Cory Staff writer 
Imagine you were kicked out of
your dorm during exams. While
you tried to find a place to stay,
all your belongings were stolen.
You wind up sleeping with other
homeless by San Francisquito
Creek.
Now you have another option
— a homeless shelter outside Ter
man Engineering Building. The
shelter is a full-scale model of the
winning design from a new fall
quarter architecture class, Civil
Engineering 223.
Individual units, a main admin
istration building and a dining fa
cility made up the shelter. The
students were given a map of the
site and the total cost. They drew
a site plan including landscaping
and parking.
The eight teams also designed
and built a scale model. The final
designs included a small squat
box, an elaborate angular design
and a model with four skylights.
The winning team had added
one thing the others overlooked
— curves.
Team member and graduate
student Antonia Del Rosso was
walking through the Quad, think
ing about the plywood model. She
noticed that the workers reinforc
ing the arches were bending
plywood. Then she realized that
curved plywood should be part of
the design.
The resulting site plan, by

Sandra Begay, put eight individ
ual units in a rough S-shape
curve. The spaces between the
curves formed small groups of
units, which added to the sense
of community.
The model and construction
plan, by Brad Aronson, features
the same S-shape on the roof of
the units. The interior is spartan,
but is wheelchair accessible and
comes with adequate storage
space.
Del Rosso, a graduate student
who was an architecture major as
an undergraduate, thought the
team was well integrated. Aron
son, a civil engineering major,
knew how to implement its plans.
Begay, a structural engineering
major who had worked in the in
dustry for some time, planned the
site.
Begay said she liked attacking
a current issue that needs a so
lution. She said, "the project
helped to stir my interest" in the
homeless issue.
Aronson thought there were
some good ideas in other projects,
although many designs called for
storage space under the bed which
is difficult for a wheelchair-bound
person. He also said, "You can
teach and bring in lecturers and
tell problems, but unless the stu
dent experiences it firsthand, it
means nothing."
Who knows, the shelter design
might even have come in handy
if it had been completed before
the Oct. 17 earthquake.
