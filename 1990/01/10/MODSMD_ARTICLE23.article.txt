# Engineering with Legos not just child's play
## 
### Dan Cory Staff writer 
Shedding their girders and
columns, some Stanford civil en
gineers are turning to Legos.
In a new architecture class of
fered autumn quarter, groups
raced to build a Lego model as
fast as possible, a deceptively in
sightful exercize that actually
helped teach students important
design criterion.

The class was shown a model
made with 39 Lego pieces. Each
team had 40 minutes to plan con
struction. When they were finally
allowed to build, the fastest group
finished in 35 seconds.
Prof. Paul Teicholz wanted the
class to give "engineers an oppor
tunity to see how architecture im
pacts what they do and (how)
architects think." Professionals
from architectural firms in the
Bay Area discussed their

specialties, including design con
straints, zoning, codes, use of in
terior space and team man
ement.
The civil engineering course,
"Architecture â€” Process and
Practice," stressed the terms and
ideas architects use in their crea
tions. Prof. Teicholz compared it
to tasting wine, saying, "You need
to be able to talk about what is
happening in the mouth."

Another important issue was
how to deal with the construction
process. An architect has to be
sure that the building can be
built. The architect also needs to
examine the working drawings to
keep the contractor from making
mistakes.
Prof. Teicholz says there is one
main message he wants the en
gineers to learn: "It doesn't cost
any more to add a little style to it."
