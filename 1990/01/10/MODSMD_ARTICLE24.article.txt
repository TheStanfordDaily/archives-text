Double-lung transplant
In what is believed to be a first ever, a Stanford
doctor transplanted a pair of lungs from a single
donor into two women last month.
Both transplants were performed by Dr.
Vaughn Starnes, one of the country's foremost
transplant experts, who performed his first single
lung transplant in June. Since that time, he has
performed a total of eight lung transplants and
15 heart-lung transplants.
The twin operations, performed virtually si
multaneously, lasted five hours on Dec. 9. The
recipients were Mary Jane Anderson, 29, of
Carlsbad, Calif, and Patty Dirschl, 40, of Rancho
Cordova. The lung donor was a 21-year-old man
from Castro Valley who also donated his heart
for a transplant at Pacific Medical Center in San
Francisco.
Just the day before, Starnes transplanted a
lung in Brian Youngs, an 11-month-old San Jose

boy believed to be the youngest ever to receive
a single-lung transplant.
Keeping the fat off
A little sweat and a prod might just be better
than eating less, Stanford scientists have shown.
Many overweight men turn to diets to shave
off pounds, but regular aerobic exercise and en
couragement may be more effective, a recent Stan
ford study shows.
The study of middle-aged overweight men,
printed in last month's copy of Archives of In
ternal Medicine, showed that the average man
receiving encouraging phone calls and printed
materials containing weight-loss information
gained back only one to two pounds in a year
as opposed to men in the control group which
gained nine to 10 pounds in the same period.
The research was performed by Dr. Abby King
and colleagues.
