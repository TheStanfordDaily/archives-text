AQ. Why are there holes in Swiss
• cheese?
.Swiss cheese, like most
• cheese, is made by first cur
dling the milk, which is adding
acid or rennet so the fat and
protein lump together, and then
letting it ferment.
The bacteria giving Swiss
cheese its flavor and texture ex
hale carbon dioxide. Bubbles of
the gas get caught in the thick
ening cheese and form the holes.
Q. Why do bugs always get
• squashed on my windshield
wnen driving down the highway?
Most of the air moves in a stream
over the car, so why doesn't it just
carry the bugs to safety? (No of
fense meant to you, the Science
Bug, who I know would never go
near fast moving windshields.)
A. Because insects are a lot
. heavier than air (I know I

am — especially now after the
food-filled holiday season), they
are not easily deflected over cars
and other moving objects, said
Aeronautics and Astronautics
Prof. Donald Baganoff.
"Because of their greater mass,
they just plow right into the
windshield," he said.
However, according to Jearl
Walker's "Flying Circus of
Physics," it is not the collision
with the car that kills the unfor
tunate bugs. The force of the air,
while not strong enough to save
the insects, causes them to rup
ture before they even reach the
windshield — no wonder my
mother always told me to look
both ways before crossing the
street.
