Progress is being made across

agreements to end use of ozone

as states implement local recycling

we have addressed just the tip of
iceberg — or rather, one dis
posable diaper in a mammoth
trash heap.
That's where Stanford students
come into the picture. In an ad
dress to a small number of Stan
ford faculty and students last
month, Sen. A 1 Gore, the leading
"Green" on Capitol Hill, called on
Stanford students to take action

on the environment, much like
students led the fray in the civil
rights movement of the 19605.
By talcing the needs of the
planet into consideration in their
respective fields of work, Stanford
students can be leaders of im
minent societal change.
The good news is that Stanford
graduates will not only be acting
in the best interest of humanity.
By responding to national and in
ternational consumer and govern
mental demand, they will help the
United States regain a competi
tive economic edge.
Forward-looking students can
benefit themselves by taking ad
vantage of new markets, trends
and needs within the context of
professional and personal life.
For example, potential doctors
have the chance to address reduc
tion, or at least safe disposal, of
medical waste in light of the
recent proliferation of needles on
public beaches.
Medical students can also con
sider the value of protecting rain
forests for research of new rem
edies. Recently tests have begun
on DMDP, a complex alkaloid
produced by a Panamanian vine,
to see how the chemical can help

in the treatment of AIDS, diabetes
and cancer.
Urban planners in the next few
years will be challenged to solve
problems like traffic, air pollution
and groundwater pollution. Plan
ners will succeed by helping
people live closer to their jobs,
use effective public transportation
and maintain parks and vegeta
tion to prevent erosion and pollu
tion of surface and ground water.
Lawyers-to-be should take note
of a recent Department of Justice
report of an 80 percent increase
last year in fines for environmen
tal crimes. Lawyers should also
heed the Sierra Club's scornful
comment that the increases are
"almost meaningless" in compar
ison with the number of offenders.
A definite need for more lawyers
skilled in environmental law will

emerge inevitably.
Architects, construction contrac
tors and developers can contribute
by designing more energy-efficient
homes and office buildings. Im
plementation of already-existing
techonology can save at least 50
percent and as much as 75 percent
of the electricity and 80 percent
of the oil used in the United
States without lowering the
standard of living, according to
some experts. Further design
needs such as attractive and con
venient space in homes and offices
for separation of trash for recy
cling are waiting for the enterpris
ing builder.
Accountants and economists are
currently taking stock of the
gaping absence of natural
resource accounting in current
measurements of economic

prosperity, such as the gross na
tional product. The fallacy is that
erosion, pollution, deforestation
and extinction are not realistically
reflected as losses in assessments
of future income.
Stanford students could play a
large part in devising effective
methods for incorporating the
value of previously unaccounted
for assets such as wild species and
fertile land into economic decision
making.
Students planning to be inter
national developers can use
knowledge of environmental
issues in conjunction with anthro
pology, history, political science
and sociology. The Third World is
crying out for programs that work
in harmony with traditional cul
tural values to promote sus
tainable development.
The Lua people of Thailand
once believed the land belonged
to the gods and took great pains
to maintain its arability. If
Westerners had seen the value of
that belief in land conservation
earlier, a lot of damage could have
been averted.
