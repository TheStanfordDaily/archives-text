# Latest Macintosh virus can be more than a little annoying
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
While many of you were in the midst
of studying for finals at the end of fall
quarter, an unfriendly visitor was making
its way across campus preparing to make
you miserable in the new year.
The visitor is a computer virus and it
goes by the name wDEF. It joins a long
list of Macintosh viruses that have proven
themselves to be quite annoying and, of
tentimes, quite damaging to your produc
tivity on the Macintosh.
Computer viruses are small programs
written by malicious souls that are de
signed to "infect" computers. They take
up residence somewhere on a hard drive
or floppy disk and muck with the proper
functioning of your computer. In addi
tion, viruses replicate themselves on all
disks and file servers they come in contact
with.
When your Mac contracts a virus and
a friend puts a disk in your computer,
she might then bring the virus to her
computer. Her hard disk could then be
come infected and, before you know it,
the virus will be all over campus.
In the past, Macintosh viruses have

infected both system files
and applications. Whenever
the Macintosh accessed the
system (it does this all the
time) or you used an infec
ted application, the virus
could spread. Most viruses,
though, have been rela
tively benign thus far.
They've slowed things
down and caused some ran-

dom system errors, but
none have done damage to data
stored on disk.
The wDEF virus is also relatively harm
less. It infects the desktop file, an invis
ible file that stores information about
what you've got on a disk and where it's
located. When wDEF takes up residence
in your desktop file, all it does is attempt
to replicate itself whenever the desktop
file is accessed.
The Macintosh needs to access the
desktop file in all sorts of instances. Ex
amples include: opening folders, using
desk accessories, copying files, using ap
plications.
If you're not plugged into a network,
you might not notice wDEF is around.
It will slow things down only marginally.

On an Apple Talk network
though, wDEF is infuriat
ing. Whenever it gets acti
vated, it attempts to place
itself on any attached hard
drives, any inserted floppy
disks and any file server
currently available.
Your computer can be
come completely unusuable
for two minutes at a time

while wDEF tries to spread
its progeny. And, the virus doesn't realize
when its infected everything. That means
everytime it gets activated it'll hang up
the Macintosh for the same length of
time.
Imagine needing to look for a file that's
in one of five folders. Let's say it's in
the fifth one but you don't know this
yet. It takes 10 minutes just to open all
five folders. The wDEF virus can easily
drive a Mac user batty.
Fortunately, it is easy to eliminate
wDEF from infected hard disks. All you
have to do is "rebuild" the desktop file
using a function that's built in to the
Macintosh system software. When you
start the computer, hold down the com
mand and option keys simultaneously

The wDEF virus can
easily drive a Macin
tosh user batty.

(the command key is the one next to the
space bar with a cloverleaf symbol and
sometimes an apple as well).
When the Macintosh is done booting,
it will ask you if you want to rebuild the
desktop on your hard disk and inform
you that it might take a few minutes.
Click OK and wait. It will then ask you
the same question about any attached
file servers. Click OK again.
Network users be forewarned: If you
rebuild the desktop on your hard drive
and the file server but another user's
hard disk is still infected, that user will
reinfect the server which will in turn
reinfect your hard drive — and any
floppies you use. Argh!
While eliminating wDEF from your sys
tem isn't all that difficult, protecting
yourself from it is. I only know of two
virus protection programs that can stop
the virus from infecting your system.

They are SAM from Symantec and Virex
from HJC. Both packages include a star
tup document, or INIT, that blocks in
fection.
Symantec failed to ship The Daily our
SAM upgrade here but they were very
apologetic and helpful when I called to
complain. They promised me would
arrive within three days. I haven t dealt
with HJC, but I understand they are
helpful as well.
If you're interested in purchasing
either package, stop by Computer Ware
on California Ave. or call Mac Connection
at (800) 334-4444. If you're lost without
your Mac, either program is a worthwhile
expenditure.
SAM is easier to use and is thus
preferred here. Virex, however, is more
likely to warn you about unknown viruses
due to a more sophisticated protection
scheme. It would not have protected you
against wDEF without its latest upgrade,
though.
If you have any question about wDEF
or computer viruses call Academic Infor
mation Resources or drop a note by the
Daily offices to my attention. If I get
enough mail, I'll answer some in a future
column.

When your Mac contracts a virus and
a friend puts a disk in your computer,
she might then bring the virus to her
computer. Her hard disk could then be
come infected and, before you know it,
the virus will be all over campus.
In the past, Macintosh viruses have

infected both system files
and applications. Whenever
the Macintosh accessed the
system (it does this all the
time) or you used an infec
ted application, the virus
could spread. Most viruses,
though, have been rela
tively benign thus far.
They've slowed things
down and caused some ran-

dom system errors, but
none have done damage to data
stored on disk.
The wDEF virus is also relatively harm
less. It infects the desktop file, an invis
ible file that stores information about
what you've got on a disk and where it's
located. When wDEF takes up residence
in your desktop file, all it does is attempt
to replicate itself whenever the desktop
file is accessed.
The Macintosh needs to access the
desktop file in all sorts of instances. Ex
amples include: opening folders, using
desk accessories, copying files, using ap
plications.
If you're not plugged into a network,
you might not notice wDEF is around.
It will slow things down only marginally.

On an Apple Talk network
though, wDEF is infuriat
ing. Whenever it gets acti
vated, it attempts to place
itself on any attached hard
drives, any inserted floppy
disks and any file server
currently available.
Your computer can be
come completely unusuable
for two minutes at a time

while wDEF tries to spread
its progeny. And, the virus doesn't realize
when its infected everything. That means
everytime it gets activated it'll hang up
the Macintosh for the same length of
time.
Imagine needing to look for a file that's
in one of five folders. Let's say it's in
the fifth one but you don't know this
yet. It takes 10 minutes just to open all
five folders. The wDEF virus can easily
drive a Mac user batty.
Fortunately, it is easy to eliminate
wDEF from infected hard disks. All you
have to do is "rebuild" the desktop file
using a function that's built in to the
Macintosh system software. When you
start the computer, hold down the com
mand and option keys simultaneously

The wDEF virus can
easily drive a Macin
tosh user batty.

(the command key is the one next to the
space bar with a cloverleaf symbol and
sometimes an apple as well).
When the Macintosh is done booting,
it will ask you if you want to rebuild the
desktop on your hard disk and inform
you that it might take a few minutes.
Click OK and wait. It will then ask you
the same question about any attached
file servers. Click OK again.
Network users be forewarned: If you
rebuild the desktop on your hard drive
and the file server but another user's
hard disk is still infected, that user will
reinfect the server which will in turn
reinfect your hard drive — and any
floppies you use. Argh!
While eliminating wDEF from your sys
tem isn't all that difficult, protecting
yourself from it is. I only know of two
virus protection programs that can stop
the virus from infecting your system.

They are SAM from Symantec and Virex
from HJC. Both packages include a star
tup document, or INIT, that blocks in
fection.
Symantec failed to ship The Daily our
SAM upgrade here but they were very
apologetic and helpful when I called to
complain. They promised me would
arrive within three days. I haven t dealt
with HJC, but I understand they are
helpful as well.
If you're interested in purchasing
either package, stop by Computer Ware
on California Ave. or call Mac Connection
at (800) 334-4444. If you're lost without
your Mac, either program is a worthwhile
expenditure.
SAM is easier to use and is thus
preferred here. Virex, however, is more
likely to warn you about unknown viruses
due to a more sophisticated protection
scheme. It would not have protected you
against wDEF without its latest upgrade,
though.
If you have any question about wDEF
or computer viruses call Academic Infor
mation Resources or drop a note by the
Daily offices to my attention. If I get
enough mail, I'll answer some in a future
column.

While many of you were in the midst
of studying for finals at the end of fall
quarter, an unfriendly visitor was making
its way across campus preparing to make
you miserable in the new year.
The visitor is a computer virus and it
goes by the name wDEF. It joins a long
list of Macintosh viruses that have proven
themselves to be quite annoying and, of
tentimes, quite damaging to your produc
tivity on the Macintosh.
Computer viruses are small programs
written by malicious souls that are de
signed to "infect" computers. They take
up residence somewhere on a hard drive
or floppy disk and muck with the proper
functioning of your computer. In addi
tion, viruses replicate themselves on all
disks and file servers they come in contact
with.

a friend puts a disk in your computer,
she might then bring the virus to her
computer. Her hard disk could then be
come infected and, before you know it,
