## NCAA votes to cut bucks Hoops season slashed to 25 games for '92 
### 
DALLAS (AP) - The NCAA
voted Tuesday to slice three
games off the basketball season
and reveal each school's gradua
tion rate for athletes, but its ef
forts to reform big-time college
sports almost tripped over the
starting line.
The convention was more like
a labored, confused chess match
than a Final Four thriller as it
took five ballots and four hours
of parliamentary wrangling and
power struggles to kill, then revive
and finally pass the reduction in
basketball games, which begins
with the 1992-93 season.
"It sends a message that people
are serious about kids missing
class time," said Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery. "I'm not sure
25 games is the answer, but it's
a start."
"I think there will be com
promises before the rule goes into
effect in 1992," Montgomery con
tinued. "I'm kind of surprised at
the rule, but I'm sure there will
be more discussions in the years
ahead."
The measure was labeled a
"watershed" in the NCAA Presi
dents Commission effort to reform
big-time athletics and relieve pres
sure on athletes. It was favored
as a move to give athletes more
time for study, but opposed as a
costly cash crunch for schools,
which could lose up to $1.5 million
per year.
"This is the most important
thing at this convention," pleaded
Greg O'Brien, president of the
University of New Orleans, after
the basketball cuts crashed in
flames on its first vote.
"It is a signal of great impor
tance beyond this room ... that
reforms are going forward,"
O'Brien said.
"It was not a pretty victory. It
was a messy victory, but I think
we got it done," Wake Forest pres
ident Thomas Hearn, like O'Brien
a member of the Presidents Com
mission, said after the final vote.
The NCAA delegates also ap
proved compromise cuts in spring
football practice, reducing prac
tice days from 20 to 15, and limit

ing contact drills to 10 of those
days.
The Presidents Commission
had proposed halving spring foot
ball to 10 days and eliminating
contact drills altogether in the
spring.
But the hardest-fought battle
was over the basketball cuts,
which included a compromise
measure restoring exemptions to
the 25-game limit for preseason
tournaments, and moving the
start of preseason practice to Nov.
1 from Oct. 15.
The three-game cut was
defeated initially on a vote that
put it off until next year's con
vention. Schools said they could
lose up to $250,000 per year from
three fewer basketball games —
too much, some athletic directors
said, for the NCAA to sacrifice
for library-time for athletes.
Indiana athletic director Haydn
Murray estimated the Hoosiers
would lose $600,000 per year.
Jake Crouthamel, athletic di
rector at Syracuse, which seats
32,000 in its Carrier Dome and
leads the nation in attendance,
said he wouldn't say how much
his school would lose beyond "a
lot." But a source close to the
program estimated three fewer
home games could set Syracuse
back $1.5 million.
"It's big money sorely needed,"
said Brad Hovious, athletic direc
tor at Texas-El Paso. "Two or
three basketball games can pay
for three or four non-revenue
sports."
"It is better in my opinion to
take no action than to approve
what seems to be a patch-quilt
series of measures that really do
not address the scope of the prob
lem," said Allan Hauser, faculty
representative from Appalachian
State.
The difficulty in winning ap
proval for the cuts in athletic com
mitments cut to the heart of the
battle within the NCAA over
whether to de-emphasize athle
tics.
The three-game basketball cut
was killed in Division I by a 170-
150 vote to refer it to the 1991
» 1 P •* ". * » tt > H 1

convention, but revived on a 165-
156 vote and eventually approved,
206-116.
"The message (the NCAA
should send) is less time in the
athletics facility, more time in the
library," added John Hogan, fac
ulty representative from the
Colorado School of Mines.
"We must give these kids more
time away from football and bas
ketball," Penn State football coach
Joe Paterno said. "I am concerned
that we don't walk away from
this thinking that because we've
eliminated a little spring practice
that that's going to solve some of
the problems we have."
Said UCLA Chancellor Charles
Young: "The presidents stood our
ground and fought and fought."
The NCAA members voted
overwhelmingly to make public
each school's graduation rate for
athletes beginning next year. With
only a handful of dissenters, they
also agreed that schools must give
graduation rates to prospective
athletes during recruiting.
The NCAA has been under pres
sure from Congress, which is con
sidering legislation to force the
release of the rates.
The disclosure of the gradua
tion rates was seen as putting
more pressure on coaches to allow
more time for study.
"We either take this action for
ourselves or we'll have it done for
us," Texas Christian chancellor
Bill Tucker said. "If it's done for
us, it will be done to us."
Delegates also approved a res
olution calling for recommenda
tions to reduce time demands in
sports other than football and bas
ketball, with changes to be voted
on at next year's convention.
The Presidents Commission
succeeded initially in its reform
efforts by winning approval for
Proposition 48, which set aca
demic mimimums for in-coming
athletes, and the "death penalty"
for repeat rules violators.
On Wednesday, the convention
is expected to decide whether to
stiffen the penalties for drug vio
lations, and begin year-round test
ing for steroids* >-* „
