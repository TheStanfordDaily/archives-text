# Students help develop course
## Ethnic studies class designed to fill gap in curriculum 
### Aaron Thode 
A course being offered for the
first time this quarter is innova
tive in two ways: It fills a crucial
gap in Stanford's ethnic studies
curriculum, and it was developed
to an unprecedented degree by un
dergraduates.
"Race and Ethnicity and the
American Experience" is being
taught by History Profs. Albert
Camarillo and George Fredrick
son with the assistance of five
undergraduates: Rhonda Andrew,
John Cuerva, Corey Davis, Kath
erine Schaefer and Richard Suh.
Thomas Jackson, a graduate stu
dent, was also part of the group
that developed the course.
Camarillo said he hoped the
course would impart to students

Besides providing a
framework and broad
overview of the role
of ethnic groups in
America, the course
can serve as a
springboard for more
in-depth study.

"a basic awareness of how ethnic
and racial minorities have adapted
and contended with American so
ciety, and conversely, how Amer
ican society has responded and
still responds to these groups."

Andrew, a junior in sociology
and public policy, said, "I felt a
course like this was really needed
at Stanford, and the people in
volved really cared about the sub
ject." Camarillo agreed, stating
that Stanford lags behind other
universities in ethnic studies pro
grams.
American Studies major
Schaefer said that besides provid
ing "a framework and broad over
view" of the role of ethnic groups
in America, the course can serve
as a springboard for more in
depth study
Between 50 and 60 people
showed up for the first class ses
sion yesterday, but organizers
noted that the time had been
listed incorrectly in the Time
Schedule. The class will be held
at 10 a.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
The course had its beginnings
in a report issued by the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
in 1987, which suggested that the
American Studies Program should
offer more multicultural courses.
The department asked Camarillo
and Fredrickson to develop a
course in ethnic studies.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow was trying to find
ways to get students involved in
developing courses, so Camarillo
suggested that the infant course
could become a pilot program for
professor-student cooperation.
Subsequently, Camarillo formed
an "ad hoc" group of undergrad
uates who were interested in the
subject, giving them a list of pos
sible required readings to evalu
ate. Over the summer, the group
met six times to revise the read

ings and flesh out the course.
Besides serving as discussion
leaders, some students will give
short presentations during the
course. For example, drama major
Corey Davis will give a half-hour
talk about the role of the black
church in the black community.
