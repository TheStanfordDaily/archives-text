# Students help develop course
## Ethnic studies class designed to fill gap in curriculum 
### Aaron Thode 
A course being offered for the
first time this quarter is innova
tive in two ways: It fills a crucial
gap in Stanford's ethnic studies
curriculum, and it was developed
to an unprecedented degree by un
dergraduates.
"Race and Ethnicity and the
American Experience" is being
taught by History Profs. Albert
Camarillo and George Fredrick
son with the assistance of five
undergraduates: Rhonda Andrew,
John Cuerva, Corey Davis, Kath
erine Schaefer and Richard Suh.
Thomas Jackson, a graduate stu
dent, was also part of the group
that developed the course.
Camarillo said he hoped the
course would impart to students

Besides providing a
framework and broad
overview of the role
of ethnic groups in
America, the course
can serve as a
springboard for more
in-depth study.

"a basic awareness of how ethnic
and racial minorities have adapted
and contended with American so
ciety, and conversely, how Amer
ican society has responded and
still responds to these groups."

Andrew, a junior in sociology
and public policy, said, "I felt a
course like this was really needed
at Stanford, and the people in
volved really cared about the sub
ject." Camarillo agreed, stating
that Stanford lags behind other
universities in ethnic studies pro
grams.
American Studies major
Schaefer said that besides provid
ing "a framework and broad over
view" of the role of ethnic groups
in America, the course can serve
as a springboard for more in
depth study
