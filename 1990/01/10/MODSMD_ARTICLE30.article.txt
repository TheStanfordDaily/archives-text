# Cardinal hoop hunters stalk juicy postseason prize
## 
### 
When the best player in school his
tory graduates to the NBA —
and five of his top teammates
also bid farewell to the Farm — the
conventional wisdom states it will be a
rebuilding year.
The Stanford men's basketball team,
at 9-2 and receiving votes in the Associ
ated Press poll, is doing a mighty fine
job of throwing the conventional wisdom
for a loop.
Exactly how good the team is should
! become apparent in the next two weeks
! as the Cardinal heads to Washington this
J weekend and then returns home to face
| the Southern California schools next
' week.
What the early returns show is that
! Stanford has beaten all the teams it was
| "supposed to beat" and lost to "superior"
opponents. Yet the 9-2 record is surpris
ing to the pundits. So much so that the
notion of a postseason berth, believed to
be ludicrous just a month ago, seems well
! within the realm of possibility.
, To get there the Cardinal will need to
; perform better in certain areas where it

is currently falling short. At the same
time, the team must hold on to the con
siderable edge it has in other aspects of
the game.
The following is an attempt to analyze
some of those strengths and weaknesses.
The Big Man: As a freshman, Adam
Keefe gave Cardinal fans a glimpse of
what was to come. He showed superb
low-post moves, deadly accurate shooting
and dominant rebounding ability.
This season, he's given Stanford all
that — in greater quantity — despite
facing constant double- and triple

teaming. Keefe is shooting 64 percent
from the field and posting a double
double (points and rebounds) in nearly
every game. Free-throw shooting, the
only question mark in Keefe's game last
season, has become a strength as the
red-head has posted a 78 percent mark
from the stripe.
There is little doubt that Keefe has a
future in the NBA at the power forward
spot. As a starter.
After the Oregon game Sunday, a
reporter questioned whether Keefe was
a good passer in the low post. Coach
Mike Montgomery said he felt Keefe was
but that it was more important that he
shoot the ball. Keefe is averaging a mere
13 shots per game — a shocking figure
for a franchise player.
Stanford needs to find a way to get
him the ball more, and preferably without
him being surrounded by three players.
For that to happen the Cardinal needs . . .
More offensive options: Last year's
NCAA tournament team could give the
ball to Todd Lichti, Howard Wright, Eric
Reveno or Terry Taylor and expect to

score. Defenses knew that and it forced
them to play each player honestly. Often
times, that created an open shot for some
one.
So far in the 1989-90 season, Stanford's
options have been more limited. Outside
of Keefe, the only consistent scorer has
been shooting guard Kenny Ammann,
who is hitting 52 percent of his field goal
attempts. Center Derek Bruton, forwards
Andrew Vlahov and Deshon Wingate, and
guard John Patrick have all provided of
fensive spurts but none has done the job
steadily. (Wingate, incidentally, is making
a strong bid for the mythical Pacific 10
Conference Most Improved Player
Award.)
It's for that reason opponents have been
able to collapse on Keefe, who is
remarkably the only Stanford player to
have scored 20 points in a game this
season. If the Cardinal can get more scor
ing out of other positions, it will be a
much more dominant team.
Perhaps the most beneficial develop
ment would be solid three-point shooting.
Patrick converted on six treys in the loss

to Oregon State. If he can hit the three
at the 42 percent clip he's currently pos
ting it would be a huge boost.
The Cardinal's backup guards also need
to look more toward scoring. Whether
Marcus Lollie, Kenny Hicks and Peter
Dukes can hit the three-pointer isn't
clear. What is clear is that Lollie and
Dukes have reputations as slashing,
penetrator types. They haven't yet made
many forays into the lane, though.
As first-year players, that isn't surpris
ing. But as their confidence mounts, some
drives to the hoop will correct scoring
opportunities for them and also open
shots for the Cardinal's big men and
perimeter players.
Other possibilities include playing
Keefe some in the high post, thereby
unclogging the middle. Keefe has a nice
medium-range jumper and could open up
opportunities down low for Bruton and
Wingate.
If Stanford's starting small forward
could find some rhythm on offense that


MARK ROGOWSKY
would be one of the most desirable
options of all which brings us to
The Vlahov factor: At 6-foot-7,
225 pounds Andrew Vlahov is an
imposing physical presence at the
"small" forward position — at any
position, for that matter. Vlahov
is an excellent defender, has a nose
for the ball and is one of the best
passing forwards in the Pac-10.
He's also the guy who keeps the
team loose with his sense of
humor while simultaneously
being a team leader. Vlahov also
is one of Stanford's three-point
shooters.
Not that he's made very many
this season. As a matter of fact,
Vlahov is only shooting .111 from
behind the arc. Many coaches
might tell the big Australian to
stop shooting the rainbow at this
point, but not Montgomery.
The Cardinal coach knows that
Vlahov can hit the shot. He sees
Vlahov knock down three after
three after three in practice. Dur
ing games, though, Vlahov often
hesitates before releasing and
ends up pushing the shot instead
of shooting it with proper form.
If he develops a modicum of
consistency, it will open up things
a great deal and give major head
aches to opposing coaches as they
try to design defenses to stop
Stanford. Meanwhile, Stanford is
playing the role of . ..
Defensive stopper: For fear of
getting carried away with this, let
me say that with the Cardinal's
deliberate offense few opponents
should post scores near 100. Still,

it's hard to argue with the per
formance of the Stanford defense
so far.
Only three of Stanford's 11 foes
have scored over 60 points as the
Cardinal's man-to-man defense
has made it tough to find open
shots. In addition, Montgomery's
zone is well on its way to becom
ing a viable option.
Stanford should probably be
doing a better job of defending
the three-pointer but the overall
effort cannot be argued with. On
the other side of the ball, oppo
nents are pressing the Cardinal
like it's a wrinkled shirt. Normally
that results in . . .
Turnover trouble: And, as a
matter of fact, Stanford is having
plenty. The Cardinal gives the ball
up on miscues 17 times per game.
Few of them, however, are forced
by the press. Many come in the
halfcourt on traveling calls,
dropped passes and balls being
thrown away.
While Stanford isn't being hurt
by the press, it isn't hurting op
ponents who employ it. With
defenses overplaying in the back
court, the Cardinal must do more
to push the ball across the time
line and take advantage of the
two-on-one opportunities that are
available.
Montgomery, Keefe and Am
mann all acknowledged this after
the Oregon game and talked about
making adjustments. The team
realizes it must recognize when
the press is vulnerable so don't
be surprised if Stanford gets some
easy layups off it in the near fu
ture.
That taken care of the Cardinal
can continue to exploit its biggest
advantages . ..
Shooting and rebounding:

While Stanford
isn't being hurt by
the press, it isn't
hurting opponents
who employ it.

Stanford excels at two of the most
fundamental aspects of the game
— putting the ball in the hoop
and cleaning the glass.
The Cardinal is outshooting its
opponents .503 to .426 with Stan
ford's gaudy total coming as the
result of solid shot selection. On
the boards foes collect 27.3
rebounds per game to the Cardi
nal's 38. That's a big, big edge.
Eliminate a few of the miscues
and Stanford could easily score
6-10 more points per contest.
Intangibles: For the Cardinal
to succeed on the road, it will
have to pull together mentally and
play mistake-free ball. There's
nothing the fan can do to help.
At home, though, you can do
your part. The Maples attendance
average is a mere 4,807 (though
it was admittedly depressed a bit
by winter break). The crowd is
loud at times, but rarely in
timidating.
Two nights ago, UNLV lost to
New Mexico State in Las Cruces.
You want to talk home-court ad
vantage . . . The Aggie fans were
insane for 40 minutes of basket
ball, screaming all the way.
Maples can be like that
(remember Arizona in '88 and
'89).
