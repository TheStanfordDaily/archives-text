# Cardinal hoop hunters stalk juicy postseason prize
## 
### 
When the best player in school his
tory graduates to the NBA —
and five of his top teammates
also bid farewell to the Farm — the
conventional wisdom states it will be a
rebuilding year.
The Stanford men's basketball team,
at 9-2 and receiving votes in the Associ
ated Press poll, is doing a mighty fine
job of throwing the conventional wisdom
for a loop.
Exactly how good the team is should
! become apparent in the next two weeks
! as the Cardinal heads to Washington this
J weekend and then returns home to face
| the Southern California schools next
' week.
What the early returns show is that
! Stanford has beaten all the teams it was
| "supposed to beat" and lost to "superior"
opponents. Yet the 9-2 record is surpris
ing to the pundits. So much so that the
notion of a postseason berth, believed to
be ludicrous just a month ago, seems well
! within the realm of possibility.
, To get there the Cardinal will need to
; perform better in certain areas where it

is currently falling short. At the same
time, the team must hold on to the con
siderable edge it has in other aspects of
the game.
The following is an attempt to analyze
some of those strengths and weaknesses.
The Big Man: As a freshman, Adam
Keefe gave Cardinal fans a glimpse of
what was to come. He showed superb
low-post moves, deadly accurate shooting
and dominant rebounding ability.
This season, he's given Stanford all
that — in greater quantity — despite
facing constant double- and triple

teaming. Keefe is shooting 64 percent
from the field and posting a double
double (points and rebounds) in nearly
every game. Free-throw shooting, the
only question mark in Keefe's game last
season, has become a strength as the
red-head has posted a 78 percent mark
from the stripe.
There is little doubt that Keefe has a
future in the NBA at the power forward
spot. As a starter.
After the Oregon game Sunday, a
reporter questioned whether Keefe was
a good passer in the low post. Coach
Mike Montgomery said he felt Keefe was
but that it was more important that he
shoot the ball. Keefe is averaging a mere
13 shots per game — a shocking figure
for a franchise player.
Stanford needs to find a way to get
him the ball more, and preferably without
him being surrounded by three players.
For that to happen the Cardinal needs . . .
More offensive options: Last year's
NCAA tournament team could give the
ball to Todd Lichti, Howard Wright, Eric
Reveno or Terry Taylor and expect to

score. Defenses knew that and it forced
them to play each player honestly. Often
times, that created an open shot for some
one.
So far in the 1989-90 season, Stanford's
options have been more limited. Outside
of Keefe, the only consistent scorer has
been shooting guard Kenny Ammann,
who is hitting 52 percent of his field goal
attempts. Center Derek Bruton, forwards
Andrew Vlahov and Deshon Wingate, and
guard John Patrick have all provided of
fensive spurts but none has done the job
steadily. (Wingate, incidentally, is making
a strong bid for the mythical Pacific 10
Conference Most Improved Player
Award.)
It's for that reason opponents have been
able to collapse on Keefe, who is
remarkably the only Stanford player to
have scored 20 points in a game this
season. If the Cardinal can get more scor
ing out of other positions, it will be a
much more dominant team.
Perhaps the most beneficial develop
ment would be solid three-point shooting.
Patrick converted on six treys in the loss

to Oregon State. If he can hit the three
at the 42 percent clip he's currently pos
ting it would be a huge boost.
The Cardinal's backup guards also need
to look more toward scoring. Whether
Marcus Lollie, Kenny Hicks and Peter
Dukes can hit the three-pointer isn't
clear. What is clear is that Lollie and
Dukes have reputations as slashing,
penetrator types. They haven't yet made
many forays into the lane, though.
As first-year players, that isn't surpris
ing. But as their confidence mounts, some
drives to the hoop will correct scoring
opportunities for them and also open
shots for the Cardinal's big men and
perimeter players.
Other possibilities include playing
Keefe some in the high post, thereby
unclogging the middle. Keefe has a nice
medium-range jumper and could open up
opportunities down low for Bruton and
Wingate.
If Stanford's starting small forward
could find some rhythm on offense that
