"Very few people have made
such an impact on Stanford tennis
as have Renker and Neer," said
Gould, who succeeded Renker as
Stanford's men's coach in 1967.
"The tennis world in general is
the loser with their passing. Neer
was so influential in getting tennis
off the ground at Stanford,"
Gould continued.
"As for Coach Renker, no one
knows better than I what a tre
mendous impact he had on his
players' lives. He should be
credited with establishing the suc
cessful base for the Stanford ten
nis program as we know it today."
