# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
While most students were home during
the break, ripping open presents and trying
to stay warm, the Stanford men's and wom
en's basketball teams were hitting the
hardwood, ripping down rebounds and get
ting very hot.
The Stanford women, ranked No. 2 in the
nation, whipped previously second-ranked
Tennessee 85-71 to open the holidays and

have carried their championship momentum
to an 11-0 mark, 2-0 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference.
Meanwhile, the men's team, expected to
collapse after the loss of Todd Lichti and
Co., have managed to keep winning, racing
to a 9-2 start.
Because of their Scrooge-like defense and
team-leading point production during the
break, Jennifer Azzi and Adam Keefe are
the Athletes of the Break.
Azzi, a 5-9 senior guard from Oak Ridge,
Tenn., leads the team in scoring with just
over 16 points per game after being named
Pac-10 Player of the Year and a Kodak Ail-
American last season.
Against her home rival Lady Vols on Dec.
15, Azzi drilled a three-pointer with 4:22
left in the game to ignite a record Maples
Pavilion crowd and slam the door on the
Lady Vols, 74-58.
And then at the Cardinal Classic she con
tinued her three-point show, hitting a Stan
ford and NCAA record 7-for-7 from beyond
the bonus-point stripe against Eastern Mich
igan. Azzi scored 43 points in the Classic
and was named the MVP.

Keefe, a 6-9, 230-pound sophomore from
Irvine, Calif., has continued to improve his
offensive play in the paint.
He began the break by being named the
Pac-10 Player of the Week, shooting 11-of-12
in a 74-53 win over USF. Against Santa
Clara, he tallied 24 points and grabbed 13

boards against the oafish Bronco frontcourt.
His 20 points against Kansas in a losing
effort and 23 points against Oregon Sunday
helped get Stanford votes in the Associated
Press lop 25.
Keefe s inside battering helps the outside
shooting of Stanford's guards, and bodes
well for a better-than-expected Pac-10 ex
cursion in 1990.
