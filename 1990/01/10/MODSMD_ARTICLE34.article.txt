COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -
Clemson football coaches are ac
cused by the NCAA of more than
a dozen illegal recruiting contacts
and of giving players up to $150
in cash from 1984 to 1988, ac
cording to a report released Tues
day.
The school made the NCAA
report and its allegations public
four days after receiving it, but
erased all references that might
allow those named in the 15-page
document to be identified. Under
NCAA rules, the organization is
prohibited from publicizing such
allegations, but allows schools to
release information on charges.
Clemson's football team
defeated Stanford 27-21 in the
1986 Gator Bowl, as Coach Jack
Elway's Cardinal finished the year
with an 8-4 mark.
Clemson president Max Lennon
said in a statement accompanying
the report that the school would
"take all appropriate steps to
protect the integrity of the uni
versity" in wake of the allegations.
Lennon was at the NCAA conven
tion in Dallas and could not be
reached for comment.
If Clemson is found guilty of
the violations levied by the NCAA,
the school could be placed on
probation for the second time in
less than 10 years. The NCAA
slapped Clemson with two years
probation in November 1982 tor
70 violations that occurred be
tween 1976 and 1982 under
coaches Charlie Pell and Danny
Ford, who was named head coach
in December 1978.
The NCAA has charged the At
lantic Coast Conference school
with 14 rule violations, the most

serious being cash payments of
$15 to $150 to players and
recruits by both coaches and
boosters and illegal contacts with
recruits.
In its report, the NCAA said
that on at least two occasions dur
ing the fall of 1985 a coach gave
a player $50 to $150 and told him
to distribute the money to
"selected" players.
And twice in the spring of 1987,
a "representative of the universi
ty's athletic interests" — most
likely a booster — gave $50 to
two athletes for their personal
use, the report said.
In the most damaging recruit
ing allegation, the NCAA said that
from November 1984 to Septem
ber 1987 six coaches made 11 il
legal recruiting contacts, which in
cluded meeting with four high
school juniors and one sophomore.
The NCAA does not allow col
lege coaches in-person recruiting
of players until after they have
completed their junior year in
high school.
Three coaches also are charged
with contacting during the 1985-
86 academic year two recruits
more than the three times allowed
by NCAA regulations, the report
said.
The NCAA also questioned the
financial aid provided a Clemson
player in the 1988 spring semester
after the athlete's eligiblity had
run out. The NCAA said the
player's financial aid exceeded the
value of his scholarship because
of his part-time work at a Clem
son business, where he earned
about $200 each month. The
report does not say how many
months the player worked.
