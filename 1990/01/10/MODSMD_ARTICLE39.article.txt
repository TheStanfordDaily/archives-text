The titled alumni of Harvard
Harvard University may profess to be striving
to fight its image as a citadel of the privileged.
Sometimes, however, the Harvard of old peeps
through the modern curtain.
In a new questionnaire, the school asks its
graduates to list their proper titles. For alumni
not content with Mr., Miss, Mrs. or Ms., Harvard
offers 43 other choices.
Admiral? General? Baron? Countess? Chief Jus
tice? The Right Honorable Lord? His Royal High
ness? Please check all that apply.
Charles Egan Jr., the president of the Harvard
Alumni Association, said there was nothing un
usual about the survey.
Egan, who signed a letter accompanying the
survey that urged the alumni to fill out the
questionnaire, said at least four Chief Justices
of the Massachusetts Supreme Court were grad
uates of Harvard Law School, and at least two
alumni bore the title "His Royal Highness."
Barbara Welanetz, a spokesperson for Harvard,
said the university had many illustrious alumni,
but wondered whether the survey used the right
tone. "Perhaps it was not as well thought through
as it might have been," she said.

A UCMI for gay issues at Rutgers
A committee at Rutgers University has called
on the institution to integrate the experiences of
gay men and lesbians into the curriculum and
create a "safe space" on campus where gay stu
dents can gather without fearing harassment.
The committee, which was appointed by the
president, also said the university should provide
health insurance and other benefits for the
partners of gay Rutgers employees and appoint
a full-time staff person to carry out the report's
recommendations and serve as a contact person

for gay and lesbian students.
The report is among the most wide-ranging
ever to deal with the issues that gays and lesbians
face on campus. Officials at Rutgers said they
will study it before deciding how to act on its
recommendations.
"The report will be received gratefully and will
get the careful and deliberate study it deserves,"
said Edward Bloustein, the university's president.
Copies are to be distributed soon to students,
faculty members and administrators.
Bloustein established the committee to study
the environment for homosexuals at Rutgers after
gay and lesbian students reported several inci
dents of harassment on the campus. The com
mittee's 28 members include the campus police
chief, academic deans, students and faculty mem
bers.

If you thought the ASSU was bad
The student body president at the College of
San Mateo has resigned and is under investiga
tion for allegedly purchasing a $34,000 Mercedes-
Benz and $8,000 in computer equipment and
charging it to the college's student government.
Investigators said signatures of fictitious
campus officials were found on documents used
by Christopher Martinez to buy the automobile.
On the document, Martinez claimed he had
"power of authority" to make the purchases on
behalf of the Associated Students of the college.
The college did not pay the bills, and no student
funds were lost, a college spokesperson said. Mar
tinez is no longer a student at the college, she
added.
Martinez has been arrested on a charge of
violating the terms of his probation for a con
viction on credit card fraud two years ago in San
Diego.
