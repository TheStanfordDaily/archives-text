# Freshman recounts firsthand experience of Panamanian invasion

When the United States invaded
Panama Stanford students all over the
world tuned in to the evening news or
read the newspapers from a safe distance.
But freshman Laura Drohan, a Panama
nian citizen, experienced the events of
the invasion occurring literally on her
doorstep.
Drohan, 17, a resident of Naranja
House, arrived at Stanford for her first
year of schooling in the United States
after attending a private Jesuit school in

Panama. Drohan, whose mother is Amer
ican, was born in Panama, as was her
father.
Relating the events of her winter break
to dormmates Tuesday night in Narar\ja
lounge, Drohan said she was watching
television in her home when the house
started shaking. A friend called to say
the U.S. invasion had begun. From then
on, all news came by word of mouth over
the telephone.
Drohan and her family stayed in her
house in Panama City for 10 days without
leaving, rationing food to one meal a day.

They could not sleep at night because of
the sounds of shooting and did not speak
English â€” to protect themselves from
the Panamanian Defense Forces and
former Panamanian leader Manuel Nor
iega's "dignity battalions" constantly
patrolling the city.
Drohan confirmed that the Panama
nian people had a generally positive at
titude toward the United States action.
According to Noriega, anti-American
sentiment exists, but Drohan said most
favored the U.S. for ousting a dictator
that had hurt so many so cruelly.

She witnessed the elements of excite
ment and celebration sweeping through
the vast msyority of the people as some,
heedless of danger, took photographs of
the U.S. soldiers and others uncorked
champagne bottles.
Drohan said she felt the U.S. Army
was very well-organized and did its job
reliably and efficiently. For example, if
anyone needed help defending against the
PDF, or if one knew where a distribution
of arms to a dignity battalion was located,
a call to the Army would usually take
care of the matter.

However, Drohan said she was dis
pleased with the U.S. State Department,
which deals with the safety of U.S
civilians in Panama. She did not think
the State Department acted in an organ
ized, efficient manner in trying to get
Americans and citizens from other coun
tries out of Panama to safety.
Drohan herself finally fled the cour try
on Dec. 30 with the aid of the Army. She
was able to leave because her father holds
a top position on the Panama Canal Corn-
