# Freshman recounts firsthand experience of Panamanian invasion
## 
### Reena Dhanda 
When the United States invaded
Panama Stanford students all over the
world tuned in to the evening news or
read the newspapers from a safe distance.
But freshman Laura Drohan, a Panama
nian citizen, experienced the events of
the invasion occurring literally on her
doorstep.
Drohan, 17, a resident of Naranja
House, arrived at Stanford for her first
year of schooling in the United States
after attending a private Jesuit school in

Panama. Drohan, whose mother is Amer
ican, was born in Panama, as was her
father.
Relating the events of her winter break
to dormmates Tuesday night in Narar\ja
lounge, Drohan said she was watching
television in her home when the house
started shaking. A friend called to say
the U.S. invasion had begun. From then
on, all news came by word of mouth over
the telephone.
Drohan and her family stayed in her
house in Panama City for 10 days without
leaving, rationing food to one meal a day.

They could not sleep at night because of
the sounds of shooting and did not speak
English — to protect themselves from
the Panamanian Defense Forces and
former Panamanian leader Manuel Nor
iega's "dignity battalions" constantly
patrolling the city.
Drohan confirmed that the Panama
nian people had a generally positive at
titude toward the United States action.
According to Noriega, anti-American
sentiment exists, but Drohan said most
favored the U.S. for ousting a dictator
that had hurt so many so cruelly.

She witnessed the elements of excite
ment and celebration sweeping through
the vast msyority of the people as some,
heedless of danger, took photographs of
the U.S. soldiers and others uncorked
champagne bottles.
Drohan said she felt the U.S. Army
was very well-organized and did its job
reliably and efficiently. For example, if
anyone needed help defending against the
PDF, or if one knew where a distribution
of arms to a dignity battalion was located,
a call to the Army would usually take
care of the matter.

However, Drohan said she was dis
pleased with the U.S. State Department,
which deals with the safety of U.S
civilians in Panama. She did not think
the State Department acted in an organ
ized, efficient manner in trying to get
Americans and citizens from other coun
tries out of Panama to safety.
Drohan herself finally fled the cour try
on Dec. 30 with the aid of the Army. She
was able to leave because her father holds
a top position on the Panama Canal Corn-
mission, and could find her a place
on a plane for military depen
dents.
"We were strapped into a mili
tary aircraft with our luggage on
the floor in front of us. The plane
had no heating so it was quite
cold, and we were told not to
smoke due to the explosive nature
of the cargo," she recalled.
Drohan and the other passengers
landed safely in South Carolina.
Drohan said she was upset that
Noriega sought asylum in the
Vatican embassy, adding that the
situation was ironic because Nor
iega would regularly send the PDF
to storm churches where civilian
protesters sought sanctuary.
For the future of Panama,
Drohan's outlook is pessimistic.
She said the new government is
very weak, and the nation needs
much reconstruction.
A democratic government was
overthrown 20 years ago because
the upper class, comprising 1 per
cent of the population, made the
laws and put sometimes incom
petent relatives in office to retain
their power, making it easier for
L Noriega to establish his dictator
ship, Drohan recalled.
She said the same mistake is
happening now and hopes that
new officials will be chosen ac
cording to their competence, not
"whether they are his brother, or
cousin or sister-in-law."
Drohan also said that the rea
son the Panamanian people could
never pull together and organize
a military rebellion against Nor

iega has to do with their nature.
She characterized them as more
Caribbean in nature than the rest
of Latin America, meaning the
society is more easygoing and fun -
oriented. People tend to wait for
things rather than putting effort
into achieving them, she said. For
example, the Panamanians hoped
and waited for an invasion from
the U.S. rather than grouping
their own forces and acting inde
pendently
Now that the new government
is taking control, Drohan said
massive economic aid from the
U.S. will be necessary to help the
country to its feet. The current
economic situation is bleak, espe
cially after the widespread looting
of businesses unprotected by any
police force.
Drohan also said that red tape
needs to be cleared up. She ad
vocated a new constitution and a
reorganization of the government
to expedite this process.
"To run the government, we
need practical, hands-on people
who will get down and get their
hands dirty — not idealists," she
said.
Drohan realized that she may
never be able to go back to her
homeland. "The Panama where I
grew up will never be there again.
I can only take memories away,"
she said.
She also recognized how impor
tant little things are, and "sees
the whole world in a new light."
She said she was especially grate
ful, for example, that her whole
family was able to be together for
Christmas.
"What hurt me was leaving
everything behind," she said.
