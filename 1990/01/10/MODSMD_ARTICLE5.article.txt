# Stanford police use Macintoshes to help take a bite out of crime
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
In its continuing pursuit of
campus criminals, the Stanford
Police Department has enlisted a
powerful crime-fighter — the
Macintosh computer.
Using the Mac-a-mug program,
the police department has the abil
ity to make accurate computerized
images of suspects without the
time and expense of using a police
sketch artist.
Sketches generated by the pro
gram have played an important
role in the department's search
for a suspect in a scries of indecent
exposure cases on campus, accord
ing to Stanford Police Detective
Keith Viveiros.
The Mac-a-mug program allows
the witness of a crime to choose
from a set of pictures of various
facial features to develop an over
all picture of the suspect. The pro

gram presents the witness with a
series of differently shaped heads,
eyes, noses, hair and other facial
features.
Once the witness has chosen all
of the facial features, the com
puter generates a picture of the
suspect. The police then uses a
computerized graphics program to
modify the image until it matches
the witness' mental picture exact
ly-
The result is a "fairly good rep
resentation" of the suspect that
is probably as good as one
produced by a police sketch artist,
Viveiros said.
But making the program work
is the easy part. The harder part
of the job is helping the witness
to remember what the suspect ac
tually looked like.
To accomplish this, Viveiros
said he uses "cognitive interview
ing" techniques which help to
relax witnesses so that they will

better remember the suspect.
The process of cognitive inter
viewing involves talking the wit
ness through the incident and
then asking them to mentally
"walk backwards" through the
situation, Viveiros said. By doing
this, the witness is usually able
to remember the incident in
greater detail.
Viveiros emphasized that cogni
tive interviewing does not involve
any form of suggestion or hyp
nosis on his part. Instead, the
witnesses must walk through the
incident in their own minds.
Witnesses and victims who have
been through a traumatic experi
ence often have a greater recol
lection of the face of an attacker
than one would normally assume.
Depending on the nature of the
case, the Mac-a-mug images may
be given to the police officers in
the department for use in identi
fying possible suspects. To date,

the police department has been
able to apprehend one individual
using a Mac-a-mug sketch.
Before purchasing the Mac-a
mug system two years ago, Stan
ford police had to use a police
sketch artist in the San Jose
Police Department when they
needed a sketch of a possible
suspect.
However, because such artists
are very expensive, they would
only be used in very serious cases,
such as rapes and felonies,
Viveiros said. Artists would not
have been used in smaller cases,
such as the indecent exposures
that have occured on campus in
recent weeks.
Viveiros is currently the only
Stanford police officer trained to
use the Mac-a-mug program.
However, Viveiros said his partner
and one or two other people in
the department may be trained in
the future.
