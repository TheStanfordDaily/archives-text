AIDS treatment to be explored
"Perspectives on AIDS Treatment," a day
long seminar presented by the program in
molecular and genetic medicine of the Stan
ford University School of Medicine, will be
held tomorrow in Fairchild Auditorium.
The seminar, which is open to the public,
will be divided into two segments: a "From
the Laboratory" session in the morning dis
cussing scientific advances, and a "From the
Community" session in the afternoon
analyzing AIDS from social and regulatory
viewpoints.
University President Donald Kennedy will
deliver opening remarks at 10 a.m. He will
be followed by Dr. David Baltimore, director
of the Whitehead Institute at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; Dr. Leonard Her
zenberg, professor of genetics at Stanford;
and Dr. Andrew Moss of the Department of
Epidemiology at San Francisco General
Hospital.
Baltimore will speak on "Control of HIV
Expression," Herzenberg on "Glutathione
in the Regulation of HIV Expression" and
Moss on "Predictors of AIDS in HIV Infec
tion and Therapy."
The afternoon session, beginning at 2
p.m., will start with Laurie Garrett, medical
writer for Newsday, discussing "Battling
Complacency in the Immune System and
the Halls of Government." She will be fol
lowed by Martin Delaney, director of Project
Inform in San Francisco, talking on "Making
Regulatory and Research Programs Work."
The program will end with analyses of
AIDS from four perspectives. Dr. David Kat
zenstein of the Stanford Division of Infec
tious Diseases will discuss "AIDS as a World
wide Problem"; Paul Ross, corporate man
ager of the AIDS program for Digital Equip
ment Corporation, will speak on "AIDS as
a Corporate Problem"; and Dr. Dennis

McShane of the Stanford Division of Im
munology will discuss "AIDS as a Local
Problem."
Digital Equipment Corporation is spon
soring the event and will have demonstra
tions of biological science-related software
and hardware in the Fairchild lobby during
the day. Dr. Lee Herzenberg of Stanford and
Linda Couch of Digital organized the pro
gram.
H-P donates computers
The Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto has
made a gift of $310,435 in equipment to
Stanford to be used in the Computer Science
Department. This is the second equipment
award made by the company as part of a
larger commitment to Stanford's Centennial
Campaign. Altogether, the Hewlett-Packard
pledge consists of $1.5 million in cash and
$1.2 million in equipment to be given over
a five-year period.
This second gift consists of 14 work sta
tions and peripherals that will make it pos
sible for all first-year doctoral students in
the Computer Science Department to have
access to computers for classes and inde
pendent research. Students will be able to
use the work stations until they join and
begin using the computing resources of re
search groups.
The Hewlett-Packard Centennial Cam
paign gift is for the Near West campus, a
project to revitalize Stanford's science and
engineering facilities so that they will be
competitive well into the 21st century.
Hewlett-Packard has had close associa
tions with Stanford for many years and has
been a generous supporter of the University
Among all schools, Stanford ranks first in
the number of students placed with the com
pany and in research connections with the
company.

Hoover fellow: few black
profs not result of racisim
Contrary to of institutionalized
racism in university hiring procedures, the
principal reason there aren t more black fac
ulty members in higher education is that
in the last 10 years "there has been a sub
stantial decline in the number of blacks
earning doctoral degrees," according to a
recent article by Hoover Institution Senior
Fellow John Bunzel.
"Of the 31,770 Ph.D.'s earned in 1986,
the percentage of American blacks receiving
doctorates was 3.6 percent, which was 25.6
percent fewer than in 1977," says Bunzel,
the former president of San Jose State Uni
versity and a former member of the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights.
Bunzel says that while universities were
the employers of new Ph.D.'s 15 years
ago, this is not the case today. Two of the
most important reasons "given by black
Ph.D.'s themselves for taking jobs in other
fields, especially in government and indus
try," Bunzel says, "are that they offer more
attractive career possibilities and better
salaries."
He says that it is impossible to increase
the number of blacks on university faculties
without considering the significant dis
parities in academic achievement between
black and white students at each level of
our educational system.
"In 1986, more than one-third of blacks
18 to 19 years old did not complete secondary
school, but three-quarters of the white stu
dents did." Furthermore, he says, "Black
high school graduates attain literacy levels
only slightly above those of white eighth
graders."
The place to start reversing these
"distressing figures," Bunzel maintains, is
in kindergarten and elementary school.
