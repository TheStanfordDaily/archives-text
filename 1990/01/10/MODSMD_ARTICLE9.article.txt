## South African strikers clash 
### 
JOHANNNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) — Six men were killed
and at least 31 were injured yes
terday when hundreds of striking
and non-striking rail workers
battled with clubs, machetes, and
other weapons at a train station
near Johannesburg, police said.
Union spokesmen said they re
ceived reports of more than 20
people killed and more than 60
injured. The reports could not be
confirmed.
Bodies still lay in blood-soaked
train cars two hours after the
clash. Rocks, sticks and
homemade weapons were strewn
around the cars and the platform.
It was by far the worst incident
of violence during the 10-week
strike by black workers against
the white-led government's trans
port company. About 10 people
have been killed in prevlOUS
strike-related incidents and
several dozen railway cars have

been destroyed in arson attacks.
The union accused non-strikers
of an unprovoked attack on
strikers with clubs, knives, ma
chetes and rocks.
A police spokesman, Col. Frans
Malherbe, said the battle involved
about 1,000 black men still work
ing for South African Transport
Services who confronted about
800 strikers in Germiston, an in
dustrial town southeast of Johan
nesburg. The strikers had arrived
at the station by train on their
way to a union meeting.
Malherbe said police officers
dispersed the combatants with
tear gas after the battle raged 45
minutes. The Congress of South
African Trade Unions, a militant
labor federation,, to which the
are affiliated* paid* police,
.iliuuki huvr intorvMned
But Malherbe said uniformed
officers standing by during the

early stages of the battle probably
were railway security guards, not
police.
About 25,000 workers went on
strike against South African
Transport Services in early No
vember, demanding their mini
mum monthly wage be increased
from $225 to $560. The strikers
also are demanding formal
recognition of their union, the
South African Railway and Har
bor Workers Union, which has
been excluded from contract talks.
Negotiations opened last week
for the first time since the start
of the strike.
More than 22,000 strikers have
been fired and the union is de
manding their unconditional
reinstatement. The company has
said it would re- half the fired
' Workers and allow an arbitrator
to determine if any others had
been fired unfairly. It has not of
fered a wage increase.


Police remove the bodies of three of six men killed in fighting that erupted between striking and
non-striking railroad workers in Germiston, South Africa. At least 16 people have died throughout
South Africa as a result of the strike related clashes.
