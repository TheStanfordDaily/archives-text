# Court narrows civil rights laws

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A sharply divided Su
preme Court yesterday overturned contempt fines
imposed against four Yonkers, N.Y., city councilmen
who defied a federal judge's order to adopt a housing
desegregation plan.
By a 5-4 vote, the court said the judge who
imposed the fines exceeded his authority.
Dissenting justices said yesterday's ruling, which
follows a series of decisions last year that generally
narrowed the scope of civil rights laws, could ham
string judges in dealing with officials who defy
anti-discrimination court orders.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for
the court, said U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand
acted too hastily in holding the councilmen in con
tempt.
The judge should have waited to see whether a
contempt order against the city that threatened to
bankrupt it succeeded in forcing compliance with
Sand's desegregation order, Rehnquist said.
Only if that failed, the chief justice said, should
contempt sanctions against the individual council
members even have been considered.
"The imposition of sanctions on individual legis
lators is designed to cause them to vote, not with
a view to the interest of their constituents or of

the city, but with a view solely to their own personal
interests," Rehnquist said. "This sort of individual
sanction effects a much greater perversion of the
normal legislative process than does the imposition
of sanctions on the city."
Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opin
ion, said the ruling may intimidate judges and give
public officials more reason to defy reasonable court
orders.
"I worry that the court's message will have the
unintended effect of emboldening recalcitrant offi
cials continually to test the ultimate reach of the
remedial authority of the federal courts," he said.
The end result could be the delaying of civil rights
progress, Brennan said.
He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White,
Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Antonin Scalia.
Councilman Edward Fagan, one of the four, said,
"It's a great vindication. It proved the things I did
were justified. It adds a whole new impetus to
continue the fight against the housing.''
"I'm looking forward to getting my money back,"
he added. He was fined $3,500.
