# U.S. apologizes to Colombia

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush, attempting to calm a
rift with Colombia, telephoned
President Virgilio Barco yesterday
to disavow reports that the U.S.
Navy was planning an antidrug
blockade off the Colombian coast.
Bush called Barco "to express
regret over the recent misun
derstanding resulting from er
roneous press stories about a pro
posed U.S. counternarcotics oper
ation," White House spokesman
Roman Popadiuk said in a state
ment.
"The president assured Presi
dent Barco that the U.S. never
intended to conduct any activities
within Colombian territorial
waters, that no U.S. actions would
be taken without the full coopera
tion and consent of the Colombian
government, that no 'blockade'
was ever contemplated and that
he had not authorized naval
maneuvers, as incorrectly de
scribed in the press," the state

'The U.S. never in
tended to conduct any
activities within
Colombian territorial
waters.'

ment said.
Although administration offi
cials said Bush had not approved
a final plan of action, sources had
previously said the Pentagon had
plans for what amounted to a "vir
tual sea and air blockade" of
Colombia to help interdict vessels
earring illegal drugs.
Those plans created a firestorm
for Bush over the weekend, when
Colombian press reports said two
Navy ships, the guided-missile
cruiser Virginia and the aircraft
carrier John F. Kennedy, were en
route to waters off Colombia to

begin the blockade.
The administration quickly said
those two ships, which had sailed
from their homeport of Norfolk,
Va., on Thursday, were merely un
dertaking routine manuevers in
the Atlantic.
One source had said, however,
that the Kennedy has been selec
ted to lead the seaborne antidrug
effort off Colombia — if and when
a decision is made to undertake it.
Yesterday, one key administra
tion official said consultations
with the Colombians over use of
U.S. vessels in a stepped-up in
terdiction effort were now on a
"back burner" because of the
"political sensitivities" that arose.
Discussions continue with the
Colombians on related issues, in
cluding the Colombian drug sum
mit to be attended by Bush, Barco
and the presidents of Peru and
Bolivia on Feb. 25, the official
said.
