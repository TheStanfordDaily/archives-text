Peace talks resume
MOSCOW (AP) — Iran has given the go-ahead
to resume stymied peace talks with Iraq and this
time the talks will be held in the Soviet Union
and mediated by the Soviets, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said yesterday.
He said Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
had sent a message to Moscow saying Iran was
willing to resume the talks, which stalled last
April in Geneva.
Iraq agreed earlier to the Soviet proposal for
trilateral talks, so "now it is possible to start
the practical working-out of this question," Ger
asimov told a Moscow briefing.
