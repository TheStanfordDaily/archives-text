SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -
South Korean President Roh Tae
woo said yesterday he is ready to
meet with his North Korean coun
terpart Kim II Sung to discuss
free travel between the two
Koreas.
"Gone are the days when North
Korea was our rival," Roh said at
a New Year's news conference
televised live nationwide.
He made the remarks in re
sponse to a proposal by Kim in
his New Year's address that free
travel be allowed across the heav
ily fortified Korean border on the
condition that South Korea
destroy a concrete wall on its side
of the Demilitarized Zone.
"I welcome the proposal of the

top North Korean leader ... for
free travel and total opening be
tween the South and the North,
even though hard-to-understand
preconditions were attached to it,"
Roh said.
Roh said yesterday he wants to
meet Kim to discuss free travel
and other tension-easing meas
ures on the peninsula, which was
divided into the capitalist South
and the communist North in
1945. The two Koreas fought a
three-year war in the early 19505.
"I reaffirm my conviction that
a South-North summit should be
held as quickly as possibie to that
end," Roh said. "I once again urge
North Korea to positively respond
to this."

Roh's previous calls for a South-
North summit have gone un
heeded.
He said his country hopes to
conclude a travel and communi
cation agreement with the North.
Roh, praising recent sweeping
reform in East Europe, said he
hoped similar changes would hap
pen on the Korean peninsula. He
noted that no mail, telephone calls
or visits are allowed between the
two Koreas.
"If it takes time for the two
parts of Korea to agree to free
travel and full opening, then ex
changes of correspondence and
telephone calls and free home
visits by dispersed relatives should
be implemented," he said.
