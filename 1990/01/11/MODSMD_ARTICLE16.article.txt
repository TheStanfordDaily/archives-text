RACE, ETHNICITY and the
American Experience," a
new course being offered
through the History Department,
represents a triumph of innovative
and progressive education.
For one thing, it will hopefully
serve as a springboard for students
to delve into other courses explor
ing the ethnic experience.
The student interest is there. Ac
cording to the third ASSU straw
poll of last year, about 80 percent
of the student body favors the de
velopment of an ethnic studies pro
gram.
If "Race, Ethnicity and the
American Experience" serves as an
introductory course in ethnic
studies like the introductory
courses in other departments, it
could be a big step toward the re
alization of ethnic studies as a com
plete discipline.
Of course, there still needs to

be a larger group of ethnic studies
courses for students to delve into.
There is also something else in
novative about this course: five un
dergraduates and one graduate
student assisted History Profs. Al
bert Camarillo and George
Fredrickson in developing the
course and will help teach it.
Their involvement will make the
course a uniquely visceral as well
as intellectual experience for stu
dents.
Camarillo chaired the University
Committee on Minority Issues last
year and is the right person to
teach the new course. Of course,
the support of even more commit
ted faculty can only improve the
chances of developing an ethnic
studies program.
In short, "Race, Ethnicity and
the American Experience" is a
needed and welcome addition to
the University course list.
