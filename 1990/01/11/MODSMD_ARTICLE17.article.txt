THE UCMI Staff Subcommit
tee deserves to be com
mended for deciding to
reissue its final report to include
the responses of Native American
staff members.
The original University Commit
tee on Minority Issues staff report,
issued Nov. 15, thoughtlessly
omitted the 36 Native American
staffers' responses as statistically
insignificant.
Native American staffers had a
very high percentage response rate
and rightfully viewed their exclu
sion as a slap in the face, an act
of "statistical genocide."
But the subcommittee did not
turn a deaf ear to the outcries of
the offended Native American com
munity and did its best to make
amends.
The subcommittee declared, "We

realize now that the exclusion in
sulted the American Indian com
munity, and we greatly regret our
insensitivity to such feelings."
Acting in the spirit of multicul
turalism, the subcommittee met
with members of the American In
dian Staff Forum to review changes
to be made in the reissued report.
It is significant that the new
report will contain an additional
recommendation specifically call
ing for increased attention to the
recruitment and retention of Na
tive Americans on the staff.
Hopefully, the University will
follow through on this recommen
dation with direct action towards
that end.
In short, the subcommittee has
taken a positive step toward
rebuilding trust with the Native
American community.
