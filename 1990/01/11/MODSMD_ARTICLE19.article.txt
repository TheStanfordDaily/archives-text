## A 						Panama here at home 
### 
SEEMINGLY, THE hottest news
item for the holiday season was the
U.S. invasion of Panama. Some
24,000 U.S. troops were sent in to remove
Panama's current leader, put in who we
thought won the election and, of course,
rout any possible resistance to our pres
ence.
Something about the whole Panama
ordeal is disturbing, very disturbing.
Most obviously, there's the destruction,
the chaos, the looting that followed as
the Panamanian police were ousted with
out any replacement of law and order.
There's the deaths of hundreds of sol
diers and civilians. There's the far
reaching damage that will only be realized
as Panama starts to put the pieces back
together.
Our sympathy goes out to the people
of Panama who were caught in the cros- 1
sfire, whose economy will no doubt be a
shambles months or years to come.
We feel for the people who are unsure
of the country's stability, and how they
are going to survive.
Our hatred goes out to the evil, despotic
leader Noriega who had the nerve to tell
Panamanians to give their lives for the
country while he slinks into the Papal
Nuncio, begging for immunity.
We easily hate the dictator who
drowned himself in excesses, while his
people struggled for every day existence.
We despise the leader who would treat
his people so poorly.
But is this concept entirely foreign to
us? Do we live in the great castle of
truth, justice and the American way? Are
we immune to the travesties of the unfair
government of Panama?
Are we Americans cleansed of all traces
of the Noriegas and the Ceaucescaus of
the world, the people who put themselves

above the law and above the people?
I doubt it. It doesn't take a genius to
remember Nixon and Watergate, or
Oliver North and Admiral Poindexter and
the Iran-Contra Affair. It also doesn't
take much to remember that Noriega
himself was employed by our own coun
try's CIA.
We're not all that different. Sure, we
don't live in tumbledown huts, and we
don't have presidents that annul entire
elections and live in palaces with gold
faucets.
But it seems that some of our leaders'
attitudes are the same, that ordinary
people are, well, ordinary. They aren't
smart or talented enough. They don't
deserve to know what's really going on.
Instead of giving us the real details of
why America is in Panama, we get
slogans that are supposed to give us a
good feeling. Why else would any well
educated, intelligent group of grown men
call the full-scale invasion of a foreign
nation "Operation Just Cause."
Now, seemingly any person walking
down the street has been authorized to
substitute the complexities of interna
tional relations and international law
with a thumbs up and an, "America kicks
butt!" It brings back visions of a seventh
grade teacher claiming that the one and
only reason for fighting the Civil War
was to free slaves.
A lot of us out here just want the
truth, and not the sound-bite, catch
phrase stuff that we've been fed. Not
only is it unfair, but it's insulting.
Our leaders have put it upon them
selves to chew up reality and give us the
fab-Reader's Digest edition that will make
us happy.
Maybe we've asked for it. Maybe we
are a nation of idiots. Television shows

Maybe we are a nation
of idiots. Television
shows like 'The Morton
Downey Jr. Show' and
professional wrestling
don't become popular
by accident.

like "The Morton Downey Jr. Show" and
professional wrestling didn't become
popular just by accident. Maybe our na
tion of slothlike couch potatoes doesn't
really deserve to know everything.
But then again, look outside, past our
borders and across the world. We demand
that the Soviet Union be fair to its people,
we demand that Panama does it as well.
We gasp in horror at any sort of imperfect
government. Why not here?
Look outside, maybe to Panama, maybe
to Romania, maybe to China. You'll see
the same problems that we have here.
Maybe we can also see the same solutions.
