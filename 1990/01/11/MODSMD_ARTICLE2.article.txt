# Tough drinking rules proposed
## Stadium consumption, dorm funding for alcohol could be banned 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
A four-part University plan for limit
ing campus alcohol consumption is in
the making this quarter. And, if Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons has his
way, students will no longer be drinking
beer at football games or using dorm
funds to buy alcohol.
Lyons, Athletic Director Andy Geiger
and Director of Public Safety Marvin
Herrington have worked together on a
proposal for limiting alcohol use that
they will officially submit to University
President Donald Kennedy either tomor
row or early next week.
Alcohol abuse resurfaced as a Univer
sity issue this November following Big
Game, at which there were 27 alcohol
related arrests.
Lyons said he believes the University
should ban alcohol from Stanford Sta
dium and all other athletic facilities.
Other points in Lyons' proposal in
clude:
• Prohibiting student fees collected by
the University from going toward the
purchase of alcohol;
• Banning advertisements of alcohol
at all athletic events; and
• Prohibiting people with drunk
driving convictions from parking their
vehicles on campus.

Student fees collected
by the University in
clude dorm funds. If the
proposal is accepted, it
would prohibit residen
ces from purchasing al
cohol with the dorm
money.
"A group can still
pass a hat" and fund
alcohol purchases

through individual donations, Lyons
said.
Lyons' proposal calls for changes in
the University's alcohol regulations, but
the alcohol policy would remain the
same, he said.
Stanford's alcohol policy places the
responsibility of drinking on the indi
vidual.
Lyons acknowledged that the proposal
to prohibit drunk driving offenders from
parking their cars on campus may create
hardships, "but it's their problem, not
mine," he said.
"It's the University community we're
trying to protect," Lyons said.
In regard to banning alcohol in the
stadium, Lyons did not put the blame
of alcohol abuse on the student body.
"It's not simply a student matter,"
Lyons said, noting that out of a standard
stadium crowd of 100,000, as many as

82,000 are not Stanford students.
"And it's in the 82,000 others where
a lot of the problems are," he said.
Students have proven collectively that
they can be reponsible, Lyons said, "but
that doesn't help with visiting sections."
In 1987, Stanford limited the amount
of alcohol allowed into the stadium to
one six-pack per person and placed stu
dent monitors in the stands during the
game.
Geiger and other University officials
called the limit and monitor program
successful and rejected the proposal to
ban alcohol from the stadium.
The 1987 changes in policy arose after
a San Jose man, who had been drinking
alcohol in his seat, died during a football
game when he suffered a heart attack
while jogging to his car at halftime to
get more beer.
All universities in the Pac-10, with
the exception of Stanford, have dry
stadiums.
Lyons will invite comments on the
proposed regulations from the ASSU,
resident fellows and "other people who
think they're affected by it — we do
want to hear from them," he said.
After public input, the different pro
posals will appear before appropriate
committees for approval, Lyons said.
