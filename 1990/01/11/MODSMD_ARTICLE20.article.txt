## Students with families lack adequate financial support 
### 
I COMMEND The Daily on the
article, "Families Face Financial
Hardship," (Jan. 9). I only wish
more articles would explore the finan
cial difficulties of child care at Stan
ford in such great detail.
Although I applaud Stanford for
setting up a committee on child care, I
fear that officials may not examine the
complexities of the problem. For exam
ple, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Bouquin appears to diminish the
hardships that student families face.
"Bouquin considers child care a more
serious burden for Stanford employees
than for students. Employees cannot
take advantage of the sources of aid
that students can, he said, like the

fund for families in Escondido Village."
While I agree that employees of
Stanford also face particular hardships
in financing child care, I do not believe
that their difficulties should in any
way diminish the needs of student
families, or vice versa. The University
should not create a situation where
employees and students have to com
pete to receive affordable child care —
sufficient income and benefits should
be received by all.
Moreover, not all students can take
advantage of "source of aid." For
instance the fund for families in Es
condido Village requires families both
to live in Escondido and to have more
than one child. I would also like to

point out that many Stanford students
are also Stanford employees. We fund
our education and pay living expenses
by doing teaching, research and work
study for the University.
Among students, there is much more
complexity to family life than initially
meets the eye. As Owens notes, single
parent families suffer particular
hardship. In families with two parents,
the "spouse" may either stay at home
and care for children or work outside
to supplement the family income.
However, to understand more about
student family incomes, one must
analyze the gendered dimensions of
family, work and student life. For
example, some families like my own do

not consist of a student and spouse,
but of two graduate students and
children. Where do we find "spouses"
either to take care of our children or
to earn income off-campus? Our dual
incomes from Stanford are woefully
inadequate to pay for skyrocketing
rents and high food prices.
University officials should look into
the differing needs of families of stu
dents, employees and faculty and find
appropriate child care solutions for all.
The University should address the
problems by recognizing their full
complexity and without diminishing the
seriousness of any of our needs.
