# Book review allows court psychiatrist to voice untruths
## 
### 
I'm surprised that a university news
paper should give so much space to the
prejudices of a "hang'em and flog'em
psychiatrist" even if he does appear
regularly on "The Oprah Winfrey
Show."
The Daily's review (Monday, Jan. 8)
of Ronald Markman's bode, "Alone
With The Devil" recognizes that he is
"easily stirred into conjecture" and
that he views the world through a
window that is cracked, but the inter
view with Dr. Markman lets him get
away with many wild statements.
As a physician from Britain I will
restrict myself to correcting Markman's
inaccurate statements about my home
country. Firstly, he says that people
"get killed in [football] stands by the
score" after asserting that the United
States is not more violent than any
other society.

It is true that football hooliganism is
an endemic problem in Britain and
that there have been two mqjor dis
asters in Britain (in Glasgow and Shef
field), but these disasters were the
result of inadequate crowd control
rather than violence.
Secondly, people in Britain don't
"have to show papers every time they
go somewhere." Indeed, Britain is one
of the few countries where people are
not required to carry ID.
Thirdly, Markman says that "When
you have people who are antisocial or
psychotic in Europe they do not have
the right to walk the streets."
Psychiatric patients can be held
against their will in Britain but only
on very strict criteria, and simply
being "psychotic or antisocial" is cer
tainly not enough.
We have an increasingly serious
problem of homelessness in Britain,
and many of the people on the streets
are mentally ill. The problem is not to
sweep these people off the streets back
into the grim asylums that are cur
rently being closed but rather to pro-

vide suitable care for them within the
community.
