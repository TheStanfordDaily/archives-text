# Stanford may act as corporation after loss of news director
## 
### 
Stanford lost a big one Jan. 1, but it
wasn't on the playing field.
The loss was the departure of Bob
Beyers, who resigned after 28 years as
the university's top newsperson. As
head of Stanford News & Publications,
Beyers was available to the press at
any hour, and he always had the
answers.
Beyers' talents as a reporter and
writer not only spread the Stanford
story, but also gave Stanford a reputa
tion for running the best university
news service in the country.
Beyers' integrity also gave the uni
versity an unmatched reputation for
full, frank and fair reporting of

campus events. Under Beyers, the un
stated message that came with the
news was that, if Stanford released a
story, it must be true.
Despite his efforts, the scene has
changed over the past few years.
Beyers believes that Stanford is now
trying to act more like a billion dollar
corporation than a great university.
This means some administrators think
that cover-ups will protect the invest
ment better than open communication.
The problems reported in Beyers'
management of the news office could
surely have been solved. In forcing him
from office, Stanford acted like a cor
porate giant dealing with an adminis
trative power struggle.
As a reporter who has covered Stan
ford since 1962, I question whether
anyone can replace Beyers. I wonder
whether his absence will make it possi
ble for the university now to shut off
the free flow of news and instead
"manage" the news like a corpo
ration.
