## Undefeated cagers limp into Pac-10 Dawgfight No. 7 Huskies look to scar Stanford's record in Maples melee 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
"Wounded! We got wounded!" some
one would invariably cry as choppers
descended on the 4077 th M*A*S*H in
the long-running comedy series.
These days, though, one could easily
imagine the words coming from wom
en's basketball Coach Tara VanDerveer.
Her second-ranked squad is relatively
small to begin with at 11 players and,
with all the recent outbreak of illness
and injury among the players, could be
smaller heading into tonight's game
against No. 7 Washington.
The trouble began last Wednesday
when starting point guard Sonja Hen
ning sprained her ankle. At first the
injury appeared to be somewhat serious,
but Henning was able to play in both
games over the weekend.
Reserve forward Chris MacMurdo
wasn't so lucky. She contracted the flu
and missed the Oregon game Sunday.
Martha Richards has also been ill as
has Val Whiting.
Finally, starting center Julie Zeilstra
reinjured her Achilles tendon — a
chronic problem for her — and didn't
practice yesterday.
"We have a smaller lineup," VanDer
veer said referring to the size of the
players, not the total number.
The personnel shortage has created
a problem in practice. There simply ha
ven't been enough bodies to put on the
floor. Assistant coaches have been
pressed into service — and unbelievably,
one of them, Julie Plank, was injured.
Assistant managers have been pressed
into service.
Even VanDerveer herself has taken
to the hardwood. "I was playing," she
said, "That was pretty bad."
VanDerveer noted "it's going to get
worse before it gets better" because the
team will b_ shorthandod through most
of next season as well. Stanford is losing
three of its 11 players to graduation —
Jennifer Azzi, Stacy Parson and Katy

Steding.
So far, though, only two high school
seniors have committed to Stanford for
next year. VanDerveer is still working
on signing a prospective recruit this
spring. "There's one young lady who is
interested," she said.
Even if the prospect commits, the Car
dinal will still only have 11 players on
the roster. One of the major reasons is
that Celeste Lavoie and Tammy
Svoboda decided to transfer in Novem
ber.
By that time recruiting was nearly
complete and VanDerveer was not only
left shorthanded for 1989-90, but for
1990-91 as well. And, while the team
is 11-0 and widely regarded as a cham
pionship contender, she is concerned.
"We have real good, quality players,"
she said. "[But] you need depth . . . you
need 10, 11, 12 people to really play at
this level."
Though Stanford isn't very deep, one
bright spot has emerged. Walk-on guard

Angela Taylor has been so impressive
in practice that VanDerveer granted her
a scholarship.
As with all the scholarships on the
team, Taylor's will be re-evaluated at
the end of the year, but everyone is
happy in the meantime. For Taylor, who
received some scholarship offers but
decided to attend Stanford anyway, the
news was an ideal Christmas gift.
The Cardinal's depth promises to be
tested tonight by the Huskies' pressure
defense. VanDerveer notes that Washin
gon will also have revenge on its mind
having lost three straight to Stanford.
Make no mistake, VanDerveer isn't
overlooking the Huskies. Despite receiv
ing little preseason hype, Washington
has steadily moved up in the rankings.
VanDerveer senses that it's a strong
year in the West with Washington, Stan
ford and UNLV all near the top of the
polls. Though Cardinal might be
outnumbered ton 0 I, ' won't be un
prepared for the challenge.
