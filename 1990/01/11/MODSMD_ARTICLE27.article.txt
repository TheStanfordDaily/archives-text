# Believe it or not, life goes on without Sports Illustrated

### 
Anyone who decides to avoid reality,
responsibility and schoolwork by
wandering around Europe for a few
months has to realize that any such trip
is going to have its ups and downs:
Climbing the Matterhorn is an up.
Getting searched for drugs at three in
the morning on a train headed for Sicily
is a definite down.
Staying in Germany during the last
weekend of Oktoberfest is an up.
Getting seasick on a 24-hour ferry ride
from Ireland to France is as down as it
gets.
Almost everything else associated with
Ireland is an up.
Being 9000 miles away from San Fran
cisco — and its newspapers, fans and
everything associated with the Giants
and A's — during the World Series is
absolutely an up.
And — this is the only one that hurts

— no Sports Illustrated for three months
is a catastrophe of near-Biblical propor
tions.
I walked into a newsstand in England
a few days into my trip. Time was there.
Newsweek was there. USA Today was
there, for Pete's sake, except the news
was several days old. USA Yesterday?
No Sports Illustrated. It was gonna be
a rough trip.
Okay, so that's a bunch of garbage.

Yes, I did look for it and no, it wasn't
there, but a traveller who spends time
in Europe worrying about what his or
her favorite sports team is doing should
be condemned to reading the Bay Area
papers' World Series coverage for all eter
nity.
Besides, the Pirates had been out of
the race since May and back then the
Steelers were playing with their heads
lodged firmly you-know-where, so I really
wasn't concerned about what was going
on. I was so detatched that at the begin
ning of November I asked another Amer
ican if the World Series Part II had
started. She didn't know. Later I found
out it had been over for four days.
That didn't really bother me. Not
knowing how the Stanford volleyball,
water polo and soccer teams were doing,
however, was annoying. I didn't find out

how their seasons ended until four days
ago.
Oh well. Even without news from home,
it's not like the Old World is a sports
wasteland.
Irish fans are more than enough proof
of that.
I had spent an entire day trying to
hitchhike — meaning I walked a lot more
than I really wanted to — on a Sunday
in September, and was waiting for a late
train to take me to Killarney, way in the
southwest pocket of the country. I was
about to collapse, so of course the train
was an hour late. I didn't find out why
until I switched at the next station.
The train was packed. That doesn't
mean every seat was full, it means every
seat was holding more people than it
should have, all the aisles were crowded
and the landings between cars were

jammed as well. Everyone was happy.
Not to mention hammered. It looked like
the ultimate road trip.
I managed to squeeze just inside the
door (my backpack made me real popular I
and off we went. 1 asked a man wearing
a cap that read "Cork: the Rebel County"
what was up.
"Gaelic football final in Dublin," he
said.
"I take it you won."
"Lucky guess."
For those of you who aren't familiar
with the Irish national pastime, here's a
rough description of Gaelic football,
pieced together from newsclips and fans:
Start with 15 large players to a side,
then stir in two parts rugby and one part
soccer. Add a dose of basketball, a dash
of American football, and mix with Guin-
