# Ammann triggers Card tourney hopes
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
It's a long way from Bakersfield to
the big time. But for Kenny Ammann,
the Cardinal's starting shooting guard,
the trip was well worth it.
Ammann, who has played basketball
at Cal State-Bakersfield, Rancho San
tiago junior college and Stanford over
the past four years, will be on the road
again this weekend. The 9-2 Cardinal
opens its first Pacific 10 Conference
road trip against the Washington
Huskies tonight. Tipoff at Hec Ed
mundson Pavilion in Seattle is at 7:30
p.m.
Ammann first made a name for him
self at Edison High School in Hunting
ton Beach, Calif. He played football,
volleyball and basketball there before
narrowing his focus. "My junior year I
decided to eliminate football," he said.
"I thought basketball would be my best
chance of playing in college. I kept play
ing volleyball because basketball and
volleyball complement each other."
As a senior, he shot 54 percent from
the floor and averaged 19 points and
eight assists for a team that reached
the CIF Final Four. His success contin
ued in volleyball where Edison, led by
current Stanford star Dan Hanan,
reached the CIF title match.
That year he was recruited by several
schools, including Montana, then
coached by Mike Montgomery. "Coach
Montgomery recruited me at Montana,"
Ammann said. "He wanted me to sign
in the fall, but I didn't want to sign
early. I thought I would get a better
offer, but I didn't.
"I was recruited by Northern Arizona
and I kind of verbally committed," he
continued. But Ammann found out the
Lumberjacks' coach had five recruits
and only three scholarships. With other
schools backing off because they thought
he had signed, Ammann figured he'd
go to Orange Coast College in Newport
Beach.
Then CS-Bakersfield entered the pic
ture. "The guy at Bakersfield gave me
a scholarship in June," Ammann said.

"I took it. ... If I'd have gone to Orange
Coast I probably would have quit bas
ketball to play volleyball."
Instead he stayed with basketball. "I
started about half the games that year,"
he said. "(After the season) we got a
new coach. The new coach came in and
brought in his own guys — recruits —
and cut my scholarship. I was really
happy there. I was going to stay."
But in lucky break No. 2, he trans
ferred to Rancho Santiago, a junior col
lege in Santa Ana, Calif. "I really liked
the guy, Coach Dana Pagett, so I went
there," Ammann said. "I had a good
year there. I figured I could at least
get back to the league I was playing in
(at Bakersfield). ... I knew I could play
there."
Instead of returning to Division 11,
however, Ammann decided to take up
a second offer from Montgomery, who
left Montana for Stanford as Ammann
was graduating from high school. With
seniors Todd Lichti, Terry Taylor and
Scott Meinert in the backcourt last year,
Ammann and Montgomery decided a
redshirt year would be best.

Ammann was going to use the red
shirt year to prepare for Division I bas
ketball, but missed much of the season
due to a bulging disc in his back. When
he was healthy, however, he spent most
of his practice time playing against the
Ail-American Lichti. "I learned a lot
guarding him," Ammann said. "He's
really good."
This year, not only is Ammann suc
ceeding Lichti as Stanford's starting off
guard, but the back "hasn't really both
ered me all year."
"Things just worked out too well to
be coincidence," he said. "If I could pick
one place to go to school and play bas
ketball, it would be here. I just thank
God I'm here."
Ammann has had a strong faith in
God since his junior year in high school
and credits his success to it. And while
cases have been made that when born
again athletes make God No. 1 in their
life their athletic performances suffer,
Ammann can't see that happening to
him.


Guard Kenny Ammann Is averaging 9.3 points per game.
