TONIGHT — KZSU (90 1 FM), KCBS (740 AM) 7:30 p.m. tipoff at Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
RECORDS — Stanford (9-2. 1-1 in Pac-10 play, 48th with nine votes in the AP poll),
Washington (6-6, 1-3).
SERIES — The Huskies hold a 48 40 series advantage Washington had beaten Stanford
in 10 straight at Hec Edmundson Pavilion until Todd Lichti put back an errant 25-footer
from Andrew Vlahov at the buzzer for a 71-69 Cardinal win last year
HUSKY UPDATE — Eldridge Recasner, the Huskies' 6 2 senior guard, leads the team
with 16 0 points and 4.2 rebounds per game He is shooting 435 from three-point
land and 905 from the free throw line The Huskies are under first-year Coach Lynn
Nance, who guided St Mary's to an NCAA Tournament appearance last year
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford opened league play by splitting with the Oregon schools
at Maples Pavilion last week Oregon State beat Stanford 77-76 in overtime Friday
despite six three pointers from John Patrick Sunday, Kenny Ammann hit an eight footer
at the buzzer to propell Stanford past Oregon ro -56 Adam Keefe played all 40
minutes with a bad head cold, scoring 23 points and grabbing 12 boards Keefe is
averaging 20.6 points on 640 shooting and pulls down 10 4 rebounds a game
KEYS TO VICTORY — When Stanford has fewer turnovers than the opponent, the Cardinal
is 5-0 with an average victory margin of 16 points. Stanford is averaging 23 turnovers
a game over the last three games. Even fuzzies can figure out that if the Cardinal
holds on to the ball, the odds of victory are good If the outside shooters get on a
role, and Recasner doesn't rage completely out of control, Stanford could pick up a
big conference win and a large confidence boost
