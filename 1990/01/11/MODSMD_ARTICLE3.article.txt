# Webb workers may lose housing

Migrant workers at Webb Ranch
might be forced from their homes, de
spite the attempt of the United Stanford
Workers to convince management to let
them stay.
On Tuesday, the USW and Webb
Ranch management met to argue the
fate of ranch workers and their families,
who may lose their housing because of
the risk of financial liabilities to ranch
management.
The ranch, a fruit and vegetable farm
located on Stanford property, provides
housing for about 40 people on a per
manent basis, as well as temporary
housing for additional workers during
the harvest season.
The Webb family, which has leased
the property from Stanford since the
19205, is "responsible for all those
people who come to the ranch" and could
face a lawsuit if someone were injured
there, according to Terrence O'Connor,
the Webb family attorney.
Webb Ranch gained widespread atten
tion last spring after the USW charged
it with mistreatment of workers. Low
pay with high rent and utilities, inade
quate housing and overcrowding are
among the workers' complaints.

Ranch management and
the USW failed to come to
an agreement after a
three-and-a-half-hour
session.

Last spring, the migrant workers
voted overwhelmingly to join the USW,
despite earlier attempts by Webb Ranch
to block the vote.
This November, O'Connor first fac
similed a letter to the USW informing
the union of his proposal to no longer
provide housing for the workers, said
Rodney Barnette, a USW field repre
sentative.
O'Connor cited examples of "fights
and drinking" among the workers as
one of the problems management wants
to avoid. According to O'Connor, man
agement also fears that serious accidents
and a resulting lawsuit might "wipe
out" the Webb family if workers con
tinue to live on the ranch.
O'Connor said he witnessed one po
tentially dangerous incident in which a
worker's child was playing on a tractor.
"It's not a public park," he said.

Barnette, however, said the incident
involved a 23-year-old adult, not a child.
Webb management has offered worker
families up to $2,000 to help them find
housing in the Bay Area.
But this funding would not be enough
for workers and their families to find
affordable housing away from the ranch,
according to Barnette, who is on the
USW negotiating team representing the
migrant workers. Inflated housing costs
in the Bay Area make it impossible for
the workers to find suitable housing,
he said.
Management also offered to give the
workers four mobile homes that cur
rently house several worker families, as
long as they are removed from ranch
property.
But Barnette said that none of the
mobile home parks in the area would
accept these trailers due to their age
and poor condition. "You'd have to pay
the junkyard to come and take them
away," he said.
Barnette called the proposal "gross
negligence on the part of [Webb Ranch
proprietor] Stanley Webb and Stanford
University." The USW maintains that
the University, as owner of the land,
should take part in the negotiations,
