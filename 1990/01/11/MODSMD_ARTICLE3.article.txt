# Webb workers may lose housing
## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
Migrant workers at Webb Ranch
might be forced from their homes, de
spite the attempt of the United Stanford
Workers to convince management to let
them stay.
On Tuesday, the USW and Webb
Ranch management met to argue the
fate of ranch workers and their families,
who may lose their housing because of
the risk of financial liabilities to ranch
management.
The ranch, a fruit and vegetable farm
located on Stanford property, provides
housing for about 40 people on a per
manent basis, as well as temporary
housing for additional workers during
the harvest season.
The Webb family, which has leased
the property from Stanford since the
19205, is "responsible for all those
people who come to the ranch" and could
face a lawsuit if someone were injured
there, according to Terrence O'Connor,
the Webb family attorney.
Webb Ranch gained widespread atten
tion last spring after the USW charged
it with mistreatment of workers. Low
pay with high rent and utilities, inade
quate housing and overcrowding are
among the workers' complaints.

Ranch management and
the USW failed to come to
an agreement after a
three-and-a-half-hour
session.

Last spring, the migrant workers
voted overwhelmingly to join the USW,
despite earlier attempts by Webb Ranch
to block the vote.
This November, O'Connor first fac
similed a letter to the USW informing
the union of his proposal to no longer
provide housing for the workers, said
Rodney Barnette, a USW field repre
sentative.
O'Connor cited examples of "fights
and drinking" among the workers as
one of the problems management wants
to avoid. According to O'Connor, man
agement also fears that serious accidents
and a resulting lawsuit might "wipe
out" the Webb family if workers con
tinue to live on the ranch.
O'Connor said he witnessed one po
tentially dangerous incident in which a
worker's child was playing on a tractor.
"It's not a public park," he said.

Barnette, however, said the incident
involved a 23-year-old adult, not a child.
Webb management has offered worker
families up to $2,000 to help them find
housing in the Bay Area.
But this funding would not be enough
for workers and their families to find
affordable housing away from the ranch,
according to Barnette, who is on the
USW negotiating team representing the
migrant workers. Inflated housing costs
in the Bay Area make it impossible for
the workers to find suitable housing,
he said.
Management also offered to give the
workers four mobile homes that cur
rently house several worker families, as
long as they are removed from ranch
property.
But Barnette said that none of the
mobile home parks in the area would
accept these trailers due to their age
and poor condition. "You'd have to pay
the junkyard to come and take them
away," he said.
Barnette called the proposal "gross
negligence on the part of [Webb Ranch
proprietor] Stanley Webb and Stanford
University." The USW maintains that
the University, as owner of the land,
should take part in the negotiations,
but the University has consis
tently refused because it considers
the business decisions of Webb
Ranch to be outside of its juris
diction.
Other problems O'Connor cited
facing Webb family members in
cluded the time necessary for
them to act as landlords in addi
tion to running their stables,
managing their fruit stand and
supervising the workers.
"It's a constant headache," he
said.
Barnette claimed yesterday that
ranch management actually put
very little time into maintaining
the housing. "They had the time
as long as they could rob and steal
from people," he charged, refer
ring to the period before the mi
grant workers voted to unionize.
"We're not insensitive to the
workers," O'Connor said, but the
rent and utilities charges that the
Webb family receives from the

workers "is not enough to make
the housing worthwhile." He
called the housing a "financial
burden" and said its elimination
was "a necessity for the survival
of Webb Ranch."
Webb Ranch management and
the USW failed to come to an
agreement after a three-and-a
half-hour negotiating session on
Tuesday.
"I can't say that there was any
progress," Barnette said. "There
weren't any signs from
[management] that they would
change their position," he said.
The meeting got off to a rocky
start with an argument in which
O'Connor challenged the right of
a member of the USW negotiating
team to sit in on the negotiations.
After about an hour of discus
sions, management finally backed
down from its demand and re
turned to the table, according to
Barnette.
O'Connor also criticized the
USW yesterday for attacking
Webb Ranch in the media. As a

result, he said he was considering
filing an unfair labor practice
grievance against the USW for
"making the bargaining process
impossible."
"I don't want to negotiate in
the newspapers," O'Connor said.
In an effort to rally community
support, the USW last month
asked the Campus Ministry to
hold a Christmas service for the
workers. In addition to holding
the service and a candlelight vigil,
the ministry launched an effort
to aid the workers materially, pro
viding them with food and cloth
ing.
"We are concerned with giving
caring support" to the workers,
said Rev. Herb Schmidt, the head
of the Lutheran ministry at Stan
ford.
The ministry provided the
workers with Christmas food and
toys for the children of the
workers through the Ecumenical
Hunger Program at the request
of the USW, according to Rev.
Byron Bland, who is heading the
effort for the workers.
There are also plans to try to
provide the workers and their
families with temporary housing
if they are evicted from Webb
Ranch, though the ministry does
not currently have the resources
for this service, Bland said.
"I really hope we don't have to
cross that bridge," Bland said.
