### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
As defending national cham
pions, the men's and women's ten
nis teams shouldn't need much
tuneup work for the 1990 season,
but they will get a preseason peek
under the hood this weekend at
the National Collegiate Tennis
Classic in Palm Springs.
"It's a good tournament," said
women'B Coach Frank Brennan.
"It's very serious tennis."
Sandra Birch, the defending
NCAA singles champion and the
preseason No. 1 player, leads a
five-person squad for the women.
Debbie Graham, Lisa Green and
Meredith McGrath join Birch in
the singles draw with freshman

Mario Carruth teaming up with
Green in doubles.
Birch and Graham make up the
team's other doubles combination.
Teams are allowed only four
singles players and two doubles
teams.
If this tournament comes out
anything like the team's fall tour
naments, things should turn out
fine. Birch beat McGrath to cap
ture the All-American tournament
in the end of October while team
mate Teri Whitlinger later won
both the Rolex regional and the
Milwaukee Classic.
The Cardinal men's team also
had success in the fall and looks
to carry its momentum into the
spring. Freshman Jonathan Stark
was a finalist in the All-American

tournament, while returning All-
American Alex O'Brien won the
Rolex regional and over the winter
break captured the Cotton Bowl
Classic.
Glenn Solomon and Jason Yee
will also be in the singles draw
and will team up in doubles.
Though they have only been play
ing together for two days, O'Brien
and Stark will make the other
doubles squad.
O'Brien is the highest ranked
Stanford player going into the
tournament and feels good about
the trip.
"I'm playing well right now,"
O'Brien said. "It's just a matter
of going out there and staying
mentally tough throughout the
match."
