While USC and Michigan
battled for the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena, the Stanford sailing
team tested out its light-air
skills, placing fifth at the Rose
Bowl regatta in Long Beach last
weekend.
A-division skipper Dave Dowd
and crew Sue Kown teamed up
with B-division skipper Robert
Brown and crew to score a 129-
point fourth-place tie with Cal
ifornia, which was broken in a
tiebreaker by the Bears.

The regatta, sponsored by
UC-Irvine and Cal State-Long
Beach, was won by Irvine with
78 points, followed by Navy with
86 points. Both are top 5 ranked
teams. USC came in third place
with 107 points.
"Considering that seven of the
top-20 teams in the nation were
there, we had a pretty fair
finish," said Coach Blake Mid
dleton. "Had we been sailing up
to our full potential, I think we
could have blown them away."
Winds were light the first day
of racing, with Dowd and Brown
sailing to fifth place overall on

Saturday. Sunday brought the
wind up a few knots, and Dowd
and Brown boasted a first-place
finish each.
Dowd and Kown finished
fourth in their division; Brown
and crew finished sixth.
Almost all of the West coast
teams were represented, and
top-ranked Brown, Navy and
Princeton were among the East
coast representatives.
The Rose Bowl intersectional
is the first regatta of the winter
season for the team. Stanford
will compete in the Hawaii In
vitational this weekend.
