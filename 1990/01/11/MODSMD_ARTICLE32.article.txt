Body work isn't just for cars anymore.
On the contrary, bodywork — the new-fangled term for
massage — has stepped out from the shady parlor and into
the well-lit living room of our increasingly health-conscious
society.
Although the relaxing muscle manipulation has been dubbed
"dating, Stanford style," practicing therapists view it as a way
of helping the body heal itself. Additionally, massage helps
people maintain the relaxed and energetic state they achieved
during their hourlong sessions.
"If you have a nice car, you get it tuned up," reasoned
Natasha Shih, who owns and operates the House of Shiatsu
in Foster City. "I tell people I'm a human mechanic."
As more people turn to massage therapy for their tune-ups,
the number of therapists and varieties of massage available
has increased dramatically. And to the uninitiated, the spec

- - —"• / • -—— —
trum of massage options can be
overwhelming.
"It's like going to a gourmet
smorgasbord," said Helga Brandt,
who offers the Trager method of
body manipulation from her
Menlo Park home. "People have
just got to try" different methods
until they find the one that makes
them feel the best.
Yet this sampling is expensive.
Ranging from $40 to $85 per ses
sion, massage can be an expensive
diet for the otherwise starving stu
dent.
But if you're looking for some
thing a little longer-lasting than a
visit to the dorm masseuse, the
investment might turn out worth
while. Some of the options you
might consider arc these:
• Shiatsu, the ancient Japanese
art of finger pressure. The therapist
applies pressure to a combination
of tsubos, or points of tension that
fall along the body's 14 meridian
lines. According to Shih, universal
energy — chi — flows through
these meridian lines.
• Rolfing, a 20th century form
of body work which, according to
Rolfer Michael Murphy, whose of
fice is in Palo Alto, is focused on
"posture, and how a person moves
and carries himself."
Rolfers slowly manipulate the
fascia, fibers that wrap muscle
tissue. Murphy said the goal of
Rolfing is to make changes in a
person's neuromuscular condition,
ultimately affecting the way that
person moves."
• Swedish massage, uses "very
pure, essential oils" to exorcise ten
sion that builds up in patient's
muscles, according to Sally Podoll,
a therapist at Hazel Horsncll and
Associates in Redwood City.
Hazel Horsnell, the backbone of
her business, said that in addition
to the Swedish massage, various
original styles are offered at her
office. "Once you've been a thera
pist for a while, you develop your
own technique."
• The Trager Method, an ap
proach to movement re education
developed by former boxer Milton
Trager, involves the subtle to dra
matic manipulation of limbs to
create what therapist Helga Brandt

called "the rag doll effect."
In her home studio, Brandt swings, pushes and pulls her
patients' bodies back to health. The Trager Method is "the
art of letting go," Brandt said, "of feeling inside how [tension]
melts away."
"Learning to maintain the state of relaxation is the gift this
work can give a person," Brandt continued in description of
her method. Yet providing continued relaxation for their
patients is a goal that applies well to each therapist.
And the proof of that comes in how each massage makes
you feel. Here's a rundown on the techniques that I experienced
in researching this article:
• Shiatsu therapy feels as if circulation is momentarily cut
off in the region of the body that is being massaged. When
the pressure is released, the restored blood flow feels tingly.
Strong pressure is crucial. According to Shih, "the greater
the pressure, the greater the results."
• Rolfing, which is some call painful, is actually quite pleas
ant. Murphy likened his method of readjusting the muscle

fascia to peeling an orange. Before
they peel oranges, people some
times rotate them slowly to loosen
the "white stuff," which Murphy
said was equivalent to muscle fas
cia. Rolfing is a similar process.
The therapist gently manip
ulates the fascia to loosen any
alignment-destroying muscle
tension. Subsequent stretching
produces remarkably relaxing —
and body-straightening — results.
A 30-minute session produces no
ticable changes in my posture, as
well as lasting relaxation.
• Swedish massage feels like the
dorm special — only better, be
cause a trained therapist is at the
other end of your nervous system.
The use of healing oils, callcd
aromatherapy enhances the sooth
ing quality of this therapy. Because
this technique focuses primarily on
the skin's surface, the skin feels
particularly pampered with
Swedish massage.
• Perhaps the most challenging
technique is the Trager Method.
Relaxation is dependent as much
on the mindset of the patient as
it is the actions of the therapist.
"The patients' thoughts affect their
muscle tension," Brandt said.
Like most things that don't come
easily, however, this method yields
worthwhile rewards. Massage just
might be one challenge you can't
afford to pass up.

As massage gains popularity by leaps and bounds, the variety and
quantity of body workers grows. To the uninitiated, the spectrum of
massage options can be overwhelming. 'It's like going to a gourmet
smorgasbord,' according to Helga Brandt, whose specialty is the Trager
Method of body manipulation.
