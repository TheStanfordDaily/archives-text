# The 						Almighty sees red and gift-wraps natural disaster for the holidays
## 
### 
This was the Christmas vacation where
1 finally determined, once and for all, that
God hates me.
Not that I wish to take a self-centered
view of the whole thing. I mean, 1 realize
that God has better things to do during
the Christmas season than spend his every
waking moment holding grudges against
an insignificant blasphemer like me.
For instance, during December, God
spends his time inspiring in people the
divine need to put plastic nativity scenes
on their front lawns, nativity scenes which
are, unfortunately, constructed on such a
completely different scale than the Santa
Claus on the front lawn that it appears
to passers-by as if the little lord Jesus is
being attacked by Rudolphzilla the 50-Foot
Red-Nosed Reindeer Who Ate Tokyo.
Still, God hates me, and he demonstra
ted that over Christmas by erupting a
volcano in my hometown. Now that's
gotta be some kind of a hint. God is
sitting up there in his LA-Z-DEI'I Y reclin
ing chair chortling "Ha, ha, ha! First 1 hit
Andrew with an earthquake. Now I curse
him with a volcano. Next, I will smite
him with a tidal wave in the bathtub. . . ."
So there I was, stuck in Anchorage,
Alaska, the skies clouded with caustic ash
from Mount Redoubt, my friends all stuck
in the Seattle airport waiting for the air
to clear, and the ONLY form of cntcrtain

mcnt I had was putting up the Christmas
tree and hanging ornaments that we had
accumulated over the years from relatives,
many of which (the ornaments) are so
tacky you could replace them with road
kills and not notice a difference.
Not that it seemed a total loss. I did
have a chance to catch up on all the
television shows 1 had missed during the
school year, especially Late Night with
David Lettcrman. Each night I'd turn it

and thanks for joining us tonight. . .
Eventually, having punished me enough,
God stopped the volcano and my friends
Hocked into Anchorage and we played and
particd for two days until Christmas came
and we were forced to spend time with
— AACK! — our families.
My family, as is our tradition, went out
for the traditional Christmas dinner at a
restaurant called The Lucky Wishbone, a
restaurant whose primary claim to fame
is that they offer a bigger Basket O' Fries
than any other restaurant in Anchorage.
This is a restaurant that makes a truck
stop on Interstate 5 look, by comparison,
like one of those snooty French places
you see in commercials where they arc
always replacing the customers normal

coffee with Sanka Brand Dccaffcinatcd
Coffee, or sometimes pine tar, just to sec
if they can tell the difference. "Mmmm,"
the customers at Le Chez Snootie say on
hidden camera, "this coffee tastes like a
melted hockcy puck."
After dinner we had our annual Ex
change of Gifts, a ritual in which we
purchase cheap, tawdry items, wrap them
with the same care you would give to
cleaning up after your cat, and thrust them
earnestly at one another while gurgling
such festive niceties as "Merry Christ
mas," "Happy Hannukah" and "Here." My
step sister gave me a tie, which would
actually be fashionable to wear were it
not for the fact that (a) we arc no longer
in the Eisenhower administration, and (b)
I am not deceased.
This tic has helped to reinforce one of
those Fundamental Differences Between
Women and Men Namely, men do not
know colors 1 have this tic lying in front
of me as I write, and I can say with a
great deal of ccrtainty that it is a green
tie. I even asked some of my guy friends
what color the tic is and they all said it
was green. But mv girlfriend takes one
look at the tic and says "It's pinc-olivc,
with emerald hints, a drab brown and
deep magenta."
I think men, like dogs, can't sec colors
Except for those worn by their favorite

football team. Men from Minnesota, for
instance, see the world in black and white
and purple; men from Denver see the
world in black and white and orange.
This may have something to do with
why a lot of women don't like to watch
sports. Maybe there's some sort of sensory
overload or something I mean, to men,
the L A. Rams look like they're wearing
blue and gold, but to women they're
wearing azure-indigo-sapphire-aqua
marine and gilded-lemon-flaxen-amber.
The networks should be required to run
some sort of announcement on the bottom
of the screen during football games, some
thin); like: "WARNING: THE SURGEON
GENERAL HAS DETERMINED THAT
WATGHING FOOTBALL CAN CAUSE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S HEAD TO EX
PLODE."
I think this is a serious danger 1 think
men should stop insisting that their
girlfriends watch sports Women, in turn,
should stop giving us ties for Christmas,
though if they do, please note that my
favorite football team is the New York
Jets, whose colors arc white and pine-olive,
with emerald hints, a drab brown and
deep magenta
