You can tell a lot about people by their
shoes.
The handmade Italian loafers that Ballet
Met artistic director John McFall wears aptly
characterize this provocative repertory com
pany, as well as McFall's artistic and busi
ness sense.
It's a little harder to characterize a com
pany by their shoes, especially when that
company is Ballet Met, and their shoes are
satin pointe, jazz, character or none at all.
Even if they can't be characterized by their
footwear, however, their shoes give good
indication of the versatility of their program.
Versatility is the operative word with
McFall, as well. He is the artistic director,
resident choreographer, fund-raiser and full
on company man who has achieved un
precedented artistic and financial growth in
the 3 years he has been with the company.
McFall strives to touch people who con
sider dance irrelevant to their lives with his
concept of pure repertory. Pure repertory
means unique choreographic works com
missioned from the top interesting choreog
raphers such as Lynn Taylor-Corbett, James
Kudella and David Parsons.
The company usually presents 3 to 4

ballets a night, usually an eclectic combi
nation. Yet the works nave in common in
tegrity, dimension and in his words "the
capacity to move an audience."
He is committed to capturing the hearts
and minds of people — but he says he is
unwilling to do box office stunts in order
to fill a house. "Our world has no myth,
no fantasy."
The thought of going to see a ballet may
be uncomfortable or even boring to some
audience members. To overcome this often
uncomfortable atmosphere, Ballet Met once
had a jeans night — and succeeded in at
tracting a whole different crowd of people.
This kind of alternative approach that the
Columbus, Ohio-based company takes has
sent the number of season ticket holders
soaring from 850 to 4,500 in just three
years.
Imagine yourself this Friday night at the
Lively Arts' presentation of Ballet Met.
The curtain goes up on "Beyond Midnight"
or "There, Below," two west coast premieres
or "Great Galloping Gottschalk." Before
your eyes, there will be a body of versatile,
disciplined dancers prepared to take over
your night. You'll hear music you thought
you'd never be listening to at a ballet concert.
