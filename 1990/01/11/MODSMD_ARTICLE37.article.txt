# Leftover holiday flicks are only mildly appealing
## 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
The holiday season is over but
some remnants, like that damn
tinsel that you can't vacuum up,
shall remain for weeks — even
months — to come. So in case
you haven't done so already, you
can still catch the last of the
movies to come out of the '80s
including "War of the Roses," "She-
Devil," "We're No Angels,"
"Family Business" and "Tango and
Cash."
Since the '80s were pretty much
a bad joke anyway, it is no surprise
to find that three of these five
movies are comedies, one is about
two macho studs and the other is
about crime.
The best comedy of the holiday
season was Danny DeVito's "The
War of the Roses." Perhaps due to
his lack of height, DeVito brings
a warped perspective to film
making. But warped or not, it is

a perspective that works very well.
This dark comedy, which teams
DeVito (a divorce lawyer) with
Kurt Douglas and Kathleen Turner
(as the Roses) for the third time,
tackles the ups and downs of a
good old-fashioned American
divorce in a manner that leaves
you both laughing and thankful it
isn't you splitting up — at least
not yet.
Not quite as intense as "The
War of the Roses" is "She-Devil,"
starring Meryl Streep and
Roseanne Barr. Barr can't act —
period. Even with this major hand
icap, Streep's performance carries
this otherwise so-so movie about
relationships and revenge.
Whereas Streep stretches her tal
ents and proves that she can be a
very successful comic actress, the
domestic goddess merely proves
that she should stick to her boring
TV sit-com.


Andrea Hodge and Scott Brown merge together sensually In the Ballet
Met's presentation of "There, Below," a west coast premier
choreographed by James Kudelka.
Coming in last place in the com
edy category however is "We're No
Angels." This film is simply too
unbelievable to be enjoyable.
Robert DeNiro and Sean Penn
create neither realistic convicts nor
priests.
Although comedy — albeit bad
comedy — is part of the appeal of
"Tango and Cash," the real appeal
comes from its two studs, I mean
stars: Sly Stallone and Kurt Russell.
With Stallone and Russell in the
same movie, you probably already
have a good idea of what to expect
— and that's pretty much what

you'll get.
Unfortunately, the movie
focuses a little too much on adoles
cent excitement, like exploding
trucks and lots of automatic
weapon fire.
Another movie that just doesn't
quite make it is "Family Business."
Not even the talents of Sean Con
nery, Dustin Hoffman and Mat
thew Broderick can save this poorly
written screenplay.
The aged criminal Jessie
(Connery) entices grandson Adam
(Broderick) and reformed son Vito
(Hoffman) into one more family
job. However, the three just
doesn't come across as being
remotely related. It's a wonder they
ever agreed to do this movie in the
first place.
