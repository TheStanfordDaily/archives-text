# Leftover holiday flicks are only mildly appealing

The holiday season is over but
some remnants, like that damn
tinsel that you can't vacuum up,
shall remain for weeks — even
months — to come. So in case
you haven't done so already, you
can still catch the last of the
movies to come out of the '80s
including "War of the Roses," "She-
Devil," "We're No Angels,"
"Family Business" and "Tango and
Cash."
Since the '80s were pretty much
a bad joke anyway, it is no surprise
to find that three of these five
movies are comedies, one is about
two macho studs and the other is
about crime.
The best comedy of the holiday
season was Danny DeVito's "The
War of the Roses." Perhaps due to
his lack of height, DeVito brings
a warped perspective to film
making. But warped or not, it is

a perspective that works very well.
This dark comedy, which teams
DeVito (a divorce lawyer) with
Kurt Douglas and Kathleen Turner
(as the Roses) for the third time,
tackles the ups and downs of a
good old-fashioned American
divorce in a manner that leaves
you both laughing and thankful it
isn't you splitting up — at least
not yet.
Not quite as intense as "The
War of the Roses" is "She-Devil,"
starring Meryl Streep and
Roseanne Barr. Barr can't act —
period. Even with this major hand
icap, Streep's performance carries
this otherwise so-so movie about
relationships and revenge.
Whereas Streep stretches her tal
ents and proves that she can be a
very successful comic actress, the
domestic goddess merely proves
that she should stick to her boring
TV sit-com.
