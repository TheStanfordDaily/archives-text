# Talisman promises to provide magical a cappella experience
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
According to Webster's Dictionary, a talisman is
"an object told to have magical or protective powers."
These powers are about to be unleashed at Stanford.
This quarter will mark the birth of Talisman, a
sixteen-member, coed singing group. Talisman aims
to "redefine the a cappella experience" through a
diverse repertoire of spiritual, folk, reggae and con
temporary music.
Talisman was conceived by Joe Pigato, a sophomore
from Santa Barbara. A first tenor, Pigato's singing
background includes rock, reggae and choral music.
He is fully aware that Talisman will venture into a
musical arena that is drastically different from other
a cappella groups.
"Talisman did not specifically seek to be different
from other groups," Pigato said. "There simply is a
lot of music that the group will incorporate which
other groups do not happen to perform. Talisman
will define itself by its music."
"Spirituals and reggae will be a major part of this
music," Pigato said. "I can't believe that the richness
of these types of music have been generally ignored."
"Talisman was created to seek artistic expression
through song," he continued. "It will provide a forum
for people to channel their creative talents and
energies."
The concept of Talisman originated early last quar
ter, when Pigato and accompanist Oliver Lin began
to pursue the idea of a group resembling both "a
versatile choir and a contemporary singing group."
Soon, after assembling the musical repertoire, arrang
ing the songs, publicizing the group and receiving
input from other musicians, the framework for Talis
man was created.
"Though the foundation has been established, it
will be up to the group to determine Talisman's final
repertoire," Pigato said. "Talisman will utilize the
full musical talents of its members, thus allowing a
great degree of artistic freedom and potential for
input."
Talisman will entertain while remaining faithful
to high musical standards.
"Audiences will be excited by exposure to music
that they may not have listened to as much before,"
he said. "We're going to do a lot of new things with
song and performance, as we open some musically
slumbering eyes. Talisman is more than a simple
pop group."

Auditions for Talisman will take place January 15
and 16 in Braun Music Center, Room 105, between
7 p.m. and 10 p.m. Be forewarned, Stanford. The
powers of Talisman are about to be unleashed.
