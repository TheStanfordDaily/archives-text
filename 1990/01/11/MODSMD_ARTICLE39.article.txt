# Tempest steams in Theatre Works' 'Tea'
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
"Tea," by Velina Hasu Houston, is a
poetic and straightforward play about five
Japanese women who marry American
servicemen after World War II and settle
in — of all places — Junction City,
Kansas.
Their husbands, because they married
"Japs," have been exiled to this bleak
and unwelcoming "hick" town. Surpris
ingly, however, the references to the
women's discontent and disillusion with
American civilization are few. For the
most part, the story explores the pain
and humiliation the women experience
when they leave Japan, the relationships
they develop with their husbands and
"hybrid" daughters, and their common
bond as women "trapped between cul
tures."
Playwright Houston was herself the
daughter of a Japanese "war bride" who
married an American soldier who was
half American Indian and half black.
While two of her earlier plays, "Asa Ga
Kimashita" and "American Dreams" are
based on her own family's experience
after the war, "Tea" led her to interview
50 Japanese women living in Kansas who
discussed aspects of their lives that they'd
never revealed before.
The Theatre Works production, di

rected by Yuriko Doi, feels authentic
from start to finish. The energy that's
given off creates a profound sense of the
dilemma the women were in — trying
to incorporate their Japanese heritage and
philosophy with their new lifestyle.
While trying to accomplish simple inter
actions at banks, car washes and super
markets, they're viewed with hostility
and are given little understanding.
Throughout the play, the taking of tea
is not just a ritual that brings the women
together. It's used consistently as a met
aphor for the turmoil the women feel.
"Tea is not quiet, but turbulent," they
say during the prelude. "We Japanese
women drink a lot of it, become it, swal
low the tempest. And nobody knows the
storm inside."
More important than the play's so
cial/political message are the characters
themselves — each is a striking contrast
to the other, and each has a very special
story to tell.
Chizuye, married to a Mexican, is a
realist and the most Americanized of the
group. Teruko is married to a Texan,
and more than any of the others has to
suppress her former traditions.
Atsuko, refined, dignified and married
to a Japanese-American, is still shunned
by her family. And her "privileged" status
has her constantly feeling that she has
to defend herself to the other women.

The ghost of Himiko Hamilton (Diana
Tanaka) interacts with the women when
they come to her home to take tea and
help put her spirit to rest.
Tanaka creates a momentum at the
beginning and builds it to just the right
tone at her final scene. But, in sections,
her voice strains and goes into a high
pitch, and her body contortions seem
superficial. Yet her overall performance
is strong.
Chizuye (Mari Kobara) is the only one
of the women who wears pants and
smokes cigarettes, but her becoming
Americanized seems too easy. Kobara
seems to forget her character's Japanese
roots altogether.
The other women — Linda Nakamura
as Setsuko, Janis Chow as Teruko and
Christina Kokubo as Atsuko — never let
us take our eyes off of them. They reveal
each new aspect of their characters with
warmth and fluidity.
"Tea" is a rich and beautifully crafted
production.
