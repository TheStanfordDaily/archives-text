# Court ruling may hamper tenure process
## Some fear honesty of peer reviews will be compromised; Justice Blackmun disagrees

A unanimous Supreme Court ruling that
universities accused of discrimination in ten
ure decisions must release personnel files to
federal investigators has created some fear
that the tenure decision-making process could
be hampered.
The ruling, handed down Tuesday, might
affect the accuracy of peer review, central to
tenure decisions, because professors may not
be as honest in evaluating their colleagues if
their evaluations could be made public, oppo
nents of the ruling have said.
However, Justice Harry Blackmun, author
of the court's decision, disagreed. He admitted
there could be costs of making such informa
tion available to the government, but said the
benefits of "ferreting out insidious (racial and
sexual) discrimination" would outweigh them.
The effect of the ruling on Stanford
"remains to be set..," said V .iveri. ty
Counsel John Schwartz.
"The Supreme Court left it to district courts
handling cases to determine the extent to
which universities can preserve some means
of confidentiality," he said.
It may be possible for universities to omit
the names of evaluators before submitting
files to the government, he explained.
"My hope is that district courts, in ap
propriating the principles set out in the Su
preme Court decision, will continue to
preserve some confidentiality with respect to
professors giving evaluations," Schwartz said.
If the University can maintain some degree
of confidentiality, Schwartz said, he believes

If the University can maintain
some degree of confiden
tiality, Schwartz said, there
will be little effect on the ac
curacy of peer review.

there will be little effect on the accuracy of
peer review.
The case began in 1985 when Rosalie Tung,
an Asian-American, filed a complaint against
the University of Pennsylvania with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. Tung
claimed that Pennsylvania was discriminatory
in its refusal to grant her tenure at the Whar
ton School of Business.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
oxtondod to Huontional ir^ti* : utinns in I°"°
prohibits discrimination in employment on the
basis of race, sex, national origin or religion.
Tung alleged that she was as qualified as
five male colleagues who had been granted
tenure.
The commission began an investigation of
the charge, but was denied access by the uni
versity to the confidential evaluations of Tung
and her colleagues. After the commission
issued a subpoena, Pennsylvania was ordered
by the Federal District Court and the U.S.
3rd Cirduit Court of Appeals to release the
relevant files. The university appealed to the
Supreme Court.
The university did not argue that it should

never have to release the information, but
rather that the government must first show
a special need for the files in court, in order
to protect academic freedom.
Tuesday's decision, however, ruled that the
commission only needs to meet the same legal
burden in proving that information is as rel
evant to discrimination charges as that facing
other groups.
According to Blackmun's written opinion,
"Often, disclosure of peer review materials
will be necessary in order for the commission
to determine whether illegal discrmination has
taken place. Indeed, if there is a 'smoking
gun' to be found that demonstrates discrim
ination in tenure decisions, it is likely to be
tucked away in peer review files."
Blackmun also wrote that giving univer
sities special confidentiality privileges could
"lead to a wave of similar privilege claims by
other employers who play significant roles in
furthering speech and learning in society.
"Wat of w Miohers, musicians,
lawyers? It is surely not unreasonable to be
lieve, for example, that confidential peer
reviews play an important part in partnership
determinations at some law firms. We see no
limiting principle in in petitioner's argument,"
he wrote.
Stanford was one of many parties, including
Harvard, Princeton and Yale Universities, to
file a friend-of-the-court brief with the Su
preme Court.
According to Schwartz, a friend-of-the
court, or amicus, brief is a common means
for outside parties to submit their views in
a case. Stanford was supportive of Pennsyl
vania's position, Schwartz said.
