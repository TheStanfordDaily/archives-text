# Red, white and blues
## Cruise triumphs in tragedy 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
If you ever grew up playing war in the
woods with your friends, if you ever
thought of yourself as deeply patriotic,
then the story of Ron Kovic won't be just
two and a half hours of film, but a
frightening look at a possible reality.
As portrayed in the stunning film "Born
On The Fourth Of July," the nightmare
that became Kovic's life is a worst case
scenario for anyone who grew up believ
ing in America enough to fight and die
for it.
Directed by Oliver Stone, the film opens
with an Independence Day parade that
foreshadows the dark result of Kovic's
patriotism.
Moving forward several years, the film
presents Kovic as an all- American teen
ager. Rounding out his red, white and
blue persona, Kovic joins the Marines so
he can give something back to his coun
try.
Kovic's American dream turns into an
inescapable nightmare during his second
tour in Vietnam. First, he accidentally
shoots one of his fellow Marines in the
heat of battle. To Kovic's great despair,

no one cares to hear his confession. Then,
Kovic is severely wounded, leaving him
paralyzed below the middle of his chest.
One of the most moving scenes of the
film occurs when Kovic returns home
from the hospital. As his family gathers
around him and his wheelchair to greet
him, a powerful awkwardness pervades
the scene.
After an emotional blowout between
Kovic and his family, he goes to Villa
Dulce in Mexico for a period of self
destruction. Later Kovic realizes he must
confess to the family of the soldier he
accidentally killed and journeys to Geor
gia to do so.
The real power of "Born On The Fourth
Of July" is the incredible acting of Tom
Cruise. He presents a believable evolution
of his character without seeming smug
or self-righteous. In every scene, Cruise
gives his all in what must be the best
performance of the year.
"Born On The Fourth Of July" is not
the type of film I could sit through again.
It is very disturbing, thought-provoking
and one of the least entertaining films
of the year. Yet, it is also one of the very
best.
