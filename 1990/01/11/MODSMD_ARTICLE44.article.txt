# Indigo Girls paint town glorious blue
## 
### John Brockenbrough 
After spending 14 hours slaving
over a take-home final, I searched
through my desk draw, found my
Indigo Girls ticket and was free.
For a few hours at least.
Their performance came "Closer
to Fine" than any live performance
I have heard. I can't remember the
last time I saw a pair perform so
well together.
Their Dec. 9 show — a folk
"jam session" — was so personable
and humble that I felt like I knew
them by the end of the concert.
In an age of slick pop perform
ances, canned lyrics and electric
everything, their simple, yet pow
erful style of music was refreshing.
Any fan of their albums is guar
anteed to like them better in per
son. Their on-stage personalities
pierced the crowd in a way that a
recording never could.
They seemed to have a mission
in their performance — to share
their philosophy of religion, love
and dieting with the audience. In
reaching out to the audience, they
made Mem Aud seem more like
the Coffee House where they sang
last year.
Once they even asked that the
lights be turned on so they could
have a look at us. And, on one
song, they asked the audience to
fill in on background vocals.
I enjoyed all of their songs, but
the encore was the concert's high
light. Instead of tossing off another
song from one of their albums,
they jammed with their guitar
technician, Kenny.
They looked like they were
having so much fun on stage that
those of us in the audience could
not help but have fun ourselves.

Indigo Girl Emily Saliers pounds out more smooth, vocal magic to the delight of
students who put their studies on hold for the concert.
