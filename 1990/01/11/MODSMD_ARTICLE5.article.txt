# Rain shortage hasn't affected Stanford yet
## 
### Elizabeth Weiss 
Even though rainfall for the
Bay Area has come up 40 to
50 percent short of its average
over the last six months, Uni
versity and local water officials
aren't panicking — yet.
The Stanford area needs 15
more inches of rain by June
30 to reach average annual
levels, according to National
Weather Service meteorologist
Randy Hartley. Still, Hartley
remained optimistic.
"We still have several months
to fall back into the storm track
and recoup what we don't have
so far," he said.
The Wfltnr "r>~f
critical" at tne moment, agreeu
Santa Clara Valley Water Dis
trict spokeswoman Teddy
Morse. Ordinarily, Morse said,
the water company "imports"
water to meet the Santa Clara
Valley's needs.
Effective conservation ef
forts last spring and summer
kept water officials from dip
ping into last year's surplus
water, which could then be
stored in underwater basins.
"We are in better shape this

year because water levels have
increased, while last year at
this time they were decreas
ing," said Morse.
In addition, Morse empha
sized that adequate rain be
tween now and the end of the
rainy season in March could
entirely eliminate the possibil
ity of drought like last spring's.
"The 10 local reservoirs can
fill with three or four good
rainfalls," she said.
The needed rain may come
this way as early as this week
end, predicted Hartley, explain
ing that a rainstorm might hit
the Bay Area tomorrow or Sat
urday with showers continuing
or. Sunday. He speculated
the area could easily get t.»e
rain it needs during this "par
ticularly unusual year."
If the Bay Area and Stanford
do not receive adequate rain
fall, local water companies will
aim to decrease water con
sumption by 25 percent. In the
past, customer compliance with
rationing requirements has
been excellent, partly because
of the fines imposed upon those
guilty of excess consumption, said
Morse.
At Stanford, "Everyone should
think 'conservation,' " said
Cheryl Jensen, manager of me
chanical utilities for operations
and maintenance. Jensen said that
campus water conservation ef
forts are "holding pretty steady."
Current conservation measures

at Stanford include retro-fitting
buildings with low-flow units and
using drought-resistant plants in
new landscaping.
If the campus does not receive
enough rainfall, Jensen said Stan
ford would obviously need to cut
back on its water expenditure. She
said the conservation plan would
target water use in landscaping,
since that is one of the areas "that
can actually be cut without har
ming people."
Lake Lagunita could be another

drought casualty. It is initially
filled by rainwater, and the water
level is maintained by mountain
creekwater, not drinking water or
ground water, according to Jen
sen.
Jensen said that conservation
efforts two years ago were very
effective. Should drought condi
tions prevail this spring and sum
mer, Jensen said Stanford "would
manage, if every person takes re
sponsibility for his or her water
consumption and cuts back a
little."
