Even though rainfall for the
Bay Area has come up 40 to
50 percent short of its average
over the last six months, Uni
versity and local water officials
aren't panicking — yet.
The Stanford area needs 15
more inches of rain by June
30 to reach average annual
levels, according to National
Weather Service meteorologist
Randy Hartley. Still, Hartley
remained optimistic.
"We still have several months
to fall back into the storm track
and recoup what we don't have
so far," he said.

Morse. Ordinarily, Morse said,

water to meet the Santa Clara

Effective conservation ef

kept water officials from dip

water, which could then be
stored in underwater basins.
"We are in better shape this

year because water levels have
increased, while last year at
this time they were decreas

In addition, Morse empha
sized that adequate rain be

rainy season in March could
entirely eliminate the possibil
ity of drought like last spring's.
"The 10 local reservoirs can
fill with three or four good
rainfalls," she said.
The needed rain may come
this way as early as this week
end, predicted Hartley, explain
ing that a rainstorm might hit
the Bay Area tomorrow or Sat
urday with showers continuing
or. Sunday. He speculated
the area could easily get t.»e
rain it needs during this "par
ticularly unusual year."
If the Bay Area and Stanford
do not receive adequate rain
fall, local water companies will
aim to decrease water con
sumption by 25 percent. In the
past, customer compliance with
rationing requirements has
been excellent, partly because
of the fines imposed upon those
