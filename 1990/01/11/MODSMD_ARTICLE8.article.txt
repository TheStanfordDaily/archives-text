# Injured to receive free rides soon
## Disability center will taxi students from dorms to classes 
### Bernadine Chee 
For daredevil student skiers
who might sprain an ankle over
the three-day weekend, a campus
service will be there to help them
maneuver around campus once
they return from the slopes.
Starting next week, the Dis
ability Resource Center will pro
vide "door-to-door" transpor
tation to classes and other campus
activities for students with limited
mobility.
Students can simply pick up the
phone and call Stanford's
Peratransit Cart Service to
receive free rides in the four
seater electric carts that zoom
around campus.
Ordinarily, renting one of these
carts for a month costs about
$150.
The free cart service started up
last spring as a pilot program.
Despite the success of last spring's
program — the service averaged
25 rides a day in May — the free
cart service was not in operation
this fall because the Committee
on Parking and Transportation
was evaluating it.
But the committee has now
given the service the thumbs up,
and students with limited mobility

can use the carts for the
remainder of the school year, said
Jim Bouquin, director of the Dis
ability Resource Center.
Bouquin, however, said that the
University's funding of the cart
service is limited to one year only.
After this year, funding for the
service must come from the stu
dent body, he said.
"It is our understanding that
to continue beyond this academic
year, funding will have to be found
from other sources (than the Uni
versity). We hope and expect that
the ASSU and the student body
will see this as a valuable enough
service that they will generate
funds, perhaps through a fee as
sessment or other means."
Bouquin worked with senior
Charles Day to set up the free
service.
Two years ago, Day suffered a
sprained ankle and realized the
need for free transportation.
"I tried to get around on
crutches, but it was difficult to
get to classes," he said.
Day tried to rent a golf cart
despite the expense, but the
supply company had rented them
all out.
Day then decided to ride the
Disability Resource Center van,

which also provides free transpor
tation, but knew that the smaller
electric carts would better serve
his needs. The van had stairs that
made it difficult for a person on
crutches to get on and off, he said.
Faced with these difficulties,
Day felt motivated to develop a
program that would help fellow
students in similar straits.
Day and Bouquin said they
found a significant demand for
such a service.
"Although the van is essential
for many people who use wheel
chairs, our experience has shown
that the cart service can be very
helpful for students who have lim
ited mobility or who can easily
transfer out of a manual wheel
chair," said Bouquin.
The cart service begins next
Tuesday and will be available
weekdays between 7:30 a.m. and
6:30 p.m. Students who wish to
take advantage of the service
should call 725-2484 anytime to
leave a message to arrange rides,
Day said, adding that they must
call before 5 p.m. the day before
they need a lift.
Students who are interested in
serving as cart drivers may con
tact the Disability Resource Cen
ter at 723-1066.
