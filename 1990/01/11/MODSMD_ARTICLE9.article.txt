## Lithuanians demand secession 
### 
VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) -
Thousands of Lithuanians defied
the Kremlin and cried "Freedom!"
at a pro-independence rally yes
terday, the eve of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's high
stakes visit.
Banners held by some of the
20,000 people who massed on Ca
thedral Square ranged from one
polite welcome to blunt calls for
Gorbachev to go home — and take
the Red Army with him.
"We didn't join the Soviet Un
'on, you grabbed us!" read u,»c
banner, referring to the Soviet
Union's absorption of the Baltic
republic in 1940.
Gorbachev is scheduled to ar
rive today and meet for three days

with factory workers, collective
farmers, members of ethnic mi
norities and Communist Party ac
tivists to press for reversal of the
Lithuanian Communist Party's
decision last month to split from
the national party and support
independence for the Baltic repub
lic.
As never before in his nearly
five years in power, the Kremlin
chief will put his personal prestige
on the line to cool one of his coun
try's hottest ethnic crises.
Although he has granted Lit
huanians and their neighbors in
Estonia and Latvia a large mea
sure of economic and political
power, he has consistently and
sharply criticized Lithuanian

Communist leaders for pressing
for complete independence, and
convened an emergency session of
the national party Central Com
mittee last month to discuss the
issue.
The stakes for the visit are
high. If Gorbachev fails to bring
the Lithuanians back to the fold,
Communist parties in the 14
other republics could feel encour
aged to break with Moscow.
Vytautas Landsbergis, the
leader of Sajudis, Lithuania's
popular political movement, said
his countrymen are not trying to
hurt Gorbachev's reforms but are
showing other republics "how cer
tain problems can be solved in a
peaceful, diplomatic manner."
