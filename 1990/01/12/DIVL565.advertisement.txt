There are opportunities to work with our teams in Applications, Systems,
Networking, and Multimedia. If you are about to graduate with, or are
working towards, a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Electrical
Engineering, Math, Physics, or related technical degree, then we want to hear
about your microcomputer programming experience, design skills, and/or
exposure to managing projects.
Microsoft will be interviewing on campus for Software Design Engineers
and Program Managers on
January 23, 1990
We will also be at the Engineering Job Faire on January 20, 1990 at the
Tresidder Memorial Union from 9:30 am - 5:00 pm.

"I'm working on the final stages of a product—PC Works—that pushes PCs to their limit to provide
a great environment for beginning and expert computer users; working with some of the best programmers
and brightest minds I have met; and making substantial contributions to a powerful program. Team pluses
are weekly softball games, status meetings over box lunches from Nordstrom and hanging out with a fun
group of people."
Sean Mitchell, BS CS, Stanford '89
Software Design Engineer
"I can honestly say I've looked forward to getting to work at Microsoft every single morning for the last
seven years. Sometimes I cycle to work and sometimes I kayak. I've even swum to work before. But, most days
I drive like everyone else—across Lake Washington, with the Cascade Mountains in front of me, the Olympics
behind and Mt. Rainier and Mt. Baker on either side. A pretty unique commute. Program Management is a
pretty unique job, too. You drive and coordinate all aspects of a product's development from conception through
design to shipping. You work with all members of the development team: the programmers, writers, testers,
product support, marketing and advertising. By knowing your product, the market, and the competition, you
make sure you get the best product out to the market as fast as possible."
Jabe Blumenthal, BS Math, Yale 1982
Director of Program Management
"A summer at Microsoft involves you setting your own hours (e.g. sleeping in), experiencing the energy and
excitement generated from producing a multi-million dollar product, and working on a campus that rivals most
national parks. During respites between playing ultimate frisbee and watching golf balls fly past office windows,
I worked on a team of three in the genesis of an unreleased application. Even as a summer intern my input was
valued equally with that of full-time employees; together we formulated our product from scratch. Microsoft:
they wine, dine, and challenge you; you can't help but want to come back!"
Scott Forstall, BS Symbolic Systems, Stanford '91

"I spent my 4 summer at Microsoft working with the PC Word group, and, at first, I was very intimidated by
that. Word is one of the TOP selling pieces of software in the nation, and here I was, with only four or five CS
classes experience, and a basic knowledge of C. I was worried that I'd be treated with kid gloves, and I was also
concerned that what I did work on wouldn't really be used by anyone. However, I was taken seriously, given a
project, and, before a week was out, I could see the results of my work. It was apparent that I had made a
positive contribution, something which would be valuable to the group, and was a part of the team —not simply
a 'summer hire'. I don't think this is something you will find everywhere."
Chris Jones, BS CS Stanford '91
Software Design Intern
"I worked on a project where I investigated development possibilities on machines other than the Mac and
IBM. This kind of project had never been done before, so Microsoft was giving me a lot of responsibility from
the start. My final report was given attention which I thought would only be reserved for the work of a full-time
employee. But Microsoft treats its interns just like the regulars. No one was watching over my shoulder to check
on my progress; they had confidence in me from the start."
William Kennedy, BS CS Stanford '90
Software Design Intern
"Working at Microsoft as a summer intern has been a great experience for me. There's so much to do in the
Seattle area—whitewater rafting in glacier-fed rivers in the Cascade Mountains, and visiting Mt. Rainier
National Park were two highlights. Also, the area around Microsoft offers many cultural events like Seattle's
annual Sea Fair, which includes everything from milk-carton boat races to world-class power boat races."
