ESSENCE OF MATTER
By Joel Sheinmel
As Albert Einstein once said; "Concepts that have proved useful in
the constitution of an order of things readily win such an influence
over us that we forget their earthly origin and take them to be
changeless data. Such concepts then become stamped as
necessities of thought, as given a priori; so the path of scientific
progress often becomes impassable for a long period." The intent of
this article is to suggest that quantum mechanics, our contemporary
physics of micro phenomena, has become a sacred cow impeding
mankind's opportunity to comprehend the 'Essence of Matter'. This
writer would then suggest an alternate model along the lines
envisioned by Albert Einstein who never accepted the quantum
mechanical view.
Part 1 - Historical Shifts in the Foundations of Physics
For Aristotle there were four forms of matter; earth, water, air, and fire.
Each of these forms was said to have a natural place where it would
exist completely at rest. Earth's natural place was at the center of the
universe, water formed a rim about the earth, air resided above the
water, and fire was the outermost element of matter with its domain
above the air. Aristotle proposed that all bodies or forms of matter
sought their natural place and would move toward it if not
constrained. On reaching their natural place the motion of all bodies
would cease. Yet celestial bodies were observed in continual motion.
To explain these motions Aristotle introduced a special hypothesis
contending the heavens did not obey the same set of laws as did
earthly bodies. Aristotle's principles for viewing phenomena and
making predictions proved successful for 2000 years.
Copernicus, Galileo and Newton took the first steps toward shifting
man away from his entirely terrestrial world view, whereby all motions
had been viewed from the surface of the earth. Newtonian
mechanics replaced the natural state of rest for bodies, which were
henceforth to be seen existing either at rest or in motion in a straight
line unless acted upon by forces. Following Newton, the heavenly
bodies and those of the earth could be said to obey the same set of
laws. Vet harmony between terrestrial and celestial mechanics was
not acquired without some cost. It was necessary for Newton to also
introduce a new hypothesis 'action at a distance' to explain why the
heavenly bodies moved in curved paths. To many at the time,
including Descartes and Leibnitz, 'action at a distance' was seen as
an occult hypothesis. They believed there needed to be a
mechanical cause for attractive forces between bodies in the
universe. For this reason Newton's laws were not accepted fully on
the European continent for nearly 50 years.
Newton's laws proved so successful in application that in time the
mystical nature of 'action at a distance' was forgotten and this
hypothesis took on axiomatic status. When, almost two centuries
later, Maxwell cast the laws of electromagnetic phenomena under the
concept of a field, this new field concept was at first frowned upon by
a scientific community that had now accepted the occult as real. After
Maxwell it would take another half century before Einstein was able
to propose a new field theory (general relativity) to provide a
mechanical explanation for the motions of macro bodies in space.
With the acceptance of general relativity theory, forces were no
longer required to explain the curved motions of the heavenly bodies.
The natural state of bodies became motion along curved paths,
labeled geodesies, in spacetime.
Almost at the same time Einstein's general relativity theory was
removing 'action at a distance' from macro physics, there appeared a
new special hypothesis for explaining atomic phenomena. As
experiments began to make data available on atomic and subatomic
events it was found classical mechanical laws could not be applied.
The resolution of this problem culminated in a new physics (quantum
mechanics) based on a principle of 'uncertainty' in our knowledge.
Quantum mechanics called for an addendum in terrestrial laws so
that the subatomic world, similar to Aristotle's heavens, would be
interpreted as irrational by existing standards. Under quantum
mechanics the path of a particle cannot be known, for it is not
possible, even in principle, to know simultaneously the momentum
and position of a particle, and the more one knows of one measure
the less one can know of the other. The hypothesis of 'uncertainty',
also referred to as 'indeterminacy', has proven so successful in the
years since its introduction that its similarity to Aristotle's special
hypothesis has gone almost unnoticed.
Like Descartes and Leibnitz, who would not accept Newtonian action
at a distance, Einstein, Schrodinger, DeBroglie, and Planck did not
accept 'indeterminacy'. Einstein believed that, as with macro
phenomena, there needed to be a logical explanation for subatomic
phenomena and suggested the answer lay in a f'eld theory based on
the principles of general relativity (curved spaces). Einstein's view
has been written off as the folly of a once great physicist, past his
prime when he suggested it, by quantum mechanical physicists who
would now accept their somewhat mythical hypothesis as real.
Part 2 - A Basis for a Field Theory of Matter
Quantum mechanics is a particle based theory of matter. In a particle
theory, the field emanates from the particle that by itself is something
other that the field. Here the building blocks of matter remain
unchangeable substances. An electron brought to a new energy
level in an atom acts similar to that of a ball being lifted in a
gravitational field. The ball's potential energy in its new position has
changed but it is still the same ball.
Under a field model of matter a particle is a localized field, where the
field represents a particular motion or acceleration taking place in a
region of space. If this motion or acceleration is removed the field
disappears, and a particle, when represented by the field, would
necessarily disappear as well. Our Newtonian mass concept implies
one can remove all motion from an entity and the entity, represented
by its inertial mass, would still remain. But this concept, whereby
motion can be removed from the entity and the entity would remain
intact cannot be applied to particles manifested as fields. The inertia
of a field is dependent on field strength or field acceleration. If the
field acceleration is changed the field inertia would also change.
Einstein used the term space curvature to represent field
acceleration, where increases in space curvature represent increases
in field strength or increases in the acceleration associated with the
field. It follows then, that if a particle were a manifestation of a field,
that the mass of the particle would become dependent on the
degree of spatial curvature it represented.
Prior to quantum mechanics the electron was felt to have an orbital
motion. As the electron changed its orbit, it was presumed its mass
remained essentially constant while its orbital velocity changed. In
this particle model, electron orbital velocity was inversely proportional
to the square root of the electron's average distance from the field
center, a condition similar to macro bodies in gravitational fields. Yet
this description of the electron's behavior on changing field position
was merely an assumption left over from the macro mass concept,
whereby the electron was visualized as a small body moving around
the orbit. Alternatively, we might have described the electron as a
field or curved space, where the origin of curvature was represented
by the same orbit the electron was once thought to occupy. By this
second model, when the orbit changed size the curvature of space at
the origin of the field representing the electron whould also change,
and the electron, manifested as this field, would similarly change.
Namely, it would be expected the inertia (or mass) associated with
this curved space would depend on the origin orbit size. If the mass
of the electron was inversely proportional to the origin orbit size, then
to match known electron energies it would be found the electron's
orbital velocity (the relative spatial velocity associated with the curved
space at the orbit origin) would need to be held constant. The detail
mathematics are not included herein for reasons of space but would
be made available on request.
Under this field model it becomes possible to couple matter and
radiation. Namely, when the electron is represented as curved space
with a constant orbital velocity, it can be shown the differences in
orbital frequencies, between any two energy levels (between two
origins), would relate to the frequency of radiation released between
these same energy levels. This correspondence between orbital
frequencies and electromagnetic rediation frequency is not possible
under a particle model where mass is a constant. It was the inability
to correlate electron revolution frequency with radiation frequency
that caused Heisenberg to disregard electron orbits altogether and to
to hypothesize his quantum mechanical model based on the
uncertainty or indeterminacy of the electron's path. If such a
correlation had been achieved it is doubtful quantum mechanics
would have arisen.
The energy of a loop of curved space can be given in equation form
as:
E = psf where p = loop momentum, s = loop size, and
f = the spatial frequency of orbit existing at the
loop.
Conclusion
We close this article with words from John Stuart Mill.
"Ages are no less infallible than individuals, every age having held
many opinions which subsequent ages have deemed not only false
but absurd; and it is as certain that many opinions now general will
be rejected by future ages, as it is that many, once general, are
rejected by the present"
