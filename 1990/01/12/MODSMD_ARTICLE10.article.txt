# University to accommodate for Federal aid cuts
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Despite impending cuts in
federal funding for scholarships,
Stanford students should not suf
fer reduced financial aid in the
1990-91 school year.
Federal budget cuts for deficit
reduction will result in a cut of
$66.5 million from the Pell Grant
program, the largest federal stu
dent aid program, according to a
Dec. 6 article in The Chronicle of
Higher Education. The article also
stated that based on these cuts,
"more than 165,000 students
could lose grants in 1990-91."

However, Robert Huff, director
of financial aids, said the federal
budget cuts should not have a sig
nificant impact on students at
Stanford.
"Stanford remains committed
to meeting the demonstrated fi
nancial need of students," Huff
said. As a result, Stanford will
have to make up the difference
from other sources.
Huff also noted that Stanford
does not receive a substantial
amount of funding from Pell
Grants. He estimated that 700
students receive Pell funding,
totaling about $900,000.
While the reduction in Pell

Grants will not directly affect stu
dents, it may cause problems for
the administration and Stanford's
budget.
Stanford will have to reallocate
funds from its budget to accom
modate the loss in aid from the
government. To accomplish this,
Huff said he will request more
general funds from the budget of
fice after assessing the extent of
the reduction.
Huff said because the full effect
of the reductions has not yet been
determined, plans for reallocating
money at Stanford have not been
made. He noted that another im
portant factor will be President

Bush's budget for fiscal year 1990,
which has not yet been released.
In general, scholarship money
at Stanford comes from several
different sources, including
federal, state, and private funds.
The largest single source is Stan
ford's general operating fund,
from which approximately $12
million per year is used for finan
cial aid.
In addition, scholarship money
is also available from certain en
dowment funds that have been
donated to Stanford.
Huff noted that this is not the
first time that federal funds for
student aid have been reduced.
