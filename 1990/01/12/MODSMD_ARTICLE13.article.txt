## Gorbachev confronts Lithuanians over independence 
### 
VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) -
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
told independence-seeking Lit
huanians yesterday they would
have a say in their republic's fu
ture that could possibly lead to
secession from the Soviet Union.
But it was not clear how inde
pendent Lithuania would be under
the framework envisioned by Gor
bachev, and he cautioned that a
confrontation with Moscow could
lead to tragedy.
About 300,000 Lithuanians
jammed central Vilnius late yes
terday in a candlelight demonstra
tion for freedom.
"We have been tied together for
these 50 years, whether we like
it or not," Gorbachev told a crowd
earlier in the day after placing a
wreath at a monument to
Vladimir Lenin.
But later, Gorbachev said he
had ordered that a law be written
and published establishing a
mechanism for secession from the
Soviet Union, a right guaranteed
by the country's 1977 constitution
but not recognized to date.
"I am for self-determination all
the way to secession from the So
viet Union," Gorbachev told a
meeting of Lithuanian intellectu

als. Gorbachev appeared to be say
ing that although he vigorously
opposes such a move, he under
stands it could be a possibility.
Lithuanians say they want to
restore the independence they had
between the world wars. Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin absorbed Lit
huania along with the two other
Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia,
in 1940 under a secret agreement
with Nazi Germany.
Although he has granted Lit
huanians and their neighbors in
Latvia and Estonia a large mea
sure of economic and political
power, Gorbachev has consistently
and sharply criticized Lithuanian
Communist Party leaders for
pressing for complete indepen
dence.
He convened an emergency ses
sion of the national party's Central
Committee last month to discuss
the issue.
By going to Vilnius, Lithuania's
capital, Gorbachev put his per
sonal prestige on the line as never
before in his nearly five years in
power, appearing in a republic
that openly disagrees with him
and is unlikely to be moved by
his appeals.
Gorbachev is in Lithuania for

three days of meetings to try to
reverse the Lithuanian party's
break with the national party,
decided in December.
Gorbachev waded into a crowd
of several hundred people in Vil
nius after the visit to the Lenin
monument, and he talked for
nearly an hour.
One man in the crowd called
out: "People must decide their
own fate!"
"Nothing will be decided with
out you," Gorbachev replied. "We
will decide everything together."
However, he added the follow
ing warning: "Remember, if some
one succeeds in pitting us against
each other in a clash, there will
be a tragedy. We should not allow
this."
Gorbachev was not explicit
about what such a tragedy might
be.
Soviet officials have given a vir
tual guarantee they will not use
force to keep Lithuania and its
3.7 million residents in the Soviet
Union. Foreign Ministry spokes
man Gennady I. Gerasimov told
the BBC last week the Kremlin
has "only one tool" for preventing
a breakup of the union.
