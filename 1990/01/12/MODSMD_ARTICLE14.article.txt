# Shamir presses Baker for continued work on peace talks

JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, seeking to ease friction
over stalled peace efforts, yesterday urged
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
111 to keep trying to arrange Israeli-
Palestinian talks.
But the Israeli daily Haaretz reported
Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens were studying alternatives to the
U.S.-supported plan for Israeli-
Palestinian talks in Egypt.
Haaretz said the two leaders were
looking into resuming efforts toward a

direct dialogue with Palestinians from
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
without help from Egypt. Egypt openly
consults with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which Israel considers a
terrorist organization.
Egypt offered to help arrange prelim
inary Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo
after Israel's earlier efforts at a direct
dialogue failed.
Israel has hesitated to accept the U.S.-
backed plan unless it has firm assurances
from Baker about the composition of the

Palestinian delegation and the agenda.
Shamir's top aide Yossi Ben-Aharon
told Israel Television that Israel would
seek further clarifications after receiving
a draft letter of assurances from Baker.
"There is still a difference between
what we see as a proper response and
what the Americans gave us," TV quoted
Ben-Aharon as saying.
The delay has led to warnings this
week from Baker and other officials that
the United States may abandon its
Middle East efforts.

Shamir told visiting U.S. congressmen
that Israel hoped Baker would persevere.
"Facing us is a difficult and compli
cated process and, in order to advance
it, we need a lot of patience," Shamir
said, according to his office.
The prime minister also said "we rely
on the efforts of the United States" for
success in the Israeli peace initiative.
Israel's plan calls for elections in the
occupied lands to select Palestinians for
negotiations on limited autonomy with
Israel.

The Foreign Ministry said Arens spoke
with Baker by telephone Wednesday and
that they discussed "ways of advancing
the peace process."
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin left
Thursday for the United States, where
he is to meet next week with Baker.
Also yesterday, Finance Minister
Shimon Peres, head of the center-left
Labor Party, criticized Shamir for delays
in accepting the U.S.-backed initiative.
"We can start peace talks," Peres told
a forum of manufacturers.
