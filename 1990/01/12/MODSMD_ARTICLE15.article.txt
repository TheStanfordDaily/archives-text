Noriega leftovers
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -
President Guillermo Endara and Vice
President Ricardo Arias Calderon
began demolishing Panama's old De
fense Forces headquarters yesterday,
swinging sledgehammers at what they
called the core of the Noriega dicta
torship.
The building is to be replaced by
Democracy Plaza and part of a
housing project for poor families
whose homes were destroyed in the
Dec. 20 U.S. invasion that ousted Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega from power.
"From the ashes of militarism, a
new era is born in which the state is
for the well-being of the people," En
dara said.
Arias said the headquarters
"represented the center of the Noriega
dictatorship, the heart of the Defense
Forces that he converted into an in
strument of oppression and corrup
tion."
Work is hell
WASHINGTON (AP) — A majority

of American workers are doing what
they do for such reasons as simple
chance or lack of choice, while just 41
percent hold jobs that they had
planned, according to a poll released
yestersday.
The results indicate "that many
people are trapped at less than they
could do," said Sharon Danann, re
search director at a Cleveland-based
group called 9 to 5, National Associ
ation of Working Women.
"I don't think it bodes well. People
aren't looking at their job as a lifelong
development, as a way to grow," she
said. "They're not dreaming of the
stars."
The survey of 1,350 people was con
ducted last October by the Gallup Or
ganization for the National Occupa
tional Information Coordinating Com
mittee, a panel Congress created to
make better use of job information.
Iran-Iraq talks resume
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A Soviet
proposal to mediate stalled peace talks
between Iran and Iraq made headway
yesterday when officials of the two

nations expressed support for Mos
cow's offer.
A senior Iranian Foreign Ministry
official said Iran will look positively
at the Soviet proposal, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency re
ported.
The Iraqi foreign ministry in Bagh
dad also issued a statement yesterday
welcoming the Soviet role.
Law encourages abuses
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Califor
nia's civil rights agency called Thurs
day for suspension of penalties against
employers who hire illegal aliens and
said federal immigration officials are
contributing to widespread discrimi
nation against foreign-looking job
seekers.
The Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service has failed to enforce a
ban on discrimination in the 1986 im
migration law and has not educated
employers adequately about the law,
leaving many of them afraid to hire
foreign-appearing applicants despite
proof of legal residency.
