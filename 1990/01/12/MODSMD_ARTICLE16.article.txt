# GDR security force criticized

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A decision by
the East German Communist Party to set
up a new internal security force drew a
stiff rebuke yesterday from the State De
partment.
"Non-Communist political groups strug
gling to organize for the promised free
elections May 6 (ire understandably con
cerned that such a force could be used for
political intimidation," the department said
in a statement.
In the past, the hated secret police,
popularly known as "Stasi," used repressive
measures to help ensure 40 years of Com
munist control.
East German government officials say
about 26,000 of the 85,000 state security
employees have been taken off the payroll.
But opposition groups want guarantees
that the force will be disarmed and as
surances that former agents will not have
a part in a new agency.
In a speech to the national parliament,
Prime Minister Hans Modrow, who has
U.S. support, said "the aim is not to main
tain the old structure" of state security.
But, he said, "there cannot be a security
vacuum."
Modrow cited violence by neo-Nazi
groups as well as "terrorism, drugs and
ecological crime."

Still, the State Department was sharply
critical of the development.
It said the East German Communist
Party was struggling to prove its credibility
with the East German people.
"Re-establishing a police force such as
the one which existed in the past
only put that credbility into further doubt,"
the statement said.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 111
went to Potsdam last month to meet with
Modrow and, separately, with a group of
Lutheran ministers, several of whom had
opposed the old regime.
He signaled his support for Modrow, who
is considered by the State Department a
reliable force for moderation in East Ger
many. At the same time, though, U.S. of
ficials are concerned about indications that
a mood of retribution is prevalent among
East Germans who felt the sting of the
ousted regime.
Political divisions and shortages of food
and fuel also contribute to unease within
the Bush administration about Modrow's
chances of maintaining control until the
promised elections in May.
An independent trade union movement
threatened yesterday to call a nationwide
strike Jan. 25 over the security force issue.
