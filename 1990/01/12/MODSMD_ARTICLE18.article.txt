University action should
follow sexual assault task
force's protocol report

IN THE FIGHT to combat rape
on this campus, an important
piece of the puzzle is in place.
A forthcoming report by the Uni
versity's Task Force on Sexual As
sault will detail a protocol for
survivors of sexual assaults to fol
low in reporting the crimes.
In essence, the task force's report
aims to increase reports of sexual
assaults by providing a supportive
atmosphere for victims who come
forward.
The three "gateways" for report
ing the crimes will focus on helping
survivors recover psychologically
from the attack. The task force
recognizes that the emphasis needs
to be not only on capturing the
culprit but also on aiding the
woman who has been raped.
The publicity the University is
giving this plan will increase the
accessibility of the resources for
women who have been sexually as
saulted. While previously there
was no clear course of action for
victims of sexual assault who
wanted to report, women will be
encouraged to call, and the
gateways will either provide or
point out medical, legal and coun
seling services.
Of course, more pieces must be
placed to complete this puzzle. The
task force is not a policy-making
body â€” it can only make sugges
tions; other entities in the Univer
sity must follow its advice with
action.
First, it is time for a public state
ment from the Judicial Affairs Of
fice about the prosecution of rapes
on this campus. Currently, many
people do not see an active com
mitment on the part of the Uni

versity to prosecute attackers
under the Fundamental Standard.
Such a statement would perhaps
also help encourage women to
report to the University.
The University should show its
commitment to the prevention of
rape on this campus by prosecuting
rape cases sensitively, expeditiously
and fairly.
Another piece of the puzzle of
eliminating rape is keeping the
campus safe. Locks on bathrooms
and other safety devices need to
be installed everywhere in order
to aid in keeping the dorms and
outside areas out of reach of
strangers.
The most pressing danger, how
ever, is acquaintance rape. The
task force was appointed after a
May 1988 survey by the Rape Ed
ucation Project showed that alarm
ingly high percentages of women
have experienced sexual coercion.
Moreover, the survey revealed that
98 percent of women who had en
countered sexual coercion actually
knew their attackers.
The publication of a comprehen
sive University policy on sexual as
sault, with developmental guidance
from the task force, would send a
firm message that sexual assault
in any form will not be tolerated
in the Stanford community.
For the current report, the task
force should be congratulated for
outlining a clear set of actions for
survivors of sexual assaults.
Women will have information and
support about reporting readily
available.
But starting now, many different
entities inside the University
should make concrete efforts to
help eliminate rape. A number of
student organizations are educat
ing the campus about the reality
of rape; the University too must
do its part.
These pieces may not solve the
puzzle, but they are important
steps towards a solution.
