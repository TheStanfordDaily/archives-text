'Storybook' textbooks caused cultural illiteracy

RECENTLY, I read an article in
The Wall Street Journal ex
pounding on the tragedies of
American cultural illiteracy. In order to
demonstrate the results of a recent
survey highlighting the cultural il
literacy of collegians, the article asked
a few simple questions that every
college student is supposed to know
but doesn't.
Among the questions they asked
were — Who wrote "Moby Dick"? I
knew that. Who wrote "A Letter from
Birmingham Jail"? I knew that too.
Who wrote "The Republic"? Three for
three. What was the Missouri Compro
mise? On that question I became one
more tragic statistic in a nation of
cultural illiterates.
Dejected, I went to look the answer
up in my old U.S. history textbook.
There was an explanation of the
Missouri Compromise to be sure; but
it was so convoluted I had to read it
three times before I could figure out
what it was.
Although I did not find an adequate
answer to my query, what I did find

was a possible explanaton for my
generation's cultural illiteracy.
The explanation lies in the style in
which the textbook was written. To
quote the author, Stanford's own Prof.
David Kennedy, '"The American
Pageant' is one of the few textbooks
with a personality. We have maintained
a strong chronological narrative . . .
and a measure of wit."
To put it another way, the textbook
reads like a storybook. All the "main
characters" (Washington, Lincoln,
Jefferson) are given lengthy, flam
boyant descriptions as well as descrip
tive anecdotes to help make the leaders
of the past a bit more real, just as a
novelist does.
On the average, approximately 30
percent of any page is non-text, be it
illustration, political cartoon or
drawing designed to add a little zest to
the story.
Creating a U.S. history textbook that
reads like a Tom Clancy novel was a
great idea. It keeps us interested in
what can be, but should not be, a
boring subject.

Creating a U.S. history

This style of textbook was the result
of an education reform movement of
the 1970s the pith of which was that
we would learn more if we were inter
ested in what we were learning.
Sadly, my culturally illiterate class
mates and I are the result of this
failed experiment.
I am more interested in history than
my father was. I was just never en
dowed with the solid foundation of
detailed facts he had — details that
were supposed to form the cornerstone
of my higher education.
Unfortunately, 10 years later, The
Wall Street Journal did not ask us
what the general mood of the country
was in 1862; nor did they ask us what
kind of a guy Jefferson Davis really

was. All they wanted to know was the
date of the Battle of Antietam.
Today I am still interested in U.S.
history, but when I took 20th Century
America here, I found myself frus
trated because the professor's lectures
and readings presumed 1 had a much
deeper working knowledge of history
than I actually did, which is ironic
because the same professor who taught
the course also wrote my high school
textbook.
If my generation is indeed culturally
illiterate, then I suggest that it is a
result of the "storybook textbooks" of
the 1980s.
Perhaps in the 1990s a balance can
be found between Kennedy's "textbook
with personality" and the textbooks of
the past generations which undoubtedly
read like dictionaries.
Perhaps we can spare our future
generations the humiliation of being
deemed "culturally illiterate" without
creating an entire generation of disin
terested, fact-filled drones.
