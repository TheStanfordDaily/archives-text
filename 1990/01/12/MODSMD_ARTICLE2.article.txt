# NCAA puts forth tougher guidelines
## Drug-test ruling won't affect Stanford 
### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
A new NCAA decision to require year
round drug testing of players in major
football programs will not affect Stan
ford — for the time being.
A 1987 Santa Clara County Superior
Court injunction ruled that the NCAA's
testing program violated athletes' right
to privacy.
A Stanford diver, Simone Levant, won
the injunction after she refused to un
dergo drug testing and sued the NCAA.
Two other Stanford athletes, football
player Barry McKeever and soccer
player Jennifer Hill, joined the suit in
1988, and the court also ruled in their
favor.
The NCAA appealed the decision, and
the case is still in progress — and while

it "finds its way
through the courts,"
notes Athletic Director
Andy Geiger, "the in
junction stands."
The NCAA voted by
a large margin Wednes
day to test football
players at the 192 Di
vision I-A and I-AA
schools for perfor-

mance-enhancing drugs randomly year
round. Stanford belongs to Division I-A.
The association also voted to impose
harsher penalties on athletes in all
sports who test positive for drugs. Until
Wednesday's decision, the NCAA tested
athletes only at NCAA championships.
The first time an athlete tests posi
tive, he or she will lose a year of
eligibility. A second positive test for

"street drugs" like cocaine or marijuana
will result in the loss of another year.
A second positive test for steroids or
other performance-enhancing drugs
would result in the athlete being banned
from athletics at NCAA schools.
The NCAA Executive Committee ex
panded testing in the football program
for two years, beginning in August. The
program may be expanded to other
sports if it proves successful.
But Geiger and others noted that dif
fering court rulings and state constitu
tions will prevent uniform enforcement
of the new rules.
"We could end up in a position where
under a state constitution, we are not
able to comply with NCAA rules. Maybe
the result is we have to leave the
