# In invading Panama, it was correct to show a little muscle
## 
### 
In her Jan. 10 column, Malinda
McCollum derides President Bush and
his military advisers as being
"transported teenagers trashing the
Panamanian political and economic
system" — a system that was
dominated by a corrupt dictator who
oppressed his people, laundered drug
money and protected members of the
Medellin cocaine cartel.
Most Panamanians approve of the

United States' action, as do most
Americans. The corrupt Panamanian
political and military structure has
been "trashed," and a better one can
now be installed; Panama's economy
might be in a shambles, but that can
be attributed mainly to Noriega, not to
the recent military action that set the
nation free.
While asserting that the invasion
was motivated by President Bush's
supposed feelings of insecurity toward
his "manhood," McCollum cites her
"extensive knowledge of pop psychol
_ff
°gy-
Unfortunately, pop psychology, pop
music, pop culture, pop anything all
tend to be rather shallow. A deeper

analysis of the situation is needed.
America is a strong country and has
the ability to help oppressed nations
like Panama.
If it repeatedly fails to do so, or if it
turns its back when unarmed Ameri
can soldiers are beaten and shot by
foreign soldiers (as happened in
Panama), other nations will lose re
spect for the United States.
The result is that we will be more
frequently challenged and forced to
defend ourselves. Showing a little
muscle is not a bad thing. Of course,
McCollum would strongly (though pas
sively) disagree, attributing such a
feeling to little boys who are "anxious
about their manhood."

The implication is that a woman
would have failed to invade Panama,
failed to invade France in either World
War or failed to sign the Declaration of
Independence. Sorry, Malinda, I'd
rather be a guy.
American intervention succeeded in
freeing Panama from an oppressive
dictator and in giving us an opportu
nity to bring Noriega to justice.
In criticizing the invasion as being
an adolescent power trip, McCollum
misses the point. Regardless of mo
tives, the operation was a positive one,
giving Panama a brighter future and
providing an example to others.
