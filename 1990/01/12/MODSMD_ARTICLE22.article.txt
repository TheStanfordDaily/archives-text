## The
						junior year of panic 
### 
EACH YEAR of college seems to
have its own crisis: "the freshman
fifteen," "the sophomore slump,"
"senioritis." It seems that for almost any
year of college, you usually have some
thing to complain and worry about.
Junior year, strangely enough, doesn't
seem to have its own clich6d trauma.
As a junior, however, I've noticed a
state of mind peculiar to this year as
I've observed my friends and acquaint
ances. Let's call it the "junior panic."
I cannot describe its effects on every
one, since it cannot be readily pigeon
holed, but some manifestations are
readily familiar:
Some worry over declaring a major,
others begin to waver on lifelong desires
to attend medical/law/business school and
still more begin to quiver in the face of
a rapidly approaching graduation date —
"Only five quarters left and I still don't
know what I want to make of my life!"
I can't say that any of these particular
dilemmas has had any serious effect on
me, but there is something about this
point in my life that unsetttles me and
leaves me feeling dislocated.
Never have I felt dislocation as acutely
as over this past winter break. My sense
of connection to my hometown has weak
ened dramatically as I come closer to
building my own life.
High school friends have faded into the
pages of the yearbooks. Few experiences
are sadder — or more inevitable — than
sitting across from an old high school
friend who you could have bled on four
years ago and finding that you have al
most nothing to share with one another,

except perhaps to rehash old glory days.
Even my family has ceased to play the
same role it always has. But how couldn't
it? By the time my family and I adjust
to living with each other again, I'm ready
to return to school and they're ready for
me to go.
But it's more than that; it's an adjust
ment to relating as adults, rather than
relating as parents and child.
As my clumsy prose illustrates, it's a
difficult adjustment to explain, let alone
to make. But as they stop openly second
guessing my choices, and I cease to look
to them to make those choices for me, a
disconnection takes place.
I love my family, but the adjustment
has nothing to do with that. I can't return
to adolescence. The future is beginning
to take a definite shape and it's my
responsiblity to make sure I'm happy
with it's final form.
The people I spent time with over this
past vacation have established, or are
establishing, their careers and are looking
forward to having their own families.
Part of me yearns for those opportu
nities, increasingly so as I approach grad
uation, while another part of me revels
in the opportunities that I can only enjoy
at Stanford. My sense of dislocation, and
that of my friends, arises when I try to
reconcile the two.
Stanford isn't the easiest place to take
responsibility. We can drop classes and
obtain extensions — we can't even flunk
a class. Students are left to themselves
to mature.
By junior year, most have at least
recognized the need to grow up, and some

panic and some smack their lips at the
chance to build a life.
I suppose my dilemma is wanting to
have the best of both worlds: the intel
lectual excitement of Stanford and the
chance to take control of my life. Perhaps
that's my own strain of the "junior
panic."
I've said in the past that Stanford is
the only place I've ever been where I
don't feel like I should be somewhere
else. That still holds true to some extent,
but I also know that this is temporary,
a way station, and that to want to stay
in the Ivy Tower forever would be im
mature and regressive.
A professor once told a class of mine
that he saw a university as a place where
students learn to make mature decisions
in critical situations, and they should be
able to carry that ability through the
rest of their lives. I have yet to hear a
better elucidation of a university's duty.
I just hope that's what I'm learning.
I'll know soon enough.
