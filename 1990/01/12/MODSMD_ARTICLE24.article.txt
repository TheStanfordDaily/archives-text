## Unlike racism, homophobia is definitely not 'out’ on this campus 
### 
AS I EXITED from the room, my
freshman roommate muttered
"fag" under his breath.
Did I hear that correctly? Did he call
me that name? I was shocked and
appalled. I just walked away, stunned,
and tried to forget what had just
occurred.
He would not let me forget, though.
He called me a "fag" the next night
and the day after that. Three times he
uttered that word and I felt so
degraded.
Why did he do this to me? 1 tried to
come up with some explanations for
his homophobic language. Maybe he
was mad at me. Maybe he was angry
at the world and took it out on me.
I pondered these as possibilities and
then thought of two more that really
frightened me. Maybe he hated me so
much for being the person that I am
or he truly believed that males who
are not 100 percent heterosexual are
"fags."
I accepted these last two reasons as
possibilities, but I tried not to think
that his comments reflected his true
intolerence of others who happen to b'„
different. He would prove me wrong.
As I sat on my bed listening to the
stereo, he got on the phone with one
of his friends back home. I will proba
bly never forget the conversation he
had.

He purposely brought up the subject
of homosexuals in a derogatory man
ner. He was yelling into the phone that
he was gay, but about twenty seconds
later he said that he was only kidding.
He thought the whole charade was
very funny.
He then went on about how you
would not find any of "them" in his
hometown, but that there are plenty of
"queers" all over California. He told
his friend how you were bound to meet
some here and that he had the experi
ence of actually knowing and putting
up with one (an obvious reference to
me).
At that point, I left the room dis
gusted. His little theatrical show was
meant to upset me and it did. I was
viciously dehumanized and needed to
get the hell out of there.
I did not want to go back there, but
I knew I had to return eventually. I
knew that 1 should not have been
made to feel that way, but yet it hap
pened.
Writing about these incidents raises
a couple of questions for me and I do
not know if the answers 1 come up
with will be satisfactory.
Do I have the right to be free from
homophobic language? Did he have the
right to say what he did, even though
he dehumanized me?

Unfortunately, we do not live in a
perfect world. Justice does not always
prevail. Somehow, the right to freedom
of speech prevails over the right to
freedom from intimidation, intolerance
and the like.
As much as I hated what he said, he
did have the right to his freedom of
speech. The last time I checked, specif
ically calling someone a "fag" was not
a crime in California, or for that mat
ter, at Stanford.
For some people, using that word is
morally wrong, but for a great many
others, it is not. I explained the situa
tion to a resident assistant and she
said that if he continued with his
homophobic comments, I should tell
him to stop because such language is
reprehensible and offensive to me as
well.
Fortunately, his homophobic remarks
stopped after the initial incidents, so I
never had to confront him. However, if
I had said something, I think they
would have started up again. He might
have also made some innuendos about
me or ambiguous statements that could
be construed to be homophobic.
What could I have done then? I
could not censor his speech when he
was talking with his friends.
He even sometimes referred to
women as "bitches." I tolerated it, but

I did not like it. I could not force this
person to not say that word — un
fortunately, he has the right to. In the
society in which we live, there is no
right to be free from vile behavior.
The most horrifying aspect of it all
was my feeling of helplessness. I say to
myself over and over again that I
should have the right to be free from
such harrassment and intimidation, but
I do not.
I asked the RA if there was another
room available and she said I was
stuck there till the end of the quarter.
I just had to put up with it.
I just wanted to be out of there. The
irony of it all was that / asked if I
could move out, even though I had not
done anything.
The sense of helplessness branched
out to my other emotions. Anger built
up inside of me. The third time he
called me a "fag," I wanted to strike
him. At the time, I had this fantasy of
breaking something that belonged to
him. It would have made me feel so
much better if I did do that, but in
the end, I would have come off looking
like the villain.
I lost all respect for this person and
began to hate him. That scared me. I
have disliked people in the past, but
this was the first time that I felt a
passion of hatred toward another
human being.

Even if I told this person how using
such language hurt me, it probably
would have been lost on him. I believe
it is lost on this University.
The administration goes through an
uproar when a black person is referred
to as "nigger," but there is little (if
any) commotion when a gay man is
called "faggot" or when a lesbian is
referred to as a "dyke."
Homophobia is "in," but racism is
definitely "out."
This experience has not totally jaded
my outlook on life, however. I will be
harassed and intimated in the future
for what I am, but I know what to
expect.
On a philosophical level, this whole
experience has shown me what
sacrifices are made when the right to
freedom of speech overrules the right
to freedom from dehumanization. Some
compromises are too great, but in the
society in which we live, concessions
must be made by those who are op
pressed.
I do not like it, but until differences
are respected and not just tolerated
(meaning no more lip service from the
University), I guess that I just have to
accept them and move on with my life.
