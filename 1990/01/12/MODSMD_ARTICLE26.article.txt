## Former Cabinet member joins private life at Stanford 
### Jennifer Schmid Editorial staff 
John Gardner is unpacking his
things and settling down to teach
at the university he attended 50
years ago.
Gardner, a California native,
has become Stanford's Miriam
and Peter Haas Centennial Pro
fessor in Public Service, a half
time teaching position in the grad
uate schools of business and ed
ucation. After years of being away
from Stanford and the West
Coast, Gardner says he's glad to
be back.
Gardner graduated from Stan
ford "with great distinction" and
went on to pursue a prolific and
varied career. Among other high
lights, he served as Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare
under Lyndon Johnson, was
Chair of the National Urban Co
alition and, in 1970, founded the
national citizens' lobby group
Common Cause.
These are but a few of his ac
complishments, however, for John
Gardner has also taught college,
been the president of a major cor
poration, edited John F. Ken
nedy's book, "To Turn the Tide,"
and written several books of his
own.
The 77-year-old professor, now
busy organizing and beginning
lecture sessions this quarter,
seems to have an endless supply
of energy and determination.
Gardner is approaching his new
job with enthusiasm, although he
is still, in his words, "just settling
in." For someone with such a
high-powered past, it would seem
he might miss the hustle and
bustle of Washington, the lure of
high-prestige public life. But
Gardner says no: "I came into
public life very late," he explains.
"You really need to start early to
get a taste of public life, to be
comfortable with it. By the time
I got started, I was too much of
a private citizen to enjoy the
theater of public life... . No, I
don't miss Washington."
Gardner describes the feeling

of being a Cabinet member as
being part of this "theater of
public life."
"As a Cabinet member," he
says, "you rarely walk into a room
alone. You always have a couple
of aides along and the cameras
start clicking" when you enter. In
addition, he continues, "there
isn't really the time to reflect on
what you're doing because you're
so incredibly busy. Therefore, you
need to have the ideas (about
what you want to accomplish in
office) before you come in."
Gardner certainly had the ideas,
but he didn't choose to pursue
this public path until the rela
tively late age of 53. When he
first graduated from Stanford, he
instead chose to become a profes
sor, teaching psychology at the
University of California, Connec
ticut College for Women and
Mount Holyoke College. When
World War II started, he joined
the U.S. Marine Corps and, for a
time, also served with the Office
of Strategic Services (the
predecessor of the CIA) in Wash
ington, Italy and Austria.
After the war, Gardner joined
the Carnegie Corporation and be
came president of the corporation
in 1955. He says it was during
this time that he began consulting
at various governmental agencies,
and became involved with the
Eisenhower, Kennedy and
Johnson administrations.
After serving on several presi
dential commissions and task
forces, Gardner was offered and
accepted the post of Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare in
1965, at the height of President
Johnson's "Great Society" legis
lation.
Speaking of those years,
Gardner says the phrase Great
Society, "expressed an aspiration
rather than what really was."
Nevertheless, he feels it was a
period of great events in govern
ment. "You often hear the Great
Society was a failure, but I am
bound to believe history will judge
Johnson well on his social pro
grams," Gardner says in defense

of the period.
It came under Gardner's juris
diction, as head of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare, to implement
federal programs aimed at im
proving schools, health facilities
and inner-city living conditions.
It was under Gardner's leadership
that Medicare was first launched,
and his department was also
greatly affected by the civil rights
movement.
Gardner, who happened to be a
Republican in a Democratic
stronghold, says he had to wage
"daily battles" in order to get his
job done.
The problem, he explains, was
not just the tasks facing him —
it was the powerful southern
governors who would object to
specific acts of his, and the gov
ernmental committees he dealt
with which at the time were in
variably headed by Democratic
southerners. Although the prob
lem of school integration was
probably the most dramatic and
best remembered by the American
public, there were many other
problems Gardner was faced with
as part of a day's work.
Such resistance might have
deterred a man with less deter
mination than John Gardner, but
according to him, there was little
else to do than simply dig in and
hold his ground. As he defines his
job: "I had a law to enforce and
1 wasn't interested in compromis
ing."
Gardner's reputation grew, and
with it came potential chances for
further public posts. When Robert
Kennedy was assassinated in
1968, Gardner was offered his
Senate seat but declined. Four
years later, he was mentioned as
a possible Republican presidential
candidate, but again declined to
pursue the opportunity. Gardner
had other opportunities in mind,
and these focused on making the
average citizen more of a partic
ipant in the government.
According to him, the motiva
tion for founding the national
citizens' lobby group Common
Cause was that, "I was convinced

that we needed a way to hold the
government accountable." This
was combined with a feeling that
people would participate more in
the government if they had a way
of doing so, and so, with charac
teristic determination, Common
Cause was born.
Gardner says there was imme
diately a lot of interest in the
group — around 100,000 mem
bers joined in a matter of weeks.
He describes the groups' efforts
as like "a massive letter-writing
campaign. . . . We had members
participating in every congres
sional district."
He believes the lobby has helped
a great deal in opening up gov
ernment affairs to the concerned
public, and this achieves the goal
of making the government "ac
countable." "People behave better
when thev think someone's watch

ing them," Gardner explains with
a smile.
And so, John Gardner should
be able to relax now, right? Take
it easy and enjoy California? Well,
he probably intends to do that,
but relaxation doesn't seem to
come easy to a man used to taking
charge. This past year saw the
publication of his seventh book,
entitled "On Leadership."
Gardner says the ideas in the last
couple of chapters of the book are
particularly intriguing him right
now, because the chapters deal
with the question of human po
tential and how it is often wasted.
According to Gardner, even
talented people go through life
using only half of their inherent
potential. He thinks most people
need to be challenged or should
challenge themselves to find out
what their true talents are.

Gardner also thinks students
should get involved with the
public sector at a young age, to
develop a taste and a habit for it.
Currently, he says "A lot of young
people don't have an interest in
how we're governed, and I think
that's wrong."
He admits that public life may
need to be made more attractive
for young people, and character
istically has thought of a few im
provements, such as raising public
service salaries and improving the
growth opportunities for young
people in governmental agencies.
Basically, however, Gardner's
advice to students is to jump in
and take an interest in how this
country is run. "Democracy is a
messy process, I know, but you
have to have faith in it,"he says.
Gardner, an old pro, knows what
he's talking about.

John Gardner, Stanford's Miriam and Peter Haas Professor of Public Service, pauses for a moment
before his office at the Graduate School of Business.
John Gardner is unpacking his
things and settling down to teach
at the university he attended 50
years ago.
Gardner, a California native,
has become Stanford's Miriam
and Peter Haas Centennial Pro
fessor in Public Service, a half
time teaching position in the grad
uate schools of business and ed
ucation. After years of being away
from Stanford and the West
Coast, Gardner says he's glad to
be back.
Gardner graduated from Stan
ford "with great distinction" and
went on to pursue a prolific and
varied career. Among other high
lights, he served as Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare
under Lyndon Johnson, was
Chair of the National Urban Co
alition and, in 1970, founded the
national citizens' lobby group
Common Cause.
These are but a few of his ac
complishments, however, for John
Gardner has also taught college,
been the president of a major cor
poration, edited John F. Ken
nedy's book, "To Turn the Tide,"
and written several books of his
own.
The 77-year-old professor, now
busy organizing and beginning
lecture sessions this quarter,
seems to have an endless supply
of energy and determination.
Gardner is approaching his new
job with enthusiasm, although he
is still, in his words, "just settling
in." For someone with such a
high-powered past, it would seem
he might miss the hustle and
bustle of Washington, the lure of
high-prestige public life. But
Gardner says no: "I came into
public life very late," he explains.
"You really need to start early to
get a taste of public life, to be
comfortable with it. By the time
I got started, I was too much of
a private citizen to enjoy the
theater of public life... . No, I
don't miss Washington."
Gardner describes the feeling

of being a Cabinet member as
being part of this "theater of
public life."
"As a Cabinet member," he
says, "you rarely walk into a room
alone. You always have a couple
of aides along and the cameras
start clicking" when you enter. In
addition, he continues, "there
isn't really the time to reflect on
what you're doing because you're
so incredibly busy. Therefore, you
need to have the ideas (about
what you want to accomplish in
office) before you come in."
Gardner certainly had the ideas,
but he didn't choose to pursue
this public path until the rela
tively late age of 53. When he
first graduated from Stanford, he
instead chose to become a profes
sor, teaching psychology at the
University of California, Connec
ticut College for Women and
Mount Holyoke College. When
World War II started, he joined
the U.S. Marine Corps and, for a
time, also served with the Office
of Strategic Services (the
predecessor of the CIA) in Wash
ington, Italy and Austria.
After the war, Gardner joined
the Carnegie Corporation and be
came president of the corporation
in 1955. He says it was during
this time that he began consulting
at various governmental agencies,
and became involved with the
Eisenhower, Kennedy and
Johnson administrations.
After serving on several presi
dential commissions and task
forces, Gardner was offered and
accepted the post of Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare in
1965, at the height of President
Johnson's "Great Society" legis
lation.
Speaking of those years,
Gardner says the phrase Great
Society, "expressed an aspiration
rather than what really was."
Nevertheless, he feels it was a
period of great events in govern
ment. "You often hear the Great
Society was a failure, but I am
bound to believe history will judge
Johnson well on his social pro
grams," Gardner says in defense

of the period.
It came under Gardner's juris
diction, as head of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare, to implement
federal programs aimed at im
proving schools, health facilities
and inner-city living conditions.
It was under Gardner's leadership
that Medicare was first launched,
and his department was also
greatly affected by the civil rights
movement.
Gardner, who happened to be a
Republican in a Democratic
stronghold, says he had to wage
"daily battles" in order to get his
job done.
The problem, he explains, was
not just the tasks facing him —
it was the powerful southern
governors who would object to
specific acts of his, and the gov
ernmental committees he dealt
with which at the time were in
variably headed by Democratic
southerners. Although the prob
lem of school integration was
probably the most dramatic and
best remembered by the American
public, there were many other
problems Gardner was faced with
as part of a day's work.
Such resistance might have
deterred a man with less deter
mination than John Gardner, but
according to him, there was little
else to do than simply dig in and
hold his ground. As he defines his
job: "I had a law to enforce and
1 wasn't interested in compromis
ing."
Gardner's reputation grew, and
with it came potential chances for
further public posts. When Robert
Kennedy was assassinated in
1968, Gardner was offered his
Senate seat but declined. Four
years later, he was mentioned as
a possible Republican presidential
candidate, but again declined to
pursue the opportunity. Gardner
had other opportunities in mind,
and these focused on making the
average citizen more of a partic
ipant in the government.
According to him, the motiva
tion for founding the national
citizens' lobby group Common
Cause was that, "I was convinced

that we needed a way to hold the
government accountable." This
was combined with a feeling that
people would participate more in
the government if they had a way
of doing so, and so, with charac
teristic determination, Common
Cause was born.
Gardner says there was imme
diately a lot of interest in the
group — around 100,000 mem
bers joined in a matter of weeks.
He describes the groups' efforts
as like "a massive letter-writing
campaign. . . . We had members
participating in every congres
sional district."
He believes the lobby has helped
a great deal in opening up gov
ernment affairs to the concerned
public, and this achieves the goal
of making the government "ac
countable." "People behave better
when thev think someone's watch

ing them," Gardner explains with
a smile.
And so, John Gardner should
be able to relax now, right? Take
it easy and enjoy California? Well,
he probably intends to do that,
but relaxation doesn't seem to
come easy to a man used to taking
charge. This past year saw the
publication of his seventh book,
entitled "On Leadership."
Gardner says the ideas in the last
couple of chapters of the book are
particularly intriguing him right
now, because the chapters deal
with the question of human po
tential and how it is often wasted.
According to Gardner, even
talented people go through life
using only half of their inherent
potential. He thinks most people
need to be challenged or should
challenge themselves to find out
what their true talents are.

was combined with a feeling that
people would participate more in
the government if they had a way
of doing so, and so, with charac
teristic determination, Common
Cause was born.
Gardner says there was imme
diately a lot of interest in the
group — around 100,000 mem
bers joined in a matter of weeks.
He describes the groups' efforts
as like "a massive letter-writing
campaign. . . . We had members
participating in every congres
sional district."
He believes the lobby has helped
a great deal in opening up gov
ernment affairs to the concerned
public, and this achieves the goal
of making the government "ac
countable." "People behave better
when thev think someone's watch

ing them," Gardner explains with
a smile.
And so, John Gardner should
be able to relax now, right? Take
it easy and enjoy California? Well,
he probably intends to do that,
but relaxation doesn't seem to
come easy to a man used to taking
charge. This past year saw the
publication of his seventh book,
entitled "On Leadership."
Gardner says the ideas in the last
couple of chapters of the book are
particularly intriguing him right
now, because the chapters deal
with the question of human po
tential and how it is often wasted.
According to Gardner, even
talented people go through life
using only half of their inherent
potential. He thinks most people
need to be challenged or should
challenge themselves to find out
what their true talents are.

Gardner also thinks students
should get involved with the
public sector at a young age, to
develop a taste and a habit for it.
Currently, he says "A lot of young
people don't have an interest in
how we're governed, and I think
that's wrong."
He admits that public life may
need to be made more attractive
for young people, and character
istically has thought of a few im
provements, such as raising public
service salaries and improving the
growth opportunities for young
people in governmental agencies.
Basically, however, Gardner's
advice to students is to jump in
and take an interest in how this
country is run. "Democracy is a
messy process, I know, but you
have to have faith in it,"he says.
Gardner, an old pro, knows what
he's talking about.
