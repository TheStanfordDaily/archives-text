# Consult your Stanford horoscope
## An astrological guide to life on the Farm, first week of winter quarter 
### 
By Mac and Mabel
Capricorn
(Dec. 22 — Jan. 20):
Your natural drive and ambi
tion lead you in the right direc
tion this week. Go with your
instincts when choosing a class:
your gut reaction is correct this
time.
Aquarius
(Jan. 21 — Feb. 20):
Pluto's retrograde motion
brings confusion as you feel
pressured to conform. Don't be
afraid to express your own
opinions. Beware of both a
moronic biker near the Clock
Tower and a former romantic
interest.
Pisces
(Feb. 21 — March 20):
A new and friendly face in
class wants to meet you. But in
this case nothing will happen
unless you take the initiative.
This will go quite well and may
surpass your wildest expecta
tions.
Aries
(March 21 — April 20):
Beware of excessive alcohol
consumption. This is a sign
from Libra that Cancer is on
the cusp of your new era of
unconsciousness. While fate
beckons increased liver failure
for the new year, fear not, for
that is the paranoia of Leo, the
false moralist of spring.

Taurus
(April 21 — May 20):
Go back to sleep for this is
not your week. The ATM hates
you and so does your roommate.
You will receive nothing but bills
from the postal deliverer. Don't
even think about romance for
you've been slugged with the
ugly stick several times over.
Gemini
(May 21 — June 20):
Revitalized from three weeks
of sleep and MTV, the world is
at your doorstep. The sun will
shine, and the rising aspect in
Gemini's third house indicates
academic and career success.
Cancer
(June 21 — July 22):
You've resolved to get your
act together this quarter. After
fall's disaster(s), you have a firm
resolve to study more, party less
and make the most of your Stan
ford experience. You will uphold
these new resolutions for most
of this week, but failure looms
imminent as Saturn's shadow
lurks on the cusp.
IjCO
(July 23 — August 22):
Your natural confidence and
born leadership abilities make
you obnoxious and arrogant this
week. Take pride in your inner
strength for it's all you've got.
The fire within will make a bud
ding romance crash and burn,
and plans for the future look
exceptionally dim.

Virgo
(Aug. 23 - Sept. 22):
Bacchus gazes fondly upon
Virgo, and you should gaze
fondly back. The quarter will
rush by, so take advantage of
the extraordinary profusion of
pleasure presented to you.
Venus is in opposition, but your
social talents will spark every
one's interest. Rutting like
crazed weasles, they will fever
ishly pursue you.
Libra
(Sept. 23 - Oct. 22):
Scale down plans in the jus
tice department. Concentrate on
balancing your activities be
tween weighty personal matters
and massive financial difficul
ties.
Scorpio
(Oct. 23 — Nov. 22):
A long-time friend wants
something more. Time to re
evaluate your priorities and to
explore new regions of your
emotions. Mars threatens your
decision and guarantees failure
if you attempt to resolve your
conflict now. Stall for time.
Sagittarius
(Nov. 23 — Dec. 21):
Pisces native returns to haunt
you when that unsightly
blemish on your lip doesn't dis
appear after a week. Your
clothes clash, your ride will be
stolen and you will gain even
more weight than you did over
break.
