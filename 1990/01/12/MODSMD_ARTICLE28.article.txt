# New Year's Resolution: Write the Bug.
## 
### 
If you wanna know something
but are too embarrassed to ask
anyone, ask me, and I'll print your
embarrassing question and your
name so everybody knows. On the
other hand, if you have a perfectly
unexciting question which you
simply don't have the motivation
to find the answer to yourself,
just Bug Me, and I'll do all the
boring interviews and research for
you myself (term help is also avail
able â€” just send $19.99 with your
topic, and I'll send you the paper).
You can ask the Bug anything.
Send Bug Me questions you would
normally address to Dear Abby,
Dr. Ruth, Carl Sagan or any com
bination thereof. Write to: Bug
Me, Stanford Daily, Storke Pub
lications Building, Stanford, CA
94309. Or send the Bug messages
on Macbeth at B.Bug-Me.
The Bug is currently recovering
from New Year's celebrations, but
will be back as usual every Friday
beginning next week.
