## Women cagers destroy helpless Huskies by 40 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
It is said the great teams lift
their game to another plane in
the big games. Well, last night the
Stanford women's basketball team
lifted its game to another planet.
Dominating in nearly every cat
egory, the Cardinal bent, folded,
spindled and mutilated the Wash
ington Huskies en route to a 102-
62 blowout before a raucous
crowd of of 3,512 at Maples Pa
vilion.

Women's Basketball

Stanford 102
Washington 62

Entering the game, Washington
was ranked seventh nationally
while Stanford was ranked No. 2.
Games between two top-10 teams
simply aren't decided by 40 points.
But this one was, and the fallout
was obvious.
Players from both sides were
so stunned by the result they had
a tough time explaining it. Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer was
her typical understated self. "Our
frontline players did a great job,"
she said. "They have an excellent

team.
"We just had a couple more
bodies to throw at them tonight,"
VanDerveer added.
It wasn't clear what the remark
was in reference to, though. While
Cardinal reserves outscored their
Husky counterparts 23-12, it was
the 79-50 edge for the Stanford
starters that made the most dif
ference.
All-American Jennifer Azzi led
her team with 21 points while
dishing out nine assists. Trisha
Stevens chipped in 20 to go with
her 10 rebounds and Katy Steding
added 12 points and 11 boards.
The Cardinal quintet opened a
6-0 lead in the first minute and
never looked back. With Stanford
ahead 27-20 and 6:34 remaining
in the first half, the squad reeled
off 16 straight points in under
four minutes to put the game
away.
In that span Julie Zeilstra
scored six points and Azzi had
five. By the time intermission ar
rived, the Cardinal led by 19 and
its only concern was Washington's
success on the offensive boards.
"[Early on] I did not think we
were boxing out well," VanDer
veer said. By game's end, Stanford
did hold a rebounding advantage
of seven. Still, the one negative
that could be found in a near
flawless performance was allow
ing the Huskies 21 offensive
boards.
Stanford shot the ball excep
tionally well, made only 11 turn
overs, blocked six shots and got
nine steals. "Everybody on our
team was clicking tonight,"
Steding said.
The Cardinal was relentless, in
the second half, ripping Washing

ton's vaunted pressure defense for
layup after layup. Stevens scored
12 points in an eight-minute
stretch, hitting shots from every
where.
When Stanford put together an
8-0 spurt to move up 76-45, the
only question was whether the

team would crack the century
mark in the remaining 8:47.
And the Cardinal answered it
affirmatively with another run,
outscoring the Huskies 12-2.
Chris MacMurdo scored eight
points in the game's final five
minutes, including the most spec

tacular two of the game.
Stanford led 96-57 when Mac-
Murdo caught the ball in the low
post. Instead of making a conven
tional turn to face the basket and
shoot the ball, MacMurdo looked

over her right shoulder and, with
out pivoting, shot off the glass for
the layup.
It was backwards .. . and beau
tiful. "[We've] worked on a couple
of new shots," VanDerveer dead
panned.
The Cardinal turned it over
twice before finally reaching 100
with 20 seconds left on a long
inbounds pass that led to an un
contested layup for Martha Rich
ards. The sophomore forward
seems to have a knack for scoring
the 100 th point.
The Husl ties needed some new
shots themselves but couldn't find
any. They spoke of failing to ex
ecute their offense, but the bot
tom line is the team shot just 35
percent from the field. That was
a full 10 percent off their season
mark.
Stanford's defense kept the
Huskies off balance, forcing them
into a number of bad shots. The
Cardinal's tenacity, combined with
an ability to get steals and blocks,
had as much to do with the out
come as Washington's offensive
execution.
On the defensive side, the
Huskies didn't fare better. Stan
ford exploited Washington in the
low post over and over. The Car
dinal posted a stellar .642 mark
from the field by getting easy
shots in the halfcourt and on base
ball passes that led to fastbreak
layups.
Stanford came up just two sliort
of the Pac-10 mark with 32 assists.
When the dust settled, an ob
viously shellshocked Husky Coach
Chris Gobrecht kept saying things
like "that was not a basketball
game, it was a joke" and "there
were just 40 minutes of a freak
thing out there."
She did praise Val Whiting, who
scored 11 points, saying "Val
makes a tremendous difference for
them." Gobrecht credited Whiting
for much of Stanford's improve
ment between last season and
now.
Card notes
Stanford has now beaten Washing
ton in four straight and evened the
series at 5-5.
