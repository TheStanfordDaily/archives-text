# Poll shows computer voting was a success

It's easy, it's cheap, it's fast, and
it promises to be a mainstay of
the ASSU democratic process.
It's computerized voting, and
according to a report released this
week, students gave it a "thumbs
up" following use in last spring's
ASSU elections.
In fact, students responded so
favorably to the system that Steve
Krauss, ASSU elections commis
sioner and author of the report,
said computers will definitely be
used this spring, and there is a
good chance they will be used for
all future elections.
About 78 percent of voters put
ting the Macintosh-based system
through its paces liked computer
ized voting "a lot" or "fairly
much," according to the report.
Only 4.9 percent of voters did
not like computer voting at all.
Krauss said students like this
manner of voting because it's
Simple and novel.
"One big reason probably had
to do with how easy it was," he
said.
"Everybody here is already
familiar with how to use a Mac
intosh. [They arel easy to use.. . .
All these things are made to make
a novice user feel at home,"
Krauss added.
About 81 percent of those polled
felt the voting was "very easy."
He also said the novelty of

voting on a computer — the
"neatness factor" — favorably im
pressed many students.
But, he added, the time stu
dents waited to vote may have
influenced their impressions.
There was a "strong correlation
between how much they liked it
and how long they waited in line,"
he said. More than 18 percent of
students had to wait more than
20 minutes to vote.
Computerized voting also saved
the ASSU money — to the tune
of $3,300, according to the report.
Krauss did not know whether
future elections will be less ex
pensive to conduct.
He said the cost depends on
several factors including "how
many computers we have to rent
. . . (andl what kind of monetary
support we get from Apple [Com
puter Inc.]."
Krauss said one of the greatest
advantages of computerized
voting is the speed with which
the returns can be calculated.
Last spring's elections results
were available within a few hours
of the close of the polls.
The report revealed that about
43 percent of the voters were grad
uate students, a statistic which
came as "a big surprise" to
Krauss.
The "general impression that
everybody has is that the gradu
ate students are apathetic," he
said. But the report seems to dis
pell some of those impressions.
