# Card deserves No. 1 ranking

Stanford 102. Washington 62.
Husky ineptitude was not the
deciding factor. Excellence was.
When the nation's seventh best
women's basketball team, and a
Pacific 10 Conference rival at
that, is manhandled in the man
ner it was by the Cardinal last
night, the victorious squad
deserves a few accolades. The total
control of a game which on paper
should have been a battle can only
highlight the fact that Stanford
is most definitely the best it ever
has been as well as a legitimate
national championship contender.
Proving the 85-71 defeat of bas
ketball powerhouse Tennessee in
December was no fluke, Stanford
cruised to victory last night,
dominating every aspect of the
contest — offensively and defen
sively — against an excellent
squad.
Even taking into consideration
that perhaps it was an off night
for the Husky women, 40 points
are 40 points. There is no denying
that Stanford has arrived.
"Stanford played extremely
well," Washington Coach Chris
Gobrecht said. "They played as
well as I've ever seen them play."
The Cardinal just could not be
stopped. The squad converted
layup after layup, played halfcourt
ball, succeeded at pressure de
fense, forced turnovers and got in
Washington's face almost every
time it tried to take a shot.
The victory was entirely a team
effort. Showing the balanced at
tack vital to a championship
squad, nine of the team's 11
players scored and nine also
snagged rebounds. Six Cardinals
were in double figures, and two
scored 20 or more points. Four
different competitors blocked
shots.
"The game was a real compli
ment to Washington," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer. "They
brought out the best effort in us.
We played the best we have in a
number of games."
• By completely shutting down as
talented and powerful a squad as
the Huskies, the Cardinal proved
it can take on any team in the
