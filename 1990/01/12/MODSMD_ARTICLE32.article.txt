SEATTLE, Wash. — With tem
peratures barely creeping into the

year in the Pacific Northwest.

Men's Basketball

Huskies 71
Cardinal 59

So cold in fact, that even after
going inside the Hec Edmundson
Pavilion, it took the Cardinal bas
ketball team a while to warm up
last night. Stanford was stone
cold from the field for the first
33 minutes before mounting a late
charge that came up just short in
a 71-59 loss to Washington.
The Huskies outrebounded
Stanford 33-30, ran down more
loose balls and basically outplayed
the visitors.
"They dominated us," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"Absolutely and totally in every
phase of the game. We were flat;
we were scared; we were in
timidated."
Stanford had its worst offensive
half of the season to open the
game. The Cardinal scored only
18 points while shooting less than
30 percent in the first stanza
against the Huskies' soft zone.
"We fumbled the ball; we
traveled when we caught it,"
Montgomery said. "You saw it.
We were awful."
In the first half Stanford had
two dunks, two free throws and
five layups. Farther than one foot
from the hoop, the Cardinal made
only one shot, a 19-footer by
Kenny Ammann.
Stanford also went 11 minutes,
16 seconds while scoring only five
points in the first half. A three
point play on an alley-oop pass
from Paul Garrett to Deshon Win
gate for a two-handed slam cut
the score to 31-18 at the half but
the Cardinal continued to dig a
hole for itself after intermission.
Stanford trailed 55-35 with

seven minutes left before making
a final run. Using great outside
shooting and a pressing, trapping
defense for the first time in recent
memory, the Cardinal cut it to
six. Adam Keefe scored the first
six points of the run, but Dion
Brown had a steal and went coast
to-coast for a 360-degree, two
handed stuff.
Ammann hit a long three
pointer and Andrew Vlahov took
a steal all the way for a layup to
cut it to 11. After a bunch of free
throws each way, Ammann hit a
19-footer to make it 60-51.
Wingate took a loose ball in for
a layup and converted a foul shot
to cut it to six, but then the
Huskies made three free throws.
Ammann hit another long-range
bomb to cut it to 63-57 with 1:23
remaining before Washington
closed it out at the free throw line.
The Huskies hit 9-of-12 free
throws in the last five minutes
to put it away.
Forward Doug Meekins made
his second start of the year and
guard Brent Merritt made his first
and each had 18 points to lead
Washington.
Stanford was led by Keefe with
16 points on 6-of-7 shooting. Am
mann finished with 15.

"I think we were intimidated,"
Keefe said. "We weren't aggres
sive at all. We got our asses
kicked."
For the game the Cardinal shot
.373 to the Huskies' .522. The
game was also marred by poor
officiating in both directions. For
the Cardinal, Vlahov fouled out
and five other players finished
with four fouls. Montgomery also
picked up a technical in the second
half.
Keefe, who is scoring 20 points
a game and shooting 64 percent
from the floor, took only seven
shots. Iwo or three of them were
put-backs on offensive rebounds,"
he said. "I think we were just so
passive that guys weren't looking
for gaps to throw a solid pass."
Stanford now has two days to
get ready for its second Pac-10
road contest. The Cardinal meets
Washington State at 4 p.m. Sun
day afternoon in Pullman, Wash.
"Confidence is hard on the
road," Montgomery said "We
didn't get a lot of help."
Keefe thinks the team can
bounce back. "I think most of it's
a mental thing," he said. "Ob
viously we aren't going to change
our talent. It's just a matter of
coming out with some heart."
