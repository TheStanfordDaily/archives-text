# Injured swimmers eye Michigan

Ideally, when a squad ventures into
the territory of an undefeated arch
rival, it needs to have every gun ready
to fire.
Unfortunately for the Stanford
men's swimming, the traveling team
headed for Ann Arbor to challenge
Michigan this weekend is missing a
few of its top guns. The Cardinal
squad will be forced to fight with only
75 percent of a team which has just
completed an intense Christmas train
ing period.
"Unfortunately, we are unable to
take a full team, partially because of

injuries but mostly because of ex
penses," Coach Skip Kenney said.
"Without sacrificing any training,
we'd love to come away from this
meet with a win. We've beaten them
at NCAAs but we're 0-2 against them
in dual meets."
Ann Arbor has not been friendly to
visitors in the past decade. The Wol
verines have won every dual meet
there since the 1980-81 season, and
Wolverine Coach Jon Urbanchek,
while compiling a 55-2 dual meet
record, has never seen one of his
squads lose in Canham Auditorium.
"The meet has shaped up exactly
like last year's meet," Kenney said.
"Whoever wins the medley relay will

most likely win the meet."
Last year, Michigan travelled to
deGuerre Pool and swam by the Car
dinal 60-53 in Stanford's opening
meet. Michigan overtook Stanford
when the Wolverines' medley relay
team won the final race of the day.
The Cardinal, coming off of a dual
meet victory over UC-Santa Barbara
last Saturday, is struggling just to get
back into competitive form. Sopho

ing from an injured shoulder.
"Everyone is on the road to
recovery," freshman standout
Erik Maurer said. "We expect
everyone who goes to swim as
well as they always do."
Maurer has extra incentive to
perform well this weekend. Orig
inally from nearby Winnetka, 111.,
he has many friends swimming
for the Wolverines. Mauer will be
shooting to improve his times in
the 50, 100, and 200 freestyle in

order to qualify for NCAAs. He
has posted the second fastest time
on the team in each of these
events.
"Michigan was my second
choice," Maurer said. "It would
be a special thrill for me if we
can pull it off and beat them at
home."
Three Cardinal swimmers have
already qualified for NCAAs.
Rouse has recorded sub-standard
times in the 100 and 200 back
stroke, senior John Witchel has
qualified in the 1650 freestyle,
and freshman Chas Morton has
reached the necessary time in the
400 individual medley.

Today, the meet will begin with
all of the events that are not
usually included in a dual meet.
Saturday, Michigan and Stanford
will square off in the normal dual
meet events.
"The injuries have set us back
a little," Kenney said. "But every
one has been working hard to get
back in shape and I expect us to
swim really well."
The swimmers unable to make
the trip to the Midwest will com
pete over the weekend at the Cal
Invitational in Berkeley. Next Fri
day, the whole team will return
to deGuerre Pool to take on UC-
Davis.
