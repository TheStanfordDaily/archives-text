# Injured swimmers eye Michigan

Ideally, when a squad ventures into
the territory of an undefeated arch
rival, it needs to have every gun ready
to fire.
Unfortunately for the Stanford
men's swimming, the traveling team
headed for Ann Arbor to challenge
Michigan this weekend is missing a
few of its top guns. The Cardinal
squad will be forced to fight with only
75 percent of a team which has just
completed an intense Christmas train
ing period.
"Unfortunately, we are unable to
take a full team, partially because of

injuries but mostly because of ex
penses," Coach Skip Kenney said.
"Without sacrificing any training,
we'd love to come away from this
meet with a win. We've beaten them
at NCAAs but we're 0-2 against them
in dual meets."
Ann Arbor has not been friendly to
visitors in the past decade. The Wol
verines have won every dual meet
there since the 1980-81 season, and
Wolverine Coach Jon Urbanchek,
while compiling a 55-2 dual meet
record, has never seen one of his
squads lose in Canham Auditorium.
"The meet has shaped up exactly
like last year's meet," Kenney said.
"Whoever wins the medley relay will

most likely win the meet."
Last year, Michigan travelled to
deGuerre Pool and swam by the Car
dinal 60-53 in Stanford's opening
meet. Michigan overtook Stanford
when the Wolverines' medley relay
team won the final race of the day.
The Cardinal, coming off of a dual
meet victory over UC-Santa Barbara
last Saturday, is struggling just to get
back into competitive form. Sopho

Because of injury, Illness and expense, the men's swimming team will be shorthanded in Michigan this weekend.
The Wolverines have not lost a home dual meet in over eight years.
