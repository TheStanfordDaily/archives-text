# Johnson won't be back
## Card quarterback commits to baseball full-time 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
After almost four years of splitting time
between the Stanford football and baseball
teams, quarterback Brian Johnson has
decided not to return to school for the 1990
football season.
In a statement released yesterday,
Johnson said he would forgo his final year
of eligibility to concentrate on playing base
ball in the New York Yankees organization.
Johnson hit .361 in 17 games as a catcher
last summer for Class A Sarasota (Fla.).

"It was time to go, time to move on,"
said Johnson, who was drafted by the
Yankees in the 14th round of last June's
amateur draft. "I want to be a professional
baseball player. I don't want to be a pro
fessional football player."
Still, Johnson admitted "this was a tough
decision. ... I really do enjoy playing foot
ball."
Unfortunately, football was not kind to
Johnson in 1989. He missed almost half
the season with injuries to his right —
throwing — shoulder. He has
since had surgery twice. "My
shoulder feels great," he said.
"There won't be any long-term
damage."
The fear of reinjuring the shoul
der did not loom large in his de
cision, said Johnson. "It (the in
jury) plays a certain role, those
things always do," he said. "But
I just figured it's time to seek the
next level, to see how I'll do."
That's good news for the
Yankees, who Johnson said were
"very understanding of my situ
ation here at Stanford. While al
ways being assertive of what they
would like me to do, they have
been flexible toward me as well."
However, flexibility has its
limits. The Yankees have paid for
Johnson to attend school this year,
because signing a pro contract not
only made him ineligible to play
college baseball, it meant he was
not allowed to receive scholarship
money for any sport. And during
the football season, sources close
to Johnson had said the Yankees
were putting pressure on him to
give up his gridiron career.
Johnson denied any Yankee in
volvement in his decision. In an
interview last night, he said,
"Ever since they drafted me,

'It's time to move
on.'
— Brian Johnson

they've said they would rather
have me just play baseball, but
they left it up to me."
As for speculation that the
Yankees might have brought up
the subject in contract renegotia
tions, Johnson said his contract
did not run out until after the
upcoming season.
Giving up football won't be
much of a sacrifice, though, be
cause Johnson will be graduating
on schedule in June (he has one
season of eligibility left because
he was redshirted in 1986). To
play in the fall, he would have
had to either: (1) stretch out his
remaining courses in order to not
graduate, or (2) enroll in graduate
school.
Since he is only a few units
short of a degree in Political Sci
ence, not graduating didn't make
sense, and graduate school can al
ways wait — especially while the
Yankees are willing to pay him
handsomely. "I will be putting my
graduate school plans on hold
right now," Johnson said, "and
simply concentrate on my baseball
career with the Yankees and see
what happens."
