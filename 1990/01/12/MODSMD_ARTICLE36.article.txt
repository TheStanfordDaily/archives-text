With a near upset of powerhouse Notre
Dame under its belt, the wrestling team
travels to UC-Davis for a three-pronged
weekend, taking on Air Force and Chico
State in dual meets today before competing
in the Aggie Invitational on Saturday.
Led by 177-pounder Steve Buddie and
190-pounder Ron Perry, both victors in
last week's Doc Petersen Open, Stanford
is favored to win its third-straight Aggie
Invite. The progress of senior Josh Lisle
in the 134 lbs. class gives Stanford an extra
weapon as well.
"Josh has had big jumps in confidence
this past week and definitely has a shot
at winning his first tournament Saturday,"
Coach Chris Horpel said.
Numerically not a regular meet, the In
vitational allows each squad to bring 15,
as opposed to the usual 10 wrestlers, giving
five Cardinal second-teamers an opportu
nity to compete.
Although the meet consists of a relatively
small field of nine schools, the addition of
first-year competitor Air Force gives the
match an extra degree of difficulty. While
not ranked, the Falcons consistently qualify
individuals for the national finals. In ad
diton, the Cardinal has two question marks
in its line-up. Starters Matt Topham (158
lbs.) and Mark Graham (167 lbs) both
sprained knees in last weekend's invita

tional and are still questionable.
Last season, two wrestlers won their
classes â€” Steve Yarborough and Buddie.
Lyle placed second and 10 other competi
tors placed as the Stanford squad won the
whole tournament. Even with the injuries,
expectations are similar for this weekend.
According to Horpel, tournaments are
actually more important than dual meets
for the overall success of the team. Al
though most viewers judge a squad's season
by its dual meet record, the matches ac
tually count for nothing other than prac
tice. The two-day Pacific 10 Conference
tournament at the conclusion of the season
solely determines Stanford's standing for
the season and for advancement to the
NCAA level.
"The level of competition (at Davis) is
low compared with the Pac-10 Champion
ships, but this meet will be another way
to evaluate progress of technique and con
ditioning to help point out where the
wrestlers need work on skills," Horpel said.
Friday, the Cardinal takes on both Air
Force and Chico State in regulation 10-man
dual meets. With a 3-2 one-on-one record,
inlcuding a 59-0 thrashing of the College
of Notre Dame, Stanford is favored against
both squads. Although the Cardinal has
not wrestled the Wildcats directly for a few
years, Stanford was victorious the last time
the squads met in a dual meet. The Car
dinal and the Falcons have never met head
to-head.
