# Stanford to justify No. 1
## Spikers open season with practice tourney, Davis 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Imagine . . . what would the Bulls be
without Jordan? The Browns without
Kosar? The Lakers without Magic? The
Olympics without the Soviets? The Kings
without the Great One?
A lot like, many preseason doubters
would have suggested, the Stanford men's
volleyball team without Olympic gold
medalist Scott Fortune.
The early performance of the Fortune
less 1990 squad, however, has effectively
squelched such misdirected concerns and
has left an impressive imprint in the minds
of witnesses to its preseason play. In a
furious flurry of preseason heroics, the
team toppled defending NCAA champion
UCLA and streaked through four consecu
tive victories against the highly-touted,
third-ranked University of Hawaii.
The Cardinal will attempt to continue
its victory streak and further justify its
No. 1 preseason ranking by the NCAA and
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion in practice matches this Saturday and
in the regular season home opener against
UC-Davis Monday.
The exhibition tournament tomorrow at
Burnham Pavilion will feature the 1989
national club volleyball champion Califor
nia, fourth-ranked Long Beach State and
two split-squad teams from Stanford. In
what fashion the Cardinal squad will be
divided has yet to be decided by Coach
Fred Sturm.
The results of the practice tournament
will not count toward actual regular season
standings. Sturm, nevertheless, maintains
a profound interest in the event for its
valuable ability to serve as a "progress
report" on the team. Specifically, Sturm
and his staff hope to evaluate the players
in specific line-up combinations.
Regarding the team's opening match
Monday at 7 p.m., Sturm openly concedes
he knows nothing of the UC-Davis team
but relishes the opportunity "to get to know
ourselves and to see some new faces."
Barring the unexpected, the Cardinal will
take the floor against Davis with five of
six returning starters from last year's
NCAA runner-up team as well as sopho
more Dave Goss, who redshirted last
season. Six-foot-five Dan Hanan, a first
team All-America and All-WTVA athlete last
season, leads the returning quintet of
starters as the consensus favorite for na
tional player of the year honors.
Finishing second in the country to su
perstar teammate Scott Fortune in kill
average — while setting a school record
.416 hitting percentage and 131 blocks,
Hanan presently commands the uncom

promised attention of opposing players.
Hanan wili be accompanied by the pro
minent Blackman brothers. Duncan, last
year's national freshman of the year, will
continue his hitting duties and will be set
by brother Parker whose offensive direction
sparked a school-record .316 hitting per
centage last year.
Outside hitter John Alstrom, plagued for
much of last season by a shoulder injury,
will return after sporting an impressive
.321 hitting percentage. In Sturm's estima
tion, he will add a critical dimension in his
innate ability to make "a lot of things
happen with his blocking and digging."
Senior Craig Forsyth will start as the
middle blocker opposite Hanan and will
offer a menacing combination of hitting
and blocking. Forsyth had 141 kills last
season.
Dave Goss will occupy the opening left
by Fortune's graduation and will for the
first time be able to display his impressive
vertical leap before Cardinal crowds. The
lOth-ranked Fab 50 player after his senior
year in high school can reach a height of
11 feet 4 inches.
In addition to the starters, the Cardinal
boasts a host of multi-talented reserves
whose collective role on the team is im
measurable. Doug Walquist, Mike Lowe,
Chris Wrede, and Ryan Moos all started
at times last year and promise to pose
considerable challenges to the established
starting six. John Bezmalinovic and John
Hribar will become eligible after redshirt
ing in 1989 and Ryan O' Hara is expected
to compete vigorously for the setter posi
tion.
Jimmy Klein, a prominent figure on the
football team and brother of All-America
woman's volleyball player Kristin, will join
standout setter recruit Jimmy Blackman
as two of Sturm's most celebrated freshman
prospects.
Sturm may also be eagerly awaiting the
conclusion of the basketball season at
which time he will acquire the services of
multi-sport sensation Adam Keefe, who
trained with the U.S. National team, and
Paul Garrett, a gifted middle blocker.
Despite the noted loss of Fortune, Sturm
cheerily maintains that the dominant, load
of offense the Olympian carried will this
year be more evenly distributed among his
multi-faceted attack, a change that has thus
far done little to affect the team's position
in national ranks.
During the array of matches this holiday
weekend, Sturm intends to begin the pur
suit of his primary priority this season, —
to simply be the "most improved" team in
the country, while effectively extinguishing
any remaining doubt in his squad's ability.
