# Jorgensen brings more Seoul to swim team; squad preps for Michigan
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
For competitive swimmers the
difference between winning and
losing is usually measured in
hundredths of a second.
In one of the biggest races of
Janel Jorgensen's life, however,
the difference was about two
weeks.
In the summer of 1988, things
were going pretty well for Jorgen
sen, now a freshman here. She
had just completed her junior year
of high school in Ridgefield, Conn.
And better still, she was swim
ming fast and felt she had a good
shot of earning a plane ticket to
Seoul at the upcoming Olympic
Trials.
She was going to swim three
events, and in her best, the 100-
meter butterfly, Jorgensen
thought she could finish in the
top two and make the U.S. Olym
pic team.
"Everyone's really competitive
at that level," she said. "You have
to go into a meet like that with
a good mindset. I went in and was
really hopeful."
She swam well enough in her
preliminary heat to make the
final, so she and seven others
would vie for the two spots on
the Olympic team in that event.
After touching the wall in the
final that night, she looked at the
scoreboard:
"One: Angel Myers. Two: Mary
T. Meagher. Three: Janel Jorgen
sen.
Defeat. Close, but not close
enough.
"I had the 200 IM and the 200

fly still to go, but, after that race
was over, I just wanted to go
home," she said. "I was real dis
sappointed in how the whole thing
ended."
"I remember watching the
whole team line up (at the end of
the meet) and I was like, 'Great.'
Ever since I was little I wanted
to be in the Olympics. I was so
close."
Instead of training to go to the
Games, Jorgensen went back
home. "It was like I didn't want
to be near water," she said. "I
guess I counted on taking a three
month break."
Two weeks later, she got a call
from Richard Quick, the Olympic
coach. "I was home relaxing when
Richard called," she said. "He was
asking all these weird questions
and I was just sitting there
answering them. At first, I
thought he called me for recruit
ing because he just took the Stan
ford job.
"Then he said, 'Are you sitting
down,' and I said, 'Yeah,' and he
told me."
What he told her was that
Myers' drug test was positive for
steroids. Thus, Myers, who came
out of nowhere to win three events
at the Trials, would be removed
from the squad if the results were
verified. "[Quick] said, 'You're
flying to L.A. tomorrow morning,"
Jorgensen said.
There, Jorgensen and Jill
Sterkel, who was in the same po
sition, were told to wait for the
results to be checked. "They said
we'd know Friday night," Jorgen
sen said. "Then they said Satur
day at noon for sure. Then

Saturday night. They finally told
us Sunday night."
The results satisfied U.S.
Swimming enough to remove
Myers from the squad despite the
fact that Myers continued to insist
it was birth-control pills not pro
hibited steriods.
Jorgensen thus had two weeks
before the Olympics to get into
top form after not having been in
a pool since the Trials. "It took
a while to get mentally and phys
ically back," she said. "After the
Triads I was so down and then I
had to get back up again." Jor
gensen did get back up, however,
and felt optimistic entering the
Games.
"I'd been doing great in work
outs leading up to it — better
than before Trials — so that
helped me mentally," she said.
"No one really expected anything
of me. That helped me too."
Despite "whiffing" her start,
which she had recently changed,
she took fifth in the 100-meter
butterfly, her only individual race.
And since she placed higher than
Meagher, she would swim the but
terfly leg on the U.S. 400-meter

medley relay team.
There, Jorgensen, Beth Barr,
Tracey McFarlane and Mary
Wayte took the silver behind the
East Germans.
From down and out in Connec
ticut to an Olympic silver medal
in only a month.
"I was real happy," she said. "I
did my lifetime best. It was the
first time I'd broken a minute."
Jorgensen then found it's often
as hard to get going after a success
as it is after a defeat. "All last
year, I had a real hard time get
ting motivated," she said. "My
coach would talk about [the Pan-
Pacific Championships] and I'd be
like, 'Big deal.' But as the season
went on and 1 started swimming
again, I got better."
When it came time to choose a
college, Stanford was the clear
winner. "I knew once I came here
(to visit) I wanted to go here,"
she said.
She found adjusting to Stanford
easier than expected and has also
fit right in with the top-ranked
Cardinal swim team, the defend
ing NCAA Champions. In the
team's first meet Saturday, a win
over UC-Santa Barbara, Jorgen
sen won both the 200-yard and
500 freestyles, despite the fact
that those are not her best events.
Jorgensen will likely return to
swimming the butterfly, 100 free
style and/or 200 individual medley
today and tomorrow. Stanford
puts its 1-0 record on the line
agianst No. 6 Michigan in Ann
Arbor and Jorgensen will be
counted on to score.
And despite having a silver
medal, Jorgensen doesn't think
she's done yet. "Obviously our
main goal is to take the title again
at NCAAs," she said. "Over the
next four years I'd like to break
the American record in the 100
fly. I'd like to win an individual
title this year — or at least have
fun and do the best I can ."
