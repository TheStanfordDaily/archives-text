# Women gymnasts look to leap over Boise State
## 
### Patrick Tower 
Breck Greenwood will look to
get his head coaching career —
as well as the 1990 Stanford wom
en's gymnastics season — started
on the right foot when the Car
dinal visits the Broncos of Boise
State this Saturday in the season
opener.
"I haven't seen most of the gym
nasts in competition, so I'm using
this meet to see what they look
like. Of course, I'm still trying to
win the meet," the first-year Car
dinal coach said. "It's better to
start my career 1-0 as opposed to
0-1."
Greenwood is making his head
coaching debut after 11 seasons
as an assistant coach at Cal State-
Fullerton and Penn State. During
that period, his teams went to the
NCAA Championships nine times.
Also seeing the gymnasts in
competition for the first time will
be Asst. Coach Penney Hauschild,
who adds, "This meet is basically
to see where we are in our prep
aration."
In addition to Greenwood and
Hauschild, two gymnasts will be
making their first appearances in
Stanford uniforms.

Freshman Erin McCann will be
debuting in the all-around, while
her classmate, walk-on Danielle
Leone, will be competing in the
bars, beam, and floor exercise.
Joining McCann in the all
around competition will be senior
Dina Amoroso and junior Jennifer
Bloom.
Sophomore Denise Villars will
compete in the beam and floor
exercise, senior Susan Banta in
the bars and vault, and senior
Becky Ashton in the vault. In ad
dition, Alyssa Solomon will travel
with the team and may see action
on the beam.
"This meet will give us a better
idea of what we need to do to be
ready for a meet," Greenwood
said.
The Broncos are in a situation
similar to that of the Cardinal.
"Boise State lost four seniors, and
they have a lot of freshmen, so
they also don't know what kind
of competitive team they will
have," Greenwood said.
"It should be a good meet —
both teams should be at about
the same spot in preparation,"
Hauschild added.
The Cardinal's next meet is Fri
day at the Husky Classic.
