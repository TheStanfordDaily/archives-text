## Three devices removed from Shopping Center 
### Ed Palattella Staff writer 
Three incendiary devices were found yes
terday in two Stanford Shopping Center
department stores, apparently the latest in
a series of related bomb scares that have
struck various Bay Area department stores
since November.
The devices were found in both the
Macy's and Sak's Fifth Avenue stores,
bringing the total of rccent bomb scares
at the shopping center to four. On Nov.
23, an incendiary device ignited in Nord
strom department store. The fire was put
out immediately.
A similar device also was found yesterday
afternoon at the Macy's Union Square store
in downtown San Francisco.
There were no injuries or damages in
any of the incidents, said Ron Wolter, as
sistant special agent at U.S. Bureau of Al
cohol, Tobacco and Firearms in San
Francisco.
Incendiary devices, unlike bombs, are de
signed to start fires without exploding.

There have been eight recent such scares
in Bay Area department stores, including
yesterday's incidents, Wolter said. The
other scares — all of which caused no fires,
damage or injuries — occurred Nov. 25 at
I. Magnin in downtown San Francisco, Dec.
14 at the Union Square Macy's and Dec.
17 at the Emporium in downtown San
Francisco.
In yesterday's incidents at the Stanford
Shopping Center, Palo AJto police received
a call at 11:37 a.m. concerning a small
package found in the Macy's third-floor
homewares section, according to a state
ment released yesterday by Sgt. Trudy
Eitel.
She said the police identified the package
as an incendiary device and asked for as
sistance from the federal firearms office,
the Palo Alto Fire Department and the
bomb squad of the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Department.
The device was removed after the
sheriffs department examined its contents
