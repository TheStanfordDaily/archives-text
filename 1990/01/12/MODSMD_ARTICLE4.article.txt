# Department store bomb scares
## Three devices removed from Shopping Center 
### Ed Palattella Staff writer 
Three incendiary devices were found yes
terday in two Stanford Shopping Center
department stores, apparently the latest in
a series of related bomb scares that have
struck various Bay Area department stores
since November.
The devices were found in both the
Macy's and Sak's Fifth Avenue stores,
bringing the total of rccent bomb scares
at the shopping center to four. On Nov.
23, an incendiary device ignited in Nord
strom department store. The fire was put
out immediately.
A similar device also was found yesterday
afternoon at the Macy's Union Square store
in downtown San Francisco.
There were no injuries or damages in
any of the incidents, said Ron Wolter, as
sistant special agent at U.S. Bureau of Al
cohol, Tobacco and Firearms in San
Francisco.
Incendiary devices, unlike bombs, are de
signed to start fires without exploding.

There have been eight recent such scares
in Bay Area department stores, including
yesterday's incidents, Wolter said. The
other scares — all of which caused no fires,
damage or injuries — occurred Nov. 25 at
I. Magnin in downtown San Francisco, Dec.
14 at the Union Square Macy's and Dec.
17 at the Emporium in downtown San
Francisco.
In yesterday's incidents at the Stanford
Shopping Center, Palo AJto police received
a call at 11:37 a.m. concerning a small
package found in the Macy's third-floor
homewares section, according to a state
ment released yesterday by Sgt. Trudy
Eitel.
She said the police identified the package
as an incendiary device and asked for as
sistance from the federal firearms office,
the Palo Alto Fire Department and the
bomb squad of the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Department.
The device was removed after the
sheriffs department examined its contents
with X-rays.
About 45 minutes later, Eitel
said, a second device was discov
ered in the third floor of Sak's
and was also removed after X
rays.
The third scare came at approx
imately 10:15 last night, when a
Macy's security worker found an
other device on the store's third
floor, approximately 20 feet from
where the first device was found
earlier that day, said Kathy
McKenna, supervisor of the Palo
Alto police department. The bomb
squad of the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Department was still
removing the bomb at press time
last night.
Workers at the Stanford Shop

'All the devices ap
pear to be related, but
I cannot definitely say
they are the same un
til after the investiga
tion/

ping Center were checking all the
department stores late last night
for any other devices.
During yesterday afternoon's
scares, only the third floor of
Macy's was evacuated; last night,
the handful of workers in Macy's
were told to leave the building.
The device at the Union Square
Macy's was also removed without
incident yesterday afternoon, Wol
ter said.
The San Francisco Police De

partment's arson squad and the
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
bureau are currently examining
the devices found yesterday after
noon to see if they were made by
the same person or group who
planted the other devices.
"All the devices appear to be
related," Wolter said, "but I can
not definitely say they are the
same until after the investiga
tion." There are no suspects in
any of the scares.
Officials at the Stanford Macy's
and Sak's said the stores will be
open for business today.
"I feel assured that there is no
immediate danger," said Sak's
General Manager Pat Huntington
yesterday."It seems that the
scares that have happened are de
signed not to be injurious; they
seem to be meant more as a dis
ruption."
