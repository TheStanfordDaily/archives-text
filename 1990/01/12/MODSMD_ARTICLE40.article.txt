# Pi Phi case sparks evaluation of party guidelines
## 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
The recent decision that the Pi
Beta Phi sorority was not account
able for the actions of certain in
toxicated individuals at an
October party will not release fra
ternities and sororities from re
sponsibility for their party guests,
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes said yesterday.
"Generally, (decisions] depend
on the circumstances of individual
incidents. In this case, the sorority
did all they could to meet Uni
versity [party] guidelines," he
said.
His report of the investigation
of the party states that the
sorority met the responsibility of
creating "a safe and healthful en
vironment that promotes respon
sible behavior" by using a theme
and sober monitors and by hiring
outside persons to watch the door
and to bartend.
Guilty until proven innocent?
"I think the whole sorority is
happy to be off probation," said
Pyeatt Gravely, Pi Phi president.
She added, however, that she
believes it was unfair that all the
sorority's privileges were taken
away during the investigation,
since they were not found liable
for the incidents.
"I think it would be more fair
if you were innocent until proven
guilty, instead of the other way
around," Gravely said. "But I
guess that's just the way the sys
tem works."
She said that the investigation
did take a long time, partly be
cause it was very thorough. She
said she also realized that the
earthquake partly caused the
delay.
Intersorority Council President
Pam Simpson, however, called the
length of the investigation

"ridiculous."
"We need to fix the system in
order to have a way to conduct
faster investigations," she said.
Simpson agreed with the find
ings of the report.
"It appears the Pi Phis did as
much as they could to prevent the
incidents that occurred," she said.
Role of dorm parties unclear
Hughes' report places some
blame for the intoxication of the
involved individuals on the Serra
and Twain dorms, which held par
ties they attended before they
reached the Pi Phi party.
"The individuals were intox
icated when they arrived at the
(Pi Phi) party," Hughes said.
The report states that there is
a "strong need to examine the
issue of small and large parties
taking place on campus involving
misuse of alcohol and sponsored
by non-Greek letter organiza
tions."
The Serra and Twain parties
did not comply with the Residen
tial Education alcohol guidelines,
the report states, due to "the
amount and type of alcohol served,
non-availability of EANABs, and
at least in one instance involving
the non-availability of food."
Hughes said he met this week
with the resident fellows of both
dorms, and they are "coming out
with an addendum that clarifies"
the section of the report concern
ing non-Greek houses. He
declined further comment until
that statement is released.
Denis Phillips, the Twain resi
dent fellow, said that he and the
Serra RFs believed the report con
tained certain inaccuracies. He
said that Hughes agreed when
presented with evidence and will
correct the mistakes in the ad
dendum.
"There was no sort of wild party
in Twain," Phillips said. "Just

three or four people having a beer
in their room."
He added that there had been
a large party in Sei ra, but accord
ing to all accounts food and
EANABS were available.
The Serra RFs could not be
reached for comment last night.
New party guidelines?
In addition to these findings,
the report makes recommenda
tions to avoid similar situations
in the future.
Hughes advised the employ
ment of bartenders and of other
party personnel who are not af
filiated with the hosting group.
He also suggested establishing a
"limited access" drinking area set
apart from the rest of the party
that only persons over 21 could
enter. Alcoholic beverages would
not be permitted outside the area.
Hughes said he will submit
these recommendations to the
University alcohol task force.
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Todd Ortega said the IFC
will consider the recommenda
tions. He added that the IFC plans
to "look into their overall party
guidelines this quarter."
Ortega said the limited access
drinking area "sounds like a rea
sonable idea" and that he knows
it has been successful at other
institutions. Some fraternities
may implement the policy inde
pendent of the IFC, he said.
Phi Delts: Still waiting
Parker Blackman, Phi Delta
Theta president, said his frater
nity, like the Pi Phis, took the
precautions of using sober
monitors as well as a theme at a
September party after which a
student was hit by a truck. The
fraternity has been suspended
since the accident, pending a de
cision from the Dean of Student
Affairs Office.

Blackman was reluctant to spec
ulate whether the decision in the
Pi Phi case could affect the ruling
on the Phi Delt incident.
Hughes said that he is waiting
for a decision on the Phi Delt
incident from Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons, who is cur
rently "reviewing the submitted
draft" of the findings of Hughes'
investigation.
Lyons said last night that a de
cision will probably be released in
about three weeks.
"What's complicated about the
Phi Delt case is that there's a
history to it,"he explained. He
noted a recurrence of similar
events in recent years.
"I have to study that history
some more," Lyons said.
"The Pi Phi case was pretty
straightforward. The Phi Delt
case, however, is not a simple
analysis," he added.
Blackmun said that the Phi
Delts are "totally dismayed"
about the the length of time it
has taken the University to reach
a decision. Hughes submitted the
original report to Student Affairs
in October and a revised version
in November.
Lyons admitted that "the fact
finding in this case did take a
little longer than usual."
He said he feels badly the in
vestigation has taken so long, but
a combination of the complexity
of the case and the earthquake
hampered proceedings.
"In the aftermath of the earth
quake, some things got put aside
and this was one of them," Lyons
said.
Ortega said yesterday that he
hopes the lengthy investigation of
the incident will not be
"precedent-setting." He said he
thinks the University should
apologize to involved parties for
the delay in reaching a decision.
