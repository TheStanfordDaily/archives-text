# S. African seeks education in mediation
## 
### Lena Slachmuijlder Staff writer 
In 1987, as Stanford's Board of
Trustees extolled the merits of
"investment responsibility" to top
corporate leaders, two executives
raised a question: What was the
University doing, besides voting
on South Africa-related share
holder resolutions, to respond to
the needs of black South Africans?
This challenge would be the
seed of Stanford's involvement in
a new program enabling black
South African professionals to
come to the United States for the
special training they need to effect
change in their communities.
The Career Development Fel
lowship Program for Black South
Africans, now in its third year,
was initiated by South African ed
ucational organizations and a con
sortium of West Coast univer
sities. Corporate grants helped the
program in its initial stages.
Since the program's inception,
Stanford has hosted about 10 fel
lows. Petrus Mkize, a lawyer from
South Africa, is one of two fel
lowship recipients this year. The
second will arrive in March.
Although Mkize practices gen
eral litigation in both civil and
criminal cases in South Africa,
his true area of interest is in con
flict negotiation and mediation.
"We can't specialize in South
Africa," says Mkize, who is en
rolled in a nine-month program
at the Law School.
Mkize is one of few black South
African lawyers, and worked his
way through law school by alter

nating years of working with
years being a student. Stanford
provides him with the "luxury"
of spending days on end in the
library.
Mkize describes the South
African legal system as very
"traditional and adversarial." He
aims to return to South Africa
and establish a mediation center
where, he says, "people can come
with a complaint, and the dispute
can be settled out of court."
Currently, conflict negotiation
and mediation are only applied in
labor disputes in South Africa and
are virtually unheard of in other
spheres of law, such as divorce.
"In divorce, the problem is solved
with a winner and a loser," Mkize
explains, "and then the loser is
dissatisfied and won't pay the
support."
To gain the knowledge to es
tablish a mediation center, Mkize
supplements his classwork and ac
ademic research with extensive
visits to community legal assis
tance centers that will serve as a
model for his center.
"This kind of opportunity is ab
solutely unavailable for black
South Africans in South Africa,"
says Ned Harvey, the director of
Stanford's Overseas Resource
Center who assists in the admin
istration of the program.
Other members of the consor
tium include the University of
California system, the University
of Washington and the USC, who
select their fellows through the
Educational Opportunities Coun
cil. The council is a South African
based organization, led by

'The classroom is all
theory,' says Mzike. 'It
is with the poor
people where media
tion is being applied.'

Archbishop Desmond Tutu, which
fields applicants for various schol
arship and fellowship opportuni
ties abroad.
Once fellows are selected in
South Africa, the universities are
responsible for finding faculty
mentors with interests similar to
those of the fellows. The program
is primarily funded by the uni
versities. Stanford has used
$100,000 from its general discre
tionary fund since 1987 toward
subsidizing the fellows.
Because the universities do not
directly make the selections, ac
cording to Harvey, often the fel
lows do not know what to expect
once in the United States. Black
South Africans rarely achieve the
financial status needed to travel
overseas, and for many, coming
to Stanford is their first taste of
the world beyond South Africa.
"They come here with a my
thology about America," Harvey
says,"and then they see that we
also have a lot of problems, and
that in practice blacks and whites
are not necessarily treated equal
v
For Mkize, it is precisely in the
poorer local neighborhoods where
he is being most valuably ed

ucated. "The classroom is all the
ory," he says."It is with the poor
people where [mediation] is being
applied."
In fact, Harvey says, in many
cases the fellows have discovered
more relevant knowledge to their
goals outside the classroom. Past
examples of this include a teacher
who worked in the Bing Nursery
School and a community leader
who learned fund-raising tech
niques from the Haas Center for
Public Service last summer.
Mkize applauds the develop
ment of such programs aimed at
bringing black South Africans
abroad for specialization in their
line of work. Although such op
portunities are clearly not long
term solutions, Mkize says that
of all South Africans, blacks are
the most educationally disadvan
taged.
The United States should divest
from South Africa, he says,"and
then reinvest with the blacks. Ed
ucation is the perfect way to do
that."
The program is walking a fine
financial line, and the universities
are seeking outside support. The
total costs for each recipient are
near $20,000, and the original
budget allotment is running dry.
Harvey hopes that there will be
more private funding in the fu
ture, such as an initial $35,000
sum donated by Chevron.
Stanford also participates in the
South African Education Project,
along with many other univer
sities, which recruits black South
Africans who wish to matriculate
for undergraduate and graduate
degrees at Stanford.

is primarily funded by the uni

$100,000 from its general discre

subsidizing the fellows.
Because the universities do not
directly make the selections, ac
cording to Harvey, often the fel
lows do not know what to expect
once in the United States. Black
South Africans rarely achieve the
financial status needed to travel
overseas, and for many, coming
to Stanford is their first taste of
the world beyond South Africa.

says,"and then they see that we

For Mkize, it is precisely in the
poorer local neighborhoods where
he is being most valuably ed

ucated. "The classroom is all the
ory," he says."It is with the poor
people where [mediation] is being
applied."
In fact, Harvey says, in many
cases the fellows have discovered
more relevant knowledge to their
goals outside the classroom. Past
examples of this include a teacher
who worked in the Bing Nursery
School and a community leader
who learned fund-raising tech
niques from the Haas Center for
Public Service last summer.
Mkize applauds the develop
ment of such programs aimed at
bringing black South Africans
abroad for specialization in their
line of work. Although such op
portunities are clearly not long
term solutions, Mkize says that
of all South Africans, blacks are
the most educationally disadvan
taged.
The United States should divest
from South Africa, he says,"and
then reinvest with the blacks. Ed
ucation is the perfect way to do
that."
The program is walking a fine
financial line, and the universities
are seeking outside support. The
total costs for each recipient are
near $20,000, and the original
budget allotment is running dry.
Harvey hopes that there will be
more private funding in the fu
ture, such as an initial $35,000
sum donated by Chevron.
Stanford also participates in the
South African Education Project,
along with many other univer

Africans who wish to matriculate
for undergraduate and graduate
degrees at Stanford.

Petrus Mkize, an attorney involved in the Stanford Career Devel
opment Fellowship Program for Black South Africans, Is studying
litigation and conflict negotiation in hopes of increasing the avail
ability of such services in his native country.
In 1987, as Stanford's Board of
Trustees extolled the merits of
"investment responsibility" to top
corporate leaders, two executives
raised a question: What was the
University doing, besides voting
on South Africa-related share
holder resolutions, to respond to
the needs of black South Africans?
This challenge would be the
seed of Stanford's involvement in
a new program enabling black
South African professionals to
come to the United States for the
special training they need to effect
change in their communities.
The Career Development Fel
lowship Program for Black South
Africans, now in its third year,
was initiated by South African ed
ucational organizations and a con
sortium of West Coast univer
sities. Corporate grants helped the
program in its initial stages.
Since the program's inception,
Stanford has hosted about 10 fel
lows. Petrus Mkize, a lawyer from
South Africa, is one of two fel
lowship recipients this year. The
second will arrive in March.
Although Mkize practices gen
eral litigation in both civil and
criminal cases in South Africa,
his true area of interest is in con
flict negotiation and mediation.
"We can't specialize in South
Africa," says Mkize, who is en
rolled in a nine-month program
at the Law School.
Mkize is one of few black South
African lawyers, and worked his
way through law school by alter

nating years of working with
years being a student. Stanford
provides him with the "luxury"
of spending days on end in the
library.
Mkize describes the South
African legal system as very
"traditional and adversarial." He
aims to return to South Africa
and establish a mediation center
where, he says, "people can come
with a complaint, and the dispute
can be settled out of court."
Currently, conflict negotiation
and mediation are only applied in
labor disputes in South Africa and
are virtually unheard of in other
spheres of law, such as divorce.
"In divorce, the problem is solved
with a winner and a loser," Mkize
explains, "and then the loser is
dissatisfied and won't pay the
support."
To gain the knowledge to es
tablish a mediation center, Mkize
supplements his classwork and ac
ademic research with extensive
visits to community legal assis
tance centers that will serve as a
model for his center.
"This kind of opportunity is ab
solutely unavailable for black
South Africans in South Africa,"
says Ned Harvey, the director of
Stanford's Overseas Resource
Center who assists in the admin
istration of the program.
Other members of the consor
tium include the University of
California system, the University
of Washington and the USC, who
select their fellows through the
Educational Opportunities Coun
cil. The council is a South African
based organization, led by

'The classroom is all
theory,' says Mzike. 'It
is with the poor
people where media
tion is being applied.'

fields applicants for various schol

ties abroad.
