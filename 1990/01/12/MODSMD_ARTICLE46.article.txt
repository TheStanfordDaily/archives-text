# Prof. testifies in L.A. voting rights trial
## 
### Holly Hacker 
Assoc. Prof, of History A 1 Camarillo testified
before the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
County this week in a historic voting rights
trial that could significantly increase the
voting power of the county's 2.5 million Chi
cano/Latinos.
The Mexican American Legal Defense and
Education Fund and the American Civil
Liberties Union, in conjunction with the U.S.
Department of Justice, are accusing the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors of ger
rymandering the county into three districts
to decrease the political influence of Latinos.
In diluting the ethnic vote, Chicano/Latinos
have less a chance of electing a Latino to one
of the board's six seats. Camarillo notes that
"there has not been a single Chicano/Latino
on the board since the 1860s or 1870s."
As a witness for the Department of Justice,
Camarillo described the history of discrimi
nation of Chicano/Latinos in America and the
effects of exclusion, non-representation and
segregation on the Latino community.
Camarillo was selected in part for his ex
tensive research in Chicano history. In the
past he has contributed 10 the U.S. Commis
sion on Civil Rights Reports and is currently
authoring a book on the conditions of

Mexicans, blacks and Europe
ans in American cities.
He said he believes under
representation of Latinos is
not so much a problem of in
dividual discrimination
against Chicano/Latinos as it
is of "institutionalized racism
which develops over time."
Incumbents fear the elec
tion of a Chicano/Latino to

the board "because [they believe it would]
upset the status quo," Camarillo said. Intro
ducing a Democratic Chicano/Latino could dis
rupt the balance established by the
predominantly conservative board.
However, Camarillo stressed the need for
Chicano/Latino board members.
"Chicano/Latino are neglected and have had
no one servicing their needs," he explained.
Compared to their white counterparts, more
Chicano/Latinos are poor and underprivileged
in educational, economic and political terms.
Holding one of the most powerful positions
in the United States at the local level gives
"a board member amazing power to create
social services," according to Camarillo.
The case holds special significance because
Los Angeles County, which is 30 percent Chi
cano/Latino, represents the largest concentra

tion of Chicano/Latinos in the United States.
Although the outcome of the case will not
be known for several weeks, a loss by the
county board would force a remapping of the
districts such that Chicano/Latinos would
have a greater chance of being elected.
In a 1983 case, the Department of Justice
sued the Los Angeles City Council on similar
grounds and won, resulting in the election of
two Chicano/Latinos to the council.
The observation of Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday Monday lends an added importance
to the case, Camarillo said. The county board
is accused of violating the Voting Rights Act
of 1965, a piece of federal legislation resulting
from King's efforts to prevent the gerryman
dering of blacks in the South.
A victory for the Department of Justice,
said Camarillo, would uphold "one of the las
ting legacies of King and his movement to
empower those who have been politically
powerless for 130 years."
