A Stanford sophomore who
stopped out in the middle of fall
quarter died at his home in Luf
kin, Texas on Jan. 2.
While details of his death
remain sketchy, the preliminary
evidence indicates that Christo
pher Gutierrez was shot by his
mother, who then turned the gun
on herself, said Deputy Sheriff
Ron Brandon, who oversaw the
case in Lufkin.
Gutierrez, who lived in Mirlo
House, stopped out in October
after the earthquake, according
to Rodger Whitney, residence dean

for Florence Moore Hall. He
planned to return to school winter
quarter, according to John Pear
con, the residence fellow for Mirlo.
Brandon remarked that both
Gutierrez and his mother were
"suffering from depression," but
he was unwilling to provide any
further details.
The results of the autopsy have
not yet been released, according
to the Lufkin county clerk's office.
According to Whitney, all of the
resident assistants in Mirlo were
notified just before the reopening
of dorms on Sunday. All of the
residents of Mirlo and Gutierrez's
friends have already been told, he
said.
