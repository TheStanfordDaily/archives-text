# Fac Sen questions Kennedy about News Service's future
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
In their first meeting since News Service
director Bob Beyers announced his retire
ment, members of the Faculty Senate last
night questioned University President
Donald Kennedy on the role News Service
will now play.
Beyers stepped down from his post Jan.
1. His final years were marred by conflicts
with several administrators, many of whom
tried to keep tight reins on him because
he was considered too independent of Uni
versity control.
Beyers also had conflicts, particularly
with Bob Freelen, vice president of public
affairs, about how open the University
should be.
University President Donald Kennedy, in
his report to the senate, addressed the
concerns stemming from Beyers' early re
tirement and responded to a plea from
Prof. Robert Polhemus to state for the
record how he felt campus news should be
handled.
