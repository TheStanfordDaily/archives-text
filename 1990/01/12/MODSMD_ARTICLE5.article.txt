# Fac Sen questions Kennedy about News Service's future
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
In their first meeting since News Service
director Bob Beyers announced his retire
ment, members of the Faculty Senate last
night questioned University President
Donald Kennedy on the role News Service
will now play.
Beyers stepped down from his post Jan.
1. His final years were marred by conflicts
with several administrators, many of whom
tried to keep tight reins on him because
he was considered too independent of Uni
versity control.
Beyers also had conflicts, particularly
with Bob Freelen, vice president of public
affairs, about how open the University
should be.
University President Donald Kennedy, in
his report to the senate, addressed the
concerns stemming from Beyers' early re
tirement and responded to a plea from
Prof. Robert Polhemus to state for the
record how he felt campus news should be
handled.
Kennedy stressed that he
shared Beyers' desire for open
ness, but called the handling of
campus news a complicated and
challenging matter.
"To pretend there won't be dis
agreement is to pretend the world
is a whole lot better than it really
is," he said.
"Through its news releases,
Stanford speaks institutionally,"
and the need for careful wording
sometimes requires news releases
to be read by the Legal Office and
the Office of the President, Ken
nedy said.
"To pretend we don't need that
kind of review is to pretend it's
a simpler world than it is," he
said.
Polhemus said Beyers' depar
ture creates a problem of per
ceived credibility, citing a letter
in yesterday's Daily written by
Peninsula Times Tribune reporter
Mary Madison.
Madison wrote, "I wonder
whether [Beyer's] absence will
make it possible for the University
now to shut off the free flow of

news and instead 'manage' the
news like a major corporation."
Kennedy said he hoped that the
problem of perceived credibility
would be solved after a search
committee for a new director is
formed. The process would in
volve input from faculty and
people from outside the Univer
sity.
Kennedy offered to meet with
the Senate Steering Committee to
discuss the role of Stanford News
Service and the questions raised
by Beyers' departure.
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni
said the problem was that "there's
a conflict between News Service
and public relations. [Stanford
News Service] can't do both."
"We don't ask News Service to
do public affairs," Kennedy said.
"That function lives in Building
170 (the Office of Public Affairs)."
At its meeting yesterday, the
senate presented Beyers with a
plaque commemorating his "full,
accurate and unbiased reporting
of its debate."
Senate Chair Carolyn Lougee
thanked Beyers, who served as the
body's information officer since
1968, for reporting the meetings
"with openness and candor."
