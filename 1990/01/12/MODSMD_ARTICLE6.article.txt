# Rosse downplays tenure ruling
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Provost James Rosse downplayed
the effect the recent Supreme Court
tenure discrimination ruling would
have on Stanford at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
"I don't regard it as a crisis," he
said, referring to the court's rilling
that universities must release person
nel files to federal investigators in
tenure discrimination cases.
If the confidentiality of files is ham
pered by the decision, then "I an
ticipate that letters of recommen
dation will become less important,"
Rosse said.
