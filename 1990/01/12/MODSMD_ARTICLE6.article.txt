# Rosse downplays tenure ruling
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Provost James Rosse downplayed
the effect the recent Supreme Court
tenure discrimination ruling would
have on Stanford at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
"I don't regard it as a crisis," he
said, referring to the court's rilling
that universities must release person
nel files to federal investigators in
tenure discrimination cases.
If the confidentiality of files is ham
pered by the decision, then "I an
ticipate that letters of recommen
dation will become less important,"
Rosse said.
But Rosse said the diminishing
importance of recommendations
wouldn't destroy the tenure deci
sion process. "There are other
ways of insuring the process," he
said.
The Supreme Court has left it
to the district courts to determine
the degree of confidentiality
protected, Rosse said.
Stanford's current tenure griev
ance process involves a hierarchy
of committees, starting from the
individual department and moving
up through the school and Uni
versity bureaucracies.
"I don't question the fairness
— I question the speed," History
Prof. Peter Stansky said. He sug
gested that one grievance commit
tee could quicken what is now a
slow process.
Several years ago, Rosse ap
pointed Law Prof. Keith Mann to
review Stanford's grievance pro
cedures because the lengthy proc
ess was placing "an undo burden
on the institution," he said.
Mann's study was never com
pleted.
Rosse, noting that the number
of grievances has decreased dram
atically, said the issue remains on
his agenda, but he feels other is
sues are more pressing.
Education Prof. Denis Phillips
questioned Stanford's decision to
enter the suit by filing a friend
of-the-court brief to the Supreme
Court, since faculty input was not
solicited.
Stanford's brief sided with the
University of Pennsylvania, ar
guing that releasing the recom

mendations would damage the
peer review process and ulti
mately affect academic freedom.
Phillips, citing Kennedy's com
ment in Monday's Daily that Stan
ford is "a very democratic place,"
asked Kennedy "by what demo
cratic process did the University
decide to join the suit."
Kennedy countered by distin
guishing between the University
as a community and the Univer
sity as a legal entity.
When Stanford acts as a legal
body, "the president has a little
power," he said. He came to his
decision after consulting with the
vice presidents and deans.
"No doubt if you disagree, you'll
be happy with the decision," Ken
nedy quipped.
In other business, in an emo
tional speech to the senate, Tasha
Castaneda, ASSU student repre
sentative, asked Kennedy "for a
commitment that the University
will give all Stanford women the
opportunity to learn to defend
ourselves against sexual assault."
Castaneda told the senate how
she, along with 50 other women,
tried to enroll in Issues in Self-
Defense for Women, a SWOPSI
course limited to 12 students.
"More than three-fourths of us
who came, asking to learn how to
defend ourselves against sexual
assault, were denied admission,"
she said.
The demand for the self-defense
class has often been higher than
class capacity, Castaneda said.
In fall 1989, 28 women showed
up for one of the 12-person
classes. In spring 1989, 35 women
vied for 14 spots. Last winter, 45
people competed for one of the
15-person classes.

Castaneda requested that the
University allocate more money
to the program so that more
women could take the class. She
suggested the possibility of offer
ing self-defense workshops in res
idences as a way to reach more
women
Kennedy, who only learned of
Castaneda's request at the meet
ing, said, "I think there is some
thing we can do," but postponed
making a commitment until dis
cussing the matter with the deans
of academic studies.
Prof. Ewart Thomas, dean of
Humanities and Science, told Cas
taneda that "money won't be a
problem."
In other action, W. Gary Ernst,
the new dean of the School of
Earth Sciences, reported to the
senate on the future of geology
at Stanford.
While Stanford's Geology De
partment is rated among the top
in the nation, Ernst called atten
tion to the school's "aging faculty,
obsolescent equipment and build
ings that have fallen down around
our ears."
He also cited the "disastrously
low" number of undergraduate
majors as a cause for concern.
Ernst said the number of geol
ogy majors has risen and fallen
drastically over the past two
decades, driven by the fluctuating
oil market.
He proposed that the school
prepare itself for the future and
attract more students by combin
ing with the Biology Department
and School of Engineering to
develop interdisciplinary pro
grams in environmental science.

sues are more pressing.
Education Prof. Denis Phillips
questioned Stanford's decision to
enter the suit by filing a friend
of-the-court brief to the Supreme
Court, since faculty input was not
solicited.
Stanford's brief sided with the
University of Pennsylvania, ar
guing that releasing the recom

mendations would damage the
peer review process and ulti
mately affect academic freedom.
Phillips, citing Kennedy's com
ment in Monday's Daily that Stan
ford is "a very democratic place,"
asked Kennedy "by what demo
cratic process did the University
decide to join the suit."
Kennedy countered by distin
guishing between the University
as a community and the Univer
sity as a legal entity.
When Stanford acts as a legal
body, "the president has a little
power," he said. He came to his
decision after consulting with the
vice presidents and deans.
"No doubt if you disagree, you'll
be happy with the decision," Ken
nedy quipped.
In other business, in an emo
tional speech to the senate, Tasha
Castaneda, ASSU student repre
sentative, asked Kennedy "for a
commitment that the University
will give all Stanford women the
opportunity to learn to defend
ourselves against sexual assault."
Castaneda told the senate how
she, along with 50 other women,
tried to enroll in Issues in Self-
Defense for Women, a SWOPSI
course limited to 12 students.
"More than three-fourths of us
who came, asking to learn how to
defend ourselves against sexual
assault, were denied admission,"
she said.
The demand for the self-defense
class has often been higher than
class capacity, Castaneda said.
In fall 1989, 28 women showed
up for one of the 12-person
classes. In spring 1989, 35 women
vied for 14 spots. Last winter, 45
people competed for one of the
15-person classes.

Castaneda requested that the
University allocate more money
to the program so that more
women could take the class. She
suggested the possibility of offer
ing self-defense workshops in res
idences as a way to reach more
women
Kennedy, who only learned of
Castaneda's request at the meet
ing, said, "I think there is some
thing we can do," but postponed
making a commitment until dis
cussing the matter with the deans
of academic studies.
Prof. Ewart Thomas, dean of
Humanities and Science, told Cas
taneda that "money won't be a
problem."
In other action, W. Gary Ernst,
the new dean of the School of
Earth Sciences, reported to the
senate on the future of geology
at Stanford.
While Stanford's Geology De
partment is rated among the top
in the nation, Ernst called atten
tion to the school's "aging faculty,
obsolescent equipment and build
ings that have fallen down around
our ears."
He also cited the "disastrously
low" number of undergraduate
majors as a cause for concern.
Ernst said the number of geol
ogy majors has risen and fallen
drastically over the past two
decades, driven by the fluctuating
oil market.
He proposed that the school
prepare itself for the future and
attract more students by combin
ing with the Biology Department
and School of Engineering to
develop interdisciplinary pro
grams in environmental science.
Provost James Rosse downplayed
the effect the recent Supreme Court
tenure discrimination ruling would
have on Stanford at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
"I don't regard it as a crisis," he
said, referring to the court's rilling
that universities must release person
nel files to federal investigators in
tenure discrimination cases.
If the confidentiality of files is ham
pered by the decision, then "I an
ticipate that letters of recommen
dation will become less important,"
Rosse said.
But Rosse said the diminishing
importance of recommendations
wouldn't destroy the tenure deci
sion process. "There are other
ways of insuring the process," he
said.
The Supreme Court has left it
to the district courts to determine
the degree of confidentiality
protected, Rosse said.
Stanford's current tenure griev
ance process involves a hierarchy
of committees, starting from the
individual department and moving
up through the school and Uni
versity bureaucracies.
"I don't question the fairness
— I question the speed," History
Prof. Peter Stansky said. He sug
gested that one grievance commit
tee could quicken what is now a
slow process.
Several years ago, Rosse ap
pointed Law Prof. Keith Mann to
review Stanford's grievance pro
cedures because the lengthy proc
ess was placing "an undo burden
on the institution," he said.
Mann's study was never com
pleted.
Rosse, noting that the number
of grievances has decreased dram
atically, said the issue remains on
his agenda, but he feels other is
sues are more pressing.
