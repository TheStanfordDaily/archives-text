# Documenting a dream
## King Papers to open house next week, to release first volume by next year

Have a Dream" speech, History
Prof. Clayborne Carson never
dreamed he would later be respon
sible for publishing the scholarly
compilation of King's writings and
correspondence.
That was 1963. This is 1990.
As the head of the Martin Lu
ther King Jr. Papers Project, Car
son has since dedicated his
academic career to studying the
man who helped shape many of
his beliefs.
In commemoration of King's
birthday, the Papers Project will
hold an open house Tuesday from
3 to 6 p.m. at Cypress Hall. The
event will feature many writings
and photos that the project has
collected over the past four years.
The first volume published by
the project is scheduled for release
early next year, according to
Stewart Burns, assistant editor of
the project. It will chronicle King's
life prior to the Montgomery bus
boycott, the event which marked
his emergence as a political and
spiritual leader.
The long-term project will
result in a definitive 12-part biog
raphy of King. It is not expected
to be completed for another 15
years at the earliest, Carson said.
In the interim, the project is
developing a research base unlike

any other focusing on a contem
porary figure. The final biography
will draw from an estimated
200,000 documents, Burns said.
"I can't imagine any other per
son ... so interesting and inspir
ing to justify this much energy
and study," Carson said.
It was in 1984 that the King
Center for Non-violent Social
Change, which has many of King's
writings in its Atlanta archives,
decided to commission a compre
hensive examination of the slain
civil rights leader's life and work.
Carson was chosen to oversee
the project by Coretta Scott King,
the minister's widow.
With support from University
President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse, Carson was
convinced that he could research
King's life while remaining at
Stanford. In turn, he convinced
Coretta King, and the project
began here in September 1985.
The project has editors working
together in Atlanta and at Stan
ford, Burns said. Both groups are
continually sending information
laden computer disks across the
country for review.
Besides receiving items from
the King Center archives, the proj
ect also traces other sources of
information. A number of such
collections on King's life already
exist. The most difficult part of
the project is attempting to track
