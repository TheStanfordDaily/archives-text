"Coming out of an undergraduate liberal arts program, I was looking to do something
challenging that could lead to bigger and better things. There aren't many technical companies
that will say, 'Hey, I know you are a little fuzzy but show me what you can do'. Microsoft did and
I accepted their challenge, I've never looked back since."

"Why did I come to Microsoft? The free diet Coke? Saving thousands of dollars on NOT
having to buy suits? It didn't hurt, but the main reason is because Microsoft is unique. You never
get handed a 'Corporate Guidelines' book and told to memorize it. Instead, you're given a task and
you have to figure out the best way to do it. At Microsoft, people listen to my creative ideas and
solutions. Besides, it's amazing what a city without smog can be like. Even the most jaded
urbanite won't believe how beautiful it is here."

"When I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree, I was looking for a job that would
let me use the analytical skills I'd sharpened in college and give me a solid grounding in business
principles. From marketing to manufacturing, I wanted to learn it all. Product management at
Microsoft was the perfect fit. I'm surrounded by incredibly bright people, while playing an
integral part in shaping not only the direction of my product, but also the PC industry. Not many
people can say that."

"It's hard to separate work and play. When they told me I had 'full business and marketing
responsibilities for the #1 selling recreational product of all time — Flight Simulator', I wasn't sure
what that meant. I've found out. It meant responsibility. And, it meant fun. One day I review and
approve new advertising; the next week I'm on the road, meeting with accounts and the sales force.
In between? I'm honing my skills as an armchair pilot. It's all in a day's work."
