KEPLER'S PRESENTS
KAWASAKI MS
discussing his new book
THE
MACINTOSH WAY
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 17,8 P.M.
THE MACINTOSH WAY is an entertaining and
provocative book written from the heart of one of
the high priests of the Macintosh religion. For those
who want to learn about the business of technology,
this irreverent book offers an honest glimpse at "the
art of guerrilla management."
Guy Kawasaki is president of ACIUS, which
publishes 4th Dimension for Macintosh, and is the
former director of software product management at
Apple Computer.
All events are free to the public.
