Police will arrest this week an
18-year-old male suspected of as
sault at an Oct. 6 party at the
Delta Kappa Epsilon house, Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said Friday.
The suspect, a student at the
California Polytechnic State Insti
tute in San Luis Obispo, report
edly "grabbed, kissed and
fondled" a 13-year-old girl in the
upstairs bathroom at the Deke
house, the victim told police.
Niemeyer confirmed that the
sexual encounter did take place,
based on additional information
the police have received.
Sexual conduct with a person
under age 14 is a felony under
section 288 A of the penal code.
Niemeyer said that, the encoun
ter was consensual on the part of
the girl.
According to Niemeyer, Deke of
ficers "continue to disavow any
knowledge of this (incident)," but
said "some fraternity members
were helpful in identifying the
suspect."
Six to 10 other men were in the
bathroom at the time of the in
cident, he said.
"This was no dark secret,"
Niemeyer said.
Deke president Mike Nakas
hima said his fraternity
"cooperated with police, and from
that cooperation, they were able
to develop some leads."
But he added that "no one
really knew anything about [the
incident]. The first time we knew
was when [Fraternal Affairs Ad
viser] Michael Hughes told us
about it."
The girl was allowed into the
party without a Stanford ID, but
her older male friend, Eric, who
later was responsible for finding
her and taking her out of the
bathroom at the time of the in
cident, was not at first granted
entry, Niemeyer reported.
"She convinced the people at
the door to let [Eric] in,"he said.
Nakashima said he did not
know if that characterization was
correct, but he said it was possi
ble.
"A portion of the fraternity
knew she was there and at the
center of attention due to her age
and dress," Niemeyer said.
Police have concluded their in
vestigation and are filing charges
against the suspect, he said.
Niemeyer praised the "dogged
and diligent" efforts of Sgt. Chris
topher LefTerts, who headed the
investigation.
The investigation by the Dean
of Student Affairs Office, headed
by Hughes, is still continuing,
Hughes said last week. Hughes
will determine if the Deke house
has any liability for the incident.
