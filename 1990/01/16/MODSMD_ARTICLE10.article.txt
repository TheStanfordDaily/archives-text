# Proposed alcohol regulations:
## Support and concern expressed for changes 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons' proposed alcohol regula
tions have met with a mixture of
support and concern as residence
staffs and student leaders begin
considering the implications of
the proposals on campus life.
In addition to banning alcohol
from athletic events, Lyons' pro
posals prevent dorm funds and
other money collected through
University channels to be spent
on alcohol.
Various student leaders said
that their fellow students were
concerned about the recent in
crease in alcohol-related incidents
but were wary that the policy
would upset the social atmosphere
in dorms.
"Most students are concerned
about the Stanford community
and events at the stadium in the
last football game," said Council
of Presidents member David
Brown, referring to the 27 arrests
that marred this year's Big Game.
"At the same time, people want
to preserve their freedom."
ASSU Senator Vince Ricci
agreed. "People have expressed
concern, but no one is really out
raged."
While students may be hesitant
and wary of Lyons' proposal,
"they're not closed to discussion,"
Ricci said.
Ricci said he feared the regula
tions could transform Stanford's
social scene into a place like
Berkeley, where the Greek system
has a monopoly on parties.
Roble Resident Fellow Evan
Porteus said he worried about
similar side-effects of the propos
al. The regulation banning dorm
fees from being spent on alcohol
might socially segregate the
campus into party and non-party
houses, he said.
"If houses wanted to have par
ties with alcohol, then they'd need
to collect that money separately,"
Porteus explained.
Lyons said previously that the
regulations did not prohibit dorms
from "passing the hat" to raise
money for alcohol purchases.
But Porteus predicted that al

cohol fundraising would not be
uniformly successful among dif
ferent residences.
"Fraternities would be places
for parties, and houses wouldn't
be," he said.
Porteus speculated that the mo
tivation behind the proposal is the
University's fear of being sued.
He added that the proposals could
help in clearing Stanford from re
sponsibility for alcohol-related ac
cidents at dorm parties.

Ujamaa House, a dry residence
for the third year in a row, pro
vides a working example of a dorm
that spends none of its house dues*
on alcohol.
Ujamaa Resident Assistant
Dana Johnson said the dorm's
policy, which residents vote on at
the beginning of the school year,
"promotes more responsible
drinking." ,
"Ujamaa is a lot cleaner than
any other dorm I've lived in,"
Johnson said, comparing her
dorm to houses in Stern and
Florence Moore Halls.
Ricci and Brown are in the proc
ess of forming an ASSU task force
to review the proposed regulations
and solicit student reaction.
The task force, which Brown
hopes to form by early this week,
will bring together
from the Interfraternity and In;
tersorority Councils, the Resident
Assistant Council and Project
R2ISC, along with resident fel
lows, members of the police de
partment and Student Affairs.
"People are aware there have
been problems," Ricci said, "but
they don't understand the jump
between changing the stadium
policy and making major changes
in the way we spend dorm funds."
Burbank RA Cam Mitchner said
that the proposals, if put into ef
fect, could lead to more irrespon
sible drinking.
Dorms as a whole would be less
likely to sponsor parties, he said.
Those that did occur would be
"more private and more alcohol
focused" in nature, he said.
