## German protests continue 
### 
EAST BERLIN (AP) - Tens of
thousands of East Germans
stormed secret police headquar
ters yesterday, tore up offices and
hurled furniture from windows.
State TV said the rampage put
the country's democratic reforms
"in gravest danger."
Also yesterday, chief prosecutor
Hans-Juergen Joseph said he
planned treason indictments of
Erich Honecker, 77, the Stalinist
leader forced out three months
ago, and Erich Mielke, 82, the
head of his secret police.
State TV said the situation at
the headquarters of the once
dreaded agency got "out of con
trol'' and ADN, the official news
agency, reported "several people
brought bricks with them."
"The democracy that is just
now developing is in the gravest
danger," said the warning on state
TV, which was repeated through
out the evening.
Communist Premier Hans
Modrow rushed to the building in
East Berlin's Lichtenberg section,
but was met with catcalls and
whistles when he tried to address
the crowd.
"You were not elected by the
people!" the crowd shouted as

Modrow called for restraint and
warned against violence.
Official media said about
500,000 East Germans demon
strated against the Communists
and secret police in at least a
dozen more cities.
Protests were also reported in
Potsdam, Erfurt, Schwerin, Ros
tock, Halle, Cottbus, Neubranden
burg, Stralsund, Magdeburg and
Frankfurt an der Oder.
Protesters in East Berlin
shouted, "We are the people! We
are the people!" as they rushed
into the secret police building.
Witnesses said they scattered doc
uments and looted wine, food and
clothing from storerooms and
closets.
The protesters filled stairways
with papers, ripped out drawers
from offices and broke windows.
Several ripped down a picture of
Honecker and trampled it.
The agency is being dismantled,
and it was not clear how many
people were working at the head
quarters Monday.
The seventh weekly negotiating
session between the Communist
Party and opposition, where the
government official assigned to
dissolve the agency had made a

report, was suspended after the
attack.
The indictment of Honecker
and Mielke would be the most
drastic action to date against
leaders of the disgraced regime
that ruled for 18 years.
Modrow promised yesterday to
open secret police files and give
the opposition a greater consulta
tive role in the government. He
appealed for an end to warning
strikes.
Manfred Sauer, the official as
signed to dismantle the secret
police, dominated yesterday's
meeting with the most compre
hensive disclosure yet about the
secret police.
He said that one of every 80
East Germans had worked for the
agency or supplied it with infor
mation, and that 3,200 employees
were assigned to tapping tele
phones and opening mail.
Sauer said the state security
apparatus cost about $2 billion to
run last year — about 1.3 percent
of the national budget.
Honecker expanded the secret
police, he said, and by the end of
the 1980s, there were 85,000
agents and 109,000 steady infor
mants in a country.
