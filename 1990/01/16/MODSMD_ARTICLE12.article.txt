MOSCOW (AP) â€” Hundreds of Azer
baijanis and Armenians fought with sub
machine guns, helicopters and armored
vehicles as brutal ethnic strife that
claimed at least 37 lives raged in the
Soviet Caucasus, official reports said yes
terday.
Facing the most violent flareup in the
bloodiest ethnic conflict since he became
Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
the Soviet Presidium declared a state of
emergency last night in the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan,
as well as other nearby areas of Azer
baijan and the neighboring republic of
Armenia.
Horrified Tass reporters wrote people
were burned alive overnight as attacks
against Armenians continued in Baku,
Azerbaijan's capital. "Again the blood of
Itrooncent people was spilled," they SflftT
I Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told
Norwegian radio that units of the regular
Red Army would be eeut in if neeeasary
io prevent the conflict from spreading
into civil war.
j The Kremlin sent high-level trouble

shooters and more internal security
troops to the mountain region 1,240 miles
southeast of Moscow to try to end the
worst fighting involving predominantly
Moslem Azerbaijanis and the mostly
Christian Armenians since their long
simmering feud over territory boiled over
nearly two years ago.
Tass, the official news agency, said Ar
menians and Azerbaijanis equipped with
submachine guns were waging "open,
armed clashes" in the Khanlar region of
Azerbaijan, near Nagorno-Karabakh. In
the nearby Shaumansky region, Soviet
TV news said, 300 gunmen fought in a
single battle.
The violence, which exploded Saturday
night with an anti-Armenian riot in the
oil-producing center of Baku, is "reminis

Kudrin said grimly.
Izvestia said at least 33 people had
died- in the past-three days in anti-
Armenian rampages in Baku, a city of
1.7 million, but that the figure could rise
as other ransacked apartments were in

spected.
"Last night in Baku was as horrible
as the previous one," Tass special cor
respondents N. Demidov and V. Gondusov
wrote from the city on the Caspian Sea.
"Once again, the fires of pogroms burned.
Again the blood of innocent people was
spilled."
They said people, presumably Ar
menians, had been burned alive in front
of Baku's railway station.
Two ferries evacuated about 660 Ar
menians, mostly women and children,
from Baku across the Caspian to the city
of Krasnovodsk in the republic of
Turkmenia, Soviet TV said. They were
flown to Yerevan, Armenia's capital,
aboard two Tupolev-154 jetliners, said
Karen Shakhbazyan, an Armenian activ
ist in the city.
About 20,000 ethnic Armenians, most
of them elderly, live in Baku, although
the ethnic violence in the last two years
Tias 1 caused a return of Azerbaijanis and
Armenians to their home republics.
"Armenia is in a state of battle readi
ness," Shakhbazyan reported from

Yerevan. He said 200,000 people rallied
Monday on Theater Square and that at
least 100 armed police massed at the
airport hoping to fly helicopters to Azer
baijan to defend Armenians there.
Shakhbazyan said businesses in
Yerevan formed "defense committees" of
volunteers. In the city of Leninakan, a
city hit hard by the 1988 earthquake, 10
machine guns and 100 assault rifles were
seized from an Interior Ministry troop
detachment, he said.
Tass repc.-ted Armenian fighters had
taken hostages in the Azerbaijani city of
Gyandzha, and Izvestia said unidentified
people broke into an agricultural institute
and grabbed 80 automatic weapons, two
machine guns, a mortar and 27 bayonets
kept for students' military training.
In Armppifips includ
ing the entire Communist Party and gnv
ernment leadership were taken hostage,
Soviet TV said.
The Kremlin dispatched Yevgeny M.
Primakov, a non-voting member of the
ruling Politburo and chairman of one of
the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet

legislature, to Baku, and Nikolai N.
Slyunkov, a full Politburo member, to
Yerevan.
