\ Church bells across the country
tolled the loss of Martin Luther
fting Jr. yesterday, as echoes of
the racial conflicts the slain civil
rights leader struggled to over
cpme still haunt the nation,
j "With each .ring we are called
to an accountability, an account
ability of the soul and of the
Heart's conscience that asks,
'What have you done to let froe
dom ring?'" asked Pennsylvania
(lov. Robert P. Casey during a
ceremony at the Liberty Bell.
| A moment of silence was called
to reflect on King's lessons of non
violence in his pursuit of racial
equality. Organizers said bells
chimed at 12:30 p.m. EST in all
5jQ states and 144 countries. The
New York Stock Exchange paused
for a moment at noon.
' "Today the sound of liberty is
toping heard all around the world,"

dom ring?'
— Robert Casey

Congress for Racial Equality, who
pounded the Liberty Bell three
times with his fist. "Those who
have been denied liberty love it
most. Dr. King loved liberty, and
he fought and died for it."
The silences followed church
services, parades and other
celebrations held during the week
end before the federal holiday,
which for the first time falls on
King's actual birthday. He would
have been 61.

"Now is the time to organize a
global, non-violent movement,
based on Dr. King's teachings, to
put an end to the scourges of
poverty, hunger, racism and
bigotry, war and militarism," said
his widow, Coretta Scott King.
During his lifetime, King led
non-violent marches and protests
in the South in the 1950s and
1960s to end discrimination
against minorities.
His first blow against racism
came when he led a year long
boycott of segregated buses in
Montgomery, Ala. In 1964, he re
ceived the Nobel Peace Prize.
The day came at a moment of
gains for blacks: It was the first
day on the job for the nation's
first elected black governor in Vir
ginia and the start of a new ad
ministion for New York City's
first black mayor.
