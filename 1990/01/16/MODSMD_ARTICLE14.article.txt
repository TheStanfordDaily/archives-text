WASHINGTON (AP) — Low- and middle
income blacks and Hispanics have seen a "major
regression" in college attendance since the mid
-19705, according to the American Council on
Education.
Based on Census Bureau figures, the college
participation rate for dependent, low-income,
black high school graduates between 18 and 24
years old dropped from 39.8 percent in 1976 to
30.3 percent in 1988, said the Eighth Annual
Status Report on Minorities in Higher Education.
For Hispanics, the rate fell from 50.4 percent
to 35.3 percent over the same period, "indicating
an educational failure rate of intolerable magni
tude," said the report, released today by the
council's Office of Minority Concerns.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — President

Daniel Ortega accused the opposition yesterday
of plotting to create a "situation like Panama"
by withdrawing from the campaign for February's
national elections to make the balloting appear
fraudulent.
He said he told Elliot Richardson, a former
U.S. attorney general who is representing U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, that
he feared such a ploy could set the stage for U.S.
military intervention, much as it did in Panama.
