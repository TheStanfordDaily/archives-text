## Reviving the dream 
### 
King's birthday reminds
us of progress made
and challenges unmet

Yesterday would have
marked the 61st birthday of
Martin Luther King Jr. We
celebrate the memory of this great
man in a paradoxical time. While
there is reason to rejoice at the
progress that has been made in
some areas, we still have far to go
in realizing King's dream.
The high point of King's career
came in 1965 with the Selma-to-
Montgomery, Alabama march that
precipitated Congressional passage
of the Voting Rights Act. When
Lyndon Johnson signed the act in
August 1965, there were fewer
than 400 African-American elected
officials in the United States.
Twenty-five years later, that
number has surpassed 6,000.
King's protege Jesse Jackson
finished a strong second in the
race for the 1988 Democratic nom
ination and David Dinkins was
elected the first African-American
mayor of New York.
At Stanford, as well, significant
progress has been achieved towards
realizing King's dream. People of
color have been placed in important
positions such as Dean of Human
ities and Sciences, Senior Associate
Provost and Associate Dean of Stu
dent Affairs. The University has
accepted and is implementing
many of the recommendations of
the UCMI committee.
By shifting to Cultures, Ideas
and Values, the University has also
recognized the importance of the
works of people of color and wom
en. All of the ethnic centers have
full-time deans, and the student of
color organizations enjoy signifi
cant respect and support. Twenty
years ago, such developments

would have been unthinkable.
While hope is alive from one per
spective, there is a darker side to
contemporary American reality.
The Howard Beach killing, the
murder of Yusef Hawkins in New
York this past August, the mas
sacre of Asian children at a school
in Stockton, California last year,
and the recent mail bomb murders
of a Southern judge and an NAACP
official all provide painful
reminders that we have not prog
ressed as far as we might like.
Despite University President
Donald Kennedy's noble ambition
of creating a "benchmark multicul
tural community," we have not yet
attained that status. The numbers
of faculty and graduate students
of color remain pitifully small. The
numbers of African-American and
Chicano/Latino undergraduates
still do not reflect the percentages
of those groups in the population
at-large. And, as the May takeover
demonstrated, alienation and
anger among students of color runs
high despite our best efforts to
create change.
The campus efforts to com
memorate King's life and legacy
offer excellent opportunities for ed
ucation and action to make King's
dream a reality.
Members of the Stanford com
munity would do well to participate
in as many of these events as pos
sible in order to expand our knowl
edge about the issues of racial
justice and equality in this country.
To attain education without ac
tion, however, is to limit oneself
and to fail to live up to the chal
lenge of carrying on King's legacy.
King was a man of action.
A fitting tribute to King would
be to heed his words when he spoke
at Stanford in 1967: "We may have
to repent in this generation not for
the violent actions of the bad
people, but for the inaction of the
good people." Keep the dream alive
by acting on your convictions.
