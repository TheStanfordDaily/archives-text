## Hints from a columnist 
### 
SO YOU SAY you want to be a Daily
columnist? You've been reading
about our personal gripes, our
heartfelt causes and our personal inter
ests for over ten weeks now. And you've
decided, "Hey, I can do a better job than
any of them!"
This volume's columnists only have
about three weeks left so the time has
come for all you columnist wanna-be's to
put your fingers to the Macintosh and
apply. The formal procedure for applying
will be in The Daily in a few weeks, but
I thought you might like some helpful
hints from a seasoned veteran.
My first suggestion is simple: Don't do
it for the money. This is a job which
must come from the heart and brain, so
no mercenaries need apply. Actually, I
wish I had the opportunity to do it for
the money, but (GASP, SHOCK!) we
don't get paid. Nada, nothing, nullo. If
you're out to make money, then be on
the Council of Presidents or be a teller
at Wells Fargo, but don't be a columnist.
Secondly, don't do it if you want to
join The Daily clan. (Some say it's almost
like a frat or sorority!) I've had little
contact with my editors — mostly just
desperate messages when I don't turn in
my columns on time. If anything, we
columnists are estranged from The Daily.
We aren't allowed to write anything for
the paper but our columns.
I haven't even met all the other colum
nists because I forgot to show up at the
columnist dinner. The other day, I did
see Malinda McCollum for the first time
on campus and we said "hi." We both
smiled — yes, there might be some un

spoken bond between us that we'll never
have the chance to discuss.
Lastly, don't do it for the fame. During
your time at Stanford, there will be about
forty columnists, so one quarter everyone
in your dorm may know you, but your
face will quickly fade into the masses.
No one remembers a former columnist.
Certainly there are many positive
aspects to being a columnist. You get
recognition galore. I have been named in
the Chaparral, rebutted in The Daily,
denounced in the Stanford Review and
told off by another columnist. The Stan
ford Tree himself left me a love note, "I
hate your columns. I hate everything you
stand for. I hate you." It sounded like
penis envy to me, but I could be wrong
The best part of being a columnist is
breakfast conversation. No matter where
I eat on weekends, I always solicit for
column ideas. Today, there were several
interesting suggestions: the rain, not
taking one's first date to see "Born on
the Fourth of July" (too depressing) and
what is a crouton.
As for the nitty-gritty, many people
often ask: "Where do you get your column
ideas?" Usually I just start typing words
and hope an idea forms, but occasionally,
some article or bode I'll read will inspire
me to write a column. Then there are
weeks like this one when I have abso
lutely no idea so I just take some cliche
for a topic and try to make it readable.
I have learned one valuable lesson
through my weekly writing. Often, what
one says is not as important as how one
says it. Early in the year, I ranted in my

columns. I was heavy-handed, narrow
minded and determined. This sort of
didacticism is the best way to alienate
everyone I was trying to reach. The only
people who could make it all the way
through some of my columns were those
who already agreed with my viewpoint.
Sometimes you have to be subtle in your
biases if you want people to listen.
Often I forget that I too was once
politically blind. I worked for the Reagan
campaign in 1980, when I was a mere
10 years old. Now I realize that his budget
cuts in education programs and budget
balloons for defense were against all I
believed in. If it weren't for patient, open
minded friends, I might have permanently
written off many valid ideas as ranting,
liberal sophistry.
Sometimes it is useful to verbally ex
plode to create an effect. However, this
effect is often lost when it is transcribed
on paper.
Because my days are numbered, I must
wonder what happens to a former col
umnist. Well, I get to reclaim my Sunday
afternoons. Return to anonymity. Who
knows? If the Daily is desperate, maybe
they'll give me a shot at Andrew
Berkowitz's column. He has to graduate
some time, right?

Often I forget that I too was once
politically blind. I worked for the Reagan
campaign in 1980, when I was a mere
10 years old. Now I realize that his budget
cuts in education programs and budget
balloons for defense were against all I
believed in. If it weren't for patient, open
minded friends, I might have permanently
written off many valid ideas as ranting,
liberal sophistry.
Sometimes it is useful to verbally ex
plode to create an effect. However, this
effect is often lost when it is transcribed
on paper.
Because my days are numbered, I must
wonder what happens to a former col
umnist. Well, I get to reclaim my Sunday
afternoons. Return to anonymity. Who
knows? If the Daily is desperate, maybe
they'll give me a shot at Andrew
Berkowitz's column. He has to graduate
some time, right?

SO YOU SAY you want to be a Daily
columnist? You've been reading
about our personal gripes, our
heartfelt causes and our personal inter
ests for over ten weeks now. And you've
decided, "Hey, I can do a better job than
any of them!"
This volume's columnists only have
about three weeks left so the time has
come for all you columnist wanna-be's to
put your fingers to the Macintosh and
apply. The formal procedure for applying
will be in The Daily in a few weeks, but
I thought you might like some helpful
hints from a seasoned veteran.
My first suggestion is simple: Don't do
it for the money. This is a job which
must come from the heart and brain, so
no mercenaries need apply. Actually, I
wish I had the opportunity to do it for
the money, but (GASP, SHOCK!) we
don't get paid. Nada, nothing, nullo. If
you're out to make money, then be on
the Council of Presidents or be a teller
at Wells Fargo, but don't be a columnist.
Secondly, don't do it if you want to
join The Daily clan. (Some say it's almost
like a frat or sorority!) I've had little
contact with my editors — mostly just
desperate messages when I don't turn in
my columns on time. If anything, we
columnists are estranged from The Daily.
We aren't allowed to write anything for
the paper but our columns.
I haven't even met all the other colum
nists because I forgot to show up at the
columnist dinner. The other day, I did
see Malinda McCollum for the first time
on campus and we said "hi." We both
smiled — yes, there might be some un

spoken bond between us that we'll never
have the chance to discuss.
Lastly, don't do it for the fame. During
your time at Stanford, there will be about
forty columnists, so one quarter everyone
in your dorm may know you, but your
face will quickly fade into the masses.
No one remembers a former columnist.
Certainly there are many positive
aspects to being a columnist. You get
recognition galore. I have been named in
the Chaparral, rebutted in The Daily,
denounced in the Stanford Review and
told off by another columnist. The Stan
ford Tree himself left me a love note, "I
hate your columns. I hate everything you
stand for. I hate you." It sounded like
penis envy to me, but I could be wrong
The best part of being a columnist is
breakfast conversation. No matter where
I eat on weekends, I always solicit for
column ideas. Today, there were several
interesting suggestions: the rain, not
taking one's first date to see "Born on
the Fourth of July" (too depressing) and
what is a crouton.
As for the nitty-gritty, many people
often ask: "Where do you get your column
ideas?" Usually I just start typing words
and hope an idea forms, but occasionally,
some article or bode I'll read will inspire
me to write a column. Then there are
weeks like this one when I have abso
lutely no idea so I just take some cliche
for a topic and try to make it readable.
I have learned one valuable lesson
through my weekly writing. Often, what
one says is not as important as how one
says it. Early in the year, I ranted in my

columns. I was heavy-handed, narrow
minded and determined. This sort of
didacticism is the best way to alienate
everyone I was trying to reach. The only
people who could make it all the way
through some of my columns were those
who already agreed with my viewpoint.
Sometimes you have to be subtle in your
biases if you want people to listen.
