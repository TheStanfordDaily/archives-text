Community input needed for proposed alcohol policy

DURING THE PAST few years
there has been an increase in
the awareness and level of
events related to alcohol abuse:
drunken driving arrests on campus,
physical assaults, alcohol overdoses
requiring medical intervention and
injurious drunken conduct at athletic
events and campus parties.
We are proposing the following regu
lations in order to protect the public
welfare on campus, to discourage
alcohol abuse and to indicate institu
tional disapproval of alcohol abuse.
We plan to forward the regulations
(or versions of them altered because of

public comments and suggestions) to
University President Donald Kennedy
on March 1 with the recommendation
that they be adopted. Prior to that, we
invite written comment on the pro
posed regulations by Feb. 15. Com
ments can be sent directly to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons.
Suggestions are welcomed that im
prove the recommendations, point out
troublesome and unwanted conse
quences of their adoption and signal
issues related to their implementation.
We also are interested in knowing not
only if the regulations enjoy support or
the lack of it, but why.
The basic alcohol policy for students

remains unchanged by these recom
mendations. The policy is:
• The University expects students to
be responsible for the consequences of
their decisions to serve and consume
alcohol, and to create environments
that are safe, healthful and that pro
mote responsible behavior.
The four recommended regulations
are as follows:
• Student fees collected by the Uni
versity (activity fees, house dues, fee
ballot revenues) may not be used to
purchase alcoholic beverages.
• Alcoholic beverages are not permit
ted inside the Stanford Stadium, pools,

playing fields and pavilions at Stanford
athletic events.
• The Athletic Department will not
permit the promotion or advertising of
alcohol at events and in enterprises
under its control.
• Persons who have been convicted of
driving while intoxicated will not be
eligible to receive a permit to park on
the Stanford campus for the year
following their conviction.
