# Children on the march
## 
### 
As an accordionist played a
rendition of "Blowing in the
Wind," the children tugged at
their balloons to keep them
from drifting away. Flying high
above their heads, the bal
loons stated simply, "Happy
Birthday, Martin Luther King."
About 40 children of Escon
dido Village, including 5-year
old Josh Patashik, right, bore
the message proudly yester
day in a community parade
celebrating the life and work
of King.
