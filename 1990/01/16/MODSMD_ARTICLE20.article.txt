# Proposal burdens Greeks with parties, counters Res Ed

### 
As a former resident assistant, I see
some serious problems with Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons' proposal
to prohibit using dorm funds to pur
chase alcohol.
Banning the use of house funds for
alcohol will make fraternity and
sorority parties the main source of
alcohol for many students. This means
that students who choose to drink and
then engage in destructive behavior
will do it in someone else's house. It is
difficult to get away with damaging
the building or throwing up in the
bathroom in your own house.
If students go elsewhere to behave in
this way, they are likely to get away
with it because they don't live in the
house. Thus the new policy, far from
teaching responsible drinking, will show
students that it is alright to behave
destructively because there will be no

retribution.
Fraternities and sororities, already
under fire about liability problems
from their national chapters, are likely
to take steps to restrict who attends
with a members-only policy or "party
cards" if destructive behavior becomes
more frequei,;. These restrictions may
serve to promote an elitism that I
think no one, Greek or not, wants.
The final issue to consider when
evaluating this policy is what kind of
drinking behavior it will encourage.
Dean Lyons' point that students can
still "pass the hat" to collect funds for
alcohol is well-taken, but then how will
that group choose to spend its money?
RAs can no longer argue for modera
tion in buying alcohol when the money
is no longer part of house funds.
In addition, those who paid for the
alcohol will understandably want to
drink it themselves and protect it from
freeloaders. Thus, the new policy may
promote private parties and drinking
in hiding, and may further polarize the
drinkers and the non-drinkers in the
dorm. Consumption of alcohol will no
longer be part of an integrated social

event, but will become an event itself,
and one focused on alcohol.
The new policy seems to run counter
to many of the positive aspects of the
Office of Residential Education's alcohol
policy â€” keep the focus of the event
away from alcohol, hold people account
able for their behavior when drinking
and encourage responsible attitudes
toward alcohol. It also puts an unfair
burden on Greek organizations to carry
the brunt of campus parties.
A far better policy would be to re
quire an anonymous vote by house
residents on whether each student
wants his or her share of the house
dues to be spent on alcohol. Then alco
hol for parties could be purchased in
proportion to the number of residents
who wish to drink and RAs would
have more control about what and how
much is being purchased. In fact, many
RAs practice this policy now. Dean
Lyons, you said yourself that students
have proven collectively responsible.
Come up with a policy that shows you
mean it.
