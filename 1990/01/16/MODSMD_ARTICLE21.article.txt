# Women engineers should feel free to participate equally
## 
### 
Last quarter The Daily ran a news
story about women students in engi
neering at Stanford.
I would not like to let that story
pass without responding that the engi
neering faculty is delighted to see
many more women students in our
classes. We hope and expect to see in
the future many more women en
gineers in industry and in our faculty
meetings as well.
I'm sure I speak for all the engineer
ing faculty in saying that we sincerely
welcome women students into our
classes and our research labs. If bar
riers to their full participation still
remain, and that we can help with, I
hope those women already in engineer
ing will let us know about them.
