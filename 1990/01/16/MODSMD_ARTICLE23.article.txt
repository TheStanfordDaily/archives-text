## University must focus on helping students with young children 
### 
YOUR ARTICLE on the struggles
of graduate students to meet the
too often conflicting responsibili
ties of child care and academic study
deserves praise ("Families face finan
cial hardships," Jan. 9). The scramble
to meet the skyrocketing costs of
attracting and keeping teachers trained
in early childhood education has indeed
become at best stressful and at worst
debilitating.
A few statistics gathered last year at
the Children's Center of the Stanford
community are illustrative.
9 Eighty-six percent of the Stanford
student, faculty and staff families
enroll their children, not for purposes
of enrichment or a few hours off for

mom and dad, but because both par
ents must work and/or attend school.
• For nearly 65 percent there are no
relatives within 50 miles who can
provide help to make it possible to
study, grade papers or take on work
related projects. Traditional, less costly
solutions are simply not available.
• For nearly 70 percent of the
families, the monthly cost of child care
(not counting additional baby sitting
that may be required) accounts for
more than 10 percent of their total
monthly family income. For 25 percent
of the families child care costs account
for more than 20 percent of their total
family take-home income.
A family with only one child enrolled

full-time must pay between five and
eight thousand dollars a year for work
day coverage. Double the figure for
two children. No one believes seriously
that Stanford's lack of financial aid in
this area is based on a conscious effort
to exclude students (or faculty or
staff).
Yet there is serious danger that the
result will be just that. Too many of
us simply cannot bear these costs. Yet
we are faced with simple arithmetic.
Unless we ignore the requirement that
child care teachers receive formal
training in early childhood education,
the cost of maintaining child care
facilities will continue to rise. And
unless something in the formula is

altered parents will continue to bear
100 percent of the cost of our teachers'
salaries — a figure that accounts for
92 percent of the entire cost.
For a long time, the University has
understood the need to subsidize the
cost of housing in the local market to
attract and retain the best faculty. The
University has long recognized the
need to provide scholarships to attract
the best students. A generous donor
has made it possible now to help
graduate students with families to
afford campus housing. And Stanford
itself helps faculty and staff with
college-age children to pay for their
college educations with direct subsidies.
The cost of education has made this

help a necessity. Now it is time for the
University to help the faculty, staff,
and students at the other end of their
careers — those with young families
who can least afford these crushing
costs. The cost of child care is barely
behind the cost of private universities.
And unlike college students who can
take out loans and accept work-study
jobs, our infants and toddlers can only
react by feeling the stress generated by
parents held to the flame of financial
demands none of us can meet.
