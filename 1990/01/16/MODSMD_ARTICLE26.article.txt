## Waterbed mania hits campus 
### 
The Stanford Daily
January 17, 1967
Dr. Timothy Leary, noted
counterculture guru of the
19605, directed a group of Stan
ford students in Tresidder Un
ion to "Turn on, tune in, drop
out."
Leary advocated that stu
dents use LSD to gain perspec
tive on their place in the
universe. "How can you take
it seriously when you've seen
how Stanford University fits
into the $2 billion per year
scheme? And they call
Stanford-Cal the Big Game!"
Big Game not important?
Come on, Tim Just say no. Next
you'll be telling us that the
NCAA college basketball tour
naments are not significant in
the cosmic sense, either.

Waterbed mania swept the
Stanford campus when a fifth

year senior advertised low
priced waterbeds in The
Stanford Daily with the pitch,
"Enjoy exciting, sensual,
hedonistic living â€” buy a
waterbed." The student was be
sieged by phone calls at all
hours of the day and night and
termed his sales figures
"astronomical."
University administrators
began considering possible
safety problems created by
waterbeds in dorm rooms.
Leave it to administrators to
take all the fun out of exciting,
sensual, hedonistic living ... .
