# A 						Stanford snowperson?
## 
### 
Two ATO seniors returned from
Lake Tahoe yesterday with more
than just memories of a fun-filled,
snowy long weekend on the slopes.
Roommates Tim Hullar and Mi
chael Scott brought both the fun
and the snow back to campus
when they loaded a 3-piece snow
man into the back of Scott's
pickup truck and sped home to
set the snowman up on the ATO
lawn.
Hullar, speaking for both room
mates because Scott was asleep,
said the two were inspired to
create their work because their
third roommate was unable to go
on the dorm ski trip.
Hullar said he and Scott built
the snowman Monday morning,
then loaded it in pieces for the
four-hour trip back to campus. He
characterized the style of his
handiwork as "pre-fab."
By 3:30 p.m. yesterday the mas
terpiece was little more than a
pile of slush and cold water on
ATO's front lawn. Hullar said
their roommate was "most
pleased" with the present.

A Stanford snowperson graced the lawn of ATO for several hours Monday morning. By late afternoon,
however, the snowperson had pretty much melted away.
