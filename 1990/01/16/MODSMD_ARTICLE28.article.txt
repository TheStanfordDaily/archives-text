Do these things sound like a
part of a great summer vacation?
Actually, they're just a few of the
perks students receive when they
spend a summer working at the
Stanford Sierra Camp. Thrown in
are the gorgeous surroundings,
potential alumni contacts and
friendships with other Stanford
students working at the camp.
This combination produces a
Summer job that's pretty hard to
beat. The Stanford Sierra Camp,
owned and operated by the Stan
ford Alumni Association, is a fam
ily camp open to Stanford alumni,
faculty and staff. Each year over
55 Stanford students work at
Sierra Camp in various positions,
from running the children's
groups to working in the kitchen

"I can't think of a better way
to spend a summer," claims 1990
StafT Director Kurt Triplett. "To
get paid to work and play at a
beautiful place like Fallen Leaf
Lake in the Sierra is almost crim
inal."
Nevertheless, Triplett is willing
to be an accessory to crime as he
and his five-person interviewing
committee tackle the task of
hiring a staff for the summer of
1990. One of the challenges facing
Triplett's committee is combat
ting some popular myths that sur
round Sierra Camp and the hiring
process.
One of the first misconceptions
Triplett would like to dispel is
that camp is a summer-long party.
According to senior Robert Schlos
sman, a two-time veteran of
Sierra Camp, "Almost everybody
hears about the parties. They do
exist, and they're definitely fun,
but. dial's only a small part of

camp. The rest of it is hard work.
Not only does entertaining kids
and adults 12 hours a day take a
great deal of energy and imagina
tion, but you also have to work
shifts where you clean cabins,
wash dishes and work the dining
room."
Another mistaken impression is
that jobs at Sierra Camp are the
sole province of fraternities and
sororities. According to Christine
Beckman, a junior on the inter
viewing committee, "While we do
have great counselors from the
Greek system, they are by no
means the majority at camp.
Staffers represent the entire range
of Stanford students, from frosh
to seniors, engineers to English
majors and everything in be
tween. We want a wide variety of
creative and energetic people."
Great strides have also been
made to achieve a greater ethnic
mix among the staff. According

to Alison Chinn, a senior commit
tee member, "Last year we offered
20 percent of our positions to mi
nority applicants. Our ultimate
goal is to have camp be an accu
rate reflection of the cultural di
versity of the campus."
A final myth, says Triplett, is
that inexperienced people need
not apply. "Many students feel
that because they don't have any
camp experience, they are not
qualified and have nothing to of
fer. Nothing could be farther from
the truth. Some of our best staff
ers are those who have no precon
ceived notion about what a camp
is supposed to be like."
Triplett added that the Sierra
Camp is always looking for new
ideas and programs. Students in
terested in applying should stop
by the Bowman Alumni House or
the Sierra Camp table in White
Plaza. Applications are due Mon
day, January 22.
