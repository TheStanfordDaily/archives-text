PULLMAN, Wash. — As hard to be
lieve as it sounds, a trip to Pullman,
Wash., was just what the Stanford Car
dinal needed. Despite high temperatues
in the low 40s, no sightings of the sun
and a pretty small number of exciting
things to do, a game against Washington
State was the perfect cure for the Stan
ford men's basketball team.
Coming off their worst performance
of the season Thursday night against
Washington, the Cardinal rebounded by
rebounding at Friel Court in a 69-49
win over the Cougars Sunday.

Stanford dominated the glass, pulling
down 51 boards to the Cougars' 36 and
played good defense to run the team's
record to 10-3 overall, 2-2 in the Pacific
10 Conference. Washington State fell to
7-9, 1-5.
"This was a win we really needed,"
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "I
thought we defended fairly well. . . . I'm
really pleased with the win. It has been
a long two days since the loss to Wash
ington."
Stanford shot .373 from the field in
a 71-59 loss to the Huskies in Seattle
Thursday, but on Sunday it was the
Cougars who had problems scoring. The
Cardinal defense held WSU to .272
shooting for the game.
Stanford, meanwhile, shot .575 for
the game, led by 20-for-30 shooting by
the front line. Adam Keefe scored 30
points on 10-of-12 shooting, and Deshon
Wingate went 6 for 10 for 16 points.
Keefe and Wingate each had career-best
rebound totals with 15 and 13, respec
tively.
Montgomery said yesterday that he
would give Wingate his second start of
the season in Thursday night's home
game against Wingate is averag

ing 9.8 points and 5.7 rebounds a game.
Montgomery said center Derek Bruton
will come off the bench. Bruton is shoot
ing .846 from the field in conference
games but is only averaging 4.9 points
per game.
"If we can play better right from the
start of the game by being a little quick
er," Montgomery said, "we can maybe
get out to a lead. Then maybe Derek
can come in and relax, get a couple of
baskets, a couple of rebounds. That'll
help the team."
Stanford led the entire game but was
only up 27-23 at the half, thanks to
several missed opportunities. In addi
tion to a bunch of unforced turnovers,
Stanford was 3 of 9 from the free throw
line. The Cardinal missed the front end
of five one-and-one situations in the
last 5:34 of the first half.
Those problems offset the Cardinal's
12-for-18 shooting and the 20-12
rebounding advantage. Stanford ex
tended the lead to six when John Patrick
found Andrew Vlahov downcourt on the
fast break. Vlahov made a nice pass to
Keefe, who scored on a reverse two
handed lay-up.
The Cougars hung close until the
score was 34-32, when Keefe scored nine
points in a 13-0 run that put the game
out of reach. The Cardinal missed five
more front-ends in the second half —
the team was only 23 for 41 from the
line — but WSU never got closer than
eight the rest of the way.
Cougar guard Darryl Woods tried to
get his team back into the game with
three-point shooting but may have done
more harm than good. Washington
State's leading scorer finished with 17,
one above his season average, but did
it on 6-of-25 shooting.
Washington State played without the
team's second-leading scorer, freshman
Bennie Seltzer, as he went to his home
in Birmingham, Ala., following the fatal
shooting of an uncle. Cougar Coach Kel
vin Sampson went back and forth be
tween two- and three-guard sets but

'This was a win we
really needed. I
thought we defended
fairly we 11.... It has
been a long two days
since the loss to
Washington.'
— Mike Montgomery

neither worked against Stanford's tough
man-to-man defense.
"We did a much better job contesting
shots (than against Washington),"
Montgomery said. "Good defense is
making people miss. . . . You've just got
to get a hand up and change the per
centages a little."
Stanford also attempted to fast break
more than in any other game this year.
"We tried to do that," Montgomery said.
"We have to get more points off the
fast break. It may not look like it, but
on every missed shot or turnover we
try to run the break."
Card notes
Keefe is currently shooting .665, .763 in
Pac-10 games. Before the weekend he ranked
13th nationally at .640.
In other national stats, the Cardinal was
10th in scoring defense at 60.6 per game
before giving up 120 points in two games,
and sixth in rebounding differential at plus
-10.7 per game. Stanford is now at plus-10.0.
The bus trip from Pullman to the airport
in Spokane usually takes about an hour and
a half, but the trip after the game took
about two-plus hours thanks to the bus
driver's "short-cut." It also provided an un
intentional nocturnal tour of Western Idaho.
By the way, traveling through Idaho is not
the generally-accepted, quickest method from
Pullman, Wash., to Spokane, Wash.
