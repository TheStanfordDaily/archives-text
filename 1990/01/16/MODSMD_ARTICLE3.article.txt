# Hospital plans $27 million budget slash
## 
### Paul Owens Staff writer 
Citing high operating costs and lower than ex
pected occupancy levels, Stanford Hospital on Friday
announced plans to cut up to $27 million this year
from its $320 million operating budget and an ad
ditional $5 million to $8 million next year.
In a letter to employees announcing the plans,
Hospital President Kenneth Bloem wrote that the
cuts would be necessary "to avoid financial diffi
culties in the future." Bloem added, "At the same
time, we will be examining new sources of income
for the hospital by implementing new programs to
increase our patient volume."
According to Bloem, an increase in patients unable
to pay for their care has contributed to high costs
at the hospital. Patients in this group include those
without insurance and those patients insured by
state and federal government plans that do not fully
reimburse the hospital for the cost of care.
To make up the revenue lost from treating such
patients, the hospital must raise prices for those
patients who can pay. Higher prices often compro
mise a hospital's competitiveness.
Meanwhile, a trend toward shorter-term care in
all hospitals has affected Stanford's occupancy rate.
A growing number of minor medical procedures are
accomplished through outpatient care, and the typ
ical hospital stay for patients is decreasing.
Over the past five years, the overall occupancy
rate at the hospital has averaged about 70 percent.
"We need a fully-occupied hospital," Bloem said.
With the aim of cutting costs, improving efficiency
and attracting more patients, the hospital has set
up 11 task forces to review hospital operations. The
task forces will report their recommendations for
approval to a steering committee composed of hospi
tal board members, chairs of clinical departments
and administrators.
In his letter to hospital employees, Bloem wrote,
"We cannot rule out layoffs, but it is premature to
discuss this until the task force work is completed.
If layoffs are necessary, we will look carefully at
attrition and other options in order to minimize
the hardship for our employees."
But Bloem did rule out any delay in current
construction or renovation projects at the hospital.
"That would send out the wrong signal," he said.
"These programs are part of our strategy to ensure
our unique strengths, competitiveness and viabilitv."
The steering committee is ex
pected to reach final decisions on
recommendations from the task
forces by the end of March.
Malinda Mitchell, acting chief
operating officer at the hospital,
said that the task forces hope to
realize the necessary savings by
streamlining operations and re
ducing duplication of hospital
functions and services.
Last year, the University tallied
up an operating deficit of $11 mil
lion. The hospital's budget is sep
arate from the rest of the
University's, however.
The decision to make the cuts
at the hospital was prompted by
in-depth studies of operations by
two New York consulting firms.
The studies, ordered by Bloem,
found that the hospital's costs
were not competitive with other
academic medical centers.
The studies also revealed that
without cuts and an increase in
occupancy, the hospital will have
to draw on its cash reserves to
cover the cost of indigent care.
Mitchell said that, despite the
rise in uninsured and underin
sured patients, the hospital would
not consider turning such patients
away.
Hospitals across the country are
facing a similar squeeze from an
increase in uninsured and under
insured patients and a decrease
in occupancy levels. Mitchell said
some East Coast hospitals are
losing money and are actually dip
ping into their endowments.
Stanford's hospital is not cur
rently running a deficit, Mitchell
said, but cuts will be necessary
to avoid one in the near future.
Without cuts, costs will begin to
exceed revenues later this year,
and the hospital could face a def
icit of between $30 and $35 mil
lion in 1990-91.
