# Zeilstra powers Stanford women past Washington State
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
After seventh-ranked Washing
ton couldn't even stay on the floor
with the Stanford women's bas
ketball team Thursday night,
hardly anyone would have ex

pected unrated Washington State
to do any better Saturday.
But they did. The Cougars kept
it close for over 30 minutes before
finally succumbing to the Cardi
nal 92-70. The win moved Stan
ford to 13-0, 4-0 in Pacific 10
Conference play. Washington

State fell to 10-4, 2-2 in league.
"Again I think our frontline
made the difference," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said of
the combined performances of
Julie Zeilstra, who scored a game
high 27 points, Katy Steding,
Trisha Stevens and Val Whiting.

"Julie shot well," VanDerveer
noted. "Val helped immensely
with her rebounding and scoring."
Zeilstra was 13 of 17 from the
field while Whiting contributed a
double-dozen with 12 points and
12 rebounds.
"I got some really good passes
from the wing," Zeilstra said,
trying to spread the credit
around. "[Also], I was (wide) open
for a lot of shots. I'm not usually
that open."
Whatever the reason, it was
Zeilstra's 16 first half points that
allowed Stanford to go into the
locker room leading 37-28. She
converted on 8 of 10 attempts in
the opening 20 minutes. None of
her teammates were in double fig
ures at intermission.
Stanford seemed unable to get
any rhythm. The Washington
State defense was tough in the
early going, often denying Stan
ford players the ball. When the
Cardinal did get the ball where it
wanted, the shooter oftentimes
shot a flat-footed jumper without
much arc.
That meant most of Stanford's
shots rimmed out. Excluding
Zeilstra, the Cardinal shot just 35
percent for the half.

Stanford's slow start didn't
please VanDerveer. "I was a little
disappointed," she said. "[I felt]
with a day in between (games),
we could come out and play with
a little more intensity."
Despite finishing with a 42-27
edge in rebounds, VanDerveer
didn't feel the Cardinal crashed
the boards hard enough.
In the second half, though, the
Cardinal turned it up a notch.
"We took better shots . . . set real
good screens," VanDerveer said.
But the Cougars stayed tough.
They trimmed the lead to four
two minutes into the half. Stan
ford opened the margin to nine
at 52-43. Then Kristal Stahl
buried a three-pointer from 22
feet to cut it to six.
Meanwhile, on just about every
other possession, Stahl's team
mate Angie Miller was sinking
shots from everywhere. Like
Zeilstra, Miller finished with 27,
including four three-pointers.

With Stanford on a 6-0 run and
leading 58-46, Miller hit a three
to cut the lead to single digits.
Stanford then scored four un
answered points before Miller
again swished a three to make it
62-52.
At the 9:04 mark, Miller hit
another jumper, this time for two
points, to trim the margin to 64-
54. It turned out to be the
Cougars' last gasp, however.
Stanford reeled off nine straight
points, including four by Whiting.
The freshman center helped fuel
Stanford's charge in the second
half with her rebounding. "I love
the contribution Val makes off the
bench," VanDerveer said.
When the dust settled, the score
was Stanford 73, Washington
State 56, and the clock showed
seven minutes left to play.
Card notes
The most unusual statistics from
the game came in the three-point de
partment. Despite being one of the
top three-point shooting teams in the
country, Stanford was only 2 of 7
from behind the arc.

hardly anyone would have ex

pected unrated Washington State
to do any better Saturday.
But they did. The Cougars kept
it close for over 30 minutes before
finally succumbing to the Cardi
nal 92-70. The win moved Stan
ford to 13-0, 4-0 in Pacific 10
Conference play. Washington

State fell to 10-4, 2-2 in league.
"Again I think our frontline
made the difference," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said of
the combined performances of
Julie Zeilstra, who scored a game
high 27 points, Katy Steding,
Trisha Stevens and Val Whiting.

"Julie shot well," VanDerveer
noted. "Val helped immensely
with her rebounding and scoring."
Zeilstra was 13 of 17 from the
field while Whiting contributed a
double-dozen with 12 points and
12 rebounds.
"I got some really good passes
from the wing," Zeilstra said,
trying to spread the credit
around. "[Also], I was (wide) open
for a lot of shots. I'm not usually
that open."
Whatever the reason, it was
Zeilstra's 16 first half points that
allowed Stanford to go into the
locker room leading 37-28. She
converted on 8 of 10 attempts in
the opening 20 minutes. None of
her teammates were in double fig
ures at intermission.
Stanford seemed unable to get
any rhythm. The Washington
State defense was tough in the
early going, often denying Stan
ford players the ball. When the
Cardinal did get the ball where it
wanted, the shooter oftentimes
shot a flat-footed jumper without
much arc.
That meant most of Stanford's
shots rimmed out. Excluding
Zeilstra, the Cardinal shot just 35
percent for the half.

Stanford's slow start didn't
please VanDerveer. "I was a little
disappointed," she said. "[I felt]
with a day in between (games),
we could come out and play with
a little more intensity."
Despite finishing with a 42-27
edge in rebounds, VanDerveer
didn't feel the Cardinal crashed
the boards hard enough.
In the second half, though, the
Cardinal turned it up a notch.
"We took better shots . . . set real
good screens," VanDerveer said.
But the Cougars stayed tough.
They trimmed the lead to four
two minutes into the half. Stan
ford opened the margin to nine
at 52-43. Then Kristal Stahl
buried a three-pointer from 22
feet to cut it to six.
Meanwhile, on just about every
other possession, Stahl's team
mate Angie Miller was sinking
shots from everywhere. Like
Zeilstra, Miller finished with 27,
including four three-pointers.

With Stanford on a 6-0 run and
leading 58-46, Miller hit a three
to cut the lead to single digits.
Stanford then scored four un
answered points before Miller
again swished a three to make it
62-52.
At the 9:04 mark, Miller hit
another jumper, this time for two
points, to trim the margin to 64-
54. It turned out to be the
Cougars' last gasp, however.
Stanford reeled off nine straight
points, including four by Whiting.
The freshman center helped fuel
Stanford's charge in the second
half with her rebounding. "I love
the contribution Val makes off the
bench," VanDerveer said.
When the dust settled, the score
was Stanford 73, Washington
State 56, and the clock showed
seven minutes left to play.
Card notes
The most unusual statistics from
the game came in the three-point de
partment. Despite being one of the
top three-point shooting teams in the
country, Stanford was only 2 of 7
from behind the arc.
