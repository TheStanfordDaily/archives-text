# Card women can still play better
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
If you're coaching a team
that's 13-0 and ranked No. 2 in
the nation, you might sit back,
relax and enjoy the show.
Unless, of course, you're
Stanford women's basketball
Coach Tara VanDerveer. Always
cautious and concerned, Van-
Derveer continues to search for
a new play, a different combi
nation or a way of motivating
the team in hopes that she can
bring home a national champi
onship in 1990.
Coming off a sound drubbing
of Washington State Saturday,
VanDerveer spoke of how
pleased she was with her power
forward/center troika of Trisha
Stevens, Julie Zeilstra and Val
Whiting.
It wasn't so much Zeilstra's
27-point effort that night, nor
Whiting's double-double in
points and rebounds that Van-
Derveer was talking about. She
wasn't speaking of the fact that
all three are shooting over 50
percent, either. Instead, it was
the more general way in which
all three players seem to give a
lift, to the team when they are
on the court.

With the three players rotat
ing in at two positions, everyone
is always well rested. The fact
that Whiting, who isn't a
starter, enters the game without
causing a dropoff gives VanDer
veer confidence in playing any
two of the three players.
But the biggest benefit is that
none of them is shouldering too
large a burden or playing too
many minutes. When the NCAA
Tournament rolls around,
Stevens, Zeilstra and Whiting
will all be well rested.
For Jennifer Azzi, Sorya Hen
ning and Katy Steding, though,
that might not be the case. Van-
Derveer explained that she was
looking to get them the same
kind of bench help that the post
players have.
"It's not that Sor\ja, Jennifer
and Katy aren't doing well," she
said. "(It's just thatl they can
be more effective with seme
rest.
"We need to develop on the
perimeter (the bench support]
we have in the post," VanDer
veer added.
It's not that the talent is lack
ing. Senior Stacy Parson, soph
omore Martha Richards and
freshman Val Whiting all have

the capability of coming into a
game and making a difference.
So far, they haven't, though.
"It would've been great if
Stacy had come in and given us
a spurt (tonight)," VanDerveer
said after the game, noting that
Parson has done so many times
in the past.
When it was suggested that
the perimeter players might
need more minutes to find some
consistency, VanDerveer spoke
of needing to prove that in prac
tice.
She said the players have to
develop confidence in them
selves for her to be confident
with them, acknowledging the
circularity of the situation.
More generally, VanDerveer
spoke of wanting to see more
involvement and intensity from
everyone. "We've got to get
everyone involved in moving
and screening," she said. "We've
got to make a stronger commit
ment to defense."
She said she wanted the team
to be in better physical shape
and to be less predictable on
offense.
There are a lot of "problems"
with the Cardinal as VanDer
veer sees it. Fortunately, losing
isn't one of them.
