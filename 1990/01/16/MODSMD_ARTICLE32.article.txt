# Grapplers win UC-Davis Invite

Downpours and traffic snarls were the only factors
that almost stopped the Cardinal wrestling squad,
but neither was quite enough.
Air Force, Chico State and a plethora of other
invitational squads probably wished it had been
• aining just a little harder or that traffic had been
even worse on Interstate 80 this past weekend.

Cardinal wins the Aggie Invitational.
Because once Stanford reached the UC-Davis
campus Friday afternoon, it showed no mercy. The
Cardinal handily defeated both the Falcons and the
Wildcats Friday, raising its dual meet record to 5-2,
then olawed back for a win in the Aggie Invitational
Saturday.
Although Air Force posed no problem for the
Cardinal in the squads' dual competition, the Fal
cons were a bit more stubborn the following day,
almost destroying Stanford's sweep. Air Force qual
ified seven, to Stanford's five, wrestlers for the
invitational's finals, putting the Cardinal at an im
mediate disadvantage.
As each match progressed Stanford climbed a
little farther out of its hole, and the tournament
came down to the last match: Ail-American Steve
Buddie versus a Falcon competitor at 177 lbs.
Buddie, the Cardinal's most consistent as well as
most valuable wrestler, won the match on a technical
fall, which not only gave him his third victory of
the weekend but also handed Stanford the tourna
ment championship by a point and a half. Stanford
124 Air Force 123. Chico State took third and San
Francisco State followed in fourth.
"He (Steve) spanked him pretty badly," Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel said. "Buddie was the most
outstanding wrestler of the tournament, the week
end and this season."
In addition to Buddie, co-captain Ron Perry also
won his division in the Aggie Invitational, cruising
to victory at 190 lbs. 142-pounder
James Dinette, 158-pounder Matt
Topham and newly-converted
167-pounder Mat Nowlis all
placed second in their weight divi
sions. Dave Sachs (134 lbs) and
Trent Smith (heavyweight) took
third places.
According to Horpel, the squad
achieved exactly what it had set
out to do at the tournament. "We
identified areas where individuals
have weaknesses and also made
progress. It was nice to win as
well — frosting on the cake."
After almost not arriving in
time for its dual meets Friday,
the Cardinal had no problem with
either the Falcons or the Wildcats,
despite the fact that the squad
did not have enough time to
warm-up and had weighed-in that
morning.
Stanford first downed Air Force
28-10, winning all but three
weight classes, and then followed
with a 27-9 thrashing of Chico
State.
"Looking back, we looked great,
but at the time I thought we
didn't seem particularly impres
sive," Horpel added. "It was the
first time we weighed in and
wrestled on the same day, and we
were late, so these still seemed
like factors, even though we were
winning. But now I think I just
wasn't giving the other teams
enough credit."
All regular starters competed
Friday except 167-pounder Mark
Graham, who was out with a knee
injury. Junior Nowlis, a former
competitor at 158 lbs., filled in
and won both dual meets in his
first competition at this weight
class.
"Overall, we wrestled really
well, the best we have all year,"
Horpel said. "We just keep looking
better."
