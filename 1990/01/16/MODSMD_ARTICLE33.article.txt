# Women's swim team dissolves Wolverines
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
After opening the season with
an easy win over UC-Santa Bar
bara last week, the theory was
that the Cardinal women's swim
team would receive the year's first
"real" test against sixth-ranked
Michigan over the weekend.
So much for the theory.
Top-ranked Stanford destroyed
the Wolverines 78-33 in a dual
meet in Ann Arbor Saturday night
after dominating Michigan in a
set of exhibition races the day
before.
"I think we had real good
swims," Coach Richard Quick
said. "For the most part we had
people perform at Michigan this
year as well as they did against
Texas last year, which puts us
about three weeks ahead of
schedule."
That is, three weeks ahead of
the schedule that took the team
to the NCAA title last year.
Friday the teams swam the
events that are not swum in dual
meets, and the Cardinal won
every event. Freshman Janet
Evans won both the 400-yaid in
dividual medley and the 1650 free
style, classmate Janel Jorgensen
took the 100 butterfly and fresh
man Lori Heisick won the 100
breaststroke for the Cardinal.
Senior Susannah Miller was
also a winner Friday, taking the
100 backstroke. Stanford also won
the 200 and 800 freestyle relays
and the 200 medley relay.
Saturday the teams swam a reg
ular dual meet, with Stanford
jumping on top early. Miller,
Heisick, Suzy Buckovich and Jor
gensen won the 400 medley relay,
the day's first event.

Sophomores Karen Kraemer
and Eva Mortensen then went one
two in the 1000 freestyle before
Michigan's Kathy Deiblpr and
Gwen DeMaat returned the favor,
edging Evans in the 200 freestyle.
Jamie Rugless garnered points
for the Cardinal with a second in
the 50 freestyle before Jorgensen,
Dede Trimble and Michelle
Griglione swept the 200 IM.
Senior Katie Connors then won
the one-meter diving competition,
a coup considering that Michigan
has been one of the top national
powers in diving for years.
Jorgensen, Griglione and Rug
less then swept the 200 butterfly
and Buckovich won the 100 free
style. Stanford continued to ex
tend its lead as Trimble and Miller
went one-two in the 200 back
stroke, and Evans and Mortensen
did the same in the 500 freestyle.
In the 200 breaststroke, Mich
igan's Ann Colloton, the defending
NCAA champ, beat Stanford's Jill
Johnson, last year's NCAA
runner-up, by .63 seconds.
Heisick, who was too sick to com
pete the previous week against
UCSB, recorded a lifetime best in
that event.
Quick was pleased with almost
all of the performances and feels
optimistic about this team's
chances of defending the NCAA
title. Stanford travels south this
weekend to swim against USC Fri
day and UCLA Saturday. The
team then returns home to meet
Arizona State Jan. 26.
