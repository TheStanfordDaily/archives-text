Purdue, a Big Ten
darkhorse when the season
began, joined The Associ
ated Press Top 25 basketball
poll on Monday after
surprise victories over two
of its higher-ranked confer
ence rivals.
The Boilermakers, in be
coming the fifth Big Ten
team among this week's Top
25, have made an an aston
ishing turnaround from a
year ago when the school
suffered its first losing
season since 1966.
"It makes us feel good to
know that what we have
been doing is right," Purdue
coach Gene Keady said.
"Last year was pretty disap
pointing. But we've matured
a lot, and we've corrected
some of our problems. Now
we just have to continue to
improve."
Purdue, No. 3 in the final
poll of the 1987-88 season,
was unranked and 15-16 last
year. The Boilermakers re
turned three starters, and
their only losses in 13 games
this season were to Long
Beach State and Arizona.
Big Ten victories over
Northwestern, Indiana and
Minnesota put them into a
first-place tie with Michigan
State.
"We're certainly happy
about being ranked," said
Keady, who has a 204-87
record and has won or
shared three Big Ten titles
in his 10 years as coach.
"The kids have worked hard,
and after beating two Top
20 teams, one on the road,
I definitely feel we deserve
it."
Minnesota dropped from
16th to 22nd in the new poll
after its 86-78 loss at
Purdue last Thursday.
