# Davis scores only 15 points
## Spikers annihilate Aggies in season opener 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Technically speaking, the 1990
No. 1-ranked Stanford men's vol
leyball team is winless in the cur
rent season. Because the squad's
weekend competition was a prac
tice tournament and last night's
match against club team UC-
Davis was unofficial, the Cardinal
remains an early 0-0. Wary oppo
nents throughout the country,
however, are prudently not fooled.

Men's Volleyball

Cardinal 15 15 15
Aggies 2 7 6

The Cardinal, in fact, offered
much for competitors to freneti
cally ponder this past holiday
weekend after its two split-squad
teams decisively seized first and
second place in its Saturday
round-robin tournament and then
united to thrash the UC-Davis
Aggies yesterday 15-2, 15-7, 15-6.
The established starting six —
John Alstrom, Duncan Blackman,
Dave Goss, Craig Forsyth, Dan
Hanan and Parker Blackman —
comprised Stanford's first team
at the exhibition competition
featuring California and Long
Beach State and satisfied expec
tations by compiling a
tournament-best 6-3 individual
game score.
The second team, consisting of
Ryan Moos, Jimmy Klein, Jimmy
Blackman, John Hribar, Mike
Lowe and John Bezmalinovic, of
fered visible proof of the Card's
quality bench by amassing a 5-4
overall tournament game score. In
the process, the second team
placed ahead of the first teams
from both Cal and nationally
ranked Long Beach.
"The team played well to
gether," Coach Fred Sturm said.
"We showed the best depth we
have ever had."
John Alstrom led the Cardinal

demolition of Davis, recording a
team high seven kills and two
blocks as he and his teammates
held the Aggies to a paltry 15
total points throughout the three
games. Playing in his first inter
collegiate volleyball match after
red-shirting his freshman year,
rookie sensation Dave Goss con
nected on an impressive six kills
while thoroughly awing the crowd
with his vertical leap, jump serve
and what Sturm labels as sheer
"firepower."
"Personally, I feel pretty good
about my first collegiate match,"
Goss said. "But I still have a long
way to go."
Alstrom and Goss wasted little
time in disrupting the Aggie at
tack. After an early exchange of
side-outs in the first game of the
match, Goss served an ace that
extended the Cardinal to a 4-1
advantage. Hanan, Alstrom and
Goss each contributed side-out
kills in another prolonged ex
change of possessions, but
Alstrom's short ace at 6-2 perma
nently turned the tide in Stan
ford's favor.
Following a time out by Davis,
Forsyth served the Cardinal to a
12-2 lead at which point Davis
Coach Kendall Mix ceased play
once again. Parker Blackman
served out the first game rout.
The same six returned in the
second game. After falling behind
2-0 early, the Cardinal streaked
to a 10-4 advantage on a vicious
Forsyth kill. The accomplished
middle blocker dominated the
remainder of the game with two
consecutive blocks and a kill to
make the score an unreachable
14-7.
Sturm confidently replaced the
whole lineup in the final game,
playing the group of players that
comprised his second team on Sat
urday.
Sparked by six kills at the hands
of Mike Lowe and game-turning
play by Bezmalinovic, the Cardi
nal eased to a 15-6 dusting.
