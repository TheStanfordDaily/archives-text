# Despite Michigan loss, 'unshaven' Stanford pleased with progress
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
When Michigan Coach Jon Ur
banchek walked out of Canham
Auditorium Saturday evening
with his nine-year undefeated
home streak still intact, he prob

ably was hiding a smile of relief.
As he bade farewell to the Stan
ford men's swimming team after
watching his Wolverines escape
with a 61-52 victory, Urbanchek
knew he would be watching the
same swimmers — performing
under quite different circum

stances — at the NCAA
Championships in March.
"The swimming was impres
sively fast," Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney said. "We just didn't quite
have enough guns at this point in
the season."
With a squad partially depleted

by illness and finances, the Car
dinal, falling for the first time in
a dual meet this season, still swam
well enough to record 24 season
bests in unshaved swims. Senior
Rick Gould led Stanford by be
coming the fourth Cardinal swim
mer to qualify for NCAAs with

his 50.11 time in the 100-yard
backstroke.
"We were extremely pleased
with the way we swam," Kenney
said. "Of course, we always like
to win, but we made good progress
by having the team swim faster
unshaved than we have in the
past."
Last year, Urbanchek had to
watch his Wolverines overtake the
Cardinal 60-53 at deGuerre Pool
in the final race of the day, the
medley relay. This season, the
meet was already decided in the
next-to-last event, the 200-yard
breaststroke.
However, both squads dove full
steam into the medley relay and
then were able to look back at the
scoreboard, which showed the two
fastest times in the nation re
corded this season for that event.
The Cardinal relay team finished
in 3:19.10, about a second behind
the Wolverine time of 3:18.05.
"We went out and posted a 19-
flat, which wins dual meets any
day, and they went 18-flat," Ken
ney said. "We swam great and
still lost that medley."
The Michigan divers, two of
whom dive for the U.S. National
Team, were but another obstacle
the Cardinal had to conquer.
Despite being unable to upset
the premier diving squad in the
country, Cardinal freshmen Rich
ard Endriss, Mark Kraus and
Brad Wightman performed well
enough to leave the pool with new
found confidence.
"The divers ran into a buzz
saw," Kenney said. "But our three

Stanford came out of the blocks strong against Michigan, but the Wolverines prevailed in a close dual meet, splashing the Cardinal 61-52.
