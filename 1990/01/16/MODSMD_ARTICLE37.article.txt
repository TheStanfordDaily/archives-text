# Gymnasts find positives in loss to Boise State
## 
### Patrick Tower 
You know it's going to be a
bad meet when. ..
Your 6:45 p.m. flight is held
up and doesn't leave until 2 a.m.
The rental car office is closed
when your flight gets in.
You're forced to eat a cold
breakfast when you wake up be
cause the grill at the hotel
restaurant is broken.
And the runway for the vault
feels like it has about as much
traction as a slip 'n' slide.
The only thing is, the Stanford
women's gymnastics squad did
not have a bad meet.
"There were a million reasons
for us not to do well, but we
had a solid meet," Coach Breck
Greenwood said. "They (the
gymnasts) faced a lot of adver
sity, but they handled it very
well."
In the final tally, the Cardinal
lost the meet by the score of
182.1 to 179.3, but the numbers
don't tell the whole story of the
meet.
"We're about where we ex
pected to be at this point,"
Greenwood said. "In the next
week, we'll be adding more dif
ficulty to the routines, and we'll
automatically be better by at
least two or three points. We're
on the verge of being very good
in a very short time."
Greenwood added, "In
dividually, everyone did what she
was supposed to. The mistakes
we did have.. .weren't the types
of things that could really be
avoided." Senior captain Susan
Banta highlighted the Cardinal
performance and was given the
"meet hero" award by the squad.
Informed only shortly before
the meet that she would be com-

Women's Gymnastics

Broncos 182.1

peting on bars, Banta scored an
8.9 to place sixth in the event,
and in her first beam routine in
a meet since freshman year, she
scored a 9.1 in exhibition beam,
which is scored but not included
in the standings. Her score
would have earned her fourth
place in the event.
In addition, freshman Erin
McCann had a strong debut for
the Cardinal. She was the
leading performer in all-around,
placing fourth with a score in
36.30. She also tied for second
on vault with a 9.20 and finished
fourth on bars with a 9.05, a
score which the coaching staff
thought was low.
Senior Dina Amoroso also had
a good meet, posting a 9.30 to
place second on balance beam,
while compiling a 36.25 all
around, good enough for fifth
place. In addition, she tied for
fourth with McCann on floor ex
ercise with a score of 9.35. Stan
ford's other all-around
competitor, Jennifer Bloom,
placed seventh with a 36.05.
The Broncos should serve as
a good gauge of the Cardinal's
progress throughout the season.
The two teams meet each other
at five different meets this year.
On a down note, Stanford will
be without the services of soph
omore Doe Yamashiro, who an
nounced that she was quitting
the team as of Monday. "She
decided she had had enough of
gymnastics," Greenwood said.

Senior Becky Ashton finished in a tie for sixth as Stanford dropped its season opener to Boise
State Saturday by a score of 182.1 to 179.3. In addition to the loss to Boise State, Stanford lost
sophomore Doe Yamashiro, a national team member, who announced that she was quitting the
team. Coach Breck Greenwood said that Yamashiro was tired of gymnastics.
