# Stark, Solomon star at Invite

If a chain is only as strong
as its weakest link, nobody is
going to be breaking the Stan
ford men's tennis team this year.
A Cardinal team, composed of
freshman Jonathan Stark, soph
omore Alex O'Brien and juniors
Jason Yee and Glenn Solomon,
showed depth and dominance
this past week at the National
Collegiate Tennis Classic in
Palm Springs as Stark placed
second in the main draw and
Solomon won the consolation
bracket.
Stark, who earlier in the
season took second at the Volvo
All-American Invitational, once
again bowed out in the finals,
losing 6-3, 6-2 to Miami's Conny
Falk.
"I didn't serve as well as I
had in the previous matches,
and he returned really well.
That was basically the differ
ence right there," said Stark,
who was seeded first at the In
vite.
During the tournament, Stark
upended the defending NCAA
champion, Donni Leaycraft of
LSU, 7-5, 6-1. But perhaps even
more impressive than Stark's

'I had played six matches prior to the
consolation finals, so my body was not In
the greatest shape. Fortunately, It was the
type of day when everything clicked, when
everything went my way.'

trip to the finals was the per
formance of Solomon. After
losing to Falk 6-4, 6-4, Solomon
traipsed through the backdraw,
eventually beating John Yancey
of Kentucky for the title, 6-4,
6-2.
"I was incredibly tired and
sore going into that last match,"
Solomon said. "I had played six
matches prior to the consolation
finals, so my body was not in
the greatest shape. Fortunately,
it was the type of day when
everything clicked, when every
thing way."
"Everyone had their mo
ments," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "For Stark, two
finals in two tournaments —
that's just outstanding for a
freshman. And Glenn Solomon
deserves a tremendous amount

of credit. After playing in some
of the toughest matches I have
seen, to come back and win the
consolation. .. . that was just a
tremendous accomplishment."
O'Brien, who won a Volvo re
gional tournament late last year
and was seeded fourth entering
last week's Invite, also played
well but was ousted in the sec
ond round by Tom Furukrantz
of LSU, 7-6, 6-2.
Yee also did some damage in
the tournament, beating third
seed and former Stanford
nemesis Jason Netter of UCLA,
7-5, 7-6. In the quarterfinals,
Yee lost a close match to USC's
Donny Isaak 6-2, 7- 5. "He (Yee)
had two outstanding wins,"
Gould said. "He deserves a lot
of credit as well."
