## Flabby Foreman floors punch-drunk Cooney 
### 
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -
George Foreman, the evangelist
who says he never throws a punch
in anger, bludgeoned Gerry
Cooney to the floor twice and
knocked him out in the second
round Monday night at the Con
vention Center.
While there might not have
been anger in Foreman, there cer
tainly was more power than
Cooney could handle. When he hit
the floor in the middle of the ring
the second time, referee Joe Cor
tez didn't even bother to count,
waving his arm that the scheduled
10-round bout was over.
The end came at 1:57 of the
second round.
It was the 20th straight victory
and 19th knockout for the 41-
year-old Foreman since he ended
a 10-year retirement in 1987.
Foreman has said he wants to
challenge unbeaten heavyweight
champion Mike Tyson, and Mon
day night's victory certainly didn't
hurt his chances.
The loss should send Cooney
into retirement. The 33-year-old
New Yorker was fighting for the
first time since he was knocked
out in the fifth round by Michael
Spinks in the same building on

June 15, 1987.
Foreman, the 253Vfe-pound
former heavyweight champion
who became an evangelist after
losing to Jimmy Young in 1977,
had an edge in the first round
when he landed a couple of solid
head shots and knocked out
Cooney's mouthpiece with a jar
ring left jab with about one min
ute gone in the fight.
Cooney fought well in the first
round, landing some left jabs and
several hooks as he circled trying
to stay out of Foreman's power
punching range.
"People have been getting down
on me because I haven't been
finishing my opponents cleanly,"
Foreman said. "I thought I'd come
out throwing punches and get it
over with quickly."
Foreman found the range in the
second round, and after about a
minute he caught Cooney with a
short left hook that hurt the 231-
pound Irishman. He followed with
three or four punches to the head,
and Cooney went down in his cor
ner, struggling up at the count of
four.
"The idea is to win, and I try
to win by a KO. I try to land a
proper punch to get a knockout,"

Foreman had said of his boxing
philosophy.
The proper punches were a left
uppercut and right that dropped
Cooney in a heap in the middle
of the ring.
After Cooney got up, he stag
gered about the ring and had to
be led to his corner, where he sat
for several moments.
Foreman said he came out of
retirement to earn some money
for his Houston youth center.
Monday night's $1 million guar
antee put his comeback earnings
at about $2 million and the vic
tory put him in line to earn much
more.
It was the 65th victory and 61st
KO against two losses for
Foreman, who won the heavy
weight title on a second-round
knockout of Joe Frazier in 1973.
He defended the title twice, then
lost it when knocked out in the
eighth round by Muhammad Ali
in 1974.
It certainly wasn't a ftin night
for Cooney, who said he had come
back because he didn't feel it was
the real Gerry Cooney who lost
to Spinks. The devastating defeat
was Cooney's third against 28 vic
tories, 24 by knockout.
