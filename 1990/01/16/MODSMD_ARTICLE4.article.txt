# Webb Ranch workers may receive local union support to strike
## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
The San Mateo County Labor Council
last week voted to move toward giving
strike sanction to the workers at Webb
Ranch in their fight against ranch man
agement.
Strike sanction from the council will
give the ranch workers the support of
local labor unions represented by the
council if the farm workers decide to go
on strike against Webb Ranch.
The council decision does not, however,
automatically grant council approval for
a future strike. Instead, the council gave
its executive secretary, Art Pulaski, who

has been participating in the negotiations
between Webb Ranch and the United
Stanford Workers, the power to officially
grant sanction to the workers.
Before giving Webb workers strike
sanction, Pulaski must determine that
the ranch workers can achieve their goals
of better treatment by no other method
than a strike, he said.
According to Pulaski, the council is a
"microcosm of the national AFL-CIO."
It represents about 70,000 workers in
local unions.
Last week's council decision is not a
call for the ranch workers to strike. But
if the workers and the USW eventually
decide that a strike is necessary, the

strike sanction "releases the full force
and effect of our support," Pulaski said.
The USW and Webb have been
negotiating over the workers' living con
ditions since last April, when the workers
overwhelmingly voted to join the union.
A strike may be more likely due to a
recent Webb Ranch proposal to completely
eliminate worker housing.
Webb family attorney Terrence
O'Connor insisted last week that the
housing proposal had nothing to do with
ongoing negotiations with the USW, but
the union disagrees. Webb Ranch cannot
unilaterally remove housing without bar
gaining with the USW, Barnette said.
A strike is not likely to occur in the

immediate future, according to USW field
representative Rodney Barnette. "We
want to negotiate," he said, but main
tained that a strike "is one of the op
tions."
If management and workers fail to
agree in bargaining, then the USW "will
do something on our own, like a strike
or a boycott," Barnette said.
Pulaski also said that there would be
no immediate need for a strike, even
though "the bargaining is going at a very
slow pace."
Pulaski sparked controversy last week
as the USW and Webb Ranch officials
sat down in the first bargaining session
of the year. O'Connor, who represented

Webb Ranch at the negotiations, refused
to accept Pulaski as a member of the
USW bargaining team, Pulaski said.
After about an hour of standing outside
the negotiating room, O'Connor finally
withdrew his objections to Pulaski's pres
ence and agreed to return to the table.
In a Jan. 5 letter to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, Pulaski chastised
Webb Ranch for "thinking associated with
the 18th century" in its housing threats
to the workers. He also attacked Webb
Ranch for hiring "an attorney (O'Connor)
from the notorious Western Growers As
sociation that has conducted anti-union
campaigns of intimidation and
harassment."
Ranch proprietor Gary Webb
could not be reached over the
weekend for comment.
Pulaski also called upon the
University to have a greater role
in the bargaining. "I strongly urge
[Stanford] to intervene and stop
this injustice fostered by Webb
Ranch," he said in the letter.
University public affairs officer
Steven Peeps said he could not
speculate on whether the Univer
sity would intervene in the dispute
between Webb Ranch and its
workers if the workers decided to
strike. But he said he would be
"very surprised" if the University
changed its policy in the Webb
Ranch case.
University policy states that
Stanford will not interfere with
the internal matters of private
businesses such as Webb Ranch
that operate on University prop
erty.
"Sure, we'll strike," said
Manuel Chavez, a former Webb
Ranch laborer.
