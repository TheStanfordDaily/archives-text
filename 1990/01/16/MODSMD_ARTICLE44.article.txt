## East Palo Alto rally supports anti-drug activist 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Saturday's heavy rain could not
extinguish the pride and deter
mination of East Palo Alto resi
dents who attended a rally in sup
port of C.W. Roddy, an anti-drug
activist who has been the target
of three violent attacks this
month.
Roddy was wounded on New
Year's Day when semiautomatic
weapons were fired into her home
on Westminster Street, an area
popular with drug dealers. Last
Wednesday, Roddy's car was
damaged when another vehicle
ran into it, and the following day,
unlit Molotov cocktails were
thrown into her backyard.

About 75 people, including ap
proximately 15 members of the
Guardian Angels and several
reporters, gathered in front of
Roddy's house on Saturday to lis
ten to speeches and poems and to
express their determination to
"take back our streets." The
Guardian Angels have been
patrolling the street since the
attacks began.
Roddy herself spoke of the need
to "save the future" by "asking
drugs to leave." She drew ap
plause when she told the crowd
"we can get rid of the drugs."
In spite of the downpour, the
mood of the crowd was hopeful
and positive. They responded en
thusiastically when San Mateo
County Supervisor Tom Nolan

told them, "We will win."
Elena Becks, a lifelong resident
of East Palo Alto and a member
of Stanford's Committee on Black
Performing Arts, told the crowd
that "it is important for every one
of us to take a stand."
Becks called for more police in
East Palo Alto and said that the
community must organize and pa
trol the streets. She asked, "Who
is going to take dealers off the
streets?" and the crowd responded
loudly, "We are!"
Becks later called the rally "a
start" but said that more common
effort is needed on the part of
East Palo Alto residents to combat
the influence of drugs.
Louis Jackson, vice chair of the
Black Student Union, also spoke,

expressing the support of the BSU
for the residents of East Palo Alto.
He said later that although the
BSU has no concrete plans for
helping fight drugs in East Palo
Alto, "we're putting our heads to
gether to come up with some
thing."
William Vines, mayor of East
Palo Alto, called the rally "a good
beginning" but stressed that the
struggle against drugs must con
tinue.
Vines emphasized the need for
the community to "work as a team
to eliminate crime" and to "say
to [ drug dealers], 'yÂ° u cannot
have it!' " He also praised Roddy's
"courage and strength."
The rally included a march
around the block, during which

the crowd, surrounded by Guard
ian Angels, chanted, "Dealers out!
Crack out!" and "Take back our
street! Take back our homes!"
Several of the Guardian Angels
carried signs saying "Bust the
Thugs and Burn the Drugs" and
"All Out War on Drugs."
Members of the community
showed their appreciation for
Roddy's efforts, telling her, "We
are proud of you, we love you, we
support you."
Residents also called for more
people to get involved in East Palo
Alto's war against drugs. One
woman read several poems she
had written, including one titled,
"We need unity in our communi
ty."
