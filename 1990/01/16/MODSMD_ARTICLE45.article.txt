# Sorority 'rushes' to fill membership quota
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
The Gamma Phi Beta sorority
will hold a three-day informal
ruth for all upperclass women be
ginning Thursday, since the
sorority did not meet its rush
quota last spring.
The quota is set by the Univer
sity, and sororities that do not
meet their designated quotas are
eligible to hold an informal rush
the following year. Between the
two rushes, the sorority is not on
any kind of suspension.

According to Gamma Phi pres
ident Dawn McGuiness, only six
people pledged Gamma Phi Betas
last year, bringing the total mem
bership up to 20. That was nine
below the sorority's quota.
This week's informal rush will
be the sorority's third since it was
reorganized and brought back on
campus in 1987. It is currently
the smallest sorority at Stanford,
McGuiness said.
An informational meeting will
be held Thursday at 7 p.m. in the
Old Union Clubhouse. On Satur
day, the Gamma Phis will hold an

all-day open house in Building
380, where sorority members will
be available to meet with prospec
tive pledges and answer any ques
tions.
To help out with the rush, the
Gamma Phi Beta International
has sent its own representatives
to Stanford. The officers will
remain here to help train the
pledge class and assist in formal
rush during the spring.
"For the last three informal
rushes, nationals didn't come on
campus, but we felt we needed a
little more support financially, so

we contacted them," said Muffy
Lincoln, Gamma Phi rush chair.
According to Lee Ann
Herdman, the Gamma Phis' in
ternational collegiate consultant,
the national group "wants to beef
up the system, and we're at a
critical point ... in installing the
[Gamma Phi] colony," Herdman
said.
The national officers have been
in charge of organizing public re
lations, staffing information
tables in White Plaza, talking with
prospective recruits and printing
posters for the sorority.
