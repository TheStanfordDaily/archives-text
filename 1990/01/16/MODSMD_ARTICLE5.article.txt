# Frosh advisers offer their best
## Pre-major advising not perfect, but shows growing commitment 
### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
What do the assistant to the
University President, an assis
tant dean of admissions and an
assistant dean of the Chapel
have in common (besides all
being assistants)?
They and many other faculty
members from a wide range of
offices and departments have
volunteered to be freshman ad
visers.
Over the past four years, the
advising center has gradually
been changing its methods of
recruiting advisers. While the
center once asked for a certain
number of faculty to commit
from each department, it now
asks potential advisers to sign
up exclusively on a voluntary
basis.
"No one has his or her arms
twisted," said Andr6e Sursock,
assistant director of the Under
graduate Advising Center. "If

the advisers are advising, it's
because they want to be advis
ing, and they really want to do
a good job."
As a result, freshmen seem to
be more satisfied with their ad
visers than before, Sursock said.
Previously, some faculty mem
bers who were compelled to
counsel students often had
strained relationships with their
advisees.
"I don't hear that anymore.
There's more of an acknowl
edgement of the positive," she

said.
Most advisers, who are as
signed five to seven freshmen
each, attend voluntary training
sessions over the summer to
better understand the mechan
ics of academic planning.
Although most matches work
out well, not all are perfect, Sur
sock said. Some students have
trouble grasping that an adviser
is a general resource, rather
than a "walking 'Courses and
Degrees,'" she explained.
Though all advisers try to as
sist freshmen by pointing them
to the proper resources, some
are more successful than others.
"Even if you accept that they
won't be walking 'Courses and
Degrees,' there's still room for
improvement" in many advisers,
said fifth-year senior Sophia
Colamarino, who has been an
advising associate for four years.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the
President, noted that the need to
improve advising services has
been perennial.
"It's a rare job in which one
has universal success, and advis
ing is no different," said Hamrdla,
who is now in his 23rd year of
advising.
When Hamrdla graduated from
Stanford in 1960, he felt that the
advising system was incomplete.
"One of the things that I sort of
fantasized as an undergraduate
was being an adviser and doing
it the way it ought to' be done,"
he said.
Upon joining Stanford's staff,
Hamrdla got his chance.
In response to a request by the
newly-created office of the dean
of Undergraduate Studies,
Hamrdla established the Aca
demic Information Center.
Like its successor, the Under
graduate Advising Center, the Ac
ademic Information Center was
intended to provide counseling
and information to students.
"My concept was that whatever
an undergraduate wanted or
needed in terms of his or her ac
ademic life outside the major was
ours to do," Hamrdla said.
Similarly, in Hamrdla's view,
the function of an adviser is to
help the student define and fulfill
educational goals. But there is no
one way for advisers to achieve
this objective, he added.
"I personally have a religious
commitment to be at lunch in the
dorm once a week, although I
don't think that's necessarily ad
visable or appropriate for every
adviser," Hamrdla said. "It is for
me.
Ken and Anne Vosti are two
advisers who feel a similar obli
gation to their advisees.
Five years ago, Anne, an assis
tant dean of undergraduate ad

arena. Most students

need to be sup

missions, convinced her husband
Ken, a professor at the Medical
School, that the two of them
would be good advisers.
"Our children grew and left the
nest, and Mom decided it was time
to adopt some students," Ken said.
But Ken said he had reserva
tions since neither he nor Anne
had extensive knowledge of Stan
ford's undergraduate system.
After talking to then Under
graduate Advising Center director
Audrey Bernfield, the two were
convinced that their former mis
givings were invalid, and after five
years, their perspective on their
ability to assist freshmen has
changed.
"I think it's clear now that we
can contribute in many other
ways than in the academic arena,"
Ken said. "Most students are
prepared academically, but they
need to be supported."
"It is a big shock to come to a
place like this, where everyone
around you appears to be 50 times
brighter and to have done 50
times more things than you've
done," Anne added. "You need
every bit of encouragement that
you're a great individual."
By asking their advisees to eval
uate their performances, the
Vostis have learned to try differ
ent tactics. Still later, the Vostis
began to draw from the advising

center's handbook on advising.
"It was a couple of years before
we realized that the sort of infor
mation we were being provided
with by the [advising center] was
really wonderful," Ken said
Though they have become more
at ease as advisers, the Vostis still
have difficulty in determining the
extent to which students need ad
vising, Anne said.
Diana Akiyama, a second-year
adviser, said she has noticed that
"the way a freshman adviser can
be most helpful is to help students
make Stanford their home."
Akiyama, an assistant dean of
the Chapel and an ordained min
ister, worked as a counselor before

she entered the ministry. Thus,
she said it was only natural that
she started advising the same year
she started working at Stanford.
Akiyama said she felt comfort
able entering Stanford's advising
system so early because of its em
phasis on communication skills,
rather than in-depth knowledge
of individual academic programs.
"Part of my job is helping stu
dents not fight that process of
changing their minds, but helping
them integrate that into how they
learn about themselves instead,"
Akiyama said.
The advising center encourages
advisers to discuss more than is
sues of life and careers and to

impart some wisdom, said Civil
Engineering Prof. Gil Masters,
who has been a pre-major adviser
for 10 years.
Giving academic advice to stu
dents interested in engineering is
relatively simple, Masters said, ex
plaining that most prospective en
gineers enroll in Freshman
English, Physics, Calculus and
Cultures, Ideas and Values, with
possibly an additional elective.
Masters also counsels under
graduate and graduate engineer
ing students, but said he likes
advising freshmen the most,
"because they need and appreciate
the advice more."

Degrees,'" she explained.
Though all advisers try to as
sist freshmen by pointing them
to the proper resources, some
are more successful than others.
"Even if you accept that they
won't be walking 'Courses and
Degrees,' there's still room for
improvement" in many advisers,
said fifth-year senior Sophia
Colamarino, who has been an
advising associate for four years.
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the
President, noted that the need to
improve advising services has
been perennial.
"It's a rare job in which one
has universal success, and advis
ing is no different," said Hamrdla,
who is now in his 23rd year of
advising.
When Hamrdla graduated from
Stanford in 1960, he felt that the
advising system was incomplete.
"One of the things that I sort of
fantasized as an undergraduate
was being an adviser and doing
it the way it ought to' be done,"
he said.
Upon joining Stanford's staff,
Hamrdla got his chance.
In response to a request by the
newly-created office of the dean
of Undergraduate Studies,
Hamrdla established the Aca
demic Information Center.
Like its successor, the Under
graduate Advising Center, the Ac
ademic Information Center was
intended to provide counseling
and information to students.
"My concept was that whatever
an undergraduate wanted or
needed in terms of his or her ac
ademic life outside the major was
ours to do," Hamrdla said.
Similarly, in Hamrdla's view,
the function of an adviser is to
help the student define and fulfill
educational goals. But there is no
one way for advisers to achieve
this objective, he added.
"I personally have a religious
commitment to be at lunch in the
dorm once a week, although I
don't think that's necessarily ad
visable or appropriate for every
adviser," Hamrdla said. "It is for
me.
Ken and Anne Vosti are two
advisers who feel a similar obli
gation to their advisees.
Five years ago, Anne, an assis

missions, convinced her husband
Ken, a professor at the Medical
School, that the two of them
would be good advisers.
"Our children grew and left the
nest, and Mom decided it was time
to adopt some students," Ken said.
But Ken said he had reserva
tions since neither he nor Anne
had extensive knowledge of Stan
ford's undergraduate system.
After talking to then Under
graduate Advising Center director
Audrey Bernfield, the two were
convinced that their former mis
givings were invalid, and after five
years, their perspective on their
ability to assist freshmen has
changed.
"I think it's clear now that we
can contribute in many other
ways than in the academic arena,"
Ken said. "Most students are
prepared academically, but they
need to be supported."
"It is a big shock to come to a
place like this, where everyone
around you appears to be 50 times
brighter and to have done 50
times more things than you've
done," Anne added. "You need
every bit of encouragement that
you're a great individual."
By asking their advisees to eval
uate their performances, the
Vostis have learned to try differ
ent tactics. Still later, the Vostis
began to draw from the advising

center's handbook on advising.
"It was a couple of years before
we realized that the sort of infor
mation we were being provided
with by the [advising center] was
really wonderful," Ken said
Though they have become more
at ease as advisers, the Vostis still
have difficulty in determining the
extent to which students need ad
vising, Anne said.
Diana Akiyama, a second-year
adviser, said she has noticed that
"the way a freshman adviser can
be most helpful is to help students
make Stanford their home."
Akiyama, an assistant dean of
the Chapel and an ordained min
ister, worked as a counselor before

she entered the ministry. Thus,
she said it was only natural that
she started advising the same year
she started working at Stanford.
Akiyama said she felt comfort
able entering Stanford's advising
system so early because of its em
phasis on communication skills,
rather than in-depth knowledge
of individual academic programs.
"Part of my job is helping stu
dents not fight that process of
changing their minds, but helping
them integrate that into how they
learn about themselves instead,"
Akiyama said.
The advising center encourages
advisers to discuss more than is
sues of life and careers and to

impart some wisdom, said Civil
Engineering Prof. Gil Masters,
who has been a pre-major adviser
for 10 years.
Giving academic advice to stu
dents interested in engineering is
relatively simple, Masters said, ex
plaining that most prospective en
gineers enroll in Freshman
English, Physics, Calculus and
Cultures, Ideas and Values, with
possibly an additional elective.
Masters also counsels under
graduate and graduate engineer
ing students, but said he likes
advising freshmen the most,
"because they need and appreciate
the advice more."

Ken and Anne Vosti, Medical School professor and assistant dean of Undergraduate Studies, respec
tively, were encouraged to become freshman advisers by the Undergraduate Advising Center, which
has adopted a policy of recruiting potential advisers on a voluntary, rather than departmental, basis.
What do the assistant to the
University President, an assis
tant dean of admissions and an
assistant dean of the Chapel
have in common (besides all
being assistants)?
They and many other faculty
members from a wide range of
offices and departments have
volunteered to be freshman ad
visers.
Over the past four years, the
advising center has gradually
been changing its methods of
recruiting advisers. While the
center once asked for a certain
number of faculty to commit
from each department, it now
asks potential advisers to sign
up exclusively on a voluntary
basis.
"No one has his or her arms
twisted," said Andr6e Sursock,
assistant director of the Under
graduate Advising Center. "If

the advisers are advising, it's
because they want to be advis

a good job."
As a result, freshmen seem to
be more satisfied with their ad
visers than before, Sursock said.
Previously, some faculty mem
bers who were compelled to
counsel students often had
strained relationships with their
advisees.
"I don't hear that anymore.
There's more of an acknowl
edgement of the positive," she

said.
Most advisers, who are as
signed five to seven freshmen
each, attend voluntary training
sessions over the summer to
better understand the mechan
ics of academic planning.
Although most matches work
out well, not all are perfect, Sur
sock said. Some students have
