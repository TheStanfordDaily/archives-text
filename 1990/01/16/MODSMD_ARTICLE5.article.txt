# Frosh advisers offer their best
## Pre-major advising not perfect, but shows growing commitment

What do the assistant to the
University President, an assis
tant dean of admissions and an
assistant dean of the Chapel
have in common (besides all
being assistants)?
They and many other faculty
members from a wide range of
offices and departments have
volunteered to be freshman ad
visers.
Over the past four years, the
advising center has gradually
been changing its methods of
recruiting advisers. While the
center once asked for a certain
number of faculty to commit
from each department, it now
asks potential advisers to sign
up exclusively on a voluntary
basis.
"No one has his or her arms
twisted," said Andr6e Sursock,
assistant director of the Under
graduate Advising Center. "If

the advisers are advising, it's
because they want to be advis
ing, and they really want to do
a good job."
As a result, freshmen seem to
be more satisfied with their ad
visers than before, Sursock said.
Previously, some faculty mem
bers who were compelled to
counsel students often had
strained relationships with their
advisees.
"I don't hear that anymore.
There's more of an acknowl
edgement of the positive," she

said.
Most advisers, who are as
signed five to seven freshmen
each, attend voluntary training
sessions over the summer to
better understand the mechan
ics of academic planning.
Although most matches work
out well, not all are perfect, Sur
sock said. Some students have
trouble grasping that an adviser
is a general resource, rather
than a "walking 'Courses and
Degrees,'" she explained.
Though all advisers try to as
sist freshmen by pointing them
to the proper resources, some
are more successful than others.
"Even if you accept that they
won't be walking 'Courses and
Degrees,' there's still room for
improvement" in many advisers,
said fifth-year senior Sophia
Colamarino, who has been an
advising associate for four years.
