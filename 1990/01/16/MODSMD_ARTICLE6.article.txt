# Lobbying for a halt to deportation:
## Chinese students seek veto override 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
For Chinese students at Stan
ford, the crucial difference be
tween President Bush and
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is
simple: The president's decisions
can be overriden.
Currently, students here are at
tempting to take advantage of just
that difference.
They are actively lobbying Con
gress to override Bush's veto of
a bill that would waive the two
year home-country return re
quirement for Chinese students.
And some of them are facing the
prospect of prolonged limbo, re
gardless of the fate of the over
ride, because of Stanford's own
policies.
Chinese students on J-l visas
are required to return to their
homeland for two years after grad
uation before applying for a
change in status that would allow
them to work in the United
States.
When Bush vetoed the bill,

sponsored by Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif., in November, he intro
duced an administrative order
that has many of the same com
ponents as the Pelosi bill —
waiving the return requirement,
halting deportation procedures
and offering limited employment
authorization for Chinese stu
dents on the J-l visa.
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-
Stanford, said that the protections
offered under the two plans are
basically the same, but "the dif
ference is that the president's (ad
ministrative action] could change
the next day."
At the same time as they push
for an override that would change
federal law, some students are
filing for changes of status avail
able to them under Bush's admin
istrative order.
Chinese students echo Camp
bell's criticism of the instability
of the administrative action. Xu
Guanghan, a graduate student in
engineering, said that Bush ad
visers told leaders of the indepen
dent union of Chinese students

'We are really worried
that the president will
use us as a bargain
ing chip in his rela
tions with Beijing.'

that the president wanted to main
tain his flexibility in foreign
policy.
"What do you mean you are
flexible?" Xu asked, in reflection.
"Are you going to be flexible with
our lives?
"We are really worried that the
president will use us as a bargain
ing chip (in his relations with
Beijing]," Xu continued, "so we
want to make it law."
Chinese students are also con
cerned by the ambiguous legal
status of the president's order. Be
cause many of the administrative
action's provisions are in con
tradiction with immigration law,
it is open to legal challenge, which
could lead to a suspension of the
program during legal proceedings.
Another motive behind the
push for an override is the desire
to send a message to Beying. Both
students and legislators are
distressed by the administration's
kidgloves approach to the Chinese
leadership. The recent mission to
China by national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft, and the revela
tion of an earlier, secret visit,
anger students.
"Toasting the health of the
Beijing butchers is really in
tolerable," complained one Stan
ford graduate student who
requested anonymity. "Scowcroft
could have done better toasting
to peace on earth or something
like that."
Campbell takes issue with the
administration's position that its
diplomacy is paying off. "It is ap
parent that the Chinese govern
ment is not changing," he said.
"The plans for re-education of
students abroad if they return
home give me serious grounds for
worry about the safety of the stu
dents in the United States."
"If we can override the veto, it
will help pro-democracy forces in
China," Xu said. "The Chinese
government is comprised of two
kinds of people — conservatives
and reformers. The veto would
send a signal to the reformers'
side."
Campbell told The Daily last
week that he would vote in favor

of an override, saying it "would
send a very important signal
about the resolve of this country."
Campbell and others are opti
mistic about the chances of the
override attempt, given the unan
imous support enjoyed by the
Pelosi bill at its passage last No
vember.
"I think I can safely predict
that the veto will be overriden,"
he said. The override may be
among the first business the Con
gress takes up on its return Jan.

Chinese students at Stanford
have been active in the efforts to
pass the Pelosi bill. Xu himself
went to Washington to lobby leg
islators, an experience which led
him to agree with what former
U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz told a group of Chinese
students here: "Democracy is not
built for efficiency."
"We still believe in democracy,
but we know you cannot expect
everything to go smoothly or
swiftly," Xu said.
And, as Chinese students are
discovering, even a presidential
directive may not be enough to
make the Immigration and Nat
uralization Services bureaucracy
move swiftly or smoothly.
Because of Stanford's conserva
tive reading of Chinese govern
ment policy on permitting
students to study abroad, the
great mtyority of Chinese students
at Stanford hold J-l visas.
Marcia Makino, the Bechtel In
ternational Center's adviser for
foreign students, points out,
"Neither the Pelosi bill nor the
directive gives Chinese students
an edge to becoming permanent

residents. They do not have prior
ity for citizenship."
Right now, Chinese students
are investigating their options.
One graduate student reports that
a recent meeting held to discuss
the issue was one of the best
attended meetings among Chinese
students ever.
Although there is widespread
interest, so far few students have
actually filed for a change in
status. Only about 20 of the al
most 400 Chinese nationals at
Stanford have begun the process.
Last Wednesday, David Still, the
San Francisco immigration of
fice's contact person for questions
about the directive, came to Stan
ford to talk to a group of more
than 80 Chinese students. Several
concerns about interpretation of
Bush's order emerged at that
meeting.
One concern is the status of
vjsiting scholars and postdoctoral
students. Because Stanford, un
like other universities, requires
that its post doctoral students reg
ister as students, they are unable
to switch to a working visa. But
because the immigration service
frowns on their assuming student
status, they are unable to switch
to the F-l student visa that does
not require a return to the home
country.
Other universities consider post
doctoral students staff rather than
students.
Another concern is what will
happen after June 5, 1990, when
the president's earlier extended
departure program and the special
work authorization may lapse.
The president suspended deporta
tion procedures for Chinese stu

'The Chinese gov
ernment is com
prised of two kinds
of people — con
servatives and
reformers. The
veto would send a
signal to the
reformers' side.'

dents following the Tiananmen
Square massacre.
Still had no predictions for the
future. "At this point I cannot
tell you what will happen after
June 5," he told students.
As they consider switching
visas, students are discovering
that they may lose the income
generated by working spouses if
they give up J- 1 status.
Even if they can find a job after
graduation, the five year limit on
working visas may be another
problem. Still told students that
they can apply for another five
years, but only from outside the
United States. For students hold
ing expired passports, this is not
an option.
The I-Center is "trying to help
Chinese students by giving them
enough information to decide by
themselves," Makino said, but the
complexity of immigration law re
mains a worry for Chinese stu
dents whose future depends on it.

David Still, a representative from the San Francisco immigration
office, recently came to Stanford to answer the questions of Chinese
Stanford students about their options concerning their visas and
future employment in the United States.
