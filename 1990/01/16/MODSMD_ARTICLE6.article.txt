# Lobbying for a halt to deportation:
## Chinese students seek veto override 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer 
For Chinese students at Stan
ford, the crucial difference be
tween President Bush and
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is
simple: The president's decisions
can be overriden.
Currently, students here are at
tempting to take advantage of just
that difference.
They are actively lobbying Con
gress to override Bush's veto of
a bill that would waive the two
year home-country return re
quirement for Chinese students.
And some of them are facing the
prospect of prolonged limbo, re
gardless of the fate of the over
ride, because of Stanford's own
policies.
Chinese students on J-l visas
are required to return to their
homeland for two years after grad
uation before applying for a
change in status that would allow
them to work in the United
States.
When Bush vetoed the bill,

sponsored by Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif., in November, he intro
duced an administrative order
that has many of the same com

waiving the return requirement,
halting deportation procedures
and offering limited employment
authorization for Chinese stu

Rep. Tom Campbell, R-
Stanford, said that the protections
offered under the two plans are
basically the same, but "the dif

ministrative action] could change
the next day."
At the same time as they push
for an override that would change
federal law, some students are
filing for changes of status avail
able to them under Bush's admin
istrative order.
Chinese students echo Camp
bell's criticism of the instability
of the administrative action. Xu
Guanghan, a graduate student in
engineering, said that Bush ad
visers told leaders of the indepen
dent union of Chinese students

'We are really worried
that the president will
use us as a bargain
ing chip in his rela

that the president wanted to main
tain his flexibility in foreign
policy.
"What do you mean you are
flexible?" Xu asked, in reflection.
"Are you going to be flexible with
our lives?
"We are really worried that the
president will use us as a bargain
ing chip (in his relations with
Beijing]," Xu continued, "so we
want to make it law."
Chinese students are also con
cerned by the ambiguous legal
status of the president's order. Be

action's provisions are in con
