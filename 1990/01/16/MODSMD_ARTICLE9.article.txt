As the seventh You Can Make
A Difference Conference focuses
on changes in education world
wide, Stanford's School of Educa
tion has been changing its own
focus in response to growing un
dergraduate interest in education.
This weekend's conference will
examine "Changing Education for
a Changing World" at a time when
Stanford has witnessed a
"tremendous upsurge" in the
number of undergraduates
enrolling in education classes, par
ticipating in teacher training pro
grams and tutoring in area
schools, said Marshall Smith, dean
of the school.
The small graduate School of
Education has been ranked num

ucation schools in California have
traditionally required a bachelor's
degree in another field before be
ginning fifth-year study in the
methods of education.
"But where along the line in
your four years are you encour
aged to pick up an interest in
education?" said Goodwin Liu, a
junior in biology who is one of
the four student co-directors of
this year's conference.
Recognizing the increasing in
terest in educational issues, the
school "is ready to do something
about it and throw money behind"
the conference, said conference co
director Pat McDonough, a grad

uate student in education.
The school does offer a small
number of classes to undergrad
uates and has recently initiated
several new programs.
For example, it sponsors a 2-
year-old undergraduate honors
program that currently allows 12
students to conduct research on
an educational issue of their
choice. In addition, the Mellon
Program in Teacher Education of
fers a small number of under
graduates the opportunity to work
in the field of education for two
years before beginning graduate
work.
These small programs limit the
number of undergraduates who
can pursue educational topics,
Smith said, but then will be ex
panded in the coming years. These
programs are "nowhere near the
size we're beginning to think
about now," he said.
"In particular, we're increasing
the programs with the most

relevance to society," Smith said.
The school has strengthened the
policy area of the school, expanded
interaction with local schools and
hired a number of minority staff
members.
"Stanford's School of Education
has the prestige to make a move
and take the lead in establishing
a broader opportunity for under
graduates interested in educa
tion," said Liu.
With this increased attention to
the needs of undergraduates, the
education school appears to be
changing the direction of educa
tion to a "first-rate program,"
Smith said.
