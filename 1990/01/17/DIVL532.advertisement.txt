"After living in the Bay Area and moving to Seattle, I don't ever want to go back. Seattle's clean,
green and pristine. I've been here for six years and I'm continually amazed at how well Microsoft focuses
on the task at hand and avoids petty politics. Everyone's sharp and keen on doing the right thing and
having fun while they're at it. Work hard, play hard, killer projects...why go anywhere else?"
Dan Newell, BS/EE Stanford '83

"Microsoft has the best summer intern program I've ever heard of. Interns get to work on real prod
ucts and have real responsibility. In my four years as an intern, I have gained invaluable real-world experi
ence, things you can't learn in school. This summer I worked as a software developer for OS/2 Presentation
Manager Excel, optimizing vital parts of the spreadsheet. In past summers, I wrote parts of Word, Mail
and internal tools. I have led meetings, worked with a Vice-President of another company, and yes, even
talked to Bill Gates. You can get a summer job in a lot of places, but few where you can walk into an office
or store, point at a top-ten product and say 'I helped write that!"'

"At a reception for interns at Bill Gates' house, a VP of the company told us, 'If you find you aren't
being challenged enough, let me know and I'll make sure you're put on a project that's more interesting.'
I don't think many of us had to take him up on his offer. During my summer as a program management
intern, I researched competitive products, proposed and tested design changes, and saw those changes im
plemented in the design of the product. Microsoft treats their interns as important members of the design
team and expects results that reflect this treatment."

xr , — surnmer at Microsoft turned out to be quite more than enjoyable. I was in a Computer Based
Training group that worked on tutorial units, bringing together short animation sequences and interactive
lessons to introduce the user to the associated application. I ended up using multimedia, on the Mac and
IBM, and even creating an animation program of my own.
Microsoft is definitely a place of variety. They have a group working on almost anything you can
think of—languages, applications, systems, and even multimedia. And, of course, they are all right
next door."

"The day I was hired, they told me, 'Here at Microsoft, when we decide what we want, we act on
that decision.' And, I found again and again that they were out to convince me. When I showed up in
Redmond, I found a fully-furnished apartment waiting for me. At work, I found a door with my name on
it, right along side the doors of full-time software engineers and project leads. I got to spend an evening
with my friends in Bill Gates' backyard discussing the future of the software industry with him. And, the
people in my department always treated me as their equal.
One Friday night as I was leaving my office, I noticed a few people down an otherwise deserted hall.
As I approached them , I recognized a familiar face. I smiled and said, 'Hi, Bill!' (Gates). He greeted me
with a smile back. I felt pretty good walking to my car."
