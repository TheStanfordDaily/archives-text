# Cal bear chastised

### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
Oski, it seems, is no smarter
than the average Bear. Even if he
is, he won't get a chance to prove
it until Jan. 25.
The UC-Berkeley mascot has
become infamous for his ob
noxious behavior. But after an
incident at a Jan. 7 basketball
game against Oregon State, Oski
has been sidelined for at least two
sporting events.
With the Golden Bears down
32-28 at the half, Oski bounded
onto the court. The mascot had
somehow smuggled a large layer
cake into UC-Berkeley's Harmon
Gymnasium.
Standing in front of the Oregon
State stands, he pretended to
vacillate between throwing the
dessert at the Oregon State
onlookers and lobbing it at Cal
fans.
To the surprise of many spec
tators, Oski then hurled the
pastry projectile into the Oregon
visitor stands, where it splattered
on a number of spectators, includ
ing the family of an Oregon
player.
Watson Laetsch, the campus'
vice chancellor for development,
later apologized for the mascot's
behavior. In a letter to those hit
by the cake, Watson said, "the
institution is embarrassed by the
incident."
The Stanford Tree, sophomore
Gil Blank, said he was not sur
prised that Oski had been
benched.
"Anyone who's ever dealt with
that farcical imitation of a mascot
knows he's getting his just
desserts," the Tree added.
Members of the Oski Commit
tee, a select group of Cal students
who escort Oski to games,
apologized for the occurrence to
administration officials.
The Daily could not get more
on the story from the bear's
mouth, as Oski's true identity is
a well-guarded secret. Tradition
ally, only Oski Committee mem
bers know his alter-ego.
Oski motivated both fans and
players with his lively antics at
football and basketball contests.
With his suspension, it becomes
unlikely that either of the next
two games will be a cakewalk for
Cal. The Bears will face USC and
16th-ranked UCLA without Oski.
"It's an unfortunate incident,
but one that serves as a catalyst
to talk about some things with
the Oski Committee that need to
be talked about," said William
Manning, the campus' recrea
tional sports director.
A very popular figure on
campus, the bear had been rep
resenting UC-Berkeley independ
ently of the school's admini
stration. The mascot's unorthodox
and confrontational style had pre
viously raised questions about his
relationship with the university,

Manning said.
Because of their similar jobs
and close proximity, most Pac-10
mascots share feelings of broth
erhood and rivalry, the Tree said.
But Oski has been a perennial
outcast because of his attitude
problem.
Oski tries to antagonize every
thing and everyone not associated
with UC-Berkeley, the Tree ex
plained.
"It's Oski for the sake of Oski,
not for the sake of school spirit.
"A mascot is supposed to be the
hardest-working man in show
business, not the living incarna
tion of fascism," the Tree said.
Oski is nearly the most-hated
mascot in the Pac-10, second only
to USC's Trojan, the Tree said.
Among Oski's more controver
sial moments was a fight that he
apparently started with the Tree
during last year's Big Game.
Stanford has retained the Axe
for three consecutive years now,
a source of ever-increasing frus
tration for the UC-Berkeley mas
cot.
Now students and administra
tors are working to create new
regulations for keeping Oski in
check, Manning said. Pending
their approval, Oski will be
reinstated as mascot.
"If we're going to have an Oski,
he's got to behave in a way that
will bring honor to the universi
ty," Laetsch said. Laetsch is also

overseeing the implementation of
Oski-related rules.
Although Manning would not
specify what rules were under
consideration, he said Oski's iden
tity will remain a secret under
the new guidelines. The univer
sity believes it can hold an anon
ymous person accountable for his
or her actions, he added.
But the secrecy about Oski's
true identity has allowed those
who portray him to get out of
control, the Tree said. Revealing
Oski's identity should be a key
goal of UC-Berkeley as it seeks
further control over its mascot,
he added.
