## Kremlin sends 11,000 more troops to quell civil war 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — The Kremlin sent
more than 11,000 reinforcements, in
cluding Red Army units, to the
Caucasus yesterday to halt a civil war
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
that has killed 56 people.
New clashes were reported, and Tass
said 2,000 people armed with anti
aircraft guns and other artillery were
massing on hills around Nagorno-
Karabakh, a disputed district that has
become a flashpoint for the neighboring
groups' ethnic hatreds.
Combatants in the region 1,250 miles
southeast of Moscow had seized stores
of hand grenades, the Interior Ministry
said. In Armenia, "demands are being
made to arm citizens and send them to
Nagorno-Karabakh," according to the
official news agency, and the govern
ment newspaper Izvestia reported 16
attacks on weapons depots in 24 hours
by Armenians hunting for guns.
In one raid, 3,000 people stormed a
police station in Armenia's Artash
region and seized 106 automatic weap
ons, 30 carbines, 27 rifles, more than
3,000 cartridges and a grenade
launcher, the newspaper said.
"We can't bring ourselves to
pronounce it out loud, but what is hap
pening now in Karabakh, in northern
Azerbaijan, can unambiguously be
termed a civil war," correspondent O.

Komsomolskaya Pravda.

The Bush administration supported Gorbachev's use
of troops in the Caucasus.

editor at Armenia's official Armenpress
news agency said from Yerevan, the re
public's capital.
Gorbachev and the Soviet Presidium
declared a state of emergency in the
strife-torn mountain area Monday
night, empowering the government to
deploy units of the Soviet army, navy
and KGB to protect lives and guard
vital installations such as railroads.
Internal security troops already in the
region have been incapable of halting
the most protracted ethnic conflict in
Gorbachev's nearly five-year tenure as
Kremlin leader, said by Izvestia yester
day to threaten his entire campaign for
"perestroika," or economic and social
reform.
More than 6,000 additional internal
security troops were sent yesterday to
reinforce existing Interior Ministry
detachments, Tass said. To assist them,
more than 5,000 Red Army soldiers,
who traditionally carry heavier
weaponry, also were dispatched, Tass
said.
Soviet media did not say how many
total troops were in the region.
Residents of Yerevan and Baku, Azer
baijan's capital, said by phone they had
seen no sign Tuesday night of the rein-

far-cements' arrival.
In Washington, the Pentagon said yes
terday it saw reports it believes to be
accurate that a mudslide in Baku killed
16 members of the Caspian fleet.
It was responding to a reporter's ques
tion.
The Bush administration supported
Gorbachev's use of tro the
Caucasus and criticized feuding Azer
baijanis and Armenians for "revisiting
old ethnic hatreds."
"We recognize the right of any state
to ensure the safety of its citizens and
it looks like that's the primary concern
at the moment," said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
The flareup is the most violent be
tween mainly Moslem Azerbaijanis and
mostly Christian Armenians since their
decades-old feud over Nagorno-
Karabakh erupted in bloody clashes two
years ago.
The region, though predominantly Ar
menian, has been attached to Azerbaijan
since 1923, and the current troubles
were sparked by its demand in February
1988 to be annexed by Armenia.
In Baku, detachment of security
troops patrolled the city and armored
vehicles moved through the suburbs.
