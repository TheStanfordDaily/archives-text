German riot investigated
WEST BERLIN (AP) - East Ger
many opened criminal investigations
yesterday into protesters who stormed
secret police headquarters, and the
nation's police chief said demand for
reform must not turn into something
resembling civil war. Warning strikes
for higher pay and faster reform hit
several cities, twinned with a con
demnation of the government decision
to raise prices.
In Bonn, the West German capital,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl bowed to
pressure and scrapped plans to sign
an agreement on closer ties with Com
munist Premier Hans Modrow's
caretaker government before East
Germany's May 6 elections.
Even members of Kohls own Ciih
lition said signing of such an agree
ment must wait until a democratically
elected government takes over after
free elections.
Kohl told a news conference imme
diate yesterday that help is needed
for East Germany's ailing economy,
adding that "the situation in the Ger
man Democratic Republic had gotten
more difficult."
Hundreds of thousands of East Ger
mans took to the streets Monday to
step up pressure against the Commu
nists, with protesters at the secret

police building also breaking into the
counterespionage area.
Peace talks advance
WASHINGTON (AP) - Despite
claims of progress, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid said
yesterday that a date still cannot be
set for the first stage of negotiations
on the future of the Israeli-held West
Bank and Gaza.
"We are still discussing it," Abdei-
Meguid said after an hour-long meet
ing with Secretary of State James A.
Baker 111.
The main stumbling block to such
negotiations is a diapute over whether
the WoFtipe liihcrntiow
will have any role in the discussions,
intended to lead to to cho6se
Palestinian leaders.
As the first step, Baker hopes to
hold a three-way session here with
Meguid and Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens.
" There is no doubt that Egypt is
very much in favor of keeping on with
the peace process," Abdel-Meguid said.
"And we see that already a lot has
been achieved during what I call the
first phase."

Quake off the coast
EUREKA, Calif. (AP) — A strong
earthquake struck along California's
North Coast yesterday, but there were
no immediate reports of injuries or
damages.
The quake, measuring 5.3 on the
Richter scale, struck at 12:08 p.m.
about 50 miles south of Eureka, the
U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park
reported. The state Office of Emer
gency Services in Sacramento and Uni
versity of California-Berkeley Seis
mographic Station also estimated the
quake at 5.3.
"It seemed long and just kind of
wo*ivuig. It wasn't real, real strong
said a woman with the Eureka
Police* Depart ment who only identified
lwrffelf as Diana.
The quake was felt along the North
Coast, the region above San Francisco,
from Point Arena near the Oregon
border, south to Willits and in Lake
County. State emergency officials re
ported that residents in the small town
of Petrolia said items were knocked
off shelves, but that there was no
other damage. Petrolia is near a land
formation known as Punta Gorda, al
most directly at the point where the
San Andreas Fault enters the Pacific.
