SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — The ruling
Communist party, in a concession to the
country's fledgling opposition, agreed yes
terday to allow democratic groups to
publish their own newspaper and said they
would be granted offices in Sofia.
But it rejected a demand for opposition
access to radio and television, which would
take democratic ideas across this largely
rural nation.
The compromise was fashioned after the
opposition threatened to withdraw from
talks with the Communists that many hope
will hasten Bulgaria's faltering transition
to democracy.
More than 50,000 people attended one
of the biggest anti-Communist demonstra
tions in Bulgarian history on Sunday to
back the opposition's demands for more
democracy. The de,rßO.n^l^wn
at two days' notice, testified to slowly
growing p<#)ul?w subpart for -opposition
groups still nanned j|M three mortfMago.
Petko Simeonov, a leader of the Union
of Democratic Forces, an umbrella organ
ization of 12 opposition parties and groups,
angrily accused the Communists of stalling
on demands first raised in November for
an independent daily newspaper and for
Sofia headquarters to enable the growing
but still weak opposition to organize.
"For many years, we know what it means
when we don't get an answer," Simeonov
told the Communists seated across the
table in the West Hall of the national par
liament.
"Our slogans and our ideas do not reach

everybody. We want what we have to say
to be heard by everyone," Simeonov said.
Access to the media is important in Bul
garia, which is isolated from Western and
all East bloc broadcasts but Soviet ones,
and whose state-run media continue to run
vitriolic attacks on opposition figures in
an attempt to discredit them with the
public.
The opposition won agreement on the
daily newspaper, which it hopes will have
a print run of some 50,000 copies.
Opposition spokesman Georgi Spassov
declined to say who would write for it or
exactly when it would start to appear as
the country's first independent daily since
the Communists repressed all opposition
in 1947.
The disarray that marked the talks was
played out for an hour in front of Bulgarian
ana iferei illjAfrtXij&ed t&g
difficulties of East Europeans. Joying to
move from totalitarian rule fc6 tnore de
mocracy without tools basic for the tran
sition.
Spassov noted that almost all buildings
in Bulgaria are controlled by the state,
thus putting the opposition in the position
of begging the authorities for office space
and a telephone.
"Plainly speaking, we cannot exist,"
Simeonov told the Communists.
He asked how the opposition could be
members of the negotiations "when we
have no way of meeting to discuss things
beforehand? The conditions are unfavora
ble, as if on purpose."
