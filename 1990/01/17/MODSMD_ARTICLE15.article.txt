VIENNA, Austria (AP) — The Soviet
military chief urged the United States
yesterday to match sharp cuts in troops,
weapons and spending Moscow is making
as part of its plan to reshape the Soviet
Union's defense policy.
The call by Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev fol
lowed comments by Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
cautioning that Soviet forces remain pre
dominant in Europe but praising Mos
cow's policy change. Powell also held out

the possibility of U.S. troop cuts, saying
there was "nothing sacrosanct about the
number of American troops stationed in
Europe."
The military chiefs' statements came
on the opening day of a three-week bar
gaining session designed to ease East-
West tensions in Europe.
The talks, known as the military doc
trine seminar, have coincided with
removal of hard-line leaders in every War
saw Pact country. Western experts are

eager to learn how the political reforms
that have occurred in Eastern Europe
since last year might affect those coun
try's defense policies.
The session marks the first time the
top brass of 35 nations have sat down
to try to lift some of the secrecy sur
rounding military affairs.
Moiseyev explained Moscow's change
from offensive to defensive strategy, and
urged the United States and its allies to
make similar military cuts.

"We need reciprocity and would like to
see it in the nearest future," Moiseyev
said.
Earlier, Powell said the Western allies
were still concerned about "the specter
of confronting greatly superior forces
armed, trained and suited for offensive
ground operations."
But Powell welcomed the change in
Soviet strategy and added: "There is
nothing carved in stone that savs that

military power in a divided Europe should
remain as it has over the last four
decades."
The U.S. has about 300,000 troops sta
tioned in Europe, compared with about
575,000 Soviet troops, according to U.S.
figures.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion maintains its forces are the mini
mum needed to defend against — not
launch — an attack.
