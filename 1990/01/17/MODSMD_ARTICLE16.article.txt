# Agreement reached on Cambodia
## 
### 
PARIS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council's five
permanent members agreed yesterday to seek a
Cambodian peace plan that would include free elec
tions administered and supervised by the United
Nations.
After two days of meetings, the five countries
issued a 16-point summary of principles, including
an "effective U.N. presence" to assure peace prior
to elections. The statement indicated international
peacekeepers would be used.
"An enduring peace can only be achieved through
a comprehensive political settlement, including the
verified withdrawal of foreign forces, a cease-fire
and the cessation of outside military assistance,"
the statement said. "The goal should be self
determination for the Cambodian people through
free, fair and democratic elections."
French and U.S. officials said representaives of
the Security Council members — the United States,
Soviet Union, Chinri, France and Britain — will
meet again in about two weeks in New York to
advance the peace plan. A third meeting is expected
in Paris in February.
"We're at least going to make a strong try at it,"
said a senior U.S. official speaking on condition of
anonymity. "We're not talking about a process that
would take several years, but it's clear it will take
several months."
The official said there were many details to l>e
worked out, and that the government and the three
guerrilla factions would have to lay down their arms.
"Clearly the Cambodians themselves have to be
a mtyor part of the process," the U.S. official said.
"It can't just be plunked down on their heads."
The Vietnamese-backed government of Premier
Hun Sen and the three guerrilla factions allied in
an uneasy coalition have triven at least cautious

support for a mt\jor U.N. role.
The statement suggested that a "Supreme Na
tional Council" might be set up during the transition
process. There was no agreement on the council's
membership or what powers it would have, the U.S.
official said.
The statement by the General Assembly members
did not specifically mention Hun Sen's government
or the guerrilla coalition led by Prince Norodom
Sihanouk.
It said the Security Council members would "wel
come an early resumption of a constructive dialogue
among the Cambodian factions" and that the tran
sition process "should not be dominated by any one
of them."
The Security Council delegations were headed by
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon, Chi
nese Vice Minister Xu Dunxin, Rritish Deputy
Foreign Minister David Gillmore, and Claude Mar
tin, the director for Asia in- France's Foreign Min
istry.
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas opened
the discussions Monday, saying the countries had
a special responsibility to make sure that one guer
rilla faction, the Khmer Rouge, never returns to
power in Cambodia.
I'he Khmer Rouge were responsible for hundreds
of thousands of deaths when their leader Pol Pot
ruled Cambodia from 1975-78. They were chased
out by a Vietnamese invasion in 1978.
Son Sann, a former prime minister who heads
the non-communist Khmer People's National Lib
eration Front, wrote in Tuesday's editions of the
conservative daily Figaro that he would approve
a U.N. interim administration and a peacekeeping
force to enforce a cease-fire.
