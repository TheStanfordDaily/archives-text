## Staggering proposal 
### 
New four-point alcohol
policy seems to target
both use and abuse

STANFORD NEEDS TO
define its stance on alcohol.
It is unclear whether a new
four-point alcohol policy proposed
by Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Lyons, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger and Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington aims to
prevent the abuse of alcohol at
Stanford or to discourage any kind
of use of alcohol.
The University's current alcohol
policy assumes that students are
adults and places the responsibility
of drinking on the individual.
Yet, the new plan's prohibition
of alcohol purchases made with
University-collected student fees
contradicts the current policy.
Of course, the new plan will not
eliminate alcohol consumption in
dormitories.
Students who want to drink still
will — but without the extra se
curity of residence staff supervi
sion.
Furthermore, there are plenty of
ways for dorms to get around the
proposed policy. After the first
quarter of the year, dorms may
choose to remove house dues from
their University bills and collect
them independently — to spend on
alcohol if so desired.
Lyons himself noted that "a
group can still pass a hat" and buy
alcohol with individual funds. Why
are administrators proposing a
plan and then offering students
ideas about how to circumvent it?
A second point of the proposal
would ban advertisements of alco
hol at all University athletic events.
This point, too, seems intended to
limit not only the abuse but also
the use of alcohol.

And the ads are a big source of
revenue for the Athletic Depart
ment, which has an approximately
$1 million deficit this year.
Then there is the free speech
issue. Is it the University's right
to ban ads for a specific product?
Last year's proposal to ban racist
and sexist speech met with strong
community opposition.
The other two points of the pro
posed plan that aim to limit the
abuse of alcohol are valid and
worthwhile for adoption.
The new policy proposes banning
alcohol from Stanford Stadium and
all other athletic facilities.
Clearly, the current policy of
limiting the amount of alcohol that
can be brought into the stadium
is not effective in checking alcohol
related violence — witness the 27
alcohol-related arrests at Big Game
alone this year.
Stanford is currently the only
University in the Pacific 10 Con
ference without a dry stadium, and
we should relinquish this dubious
honor.
Spectators can still arrive at the
events drunk, of course, but secu
rity guards are supposed to deny
admittance to overly intoxicated
people. If the guards cannot tell
who is drunk, making people climb
the steep steps of the Stadium
would be an excellent sobriety test.
Finally, the proposed policy
would prohibit people with drunk
driving convictions from purchas
ing University parking permits.
Students convicted of driving
while intoxicated can already be
charged with a Fundamental
Standard violation if the arrest oc
curs on campus, and this policy
would also treat drunk driving as
the serious crime that it is.
The University must explicitly
define its alcohol policy — which
has always been nebulous — and
aim to limit the abuse of alcohol
while still allowing its responsible
use.
