## Ban vomit-green carpets 
### 
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED about the
newly proposed University plan to
limit alcohol consumption on campus.
Maybe I was in a drunken stupor, but
wasn't the big news last year that the
University was getting incredibly lenient
about alcohol?
Didn't the University in effect say that
decisions about alcohol use would be left
to the student, who would then have to
answer to the law for any transgressions
he or she committed?
Regardless, this year alcohol has be
come a prominent issue on campus that
needs to be addressed with some severe
regulations. The impetus for the change
was the behavior of drunken fans at Big
Game which resulted in 27 alcohol-related
arrests.
So banning alcohol from Stanford Sta
dium and other athletic facilities and for
bidding advertisements of alcohol at
athletic events is a mtyor part of the plan.
These two proposals seem acceptable,
especially if they mean that the shining
example of how to objectify women, the
picture of three models whose bodies
create the Budweiser label, would be
banned.
And I've been showered with beer one
too many times to bemoan the absence
of six-packs in the stadium. Besides, why
would anyone not want to be perfectly
sober during the game so as to better
appreciate the pure athletic genius that
is Stanford football?
I'm quite surprised that the University
is trying to make purchasing alcohol more
difficult for dorms, however. When I en
tered my room in Stern this fall, I thought

that the University was subtly condoning
alcohol use and abuse with its strategic
selection of a vomit-green carpet to cover
my floor.
But now I see that it was only a co
incidence, and that the University really
is trying to crack down.
I am immediately reminded of the hor
ror stories my friends at other schools
have told me. I've heard how people at
other schools drink beer surreptitiously
behind closed doors, ready to whisk it
away if they hear their resident assistant
patrolling the hall.
I've heard of RAs who, if they find a
beer bottle cap in one of the student's
rooms, will promptly write up a demerit
report against the offender. The Univer
sity hasn't gone this far yet, but prohibit
ing dorms from using their dues to buy
alcohol could be the first step on a slip
pery slope.
The new restriction would also under
mine the very foundation of residential
education. Part of the "fun" (I use that
term in a relative sense) of being in a
house is forming a certain type of gov
ernment and then using that government
to plan activites and allocate funds.
Everyone is not always happy with the
dorm's decisions. Everyone does not al
ways participate in all of the dorm's pro
grams or partake of all of the dorm's
purchases.
That's kind of a democracy. If a higher
power can forbid the purchase of socially
undesirable products, that autonomy is
threatened.
And who is to say that alcohol will be
the only target? Other dorm purchases

Maybe I was in a
drunken stupor, but
wasn't the big news
last year that the Uni
versity was getting in
credibly lenient about
alcohol?

could be deemed offensive or harmful. *
Should dorms be allowed to use their
funds to rent gross slasher movies? To
buy study break food that's high in fat
and cholesterol? What about fur coats?
I have to oppose the University's plan
to prohibit the use of dorm funds for
alcohol purchases on the principle that
it toys with the firm backbone of democ
racy that supports our proud nation.
But I suppose I could be swayed if my
carpet was replaced.
