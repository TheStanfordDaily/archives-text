## Alcohol policy proposal is throwback to Prohibition 
### 
I WANT TO SAY how happy I was
to see the proposed alcohol regula
tions. Before coming here, I must
say I was a little apprehensive about
Stanford's reputation. I had always
been led to believe it was a campus
full of frivolous, fun-loving and party
mad undergraduates.
1 was terrified by the prospect of
crowded bars, all-night fraternity par
ties and random promiscuity.
You can imagine my relief when I
found that quite the opposite was true,
and I must attribute this to the ma
ture guidance of the administrators,
whose commands bring sense and
decorum into this jungle of alcoholic,
anarchistic youth.
Banning the funding of dormitory
entertainment is so sensible — encour

aging, nay forcing, undergraduates to
abandon their naturally indolent na
tures.
Banning alcohol from Stanford Sta
dium makes even more sense. People
should be there for the love of their
alma mater and the game, not to drink
beer with their friends.
Best of all, though, is the plan to
ban drunk drivers from campus —
what genius, what wisdom.
But I think we should go further
still. Why stop at the alcohol offenders?
Surely we should ban those menaces
with speeding tickets who threaten the
lives of our children. And what about
those who've committed parking offen
ses?
Logically, they must be the culprits
causing all the parking problems, as

they have previously proved by their
wanton flouting of parking regulations
— ban them, I say.
I now feel I was foolish to be afraid
of finding a rowdy campus. Beautiful,
suburban Palo Alto is blissfully
subdued in the evening — people can
walk the streets without the inter
ference of any other human being.
It makes perfect sense to force the
would-be drinkers far from these halls
of learning. In doing so, these young
offenders are rightly at the mercy of
the police. Why keep these hoodlums
on campus where their horrible ex
uberance can go unpunished?
With luck, these abusers may even
suffer a fatal accident. Perhaps with
another drunk student? Poetic justice,
I say.

People have argued that we should
have a bar on campus to act as a
social focal point, to regulate student
drinking habits within University
limits and to integrate the undergradu
ate and graduate population.
Nonsense, I say. I think we should
turn the Coffee House into a library,
especially since most students believe
that is its real function.
Let us all gather together to support
the crusade to rid Stanford of that evil
menace, alcohol. Let us ban the drink
ing clubs, the beer houses and then
perhaps we might even succeed in
returning to the good old days of
Prohibition.
Praise the Lord.
