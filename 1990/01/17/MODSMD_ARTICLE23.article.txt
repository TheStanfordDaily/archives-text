# Blood donors can easily become bone marrow donors, too
## 
### 
For 9,000 adults and children in this
country with leukemia and other blood
related diseases, time is short. Their
only chance for long-term survival is a
bone marrow transplant from a com
patible donor.
Most people hear "bone marrow
transplant" and think how complicated
it must be to get involved. It's not. A
simple screening of blood drawn to
determine white blood cell typing is all
that is needed.
According to Diane Hill of the Stan
ford Blood Bank, anyone in the com
munity can request HLA screening as
a part of normal blood donation, at no
cost to the individual.
The only requirements are an ap
pointment and consent to have your

name listed in the national registry of
bone marrow donors. There are cur
rently 67,000 registered bone marrow
donors, but many thousands more are
needed given the odds of tissue com
patibility.
If you are found to be compatible
with a person requiring a bone marrow
transplant, you will be notified by the
registry and counseled about the steps
involved in becoming a donor.
Bone marrow can be taken in a
simple procedure at your local hospital
and then transported to the hospital of
the patient you match.
Hundreds of students, staff and fac
ulty at this University generously
donate blood each year. Now they have
the opportunity to make that donation
even more meaningful by requesting
HLA typing and becoming part of the
national bone marrow donor registry.
All interested donors may call the
Stanford Blood Bank at 723-7831 for
an appointment. Please specify that you
would like to be HLA screened as part

of your blood donation. For thousands
of cancer patients, your donation could
be a gift of life.
