# 'Rape behavior' leads to rape and cannot be lightly dismissed
## 
### 
In typical sarcasm, the Jan. 8 Stan
ford Review criticized The Daily, say
ing, "The Daily's alleged rape turned
out to be a sexual fondling — just a
slight difference, huh?"
It was only a small item in "You
Know You're at Stanford When. .
but it represents an attitude I've en
countered before which is disturbing
and dangerous.
I call any unwanted sexual fondling
(and in this case it was of a 13-year

old girl) rape behavior.
If we can dismiss such behavior as
insignificant and unrelated to rape
(both are implied by the tone of the
comment), then how far is this from
dismissing attempted rape as such?
And how far is this from denying the
reality and seriousness of rape itself?
Dangerously close, in my opinion.
Rape behavior leads to rape. It is
not to be taken lightly, even joked
about, and until we do away with atti
tudes such as that expressed in The
Review, we all will continue to live
with the horror of rape.
