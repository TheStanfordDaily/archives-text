The United States
had no legal right
to invade Panama

IN HIS FRIDAY letter in response
to Malinda McCollum's Jan. 10
column dealing with the U.S. inva
sion of Panama, Daryl JosefTer was
right about one thing: "A deeper anal
ysis of the situation is needed."
LJnfortuntely, the analysis which
Joseffer provides is narrow and even .
dangerous.
In attempting to refute McCollum's
arguments that the Bush administra
tion acted in a manner similar to an
overly hormonal male adolescent, Josef
fer's letter typifies the flawed logic and
genuine lack of understanding that the
Bush administration and many other
Americans have displayed with regard
to the Panamanian invasion.
The United States invaded Panama
last month with the stated intentions
of dethroning and capturing Gen.
Manual Noriega and protecting the
lives of American citizens living in

Panama.
Joseffer argues that such an invasion
was justified because Noriega was "a
corrupt dictator who oppressed his
people, laundered drug money and
protected members of the Medellin
cocaine cartel," as well as being a
threat to American citizens.
Joseffer continues, arguing that, "If
[the United States! repeatedly.. . turns
its back when unarmed American
soldiers are beaten and shot by foreign
soldiers, other nations will lose respect
for the United States."
Joseffer argues that such passivity
would lead to more frequent challenges
to American power and concludes that
"showing a little muscle is not a bad
thing."
Regardless of whether the allegations
against Noriega are true or not, the
United States has no right to invade
another sovereign nation simply be
cause it disagrees with the policies of
that nation's leadership.
Article 2 of the Charter of the
United Nations states explicitly, "All
Members shall settle their international
disputes by peaceful means in such a
manner that international peace and
security and justice are not endan
gered. All Members shall refrain in

their international relations from the
threat or use of force against the
territorial integrity or political indepen
dence of any state, or in any other
manner inconsistent with the Purposes
of the United Nations."
"Showing a little muscle" and invad
ing Panama was not only a "bad
thing," it was illegal. The United
States cannot invade sovereign nations
so that it will not "lose respect," as
JosefTer put it.
Invading Panama was a flagrant and
reckless violation of international law.
The Bush administration, in an effort
to carry out its agenda, chose to simply
ignore its legal obligations.
Why were there so many Americans
in Panama to "defend" anyway? The
answer is that the United States uses
its vast military and economic power
to indirectly control Panama and its
canal.
The Bush administration felt this
control was being threatened and
reacted by ordering the invasion. While
not condoning the actions of the Pana
manian soldiers who JosefTer states
attacked "unarmed American soldiers,"
is it not ironic that Joseffer claims

that these soldiers were attacked by
"foreign soldiers?"
American soldiers in Panama are
"foreign," Panamanian soldiers are not.
If the Bush administration truly
wants to help the people of Panama,
then it should resolve to work towards
changing the global economic system
which exploits nations such as Panama
for the benefit of northern indust
rialized nations such as the United
States.
Maybe then the United States will
earn some of the "respect" which
Joseffer feels it so desperately needs.

The reasons behind
Beyer's resignation
deserve investigation
Former News Service Director Bob
Beyers is that rare non-faculty member
of this University whom the faculty
regard as a colleague.
He shares with us a passion for

truth and a hatred of deceit.
He asked the same basic questions
we do as historians, and when the
answers were hidden from him or he
was prevented from finding them, he
did what any conscientious faculty
member would do — he resigned.
Before that decision and even after
ward, Beyers brought to his job and
this University a distinction and na
tional reputation none of his super
visors will ever attain.
His leaving is tragic. The reasons art
scandalous. This is a matter the Fac
ulty Senate must investigate immedi
ately as our very identity as a Univer
sity is in question.
Since the administration took the
unusual step of disclosing an investiga
tive report of his conduct at News
Service, Beyers is ethically free to tell
us who those individuals are who
turned him against Stanford and why.
We are told Beyers and certain ad
ministrators he worked for could not
see eye to eye. This is not surprising
as intellectually and morally he stands
far taller than they.

The United States
had no legal right
to invade Panama

IN HIS FRIDAY letter in response
to Malinda McCollum's Jan. 10
column dealing with the U.S. inva
sion of Panama, Daryl JosefTer was
right about one thing: "A deeper anal
ysis of the situation is needed."
LJnfortuntely, the analysis which
Joseffer provides is narrow and even .
dangerous.
In attempting to refute McCollum's
arguments that the Bush administra
tion acted in a manner similar to an
overly hormonal male adolescent, Josef
fer's letter typifies the flawed logic and
genuine lack of understanding that the
Bush administration and many other
Americans have displayed with regard
to the Panamanian invasion.
The United States invaded Panama
last month with the stated intentions
of dethroning and capturing Gen.
Manual Noriega and protecting the
lives of American citizens living in

Panama.
Joseffer argues that such an invasion
was justified because Noriega was "a
corrupt dictator who oppressed his
people, laundered drug money and
protected members of the Medellin
cocaine cartel," as well as being a
threat to American citizens.
Joseffer continues, arguing that, "If
[the United States! repeatedly.. . turns
its back when unarmed American
soldiers are beaten and shot by foreign
soldiers, other nations will lose respect
for the United States."
Joseffer argues that such passivity
would lead to more frequent challenges
to American power and concludes that
"showing a little muscle is not a bad
thing."
Regardless of whether the allegations
against Noriega are true or not, the
United States has no right to invade
another sovereign nation simply be
cause it disagrees with the policies of
that nation's leadership.
Article 2 of the Charter of the
United Nations states explicitly, "All
Members shall settle their international
disputes by peaceful means in such a
manner that international peace and
security and justice are not endan
gered. All Members shall refrain in

their international relations from the
threat or use of force against the
territorial integrity or political indepen
dence of any state, or in any other
manner inconsistent with the Purposes
of the United Nations."
"Showing a little muscle" and invad
ing Panama was not only a "bad
thing," it was illegal. The United
States cannot invade sovereign nations
so that it will not "lose respect," as
JosefTer put it.
Invading Panama was a flagrant and
reckless violation of international law.
The Bush administration, in an effort
to carry out its agenda, chose to simply
ignore its legal obligations.
Why were there so many Americans
in Panama to "defend" anyway? The
answer is that the United States uses
its vast military and economic power
to indirectly control Panama and its
canal.
The Bush administration felt this
control was being threatened and
reacted by ordering the invasion. While
not condoning the actions of the Pana
manian soldiers who JosefTer states
attacked "unarmed American soldiers,"
is it not ironic that Joseffer claims

that these soldiers were attacked by
"foreign soldiers?"
American soldiers in Panama are
"foreign," Panamanian soldiers are not.
If the Bush administration truly
wants to help the people of Panama,
then it should resolve to work towards
changing the global economic system
which exploits nations such as Panama
for the benefit of northern indust
rialized nations such as the United
States.
Maybe then the United States will
earn some of the "respect" which
Joseffer feels it so desperately needs.

The reasons behind
Beyer's resignation
deserve investigation
Former News Service Director Bob
Beyers is that rare non-faculty member
of this University whom the faculty

He shares with us a passion for
