Meteorites close up
When scientists analyzed the
contents of meteorites, they
ground up the sample and
passed it through a myriad of
processes before getting an an
swer.
That method told scientists
the organic material content of
the meteorite, but the process
had one major drawback: It
destroyed the sample.

Now Stanford chemists have
developed a technique that gives
the organic content of the
meteorite at an unprecedented
level of detail while making it
unnecessary to destroy the
sample. The technique, known
by the cumbersome name laser
desorption-laser multiphoton
ionization mass spectrometry,
has been used to study selected
organic materials in the 1969
Allende meteorite, one of the
most thoroughly analyzed
meteorite today.
The technique was developed
in 1987 by Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare and it was recently
applied to the meteorite by grad
uate students Renato Zenobi and
postdoctoral associate Jean-
Michel Philippoz.
The pair found that the dis
tribution of organic material is
much more heterogeneous than
previously known. Scientists
have still not determined what
the finding might mean.
NIH rules canned
Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis W. Sullivan has
effectively killed guidelines pro
posed by the National Institutes
of Health to prevent financial
conflicts of interest among sci-

entists that NIH supports.
Sullivan said the department
, would begin a new and more
, exhaustive process to determine
I what the government should do
p about such conflicts, which
many people believe to be a
byproduct of increased coopera
, tion between university scien
* tists and corporations in
biomedical research.
Many scientists considered
the proposed guidelines unrea
sonable and intrusive, and they
applauded Sullivan's move. Con
gressional aides warned, how
ever, that if some regulations
were not set up by NIH, Con-

gress might do so.
Among other things, the
guidelines would have barred
NIH-supported scientists,
research administrators and
their families from owning stock
in companies that might be in
fluenced by the scientists' re
search. The guidelines would
have required the same people
to disclose in writing their in
vestments and "outside profes
sional interests."
Stanley Cohen, a professor of
genetics at the Stanford Medical
School and a co-discoverer of a
method of splicing genes that
helped to start the biotechnol
ogy industry, said he found the
proposed guidelines "un
desirable and unnecessary."
Stanford and many other uni
versities, Cohen said, require

faculty members to tell their
departmental chairs about any
professional relationships or fi
nancial holdings that might
create a conflict of interest.
"I hope the NIH will accept
the premise that self
monitoring works in the vast
majority of instances," Cohen
said.

Award to UFO expert
Peter Sturrock, a Stanford
astrophysicist, will receive the
1990 Arctowski Medal, pre
sented by the Council of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences.
The award carries a prize of
$15,000, plus a $40,000 contri-

bution to the institution of the
winner's choice. Sturrock will be
presented the award at an April
23^ conference in Washington,
Besides being a prominent
astrophysicist, Sturrock is pres
ident and a founding member
of the Society for Scientific Ex
ploration, an organization which
studies claims of such things as
claims of encounters with UFOs.
The organization sponsors a
refereed journal, in which schol
ars can discuss everything from
the paranormal to sightings of
the Loch Ness Monster.
