Yes, environmentalism is
definitely trendy. But it appears
here to stay, and the needs for
clean water, clean air and biolog
ical diversity will hardly go out
of style with this season's fash
ions.

One does not have to be a full
time environmentalist to play a
part in developing a society that
is sustainable and respectful of
the importance of everything
from herbicide-resistant tomatoes
and old-growth forests.
Educators have a tremendous
role to play in the shift of values
toward sustainable living. It is
easy to see the difficulty in chang
ing entrenched habits, even in
something as simple as using a
mug over a styrofoam cup, espe
cially when we have been raised
with the idea that the earth, like
the universe, is expanding to hold
all our garbage and pollution.
Many educators believe that en
vironmentally sound behavior
must be taught from the earliest
years so that the next generation
will understand the fragility of
our ecosystems from day one. Op
portunities exist in developing
curricula for schools at all levels
and in all nations.
Stanford students have already
displayed enthusiasm for bringing
Project Wild, an environmental
education project, to local elemen
tary schools. Presentations
demonstrate the interdependence
of the elements of our existence
through games such as the circu
lar lap-sit. If one element, water,
for example, is damaged or
removed from the circle, everyone
falls down.
Product designers could con
tribute greatly by developing

Consumers are increasingly concerned
with the fragile environment. They are,
however, also very demanding and will
not tolerate higher prices or lower
quality.

cleaner, more efficient goods. If
China begins using currently sold
refrigerators in large numbers, as
they hope to, all limits of
chlorofluorocarbons in other
countries will be useless.
Making equally attractive, inex
pensive, non-polluting appliances
that are competitive with today's
less environmentally sound prod
ucts is a continuing challenge.
Consumers are increasingly
concerned, but they are also de
manding and will not tolerate
higher prices or lower quality.

Though trendy, the
needs for biological
diversity and clean air
and water will hardly
go out of style with
this season's fash
ions.

Making environmentally effi
cient products economically com
petitive is a potentially profitable
prospect in the face of increas
ingly concerned consumers and
new standards and legislation.
The automobile companies that
provide the best new models that
meet California's newly tightened
emissions restrictions will have
the first to ride on a wave of
pollution controls that is sure to
sweep the entire country sooner
or later.
The waste disposal firms that
increase recycling capacity will be
poised for profit as governments
all over the world make recycling
a higher priority.
Horse manure takes on new
saleability as fertilizer for mush
rooms. Hazardous waste such as
wastewater from metal finishing
operations contains metals such

as copper, nickel, tin, gold and
silver. These can be removed and
resold to smelters for a profit.
One recycling firm, the World
Resources Company, already does
business with 150 companies in
California alone, including
Hewlett Packard and Varian.
World Resources has made pro
posals to European companies,
which could expand their business
as European governments make
recycling more attractive than dis
posal.
Artists can make a significant
statement by exploring replace
ments for dangerous aerosols and
solvents. In the past artists such
as Francis Bacon have expressed
modern urban anguish, but per
haps the future holds more images
along the lines of Time's "Planet
of the Year," showing the Earth
suffocating in plastic wrap.
Performing artists can also feed
off public awareness in creative
pieces communicating the impor
tance of a healthy planet.
The extent of improvements
needed for a healthy environment
is virtually limitless, ranging from
a better diaper (how to make one
that's not-ah-unpleasant, but isn't
disposable) to lighting fixtures (to
accommodate larger, but more ef
ficient compact flourescent bulbs)
to clothing (magazines in England
are showing dresses made of
pounded pineapple fiber, boasting
subtle slogans such as "Clean Up
or Die").
New legislation, international
standards, and consumer educa
tion are all contributing to a
shifting focus toward sus
tainability for the working world.
If Stanford students are
prepared to ride the crest of the
wave in their profession-to-be,
they will be making wfse decisions
for — ready for-\t)nr r«»ing*~

try and humanity.
