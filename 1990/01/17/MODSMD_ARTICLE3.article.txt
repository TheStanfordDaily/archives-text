## Dekes on suspension while University investigates 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
The 18-year-old suspect in an alleged
Oct. 6 sexual assault at the Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity house turned himself in
to police yesterday, Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said, and the Dekes were
placed on social suspension pending com
pletion of the University's investigation of
the incident.
The suspect, John Franco, is a student
at the California Polytechnic State Insti
tute in San Luis Obispo, according to police.
Franco has been charged with sexually
assaulting a 13-year-old girl in the upstairs
bathroom of the Deke house during a party.
The crime, unlawful sexual contact with
a minor under the age of 14, is a felony
under section 288 A of the penal code.
Police had issued a warrant for Franco's
arrest, but asked him to turn himself in
to avoid , the complexity of arresting and

transfering him, Niemeyer said. Franco
was released on his own recognizance.
The University's investigation has been
taken over by Michael Jackson, associate
dean of student affairs. Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Michael Hughes, who had been
heading the University's investigation, and
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of student
affairs and director of the Row, will work
with Jackson to determine if the Dekes
are at all responsible for the incident.
"Even though we believe that no Stanford
students were involved in the assault of
the young woman, the party was hosted
by a Stanford residence. Hence the ques
tion: Did the group fulfill the responsibil
ities assumed by residential organizations
that sponsor social events in their residen
ces?" Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said in a statement yesterday.
