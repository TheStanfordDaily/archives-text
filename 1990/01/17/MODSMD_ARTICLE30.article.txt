# Science Bug: Of red pools, eyelid 'short circuits' and prawns
## 
### Megan Beardsley Staff writer 
.Flying into the San Fran-
Vir • cisco Airport, 1 noticed that
paris of the South Bay are a dis
gusting red color. You can also
see this on satellite photos of the
area. A friend told me that the
red is acid in holding ponds for
some San Jose companies. Is that
true?
A. The red pools you describe
• are holding ponds, but not
for acids. They are full of salt.
Local salt manufacturers pump
salty water from the bay into shal
low ponds and let it evaporate,
according to Tom Banks, a ranger
at the San Francisco Bay National
Wildlife Refuge and Visitors Cen
ter.
The red color is caused by
harmless algae that grow partic
ularly well in the very salty water.
Q # Why do eyes twitch ? Can it
• become permanent? What
can one do about it?

A. Eye twitching isn't the
• world's most serious medical
problem, but it is a fairly common
one.
For example, if you watch
closely in the new movie, "Henry
V," there is a short sequence
where actor Paul Scofield's lower
left eyelid twitches. Dr. Richard
Sogg — who notices this kind of
thing because he's an expert in
neuro-ophthalmology at the Stan
ford Medical Center — says this
is not good acting, but a "short
circuit" of the nerve ends in
Scofield's eyelid muscles.
Eye twitches, he says, are
caused when the nerves that com
municate between the brain in the
eye get somehow mixed up and
cause repeated contraction of the
eyelid muscles. The most frequent
reasons for this neural confusion
are emotional tension and lack of
sleep.
Eventually most eye twitches go
away on their own, so generally
the best thing to do if you have
one is wait, Sogg says, though
sometimes holding a cold
compress to your eye can help too.

Q. I've been puzzled about this
• ever since I got to the West
coast, and it's the question I'm
asked most often by people who
visit California from the East.
What is the difference between
prawns and shrimp?
A. According to Gilbert Van
• Dykhuizen, a biologist at the
Monterey Bay Aquarium who
looked up the difference for me,
British taxonomists use the term
shrimp to refer to creatures with
a "crangond-like appearance" and
prawn for creatures with a
"palaemonid structure."
This may make sense to a few
crustacean experts in England,
but, Van Dykhuizen says, apply
ing this distinction to specie 3 na
tive to areas other than Northern
Europe is "artificial."
In America, he says, the term
prawn just means "big shrimp."
