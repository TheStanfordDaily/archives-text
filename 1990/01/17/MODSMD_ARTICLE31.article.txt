# Calcium-rich milk can ward off crippling bone degeneration

One of the hottest nutritional
topics in the 1980s was the
mineral calcium. Because calcium
is essential for proper nerve im
pulses, adequate blood calcium
concentrations must be main
tained.
Further, calcium is needed by
the body to maintain bone
strength. Therefore, a dietary cal
cium deficiency will lead to
removal of calcium from the
bones. This continual removal
from the bones leads to the con

dition known as osteoporosis,
which is the most common of all
bone diseases.
Bone weakness from os
teoporosis can be a dangerous con
dition that often leads to increased
frequency of bone fractures.
Chronic deficiency of calcium is
necessary to lead to the disease,
so it will not happen overnight.
Osteoporosis is most commonly
associated with post-menopausal
women. For a reason still unclear
to researchers, women tend to be
protected from the disease until
after menopause.

For another unexplained rea
son, men tend to have less loss
of bone calcium throughout life
than women. Although the disease
iB associated with post
menopausal women, both men and
pre-menopausal women need to
make sure they protect them
selves against the disease.
Bone strength is determined by
gender, activity level, calcium in
take and other related factors. Al
though the relationships are
complex, researchers have found
evidence that keeping bone
strength and calcium levels high
during bone growth will lead to

greater protection later in life.
Therefore, people need to both
meet their dietary requirements
for calcium and remain active.
The recommended dietary al
lowance per day for calcium is
1,200 milligrams for men and
women up to 24 years of age and
800 milligrams after 24 years of
age. The amount absorbed
depends on age, phosphorous, fat
and fiber intake and other vari
ables.
The greater your body's need
for calcium, the more it will ab
sorb. Excess fat, fiber and phos
phorous in the diet can decrease
absorption.
The best dietary sources of cal
cium are low-fat dairy products.
Because excess fat can inhibit cal
cium absorption, ice cream and
fatty cheeses are not great
sources.
Dark green leafy vegetables,
which have a moderate amount
of calcium, are not necessarily
great calcium sources. Substances
naturally present in those vegeta
bles bind the calcium, rendering
it ineffective. It is, however, better
to get calcium in these forms than
not to get it at all.
The risks of calcium deficiency
are great, but overdoses carry as
sociated risks. Some people have
a familial tendency toward kidney
stone formation, and this can be
aggravated by excess calcium in
take.
Trying to incorporate calcium
rich dairy foods into your diet and
keeping physically active are the
best forms of protection for young
men and women against os
teoporosis.
Although calcium deficiencies
will not show up in adolescence,
the price can be paid later in life.
Therefore, try to be aware and
protect yourself from calcium
deficiency.
