## Grapplers battle Gators Stanford strong after winning Aggie Invite 
### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
Fresh from a weekend of action
in which it defeated Air Force and
Chico State in dual meets and
won the Aggie Invitational, the
Stanford wrestling team enters
tonight's match against San Fran
cisco State with confidence and
considerable momentum.
In San Francisco State, the 5-2
Cardinal is pitted against a team
which it has already wrestled once
this season. Stanford pinned San
Francisco on Nov. 29 by a 28-16
margin.
"When we wrestled them the
first time around, we were much
better conditioned (than San
Francisco)," said Coach Chris
Horpel.
Since November the Gators
have compiled a 5-6 record in dual
meets.
"Hopefully our team has been
improving faster than theirs so it
won't make any difference if their
conditioning is as good as ours,"
Horpel added.

One advantage Stanford will
have going into tonight's 7:30 p.m.
match at Burnham Pavilion is two
San Francisco forfeits.
Due to injuries, San Francisco
has to forfeit the 177-pound and
190-pound weight classes. But
Stanford has health problems of
its own. Mark Graham, the Car
dinal's 167-pounder, has been
sidelined with a knee injury for
the last few matches, and is not

expected back by tonight.
His replacement, Mat Nowlis,
has the flu and may not be able
to wrestle either. As of yesterday,
Horpel had not decided who would
wrestle at the 167-pound weight
class.
The Cardinal's two best
wrestlers, Steve Buddie (177) and
Ron Perry (190), will not see ac
tion due to the San Francisco for
feits. However, there will still be
some critical match-ups to watch.
Stanford senior Josh Lisle has
the most difficult challenge, as he
faces the Gator's Division II Ail-
American, Rick Goodwin in the
126-pound class. Goodwin has
moved up from the 118-pound
weight class, and Lisle has
dropped from the 134-pound
class. The two have never
wrestled each other.
In the 142-pound class, Stan
ford's James Dinette will battle
Chris Green, who gave Dinette a
tough match at the last dual meet.
San Francisco's toughest remain
ing wrestler is Matt Blevin. Stan
ford senior Trent Smith will try
to stop him.
