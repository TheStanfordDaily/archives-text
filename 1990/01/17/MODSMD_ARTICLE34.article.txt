# Cagers can shoot to higher orbit by rocketing UCLA
## 
### 
After taking its show on the road,
the men's basketball team finds it
self 2-2 in Pacific 10 Conference
play and at a turning point in the season.
Displaying its youthfulness a bit too
often, the Cardinal nonetheless at times
resembles a veteran squad capable of
playing with the best in the conference.
Tomorrow night's game against 16th
ranked UCLA provides Stanford with an
excellent chance to see just how far it
will go in 1990.
The logic goes something like this:
Before the season began, Stanford was
expected to go about 10-8 in league play.
The Cardinal could figure to win road
games against Washington State (mission
accomplished), Arizona State, Oregon
and USC. At the same time, Stanford
was a likely home loser versus Oregon
State (a done deed), UCLA and Arizona.
The Pac-10 appeared to be about the
nation's sixth best conference and could
expect to place three teams in the NCAA
Tournament — Stanford not among
them.
Stanford would finish about 19-9
(including Pac-10 Tournament games)
and be viewed as a contender for an NIT
bid.

So far, while things have gone pretty
much according to plan, a few surprises
have surfaced. A road win at Oregon
seems like a tough task. Meanwhile, the
loss to a disappointing Washington squad
in Seattle seems like a missed opportu
nity.
The Pac-10 appears to be a solid fifth
among Division I conferences behind the
Big Ten, Big East, Big Eight and ACC.
Four tournament berths is not out of the
question.
The $64,000 is: Does the Stanford
men's team have a chance of partaking
in March Madness? If-so, what will it
take to get there?
First, keep in mind that even an NIT
appearance in what was supposed to be
a "rebuilding" year would be quite an
achievement. By no means does that sug

gest the team shouldn't grab for the brass
ring. It's just a reminder that success in
1990 should be judged on different criteria
than success in 1989.
A victory in the battle with the Bruins
could do wonders for Stanford's postsea
son chances. Not only is UCLA in the
top 20, the Bruins are young and im
proving. By tournament time it's likely
that they'll be ranked even higher. Con
sequently, a Stanford triumph will be
more highly regarded as well.
Despite UCLA's lofty position in the
national rankings, though, a Stanford vic
tory hardly seems out of the question.
The Bruins have a lot of different weap
ons in Trevor Wilson, Don Mac Lean,
Gerald Madkins, Tracy Murray and the
rest but aren't really that impressive a
team.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, seems
to be greater than the sum of its parts.
With only Adam Keefe even approaching
household name status, Stanford is
achieving recognition in the conference
and among pundits across the country.
A suffocating man-to-man defense has
keyed the team so far. Stanford was
rumored to be lacking in athleticism, but
seeing the team in action one can quickly

see it's often more athletic than last year's
team.
UCLA doesn't play the kind of run
and-stun basketball of an Oklahoma or
UNLV. Instead, they feature some fast
breaking, occasional full-court pressure
and a lot of half-court basketball. The
kind of game Stanford can stay in with
a lot of teams.
Winning is another matter entirely.
Stanford must do less of the things it
does wrong to beat the Bruins. The Car
dinal has committed too many traveling
violations and thrown away too many
passes en route to an average of 17.2
turnovers per game. That number has
to be reduced the rest of the way — not
just tomorrow night.
And, for fear of beating another dead
horse, Stanford must hit some jump shots
from outside. At halftime of the Wash
ington game, two of the Cardinal's 18
points were on something other than a
dunk, layup or free throw. Against Wash
ington State, Stanford won by 20 but hit
exactly zero three-pointers.
Kenny Ammann is the team's most
consistent outside threat, hitting on 50.5
percent of his field-goal attempts. Am
mann has made 46 percent of his three

point attempts.
The quintet of Andrew Vlahov, John
Patrick, Marcus Lollie, Kenny Hicks and
Peter Dukes is shooting at a 36 percent
clip overall and only 24 percent from
behind the arc. Patrick is the best long
range shooter of the bunch so far with
a .410 mark on treys.
Lacking consistency from outside,
Stanford has been unable to keep
defenses from collapsing on Keefe all
season. In league play, the problem has
gotten even worse. Despite shooting .763
in Pac-10 play (and with a shot at the
all-time Stanford single-season record of
.671 held by John Revelli), Keefe is only
getting 9.5 shots per game. He should be
closer to twice that mark.
Vlahov, shooting .405 in the Pac-10, is
taking 10.5 shots i - game.
To shake things i a bit, Coach Mike
Montgomery has stmffled his starting
lineup. Deshon Wingate will start at small
forward, Vlahov will move to big forward
and Keefe will play center. Derek Bruton
will come off the bench.
Stanford can make a strong statement
tomorrow by showing improvement in the
problem areas and collecting the W.
