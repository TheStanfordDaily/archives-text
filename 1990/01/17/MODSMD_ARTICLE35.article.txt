# Shrine game played at Stanford Sunday
## 
### Aden Fine 
The East-West Shrine game,
which will be played this Sun
day at Stanford Stadium, is
America's oldest football all
star game, so it is only fitting
that it is the final all-star game
of the year.
The game, which will begin
at 11:40 a.m., features many
of the best college seniors in
the country, including 20 Ail-
Americans, led by Notre Dame
quarterback Tony Rice, In
diana running back Anthony
Thompson, Michigan State
Linebacker Percy Snow, and
college football's all-time
leading rusher Johnny Bailey
of Division II Texas A&I.
Stanford will be represented
by two players, linebacker Rob
Hinckley and defensive tackle
Lester Archambeau, while
neighboring California will
send quarterback Troy Taylor
and linebacker David Ortega.
Cal will also be represented by
Bruce Snyder, who will serve
as the head coach of the West
team. Jack Bicknell of Boston
College will be the head coach
for the East team.
Snyder hopes to have better
luck than the last time he
coached in Stanford Stadium,
when his Bears fell 27-17 to
the Cardinal in the Big Game.
Running back James Gray
rushed for 280 yards in Texas
Tech's 49-21 win over Duke in
the All-American Bowl, and
will power the offensive attack
for the West team.
Notre Dame's Rice will throw
to Savannah State receiver
Shannon Sharpe, the younger
brother of Green Bay Packer
Sterling Sharpe. Sterling
starred in the Shrine game two
years ago.
Of the 36 players on the West
team, 10 are from Texas and
12 are from California.
The game provides these
players and the rest of the 72
members of the two teams a
golden opportunity to show the

skills that made them stars to
the NFL scouts that will be
watching the game.
Although the game will ben
efit the players, the real goal
of this game, unlike the other
postseason all-star games, is to
benefit the Shriners Hospitals
for Crippled and Burned
Children. Over the 64 years the
game has been held, about 11
million dollars has been raised,
and with this year's attendance
expected to be about 70,000,
the game's organizers hope to
match last year's fundraising
effort of $300,000.
The game will be televised
nationally by ABC Sports, but
it will be blacked out locally.
Tickets are still available at the
Stanford Athletic Department
and all BASS/Ticketmaster
outlets. The prices are $15 and
$10 for reserved seats and $5
for general admission.
An added attraction to the
star-studded regular game will
be a halftime show entitled
"Kids-4-Kids." Among those
featured in the show are Neil
Patrick Harris — otherwise
known as Doogie Howser, M.D.;
Jerry "Leave it to Beaver"
Mathers and Gary Coleman of
"Diffrent Strokes."
In addition to the game, the
organizers have decided to kick
off the weekend with the first
ever "East-West Family Day,"
which will be held Saturday on
the Stanford campus. There
will be a parade, a run and an
autograph and picture-taking
session.
Palm Drive from El Camino
to Arboretum, Arboretum from
Palm to Galvez and Galvez
from Campus to El Camino will
be closed from 10:30 a.m. until
1 p.m. Saturday because of the
parade.
Players will sign autographs
and pose for pictures in tents
outside Gate 2 of the Stadium
from 1 to 2 p.m. on Saturday.
