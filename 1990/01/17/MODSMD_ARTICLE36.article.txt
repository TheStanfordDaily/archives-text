# Canadian swimmers drop by deGuerre
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
The NCAA recently attempted
to determine the proper role of
academics in the world of college
athletics, so the Stanford men's
swimming team will emphasize its
academic mission today with an
exhibition meet against the
Canadian National Team at
deGuerre Pool.
The exhibition moot at noon be
tween the Canadians and the Car
dinal was put on the schedule late,
and many of the Cardinal swim
mers have classes that last until
12:30 p.m. or that start at 1:15
p.m.

'The meet will be a
big challenge for us
because a lot of guys
will miss part or all of
the meet because of
class.'

"The meet will be a big chal
lenge for us because a lot of guys
will miss part or all of the meet
because of class," senior Doug Lil
lydahl said.

Many Stanford swimmers will
rush to the pool as soon as their
classes finish and will attempt to
use that brief moment to get men
tally prepared for their events.
The Canadian squad is stopping
at Stanford on its way to the Com
monwealth Games, two weeks
away. After swimming in
deGuerre, the Canadians will
travel to Mission Viejo to compete
against a club team.
"We have to expect them to
swim fast because the're only two
weeks away from their meet," Lil
lydahl said. "They are preparing
for a long-course, 50-meter cham
pionship meet, and they will be
far along in their tapers."

The meet will also allow a pos
sible future Cardinal to stick his
toes in the comfortable water of
deGuerre Pool for the first time.
Stanford has been recruiting
Eddie Parenti, a middle-distance
freestyler for the Canadian squad,
for next year's Cardinal team.
"This is a meet situation, and
we certainly don't like to lose,"
Lillydahl said. "I would definitely
expect better than practice-level
efforts. I don't know how consis
tent we will be across the board;
it's more of a scrimmage than a
dual meet."
The Cardinal, 2-1 in dual meets,
is coming off a close loss last
weekend in Ann Arbor to Michi
gan.
