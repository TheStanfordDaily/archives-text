# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
For sparking their respective Cardinal
teams to a pair of convincing victories last
weekend, women's basketball center Julie
Zeilstra and wrestling co-captain Steve
Buddie have been duly named The Daily's
Athletes of the Week.
For Zeilstra, the honor is merely the latest
in a string of awards that includes an ap
pearance in Sports Illustrated's regular fea

ture "Faces in the Crowd" after her senior
year of high school.
The 6-3 sophomore from Vernal, Utah
had a weekend on par with Joe Montana,
as she shot 71 percent from the floor and
pulled down 12 rebounds in Stanford's wins
over Washington and Washington State.
For her outstanding efforts, the Pacific
10 Conference named her Women's Basket
ball Player of the Week, an honor that ranks
up there with being named Daily Athlete
of the Week. Zeilstra's teammate, junior
Sonja Henning, is the other Stanford player
to garner the Pac-10 award this season.
In Stanford's 102-62 destruction of the
arch-rival Huskies, Zeilstra had 16 points
and eight rebounds. Two nights later, she
led all scorers with 27 points on 13 of 17
shooting as the Cardinal defeated Washing
ton State 92-70.
Stanford is a perfect 4-0 in conference
play, and Zeilstra leads the team in scoring
in those contests with a blistering 18.3 points
per game average. Last season, she was
named to the all-Pac-10 freshman team.

Buddie, a junior from Berea, Ohio, won
the decisive match to give Stanford a one
point victory over Air Force last weekend
at the Aggie Invitational.
His technical fall allowed the Cardinal to
come all the way back and nip the Falcons
124-123. Wrestling at 177 pounds, Buddie
won three matches on the weekend.
Cardinal coach Chris Horpel called Buddie

the "most outstanding wrestler of this
tournament. . . and this season." Buddie was
named a Freshman All-American two years
ago and last year qualified for the NCAAs.
