# Men, women netters top ranked again

### 
The recently released Volvo/
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches As
sociation rankings provide their
usual share of surprises — some
sensible, many mystifying.
With five women and two men
in their respective top 50s, Car
dinal players dominate the
rankings. Defending NCAA cham
pion Sandra Birch is the top
ranked woman in the nation.
While no one would argue with
that result, the placement of
Debbie Graham at No. 14 and
Lisa Green at No. 20 is hard to
rationalize. Both were top-10
players throughout the 1989
season.
It is not unusual for the
rankings to be called into ques
tion. In 1987, Stanford's Patty
Fendick was the defending NCAA
champion, in the midst of a 57-
match undefeated streak and
boasting two dominant wins over
Monique Javer. For her efforts,
Fendick was ranked No. 4 and
Javer No. 1.
Freshman Meredith McGrath is
ranked No. 3 and Teri Whitlinger
comes in at No. 8. Whitlinger had
a strong fall winning the Rolex
Regional Qualifier here at Stan
ford and the Milwaukee Tennis
Classic.
On the men's side, freshman
Jonathan Stark is rated sixth in
the country and sophomore Alex
O'Brien is ranked No. 23.

Junior Sandra Birch, the defending NCAA women's tennis champion, is ranked No. 1 in the preseason
tennis polls. Coach Frank Brennan's Cardinal women are favored to capture a fifth consecutive
national title in 1990. Not to be outdone, Stanford's men are also ranked No. 1 in the nation.
