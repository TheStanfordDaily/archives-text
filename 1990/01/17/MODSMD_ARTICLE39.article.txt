# Foreman wants to munch on Tyson next
## Portly senior-circuit champ has to wait for Holyfield bout first

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -
George Foreman thinks he knows
what the world wants â€” him
against heavyweight champion
Mike Tyson, not Tyson against
Evander Holyfield.
"Once everybody sees it's in the
best interests of boxing, they're
going to drop the imitation sweets
and go for the real ice cream,"
the 41-year-old Foreman said
Tuesday, the day after his second
round knockout of Gerry Cooney.
Billionaire Donald Trump, how
ever, thinks Tyson-Holyfield is
the real thing.
"This is the true heavyweight
championship fight the world is
waiting to see," Trump Plaza

president Jack O'Donnell said, re
ferring to the Tyson-Holyfield
match set for June 18 at the Con
vention Center.
Dan Duva, Holyfield's
promoter, said Trump has bought
the match from Don King, who
will promote it, for "the largest
site fee in the history of boxing."
The fee reportedly is $12 million.
Foreman, heavyweight cham
pion in 1973-74, suggested that
Tyson, scheduled to fight Buster
Douglas Feb. 11 in Tokyo, might
want to fight him rather than
Holyfield.
"I still think there's a chance
it won't happen," Foreman said
of the Tyson-Douglas match.

Duva, however, said at a news
conference at Trump Plaza after
Foreman's news conference at
Caesars that Tyson sees a fight
against the unbeaten Holyfield
"as the ultimate challenge."
Besides, Tyson seems to be
locked into a Holyfield match. The
champion dropped out of a defense
against Razor Ruddock because
of illness and the bout was not
rescheduled.
Should either Tyson or
Holyfield become injured or ill,
their contracts state "the fight
could be postponed, but it would
have to be rescheduled," Duva
said. "The fight is guaranteed."
Bob Arum, who promoted the

Foreman-Cooney fight, said
Foreman could fight Francesco
Damiani in the spring. The Italian
is recognized as champion of the
fledgling World Boxing Organiza
tion.
Arum said he would also offer
Foreman a number of opponents
and that "maybe at the end of
the year, we'll get Tyson."
Foreman, 20-0 with 19 knock
outs in his comeback which began
in 1987 after a 10-year retirement,
said he would like to fight once
a month.
"If you wait around for the big
money, you lose your edge,"
Foreman, guaranteed $1 million
for Monday night's work, said.
