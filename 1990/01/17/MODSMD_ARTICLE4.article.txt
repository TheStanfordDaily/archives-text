In their second recent victory over the
forces of indecent exposure, Stanford police
Monday caught the man suspected of ex
posing himself in parking structures —
literally with his pants down.
Steven Wilder, 32, of Sunnyvale, was ar
rested for indecent exposure and driving
under the influence of alcohol by Stanford
police officers around 2:40 p.m.
Earlier, two female Stanford students
walking near the Kappa Alpha fraternity
near Lake Lagunita noticed a man sitting
on a swing masturbating, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. The
man was wearing a windbreaker, San Fran
cisco Giants hat, sunglasses — and nothing
else.

The two students immediately reported
the incident to the police, who then tried
to surround the Lake Lagunita area,
Niemeyer said.
Police officers noticed a "suspicious per
son fitting Wilder's description" in a car
in a parking lot at 353 Campus Dr. As
soon as he saw the officers, Wilder tried
to drive away quickly, according to
Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said Wilder at first refused to
pull over when chased by police officers.
When he finally stopped, police found that
he still was not wearing pants. He was also
found to be intoxicated.
Niemeyer also noted that Wilder had
parked his car about a quarter of a mile
from the site of the indecent exposure. In
