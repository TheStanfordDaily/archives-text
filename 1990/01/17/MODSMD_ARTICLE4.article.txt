# Caught with pants down
## Parking garage flasher apprehended near Lake Lag 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
In their second recent victory over the
forces of indecent exposure, Stanford police
Monday caught the man suspected of ex
posing himself in parking structures —
literally with his pants down.
Steven Wilder, 32, of Sunnyvale, was ar
rested for indecent exposure and driving
under the influence of alcohol by Stanford
police officers around 2:40 p.m.
Earlier, two female Stanford students
walking near the Kappa Alpha fraternity
near Lake Lagunita noticed a man sitting
on a swing masturbating, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. The
man was wearing a windbreaker, San Fran
cisco Giants hat, sunglasses — and nothing
else.

The two students immediately reported
the incident to the police, who then tried
to surround the Lake Lagunita area,
Niemeyer said.
Police officers noticed a "suspicious per
son fitting Wilder's description" in a car
in a parking lot at 353 Campus Dr. As
soon as he saw the officers, Wilder tried
to drive away quickly, according to
Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said Wilder at first refused to
pull over when chased by police officers.
When he finally stopped, police found that
he still was not wearing pants. He was also
found to be intoxicated.
Niemeyer also noted that Wilder had
parked his car about a quarter of a mile
from the site of the indecent exposure. In
the process of running back to
his car, he apparently fell and
scraped his knee.
Wilder was taken into custody
after the two female students
identified him, Niemeyer said.
In addition, he has several prior
convictions for indecent exposure
and had just gotten off of proba
tion. He has not been released
from custody because he is being
charged with indecent exposure
with a prior conviction, a felony,
police said.

The man was
wearing a
windbreaker, San
Francisco Giants hat,
sunglasses — and
nothing else.

Police believe Wilder is the
same man who exposed himself
on two separate occasions to
women in parking structures on
campus.
In the case of the "bicycle flas
her," who was caught over winter

break, police are still looking for
witnesses and victims to
strengthen their case. In addition,
they are conducting photo lineups
with the victims who have re
ported indecent exposures over
the past few months, Niemeyer
said.
Niemeyer said that because in
decent exposures generally go un
reported, it is possible that this
flasher may have committed as
many as 50 exposures. He re
quested that anyone who has wit
nessed or has information about
an indecent exposure should con
tact the police to assist the inves
tigation.
