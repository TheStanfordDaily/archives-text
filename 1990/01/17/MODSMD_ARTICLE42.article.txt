Get ready for some mud
slinging. These days members of
the Kappa Alpha Order are busy
in the bottom of Lake Lagunita
with shovels, roto-tillers and fire
hoses churning up wet, squishy
squashy mud in preparation for
the Fourth Annual Kappa Alpha
Mud Volleyball Classic, to be held
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Every year, the 120 chapters of
KA across the country compete
to raise money for the Muscular
Dystrophy Association.
Muscular dystrophy is the con
dition in which the brain fails to
communicate with the muscles.
This debilitating genetic disease
eventually confines patients to
wheelchairs.

Funds raised Saturday will go
to provide clinical care, promote
research and support some 350
local patients, according to Leo
Hughes, coordinator of the Palo
Alto MDA chapter. The organiza
tion has spent $400,000 in fund
ing research at Stanford, he
added.
Four years ago, Stanford KA
members and Paul Westhelle,
then coordinator of the MDA,
came up with the idea for a mud
volleyball tournament, according
to Hughes.
Mike Rubenstein, KA director
of philanthropy and organizer of
this year's tournament, said the
event has come a long way. Par
ticipation in the tournament has
doubled since the first year, with
64 teams competing this year
compared to 32 in 1987, he said.

Of the 64 teams, 56 are from
Stanford, including one from the
administration, Rubenstein said.
Local businesses like Lancashire
Tavern and Wells Fargo Bank,
and student teams like the KA
chapter from the University of
Nevada at Reno make up the rest.
The order hopes to raise
$10,000 from the tournament, and
has already collected $7,000
toward that goal, Rubenstein said.
Student teams pay $100 to enter,
and business teams pay $150.
The rest of the money will come
from T-shirt and concession sales
on Saturday. KA also received
$1,300 from Program Board to
cover administrative cost like
photo-copying and advertising.
KA is expecting a large spec
tator turnout on Saturday, ac
cording to Rubenstein.
