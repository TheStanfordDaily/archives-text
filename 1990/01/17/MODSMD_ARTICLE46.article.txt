# ASSU supports Chinese students
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
While it stormed outside,
calm reigned over the ASSU
Senate. Meeting for an un
usually short time, the senators
considered four bills, each of
which passed on an undivided
voice vote.
By calling for the University
to reconsider its policy of clas
sifying post-doctoral students as
students and not employees, the
senate, in effect, urged the Uni
versity to protect Chinese stu
dents from the possibility of
forced repatriation.
Graduate student Weijia
Wang, representing the Associ
ation of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford, spoke on

behalf of the bill and explained
that "at this time there's no way
we can return to our country
safely, and for what we have
done we will be put into prison."
The association supported the
student-led revolt in China last
spring.
Post-doctoral students who
are classified as employees are
able to continue working follow
ing the completion of their ap
pointment. Such a classification
would allow Chinese nationals
to remain in the United States
for up to five years, making it
easier to apply for other work
visas.
Douglas Bone, author of the
bill, said "50 or more — perhaps
up to 100" students would be
affected by such a change.
In other senate business:

• Senators resolved to support
the You Can Make a Difference
Conference to be held on
campus Jan. 18 to 20. Solina
Kwan, co-author of the bill, said
holding the conference on
campus is an "honor in itself
for the University.
• Senators passed a bill sup
porting the University submis
sion of an application for a
California state grant to fund
an outdoor recycling project. In*
grid Nava, co-author of the bill,
said the purpose of the grant is
"to put up more recycling bins
around campus."
• Senators commended the
Black Student Union for helping
to realize "the vision that Mar
tin Luther King, Jr. had" in
celebrating the diversity of our
society.
