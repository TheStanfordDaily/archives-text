# Civil rights coalition confronts Stanford with charges of racism
## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
The Stanford workplace contains
"overt and systemic racism that seems
to be plaguing workers," according to a
spokesperson for the Bay Area Coalition
for Civil Rights.
The coalition held a press conference
yesterday with the United Stanford
Workers to release its report on examples
of employment discrimination at Stan
ford.
The 20-page report is the result of a
"tribunal" held last May in which 15
University employees testified on cases
of discrimination based on race, sex, dis
ability and sexual orientation.
Coalition chair Eva Paterson said there

was no formal attempt to verify the
claims of the University workers. "We
took them at their word," she said,
"We can't imagine that people would
come and lie," Paterson said. She said
the workers were testifying under oath,
hut that the coalition had no power to
enforce the oath.
University officials from the Board of
Trustees and the administration, as well
as specific supervisors and managers who
were allegedly involved in discrimination,
were invited to attend the May tribunal,
but none were present.
"The University had its opportunity
and chose not to do anything," said Gail
Kaufman, associate director of the public
interest law firm Equal Rights Advocates
and a member of the coalition.

The USW sees the coalition report as
a supplement to the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues report, USW field
representative Rodney Barnette said last
month. The USW was not included in
much of the UCMI staff subcommittee
report because of a low rate of response
from USW members to the subcommittee
survey.
The "tribunal" investigated cases such
as Gene Lopes, a black University em
ployee whose supervisor allegedly made
racist and sexist remarks. The supervisor
reportedly said to Lopes as he was paint
ing a wall with white paint insulation,
"I want this white. You know what I
mean by white, boy?"
The supervisor also allegedly said "all
women should be barefoot and pregnant."

The report concluded with seven rec
ommendations for the University m order
to reverse the "sorry picture of discrim
ination," coalition member Eva Paterson
said.
The first recommendation urged the
creation of a Commission on Employment
Discrimination that would be indepen
dent from the University. The commis
sion would include students, workers and
representatives from the USW and the
administration.
Other recommendations asked the Uni
versity to encourage the training of
workers for promotion, speed up the
grievance process for employment dis
crimination cases, and restate the
University's commitment to affirmative
action and equal pay for equal work.

The coalition looked into the University
grievance procedure for discrimination,
and determined that "Stanford Univer
sity has been stonewalling the grievance
procedure," according to coalition mem
ber Roberta Achtenberg. It recommended
that the "review of all complaints of overt
discriminatory behavior be expedited."
At the time of the tribunal, the USW
had about 200 grievances against the
University, with about 34 percent of them
involving discrimination, the report said.
A major focus of the report was the
conditions of workers at Webb Ranch.
Two Hispanic ranch laborers who worked
at the Stanford golf course for the Ath
letic Department testified at the May
tribunal and charged their super
visors with discrimination.
Webb Ranch workers are peri
odically loaned to the University
for certain jobs, especially in the
Athletic Department. Ranch
workers receive far less pay for
their services than non-ranch
workers who perform the same
jobs because most of the wages
go to Webb Ranch and not to the
workers.
Living conditions at Webb
Ranch were "perhaps the most
disturbing allegations" at the
tribunal, the report said.
"The key issue from Stanford's
standpoint appears to be what
level of responsibility the Univer
sity is prepared to accept ... in
addressing unarguably wretched
conditions for Webb Ranch
workers," it said.
The report's final recommenda
tion called for the University to
address the "substandard condi
tions" at the ranch. It also asked
the University to pay the ranch
workers at the same level as other

workers when they are working
for Stanford.
Another case was that of Stan
Shaver, a gay man who works for
University operations and main
tenance. After bringing his lover
to a Christmas party nine years
ago, Shaver was allegedly
harassed and called "faggot" by
one of his supervisors.
Paterson said it was "very ap
propriate" that the report was
being released so close to Martin
Luther King, Jr.'s birthday. "Jus
tice deferred is justice denied," she
quoted King as saying, as she
stressed the urgent need for Uni
versity changes.
Although the report is "by no
means comprehensive" because of
the limited scope of the
"tribunal," Kaufman said the
findings "seem to indicate a pat
tern of discrimination."
The next step for the coalition
will be to try to arrange a meeting
with University President Donald
Kennedy to discuss the report's
recommendations, Paterson said.
A copy of the report was sent
by the coalition to Kennedy's of
fice this morning. It was imme
diately forwarded to Cecilia
Burciaga, acting senior associate

provost, who is in charge of im
plementing the UCMI recommen
dations.
In response to the coalition
report, Burciaga yesterday sent
Paterson a letter at the request
of Kennedy to assure the coalition
that "the University remains firm
in its commitment to create an
interactive multicultural campus
atmosphere." Burciaga compared
the coalition report to that of the
UCMI, noting the similarities in
the recommendations of both
reports.
Although Burciaga said the
University would take no part in
collective bargaining between
Webb Ranch and the USW, she
invited Paterson to meet "to dis
cuss these mutual concerns fur
ther."
"We do regret, however, that we
did not have the opportunity to
review or discuss the report in
advance of your press conference
today," Burciaga said in the letter.
The coalition was established
in 1985 to "resist the efforts of
the Reagan Administration," ac
cording to Eva Paterson, who
chaired the "tribunal." The coa
lition "has become a voice for civil
rights," Kaufman said.

Trustees and the administration, as well
as specific supervisors and managers who
were allegedly involved in discrimination,
were invited to attend the May tribunal,
but none were present.
"The University had its opportunity
and chose not to do anything," said Gail
Kaufman, associate director of the public
interest law firm Equal Rights Advocates
and a member of the coalition.

The USW sees the coalition report as
a supplement to the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues report, USW field
representative Rodney Barnette said last
month. The USW was not included in
much of the UCMI staff subcommittee
report because of a low rate of response
from USW members to the subcommittee
survey.
The "tribunal" investigated cases such
as Gene Lopes, a black University em
ployee whose supervisor allegedly made
racist and sexist remarks. The supervisor
reportedly said to Lopes as he was paint
ing a wall with white paint insulation,
"I want this white. You know what I
mean by white, boy?"
The supervisor also allegedly said "all
women should be barefoot and pregnant."

The report concluded with seven rec
ommendations for the University m order
to reverse the "sorry picture of discrim
ination," coalition member Eva Paterson
said.
The first recommendation urged the
creation of a Commission on Employment
Discrimination that would be indepen
dent from the University. The commis
sion would include students, workers and
representatives from the USW and the
administration.
Other recommendations asked the Uni
versity to encourage the training of
workers for promotion, speed up the
grievance process for employment dis
crimination cases, and restate the
University's commitment to affirmative
action and equal pay for equal work.

The coalition looked into the University
grievance procedure for discrimination,
and determined that "Stanford Univer
sity has been stonewalling the grievance
procedure," according to coalition mem
ber Roberta Achtenberg. It recommended
that the "review of all complaints of overt
discriminatory behavior be expedited."
At the time of the tribunal, the USW
had about 200 grievances against the
University, with about 34 percent of them
involving discrimination, the report said.
A major focus of the report was the
conditions of workers at Webb Ranch.
Two Hispanic ranch laborers who worked
at the Stanford golf course for the Ath
letic Department testified at the May
tribunal and charged their super
visors with discrimination.
Webb Ranch workers are peri
odically loaned to the University
for certain jobs, especially in the
Athletic Department. Ranch
workers receive far less pay for
their services than non-ranch
workers who perform the same
jobs because most of the wages
go to Webb Ranch and not to the
workers.
Living conditions at Webb
Ranch were "perhaps the most
disturbing allegations" at the
tribunal, the report said.
"The key issue from Stanford's
standpoint appears to be what
level of responsibility the Univer
sity is prepared to accept ... in
addressing unarguably wretched
conditions for Webb Ranch
workers," it said.
The report's final recommenda
tion called for the University to
address the "substandard condi
tions" at the ranch. It also asked
the University to pay the ranch
workers at the same level as other

workers when they are working
for Stanford.
Another case was that of Stan
Shaver, a gay man who works for
University operations and main
tenance. After bringing his lover
to a Christmas party nine years
ago, Shaver was allegedly
harassed and called "faggot" by
one of his supervisors.
Paterson said it was "very ap
propriate" that the report was
being released so close to Martin
Luther King, Jr.'s birthday. "Jus
tice deferred is justice denied," she
quoted King as saying, as she
stressed the urgent need for Uni
versity changes.
Although the report is "by no
means comprehensive" because of
the limited scope of the
"tribunal," Kaufman said the
findings "seem to indicate a pat
tern of discrimination."
The next step for the coalition
will be to try to arrange a meeting
with University President Donald
Kennedy to discuss the report's
recommendations, Paterson said.
A copy of the report was sent
by the coalition to Kennedy's of
fice this morning. It was imme
diately forwarded to Cecilia
Burciaga, acting senior associate

provost, who is in charge of im
plementing the UCMI recommen
dations.
In response to the coalition
report, Burciaga yesterday sent
Paterson a letter at the request
of Kennedy to assure the coalition
that "the University remains firm
in its commitment to create an
interactive multicultural campus
atmosphere." Burciaga compared
the coalition report to that of the
UCMI, noting the similarities in
the recommendations of both
reports.
Although Burciaga said the
University would take no part in
collective bargaining between
Webb Ranch and the USW, she
invited Paterson to meet "to dis
cuss these mutual concerns fur
ther."
"We do regret, however, that we
did not have the opportunity to
review or discuss the report in
advance of your press conference
today," Burciaga said in the letter.
The coalition was established
in 1985 to "resist the efforts of
the Reagan Administration," ac
cording to Eva Paterson, who
chaired the "tribunal." The coa
lition "has become a voice for civil
rights," Kaufman said.
The Stanford workplace contains
"overt and systemic racism that seems
to be plaguing workers," according to a
spokesperson for the Bay Area Coalition
for Civil Rights.
The coalition held a press conference
yesterday with the United Stanford
Workers to release its report on examples
of employment discrimination at Stan
ford.
The 20-page report is the result of a
"tribunal" held last May in which 15
University employees testified on cases
of discrimination based on race, sex, dis
ability and sexual orientation.
Coalition chair Eva Paterson said there

was no formal attempt to verify the
claims of the University workers. "We
took them at their word," she said,
"We can't imagine that people would
come and lie," Paterson said. She said
the workers were testifying under oath,
hut that the coalition had no power to
enforce the oath.
