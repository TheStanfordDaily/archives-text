# Civil rights coalition confronts Stanford with charges of racism
## 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
The Stanford workplace contains
"overt and systemic racism that seems
to be plaguing workers," according to a
spokesperson for the Bay Area Coalition
for Civil Rights.
The coalition held a press conference
yesterday with the United Stanford
Workers to release its report on examples
of employment discrimination at Stan
ford.
The 20-page report is the result of a
"tribunal" held last May in which 15
University employees testified on cases
of discrimination based on race, sex, dis
ability and sexual orientation.
Coalition chair Eva Paterson said there

was no formal attempt to verify the
claims of the University workers. "We
took them at their word," she said,
"We can't imagine that people would
come and lie," Paterson said. She said
the workers were testifying under oath,
hut that the coalition had no power to
enforce the oath.
University officials from the Board of
Trustees and the administration, as well
as specific supervisors and managers who
were allegedly involved in discrimination,
were invited to attend the May tribunal,
but none were present.
"The University had its opportunity
and chose not to do anything," said Gail
Kaufman, associate director of the public
interest law firm Equal Rights Advocates
and a member of the coalition.

The USW sees the coalition report as
a supplement to the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues report, USW field
representative Rodney Barnette said last
month. The USW was not included in
much of the UCMI staff subcommittee
report because of a low rate of response
from USW members to the subcommittee
survey.
The "tribunal" investigated cases such
as Gene Lopes, a black University em
ployee whose supervisor allegedly made
racist and sexist remarks. The supervisor
reportedly said to Lopes as he was paint
ing a wall with white paint insulation,
"I want this white. You know what I
mean by white, boy?"
The supervisor also allegedly said "all
women should be barefoot and pregnant."

The report concluded with seven rec
ommendations for the University m order
to reverse the "sorry picture of discrim
ination," coalition member Eva Paterson
said.
The first recommendation urged the
creation of a Commission on Employment
Discrimination that would be indepen
dent from the University. The commis
sion would include students, workers and
representatives from the USW and the
administration.
Other recommendations asked the Uni
versity to encourage the training of
workers for promotion, speed up the
grievance process for employment dis
crimination cases, and restate the
University's commitment to affirmative
action and equal pay for equal work.

The coalition looked into the University
grievance procedure for discrimination,
and determined that "Stanford Univer
sity has been stonewalling the grievance
procedure," according to coalition mem
ber Roberta Achtenberg. It recommended
that the "review of all complaints of overt
discriminatory behavior be expedited."
At the time of the tribunal, the USW
had about 200 grievances against the
University, with about 34 percent of them
involving discrimination, the report said.
A major focus of the report was the
conditions of workers at Webb Ranch.
Two Hispanic ranch laborers who worked
at the Stanford golf course for the Ath
letic Department testified at the May
