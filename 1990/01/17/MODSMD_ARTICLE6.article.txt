See Spot removed and replaced
with more challenging and
literary texts in order to improve
the language ability for "at-risk"
students — nearly one-third of
school children from poor and im
migrant backgrounds in danger of
dropping out of school or receiving
an inferior education.
What Henry Levin, Stanford
professor of education and eco
nomics, has been implementing in
nearly 50 schools nationwide since
1987 is a radical new educational
approach to improve the lot of
"at-risk" kids.
Rather than yanking slow
learners out of classes for
remedial instruction, Levin advo
cates giving them special attention
while allowing them to participate
in the same lessons with the rest
of their class.
"We're trying to turn every
thing around," Levin said. "In the
past, schools have tried to slow
(at-risk) kids down, and they've
grown farther and farther be
hind."
Teaching disadvantaged stu

dents alongside their peers seems
to be successful in the classroom
of Luisa Proper, a first-grade
teacher at the predominantly La
tino and Asian Hoover School in
Redwood City, one of the first
schools to implement Levin's pro
gram.
"By teaching the whole group,
we're using the whole group as
models for the disadvantaged
children," Proper said. "They
don't feel like they're segregated
or slower. I get a sense everyone
is improving."
Curriculum for at-risk students
has dramatically changed in
Levin's accelerated classes. No
more do these students trudge
through basic readers such as the
classic "Dick and Jane" books.
Instead, they read works of
literature and poetry "in order to
understand what the words mean
from context," Levin said. "Even
if they never saw the alphabet or
Sesame Street, they can learn the

language this way."
Levin said his program rests on
three main principles. Calling on
his expertise in economics, he said
faculty should emphasize a "unity
of purpose" in schools, much as
workers do in a business.
Instruction consistent among
different grade levels created by
teachers who work together
stands a better chance of educat
ing "at-risk" students over a long
period of time than does a frag
mented curriculum.
In addition, Levin said he
believes many of the educational
decisions must be made on-site,
and teachers must be made re
sponsible for their own decisions,
for teachers answering to a higher
authority "only go through the
daily motions," he said.
And rather than stigmatizing
disadvantaged students for aca
demic deficits, Levin advocates "a
different kind of pedagogy," he
said. "All children have gifts; our
job is to find them and build on
the strengths."
Though his program was first
implemented in 1987, more than
50 schools across the country have
adopted the accelerated approach
for "at-risk" students, including
25 Illinois schools which recently
implemented the program.

Convinced that the use of simple texts actually hinders slow learners, Henry Levin has a radical
approach for helping these children. A professor of education and economics, Levin advocates
allowing those "at-risk" students to continue lessons with the rest of their class.
