# AAs help answer major questions
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
What could possibly possess
someone to wake up at 9 a.m. on
a Sunday morning, after three
and a half hours of sleep?
For junior James Ratzliff, it is
the opportunity to have brunch
with his freshmen advisees at
Florence Moore Hall.
Ratzliff, an advising associate
in Paloma House, takes his job
seriously.
"Being an advising associate is

a 24-hours-a-day,
seven-days-a
week job,"
Ratzliff said.
"You always have
to be there for
your advisees to
show your con
cern for them."
Ratzliff and
264 other stu-

dents have voluntarily assumed
such a commitment to help fresh
men feel at home on the Farm.
Their contributions are seen by
many Stanford students as the
strongest part of their premajor
advising experiences.
AAs act as links between a fac
ulty adviser and his or her advis
ing group, often facilitating
arrangements for meetings.
According to Kara Kerns, this
year's AA coordinator, AAs are as
signed to freshmen on the basis
of shared interests, making them
ideally suited to offer information
on specific classes.
"James had taken a lot of the
classes I was thinking of, so it
was nice to get that inside knowl
edge," said Kristin Hansen, one
of Ratzliffs freshman advisees.
But AAs are also students who
are exposed to all parts of Stan
ford and can act as a balance
against faculty who are focused
in one area.
Rachel Carr, a senior in psy
chology, came to Stanford plan
ning to attend medical school. But
as she began to explore other op
tions, she lost interest in medi
cine.
"I felt like my adviser wanted
me to continue the premed track
because he was in the Med Center,
whereas my AA seemed more con
cerned about what was best for
me as an individual," Carr said.
"This is the experience I've
heard from a lot of people — good

AA, bad adviser — particularly in
the preprofessional fields ad
visers, where advisers have many
other concerns," she added.
Further, AAs make it easier to
recruit faculty advisers, who no
longer have to worry about fine
details, said Civil Engineering
Prof. Gil Masters, who has been
advising freshmen for 10 years.
The AA program has evolved
over the past decade from a pilot
program designed to give addi
tional guidance to students in all
freshmen dormitories into a
University-wide system.
The original program assumed
that freshmen in four-class dorms
did not need AAs since they al
ready had access to many up
perclass students for advice.
Now, there are AAs living in
every four-class dorm, ready to
assist their freshmen as needed,
and for freshmen in all-freshmen
dorms, AAs are just a phone call
away.
In the course of her five years
at Stanford, senior Sophia
Colamarino has become a virtual
living history of the program.
As a freshman, she lived in a
four-class dorm and only had a
faculty adviser. During her soph
omore year, Colamarino became
an AA, but she found the program
to be highly decentralized; AAs
acted as secretaries for their ad
visers, and many had little contact
with the Undergraduate Advising
Center, she said.
As a junior, she watched as the
program experienced yet another
setback.
"Halfway through the year, the
AA coordinator quit, the program
ran over budget, and all the AAs
were left floundering,"
Colamarino said.
But over the past two years,
the AA program has emphasized
motivation and commitment.
Colamarino credits David Kim,

last year's AA coordinator, for
refocusing the program. Kim said
he streamlined the operation
using ideas from Residential Ed
ucation and other campus pro
grams.
To help AAs assist freshmen in
academic planning, the advising
center now holds a series of
workshops for AAs to help them
see Stanford from the perspective
of a freshman once more, and to
share ideas on how to help new
students.
"I've gotten really good feed
back," Kerns said. "Orientation

went really well."
The workshops
"really motivate
you, make you
feel like part of a
team," said senior
Sarah Dee, an AA
in Branner Hall.
But even the
most thorough
training cannot

prepare AAs for spontaneous
problems. Immediately after the
Oct. 17 earthquake, the Under
graduate Advising Center asked
AAs to check whether freshmen
were feeling distress, advising cen
ter director Hector Cuevas said.
"We wanted instant communi
cation to the freshmen to let them
know we were thinking about
them," he said.
Many AAs said they applied for
the position because of a desire
to make the transition to college
smoother for incoming students.
But some said they find their at
tempts to interact with the fresh
men socially frustrated.
"The thing that makes being
an AA difficult is that my advisees
don't think of me as a normal
person," Dee said. "They think of
me as a superacademic nerd."
Other students said they were
motivated to become AAs by their
own freshmen advising experi
ences.
Although this is her first year
as an AA, "Linda," an AA who
asked to remain anonymous, said
people seem to care more about
advising this year.
Most AA's in the workshops said
they had poor advising experi
ences as freshmen, Linda said.
But senior Perry Bechky, an AA
in Roble Hall, noted that there
are also "a lot of AAs who joined
because they had a good advising
experience, one that they wanted
to pass on."

did not need AAs since they al
ready had access to many up
perclass students for advice.
Now, there are AAs living in
every four-class dorm, ready to
assist their freshmen as needed,
and for freshmen in all-freshmen
dorms, AAs are just a phone call
away.
In the course of her five years
at Stanford, senior Sophia
Colamarino has become a virtual
living history of the program.
As a freshman, she lived in a
four-class dorm and only had a
faculty adviser. During her soph
omore year, Colamarino became
an AA, but she found the program
to be highly decentralized; AAs
acted as secretaries for their ad
visers, and many had little contact
with the Undergraduate Advising
Center, she said.
As a junior, she watched as the
program experienced yet another
setback.
"Halfway through the year, the
AA coordinator quit, the program
ran over budget, and all the AAs
were left floundering,"
Colamarino said.
But over the past two years,
the AA program has emphasized
motivation and commitment.
Colamarino credits David Kim,

last year's AA coordinator, for
refocusing the program. Kim said
he streamlined the operation
using ideas from Residential Ed
ucation and other campus pro
grams.
To help AAs assist freshmen in
academic planning, the advising
center now holds a series of
workshops for AAs to help them
see Stanford from the perspective
of a freshman once more, and to
share ideas on how to help new
students.
"I've gotten really good feed
back," Kerns said. "Orientation

went really well."
The workshops
"really motivate
you, make you
feel like part of a
team," said senior
Sarah Dee, an AA
in Branner Hall.
But even the
most thorough
training cannot

prepare AAs for spontaneous
problems. Immediately after the
Oct. 17 earthquake, the Under
graduate Advising Center asked
AAs to check whether freshmen
were feeling distress, advising cen
ter director Hector Cuevas said.
"We wanted instant communi
cation to the freshmen to let them
know we were thinking about
them," he said.
Many AAs said they applied for
the position because of a desire
to make the transition to college
smoother for incoming students.
But some said they find their at
tempts to interact with the fresh
men socially frustrated.
"The thing that makes being
an AA difficult is that my advisees
don't think of me as a normal
person," Dee said. "They think of
me as a superacademic nerd."
Other students said they were
motivated to become AAs by their
own freshmen advising experi
ences.
Although this is her first year
as an AA, "Linda," an AA who
asked to remain anonymous, said
people seem to care more about
advising this year.
Most AA's in the workshops said
they had poor advising experi
ences as freshmen, Linda said.
But senior Perry Bechky, an AA
in Roble Hall, noted that there
are also "a lot of AAs who joined
because they had a good advising
experience, one that they wanted
to pass on."

What could possibly possess
someone to wake up at 9 a.m. on
a Sunday morning, after three
and a half hours of sleep?
For junior James Ratzliff, it is
the opportunity to have brunch
with his freshmen advisees at
Florence Moore Hall.
Ratzliff, an advising associate
in Paloma House, takes his job
seriously.
"Being an advising associate is

a 24-hours-a-day,
seven-days-a
week job,"
Ratzliff said.
"You always have
to be there for
your advisees to
show your con
cern for them."
Ratzliff and
264 other stu-

dents have voluntarily assumed
such a commitment to help fresh
men feel at home on the Farm.
Their contributions are seen by
many Stanford students as the
strongest part of their premajor
advising experiences.
AAs act as links between a fac
ulty adviser and his or her advis
ing group, often facilitating
arrangements for meetings.
According to Kara Kerns, this
year's AA coordinator, AAs are as
signed to freshmen on the basis
of shared interests, making them
ideally suited to offer information
on specific classes.
"James had taken a lot of the
classes I was thinking of, so it
was nice to get that inside knowl
edge," said Kristin Hansen, one
of Ratzliffs freshman advisees.
But AAs are also students who
are exposed to all parts of Stan
ford and can act as a balance
against faculty who are focused
in one area.
Rachel Carr, a senior in psy
chology, came to Stanford plan
ning to attend medical school. But
as she began to explore other op
tions, she lost interest in medi
cine.
"I felt like my adviser wanted
me to continue the premed track
because he was in the Med Center,
whereas my AA seemed more con
cerned about what was best for
me as an individual," Carr said.
"This is the experience I've
heard from a lot of people — good

AA, bad adviser — particularly in
the preprofessional fields ad
visers, where advisers have many
other concerns," she added.
Further, AAs make it easier to
recruit faculty advisers, who no
longer have to worry about fine
details, said Civil Engineering
Prof. Gil Masters, who has been
advising freshmen for 10 years.
The AA program has evolved
over the past decade from a pilot
program designed to give addi
tional guidance to students in all
freshmen dormitories into a
University-wide system.
The original program assumed
that freshmen in four-class dorms
did not need AAs since they al
ready had access to many up
