renowned research are the reasons
for Capital Appreciation Fund's
success. The nind's go-anywhere
approach to aggressive stock invest

With any investment, past performance can't guarantee future results. Stock fund share prices and returns vary, so that you may have a gain or loss when you sell
shares. But by their nature, stock funds are designed to deliver long-term results.
Of course, investment performance is only one criterion when considering appropriate retirement plan investments. Fidelity also offers you active professional
investment management, a broad range of investment options, extensive educational materials, and a dedicated retirement service group.
