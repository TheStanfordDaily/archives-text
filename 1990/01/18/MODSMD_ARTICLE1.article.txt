### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
A trio of speakers, including
the daughter of civil rights
leader Malcolm X, urged a Stan
ford audience to revitalize the
legacy of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. by making bis commit
ment to equality a part of their
everyday lives.
Each speaker earned a stand
ing ovation from the capacity
crowd at Kresge Auditorium last

night, reminding the audience
that the civil rights movement
resulted from individual
struggles.
Attallah Shabazz, Malcolm
X's daughter, said there were
many who lived and died to
create opportunities for people
of color today, "not just Malcolm
and Martin."
"The things that enabled
them to achieve were dedication,
commitment and humility," said
Shabazz at the program spon

sored by the Black Student Un
ion, the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
and the University's Martin Lu
ther King Commemoration
Committee. "And that's what
we're lacking. We have to start
with the basics."
People of color should make
special efforts to recognize the
contributions of those pioneers
and should make it part of their
daily agenda to strive for justice

Rose Sanders sang "Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me 'Round" last night In Kresge Auditorium
and told the capacity crowd of the ongoing struggle for civil rights in Selma, Ala. — the birthplace
of the Voting Rights Act.
as their parents did before them,
she said.
The black household no longer
has the same integrity as that of
earlier decades, Shabazz said. All
people must work to restore that
structure, she added.
"Don't worry about tomorrow
until you have figured out what
you have individually done today,"
Shabazz said.
People of color can no longer
live as victims if they wish to be
treated as equals, Shabazz said.
They cannot ignore the heritage
of their parents and predecessors
if they wish to achieve social jus
tice.
"Even the ones who think
they're hiding it go to sleep and
hear that whisper: Negro," she
explained.
Rose Sanders, chair of a com
mittee celebrating the 25th anni

versary of the Selma, Ala. march,
echoed Shabazz's comments.
People bled and died en route
to Selma, hoping to earn equal
access for people of color to vote,
Sanders said. At the time of the
march, many thought their efforts
would ensure a full democracy.
But for the majority of blacks
and Hispanics, the achievement of
King's dream is as distant now as
it was 25 years ago, she said. Only
a renewed thirst for justice could
bring it nearer, she added.
"The promised land is as far
away as our unwillingness to plan
and work to make it happen," she
said. "It's as close as our commit
ment."
But a 1990-based civil rights
movement would face substan
tially different challenges than
that of- the 19605, said Pedro
Noguera, a lecturer in UC-
Berkeley's Afro-American Studies
Department.
No government officials will
work to secure justice for people
of color and the poor, he added.
