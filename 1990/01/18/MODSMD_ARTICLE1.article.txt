### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
A trio of speakers, including
the daughter of civil rights
leader Malcolm X, urged a Stan
ford audience to revitalize the
legacy of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. by making bis commit
ment to equality a part of their
everyday lives.
Each speaker earned a stand
ing ovation from the capacity
crowd at Kresge Auditorium last

night, reminding the audience
that the civil rights movement
resulted from individual
struggles.
Attallah Shabazz, Malcolm
X's daughter, said there were
many who lived and died to
create opportunities for people
of color today, "not just Malcolm
and Martin."
"The things that enabled
them to achieve were dedication,
commitment and humility," said
Shabazz at the program spon

sored by the Black Student Un
ion, the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
and the University's Martin Lu
ther King Commemoration
Committee. "And that's what
we're lacking. We have to start
with the basics."
People of color should make
special efforts to recognize the
contributions of those pioneers
and should make it part of their
daily agenda to strive for justice
