## Soviet civil war continues

MOSCOW (AP) â€” More than
11,000 new soldiers arrived yes
terday to end battles between
roving bands of Armenians and
Azerbaijanis, who erected bar
ricades to block the troops and
tried to steal their armored
vehicles.
The official death toll from the
clashes in the southern republic
of Azerbaijan rose to 58, mostly
Armenians, and new fighting was
reported. At least 169 people have
been injured since the bloodletting
began Saturday.
The reinforcements dispatched
to the region on Tuesday "haven't
helped yet because they haven't
started to act," said Dmitri Selez
nyov, a spokesman for the Interior
Ministry in Moscow.
Azerbaijanis staged protests in
their republic's capital, Baku, and
elsewhere to demand they be
armed and allowed to defend their
claim to the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh, an predomi
nantly Armenian enclave in Azer
baijan, newspapers and officials
said today.
About 50,000 people attended a
rally in the Armenian capital
Yerevan yesterday to hear reports
about the fighting, Armenian ac

tivist Karen Shakhbazyan said.
Azerbaijanis blocked a military
airfield and roads to the city of
Gandzha preventing arriving
troops from reaching battle areas,
the Tass news agency reported.
The action was taken at the re
quest of the Azerbaijani People's
Front, a grassroots political group
that has organized anti-Armenian
protests, Tass said.
In bordering Armenia to the
west, people were still breaking
into police stations and other
arms repositories in search of
weapons, said Seleznyov.
He said that in the past 24
hours there had been 64 attacks
on Armenian homes in Baku,
where the violence exploded Sat
urday night with mob attacks on
Armenians. "It's a terrible thing,"
he said.
On Tuesday, Tass said 2,000
people armed with anti-aircraft
guns and other artillery were
massing on hills around Nagorno-
Karabakh, the flashpoint for the
neighboring groups' ethnic
hatreds.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
declared a state of emergency in
the strife-torn mountain area
Monday night, empowering the

government to deploy units of the
Soviet army, navy and KGB to
protect lives and guard vital in
stallations such as railroads.
More than 6,000 additional in
ternal security troops were sent
Tuesday to reinforce existing In
terior Ministry detachments, Tass
said. To assist them, more than
5,000 Red Army soldiers, who
traditionally carry heavier
weaponry, also were dispatched,
Tass said.
The troops were ordered to get
tougher with the fighters, Selez
nyov said, and soldiers opened fire
Tuesday when an armed group
tried to take five armored person
nel carriers near the village of
Tazikend.
"We can't bring ourselves to
pronounce it out loud, but what
is happening now ... can unam
biguously be termed a civil war,"
correspondent O. Shapovalov
wrote in the newspaper Kom
somolskaya Pravda.
The Bush administration sup
ported Gorbachev's use of troops
in the region, known as the south
ern Caucasus, and criticized
feuding Azerbaijanis and Ar
menians for "revisiting old ethnic
hatreds."
