# Colombia's drug war called a success; drug lords concede
## 
### 
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — A message
purported to be from Colombia's drug
lords today declared the government the
winner in the war on drugs and offered
to halt illegal activities in exchange for
an amnesty.
The communique was given to Patricia
Echavarria, who was set free yesterday
after being kidnapped with her daughter
Dec. 16. Mrs. Echavarria is the wife of
a prominent doctor in the drug capital
of Medellin.
"We accept the triumph of the state,"
said the communique from The Ex
traditables, the armed wing of the na
tion's powerful drug lords. "Thus we will
lay down our arms and abandon our ob
jectives for the benefit of the highest
interests of the fatherland."

The communique came in response to
a call Monday by the Catholic Church
and political leaders for drug cartels to
release their hostages and end drug traf
ficking.
"We submit to the existing legal es
tablishment in the hope of obtaining from
the government and from society respect
for our rights and our return to our
families and communities," it said.
"We have decided to suspend the ship
ment of drugs and surrender the weapons,
explosives, laboratories, hostages, the
clandestine landing strips and other ef
fects related to our activities at such a
time as we are granted constitutional and
legal guarantees," the communique con
tinued.
Their statement appeared to demand

an amnesty that would guarantee they
would not face criminal charges.
The drug barons have previously
demanded a full amnesty and an end to
extraditions of drug suspects to the
United States.
While President Virgilio Barco said
Tuesday he would not rule out talks with
drug traffickers, Interior Minister Carlos
Lemos Simmonds said Colombian law
does not allow an amnesty for common
criminals.
Barco began his crackdown on the
cocaine cartels after the assassination in
August of a leading presidential candi
date. As part of the crackdown, he revived
an extradition treaty with the United
States, which drew up a list of the 12
most-wanted drug traffickers.

The Extraditables take their name
from the list.
The communique said Mrs. Echavarria
and her daughter, Dina, had been freed
as proof of the cartels' desire to make
peace.
The two were released in a neighbor
hood built by Medellin cartel leader Pablo
Escobar Gaviria for the poor people of
Medellin.
In the 11-point message, The Ex
traditables said: "We undertake that
there will be no explosive bombings in
any part of the national territory and
have ordered the suspension of all type
of executions of political figures, govern
ment and labor officials, members of the
judiciary, newsmen, policemen and the
military."

They also offered to act as mediators
in efforts to end activities by other groups
operating outside the law, "for the sole
purpose of ending the violence which
harms and shatters our Colombian fa
therland."
So far, Colombia has sent 11 drug
suspects to the United States to face
charges, but none is on the most-wanted
list.
In an effort to stop extraditions, traf
fickers responded with a campaign of
bombings and other violent attacks that
killed at least 209 people.
The government adso believes drug traf
fickers bombed a Colombian passenger
jet that crashed outside Bogota in No
vember, killing 107 people.
