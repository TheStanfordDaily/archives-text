Dukakis apologizes
BOSTON (AP) - Gov. Mi
chael S. Dukakis said he knows
many Massachusetts' residents
feel angered and betrayed by
his presidential loss and the
damage it did to the state.
"It's clear to me now that I
underestimated the amount of
time and energy it takes to seek
the modern presidency. Trying
to do two jobs at the same time
was more difficult and more
grueling than 1 expected," Du
kakis said in his final State of
the State speech Tuesday.
"And I underestimated the
toll it would take on my family,
too."
Dukakis' wife, Kitty, entered
an alcoholism treatment pro
gram shortly after his loss.
The state Legislature still
has not balanced the state's $12
billion budget, which is about
$500 million in the red.
