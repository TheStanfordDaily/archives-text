# Bush previews his state of nation address

### 
WASHINGTON >AP) — President Bush is
offering sneak previews of his maiden State
of the Union address in speeches and appear
ances around the country that seek to high
light his agenda for "a world at peace."
Bush has been laying down the basic themes
that aides say he will sound in the annual
presidential speech to a joint House-Senate
session on the evening of Jan. 31.
He highlighted key domestic priorities —
strengthening the Clean Air Act, a lower cap
ital gains tax, the war on drugs and crime,
education and an overhaul of farm programs
— in a kickoff speech last week to the Amer
ican Farm Bureau in Orlando, Fla.
A few days later, Bush's address to the
Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce laid down
his basic defense position: he would not
"naively cut the muscle out of our defense
posture" despite a relaxation of tensions in
Eastern Europe.
Bush said Congress shouldn't expect a
"peace dividend" as some Democrats have
urged, in which military savings can be

diverted directly into domestic programs.
The president is to further outline his
agenda for 1990 in a speech on Friday to the
National Association of Homebuilders in At
lanta.
He also has been staging events to bolster
selected parts of his program — for instance,
Tuesday's unannounced visit with Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp to a public housing de
velopment to push his war on drugs and his
proposal to make it easier for public housing
residents to buy their dwellings.
The president yesterday was spotlighting
his anti-crime program at a luncheon with
law enforcement agencies.
And, he has clearly set the stage for con
frontations with the Democratic-led Congress.
Although he has vowed to repeat the offer
of an extended hand to Congress, made in his
inaugural last year, the president complained
in Orlando about Democratic "demagogues"
who oppose his capital gains cut.
And he told the Chamber of Commerce in
Cincinnati that many of his first-year pro

grams remain "bogged down in the jungles
of Capitol Hill."
Bush also has saluted developments in East
ern Europe, praised U.S. troops who fought
in Panama, talked about the "daybreak of a
new decade" and reveled over "the opportunity
and optimism of a world at peace."
Bush's speeches leading up to the State of
the Union address are largely focusing on
"the issues that remain unfinished in some
cases from last year's legislative session," said
White House communications director David
Demarest.
The president won't have to share the billing
when he delivers that address. But that wasn't
so on Tuesday when he and Kemp dropped
by the public housing development in
Alexandria.
The president sat mostly impassive as Kemp
delivered a long and impassioned exposition
on public housing, the drug problem, commu
nity involvement, the desirability of home
ownership and the civil rights movement.
