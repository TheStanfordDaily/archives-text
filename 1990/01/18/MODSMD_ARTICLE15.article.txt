# U.S. troop withdrawal not linked to drug summit

WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush said yesterday he still
wants the rest of U.S. invasion
troops withdrawn from Panama
"as soon as possible," but he feels
under no pressure to get them
out before next month's drug
summit in Colombia.
Bush, posing for pictures in the
Rose Garden with Gen. Maxwell
Thurman, the commander of U.S.
forces in Panama, congratulated
Thurman and his troops for "the
outstanding job they did for our
country."
Bush said he expects Vice Pres
ident Dan Quayle soon will visit
Panama. He denied that the

United States was having difficul
ties finding countries willing to
host Quayle on a fence-mending
mission to the region.
Peruvian President Alan Gar
cia, perhaps the most outspoken
critic of the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion
that toppled Manuel Antonio Nor
iega, has said he won't attend the
Feb. 15 drug summit unless the
U.S. invasion force is out of
Panama before then. Garcia plans
to send a minister in his stead.
The United States sent nearly
15,000 troops to Panama for the
strike against Noriega and his
Panamanian Defense Forces,
more than doubling the 12,000

troops on permanent duty there
to defend U.S. bases and the
Panama Canal.
"We want them out of there as
soon as possible," Bush said. "It's
my objective to get the troops out
and get back to the levels before
this military action."
But he emphasized, "It has
nothing to do with the summit
in Cartagena at all. This is pru
dent, it is right. ... I'm not driven
by the summit."
"I want to do what's right for
Panama. I want to do what
Panama wants," the president told
reporters.
"It's Panama's show now,"

Bush said before going into a Na
tional Security Council meeting
with Thurman and Defense Sec
retary Dick Cheney to discuss
Panama and its needs.
"We want to give them eco
nomic help. We want to offer hope
to the individuals there who are
out of work, some of it because
of the sanctions we had imposed
on Panama," said Bush. "So we're
committed."
Noriega is jailed in Miami
awaiting trial on drug-trafficking
charges. He surrendered to U.S.
authorities on Jan. 3 after 10 days
in the Vatican Embassy in
Panama City.
