## Where is George?

Thanks, george.
Our self-proclaimed
"Education President" has
approved a deficit reduction bill
that will reduce the budget for
federal student aid by $84.3 mil
lion.
Up to $66.5 million will be cut
from the Pell Grant program alone,
the Chronicle of Higher Education
has reported. Based on those cuts,
165,000 students could lose their
federal aid.
Stanford officials say students
here will not suffer reduced aid
packages because of the cuts. The
University will cover the differ
ence.
But from where will the money
come?
After the full extent of the cuts'
effect on Stanford is known, finan
cial aid officials will request funds
from the general operating budget.
About 700 students currently

receive Pell funding, totaling ap
proximately $900,000.
A fraction of that will likely be
affected â€” an amount that could
be considered peanuts to a Uni
versity with a $350 million oper
ating budget.
But whatever the amount that
needs to be found, it will be
snatched from other programs to
cover the federal aid reductions.
And the last thing the University
needs in this critical budget year
is to have additional expenditures.
Financial aid officials should be
commended for retaining their
commitment to meeting the finan
cial needs of students despite the
federal cuts.
President Bush and the Con
gress, however, should be remem
bered for their willingness to limit
the educational opportunities of
students who are in the most fi
nancial need.
