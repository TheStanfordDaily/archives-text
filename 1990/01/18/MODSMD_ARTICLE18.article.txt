# Fighting the odds
## 
### 
AS AN AMERICAN college
student, the odds are over
155 to 1 that the next
tenured professor you encounter
will not be a black woman.
According to a 1983 survey by
the Equal Employment Opportu
nity Commission, only 14,070 of
the 114,072 tenured professors are
women. Blacks, Latinos, Asian-
American and Native American
faculty combined make up just
seven percent of the total tenured
positions.
The Supreme Court took a step
towards eliminating this travesty
by allowing confidential tenure
records to be released in cases
where there is suspicion of gender
or racial discrimination.
The decision should force tenure
committees, usually made up of

white males, to be sensitive to pos
sible discrimination in the tenure
process. With the knowledge that
these records could be released,
peer reviewers and tenure commit
tees must now be more careful not
to allow sexist or racist stereotypes
to enter into their decisions.
Though some have suggested
that peer evaluations will become
less honest as a result of this de
cision, in fact the tenure process
should be improved. If a professor
chooses to write a scathing review
of another professor's work, he or
she should be willing to stand by
those words.
The Supreme Court made the
right decision. In the future, per
haps the odds of encountering a
tenured black woman will be
greatly improved.
