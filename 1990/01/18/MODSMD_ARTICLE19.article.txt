UCMI report resorts to unclear intellectualizing

I AM WRITING on impulse five
minutes after receiving my copy of
the University Committee on Mi
nority Issues Final Report.
My first impulse was to drop the
report in the first trash can I saw
after picking it up. Does anyone in
volved realize how intimidating and
off-putting eight tabloid pages of fine
print and numbers can be? I know the
issues and the products of the investi
gation are very complex, but some of
the important feelings the University is
trying to address are simple and need
to be approached by some instrument
that is simple.
The report says the following things

to me before I read one word of it:
• If I read it, it is going to take more
time than I can spare.
• Anything so complicated must be
trying to hide something.
• The writers must expect their
readers to be highly educated and
verbally oriented, e.g., they must be
adult, white, male and have some
academic inclination.
• The writers must have spent more
time formatting and number-crunching
than communicating with anyone.
• Most importantly, the report says it is
not interested in having me read it!
When I begin reading the first page
of the report, I find that the subject of

the report seems to be the report, or
possibly the writers of the report. I
find the pronouns "we," "our," ". . .the
committee," etc., all through it. I don't
find the word "you," anywhere on the
first page — and I don't want to read
further because by now I am convinced
that I am not meant to participate in
the adventure of the report in any
capacity whatsoever.
At a minimum, anyone with some
journalistic sense would put the recom
mendations on the first page, after
shortening each of them to one sen
tence.
The document in its tabloid form

doesn't even make a good formal
report — whatever is given to the
Academic Senate, the Trustees, etc., I
hope would it be slicker than this and
easier to read.
I bet that a big reason the Univer
sity is having trouble with minorities
has to do with the hyper-anglo and
pathologically academic form it chooses
for its means of communication.
Hey, as a staff member I want to
know if I am working for a conscious
institution — I already know I am
working for an intelligent one.
