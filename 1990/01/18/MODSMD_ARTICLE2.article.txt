# Planners shift out of park
## Committee begins studying ways to handle campus cars 
### Ari Richter Staff writer 
Should students living on
campus get better parking spaces
than faculty? Should students pay
for 'A' permits if they have the
most convenient parking? Should
the University spend up to $40
million to build more parking
structures?
These are just some of the ques
tions that a University committee
will begin debating tomorrow as
it tries to determine what the
campus' parking needs will be
over the next 10 years.
Regardless of what options are
finally adopted, University
parking costs for the next decade
will be "in the tens of millions,"
according to Tom Auer, a project
manager in the Office of Trans
portation Programs.
And the people who park cars
on campus are going to pay for
it. The price of parking a car on
the Stanford campus is
"guaranteed" to go up, Auer said.
For years, Stanford has had a
parking policy which requires the
University to meet the demand
of all students, faculty and staff
wishing to park on campus. In
addition, accessibility and
moderate prices — compared to
other universities — have accom
panied this availability.
According to Auer, "the free
lunch is running out."
Auer and Transportation Pro
grams managing director Julia
Fremon have compiled an evalu
ation of the University's parking
needs, possible options and cost
estimates. The evaluation found
that by the year 2000, anywhere
from 400 to 1,900 new parking
spaces will be required to fulfill
campus needs.

University parking
costs for the next
decade will be 'in the
tens of millions ...
the free lunch is run
ning out.'

Those findings translate into
hard budget decisions for the Uni
versity Committee on Parking
and Transportation, the group
charged with confronting and
resolving the University's looming
parking problems.
While parking needs are in
creasing, available land is decreas
ing. Left with the need to build
up rather than build out, the Uni
versity may find its most feasible
option in multi-story parking
structures — which, costing
$12,000 a space, are also the most
expensive.
"We need to look at means of
saving money," committee chair
Peter Sidebottom said. As a
result, "the committee will revisit
all parking policies and [ul
timately] recommend new poli
cies" to University President
Donald Kennedy
Auer expects that the process
will culminate in a "parking plan
for the '90s" to be published in
the late spring.
The committee will consider is
sues including how many spaces
should be built and where, who
should get the most convenient
parking, who should pay the high
est prices and what alternative
commuting programs can be de
veloped.
One way in which the Univer

sity may limit its expenditures is
by limiting the demand for spaces
much as other universities do —
by increasing parking costs or
making parking unavailable to
certain groups of people, including
some students.
Such action might also include
an end to what Auer calls a "caste
system." Currently, Auer said,
student residents enjoy the
privilege of receiving top priority
when it comes to the location and
cost of parking spaces.
The existence of such a caste
system was recently illustrated by
the transportation office's re
sponse to the installation of
modulars in the Wilbur Hall
parking lot. Although 270 total
spaces were lost to the modulars,
the remaining 326 were desig
nated for students only About 120
'C' permit spots used by faculty,
staff and commuter students were
sacrificed.
Resident student parking per
mits cost $40 per year, while an
'A' permit for faculty and staff
costs $170. 'C' permits, for faculty
and staff lots located further from
the campus center, cost $40.
Charging students the 'A' rate
because they have the most con
venient parking and having vari
able parking rates based on salary
are other options.
The parking costs at Stanford
are still significantly less than
those at comparable institutions.
At UC-Berkeley, for example, the
parking fee per month is $54.
The University of Southern
California has such a space prob
lem that it is forced to lease 1,500
spaces a day from the nearby Los
Angeles Coliseum.
And at UCLA, student residents
