# Intellectual arena at Stanford lacks pluralism, tolerance
## 
### 
The Stanford community should be
applauded for its efforts to create a
campus which includes students from
many cultural backgrounds. I, person
ally, have been greatly enriched from
my exposure to such a pluralistic envi
ronment.
Sadly, however, this spirit of diver
sity and understanding does not seem
present in the school's intellectual
arena. There appears to be very little
respect for opposing political/social
views.
One recent writer to The Daily, at
tempting to chastise her colleagues for
deriding the opposition, herself referred
to that opposition as "the enemy."
Granted, some beliefs are so
reprehensible that they should be cen
sured (Nazism, Stalinism), but the
ideas that consistently get scorned and

vilified on campus are ones that are
prominent in the mainstream of Ameri
can ideology. Surely we can treat these
opinions with a minimum amount of
contempt.
All of our convictions are formed
from our own unique backgrounds and
experiences. In a pluralistic community
such differences are both inevitable and
enriching, and should be tolerated â€”
especially in an institution of learning.
Stanford remains a great university,
but it won't become a truly enlight
ened one until its members attempt to
embrace intellectual, as well as cul
tural, diversity.
