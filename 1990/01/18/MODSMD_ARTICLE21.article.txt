# Solution to alcohol problems lies in stricter enforcement
## 
### 
We believe the ongoing debate con
cerning a university alcohol policy has

been misdirected. Instead of focusing
on further regulation, University policy
should concentrate on stricter punish
ment and enforcement as a deterrent.
Being a Stanford student is a
privilege that requires both academic
excellence and a certain level of social
responsiblity. Rather than restrict the
rights of a responsible (vast) mfyority,
the University should pursue stronger
punishment of those few who, by their
actions, indicate a disregard for this
privilege.
We recommend that a first offense of
the current alcohol policy be punished
by immediate suspension for the
remainder of the quarter (including
revocation of housing privileges) and
possibly the quarter after.
A second offense should require ex
pulsion. It should be recognized that in
the "real world" the punishment for
actions such as drunk driving or
throwing beer cans in a crowd often
includes jail â€” much harsher than a
suspension.
While this recommendation may ap
pear harsh, it is eminently more fair to
those who are responsible about their

alcohol consumption. To those few who
are not, it is a clear statement that
their actions will not be tolerated.
