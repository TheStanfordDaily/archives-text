## The
						joys of wondering 
### 
DO YOU REMEMBER asking your
parents questions like, "Why is the
sky blue?" or "Why do crickets
make that sound?" Back then, our own
curiosity directly controlled what we
learned. Now, we have books and grad
uation requirements and advisors telling
us what we are supposed to wonder
about.
Even though my parents gave me a lot
of fiction in their answers, I sort of miss
those days of aimless thought. Just last
vacation, I brought it upon myself to
relive the sessions of wondering. Here's
some of the questions that came up.
Does anyone really believe that Stan
ford is in Connecticut, or is it some sort
of communist plot just to bug us?
Who came up with "Drug czar?" Is it
some sort of fad? Are positions like'
"Budget and Finance Wizard" and
"Defense Chieftain" and "Lothar, King
of the Undergraduates" just on the
horizon?
How do graduate students get all those
flannel shirts in just one summer? I
mean, in June, they're undergraduates
wearing T-shirts and shorts, then a few
months later, they've got a plethora of
flannel sportswear.
What's the opposite of a "liberal rag?"
Maybe "conservative linen?"
Do people really believe that the CIV
changes will bring the downfall of the
American mind? Is reading Confucius'
"Analects" instead of some of the parts
of Dante's "Inferno" going to take us
back to the time of the Druids?
Can any security guard at the stadium
say "We're clamping down on alcohol:

only one six-pack of beer per person"
with a straight face?
What does the School of Engineering
do with all the units of work that we do
and never shows up on our transcript?
I'm sort of tired of working like a dog
for four engineering classes, an elective
and fifteen units, while my friend double
majoring in English and history can pack
in 25 units and spend his evenings sitting
at the Coffee House.
Do any of the Palo Alto Times Tribune
kids redly get to go to Disneyland? If
it's all just a trick, I say we form a posse,
go over to the Times Tribune office and
break some skulls. Also, would it be
cheaper for us to just directly send the
kids to Disneyland and save all that
newsprint?
Is there a way to make sure that the
temporary buildings are really tempo
rary? If we equip them with Erik
Estrada's face, butterfly collars large
enough to land a F-l6 on and bell bottoms
that rival Bryant Gumbel's ego, we'll be
sure to have them out in time for the
centennial.
Why do so many people care about
who's in the Council of Presidents?
There's really not that much glamour in
selling used books, going to meetings and
driving people to the airport. Even for
our favorite resume packers, it's a lot
easier to spruce up something else. Fresh
men dorm treasurer could magically be
come Residential Education Specialized
Assistant: Financial Director of Stern
Hall, Larkin House Division. It sounds
a lot better and is a heck of a lot less work.
How much would it cost to hire some

one to pour a jug o' lysol down that
White Plaza drain on a daily basis?
Does the person who sports the Stan
ford tank top, Stanford boxers, Stanford
sweatpants, Stanford sweatshirt, Stan
ford baseball cap and Stanford backpack
in the middle of White Plaza realize that
we all go to Stanford and we all know
that he does too?
Does "Swimwear Illustrated" have an
annual "Sports Edition?"
Wouldn't it make sense that if we have
so many darned cats on campus, we
should have fewer and fewer of those
black birds?
Could we have a computerized system
like Socrates that helps us to find three
unit classes that fulfill distribution re
quirement four and the Non-Western re
quirement, has no final, can be taken
pass/no clue, doesn't meet in the early
morning and is really, really, really easy?
It sure would save a lot of time.
Is a list of questions for a column
instead of an essay a sign that the writer
just couldn't think of anything for this
week. . . . Oh, just be quiet and stop ask
ing stupid questions.
