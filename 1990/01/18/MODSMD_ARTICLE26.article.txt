## 'Eyes' series tells the untold, challenges the nation 
### 
WE ARE TO be tested, you and
I." With those words, Henry
Hampton, the executive pro
ducer of the second series of the televi
sion documentary "Eyes on the Prize,"
defined the challenge that his eight
week series poses to America.
"Eyes on the Prize II: America at
the Racial Crossroads (1965-1984)" will
measure the maturity of our democ
racy by challenging us to confront the
truth about the price we will have to
pay for full equality and justice for
African-American people in America.
Spanning the events of the 1960s
and 19705, "Eyes II" is quite literally
the story of our lives; the untold story
of our lives. Although Stanford is one
of the most prestigious institutions of
higher education in the world, there is
an astounding level of social, cultural
and political illiteracy here. We know
dangerously little about the history
and events that shaped our formative
years.
We are to be tested in terms of our
knowledge. The identification questions
on this test will indicate what we

know about Malcolm X, the Black
Panther Party, the Detroit urban
rebellion, the Attica prison revolt,
busing, the national African-American
political convention in Gary, Indiana,
the Bakke decision and African-
American mayors such as Maynard
Jackson and Harold Washington.
While there has been a lot of talk in
recent years about radicalism and
intimidation, "Eyes II" will show that
today's political activity is actually
quite tame.
In the late 1960s and early 19705,
talk of revolution was in the air.
People did not just take over buildings
for a few hours, they shut down entire
campuses for months.
African-Americans did not just hold
rallies and vigils to protest police
brutality, but rather groups such as
the Black Panthers armed themselves
to protect their people.
The political agenda did not focus on
a capital gains cut, but on the question
of ending poverty for everybody.
As we celebrate Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday on a campus that has

been blessed with the presence of the
King Papers project, how many of us
know the extent of the changes that
King deemed necessary to achieve true
equality?
Most people probably don't know
that King said, "We must ask the
question, 'Why are there 40 million
poor people in America?' When you ask
that question, you begin to question
the capitalistic economy."
Some will be shocked by what they
learn from "Eyes II." Most people
probably don't think that respected
American political leaders ordered
tanks to roll through the streets of our
cities to crush dissent. The media
would have us believe that those kinds
of actions only occur in places like
China.
We are not taught that the highest
levels of the United States government
sanctioned the efforts of America's
secret police to conduct a massive and
well-orchestrated campaign to destroy
the efforts of American citizens
demonstrating for greater freedom and
democracv.

We don't like to think that our
country is capable of exhibiting behav
ior such as jailing people for strictly
political reasons and killing political
leaders with whom the establishment
disagrees, but that is the sad reality.
"Eyes II" will show us this reality,
and then we will be tested. We will be
tested by how we apply our new-found
knowledge to our situation here at
Stanford and in America.
At its essence, the African-American
freedom struggle is a movement for
democracy. Can we make the connec
tions between the movement for de
mocracy in Eastern Europe and similar
efforts in America?
When we salute shipyard worker
Lech Walesa as a hero and inspiring
leader of the working people in Poland,
do we also wish that Alan Wagner and
the other United Stanford Workers
who clean our bathrooms and cook our
food should lead us?
When we see East Germans dancing
on the Berlin Wall and singing "We
Shall Overcome," do we have visions of
African-Americans dancing on the

White House lawn singing the same
song with President Jesse Jackson?
We are to be tested. Watch "Eyes II"
with an open mind. Learn as much as
you can. Hold discussions in your
dorm, re-evaluate your analysis of this
country and the kinds of changes it
needs.
"Eyes II" is your life. How we re
spond to the challenges posed by the
series will determine the content of
"Eyes III." We are living that series
today.
