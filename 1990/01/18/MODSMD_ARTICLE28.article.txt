## Cardinal to host No. 16 Bruins Montgomery looks for big crowd to greet Trevor & Co. 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
In this world of media overkill,
tonight's Stanford-UCLA basketball
game has probably been touted as a
"must-win" contest for both sides. While
that categorization is a bit excessive,
the result will have a great effect on
the rest of the Cardinal's season.
Tipoff in the nationally-televised
ESPN game is at 8:30 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.
Coming off a split in the state of
Washington, Stanford is 10-3 overall,
2-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The
Bruins are tied with Oregon State for
the conference lead at 5-0. UCLA,
ranked 16th in the nation, is 11-2 over
all.
With a win and another victory over
USC Saturday (the Trojans are 1-4 in
league play and have lost seven straight
at Maples), the Cardinal would be up
near the top of the league standings at
4-2. With a loss, however, the Cardinal
will fall below .500 with consecutive
trips to Arizona and Oregon looming in
the next two weeks.
Coming into the homestand, Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery is planning to
make a change in the starting lineup.
Junior Deshon Wingate will start at the
small forward spot, Andrew Vlahov will
start at power forward and Adam Keefe
at center. Derek Bruton, who has started
all 13 games so far this season at center,
will come off the bench tonight.
"I've said all along he's a starter but
I like him off the bench," Montgomery
said of Wingate. "He's given us a lift. . . .
At some point he needs to be rewarded
for working hard. I think he deserves
an opportunity and maybe it will help
our basketball team. Maybe it will help
Derek relax."
Bruton has been outstanding in his
shooting so far, hitting 11 of 13 shots
(.846) in Pac-10 games, but Montgomery
wants him to score and rebound more.
Wingate had perhaps the best game of
his career Sunday, scoring 16 points
and yanking down a career-high 11
boards.

"The more success he's had, the more
confidence he's gotten," Montgomery
said. "Deshon, as I've told him from
Day One, is going to have a big impact
on our winning some games."
Another factor that Montgomery
hopes will play a role in tonight's out
come is the Stanford crowd. The Car
dinal has won 19 of its last 20 games
at Maples and a big part of that success
can be attributed to the crowd. "For us
to win at home consistently, this has to
be a tough place to play," Montgomery
said. "The students have to help. .. .
The Pac-10 is a home-team league."
The statistics bear that out. Last year
the home team went 53-37 in conference
games and the conference's schools were
.691 overall on their own court. Leading
the way were Stanford and Arizona with
perfect home records.
This year the crowds have been some
what disappointing, due in part to sched
uling. The league openers, against
Oregon State and Oregon, did not fill
the gym because they were played before

students returned from winter break.
Despite this, however, 6,623 people
witnessed the OSU game, 72 more than
the combined attendance at Stanford's
two road contests last week. Mont
gomery is hoping that the fact that all
students are back, combined with their
desire to go crazy on nationally televi
sion, will help Stanford upend UCLA.
To do so, the Cardinal will have to
slow the Bruins' forward tandem of
Trevor Wilson and Don Mac Lean. The
senior and the sophomore combine for
38.3 points and 16.9 rebounds per game.
Mac Lean, a 6-foot-10 small forward, is
tough to guard along the baseline,
where he likes to launch his jumper,
and Wilson is a top crunch-time player.
Point guard Darrick Martin is averag
ing 10.2 points per game and off guard
Gerald Madkins is scoring 7.5 per game
after redshirting last season. He broke
his pelvis in a moped accident but has
returned to top form. The Bruins also

have the top freshman class in
the league as Tracy Murray,
Mitchell Butler and Zan Mason
have all contributed this year.
Mac Lean had a double-double
Saturday to lead UCLA past Ar
izona in Pauley Pavilion to allow
the Bruins to keep pace with
Oregon State.
In addition to the new lineup,
Montgomery is hoping a little
change in the gameplan will help.
Specifically, he is planning to fast
break more than in previous
games and feels that running can
help the team win more games.
"We have to get more points off
the fast break," he said. "On every
missed shot or turnover we try
to run the break. Sometimes we
don't rebound the ball. Sometimes

we don't make the outlet pass.
Sometimes a guy is not where
he's supposed to be. . . . We made
a lot of mistakes running the
break (against WSU). But we
can't learn anything until we try
to do it (in a game)."
Card notes
Like, dude, all three of UCLA's
starting front-line players are from
the San Fernando Valley and the sur
rounding area, you know. Wilson is
out of Sherman Oaks, Mac Lean hails
from Sixni Valley and center Keith
Owens is from Encino. Like, no way.
In the Pac-10 standings, UCLA and
OSU are 5-0, Arizona 5-2, California
3-2, Stanford 2-2, Oregon 2-3, Wash
ington 2-4, Arizona 2-5, USC 1-4 and
WSU 1-5.
UCLA and USC play both Bay Area
schools this weekend and the Wash
ington schools visit the Oregon
schools. Arizona beat ASU 70-61 in
Tempe last night.
