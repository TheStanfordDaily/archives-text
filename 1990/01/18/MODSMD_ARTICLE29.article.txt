# Men's Basketball vs. UCLA
## 
### 
TONIGHT — Live on ESPN with a 8:30 p.m. tipoff in Maples Pavilion. KZSU (90.1 FM)
and KCBS (740 AM) will also broadcast the game.
RECORDS — Stanford (10-3, 2-2 in Pac-10 play, ranked 44th nationally with two votes
in the AP poll), UCLA (11-2, 5-0, ranked No. 16).
SERIES — The Bruins lead the overall series 109-70, but Stanford won two of the three
meetings last year.
BRUIN UPDATE —The Bruins come into the game tied with Oregon State for the
conference lead at 5-0. They are led by their forward combo of Trevor Wilson and
Don Mac Lean. Wilson is averaging 18.9 points and 9.4 rebounds, while Mac Lean is
at 19 4 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. Point guard Darrick Martin is also in
double figures and freshman Tracy Murray has been a scoring machine off the bench.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Adam Keefe continues to be a one-man wrecking crew for the
Cardinal after scoring 30 points and pulling down 15 rebounds at Washington State
Sunday. The Cardinal's front line shot 67 percent (20 for 30) from the field in that
game. Stanford's biggest problems so far have been a lack of consistent outside
shooters and silly turnovers on the offensive end.
KEYS TO VICTORY — The Cardinal had a great deal of difficulty defending the outside
shot earlier in the season. Against the Cougars, however, Stanford players did a good
job of getting a hand in the face of nearly every shooter, holding WSU below 30-percent
shooting. Stanford will have to do the same tonight as Martin, Murray and Mac Lean
love to shoot jumpers. The Cardinal can also take advantage of UCLA's lack of depth
at point guard. Martin is very good, but when he's on the bench Gerald Madkins
runs the show. A shooting guard by trade, he could be a target for several pick-pocket
attempts by Cardinal guards.
