# Stanford-educated teachers say they chose the right path

The coffee mug on graduate
student Jennifer Abrams' desk
reads, "Those who can, teach.
Those who can't, go into another
less significant line of work."
Following this advice, Abrams
has decided to become a teacher
and is one of several graduate stu
dents in the Stanford Teacher Ed
ucation Program who are setting
aside their financial ambitions
and using their college degree to
make a difference in the world of
education.
"Maybe not every day and not
in every class, but somewhere
along the way you do make a dif

ference," said Storm Russell, a
1989 graduate of STEP. As a first
year teacher in a Bay Area high
school, Russell said it is the "rare
stroke" when a student responds
positively to him that makes
teaching worthwhile.
Each year, the renowned STEP
program, offered through the
School of Education, provides its
graduate students with education

classes and student teaching in
ternships in local schools for the
academic year. In addition, many
other students participate in tu
toring and education classes on
campus.
However, despite the recent
shortage of talented teachers and
an increase in publicity about the
wide variety of opportunities in
the field, many education schools
have had problems attracting stu
dents from top universities. Stu
dents must face the "financial
reality" of the profession, said ed
ucation graduate student Pat
McDonough, co-director of this
weekend's You Can Make a Dif
ference conference.
"Students from colleges like

Stanford are the ones with the
greatest loan debt after gradua
tion and are therefore unlikely to
enter the teaching profession
where they make less money per
year than they paid to go to college
each year," McDonough said.
Despite the financial draw
backs, many Stanford students
and graduates have decided to
make teaching their career.
"As a computer science major,
1 knew that I could go into that
and make big bucks, or I could
go into education and make very
little," said Jamila Rufaro, a grad
uate student in education and di
rector of Stanford's under
graduate program in the School
of Education. "But you just don't

go into teaching for the money,"
she said.
"There are other rewards to
teaching than the financial," Rus
sell said. "The bottom line is that
we care about our students and
we are there to make a difference
in their lives."
The lest> tangible rewards of
teaching are often the "little
things," said Jennifer Abrams, a
STEP graduate student who
teaches high school English. "It's
great when I get 'my kids' to get
the best out of themselves," she
said.
"One person can really make a
difference in a student's life,"
Rufaro said. "It's a good feeling."
But these moments of fulfill

ment are often countered by frus
tration as young teachers realize
that the profession is not always
accompanied by immediate
rewards. "First-year teachers ex
perience a really difficult year,"
said John Charles, a 1989 STEP
graduate who is teaching in a Bay
Area high school.
"I hope students are benefitting
in ways I'm not seeing, although
I often feel like I'm floundering,"
Charles said.
Another 1989 STEP graduate,
Stephanie Smith, agreed. "I some
times wonder why I'm teaching,
but then I remember that I'm
doing something worthwhile."
