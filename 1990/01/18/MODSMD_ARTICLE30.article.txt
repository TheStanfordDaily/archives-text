# Shortening of season good for basketball, hoopsters, Podunk St.
## 
### 
Hearts were breaking all across
America last week, as the NCAA
decided to cut the basketball
season by three games, down to a max
imum of 25 contests per team.
Do you realize what this means? Of
course, the ramifications are staggering.
No, I'm not talking about shorter seasons
or more class time for athletes or less
money for athletic programs. These are
all potential results of the new regula
tions, but their importance is minimal
when you think about just what this rule
really means:
No more games between Syracuse and
the Marathon Oil AAU team.
I know, it's gonna be hard to take. I'm
sure most of you spent this past offseason

just waiting for that glorious night in
December when the Orangemen met the
Oilmen ("Whaddya mean it's not on
ESPN?!!"). I was home at the time, and
boy, I seriously contemplated making the
seven-hour drive up to Syracuse for this
potential cliffhanger. But then, hey, I'm

sure all 32,000 seats were sold out any
way.
Syracuse won't get the chance to clean
up the Slicks after the 1991-92 season,
because that's when the cuts go into ef
fect. (Games against AAU teams are ac
tually exhibitions, which are also effec
tively nuked by the new rules.) The mea
sure (which includes moving the start of
fall practice from Oct. 15 to Nov. 1) was
approved, amid screams of protest from
money-conscious athletic directors, at
last week's NCAA Convention. The up
shot of it is that schools are going to
have to decide which three games they
can afford to live without.
This ought to be really tough for
Syracuse, whose early season schedule

was an advertisement for Basketball
Wimps of America: Rutgers, Cornell, Vir
ginia Commonwealth, Marathon Oil,
Towson State, C. W! Post and Lafayette
have all made the sacrificial pilgrimage
to the Carrier Dome since the start of
the season. Lots of Final Four potential
in that group.
Oh yeah, the Orangemen did actually
have two non-league road games in De
cember. One was at Canisius. Yeesh.
The other was against Duke in the
ACC-Big East Challenge, after which
Coach Jim Boeheim complained about
having to play a good team in December.
Yeah, it must be terrible to have to play
teams that actually have a chance of
beatingyou. Like, say, Villanova and Con

necticut.
Of course, Syracuse is far from the
only school that diets on cream
puffs. Take Georgetown's early
schedule: Wins over Hawaii-Loa and
Hawaii-Pacific (NAIA powerhouses in
their own right, I'm sure), a 114-67
thumping of Florida International, a 20-
point drowning of Rice, 40-point
squeakers against St. Leo and Northern
lowa and, needless to say, the obligatory
112-39 (yes, one hundred twelve to thirty
nine!) win over the University of the
District of Columbia.
The Hoyas were also forced to play in
the ACC-Big East Challenge, against


Cameron
Macky
North Carolina, and as Coach
John Thompson graciously put it
after his team's win, "We can't
learn anything from this type of
game." Well, that makes sense.
Georgetown probably learned all
there is to learn against the Dis
trict of Columbia.
It's fairly obvious that the world
of basketball — especially the
players — can live without a few
of these games. The problem is
that athletic directors don't want
to live without the money fans
are willing to pay to watch their
favorite team mangle Podunk
State. (Syracuse could reportedly
lose as much as $1.5 million bv

having three fewer home games.)
In fact, according to the Asso
ciated Press, some athletic direc
tors felt that the potential loss of
revenue from game cutbacks was
"too much ... for the NCAA to
sacrifice for library-time for ath
letes."
What? Sacrifice money for the
good of the players? Gee, how hor
rendous.
So, where do schools cut?
Well, Georgetown played one
game at Northern lowa and
two in Hawaii back in the early
part of the season, so it won't
have to reduce the number of
home games it plays to comply.
Don't bet on the Hoyas playing
any more Podunk road games
when the cut goes into effect,

though.
Syracuse will have to slash at
least two home games — and lose
all that money. Darn.
The smaller schools will have
to get rid of the powerhouse
games on their schedule, which
probably won't bother them at
all. (Then again, maybe U.D.C.
wants to keep playing Georgetown
to see if they can stay within 50
one of these years.) All in all,
fewer games and two less weeks
of practice is good for the players,
and fewer joke games is good for
basketball. The only people com
plaining are athletic directors —
and that alone makes the idea
seem like a great one already.

which opened its Podunk schedule
last season by losing to Siena•
