# Shortening of season good for basketball, hoopsters, Podunk St.

Hearts were breaking all across
America last week, as the NCAA
decided to cut the basketball
season by three games, down to a max
imum of 25 contests per team.
Do you realize what this means? Of
course, the ramifications are staggering.
No, I'm not talking about shorter seasons
or more class time for athletes or less
money for athletic programs. These are
all potential results of the new regula
tions, but their importance is minimal
when you think about just what this rule
really means:
No more games between Syracuse and
the Marathon Oil AAU team.
I know, it's gonna be hard to take. I'm
sure most of you spent this past offseason

just waiting for that glorious night in
December when the Orangemen met the
Oilmen ("Whaddya mean it's not on
ESPN?!!"). I was home at the time, and
boy, I seriously contemplated making the
seven-hour drive up to Syracuse for this
potential cliffhanger. But then, hey, I'm

sure all 32,000 seats were sold out any
way.
Syracuse won't get the chance to clean
up the Slicks after the 1991-92 season,
because that's when the cuts go into ef
fect. (Games against AAU teams are ac
tually exhibitions, which are also effec
tively nuked by the new rules.) The mea
sure (which includes moving the start of
fall practice from Oct. 15 to Nov. 1) was
approved, amid screams of protest from
money-conscious athletic directors, at
last week's NCAA Convention. The up
shot of it is that schools are going to
have to decide which three games they
can afford to live without.
This ought to be really tough for
Syracuse, whose early season schedule

was an advertisement for Basketball
Wimps of America: Rutgers, Cornell, Vir
ginia Commonwealth, Marathon Oil,
Towson State, C. W! Post and Lafayette
have all made the sacrificial pilgrimage
to the Carrier Dome since the start of
the season. Lots of Final Four potential
in that group.
Oh yeah, the Orangemen did actually
have two non-league road games in De
cember. One was at Canisius. Yeesh.
The other was against Duke in the
ACC-Big East Challenge, after which
Coach Jim Boeheim complained about
having to play a good team in December.
Yeah, it must be terrible to have to play
teams that actually have a chance of
beatingyou. Like, say, Villanova and Con

necticut.
Of course, Syracuse is far from the
only school that diets on cream
puffs. Take Georgetown's early
schedule: Wins over Hawaii-Loa and
Hawaii-Pacific (NAIA powerhouses in
their own right, I'm sure), a 114-67
thumping of Florida International, a 20-
point drowning of Rice, 40-point
squeakers against St. Leo and Northern
lowa and, needless to say, the obligatory
112-39 (yes, one hundred twelve to thirty
nine!) win over the University of the
District of Columbia.
The Hoyas were also forced to play in
the ACC-Big East Challenge, against
