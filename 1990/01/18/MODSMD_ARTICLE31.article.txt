# Trip south traditionally tough
## But after '89 sweep, Cardinal learning to love City of Angels 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Entering the 1985-86 season,
the Stanford women's basketball
team had a reputation — for
losing.
The squad was coming off a
9-19 season which was preceded
by a 5-23 year. Yet, there was
hope. A new coach named Tara
VanDerveer was hired away from
Ohio State where she had led her
team to three straight NCAA
Tournament appearances.
She would pilot the team to 13
wins that season. But none of
them came in Los Angeles.
The team headed down the
coast in February to meet USC
and UCLA. The Trojans were led
by Cheryl Miller who many regard
as the finest women's basketball
player of all time.
Miller was in her senior year
and was slated to have her num
ber retired the night the Cardinal
came to town. She didn't disap
point the hometown fans who
came for the ceremony. In a
vintage performance, Miller
scored 36 points while pulling
down 22 rebounds to key the 88-
62 USC victory. She also had five
steals.
"You're not going to stop her,"
VanDerveer said. "I asked
Howard Wright (then a freshman
on the men's team) at breakfast
if he'd suit up for us, but he said
. . . he didn't want to play against
Cheryl."
Three nights later, the women
came headed into Pauley Pavilion
to take on the Bruins. They didn't
fare much better. Down only two
at halftime, Stanford was out
scored 39-19 in the second half
and fell 65-43.
"We should have left at hal
fime," VanDerveer remarked
after the game.
The team finished the season

at 13-15 and entered the '86-87
campaign with a sense of enthu
siasm. Some of that excitement
carried over to the L.A. trip in
early February.
Facing a Cheryl Miller-less
USC, Stanford cut an early deficit
to seven points at 63-56 with 4:36
left in the game. The Cardinal
would only score one point the
rest of the way.
USC scored 16 and ended up
routing Stanford 79-57. "They
went on an absolute rampage,"
VanDerveer said. "All of the sud
den they were running faster,
jumping higher and shooting
better."
Again, the Cardinal tried to re
bound for the UCLA game. This
time they even tied the Bruins at
halftime 25-25. Unfortunately,
the second half unfolded much as
it did the previous year and Stan
ford went on a 64-48 defeat.
They were a bit closer each time
and even finished the year at .500,
but the Stanford women knew

they weren't there yet.
Turn the clock ahead to March
1988. Stanford is again bound for
the land of glitz and glimmer. This
time, though, something very dif
ferent is afoot.
The Cardinal, yes the Stanford
Cardinal, is 25-1 and leading the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 13-1
league mark. The Associated
Press has them ranked eighth in
the country.
Finally, they will win in Los
Angeles!
No.
This time UCLA came first.
The unranked Bruins scored the
game's first two points and never
trailed as they bested Stanford
74-64. USC would be less kind.
Cheryl Miller may have been
nothing but a bad memory for
Stanford, but on that night Cherie
Nelson would become the team's
worst nightmare.
Nelson had 20 points and 10

rebounds in the first half. She
finished the game with 41 points
on 15-of-23 shooting and the
Trojans were big winners again,
87-69.
Stacy Parson, then a Cardinal
sophomore and a native of nearby
Sylmar, scored a career-high 16
points that night. Said Parson:
"The L.A. schools are always a
big game, so you always get up
for that."
It may have gotten up but still
couldn't get a win. Yet, the team
ended the year an impressive 27-5
and earned its first NCAA berth
since 1981-82.

It is just over a year ago, the
Cardinal then traveled south to
USC. But this time, they don't
"go south." With Nelson
suspended for disciplinary
reasons, USC heads into the
matchup with Stanford minus its
leading scorer and rebounder.
At halftime the Trojans are still
in it but are trailing 33-25. In the
second stanza, it is Stanford, fi
nally, that puts together a
blowout. Outscoring USC 56-25,
the Cardinal women pick up an
89-50 victory.
A win! That's right, a win!
But can they sweep? The Bruins
took both games from Stanford
the previous year and promised
to be tough. With just under two
minutes to play, Stanford held a
64-63 lead.

Jennifer Azzi, who would later
be named an All-American, let fly
a three-pointer. She hits nothing
but net. "That was a big basket,"
VanDerveer said.
UCLA could manage no better
than a trade of baskets and free
throws for much of the remainder.
The Bruins didn't quit, but they
did lose, 73-71.
At last, Stanford brought its
brooms to Tinseltown and came
home with a sweep. The squad
ended the year 28-3 and one win
short of the Final Four.
This season the Cardinal is bid
ding for an NCAA championship
and perhaps even an unblemished
record. Again USC and UCLA
stand in the way. It's just that
this time they appear as much
smaller obstacles.
