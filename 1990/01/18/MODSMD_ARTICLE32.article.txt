TONIGHT — 7:30 p.m. tipoff in Pauley Pavilion.
RECORDS — Stanford (13-0, 4-0 in Pac-10 play, ranked No. 2 in the
nation), UCLA (8-5, 3-0).
SERIES — The Bruins lead the overall series 16-3 and is 7-1 in home
games The Cardinal's lone win down south was a 73-71 triumph last
season.

who is averaging 19.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per game. Sandra
VanEmbricqs is chipping in 11 4 points and 10.2 rebounds
CARDINAL UPDATE — Julie Zellstra was named Pac-10 Player of the Week
after scoring 43 points in a sweep of the Washington schools last
weekend She shot .714 from the field. Zeilstra's 27 points in the Wash
ington State game is a career high. Jennifer Azzi is shooting 936 from
the free throw line. She has converted on all 18 attempts in conference
Pjay.
KEYS TO VICTORY — VanEmbricqs is the conference's second-best re
bounder and the Cardinal's weakness — if it has one - is rebounding
The Bruins will have a chance if they control the boards Katy Stedlng
and Val Whiting have done an impressive job cleaning the glass lately
though. If Stanford continues to play like it has been, the Cardinal should
come up with a second straight win at UCLA,
