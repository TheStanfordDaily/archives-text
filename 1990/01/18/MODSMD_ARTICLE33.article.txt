# Canadians swamp lax men swimmers
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
If you were searching for an
intense, high-pressure swimming
meet yesterday, deGuerre Pool
was the wrong place to look.
On its way to the Common
wealth Games in Australia, the
Canadian national team made a
brief stop at Stanford and paddled
away from the Cardinal swim
mers who found enough free time
between morning and afternoon
classes to show up at the pool.
"The meet was pretty low-key
for us," senior Rick Gould said.
"After missing some days for the
Michigan meet, classes took prec
edent over showing up at the
meet."
Consequently, the Canadian
team, composed of the top-two or
three swimmers in each event
from our North American neigh
bor, found themselves facing Car
dinal swimmers who, while
swimming in off-events, could
only stay around for part of the
meet. The Canadians, who had
been resting in order to prepare
for their big shaved and tapered
meet, easily swam ahead of the
Cardinal opponents.
"They basically dominated us,"

Gould said. "We were really
rushed, and it just wasn't optimal
for fast swims. We did have the
opportunity to practice in a com
petitive atmosphere, though."
The Canadians so dominated
the meet that the Cardinal was
unable to win any of the 11 events.
In fact, the Canadians finished
1-2 in five of the nine individual
events. In the 200 breaststroke,
the Canadians swept the first
three spots.
Stanford has now reached a
transition point in the season.
After completing the difficult,
build-up Christmas training peri
od, the Cardinal will now enter a
period of focusing on strokes,
speed pacing, turns, and stream
lining starts, among other things.
As the conference dual meets and
the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships approach, the swim
mers will begin to perfect their
individual events in preparation
for NCAAs.
"We will probably be swimming
some off-events against Davis,"
Gould said. "But then we have
big meets against the Arizona
schools and the L*A. weekend. We
will be keying for NCAAs."
Stanford swimmers will dive
again into deGuerre Pool against
UC-Davis Friday at 1 p.m.
