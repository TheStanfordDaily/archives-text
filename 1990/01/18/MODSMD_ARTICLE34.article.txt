dominated the San Francisco
State Gators 36-8 last night in
a dual meet at Burnham Pavil
ion, improving its record to 6-2.

was that the team might lack
intensity.

"When you are expected to
beat a team, there is a tendency
to let up a bit," Horpel said. "I
warned people about this, and I
think they responded pretty well
by wrestling with a lot of inten
sity."
The opening match set the
tone for the evening as the Car
dinal's Dave Nowick defeated
Cheong Eng of SFSU early in
the second period by a technical
fa 11,17-2.
Nowick approached the match
as a chance to improve his skills.
"I wanted to make my moves as
solid as possible and work on
some new stuff," he said.
The most exciting contest of
the evening occurred in the 126-
pound weight class as Cardinal
Josh Lisle took on the Gators'
All-American Rick Goodwin.
Goodwin scored a take down in
the last 10 seconds of the match
to win a 5-3 decision.
Lisle started the match con
servatively against Goodwin. His
confidence grew in the second
period. Lisle said, "As the match

progressed, I opened up." In the
critical closing seconds of the
third period, Lisle had to take
a risk. "ThV last 30 seconds I
had to try to take him down or
get him called for stalling." The
risk resulted" in Goodwin's criti
cal take down.
Coach Horpel was impressed
with the effort of Dave Sacks
(134 lbs.) against SFSU's Robert
Ynzunza. Horpel said, "He
(Ynzunza) was getting Sacks
called for stalling. A lot of times,
an inexperienced wrestler will

get bothered by that. So I was
pleased to see that he main
tained his composure and ended
up dominating."
Another impressive Cardinal
victory was posted by Matt Top
ham who wore out the Gators'
Dan Rutschke with an 18-3
third-period technical fall. The
other Cardinal victors were
James Dinette (142 lbs.), Geoff
Baum (150 lbs.), and Mark
Graham (167 lbs.).
Steve Buddie (177 lbs.) and
Ron Perry (190 lbs.) were

awarded wins via forfeit.
The only other Stanford
defeat came in the heavyweight
division. San Francisco State's
bulky Matt Blevin used his enor
mous weight advantage to win
an 18-3 technical fall over the
Cardinal's Trent Smith.
Stanford will travel to a dual
meet against Humboldt State
Saturday. Dave No wick put it
best when he said that he wants
to see the Cardinal "get better
and better everyday."
