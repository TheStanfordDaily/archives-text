There are those who say that
college basketball is the most ex
citing spectator sport in the world.
These intrepid fans would have
been extremely delighted with this
week's first-round games of a spe
cial type of college basketball â€”
intramurals.
The intramural basketball
season is already in full swing,
with games having begun Monday
night. In women's action Tuesday
night, CSD trounced West Lag by
a score of 45-8. The Computer
Science Department scored the
first 21 points of the game, over
powering the West Lagunita team.
Good team defense, strong
rebounding and a torrid shooting
percentage in the first half led
CSD to a 25-4 halftime lead.
Jen Hill led CSD's first half at
tack by pouring in 11 points,
finishing the game with 13 points.
Leslie Lorimer and Monica Rua
both contributed strongly to the
balanced CSD offense, scoring 10
points apiece.
In other women's games, the
Women's Soccer Team showed
athletic versatility by coming from
behind to beat Slimers, 26-22.
Slimers, composed largely of the

women's field hockey team,
seemed solidly in control in the
first half as they jumped out to
a 16-7 halftime lead. But Soccer
came on strong in the second half,
led by the scoring of guard Julie
Foudy and the impressive ball
handling of guard Tonya Antonuc
ci.
Foudy led all scorers with 17
points, scoring 13 of those points
during Soccer's second half come
back. Soccer tied the game at 22-
22 on a Foudy lay-up off an
Antonucci pass with under two
minutes remaining in the game.
Foudy then put Soccer ahead for
good, 24- 22, with a driving lay-up
with 45 seconds left in the game.
In B-league men's action Tues
day night, the Ultimate Frisbee
team crushed the Sigma Alpha
Mu fraternity 50-14. Ultimate
rode a solid defensive performance
and John Knoll's eight first-half
points to take a 16-5 halftime lead.
Neither team was shooting well
in the first half, but Ultimate's
height advantage led to a huge
rebounding advantage and nu
merous second-chance points.
Ultimate then exploded with a
16-2 run, giving it a second-half
lead of 32-7. Rick Olesik, affec
tionately dubbed "The Black

Hole" by one referee, led all
scorers with 16 points. "It was
just one of those nights where
everything went in," Olesik said.
"We've got a long way to go,'
said Dan Grable of Biz 2A after
its 36-18 win over No Name Yet
in a Tuesday B-league game.
Grable led Biz 2A in scoring and
rebounding with 10 points and
eight rebounds. In a game plagued
with turnovers and missed shots,
Biz 2A was able to convert more
effectively on No Name Yet's
miscues.
Jeff Soesbe of No Name Yet
dumbfounded players, fans and
referees by nailing three bank
shots from outside 20 feet in the
last two minutes of the game.
"Apparently we should have let
him shoot more often," said one
of Soesbe's teammates.
