# Wagner wins Daily election
## 
### F. Scott Poohbear Editorial staff 
John Martin Wagner Jr. can
have his cake and eat it too.
Yesterday, Mr. Wagner cele
brated his 21st birthday with a
cake from his mother and a vic
tory in the election for editor in
chief of volume 197 of The Stan
ford Daily.
Mr. Wagner is a junior majoring
in sociology though, like many
Daily staffers, he has not been to
class recently. In fact, now that
he has been elected editor in chief,
he is planning to stop out.
The first thing that Mr. Wagner
did after his victory was an
nounced (and he hugged his op
ponent in the spirit of good sports
manship) was call his mother and
father.
Mr. Wagner said he recognized
his mother's voice when she
picked up the phone and ex
claimed, "I won." His mother said,
"Oh, good." Then, the conversa
tion ended.
At the time of this interview,
Mr. Wagner had not yet informed
his only sibling Monica, a sopho
more at Duke University, of his
victory.
Monica holds a special place in
the new "grand poobah's" heart
because, when he was eight years
old and she was seven, he began
his illustrious newspaper career
by producing a small neighbor
hood newspaper with her.
At this emotional time, Mr.
Wagner's thoughts also raced to
another loved one — his Siberian
husky, Zachary. The top dog
resides in St. Louis with Mr. Wag
ner's parents.
Mr. Wagner explained his close
relationship with Zachary in this
way: "We are best buds. I potty
trained him and now we have a
very close bond."
In the middle of this emotional
post-election interview, Mr. Wag
ner, who is of half-American, half-
Canadian stock, exclaimed, "I
won; that means I didn't lose"
and the reality of the burdens he
is about to take on sunk in.
Mr. Wagner said he spent a
quiet day waiting for the election

results to roll in.
"I did my laundry for the first
time in quite a while," Mr. Wagner
said. "It is all right to wear some
thing three or four times without
washing it, but by the fifth time,
it is a 'no go.' "
Despite the fact that Mr. Wag
ner wore a "power red" tie at the
grill session yesterday, he said it
is not a sign of a shift in his
fashion sense.
He added that the tie was only
a sign that he has sold out to
corporate America by accepting a
summer internship with the Wall
Street Journal's Philadelphia
bureau.
The editor in chief-elect went

bowling last night to celebrate his
victory.
"This could be a high score
night," he proclaimed beforehand,
holding high the computer prin
tout of the 222 that he bowled
sometime last quarter as proof of
his bowling skill.
Mr. Wagner served as managing
editor of Volume 196 and, since
the position is similar to the vice
presidency, it is not strange that
he looks to Dan Quayle as his
political role model.
The difference, of course, is that
now Wagner is in power and, if
there is a God, Dan Quayle never
will be.

John Wagner celebrated his election as the next editor of The Daily
with a tried and true American concoction — Coca-Cola. He es
chewed the traditional imbibing of alcoholic beverages as a show
of support for proposed changes in the University's alcohol policy.
