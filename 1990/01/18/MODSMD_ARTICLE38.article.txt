# INTERMISSION
## Cross-country skiing heats up the coldest winter weekends

THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING W

Except once. We stopped to read a direction sign
at a fork in the trail and began discussing how much
noise we thought was necessary to alert the trigger
happy trees. Such was the conversation:
I proposed, "I think a tree only dumps on you
after you pass by it, don't you thAAAAG
GGGGGHHHHHH!!!"
Obviously, I had found my answer.
On both days when I returned to our house, I
looked pretty haggard. Still, that did not shield me
from abuse from my counterparts who risked life
and limb at the downhill slopes of Squaw Valley and
Alpine Meadows.
"Ehhh, cross-country skiing is for wimps," some
ribbed. "Why don't you just go hiking?" others would
inquire.
Yes, perhaps cross-country skiing is for the less
daring, the less ambitious, or more likely, the less
suicidal. But I was heartily satisfied.
And for those of us moving on in our years (I am
a junior after all) the cross-country skiing life suits
me just fine. In my first two years at Stanford, I
partook in the madcap world of downhill, and I did
survive. But now, I've gradually eased into the con
templative life, the world of gentle ups and downs,
of snowball-chucking trees and quiet woods. Cross

"Look everybody, I'm cross-country skiing!" I
beamed happily as I clicked on my newly-rented
Fischer Crowns and floundered by the side of the
street.
"Look everybody, Jason can't move!" somebody
yelled, and six people began pelting me with balls
of the packable white stuff.
Such was my inauspicious introduction to cross
country skiing.
To some, cross-country skiing is a thrilling way
to traverse the frozen tundra, to others, it is just a
wimpy way of walking on snow. Last weekend, how
ever, the winter wonderland otherwise known as Lake
Tahoe afforded me a sometimes harrowing, often
exhilarating and thoroughly enjoyable introduction
to the winter sport.
I plunged feet first into the proverbial fire during
Lesson One. The first thing my seasoned veteran
instructor Alex said was, "Give me your poles."
"He's crazy," I thought, "My poles are the only
thing between me and permanent union with the
snow." Yet eager to become one with the fiberglass
planks beneath my feet, 1 offered up my crutches.
"Do you know how to ice skate?" he next asked.
"Yes," I lied. I'm really a terrible ice skater.
"Cross-country skiing is a lot like ice skating,"
Alex continued.
I sensed trouble. To me, ice is something you
sprinkle salt on, and snow is something you remove
from pavement many times a year.
But I learned, and it wasn't that hard. All you do
is push backward on one foot while leaning all your
weight on it. Because special grooves on the bottom
prohibit the ski from moving backward, you can't
help but glide forward with the other ski. Shift your
weight to one foot, push backward on it, and away
you go. Simple, eh?
It was all fun and games until we got to a a black
diamond trail called Lakeview, which supposedly af
forded a spectacular view of Lake Tahoe and the
surrounding area. Breathtaking view notwithstanding,
I translate all black diamond skiing symbols to mean,
"lason, go away."
My companions, however, were enthusiastic â€”
despite their novice status. I'm not surprised. One
used to ride with the cycling team and the other is
on the women's crew team. Obviously, they revel in
physical punishment.
We herring-boned up Lakeview's relatively steep
slopes, dodging holes and negotiating slippery ice
passages. And the expedition was truly worth the
struggle. Lake Tahoe and the surrounding mountains,
endless forests and foreboding clouds merged into
an absolutely breathtaking panorama. The lake,
mountains, clouds and even the snow that covered
the pine trees melted the intense greens into subdued
grays.
While our odyssey to the top was not that bad, I
suffered extreme difficulties on the return trip, which
was both an expedition and a study in falling down.
I had learned the snow plow stop and all that stuff
two winters ago at Squaw Valley, but all those tech
niques become irrelevant when you're wearing skis
the length of Palm Drive.
In order to stop in rough spots, I resorted to the
primitive, yet effective, methods of Early Skier Man
to slow my plunge to doom. It was a wet regression
from my normally upright posture. Suffice it to say,
returning down the hill took more time than trekking
up it. Such can be the case with cross-country skiing.
Fortunately on the more peaceful and gentle slopes
that cross-country skiing affords those who enjoy
waxing poetic have ample time to think.
On the Second Day, Old Man Winter raged hard,
filling up the tracks, covering signs and causing skis
to stick to the newly fallen white stuff.
Worst, though, were the trees. They were out to
get me. The snow piled up heavily on the boughs
of the pines that hung over the trail. Sound waves
from the swooshing of skis were often enough to
cause the pines' hands to overturn and send a shower
of snow over unwary travelers. Fortunately, our ar
boreal nemesis were usually too slow on the draw
to catch me and my ski partner in their freezing
deluge.

country skiing is definitely just for us adults.
