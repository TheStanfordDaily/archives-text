backpacking in Hoboken, New Jersey.
THE ANDREW BERKOWITZ DIARIES
October 14. 1987
While bicycling in the park this morning
I realized suddenly that today is the first
day of the rest of my life. It reminded me
of what my grandfather used to say: "The
journey of a thousand miles begins with
a single step, although it's much faster to
fly." Spinoza wrote that life on earth is
but a preparation for life after death. If
this is true, then why can I not major in
Life After Death, or at the very least take
a Stanley H. Kaplan course to prepare?
Questions such as these plague me.
November 14, 1987
Today I met the woman 1 one day hope
to marry. She is beautiful, with skin that
is smooth as silk and a voice that sounds

like the songs of the gods. Problem: I am
afraid that if I ask her out on a date she
will insist on going to McLizard's and
ordering a Big Newt with Cheese. Should
I tell her my religion prohibits the eating
of lizards, or should I renounce my faith
and fear the wrath of my father? It was
he, after all, who served gila monster at
my Bar Mitzvah. Wasn't it Hume who
denied the possibility of genuinely valid
knowledge? He must have been the one
who crossed out all the verbs in my physics
textbook and replaced them with Folger's
crystals.
January 3, 1988
I thought I had proven the existence of
God today while scribbling proofs on a
fuece of notebook paper. It wasn't until
ater that I realized I had gotten the math
wrong and had proven the existence of
the Zamboni ice resurfacer. When Locke

refuted the divine right of kings was he
referring to the Los Angeles Kings? This
fits with the Zamboni proof, but makes
little sense in the context of 17th-century
England. I fear Stonehenge was built by
Wayne Gretzky and a defenseman named
Pierre.
June 6. 1988
Idea for a Broadway musical: Wistful
music plays as the curtain opens to reveal
a man running to catch the bus. When
he reaches the bus stop he suddenly
realizes that all the other people in his
city have been transformed into gourds.
In the second act, his co-workers (played
by gourds) throw him a birthday party
although it is not his birthday, and later
throw him into a pit filled with rats and
people named "Ralph." I think this would
work either as a musical or perhaps as
an epic poem inscribed on Brie cheese.
Camus said that life is absurd; I suspect
his first name was "Ralph."
July 20. 1989
Looking up at the stars this evening I
wondered whether man is but a miniscule,
insignificant part of the universe, or if he
is, in fact, the ultimate end product of all
evolution What about woman? She seems
far more useful in the whole scheme of
things, especially since she has better

handwriting. If man is the ultimate end
product of evolution, how does this explain
Jesse Helms? Hegel said that reality can
be rationally understood because the uni
verse is itself rational. But what about
realty? Most real estate agents basically
belong at the bottom of the food chain.
October 3, 1989
My girlfriend and I have begun to dis
cuss marriage in serious terms. She is
reluctant to take my name after we are
wed, although I assure her she can get
used to being called "Andrew." Instead of
exchanging rings at the wedding ceremony
we feel it would make the proper political
statement if we were to exchange crus
taceans. I think Kierkegaard would approve
since he believed people should choose
their own truths, although he never ex
plicitly mentioned crustaceans.
December 25, 1989
What is the true meaning of Christmas?
My faith believes it is a celebration of the
birth of Jesus as told in the New Testa
ment, although in our texts the gifts of
myrrh and frankincense brought by the
Three Wise Men are ditched in favor of
a Nintendo system. Bacon said that in
vestigation should begin with observable
facts instead of theories What did he have
up his butt, anyway? I bet he never had

a Nintendo to play with during adolesj
cence.
January 3, 1990
I am beginning to doubt the existence
of God since He broke our lunch date at
the last minute to go smote the Middle
East. Nietzsche believed that God was
dead, but I have been watching the news
papers and they have not said anything
to that effect. Of course, in the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, God's death would rank
somewhere behind the 49ers latest victory
and a long story about the percentage of
rain that has fallen this year compared to
the percentage of rain that fell last year
Aquinas was right.
January 15, 1990
I woke up this morning in a cold sweat,
pondering the age-old question of whether
a tree falling in the forest makes a sound
if no one is there to hear it. What if a
tree falls on the Pet Shop Boys? I know
that Sartre believed life is meaningless and
arbitrary, but I think he would have
changed his tune if he had seen a tree
suddenly squash the Pet Shop Boys.

Andrew Berkowitz is a senior majoring
in Linguistics. He will be graduating in
April, but Gary, The Daily will never be

little sense in the context of 17th-century
England. I fear Stonehenge was built by
Wayne Gretzky and a defenseman named

Idea for a Broadway musical: Wistful
music plays as the curtain opens to reveal
a man running to catch the bus. When
he reaches the bus stop he suddenly
realizes that all the other people in his
city have been transformed into gourds.
In the second act, his co-workers (played
by gourds) throw him a birthday party
although it is not his birthday, and later
throw him into a pit filled with rats and
people named "Ralph." I think this would
work either as a musical or perhaps as
an epic poem inscribed on Brie cheese.
Camus said that life is absurd; I suspect
his first name was "Ralph."

Looking up at the stars this evening I
wondered whether man is but a miniscule,
insignificant part of the universe, or if he
is, in fact, the ultimate end product of all
evolution What about woman? She seems
far more useful in the whole scheme of
things, especially since she has better

handwriting. If man is the ultimate end
product of evolution, how does this explain
Jesse Helms? Hegel said that reality can
be rationally understood because the uni
verse is itself rational. But what about
realty? Most real estate agents basically
belong at the bottom of the food chain.

My girlfriend and I have begun to dis
cuss marriage in serious terms. She is
reluctant to take my name after we are
wed, although I assure her she can get
used to being called "Andrew." Instead of
exchanging rings at the wedding ceremony
we feel it would make the proper political
statement if we were to exchange crus
taceans. I think Kierkegaard would approve
since he believed people should choose
their own truths, although he never ex
plicitly mentioned crustaceans.

What is the true meaning of Christmas?
My faith believes it is a celebration of the
birth of Jesus as told in the New Testa
ment, although in our texts the gifts of
myrrh and frankincense brought by the
Three Wise Men are ditched in favor of
a Nintendo system. Bacon said that in
vestigation should begin with observable
facts instead of theories What did he have
up his butt, anyway? I bet he never had

a Nintendo to play with during adolesj
cence.

I am beginning to doubt the existence
of God since He broke our lunch date at
the last minute to go smote the Middle
East. Nietzsche believed that God was
dead, but I have been watching the news
papers and they have not said anything
to that effect. Of course, in the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, God's death would rank
somewhere behind the 49ers latest victory
and a long story about the percentage of
rain that has fallen this year compared to
the percentage of rain that fell last year
Aquinas was right.
January 15, 1990
I woke up this morning in a cold sweat,
pondering the age-old question of whether
a tree falling in the forest makes a sound
if no one is there to hear it. What if a
tree falls on the Pet Shop Boys? I know
that Sartre believed life is meaningless and
arbitrary, but I think he would have
changed his tune if he had seen a tree
suddenly squash the Pet Shop Boys.

Stanford (AP) — The curator of the
Andrew Berkowitz Papers Project an
nounced today the release of the first in
an expected 20-volume collection of
Andrew Berkowitz's private writings. Ac
cording to curator Burton Quinine,
volume one of "I Looked Taller In My

comprises the entries in Berkowitz's
private diary dating from 1987 until his
surprise disappearance in 1990 while
backpacking in Hoboken, New Jersey.
THE ANDREW BERKOWITZ DIARIES
October 14. 1987
While bicycling in the park this morning
I realized suddenly that today is the first
day of the rest of my life. It reminded me
of what my grandfather used to say: "The
journey of a thousand miles begins with
a single step, although it's much faster to
fly." Spinoza wrote that life on earth is
but a preparation for life after death. If
this is true, then why can I not major in
Life After Death, or at the very least take
a Stanley H. Kaplan course to prepare?
Questions such as these plague me.
November 14, 1987
Today I met the woman 1 one day hope
to marry. She is beautiful, with skin that
is smooth as silk and a voice that sounds

like the songs of the gods. Problem: I am
afraid that if I ask her out on a date she
will insist on going to McLizard's and
ordering a Big Newt with Cheese. Should
I tell her my religion prohibits the eating
of lizards, or should I renounce my faith
and fear the wrath of my father? It was
he, after all, who served gila monster at
my Bar Mitzvah. Wasn't it Hume who
denied the possibility of genuinely valid
knowledge? He must have been the one
who crossed out all the verbs in my physics
textbook and replaced them with Folger's
crystals.
January 3, 1988
I thought I had proven the existence of
God today while scribbling proofs on a
fuece of notebook paper. It wasn't until
ater that I realized I had gotten the math
wrong and had proven the existence of
the Zamboni ice resurfacer. When Locke

refuted the divine right of kings was he
referring to the Los Angeles Kings? This
fits with the Zamboni proof, but makes
little sense in the context of 17th-century
England. I fear Stonehenge was built by
Wayne Gretzky and a defenseman named
Pierre.
