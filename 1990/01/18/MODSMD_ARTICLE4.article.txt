# Hoover fellow tabs Quayle adviser as 'Z'

### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Ever since The New York Times devoted an
entire Op-Ed page to someone known only as
"Z," academics and policy makers have been
speculating about who is behind that cryptic
letter.
And at least one Stanford scholar, who has
more than two decades of foreign service ex
perience and was a high-ranking official in
the Reagan Administration, thinks he just
might know who that mysterious author is.
By some accounts, the unknown Z has writ
ten one of the most telling, insightful political
documents since 1947, when George Kennan
anonymously wrote a sweeping article intro
ducing the policy of containment of commu
nism. The article by Kennan, an architect of
post-World War II U.S. foreign policy, fanned
the icy fire of the Cold War.
Though perhaps not as wide-reaching as
Kennan's article, which appeared under the
name X, Z's hard-line essay declares the futility
of some of the reforms in the Soviet Union.
