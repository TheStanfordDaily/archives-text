# Hoover fellow tabs Quayle adviser as 'Z'
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Ever since The New York Times devoted an
entire Op-Ed page to someone known only as
"Z," academics and policy makers have been
speculating about who is behind that cryptic
letter.
And at least one Stanford scholar, who has
more than two decades of foreign service ex
perience and was a high-ranking official in
the Reagan Administration, thinks he just
might know who that mysterious author is.
By some accounts, the unknown Z has writ
ten one of the most telling, insightful political
documents since 1947, when George Kennan
anonymously wrote a sweeping article intro
ducing the policy of containment of commu
nism. The article by Kennan, an architect of
post-World War II U.S. foreign policy, fanned
the icy fire of the Cold War.
Though perhaps not as wide-reaching as
Kennan's article, which appeared under the
name X, Z's hard-line essay declares the futility
of some of the reforms in the Soviet Union.
Unless the Soviet Union com
pletely rids itself of communism,
reform can only lead to failure
and the perpetuation of a stagnant
political concept, Z argues. Thus,
U.S. economic support to partially
overhaul the Soviet Union is a
waste of money, Z concludes.
The political position set forth
in Z's article, which is printed in
the January issue of the quarterly
Daedelus, contradicts President
Bush's policy to support fully the
changes in Eastern Europe.
Since the Z article appeared,
many scholars and government of
ficials have offered speculations
based on Z's political position.
Everyone from U.S. foreign policy
expert Henry Kissinger to under
secretary for defense Paul Wol
fowitz have been named as
possible candidates.
However, Hoover senior re
search fellow Charles Hill, who
was executive assistant to George
Shultz in the State Department,
said he thinks other clues may
implicate Carnes Lord, Vice Pres
ident Dan Quayle's top political
adviser. Lord has not been named
publicly as a possibility.
Lord helps shape Quayle's po
litical views, and Quayle's skepti

cal remarks about changes in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union might be explained if Lord
is Z.
Hill argued that The Times
would not have given so much
attention to the article if the au
thor were not a high-level govern
ment official. "I don't think they
would put a mid-level person on
the Op-Ed page (anonymously),"
he said.
Furthermore, Hill said, Z's el
oquence indicates he has strong
ties to other academic scholars.
Few high-level government offi
cials have "the ability to express
themselves at this level," he
noted. That further narrows the
list.
The clincher, in Hill's judgment,
is a reference at the end of the
article. "The party," Z writes,
"though now dyed with the hues
of glasnost and democratization,
will cling to the bitter end, like
some poisoned tunic of Nessus,
around the bodies of nations it
has enfolded in its embrace for so
many decades."
The "poisoned tunic of Nessus"
is a reference from one of Sop
hocles' tragedies, "The Women of
Trachis."
Hill thinks Lord is one of the
very few people who could have
used that phrasing and fits the
other requisites. Lord, who has
held various U.S. government

posts in the past, is widely known
for his writings on ancient polit
ical thought.
After Lord's Washington secre
tary consulted with Lord, she
said, "He doesn't know anything
about it."
Shultz pointed out that the ar
ticle does not have the wide
reaching implications of Kennan's
article on containment. Shultz
said yesterday,"I don't think it's
anywhere close to that category."
When asked whether he
thought Lord might be Z, he said
he thinks it is a possibility.
