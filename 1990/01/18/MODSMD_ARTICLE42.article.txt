# Acting in a Winter 'One-derland'
## Unique students create original dramas

Anyone named Macbeth knows
that fate and friendship take funny
turns.
Alison Macbeth Hills doesn't be
lieve that her middle name influ
enced her decision to take a
playwriting class at Stanford last
year. But she knows that the im
portance of friendships between
women will always influence her
writing, whatever form it takes.
Hills' one act play "Aliens in
Weems' Creek" chronicles a ram
bling, intimate conversation be
tween two young women who get
drunk and honest with each other.
As Courtney and Dylan commu
nicate with each other, both the
friends and the audience learns
what love and loss mean to these
two women.
"I just found the characters and
let them talk," said Hills. "They're
speaking for themselves."
Hills admits that what the two
women say to one another doesn't
always fit beneath the proscenium
arch."In the end something that
sounds really realistic as dialogue
doesn't make it on the stage," she
said.
"Aliens" culminates in a star
tling revelation of one woman's

homosexuality. "The ending was
hard to discover," she said. "It just
kind of evolved."
The second One Act, written by
junior Aleta Hayes, explores evolu
tion as well â€” the evolution of a
soul.
Hayes dances in the ruddy
shadows of the cross.
"I grew up in church," she said,
fingering the cross hanging around
her neck. Hayes feels the weight
of this cross, and she bears it in
her art.
The Stanford junior, a perform
ance artist who acts, dances and
sings with vibrant energy, turned
that energy towards playwriting in
her "Untitled: Mixed media col
lage. . . ." Hayes performs in her
own work, a dramatic monologue
delivered by a young black woman
of the Bethel Holiness Temple
Congregational Church.
For Alena, the woman in "Un
titled," the church is a place of
beauty, light and transcendence,
as well as a place of condemnation,
powerlessness and fear. For Aleta,
too, memories of church are bit
tersweet.
"It's not the church that bothers
me, not the words," she said. "It's
the institution."
But Hayes cannot walk away
from her upbringing without

the cross hanging around her neck. She feels

walking away from her greatest
strengths. "The teachings are a
part of my life," she said. "They
are a strength for me here, in a
place that regards the intellect as
more important than the heart."
But in sophomore Dan Kronen
feld's vision of America, neither
the intellect nor the heart can save
the characters in "Junk Culture."
And maybe they can't even save
Kronenfeld.
After all, he displays some tell
tale symptoms of pop-video culture
corruption. "For me a study break
is a trip to Tower Records," said
the Stanford sophomore.
"I don't have time for hobbies,"
he continued. "But if there were a
major here in Tetris, that's what
I'd do." (Tetris, by the way, is a
fascinatingly pointless video game
played on Macintosh computers.)
This curly-headed undergrad
"majoring in Undeclared" sports
John Lennon glasses and speaks
in rapid-fire soundbites. "Art today
is so influenced by the media," he

said. "It's not meant for in-depth
perusal but for a rapid once-over."
Kronenfeld turns the tables in
his work, giving television and the
advertising media a rapid once-over
in his play "Junk Culture."
Not exactly a teleficionado,
Kronenfeld avoids the tube. "I ha
ven't watched TV for a long time,"
he said. "When I watch something,
I think, 'Gees, it's so far from
reality.'"
But TV is reality for many Amer
icans. What bothers Kronenfeld
even more is the fact that such a
reality is permeated with commer
cials. "The cheesiness of the
(advertising) media gets to me," he
said.
Kronenfeld charges cheesiness in
"Junk Culture" with slams on cor
porate sponsors like Exxon, which
has done "such a wonderful job
with the environment."
True to his anti-institutional
corporate-cheesy-ad-sponsor eth
ics, Kronenfeld has a message for
readers: "Disregard this article."
