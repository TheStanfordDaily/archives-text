# Winter One Acts triumph despite challenging subject matter
## 
### Melissa Dagodag 
"Original Winter One Acts" may
seem an inappropriate title for this
year's Ram's Head production, be
cause only the first play in the
sequence, "Aliens in Weem's
Creek," confines itself to one act.
Yet each of the scripts explores
weighty topics in decidedly original
ways.
Sophomore Lisa Hills wrote the
first in the sequence, "Aliens in

Weem's Creek." As Hills describes,
"Aliens" portrays "friendships and
the tensions involved when these
bonds involve strong individuals."
Yet the play doesn't offer satisfying
solutions to certain issues it raises.
This lack of resolution creates
dramatic tension, and ultimately
the play's strongest feature when
the less vivacious Courtney reveals
to the more extroverted Dylan that
she is in love with her.
The second play in the sequence,

"Untitled," has only one speaking
part, portrayed by the playwright
Aleta Hayes.
"Untitled" illuminates one
woman's loss of innocence
through realizations about religion
and about her boyfriend.
Monologue and dance speak to
people who let others control their
lives. The lead character, Alena,
emphasizes her lack of control, ad
mitting that her boyfriend is a sub
stitute for her father. Her dance

illustrates how she tends to follow
male leadership. In one sequence
she leans on Jules and she nearly
falls down when he is not there
to support her.
Playwright and actress Hayes
makes a poignant statement to
women — that independence and
self-assertion may not be tradition
ally feminine characteristics, but
are necessary aspects of self
fulfillment.
"Junk Culture" by sophomore

Daniel Kronenfeld, is markedly
distinct from the first two plays.
In Kronenfeld's words, this piay
has "the therne of over
commercialization at its roots."
Elise, the lead character played
by Ellen Schwerin, returns from a
seven year visit to Iceland, only to
•find that she cannot accept her
"couch-potato," suburban family.
Dissatisfied with their boring, in
door lifestyle, she proposes to build
a park with grass and trees.
However, her peaceful vision be
comes a nightmare when the com
mercial sponsorship necessary to
fund the park takes over and turns
the park into an industrial fair.

Although the dialogue is as
suredly humorous, the thrust of
the play is quite serious, as the
play's ending demonstrates. The
play concludes with a final look
at Elise's family.
After her intentions for the park
have proven disastrous, she joins
her family in vegetating in front
of the television. Her ultimate sub
mission to the "couch-potato" life
style suggests the eventual
permeation of commercialization
into every aspect of our selves.
"Junk Culture" definitely
succeeds in raising a serious,
thought-provoking issue through
humorous, engaging dialogue.
