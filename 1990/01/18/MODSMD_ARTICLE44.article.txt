# 'Daisy’ blossoms into moving film
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
According to Miss Daisy, the
Piggly Wiggles misbehavior — and
not her bad driving — is behind
her numerous accidents.
Whether the Piggly Wiggly is act
ing up or not, Miss Daisy's son
Boolie knows that no insurance
company will cover her. So Boolie
(Dan Aykroyd) hires a driver
named Hoke (Morgan Freeman).
Although Miss Daisy takes six
days of walking before she con
cedes that she needs Hoke behind
the wheel, the two eventually
develop a touching relationship
during their 25 years together.
"Driving Miss Daisy" is a study
of the long-term interaction of
these two very different characters.
It focuses on the day-to-day aspects
of life — driving to the store and
to temple — while it also examines
issues such as the civil rights
movement in a quiet, day-to-day

manner that is characteristic of the
film.
There are no grand marches or
visible acts of violence, yet the
subtle specter of racism and anti
semitism exists for both Miss
Daisy and Hoke.
Along with racism, aging is an
other force that forges their friend
ship, as the sudden death of a
housekeeper touchingly portrays.
Yet at the very heart of "Driving
Miss Daisy" are the superb
performances of Freeman as Hoke
and Jessica Tandy as Miss Daisy.
As the stubborn Southern lady,
Tandy creates a richly detailed
character that is proud and inde
pendent, at the same time afraid
of being pretentious and alone.
Both Freeman and Tandy give
Oscar-worthy interpretations of
Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize
winning play rewritten for the
screen, and Aykroyd is also
noteworthy as Boolie.
