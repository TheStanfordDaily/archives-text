# 'Glory' captures Civil War strife

It's been a long, long time since I saw a film with
a "serious" message that lived up to my expectations.
Thus, when I saw the enticing previews for "Glory"
over Christmas break, I remained somewhat wary
that it might somehow turn out to be the "feel good
movie of the '905."
For those of you who have yet to see it, however,
I urge you to leave your dramatic qualms at the
popcorn counter.
Based on fact, "Glory" takes on the difficult subject
of the 54th Regiment in the Union Army during the
Civil War. The 54th's story is unique because it was
the first Negro regiment to serve in battle against
the Confederacy.
Matthew Broderick plays Colonel Robert Gould
Shaw, the 23-year-old white Harvard graduate who
leads the regiment. Broderick delivers an excellent
performance as Shaw, who struggles to allow his
troops their chance to fight for freedom.
Outstanding performances abound in "Glory." Mor
gan Freeman convincingly portrays an older runaway
who helps guide both Shaw and the black soldiers
along the path toward combat readiness. Major
Forbes, a close friend of Shaw's, is portrayed well by
Cary Elwes, the hero from"The Princess Bride."
Denzil Washington stands out in a role as an ex-slave
