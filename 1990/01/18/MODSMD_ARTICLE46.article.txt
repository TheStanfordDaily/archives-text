# Temptation to pick a winner overwhelms critics

New-bom music award cere
monies such as the American
Music Awards and the MTV
Music Video Awards may have
taken some of the luster off the
gold-plated Grammy, but the in
dustry's most esteemed awards
ceremony will still take place in
Los Angeles Feb. 21.
The mystique and suspense
surrounding the Grammy Award
is magnified by the announce
ment of nominees that occurs one
month before the ceremony.
It's a kind of mind game — by
narrowing the list of eligible
musicians or songs down to five,
people get tempted to pick the
winners. For music reviewers, the
temptation is even stronger.
All five of this year's nominees
for Record of the Year have
achieved commercial success and
air play exploitation. However,
only one song stands out as par
ticularly special.
Bette Midler's "Wind Beneath
My Wings," from the "Beaches"
movie soundtrack, and Mike and
the Mechanics' "The Living
Years" are both sweet, melodious
ballads. Yet they are destined for
musical futures trapped within
the confines of elevators and den
tist offices. "She Drives Me
Crazy," the Fine Young Can
nibals' spunky dance hit, echoes
this ephemeral quality — while

the tune is incredibly infectious,
the song lacks substance.
A long shot for Record of the
Year is Billy Joel's "We Didn't
Start the Fire," a collection of ran
dom images from the Cold War
to the present. It reeks of R.E.M.'s
"It's the End of the World As We
Know It (And I Feel Fine)."
However, the odds-on favorite
must be Don Henley's "The End
of the Innocence."
When he was still an Eagle,
Henley won Record of the Year
in 1977 with "Hotel California."
Once again, Henley has nostalgi
cally captured the aura and emo
tion of the last decade, with the
musical assistance of co-writer
Bruce Hornsby. "O' beautiful for
spacious skies / But now those
sides are threatening / They're
beating plowshares into swords /
For this tired old man that we
elected king."
"The End of the Innocence" is
a testament not only to the '80s,
but also to the staying power of
Henley as a musician and a
lyricist. It deserves the Record of
the Year award.
In the Album of the Year cat
egory, the winner is much less
apparent. The particular genres
of each of the five albums span
a variety of tastes. Yet, over
shadowing the triumph of Bonnie
Raitt's comeback album, "Nick
of Time" and the sporadically
placed hits of the Fine Young

Cannibals' "The Raw and the
Cooked" are three albums that
remain solid throughout their en
tire duration.
Tom Petty's "Full Moon Fever"
marks a landmark point in the
musician's career. Without his
Heartbreakers, Petty enlisted the
help of George Harrison, Roy Or

bison, Jeff Lynne and Del Shan
non to produce 12 tracks ranging
from the smooth self-reflection of
"Free Fallin'" to the sharp riffs of
"Runnin' Down a Dream." Hen
ley's album, also titled "End of
the Innocence," also shows a wide
range of musical skill and lyrical
imagery.

Yet, the advantage in this cat
egory lies with the Traveling Wil
burys' "Volume One." Originally,
Harrison, Orbison, Petty and
Lynne added Bob Dylan to a jam
session to create the back side of
a single. The compilation of 10
