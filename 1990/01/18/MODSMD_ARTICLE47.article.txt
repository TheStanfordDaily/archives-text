## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Students looking for a great new
restaurant that's only a nop, skip
and a jump away should make the
right choice and sample the food
at "Fresh Choice" in the Stanford
Shopping Center.
"Fresh Choice" is one of a chain
of several Bay Area restaurants that
share the same name and offer the
same simple fare at excellent
prices.
In today's health-conscious so
ciety, the restaurant's cafetaria
style, soup-and-salad motif is not
unique. But, for the price, "Fresh
Choice" offers a wide selection and
it's all-you-can-eat policy allows
you to keep coming back for more.
For under $7 you can return to
the salad and pasta bar as many
times as you like. For just a little
bit more, you can choose from
several different soups. Drinks are
extra, but refills are free and so
are an assortment of delicious
muffins and fruits that are in
cluded in the price of the salad bar.
The restaurant feels new and
the people who work there are ex
tremely courteous. At first, you
might be overwhelmed by the dif
ferent culinary options that "Fresh
Choice" offers. But after you find
your way through the maze of food,
you'll be glad you decided to try
"Fresh Choice" and you'll come
back again and again.
And each time, you'll wish you
had a bigger appetite.
