# Collection tells complete 'Story’ of Stewart's two-decade career
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
With classic rock dominating
the airwaves, most of today'.i
popular artists are starting their
third or fourth decade of recording.
To cash in on this trend, record
companies have been putting to
gether multi-record boxed sets at
a rate quicker than kids can save
the money.
Most of these four to six record
sets, like the latest ones from the
Rolling Stones or fethro Tull, are
merely oversized greatest hits al

bums containing all those songs
we hear over and over on the radio
— and the avid fan who would
buy a $60 collection probably has
all the songs on different albums
anyway.
Then there's Rod Stewart's
"Storyteller." The four CD, sixty
plus song collection not only
outlines a brilliant career, it offers
access to plenty of tough-to-find
early recordings and unreleased
material.
Disc number one begins with
Stewart's first recordings. The mid
'6os sessions were dominated by

what was then termed "white
blues." The obviously young
sounding and soulful voice of
Stewart works well interpreting
classics like, "Good Morning Little
School Girl" and "Shake."
In the informally written liner
notes, Stewart remarks on his 1966
remake of Sam Cooke's ""Shake,"
calling it a "desperate attempt at
sounding like Otis Redding, but
nevertheless, worthy of inclusion
for historical reasons."
The collection stands as a his
torical representation of an artist
who kept evolving while moving

in and out of bands throughout
the late '60s and early '70s before
embarking on a solo career. It in
cludes such vintage tunes like "I
Ain't Superstitious" and "Shapes
of Things" that came from his un
ion with the Jeff Beck Group and
"Gasoline Alley," which marks the
beginning of a prosperous solo
career.
Disc two ('7l-'75) and disc three
('75-'81) are filled with the classics
ranging from the Faces' party song
"Stay with Me" to the provocative
"Maggie May" and the moving
cover of Cat Stevens' "The First

Cut Is the Deepest." The '70s were
good to Stewart both critically and
commercially. Then came the '80s.
The past 10 years have found
Stewart under constant attack for
his disco-influenced, inconsistent
records. The fourth disc, however,
manages to weed out any waste,
highlighting the past decade's finer
moments such as "People Get
Ready," a product of his reunion
with Jeff Beck.
While five songs off of "Out of
Order," Stewart's 1988 release,
might be a bit much, the album
concludes with positive signs for

the '90s.
The finale, a powerful transla
tion of Tom Waite's "Downtown
Train," finishes of the set on the
perfect note.
"Storyteller" reveals the evolu
tion of a great vocalist who can
take the music of the times and
claim it for his own. The closing
track reveals not only what has
been accomplished after 26 years
in the business, but what certainly
can be looked forward to — more
great material from a true super
star.
