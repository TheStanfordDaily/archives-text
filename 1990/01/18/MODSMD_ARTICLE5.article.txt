# Shultz declares: 'We are living in a new age'

### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Few speakers would agree to give a talk on
"What's New in the World and Why" and, even if
they did, few would take them seriously. But when
former Secretary of State George Shultz dared to
expound on the subject yesterday, a crowd of more
than 400 packed into Cubberley Auditorium to lis
ten.
The experienced diplomat and Business School
professor declared that "the world is changing
rapidly and we are living in a new age."
We are experiencing "the confluence of three
historical forces," he said.
The first force is the "open policy" of trade and
discourse adopted by Western nations after World
War 11. The second force is the "closed policy" of
nations which did not figure into the Western alli
ance. And the third force is the emergence of the
information age, Shultz explained.
According to Shultz, it is this third force that is
allowing many people to gain information about
world events so that "we all can see how this big
experiment is going."
Shultz said that on various diplomatic missions
during his term on President Reagan's cabinet, he
was surprised to see that, just as the State Depart
ment did, government agencies in the Soviet Union
and China all tuned in to Cable News Network
Shultz was optimistic about the future and added
to the students in the audience: "I wish I knew
what I know now and was your age." *
Students were anxious to learn what Shultz
thought about the dramatic events of 1989.

Former Secretary of State George Shultz told a packed house in Cubberley Auditorium "What's New
In the World and Why" yesterday. He said the easy exchange of information has helped bring about
rapid change In the world.
When a student asked him to
predict what the Soviet Union
would be like in a few years, he
told a story about a White House
luncheon, during which then-
President-elect George Bush had
asked Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev a similar question. Gorba
chev responded, "Even Jesus
Christ couldn't answer that."
Shultz said that was as good
an answer as any, adding, "Gor
bachev is the most skillful trapeze
artist in the history of the world.
He will hang on, but it will be
quite an act."

Shultz predicted that Gorba
chev may have to use force to
stop the turmoil in the Soviet Un
ion.
"Somewhere, some time, deci
sions were made that caused an
avalanche," Shultz said. "So far,
Gorbachev has employed the first
law of avalanche control: 'stay out
of the way.' "
Shultz also fielded a question
about the Middle East peace proc
ess. He explained that it is a dif
ficult situation because there is a
lot going on beneath the surface.
Summing up the events of 1989,
Shultz said that "people power"
has certainly made an impact and
created a "new environment" for
change.
