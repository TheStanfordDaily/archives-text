# Go-Go emerges with 'Grace'
## 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
Four years after dissolving the '80s most
successful all-female band, ex-Go-Go Char
lotte Caffey has re-entered the music scene
in a most graceful manner.
Together with L.A.-based vocalists Gia
Ciambotti and Meredith Brooks, Caffey has
formed The Graces. This threesome consti
tutes a highly talented band whose debut
album, "Perfect View," displays more depth
and sincerity than one would expect from
the pop world.
Since the break-up of the Go-Go's, Caffey
has been busy writing, recording and touring
with fellow former Go-Go Belinda Carlisle.
Caffey also co-wrote most of the material
on "Perfect View" with producer Ellen
Shipley.
This is not the first time that Caffey and
Shipley have worked together. Shipley and
co-writer/producer Rick Nowels are also re
sponsible for most of Carlisle's last two
albums.
With the same writers and production
staff, it is no surprise to find that The
Graces' musical style resembles that of Car
lisle. The Graces have even recorded "Should
I Let You In" which was written by Caffey

and appeared on Carlisle's "Heaven on
Earth" release. Brooks, however, is more
cheerful in her delivery of the lyrics and
gives the ballad a slightly more upbeat tone.
This song is only one of many that make
this album stand out in the drab, over
processed, pre-packaged world of slick pop
music. Fortunately, The Graces display a
lot more maturity, both in style and content,
in their work than most pop singers; and
the difference is noticeable.
In terms of both the music and the vocals,
the quality never wavers. From the first
release, "Lay Down Your Arms" to the last
notes of "Out In The Fields," The Graces'
debut album keeps your feet tapping.
Their three voices are all powerful and
distinctive, sounding just as good har
monized as they do on their own. So, as
they trade off lead vocals, you get to hear
fresh voices further increasing the joy of
listening to the album.
Caffey has the honor of lead vocals on
the first release, "Lay Down Your Arms"
and the title track. Meanwhile, Ciambotti
delivers the wonderful lyrics to "We Never
Met" in a manner that showcases her superb
vocal talents.
All in all, it's safe to say that The Graces
are a refreshing exception.


Former Go-Go Charlotte Caffey offers us a "Perfect View" of why she doesn't need
Belinda Carlisle to make good music.
