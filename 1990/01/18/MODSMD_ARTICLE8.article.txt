# New fields, courts on the way
## Athletic facility improvements will reduce overcrowding 
### Holly Hacker 
The phenomenon of midnight
intramurals may come to an end
with the opening of several new
additions to the University's ath
letic facilities this September.
Construction is currently un
derway behind the newly
renovated Burnham Pavilion —
formerly Old Pavilion — on an
addition which will include a new
varsity gymnastics center and
open play multi-purpose court
space.
This addition, which together
with Burnham Pavilion will be
named the Ford Center for Sports
and Recreation, will bring more
flexibility in scheduling intra
mural and varsity events and
reduce overcrowding, according to
Senior Associate Director of Ath
letics Alan Cummings.
The center will be the site of
many physical education classes,
recreational activities and indoor
IM competitions, all of which now
take place in Maples Pavilion.
Before the reopening of
Burnham Pavilion last Septem
ber, men's and women's basket
ball, volleyball and gymnastics
competitions and practices were
held in Maples. Combined with
IM activities, overcrowding and
problems with scheduling the
various events ensued.
"The crowded conditions in
Maples a year ago pointed out the
critical shortage of indoor space,"
Cummings said. Because space
was so limited, IM events ended
as late as midnight to accommo

date all the activities.
The Ford Center should double
the amount of court space avail
able, according to Cummings. "It's
a great relief to a very over
crowded situation," Cummings
added.
In addition, the size of the
weight room in Encina Gym will
increase when the gymnastics fa
cility moves from its current lo
cation in Encina to the Ford
Center. Cummings said the plans
to expand the Encina weight room
and supplement its existing equip
ment are underway, thereby al
lowing students, faculty and staff
to work out without the long lines
and crowded conditions.
Cummings said he hopes to
begin renovation of the weight
room by the start of the next
school year, as soon as the Ford
Center is completed. "The day
(gymnastics) moves out of Encina
is the day we want to move in,"
he said.
In addition, the Department of
Athletics is in the planning stages
of renovating Angell Field.
"We'd like to convert Angell
Field into a large multi-purpose
IM and recreation grass field to
help ease the crowded conditions
of IM North and South," Cum
mings explained, referring to the
fields near the stadium currently
used for intramurals. He added
that the turf area will be increased
as early as this year.
While active planning has not
yet begun, the University would
also like to build a new complex
on the west side of campus, near

the tennis courts, making Roble
Gym available for other uses. The
center would include basketball
and racquetball courts, space for
martial arts and dance, a 51-
meter swimming pool and locker
and shower rooms. However,
these plans "are five to 10 years
away, maybe longer," Cummings
said.
The cost for both the renovation
of Burnham Pavilion and the ad
dition which will become Ford
Center is approximately $10
million. "They've been very hard
dollars to raise," Cummings said,
adding that most of the money
was donated by alumni and
"friends of the athletic programs."
After the master plan for Ford
Center was presented in Septem
ber 1987, fundraising began in
1988. The Athletics Department
has had much success in raising
money for the facility, and it is
now within about $200,000 of its
$10 million goal. The Ford Center
construction "has been a very
high University and department
priority," Cummings said.
The Oct. 17 earthquake has not
affected or delayed construction
plans. Instead, Burnham Pavilion
was opened to displaced students.
Because much of the restoration
to the building consisted of seis
mic bracing, Burnham Pavilion
was safe to reopen.
"It was fortunate that all that
work had been done because we
were delighted to open the doors
to people and provide shelter for
displaced students," Cummings
said.

ment are underway, thereby al
lowing students, faculty and staff
to work out without the long lines
and crowded conditions.
Cummings said he hopes to
begin renovation of the weight
room by the start of the next
school year, as soon as the Ford
Center is completed. "The day
(gymnastics) moves out of Encina
is the day we want to move in,"
he said.
In addition, the Department of
Athletics is in the planning stages
of renovating Angell Field.
"We'd like to convert Angell
Field into a large multi-purpose
IM and recreation grass field to
help ease the crowded conditions
of IM North and South," Cum
mings explained, referring to the
fields near the stadium currently
used for intramurals. He added
that the turf area will be increased
as early as this year.
While active planning has not
yet begun, the University would
also like to build a new complex
on the west side of campus, near

the tennis courts, making Roble
Gym available for other uses. The
center would include basketball
and racquetball courts, space for
martial arts and dance, a 51-
meter swimming pool and locker
and shower rooms. However,
these plans "are five to 10 years
away, maybe longer," Cummings
said.
The cost for both the renovation
of Burnham Pavilion and the ad
dition which will become Ford
Center is approximately $10
million. "They've been very hard
dollars to raise," Cummings said,
adding that most of the money
was donated by alumni and
"friends of the athletic programs."
After the master plan for Ford
Center was presented in Septem
ber 1987, fundraising began in
1988. The Athletics Department
has had much success in raising
money for the facility, and it is
now within about $200,000 of its
$10 million goal. The Ford Center
construction "has been a very
high University and department
priority," Cummings said.
The Oct. 17 earthquake has not
affected or delayed construction
plans. Instead, Burnham Pavilion
was opened to displaced students.
Because much of the restoration
to the building consisted of seis
mic bracing, Burnham Pavilion
was safe to reopen.
"It was fortunate that all that
work had been done because we
were delighted to open the doors
to people and provide shelter for
displaced students," Cummings
said.
