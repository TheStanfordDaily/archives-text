# Many freshmen find fault with their pre-major advisers
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
Junior Ajay Agarwal says he
had an excellent freshman adviser.
My adviser "offered a lot of en
couragement, a lot of guidance,"
Agarwal said. "He'd push us to
take as much as we could handle,
even though we were just fresh
men in college."
By contrast, "Angelica," a fresh
man who asked not to be identi
fied, said she is convinced that
her adviser does not care about
her.
"If [advisers] cared, they'd ful
fill their commitment," Angelica
said. "I'm going to have to learn
to do this myself, or I'm going to
turn to other people who can ad
vise me."

And Lorena Barron, a junior in
chemistry, was neutral toward her
adviser.
"Throughout high school,
everything I ever did was by
myself, so I didn't really need
one," she said.
These and other student re

sponses illustrate the diverse
range of advising expe
riences reported by past and pres
ent freshmen.
Stanford's freshmen advising
system has received harsh
criticism from outgoing students
in the last few Senior Surveys.
Over the past three years, about
41 percent of the seniors taking
the survey rated the system as
poor.
But Thomas Wasow, dean of
Undergraduate Studies, said he
does not understand the bad
reviews, given the reforms imple
mented by former advising center
director Audrey Bernfield.
As a result of Bernfield's ef
forts, the center now provides
more individualized attention for
students than do comparable

centers at other colleges, Wasow
said.
"There may be extrinsic reasons
for those low ratings," he said.
"The [advising center] shouldn't
be blamed entirely for them."
Among the possible explana
tions for the low ranking is the
time span between filling out the
survey and being advised, Wasow
said.
But though many students have
complained about the system,
there may be only limited room
for improvement, counselors at
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter said.
Advising is about relationships
between individuals, said Andre
Sursock, assistant director of the
advising center.
"It has to be a two-way rela

tionship; otherwise it doesn't
work," she said. "It's usually an
eye-opener for the student to
realize that he didn't play the
good advisee."
Some freshmen hit it off with
their advisers immediately.
Valerie Powell, an undeclared
freshman, said that her adviser
has been active in cultivating their
relationship.
Besides eating dinner in the
dorm every Tuesday, he is plan
ning an advisee bike trip for an
upcoming weekend, Powell said.
But other students have found
that relationships with their ad
visers take time to develop.
Sophomore Kristina Omari felt
that she and her adviser were not
going to work out. But because
he seemed receptive to criticism,

she revealed her feelings to him
in private.
"Once that was on the table,
we were able to work on our re
lationship," she said. "By the end
of the year, I was able to relax
and just talk to him.
"Now I like my adviser so much
that I'm hesitant to declare," she
added.
Freshman Natalie Coneway is
undergoing a similar process. Like
many other first-year students,
Coneway was overwhelmed by all
the choices Stanford presented
her.
While her advising associate
helped to dispel some of her initial
fear, Coneway said she was some
what disappointed with her fac
