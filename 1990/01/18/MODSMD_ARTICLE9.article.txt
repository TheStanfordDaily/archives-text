# Many freshmen find fault with their pre-major advisers
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
Junior Ajay Agarwal says he
had an excellent freshman adviser.
My adviser "offered a lot of en
couragement, a lot of guidance,"
Agarwal said. "He'd push us to
take as much as we could handle,
even though we were just fresh
men in college."
By contrast, "Angelica," a fresh
man who asked not to be identi
fied, said she is convinced that
her adviser does not care about
her.
"If [advisers] cared, they'd ful
fill their commitment," Angelica
said. "I'm going to have to learn
to do this myself, or I'm going to
turn to other people who can ad
vise me."

And Lorena Barron, a junior in
chemistry, was neutral toward her
adviser.
"Throughout high school,
everything I ever did was by
myself, so I didn't really need
one," she said.
These and other student re

sponses illustrate the diverse
range of advising expe
riences reported by past and pres
ent freshmen.
Stanford's freshmen advising
system has received harsh
criticism from outgoing students
in the last few Senior Surveys.
Over the past three years, about
41 percent of the seniors taking
the survey rated the system as
poor.
But Thomas Wasow, dean of
Undergraduate Studies, said he
does not understand the bad
reviews, given the reforms imple
mented by former advising center
director Audrey Bernfield.
As a result of Bernfield's ef
forts, the center now provides
more individualized attention for
students than do comparable

centers at other colleges, Wasow
said.
"There may be extrinsic reasons
for those low ratings," he said.
"The [advising center] shouldn't
be blamed entirely for them."
Among the possible explana
tions for the low ranking is the
time span between filling out the
survey and being advised, Wasow
said.
But though many students have
complained about the system,
there may be only limited room
for improvement, counselors at
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter said.
Advising is about relationships
between individuals, said Andre
Sursock, assistant director of the
advising center.
"It has to be a two-way rela

tionship; otherwise it doesn't
work," she said. "It's usually an
eye-opener for the student to
realize that he didn't play the
good advisee."
Some freshmen hit it off with
their advisers immediately.
Valerie Powell, an undeclared
freshman, said that her adviser
has been active in cultivating their
relationship.
Besides eating dinner in the
dorm every Tuesday, he is plan
ning an advisee bike trip for an
upcoming weekend, Powell said.
But other students have found
that relationships with their ad
visers take time to develop.
Sophomore Kristina Omari felt
that she and her adviser were not
going to work out. But because
he seemed receptive to criticism,

she revealed her feelings to him
in private.
"Once that was on the table,
we were able to work on our re
lationship," she said. "By the end
of the year, I was able to relax
and just talk to him.
"Now I like my adviser so much
that I'm hesitant to declare," she
added.
Freshman Natalie Coneway is
undergoing a similar process. Like
many other first-year students,
Coneway was overwhelmed by all
the choices Stanford presented
her.
While her advising associate
helped to dispel some of her initial
fear, Coneway said she was some
what disappointed with her fac
ulty adviser at first.
She got initial advice on her
fall schedule from him, but when
she did not get into the original
classes and needed more advice,
her faculty adviser was out of the
country. Coneway felt "aban
doned," she said.
But since her adviser returned,
the situation has changed. "We've
seen him frequently, and they've
been good encounters," she said.
For an international student ar
riving at the Farm, not only is
the campus new, usually the
country is a new experience as
well. While an adviser can help
ease the transition to a new cul
ture, an advising system very dif
ferent than those at schools in
their native countries can be a
surprise for foreign students.
Sophomore Owen Maubane
came to Stanford after graduating
from a predominantly white
school in South Africa and spend
ing six months at a university in
Johannesberg.
"The sort of attitude back home
is you sink or swim on your own,"
Maubane said. "They didn't have
nearly as many resources for help
ing people."
Not knowing what to expect
from Stanford's advising system,
Maubane said he found it "an

added perk I wasn't even looking
for."
But other international stu
dents describe their advising ex
periences with slightly less
enthusiasm, depending on their
familiarity with Stanford's sys
tem.
From talking with his friends
and reading "Courses and
Degrees," Vikas Taneja, a sopho
more in computing systems and
economics, came to Stanford from
India with an idea of what to
expect.
The academic system in India
was "100 percent different than
the one here," and Taneja said it
took him a week to figure out
Stanford's approach.
Taneja's pre-major adviser
would try to speak with him sep
arately, in a way that seemed too
stifling, he said.
Taneja said that instead of dis
cussing academics with his advis
er, he usually asked friends and
resident assistants to help him
when questions did come up.
Freshmen are not the only stu
dents involved in the pre-mtyor
advising system.
Transfers are assigned to the
advisng center for counseling,
without a student advising asso
ciate or a faculty adviser. Some
transfer students, however, have
a more difficult time adjusting to
Stanford academics than fresh
men do.
Theresa Pulido, a transfer from

Phoenix College, explains: "At
junior colleges, you only take the
basics. When you come to a huge
institution like Stanford, and you
only have two years, if you have
an idea of what you want to take,
you kind of lose it."
The advising center is geared
to students who have time to ex
plore their possibilities, Pulido
said.
Sophomores also can be just as
confused as freshmen.
Debbie Palmer, a junior in an
thropology, had a good freshman
adviser. That year, she primarily
needed someone to welcome her,
she said.
But when it came to choosing
a major, her adviser really did not
know Stanford's departments well
enough to help Palmer match
what she wanted to what was

there, she said.
Her adviser told her "that I was
really on top of things and that
I knew what I was doing, which
didn't help much, because I didn't
feel that way myself," she said.
In response to problems like
Palmer's, the advising center has
begun a series of workshops for
sophomores, said Hector Cuevas,
director of the center.
According to Sursock, the
workshops appear to be alleviating
some classic sophomore troubles.
Typically, the advising center
handles 30 to 40 requests from
sophomores who wish to switch
pre-major advisers by winter
quarter. But so far this year, they
have had only five, she said.
"It's because they're not being
neglected anymore," Sursock ex
plained.
Junior Ajay Agarwal says he

centers at other colleges, Wasow
said.
"There may be extrinsic reasons
for those low ratings," he said.
"The [advising center] shouldn't
be blamed entirely for them."
Among the possible explana
tions for the low ranking is the
time span between filling out the
survey and being advised, Wasow
said.
But though many students have
complained about the system,
there may be only limited room
for improvement, counselors at
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter said.
Advising is about relationships
between individuals, said Andre
Sursock, assistant director of the
advising center.
"It has to be a two-way rela

tionship; otherwise it doesn't
work," she said. "It's usually an
eye-opener for the student to
realize that he didn't play the
good advisee."
Some freshmen hit it off with
their advisers immediately.
Valerie Powell, an undeclared
freshman, said that her adviser
has been active in cultivating their
relationship.
Besides eating dinner in the
dorm every Tuesday, he is plan
ning an advisee bike trip for an
upcoming weekend, Powell said.
But other students have found
that relationships with their ad
visers take time to develop.
Sophomore Kristina Omari felt
that she and her adviser were not
going to work out. But because
he seemed receptive to criticism,

she revealed her feelings to him
in private.
"Once that was on the table,
we were able to work on our re
lationship," she said. "By the end
of the year, I was able to relax
and just talk to him.
"Now I like my adviser so much
that I'm hesitant to declare," she
added.
Freshman Natalie Coneway is
undergoing a similar process. Like
many other first-year students,
Coneway was overwhelmed by all
the choices Stanford presented
her.
While her advising associate
helped to dispel some of her initial
fear, Coneway said she was some
what disappointed with her fac
ulty adviser at first.
She got initial advice on her
fall schedule from him, but when
she did not get into the original
classes and needed more advice,
her faculty adviser was out of the
country. Coneway felt "aban
doned," she said.
But since her adviser returned,
the situation has changed. "We've
seen him frequently, and they've
been good encounters," she said.
For an international student ar
riving at the Farm, not only is
the campus new, usually the
country is a new experience as
well. While an adviser can help
ease the transition to a new cul
ture, an advising system very dif
ferent than those at schools in
their native countries can be a
surprise for foreign students.
Sophomore Owen Maubane
came to Stanford after graduating
from a predominantly white
school in South Africa and spend
ing six months at a university in
Johannesberg.
"The sort of attitude back home
is you sink or swim on your own,"
Maubane said. "They didn't have
nearly as many resources for help
ing people."
Not knowing what to expect
from Stanford's advising system,
Maubane said he found it "an

added perk I wasn't even looking
for."
But other international stu
dents describe their advising ex
periences with slightly less
enthusiasm, depending on their
familiarity with Stanford's sys
tem.
From talking with his friends
and reading "Courses and
Degrees," Vikas Taneja, a sopho
more in computing systems and
economics, came to Stanford from
India with an idea of what to
expect.
The academic system in India
was "100 percent different than
the one here," and Taneja said it
took him a week to figure out
Stanford's approach.
Taneja's pre-major adviser
would try to speak with him sep
arately, in a way that seemed too
stifling, he said.
Taneja said that instead of dis
cussing academics with his advis
er, he usually asked friends and
resident assistants to help him
when questions did come up.
Freshmen are not the only stu
dents involved in the pre-mtyor
advising system.
Transfers are assigned to the
advisng center for counseling,
without a student advising asso
ciate or a faculty adviser. Some
transfer students, however, have
a more difficult time adjusting to
Stanford academics than fresh
men do.
Theresa Pulido, a transfer from

Phoenix College, explains: "At
junior colleges, you only take the
basics. When you come to a huge
institution like Stanford, and you
only have two years, if you have
an idea of what you want to take,
you kind of lose it."
The advising center is geared
to students who have time to ex
plore their possibilities, Pulido
said.
Sophomores also can be just as
confused as freshmen.
Debbie Palmer, a junior in an
thropology, had a good freshman
adviser. That year, she primarily
needed someone to welcome her,
she said.
But when it came to choosing
a major, her adviser really did not
know Stanford's departments well
enough to help Palmer match
what she wanted to what was

there, she said.
Her adviser told her "that I was
really on top of things and that
I knew what I was doing, which
didn't help much, because I didn't
feel that way myself," she said.
In response to problems like
Palmer's, the advising center has
begun a series of workshops for
sophomores, said Hector Cuevas,
director of the center.
According to Sursock, the
workshops appear to be alleviating
some classic sophomore troubles.
Typically, the advising center
handles 30 to 40 requests from
sophomores who wish to switch
pre-major advisers by winter
quarter. But so far this year, they
have had only five, she said.
"It's because they're not being
neglected anymore," Sursock ex
plained.
Junior Ajay Agarwal says he
had an excellent freshman adviser.
My adviser "offered a lot of en
couragement, a lot of guidance,"
Agarwal said. "He'd push us to
take as much as we could handle,
even though we were just fresh
men in college."
By contrast, "Angelica," a fresh
man who asked not to be identi
fied, said she is convinced that
her adviser does not care about
her.
"If [advisers] cared, they'd ful
fill their commitment," Angelica
said. "I'm going to have to learn
to do this myself, or I'm going to
turn to other people who can ad
vise me."

And Lorena Barron, a junior in
chemistry, was neutral toward her
adviser.
"Throughout high school,
everything I ever did was by
myself, so I didn't really need
one," she said.
These and other student re

sponses illustrate the diverse
range of advising expe
riences reported by past and pres
ent freshmen.
Stanford's freshmen advising
system has received harsh
criticism from outgoing students
in the last few Senior Surveys.
Over the past three years, about
41 percent of the seniors taking
the survey rated the system as
poor.
But Thomas Wasow, dean of
Undergraduate Studies, said he
does not understand the bad
reviews, given the reforms imple
mented by former advising center
director Audrey Bernfield.
As a result of Bernfield's ef
forts, the center now provides
more individualized attention for
students than do comparable

centers at other colleges, Wasow
said.
"There may be extrinsic reasons
for those low ratings," he said.
"The [advising center] shouldn't
be blamed entirely for them."
