"The quality of your life is in direct proportion to your
commitment to excellence" -Vince Lombardi
If we are interested in talking to Computer Science, Engineering and Liberal Arts graduates, why are we quoting a sports hero?
Wouldn't it be better to borrow a few words from Einstein, Sagan, Bell, Proust, Freud, Courvoiser...
We don't happen to think so.
The message we want to get across relates to drive, energy, push and yes, even sweat.
We think the above qualities have a lot to dj with success in the classroom, on the field and in the business world.
