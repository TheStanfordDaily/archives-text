Verity Powell
Pre-professional adviser
"I see a lot of students
who are trying to please
parents or trying to meet
some arbitrary stand
ards. They defer their .
own wants and needs
too much."


Ruby Mason
Pre-professional adviser
"Utilize your resources.
There's advising, student
services, overseas
studies, psychological
services, the Center for
Teaching and Learning.
You've got a whole ad
vising setup here for
helping you get the best
Stanford education you
can."


Andr6e Sursock
UAC assistant director
"Take an active part in
your education. Take
small classes, seek out
research opportunities,
or do an honors thesis."


Kara Kerns
Head advising associate
Explore all your options:
"I see too many fresh
men who come and say
This is what I want to
do,' and it's been a mis
take."


Kathy Wright
Academic adviser
"Almost every student I
see has wonderful ideas,
but they do not know
how the University works
— how to convert their
ideas into reality. I think
good advising helps stu
dents do that and helps
students understand that
the responsibility for that
happening is primarily
theirs."


Dandre Desandles
Academic adviser
"Good advising is more
than which course to
take when. It makes
you question your as
sumptions, ask yourself
about your goals, and
opens you to possibili
ties you may not have
considered. Make sure
you get it."
