### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice
President Dan Quayle, facing
resistance to proposed visits to
several Latin American nations,
may have to settle for talks with
some leaders outside their home
countries, administration officials
indicated yesterday.
Without going into detail,
Quayle said that by the end of a
March trip to presidential in
augurations in Brazil and Chile
— following a Jan. 27 trip to the
inauguration in Honduras — he
believed "we will have personally
communicated with almost every
leader in the hemisphere."
However, several countries have
signaled that it is too soon for
Quayle visits because of simmer
ing resentment over the U.S. mil
itary invasion of Panama, officials
said.
Quayle, speaking yesterday of
his scheduled trip to the inaugu
ration in Tegucigalpa, said,
"There'll be a lot of leaders there
if we are able to work in the
schedule and meet most of them.
It's not necessary just to go and
pay a courtesy call" in each indi
vidual nation, he said in an in

terview with The Associated
Press.
He is expected to carry Presi
dent Bush's explanations regard
ing the Dec. 20 Panama invasion,
which rankled the Latin world.'
Aides said other, as yet undeter
mined stops are expected on the
mid-March trip to Brazil and
Chile.
Quayle said he will not meet
with the leaders of Peru, Colom
bia and Bolivia because Bush will
see them Feb. 15 at the Colombia
summit meeting on how to fight
illicit drugs.
The vice president's aides are
scheduling at least four bilateral
sessions with heads of state who
attend the Honduras inaugura
tion, said his press secretary, Da
vid Beckwith.
He did not specify the countries.
Aides have said scheduling of
the trip has been bogged down by
reaction from countries such as
Venezuela where some officials
have said it would not be good
for Quayle to come while troops
remain in Panama.
In Caracas, Venezuela's foreign
minister, Reinaldo Figueredo, said

yesterday, "We understand he's
not coming," but refused to say
why.
Figueredo had said a day ear
lier, however/ "Maybe his visit is
not the most adequate step to be
taken given ttti 'conditions that
exist with respect to the U.S. in
vasion of Panama."
Quayle on yesterday character
ized the Latin response as: "It's
not 'don't come.' It's a matter of
timing, when you would come."
The administration yesterday
tried to play down those problems
at the same time it acknowledged
inability to schedule visits to some
capitals.
"Some of the trips ... may have
to be scheduled for a later time,
but we'll continue to work on
that," said White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
"Obviously there were concerns
in Latin America following the
Panama situation. Obviously
there were reasons why the pres
ident felt it was necessary to
reiterate our support and our in
terest in working with them," he
said.
