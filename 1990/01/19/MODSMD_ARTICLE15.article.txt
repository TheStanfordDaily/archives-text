# Study links sexual activity to coffee

ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) -
Older couples who drink coffee
appear to be more sexually active
than elderly non-coffee drinkers,
according to a new study.
In response to a survey, 62 per
cent of married women age 60 and
older who drank coffee said they
were sexually active. Forty percent
of women older than 60 who do
not drink coffee said they were
active.
Among married men the same
ages, 36 percent of coffee drinkers
said they sometimes were im
potent, compared with 59 percent
of those who don't drink coffee.
The study published in the Jan
uary issue of the Archives of In
ternal Medicine did not give a
margin of error or date for the
survey of 744 Michigan residents
done by Dr. Ananias Diokno of

William Beaumont Hospital in the
Detroit suburb of Royal Oak.
Diokno said coffee stimulates
the central nervous system and
relaxes certain muscles. He said
it also was possible coffee drinkers
are "more liberal in their sexual
behavior."
But some researchers were
skeptical.
"Oh, Lord help us, now they've
linked coffee and sex," said Gail
Kershner Riggs, associate director
of restorative medicine at the Uni
versity of Arizona's College of
Medicine, who has done her own
research on sex among elderly
women.
"Dr. Diokno is a respected re
searcher," said Dr. Tom Stanisic,
a professor of surgery and urology
at the University of Arizona Col
lege of Medicine in Tucson. "But

before anyone starts drinking cof
fee to boost their sex life, it would
be wise if other people looked into
this a little more.
"It's not something I would act
on immediately."
Coffee and caffeine are popular
research topics; more than 500
studies on their effects have been
published in medical journals
since 1983. Some studies have
linked coffee to heart disease, high
cholesterol levels and pancreatic
cancer, while others found no such
relationship.
Diokno's survey also found that
about 75 percent of married el
derly men and 56 percent of
married elderly women remain
sexually active, compared with 31
percent of unmarried elderly men
and 5 percent of unmarried elderly
women.
