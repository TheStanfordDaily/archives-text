# Hungary wants Soviets out
## 
### 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) - Hun
gary yesterday demanded that the
estimated 52,000 Soviet troops in
its country go home in 1991 at
the latest, accelerating its
timetable for a pullout.
At East-West arms control
talks, it also broke ranks with the
Soviet Union and proposed dra
matic cuts in foreign toops, in
cluding U.S. soldiers, stationed in
Europe.
The surprise announcements by
Ferenc Somogyi, state secretary
of the Hungarian Foreign Mini
stry, were another sign of the
growing independence of members
of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
Czechoslovakia wants the
75,000 Soviet troops in Poland
out by the end of 1990. In Poland,
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
made a similar demand yesterday
in talks with Soviet Ambassador
Wladimir Browikow.
Walesa said he told Browikow
the Soviet troops should have been
withdrawn "a long time ago be
cause a situation may occur when
it will be hot and people will start
to protest."
In the drive toward democracy,
the Budapest government has told
Moscow it wants its troops
withdrawn but gave no deadline.
Somogyi insisted yesterday that
they must leave this year or 1991
at the latest.
"There is no political or military
reason which would justify or call
for the foreign troops ... in Hun
gary," he told a news conference.
He said the Hungarian armed
forces was capable of defending
its own territory.
In 1956, the Soviets sent troops
and tanks into Hungary to silence
a popular uprising against
Stalinism. Reformist Premier
Imre Nagy was later convicted of

'There is no political or military reason
which would justify or call for the
foreign troops ... in Hungary.'

treason in a show trial and ex

Hungary's cuurrent premier,
Miklos Nemeth, recently met So
viet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov to
arrange talks on a pullout.
Nemeth had stressed that with
drawal depended on an East-West
agreement to reduce conventional,
or non-nuclear, forces in Europe.
About 10,000 Soviet troops al
ready have left both Hungary and
Czechoslovakia under a gradual
withdrawal of 50,000 soldiers
from Eastern Europe, announced
in December 1988 by Soviet Pres
ident Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
An additional 6,000 of the
52,000 Soviet troops said to be
left in Hungary are due to leave
this year. An undisclosed number
are to leave Czechoslovakia, where
officials say there are 75,000 So
viet troops.
Somogyi also said he formally
proposed greater cuts in foreign
troops than previous U.S. or So
viet proposals at the 23-nation ne
gotiations on reducing conven
tional arms in Europe.
President Bush has suggested
the United States and the Soviet
Union trim their forces stationed
in Europe, outside their home ter
ritory, to 275,000 on each side.
That would require the Soviets to
pull out 300,000 troops and the
United States 30,000.
The Soviet Union has talked

about a limit of 300,000 to
350,000 troops stationed abroad
in each alliance. That would cover
not only American, but also
British, French and other Western
forces stationed in West Germany.
Somogyi said his plan would gc
farther.
The ceiling, he said, should
cover all foreign forces and "be
brought much below the currently
negotiated level of 275,000
troops."
He gave no number.
He said Hungary believes there
would be no need of foreign troops
in Europe were the current poli
tical developments to continue.
But he said it would be unrealistic
now to push for total withdrawal.
The arms negotiations is be
tween the 16 nations of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the seven of the Warsaw Pact.
NATO wants to reach an agree
ment this year troops, tanks, ar
tillery and other conventional
arms.
Senior military officers from 35
nations also were meeting in
Vienna for a third day to discuss
East-West military strategies.

Vasile lonel, said the new govern
ment was working to create a
democratic society. He said the
government wanted a military
budget that provided the mini
mum amount necessary for na
tional defense.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa

to protest."
In the drive toward democracy,
the Budapest government has told
Moscow it wants its troops
withdrawn but gave no deadline.

President Bush has suggested
the United States and the Soviet
Union trim their forces stationed
in Europe, outside their home ter

United States 30,000.
The Soviet Union has talked

about a limit of 300,000 to
350,000 troops stationed abroad
in each alliance. That would cover
not only American, but also
British, French and other Western
forces stationed in West Germany.

The ceiling, he said, should
cover all foreign forces and "be
brought much below the currently
negotiated level of 275,000
troops."
He gave no number.
He said Hungary believes there
would be no need of foreign troops
in Europe were the current poli
tical developments to continue.
But he said it would be unrealistic
now to push for total withdrawal.
