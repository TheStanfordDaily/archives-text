Israel confident of aid
WASHINGTON (AP) — Israeli Defense Min
ister Yitzhak Rabin wound up talks with Bush
administration officials yesterday saying he had
"reason to believe" U.S. assistance to his country
would hold steady at $3 billion a year through
1991.
But Rabin registered concern beyond next year,
saying Israel's budget is strained by a rising
influx of Soviet Jews and increased Soviet weap
ons shipments to Syria, Iraq and Libya.
He also indicated that Secretary of State James
A. Baker 111 was unable to resolve a diplomatic
impasse that is delaying Mideast negotiations on
the future of the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza.
"There are still gaps that remain between the
Palestinians and Israelis," Rabin told Israeli
reporters.
The key question is whether the Palestine Lib
eration Organization will have even an indirect
role in the negotiations that Baker hopes to
launch.
Rabin stressed Israel's budget problems and
concerns about U.S. aid, after he saw Baker.
"When it comes to the Middle East the glasnost
is not seen there," Rabin said.
He referred to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev's policy of openness, which has lowered
barriers to Jews seeking to emigrate. At the same
time, Rabin said, the Soviets had increased both
the flow and quality of arms to the three Arab
countries.
"In view of all this, we believe that we deserve
the continuation of the level of support that we
get," Rabin said.
Bush nears record support
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush is win
ning near-record approval ratings in polls as his
first year in office draws to a close.
Here are highlights of polls conducted by the
three television networks in affiliation with
newspapers and reported Wednesday and
yesterday:
-ABC-Washington Post: Of 1,518 adults, 79
percent approve of Bush's handling of his job,
six points better than President Reagan's peak
in the same poll.
-CBS-New York Times: 76 percent of 1,557
people approve.
-NBC-Wall Street Journal: 71 percent of 1,500
approve.
A Gallup Poll earlier this month gave Bush an
approval rating of 80 percent, the highest for
any president at any time since World War 11.

President Kennedy recorded a 77 percent rating
at one point in 1962.

Panamanians favor invasion
PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) — Most Pana
manians questioned in a poll consider the U.S.
invasion a "liberation" and want the troops to
stay as long as needed to establish order, accord
ing to results released yesterday. Consultoria
Interdisciplinaria en Desarrollo, a Gallup associ
ate, conducted the poll Jan. 5-13 among 1,304
Panamanians in urban and rural areas.
"The results of the poll show a Panamanian
people that agree with the military action of the
United States in their country, consider it a
liberating act and accept with pleasure the gov
ernment of President Guillermo Endarsa," CID
said.
Of those asked, 89 percent said they felt the
U.S. action was necessary; in answer to another
question, 86 percent said they considered it a
liberation; 88 percent said they saw it as beneficial
to Panama; and a similar proportion said they
wanted the U.S. forces to remain in Panama.
Amal displays prison
KAWTHARIET ASSIAD, Lebanon (AP) — The
Shiite Moslem Amal militia yesterday displayed
an underground prison where it said U.S. Marine
Col. William Higgins was briefly held before his
reported death.
Melhim Qanso, Amal's spokesman in south
Lebanon, said the seven-cell prison, dug behind
a car painting shop in this southern village, was
used by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah "to hold in
nocent victims, including foreign hostages."
"Higgins was held here for three days shortly
after his abduction," Qanso told reporters.
He said Amal has arrested an underground
Hezbollah network in Kawthariet Assiad, 11
miles southeast of the port of Sidon.
"Its members confessed that Higgins was
here," Qanso said.
Higgins, who headed a U.N. observer team in
south Lebanon, was kidnapped near the southern
port of Tyre Feb. 17, 1988. The Organization of
the Oppressed on Earth claimed it killed him
last July after Israel kidnapped a Hezbollah sheik.
U.S. intelligence officials believe Higgins, of
Danville, Ky., was killed a year earlier in retal
iation for the downing by an American warship
of an Iranian Airbus in the Persian Gulf, killing
260 people.
