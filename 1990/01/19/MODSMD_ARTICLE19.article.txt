## Tackle the pressure 
### 
STUDENT ATHLETES face a
tremendous amount of pres
sure — from professors, par
ents, friends, coaches and fans —
and those pressures sometimes
make them look to performance
enhancing drugs to live up to ex
pectations.
Now the NCAA has come up
with its solution: random testing
for those drugs throughout the
year at Division I-A and Division
I-AA schools.
While the testing will keep some
from using for fear of not being
able to play, it does nothing to
provide the support these athletes
need to keep them away from
steroids.
From a public relations stand
point, the new program will prob
ably work. Several magazines,
newspapers and books have
reminded the public about the hold
drugs have on the sports world,
and now the NCAA can say they

are doing something to "catch" the
wrongdoers.
But the plan will fail to solve
the problem. The NCAA will only
catch a fraction of the players using
drugs, while doing nothing to
decrease the need these players see
for looking to steroids.
Aside from the legal questions
involved, the testing will stop only
a few student athletes, and the
majority of offenders will continue
to use and abuse.
If anyone needs an example of
how this works, look at the NCAA's
inability to deal with recruiting vi
olations.
A more comprehensive plan is
needed to tackle drugs in sports
— one that grapples with the prob
lems that create use. Coaches must
be included in this plan, since their
pressure can often push student
athletes to steroids.
Counseling is also a valuable
part of any plan.
