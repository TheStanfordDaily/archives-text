# Lake needs funds, not water
## ASSU lacks finances to hire necessary lifeguard for Lagunita 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Even though the University is taking
preliminary measures to fill it up, Lake
Lagunita may still remain an uninsured,
unused fire ring unless someone can
drum up funds for a lifeguard.
According to Michael Jackson, assis
tant dean of student affairs, "The Lake
Committee is discussing how and under
what circumstances we can provide an
athletic as well as recreational program
at Lake Lagunita."
Jackson said a lifeguard is "absolutely
necessary" to the lake for safety
reasons. But nobody knows exactly
where the money will come from to hire
the lifeguard.
He added that the lake, which has
not been filled for the last two years
because of drought conditions, will
remain dry if there is another drought.
In the past the office of the dean of
student affairs gave the ASSU the

money to pay the lifeguard, a sum of
about $22,000, according to ASSU fi
nancial manager Sandra Leal.
However, "when the Boathouse got
torn down, all the money got reallocated
. . . to fund other budget line items."
She said the bulk of the reallocation
went to pay for increased ASSU insur
ance costs.
Leal said the director of the sailing
program, Joseph Petrucci, "is now re
questing the ASSU to fund the
lifeguarding program."
Petrucci could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.

But the ASSU may have trouble com
ing up with the money, Leal said.
Jackson said that if the ASSU cannot
provide the funds, he will explore al
ternative funding routes. But he cau
tioned that if he had to make a choice
between paying for ASSU insurance,
and funding a lifeguard, "I'm leaning
toward insuring the rest of the ASSU's
programs."
He hinted that much of the decision
rests in the ASSU's hands. "The ques
tion is — if it turns out there is enough
water — if students wanted to have a
lake, would students be willing to put
up funds?" he asked.
Leal expressed similar concerns, won
dering whether funding a lifeguard
would be a wise use of funds. "From
my experience, nobody seems to be
feeling sad" about the lack of a lake,
she said.
"We have to know — is a $20,000
expenditure on a lake something the
students are going to use?" Leal said.
