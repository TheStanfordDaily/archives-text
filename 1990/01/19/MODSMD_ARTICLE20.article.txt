# Beware of runoffs

### 
The assu elections
COMMISSION has had the
last laugh with computer
ized elections.
According to the commission's
report, 78 percent of voters enjoyed
last spring's computerized ASSU
elections,..the first of their kind in
the state of California. Those
satisfied ASSU-fee-refund-seekers
turned out in record numbers.
Moreover, the computerized elec
tions yielded results much more
quickly than any previous ASSU
elections and were $3,300 less
costly than traditional paper ballot
elections.
Of course, the elections were not
entirely a tip-toe through the tulips
last spring: Some hardware hang
ups on the first day slowed the
flow of ballots, the eternal plague
of long lines at the ballot sites

persisted and the commission was
caught with its pants down when
a runoff election was required.
Therefore, even though the com
puterized ballots could be counted
at the speed of light, all the win
ning and losing candidates were
not determined until two weeks
later after a hastily conducted
paper ballot runoff.
As our technologically progres
sive University marches on into
April, the commission can learn
from the mistakes of last year. Bar
ring mechanical problems, if the
commission is prepared in the
event of a runoff, the elections
could come off smoothly.
In the final summation, comput
erized ballots have the best poten
tial for making high-speed,
low-cost, user-friendly elections
possible.
