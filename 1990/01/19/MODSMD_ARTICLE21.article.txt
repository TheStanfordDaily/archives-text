You can make a difference, carry on King 9 s dream

THIS MONDAY our nation cele
brated the birthday of Martin
Luther King Jr. and paid tribute
to the movement that he was such a
central part of.
The fact that such a day exists is in
itself evidence of the the great strides
made by the civil rights movement.
Thirty years ago, a black person could
not even share equal access to public
transportation and most public es
tablishments.
At that time, a national celebration
in commemoration of a black man was
inconceivable. However, due to the
persistence and struggle of many
Americans, and the leadership of King,
Americia today is a better place than it
was thirty years ago.
It is fitting that on the heels of the
King celebrations, Stanford kicks off
the seventh annual "You Can Make a
Difference" Conference.
This year the central theme of the
conference is on improving education.
The conference title, "A Changing
Education In a Changing World,"
properly reflects the broad scope of the

issues the conference will address.
Although all Americans today share
equal access to public transportation,
they still do not all share equal access
to many of the American institutions
which are essential to making all equal
citizens.
This includes access to higher educa
tion. Even at the high school level, the
dropout rates for people of color are
around 50 percent, and the figures do
not improve in colleges and univer
sities.
In general, the ability of the Ameri
can educational system to meet the
needs of America's youth has become a
central question as we embark on the
'90s.
However, this is not a time of
despair, but one of hope. We must take
inspiration from those who desire to
make change.
The quest to better American educa
tion is one way to continue the legacy
of Martin Luther King and to keep the
dream alive. It is through education
that this nation has traditionally tried
to provide equal opportunity.

Changing and improving on the
educational system therefore makes
America a better and more democratic
place. Let us not forget that the civil
rights movement started with the
desegregation of schools.
Here at Stanford, we should rejoice
in the spirit of change that has
brought us such advances as the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program, the
University Commitee on Minority
Issues report and our first Asian-
American Studies professor.
Much of student activism in the late
'80s was centered around various
issues of education, which has been
seen by some as the modern civil
rights movement. It is the correct role
of students to be involved in shaping
their education and making it more
democratic.
This year's "You Can Make A Differ
ence" Conference is providing a way
for students to find out how this in
volvement can begin.
The Council of Presidents would like
to acknowledge and thank the Martin

Luther King Jr. Commemorative Com
mittee and the Black Student Union
for the fine work they have done
sponsoring programs throughout the
week, as the BSU has done throughout
the year.
We would also like to acknowledge
and thank all the student volunteers
who have helped pull together the
conference and the conference coordina
tors, Bruce, Goodwin, Julie and Pat.
Last night, the conference got off to
a great start with the presentation
from Bay Area students and the film
"Stand and Deliver." We encourage all
students to check out the conference
and attend as many events as possible,
particularly the Keynote Panel on
Saturday morning at 9 a.m. in Kresge
Auditorium.
Find out how you can make a differ
ence and carry on King's dream.
