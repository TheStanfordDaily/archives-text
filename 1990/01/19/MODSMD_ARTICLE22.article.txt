# Evidence, as well as commitment, is needed in rape prosecutions
## 
### 
I have a few comments in response
to The Daily's fine editorial Monday on
the Task Force on Sexual Assault.
Those who recall the results of the
1989 survey by the Rape Education
Project know that not only were the
sexual assault statistics alarmingly
high, the reporting statistics were
alarmingly low.
I am hopeful that the response and
support groups being identified and
publicized by the task force will also

serve to encourage the reporting of
assaults to the police, campus authori
ties or both.
The editorial called for "an active
commitment ... to prosecute attackers
under the Fundamental Standard." I
have no problem with that; the com
mitment is there, both on my part and
on the part of others.
It is important to realize, however,
that commitment alone does not yield
prosecutions. The University's judicial
process requires evidence of guilt
"beyond a reasonable doubt, a strin
gent requirement in any allegation but
especially so in rape allegations where
the available evidence may reduce to
one person's word against another's.
Two rape allegations were reported

to the Judicial Affairs Office last year
and neither one led to Fundamental
Standard charges because the evidence
was inadequate.
One complaint was submitted over
two years after the alleged offense;
accounts from other students that
might have supported that of the
woman involved were inconsistent in
important respects and could not be
used against the alleged rapist. The
passage of time was a mtyor cause of
the evidence problem.
The evidence in the second complaint
was incomplete because of an alcohol
induced memory lapse by the alleged
victim. There was one apparently com
plete account (from the male student),
one partial account (from the female

student), no witnesses and no addi
tional evidence.
Prosecutions will follow from com
plaints and compelling evidence. Basic
solutions to the problem of sexual as
sault, however, will not be found
through University or external judicial
action.
The problem lodges in attitudes and
behaviors that are sexist and self
destructive. Fortunately, what is
learned can be unlearned and the
groups that can help that process
along, in addition to the new task
force, include the Rape Education Proj
ect and Heightened Education and
Awareness on Acquaintance Rape.
