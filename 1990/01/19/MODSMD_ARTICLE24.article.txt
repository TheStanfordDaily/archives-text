## The 						'C' is for 'Collegiate' 
### 
I LOVE college basketball.
No other sport produces as many
bizarre and thrilling upsets and leaves
such indelibe images in the mind's eye
of the sports fan. And for sheer excite
ment, the Final Four is sport's finest
spectacle.
That said, I have problems with the
governing body of college athletics, the
NCAA. As college sports have rocketed
into the big time and the big bucks, the
NCAA has looked the other way as schools
skirt recruiting rules, fail to maintain
any academic standards and exploit the
talents of young athletes.
Once their eligibility dries up, the
schools abandon them.
When the NCAA does enact punitive
measures against a school for recruiting
violations, it seldom challenges the big
name, schnntoi
stead, it slaps around "tV).e
cheaters like Marist and
State," writes John Feinstein in his new™
book, "A Season Inside."
"The experts, the ones who have been
doing it for years, never get caught. They
are too smart and/or too powerful," he
writes.
The cheating, illegal recruiting and piti
ful graduation rates are revolting when
one remembers that universities —
"institutions of higher learning" — are
the culprits.
The NCAA often seems to forget that
its 'C' stands for "Collegiate" and it has
a role in educating student-athletes. In
stead, it doggedly pursues the riches to
be mined from television contracts, cor
porate sponsorship and sold-out

stadiums.
Surprisingly enough, at the annual
NCAA conference last week in Dallas
some promising steps forward were
taken.
The convention voted to cut the bas
ketball season from 28 to 25 games and
shorten spring football practice from 20
to 15 days.
In addition, starting next year, schools
will have to release their graduation rates
for athletes to the public and to prospec
tive recruits.
The cutbacks won't come cheap; one
Syracuse University official estimated
that his basketball program could lose
up to $1.5 million from the cutbacks.
Pennsylvania State University football
coach Joe Paterno, a man with two na
tional titles on his resum6, provides a
V gire
lastf week's progress as # starting
point, not a climax.
Curiously enough, despite the progress
made during the convention, the NCAA
ducked one of its most controversial crea
tions: Proposition 42, which denies ath
letic scholarships to students faiHng to
graduate from high school with a 2.0
grade point average and a score of 700
on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
Instead, the convention repealed the
measure after a year of intense criticism
from Georgetown University basketball
coach John Thompson and Temple Uni
versity coach John Chaney. Chaney's hys
terical charges of racism and class war
fare however can be dismissed without

losing any intellectual content from the
debate.
Thompson may be one of college sports'
great martyrs, but he is a very bright
man, has an outstanding record for grad
uating athletes and should be consulted
in this debate.
Unfortunately, he aimed his
melodramatic protests last season — in
cluding walking off the floor of two games
in protest of Proposition 42 — at the
wrong targets.
As The New Republic suggested a year
ago, Thompson should protest the failure
, of America's schools to ; prepare JK>Qr ,iy
ban students for collegfe. He should then
'use hia considerable leverage towtflPfi
forming a policy that allows the NCAA
to secure government loans for students
that need to attend junior college to meet
Proposition 42 standards.
"No test can tell you how much fire
is in anyone's belly" to want to learn,
Georgetown President Father Timothy
Healy said in support of Thompson's
protests.
True enough, but if the NCAA and
colleges want to help student athletes
who want to learn, they will see that
Proposition 42 can be used to achieve
some academic integrity in college sports.
