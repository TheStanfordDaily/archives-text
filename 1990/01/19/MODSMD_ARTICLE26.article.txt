## Events' power often cannot be conveyed in news stories 
### 
DURING THIS WEEK, I've atten
ded two celebrations of Martin
Luther King Jr. and his legacy,
covering both for The Daily as a
reporter. I think, though, that these
were two of those rare times when I
gained as much from being at the
events as writing about them.
I planned to observe the official
holiday by reporting on a parade at
Escondido Village, expecting to hear
speeches from a variety of Stanford
students. To my surprise, the proces
sion was composed primarily of
elementary schoolers from the Escon
dido community.
Although The Daily would probably
just run a photograph of the event
instead of a story, I wanted to talk to
some of the youngsters to see what
they had to say about King.
When asked about what King meant,
one 7-year-old boy said, "He helped
black people be like white people. It
didn't matter that they were black."
Another child piped in, "Like you!"
She was quickly reprimanded by a

nearby adult, who then apologized for
her. What for, I thought. It'll be a long
time before anyone's going to make me
ashamed of being black.
The thing she really needed to
apologize for was the boy's generalized
description of King's work.
While it's true that many black
people now share the prosperity of this
country, many of us do not. On the
whole, African-Americans cannot say
we have attained economic parity in
this society.
And even if we could, blacks
wouldn't be "like white people." Most
Stanford students have been exposed to
some of the cultural differences be
tween the two groups, so there's little
point in trying to rehash them here.
The bright spot is that today's kids
are learning about King and others
who led the civil rights movement
earlier than before. Even if they start
off with misguided generalizations, they
are likely to find their way to the
truth.
The down side is that manv Stan-

ford students probably marked the
holiday with ski trips and movie runs.
At a time when a Stanford junior
can tell me in all earnestness that
Ronald Reagan was the greatest civil
rights leader of the 20th century, the
need for an ethnic studies requirement
seems greater than ever.
Forget whatever The Wall Street
Journal has to say in its editorial
pages. It fancies itself to be the diary
of the American Dream, not Martin
Luther King's.
The University should do what it
thinks is in the best interest of its
students. And if educating us to under
stand and appreciate cultural diversity
is not at the forefront of our needs, I
cannot think of something that is.
I imagine a similar sort of feeling
led a student to say during Wednes
day's program of speakers at Kresge
Auditorium that he had been in classes
all day, and this was the first time he
felt he was learning something.
I wrote on how each speaker advo
cated a personal dedication to attaining

justice for all in yesterday's Daily. It
was a very emotional time for me at
least — although I suspect for many
others in attendance — one that made
me yearn to lose my spectator status
and fully join in the ceremony.
As I went to work at 10:30 p.m., I
recognized that I had little hope of
capturing the sheer power of each of
the speakers. In fact, I could hardly
include the bare minimum of their
speeches under deadline doom.
There are so many things that they
said that I had to leave unsaid, and so
I just thought I'd bridge that gap:
Pedro Noguera, a UC-Berkeley lec
turer in Afro-American Studies, pointed
out that King's legacy included both
non-violence and active resistance, that
the divisions between his philosophy
and Malcolm X's are often superficial.
He said, "King's been made into a
saint, and they sanitized him so we
don't know him anymore."
By contrast, many of the problems of
the 1980s have also been glossed over.
Just as King's strenuous objections to

parts of the status quo have often been
ignored, so too have many of the
difficulties that he foresaw.
Terms like AIDS, homelessness and
crack reflect some of the new perils
facing Americans that had never previ
ously existed, Noguera said.
Attallah Shabazz, Malcolm X's
daughter, said that we should thank
our parents for all that they've done to
smooth our way: "I know communica
tion is rough in families, but Hallmark
will do."
How about a slightly convoluted
article in The Daily? Thank you, Mom,
Dad, Pops and Grammy. Thanks Cece,
Vic, Tom, Rico and Mario. Without you
all, I don't know what I'd be doing
now. I love you.

I wrote on how each speaker advo
cated a personal dedication to attaining

justice for all in yesterday's Daily. It
was a very emotional time for me at
least — although I suspect for many
others in attendance — one that made
me yearn to lose my spectator status
and fully join in the ceremony.
As I went to work at 10:30 p.m., I
recognized that I had little hope of
capturing the sheer power of each of
the speakers. In fact, I could hardly
include the bare minimum of their
speeches under deadline doom.
There are so many things that they
said that I had to leave unsaid, and so
I just thought I'd bridge that gap:
Pedro Noguera, a UC-Berkeley lec
turer in Afro-American Studies, pointed
out that King's legacy included both
non-violence and active resistance, that
the divisions between his philosophy
and Malcolm X's are often superficial.
He said, "King's been made into a
saint, and they sanitized him so we
don't know him anymore."
By contrast, many of the problems of
the 1980s have also been glossed over.
Just as King's strenuous objections to

parts of the status quo have often been
ignored, so too have many of the
difficulties that he foresaw.
Terms like AIDS, homelessness and
crack reflect some of the new perils
facing Americans that had never previ
ously existed, Noguera said.
Attallah Shabazz, Malcolm X's
daughter, said that we should thank
our parents for all that they've done to
smooth our way: "I know communica
tion is rough in families, but Hallmark
will do."
How about a slightly convoluted
article in The Daily? Thank you, Mom,
Dad, Pops and Grammy. Thanks Cece,
Vic, Tom, Rico and Mario. Without you
all, I don't know what I'd be doing
now. I love you.

DURING THIS WEEK, I've atten
ded two celebrations of Martin
Luther King Jr. and his legacy,
covering both for The Daily as a
reporter. I think, though, that these
were two of those rare times when I
gained as much from being at the
events as writing about them.
I planned to observe the official
holiday by reporting on a parade at
Escondido Village, expecting to hear
speeches from a variety of Stanford
students. To my surprise, the proces
sion was composed primarily of
elementary schoolers from the Escon
dido community.
Although The Daily would probably
just run a photograph of the event
instead of a story, I wanted to talk to
some of the youngsters to see what
they had to say about King.
When asked about what King meant,
one 7-year-old boy said, "He helped
black people be like white people. It
didn't matter that they were black."
Another child piped in, "Like you!"
She was quickly reprimanded by a

nearby adult, who then apologized for
her. What for, I thought. It'll be a long
time before anyone's going to make me
ashamed of being black.
The thing she really needed to
apologize for was the boy's generalized
description of King's work.
While it's true that many black
people now share the prosperity of this
country, many of us do not. On the
whole, African-Americans cannot say
we have attained economic parity in
this society.
And even if we could, blacks
wouldn't be "like white people." Most
Stanford students have been exposed to
some of the cultural differences be
tween the two groups, so there's little
point in trying to rehash them here.
The bright spot is that today's kids
are learning about King and others
who led the civil rights movement
earlier than before. Even if they start
off with misguided generalizations, they
are likely to find their way to the
truth.
The down side is that manv Stan-

ford students probably marked the
holiday with ski trips and movie runs.
At a time when a Stanford junior
can tell me in all earnestness that
Ronald Reagan was the greatest civil
rights leader of the 20th century, the
need for an ethnic studies requirement
seems greater than ever.
Forget whatever The Wall Street
Journal has to say in its editorial
pages. It fancies itself to be the diary
of the American Dream, not Martin
Luther King's.
The University should do what it
thinks is in the best interest of its
students. And if educating us to under
stand and appreciate cultural diversity
is not at the forefront of our needs, I
cannot think of something that is.
I imagine a similar sort of feeling
led a student to say during Wednes
day's program of speakers at Kresge
Auditorium that he had been in classes
all day, and this was the first time he
felt he was learning something.
