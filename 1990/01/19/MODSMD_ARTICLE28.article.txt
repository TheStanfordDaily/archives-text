# Stealing street signs: a common crime
## Students' efforts at room decor can give police headaches 
### Eric Lassen 
Looking for that special some
thing to bring a bit of character
to the walls of your in-every-way
average-looking Wilbur/Stern
dorm room? Perhaps a little flash
of reflective green would do the
trick? Much to the dismay of local
authorities, the snatching of
street signs has become an estab
lished Stanford prank.
One student recalls his own
mission one late night last spring.
"I had spotted a sign with my
name on it and decided that I
simply must have it. We got a few
people together and set out with
a hammer to claim my prize. After
that first triumph, though, every
one caught the fever. That's when
it got ugly. The next thing I knew
we had bought a map and were
pouring over the index looking for
last names, circling our various
destinations."
Standard street signs are not
the only gimmick pursued by the
Stanford community, according to
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of the Stan
ford Police Department. During
graduation last spring, many of
the red oak leaf banners hanging
along Palm Drive mysteriously
disappeared. Past fraternity in
itiations have included such
games as "License Plate
Scavenger Hunt." And then
there's Big Game, complete with
bear claws and spray paint. "But
of course Stanford students would
never do anything like that,"
Neimeyer said.

View Police Department noted

times each year, but is eventually

was unavailable for comment.
In Mountain View, home to
Stanford Avenue, stealing street

signs is officially regarded as petty
theft (a single sign costs between
$50 and $100) and is treated as
a prank. However, though sign
stealing is a "low priority crime,"
students caught with a number
of signs could be charged with a
felony or possession of stolen
property.
Powell also cited fraternity in
itiations as a source of mischief.
However, Stanford fraternities
deny participation in any illegal
activities. "Stealing is not a part
of anything that goes on here,"
said one Sigma Chi fraternity
member.
An underreported crime at
Stanford, sign stealing is usually
a minor nuisance for the police
department. While only one sign
has been officially reported as
stolen this year, scores more will
disappear. "People notice that
they're gone and just order a new
one through facilities. It doesn't
usually go through the police at
all," Neimeyer said.
The main burden of the prob
lem, then, falls on Herb Fong and
the Department of Operations and
Maintenance. According to Fong,
approximately 50 signs per year
will be taken at a cost of $25 to
$40 for the signs themselves, with
a total replacement charge of
around $70. Many more losses
will go unreported, as they are
replaced only following official
complaints.
Neimeyer did note that many
of the signs seen around the
campus dorm rooms come from
elsewhere. They are collected
from roadside ditches as they fall
off and require replacement, and
possession of these signs is
usually ignored. Thus, the police
aren't usually concerned about
signs that have not been specifi
cally reported as stolen. The Band
Shak, for example, has chosen the
street sign theme for its interior
design pattern.
If students are caught in the
act, though, the procedure that

follows can be rough. Neimeyer
said that police will first confis
cate the stolen property and take
down names. Students may be ar
rested and charged with a mis
demeanor, in which case they will
be sent straight to the district at
torney. At this point, the "prank"
may carry a penalty of restitution
plus 40 hours of community serv

ice and a six month probation. In
addition, defacing or stealing traf
fic signs may bring a vehicle code
violation with a severe penalty of
its own.
Sign stealing, though an adven
ture for those more eccentric Stan
ford decorators, is "basically a real
pain" for Capt. Neimeyer and the
Stanford Police Department.

Powell also cited fraternity in
itiations as a source of mischief.
However, Stanford fraternities
deny participation in any illegal
activities. "Stealing is not a part
of anything that goes on here,"
said one Sigma Chi fraternity
member.
An underreported crime at
Stanford, sign stealing is usually
a minor nuisance for the police
department. While only one sign
has been officially reported as
stolen this year, scores more will
disappear. "People notice that
they're gone and just order a new
one through facilities. It doesn't
usually go through the police at
all," Neimeyer said.
The main burden of the prob
lem, then, falls on Herb Fong and
the Department of Operations and
Maintenance. According to Fong,
approximately 50 signs per year
will be taken at a cost of $25 to
$40 for the signs themselves, with
a total replacement charge of
around $70. Many more losses
will go unreported, as they are
replaced only following official
complaints.
Neimeyer did note that many
of the signs seen around the
campus dorm rooms come from
elsewhere. They are collected
from roadside ditches as they fall
off and require replacement, and
possession of these signs is
usually ignored. Thus, the police
aren't usually concerned about
signs that have not been specifi
cally reported as stolen. The Band
Shak, for example, has chosen the
street sign theme for its interior
design pattern.
If students are caught in the
act, though, the procedure that

follows can be rough. Neimeyer
said that police will first confis
cate the stolen property and take
down names. Students may be ar
rested and charged with a mis
demeanor, in which case they will
be sent straight to the district at
torney. At this point, the "prank"
may carry a penalty of restitution
plus 40 hours of community serv

ice and a six month probation. In
addition, defacing or stealing traf
fic signs may bring a vehicle code
violation with a severe penalty of
its own.
Sign stealing, though an adven
ture for those more eccentric Stan
ford decorators, is "basically a real
pain" for Capt. Neimeyer and the
Stanford Police Department.
