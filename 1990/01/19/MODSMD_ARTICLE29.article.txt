"The Sierra Club's goal is to
preserve, protect and enjoy the
outdoors, so we encourage in
volvement on any level," says
Kevin Ascher, founder and
chair of the newly formed Stan
ford Sierra Club.
According to Ascher, involve
ment ranges from pushing en
viromental protection legisla
tion in Sacramento to writing
for the newsletter to organizing
outing groups to places such
as Yosemite National Park.
Sierra Club started last fall
with an organizational meeting
to establish a membership and
slide show for the end of the
quarter. The slide show, which
was given by an Alaskan envi
ronmental group, focused on
the detrimental effects of pro
posed oil exploration in the
Arctic National Wildlife Ref
uge.
Conservation chair Mike
Fisher said that the club plans
to complement other campus
groups. However, because of
Sierra Club's national affilia
tion, they have the added sup
port of other Sierra Club
groups in the area. Ascher said
he felt that this affiliation was
a distinguishing facet of the
group. "We're not just another
student group, but an extension
of the national Sierra Club. If
we form a policy, then that's
official policy for over 500,000
members," said Ascher.
Members feel that another
unique aspect of the Stanford
Sierra Club is their use of fac
ulty resources. "The faculty
members do research and have
knowledge concerning wise en
vironmental policies," ex
plained Ascher, "so we just take

Ascher and Steve McCor
mick, another member, were
able to use the research of
Winslow Briggs, a member of
the Carnegie Institute, to get
a plan approved regarding
cattle-grazing in the Mount
Diablo State Park foothills.
The club is forming a Faculty
Advisory Board with faculty
from several departments in or
der to establish mutual service
ties and to create awareness
that Sierra Club is working on
environmental issues.
Sierra Club is already in
volved in several environmental
programs. Members are work
ing with the University to ex
pand the Outdoor Education
Program. They are particularly
interested in the popular Wil
derness Skills class that will
lose Athletic Department fund
ing next quarter.
Regarding state-wide issues,
the club wants to help address
traffic congestion problems
around Yosemite, where many
Stanford students go for
getaways, and educate the
public on the Clean Air and
Rail Transportaion Act of 1990.
The legislation aims to reduce
mass transit congestion, car
bon dioxide release and noise.
