# Remembrances of the dreamer
## Stanford students, faculty reflect on King's legacy 
### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
As Martin Luther King Jr. Com
memorative Week comes to a close,
Stanford students and faculty members
have paused to re-evaluate both the
dreamer and the dream.
"I think what I am impressed by the
most is how very American he is — an
ordinary member of the middle class,
in many ways quite conservative," said
Sylvia Wynter, director of the African
and Afro-American Studies Program.
Like Malcolm X, King was a master
wordsmith whose talent enabled him to
inspire blacks and others to come to
gether as a group, she said.
"We are very lucky to be the in
heritors of both," she said.
King revived original Christianity by
synthesizing contemporary Christian
theology and elements of African cul
ture, Wynter said. His work made it

possible to reforge the predominately
white America of the 19th century into
a true civilization, she added.
"We have tried, but we have failed to
make the breakthrough with academic
life that he made with theological life,"
she said. "We have not yet mounted a
challenge to our present system of
knowledge."
That task will be of utmost impor
tance as we move toward a post
industrial society, Wynter added.
Racial barriers were feasible only in
a manufacturing age, where a large per
centage of the populace could remain
undereducated and maltreated without
much effect on overall productivity.
With the rise of technology, the
United States must utilize all of its
human resources or risk becoming a
Third World country, Wynter said.
Raised in Virginia, Assoc. Prof, of His
tory Kennell Jackson was very aware
of the civil rights leader and his work.

"King inserted himself into my child
hood as a folk hero," he said.
As he grew older, Jackson began to
focus on King's rhetoric. Like Wynter,
Jackson found King's speechmaking im
pressive. His words would literally cause
Jackson to shiver, he said.
"When we were in college, we had
this image of this heroic figure who was
opening up the future," Jackson said.
"When he was stabbed [in an unsuc
cessful attempt on his life], we were so
saddened."
His life and death proved that democ
racy is never guaranteed, but must con
stantly be expanded, Jackson added.
In his native North Carolina, Keith
Archuleta, the director of the Black
Community Services Center, was also
aware of King.
"I remember seeing my aunt crying
[after hearing one of King's speeches].
and as a young boy, realizing what
a powerful movement King repre
sented," he said.
Archuleta was struck by King's
philosophy of non-violence in his
attempt to confront one of the
most violent societies.
But the only way Archuleta and
those around him knew of King
was through the national media
and word of mouth.
"There was somewhat of a press
blackout .. . because he repre
sented a challenge to the status
quo at the time," Archuleta said.
"And they certainly weren't teach
ing it in the schools."
The very fact that the story
was once hidden is why the King
celebration cannot be taken for
granted, Archuleta said.
"This is one of the few times
that we have an American holiday
that's not all show, that's
celebratory and somber," Archu
leta said. "The holiday has always
been a place where all can relate
to struggle for justice."
Some felt that more reflection
on King's life is necessary.
"A lot of people have King all
wrong," said Aimee Allison, a
member of the Council of Presi
dents. "They want us to look at
what King talked about in 1963
without including what he talked
about in 1968."
Allison went to Alabama as a
freshman to register voters. There
she received realistic accounts of
King's life from key players in the
civil rights movement.

self into my child
hood as a folk
hero.'

Toward the end of his life, King
saw economic equality as a central
goal, she said.
The trip helped form her polit
ical beliefs and aspirations, Alli
son said. It also inspired her to
run for the COP.
Students have always been at
the vanguard of change, she said,
noting that King was a 26-year
old student when he led the Mont
gomery bus boycott.
The work of Martin Luther
King is paralleled by the activities
of several on-campus groups, all
of which should be supported, Al
lison added.
One such group is the Stanford
Black Student Union, BSU chair
Calvin Martin suggested in his
introduction to "Justice and
Hope," a recently published his
tory of the BSU.
"Martin Luther King and the
BSU go back a long ways," Martin
said.
In one of its first actions as a
group, the BSU made 10 demands
to the University, prompted by
King's assassination.
"Just as those from the previ
ous generation opened the doors
for us, so too must we leave Stan
ford a better place for those who
will come after us," Martin said.

Others feel that the legacy of
King may be overrated.
"There are certainly other
American leaders in the past who
have accomplished as much as or
more than King who don't have
their own holiday," said Keith
Rabois, president of the Stanford
College Republicans.
"Reagan is the greatest cham
pion of civil rights in the 20th
century," he said.
But King's most prominent con
tributions were his emphasis on
the principle of color-blindness in
society and his support of the
Western tradition, Rabois added.
"A lot of what would be char
acterized as left-wing people today
use his words in a disingenuous
way to support positions quite
contrary to what he so eloquently
argued for," he said, citing "race
conscious admissions" as an ex
ample.
But affirmative action pro
grams are integral to providing
the equal opportunity that King
envisioned, said Cecilia Burciaga,
the University's affirmative ac
tion officer.
Even though the 1960s have
been portrayed as "the Kings, the
Kennedys, the god-awfulness of a
George Wallace," the true conflict
happened between individuals,
Burciaga said.
Across the country, smaller
battles were fought along racial
lines. Many were won, but many
were not, she said.
"King personified all of that for
us," Burciaga noted. "The prob
lem was that we left all of that
as a dream and never got beyond
it."

ous generation opened the doors
for us, so too must we leave Stan
ford a better place for those who
will come after us," Martin said.

Others feel that the legacy of
King may be overrated.
"There are certainly other
American leaders in the past who
have accomplished as much as or
more than King who don't have
their own holiday," said Keith
Rabois, president of the Stanford
College Republicans.
"Reagan is the greatest cham
pion of civil rights in the 20th
century," he said.
But King's most prominent con
tributions were his emphasis on
the principle of color-blindness in
society and his support of the
Western tradition, Rabois added.
"A lot of what would be char
acterized as left-wing people today
use his words in a disingenuous
way to support positions quite
contrary to what he so eloquently
argued for," he said, citing "race
conscious admissions" as an ex
ample.
But affirmative action pro
grams are integral to providing
the equal opportunity that King
envisioned, said Cecilia Burciaga,
the University's affirmative ac
tion officer.
Even though the 1960s have
been portrayed as "the Kings, the
Kennedys, the god-awfulness of a
George Wallace," the true conflict
happened between individuals,
Burciaga said.
Across the country, smaller
battles were fought along racial
lines. Many were won, but many
were not, she said.
"King personified all of that for
us," Burciaga noted. "The prob
lem was that we left all of that
as a dream and never got beyond
it."
As Martin Luther King Jr. Com
memorative Week comes to a close,
Stanford students and faculty members
have paused to re-evaluate both the
dreamer and the dream.
"I think what I am impressed by the
most is how very American he is — an
ordinary member of the middle class,
in many ways quite conservative," said
Sylvia Wynter, director of the African
and Afro-American Studies Program.
Like Malcolm X, King was a master
wordsmith whose talent enabled him to
inspire blacks and others to come to
gether as a group, she said.
"We are very lucky to be the in
heritors of both," she said.
King revived original Christianity by
synthesizing contemporary Christian
theology and elements of African cul
ture, Wynter said. His work made it

possible to reforge the predominately
white America of the 19th century into
a true civilization, she added.
"We have tried, but we have failed to
make the breakthrough with academic
life that he made with theological life,"
she said. "We have not yet mounted a
challenge to our present system of
knowledge."
That task will be of utmost impor
tance as we move toward a post
industrial society, Wynter added.
Racial barriers were feasible only in
a manufacturing age, where a large per
centage of the populace could remain
undereducated and maltreated without
much effect on overall productivity.
With the rise of technology, the
United States must utilize all of its
human resources or risk becoming a
Third World country, Wynter said.
Raised in Virginia, Assoc. Prof, of His
tory Kennell Jackson was very aware
of the civil rights leader and his work.

"King inserted himself into my child
hood as a folk hero," he said.
As he grew older, Jackson began to
focus on King's rhetoric. Like Wynter,
Jackson found King's speechmaking im
pressive. His words would literally cause
Jackson to shiver, he said.
"When we were in college, we had
this image of this heroic figure who was
opening up the future," Jackson said.
"When he was stabbed [in an unsuc
cessful attempt on his life], we were so
saddened."
His life and death proved that democ
racy is never guaranteed, but must con
stantly be expanded, Jackson added.
In his native North Carolina, Keith
Archuleta, the director of the Black
Community Services Center, was also
aware of King.
"I remember seeing my aunt crying
[after hearing one of King's speeches].
and as a young boy, realizing what
a powerful movement King repre
sented," he said.
Archuleta was struck by King's
philosophy of non-violence in his
attempt to confront one of the
most violent societies.
But the only way Archuleta and
those around him knew of King
was through the national media
and word of mouth.
"There was somewhat of a press
blackout .. . because he repre
sented a challenge to the status
quo at the time," Archuleta said.
"And they certainly weren't teach
ing it in the schools."
The very fact that the story
was once hidden is why the King
celebration cannot be taken for
granted, Archuleta said.
"This is one of the few times
that we have an American holiday
that's not all show, that's
celebratory and somber," Archu
leta said. "The holiday has always
been a place where all can relate
to struggle for justice."
Some felt that more reflection
on King's life is necessary.
"A lot of people have King all
wrong," said Aimee Allison, a
member of the Council of Presi
dents. "They want us to look at
what King talked about in 1963
without including what he talked
about in 1968."
Allison went to Alabama as a
freshman to register voters. There
she received realistic accounts of
King's life from key players in the
civil rights movement.

Toward the end of his life, King
saw economic equality as a central
goal, she said.
The trip helped form her polit
ical beliefs and aspirations, Alli
son said. It also inspired her to
run for the COP.
Students have always been at
the vanguard of change, she said,
noting that King was a 26-year
old student when he led the Mont
gomery bus boycott.
The work of Martin Luther
King is paralleled by the activities
of several on-campus groups, all
of which should be supported, Al
lison added.
One such group is the Stanford
Black Student Union, BSU chair
Calvin Martin suggested in his
introduction to "Justice and
Hope," a recently published his
tory of the BSU.
"Martin Luther King and the
BSU go back a long ways," Martin
said.
In one of its first actions as a
group, the BSU made 10 demands
to the University, prompted by
King's assassination.
"Just as those from the previ
ous generation opened the doors
for us, so too must we leave Stan
ford a better place for those who
will come after us," Martin said.
