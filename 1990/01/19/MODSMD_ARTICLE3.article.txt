# Remembrances of the dreamer
## Stanford students, faculty reflect on King's legacy 
### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
As Martin Luther King Jr. Com
memorative Week comes to a close,
Stanford students and faculty members
have paused to re-evaluate both the
dreamer and the dream.
"I think what I am impressed by the
most is how very American he is â€” an
ordinary member of the middle class,
in many ways quite conservative," said
Sylvia Wynter, director of the African
and Afro-American Studies Program.
Like Malcolm X, King was a master
wordsmith whose talent enabled him to
inspire blacks and others to come to
gether as a group, she said.
"We are very lucky to be the in
heritors of both," she said.
King revived original Christianity by
synthesizing contemporary Christian
theology and elements of African cul
ture, Wynter said. His work made it

possible to reforge the predominately
white America of the 19th century into
a true civilization, she added.
"We have tried, but we have failed to
make the breakthrough with academic
life that he made with theological life,"
she said. "We have not yet mounted a
challenge to our present system of
knowledge."
That task will be of utmost impor
tance as we move toward a post
industrial society, Wynter added.
Racial barriers were feasible only in
a manufacturing age, where a large per
centage of the populace could remain
undereducated and maltreated without
much effect on overall productivity.
With the rise of technology, the
United States must utilize all of its
human resources or risk becoming a
Third World country, Wynter said.
Raised in Virginia, Assoc. Prof, of His
tory Kennell Jackson was very aware
of the civil rights leader and his work.

"King inserted himself into my child
hood as a folk hero," he said.
As he grew older, Jackson began to
focus on King's rhetoric. Like Wynter,
Jackson found King's speechmaking im
pressive. His words would literally cause
Jackson to shiver, he said.
"When we were in college, we had
this image of this heroic figure who was
opening up the future," Jackson said.
"When he was stabbed [in an unsuc
cessful attempt on his life], we were so
saddened."
His life and death proved that democ
racy is never guaranteed, but must con
stantly be expanded, Jackson added.
In his native North Carolina, Keith
Archuleta, the director of the Black
Community Services Center, was also
aware of King.
"I remember seeing my aunt crying
[after hearing one of King's speeches].
