College basketball is back on
the Farm.
It never really left, but little
was expected of the Cardinal after
six key players graduated from a
26-7 team. A fifth-place finish in
the Pacific 10 Conference seemed
possible, but perhaps a reach.

Stanford 87
UCLA 79

But that was before the season.
After last night, the names and
faces may be different, but noth
ing else is.
In front of a rollicking sellout
crowd and a national ESPN au
dience, Stanford flat-out beat the
No. 16 team in the nation, the
UCLA Bruins, by an 87-79 tally.
The Cardinal did it inside, did
it outside, did it with hustle and
did it with the help of 7,500
screaming maniacs.
Stanford improves to 11-3 over
all and to 3-2 in the Pac-10, going

into a 3 p.m. home game with
USC tomorrow. The Bruins fall
to 11-3 overall, 5-1 in the league.
"It's a great win," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"It's a home win against an out
standing basketball team. ... We
didn't know if we could play with
the best teams in the league, but
this proves we can.
"With this team, there were
some underlying doubts that we
couldn't beat anyone. I know I
had those thoughts. But we're just
better than that. We had some
tough times out there, but we
didn't give in."
The Bruins' outstanding senior
forward, Trevor Wilson, had 31
points and 10 rebounds to keep
the Bruins in the game but also
sealed their defeat. With the Car
dinal clinging to a 71-68 lead, Wil
son hit a 360-degree bank shot
from about six feet to cut it to
one. He then stole the ball from
Kenny Ammann and went in for
a layup, but missed it.
John Patrick, who tried to slow
Wilson down, came away with the
rebound. About 10 seconds later,


Sophomore Adam Keefe works inside for two of his hard-earned 23 points. Stanford downed No. 16
UCLA last night, 87-79.
