## Thanks Trevor; technical foul, free throws blast UCLA Ammann explodes for 21 points as hoops fever returns to Maples 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
College basketball is back on
the Farm.
It never really left, but little
was expected of the Cardinal after
six key players graduated from a
26-7 team. A fifth-place finish in
the Pacific 10 Conference seemed
possible, but perhaps a reach.

Stanford 87
UCLA 79

But that was before the season.
After last night, the names and
faces may be different, but noth
ing else is.
In front of a rollicking sellout
crowd and a national ESPN au
dience, Stanford flat-out beat the
No. 16 team in the nation, the
UCLA Bruins, by an 87-79 tally.
The Cardinal did it inside, did
it outside, did it with hustle and
did it with the help of 7,500
screaming maniacs.
Stanford improves to 11-3 over
all and to 3-2 in the Pac-10, going

into a 3 p.m. home game with
USC tomorrow. The Bruins fall
to 11-3 overall, 5-1 in the league.
"It's a great win," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"It's a home win against an out
standing basketball team. ... We
didn't know if we could play with
the best teams in the league, but
this proves we can.
"With this team, there were
some underlying doubts that we
couldn't beat anyone. I know I
had those thoughts. But we're just
better than that. We had some
tough times out there, but we
didn't give in."
The Bruins' outstanding senior
forward, Trevor Wilson, had 31
points and 10 rebounds to keep
the Bruins in the game but also
sealed their defeat. With the Car
dinal clinging to a 71-68 lead, Wil
son hit a 360-degree bank shot
from about six feet to cut it to
one. He then stole the ball from
Kenny Ammann and went in for
a layup, but missed it.
John Patrick, who tried to slow
Wilson down, came away with the
rebound. About 10 seconds later,


Sophomore Adam Keefe works inside for two of his hard-earned 23 points. Stanford downed No. 16
UCLA last night, 87-79.
Wilson tried to strip Patrick for another
steal but was whistled for a foul.
Wilson, known for his emotion as much
as his talent, then got called for a technical
as well. With 2:56 remaining, Patrick made
both ends of the one-and-one, Ammann
made both technical shots and Patrick
made a pull-up baseline jumper that Todd
Lichti would have been proud of. Counting
the missed layup, it was an eight-point
swing that gave the Cardinal the game.
A Cardinal turnover and three Mitchell
Butler free throws cut it to four but Patrick
made 3 of 4 free throws, and Deshon Win
gate and Andrew Vlahov each drained a
pair to close out the win.
Bruin Coach Jim Harrick was irate about
the technical after the game but did give
Stanford credit. "The kid grabbed [Wil
son's] arm and he missed the layup," Har
rick said. "That was a real emotional part
of the game. . . . The first rule of officiating
is you let kids decide the game, not the
officials. You just don't do that. You've got
to be kidding. That's embarassing. That's
embarassing for the conference to do that
on national TV.
"But the foul and me talking about it
takes away from Stanford's effort. They
played a great game."

Patrick disagreed with Harrick, however.
"I didn't have a whole lot to do with that.
He missed the layup," Patrick said.
So did you touch him, John? "No. Not
when he shot it."
"That wasn't a real Phi Beta Kappa move
by Trevor," Ammann said.
Stanford took a 43-38 halftime lead as
Keefe was dominant, going 5 of 5 from the
floor and 8 of 9 from the line for 18 points.
But Wilson had 11 and Don Mac Lean had
13 for the Bruins. Stanford also made 10
turnovers in the first half.
The Bruins, who slowed Stanford after
changing from a man-to-man to a zone
defense with 3:53 left, came out and played
almost the entire game in a diamond and
one. One Bruin was assigned to sit on
Keefe the whole way, three other players
basically clogged the baseline, and Darrick
Martin ran back and forth between Am
mann and Patrick on the outside.
They held Keefe to only five points in
the second half, but Ammann finished with
a career-high 21 and Patrick had 18, tying
his career high. Stanford also made only
four turnovers in the second half and hit
32 of 37 free throws (86.5 percent) for the
game.
"They were just giving us shots and I
missed two or three in a row and John
missed a couple," Ammann said. "It's ag
gravating to miss those when you're that
wide open. But I feel like if I miss a couple,
then I'll make a couple."

the Farm.
It never really left, but little
was expected of the Cardinal after
six key players graduated from a
26-7 team. A fifth-place finish in
the Pacific 10 Conference seemed
possible, but perhaps a reach.

Stanford 87
UCLA 79

But that was before the season.
After last night, the names and
faces may be different, but noth
ing else is.
In front of a rollicking sellout
crowd and a national ESPN au
dience, Stanford flat-out beat the
No. 16 team in the nation, the
UCLA Bruins, by an 87-79 tally.
The Cardinal did it inside, did
it outside, did it with hustle and
did it with the help of 7,500
screaming maniacs.
Stanford improves to 11-3 over
all and to 3-2 in the Pac-10, going

into a 3 p.m. home game with
USC tomorrow. The Bruins fall
to 11-3 overall, 5-1 in the league.
"It's a great win," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"It's a home win against an out
standing basketball team. ... We
didn't know if we could play with
the best teams in the league, but
this proves we can.
"With this team, there were
some underlying doubts that we
couldn't beat anyone. I know I
had those thoughts. But we're just
better than that. We had some
tough times out there, but we
didn't give in."
The Bruins' outstanding senior
forward, Trevor Wilson, had 31
points and 10 rebounds to keep
the Bruins in the game but also
sealed their defeat. With the Car
dinal clinging to a 71-68 lead, Wil
son hit a 360-degree bank shot
from about six feet to cut it to
one. He then stole the ball from
Kenny Ammann and went in for
a layup, but missed it.
John Patrick, who tried to slow
Wilson down, came away with the
rebound. About 10 seconds later,


Sophomore Adam Keefe works inside for two of his hard-earned 23 points. Stanford downed No. 16
UCLA last night, 87-79.
Wilson tried to strip Patrick for another
steal but was whistled for a foul.
Wilson, known for his emotion as much
as his talent, then got called for a technical
as well. With 2:56 remaining, Patrick made
both ends of the one-and-one, Ammann
made both technical shots and Patrick
made a pull-up baseline jumper that Todd
Lichti would have been proud of. Counting
the missed layup, it was an eight-point
swing that gave the Cardinal the game.
A Cardinal turnover and three Mitchell
Butler free throws cut it to four but Patrick
made 3 of 4 free throws, and Deshon Win
gate and Andrew Vlahov each drained a
pair to close out the win.
Bruin Coach Jim Harrick was irate about
the technical after the game but did give
Stanford credit. "The kid grabbed [Wil
son's] arm and he missed the layup," Har
rick said. "That was a real emotional part
of the game. . . . The first rule of officiating
is you let kids decide the game, not the
officials. You just don't do that. You've got
to be kidding. That's embarassing. That's
embarassing for the conference to do that
on national TV.
"But the foul and me talking about it
takes away from Stanford's effort. They
played a great game."

Patrick disagreed with Harrick, however.
"I didn't have a whole lot to do with that.
He missed the layup," Patrick said.
So did you touch him, John? "No. Not
when he shot it."
"That wasn't a real Phi Beta Kappa move
by Trevor," Ammann said.
Stanford took a 43-38 halftime lead as
Keefe was dominant, going 5 of 5 from the
floor and 8 of 9 from the line for 18 points.
But Wilson had 11 and Don Mac Lean had
13 for the Bruins. Stanford also made 10
turnovers in the first half.
The Bruins, who slowed Stanford after
changing from a man-to-man to a zone
defense with 3:53 left, came out and played
almost the entire game in a diamond and
one. One Bruin was assigned to sit on
Keefe the whole way, three other players
basically clogged the baseline, and Darrick
Martin ran back and forth between Am
mann and Patrick on the outside.
They held Keefe to only five points in
the second half, but Ammann finished with
a career-high 21 and Patrick had 18, tying
his career high. Stanford also made only
four turnovers in the second half and hit
32 of 37 free throws (86.5 percent) for the
game.
"They were just giving us shots and I
missed two or three in a row and John
missed a couple," Ammann said. "It's ag
gravating to miss those when you're that
wide open. But I feel like if I miss a couple,
then I'll make a couple."
