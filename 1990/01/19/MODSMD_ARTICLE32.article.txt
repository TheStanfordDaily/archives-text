# Keefe's presence opens up outside, leads to big upset
## 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
Last night against UCLA, Adam
Keefe started at center for Stan
ford for the first time this season.
And in the second half, UCLA
finally recognized him as the cen
tral figure of the Cardinal's of
fense. By then it was too late.
By that time, Keefe had already
burned the No. 16 Bruins for 18
points on 5-of-5 shooting (8-of-9
from the line), and Stanford was
up 43-38.
After halftime, UCLA Coach
Jim Harrick placed a "diamond
and-one" defense on Keefe. This
scheme called for someone
(usually guard Gerald Madkins)
to deny the ball to Keefe from
the front, as well as for someone
(usually forward Trevor Wilson)
to deny him the ball from the
back.
The strategy worked — almost.
Keefe couldn't get the ball. His
only field goal in the second half
came on an offensive rebound and
put-back. UCLA decided not to
get burned inside.
"It (the diamond and one) was
effective for what it was trying
to do," Keefe said. "It shut me
down.
"But I'd gladly give up my
points inside for what we were
getting outside."
The diamond and one sacrificed
a defender for UCLA outside so
that one man had to jump be
tween Stanford guards John
Patrick and Kenny Amman. They
started hitting after a brief cold
spell, and it was all over.
"It was like target practice for
them," Keefe said.
Basketball analysts frequently
talk about the need to hit the
outside shot to open things up
inside.
By drawing all of the Bruin at
tention to him inside on defense,
Keefe effectively opened up the
outside for the Cardinal guards.
Keefe finished with 23 points
and four rebounds. He shot a per
fect 6-for-6 from the field and
also nailed 11 of 13 free throws.
With that performance, Keefe
raised his field goal percentage in
Pacific 10 Conference games to a
spectacular 79.5 percent.
Seemingly unstoppable inside,
Keefe, only a sophomore, is
making teams compensate con
siderably on defense. Each time
Keefe touches the ball, the oppo
sition has been double teaming
him. Now, they will no doubt
begin employing a box-and-one or
similar zones.
"Being a sophomore, I don't ex
pect (the attention on defense) in
games," Keefe said. "But if it

comes, we can just score more
easily outside."
For a while at the start of the
second half last night, Stanford
wasn't scoring so easily outside.
The team appeared out of rhythm
on offense. Unable to get the ball
inside to a mobbed Keefe, the Car
dinal tried to take what they could
get in the way of midrange and
outside shots.
But the jumpers weren't falling,
and UCLA climbed on top with
some outstanding play from Wil
son and forward Don McLean.
Stanford wasn't having as much
success at stopping the Bruin in
side game.
But the Cardinal finally got it
going on offense, taking advantage
of an open perimeter.
"Kenny and John had to hit

'I'd gladly give up
my points inside
for what we were
getting outside.'
— Adam Keefe

some shots or we were sunk,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said.
As a team, Stanford shot only
.444 from the floor. But the Car
dinal was able to take just enough
advantage of seams in the Bruin
defense created by the offensive
threat of its center of attention,
Adam Keefe, to win the ballgame.
