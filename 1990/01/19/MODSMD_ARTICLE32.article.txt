# Keefe's presence opens up outside, leads to big upset
## 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
Last night against UCLA, Adam
Keefe started at center for Stan
ford for the first time this season.
And in the second half, UCLA
finally recognized him as the cen
tral figure of the Cardinal's of
fense. By then it was too late.
By that time, Keefe had already
burned the No. 16 Bruins for 18
points on 5-of-5 shooting (8-of-9
from the line), and Stanford was
up 43-38.
After halftime, UCLA Coach
Jim Harrick placed a "diamond
and-one" defense on Keefe. This
scheme called for someone
(usually guard Gerald Madkins)
to deny the ball to Keefe from
the front, as well as for someone
(usually forward Trevor Wilson)
to deny him the ball from the
back.
The strategy worked â€” almost.
Keefe couldn't get the ball. His
only field goal in the second half
came on an offensive rebound and
put-back. UCLA decided not to
get burned inside.
"It (the diamond and one) was
effective for what it was trying
to do," Keefe said. "It shut me
down.
"But I'd gladly give up my
points inside for what we were
getting outside."
The diamond and one sacrificed
a defender for UCLA outside so
that one man had to jump be
tween Stanford guards John
Patrick and Kenny Amman. They
started hitting after a brief cold
spell, and it was all over.
"It was like target practice for
them," Keefe said.
Basketball analysts frequently
talk about the need to hit the
outside shot to open things up
inside.
By drawing all of the Bruin at
tention to him inside on defense,
Keefe effectively opened up the
outside for the Cardinal guards.
Keefe finished with 23 points
and four rebounds. He shot a per
fect 6-for-6 from the field and
also nailed 11 of 13 free throws.
