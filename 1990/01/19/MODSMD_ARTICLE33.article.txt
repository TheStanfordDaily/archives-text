### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The last Pacific 10 Conference
team to beat Stanford was no
match for the Cardinal last night
as the No. 2 ranked team cruised
to a 98-80 victory.
Stanford's first-ever win in
Pauley Pavilion and only its sec
ond victory in Los Angeles moved
the squad's record to 14-0, 5-0 in
league play. UCLA fell to 8-6, 3-1.
The Bruins defeated the Cardinal
to close out the 1987-88 season.

With just under 18 minutes
remaining in the game, Stanford
led by just eight points at 55-47.
Jennifer Azzi then passed down
low to Julie Zeilstra who scored
on a layup to make it a double
figure lead.
That hoop keyed a 9-2 run in
which Trisha Stevens, who led the
Cardinal with 29 points hit jump
shots from 10 and 15 feet. Before
the Bruins knew what hit them,
Stanford led 64-49, and the out
come was all but determined.
"Trisha was pretty unstoppable
jnside," Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer said.
The teams traded baskets over
the next four minutes before
UCLA asked for a timeout with
10:23 on the clock. Coach Tara
VanDerveer called a set play off
the break and Stacy Parson hit
Azzi on a back-door cut for an
easy layup. Stanford then led 76-
60.
A minute later, Stanford
switched to a three-guard lineup
for the first time this season. Azzi,
Parson and Soi\ja Henning were
all in the game together. VanDer
veer also subbed in Val Whiting
for Stevens and the freshman
ended notions of a Bruin come
back.
The Whiting show began as she
put back a Cardinal miss to open
the lead to 81-63. Azzi then buried
a three-pointer to give Stanford
a 21-point lead.
Azzi hit another three a couple
of possessions later to make it
87-69 with under four minutes to

play. Whiting scored on Stanford's
next trip with a shot off the glass
to up the lead to 20. She finished
with 14 points in the game.
After UCLA's Nicole Anderson
hit an 18-footer, Whiting again
got the ball in the low post, beat
the defender and scored. On the
defensive end, Whiting grabbed a
rebound and when Stanford next
got set up on offense she knocked
down a 10-footer.
When the Cardinal got the ball
back, it was obvious where it was
going to go. Still, the Bruins could
do nothing as Whiting again
scored in the low post. Stanford
was up 95-71 with two minutes
remaining-
In the first half, it appeared
Stanford might have a tough
game on its hands.
The Bruins' Rehema Stephens
scored two minutes after the
tipoff to put UCLA up 8-2. "UCLA
came out real strong, n VanDer
veer noted, calling them a physi
cal, athletic club. "Like every
team we're playing, they seemed
to be real up for us."
Stephens, who finished with 28,
would go on to score 19 in the
half. The Cardinal, meanwhile,
was led by a Stevens of its own

— Trisha. Stanford's starting cen
ter made 7-of-10 field goal at
tempts in the opening stanza,
including one of her two three
point tries.
Stanford chipped away at
UCLA's early edge eventually
tying the game at 16-16. The
Bruins moved ahead at 19-16
when Katy Steding tied it with a
trey. Stanford took its first lead
quickly thereafter on a fast-break
layup by Azzi, who finished with
19.
VanDerveer said Steding's out
side shooting was critical in forc
ing the Bruins to abandon their
zone defense. "Katy bombed 'em
out of it," she said.
UCLA knotted things again a
couple of minutes later when
Sandra VanEmbricqs scored on a
layup to make it 28-28. After a
trade of baskets, Steding hit an
other three to make it 33-30. The
basket ignited a 21-7 Cardinal run
to make it 51-37.
In the second half, Stephens
ceased to be a factor as Azzi made
her a non-factor. "Jennifer really
picked up her defensive intensity
. . . [and] shut her down," Van-
Derveer said.
