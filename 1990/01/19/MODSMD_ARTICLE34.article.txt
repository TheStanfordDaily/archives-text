# Women's Basketball at USC
## 
### 
TOMORROW — Tipoff 7:30 p.m. in USC's new 2,000 seat Lyon Center
KZSU (90.1 FM) will broadcast the game live
RECORDS — Stanford (14-0, 5-0 in Pac-10 play, ranked No 2 nationally),
USC (3-7, 1-2 enterting last night's game with California)
SERIES — USC leads the overall series with Stanford 13-4, but many of
those wins came in the Cheryl Miller Era Last season, Stanford dominated
in both games scoring an 89-50 win in Los Angeles and a 100-85 win
at Maples Pavilion The Maples game was broadcast nationally on ESPN
TROJAN UPDATE — USC's leading scorer is 6-foot forward Tammy Ham
mond at 13.9 points per game She is followed by 5-11 forward Joni
Easterly at 118 and 5-8 guard Tammy Story at 110 Five Trojans average
over five rebounds, led by 6-3 center Rosalind Hodge at 10 5 Reserves
Molly Wampler (8 1) and Kim Gessig (6 0) |Oin Hammond (6 5) and
Easterly (5.5) in the glass cleaning
CARDINAL UPDATE — In recording its 14th straight win to start the season,
Stanford tied a school record which it should break tomorrow Jennifer
Azzi needs 19 points to move past Louise Smith and into third place
on the all-time Stanford scoring list. Eight of Stanford's 11 players are
shooting 50 percent or better from the field As a team, the Cardinal
leads the conference with a 503 field goal percentage The Cardinal
also tops the conference in scoring (91 8), scoring margin (29.6), rebound
mg margin (8.6), defensive field goal percentage ( 388), assists average
(23.2) and free throw percentage ( 774)
KEYS TO VICTORY — There is no way USC should be able to stay in this
game About the only concern for Stanford is USC's rebounding, but
one of the reasons the Trojans get so many boards is that they only
shoot .356 from the field The Cardinal could get some key experience
for its younger players like Molly Goodenbour and Martha Richards
