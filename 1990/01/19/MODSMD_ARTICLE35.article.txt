Although most of the local
media attention focused on the
swimming recruits arriving in the
women's program, men's Coach
Skip Kenney was busy gathering
up some of his own redoubtable
recruits. One of his most promi
nent catches was freshman free
styler Eric Maurer.
"He's one of those real special
people who has the great combi
nation of talent and the work eth
ic," Kenney said.
Maurer completed his high
school career in an impressive
fashion. After acquiring five state
championships in his four years
of swimming at Loyola Academy,
a college preparatory school in
Winnetka, 111., Eric received the
most points for the United States
Swimming's Academic All-
America Team. With the nation's
top- recruit label hanging from
his neck, he then went on to make
the finals in the 100 and 200 free
style at the U.S. Nationals last
summer. In terms of college, he
was choosing between Michigan
and Stanford.
"I chose Stanford because I
liked the guys on the team more
so than anywhere else," Maurer
said. "The deciding factor was the
quality of of the team atmospere.
We have a really close team which
is good for fast swimming."
Since arriving at Stanford,
Maurer has made similar in

roads. He has recorded the second
fastest Cardinal times in the 50,
100 and 200 freestyles so far this
season, including his 45.44 in the
100, which he posted last weekend
when he returned to the Michigan
campus.

With high school requirements
behind him, Maurer has enjoyed
the opportunity to select from a
variety of interesting classes.
After completing one quarter at
Stanford, Maurer aims to double
either in history and polit

ical science or history and organ
izational behavior.
"I have been surprised how well
you can balance academics and
athletics," Maurer said. "I don't
have to compromise one area for
the other. I don't think that is

'We're the eight-time defending Pac-10
champs. We definitely need to make
that nine.'
â€” Eric Maurer

something that a lot of uni
versities with major athletic pro
grams can say. That makes me
pleased with the decision to come
here."
After moving from the all-male,
Jesuit high school corridors to the
pleasant aroma of the all
freshman halls of Donner, Maurer
has not found adjustment to the
Stanford atmosphere difficult.
"I guess that it is a little dif
ferent from Loyola with the 40
women living in the dorm,"
Maurer said. "But I have a big
sister at home, so it's not that big
of a change."
The 6-foot-8 freshman is
looking forward to the difficult
part of the Cardinal schedule
which is coming up in the next
few weeks. Two weeks from now
the Cardinal will travel to Los
Angeles to take on UCLA and a
strong USC team. After that, in
early March, Maurer will again
travel to Los Angeles for his first
Pacific 10 Championships.
"We're the eight-time defending
Pac-10 champs," Maurer said. "We
definitely need to make that
nine."

Today Maurer will join his
teammates in a dual meet at 1
p.m. against UC-Davis. Since the
Aggies will not present a great
challenge to the Cardinal team,
many swimmers will compete in
events that they do not normally
swim. Maurer will maneuver him
self through the 1000 freestyle,
an event he would not swim in
an important meet.
"This will give us a chance to
build up a little team soirit,"
Maurer said. "It's always fun for
the breaststrokers, for example,
to watch a butterfly guy do their
event and kind of laugh."


Erie Maurer kicks into high gear during the 100 freestyle. Maurer, who last week recorded the second
fastest time n Cardinal history in the 100 freestyle, will look to improve upon the his performance
In today against UC-Davis.
