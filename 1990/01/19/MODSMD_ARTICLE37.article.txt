# Volleyball to host alumni classic
## Fortune, Lauchner return to face No. 1 Cardinal in Burnham 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Scott Fortune is back and will
be playing at Burnham Pavilion
Saturday.
His efforts, however, will not
be in the service of the Stanford
men's volleyball team. Instead, the
Olympic gold medalist returns to
lead a group of prominent Stan
ford alums against the current
varsity squad in the 10th annual
Cardinal Alumni volleyball classic.
The exhibition tournament,
which will be played in a round
robin format, will begin at 2:30

p.m. in Burnham and feature
several split- squad varsity teams
against various groupings of
alumni.
Subsequently, at 4:30 p.m., a
select collection of alumni will
challenge the varsity first team,
undefeated throughout the
preseason and ranked unani
mously as the No. 1 team in the
country.
Among the more noted partic
ipants will be 1985 alum Craig
Lauchner, who received All-
American honors as setter for the
Card and who eventually played
for the national team. 1987 grad

John McDermott, currently an as
sistant coach for Coach Fred
Sturm, and 1988 graduate David
Johnson also will join Fortune in
the alumni ranks.
According to Sturm, the event,
which is free of charge to all spec
tators, is intended to enable cur
rent players to "find out about
the history of the program and
give alums a chance to reunite."
Card notes:
The condition of alternate setter
Ryan O'Hars is still tentative.
Whether he will play this weekend
has not been determined.
