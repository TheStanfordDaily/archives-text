# Gymnasts eye revenge in Seattle
## 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics squad will be looking for
revenge when it competes at the
Husky Classic tonight in Seattle.
Competing along with Stanford
and Washington will be Brigham
Young and Boise State. Although
the gymnasts do not know much
about Washington or BYU, they
know that Boise State spoiled
their season opener last Saturday
in Boise and are hoping to even
the score.
"We're really looking forward
to a rematch with them at a
neutral site," sophomore Nicky
Kobrine said.
This meet will see a few changes
in personnel, but, for the most
part, the lineup will look about
the same as last week.
Like last week, Stanford will
have three entries in the all
around competion — senior Dina
Amoroso, freshman Erin
McCann, and junior Jennifer
Bloom.

Two gymnasts — junior Julie
Dunhill and Kobrine — will be
making their first appearances of
the season. Dunhill will join
McCann, Amoroso, Bloom and
seniors Becky Ashton and Susan
Banta on vault.
Kobrine will make her 1990
debut for the Cardinal in floor
exercise. Also competing in floor
will be Bloom, sophomore Denise
Villars, Amoroso and McCann.
On balance beam, Banta will

replace Becky Ashton and com
pete along with Amoroso, Bloom,
McCann, freshman Danielle
Leone and Villars.
The Stanford squad will be one
person short of the allowed six
competitors on bars while sopho
more Alyssa Solomon rests a sore
back. Banta, McCann, Leone,
Amoroso and Bloom will be the
bar competitors for the Cardinal.
"We will have some new people
and some new skills, but this meet
will be more or less the same as
our last meet," Coach Breck
Greenwood said. "Our main work
this week (in practice) has been
mental preparation on beam."
Given the fact that a large part
of this preparation involves main
taining confidence, the Stanford
gymnasts seem ready to make
noticeable improvement on beam.
"We've really improved since
last week, both in our scores and
in our confidence," Kobrine said.
"It helps us to have last week's
meet under our belt," Bloom
added.
