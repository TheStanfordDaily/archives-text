Though President Bush politely
turned down an invitation to
speak at this weekend's You Can
Make A Difference Conference, or
ganizers doubt that anyone will
be asking, "Where was George?"
With a lineup of about 100
speakers and presenters over the
next three days, conference par
ticipants won't have time to miss
"the education president."
More than 200 volunteers have
cooperated to make this weekend's
conference happen. Starting with
an empty bank account, all of the
funds for the program had to be
raised from on- and off-campus
sources. For nearly 10 months,
students, faculty, and community
members have worked behind the

scenes to make the conference a
reality.
Beginning with a program last
night, visits to schools today, panel
discussions and workshops tomor
row, and concluding with a spir
itual event Sunday morning,
important issues about the future
direction of education in the
United States will be addressed.
Goodwin Liu, one of four co
directors of the conference, has
spent up to 60 hours per week on
planning. Liu, a junior in biology

and enrolled in the School of Ed
ucation honors program, says,
"Education is really under
mphasized in terms of the aca
demic and service opportunities
that are available."
Liu, who has long been involved
in tutoring and teaching pro
grams, feels that "there is a lack
of encouragement for people to
make long-term commitments in
the field of education."
Opinions like this, combined
with frustrations over the lack of
multicultural education, the in
creasing shortage of teachers, and
the widening gaps between the
quality of students' elementary
and secondary school education,
were presented to Catherine Mil
ton, director of the Haas Center
