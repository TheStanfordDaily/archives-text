# Examining education's evolution
## 100 speakers, 200 volunteers slated for weekend conference 
### Lena Slachmuijlder Staff writer 
Though President Bush politely
turned down an invitation to
speak at this weekend's You Can
Make A Difference Conference, or
ganizers doubt that anyone will
be asking, "Where was George?"
With a lineup of about 100
speakers and presenters over the
next three days, conference par
ticipants won't have time to miss
"the education president."
More than 200 volunteers have
cooperated to make this weekend's
conference happen. Starting with
an empty bank account, all of the
funds for the program had to be
raised from on- and off-campus
sources. For nearly 10 months,
students, faculty, and community
members have worked behind the

scenes to make the conference a
reality.
Beginning with a program last
night, visits to schools today, panel
discussions and workshops tomor
row, and concluding with a spir
itual event Sunday morning,
important issues about the future
direction of education in the
United States will be addressed.
Goodwin Liu, one of four co
directors of the conference, has
spent up to 60 hours per week on
planning. Liu, a junior in biology

and enrolled in the School of Ed
ucation honors program, says,
"Education is really under
mphasized in terms of the aca
demic and service opportunities
that are available."
Liu, who has long been involved
in tutoring and teaching pro
grams, feels that "there is a lack
of encouragement for people to
make long-term commitments in
the field of education."
Opinions like this, combined
with frustrations over the lack of
multicultural education, the in
creasing shortage of teachers, and
the widening gaps between the
quality of students' elementary
and secondary school education,
were presented to Catherine Mil
ton, director of the Haas Center

for Public Service, last April. The
idea for a conference focusing on
such problems within education
immediately received wide sup
port from the Stanford commu
nity.
After 18 years of experience in
the field of education, School of
Education doctoral student Pat
McDunough, also a co-director of
the conference, was eager to help
with planning.
Like previous You Can Make A
Difference Conferences, this one
emphasizes the wide variety of
approaches an individual can
adopt in working on an issue. In

choosing the speakers for the
keynote addresses and panel dis
cussion, the organizers of the con
ference kept this in mind.
"We wanted to get local people
who are making a difference in
their community at a grassroots
level," said high school teacher
and education doctoral student
Bruce King, another of the co
directors of the conference.
The involvement of the commu
nity in the conference has been
continual throughout the plan
ning of the conference. Announce
ments of the conference were sent
to every school district in Santa
Clara County. More than 300 com
munity members are already pre
registered for the conference,
according to King.
1988 Stanford graduate Adrian

Chan, who will lead the workshop
titled "The Role of the Media in
Education," will utilize a format
that can later be reproduced in a
classroom as a lesson plan.
Chan, who works for the Stan
ford Program on International
and Cross-Cultural Education, a
high school curriculum-writing
project, will present a 1953
McCarthy-era film of the Soviet
Union as "an analysis of the
various ideologies, metaphors, and
language that create an image of
a culture with which we have no
experience," he said.
"I want people to keep believing
that you really can make a dif
ference," said senior Elizabeth
Barclay, co-chair of the speakers
committee, "and I want to keep
believing in it myself."
