# Grapplers look to humble Humbolt
## Despite injury, Graham hopes to avenge earlier loss to Halket 
### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
When Stanford's Mark Graham
wrestles Saturday, he will not only
take on Mike Halket of Humboldt
State, but he will also have to battle
his own body. More specifically,
Graham sprained his right knee a
week ago in the Aggie Invitational
tournament, and it, has forced to him
to alter his style.
"I'm a little worried about using
the leg ride which originally hurt it,"
Graham said. "A lot of my offense
before had been dependent on uaing
the leg ride."
With the leg ride shelved as an at
tack, Graham plans to rely mainly on
upper-body maneuvers and a more
controlled style of wrestling.
Defensively, Graham will try to keep
Halket away from his legs. "Graham
can't allow his bad leg to be grabbed
and twisted in any direction," Stan
ford Coach Chris Horpel said. "He
has to completely shut down his op-

ponent's lower-body offense."
Graham did exactly that in Wed
nesday night's match against Erick
Arguello of San Francisco State. Ar
guello had difficulty getting to
Graham's legs, and Graham executed
his controlled style of offense with
precision, winning the match 15-0.
"One of the problems with my wres
tling is that I need to tighten up my
style a little," Graham said. "I need

to slow it down and work on some
solid stuff."
His "stuff" will need to be solid this
Saturday as Graham lost a close
match to Halket earlier this season
in the Aggie Invitational. Graham sees
the upcoming meet as an opportunity
to avenge the earlier defeat in which
he wrestled iryured.
"I'm looking for another chance. I
think I can do a lot more against him
than I did the last time," Graham said.
The other key matchups of the eve
ning will be in the heavyweight and
134-pound weight divisions. Dave
Sacks (134 lbs.) will compete against
Humboldt's Mike Puzz. The two have
contrasting styles. A high scoring
match will be to Sacks' advantage,
whereas a low scoring battle will favor
Puzz.
In the heavyweight division, Horpel
will send either Trent Smith or Scott
Palmbush against the Lumberjacks'
Luke Par ham. Parham will be favored
over either of the two.
