# Kraemer enjoys swimming with the best; Card preps for USC, UCLA
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Swimming at Stanford can be
tough on one's ego.
Following a fine freshman
season, Karen Kraemer capped off
last year by placing in two events
at last year's NCAA Champion
ships. In her best event, the 400-
yard individual medley, she placed
fifth. After that type of freshman
season, a swimmer would nor
mally expect to come back with
"star" status and high expecta
tions for her sophomore year.
Kraemer, however, comes back
as the Cardinal's third-best 400
IMer.
Such is life when two of your
teammates are the defending
NCAA champ and the Olympic
gold medalist.
So don't you find that frustrat
ing, Karen?
"I don't at all," she said. "I feel
like I gain so much swimming
with people who are better than
w
me.
The top-ranked Cardinal swim
team visits USC and UCLA today
and tomorrow in an effort to im
prove on a 2-0 record.
Coming out of high school
Kraemer, a Palo Alto native, al
most passed up big-time collegiate
swimming. "When I was little I
always wanted to go here," she
said. "I guess every kid growing
up in Palo Alto wants to go to
Stanford. When I was a teenager,
I wanted to go away from home,
like everyone else.
"The question came down to
Harvard and Stanford. At that
point, everything looked equal ex
cept the swimming at Stanford
was much better, but it was in
my hometown. . . . Basically I
decided I had a lot more in me
swimming-wise. I decided Stan

ford would be the best place to
M
go.
Kraemer also looked forward to
swimming for Stanford Coach
George Haines, perhaps the
sport's most highly-renowned
coach ever. But after she decided
on Stanford in April, Haines an
nounced his retirement, effective
that August.
Kraemer said she had some sec
ond thoughts about her decision,
but didn't act on them. Stanford
then hired Richard Quick, the
1988 Olympic coach and the coach
of the last five NCAA team cham
pions at Texas.
"When I found out Richard took
the job, I was really excited, even
though I really didn't know who
he was," Kraemer said. "I'm glad
I didn't know [Haines] was retir
ing before I came because I might
have gone to Harvard had I
known.
"I'm happy I made this choice,
definitely. . . . My friends who
went to Ivy schools are all jealous
when they come to visit — the
ones who tried to convince me to
go away to school."
Being a top swimmer hasn't al
ways been Kraemer's goal. "When
I was young, I played about five
sports," she said. "I loved soccer.
I think I decided mainly because
swimming had more of a social
support. All my friends were
there. In other sports you were
on different teams every year but
with swimming you always com
pete for the same club team.
"I was the worst goof-off when
I was little. I used to cut work
outs, then I went but goofed off,
then I started getting more and
more serious. Actually, I'm really
happy that I did it that way. I
see a lot of people I competed
against when I was 10 burnt out
now."

In addition to her attitude
toward swimming, the events she
swims have also undergone mayor
changes. "I started off a back
straker," she said. "Then I was a
butterflier, then I was a
breaststroker for a while, about
five years."
Last year, Kraemer swam the
200 and 400 IM and the 100 free
style at the NCAA Champion
ships. But this year she has
changed again and will be swim
ming distance freestyle.
"All of last year, I swam the
100 free every time and I was
sitting at 52s (52 seconds) all the
time," she said. "I didn't do so
well in the 100 at NCAAs, and I
thought it would be easier to score
in the mile. Right after the meet
I talked to Mike (Chasson, the
assistant coach) about [changing
from the 100 to the 1650 free
style] and he said 'You can swim
the 500 free instead of the 200
IM.' I wasn't even thinking of
that."

But both changes happened and
she now finds herself swimming
the 500 and 1650 freestyles and
the 400 IM. "I had a lot of trouble
adjusting to distance training,"
she said. "I think I finally got
used to it over Christmas train
ing. ... I like it now, I guess, and
I think they're better events for
me. I think it's better going to a
meet and swimming a brand-new
event and going 'How I can do in
this?' "
So far she's done pretty well.

She won the 1000 freestyle by a
large margin at the dual meet
against sixth-ranked Michigan
last week and finished third in
the 400 IM, behind teammates
Janet Evans (the Olympian) and
Michelle Griglione (the NCAA
champ).
"I swam a real good time at
Michigan and got third (in the
400 IM)," she said. "If we go one
two-three it doesn't matter to me
if I'm third as long as the other
two are my teammates.
"My dream definitely would be
to swim that event with them and
pull off that third place (at
NCAAs). I know they're going to
get the first two."
But Kraemer said she has to
keep her confidence up and not

get complacent. "I just have to
keep remembering that I have to
think about beating them," she
said.
And as far as distance freestyle
goes, Kraemer has no idea what
to expect. "I never in my wildest
dreams thought I'd be swimming
distance freestyle," she said. "Two
of the three events I'm swimming
I've never swum before. To me
it's going to be really exciting be
cause I don't know what I can
do. ... I don't know where I fall.
That's real exciting to me.
"Placewise I want to be in those
finals, and I think I can be there.
I'm not planning to beat the
world-record holder (Evans), but
I'm not doubting I can get sec
ond."
