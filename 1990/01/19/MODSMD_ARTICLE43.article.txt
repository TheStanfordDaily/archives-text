NOTES â€” Stanford (2-0) is com
ing off a resounding dual-meet
victory at 6th-ranked Michigan
last weekend. The Cardinal won
that meet 78-33 as freshman
Janel Jorgensen and senior
Katie Connors won two events
each. Jorgensen won the 200
butterfly by 2.89 seconds and
the 200 individual medley by
3.08 seconds to lead a pair of
Cardinal sweeps. Connors, an
NCAA finalist in all three diving
events last year, won off both
the one- and three-meter
boards, the only two diving
events held in dual meets.
