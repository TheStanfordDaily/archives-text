# Waging war through reaching out
## Armed with education, program director battles AIDS 
### Lara Filson 
The nation may be fighting the
"war on drugs," but according to
Pat Fabiano, Director of the
Health Promotion Program at
Cowell, students on college cam
puses also need to be battling
AIDS.
When Fabiano arrived here last
March, she decided that there was
a "significant missing piece" in
AIDS education at Stanford.
To fill that gap, Fabiano has
founded the Stanford AIDS Out
reach Program, and to help focus
the efforts of students involved
with the issue she offered a class
this fall to educate them about
different aspects of the disease.
"We learned about the biologi
cal, social, legal, economic and ra

cial issues involved," explained
junior Rena Kramer, who took the
class. "It's not a simple problem.
Once I learned the tremendous
impact (AIDSI has, I had to stay
involved," she said.
The more than 40 students who
were in the class all developed
projects focusing on continued in
volvement. One of those projects,
a dorm program called AIDS 101
and put on by students in the
class, will be offered beginning in
February.
"(The AIDS 101 programs! will
all deal with basic AIDS facts: its
definition, transmission and pre
vention. But the students will in
dividualize them to focus on
where they really see AIDS having
an impact for students," Fabiano
said.

Two follow-up programs will be
offered in conjunction with AIDS
101. "They focus on the two C's,
" Fabiano explained, "condoms
and communication."
"Rubberware Parties" put on
by the AIDS Education project
deal with condom awareness and
safe sex practices, and an "In
timacy Talk" workshop will work
on communication skills, Fabiano
said.
Involvement off-campus is also
an option for students in the out
reach network. There are students
working on the East Palo Alto
Community AIDS Project who
"will walk the streets and work
directly with intravenous drug
users," Fabiano said.
Others will be doing a revised
AIDS 101 talk in local high
schools, or providing one-on-one
emotional support for people with
AIDS through Aris, a Santa Clara
County AIDS public service
agency, Fabiano said.
Michael Stevenson, a chemistry
graduate student, did not take the
class but "jumped into" the out
reach program at the beginning
of this quarter. "HIV doesn't dis
criminate, people do," he com
mented.
Kramer agreed that there is a

lot of denial by students who are
only "kidding themselves" if they
think that it won't affect them.
"It will cut into everyone's life,"
she said.
Fabiano cited the statistic that
one in every 500 college students
may be infected with the HIV
virus without knowing it. "Only
some people are infected by AIDS,
but everyone is affected by it,"
she said.
"There is always a place for
those motivated to become part
of the solution," Fabiano said.
"AIDS is at epidemic proportions,
and it hasn't peaked yet. ... It
will be affecting students' future
happiness if they don't learn more
and become part of the solution."
