# Adviser targets minority needs
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
"I have no qualms about it;
if I see a need not being met,
I'll take direct action to make
sure that it is." Such is the phi
losophy of Hector Cuevas, the
new director of the Undergrad
uate Advising Center.

Considered by many col
leagues to be an initiator and
risk-taker, Cuevas assumed the
duties of director in July. One
of his first priorities is to incor
porate multicultural awareness
into the academic advising sys
tem, he said.
Cuevas is a member of the
University Committee on Mi
nority Issues, and said he plans
to collaborate with other student
service organizations to offer ad
vice to minorities.
During his 10-year stint as a
counselor at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center,
Cuevas worked hard to increase
minority access to the center's
services, CPPC counselor Lance
Choi said.
Last year, Cuevas formed the
CPPC's Committee on Minority
AfTairs, which sought to provide
special assistance for ethnic stu
dents.
"After a year's work, we were
able to institutionalize some

commitments to some of the mi
nority communities at
Stanford," Cuevas said.
Rather than holding only the
ethnic staff responsible for
meeting the special needs of mi
nority students, Cuevas
institutionalized a greater com

mitment to those students
throughout the CPPC, Choi
said.
As head of the committee.
Cuevas established the Minority
Employer Locator Service,

Meeting the needs of minority students is one of the top priorities
for Hector Cuevas.
