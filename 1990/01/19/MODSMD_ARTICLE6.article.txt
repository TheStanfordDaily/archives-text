# Adviser targets minority needs
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Senior staff writer 
"I have no qualms about it;
if I see a need not being met,
I'll take direct action to make
sure that it is." Such is the phi
losophy of Hector Cuevas, the
new director of the Undergrad
uate Advising Center.

Considered by many col
leagues to be an initiator and
risk-taker, Cuevas assumed the
duties of director in July. One
of his first priorities is to incor
porate multicultural awareness
into the academic advising sys
tem, he said.
Cuevas is a member of the
University Committee on Mi
nority Issues, and said he plans
to collaborate with other student
service organizations to offer ad
vice to minorities.
During his 10-year stint as a
counselor at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center,
Cuevas worked hard to increase
minority access to the center's
services, CPPC counselor Lance
Choi said.
Last year, Cuevas formed the
CPPC's Committee on Minority
AfTairs, which sought to provide
special assistance for ethnic stu
dents.
"After a year's work, we were
able to institutionalize some

commitments to some of the mi
nority communities at
Stanford," Cuevas said.
Rather than holding only the
ethnic staff responsible for
meeting the special needs of mi
nority students, Cuevas
institutionalized a greater com

mitment to those students
throughout the CPPC, Choi
said.
As head of the committee.
Cuevas established the Minority

which helps connect students with
internship programs in their areas
of interest.
Choi said Cuevas helped minor
ity students become more aware
of internship programs. Cuevas
"would make sure he got the ad
vertising out because these were
incredible opportunities, and he
wanted students to take advantage
of them," Choi said.
Cuevas, who is replacing outgo
ing director Audrey Bernfield,
was chosen from among 40 appli
cants in a national search.
During the interviewing proc
ess, Cuevas impressed the com
mittee with his ideas on providing
a network to help minority stu
dents through collaboration, said
Thomas Wasow, dean of Under
graduate Studies and a member
of the search committee.
Advising has generally been
geared to the psychology of stu
dents from the dominant culture,
but minority students use differ
ent styles of communication, pre

venting them from fully benefiting
from standard counseling, Cuevas
said.
Although the advising center
has recently instituted workshops
addressing cultural differences,
many advisers are still not in
touch with minority concerns,
Cuevas said. He added that he
hopes to turn these workshops
into a long-term system.
A further priority for Cuevas is
encouraging minority students to
consider graduate work in the hu
manities and sciences. With the
anticipated need for minority pro
fessors in upcoming years, Cuevas
said he wants to raise minority
student awareness about this
need.
As the first in his family to
attend college, Cuevas said he al
ways felt education was impor
tant.
Cuevas attended San Jose State
University where he earned a B.A.
in History in 1973 and an M.A.
in counseling in 1980.
Before coming to Stanford in
1978 as the director of the CPPC's
internship program, Cuevas
worked for three years on a pro
gram that served minority needs
at UC-Santa Cruz.
