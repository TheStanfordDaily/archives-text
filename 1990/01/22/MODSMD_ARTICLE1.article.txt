### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
The war on drugs has spread to Campus
Drive.
Stanford police conducted an apparent
raid to search for drugs or other illegal
activity in two rooms at the AD House
Friday.
However, "they didn't find what they
were expecting to," said Chip Bartlett, a
resident assistant in the house.
The police found no evidence and no
charges were filed against any residents,
according to the house's other RA, Michelle
Stewart.
Police arrived at approximately 6 p.m.
Friday with a search warrant for two spe
cific student rooms. Bartlett estimated that
12 officers were involved.
Police officials could not be reached over
the weekend for comment.
The police went up to the rooms, ques
tioned the students, and then searched the
rooms in the students' presence, Bartlett
said.
Bartlett, Stewart and other house resi
dents refused to release the names of the
students whose rooms were searched.
Police left the house without saying any

thing else to the residents, Bartlett said,
adding that the entire operation seemed
very well-planned and tight-lipped.
Police were stationed in the hallway
leading to the two rooms, Stewart said,
preventing her from viewing the search
personally.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson said he knew very little about
the raid, except "the fact that there was
one.
Robinson said that he was not directly
informed in advance, although police did
pick up a master key for the AD House
from the Office of Residential Affairs.
Bartlett confirmed that the police used
a key and did not forcibly enter the house
or the student's rooms.
Although the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity
House had problems in past years with
drug use and academic performance, Row
Director Diana Conklin said in December
1988 that the chapter had made progress
in these areas, "most notably with respect
to drug use."
These problems were not the cause of
the decision to place the Alpha Delt house
in the regular housing draw last year, ac
cording to Conklin. Instead, she cited the
house's failure to meet its Rush quota.
