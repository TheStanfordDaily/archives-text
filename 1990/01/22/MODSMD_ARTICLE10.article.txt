# Panel of experts discusses need for dramatic change

"The future is not running
toward you — you have to fetch
it."
Quoting an African proverb,
Joyce King, director of teacher
education at Santa Clara Uni
versity, warned of the need for
dramatic changes in the nation's
educational system.
King and four other panelists
at the weekend's You Can Make
a Difference Conference com
pared the current state of Amer
ican education to its purpose in
a democracy and called for
various educational reforms in
the '90s.
Yori Wada, former chair and
current member of the Univer
sity of California Board of
Regents, moderated the discus
sion.
California Superintendent of
Public Instruction Bill Honig
opened the panel with an ap
praisal of the current educa
tional system. "We are dealing
with poverty levels that have
doubled in the last 10 years,"
he noted.
About 1.5 million children are
living at the poverty level and
one in six does not speak Eng
lish as a primary language,
Honig said, adding that schools
must better prepare these
children to enter the job market.
Stressing the dependence of

corporate America on the edu
cational system, retired Pacific
Bell president Ted Saenger said
that business leaders expect, "at
the very least, an entry-level
work force well-grounded in the
basics, with some understand
ing of the work ethic and re
sponsibility, and with some
computer literacy."
Saenger, who now heads the
California Postsecondary Edu
cation Commission, said the ed
ucational system is not
achieving these goals. However,
he acknowledged that reforming
the system will require the co
operative effort of all societal
institutions.
For panelist Gina Hernandez,
a 1989 graduate of Stanford and
former co-chair of the Chi
cano/Latino student organiza
tion MEChA, federal funding is
a primary necessity for reform
ing education. "We have enough
weapons, but we don't have
enough schools, scholarships, fi
nancial aid and libraries," she
said.
Hernandez, who helped write
the Educational Bill of Rights
presented to the Democratic
presidential nominees in 1988,
called for an educational system
that will "meet the needs of all
the people" and "ensure fair and
equal access to higher educa
tion."
Ravenswood School District

Superintendent Charlie Knight
said she also supports increased
funding, and strongly encour
aged institutions of higher ed
ucation to promote public
service projects.
Noting the effectiveness of the
Ravenswood-Stanford Tutoring
Program in East Palo Alto,
Knight said, "The difference is
showing in grades, in a decrease
in dropout rates, and in the fact
that kids come to school — often
on the days when Stanford stu
dents are there."
King said teachers must be
come more aware of the social
inequalities which can impair
education. Otherwise, they
"may unwittingly help to per
petuate racism, sexism and
class-economic inequities."
Honig added that teachers
"can't just love kids and want
to change the world — they
must be professionals." He
stressed the need for a primary
and secondary school program
that provides preparation for
jobs, understanding of democra
cy, and perspective for intelli
gent decision-making.
"We give freedom, we give op
portunity, we give choice. But
freedom by itself doesn't mean
much. If you are ignorant and
lack a breadth of understanding,
the choice isn't powerful," he
said.
