Firebombs linked
The three incendiary devices
found at the Stanford Shopping
Center Jan. 17 appear to be
identical to the five other such
devices found in Bay Area de
partment stores during the last
three months, according to a
preliminary investigation.
Ron Wolters, assistant spe
cial agent in charge of the U.S.
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
Bureau in San Francisco, said
a preliminary investigation
revealed that the eight
matchbox-size devices were
similar. Wolters would not com
ment further on the investiga
tion.
The incendiary devices at the
Stanford Shopping Center were
found in the Macy's and Sak's
Fifth Avenue department
stores. A similar device was
also found Jan. 12 at the
Macy's Union Square store in
downtown San Francisco.
The other devices were found
Nov. 23 at Nordstrom in the
shopping center, Nov. 25 at I.
Magnin in downtown San
Francisco, Dec. 14 at the Union
Square Macy's and Dec. 17 at
the Emporium in downtown
San Francisco.

Bookstore to reuse
its plastic bags
In an effort to be more "en
vironmentally conscious," the
Stanford Bookstore is initiating
a program to reuse its plastic
shopping bags. In addition, the
Bookstore has begun selling
recycled paper products and
using cardboard cups instead
of styrofoam in its food areas.
The Bookstore is currently
working with Students for En
vironmental Action at Stanford
to have students return their
red and white Bookstore bags
for reuse.
According to Rosie Sims, op
erations manager of the Book
store, the plan calls for stu
dents to collect their unwanted
bags in bins at their residences.
After they are returned to the
Bookstore, employees will clean

them and put them out for
reuse.
According to Barbara Voss,
program coordinator of the
Stanford Recycling Center,
many plastic materials are "al
most impossible to recycle" be
cause they are made of many
different kinds of plastics, and
there is not a market for these
materials in the Bay Area.
Starting in the next few
months, as the current order
of plastic bags runs out, Sims
said the Bookstore will begin
using biodegradable bags.
In addition, the Bookstore
has begun stocking school prod
ucts and stationery made from
recycled paper, according to
SEAS member Beverly
Loßuglio.

Endowment to fund
environmental talks
The Graduate Scool of Busi
ness hopes to begin a tradition
of environmental awareness by
bringing distinguished environ
mentalist Sen. Tim Wirth, D-
Colo., to speak Jan. 29 in
Bishop Auditorium.
The speech will mark the
first use of funds from an en
dowment in memory of Con
radin von Gugelberg, a 1987
graduate of the business school
who died in 1988.
The event's organizers — the
student group "The Natural
Concern," and the business
school's Public Management
Program — plan to make
Wirth's speech the first in an
annual environmental lecture
series.
The von Gugelberg Environ
mental Fund was created
through donations made by his
parents, classmates and the
business school shortly after
von Gugelberg's death. The en
dowed fund is sufficient to
sponsor an annual environmen
talist speaker and renewed
recycling efforts at the business
school, according to Jim
Thompson, director of the
Public Management Program.
