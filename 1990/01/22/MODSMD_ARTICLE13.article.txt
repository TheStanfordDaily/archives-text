# Yugoslavia promises change

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - The
government yesterday pledged to adopt
democratic reforms regardless of whether
they are supported by the Communist
Party, which was deadlocked in a key con
gress between liberals and hard-liners.
Communists from the liberal republic of
Slovenia urged that the party transform
itself into a loose coalition of regional Com
munist parties in this nation of six
federated republics and two provinces.
Such a move would radically transform
it from its traditional centralized federal
party structure and would significantly
reduce the power of the national Commu
nist Party.
But opponents warn that party unity is
vjtal to the unity of Yugo&layia, jathich-ia
undergoing its worst economic crisis and
is beset by ethnic rivalries.
Slovenian Party leader Ciril Ribicic also
urged the congress to immediately adopt
a key document declaring the party's will
ingness to relinquish its monopoly on
power and support free elections.
Slovenian delegates are fighting over the
issue of political and party reform with
their hard-line rivals in the largest state,
Serbia.
Regional party autonomy has been
rejected by the Serbians, who favor a strong
centralized party structure and want slower
political change.
Vice Premier Zivko Pregl warned that
the government would not allow the fate
of the country to "be decided in quarrels
among people representing 10 percent of
the population," referring to the 2 million
party members.

Pregl said the proceedings at the party
congress would "not in any way influence
the government."
On Friday, the government said it would
present constitutional amendments to Par
liament scrapping the party's guaranteed
leading role in society, and lay the legal
groundwork for free elections due in April.
Pregl said the government would go
ahead with these plans regardless of
whether the party adopts the key draft
document declaring its willingness to relin
quish its 45-year monopoly on power.
The party would in future only "be rel
evant to the extent they succeed in elec
tions," he said.
Discussion of the political reform docu
ment was forced into the background as
delegates engaged in a bitter war of words
over the future of the party, a debate in
dicative of the deep split within the party.
Slovenian leader Ribicic said the Yugos
lav Communist Party should "become an
organization of independent and free re
publican Communist" parties.
Only then "can we compete in a multi
party system on an equal footing with other
regional parties in the struggle for power,"
Ribicic said.
There is a deep split within the party
between those backing rapid political
change in conjunction with economic re
forms already under way and those reluc
tant to fully relinquish the Communists'
hold on power.
"No one wants to break up an organi
zation such as this when it is most neces
sary because of the upcoming democratic
reforms," said a Slovenian party leader.
