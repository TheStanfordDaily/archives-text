## Communist Party ousts Krenz 
### 
WEST BERLIN (AP) - East
Germany's ruling Communist
Party yesterday expelled Egon
Krenz, the ousted leader who
opened the Berlin Wall, and lost
its popular No. 2 official in a res
ignation that could cripple the em
battled party.
The Communists rejected de
mands to disband but offered the
opposition "co-responsibility" in
the government until May elec
tions, abolished their clasped
hands emblem and offered to
change their party's name.
Tens of thousands of anti-
Communist protesters carrying
suitcases marched across the bor
der from Duderstadt to Goettin
gen, West Germany, in a symbolic
exodus but returned later in the
day.
West Germany's ARD television
said about 60,000 people were in
volved but police in Goettingen
put the number at about 25,000.
Wolfgang Berghofer, a reformer
who was the Communist Party's
deputy chairman, resigned along
with 39 other prominent members
in his home city of Dresden, the
official news agency ADN said.
"With deep regret for our coun
try, we the undersigned declare
our resignation from the Commu
nist Party, and with this step we
include the urgent demand that
the Communist Party be broken
up," Berghofer said in a statement

read to reporters in Dresden.
Three breakaway Communist
factions are trying to establish
themselves as separate political
forces, and government television
said Berghofer's move put the
party's future in "extreme dan
ger.
Berghofer also said he and the
others "support the growing to
gether of the two German states
within the framework of Euro
pean unity." It was unclear
whether he was specifically en
dorsing German reunification.
Berghofer, Dresden's 46-year
old mayor, is credited with helping
to head off a potential massacre
of pro-democracy demonstrators
in October. He was the first offi
cial to call for a free-market eco
nomy.
Berghofer has been widely re
ported to be joining the opposition
Social Democratic party, although
yesterday's announcement made
no mention of such a step.
His desertion is expected to
spark a further exodus from the
party, whose membership has
plunged from nearly 2.3 million
in 1987 to 1.2 million currently.
In a two-day meeting that ended
yesterday, the Communists ex
pelled Krenz and 13 members of
the ousted ruling Politburo. It
rejected demands to disband but
promised "radical reform and con
solidation" and rehabilitated 47

East Germans puniahed for
speaking out against former hard
line Communist leaders.
Krenz immediately appealed his
expulsion, becoming the first
former top leader to fight back
publicly. A dozen former leaders
were kicked out in December and
nine are in prison awaiting cor
ruption trials.
The official announcement did
not specify a reason for yester
day's purge. However, the Com
munists are moving to rid them
selves of the last of the top offi
cials associated with Erich
Honecker, the ha r d-liner replaced
by Krenz on Oct. 18 after 18 years
in power.
Honecker was kicked out of the
party in December and now faces
an indictment for high treason.
Other members of his government
have been accused of corruption.
Krenz, seen as a Honecker
protege, inherited the Ixelm of a
country spinning out of control.
Thousands were fleeing daily to
the West while others demonstra
ted for reform.
Trying to stem the exodus and
remain in power, Krenz opened
the Berlin Wall and other barriers
to the West on Nov. 9 and
promised other reform, but he
was ousted himself after just six
weeks in office.
