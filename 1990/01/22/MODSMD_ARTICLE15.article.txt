New Soviet faction
MOSCOW (AP) — A group of pro
gressive Communists yesterday
formed the first de facto faction in
decades and said it will work for a
multiparty political system.
A total of 175 delegates from
throughout the country wound up a
two-day meeting by creating a faction
called the Democratic Platform, activ
ist and participant Andrei Koptyaev
reported.
On Saturday, the group decided that
if an upcoming meeting of their party
leadership does not accept democratic
reforms, they will split off and form
a Social Democratic Party.
Non-Communist parties are not yet
legal under national law, though Lit
huania and Latvia have broken that
taboo in recent weeks. Both Baltic
republics dropped their constitutional
guarantees of Communist supremacy
and legalized multiparty systems.
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorba
chev earlier this month dropped his
long-standing objection to alternative
political parties.
Haitian leader banished
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
A prominent civic leader, considered
the father of Haiti's constitution, was
forced into exile yesterday by the mil

itary regime, a day after it imposed
a state of siege and arrested dozens
of critics.
Dr. Louis Roy "was carrying a small
suitcase, kissed the ground two times,
and mounted the stairway to exile,"
a relative told The Associated Press.
Roy, 74, founder of the Haitian Red
Cross, flew to Miami aboard a com
mercial flight.
On Saturday, another government
critic, conservative leader Hubert de
Ronceray, was forced into exile after
police and soldiers rounded up dozens
of opponents.

Barry repents
WASHINGTON (AP) - Mayor
Marion Barry, acknowledging that he
needs "to heal my body, mind and
soul," but declining to mention drug
abuse, announced yesterday that he
will seek help following his arrest on
a cocaine possession charge.
"He has reached the hour of reck
oning," said his wife, EfTi.
At times blinking back tears, the
mayor provided no further details on
what kind of assistance he will seek,
except to say that nutritional expert
and social activist Dick Gregory has
been consulting him on how to get
help. An aide said Barry's main prob
lem was with alcoholism.

Barry's brief statement was the
latest chapter in an unfolding drama
that has riveted the nation's capital
since the mayor was arrested on drug
charges last Thursday night.
Hands across the Ukraine
KIEV, U.S.S.R. (AP) - Tens of
thousands of Ukrainians joined hands
yesterday in a joyous commemoration
of ethnic unity marking the brief ex
istence of a united, independent Uk
raine more than 70 years ago.
Organizers of the human chain,
leaders of the popular movement
Rukh, said it stretched from the«XJk
rainian capital Kiev to the western
Ukrainian city of Lvov, about 300
miles, and involved about 100,000
people.
That could not be confirmed, but
in Kiev, block after block of the city
center was lined with smiling Uk
rainians holding hands and waving
yellow-and-blue national flags. Many
greeted each other with "Long live
the Ukraine," and raised three fingers
in imitation of the republic's three
pronged crest.
The festive and officially-sanctioned
chain, with its theme of unity and
pride, displayed a more peaceful side
to the awakening nationalism among
Soviet ethnic groups.
