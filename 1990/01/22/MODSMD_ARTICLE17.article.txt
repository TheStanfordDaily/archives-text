## No parking zones

STANFORD IS RUNNING
out of parking spaces.
But, rather than adopting
such proposed solutions as limiting
access to parking for students or
significantly raising the cost of a
parking permit, the University
should concentrate on reducing the
number of cars on campus through
conservation methods such as car
pooling and shuttles.
Students live on campus and
should be allowed to park their
cars here. Since the Farm is located
in such a suburban setting, and
public transportation is less than
ideal in the Bay Area, having a car
is very convenient.
And raising the price of a
parking permit would discriminate

against students and staff mem
bers with lower salaries.
Another proposed option is
spending up to $40 million on
parking structures, but the Uni
versity should aim to introduce and
continue programs designed to
decrease the number of cars parked
on campus.
To promote carpooling, two or
more faculty, staff members or off
campus students can get a 'C' per
mit for free and three or more can
get a free 'A' permit. Another pos
sible solution is instituting a
shuttle service for employees and
students who live within a certain
mile radius of campus.
More creative solutions such as
these can save the University
money — and space.
