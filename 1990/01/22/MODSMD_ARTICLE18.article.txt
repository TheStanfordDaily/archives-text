# Killing them softly
## 
### 
ON WEDNESDAY, the U.S.
Congress will vote whether
to override President Bush's
veto of a bill allowing Chinese stu
dents to remain in the United
States after finishing their studies.
By overriding Bush's decision,
Congress will not only help ensure
the continued security of Chinese
nationals,in,, the,.. United. it
a strong. mepsajge to
conservatives and reformers in
China that this country will not
tolerate actions such as the June
4 massacre of pro-democracy dem
onstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square.
There are currently almost 400
mainland Chinese at Stanford, in
cluding students, visiting scholars
and family members, 90 percent of
whom are here on J-l student visas
which require holders to return to
their native countries for two years
after completing their studies.
But in November, President
Bush vetoed a bill introduced by
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Cal., that

would waive this two-year require
ment and allow Chinese students
to remain in the United: States.
Justifying his veto, Bush said he
wants to maintain "flexibility" in
his foreign policy with China. But
by following this policy, the Pres
ident is using Chinese students as
pawns in his international game
of political and economic diploma
cy.
Before and since the Tiananmen
Square massacre, Chinese students
at Stanford have been at the fore
front of national and international
Chinese student movements. While
many Chinese studying in the
United States say they eventually
want to return home and help their
country on the road to reform, if
they are forced to go back to China
now, they risk being arrested or
even killed.
Overriding President Bush's veto
would protect these students now
and ensure that when reform does
begin in China, there are leaders
ready to return home.
