University seeks to make child care affordable

Elizabeth enslin is right on
the mark in stating that Univer
sity employees' difficulties in
affording campus child care "should
not diminish the needs of student
families, or vice versa" (The Daily, Jan.
11). I hope that wasn't the angle of
The Daily's Jan. 9 feature article; it's
certainly not my view.
It is likely that Stanford houses
more child care and early childhood
education programs than any other
campus community in the U.S. But as
Dorothea Almond, advisor on child care
and founding co-director of the Univer
sity's Childcare Resource Center, notes:
"making child care affordable will be
the challenge to the Stanford commu
nity for the next phase of caring for
its young families" (Campus Report,
Nov. 15). There are too few safety nets
for student families trying to manage

I'm disappointed that the issue of child care costs
has been framed as better or worse for students or
employees. In fact, it's one issue which especially
ought to find common cause.

costs; too many employee families can't
even consider the cost of care on
campus.
The problem is not limited to Stan
ford — the prevailing model of finan
cially self-supporting early childhood
education is increasingly unsustainable
across the country. It's especially true
here, in a community which recognizes
the need for high quality care. Along
with parents' financial concerns, teach
ers and caregivers — the heart of any
program — can't and won't continue

to "subsidize" child care by accepting
low wages.

This university is breaking some new
ground in understanding the needs of
a diverse community. We'll also need to
find new ways to preserve quality care
for our children, while allowing our
adults to work and study uncon-

strained by financial hardship.
In concert with other University
departments, the Childcare Resource
Center has been charged to facilitate
policy and practical developments in
this area, and we anticipate greater
attention to family needs in the near
future.
MeanwV'le, we can look to the
campus children's centers as some of
the best places to find a sense of
community between students, staff and
faculty members. And all Stanford
families are welcome to take advantage
of the Childcare Resource Center's
support, information and referral
services — for programs both on and
off campus. The Center is located in
the Escondido Village Administration
Building, and can be reached by phone
at 723-2660.
