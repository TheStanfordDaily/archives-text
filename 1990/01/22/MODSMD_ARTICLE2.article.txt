# ASSU refunds increase, leaving groups strapped

### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Students taking ASSU fee refunds last
quarter have left many student groups
strapped for cash.
In a letter to The Daily, ASSU Speakers
Bureau Director Rana Bhadury wrote that
groups funded through special fees "last
quarter saw the worst setbacks the ASSU
has seen in recent history."
According to Council of Presidents mem
ber Ingrid Nava, "The majority [of the
groups] lost more than 30 percent."
The Asian American Student Association
lost 51.4 percei#. of its budget, the Black
StTTSent Union lost 46 percent, and KZSU
lost 43 percent.
In addition, three groups that fund more
than 100 smalller student groups lost sig
nificant amounts. The Program Board lost
35 percent, the Publications Board 31 per
cent, and the Community Service Fund 33
percent.
Groups requesting $4,000 or more from
the ASSU are funded through a special
fee, while those requesting less than $4,000
apply to the Program Board, the Commu
nity Service Fund or the Publications
Board for a share of the general fee.

the general fee and all special fees each
quarter of the following year.
"There is a trend toward the students
taking back more and more money,"
Bhadury said.
The reason?
Bhadury posited that "people don't reaily
think too much about taking their money
back." He added that when applying for
their fee refunds, some students see
acronyms like SURE — Stanford United
for Rape Elimination — that they do not
understand. "If they knew that, perhaps
most of them would be more supportive
of what is going on," Bhadury said.
He said that many students vote for fund
ing for the groups in the spring election,
only to strip the money away by demanding
their refund.
Nava agreed. "I think that a lot of it is
that people don't make the con
nection between what they vote
for in the spring and what they
take back .. . people don't realize
that this is a msyor budget source
for these groups," she said.
But missing this connection
may restrict the funds needed for
campus programs.
Each spring, when student
groups request special fees, they
are allowed to budget in a 25 per
cent expected loss to fee refunds.
If, however, students take refunds
amounting to more than 25 per
cent of any group's budget, the
group loses money actually
needed to operate its programs.
Bhadury said the Speakers
Bureau "lost about $2,200 more
than we expected" and will have
to cut down on the number of
speakers it brings in this year.
AASA treasurer Katy Young
said the budget cuts forced the
group to reduce funds for last
quarter's celebration of AASA's
20th anniversary.
Lloyd Metz, treasurer of the
BSU, said the organization's

reduced budget would not affect
BSU activities this year, but
might jeopardize next year's pro
grams.
Bhadury said the recently
formed Student Group Council is
pursuing different means to cut
down on losses, including handing
students in line for fee refunds
an information sheet detailing
what each organization does and
how much money they can get

back from each group.
After students read the sheet,
they will then "write down on a
piece of paper which organization
they want the money back from
... physically write down, rather
than just tick off names,"
Bhadury said.
In the past, students have
needed only to check boxes next
to the name of the organization
to receive a refund.
