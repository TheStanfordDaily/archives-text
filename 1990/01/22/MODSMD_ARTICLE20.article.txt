# Self-defense class demonstrates need for more funding
## 
### 
We have just returned from the first
class session of SWOPSI's Issues in
Self Defense for Women. This is the
second quarter we have been two of
approximately 40 people competing for
the course's 12 spots. This is also the
second quarter we were denied a spot.
A course such as this requires a
small, manageable size in order to be
effective. Therefore, the instructors
were forced to have students reveal
personal information to "justify" their
need to take the class this quarter.
Believing other women had a more

immediate need, we voluntarily left the
class, even though we are both seniors,
one of us scheduled to graduate at the
end of this quarter.
This is ridiculous. While this univer
sity always has budgetary constraints,
any course with such a consistent lack
of availability demonstrates a need for
attention and funding. In the case of
self defense for women, this attention
is all the more imperative.
This class benefits not only the indi
vidual participants, but contributes to
our community by promoting rape
prevention and elimination. A course
with such critical and timely content
should not be denied to any woman
who wants it.
We feel a need to further the eÂ£fo^, v
of groups already working toward tlie
elimination of rape. We want to see

this course receive necessary funding.
We therefore ask anyone interested in
pursuing this specific goal to contact
one of us at 322-9686 or 32.5-7109.
