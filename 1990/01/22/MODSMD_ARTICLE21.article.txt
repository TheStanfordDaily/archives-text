# Wrong to assume that all white males are racist
## 
### 
The word "racist" has been thought
lessly misused and overused on this
<ftwnpus for years now, but to the ex
tent that it retains any meaning at all,
it accurately describes an assumption

behind The Daily editorial last Thurs
day.
The Daily praised the Supreme
Court's decision to open for inspection
the records of tenure review boards,
adding without explanation that most
of the members of such boards "are
white males." The implication appears
to be: . . and therefore sexist and
racist," solely because of their gender
and skin color.
There are white males on tenure
review boards and there are racists on
tenure review boards, but the prior
assumption that white males are
racists is prejudice. Martin Luther
King'* dream was of an America where
people would be judged on the content
of their character and not the color of
their skin. It is unfortunate that The
Daily has yet to reach this goal.
