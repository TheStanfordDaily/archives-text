## BSU events benefit all 
### 
HAVE YOU EVER taken a course
that dealt with the experiences of
African-Americans? Are you now
or have you previously been enrolled in
Cultures, Ideas and Values?
Did you attend any of last week's Mar
tin Luther King Jr. Commemorative pro
grams? Have you ever visited Ujamaa
House for its programs, such as Club
Ujamaa? Have you ever seen the Kuumba
dance ensemble perform or heard the
itanford Gospel Choir sing?
* Have you ever tutored black youth in
East Palo Alto? Do you support the calls
for ethnic studies, increased financial aid
and improved student services made by
4je Black Student Union and other stu
dents of color organizations?
Education. Culture. Social activities.
Student empowerment. That is what the
Stanford BSU is all about. The BSU
exists to facilitate the efforts of African-
American students making full use of all
that Stanford has to offer.
Enraged and ignited to act in the wake
of the assassination of Martin Luther
King, the BSU has worked for over two
decades to ensure the right of African-
American people to an education that
empowers and equips them to improve
the world in which we all live.
In the spirit of this mission, the BSU
has built and supported a strong African-
American community which includes
such important institutions as Ujamaa
House, the Program in African and Afro-
American Studies, the Committee on
Black Performing Arts, the Black Com
munity Services Center and much more.
Additionally, the BSU has produced an

nual "communifying" programs such as
the Kwanzaa Celebration, the Soul Food
Dinner, the Martin Luther King Jr. Com
memoration Events, the Malcolm X
Birthday Celebration, Thursday's "The
Cosby Show" and "A Different World"
nights and Friday noon chill-outs in
White Plaza.
The BSU has created institutions, put
on programs and waged struggles that
not only serve the African-American com
munity, but more broadly, benefit the
entire Stanford community.
When the BSU led the way in the
Western Culture curricular reform that
called for the experiences of minorities
and women to be dealt with, all people
benefitted from a more enlightened edu
cation.
When the BSU brought together stu
dent of color and progressive organiza
tions a few years ago to create the
People's Platform, the entire student body
gained by having a more relevant student
government with a vision to make Stan
ford a more multicultural and pluralistic
community in the interest of all students.
And when we as a Stanford community
celebrate the life of Martin Luther King
Jr. at commemoration programs organ
ized by the BSU with many campus agen
cies, we are all inspired by the messages
of Bishop Desmond Tutu, Jesse Jackson,
Attallah Shabazz, Rose Sanders, Spike
Lee, Yolanda King and South African
anti-apartheid leader Allen Boesak.
Through all of its endeavors, the BSU
is committed to building a multicultural
community â€” a goal that the majority
of students share. The BSU contributes

to such an ideal by building educatiompl
and cultural institutions that help the
entire Stanford community to better un
derstand the history, the culture and the
condition of the African-American com
munity.
In order to continue its multicultural
contributions to Stanford, the BSU must
be supported. Its annual fee assessment
provides the means to sustain itself and
all of its activities.
Therefore, with ASSU fee refunds ap
proaching, please remember that the BSU
works for you. Your continued support
of the BSU will ensure the continuation
of the BSU's many and great contribu
tions to the Stanford community.
