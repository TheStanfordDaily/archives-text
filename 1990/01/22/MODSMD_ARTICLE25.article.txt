## Panama invasion served only as stage for U.S. drug war rhetoric 
### 
THE COLD WAR is dead. But
before it could even be buried
properly, a White House drum
roll was announcing its successor —
the so-called "war against drugs."
This is to be the new rhetoric to
justify our government's vast military
budget and continued interference in
the affairs of other countries. Panama
served as stage for its debut. Although
Noriega's capture will in no way
diminish the flood of drugs entering
the United States every day, officials
have repeatedly cited his alleged in
volvement in drug trafficking to justify
the invasion.
President Bush won a victory with
that invasion, finally vanquishing the
odious "wimp" label. He was willing to
sacrifice the lives of 26 U.S. troops to
do it, many of whom were poor,
African-American or Hispanic, who had
enlisted in the Army for the sake of an
education they could not otherwise
afford and will now not live to eryoy.
And what of the Panamanian dead?
We may never know the number of

civilian casualties; of the roughly 1000
reported still missing by the Red
Cross, U.S. officials acknowledge ap
proximately 200 civilians killed. They
explain this remarkably low estimate
by claiming cavalierly that many of the
dead may well have been Panamanian
military troops out of uniform. We
might remember that the U S. media
never did provide hard figures for the
number killed in our last imperialistic
adventure — Grenada.
The invasion of Panama not only
cost many lives; it was also blatantly
illegal. The Torryos-Carter Accords of
1977 (specifically the DiConcini Condi
tion) state clearly that the United
States may only intervene in the inter
nal affairs of Panama if the function
ing of the canal is endanijered.
Noriega was always very careful to
avoid any comment that might show an
intent to close the canal. The hypocrisy
of President Bush's claim to be protec
ting American lives in Panama be
comes immediately obvious when one

murder of a U.S. nun in Nicaragua.
This woman was not merely threat
ened with rape, but actually killed. Yet
no U.S. troops are on their way to
invade the Nicaraguan rebel camps,
and the Contra leaders, also accused of
drug smuggling, are not facing arrest.
As the returning U.S. troops line up
to receive their medals, as the crowds
cheer and as politicians of all persua
sions try to outshout one another in
proclaiming their unconditional enthu
siasm, more sober observers will be
pondering the long-term effects of the
invasion.
The timing of the invasion is a
special note. January 1, 1990 was the

day a Panamanian was to take over
management of the canal. The invasion
just squeaked under the wire to ensure
that the new manager would be
securely within the U.S. pocket.
More importantly, the military ad
venture corresponded to the drawing
up of the Pentagon's budget plan for
the next five years. Panama served as
the proving-ground for new high
technology (the "Stealth" F-117 bomb
er) and the new army (light infantry
divisions designed to intervene in the
"Third World" to protect U.S. inter
ests). This hearkens back to Guernica,
Spain, where Hitler tested his
Luftwaffe before unleashing it on the

rest of Europe.
The death and destruction wreaked
by U.S. forces in Panama should
likewise inspire us to see beyond the
thin facade of drug war rhetoric. If the
U.S. government were truly interested
in beating the drug problem, it would
not be turning addicts away from
treatment facilities for lack of space
and funding. And it would address the
poverty and hopelessness which create
the demand for drugs in the first
place.
The jingoism of the drug war serves
only to hide the military pursuits of
the greedy behind a moralistic smoke
screen. The invasion of Panama should
make it clear to all that the United
States is not fighting a war against
drugs. We should rather be fighting
our addiction to war.

And what of the Panamanian dead?
We may never know the number of

civilian casualties; of the roughly 1000
reported still missing by the Red
Cross, U.S. officials acknowledge ap
proximately 200 civilians killed. They
explain this remarkably low estimate
by claiming cavalierly that many of the
dead may well have been Panamanian
military troops out of uniform. We
might remember that the U S. media
never did provide hard figures for the
number killed in our last imperialistic
adventure — Grenada.
The invasion of Panama not only
cost many lives; it was also blatantly
illegal. The Torryos-Carter Accords of
1977 (specifically the DiConcini Condi
tion) state clearly that the United
States may only intervene in the inter
nal affairs of Panama if the function
ing of the canal is endanijered.
Noriega was always very careful to
avoid any comment that might show an
intent to close the canal. The hypocrisy
of President Bush's claim to be protec
ting American lives in Panama be
comes immediately obvious when one
notes his muted response to the recent

President Bush won a victory with the invasion, finally
vanquishing the odious 'wimp' label. He was willing to
sacrifice the lives of 26 troops to do it, many of whom
were poor, African-American or Hispanic.

murder of a U.S. nun in Nicaragua.
This woman was not merely threat
ened with rape, but actually killed. Yet
no U.S. troops are on their way to
invade the Nicaraguan rebel camps,
and the Contra leaders, also accused of
drug smuggling, are not facing arrest.
As the returning U.S. troops line up
to receive their medals, as the crowds
cheer and as politicians of all persua
sions try to outshout one another in
proclaiming their unconditional enthu
siasm, more sober observers will be
pondering the long-term effects of the
invasion.
The timing of the invasion is a
special note. January 1, 1990 was the

day a Panamanian was to take over
management of the canal. The invasion
just squeaked under the wire to ensure
that the new manager would be
securely within the U.S. pocket.
More importantly, the military ad
venture corresponded to the drawing
up of the Pentagon's budget plan for
the next five years. Panama served as
the proving-ground for new high
technology (the "Stealth" F-117 bomb
er) and the new army (light infantry
divisions designed to intervene in the
"Third World" to protect U.S. inter
ests). This hearkens back to Guernica,
Spain, where Hitler tested his
Luftwaffe before unleashing it on the

rest of Europe.
The death and destruction wreaked
by U.S. forces in Panama should
likewise inspire us to see beyond the
thin facade of drug war rhetoric. If the
U.S. government were truly interested
in beating the drug problem, it would
not be turning addicts away from
treatment facilities for lack of space
and funding. And it would address the
poverty and hopelessness which create
the demand for drugs in the first
place.
The jingoism of the drug war serves
only to hide the military pursuits of
the greedy behind a moralistic smoke
screen. The invasion of Panama should
make it clear to all that the United
States is not fighting a war against
drugs. We should rather be fighting
our addiction to war.
