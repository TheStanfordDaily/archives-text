Perhaps more than any other
high public officials, justices of
the U.S. Supreme Court appear
to occupy a realm somewhere be
tween mere mortals and gods.
We are tempted to imagine that
the justices endeavor to uphold
justice through vigorous but prin
cipled debates that determine the
outcome of some of the most sig
nificant issues in public affairs.
And because the Court officially
communicates with the nation
only through its written opinions,
we rarely gain a glimpse into the
Court's internal dynamics — the
power struggles, the personal re
lationships and the contribution
individual justices make to the
work of the Court.
It is both instructive and sober
ing, then, to read James Simon's
"The Antagonists: Hugo Black,
Felix Frankfurter and Civil
Liberties in Modern America."
The book takes us back to what
is undoubtedly one of the most
consequential divisions to exist on
the 20th century Supreme Court,
the antagonism between two great
justices, Hugo Black and Felix
Frankfurter. Simon paints com
pelling portraits of the two jus
tices and describes their unique
influence on the evolution of
modern civil liberties.
Simon's book, therefore, is
about much more than a mere
personality conflict behind the
bench of the nation's highest
court. "The Antagonists" presents
a colorful and lucid discussion of
one of the central debates dividing
the modern Court: the tension be
tween judicial activism and judi
cial restraint.
Simon, dean of New York Law
Sckool and author of sevetal
popular books about law, includ
ing "Independent Journey: The
Life of William O. Douglas," in
terweaves the lives and legal
careers of the two Justices with
a lawyer's detail and a writer's
flair.
He chronicles the two justices'
ascension to the Court at the
height of the New Deal, and ex
plains how each defied expecta

tions concerning their future
performance on the Court. Simon
traces Black's transition from po
litically savvy former senator of
Alabama and one-time member of
the Ku Klux Klan to defender of
individual rights and racial
equality.
Simon also sets out to explain
how the brilliant Frankfurter, a
former adviser to the American
Civil Liberties Union, a con
fidante of FDR and one of the
legislative architects of the New
Deal, set his personal political al
legiances aside and instead advo
cated a limited role for the Court.
Simon argues that although
Frankfurter professed a commit
ment to civil liberties, in a con
stitutional democracy the
legislative and executive branches,
not the courts, defend these
liberties.
On one level, "The Antagonists"
explores the justices' personalities

Simon argues that Frankfurter's
patriotism influenced his decision
in Minersville School District v.
Gobitis, denying a challenge by
Jehovah's Witnesses to a school
board regulation that required all
students to salute the American
flag.
Simon contends that
Frankfurter was "a patriot first
and last," and that this affected
his position. As an Austrian Jew
who came to this country as a
young boy, Frankfurter was grate
ful to his adopted home for allow
ing him to fulfill a version of the
American Dream. Where else in
1940 could an Austrian Jew rise
to become an esteemed member
of the law school faculty of a pro
minent university like Harvard,
an adviser to presidents, and, ul
timately, an associate justice of
the Supreme Court?
More important and persuasive
than such psychological hypot
hesizing is the book's exploration
of the two justices' opposing views
of the Court's proper role in a
democracy. As Simon clearly
shows, the two justices' views
were nearly antithetical and
paradigmatic. Black, the self
styled judicial advocate of the Bill
of Rights, was often exasperated
by Frankfurter, who believed that

judiciary undermines the will of
the people.
Although Black initially voted
with Frankfurter on Gobitis,
Simon shows how Black
philosophically split off from
Frankfurter in West Virginia
Board of Education v. Barnette
to advocate increased court inter
vention when First Amendment
liberties are in jeopardy. In Bar
nette, the Court reversed itself,
deciding that a mandatory flag
salute was unconstitutional.
Simon does not entirely account
for this change in Black's position,
offering only anecdotal evidence.
For example, Simon describes the
influence of the rash of nationalis
tic mob violence that followed the
Court's decision in Gobitis to en
force respect for the flag. Accord
ing to Simon, Black suggested to
Frankfurter that his change of
heart resulted from reading the
newspaper and not the Constitu
tion. In later years, Black's posi
tion hardened into a conviction
that First Ammendment protec
tions were absolute, a belief that
became his judicial hallmark and
enabled him to solidify his lead
ership of the Court's liberal wing.
In response to the desertion of
Black and others from their ear
lier support of Frankfurter's
restraint in the flag-salute case,

Frankfurter, according to Simon,
"ranted and raved like a wounded
animal, calling the justices the
Axis."
Frankfurter viewed his defeat
in Barnette as a personal setback
engineered by Black. Frankfurter
viewed Black as a rough-cut, in
tellectually deficient Alabaman,
who placed naked political motives
ahead of the legitimate contest
between opposing interpretations
of constitutional principles.
Frankfurter's reaction was
symptomatic of his vituperative
streak: In their twenty-three years
together on the Court, Frank
furter directed much invective
against Black, whom he labeled a
"a poor rube incapable of grasping
the subtleties of judicial interpre
tation."
Ironically, the "poor rube" and
Frankfurter found themselves on
the same side in a number of
cases, including the 1944 decision
in Korematsu v. United States. In
his msgority opinion, Black upheld
the military order evicting
Japanese-Americans on the West
Coast from their homes, and
relocating them in internment
camps.
In a thoroughly uncharacteris
tic opinion, Black denied that
Korematsu was a case "involving
the imprisonment of a loyal citizen
in a concentration camp because
of racial prejudice." Rather, Fred
Korematsu, a Japanese-American
welder, was excluded from his

home, because "we are at war with
the Japanese Empire."
Frankfurter joined Black's op
inion, and in one of the Court's
darkest moments, the antagonists
willingly set aside their individual
commitments to civil liberties and
succumbed to the pressure to sup
port the government'B national de
fense claims during the war.
Ironically, this opinion, so con
demnable on moral grounds, left
an enduring and positive legal
legacy: Black, for the first time,
set forth the constitutional stand
ard — strict scrutiny — for jud
icial review of racial classifi
cations. By doing so, he paved the
way for the Court's subsequent
protection of the civil rights of
racial and ethnic minorities.
It is the author's claim that the
antagonism between Frankfurter
and Black strengthened the Court
and the nation, pushing each to
"their best and most impassioned
advocacy." Simon claims that de
spite their differences, Black and
Frankfurter developed a mutual
respect and affinity for each other,
founded on a recognition that a

shared commitment to liberal
values underlaid their differences.
Whether such common ground
exists on the Supreme Court
today is debatable. Indeed a book
on Justices Brennan and
Rehnquist would read differently
than "The Antagonists," and
would probably be better called
"The Adversaries."
The difference is that the
struggle between Black and
Frankfurter was part of a revo
lution that altered the role of the
judiciary in modern America.
Throughout the 1950s and 19605,
the Court redefined its role in our
society, expanding judicial protec
tion of civil liberties and mandat
ing the achievement of greater
equality.
Today, that body of activist
precedent is constitutional law.
And the Rehnquist Court, in the
waning hours of the 1989 term,
undercut these long-standing de
cisions in a spate of regressive
decisions reducing protection of
individual autonomy and narrow
ing the scope of civil rights law.
The Court's current msyority has
launched what can be best de
scribed as the opening salvos of
a counter-revolution. "The An
tagonists" places these encroach
ments on civil liberties in their
proper historical perspective.
