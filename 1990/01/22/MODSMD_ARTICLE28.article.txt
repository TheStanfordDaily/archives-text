Perhaps more than any other
high public officials, justices of
the U.S. Supreme Court appear
to occupy a realm somewhere be
tween mere mortals and gods.
We are tempted to imagine that
the justices endeavor to uphold
justice through vigorous but prin
cipled debates that determine the
outcome of some of the most sig
nificant issues in public affairs.
And because the Court officially
communicates with the nation
only through its written opinions,
we rarely gain a glimpse into the
Court's internal dynamics â€” the
power struggles, the personal re
lationships and the contribution
individual justices make to the
work of the Court.
It is both instructive and sober
ing, then, to read James Simon's
"The Antagonists: Hugo Black,
Felix Frankfurter and Civil
Liberties in Modern America."
The book takes us back to what
is undoubtedly one of the most
consequential divisions to exist on
the 20th century Supreme Court,
the antagonism between two great
justices, Hugo Black and Felix
Frankfurter. Simon paints com
pelling portraits of the two jus
tices and describes their unique
influence on the evolution of
modern civil liberties.
Simon's book, therefore, is
about much more than a mere
personality conflict behind the
bench of the nation's highest
court. "The Antagonists" presents
a colorful and lucid discussion of
one of the central debates dividing
the modern Court: the tension be
tween judicial activism and judi
cial restraint.
Simon, dean of New York Law
Sckool and author of sevetal
popular books about law, includ
ing "Independent Journey: The
Life of William O. Douglas," in
terweaves the lives and legal
careers of the two Justices with
a lawyer's detail and a writer's
flair.
He chronicles the two justices'
ascension to the Court at the
height of the New Deal, and ex
plains how each defied expecta

tions concerning their future
performance on the Court. Simon
traces Black's transition from po
litically savvy former senator of
Alabama and one-time member of
the Ku Klux Klan to defender of
individual rights and racial
equality.
Simon also sets out to explain
how the brilliant Frankfurter, a
former adviser to the American
Civil Liberties Union, a con
fidante of FDR and one of the
legislative architects of the New
Deal, set his personal political al
legiances aside and instead advo
cated a limited role for the Court.
Simon argues that although
Frankfurter professed a commit
ment to civil liberties, in a con
stitutional democracy the
legislative and executive branches,
not the courts, defend these
liberties.
On one level, "The Antagonists"
explores the justices' personalities
to offer insights into their deci

Simon argues that Frankfurter's
patriotism influenced his decision
in Minersville School District v.
Gobitis, denying a challenge by
Jehovah's Witnesses to a school
board regulation that required all
students to salute the American
flag.
Simon contends that
Frankfurter was "a patriot first
and last," and that this affected
his position. As an Austrian Jew
who came to this country as a
young boy, Frankfurter was grate
ful to his adopted home for allow
ing him to fulfill a version of the
American Dream. Where else in
1940 could an Austrian Jew rise
to become an esteemed member
of the law school faculty of a pro
minent university like Harvard,
an adviser to presidents, and, ul
timately, an associate justice of
the Supreme Court?
More important and persuasive
than such psychological hypot
hesizing is the book's exploration
of the two justices' opposing views
of the Court's proper role in a
democracy. As Simon clearly
shows, the two justices' views
were nearly antithetical and
paradigmatic. Black, the self
styled judicial advocate of the Bill
of Rights, was often exasperated
by Frankfurter, who believed that
in a democracy an activist
