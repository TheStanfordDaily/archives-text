The morning in 1982 when
Israeli armored columns swept
across the Lebanese border on
their way to what would be later
called "The Lebanon War," a
wave of exhilaration swept over
me and the country. Crushed
that Israeli friends only two
years older than I were par
ticipating in this wonderful ad
venture, I wan forced to make
do with tough talk about finally
"getting them" once and for all.
Three years later I did get a
crack at "getting them." But
after the painful siege of Beirut
and the Sabra and Shatilla mas
sacres Israel was wiser — our
unit rarely ventured from our
slim border enclave.
The dishonor of Israel's inva
sion and retreat from Beirut
with her grand strategic dreams
dead and buried with Bashir
Gemayel's mangled remains, is
one of the central themes in
Amos Oz's "The Slopes of
Lebanon."
Oz, one of Israel's most
prolific novelists and journalists,
wrote this recently translated
collection of essays, articles and
editorials during the war and
over the following four years.
The book combines keen insight
into the murky labyrinth that is
Israeli society with bitter sar
casm directed against the arch
enemies of the Israeli
intelligentsia. Throughout,
Menachem Begin, Ariel Sharon
and the nationalist-religious
crowd bear the brunt of Oz's
razor-sharp rhetoric.
Oz bitingly portrays Begin as
a frustrated opposition politician
finally come to power, obsessed
with avenging crimes committed
against the Jewish people in Eu
rope over 41) ago. Oz sug
only by reincarnating
nittcr in the person of Palestine
Liberation Organization chief
Yassir Arafat and then destroy
ing him with his own hands can
Begin lay his demons to rest.
Flushed with excitement at
the prospect of wielding Israel's
awesome military might after
years on the political sidelines,
Oz's Begin and friends gird their
loins and sally forth to do battle
with the PLO mini-state in
southern Lebanon. In the proc
ess they maliciously deceive the
Israeli Cabinet and public, and
force the once-proud Israeli mil
itary into morally questionable
acts of violence against Lebanese
and Palestinian civilians who
happened to be standing between
the PLO and Begin's wrath.
I vividly remember one event
described early on in the book.
It is early in the war. A sprightly
Begin, filmed by Israeli Televi
sion, lands in a helicopter near
the Beaufort crusader castle,
symbol of PLO power in south
ern Lebanon. The night before
an elite Israeli infantry unit hod
finally captured the fortress that
had defied tons of artillery and
air force ordinance over the
years.
Begin, visibly excited by the
residue of battle and trappings
of victory around him, proudly
demonstrates his military know

how by asking one soldier "So
what did they have here? Were
there automatic weapons?" The
soldier, having just completed a
savage night of hand-to-hand
combat against heavily armed
and desperate Palestinian guer
rillas, stared unbelievingly at the
eager old man in front of him.

that his government could later
erroneously declare that "no Is
raeli soldiers were killed taking
the Beaufort." A day or so later
I attended the funeral of a class
mate's brother who had died in
that battle. He was one of
several.
But Begin's most heinous
crime, in Amos Oz's eyes, is what
he did to Israel by entering into
the war as if it were a business
transaction, by choice and not
necessity: "This is the first time
for us that we go towards the
battlefield as if it were the stock
exchange: A good investment . . .
a cautious gamble . . . taking ad
vantage of an opportunity, a
'reasonable' risk."
I remember the debate that
rocked Israeli society during this
period: the demonstrations after
Sabra and Shatilla, the lethal
grenade attack on Peace Now
activists across from my parents'
home. I frequently passed by the

group of reserve soldiers re
leased from service camped out
side Begins residence with a sign
on which the constantly updated
Israeli casualty count was dis
played.
Some say that the evidence of
a "bad investment" finally pen
etrated Begin's cognitive wall
and brought about his resigna
tion and self-enforced isolation,

a voluntary exile upheld to this
day.
Amos Oz's views on Lebanon
may not be the most controver
sial of his arguments in this
book. Moving from Begin-and-
Sharon's slamming to more gen
eral observations on Israeli
society, Oz brilliantly describes
and then devastatingly criticizes
several trends that cause liberal
Israelis pain.
His attacks on the messianic
Gush Emunim (Bloc of the
Faithful) settlers, the ultra-
Orthodox and the general rising
tide of zealotry were relevant
and bitterly debated when writ
ten several years ago and are
even more relevant and hotly
contested today. His tongue-in
cheek proposal to give all these
elements, as well as the Pales
tinians, their own independent
states in tiny Israel has been a
standard joke of the Israeli left
for a while.

Oz's interpretation of Israeli
society is radically different from
the mythical view of a pioneering
nation, and may be one that
gives American Jews heartburn.
He envisions a large petite
bourgeoisie strata of Sephardim
(Jews of Middle Eastern and
North African descent), who are
conservative but not extremist,
traditional but not Orthodox.

This society, Oz suggests,
shaped by its Mediterranean en
vironment, is hopefully on the
way to becoming more relaxed
and somewhat tolerant and may
not allow the state to lurch into
a theocratic-nationalistic night
mare.
This view of Israel may seem
a bit far-fetched to some, but to
those familiar with the steak
and-kebab picnic crowd who fill
Israel's beaches and parks to the
last square inch every holiday,
it is not such a strange notion.
Admittedly, Oz's book is not
an easy read, especially for those
who do not have a rudimentary
knowledge of Israeli society. For
those who do h&ve such a grasp,
and never could really com
prehend the goings-on in that
strange land, this book is an in
valuable guide.
Primarily a collection of one
or two page articles published
in the Israeli leftist daily
"Davar," the book is difficult to
polish off in one sitting. Instead,
it should be read a little at a
time, in conjunction with a
valiant attempt to follow
present-day Israeli politics.
(Going a bit more in depth than

U.S. network news tends to do
might work wonders.)
Such a combination will drive
home the aptness of Oz's com
ments and their present-day
relevance. This is the magic of
Israeli politics: many articles writ
ten in 1983 sound like today's
newspapers. Another book of his,
"In the Land of Israel," is re
quired reading in one of the rare
seminars offered at Stanford this
quarter on the Arab-Israeli con
flict.
A sizable portion of the Israeli
population may despise Oz as a
"soft" intellectual, clinging to un
realistic and un-Middle Eastern
principles, pandering to the West
ern world's public opinion. But
this does not detract from the
weight of his arguments, and the
respect they are accorded by many
segments of the Israeli public.
Nevertheless there are several
articles whose relevance is elusive.
Perhaps it is Oz's vanity that
prompts him to indulge in rebut
tals of attacks made on him by
other intellectuals in the Israeli
press. These articles, and others
reviewing Israeli movies and
books may be safely ignored with
out detracting from the overall
worth of the collection.

emanating from his pen, really
loves the country. He loves it as
it actually is, not as people might
like it to be.
It is not a biblical land time
tunneled into the present. It is a
country of crowded and seedy
apartment blocks, not one of shep
herds roaming the hills of Judea
with a gun in one hand and a
plough in the other, spouting
quotes from the Old Testament.
It is an Israel that must learn to
live in its own cramped borders,
because it cannot afford to hold
on to those biblical hills at the
expense of one and a half million
Palestinians.
To those who from their distant
perch alternate between love and
hate, pride and more often shame
when Israel comes on the evening
news, this book is a must.
