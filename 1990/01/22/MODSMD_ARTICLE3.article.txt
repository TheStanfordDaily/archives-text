# USW leads picket at Webb Ranch
## Stable entrance blocked to protest living conditions of ranch workers 
### Michael Friedly Staff writer 
Displaying signs reading "Support
our need for housing" and "Honk for
support," the United Stanford
Workers led a picket line at Webb
Ranch Saturday to protest the living
conditions of ranch workers.
Beginning at 6 a.m., the picketers
eventually gathered about 25 people
to block the entrance to Webb Ranch
stables and pass out informational
flyers to those who entered the ranch.
The protest was targeted at com
munity members who use Webb Ranch
to stable their horses. Nineteen acres
of the 238-acre complex are devoted
to stables.
The USW hopes to put financial
pressure on Webb Ranch by rallying
horse owners to withdraw their horses
from the ranch, according to USW
steward Linda Crouse. Webb Ranch
proprietor Stanley Webb "thinks he
has horse owners in his pocket . . .

but if he takes [the USW] on in a
major fight, he'll be hit from all sides,"
Crouse said.
The picket was planned in part by
a coalition of students, faculty, church
leaders and USW members in a meet
ing with ranch workers last Wednes
day night. Leaders of the coalition
include graduate student Todd
Gaviglio and Prof, of Political Science
John Manley.
At least six of the ranch workers
picked up signs and joined the protest
during their lunch hour.
USW field representative Rodney
Barnette said the protest was gener
ally well-received by the public. The
USW even received a $50 check for
the workers from one woman who
crossed the picket line.
In addition to the stables, Webb
Ranch also grows berries and vegeta
bles and operates a roadside fruit
stand. In a flyer handed out to passing
drivers Saturday, the USW charged
Webb Ranch with trying to lay off the

ranch workers by focusing its business
on the stables instead of the agricul
tural work.
Since fewer workers are needed to
run the stables than to harvest the
vegetables, the Webbs would then be
able to lay off union members, several
of the workers said.
The Webbs had workers plant grass
for the horses over mofh of the
farmland, which may indicate a
greater concentration on the stable
business. Ranch officials said the
grass will be cut in the spring to make
way for new crops.
But the ranch workers claim that
the grass wil' take water and nutrients
from the .J, making the ground too
hard to plant crops in the spring. Put
ting the workers out of their jobs will
allow the Webbs to hire cheap labor
in two or three years, one worker said.

The United Stanford Workers organized approximately 25 people to block the entrance to the ranch's stables in
an effort to put pressure on the ranch owner.
December due to seasonal layoffs,
according to former Webb Ranch
worker Manuel Chavez. Six
workers who were not in favor of
joining the union in an election
last April were not laid off, Chavez
added.
No further protests are being
planned by the coalition, but that
could change depending on the ne
gotiations between the USW and
Webb Ranch, Barnette said. Al
though no bargaining sessions are
currently scheduled, the USW last
Thursday sent a letter to Webb
family attorney Terrence
O'Connor requesting another
meeting.
The last bargaining session on
Jan. 9 showed little progress, Bar
nette said.
Manley, who took part in the
protest, attacked University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy for his "un
conscionable position" on Webb
Ranch, arguing that "Stanford
has already gotten a black eye
nationally" for the treatment of
workers at Webb Ranch.
