## Sluggish Trojans succumb to surging Cardinal 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
When the Cardinal men's basketball
team took the floor at Maples Pavilion
Saturday afternoon the players knew
they had two obstacles to overcome. In
addition to the visiting USC Trojans, a
team that has given Stanford trouble
the past few years, the Cardinal had to
conquer the expected letdown after
beating No. 16 UCLA Thursday.

Luckily for Stanford, the letdown ap
peared to be the worse foe, as John
Patrick's three-point shooting and good
defense rallied the Cardinal to a 74-61
win.
Stanford improved to 12-3 on the
season, 4-2 and alone in third place in
the Pacific 10 Conference. The Trojans
fell to 6-8, 1-6.
Patrick finished with 17 points, one
fewer than the career-high 18 he had
Thursday, and hit four three-pointers
in the decisive first half. All of Stan
ford's starters finished in double figures
to offset 21 points from Ronnie Coleman
and 18 from Harold Miner.
"I thought in the first half we had a
natural reaction . . . and weren't at 100
percent emotionally," Cardinal Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "We just came
in with not quite the things you need."
Back-to-back layups by Miner gave
USC a 22-15 lead but Stanford closed,
trailing 34-32 at the half only because
Miner threw in a 24-footer at the buz
zer. An 8-0 run near the beginning of
the second half gave the Cardinal the
lead for good and Stanford continued
to pull away the rest of the half for the
team's 13th straight win over USC.
Adam Keefe scored 15 and Deshon
Wingate scored 12 for the Cardinal but
both were even more effective rebound
ing. Keefe had 12, including seven off
the offensive glass, and Wingate tied
his career high with 11.
Guard Kenny Ammann had 12, for
ward Andrew Vlahov had 11 and Derek
Bruton came off the bench for seven
points, including an impressive left
handed dunk following a missed shot.
Stanford only shot 37 percent

first half but an 18-9 rebounding edge
kept the Cardinal close. In the second
half Patrick and Ammann bombed over
the defense and the Cardinal held USC
to 37 percent.
"I think in the first half we just came
out slow," Keefe said. "We realized in
the second half that we'd get beat if
we didn't pick it up."
The Trojans tried to deny Keefe the
ball with a zone defense but, like against
UCLA, the Cardinal responded with
good outside shooting. USC also closed
on Keefe whenever he got the ball, not
always gently.
"I've definitely noticed as the year
goes on, every time I go through the
key I get one more bump per game,"
Keefe said.
Now, with Stanford third in the con

ference and holding a 12-3 overall
record, an NCAA Tournament berth is
looking possible in this "rebuilding"
year. "I think that Mike (Montgomery)
has done an outstanding job with this
team," USC Coach George Raveling
said. "I think at this point we would
have to consider Stanford a viable con
tender for an NCAA Tournament spot."
Stanford will have a tough time im
proving its record this week. The Car
dinal travels to Arizona Thursday night
where the Wildcats just beat No. 3 Okla
homa. That game will be televised in
the Bay Area on channel 2.
Stanford will finish the road trip by
meeting Arizona State Saturday night,
then will be on the road again the next
weekend to play Oregon and Oregon
State.
