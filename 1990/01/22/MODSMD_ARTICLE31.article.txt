### 
STANFORD (AP) John Nies of Arizona
kicked a 37-yard field goal, his third of the
game, with 10 seconds remaining to give the
West a 22-21 victory in the East-West Shrine
Game yesterday at Stanford Stadium.
John Friesz of Idaho completed five of six
passes for 46 yards in the winning drive as
the West, which never led before the winning
field goal, rallied to overcome five turnovers.
Fresno State cornerback James Williams
aided the West cause by blocking field-goal
tries in the second and third quarters and was
named the game's outstanding defensive
player.
Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice, trying
to impress NFL scouts who envision him as
a wide receiver, completed seven of 12 passes
for 153 yards and a touchdown for the East
and was honored as the top offensive player.
The East's other top-billed player, Indiana's
record-setting running back Anthony
Thompson, rushed for 68 yards on 13 carries,
including 60 in the second half.
The East appeared headed for its second
straight victory in the series when it took a
21-13 lead with 1:11 left in the third quarter
on a 1-yard touchdown run by Harold Green
of South Carolina. The score followed an in
terception by John Mangum of Alabama.
But California quarterback Troy Taylor
drove the West 68 yards and dove in from a
yard out with 5:13 remaining to make it 21-19.
His two-point conversion pass fell incomplete
in the end zone.
The West, aided by Washington nose guard
Dennis Brown's second sack, forced the East
to punt and took over on its 27 with 3:39 left.
The come-from-behind victory, in front a
record Shrine game crowd of 78,000 at Stan
ford Stadium, boosted the West's lead in the
series to 33-27-5.
Thompson, the Heisman Trophy runnerup,
gave the East a 7-0 lead on a 1-yard 11) run
following a 27-yard interception return by
Notre Dame's Patrick Terrell.
Taylor, alternating with Friesz, tied the
game at 7-all with 3:21 left in the half when
he ducked under onrushing lineman Rob Bur
nett of Syracuse and found UCLA tight end
Charles Arbuckle alone in the back of the end
zone for a 3-yard TD.
Rice, roaming out of the pocket often, di
rected an 80-yard scoring march at the end
of the first half to give the East a 14-7 lead
on a 25-yard TD pass to LSU wide receiver
Tony Moss with 34 seconds left. He completed
all four of his passes on the drive for 77 yards
and had a 26-yard play called back on a penalty.
The West got a gift three points moments
later after Vince Buck of (antral State mis
handled a punt and Steve Thompson of UC
Davis, a late roster addition, recovered on the
East 26 with six seconds remaining. Nies
lucked a 43-yard field goal on the final play
of the half to cut the East lead to 14-10, and
made it 14-13 on a 30-yarder midway through
the third period.
