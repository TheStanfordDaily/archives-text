# Patrick punctures zone

### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
After the game Saturday, USC
Coach George Raveling wanted to
give credit where credit was due, but
he didn't know the name of the
worthy recipient.
"The kid, number 11," was all
Raveling had on Stanford's John
Patrick after the junior point guard
had sunk his Trojans with 17 points,
including five three-pointers, five as
sists, and two steals.
Patrick blew open a close game in
the early second half by hitting two
deep three-pointers, then threw in
two more within a minute towards
the end of the half. The last two put
the game out of reach.
Playing all but four minutes of the
game, Patrick was effective in break
ing the USC press as well as shooting
the ball.
It is clear that Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery has confidence in
Patrick as a ball-handler and as quar
terback of the offense. Saturday af
ternoon, it looked like Patrick also
had the green light to shoot.

"He (Montgomery) gives everybody
the green light as long as they are
good shots," Patrick said.
Patrick has always strived for good
shot selection, but before this game,
his shooting accuracy had been very
inconsistent.
Against Oregon State, Patrick
drained 6-of-7 three-pointers for a
career-high 18 points. He also hit for
18 versus UCLA Thursday night. But
for the season, Patrick was shooting
only .352 from the field before USC.
Part of the reason for that low
mark had been complications from a
wrist injury that has now mostly
healed. Hampered by the bad wrist,
Patrick couldn't practice on his own
and lift weights as much as he would
have liked.
"I'm back into a routine now,"
Patrick said. "When I shoot, I expect
it to go in."
If his shots do continue to go in
like they did against the Trojans,
Patrick is sure to get some recogni
tion from opponents in the future.
"As the weeks go on, all the coaches
will know his name," Raveling said.
"If he keeps shooting like that, they'll
notice."
