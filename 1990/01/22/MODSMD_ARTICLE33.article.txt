# Women swimmers sink USC, No. 9 UCLA
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's swim team
has found a few new favorite numbers.
In addition to one, the team's national
rank; and four, the number of dual
meet wins the team has against no
losses, 91 and 49 are rapidly finding
favor too.
The Cardinal spent the weekend in
Los Angeles and must have enjoyed
it, defeating both llth-ranked USC
and ninth-ranked UCLA by identical
91-49 scores. The Trojans, Friday's vie-

Tim, are 5-5 after falling to California
Saturday. UCLA is 5-1 following their
loss to Stanford Saturday.

The Cardinal was led by freshman
Janet Evans, who returned to her na
tive Southern California to win five
events in the two meets. Friday she
won the 200-yard individual medley

and the 200 and 500 freestyles while
Saturday she won the 500 and 1000
freestyles.
Evans' time of 9:37.11 in the 1000
freestyle broke the school record by
more than seven seconds. Although the
event is not swum at the NCAA meet,
it is swum frequently at dual meets
throughout the course of the season
and that is where the previous record
was set by Marybeth (Linzmeier)
Dorst in 1984.
Senior diver Katie Connors also had
a successful weekend, winning both
the one- and three-meter events

against USC and taking the three
meter against UCLA. Melisa Kuller
took two seconds and two thirds and
Kristin Jensen had a pair of seconds
and one third in the weekend's four
diving events.
Also for Stanford Michelle Griglione,
Lori Heisick, Janel Jorgensen, Karen
Kraemer and Dede Trimble each won
two events, one on each day. The two
team captains, seniors Jill Johnson
and Susannah Miller, each won their
specialties once, with Johnson winning
