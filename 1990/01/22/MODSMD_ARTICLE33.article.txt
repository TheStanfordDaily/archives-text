# Women swimmers sink USC, No. 9 UCLA
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's swim team
has found a few new favorite numbers.
In addition to one, the team's national
rank; and four, the number of dual
meet wins the team has against no
losses, 91 and 49 are rapidly finding
favor too.
The Cardinal spent the weekend in
Los Angeles and must have enjoyed
it, defeating both llth-ranked USC
and ninth-ranked UCLA by identical
91-49 scores. The Trojans, Friday's vie-

Tim, are 5-5 after falling to California
Saturday. UCLA is 5-1 following their
loss to Stanford Saturday.

Cardinal 91, Trojans 49
Cardinal 91, Bruins 49

The Cardinal was led by freshman
Janet Evans, who returned to her na
tive Southern California to win five
events in the two meets. Friday she
won the 200-yard individual medley

and the 200 and 500 freestyles while
Saturday she won the 500 and 1000
freestyles.
Evans' time of 9:37.11 in the 1000
freestyle broke the school record by
more than seven seconds. Although the
event is not swum at the NCAA meet,
it is swum frequently at dual meets
throughout the course of the season
and that is where the previous record
was set by Marybeth (Linzmeier)
Dorst in 1984.
Senior diver Katie Connors also had
a successful weekend, winning both
the one- and three-meter events

against USC and taking the three
meter against UCLA. Melisa Kuller
took two seconds and two thirds and
Kristin Jensen had a pair of seconds
and one third in the weekend's four
diving events.
Also for Stanford Michelle Griglione,
Lori Heisick, Janel Jorgensen, Karen
Kraemer and Dede Trimble each won
two events, one on each day. The two
team captains, seniors Jill Johnson
and Susannah Miller, each won their
specialties once, with Johnson winning
the 200 breaststroke against USC
and Miller taking the 100 back
stroke versus the Bruins.
"I though our team swam out
of our minds," Heisick said. "I
think everyone swam really well
under the conditions. It was so
cold."
Heisick swam particularly well,
especially against UCLA where
she recorded two personal bests.
She swam in the second heat of
the 200 IM and recorded a time
of 2:06.82 and recorded a 2:16.13
in winning the 200 breaststroke.

Her personal best in the breast
stroke was 2:19.00 two weeks ago
but she broke it a week ago in
Michigan and took two more
seconds off it Saturday.
The two meets marked the
opening of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence season for the Cardinal.
Stanford will also meet Arizona
State and Arizona this Friday and
Saturday, and California Feb. 10
to close out the league dual-meet
season.
Stanford handily won all five
Pac-10 dual meets last year and
coasted to the school's third Pac-10
title in the three years the league
has sponsored a women's swim
ming and diving championship
meet.
