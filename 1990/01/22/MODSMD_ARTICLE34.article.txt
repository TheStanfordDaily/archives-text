# Undefeated Cardinal cagers whip Women of Troy

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Once upon a time, they said
USC's Cheryl Miller was the best
player in the land. Miller never
ceased to amaze and led the
Trojans to two NCAA crowns.
But that was then.
Nowadays, Stanford's Jennifer
Azzi is atop the heap and behind
her leadership the Cardinal has
its sights set on a national title.
When the past met the present
in USC's Lyon Center Saturday
night, the championship banners
were of no help to the Trojans as
Azzi's 17 points keyed a 98-64
Stanford blowout.

Cardinal 98

USC drew first blood on a
bucket by Joni Easterly. Azzi
quickly answered with a three
pointer and Stanford never trailed
again. The trey started a 9-0 Car
dinal run before Easterley scored
again to make it 9-4.
Over the next six minutes,
Stanford outscored USC 18-2 with
Katy Steding accounting for eight
of the Cardinal's points on two
threes and a layup. Down 27-7,
the Trojans called timeout with
11:25 left in the half. For all in
tents and purposes, the game was
already decided.
"We started out playing very
well," Coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "We were looking good
In the remainder of the half,
USC played Stanford even. Eas
terley was the Trojans main of
fensive weapon scoring eight
points in the final 11 minutes.
For the Cardinal, freshman Val
Whiting did most of the damage.
Whiting scored twice in the low
post near the 10 minutes mark

making the score 31-11. On the
Cardinal's next possession,
Whiting was the finisher on a fast
break. Then she grabbed an of
fensive rebound and layed it back
in. Stanford was up 35-13 thanks
to Whiting's eight straight points.
She scored again and pulled
down a couple of defensive
rebounds heading into the locker
room. At halftime, Stanford was
up 47-26. Whiting had 13 points
and five rebounds.
But the Cardinal's attack was
balanced. Azzi had nine, Steding
eight and Julie Zeilstra seven.
"Everyone was involved in the of
fense," VanDerveer said. On the
other hand, "[USC] had a lot of
problems running their offense."
The Trojans shot only 29 per
cent in the half and wouldn't pick
things up much in the second
stanza. USC cut Stanford's advan
tage to 14 at 53-39 and it appeared
they might get back into it.
But poor shooting and inade
quate defense allow the Cardinal
to open the lead to 68-47 when
USC Coach Marianne Stanley
drew a technical foul. Azzi hit
both free throws, Stacy Parson
buried an 18-footer and Stanford
was up 72-47.
The Cardinal used the big lead
as an opportunity to play its
reserves. VanDerveer said it "al
lowed people to get valuable ex
perience " She was referring
mostly to Martha Richards, Molly
Goodenbour, Chris MacMurdo
and Angela Taylor.
In the closing minutes, the only
question was whether Stanford
would crack the century mark.
Like Thursday's game with
UCLA, though, the Cardinal came
up two points short. It was one
of the few things that went wrong
in an otherwise excellent perform
ance.
