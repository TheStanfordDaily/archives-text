# Spikers top all-star alumni

### Harold Yu Staff writer 
You know the crowd is sparse
when you can hear the distant
jeering of players on the bench
more acutely than clapping in
the stands.
Yet the near non-existent fan
support Saturday at the 10th
annual alumni volleyball game
hardly dampened the spirits of
the 1990 men's varsity volleyball
squad.
Before the feature match
which pitted Stanford's current
team, ranked No. 1 in the na
tion, against an all-star group
of alumni, the alumni and var
sity players were shuffled to
form five teams of six players
each to compete in a round
robin tournament. Each squad
played four twenty-minute
games in the newly-adopted
running score format that
awards points regardless of
whether the team is on serve.
After a rigorously competitive
succession of games, team num
ber four, comprised of freshman
setter Jimmy Blackman, All-
American middle blocker Dan
Hanan, 1985 graduate Dan
Parr, Mike Lowe, 1970 graduate
John Burch and Robert Hillman
tied teams 1 and 3 in record,
yet prevailed as the round-robin
champion based on point differ
ential. They recorded impressive
game scores of 16-6, 16-7, 11-12
and 17-13.
The serene atmosphere that

pervaded the early mixed games
dissipated as the players
regrouped into their more
familiar camps to initiate the
best of three alumni-varsity bat
tle. Far more than pride seized
the attentions of the current
Stanford men's team as they un
officially placed their un
blemished record on the line
against an experienced alumni
club.
Led by 1988 Olympian Scott
Fortune, who currently plays for
the U.S. national team and is
training for the 1992 Games,
the Card's Most Inspirational
player in 1988 Dave Johnson
and former All-American Craig
Lauchner, the makeshift alumni
team commanded serious con
sideration from Coach Fred
Sturm.
The alumni jumped out to a
2-0 lead in the first game, but
hitter Duncan Blackman, who
finished with a game-high six
kills, catapulted the varsity
team to a 7-2 advantage. The
alumni, reigniting past flames
of brilliance, managed to scrape
vigorously back and tighten the
contest.
Brilliant hitting by David
Goss, who had five first game
kills, and thundering blocks by
Dan Hanan eventually decided
the game in the varsity's favor,
16-14.
Sturm inserted his reserve
team into the lineup in the sec
ond game, and the alumni con
tinued their strong play in a

15-13 victory.
The game nevertheless pro
vided memorable moments for
several players. The animated
John Bezmalinovic, commonly
referred to as Bez, culminated
a spectacular collection of plays
by blocking a scorching Fortune
shot to the floor. The feat
brought his teammates to their
feet in hoots of excitement.
Ryan Moos contributed the
most balanced performance of
the game, accompanying his
four kills with two critical blocks
and several searing jump serves.
The starting six returned in
the final game to terminate any
prospects of an upset and ac
cordingly defeated the alumni
15-13 in the rapid score format.
Middle blocker Craig Forsyth
dominated, delivering several
heated kills and blocks.
Despite the too-close-for
comfort outcome, Sturm was
notably pleased with the results
of the afternoon.
"We're in a situation where
any game time we can get is
going to help us very much,"
Sturm said. "We've been fairly
consistent in competition and I
know we're going to smooth out
the wrinkles and rough edges
with time."
Alumni opponents agreed.
Scott Fortune, who played for
last year's squad that finished
second in the nation, was im
pressed by both the team's per
formance and year-long pros
pects.
