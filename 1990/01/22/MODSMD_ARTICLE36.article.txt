# Golfers tee off winter season
## 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
In 1989 the men's golf team
served notice that it had arrived
at the threshold of joining the pre
eminent programs of collegiate
golf.
In 1990 the Cardinal linksters
seek to demonstrate that they are
capable of maintaining that level
of excellence. The first opportu
nity is today with the start of the
first round of the Southwestern
Intercollegiate in Los Angeles.
Stanford enters its initial event
of the winter season with tremen
dous momentum generated by its
sparkling performance in the fall.
The Cardinal captured team titles
in three of its final four tourna
ments.
Consecutive wins over the
Thanksgiving weekend cul
minated the quarter and
catapulted the team to a No. 11
national ranking in the latest Golf
World-Taylor Made Poll.
Coach Wally Goodwin revealed
a confident approach to the winter
season, inspired by the squad's
autumn achievements.
"Our goal this quarter is to win
three in a row," said Goodwin.
"You can't deny this team is ca
pable of winning. Because of that,
we're shooting for it all."
To secure a victory this week,
Stanford will need to overcome
both a demanding course and
challenging field.
The Northranch Golf Club
hosted the 1988 NCAA Champi
onships, a recognition of its level
of difficulty. Described by Good
win as "unforgiving," the

Northranch links demand preci
sion from tee to green.
The Cardinal faces important
Western foes in Los Angeles. All
twelve teams in the tournament
are members of Stanford's re
gional district.
Arizona, currently ranked sec
ond nationally, Fresno State and
host USC should provide Stan
ford's main competition for the
championship.
This event marks the only oc
casion until April in which the
Cardinal will compete against its
district rivals. To secure a post
season regional berth to the
NCAA Regionals in May, the Car
dinal needs to demonstrate it can
play at the level of these squads.
Sophomore Christian Cevaer,
junior Johan Remmelgas and sen
iors Don Christiansen, Marc Fun
seth and Steve White will

represent the Cardinal in South
ern California. These are the same
five players who posted the string
of autumn victories.
They have prepared for the
Southwestern by a grueling prac
tice schedule since early January.
According to Goodwin, the team
has enjoyed no days off since re
turning to campus from winter
break.
Cevaer, the Cardinal's consis
tent low player for the last two
seasons, is seeking to capture his
first personal win this year. When
asked to assess Cevaer's chances
this week, Goodwin responded
with nothing short of a ringing
endorsement.
For Cevaer and the Stanford
squad, a victory in the Southwes
tern would provide an idyllic way
to enter this new decade.
