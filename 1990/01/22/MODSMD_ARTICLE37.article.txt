### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
It took the Stanford wrestling team two
days to get to Humboldt State, but it was
certainly worth the trip. The Cardinal won
the match 34-6, improving it's dual meet
record to 7-2.

Stanford Coach Chris Horpel was ap
prehensive about the seven hour trip to
Areata, Calif. He expressed concern that
the team might not be able to stay focussed
after the demanding drive.
In order to eliminate any negative road
repercussions, Horpel decided to alter the
usual travel plans.
"This is the first time we divided the
drive up into two days," Horpel said. "It
made the travel not a factor."
The Humboldt State wrestlers were not
much of a factor either. The Cardinal won
eight out of the ten matches, two of them
by technical falls, one by injury default.
Perhaps the most satisfied wrestler of
the evening was Stanford's Ron Perry
(190). Perry, who is from Areata, returned
to his home town to dominate the Lum
beijack's Anthony Califano, 15-3. A well
executed back body-lock highlighted the
match.

Stanford's bastion of consistency, Steve
Buddie (177), won by injury default over
Paul House after leading 11-1.
"Buddie got him (House) in a mean half
nelson and injured either his shoulder or
his neck," Horpel said. Although House
could not continue in the match, the injury
did not appear to be serious.
Coach Horpel was especially pleased with
the performance of Dave Nowick, who won
the 118-pound contest over Mike Campbell,
9-1. "It was a match that was picked to
go either way," said Horpel. "Nowick set
a ferocious pace and Campbell couldn't
keep up."
A mild surprise came in the 158-pound
match. Matt Topham used his superior con
ditioning to defeat Lonyx Landry, 9-3.
Landry had previously defeated Topham.
"Topham's conditioning became a factor,
and he made Landry not want to wrestle
after two-thirds of the match," said Horpel.
The Cardinal received a slight scare in
the 142-pound division. James Dinette im
mediately found himself in a head-lock ren
dered by the Lumbeijack's Jason Buzzard.
However, Dinette responded to the chal
lenge and defeated Buzzard, 17-7.
The only place the Cardinal had any
trouble was in the 150 and heavyweight
classes. Geoff Baum (150) lost to Dean
Henderson by a score of 8-3, and Trent
Smith (heavyweight) was out-sized by Luke
Parham, 8-1.
The other Stanford winners were Josh
Lisle (126), Dave Sacks (134) and Mark
Graham (167).
