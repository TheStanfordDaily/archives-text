# Cardinal men swim lazy circles around UC-Davis
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
For the Stanford men's swim
ming team, Friday afternoon's
meet against UC-Davis provided
a nice atmosphere to kick back
by the side of deGuerre Pool and
chuckle as they watched their
teammates attempt to finish off
events with acceptable times.
After the Cardinal swimmers
had finished dominating the
Aggies by a 85-18 score, however,
the squad recognized that the
laid-back, swim-whatever-you
feel-like meets were over for 1990.

"We shouldn't have much trou
ble with the Arizonas this week
end," senior Lunn Lestina said.
"But we will no longer be able to
swim off-events and play with our
opponents."
Against the Aggies, like the pre
vious exhibition meet against the
Canadian National Team, before
the meet the Cardinal swimmers
got the chance to sign up for the

events in which they wanted to
compete. When numerous com
petitors were withdrawn from the
events moments before the start
ing signal, the sparse crowd at
deGuerre began to sense how
lightly the Stanford swimmers ap
proached this meet.
"A lot of the withdrawals were
people still in class," freshman
Chas Morton said. "We didn't
realize they weren't there yet."
For the swimmers who did dive
into the pool, the scoreboard
showed some respectable times for
off-events. In the 200 breast
stroke, Aggie Eric Holden swam
to UC-Davis' only victory of the
afternoon with a 2:11.36 time.
Cardinal breaststroker Kelly Par
sons followed with a 2:14.70, with
sophomore backstroker Jeff Rouse
finishing in an impressive
2:15.03.
"I was kind of surprised that
some of those people could even
swim the breaststroke," Morton
said.
Freshman sprinter Eric Maurer
surprised his teammates with a
strong swim in the 1650 freestyle.
Used to finishing his events in
under two minutes, Maurer swam
a 16:10.86 mile, less than a min
ute off the NCAA qualifying time.
