# Book traces history of Stanford BSU
## 
### Quan Phung Staff writer 
In commemoration of Martin Lu
ther King Jr.'s birthday and Black
History Month, the Black Student Un
ion has released "Justice and Hope,"
an 80-page book documenting the suc
cesses and struggles of black people
at Stanford over the last 20 years.
Authored by former BSU Chair and
Daily Multicultural Liaison Steve
Phillips, "Justice and Hope" traces
the BSU's active involvement in form
ing a more pluralistic Stanford from
the group's inception in 1967 to the
recent Louis Jackson controversy.
Jackson was one of more than 50
protesters arrested in last spring's
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office. Jackson's
supporters felt he was unjustly singled
out for prosecution by the Santa Clara
County district attorney.
Phillips said inspiration for writing
the book came last year after the Oc
tober 1988 Ujamaa incident, in which
posters in Ujamaa House were defaced
in racially offensive ways. "There was
a lot of confusion and lack of infor
mation about the history of the BSU,"
said Phillips.
Phillips found that many black stu
dents were not well-informed enough
about the history of the BSU to reply
to criticism from non-blacks. "It is

important to understand the context
that we are working from today," said
Phillips.
Consequently, Phillips dug out old
newsreels, old Dailies and old micro
fiche in Green Library, and talked
with black faculty and staff members
who were around when the BSU was
formed to compile his interpretation
of the group's last 20 years.
Phillips hopes that people of all
races will read the book and realize
that the BSU is not "a militant or
ganization, protesting just for the hell
of it. There's a lack of appreciation
for the positive role the BSU has
played," he said.
BSU Chair Calvin Martin also
believes the community at large does
not comprehend the positive impact
of black students, noting that 80 per
cent of BSU members participate in
some kind of community service proj
ect on campus.
Martin said he believes the BSU is
often wrongfully stigmatized by the
media as the instigator of protest
movements like last spring's takeover
of Kennedy's office.
While members of the BSU sup
ported the takeover, it was actually
the Asian American Students Associ
ation's bid for a Asian-American
studies tenure-track professor and
MEChA's desire for a democratically
elected Chicano dean which prompted

the bold action, according to Martin.
Martin said he hopes "Justice and
Hope" will refute some of those mis
conceptions about the BSU and place
the group in a more positive light.
Acknowledging that the book is both
a "historical tool and a political tool,"
Martin said he hopes that students
who read it will realize the importance
and necessity of a BSU at Stanford,
and hence will be more inclined to
vote for the group's ASSU special fee
assessment when the elections come
up spring quarter.
Martin, however, is only cautiously
optimistic about how much impact the
book will have, for he believes that
Phillips' interpretation included some
strong opinions which may be nega
tively received by the community at
large.
While he does not expect ultra
conservatives to change their opinion
of the BSU, Martin said he just hopes
those who read the book "will get a
different insight" into the BSU.
Keith Archuleta, assistant dean of
student affairs and director of the
Black Community Services Center,
added that " 'Justice and Hope' is an
appropriate and timely gift to the
Stanford Centennial. It comes at a
perfect time to meet the challenges of
multiculturalism in the next century."
Archuleta served as BSU co-chair in
1977-78.
