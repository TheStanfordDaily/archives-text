# Apple exec predicts future of the personal computer

### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
According to Jean-Louis Gass6e, a French
philosopher once said that cars are like
great Gothic cathedrals, created by pas
sionate artists for consumption by youth.
"I hope someday philosophers will write
something similar about computers," he
said.
Gass6e, the president of Apple Products,
a division of Apple Computer, Inc., spoke
about the future of personal computing in
Annenberg Auditorium Thursday after
noon.
"Late in the evolution of mankind,"
Gass6e began, "we got this strange gift
from the gods — the language of science.
With 26 little signs, we can talk about the
heights of religion and the lows of Wall
Street." Yet our central nervous system is
ill-equipped to deal with the language of
science, he said.
"How many phone numbers do you
know? How many lines of Shakespeare can
you remember?" he asked.
We are attracted to the personal com
puter because it breaches the chasms be
tween our competence and the language of
science, said Gass6e. "The raison d'etre of
the personal computer is to help us extend
the reach of our mind and our body."
Gass6e said the personal computer used
to be "a gadget for nerds." Looking into

the new decade, he hoped to see it in the
market of "normal people."
The significance of improvements in
speed, networking and programming will
be felt by the middle of the decade, said
Gass6e.
"Why speed? Because more of the same
is not the same. We believe new applications
will arise for personal computers just be
cause of the improvement in speed."
To illustrate the increasing significance
of networking, Gassee described the frus
tration that electronic mail users feel be
cause they cannot edit previous lines.
"Most electronic mail editors are written
by the KGB. They prevent you from chang
ing," he joked.
The wide application of integrated stand
ard digital networks will rectify this prob
lem, facilitate collaborative work and guar
antee a "data freeway" which is important
for the economy, said Gass£e.
Gass6e referred to programming as the
most interesting mystery of computer sci
ence. "Since language gives rise to
thoughts, the role of programming lan
guage is to foster thoughts in the mind of
the programmer," he said.
"Human beings in general want to pro
gram," said Gass6e, so its future should
be "the expansion of programming lan
guage to make that power more available."
They can then tell the computer to perform
tasks, Gass6e added.
