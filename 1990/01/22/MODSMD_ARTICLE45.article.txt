Future MBAs may want to take
careful note of the $2.97 million
in Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
grants for a new teaching and re
search consortium which will
study ways to improve the United
States' international economic
competitiveness.
Stanford, UC-Berkeley, Colum
bia, Harvard and MIT will each
receive funds over the next three
to five years to support interdis
ciplinary teaching and research
involving economics, manage
ment, engineering and other dis
ciplines.
At Stanford, the chief benefici
ary of the grants will be the Tech
nology and Economic Growth Pro
gram, which is now in its third
year as part of the Center for Eco
nomic Policy Research.
As Ralph Landau, codirector of
the program, sees it, the creation
of the consortium reflects the tre

mendous need "for business stu
dents to understand technology so
that they know when to use it."
It is not necessary for students
to know the technology in depth,
said Landau, but "they should un
derstand how important technol
ogy ig and how to use it properly,
as well as know both technology s
positive and negative aspects in
the world."
According to Landau, it is clear
that technology has played an im
portant part of growth in the
United States. The Sloan-funded
Consortium on Competitiveness
and Cooperation recognizes the
importance of this by bringing to
gether the sciences and engineer
ing with business.
With the new grant and con
sortium, Stanford and the other
universities aim to build better
bridges across disciplines and bet
ter prepare people to lead busi
nesses that will be more compet
itive in the international arena.
