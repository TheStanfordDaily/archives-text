## Intersorority Council votes for elimination of guaranteed bid system 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Sorority Rush will no longer
promise a bid to everyone who
participates, following a 5-2 In
tersorority Council vote in favor
of abandoning the guaranteed bid
system.
In the past, anyone who went
through all the required Rush
events was guaranteed a bid from
some sorority. Because of this sys
tem, sororities that did not meet
their quotas were obliged to ac
cept rushees who had not been
offered bids elsewhere.
Under the new Rush policy, so
rorities will no longer be required
to take any rushee they do not
want.
The new Rush system also
means rushees will no longer be
required to meet representatives
from every sorority. Instead, they
can choose which parties they
want to attend and which sorori
ties they want to rush, in a struc
ture more similar to fraternity
Rush.
According to Intersorority Rush
chair Liana Koontz, "The party
structure will be the same, but
girls will receive invitations from
a sorority" instead of the list of
required parties that was handed
out in the past.
Gamma Phi Beta president

'Even though it sounds elitist, in ac
tuality [the old system] was just as elite.
Now, we're correcting it by letting
people know what we really think.'

Dawn McGuiness said, "In the
past, a sorority had to accept a
woman they didn't like and
[sometimes] both ended up un
happy."
McGuiness said sororities were
obligated to invite all rushees dur
ing the first two nights of rush
under the old system. As a result,
no one really knew how the
sorority felt about the rushees.
Kari Murnane, Pi Beta Phi
president, said the Pi Phis origi
nally wanted to preserve guaran
teed Rush because it was "nicer
on the girl's feelings," but she
thinks the unguaranteed system
"is more honest."
Under the new system, a
woman in whom the sorority is
not interested "won't be invited
back from the start," so she will
know exactly where she stands,
McGuiness said.
"This makes Rush a lot clearer,
even though it sounds elitist. In
actuality [the old system] was just

as elite. Now, we're correcting it
by letting people know what we
really think," McGuiness said.
Kappa Kappa Gamma president
Carolyn Shaw said "sororities
with the worst returns are the
ones who wanted to change (the
bid system)," because under the
old system, those sororities were
required to take rushees they
didn't want.
Pi Beta Phi and Kappa Kappa
Gamma, two sororities that tradi
tionally have met their Rush
quotas, voted against the change.
Shaw said "the old system was
really nice because it didn't in
timidate girls, but this year, if
you get in, it means the sorority
really wants you."
According to Koontz, all Rush
chairs, Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Michael Hughes and an alumni
adviser to the ISC "got together
and drew up the proposal "
Hughes was unavailable for
comment.
