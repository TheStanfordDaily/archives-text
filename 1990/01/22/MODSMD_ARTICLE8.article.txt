"The potential of America is not
packed away in silos, it's packed
away in classrooms across the na
tion," said former National Edu
cation Association President Mary
Hatwood Futrell in the keynote
address of the weekend's You Can
Make a Difference Conference.

Futrell promoted education as
a national interest, crucial to the
political and economic growth of
the United States. She described
education as a factor that enabled
the United to rise to the
top.
"In the past, our nation's in
dustrial strength seemed to be
enough to guarantee that we, as
nation, would be a leader of the
world. .. . But today .. . these
things are not enough to guaran
tee our prosperity or our liberty.
.. . We must come to grips with
the fact that competitors are
taking our place and the main
weapon they are using is educa
tion," she said.
"We need to be true to the ideals
that helped us become a great
nation. And one of those ideals
was that every one would have
an opportunity to have a quality
education," Futrell said.
She described many of the
crises affecting the national edu
cational system, such as the in
creasing number of student
dropouts — especially among mi
nority students, — federal budget
cuts, young children prematurely
sent to school due to the lack of
child care programs and rampant
poverty among children.
Raised in a single-parent home
herself, Futrell spoke of the per
sonal sacrifices her mother made
to keep her children together and
to ensure that they received a
quality education. "We were told,
'You can learn — and if you want
a better life, you must learn.' "
Futrell emphasized the neces
sity of involving teachers in the
reform of the educational system.
"Teachers are treated as very tall

children, to be seen and not to be
heard. We are the ones in the
classroom with the students every
day. We know what the problems
are ... let us help with the solu
tions!"
She demanded that teachers
should receive a starting salary of
at least $25,000 a year, which
would draw people back into the
teaching profession and raise the
quality of education.
With the increasing number of
bilingual students attending
American schools, Futrell ad
dressed the present language
conflict in schools. "The English
only movement is a very patriotic
concept, but we have to be careful
that it doesn't turn into a very
bigoted concept. We should teach

our students standard English,
but we can do so without dis
criminating or demeaning some
one else's culture."
Futrell continued, "I'm always
amazed when we spend billions
teaching elementary school stu
dents how to forget another lan
guage. In junior high school, I'm
amazed how we spend billions
teaching students another lan
guage."
Futrell called on the large au
dience to put forth individual ef
forts to help improve national
education. She stressed the neces
sity of community involvement
and caring. "You can find time to
reach out and help somebody. All
it will take is a little time."
