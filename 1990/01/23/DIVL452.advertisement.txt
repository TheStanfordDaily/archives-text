We're holding an
unbeatable hand.
Teradyne, a half
billion dollar leader in the
high tech field, stands apart
from all the other players in
the world market. We're big
enough to stay in the game
as the stakes are raised, yet
we're still informal enough
to allow you flexibility and
freedom.
And what a hand we hold.
In our Automatic Test Equipment
businesses, we're a leading player in
virtually every market, from board test to
component test. When you need to test the
latest product, you talk to Teradyne first.
Our Electronic Design Automation business is bringing our technology to
market in this fast growing software arena, producing state-of-the-art products
used in engineering design analysis and test of complex electronic systems.
We're also the world's largest merchant producer of backplane connection
systems. These systems are vital in the development of tomorrow's military
and commercial electronics products.
And Teradyne is the world's leading independent manufacturer of telephone
network test systems. As voice and data merge, we'll be there to provide test
solutions for the telecommunications industry.
Teradyne has facilities in some of the country's most desirable areas, and close
to most of the nation's major learning centers.
To keep our unbeatable hand as the world game gets tougher, we need talented
people with new ideas. For more information, visit your Placement Office.
