STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS
WITHIN SCIENCE
First International Conference
February 17-18, 1990 Cole Hall, UC San Francisco
What is mind? What is consciousness? Developments in a variety of fields in this century
including quantum physics, artificial intelligence, biology and neurosciences seem to indicate
that a thorough grasp of the nature of mind and consciousness may be necessary even to

including two Nobel Laureates, will discuss these topics of lasting human intrigue from the
viewpoint of science.
