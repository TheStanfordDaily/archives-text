# Drug raid tipoff suspected
## Students may have known about AD search 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Stanford Police believe that
their drug raid of the AD House
last Friday failed because students
in the house were tipped off by
someone in the University admin
istration prior to the search.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said anonymous infor
mation that he received today sug
gests that someone within the
house, possibly one of the resident
assistants, received information
about the raid from the Univer
sity and informed the students
whose rooms were searched.
Niemeyer said the Office of Res
idential Education learned about
the raid around 5 p.m. Friday,
when police officers obtained a
master key for the AD House.
He said the police generally try
to obtain a master key when
searching rooms or buildings to
avoid having to open doors for

cibly in older buildings.
Niemeyer said he believes that
in the process of obtaining the
key, various officials in Residen
tial Affairs were alerted.
The police are still investigating
exactly what happened from this
point, but they believe that some
one within the Office of Student
Affairs called someone in the
house and told him or her about
the raid.
Niemeyer noted that anyone in
the house who knew in advance
about the raid and tipped off the
students whose rooms were raided
could be charged with obstructing
justice. He said the police would
present the information they find
in their investigation to the dis
trict attorney for possible prose
cution.
The raid was originally planned
after an unsolicited caller told
police about alleged drug dealing
in the AD House, Niemeyer said.
The informant, who remained

anonymous, purchased drugs in
the AD House and then called the
police, Niemeyer said. The infor
mant identified two specific rooms
and the individuals involved in
the drug sale.
Niemeyer said the informant
was personally opposed to the use
of drugs and speculated that he
or she may have been motivated
to report the drug dealing to the
police as revenge against the
dealers.
Niemeyer said the call was re
ceived late Friday morning. Dur
ing the day on Friday, officers
working on the case presented
their findings to the district at
torney, who was able to obtain a
search warrant for the two rooms.
Based on the tip from the in
formant, the police were looking
for a large quantity of marijuana
and cocaine, approximately "a
duffel bag full."
