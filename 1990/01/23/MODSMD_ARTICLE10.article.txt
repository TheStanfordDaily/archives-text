# Stanford results from nationwide poll:
## Freshmen rate themselves highly 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
Stanford freshmen work less, party less and think
they are more popular with the opposite sex than
do their counterparts nationwide, according to a
survey released yesterday.
The survey, conducted by the American Council
on Education and UCLA's Higher Education Re
search Institute, revealed that more than 99 percent
of Stanford's current freshmen rated themselves as
above average or in the highest 10 percent in aca
demic ability, compared to a national average of 85
percent.
The "work hard, play hard" ethic actually does
not exist at Stanford, if Stanford's figures are com
pared with national numbers. About 23 percent of
Stanford freshmen reported working six or more
hours per week, while nationally the figure was 47
percent. And while 32 percent nationally reported
partying more than six hours a week, only 15 percent
on the Farm did.
Stanford is more racially diverse than many other
schools in the United States, the figures indicate.
White students constitute 66 percent of Stanford's
class of 1993, whereas the nationwide figure is 82
percent.
How do Stanford students esteem themselves in
terms of popularity with the opposite sex? About
50 percent of freshmen rated themselves above
average or in the highest 10 percent, compared to
only 46 percent nationwide.
This year's freshmen are also noticeably more
liberal than their counterparts nationwide. Asked
their political views, 38 percent considered them

selves liberals, almost 10 percent higher than their
peers nationwide.
About 79 percent at Stanford agreed to legalized
abortion, while 65 percent nationwide did. And 13
percent at Stanford condemned homosexual rela
tions, compared to 33 percent nationwide.
About 30 percent of Stanford freshmen have no
religious preference whatsoever, compared to 14 per
cent across the nation.
The results of the survey are based on the re
sponses of 216,362 students at 403 of the nation's
two- and four-year colleges and universities.
When the 1989 freshman survey is compared with
the 1989 senior survey conducted by the Consortium
On Financing Higher Education, Stanford students
have shown a remarkable change in career direction.
When the class of 1989 entered Stanford, 22 per
cent desired to become physicians; only 15 percent
of the 1989 freshmen have such a goal. A similar
trend can be observed for potential engineers â€” 16
percent for 1985 freshmen, 10 percent for 1989
freshmen.
The criteria for career choice have not changed
significantly over the years. Intrinsic interest in the
field is still a top priority. About 93 percent of 1989
freshmen considered it very important or essential,
compared to 92 percent of 1989 seniors.
About 84 percent of 1989 Stanford freshmen re
ported having performed volunteer work during the
past year. About 41 percent of last year's graduating
class had performed public or community service
occasionally, 22 percent frequently. About 45 percent
considered their volunteer service opportunities at
Stanford very satisfactory.
