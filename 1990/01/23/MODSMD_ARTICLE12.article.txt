## Bush backs pro-life group 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush assured tens of thou
sands of anti-abortion demonstra
tors yesterday that "this president
stands with you," as both foes
and supporters of legalized abor
tion marked the 17th anniversary
of the landmark Roe vs. Wade
Supreme Court decision.
Bush, declaring his own "deep
conviction" against the court
ruling that legalized abortions,
spoke for just 90 seconds by tele
phone hookup to a midday crowd
of marchers who gathered at the
Ellipse across from the White
House.
"Before you begin the march, I
want to take a minute to share
my deep personal concern about
abortion on demand, which I op
pose," Bush told demonstrators,
saying the anti-abortion move
ment reminds Americans "of the
self-evident moral superiority of
adoption over abortion."
"Let me assure that this pres
ident stands with you on this issue
of life," he said.
Meanwhile advocates of legal

abortion celebrated the anniver
sary of the 1973 Supreme Court
decision at a luncheon fund-raiser
and in an earlier ceremony on the
Mall remembering women who
died as a result of illegal abor
tions.
"The public is on our side," said
Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., a
supporter of legal abortions. "It
will be a cutting-edge issue in this
year's elections."
The anti-abortion demonstra
tors marched up Pennsylvania Av
enue to the U.S. Capitol and Su
preme Court after hearing Bush,
some members of Congress and
other speakers. The U.S. Park
Police estimated the crowd at
75,000; the annual march drew
an estimated 67,000 people last
year.
Similar anti-abortion rallies and
pro-choice demonstrations were
held around the country Monday.
"What we're going to do is show
to America that pro-life America
is here, awake, that we will not
have the women's libbers' death
marches in our country," said

Nellie Gray, president of the
March for Life.
This year's anti-abortion march
took on added intensity, coming
amid the fresh political battles
over abortion triggered by a Su
preme Court decision last summer
that gave states new authority to
impose some limits on abortion
rights.
Even as Bush spoke, the
Planned Parenthood Federation
was urging Americans to call the
White House to register their sup
port for legal abortions. A group
calling itself Republicans for
Choice held a small rally outside
the Republican National Commit
tee headquarters.
Leaders of the National Right
to Life Committee, a leading anti
abortion group, praised Bush for
remaining firmly opposed to abor
tion and said they had no differ
ences with Republican National
Chairman Lee Atwater, who has
said the party is open to candi
dates on both sides of the abortion
debate.
