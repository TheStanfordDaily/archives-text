EAST BERLIN (AP) - Communist
Premier Hans Modrow agreed yesterday
to open his Cabinet to the pro
democracy opposition, and former
leader Egon Krenz apologized for his
role in past secret police operations.
Modrow and Krenz spoke during ne
gotiations on East Germany's future
government with the opposition groups,
which immediately took up Modrow's
offer.
Pro-democracy activists took to the
streets at least eight cities after
nightfall, with more than 100,000
demonstrating in Leipzig against the
Communists. The official ADN news
agency reported other protests in Berlin,
Cottbus, Dresden, Halle, Potsdam,
Schwerin and Suhl.
Modrow bowed to pressure to rebuild
his 27-member Cabinet, which previ
ously excluded all but the Communists
and its traditional allies.

The leadership, which replaced Com
munist hard-liners last year during a
peaceful popular revolt, has been trying
to appease an opposition movement that
is upset with the pace of promised re
forms. Modrow's move came one day
after the No. 2 figure in the Communist
Party quit and joined the Social Dem
ocrats.
Until yesterday, reformist groups
such as New Forum, Democratic
Awakening and the Social Democrats
formally had resisted joining Modrow's
government, partly out of fear that they
would then be held responsible by voters
for the economic mess left by four
decades of Communist rule.
The Social Democratic leader,
Ibrahim Boehme, said a coalition was
possible "if all parties and groups are
prepared to enter the government on
an emergency basis, without weeks-long
negotiations."

Modrow proposed the political forces
meet tomorrow to consider a new
Cabinet. But he did not make clear
which or how many ministries might
be offered to the opposition.
Communists hold 16 of the 27 seats,
with the remainder divided among four
parties once allied with them — the
Liberal Democrats with four, Christian
Democrats with three and two each for
the National Democrats and the farm
ers' party.
East Germany's first free elections
are to be held on May 6, but broad
differences between the Communist
dominated government and opposition
groups have delayed economic reform
measures and hindered the transition
to democracy.
Krenz, who was ousted from the lead
ership Dec. 3 and expelled by his party
Sunday, apologized for the "old security
doctrine" he imposed on the country.
