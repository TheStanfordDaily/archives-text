JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) - Coast

nature clean up the estimated 57,600
gallons of gasoline that gushed into
Alaska's island-studded Inside Pas
sage from a grounded tanker.
The Canadian-owned tanker Frank

ing on "a judgment error," Coast
Guard spokesman Ed Moreth said.

NEW DELHI, India (AP) - The
Swedish company A.B. Bofors and
unidentified officials in the govern
ment of former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi were charged with bribery
yesterday in connection with a $1.4

Congress Party lost the November

elections, would be among those ques
tioned.
Palestinian released

In a related matter, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir threatened to resign

right-wing Likud bloc. Likud leaders
will meet next month on motions by
hard-liners that Shamir's peace plan
be dropped.

agement vacuum" in the mayor's ab
sence.
Political alliance created
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Pres
ident Roh Tae-woo said yesterday that
his governing party and two moderate

and create a new popular party of
moderate democratic forces to meet
the needs of the times," Roh said in
a televised address after a 10-hour
meeting with opposition leaders Kim
Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil.
The alignment boosted the chances
of Kim Young-sam coming to power
after Roh steps down in February,
1993 at the end of a single five-year
term.
