# Azerbaijan mourns losses

### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Hundreds of thou
sands of wailing, black-clad Azerbaijanis
marched through Baku yesterday to
mourn people killed when Soviet troops
put down a nationalist revolt, and the
republic's legislature threatened seces
sion if Moscow did not pull out its sol
diers.
In another move in defiance of Pres
ident Mikhail S. Gorbachev, local legis
lators declared Moscow's state of emer
gency void, and militants vowed to keep
up crippling strikes until troops leave.
Also yesterday, Communist leaders
from Soviet Armenia and Azerbaijan

took a tentative step toward ending 10
days of ethnic warfare, agreeing to with
draw armed groups from areas along
their border, Tass said. But activists in
Armenia and Azerbaijan said they were
skeptical that the truce would be kept.
The official Soviet news agency re
ported that 12 more people were killed
in ethnic clashes Monday on the border
of the two republics, raising the toll
since Jan. 13 to 167. Soviet officials said
83 of those were from the Soviet assault
on the Azerbaijani capital on Saturday
or skirmishes the previous day.
More than 500 have been wounded in
the conflicts.

A human road block is formed to block the passage of Soviet tanks on the
road to Ganja, Azerbaijan. Azerbaijanis called for the withdrawal of Soviet
forces, and threatened to secede.
