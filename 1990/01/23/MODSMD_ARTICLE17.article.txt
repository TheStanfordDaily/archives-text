## Make a difference 
### 
Students must carry
the burden of improving
their education

MORE THAN EVER, Stan
ford students should trans
form this year's You Can
Make a Difference conference into
one that actually makes a differ
ence.
The topic of "a changing educa
tion for a changing world" has
played itself out here in the past
few years, most notably with the
change from Western Culture to
Cultures, Ideas and Values, to in
corporate the backgrounds of the
wide variety of cultures that shape
American life.
Stanford students have taken it
upon themselves to push changes
in those educational values to more
accurately reflect today's society.
Last year's March on Sacramento
showed student commitment to
these ideals, as many students
statewide called on the state's of
ficials to live up to the "Educa
tional Bill of Rights."
But more needs to be done, and
more students need to get involved
in the fight for better education
in the United States.
The solutions to many of the
nation's problems — poverty, crime
and illiteracy — lie in education.
That education must be equally
accessible to all and must provide
the basic skills necessary for stu
dents to make it in the "real
world."
President Bush has pledged to
be the "education president," but
the recent cuts of $65 million in
financial aid cut into the faith the
nation has in his fulfillment of the
role.

National and state legislatures
have failed to take control of the
educational ball and make serious
reforms where needed, while
bolstering programs that need
more financial support. That re
luctance is often because of con
stituencies that are more worried
about an increased tax burden than
about the quality of education and
the nation's future workforce.
That appears to leave students
with the burden of improving our
educational system — and as the
people most closely affected by it,
students have proven to be very
willing to lead the way.
In addition to making govern
ment officials aware of their views,
Stanford students can take an ac
tive role in improving education
through several opportunities that
currently exist — or by creating
new ones.
Several tutoring projects led by
students help kids in East Palo
Alto schools with their work and
also give them a better sense of
the value of an education.
Here at Stanford, changes are
taking place that students could
get involved with. Becoming a
member of a University committee,
working on the ASSU's Committee
on Democracy in Education or
talking with a professor about how
to improve the content of a course
are only a few ways to improve
education here.
Getting involved beyond the
scope of Stanford can help spread
the improvements — discussing
changes or new ideas with school
officials in your local community,
talking to students at other schools
about improvements and helping
statewide or national organizations
that lobby for better education.
There are many improvements
that can and need to be made.
