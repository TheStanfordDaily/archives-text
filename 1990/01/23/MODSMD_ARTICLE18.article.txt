Consider consequences before taking ASSU refunds

I AM WRITING on behalf of the
directors of several funded groups
on campus to express our regret
and concern with the growing trend
among students to misuse fee refunds
from the ASSU. This is also an appeal
to each student to think before they
cross off refunds from their ballot
during these next two weeks.
Unlike most other universities,
Stanford has an elaborate system to
allow its students to claim refunds
from quarterly contributions to various
student organizations. This, ideally, is a
truly democratic system that allows
students to withdraw monetary support
from activities they do not agree with.
Unfortunately, our democracy is
falling short of its goals. Too often
people are taking money back from
student groups for financial reasons

alone without realizing the harm done
to the entire community in the process.
Last quarter saw the worst setbacks
the ASSU has seen in recent history.
The Asian American Student Associa
tion lost 51.4 percent of their funds for
the quarter. The Black Student Union
lost 46 percent of its resources, and
KZSU lost 43 percent. And almost
every other funded student group on
campus (the Graduate Student Associa
tion, Concert Network, SURE Escort
Service, Club Sports, MEChA, Barrio
Assistance, the Stanford Band, the
Women's Center and X-TV) lost approx
imately 30 percent of their budget for
autumn.
Since groups are only allowed to
budget in a 25 percent "projected
fee-refund loss," these large and impor
tant student groups will have to cut

back on the services and programming
that they normally do. This will cer
tainly have adverse affects on our
community.
I am not sure how we can carry on
with activities for the student body
under constant fear of losing up to 25
percent or even more of our money.
This is particularly distressing for my
own organization, Speaker's Bureau,
which now has more requests by stu
dents for co-sponsorship of speakers
than ever before. We cannot possibly
meet the demand if our relatively
small budget is cut even further.
However, this is contradictory to
expectations from last spring's elec
tions. For example, the Speakers
Bureau received support from about 85
percent of the voters last spring. It is
ironic, then, that two weeks into the

quarter we lost 32 percent of our
funds from refunds to the very people
who voted in spring.
The ASSU has given the student
body a special democratic power by
allowing them to conscientiously object
to student groups by refusing them
funding. The students, however, have
the responsibility to be consistent with
their choices.
I urge you to consider the conse
quences of your action — in lost pro
gramming and services — before you
request a refund from any group. We
can turn this alarming situation
around if we take responsible action
for the remainder of the year.
