# Stanford-operated phone system will be expensive hassle
## 
### 
In all the residences by this fall,
Stanford plans to replace Pacific Bell
with a Stanford-operated residential
phone system — a system similar to
the one currently used in Roble Hall.
Stanford will bill residents for all
services: connection charges, call
waiting, local and long distance phone
calls, etc., and Stanford will determine
students' long distance carrier. Dis
counted long-distance calling plans will
not be available, i.e. AT&T's Reach
Out America. Since Stanford owns the
land and residences — its private prop
erty — they can do whatever and
charge whatever they want for phone
service, just like Holiday Inn.
I find it extremely troublesome that

Stanford, with its bureaucratic record,
will be billing residents for yet another
service. Communication Services claims
that their costs will be competitive.
However, Stanford also uses the
word competitive with its tuition, room
and board rates, and we all know
Stanford's track record on containing
costs and being competitive. There is
no advocate on campus with the power
to regulate residential phone rates, like
the Public Utility Commission does for
Pacific Bell.
Pacific Bell has been giving me great
service. Stanford's residential phone
system will cost more than Pacific
Bell, be more of a hassle to use and
have less features. I want to keep
Pacific Bell and AT&T as my phone
system providers. Pacific Bell is not
broke, so it shouldn't be replaced.
Communication Services is taking
input from students on the telephone
system profile that will be implemented
this fall. The profile will be released

March 1. I urge all residents to call
the residential help line, 497-HELP,
get information on the coming tele
phone system and tell them what you
think. Become informed consumers.
