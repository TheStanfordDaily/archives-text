# Lake Lagunita is special tradition and can't be priced
## 
### 
The ASSU is uninformed about the
merit of filling Lake Lagunita. It is a
classroom, a biological experiment, a
Stanford recreational tradition and an
important resource.
The article stated that $22,000 was
needed for a lifeguard alone. Well, at
$10 an hour, 8 hours a day, 7 days a
week for 3 months, guard service

amounts to only $6,720.00.
In any case, the lake benefits are in
economic terms "irreducible," and
Sandra Ideal's statement that "Nobody
seems to be feeling sad" does not, by
my informal survey, represent the
prevailing attitude of the students she
purports to reresent.
