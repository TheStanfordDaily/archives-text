## Education before action 
### 
WALT DISNEY IS a sexist and a
bigot. Boycott Disneyland and
throw away all your Mickey
Mouse watches. Planning a trip to Epcot
Center? Bag it. Don't support racism and
sexism.
Why is Walt Disney so evil? If you have
to ask why, then surely you haven't seen
"The Little Mermaid." This is a movie
which perpetuates the most horrifying of
our social myths. Everyone in the film
is white and blue-eyed. All the men are
good, and most of the women are evil.
The only women who are good are those
who submit to their men.
Why bother to do a social analysis of
"The Little Mermaid?" Isn't it just a
kids' film? Children will never notice that
everyone is white. But perhaps that's the
biggest problem. It's not that someone
should have rewritten "The Little Mer
maid" to include characters of other eth
nic backgrounds. It's more that there are
very few fairy tales which deal with other
cultures.
Why not take Native American myths
and African folklore and translate them
to movies? Without paradigms from other
cultures, children will never recognize
what a white, Anglo-Saxon world they
live in.
Unfortunately, boycotting Walt Disney
will not force the company to make films
about other cultures. It has too many
other ways to make money. Boycotting
can be an easy and radical way out, but
also a way to avoid dealing with the
problem. To my knowledge, no one has
supported a boycott of the film, and I
hope no one does. It's an emotional tale

of finding one's individuality.
But what about all the boycotts that
are occurring nowadays? We're supposed
to avoid Domino's pizza because the
owner supports anti-abortionists. We're
supposed to boycott Jack-in-the-Box be
cause they discriminate against custom
ers. And of course we're supposed to
boycott Exxon because of the Valdez in
cident.
Then more questions arise. What if I
save so much with a Domino's pizza that
I can afford to give $2 from every pizza
toward the pro-choice movement? Surely
Domino's can't afford to give $2 from
every pizza to the anti-abortion move
ment. In this case which movement am
I helping? Should I avoid Domino's pizza
purely as a symbol of my support for a
woman's control over her own body, or
am I actually trying to financially hurt
the company?
With Exxon the boycott is somewhat
relevant. People are supposed to boycott
oil products because Exxon did not act
responsibly in cleaning up its oil spill.
It's doubtful that there are enough con
cerned consumers nationwide to affect
Exxon's profits, but I have noticed that
Exxon stations in the areas tend to have
fewer customers.
In the case of Domino's, the tenuous
connection is between pizza and abor
tions. Since Domino's is a franchise, I
would suspect most of the money which
the owner gets is not from profits but
from flat fees from people who pay to
use the company's name and equipment.
What scares me is that many of the
boycotters are fashionable liberals, the

type of people who hear Amnesty Inter
national and think of the rock concert,
not the organization. They hear about a
cause and follow someone else's lead
blindly.
As far as I know, all three boycotts
may be justified, or maybe none of them
are justified. I really don't know, and I
suspect many people who participate in
them don't know. But maybe by par
ticipating, people are lulled into the idea
that they're actually doing something to
help the situation.
This is the danger. What would be
more useful than boycotting is iearnfcg
a little bit about the conflict and acting
to correct it. Write a letter to Disney
Studios asking them if they've considered
children's stories from other cultures.
Donate time to pro-choice campaigning
to do penance for those Domino's pizzas.
Of course, these options may not get
that much accomplished either, but they
would force one to know more about the
problem. They would force education
before action. Boycotts can be useful
sometimes, but without knowing the sit
uation, one often can do more harm than
good.
