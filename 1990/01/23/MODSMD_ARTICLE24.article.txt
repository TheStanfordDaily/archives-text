Pro-choice struggle
rekindled in memory
of Roe v. Wade
Jan. 18 was the 18th anniversary of
the Roe v. Wade decision — the
landmark Supreme Court ruling up
holding a woman's rights to privacy
and reproductive freedom. The decision
itself finally legalized abortion after
years of women being held hostage by
the government's power over their
bodies and lives.
Abortion has been illegal in the
United States only in this century. In
the years preceding the Roe v. Wade
decision, thousands of women had
risked or lost their lives in back alley
operations in order to terminate un
wanted pregnancies.
Irrespective of whether the preg
nancy had resulted from accident or
rape, women in need of an abortion
were victims of the exorbitant fees and
unsanitary medical practices of illegal
abortionists and of the possibility of
blackmail or prosecution.

All of us owe an ex
traordinary debt to
Jane Roe and the
lawyer who took up
and embattled an al
most impossible case.

All of us owe an extraordinary debt
to Jane Roe — the name taken by a
woman confronted with pregnancy and
no prospect of being able to support
and nurture a child — and the lawyer
who took up and embattled an almost
impossible case.
Today it is particularly urgent to
remember these women and the thou
sands of people who have protested on
behalf of women's right to choose. Anti
choice forces have become increasingly
vocal and powerful in the past eight
years, succeeding in limiting access to
abortion and in jeopardizing funding
for family planning throughout the

nation.
Paying our debt to Jane Roe and her
lawyer, to the women who have died
from botched abortions and to the
children born of parents who cannot
take care of them, we have no choice
but to support a woman's right to her
own self-determination.

Proposed drinking
rule is ridiculous
and not really fair
I was most interested to read about
the new "tough drinking rules" being
considered for the Stanford University
campus. Excessive alcohol consumption
is a problem and does need to be con
trolled, and I do not mean to make
light of the situation with my com
ments.
However, I was amused by the pro
posal "prohibiting student fees collected
by the University from going toward

the purchase of alcohol". I have to
believe that this will be a very selec
tively enforced prohibition. Dean Lyon's
comment that a group can still pass
the hat and fund alcoholic purchases
presents some very humorous pos
siblities.
I imagine, for instance, that at least
a portion-pf the student fees go into
the vast University treasury, where
they are commingled with other
sources of revenue. Further I suspect
that these commingled funds will go
toward paying the salaries and operat
ing expense accounts for the various
departments at the University. There
fore, I would expect that the proposal
restricting the purchase of alcohol
would be extended to the various offi
cers and departments of the university.
I am sure we all can appreciate the
humor of University President Donald
Kennedy approaching George Shultz at
a cocktail reception on campus, saying
"Gee, George, we need a couple bucks
to pay for the booze. By our count you
had two beers, and Mrs. Shultz had
two glasses of wine, therefore we esti
mate that you should kick in about
$4.50." Or how about Andy Geiger

telling some rrnyor contributor, "We
appreciate the $10,000 check, but your
tab for the bar was $7.50."
Unfortunately, there will be major
avenues for skirting the proposal avail
able to the "big-wigs," and I suspect
that the entire enforcement of this
proposal will be aimed at the student
population. Is this really fair?
