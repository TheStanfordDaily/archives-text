## Snowflakes stay, campus covered 
### The Daily Palo Alto January 23, 1912 
Responding to three years of
student pressure, the Stanford
Board of Trustees passed a
plan to construct three "eating
clubs" just east of Encina Hall.
The plan called for $10,000 to
construct a building to house
the clubs, slated for completion
by the start of the following
academic year.

Thus the Eating Clubs,
widely thought to be the best
dining option available on
campus, were born. Nobody is
quite sure when Stern dining
hall was conceived, although it
has been rumored that the
building was contructed as part
of a top-secret plan to dispose
of toxic wastes created by hy
drogen bomb production in the
1950'5. This is probably just a
rumor, but then again, the
sweet and sour pork sauce does
glow in the dark.

The first snowfall in 30 years
covered the Spanish tile roofs

and palm trees of the Farm
with over an inch of the cold,
white stuff. Students skipped
classes to throw snowballs at
pedestrians from convertibles
and pickup trucks, and snow
men appeared all over campus.
Snow had not appeared on
campus since 1932, when a
Christmas sprinkle left a thin
coating that only lasted until
mid-morning. Service stations
in the area were reported sold
out of antifreeze, and UPI re
ported three Northern Califor
nia traffic deaths due to the
snow.
Maybe the University should
install a lift on the small hill
between Sweet Hall and Meyer
Library in case it snows again.
If that seems excessive, I could
settle for a T-bar.

After the first quarter of its
implementation, Stanford's
new pass-fail policy was termed
a "roaring success." More than
900 students elected to take
courses on 4 ,he pass-fail basis,
mostly to explore courses out
side of their which they
would otherwise not have
taken.
In the early years of Stan
ford, all courses were graded
on a pass-fail basis, with ad
ditional marks including (and
I swear I'm not making this
up), "unprepared," "indif
ferent" or "lazy." I think I'd
rather have a B- than a "lazy"
from my professors.
