BL was here, July 19, 1970.
Throughout history, the bath
room wall has served as a medium
of expression, varying its message
from proclamations of love to
graphics of not-so-budding artists.
One might expect the range of
subjects within stall literature to
be rather random. However, a
cross-section of the women's
restrooms on campus shows that
much of this graffiti represents
concerns of Stanford women.
Graffiti typically covers a
spread of topics, from the political
to the obscene. However, the graf
fiti in University women's
bathrooms can be divided into
three categories: polls, advice and
"other."
Polls have been popular in the
last few years. The infamous "this
year's best-looking guys" chart in
the Meyer Library third-floor
bathroom continues to be updated
in its third year of existence. This
tally spotlights the most-desired
elite of each class.
A more recent development is
the "men to avoid" chart in the
adjoining stall, where women can
warn their fellow sisters of men
in the dangerous/undesirable cat
egory.
Next to some of the names on
this chart are words of wisdom
from unfortunate women who
"know." This type of writing bor
ders on the second category, ad
vice. Advice comes in two forms
— "sought for" and "unsought."
"Sought for" advice usually
begins with a question and beck
ons responses from other patrons
of the stall.
A fourth floor stall in Meyer
reads: "A guy I really want to go
out with finally wants to go out
with me . . then queries readers
for good restaurants in Palo Alto.
Other questions go deeper into
social issues. One woman asked,
"How do white women feel about
black women dating white men?"
One progressive optimist
advised her to "date whomever
you want — eventually the world
will get used to it if barriers are

Perhaps it is the
anonymity of the
bathroom stall that
appeals to women
to express their
concerns and
deepest feelings.

broken now."
Another woman dismissed her
by penciling "bullshit" under
neath, while others offered longer
treatises on interracial dating.
Advice of the "unsought" cate
gory includes various types of
sexual advice once offered in the
first floor bathroom of Meyer,
which has recently been elimi
nated courtesy of Acme Janitorial.
Janitorial workers report graf
fiti, which is removed regardless
of content, according to Acme su
pervisor Anna Maria.
Maria does not feel writing on
bathroom walls is an appropriate
mode of expression. "I don't un
derstand it — why they have to
deface property," she said.
The above types of graffiti prob
ably don't differ much from graf
fiti elsewhere. However, the
"other" category at Stanford is
exclusive to women's bathrooms,
and represents a voice which can't
seem to find an audience in the
outside world.
In the bathroom of the Tres
sider lounge, one woman perma
nently carved "anarcho =
feminism," boldly on the inside
of the stall door, for all to read.
Underneath, a sister in her move
ment carved "I love you."
A few inches below, a pro-choice
rally sticker has both sides of the
abortion issue scribbled all over
it. "Our bodies — Our right to
decide" begins the debate, with
"Yes, your choice to murder," rep
resenting the other side.
Another pro-choicer points out
that "Sometimes we don't get

pregnant by choice," while a
stronger viewpoint asks "Do all
anti-choice women have 'oppress
me* embroidered on your under
wear?"
Senior Teri Hopper, coordinator
of the Women's Center, said al
though graffiti damages property,
the all-female interchange can be
beneficial. "I think that anytime
you get a dialogue going in a
'women-only' space, it can
produce a lot of interesting ideas."
One example of ongoing
dialogue is the discussion in the
middle stall of Meyer's outside
bathroom. One woman comments,
"You know, every time I come
into this bathroom at night, I
wonder if it is going to be safe."
She asked "Do all women live in
fear?
A graduate student affirms her
anxiety, and claims that "the
hardest thing about getting my
Ph.D. (was) getting around safely
at night." Another student sug
gests that women take SWOPSI
174 A, Issues in Self-defense for
Women.
Along the sides of that stall,
women have shared experiences

of sexual coercion and injustices
to female students at Stanford.
The responding comments dis
plays the hurt and anger of other
women. "I want to let every com
placent person know of my rage,"
writes one woman. "My sisters
are victims because they (men)
think they have the right ... it
ain't cool. . . they have no excuse,
THEY HAVE NO RIGHT!"
According to junior John Aber
nethy, men's bathroom walls don't
express similar concerns. "Most
of the graffiti in men's rooms isn't
worth reading," he said.
Perhaps it is the anonymity of
the bathroom stall that appeals
to women to express their con
cerns and deepest feelings. In one
Meyer stall, a woman asked for
advice on her boyfriend's sexual
performance.
Perhaps it is the bond women
feel toward each other. One author
of the second floor bathroom of
Meyer calls for wnpci] tfl,
in loyalty to all other wpen —
this will improve our relationships
with men also."
Or perhaps the bathroom wall
is the only one that listens.

fiti elsewhere. However, the
"other" category at Stanford is
exclusive to women's bathrooms,
and represents a voice which can't
seem to find an audience in the
outside world.
In the bathroom of the Tres
sider lounge, one woman perma
nently carved "anarcho =
feminism," boldly on the inside
of the stall door, for all to read.
Underneath, a sister in her move
ment carved "I love you."
A few inches below, a pro-choice
rally sticker has both sides of the
abortion issue scribbled all over
it. "Our bodies — Our right to
decide" begins the debate, with
"Yes, your choice to murder," rep
resenting the other side.
Another pro-choicer points out
that "Sometimes we don't get

pregnant by choice," while a
stronger viewpoint asks "Do all
anti-choice women have 'oppress
me* embroidered on your under
wear?"
Senior Teri Hopper, coordinator
of the Women's Center, said al
though graffiti damages property,
the all-female interchange can be
beneficial. "I think that anytime
you get a dialogue going in a
'women-only' space, it can
produce a lot of interesting ideas."
One example of ongoing
dialogue is the discussion in the
middle stall of Meyer's outside
bathroom. One woman comments,
"You know, every time I come
into this bathroom at night, I
wonder if it is going to be safe."
She asked "Do all women live in
fear?
A graduate student affirms her
anxiety, and claims that "the
hardest thing about getting my
Ph.D. (was) getting around safely
at night." Another student sug
gests that women take SWOPSI

Women.
Along the sides of that stall,
women have shared experiences

of sexual coercion and injustices
to female students at Stanford.
The responding comments dis
plays the hurt and anger of other
women. "I want to let every com
placent person know of my rage,"
writes one woman. "My sisters
are victims because they (men)
think they have the right ... it
ain't cool. . . they have no excuse,
THEY HAVE NO RIGHT!"
According to junior John Aber
nethy, men's bathroom walls don't
express similar concerns. "Most
of the graffiti in men's rooms isn't
worth reading," he said.
Perhaps it is the anonymity of
the bathroom stall that appeals
to women to express their con
cerns and deepest feelings. In one
Meyer stall, a woman asked for
advice on her boyfriend's sexual
performance.
Perhaps it is the bond women
feel toward each other. One author
of the second floor bathroom of
Meyer calls for wnpci] tfl,
in loyalty to all other wpen —
this will improve our relationships
with men also."
Or perhaps the bathroom wall
is the only one that listens.

BL was here, July 19, 1970.
Throughout history, the bath
room wall has served as a medium
of expression, varying its message
from proclamations of love to
graphics of not-so-budding artists.
One might expect the range of
subjects within stall literature to
be rather random. However, a
cross-section of the women's
restrooms on campus shows that
much of this graffiti represents
concerns of Stanford women.
Graffiti typically covers a
spread of topics, from the political
to the obscene. However, the graf
fiti in University women's
bathrooms can be divided into
three categories: polls, advice and
"other."
Polls have been popular in the
last few years. The infamous "this
year's best-looking guys" chart in
the Meyer Library third-floor
bathroom continues to be updated
in its third year of existence. This
tally spotlights the most-desired
elite of each class.
A more recent development is
the "men to avoid" chart in the
adjoining stall, where women can
warn their fellow sisters of men
in the dangerous/undesirable cat
egory.
Next to some of the names on
this chart are words of wisdom
from unfortunate women who
"know." This type of writing bor
ders on the second category, ad
vice. Advice comes in two forms
— "sought for" and "unsought."
"Sought for" advice usually
begins with a question and beck
ons responses from other patrons
of the stall.
A fourth floor stall in Meyer
reads: "A guy I really want to go
out with finally wants to go out
with me . . then queries readers
for good restaurants in Palo Alto.
Other questions go deeper into
social issues. One woman asked,
"How do white women feel about
black women dating white men?"
One progressive optimist
advised her to "date whomever
you want — eventually the world
will get used to it if barriers are

Perhaps it is the
anonymity of the
bathroom stall that

to express their
concerns and
deepest feelings.

broken now."
Another woman dismissed her
by penciling "bullshit" under
neath, while others offered longer
treatises on interracial dating.
Advice of the "unsought" cate
gory includes various types of
sexual advice once offered in the
first floor bathroom of Meyer,
which has recently been elimi
nated courtesy of Acme Janitorial.
Janitorial workers report graf
fiti, which is removed regardless
of content, according to Acme su
pervisor Anna Maria.
Maria does not feel writing on
bathroom walls is an appropriate
mode of expression. "I don't un
derstand it — why they have to
deface property," she said.
