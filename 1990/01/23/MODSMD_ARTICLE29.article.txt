# Jasper Ridge preserves natural habitat for all of University
## 
### Siddhartha Mukherjee Staff writer 
On the western edge of campus,
the landscape gradually trans
forms from the familiar, busily
intersecting streets into open,
rugged hills. The buildings
sprouting thickly along the west
residences give way to sprawling
wooded areas. It is here that Stan
ford has its two largest and most
unique laboratories.
One of them is the familiar
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. The other, comparively
unknown to the rest of the
campus, is a 1,200 acre preserve
that functions as a vast open-air
laboratory for biologists,
geologists and anthropologists —
the Jasper Rige Biological
Reserve.
Monika Bjorkman, who con
ducts the docent program for the
Ridge, calls it "1,200 acres of the
most precious land in Stanford."
From the very first quarter that
Stanford opened its doors to stu
dents, naturalists and members of
the faculty drew on the vast re
sources available to them through
the Ridge. Former University
President David Starr Jordan col
lected fish from the San
Francisquito creek, some of which
are still housed in Stanford's ic
thyological collection. The diverse
assemblage of flora and fauna that
constitutes the Ridge has inspired
more than 100 masters theses and
doctoral dissertations since the
very inception of Stanford.

A tour of the Ridge is enough
to reveal its immense value.
Driving past the gates, one ap
proaches Searsville lake, with
wisps of mist steaming gently
from its surface. The fog unlocks
the Ridge slowly, quietly — and
at last, the blurred images solidify.
Ring-necked ducks flock densely
by the edges, interspersed with a
few Gadwalls. A lone egret roosts
by itself. In a flash of gray-blue,
a heron flies in.
As we walk along the trail by
the lake, a family of black-tailed
deer eyes us nervously and moves
into the bushes. Open grasslands
sprawl outwards on both sides of
the trail, with sporadic buck-eyes
and blue-oaks scattered across the
fields. The vegetation becomes
denser as the trail leads into a
forested patch. A ring of immense
Coast redwoods towers over us
while aspiring saplings crowd
thickly around our feet.
Bjorkman talks about the vari
ety and range of research at the
Ridge as we walk. The various
studies that used the Ridge as a
resource or study area include
Prof. Paul Ehrlich's work on the
checkerspot butterfly. Ehrlich and
his students from the Department
of Biological Sciences have studied
the ecology and genetics of three
generations of checkerspot but
terflies isolated in the Jasper
Ridge grassland since 1960.
Eighteen Stanford undergradu
ate courses also make some use
of the Ridge. Advanced under

graduates can do individual field
work. A recent grant from the Da
vid and Lucille Packard Founda
tion allowed Jasper Ridge to begin
a library of undergraduate field
equipment, a diverse collection of
specialised articles for field use
that can be checked out by un
dergraduates.
But Jasper Ridge almost never
made it. Before it was designated
as a preserve, the Ridge faced
several threats from development.
A crucial point in Ridge history
was a proposal by the Corps of
Engineers to build the Ladera
Dam, intended to hold back a " 100
year flood" on the San Fran
cisquito Creek as well as provide
water for skiing and swimming.
This would have permanently in
undated the redwood population
on the preserve. University offi
cials, local citizens and groups or
ganized to fight the dam, and in
1967, the project was finally killed
in Congress.
It was this proposal that drew
the academic community together
on the issue of maintaining Jasper
Ridge. In 1968, Donald Kennedy,
then chairman of the department
of Biological Sciences, led a suc
cessful effort to gain direct aca
demic control over the Ridge as
well as Searsville Lake. "To lose
Jasper Ridge would be like losing
an irreplacable library", Kennedy
said, beginning a process that was
to culminate in the founding of
a Trustee formalization of Jasper
Ridge's status in 1973.

What started out as an informal
open air research area for
naturalists was finally fenced
from public access in 1976.
According to Bjorkman, van
dalism had become a serious prob
lem on the Ridge before it was
fenced off. The delicacy of the so
phisticated scientific equipment
required to conduct studies on
this sensitive environment
prompted the conversion of the
Ridge into an exclusive research
area.
However, the Biology Depart
ment encourages people to tour
the Ridge and learn about it. "We
try and make the Ridge accessable
through the variety of programs
that focus on it", said Bjorkman.
"It was a big step step for Stan
ford to consider converting it into
the huge laboratory, and we want
everyone to appreciate the value
of such a resource."
Jasper Ridge is definitely one
of Stanford's most spectacular re
sources. Though it is exclusively
designed as a field area for
studies, it caters to the education
of a large group of people: Stan
ford students, faculty, local resi
dents and schoolchildren.
Tours are conducted around the
area by trained docents on Satur
day mornings. The tours are free
of charge for Stanford students.
Group tours are also encouraged
and may be arranged by contact
ing the co-ordinators of the Ridge
program in the Biology Depart
ment.
