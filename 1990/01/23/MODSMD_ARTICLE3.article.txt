# Unhealthy choices mean unhealthy diets for Stanford students
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Nearly 70 percent of University Food
Service's entrees contain more than 35
percent fat — a level nutritionists say is
unhealthy.
Yet Food Service says the high-fat
dishes are what students like best.
The fat question was brought into the
spotlight last year, when Food Service
initiated a policy of labeling each entree
with its fat and caloric content.
! Many students expressed concern over
the high fat content in most entrees, and
criticized Food Service for preparing un
healthy meals. According to recent

reports from the Surgeon General and
the Food and Nutrition Board of the
National Research Council, fats should
not make up more than 30 percent of an
individual's daily caloric intake.
About 80 percent of the hot dinner
entrees prepared by Food Service contain
more than 30 percent fat, according to a
nutritional analysis prepared by Ana Koz
lowski, a nutrition specialist with the
Co well Health Promotion Program.
Although a healthful diet can incor
porate entrees with more than 30 percent
fat, according to Laura Brainin-
Rodriguez, a Cowell nutritionist, no
entree should exceed 35 percent fat.

Unhealthy preferences
Asked if Food Service has made any
efforts to reduce the fat content in stu
dents' meals, Lois Olmes, a University
Food Service nutritionist, expressed con
cern about the issue but stressed the
need to address it from a "practical stand
point."
According to Olmes, there is a basic
conflict between what students "say they
want, and what they actually choose to
eat."
Students may say they want entrees
lower in fat, but when such entrees are
provided, very few students choose them,
according to Joline McQuillan, the Food

Service manager at Florence Moore Hall.
As an example, McQuillan explained
that when three entrees are prepared at
a meal for 450 people, the number of
people selecting the low-fat dish is often
as low as 10.
Whether the dissatisfaction lies with
low-fat entrees in general or the selections
prepared by Food Service is unclear.
According to a survey taken last year
in Florence Moore Hall, the foods re
quested by most students did not corre
spond to a low-fat diet. For example,
according to McQuillan, the overwhelm
ing request of vegetarian students was
for more egg and cheese entrees, both of
which are very high in fat.

About 65 percent of Food Service's veg
etarian entrees contain more than 35 per
cent fat.
According to Gail Butterfield, a
nutritionist who teaches the Stanford
course "Human Nutrition," there is a
consensus within the medical community
that most Americans need to reduce their
fat intake.
Reduction of fat consumption is not
exclusively an issue of weight control; it
is a pivotal aspect of general health main
tenance and disease prevention. The dan
gers of a high-fat diet, according to
Butterfield, are well-do umenicu.
The National Cancer Institute
has positively correlated a high
fat diet with greatly increased
chances of developing cardiovas
cular disease, breast cancer and
several other forms of cancer.
"To eat a diet containing more
than 30 percent fat would be like
courting death," said Butterfield.
An unbalanced program?
Last year, under Food Service's
"You Choose" program, a con
certed effort was made to offer at
least one low-fat — less than 35
percent fat — entree at each meal.
The distribution of educational
flyers and the institution of a
food- labeling policy were also
components of the "You Choose"
program. This policy required
each entree to be identified on the
serving line with its fat and caloric
content per serving.
This program, however, is now
being reviewed, and although a
low-fat entree is still offered at
nearly every dinner, the nutri
tional information is no longer
provided.
According to Olmes, the food
labeling policy is no longer in ef
fect because "it was not a balanced
program."
"Fat is an important issue, but
it is not the only issue," said

Olmes. A nutritional program
needs to "address the total diet,
not just fat consumption."
This view is shared by McQuil
lan, who feels that many students
"miss the big picture" by only
attending to the amount of fat
and calories in an entree and ig
noring the other aspects of a
healthy diet, such as monitoring
cholesterol and sugar intake and
obtaining enough calcium, iron
and other essential nutrients.
Part of the problem with this
program, according to Brainin-
Rodriguez, was students' failure
to understand some of the basic
concepts behind healthful eating.
For instance, the program was
found to be detrimental for many
weight-conscious individuals, par
ticularly those with eating disor
ders, who have unreasonable ideas
about the amount of calories one
should consume in a day.
"Many students think that it's
appropriate to eat 1,200 to 1,500
calories a day, but those are
starvation diets," said Brainin-
Rodriguez.
Computerized nutrition?
Food Service has been taking
action behind the scenes to pro
mote student health through its
food preparation methods, accord
ing to Olmes. For instance, all
food is now prepared with canola
oil, a mono-unsaturated fat cur
rently regarded as the healthiest

dietary oil available, according to
"Environmental Nutrition, a
professional newsletter on dietary
health.
Food Service is now considering
options for different educational
programs, particularly during the
month of March, which is national
nutrition month, but also to im
plement next fall. According to
Olmes, Food Service is open to
suggestions from campus groups
for the development of such pro
grams.
The Health Promotion Pro
gram is also considering several
new campaigns to institute on
campus. One of these is a com
puterized nutrition analysis which
could be accessed through Uni
versity computer clusters.
The database for this program
would include the nutritional in
formation on all Food Service
entrees, allowing students to in
corporate the food available to
them into a healthy, well-balanced
diet.
According to McQuillan, a
similar system has been imple
mented at UC-Berkeley, with the
computer located in the cafeteria
for convenient access. The
Berkeley program has been very
successful, said McQuillan, and if
funding were provided, Food Serv
ice would be friendly to the idea
of implementing such a system at
Stanford.
