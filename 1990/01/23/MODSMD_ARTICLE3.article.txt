# Unhealthy choices mean unhealthy diets for Stanford students
## 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
Nearly 70 percent of University Food
Service's entrees contain more than 35
percent fat â€” a level nutritionists say is
unhealthy.
Yet Food Service says the high-fat
dishes are what students like best.
The fat question was brought into the
spotlight last year, when Food Service
initiated a policy of labeling each entree
with its fat and caloric content.
! Many students expressed concern over
the high fat content in most entrees, and
criticized Food Service for preparing un
healthy meals. According to recent

reports from the Surgeon General and
the Food and Nutrition Board of the
National Research Council, fats should
not make up more than 30 percent of an
individual's daily caloric intake.
About 80 percent of the hot dinner
entrees prepared by Food Service contain
more than 30 percent fat, according to a
nutritional analysis prepared by Ana Koz
lowski, a nutrition specialist with the
Co well Health Promotion Program.
Although a healthful diet can incor
porate entrees with more than 30 percent
fat, according to Laura Brainin-
Rodriguez, a Cowell nutritionist, no
entree should exceed 35 percent fat.

Unhealthy preferences
Asked if Food Service has made any
efforts to reduce the fat content in stu
dents' meals, Lois Olmes, a University
Food Service nutritionist, expressed con
cern about the issue but stressed the
need to address it from a "practical stand
point."
According to Olmes, there is a basic
conflict between what students "say they
want, and what they actually choose to
eat."
Students may say they want entrees
lower in fat, but when such entrees are
provided, very few students choose them,
according to Joline McQuillan, the Food

Service manager at Florence Moore Hall.
As an example, McQuillan explained
that when three entrees are prepared at
a meal for 450 people, the number of
people selecting the low-fat dish is often
as low as 10.
Whether the dissatisfaction lies with
low-fat entrees in general or the selections
prepared by Food Service is unclear.
According to a survey taken last year
in Florence Moore Hall, the foods re
quested by most students did not corre
spond to a low-fat diet. For example,
according to McQuillan, the overwhelm
ing request of vegetarian students was
for more egg and cheese entrees, both of
which are very high in fat.

About 65 percent of Food Service's veg
etarian entrees contain more than 35 per
cent fat.
According to Gail Butterfield, a
nutritionist who teaches the Stanford
course "Human Nutrition," there is a
consensus within the medical community
that most Americans need to reduce their
fat intake.
Reduction of fat consumption is not
exclusively an issue of weight control; it
is a pivotal aspect of general health main
tenance and disease prevention. The dan
gers of a high-fat diet, according to
Butterfield, are well-do umenicu.
