## We wanna be on TV... Cardinal, 49ers will slug it out tonight on ESPN 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Tonight at 9 o'clock, millions
of people across the country will
have the chance to watch the
Stanford women's basketball team
in action.
That opportunity comes cour
tesy of the sports television
mavericks at ESPN. While few
people will tune in, under one
hundred thousand in all
likelihood, the fact the game is
being broadcast at all is a strong
indicator of the growth of the
sport.
Women's sports weren't even
under the banner of the NCAA
until 1982 when Title IX required
schools to provide funding for
women's athletics. While one
might have predicted basketball
would be a strong beneficiary of
the new policy at that time, it's
a safe bet few would have expected
regular-season games to appear
on national television.
Beginning with last season,
though, they did. As a matter of
fact, both Long Beach State and
Stanford — the participants in
tonight's game at Maples — were
victorious in their TV appear
ances a year ago. The Cardinal
bested USC 100-85 at home, while
the 49ers knocked off Washington
97-86 in Seattle.
This year, ESPN has expanded
its coverage to include more
games. Louisiana Tech, the No. 1
team in the nation, and Atlantic
Coast Conference power North
Carolina State have already ap
peared on the cable network, for
example.
Still, the broadcasts in the
1989-9Q season are only the tip
of the iceberg. When CBS recently
purchased the rights to the NCAA
Men's Basketball Tournament for
$1 billion over seven years, a
corollary to the deal was that CBS
would provide more coverage of
so-called minor sports, including
soccer, swimming and women's
basketball.
The women's championship
game has been shown on CBS for
the past two seasons. According
to details of the new package,
which doesn't take effect until

next year, CBS will show the na
tional semifinals, i.e. the Final
Four, as well. A handful of regular
season games are also slated for
the network's schedule.
Meanwhile, ESPN subscribers
have already been able to watch
the national semifinals and quar
terfinals of the women's tourna
ment. In 1989, Stanford's loss to
Louisiana Tech was televised.
ESPN will show those games
again in 1990.
While there is no question that
the cable channel has contributed
to the explosive growth of men's
college ball, it was nonetheless
shut out of the new tournament
TV package. Instead of seeing
early-round games on cable, you
can now catch them all on broad
cast television. ESPN will likely
replace some of the lost program
ming with additional coverage of
the women's tournament.
For Stanford, the 9 p.m. tipoff
isn't ideal but is worthwhile in
the bigger picture., Coach Tara
VanDerveer called playing on TV
"a great opportunity." Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger noted "it's
(part) of a continual effort to try
to open up opportunities for ex

posure ... of women's basketball."
The game will appear as part
of a tripleheader package tonight.
The start time is dictated by the
late edition of ESPN's
Sports Center. In a typical night
of programming for the network,
two early games will be shown
followed by a highlight and wrap
up show. After that, at midnight
on the East Coast, the Stanford-
Long Beach St. game will begin.
On Saturday Feb. 3, the Car
dinal will have another televised
game — this time on the regional
Pacific Sports Network. Because
it's a West Coast station, Stanford
and California will start play at
a more traditional 7 p.m. hour.
The game, originally scheduled for
Friday night, was moved to ac
commodate PSN.
Card notes
Ail-American Jennifer Azzi has
done a 30-second drug education com
mercial for the NCAA. The spot will
appear during several men's and wom
en's games for the next two months.
If Stanford wins tonight, it will be
the 250 th career victory for VanDer
veer against 88 defeats. Her record
at Stanford is 97-87.-

That opportunity comes cour
tesy of the sports television
mavericks at ESPN. While few
people will tune in, under one
hundred thousand in all
likelihood, the fact the game is
being broadcast at all is a strong
indicator of the growth of the
sport.
Women's sports weren't even
under the banner of the NCAA
until 1982 when Title IX required
schools to provide funding for
women's athletics. While one
might have predicted basketball
would be a strong beneficiary of
the new policy at that time, it's
a safe bet few would have expected
regular-season games to appear
on national television.
Beginning with last season,
though, they did. As a matter of
fact, both Long Beach State and
Stanford — the participants in
tonight's game at Maples — were
victorious in their TV appear
ances a year ago. The Cardinal
bested USC 100-85 at home, while
the 49ers knocked off Washington
97-86 in Seattle.
This year, ESPN has expanded
its coverage to include more
games. Louisiana Tech, the No. 1
team in the nation, and Atlantic
Coast Conference power North
Carolina State have already ap
peared on the cable network, for
example.
Still, the broadcasts in the
1989-9Q season are only the tip
of the iceberg. When CBS recently
purchased the rights to the NCAA
Men's Basketball Tournament for
$1 billion over seven years, a
corollary to the deal was that CBS
would provide more coverage of
so-called minor sports, including
soccer, swimming and women's
basketball.
The women's championship
game has been shown on CBS for
the past two seasons. According
to details of the new package,
which doesn't take effect until

next year, CBS will show the na
tional semifinals, i.e. the Final
Four, as well. A handful of regular
season games are also slated for
the network's schedule.
Meanwhile, ESPN subscribers
have already been able to watch
the national semifinals and quar
terfinals of the women's tourna
ment. In 1989, Stanford's loss to
Louisiana Tech was televised.
ESPN will show those games
again in 1990.
While there is no question that
the cable channel has contributed
to the explosive growth of men's
college ball, it was nonetheless
shut out of the new tournament
TV package. Instead of seeing
early-round games on cable, you
can now catch them all on broad
cast television. ESPN will likely
replace some of the lost program
ming with additional coverage of
the women's tournament.
For Stanford, the 9 p.m. tipoff
isn't ideal but is worthwhile in
the bigger picture., Coach Tara
VanDerveer called playing on TV
"a great opportunity." Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger noted "it's
(part) of a continual effort to try
to open up opportunities for ex

posure ... of women's basketball."
The game will appear as part
of a tripleheader package tonight.
The start time is dictated by the
late edition of ESPN's
Sports Center. In a typical night
of programming for the network,
two early games will be shown
followed by a highlight and wrap
up show. After that, at midnight
on the East Coast, the Stanford-
Long Beach St. game will begin.
On Saturday Feb. 3, the Car
dinal will have another televised
game — this time on the regional
Pacific Sports Network. Because
it's a West Coast station, Stanford
and California will start play at
a more traditional 7 p.m. hour.
The game, originally scheduled for
Friday night, was moved to ac
commodate PSN.
Card notes
Ail-American Jennifer Azzi has
done a 30-second drug education com
mercial for the NCAA. The spot will
appear during several men's and wom
en's games for the next two months.
If Stanford wins tonight, it will be
the 250 th career victory for VanDer
veer against 88 defeats. Her record
at Stanford is 97-87.-
