# Women's Basketball vs. Long Beach
## 
### 
TONIGHT — Live on ESPN with a 9 p.m. tipoff in Maples Pavilion. KZSU
(90 1 FM) will also broadcast the game. To encourage a large turnout,
the Athletic Department decided to admit all students for free with a
Stanford ID — as long as they are wearing or painted red.
RECORDS — Stanford (15-0, 6-0 in Pac-10 play, ranked No. 2 nationally),
Long Beach State (11-3, 4-1 in Big West play, ranked No. 6).
SERIES — The 49ers lead the overall series 8-1, winning the last eight
meetings between the schools. Stanford has not played Long Beach
State since 1985, however, when the 49ers won 79-61. The Cardinal's
lone triumph came at Long Beach on Feb. 12, 1979 Stanford earned a
one-point win, 67-66, in the game.
49ER UPDATE — Long Beach State has been hot from the field lately In
the past three games, it has improved its season shooting percentage
from 420 to .441. The 49ers score 84 4 points per game led by 5-foot-6
guard Dana Wilkerson at 18.3 ppg. Backcourt mate Trise Jackson chips
in 13.1 ppg and 6-4 center Angelique Lee pulls down 8.9 rebounds per
contest.
CARDINAL UPDATE — With two points tonight (a pretty safe bet), All-American
Jennifer Azzl \A/ill move into sole possession of third place on the all-time
Stanford scoring list. Azzi will surpass the total of 1,414 posted by Louise
Smith between 1978 and 1982
KEYS TO VICTORY — The 49ers specialty is a trapping, pressure defense,
and VanDerveer says they are the "quickest team we've played." Long
Beach State, like Stanford, enjoys the running game. Its strength is on
the perimeter, not in the post. For Stanford to win, the team must commit
few turnovers against the press and exploit its advantage inside.
