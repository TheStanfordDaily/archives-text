# At 12-3, men's basketball seeks respect, AP ranking, NCAA berth
## 
### 
I woke up this morning and read the
sports page of the morning paper.
After skipping all the meaningless,
boring articles on the Super Bowl and
before reading about the CBA All-Star
game, 1 had an interesting thought.
The Stanford men's basketball team is
12-3.
Now you just read that and went,
"Yeah, I know they're doing all right this
year. Big deal."
Let's try this again. The Stanford men's
basketball team is 12-3.
So is UNLV. So is Syracuse. So is LSU.
So is UCLA.
The point I'm trying to make is that
12-3 isn't pretty good. It's very good. In
fact, if the pollsters ranked teams by
record, the Cardinal would come in tied
for 25th.
1 counted.
Stanford would be tied with the above
mentioned teams and ahead of Arizona,
North Carolina and North Carolina State,

among others. Not bad indeed.
The reasons for the team's 12-3 record
are many. A non-league schedule of teams
that aren't as good as they were expected
to be is the primary one cited. But despite
this, Stanford is a pretty good basketball
team.
Through hard work and good coaching,
the Cardinal players have improved im
mesurably. But questions still remain.
Before the season started, fans were
basically hoping the team would be good
enough to get Coach Mike Montgomery

his 12th winning season in his 12-year
career. Now, needing three more win 3 in
13 games, the goal appears too easy. The
talk these days is of an NCAA Tourna
ment berth, which would be the school's
third ever.
How expectations change after a few
wins.
Can Stanford do it? Well, Tom Davis
left Stanford after four years of
coaching here. He said you could
never build a winning program here with
the admissions policy, or at least he didn't
think he could.
Dr. Tom is currently at lowa, where
the admissions people are, well, willing
to recognize talent on the court as being
as important as talent in the classroom.
The Hawkeyes are 9-6 so far this year.
The Cardinal probably needs to win
about 20 games this year to make the
big show. Not counting the victory over

Division II Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo,
that leaves nine more in 12 league games
and one or more games in the Pacific 10
Conference Tournament. Assuming losses
at Arizona Thursday night, at Oregon
State in a week and a half, at UCLA and
at California, the Cardinal would have
to win one in the Pac-10 tourney, likely
against Cal.
That also means Stanford has to beat
Arizona here and win three more road
games. Of course 20 wins, including the
CPSLO game, might be enough. Who
knows?
In this rebuilding year, even an NIT
bid would be an accomplishment. For that
Stanford probably only needs 17 or 18
wins. But what would help, and isn't
happening, is for national recognition to
come the Cardinal's way.
In last week's AP poll, the Cardinal
got two votes, good for 48th place. This
week Stanford got nine, good for 34th.

Not bad, but probably not an appropriate
improvement after upending the nation's
No. 16 team by eight and beating a decent
team by 13.
This weekend is a big opportunity.
Playing against No. 19 Arizona in McKale
Center will not be easy, but if the Cardinal
plays its best and doesn't get intimidated,
the game could be close. Cal took the
Wildcats to overtime in Tucson earlier
this year and choked a couple of good
chances to win.
Stanford should beat Arizona State Sat
urday night to stay in the conference
race. Couple that with a good showing
Thursday, and the pollsters will have to
take note.

see Siena is only 8-7 and Marc Brown
seems to go 3 of 11 every game.

Conference Tournament. Assuming losses
at Arizona Thursday night, at Oregon
State in a week and a half, at UCLA and
at California, the Cardinal would have
to win one in the Pac-10 tourney, likely
against Cal.
That also means Stanford has to beat
Arizona here and win three more road
games. Of course 20 wins, including the
CPSLO game, might be enough. Who
knows?
In this rebuilding year, even an NIT
bid would be an accomplishment. For that
Stanford probably only needs 17 or 18
wins. But what would help, and isn't
happening, is for national recognition to
come the Cardinal's way.
In last week's AP poll, the Cardinal
got two votes, good for 48th place. This
week Stanford got nine, good for 34th.

Not bad, but probably not an appropriate
improvement after upending the nation's
No. 16 team by eight and beating a decent
team by 13.
This weekend is a big opportunity.
Playing against No. 19 Arizona in McKale
Center will not be easy, but if the Cardinal
plays its best and doesn't get intimidated,
the game could be close. Cal took the
Wildcats to overtime in Tucson earlier
this year and choked a couple of good
chances to win.
Stanford should beat Arizona State Sat
urday night to stay in the conference
race. Couple that with a good showing
Thursday, and the pollsters will have to
take note.

see Siena is only 8-7 and Marc Brown
seems to go 3 of 11 every game.
