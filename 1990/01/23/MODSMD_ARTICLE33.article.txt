# Slugs slime men's team, 14-13
## Women fencers remain unbeaten after four-way meet 
### Dax Kurbegov 
UC-Santa Cruz foiled the Stan
ford men's fencing team's hopes
of entering this weekend's Penn
State Invitational with an unde
feated record as the Banana Slugs
upset the Cardinal 14-13 at Roble
Gym Saturday. The women's
squad, however, continued to
dominate and remained unde
feated after last weekend's
four-way meet.
Stanford handily defeated both
San Francisco City College and
San Francisco State University,
while falling to UC-Santa Cruz in
what proved to be a controversial
epee event. Fencers compete in
one of three events: foil, saber and
epee. The weapons differ in thick
ness and in valid target areas.
Kach bout consists of five
"touches" against the opponent.
In the fifth bout of the epee
division against Santa Cruz, Stan
ford men's Coach Zoran Tulum
recognized that the wrong Santa
Cruz fencer was on the strip. He
immediately had the match
stopped and requested the bout
be given to Stanford as a victory
because 9anta Cruz was fencing
out of order.
Santa Cruz Coach Delmar Cal
vert protested, complaining that
the bout had not been properly
announced and, therefore, his
team could not be at fault. Ac

'We lost by two
touches and had a
couple of calls
against us. It could
have gone either way.'

cording to the United States Fenc
ing Association rules, the bout
may be forfeited only if the direc
tor believes beyond a doubt that
one team is clearly at fault.
The director at the time, Step
hen Schmidt, ruled in Stanford's
favor but later reversed himself
after consulting with both
coaches. The bout was nullified
and re-fenced in proper sequence.
When the meet resumed, the
Banana Slugs came out inspired
and triumphed 5-4 in both the
foil and epee categories. The Car
dinal won the the saber division,
5-4.
According to Tulum, the loss
was not indicative of his team's
abilities. "This was our first meet
against a strong team after a long
break," Tulum said. "We lost by
two touches and had a couple of
calls against us. It could have gone
either way."
In addition, the men's team was
hampered by the fact that three
key fencers were unable to attend

the meet: captain and epee fencer
Richard Reader, saber fencer
Doug Flinn and saber fencer Curt
Cetrulo. All three have decided to
limit their fencing time due to
academic concerns.
"This was the first real varsity
competition for some of our fenc
ers,'' Tulum added. "Many of our
fencers come out of our P.E.
classes here at Stanford." Ken
Johnson and John Toth both
fenced for the first time in varsity
competition Saturday.
On the women's side, Stanford
continued to assert its dominance,
destroying San Francisco State
and San Francisco City College
by margins of 13-3.
"They were really fantastic,"
Coach Sherry Posthumus said.
"Everyone pulled their own
weight."
After trailing 4-3 early in the
competition against Santa Cruz,
the Cardinal came back to win
six of the next seven bouts to
clinch the victory.
Both the Cardinal men's and
women's teams feel confident that
they can win the West Regional
Fencing Championships, which
will be nosted by Stanford in early
March. "We beat two schools and
barely lost to one with half our
team today," Tulum said. "We
have much to do before Westerns,
but we can win them."
