### Greg Gottesman Editorial staff 
For the second time this season,
forward Adam Keefe, who led the
Cardinal to two home victories
over UCLA and USC last week,
was named the Pacific 10 Confer
ence player of the week, the league
announced Monday.
In the last two games, Keefe,
a 6-9 sophomore from Irvine,
Calif., scored 38 points and
grabbed 16 rebounds.
According to Keefe, the
nationally-televised 87-79 victory
over the formerly 16th-ranked
Bruins was especially meaningful.
"The UCLA win was a big win
not just for the team, but for the

whole program," Keefe said.
Against the Bruins, Keefe re
corded 23 points on 6-for-6 shoot
ing from the field and pulled down
four rebounds. He had 15 points
and a game-high 12 rebounds in
the 71-64 win over the Trojans.
At the moment, Keefe hopes he
can continue to play well and im
prove. "I never set goals in terms
of numbers, but if I can continue
to improve, I'll be happy."
In terms of the season, Keefe
did speak of one goal — a berth
into the NCAA Tournament. "I
feel if we play well an NCAA berth
is definitely within our reach," he
said. "At the very least, we should
be able to get into the NIT."
