# Golfers falter at USC
## Remmelgas, Cevaer play catch-up at Invite 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
A journey to Southern Califor
nia has proven to be no vacation
for the men's golf team, as the
Cardinal was tied for last place
after the first day of competition
in the Southwestern Intercol
legiate in Los Angeles.
With 36 holes completed, Stan
ford holds a 596 team total and
sits 24 strokes behind leading Cal
ifornia. Host USC and Arizona
trail the Golden Bears by two
strokes.
Coach Wally Goodwin assessed
his team's performance as "ter
rible."
"We played our worst rounds
of golf this season," Goodwin said.
The Cardinal was led by junior
Johan Remmelgas, who skillfully
navigated the demanding
Northranch links for rounds of
71 and 72. He trails Cal's Ben
Furth by six strokes.

After a difficult day, Goodwin
found solace in Remmelgas.
"Johan's as solid as a rock. He
really came through for us today,"
said Goodwin.
Sophomore Christian Cevaer
has continued his consistently fine
play in the Southwestern. His two
round total of 145 placed him
eight shots out of the lead.
Senior Steve White marked his
return to hometown Los Angeles
by carding steady rounds of 74
and 78.
The Cardinal suffered primarily
from the uncharacteristically poor
showing of seniors Don Christian
sen and Marc Funseth. Their
respective totals of 156 and 162
severely hampered the squad's
drive for victory.
After concluding the autumn
season with three victories in its
final four tournaments, Goodwin
described his team's performance
in the opening winter event as
"discouraging."
