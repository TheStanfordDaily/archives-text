# Gymnasts take fourth at Husky Classic
## Pleased with consistency, team looks to increase difficulty level in routines 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics squad turned in some
good individual performances at
the Husky Classic Friday night
but only managed fourth place
overall.
Washington, the meet host,
took the team title with a score
of 184.9. Brigham Young came
in second with a 183.05, just
ahead of Boise State's 182.9.
Senior Dina Amoroso turned
in a fine performance in the all
around competition, finishing in
fourth with a 37.1, including a
particularly nice showing on
bars. She scored a 9.45 to place
sixth, leading the Cardinal in the
event.

"I was pretty happy with my
performance," Amoroso said.
"I'm glad that I 'hit* all of my
routines — that's always my
first goal — but I know that I
can add more difficulty."
Freshman Erin McCann also
had a strong showing in all
around, where she placed eighth
with a 36.2. This score includes
a 9.45 on balance beam, which
led the Cardinal squad and
earned her a share of second
place in the event.
Competing in their first meet
of the season, junior Julie Dun
hill and sophomore Nicky
Kobrine also turned in solid per
fomances.
"Nicky looked good on floor,"
Coach Breck Greenwood said.
"She didn't have any major

breaks, although she still lacks
some difficulty in her routine."
Dunhill was the team's leading
performer on vault, earning a
score of 9.15. "I don't think I
could have done any better," she

said. It was her first vault in
competition since freshman
year.
As a team, Greenwood said,
"Ironically, we're doing fine on
our weakest events — vault and
floor — but we need to do better
on beam and bars. We need to
be more consistent."
A lack of depth also is hurting
the Cardinal squad, most
noticably on bars. Stanford en
tered only five people in the
event, leaving no option to drop
the lowest score. "If Denise
(Villars) or Alyssa (Solomon) can
fill the sixth spot, we'll be much
stronger," Greenwood said.
The Cardinal tumblers will
look to improve on the weekend's
performance Friday evening
when they face UC-Davis.
