### Mark Davies Staff writer 
In a continuing effort to repeat
their national top-10 finish of
1989, the Cardinal ruggers
squashed the Banana Slugs of
UC-Santa Cruz, 19-13, to remain
undefeated thus far in the 1990
season with a record of 2-0.
In contrast to last week's excit
ing victory over Santa Clara in
the pouring rain, the ruggers did
not have to battle the elements
last weekend â€” instead they had
to battle themselves.
The Cardinal dominated play
until midway into the second half,
running the score up to 19-3 in
what looked to be an easy victory.
However, as the Cardinal in-

creased its lead, it lessened its
intensity, allowing the Slugs back
into the game with 10 unanswered
points in the latter part of the
second half.
According to Coach Franck
Boivert, "We controlled the game
early on, but our level of play
went down after establishing an
early lead. We didn't exhibit our
usual mental toughness for 80
solid minutes, which is the foun
dation of our game."
Rob Englehardt scored his first

try of the season as did Blair Jef
fris. Setting up JefFris' try was
an exciting run by Jason Bucha
in which he broke through Santa
Cruz's first line of defense and
then flipped the ball to Jeffris,
who took it in for the score.
In a game packed with thrilling
plays, Stanford's second team not
only was mentally tough for 80
minutes but also cruel as they
obliterated the Slug's second team
45-14. In perhaps the most
spirited game of the day, Stan
ford's third team rallied from a
9-0 deficit to end the game in a
9-9 tie.
According to Boivert, the level
of play shown by all three teams
has added a new dimension to the
Stanford rugby program.

'We controlled the
game early on, but
our level of play went
down after establish
ing an early lead.'

"Everyone has played with inten
sity and courage. In the process,
we have shown that we have both
the ability and the talent to score
against anyone," Boivert said. "At
the same time, our defensive
strength has been extremely ef
fective in shutting down our op
positon. This depth ensures that
we will be strong for this season
and the seasons ahead."
