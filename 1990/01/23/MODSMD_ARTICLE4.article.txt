Editor's note: This is the first
in a three-part series examining
how Stanford experts view the
ongoing changes in Eastern Eu

embrace democracy, but Stan
ford experts warned that the
road likely will not be smooth
nor its path predictable.
"I think there are real prob
lems with the shift to democratic
rule," said Political Science Prof.
David Holloway, a researcher at
Stanford's Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Con
trol.
No Stanford specialists on
Eastern Europe predicted the
magnitude of the changes that
have occurred in recent months,
nor could they predict the speed
with which the governments
toppled. Said Hoover research
fellow Arnold Beichman, "Who
the hell could predict that they
would have fallen over?"
However, Charles Hill, a
senior research fellow at Hoover,
suggested that the changes,
though far deeper than could
have ever been realistically pre
dicted, were not a total surprise.
"It was coming," he said. "It
came very fast. It came in a
flood tide."
While serving as executive as

during the last years of the
Reagan administration, Hill said
he saw Eastern Europe about to
change dramatically.

European countries no longer
