# Looking beyond the Iron Curtain
## Experts trace path of European democracy 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Editor's note: This is the first
in a three-part series examining
how Stanford experts view the
ongoing changes in Eastern Eu
rope.

In a few short months, the
Iron Curtain has come crashing
down, battered and rusted from
more than 40 years of Soviet
control.
The recent turmoil has given
much hope that Eastern Euro
pean countries may soon
embrace democracy, but Stan
ford experts warned that the
road likely will not be smooth
nor its path predictable.
"I think there are real prob
lems with the shift to democratic
rule," said Political Science Prof.
David Holloway, a researcher at
Stanford's Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Con
trol.
No Stanford specialists on
Eastern Europe predicted the
magnitude of the changes that
have occurred in recent months,
nor could they predict the speed
with which the governments
toppled. Said Hoover research
fellow Arnold Beichman, "Who
the hell could predict that they
would have fallen over?"
However, Charles Hill, a
senior research fellow at Hoover,
suggested that the changes,
though far deeper than could
have ever been realistically pre
dicted, were not a total surprise.
"It was coming," he said. "It
came very fast. It came in a
flood tide."
While serving as executive as
sistant to Secretary George
Shultz in the State Department
during the last years of the
Reagan administration, Hill said
he saw Eastern Europe about to
change dramatically.
Despite their best attempts,
the Soviet Union and Eastern
European countries no longer

could prevent criticism of their
countries from being widely cir
culated.
With Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev opening the door by
ushering in glasnost and
perestroika, the citizens of East
ern Europe demanded change and
toppled many of the hard-line
regimes.
In Poland, noted one expert, the
Communists lost a monopoly on
power in three short months. In
East Germany, Communists
ousted their hard-line leader in
just three weeks and Romania's
totalitarian government was taken
in only three bloody days.
Chaos has reigned in Eastern
Europe for the past few months,
and none interviewed by The
Daily believe order will be re
stored in the near future. Noted
William Perry, co-director of Stan
ford's arms control center, "The
Pandora's box opened by glasnost
is not readily going to be shut."
"This revolution is irrever
sible," Perry said. Others agreed
that not even a hard-line succes
sor to Gorbachev has any hope of
turning back the clock.
Stanford experts noted that the
future is impossible to predict, es
pecially in light of how much has

changed within recent months.
Despite the turmoil, there are
some hopeful signs in Eastern Eu
rope. Czechoslovakia, by many ac
counts, has the greatest chance of
transforming into a democracy
with a fully-functioning economy.
Czechoslovakia has the external
contacts and ideas "that bode well
for democratic institutions," said
Norman Naimark, director of the
Center for Russian and Eastern
European Studies. "You have a
citizenry that, in some ways, is
ready to accept democracy."
Poland, which has had a
popularly-supported Solidarity
movement for years, also has the
beginnings of a democratic sys
tem, other Stanford experts said.
Both Poland and Czechoslova
kia and, to some extent, other
East European countries have the
ability to develop into relative in
dustrial powers, Naimark said.
Naimark warned, however, that
"it would be wrong to say that
we've got industrial mights ready
to go."
Despite dramatic political
change, Eastern Europe is still
desperately in need of an eco
nomic restructuring.
None of the countries in East
ern Europe has a modern techno
logical base. And all are working
with an outdated technological in
frastructure, Naimark said.
Drastic economic and political
reform is clearly needed, but

Naimark said economic reform
might be more difficult than the
political change. "It's harder to
engage in economic reform in a
society that is already pluralized,"
he said.
With greater popular participa
tion and criticism of the Eastern
European governments, leaders
may no longer have the power to
introduce bold initiatives to
restructure the damaged
economies.
East Germany is just one East
ern European country using cur
rency that is virtually worthless
outside the country. Further, sub
sidies of domestic products are so
prevalent in East Germany, which
is heavily dependent on a socialist
economy, that farmers sometimes
feed cattle loaves of bread rather
than grain.
Both of these factors will make
the transition to a capitalist eco
nomy extremely difficult.
About 1,500 to 2,000 East Ger
mans emigrate freely to West Ger
many each day now that the
border has been opened. "This
emigration, this daily drip from
the faucet, cannot go on," said
Robert Hamrdla, a Stanford lec
turer and expert on East German
affairs.
Other Eastern European coun
tries are having similar economic
problems.
Although Stanford experts did
not necessarily agree on what the

final economic system would be,
whether capitalism or a mixture
of capitalism and socialism, all
were confident that the changes
would shift toward a market eco
nomy.
Robert Hamerton-Kelly, a
senior research associate at Stan
ford's arms control center, said he
thinks a mixed economy is un
likely, that capitalism will inevi
tably be the result of the reforms.
"The great capitalist vulgarity ap
pears to be the default position
of the human race," he said.
Many of the experts agreed that
the United States can play a
larger role in the reforms in East
ern Europe by sending money or
food vouchers.
"The administration seems to
be frozen with their jaws hanging
out, not knowing what to think
about it," Perry said.
But Hill emphasized the limited
role the United States can play
"I think the main thing the U.S.
can do is send ideas — good ideas
— and a good will," he said.
"There's no need for a Marshall
Plan."
A particularly serious situation
is found in Romania, which has
suffered many years under the
iron fist of Nicolae Ceausescu.
And the transition from totalitari
anism has done little to reverse
the Romanian problems, experts
agreed.
"I think it's poisoned by the

aftermath of all that blood
letting," Hamerton-Kelly said.
At face value, the Gorbachev
revolution has created more con
fusion than anything else in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
But few experts believe Gorba
chev has control over the revolu
tion. One incident at a White
House dinner in Reagan's last
year of office serves to illustrate
that conviction.
With Secretary Shultz, Reagan
and a number of Soviet officials
present, then-Vice President
George Bush asked Gorbachev
what he thought the Soviet Union
would be like in a year. With per
haps a touch of trepidation, Gor
bachev replied, "Even Jesus
Christ couldn't answer that."
"It seems what Gorby has done
is to exchange certainty for un
certainty," said Shultz, now a pro
fessor in the Graduate School of
Business, in a Stanford speech
last week.
Whatever may lie in the future,
Stanford experts said they believe
the current changes, no matter
how uncertain, are a dream come
true.
"It's an historical event of
centuries-long proportion," Hill
said. "It might set the stage for
an interesting century ahead."

No Stanford specialists on
Eastern Europe predicted the
magnitude of the changes that
have occurred in recent months,
nor could they predict the speed
with which the governments
toppled. Said Hoover research
fellow Arnold Beichman, "Who
the hell could predict that they
would have fallen over?"
However, Charles Hill, a
senior research fellow at Hoover,
suggested that the changes,
though far deeper than could
have ever been realistically pre
dicted, were not a total surprise.
"It was coming," he said. "It
came very fast. It came in a
flood tide."
While serving as executive as
sistant to Secretary George
Shultz in the State Department
during the last years of the
Reagan administration, Hill said
he saw Eastern Europe about to
change dramatically.

European countries no longer

could prevent criticism of their
countries from being widely cir
culated.
With Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev opening the door by
ushering in glasnost and
perestroika, the citizens of East
ern Europe demanded change and
toppled many of the hard-line
regimes.
In Poland, noted one expert, the
Communists lost a monopoly on
power in three short months. In
East Germany, Communists
ousted their hard-line leader in
just three weeks and Romania's
totalitarian government was taken
in only three bloody days.
Chaos has reigned in Eastern
Europe for the past few months,
and none interviewed by The
Daily believe order will be re
stored in the near future. Noted
William Perry, co-director of Stan
ford's arms control center, "The
Pandora's box opened by glasnost
is not readily going to be shut."
"This revolution is irrever
sible," Perry said. Others agreed
that not even a hard-line succes
sor to Gorbachev has any hope of
turning back the clock.
Stanford experts noted that the
future is impossible to predict, es
pecially in light of how much has

changed within recent months.
Despite the turmoil, there are
some hopeful signs in Eastern Eu
rope. Czechoslovakia, by many ac
counts, has the greatest chance of
transforming into a democracy
with a fully-functioning economy.
Czechoslovakia has the external
contacts and ideas "that bode well
for democratic institutions," said
Norman Naimark, director of the
Center for Russian and Eastern
European Studies. "You have a
citizenry that, in some ways, is
ready to accept democracy."
Poland, which has had a
popularly-supported Solidarity
movement for years, also has the
beginnings of a democratic sys
tem, other Stanford experts said.
Both Poland and Czechoslova
kia and, to some extent, other
East European countries have the
ability to develop into relative in
dustrial powers, Naimark said.
Naimark warned, however, that
"it would be wrong to say that
we've got industrial mights ready
to go."
Despite dramatic political
change, Eastern Europe is still
desperately in need of an eco
nomic restructuring.
None of the countries in East
ern Europe has a modern techno
logical base. And all are working
with an outdated technological in
frastructure, Naimark said.
Drastic economic and political
reform is clearly needed, but

Naimark said economic reform
might be more difficult than the
political change. "It's harder to
engage in economic reform in a
society that is already pluralized,"
he said.
With greater popular participa
tion and criticism of the Eastern
European governments, leaders
may no longer have the power to
introduce bold initiatives to
restructure the damaged
economies.
East Germany is just one East
ern European country using cur
rency that is virtually worthless
outside the country. Further, sub
sidies of domestic products are so
prevalent in East Germany, which
is heavily dependent on a socialist
economy, that farmers sometimes
feed cattle loaves of bread rather
than grain.
Both of these factors will make
the transition to a capitalist eco
nomy extremely difficult.
About 1,500 to 2,000 East Ger
mans emigrate freely to West Ger
many each day now that the
border has been opened. "This
emigration, this daily drip from
the faucet, cannot go on," said
Robert Hamrdla, a Stanford lec
turer and expert on East German
affairs.
Other Eastern European coun
tries are having similar economic
problems.
Although Stanford experts did
not necessarily agree on what the

final economic system would be,
whether capitalism or a mixture
of capitalism and socialism, all
were confident that the changes
would shift toward a market eco
nomy.
Robert Hamerton-Kelly, a
senior research associate at Stan
ford's arms control center, said he
thinks a mixed economy is un
likely, that capitalism will inevi
tably be the result of the reforms.
"The great capitalist vulgarity ap
pears to be the default position
of the human race," he said.
Many of the experts agreed that
the United States can play a
larger role in the reforms in East
ern Europe by sending money or
food vouchers.
"The administration seems to
be frozen with their jaws hanging
out, not knowing what to think
about it," Perry said.
But Hill emphasized the limited
role the United States can play
"I think the main thing the U.S.
can do is send ideas — good ideas
— and a good will," he said.
"There's no need for a Marshall
Plan."
A particularly serious situation
is found in Romania, which has
suffered many years under the
iron fist of Nicolae Ceausescu.
And the transition from totalitari
anism has done little to reverse
the Romanian problems, experts
agreed.
"I think it's poisoned by the

aftermath of all that blood
letting," Hamerton-Kelly said.
At face value, the Gorbachev
revolution has created more con
fusion than anything else in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
But few experts believe Gorba
chev has control over the revolu
tion. One incident at a White
House dinner in Reagan's last
year of office serves to illustrate
that conviction.
With Secretary Shultz, Reagan
and a number of Soviet officials
present, then-Vice President
George Bush asked Gorbachev
what he thought the Soviet Union
would be like in a year. With per
haps a touch of trepidation, Gor
bachev replied, "Even Jesus
Christ couldn't answer that."
"It seems what Gorby has done
is to exchange certainty for un
certainty," said Shultz, now a pro
fessor in the Graduate School of
Business, in a Stanford speech
last week.
Whatever may lie in the future,
Stanford experts said they believe
the current changes, no matter
how uncertain, are a dream come
true.
"It's an historical event of
centuries-long proportion," Hill
said. "It might set the stage for
an interesting century ahead."

In a few short months, the
