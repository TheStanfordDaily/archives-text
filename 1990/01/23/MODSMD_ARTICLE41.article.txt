"You can kill me, but you will
not stop my resistance to the
occupation" is the attitude of
most Palestinians in the occu
pied West Bank, according to
Khalil Barhoum, Arabic instruc
tor in the Special Languages
Program, who addressed the
Israeli occupation in an open
discussion last night.
Barhoum represented the Pal
estinian viewpoint in the discus
sion, entitled "The Intifadah and
Beyond: Palestinian and Jewish
Perspectives."
The discussion's host, History
Prof. Mark Mancall, said the
purpose of the talk was to stim
ulate the two factions "to begin
talking now . . . about how Jews
and Arabs in the world are going
to begin living together."
Having returned only 12 days
ago from the Middle East, where

he participated in a peace march
through Jerusalem, Barhoum
implored "all of us to try and
understand the anguish that
Palestinians have been feeling
for a long time."
Maintaining the peaceful tone
of the meeting, Mancall agreed
that many Israelis fail to realize
the level of organization the Pal
estinians have achieved as the
Intifadah, or holy war, develops
commissions of education,
agriculture and medicine.
Only one guest spoke heated
words as the question-and
answer period progressed,
declaring that Mancall and
Barhoum were "ignoring the
facts" by failing to address the
significant immigration of Jews
into the West Bank.
Later, a small dispute ensued
over Barhoum's use of the word
"slave" to describe the condition

of Palestinians in the occupied
territory. Quickly dissolving the
issue, Mancall declared that any
occupation mandates discom
forts, such as lack of water and
armed forces, but that those fac
tors do not indicate enslavement
of the occupied people.
American politics entered the
discussion when Mancall stated
that the media's assertion of
Washington's boredom with the
Middle East was well-founded.
He said the United States' in
creased interest in the develop
ing democracies in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union
has resulted in a decrease in aid
to Israel.
The one-and-a-half-hour dis
cussion resulted in an agree
ment between the speakers,
which was that in order for
peace to be attained, both sides
must concede to fundamental
changes in society.
