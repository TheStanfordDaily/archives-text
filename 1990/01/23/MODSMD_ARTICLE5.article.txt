# Fellow denounces, distrusts Gorbachev's changes

Much has changed in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union
over the past few years, but little
has changed in the mind of Hoo
ver research fellow Arnold Beich
man.
Holding the conservative
Washington Times in one hand
and The National Review in the
other, Beichman makes it sound
like he will be a Cold Warrior
to his grave unless the Soviet
Union renounces communism.
Some of Beichman's views make
even appointees of the Reagan
administration look like knee
jerk liberals.

Beichman is one of the few
remaining scholars distrustful of
Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev. In fact, Francisco Franco,
the fascist leader of Spain after
World War 11, compares favora

mind.
In his many years as a scholar,
Beichman has learned to dis
trust the Soviet motives. "We're
dealing with a Third World coun
try with missiles," he says.
"Can a totalitarian regime so
change itself that it no longer is
a threat to world peace?" he
asks. "The answer is no, you
can't trust them."
"If there's one thing we know
is bullshit, it's Marxism," here

marks with an I-told-you-so in
flection in his voice. "It has
proven wrong on every
issue."
Economically, communism
has been a disaster, he says.
"Nobody knows the price of any
thing in the Soviet Union."
But Beichman says he likes
the Soviet people â€” without the
Communist Party, thank you. "I
think if the Russian people were
left alone, I think we would have
a wonderful world."
The Soviet people are being
sucked dry by "the parasitic
class," the so-called nomen
klatura. The elite nomenklatura
