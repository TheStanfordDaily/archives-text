### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
Subtle similarities between a
racist academic essay arid scrawl
ing on a package of chemicals,
both discovered at the Medical
Center earlier this month, have
led some to speculate on a possible
connection.
Found last week, a five-page es
say asserting the genetic
deficiencies of minority groups
shocked students in the School of
Medicine.
The essay, written by someone
claiming to hold a doctorate in
molecular biology, refers to blacks
and Hispanics as "genetically
deprived people" who are gaining
political power through over
population.
Ten days before the essay was
found, a hand-delivered package
bearing a bizarre message

prompted researchers in the On
cology Department to call police.
The words "We live in a trailer
at the edge of town. We've got 25
rifV j jst to keep the population
do., a" were scrawled on the box,
which was addressed to a Korean
graduate student.
Police opened the Federal Ex
press package only to find a ship
ment of chemicals that was three
days late.
No official link has been estab
lished between the essay and the
package, but an administrator in
the Oncology Department, who re
quested anonymity, expressed
surprise to see the package's ref
erence to population control
echoed in the essay.
Pilar Ossorio, a graduate stu
dent in microbiology and im
munology, found essays on Jan.
16 in both the Lane Medical Li
brary and the student lounge.
