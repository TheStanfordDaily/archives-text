# Name change to assert Lathrop house identity
## 
### Michelle Campos 
Lathrop, the name of Stanford's
Native American theme house,
will soon change, reflecting a
desire of house residents and
others in the Native American
community for a name that better
represents their culture.
Now in its second year as the
official theme house, Lathrop
bears the maiden name of Jane
Stanford, co-founder of the Uni
versity. Native American students
would like a name "that will have
relevance to our culture and be
ours, not Stanford's," according
to Jim Larimore, resident fellow
at Lathrop and dean of Native
American affairs.
"This is a chance to assert a
sense of identity to the house
similar to the other theme
houses," Larimore said. "We want
to capture a sense of community
togetherness in the house A name

change is one way to symbolically
set the stage."
The name change is a special
theme project undertaken by
Lathrop resident assistant Colin
Hampson in conjunction with the
Stanford American Indian Organ
ization. Hampson hopes the name
change will be made by the end
of the quarter.
Since there are about 45 differ
ent tribes represented at Stanford,
it was decided that an appropriate
name for the house would be cho
sen in the Ohlone language, the
tribe native to the Bay Area.
Hampson is planning to arrange
a special presentation by a mem
ber of the Ohlone community and
a San Jose State University
anthropologist at which possible
names will be discussed. Hampson
and SAIO will then arrange an
official community vote to finalize
the name.
