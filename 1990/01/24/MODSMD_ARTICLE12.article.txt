# Congress returns from break

WASHINGTON (AP) — The 101st Congress con
vened its second session yesterday, facing an agenda
suddenly expanded by the emergence of democracy
in Eastern Europe and a plan to cut Social Security
taxes at home.
Lingering issues also abound, including child care,
capital-gains taxes and deficit reduction.
Not waiting for President Bush to send up his
own budget and legislative proposals, the Senate
almost immediately began debating a far-reaching
plan for cleaning up the air — a bill that is more
costly and more sweeping than the president wants.
Opposition is based more on geography and com
peting regional interests than on party lines.
The House made plans for another confrontation
today, an attempt to override Bush's veto of legis
lation aimed at preventing the deportation of Chi
nese students who have sought refuge in the United
States. The House originally passed the bill on a
403-0 vote.
"There really is no good reason to override the
president's veto unless it is just straight-out politics,"
stud Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
He said Bush has done as much for the students
through administrative actions as the bill would do.
But Republicans were generally conceding Bush
faces a one-sided defeat.
The president, traveling in the Midwest, said he
is hoping to renew a spirit of cooperation with
Congress. But he attacked as "a sheep in wolfs
clothing" an anti-crime bill sponsored by Sen. Joseph
R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
"It will be tougher on law enforcement than on
criminals," Bush said of the bill. The measure gen
erally would prohibit use of tainted evidence, bar
racially discriminatory executions and ban sale of
assault weapons.
The first day of the session was marked by friendly
reunions. Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, told colleagues
he'd nearly died of a pancreas ailment during the
long break, and he accepted hugs and applause on
the House floor.
Outside, a half-dozen House members arrived on
bicycles after a two-block trip from a congressional
office building to call attention to plans for Earth
Day in the spring.

Democrat Craig Washington was sworn in to fill
the term of the late Rep. Mickey Leland, one day
after a judge back in Texas sentenced Washington
to 30 days in jail, accusing him of leaving legal
clients "in the lurch." Hearings have been scheduled
for Washington to show cause why he should not
be sent to jail.
On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., formally introduced a
bill to reduce Social Security taxes — an idea that
had prompted a full-scale White House attack when
he proposed it last month. Moynihan says workers
are being deceived because their Social Security
taxes are being used to make the federal deficit
appear far smaller than it is.
"These are insurance contributions, they are
premiums paid," Moynihan told a news conference.
"They do not belong to the government. If we are
not going to save them we should return them."
His bill, which has drawn widespread interest but
few sponsors, would roll back the tax increase that
took effect Jan. 1 and reduce another scheduled for
next year. That would save a worker with income
over $51,300 about $600, and leave the Social Se
curity system with just enough money to pay
retirees' checks, Moynihan said.
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-
Maine, told reporters Moynihan's proposal is
"developing what I think is growing support."
But House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Il
linois said in a letter to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-111., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, that the proposed tax cut "could inspire
even more drastic threats to the system and ulti
mately bring it down."
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., a member of the
Budget Committee, did what is seldom done in
Congress these days: He introduced a bill proposing
a tax increase. He recommended a 5 percent national
sales tax that would exempt food, health care and
housing.
Hollings said that would raise enough money to
roll back Social Security taxes, cut taxes on capital
gains from stocks and bonds, expand tax-deductible
Individual Retirement Accounts and create a
revenue-sharing program for state and local educa
tion.

Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., formally introduced a
bill to reduce Social Security taxes — an idea that
had prompted a full-scale White House attack when
he proposed it last month. Moynihan says workers
are being deceived because their Social Security
taxes are being used to make the federal deficit
appear far smaller than it is.
"These are insurance contributions, they are
premiums paid," Moynihan told a news conference.
"They do not belong to the government. If we are
not going to save them we should return them."
His bill, which has drawn widespread interest but
few sponsors, would roll back the tax increase that
took effect Jan. 1 and reduce another scheduled for
next year. That would save a worker with income
over $51,300 about $600, and leave the Social Se
curity system with just enough money to pay
retirees' checks, Moynihan said.
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-
Maine, told reporters Moynihan's proposal is
"developing what I think is growing support."
But House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Il
linois said in a letter to Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-111., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, that the proposed tax cut "could inspire
even more drastic threats to the system and ulti
mately bring it down."
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., a member of the
Budget Committee, did what is seldom done in
Congress these days: He introduced a bill proposing
a tax increase. He recommended a 5 percent national
sales tax that would exempt food, health care and
housing.
Hollings said that would raise enough money to
roll back Social Security taxes, cut taxes on capital
gains from stocks and bonds, expand tax-deductible
Individual Retirement Accounts and create a
revenue-sharing program for state and local educa
tion.
