BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - The
Lebanese press went on strike yes
terday to protest restrictions im
posed a week ago by maverick
Gen. Michel Aoun on the media
in the Christian enclave.
The Press Association, which
called the one-day strike, said
newspapers will not publish to
morrow to show solidarity with
three "sister publications that
were forced shut by the de facto
forces in east Beirut."

The work stoppage did not
cover the foreign press and broad
cast media.
The association, an umbrella
group for the publishers syndicate
and the reporters' syndicate, also
called for a sit-in at its headquar
ters in Moslem west Beirut's
Raouche neighborhood tomorrow.
Some Christian radio and tele
vision stations have maintained a
newscast strike since Aoun issued
a directive last Tuesday banning

the media from referring to Elias
Hrawi as president or Salim Hoss
as prime minister, a Sunni Mos
lem.
Hrawi appointed Hoss and fired
Aoun as prime minister and army
commander.
Internationally recognized,
Hrawi was elected Nov. 24 under
an Arab League-sponsored peace
plan worked out by Lebanese leg
islators in Saudi Arabia to end 14
years of civil strife that has killed

more than 150,000 people.
An editor at the conservative
Al-Anwar daily, the only paper
publishing in the Christian
enclave, said no decision has been
made whether to abide by the
strike.
Al-Anwar has been publishing
two editions since Friday — one
for the Christian enclave that fol
lows Aoun's censorship rules and
the other for the rest of the na
tion.

Aoun has shut down Ad-Diyar
and Al-Bayrak, the enclave's two
other functioning dailies, along
with the Akhbar Al-Yom newslet
ter for a week each for defying
his censorship.
The nation's leading newspaper,
An-Nahar, resumed publication
Monday after a six-day stoppage.
The paper, which did not abide
by Aoun's restrictions, gave no
reasons for reversing its decision.
The paper was barred from the

Christian sector by the army.
The Christian radio stations —
Voice of Lebanon of the Phalange
party and Voice of Free Lebanon
of the Lebanese Forces militia,
maintained a newscast strike for
the eighth-day to protest Aoun's
measures.
The Lebanese Broadcasting
Corp., the Lebanese Forces' tele
vision station, also has refrained
from broadcasting news since
Tuesday.
