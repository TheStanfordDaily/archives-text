# East German workers protest

EAST BERLIN (AP) â€” More than 10,000
skilled workers held a rally yesterday to
denounce communism for killing East Ger
man craftsmanship and demand free
market reforms to revive it.
"We absolutely and unconditionally need
conversion to a full market economy,"
Burkhard Schmidt, spokesman for the
Craftmen's Union, told The Associated
Press before the rally. Many of those at
tending also favored reunification with
West Germany.
"Better to close for four hours than
forever," said Lutz Scheibner, an
electronics repairman. "We need to show
the government we know what needs to
be done."
The rally was called on short notice, over
the opposition of top union leaders still
loyal to the Communist system that
rewarded them with comfortable bureau
cratic positions.
While Hans Modrow, the Communist
premier, and opposition leaders dicker over
how to share power before free elections
May 6, the general attitude toward com
promise has soured.
Pro-democracy advocates from the Social
Democratic Party and New Forum declared
yesterday they were not prepared to nego
tiate a role in the interim government and
said coalition talks have been postponed.
Opposition reluctance to prop up the gov
ernment reflects the atmosphere of uncer

tainty in East Germany, which does not
have a unifying pro-democracy figure like
Czechoslovakia's Vaclav Havel or Lech
Walesa of Poland.
Since they have no obvious alternative
to the distrusted Communists, East Ger
mans increasingly look to the West and
call for unification with prosperous West
Germany.
Up to 2,000 East Germans flee to the
West every day, bleeding the country of
skilled workers and undermining chances
for economic recovery.
Weekly rallies by hundreds of thousands
of people have moved from demanding
reform to outright rejection of the Com
munist system that has guided the nation
through its entire four decades.
ADN, the official news agency, said a
clash between "young leftists" and sup
porters of German unity was narrowly
averted at the rally of more than 100,000
people Monday in Leipzig, where zeal for
reform is strong.
About 100 youths demonstrating against
the rally's overwhelming support for uni
fication chanted slogans for continued East
German sovereignty and were chased by
irate members of the crowd.
Witnesses said only a priest's intervention
ensured "the explosive situation did not
escalate and end in violence," ADN re
ported.
