No tamales
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Pen
tagon yesterday retracted claims made
during the Panama invasion that U.S.
soldiers had found a large cache of
cocaine in a guest house used by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
"It was not cocaine," said Pentagon
spokesman Bob Hall.
However, Hall told reporters that
he could not identify with any cer
tainty what the substance was, saying
he'd been supplied with "less than
satisfactory" information by U.S. mil
itary officials in Panama.
One Pentagon official, who spoke
on condition he not be identified by
name, said the substance had been
found wrapped in banana peels and
"has something to do with voodoo."
Hall said U.S. officials were seeking
further clarification on the matter.
The Washington Post reported yester
day that the find amounted to tamales
used in voodoo ceremonies.
Soviet unrest continues
MOSCOW (AP) — Extremists am
bushed a military convoy in Azer

baijan, killing two reserve soldiers and
a woman bystander, Soviet media said
yesterday. The KGB said the republic
was on the brink of anarchy, and local
politicians pushed for secession.
Radio Moscow said the situation in
the Soviet Caucasus, where Ar
menians and Azerbaijanis have been
battling for 11 days, remained "very,
very tense" yesterday.
It said leaders of Soviet Azerbaijan
and Armenia continued negotiations
to end the ethnic violence, but little
progress was reported.
In Washington, the Bush adminis
tration voiced support yesterday for
the territorial integrity of the Soviet
Union, but it called for dialogue be
tween Moscow and Azerbaijan, saying
peaceful changes "are a matter for
the parties affected to resolve."
Accused Nazi extradited
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Bruno Karl
Blach, a retired grocery clerk charged
with Nazi war crimes, yesterday
waived his right to an extradition
hearing and agreed to return to West
Germany for trial.

Blach, 70, who has been imprisoned
since October, made a brief appear
ance before U.S. Magistrate Ralph
Geffen.
Geffen ordered the prisoner to be
exchanged directly with West German
law enforcement authorities.
Snoopy turns 40
PARIS (AP) — The French cele
brated Snoopy yesterday, saying that
happiness is a warm puppy — even
one that's 40 years old.
The beguiling beagle who appears
in Charles Schulz's comic strip
"Peanuts" was honored with a block
buster retrospective worthy of the
World War I flying ace, bird-lover and
faithful friend to that round-headed
kid.
Schulz, by the way, also was
honored. He was named Commander
of Arts and Letters, one of France's
highest awards for excellence in the
arts.
"Thank you for being the creator
of Snoopy, full of humor and with a
zest for life," Culture Minister Jack
Lang told Schulz.
