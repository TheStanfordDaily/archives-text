Freshman enthusiasm
for advising is lost
on apathetic faculty

HERE'S SOME GOOD ad
vice: the Stanford advising
program needs to get on
track.
Over the years, students have
complained continuously about the
advising program. When freshmen
first arrive at Stanford, they look
forward to meeting their new ad
viser. By the end of their years
here, they are trading horror
stories about adviser ineptitude.
The adviser that freshmen meet
is often not a faculty member. He
or she may be a graduate student
or an administrator — someone
who is connected to Stanford, but
not in the way that the freshman
expects.
The freshmen want, expect and
deserve more. They want a faculty
member to get to know and un
derstand. They want to have a fac
ulty friend who does not merely
stand behind a podium and lecture
for 50 minutes.
Instead, they receive the mes
sage that faculty members do not
care enough about freshmen to
devote a few hours a month to
talking to them. That is a message
they will remember the first time
they want to approach a faculty
member about school work.
Academic advising is accom
plished in many different ways at
Stanford. For freshmen, peers and
upperclassmen do an excellent job
of suggesting classes to take,
predicting workloads, etc. In addi
tion, the staff at the Under
graduate Advising Center does an
excellent job of advising students
both on specific classes and long
term academic planning.
Incoming students, however, do

not need only an academic
resource. Advisers should have
their own role as well; specifically,
one that gives students a faculty
contact.
Getting more faculty advisers is
a complicated task. It should not
involve monetary incentives or
other enticements, for those meth
ods only obscure what the advising
program involves.
The faculty needs to be con
vinced that advising undergradu
ates is good for both the
undergraduates and themselves.
In the midst of piles of research,
pressure to publish and tenure
proceedings, it is easy for the no
tion of the University as a place
to educate young men and women
to be obscured. Advising provides
an opportunity for professors to
take part in education on an inti
mate and productive level.
Most professors do, after all,
think of themselves as educators.
This is a way to educate in a way
that textbooks cannot.
Additionally, it is a way for pro
fessors to learn. They find out
about the faces in the lecture hall,
what they may be thinking and
valuing and what they want to see
in a good professor. They have the
thrill of a social interaction that
they may not get anywhere else.
This is a best case scenario, how
ever. Some students are not excited
about the advising process and will
not respond to any adviser.
Yet even interested students are
turned off by the advising process
because of its failures. There is a
pool of energy that students have
when they first arrive that is
betrayed by the advising that they
receive.
The University needs to make
the job of undergraduate advising
one that more faculty members
will want to take, or the disrespect
for the current advising process
will continue.
