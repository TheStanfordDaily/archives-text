Students lose services when they take back funds

WITH THE WINTER quarter
fee refund process underway
and special fee groups attempt
ing to salvage their budgets, I believe
that it is necessary to clarify the
original intent and purpose of fee
refunds.
Fee refunds at Stanford came about
largely as a result of a student lawsuit
at UC-Berkeley. The student sued for
his right to take his money from those
groups to which he was "morally,
ethically or religiously opposed." After
the student won his suit, a process
with similar goals was set up here at
Stanford.
However, the present process bears
little resemblance to the one originally

estabished. The majority of students
now vie,v fee refunds as a source of
extra funds, and tend to take their
money back from nearly all of the
special fee groups indiscriminately.
These student do not seem to realize
the repercussions of their actions. The
student groups are budgeted to have
25 percent of their special fee taken
back. When, like last quarter, special
fee groups lose more than 25 percent
of their quarterly allotment, the differ
ence comes directly from their budgets.
This greatly hinders their ability to
do the service and programming which
enriches the University community.
The irony of the situation is that
many students take back their fees

The irony of the situation
is that many students take
back their fees from
groups that they directly
benefit from.

from groups that they directly benefit
from. How many ASSU-funded student
group members take their fee refunds
from the Program Board and Commu
nity Service Fund, which actually
provide their funding?
Student publication representatives

take their refunds from the Publica
tions Board.
The Black Student Union and other
students of color organizations lose
money to students who attend and
enjoy multicultural programming.
The point is that students need to
think about the original intent of fee
refunds.
As the ASSU administrative manager,
but also an individual who enjoys the
educational environment at Stanford,
I'd encourge all students to show sup
port for special fee groups by not
taking back refunds.
