# Comic strip's attack is not well-timed
## 
### 
Well, it seems Strip Search has
stepped down to a new low on this
one. Its normally (?) funny or at least
biting wit was lo3t in a holiday
doldrum. So here goes ....
The '89 IDs referred to in the Jan.
8 Strip Search were honored at the
library up to and including that day -
the day the strip said we weren't
honoring them.

We at Green Library don't think it
was particularly funny. At least an
attempt might have been made to
check the facts.
Remember a great critic once said
satire is what opens Friday and closes
the next night.
Maybe if critics came in here once in
a while they would see what sweet
people we are at the libraries.
But the soldier's uniform worn by
the checker in the strip looked real
sharp there. Now that might be an
idea worth considering.
