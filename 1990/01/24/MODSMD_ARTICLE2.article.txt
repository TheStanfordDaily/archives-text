# Raid warning unintentional
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
After a preliminary investiga
tion, the Stanford Police now at
tribute the failure of Friday's AD
House drug raid to miscom
munication with Residential Edu
cation, rather than an intentional
tipoff.
Reversing the department's ear
lier position, the police have
decided not to press any charges
for obstruction of justice.
Police discovered that advance
warning of the raid was caused
by "misinformation and poor
timing," according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"There was no overt attempt
to obstruct justice," Niemeyer
said. In their investigation, police
found no one with any criminal
intent to interfere with the raid
and inform the alleged drug
dealers, he added.
Niemeyer now believes that the
someone in the Residential Edu
cation Office called the AD House
resident assistants after he or she
learned of the raid, trying to de
termine what was happening at
the house. Apparently, the person
believed that the raid had already
occurred or was taking place at
that time.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Diana Conklin said yesterday that
she was not at Stanford on Friday
and only heard about the raid
secondhand. Res Ed Director Alice

Supton said Monday that she had
no information about the raid.
Once the resident assistants in
the house had been called, the
warning of the impending raid
"spread like wildfire," Niemeyer
said.
Res Ed first learned of the raid
when police officers obtained a
key to the AD House.

The police investigation of the
tipoff was assisted by several stu
dents living in the AD House, who
called the police on their own and
told them how news of the raid
had spread throughout the house.
Niemeyer called the fact that
students were interested and con
cerned enough about drugs to call
the police on their own initiative
"encouraging."
Niemeyer said that although
police are aware that drug dealing
is taking place in the AD House
and have identified three people
who are involved, they will not
proceed with their investigation
because they have no further
evidence at this time.
The police have no plans for
any kind of surveillance or further
inquiry into drug use at the AD
House, Niemeyer said. However,
he noted that police will investi
gate any tips they receive.
Niemeyer said the police have
learned a valuable lesson about
planning this type of drug raid
from their experience with the AD
House raid.
Niemeyer also said he hoped
people within the house would
take this action as a warning.
People should realize that if you
engage in this kind of activity,
"you can get caught," he said.
