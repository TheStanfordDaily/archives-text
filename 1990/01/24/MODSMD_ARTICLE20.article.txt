# University should completely divest
## 
### 
I recently attended a staff meeting
that included a member of Stanford's
Procurement Department. He was ex
plaining Stanford's finances to those
present and the different areas from
which Stanford receives its money.
He told us that part of Stanford's
financial portfolio is investments, in
cluding some with companies conduct
ing business in South Africa.
He went on to say that although
there was a big "to do" about Stanford
divesting from South Africa a few
years ago, the University would lose
about $15 million by doing so and
thus decided against divestment.
The next day I received a letter
signed by University President Donald
Kennedy, Affirmative Action Officer
Cecilia Burciaga and Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences Ewart Thomas re
questing donations for the Martin Lu

ther King Jr. Memorial Fund.
King is quoted in the letter as fol
lows: "An individual has not started
living until he can rise above the nar
row confines of his individualistic con
cerns to the broader concerns of all
humanity."
I find it infuriating to receive a mes
sage like this when the University has
yet to address broader concerns. I chal
lenge everyone concerned with divest
ment to read Mark Mathabane's book
"Kaffir Boy" and then try, without
shame, to maintain that Stanford
should not divest. I urge everyone to
renew efforts to pressure Stanford into
divesting from South Africa.
