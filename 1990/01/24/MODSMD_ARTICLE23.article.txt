## Fee refunds buy lots of pizza 
### 
HAVE YOU EVER thought that you
were completely losing your
mind?
I thought I was this Monday when I
picked up my Daily and learned of the
following baffling events:
Huge numbers of students claimed
their ASSU refunds last quarter.
Police raided AD House because they
suspected that drugs or other illegal ac
tivities would be found there.
My mind was boggled. Hordes of stu
dents demanding refunds? Drugs in the
AD House? What was this crazy world
coming to?
I think many of the people involved in
these situations are missing obvious and
essential facts which would make their
operations a lot more successful. For in
stance, maybe Friday was a few days off
on the best time to find illegal activity
at AD House. yllki
Then there's the ASSU refund dilem
ma. Some ASSU officials seem to think
the masses of students getting refunds
are doing so because they misunderstand
certain groups' objectives or because they
don't realize they are depriving the
groups of a significant portion of their
budgets.
Proposals to change the situation in
clude passing out information sheets de
scribing the purpose of different
organizations or making students write
out the names of the organizations they
want to steal money from instead of al
lowing them to just check off a box.
But these measures would have a min
imal effect on decreasing the amount of
money returned because they ignore the

real reason students get refunds — be
cause the refunds are there.
Most students don't take back their
money because they can't morally justify
spending 50 cents to support Club Sports
or because they are unsure about the
purpose of the Stanford Band.
Most students take back their money
because they are desperate for cash and
an extra $20 would buy a lot of pizza.
So telling them exactly how KZSU and
X-TV are going to squander their money
won't work. The only way for the ASSU
to stop the flood of greedy students
clutching their spring voting receipts and
demanding refunds is to eliminate the
refunds altogether.
I'm sure if ASSU officials announced
a new policy of "no refunds" they would
not be met with resounding cheers. In
fact, a few students might be somewhat
peeved about the change,.
But those students would have only
their Founding Fathers to blame. These
men created the "majority rule" facet of
American government, a tenet that the
ASSU loosely emulates. Whatever or who
ever wins in an election is instituted to
the delight of some and the dismay of
others.
Personally, I would love to check off
boxes labeled "Strategic Defense Initia
tive," "tobacco subsidies" or "Marilyn
Quayle's hairdresser" to get some of my
federal income tax back, but the Amer
ican people in their infinite wisdom have
elected officials who have determined
that my money will fund such entities.
Similarly, if the majority of students
vote in the spring to give campus groups

funding, people shouldn't be allowed to
undermine that winning vote in following
quarters by personally withdrawing fi
nancial support.
If individuals can determine whether
or not they will fund a program, there
is no reason to have a campus-wide ela
tion to see which groups the majority of
students want funded.
Unfortunately, a UC-Berkeley student
sued their student government when a
refund was not given there, so the ASSU
is now legally bound to offer refunds.
But, to get around that, they could again
follow the federal government's example.
They could implement an illegal oper
ation by claiming that it is for the good
of the Stanford community and while
they're at it, maybe they could send the
ASSU senators to invade the AD House
and capture the maniacal drug-crazed
dealers the police think are living there.
