## The
						war of the words 
### 
We at The Daily recently revised
our style guide â€” our rules for
proper and consistent usage of
terms.
In considering controversial
terms, such as changing Native
American to American Indian, staff
members argued passionately for
their side in what came to be known
as "The Style Wars."
To some people, a debate over
the proper usage of terms may
seem trivial. But newspapers inform
people and help to provide them
with the vocabulary they need to
describe their ever-changing world.
Our language is dynamic and news
paper style should reflect changes.

On the other hand, it is important
for newspaper style to remain con
sistent if we are to continue to pro
vide a valuable service to our
readers. During the course of our
recent debates, style changes were
not made idly and, as the arguments
presented below show, the decision
not to change style was often as
difficult as the decision to change.
The following essays are recrea
tions of the debates freshman to
frosh, black to African-American and
rape victim to rape survivor. In each
of these cases, The Daily stuck to
the status quo because of lack of
overwhelming support for the
changes.
