HISTORY PROF. Estelle Freedman calls it
"He/Man English."
It is language that emphasizes the cultural
domination of man, the doer, over woman, the other
— terms like policeman and cameraman.
Many gender-biased terms have been replaced
with gender-neutral alternatives, and in progressive
moments, The Daily has adopted some of them. For
example, in the above cases, we now use police
officer and camera operator.
What to call first-year undergraduate students
presents a bit of a linguistic problem, however.
Referring to a person by his or her anticipated
year of graduation (Jane Jones, *92) requires too
much mental math (are sophomores or juniors '92?)
or can be wishful thinking in some students' cases.
Of course, newspapers of four-year colleges, such
as The Amherst Student, are afforded the opportu
nity to use this alternative.
First-year student is ambiguous — is he or she
an undergraduate or a graduate? However, The
Columbia Spectator chose this term.
Freshperson is a good alternative, although it is

long and hard to fit in a headline. Innovative Ac
ademic Courses innovatively uses this label for its
Freshperson-Sophomore seminars.
At The Daily, the people seeking a change more
or less reached a consensus on the term frosh, which
is both short and already part of the Stanford ver
nacular.
As proof of its utility and recognizability, it found
its way into a headline on the Jan. 16 front page
with an article "Frosh advisers offer their best."
For pressing social reasons, any gender-neutral
term would be preferable to freshman. Substituting
the well-known abbreviation Co Po for the Corner
Pocket is indeed trivial, but substituting something
for freshman represents a non-trivial, if small, strike
against gender-biased conventions.
Of course, the use of frosh in Daily news stories
may seem peculiar to our ears at first, which have
been saturated with "He/Man English" since birth.
But somewhere along the line humans got used to
you over thou and where over whither, too.
In short, culture and language are dynamic, and
The Daily should help facilitate the move to gender
equality by using frosh.
