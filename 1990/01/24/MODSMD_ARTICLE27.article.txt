WHITE PEOPLE with really good tans do
not generally say, "Say it loud. I'm black
and I'm proud!"
If they did, then correct journalistic procedure
would be to not capitalize black because the refer
ence would relate solely to the color of one's skin.
But when the descendants of Africa — whose skin
color may range from very light to coal black —
say that phrase, they are referring to much more
than the hue of their skin.
They are talking about a historically constituted
people. The pride stems not from the amount of
melanin in the skin, but from the identification
with a particular people and their heritage.
Journalists should use capitalized Black because
it, like Asian-American, Native American and Chi
cano/Latino, refers to a culturally unique group of
people who have played an important role in the
development of this country.
In order to more closely identify with the totality
of their heritage, Black people are now calling them
selves African-American. As Jesse Jackson says, "We

are not just the descendants of slaves, we are the
children of Africa who were sold into slavery and
survived anyway."
This desire to make the link with Africa has
moved the terminology in a more precise and his
torically accurate direction. Usually, the term for a
people expresses a connection with a land base and
the history of the people from that land.
The lack of a precise terminology can cause dis
respect toward the people being labeled. There is
no Negro-land where dark-skinned people built
glorious pyramids.
Such events did happen, however, in Africa. Mal
colm X (the X symbolizes the lost African name)
blazed a trail by popularizing the term Afro-
American. African-American is simply the fullest
extension of that logic.
So what is it? Black or African-American? As a
matter of policy, I feel that African-American is the
most appropriate term.
For informal usage, Black will do just fine.
"Say it loud. I'm African-American and I'm
proud" just doesn't have the same ring to it.
