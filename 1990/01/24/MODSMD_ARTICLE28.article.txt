## 
### 
SOME LANGUAGES do not even have a word
for the act of rape, because in some societies
a rape is not a crime. While this is not true
in our society, where rape has finally been recognized
as a violent crime against women, all too often rape
still goes unreported or unpunished.
Everyone agrees that someone who rapes is a
rapist, but is the woman who was raped a survivor
or a victim?
By acknowledging her as a rape survivor, society
empowers the woman and supports her. Not all
women have economic or political power in our
culture, but every woman, regardless of her place
in society, should have the power to control what
happens to her own body.
A rape is a brutal crime that attempts to rob
women of this ultimate power. The term survivor
gives back some of that power.
The word victim, on the other hand, implies help
lessness. A victim has no power to overcome what
has happened to her.

Yet, a woman who has been raped is far from
helpless or powerless. I am not denying that the
woman is the victim of violence during the crime.
In all cases of rape, a woman may not have the
physical power to overcome her attacker, but after
she has survived the attack, she has the mental
power to continue her physical and emotional
recovery.
Webster's Third New International Dictionary
defines a survivor as "one living through a time,
event or development marked by the death of
others."
In most single instances of rape, only one woman
is involved. But rape cannot be seen as a series of
single, unrelated instances. Every rape is connected.
In the context of the Webster's definition, rape
can be seen as a single "development" and the most
violent symptom of a society that still objectifies
and discriminates against women.
Sadly, some women who are raped do die. They
are the victims. Those who live, are survivors.
