THE WORD was made for man, not man for
the word.
Actually, the word was made for women,
too. And if we must state the obvious, we can make
that sentence explicitly say so by changing man to
humans.
Stylistically speaking, though, man is the better
choice; it's a one-syllable word that doesn't break
the rhythm of the phrase.
Stylistically speaking, freshman is a better word
than frosh. To be sure, freshman is gender-specific.
And we should be able to use a simple, expressive
word that conveys the concept of "first-year under
graduate student" without any erroneous, exclusive
reference to gender.
But we have a problem: no simple, expressive
alternative to freshman exists. If you think frosh
fits the bill, think again.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the
word frosh, short slang for freshman, is influenced
by the German word frosch, meaning "frog" and
referring to a grammar-school pupil.
Among the examples which the dictionary cites

to illustrate the pejorative tone of the word frosh
is the following from the American Thesaurus of
Slang, published in 1942: "Member of freshman
team, frosh, papoose, peagreener, yearling." How
inoffensive.
Clearly, the word frosh is an inappropriate term
to apply to a newcomer to Stanford, be he or she
man or woman. If not an intentional insult, it is
nevertheless demeaning in its patronizing, diminui
tive reference to an individual.
Perhaps frosh is appropriate in a light-hearted
or casual reference to the freshman class as a whole.
However, the word would be out of place — indeed,
offensive — in the headline of a story covering a
serious incident such as the death of a student.
Rather than insist on using the word frosh for
the mere fact that it is not gender-specific, egali
tarian linguists might better serve our mother
tongue (no offense intended) by finding a legitimate,
respectful alternative to freshman. Such alternatives
do not include painful permutations of spelling.
Just say no to freshmyn.
Until we come up with a better alternative, they
are freshmen and Frenchmen, not frosh and frogs.
