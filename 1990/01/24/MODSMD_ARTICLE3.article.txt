# AD House has history of drug use
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Friday'B drug raid of the Al
pha Delt House came as little
surprise to those familar with
the house's history.
Allegations of drug use and
other problems have made the
house a subject of intense scru
tiny by the University over the
years.
Until this fall, the AD House
was inhabited by the Alpha
Delta Phi fraternity. However,
last spring, the University
decided that the house would
be placed in the regular
housing draw because the fra
ternity could not fill its quota,
according to Row Director
Diana Conklin.
In addition, the house was
$22,000 in debt to the Univer

sity as of December 1988, ac
cording to a letter written by
Conklin and then-Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Joseph Pisano.
The Alpha Delts had a his
tory of problems relating to
drug use and academic
deficiency, according to Con
klin. In spite of repeated as
surances by house officers over
the years, reports of drug use
and sales persisted.
In 1986, the University
threatened the Alpha Delts
with suspension and loss of
their housing privileges be
cause of these problems. In or
der to keep their house, they
were required to agree to nine
stipulations established by the
University.
The most important stipula
tion required all Alpha Delta to
sign a written pledge that the
house would remain drug-free and
that they would abstain person
silly from using drugs and report
any infractions to the house pres
ident or resident assistant.
In the two years following the
enactment of this regulation,
reports of drug use in the house
declined significantly, Conklin
said.
While the drug problems may
have been alleviated, the AD
House now faces a new set of
problems. While it is no longer
officially a fraternity house, many
of the residents are Alpha Delts.
There have been reports of ten
sion between fraternity members
and the non-fraternity residents
in the house, Conklin said.
"The situation at the beginning
of the year was particularly bad,"
Conklin said. The fraternity mem
bers were doing things and plan
ning activities that "not everyone
else in the house wanted," she

said.
In fact, several students peti
tioned to move out of the AD
House during fall quarter. Con
klin said that among other things,
"these students were distressed by
fraternity activities that were not
being run as democratically as
they should have been."
Two students — a former res
ident and a current resident —
paint very different pictures of life
at the AD House.
The former resident, who asked
that her name be withheld, said
the drug use and tension between
fraternity and non-fraternity res
idents made it impossible for her
to live there. She asked to be reas
signed in the middle of fall quar
ter.
Drug use and dealing were
fairly widespread in the AD
House, she said. "If you're not
into the drug scene, you're an out
sider."
Her neighbors were drug
dealers who received phone calls
at all hours of the night, she said,
recalling that she walked in on
several drug deals accidentally.
She said many residents in the

house are very public about their
drug use, although she could not
be certain exactly how many of
the residents regularly use drugs.
"It feels like a lot of people do
drugs," she said, adding that ma
rijuana was the drug of choice.
Exacerbating the problem, AD
weekly bar nights regularly went
until 3 a.m., making it difficult
for those who didn't want to par
ticipate in the party scene, she
said.
The situation created "really
bad feelings" between some of the
fraternity members and other res
idents, and the RAs were stuck
in the middle of the two factions,
she said.
However, another resident gave
a very different perspective of life
in the AD House.
Alisa Mallari, a senior who
moved into the AD House this
fall, said she doesn't have any
problems with any of the frater
nity members.
She said she has never felt a
lot of hostility between the frater
nity members and other residents,
even during the period when
several students decided to leave

the house.
Mallari, who is not an Alpha
Delt but has a roommate who is,
called the overall situation within
the house "mellow."
The Alpha Delts allowed women
to join for the first time last No
vember.
Taking issue with the complaint
about the Wednesday bar nights,
Mallari daid she doesn't see any
thing that is out of control.
Although she knows about the
AD House's reputation of drug
use and dealing, she believes that
the AD House has changed since
that time, echoing Conklin's sen
timents.
She said she was surprised the
police decided to raid the Alpha
Delt House, and the two rooms
in particular.
Conklin said she has heard that
things have improved in the AD
House since the fall.
However, "the house is not out
of the woods yet," she said, adding
that she is not convinced that the
tensions have been resolved.
Conklin said she is eagerly
awaiting the results of the resi
dent evaluation surveys.

Friday'B drug raid of the Al
pha Delt House came as little
surprise to those familar with
the house's history.
Allegations of drug use and
other problems have made the
house a subject of intense scru
tiny by the University over the
years.
Until this fall, the AD House
was inhabited by the Alpha
Delta Phi fraternity. However,
last spring, the University
decided that the house would
be placed in the regular
housing draw because the fra
ternity could not fill its quota,
according to Row Director
Diana Conklin.
In addition, the house was
$22,000 in debt to the Univer

sity as of December 1988, ac
cording to a letter written by
Conklin and then-Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Joseph Pisano.
The Alpha Delts had a his
tory of problems relating to
drug use and academic
deficiency, according to Con
klin. In spite of repeated as
surances by house officers over
the years, reports of drug use
and sales persisted.
In 1986, the University
threatened the Alpha Delts
with suspension and loss of
their housing privileges be
cause of these problems. In or
der to keep their house, they
were required to agree to nine
stipulations established by the
University.
The most important stipula
tion required all Alpha Delta to
sign a written pledge that the
house would remain drug-free and
that they would abstain person
silly from using drugs and report
any infractions to the house pres
ident or resident assistant.
In the two years following the
enactment of this regulation,
reports of drug use in the house
declined significantly, Conklin
said.
While the drug problems may
have been alleviated, the AD
House now faces a new set of
problems. While it is no longer
officially a fraternity house, many
of the residents are Alpha Delts.
There have been reports of ten
sion between fraternity members
and the non-fraternity residents
in the house, Conklin said.
"The situation at the beginning
of the year was particularly bad,"
Conklin said. The fraternity mem
bers were doing things and plan
ning activities that "not everyone
else in the house wanted," she

said.
In fact, several students peti
tioned to move out of the AD
House during fall quarter. Con
klin said that among other things,
"these students were distressed by
fraternity activities that were not
being run as democratically as
they should have been."
Two students — a former res
ident and a current resident —
paint very different pictures of life
at the AD House.
The former resident, who asked
that her name be withheld, said
the drug use and tension between
fraternity and non-fraternity res
idents made it impossible for her
to live there. She asked to be reas
signed in the middle of fall quar
ter.
Drug use and dealing were
fairly widespread in the AD
House, she said. "If you're not
into the drug scene, you're an out
sider."
Her neighbors were drug
dealers who received phone calls
at all hours of the night, she said,
recalling that she walked in on
several drug deals accidentally.
She said many residents in the

house are very public about their
drug use, although she could not
be certain exactly how many of
the residents regularly use drugs.
"It feels like a lot of people do
drugs," she said, adding that ma
rijuana was the drug of choice.
Exacerbating the problem, AD
weekly bar nights regularly went
until 3 a.m., making it difficult
for those who didn't want to par
ticipate in the party scene, she
said.
The situation created "really
bad feelings" between some of the
fraternity members and other res
idents, and the RAs were stuck
in the middle of the two factions,
she said.
However, another resident gave
a very different perspective of life
in the AD House.
Alisa Mallari, a senior who
moved into the AD House this
fall, said she doesn't have any
problems with any of the frater
nity members.
She said she has never felt a
lot of hostility between the frater
nity members and other residents,
even during the period when
several students decided to leave

the house.
Mallari, who is not an Alpha
Delt but has a roommate who is,
called the overall situation within
the house "mellow."
The Alpha Delts allowed women
to join for the first time last No
vember.
Taking issue with the complaint
about the Wednesday bar nights,
Mallari daid she doesn't see any
thing that is out of control.
Although she knows about the
AD House's reputation of drug
use and dealing, she believes that
the AD House has changed since
that time, echoing Conklin's sen
timents.
She said she was surprised the
police decided to raid the Alpha
Delt House, and the two rooms
in particular.
Conklin said she has heard that
things have improved in the AD
House since the fall.
However, "the house is not out
of the woods yet," she said, adding
that she is not convinced that the
tensions have been resolved.
Conklin said she is eagerly
awaiting the results of the resi
dent evaluation surveys.
