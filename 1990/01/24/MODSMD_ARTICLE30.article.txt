"YEGRO. Colored. Afro-American. Black. The
I \l terms used to describe American blacks have
-1. 1 undergone a substantial evolution in the past
few decades.
As each term acquires a less-than-positive con
notation, a new term is coined that becomes, for
some, a source of pride in their community.
Now many leaders and members of the black
community have begun to use the term African-
American to refer to their ethnic background. The
term signifies more than just pride in blacks' African
heritage; it indicates that their culture is more than
just a skin color.
But the question of whether The Daily should
use African-American in all references to blacks
involves much more than the benefits of the term
to black pride.
As a proofreader for The Daily, I know that
stylistic conventions make a difference in terms of
a story's precision, consistency and accuracy.
In order to make such a change in Daily
style, there has to be a significant reason why the

status quo is wrong, because every change in style
sacrifices some continuity with past issues.
In other words, the burden of proof is on those
who want to make the change. In the case of African-
American, the evidence is not yet overwhelming
enough to change Daily style, as it was several years
ago when we made the change from Negro to black.
The term African-American is less precise than
black in describing the American black community.
African-American implies an inclusion of Egyptians
and South African whites, and neither group is a
part of the black community.
Some have suggested that we use the capitalized
term Black. But then, for consistency, we would
have to capitalize White, which evokes images of
"White Supremacy."
In order for The Daily to a change from black
to African-American, one of two things must happen.
Either the term black must have such a negative
connotation as to cause discomfort among a number
of our readers, or the term African-American must
become the primary term to describe blacks in
everyday speech.
Neither of these things has happened.
