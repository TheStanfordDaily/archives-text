THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE is the basis of
any newspaper's style, and it is the basis for
using victim rather than survivor in referring
to people who are sexually assaulted.
According to Webster's Third New International
Dictionary, victim is defined in the following ways
that can relate to sexual assault subjects: "someone
put to death, tortured or mulcted by another; a
person subjected to oppression, derivation or suf
fering; someone tricked, duped or subjected to
hardship; someone badly used or taken advantage
of."
Except for the portions that refer to death, the
definition fits the crime. Although some people die
because of sexual assault, or more likely because
of physical abuse that accompanies it, most victims
do not die because of the assault
Compare that to the definition of survivor, which
states as follows: "one that outlives another; one
living through a time, event or development marked
by the death of others; one continuing to exist,

function or compete after others have ceased."
The basic gist of these definitions is that a survivor
is one who lives where people normally die.
The driver of a car who lives through a fiery
head-on collision with another car could appropri
ately be termed a survivor. On average, most people
die in such crashes. However, no one would call a
person who rear-ended another car and lived a sur
vivor.
Proponents of the word survivor must also contend
with variations in the degree of sexual assaults. If
a raped person is called a survivor, is a fondling
subject also a survivor? If not, why?
Surely it would be difficult to comprehend calling
someone a fondling survivor, though the argument
for empowering the victim still holds. Very simply,
it comes down to an argument over level of severity,
which lends more credence to reserving use of the
term survivor to situations where the victim would
normally die.
The main purpose of a newspaper is to explain
the news to its readers as accurately and as clearly
as possible. The word victim does that.
