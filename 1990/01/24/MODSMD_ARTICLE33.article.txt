/"\ . / hear that viruses prey on
xV . every life form from bacteria
to numans — except yeast. Is that
true? Why is that?
A. According to Biological Sci
. ences Prof. Allan Campbell,
"There are things in yeast that
look like viruses. Some people call
them viruses. But, technically,
they're not viruses because they
don't infect cells from outside."
Viruses are tiny particles made
of RNA or DNA, the genetic ma
terial, surrounded by a thin
protein coating. They can only
reproduce inside a living cell and
are found in all kinds of creatures,
including bacteria, cauliflower,
mosquitoes and cows.
If you've read your Cowell Stu
dent Health Center information

sheet on colds, you know they
also infect people.
Real viruses spread by hooking
onto the cell membrane and in
jecting their genetic material into
the cell's center. This forces the
cell to work like an out-of-control
Xerox machine, producing hun
dreds of virus copies. Eventually
the cell explodes and the new
viruses go out to infect other cells.
But in yeast, as in all fungi,
the virus particles never go out
on their own. Although there are
whole books about organisms
called "fungal viruses," none of
them fit the formed definition be
cause they spread only when
nearby fungi cells fuse together.
Some organisms get both the
stay-at-home pseudo-viruses and
the roam-around real kind, but
as far as Campbell knows, fungi
are the only living things lacking
the real ones.
