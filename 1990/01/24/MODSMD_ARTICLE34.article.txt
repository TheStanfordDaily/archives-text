# New find cracks cratered chips

Chips, chips and more chips.
Some are good, some are bad —
and the bad ones get tossed.
In fact, integrated circuit
manufacturers end up throwing
out many of their new chips due
to serious damages. For years, sci
entists have been puzzled over
why some chips become destroyed.
But recently, Wieslaw Lukas
zek, a senior researcher at the
Department of Electrical Engi
neering, made a discovery that
may help explain why these new
chips are being damaged.
The discovery is important be
cause it may help Lukaszek and
chip manufacturers determine ex
actly which steps in the manufac
turing process are responsible for
the faulty chips. Finding the exact
problem and fixing it would not
only increase the number of good
chips coming off the production

line, but would also improve the
reliability of all chips.
Lukaszek explained that chips
are damaged during the manufac
turing process due to a lack of
understanding of the way electri
cal charges behave on chips.
He determined that during the
manufacturing of a chip, an elec
trical charge can spread over the
entire silicon wafer surface.
Previously, chip manufacturers
believed that an electric charge
directed to one part of a silicon
wafer remained there. Chips are
cut from these silicon wafers, and
serious problems can arise from
having a high electric charge in
the wrong portion of a silicon
wafer. For example, the electric
charge can build up and cause a
sudden spark.
Lukaszek reported that these
sparks can do visible damage. He
likened the damage, as viewed
through an electron microscope,

to "a crater that an artillery shell
hits." Such damage can destroy
the usefulness of the chip.
Three hundred steps are in
volved in the process that turns
a silicon wafer into a chip, and
more than 30 of them deposit an
electrical charge on the wafer.
For example, an "ion im
planter" is used to fire positively
charged particles into the silicon
wafer. This process, known as
"doping," helps to create the cir
cuitry that makes a chip work.
Because the electrical charge
spreads, the positively charged
particles released during doping
can cause serious damage.
The possibility that electrical
charge might spread has been
mentioned in previous papers. Un
fortunately, those papers
circulated among a different group
of people — the people who built
ion implanters rather than the
manufacturers who use them.
