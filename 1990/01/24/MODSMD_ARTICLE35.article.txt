If you were asked to take the
13th root of a 100-digit number,
you would probably find the task
nearly impossible. Don't feel bad.
Even a computer would have trou
ble with that task.
But what if you were required
to solve that problem in your head
— in under a minute?
That's exactly what John Over
deck, a first-year graduate student
in statistics, is able to do. At the
age of 13, while he was taking
calculus, he was looking through
the "Guinness Book of Records"
and noticed that the world's
record for extracting the 13th root
of a 100-digit number was 1 min
ute, 28.8 seconds.

Intrigued and anxious to break
the record, Overdeck decided to
determine exactly how Willem
Klein, the record holder, per
formed this incredible feat.
Overdeck noticed some interest
ing properties about 13th powers
that make it convenient to find
13th roots. For example, he
noticed that a number and its
13th power always end in the
same digit.
Over several years, Overdeck
has reduced the task of extracting
the 13th root of a 100-digit num
ber considerably. The task, as
Overdeck explains it, is actually
much simpler than it appears on
the surface.
Overdeck's algorithm involves
only nine of the 100 digits in

volved — the first six and the last
three.
He has developed a table that
allows him to approximate the
13th root from the first six digits
by pinpointing these digits be
tween two consecutive entries in
his table.
By then interpolating, or es
timating the answer from the two
known ones, he is able to limit
the 13th root to a range of a few
hundred possibilities.
In another table, Overdeck is
able to pinpoint the exact 13th
root from the final three digits.
These tables are surprisingly
simple considering that there are
almost 8 million integers that are
perfect 13th roots of 100-digit
numbers.
