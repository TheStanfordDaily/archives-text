# Imperfect programs save a jumbled disk
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
In the never-ending quest for
better, faster computers, third
party manufacturers have
brought out a number of enhance
ments to improve the Macintosh.
One of the best of these en
hancements is a program called
Disk Express made by Alsoft. Disk
Express is used to mollify the ef
fects of hard disk fragmentation.
When you first buy a hard disk
and put files on it, the files are
stored on the disk on consecutive
sectors. Hard disks are divided
into concentric circles called
tracks, which are subdivided into
sectors.
If you try to access a file and
it's stored consecutively, the file
is retrieved quickly and easily.
After time, as you delete files and
add new ones, the free space on
your disk is no longer neatly or
dered.
Instead, there may be a few
sectors free on an interior track

and a bunch few on
some exterior
tracks. When you
write files to a disk
like that, they be
come fragmented, in
other words stored
in non-consecutive
segments all over
the disk.
Now, when the
computer tries to

retrieve the file, it has to search
forward and back along the disk
to get all the parts. That slows
things down for the user.
To get things back up to speed,
Alsoft and other manufacturers
have written software that can
defragment a hard disk. What the
software does is read files into
memory, sometimes more than
one a time, erase them from the
disk to create large chunks of free
space, and rewrite the files on
consecutive sectors.
It's amazing how much the per
formance of your Macintosh can
be improved by running a defrag
mentation program. The average

user might do it all
the time if it
weren't so much of
a hassle.
In order to
defragment your
disk, you first have
to back it up. The
reason is that with
parts of files being
shifted between the
computer's memory

and the disk, it would be easy to
lose an entire hard disk if the
program crashed during depig
mentation.
Then you have to wait while
the program runs and the closer
your hard disk is to being filled
the longer it takes.
Alsofl developed a solution to
that problem â€” or so they
thought. The new version of Disk
Express claimed to eliminate frag
mentation "forever." It was de
signed to work in the background,
constantly defragmenting files so
that the disk would be optimized
forever.
The. company bought space in

all the meyor Macintosh publica
tions touting Disk Express II and
offering an upgrade. Considering
that the original Disk Express was
the most highly touted defrag
mentation software, anticipation
ran high.
Until the product was delivered.
Users quicldy discovered that it
didn't work as advertised. As a
matter of fact, it often damaged
files and sometimes crashed entire
hard disks.
Apparently, Also ft doesn't know
what to do about the problem.
I've been trying to reach them for
three weeks for a completely un
related problem with another one
of their products. Their phone has
been busy every time I've called.
It looks like this fiasco may
wind up to be the end of Alsoft.
It's really too bad, because their
products have been top notch up
to this point. Meanwhile, if you're
looking for a defragmentation pro
gram, check out the original Disk
Express, version 1.5; Symantec
Utiliti the Silverlining package
from La Cie.
