Brain wiring talk
When Dr. Carla Shatz was a
college chemistry mqjor some
20 years ago she wanted a
career that would combine her
interest in neurobiology with
her passion for correcting the
horrors of brain disease.
Shatz received her Ph.D. in
neurobiology at Harvard Uni
versity and since then has been
credited with mcyor basic work
on "how the brain gets wired
up to receive and then process
what the eyes see."
Shatz will give a public lec
ture tomorrow on her work and
motivation to become a scien
tist.

The lecture begins at 4 p.m.
in Fairchild Auditorium.
The mind's role
In a significant discovery of
the mind's role in disease, Stan
ford's Dr. David Spiegel showed
breast cancer patients ran
domly assigned to a psycho
therapy group lived longer than
women without counseling.
The discovery has prompted
heavy discussion among doc
tors and researchers about the
role of the mind in treatment.
Researchers will discuss just
that topic Friday at a sympo
sium hosted by the Medical
School.
