## Long Beach 49ers find no gold in Maples mine Azzi's sprained ankle doesn't slow Card women down 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
They come to Maples with im
pressive national rankings and
threaten to blemish the Cardinal's
perfect record. They leave like
every other opponent of the Stan
ford women's basketball team —
beaten. Badly.
While the 105-91 final score in
the Cardinal's triumph over Long
Beach State last night isn't over
whelming, it belies the fact that
once again the game was decided
by halftime. Stanford headed into
the locker room leading 56-39 and
never looked back.

In the process, the No. 2 Car
dinal moved to 16-0 on the season
despite having the services of Ail-
American Jennifer Azzi for only
16 minutes. Though Azzi's
sprained ankle kept her on the
shelf, Stanford didn't skip a beat
as center Trisha Stevens poured
in a career-high 35 points.
Despite getting 24 and 18
respectively from guards Trise
Jackson and Dana Wilkerson,
sixth-ranked Long Beach fell to
11-4.
Stevens opened the scoring by
taking a pass from Julie Zeilstra
and turning it into a layup. She
made three more field goals and
a free throw in the next three
minutes to put the Cardinal ahead
10-7. Penny Moore, who finished
with 20, knocked down two free
throws to make it 10-9, and the
49ers immediately employed their
vaunted pressure defense.
The Cardinal responded by
beating the press and getting the
ball to Katy Steding in the right
corner of the offensive end.
Steding buried a three-pointer.
Stanford would make Long Beach
pay for their gambling defense all
night.
"I thought we handled the pres
sure really well," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. It wasn't
too surprising considering the
Cardinal expected the press and

prepared accordingly.
Stanford may have been a bit
surprised, however, when the
perimeter-oriented 49ers kept
sending the ball into the low post
early on. The strategy was so ef
fective for Long Beach that when
Angelique Lee hit a 4-footer on
the baseline at the 11:53 mark,
the 49ers only trailed by one, 21-
20.
"We tried to take away their
strength as much as we could and
go to our strength," VanDerveer
noted.
Said 49ers Coach Joan Bon
vicini: "From the start, Stafford
established their post play. They
were constantly on the free-throw
line or getting an easy bucket."
Those easy buckets, mostly by
Stevens, allowed the Cardinal to
get roughly two baskets to every
one for the 49ers. When the horn
sounded, Stevens had 21 points
and Stanford was up 56-39.
"We were playing catch-up the
entire game," Bonvicini said. But
the 49ers never caught anybody.
Despite having Azzi on the bench
with the injury and Steding on
the bench with foul trouble, the
Cardinal never let the 49ers get
any closer than 13.
The reason was the play of
Stanford's bench, and it wasn't
lost on Bonvicini. "Another per
son who really killed us is Martha
Richards," Bonvicini said. Playing
her best game of the season, Ric
hards scored eight points includ-'
ing four on her patented runner
and made countless dazzling
passes, often of the no-look vari
ety.
With two minutes left in the
half, Richards wowed the crowd
of 2,418 with a baseline pass to
Zeilstra that led to an easy hoop.
But Richards was hardly the only
contributor off the bench. Sensa
tional freshman Val Whiting
scored 17 points, pulled down
seven rebounds, dished out three
assists and made two steals in
only 20 minutes.
"I don't consider her a sub,"
VanDerveer said. "[Val's] our
sixth starter."
Senior Stacy Parson also played
an excellent game, contributing
eight points and helping to run

the offense. "Stacy looked like she
had been playing 40 minutes a
game (all season)," VanDerveer
added.
Unlike Washington, who
seemed unwilling to credit the
Cardinal after getting demolished
here two weeks ago, Long Beach
had nothing but praise for Stan
ford. "They're a very fine team,"
Bonvicini said. "They make good
adjustments." She gave Stanford
credit for their handling of the
pressure and their inside scoring
when the perimeter game was left
shorthanded without Azzi and
Steding, who fouled out with 7:22
left in the game.
Even though the Cardinal ap
peared a bit flat in the second
half, the 49ers could never
manage a sustained run. They
only got their transition game
going for short spurts. Said
Wilkerson: "When they scored,
they were guarding the wings to
stop the break."
Long Beach never managed
more than five unanswerd points
in the final 20 minutes as Stan
ford once again handily defeated
a top-10 foe.
Card notes
Azzi scored only three points, end
ing her streak of games in double
figures at 29. Still, she moved into
third place on the Stanford career
scoring list at 1,416, two points ahead
of Louise Smith.
For VanDerveer, the win was the
250 th of her career. When asked to
comment, she said, "Two-fifty, what
ever. I didn't realize I was that old."
Azzi's injury may keep her out of
this weekend's games against Arizona
and Arizona State, but she said she
hopes to play in both contests.

Forward Trlsha Stevens scores off the glass last night against Long Beach State. Stevens scored a
career-high 35 points to lead the No. 2 Cardinal past the sixth-ranked 49ers.
They come to Maples with im

perfect record. They leave like
every other opponent of the Stan

beaten. Badly.

once again the game was decided
by halftime. Stanford headed into

In the process, the No. 2 Car
dinal moved to 16-0 on the season
despite having the services of Ail-
American Jennifer Azzi for only
16 minutes. Though Azzi's
sprained ankle kept her on the
shelf, Stanford didn't skip a beat
as center Trisha Stevens poured
in a career-high 35 points.
Despite getting 24 and 18
respectively from guards Trise
Jackson and Dana Wilkerson,
sixth-ranked Long Beach fell to
11-4.
Stevens opened the scoring by
taking a pass from Julie Zeilstra
and turning it into a layup. She
made three more field goals and
a free throw in the next three
minutes to put the Cardinal ahead
10-7. Penny Moore, who finished
with 20, knocked down two free
throws to make it 10-9, and the
49ers immediately employed their
vaunted pressure defense.
The Cardinal responded by
beating the press and getting the
ball to Katy Steding in the right
corner of the offensive end.
Steding buried a three-pointer.
Stanford would make Long Beach
pay for their gambling defense all
night.
"I thought we handled the pres
sure really well," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. It wasn't
too surprising considering the
Cardinal expected the press and

prepared accordingly.
Stanford may have been a bit
surprised, however, when the
perimeter-oriented 49ers kept
sending the ball into the low post
early on. The strategy was so ef
fective for Long Beach that when
Angelique Lee hit a 4-footer on
the baseline at the 11:53 mark,
the 49ers only trailed by one, 21-
20.
"We tried to take away their
strength as much as we could and
go to our strength," VanDerveer
noted.
Said 49ers Coach Joan Bon
vicini: "From the start, Stafford
established their post play. They
were constantly on the free-throw
line or getting an easy bucket."
Those easy buckets, mostly by
Stevens, allowed the Cardinal to
get roughly two baskets to every
one for the 49ers. When the horn
sounded, Stevens had 21 points
and Stanford was up 56-39.
"We were playing catch-up the
entire game," Bonvicini said. But
the 49ers never caught anybody.
Despite having Azzi on the bench
with the injury and Steding on
the bench with foul trouble, the
Cardinal never let the 49ers get
any closer than 13.
The reason was the play of
Stanford's bench, and it wasn't
lost on Bonvicini. "Another per
son who really killed us is Martha
Richards," Bonvicini said. Playing
her best game of the season, Ric
hards scored eight points includ-'
ing four on her patented runner
and made countless dazzling
passes, often of the no-look vari
ety.
With two minutes left in the
half, Richards wowed the crowd
of 2,418 with a baseline pass to
Zeilstra that led to an easy hoop.
But Richards was hardly the only
contributor off the bench. Sensa
tional freshman Val Whiting
scored 17 points, pulled down
seven rebounds, dished out three
assists and made two steals in
only 20 minutes.
"I don't consider her a sub,"
VanDerveer said. "[Val's] our
sixth starter."
Senior Stacy Parson also played
an excellent game, contributing
eight points and helping to run

the offense. "Stacy looked like she
had been playing 40 minutes a
game (all season)," VanDerveer
added.
Unlike Washington, who
seemed unwilling to credit the
Cardinal after getting demolished
here two weeks ago, Long Beach
had nothing but praise for Stan
ford. "They're a very fine team,"
Bonvicini said. "They make good
adjustments." She gave Stanford
credit for their handling of the
pressure and their inside scoring
when the perimeter game was left
shorthanded without Azzi and
Steding, who fouled out with 7:22
left in the game.
Even though the Cardinal ap
peared a bit flat in the second
half, the 49ers could never
manage a sustained run. They
only got their transition game
going for short spurts. Said
Wilkerson: "When they scored,
they were guarding the wings to
stop the break."
Long Beach never managed
more than five unanswerd points
in the final 20 minutes as Stan
ford once again handily defeated
a top-10 foe.
Card notes
Azzi scored only three points, end
ing her streak of games in double
figures at 29. Still, she moved into
third place on the Stanford career
scoring list at 1,416, two points ahead
of Louise Smith.
For VanDerveer, the win was the
250 th of her career. When asked to
comment, she said, "Two-fifty, what
ever. I didn't realize I was that old."
Azzi's injury may keep her out of
this weekend's games against Arizona
and Arizona State, but she said she
hopes to play in both contests.

Unlike Washington, who
seemed unwilling to credit the
Cardinal after getting demolished
here two weeks ago, Long Beach
had nothing but praise for Stan
ford. "They're a very fine team,"
Bonvicini said. "They make good
adjustments." She gave Stanford
credit for their handling of the
pressure and their inside scoring
when the perimeter game was left
shorthanded without Azzi and
Steding, who fouled out with 7:22
left in the game.
Even though the Cardinal ap
peared a bit flat in the second
half, the 49ers could never
manage a sustained run. They
only got their transition game
going for short spurts. Said
Wilkerson: "When they scored,
they were guarding the wings to
stop the break."
Long Beach never managed
more than five unanswerd points
in the final 20 minutes as Stan
ford once again handily defeated
a top-10 foe.
Card notes
Azzi scored only three points, end
ing her streak of games in double
figures at 29. Still, she moved into
third place on the Stanford career
scoring list at 1,416, two points ahead
of Louise Smith.
For VanDerveer, the win was the
250 th of her career. When asked to
comment, she said, "Two-fifty, what
ever. I didn't realize I was that old."
Azzi's injury may keep her out of
this weekend's games against Arizona
and Arizona State, but she said she
hopes to play in both contests.
