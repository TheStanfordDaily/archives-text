# Duke and Daily writers don't have to be Dollies
## 
### 
On Jan. 15, Duke men's basketball
Coach Mike Krzyzewski held a
meeting with the sports staff of
The Chronicle, Duke's student paper, os
tensibly for the purpose of having them
meet the players.
Instead, Coach K, as he is affectionately
known, gave the sports writers a 10-
minute lecture with more than a smat
tering of profanity. He berated them in
front of his players for coverage that
"degrades my basketball team" and
showed a lack of appreciation of the
team's success. Krzyzewski was upset
with the paper's game stories and opinion
columns.
News of the events at Duke moved on
the Associated Press wire. Reading the
accounts, I noted a striking similarity
between the way Krzyzewski views The
Chronicle and the way a number of Stan
ford coaches view The Daily

In my tenure here, a number of beat
writers have incurred the ire of coaches
whose teams they were covering. The
first was a men's soccer writer who re
ported on the team's long streak without
a goal. Next came a water polo writer
who was scheduled to cover the men's
swim team later that year.
After a weekend in which the water
polo team struggled offensively, the writer
detailed the troubles in Monday's Daily.
The story contained numerous quotes

from Coach Dante Dettamanti that sup
ported the writer's statements.
Still, deciding the story was too "nega
tive," a request came from a portion of
the team that a new writer should be
found to cover swimming. At no time did
The Daily consider the request seriously.
The writer covered the swimmers that
season despite the attempts by the coach
to make the job more difficult. He even
tried to prevent the writer from traveling
with the team to the NCAA champion
ships.
Earlier this year, a column that ap
peared in this space angered the women's
volleyball coach a great deal. Soon after,
the coach was distressed by a story writ
ten by the beat writer. The coach took
the writer aside and proceeded to chew
him out, explaining that college athletes
weren't supposed to be criticized by the
school paper.
Somehow, the coach seemed to imply

these athletes were different. In reality,
though, they aren't different. If the stu
dent government screws up, this paper
will report on it. If the football team is
bad, they'll read about it in half a dozen
other papers. They should not be
protected as students, nor should they be
coddled as athletes. Whether volleyball
or swimming or soccer is a big-time sport
isn't the issue at all.
There seems to be an underlying notion
the school newspaper should play the role
of cheerleader The notion is sadly mis
taken. Newspapers exist, and are given
freedom in this country, to say things
that might be unpopular. As students
working for The Stanford Daily we are
no different from San Franciscans work
ing for the San Francisco Examiner.
Examiner reporters don't act as press
representatives for Mayor Art Agnos or
49ers Coach George Seifert. Similarly,
Daily reporters do not serve as public

relations hacks for University President
Donald Kennedy and women's basketball
Coach Tar a VanDerveer.
When the long-time director of the Uni
versity's News Service, Bob Beyers, re
cently resigned, there was a great deal
of concern among faculty members that
somehow the journalistic integrity of the
organization would be compromised.
Beyers was admired for his candor and
his efforts to avoid sugar-coating bad
news.
It is a shame some of Stanford's coaches
don't share the feelings of the school's
faculty While I am not suggesting anyone
at The Daily is worthy of the respect
Beyers received, this paper's staff
deserves to be treated in the same man
ner as other journalists.
Krzyzewski said to The Chronicle writ
ers: "I'm not looking for puff stuff. You're
