# Duke and Daily writers don't have to be Dollies
## 
### 
On Jan. 15, Duke men's basketball
Coach Mike Krzyzewski held a
meeting with the sports staff of
The Chronicle, Duke's student paper, os
tensibly for the purpose of having them
meet the players.
Instead, Coach K, as he is affectionately
known, gave the sports writers a 10-
minute lecture with more than a smat
tering of profanity. He berated them in
front of his players for coverage that
"degrades my basketball team" and
showed a lack of appreciation of the
team's success. Krzyzewski was upset
with the paper's game stories and opinion
columns.
News of the events at Duke moved on
the Associated Press wire. Reading the
accounts, I noted a striking similarity
between the way Krzyzewski views The
Chronicle and the way a number of Stan
ford coaches view The Daily

In my tenure here, a number of beat
writers have incurred the ire of coaches
whose teams they were covering. The
first was a men's soccer writer who re
ported on the team's long streak without
a goal. Next came a water polo writer
who was scheduled to cover the men's
swim team later that year.
After a weekend in which the water
polo team struggled offensively, the writer
detailed the troubles in Monday's Daily.
The story contained numerous quotes

from Coach Dante Dettamanti that sup
ported the writer's statements.
Still, deciding the story was too "nega
tive," a request came from a portion of
the team that a new writer should be
found to cover swimming. At no time did
The Daily consider the request seriously.
The writer covered the swimmers that
season despite the attempts by the coach
to make the job more difficult. He even
tried to prevent the writer from traveling
with the team to the NCAA champion
ships.
Earlier this year, a column that ap
peared in this space angered the women's
volleyball coach a great deal. Soon after,
the coach was distressed by a story writ
ten by the beat writer. The coach took
the writer aside and proceeded to chew
him out, explaining that college athletes
weren't supposed to be criticized by the
school paper.
Somehow, the coach seemed to imply

these athletes were different. In reality,
though, they aren't different. If the stu
dent government screws up, this paper
will report on it. If the football team is
bad, they'll read about it in half a dozen
other papers. They should not be
protected as students, nor should they be
coddled as athletes. Whether volleyball
or swimming or soccer is a big-time sport
isn't the issue at all.
There seems to be an underlying notion
the school newspaper should play the role
of cheerleader The notion is sadly mis
taken. Newspapers exist, and are given
freedom in this country, to say things
that might be unpopular. As students
working for The Stanford Daily we are
no different from San Franciscans work
ing for the San Francisco Examiner.
Examiner reporters don't act as press
representatives for Mayor Art Agnos or
49ers Coach George Seifert. Similarly,
Daily reporters do not serve as public

relations hacks for University President
Donald Kennedy and women's basketball
Coach Tar a VanDerveer.
When the long-time director of the Uni
versity's News Service, Bob Beyers, re
cently resigned, there was a great deal
of concern among faculty members that
somehow the journalistic integrity of the
organization would be compromised.
Beyers was admired for his candor and
his efforts to avoid sugar-coating bad
news.
It is a shame some of Stanford's coaches
don't share the feelings of the school's
faculty While I am not suggesting anyone
at The Daily is worthy of the respect
Beyers received, this paper's staff
deserves to be treated in the same man
ner as other journalists.
Krzyzewski said to The Chronicle writ
ers: "I'm not looking for puff stuff. You're

missing something. You're missing out
on the big picture and that's all I wanted
to say."
In reality, though, it is Coach K who
is guilty of tunnel vision. When I dis
cussed what happened with Mark
McLaughlin, one of the writers for the
Duke paper, we noted the analogue be
tween college athletes hoping for a pro
fessional career and college journalists
aspiring to work full time as journalists.
No one would expect Adam Keefe to
do anything less than his best as he guns
for a career in the NBA. Along the same
lines, Daily writers hoping to make it to
Sports Illustrated someday have to work
to be the best writers they can possibly
be.

That means calling it like they see it.
It means pointing out the struggles of a
player or a team. Readers want to know
what is really going on. If things aren't
going as expected, the writer tries to find
out the why and then reports on it.
If I'm giving the impression this prob
lem is universal between Stanford
coaches and The Daily, let me take a
timeout. Oftentimes, we receive compli
ments from coaches and players even
those who we've covered in a candid or
critical manner.
Recently, I wrote a column discussing
the good and the bad with this year's
men's basketball team. Though I didn't
speak to them directly, it got back to me
that a couple of the assistants thought
my assessment was fair and largely on
the mark.
Additionally, I would like to give credit
to the Athletic Department — especially

the sports information staff. Even though
I've written a number of pieces that were
not complimentary to specific members
of Stanford's athletic community, I've
been able to maintain good relationships,
even friendships, with a number of Uni
versity officials who seem to understand
the role of the journalist — student or
otherwise.
At the same time, I'll be the first to
admit that as sports writers we should
not use our positions to carry out a per
sonal vendetta. If one of our writers
didn't like a member of the team he or
she was covering and used their position
to write a diatribe about the athlete, we
would not run the story.
We are also not here to hurt anybody
intentionally. When I learned that my
columns on the volleyball team were
having a negative affect on some players,
I wrote a letter to each of them apologiz

ing for any hurt feelings and attempting
to explain my position.
The goal of my articles was to detail
the team's troubles for our readers. The
goal of the letters was to make it clear
that as a fellow human being, I certainly
didn't want to attack anyone's self
esteem. I took the stack of letters to
volleyball practice and gave them to the
coach.
It was, I think, the fan in me that
decided to write the letters. Yes, the fan.
Anyone in the sports writing business
who doesn't enjoy watching sports should
probably find a new profession. Like
many Stanford students, Daily sports
writers love the Cardinal.
We sit around discussing whether
men's basketball will go to the tourna
ment, we eagerly await news on football
recruiting, we even follow Stanford
alumni.

Yet, when we sit down to our comput
ers to write a story about a game for
25,000 people to peruse, we have to stop
cheering. We can't open an article with,
"Gee, it's a real shame Stanford had to
lose today." Our three sports columnists,
myself included, could do that. And, if
we did it often enough, nobody would
think us credible enough to be worth
reading.
So we seek a balance of good news and
bad, of praise and criticism. Like anv
hometown paper, our is slant
a bit toward the good. Ai Stanford, wil.
so many championship-caliber teams, we
have the luxury or bringing you lots of
the positive.
When we're not asked to sweep the
negative under the rug, it makes our job
a lot easier — and a lot more fun. It
also makes for a better newspaper.
