## Asian-American prof. may be back on tenure track 
### Quan Phung Staff writer 
The tenured position in Asian-
American studies at Stanford that
Gordon Chang once sought could
finally be his.
The Asian-American studies
search committee on Monday ex
tended invitations to two finalists,
including Chang, to come to
campus for interviews and presen
tations in early February.
Chang is the former history lec
turer who taught Stanford's only
Asian-American studies class un
til last year. His departure from
Stanford provoked anger among
members of the Asian American
Students Association and other
campus minority student organi

zations.
The decision not to promote
Chang to a tenure-track position
was one of the catalysts for the
May 15 takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice. Afterward, a tenure-track
position for an Asian-American
studies professor was established
and a search committee formed.
In addition to Chang, who cur
rently has a tenure-track position
at UC-Irvine, the search commit
tee invited Victor Nee, professor
of sociology at Cornell University,
to make a presentation, according
to Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako, who is chair of the
search committee.
Two additional finalists may be
named later, Yanagisako said.

The finalists chosen displayed
"excellence in scholarship," said
Yanagisako. "They have contrib
uted to scholarship in Asian-
American studies, and there is
evidence for potential to making
a strong teaching contribution" in
that discipline, she added.
Prior to teaching his class
"Topics in Asian-American His
tory" at Stanford, Chang taught
Asian studies for 13 years at
Laney College in Oakland. He has
studied issues of national security
and U.S.-Asian relations.
Nee received his doctorate in
so- logy from Harvard Univer
sity in 1977. He has studied pat
terns of Chinese and Japanese
immigration, issues of ethnicity,
and achievements of Asian-
Americans.
In addition, he has published
"Long Time Californ," an oral his
tory of San Francisco's
Chinatown which has become a
standard text for many Asian-
American studies courses.
Rick Yuen, assistant dean of
student affairs and director of the
Asian American Activities Center,
said he was pleased with how the
search has progressed.
He said there was some concern
among the committee members
earlier because "we did not know
how many scholars in Asian-
American studies are teaching and
researching now."
The fact that the search com
mittee received approximately 47
applications "shows that Asian-

American studies is an active and
growing field," he said.
Judy Wu, AASA issues chair
and a student member of the com
mittee, said it is important to find
a professor "who will teach Asian-
American studies, be an advocate
of Asian-American studies, and
see themselves as a part of the
Asian-American community."
The finalists will have an op
portunity to speak of their vision
for Asian-American studies at
Stanford when they arrive on
campus for an informal presenta
tion at the Asian American
Activities Center.
In addition, each finalist will
give a more formal presentation
to the department they could en
ter.
Wu stressed the important role
students can play during these in
formal question-and-answer ses
sions as well as the formal lecture.
The students' demand for such a

field was the impetus for this
search, she said.
Yanagisako added that student
input will be "seriously consid
ered," but also said that the
search committee must consider
the departments' view as well as
its own views when making the
final decision.
Nee is scheduled to give his pre
sentation to the community at
noon Feb. 5 at the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center. He will pres
ent a colloquium entitled "A
Theory of Immigrant Incorpora
tion" to the Sociology Department
the following day.
Chang will address the Asian-
American community on Feb. 8
at noon at the Asian-American
Activities Center, and will give a
colloquium entitled "Relocation
Camps Again? The Chinese-
American Left and National Se
curity in the 19505" to the History
Department the following day.
