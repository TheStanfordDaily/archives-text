## Asian-American prof. may be back on tenure track

The tenured position in Asian-
American studies at Stanford that
Gordon Chang once sought could
finally be his.
The Asian-American studies
search committee on Monday ex
tended invitations to two finalists,
including Chang, to come to
campus for interviews and presen
tations in early February.
Chang is the former history lec
turer who taught Stanford's only
Asian-American studies class un
til last year. His departure from
Stanford provoked anger among
members of the Asian American
Students Association and other
campus minority student organi

zations.
The decision not to promote
Chang to a tenure-track position
was one of the catalysts for the
May 15 takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's of
fice. Afterward, a tenure-track
position for an Asian-American
studies professor was established
and a search committee formed.
In addition to Chang, who cur
rently has a tenure-track position
at UC-Irvine, the search commit
tee invited Victor Nee, professor
of sociology at Cornell University,
to make a presentation, according
to Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako, who is chair of the
search committee.
Two additional finalists may be
named later, Yanagisako said.

The finalists chosen displayed
"excellence in scholarship," said
Yanagisako. "They have contrib
uted to scholarship in Asian-
American studies, and there is
evidence for potential to making
a strong teaching contribution" in
that discipline, she added.
Prior to teaching his class
"Topics in Asian-American His
tory" at Stanford, Chang taught
Asian studies for 13 years at
Laney College in Oakland. He has
studied issues of national security
and U.S.-Asian relations.
Nee received his doctorate in
so- logy from Harvard Univer
sity in 1977. He has studied pat
terns of Chinese and Japanese
