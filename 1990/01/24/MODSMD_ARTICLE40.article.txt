# Star prep quarterback commits to Stanford
## 
### 
Tommy Knecht, rated as one of
the best high school quarterbacks
in the nation, has given a verbal
commitment to attend Stanford
next year.
Although official letters of in
tent can't be signed until Febru
ary, Knecht apparently made up
his mind this week, choosing Stan
ford over Texas A&M, Alabama
and Pacific 10 Conference rival
use.
Knecht will likely join a recruit
ing class for second-year Cardinal
football coach Denny Green that
is rumored to be in the top 10 in
the nation. Approximately seven
other blue-chip players have made
verbal commitments to come to
the Farm.
Knecht is a 6-foot-3, 195-pound
senior from Corvalis, Ore., where
he starred for Corvalis High. He
is described by scouts as a quick
footed quarterback, proficient at
rolling out of the pocket and
avoiding pressure. With his fath
er, Gary Knecht, an assistant
coach at Oregon State, he has al
ready had a lot of exposure to
college football and the Pac-10.
He is rated as one of the top
10 prep signal-callers in the na
tion by several scouting publica
tions. Allen Wallace of Super Prep
magazine in Southern California
rates him as the nation's eighth

best senior quarterback.
His senior year Knecht guided
a mediocre Corvalis High team to
a 5-4 mark, connecting on 116*
of-228 passes for 1,451 yards. He
tossed 10 touchdowns, but threw
10 interceptions.
He was just as impressive when
he held on to the ball, carrying
94 times for 303 yards and eight
touchdowns. He was the team's
second leading rusher.
Knecht will join a young Stan
ford team that matured last year
under Green and won two of its
last three games, compiling a 3-8
record on the season, 3-5 in the
Pac-10.
Knecht will join a Stanford
squad that already has three prep
"stars" in the depth charts.
Although Brian Johnson will
decline his final year of eligibility
to play baseball for the New York
Yankees, Steve Smith, Jason
Palumbis and John Lynch will all
return next fall for the Cardinal.
Smith, who guided Stanford to
a Big Game win in the 1989 finale,
will be a sophomore, as will John
Lynch, a quick quarterback who
saw mop-up action last year.
Palumbis, who rode the pine
last year after commanding the
helm during Coach Jack El way's
final season, will be a junior.
