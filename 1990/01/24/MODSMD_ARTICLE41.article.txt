# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
In the NFL, a good team combines the
run and the pass, the dive and the bomb,
to win and get to the Super Bowl.
Former Stanford star and current Denver
Broncos quarterback John Elway can throw
the long bomb to the Three Amigos, or hand
off straight ahead to Bobby Humphrey.
So, in the spirit of Super Bowl hype, the
Daily Athletes of the Week are a diver, Katie

Connors, and a three-point bomber, John
Patrick of the men's basketball team.
Connors, a senior diver from Davis, Calif.,
won three events over the weekend as the
No. 1 swimming and diving team swept past
UCLA and USC by identical 91-49 scores.
Friday at USC Connors won both the one
and three-meter events, and added a first
in the three-meter at UCLA on Saturday.
Stanford improved to 4-0 in dual meets
with the road sweep.
Connors last year became only the second
diver in collegiate history to final in all
three diving events at NCAA's, finishing
fourth in the three-meter, eighth in the
one-meter and sixth in platform.

Patrick, a 6-foot-4 junior guard from the
playgrounds of Vienna, Va., sank both UCLA
and USC with his deadly three-point shoot
ing.
Shooting only .352 from the field before
Saturday's 74-61 win over USC, Patrick pun
ished the paint-packing defenses employed
by the Trojans and Bruins.
Thursday, in Stanford's 87-79 upset of
No. 16 UCLA, Patrick tied a career high
with 18 points.
Then Saturday, with a sluggish Stanford
team trailing by two at the half, Patrick
pumped in two deep three-pointers to put
Stanford ahead, tallying 17 points for the
game, with five assists and two steals.

Patrick, who was inconsistent in a reserve
role last season, has matured as a starter,
handling the ball well and controlling the
floor against the numerous presses Stanford
has faced.
