### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
Entering yesterday's final
round mired in last place, the
men'B golf team salvaged an
eighth place finish with last day
heroics at the Southwestern In
tercollegiate in Los Angeles.
The Cardinal's dazzling third
round team total of 279 tamed
the vaunted Northranch links and
launched it past five of its district
foes.
According to Coach Wally Good
win, the final 18-hole score set a
tournament record for the lowest
single day team total in the his
tory of tha USC Invite.
Stanford completed the tourna
ment with an 875 team total, 26
shots off the pace set by victorious
California. The Golden Bears
bested host USC by a single shot.
Describing the team's play as
"absolutely remarkable," an ex
uberant Goodwin was unequivocal
in his praise for the Cardinal's
showing.
"It was the best round of golf
a team has ever shot for me," said
the veteran coach.
The squad was led by sopho
more Christian Cevaer, who
posted a brilliant final round 4-
under-par 67. His three day 212
total placed him fourth individu
ally, five shots behind Cal's Ben
Furth.

'It was the best
round of golf a
team has ever shot
for me.'

Cevaer's skillful day is all the
more impressive after a disastrous
start placed him three shots over
par after only two holes.
Cevaer maintained his com
posure and went on to post a 7-
under-par total for the final 16.
Goodwin felt the performance
serves as a testament to Cevaer's
vast talent.
"Christian has the golf ability
to win any collegiate tournament
he plays in," Goodwin said.
Junior Johan Remmelgas fired
a final day 75 to complement ex
cellent opening rounds of 71 and
72. His play in the Southwestern
marked another fine tournament
for the consistent performer.
Stsve White savored his South
ern California homecoming with
an excellent one over par 72 and
solid total of 224.
The senior's contribution to the
Cardinal's last day charge cer
tainly pleased his hometown Los
Angeles followers.

Senior Marc Funseth staged a
stirring recovery with a 2-under
69 in yesterday's play. After suf
fering an uncharacteristically
poor first day total, Funseth did
gain some redemption.
Senior Don Christiansen en
joyed a similarly strong finale,
closing with an impressive 71.
Goodwin attributed Stanford s
return to excellence to a team
meeting he called after an abys
mal opening Monday.
"I challenged them to play as
well as they're capable of. I'm
really proud that the guys came
back and got the job done, " he
said.
The USC event was especially
significant for the Cardinal be
cause the field was comprised en
tirely of the district opponents it
needs to defeat to solidify its claim
to a NCAA Regional berth.
To be selected for postseason
play, the squad must be ranked
among the top 12 teams in its
30-team district.
Entering the Southwestern
with a sixth place district ranking,
the Cardinal will wait and see if
it will be hindered by its perform
ance in Los Angeles.
Nevertheless, the squad will
surely look back to yesterday's
round as among its most notable
achievements in the 1989-90 cam
paign.
