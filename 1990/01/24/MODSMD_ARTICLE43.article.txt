# Rim-rattling IM season tips off
## 
### Rob Johnstone Staff writer 
Intramural league play began
last week in soccer and basket
ball, highlighted by Oklahoma
Sooner-style blowouts and a few
Maples Pavilion nail-biters.
In the blowout category, Todd
Giles turned in a spectacular in
dividual performance, leading
Adams to a 92-15 win over the
DKE'B in a B-league game Sun
day afternoon. Giles compiled a
triple-double, dazzling the
somewhat sold-out Maples
crowd with 24 points, 17 spec
tacular assists and 16 rebounds.
Mike Ward of Adams also put
in a fine day's work, scoring 36
points and grabbing 16
rebounds.
The game was relatively close
early on, as Adams led 11-6 five
minutes into the game. But then
Giles and Ward turned it on and
Adams went on a 20-0 run to
go up 31-6.
"The best thing about Giles'
performance was his unselfish
ness," noted referee Josh San
born. "He only shot when he
had an open layup under the
basket."
The only effects of Giles' off
season knee surgery seemed to
be his inability to dunk the ball.
Given all his other achieve
ments, this small deficiency
should probably be overlooked.
"Not bad," was all Giles could
say about his performance.
In a far better B-league game,

IM sports report

Grove needed a free throw from
Bart Hollander with three
seconds remaining to beat West
Lagunita, 33-32. The game
started out looking like a possi
ble blowout with Jeff Warfield
of West Lag scoring seven first
half points and dishing out five
assists to put West Lag firmly
in control with a 17-10 halftime
lead.
The listless Grove team came
out strong in the second half
with a pressure defense and
heightened intensity. Grove im
mediately cut the seven-point
halftime deficit to a one point
West Lag lead, 19-18.
The teams traded baskets for
the rest of the half, with Chris
Mckenna of Grove knotting the
game at 32-32 with 12 seconds
left on a driving layup. Mckenna
was fouled on the play and con
verted the free throw to appar
ently give Grove a 33-32 lead.
However, Mckenna commit
ted a lane violation, keeping the
score at 32-32 and giving West
Lag a chance to win on the last
shot.
Warfield lost the ball out of
bounds off his dribble with
seven seconds remaining, giving
the ball back to Grove. Grove
inbounded the ball, getting it to
Hollander in the key, who was
fouled with three seconds

remaining. He converted on one
of the two free throws to give
Grove the 33-32 victory.
In women's action Sunday,
Otero Rocks Again crushed Biz
1A 33-10. Otero opened up a
four-point halftime lead by run
ning off 13 straight points at
the beginning of the second half.
Gretchen Wustrack dominated
the game, scoring 23 points and
controlling both the offensive
and defensive boards.
Without Monte, Monte's
Maulers rallied around the
strong play of Aaron Stalnoher
to beat Roble 1A in a B-league
game, 41-28. Stalnoher took
over the game in the second
half, helping erase a 17-16 Roble
halftime lead. Josh Sanborn and
Steve Miranda also contributed
strongly in the second half, scor
ing several key baskets down
the stretch.
In B-league intramural soccer
action this week, Friends of Maif
edged Biz 1A 3-2. Friends of
Maif, aided by a first-half goal
from its namesake Mark "I
don't live at 553" Mayfield, took
a commanding 2-0 halftime
lead.
