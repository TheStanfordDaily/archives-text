MELBOURNE, Australia (AP)
â€” Three-time Australian cham
pion Mats Wilander ended Boris
Becker's bid for a third straight
Grand Slam title in a stunning
upset Wednesday as wild winds
played havoc and fans succumbed
to the heat.
Defending champion Ivan Lendl
and two-time former champion
Stefan Edberg also overcame the
heat, winds and eager, young op
ponents to reach the semifinals.
For the second straight day, at
least 50 fans among the crowd of
about 20,000 were treated for
heat exhaustion, but none was
seriously ill, officials said.
The temperature on the rubber
bottomed hard courts was 115
degrees, down from the 140
degrees on Tuesday, but the dry,
hot winds of up to 35 mph tossed
around baseline shots. Away from
the court, the temperature
reached 99 degrees.
Wilander, winner of the
Australian in 1983, 1984 and
1988, had been struggling the past
year and dropped to No. 15 in
the rankings, but he came back
to show his old form in beating
No. 2 Becker 6-4, 6-4, 6-2.
Edberg, the only hatless player
of the day, had to cope with even
crazier winds on court one and a
more difficult challenger in Amer
ican serve-and-volleyer David
Wheaton.
The third-seeded Edberg, who
warmed up for the match by play
ing nearly four hours in the heat
Tuesday, beat Wheaton 7-5, 7-6
(7-4), 3-6, 6-2.

Wheaton, 20, of Lake Min
netonka, Minn., stayed even with
Edberg until being broken for the
first time in the 11th game of the
first set on a backhand that
drifted long and wide in the
breeze. .
Edberg, pumping his fist after
the break in what was for him a
big demonstration of emotion,
served out the set, and raised both
arms in triumph.
"It felt good," he said. "I had
to get pumped up."
He then won the first four
games of the second set. During
the second changeover, Edberg
was nearly hit when the umbrella
topped table he was sitting under
went flying.
Wheaton recovered, attacking
the net more aggressively and
serving better, and took the next
five games. At 6-5, he had two
chances to break Edberg and take
the set after ripping a cross-court
forehand winner to make it 15-40.
But Edberg won four straight
points to hold.
Edberg won the tiebreaker by
taking four of the last five points,
and pumped his fist a couple of
more times.
Wheaton's power game carried
him through the third set but he
succumbed to the steadier play of
Edberg in the fourth as the wind
subsided a bit.
"It was like a wind tunnel the
whole match, and then all of a
sudden the wind died down and
it was only about 25 mph,"
Wheaton said.
Edberg, who said he trouble tos

sing the ball on the serve because
of the wind and lost his rhythm
in the second and third sets, was
grateful for the breezes in one
way.
"If it hadn't been for the wind,
we would have fried out there,"
he said.
Wilander whipped strapg pass
ing shots by the net-chaining Be
cker, who grew increasingly frus
trated and finally backed up to
the baseline and began playing
Wilander's style.
Like a crafty counter-puncher
taking apart a wild-swinging
fighter, Wilander, 25, calmly took
the 22-year-old Becker's measure
in a 2-hour, 15-minute clinic.
The victory over Becker, who
won his third Wimbledon title and
first U.S. Open title last year, gave
Wilander a large dose of satisfac
tion after his straight-sets trounc
ing by the West German in the
Davis Cup finals in December.
Becker had won six of their pre
vious eight matches before Wed
nesday, losing only on the clay at
the French Open.
The loss by Becker stalled his
drive to catch up to No. 1 Lendl,
and left him wondering about a
jinx in the Australian, where he
has never gone past the quarters
in five appearances.
Lendl, his legionnaire's hat flap
ping and his groundstrokes cut
ting through winds that knocked
over table umbrellas, beat Andrei
Cherkasov 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 on the
partially enclosed stadium center
court.
