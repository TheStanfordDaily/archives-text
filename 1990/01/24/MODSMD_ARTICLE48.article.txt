# For the record

### 
Stories and a Jan. 17 editorial
in The Daily inaccurately reported
that Stanford has the only sta
dium in the Pacific 10 Conference
that allows alcohol consumption.
The University of Sothern Cali
fornia's stadium also permits al
cohol use.
An incorrect definition of the
word "intifadah" was included in
a story yesterday. The word
means "uprising."
The name of the author of a
letter in yesterday's Daily was
misspelled. He is Brian Veit.
