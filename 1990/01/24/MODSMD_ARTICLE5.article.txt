# Era of military alliances over, experts say
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Editor's note: This is the second
article in a three-part series about
how Stanford experts view the on
going changes in Eastern Europe.

As Eastern European countries
redefine their roles in the world,
Stanford experts agree that the
Warsaw Pact and NATO can no
longer be viewed as competing
military alliances.
Particularly difficult to resolve
is the issue of what role the War
saw Pact will play in the security
of the Soviet Union. When Josef
Stalin extended military control
over Eastern Europe after World
War 11, he defended the move by
saying the Soviet Union needed
a buffer from Western aggression.
With the Cold War buried, So
viet policy-makers are beginning
to think the buffer is expendable,
and so is the Warsaw Pact as a
military alliance.
"They realize that we are not
a threat," said Hoover Senior Fel
low Richard Staar, President
Reagan's ambassador to the
Vienna conventional arms control
talks until 1983. "Who wants
these East European countries?
They're basket cases."
Even if the Soviets wanted to
keep Eastern Europe as a military
buffer, Gorbachev has loosened
the reins holding together the
Eastern European countries, and
the Soviet leader will find it im
possible to control those countries
again, experts agree.
"As a military alliance, it is al

ready, de facto, dead," note*
William Perry, co-director of Stan
ford's Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control.
"I think they would want to
keep the Warsaw Pact together
as a loose political alliance," said
Political Science Prof. David Hol
loway, a researcher at the arms
control center. "I think they
realize that they can't operate the
pact like they did before because
of democratic changes."

"This is a really fundamental
shift, in my mind, in Soviet mil
itary policy," said Holloway, a top
expert on the Soviet military.
The Soviet Union, experts said,
will now be resigned to the fact
that pact troops from Eastern Eu
rope cannot be relied upon in mil
itary action.
A Soviet general leading troops
into battle would not know
whether his troops will fire, es
pecially against a popular rebel

lion in the Eastern European
country. "Would that give you a
warm feeling in the pit of your
stomach?" asked Perry.
The Soviets and the other mem
bers of the pact are not the only
ones questioning their future Eu
ropean roles.
"I think there is a question for
the U.S. about what role the U.S.
wants to play in Europe," said
