# Era of military alliances over, experts say
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Editor's note: This is the second
article in a three-part series about
how Stanford experts view the on
going changes in Eastern Europe.

As Eastern European countries
redefine their roles in the world,
Stanford experts agree that the
Warsaw Pact and NATO can no
longer be viewed as competing
military alliances.
Particularly difficult to resolve
is the issue of what role the War
saw Pact will play in the security
of the Soviet Union. When Josef
Stalin extended military control
over Eastern Europe after World
War 11, he defended the move by
saying the Soviet Union needed
a buffer from Western aggression.
With the Cold War buried, So
viet policy-makers are beginning
to think the buffer is expendable,
and so is the Warsaw Pact as a
military alliance.
"They realize that we are not
a threat," said Hoover Senior Fel
low Richard Staar, President
Reagan's ambassador to the
Vienna conventional arms control
talks until 1983. "Who wants
these East European countries?
They're basket cases."
Even if the Soviets wanted to
keep Eastern Europe as a military
buffer, Gorbachev has loosened
the reins holding together the
Eastern European countries, and
the Soviet leader will find it im
possible to control those countries
again, experts agree.
"As a military alliance, it is al

ready, de facto, dead," note*
William Perry, co-director of Stan
ford's Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control.
"I think they would want to
keep the Warsaw Pact together
as a loose political alliance," said
Political Science Prof. David Hol
loway, a researcher at the arms
control center. "I think they
realize that they can't operate the
pact like they did before because
of democratic changes."

"This is a really fundamental
shift, in my mind, in Soviet mil
itary policy," said Holloway, a top
expert on the Soviet military.
The Soviet Union, experts said,
will now be resigned to the fact
that pact troops from Eastern Eu
rope cannot be relied upon in mil
itary action.
A Soviet general leading troops
into battle would not know
whether his troops will fire, es
pecially against a popular rebel

lion in the Eastern European
country. "Would that give you a
warm feeling in the pit of your
stomach?" asked Perry.
The Soviets and the other mem
bers of the pact are not the only
ones questioning their future Eu
ropean roles.
"I think there is a question for
the U.S. about what role the U.S.
wants to play in Europe," said
Holloway.
The NATO alliance of Western
powers has always assumed the
Soviet Union had a far superior
army to fight in Europe. The War
saw Pact armies outnumber
NATO forces by hundreds of thou
sands of soldiers.
To counter Soviet conventional
superiorly, NATO's main func
tion has been to deter a conven
tional attack with nuclear forces.
With the pact crumbling,
NATO's nuclear attack force in
Europe is becoming less strategi
cally important. Stanford experts
expect that like the pact, NATO
will become much more politically
oriented.
"To me, NATO is a world or
ganization with world interests,"
said Hoover Institution Senior Re
search Fellow Charles Hill, who
was a high-ranking official in
Reagan's State Department.

From the early years after
World War 11, the battleground
for the Cold War has been Eastern
Europe, caught between the forces
of the West and the East. In that
respect, several professors inter
viewed suggested Eastern Europe
should be called Central Europe
to emphasize that point.
For decades, the Cold War "was
a battle for survival," said Hill,
who started work in the 1960s as
a career foreign service officer."It
was brutal."
Although things have changed
drastically since those early days,
Stanford experts say future un
certainties in Eastern Europe will
affect the fragile superpower bal
ance.
Though turbulent, largely un
predictable and sometimes bloody,
the recent European changes have
actually increased the security of
the United States, experts said.
"The instability is not a threat
ening instability — to us," Hill
said.
But some view the changes with
skepticism, arguing that anything

can still happen and that Western
European security could easily be
jeopardized. "I think the danger
is that we are swept up in this
euphoria," said Staar.
The biggest question mark
about NATO and the Warsaw Pact

may be what would happen if Ger
man reunification becomes a
reality. "I think reunification is
inevitable," said Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, a senior research
associate at the arms control cen
ter. "The form that it takes is
relatively unimportant."
Robert Hamrdla, a Stanford lec
turer and expert on East Ger
many, disagreed, saying that
reunification was not necessarily
in the cards. "I don't regard it as
something that will happen quick
ly," Hamrdla said.
Perhaps more important than
reunification is the question of
whether Gorbachev can remain in
control of the Soviet Union in the
wake of increasing criticism.
Gorbachev's perestroika, a re
structuring of the Soviet economy,
has met with little luck — a
"resounding failure," in Perry's
words.
Opposition to his domestic and
foreign policies are growing in the
Politburo, the military and the
people, particularly in the face of

recent ethnic riots in Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
Although he said he does not
see a possible successor to Gor
bachev, Holloway said, "There's
constant speculation of a coup."
Holloway and others said a mil
itary coup is unlikely, but cer
tainly possible.
In October, the Communist
Party Congress will meet, and it
could oust Gorbachev as general
secretary of the Communist
Party. "If I were betting, I would
bet that he'll be out by October,"
said Staar.
Because of the uncertainties
and what is perceived to be a lin
gering possibility of danger, Stan
ford experts urged that the United
States must plan carefully.
Business Prof. George Shultz,
who was secretary of state during
much of the Reagan administra
tion, urged in a campus speech
last week to be cautious about
dropping readiness.
"I think you have to be clear
headed about it,"he said. "They

can wipe us out."
Said Hill, "I don't think we can
ever afford to relax."

for strategic and conventional
arms control.

Editor's note: This is the second
article in a three-part series about
how Stanford experts view the on
going changes in Eastern Europe.

As Eastern European countries
redefine their roles in the world,
Stanford experts agree that the
Warsaw Pact and NATO can no
longer be viewed as competing
military alliances.
Particularly difficult to resolve
is the issue of what role the War
saw Pact will play in the security
of the Soviet Union. When Josef
Stalin extended military control
over Eastern Europe after World
War 11, he defended the move by
saying the Soviet Union needed
a buffer from Western aggression.
With the Cold War buried, So
viet policy-makers are beginning
to think the buffer is expendable,
and so is the Warsaw Pact as a
military alliance.
"They realize that we are not
a threat," said Hoover Senior Fel
low Richard Staar, President
Reagan's ambassador to the
Vienna conventional arms control
talks until 1983. "Who wants
these East European countries?
They're basket cases."
Even if the Soviets wanted to
keep Eastern Europe as a military
buffer, Gorbachev has loosened
the reins holding together the
Eastern European countries, and
the Soviet leader will find it im
possible to control those countries
again, experts agree.
"As a military alliance, it is al

ready, de facto, dead," note*
William Perry, co-director of Stan
ford's Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control.
"I think they would want to
keep the Warsaw Pact together
as a loose political alliance," said
Political Science Prof. David Hol
loway, a researcher at the arms
control center. "I think they
realize that they can't operate the
pact like they did before because
of democratic changes."

"This is a really fundamental
shift, in my mind, in Soviet mil
itary policy," said Holloway, a top
expert on the Soviet military.
The Soviet Union, experts said,
will now be resigned to the fact
that pact troops from Eastern Eu
rope cannot be relied upon in mil
itary action.
A Soviet general leading troops
into battle would not know
whether his troops will fire, es
pecially against a popular rebel

lion in the Eastern European
country. "Would that give you a
warm feeling in the pit of your
stomach?" asked Perry.
The Soviets and the other mem
bers of the pact are not the only
ones questioning their future Eu
ropean roles.
"I think there is a question for
the U.S. about what role the U.S.
wants to play in Europe," said
Holloway.
The NATO alliance of Western
powers has always assumed the
Soviet Union had a far superior
army to fight in Europe. The War
saw Pact armies outnumber
NATO forces by hundreds of thou
sands of soldiers.
To counter Soviet conventional
superiorly, NATO's main func
tion has been to deter a conven
tional attack with nuclear forces.
With the pact crumbling,
NATO's nuclear attack force in
Europe is becoming less strategi
cally important. Stanford experts
expect that like the pact, NATO
will become much more politically
oriented.
"To me, NATO is a world or
ganization with world interests,"
said Hoover Institution Senior Re
search Fellow Charles Hill, who
was a high-ranking official in
Reagan's State Department.

From the early years after
World War 11, the battleground
for the Cold War has been Eastern
Europe, caught between the forces
of the West and the East. In that
respect, several professors inter
viewed suggested Eastern Europe
should be called Central Europe
to emphasize that point.
For decades, the Cold War "was
a battle for survival," said Hill,
who started work in the 1960s as
a career foreign service officer."It
was brutal."
Although things have changed
drastically since those early days,
Stanford experts say future un
certainties in Eastern Europe will
affect the fragile superpower bal
ance.
Though turbulent, largely un
predictable and sometimes bloody,
the recent European changes have
actually increased the security of
the United States, experts said.
"The instability is not a threat
ening instability — to us," Hill
said.
But some view the changes with
skepticism, arguing that anything

can still happen and that Western
European security could easily be
jeopardized. "I think the danger
is that we are swept up in this
euphoria," said Staar.
The biggest question mark
about NATO and the Warsaw Pact

may be what would happen if Ger
man reunification becomes a
reality. "I think reunification is
inevitable," said Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, a senior research
associate at the arms control cen
ter. "The form that it takes is
relatively unimportant."
Robert Hamrdla, a Stanford lec
turer and expert on East Ger
many, disagreed, saying that
reunification was not necessarily
in the cards. "I don't regard it as
something that will happen quick
ly," Hamrdla said.
Perhaps more important than
reunification is the question of
whether Gorbachev can remain in
control of the Soviet Union in the
wake of increasing criticism.
Gorbachev's perestroika, a re
structuring of the Soviet economy,
has met with little luck — a
"resounding failure," in Perry's
words.
Opposition to his domestic and
foreign policies are growing in the
Politburo, the military and the
people, particularly in the face of

recent ethnic riots in Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
Although he said he does not
see a possible successor to Gor
bachev, Holloway said, "There's
constant speculation of a coup."
Holloway and others said a mil
itary coup is unlikely, but cer
tainly possible.
In October, the Communist
Party Congress will meet, and it
could oust Gorbachev as general
secretary of the Communist
Party. "If I were betting, I would
bet that he'll be out by October,"
said Staar.
Because of the uncertainties
and what is perceived to be a lin
gering possibility of danger, Stan
