# Arms control director predicts U.S. defense slashing
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
As a sign of the changing
times, the United States will
probably have to slash the de
fense budget by 20 to 25 percent
in the next five years, according
to a recent Stanford report.
William Perry, co-director of
the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control, sug
gests in the report that budget
cuts can be made because of
substantial changes in the three
factors affecting national
security — the Cold War, the
structure of the NATO alliance
and U.S. economic strength.
Perry writes that "if Gorba
chev prevails with his new
thinking and the Soviet Union
continues to reduce its military
strength and moves to a truly
defensive posture, the United
States will have the basis for a

complete reformulation of its
defense strategy."
The report, titled "Defense In
vestment: A Strategy for the
19905," was recently published
by the arms control center.
Perry insists that the massive
cuts could be devastating unless
planned careflilly. "The Defense
Department cannot deal effec
tively with a budget problem of
the magnitude I have described
by tinkering at the margins,"
he writes.
He writes that "there is a tick
ing time bomb of programs,
started in the last five years,
that could not be completed at
the budget levels I have postu
lated."
But Perry warns that without
careful cuts, the United States
could be left with a "hollow
army," as was the case after
previous defense cuts. Instead,
he suggests that the United

States should "place a premium
on readiness."
Perry writes that his plan
M hedges against unexpected
reversals in the foreign policy
of the Soviet Union, or new
threats arising elsewhere in the
world."
To avoid the hollow army,
Perry suggests a specific plan
to cut defense. As a former un
dersecretary for defense in the
Carter administration, Perry is
in a unique position to under
stand the complex military
budget process.
In the paper, Perry outlines
the four sectors of defense
budget: personnel, research and
development, modernization,
and operations and support.
Perry suggests keeping the
operations and support budget
at its current level per soldier
deployed and keeping the moder
nization budget at current levels.
To cut the budget, research and
development should be reduced in
proportion to the decrease in the
overall defense budget, he writes.
Further, the personnel budget
should be decreased in proportion
to the number of soldiers cut.
As an example, Perry uses the
scenario of a 3 percent defense
budget cut. With Perry's formula,
research and development should
be cut by 3 percent. To compensate
for a steady modernization
budget, troops would have to be
cut by about 4 percent and that

would mean a 4 percent cut in
both the personnel, and opera
tions and support budgets.
To lessen the cuts' impact on
national security, Perry maintains
that treaty negotiation is abso
lutely necessary.
Perry points out that many ci
vilian personnel can be cut from
the defense budget, some through
scheduled or early retirements.
The reductions, in Perry's opin
ion, can be as deep as 20 percent.
Further, if the United States
signs the Conventional Forces in
Europe Treaty that is now on the
negotiating table, the United
States could cut back on troops
by anywhere from 30,000 to
200,000 soldiers. Conventional
forces comprise 80 percent of the

U.S. defense budget.
However, he writes, uni
lateral reductions in U.S. person
nel would be a mistake.
To maintain readiness, Perry
suggests keeping strong tactical
air units, marines, special
operations forces and rapid
deployment units.
If the United States makes the
changes that Perry suggests, it
will save about $300 billion from
the budget projections made by
former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
Yet, as Perry notes, the pro
posed cuts will still leave the de
fense budget at a higher level, in
real terms, than it was when Pres
ident Reagan took office.

that treaty negotiation is abso
lutely necessary.
Perry points out that many ci
vilian personnel can be cut from
the defense budget, some through
scheduled or early retirements.
The reductions, in Perry's opin
ion, can be as deep as 20 percent.
Further, if the United States
signs the Conventional Forces in
Europe Treaty that is now on the
negotiating table, the United
States could cut back on troops
by anywhere from 30,000 to
200,000 soldiers. Conventional
forces comprise 80 percent of the

U.S. defense budget.
However, he writes, uni
lateral reductions in U.S. person
nel would be a mistake.
To maintain readiness, Perry
suggests keeping strong tactical
air units, marines, special
operations forces and rapid
deployment units.
If the United States makes the
changes that Perry suggests, it
will save about $300 billion from
the budget projections made by
former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
Yet, as Perry notes, the pro
posed cuts will still leave the de
fense budget at a higher level, in
real terms, than it was when Pres
ident Reagan took office.
