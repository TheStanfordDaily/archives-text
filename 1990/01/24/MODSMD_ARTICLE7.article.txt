# 'Reluctant' Geiger endorses beer ban
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Athletic Director Andy
Geiger has "always been reluc
tant" to ban beer from Stan
ford Stadium, but recent
events, including 27 alcohol
related arrests at this year's
Big Game, caused him to
change his mind.
Geiger co-signed Dean James
Lyons' recently proposed alco
hol regulations, which would
prohibit alcohol beverages, as
well as alcoholic advertise
ments, at all University athletic
events.
"I don't like to search
people's belongings," he said.
But he added that "it's clear
that we've had too many prob
lems."
Geiger said he can no longer
control crowd safety while al
cohol continues to be allowed
inside the stadium.
"I'm very concerned about
what happened this year, espe
cially at Big Game," he said.
"Going to a college football
game ought to be an enjoyable,
peaceful, relaxing afternoon,"
he said. "There shouldn't be
anything oppressive about the
experience."
Several Big Game spectators
and police were hit by rocks
and unopened cans of beer

thrown by intoxicated fans.
Geiger said the current policy
of allowing alcohol into the sta
dium has relied on individual
responsibility for ensuring
public safety.
"But it hasn't worked," he
said. "It didn't work at all well
in the Cal student section.
"If the problem was only
related to Stanford students,
that's something we could work
out," he said. "But the problem
is bigger than that."
Stanford students comprise
less than 10 percent of a crowd

of 70,000 to 86,000 people.
Geiger said that under the pro
posed regulations, Stanford would
not sell beer at the games either.
"We don't want to get into the
problem of carding," he explained.
While the final decision is up
to University President Donald
Kennedy, Geiger said the stadium
restrictions "are pretty firm."
The Athletic Department has al
ready begun enforcing the regula

tion prohibiting alcohol advertise
ments at sporting events.
According to Assistant Athletic
Director James Brungard, the
University stands to lose "not
much at all" by banning the ads.
Profits from advertisements of
alcohol brought in only $5,000 last
season, Brungard said.
The ASSU Council of Presi
dents announced that it was form
ing a student alcohol policy task
force to respond to the recent pro
posal and formulate other possible
solutions to alcohol problems on
campus.
The first meeting will be today

at 3 p.m. in the ASSU offices.
Geiger and Lyons are scheduled
to attend to discuss and explain
their proposal.
The task force will be open to
all interested students and com
munity members, and representa
tives from several campus organ
izations have already agreed to
participate.
These include the Interfrater
nity and Intersorority Councils,
Project RISC, the Graduate Stu
dent Association, resident assis
tants, Senior Class presidents,
house officers, ASSU dorm reps,
ASSU senators and the COP.
