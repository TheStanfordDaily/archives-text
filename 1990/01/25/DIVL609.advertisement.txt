Ski-Bate Gives You
A Half-Price
Adult Lift Ticket
Good news! (Saving
money on lift tickets is
always good news.)
When you buy an adult
all-day lift ticket at our
regular price, you receive
a SKI-BATE good for a
half-price midweek adult
lift ticket.
To top it off, we're closer
than Lake Tahoe, three A
hours from the Bay
Area in the Central
Sierra, and the
road (Hwy. 4)
is always
open.
