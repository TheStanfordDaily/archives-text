WASHINGTON (AP) -
The second phase of the Na
tional Drug Control Strat
egy, to be unveiled tomorrow
by President Bush, will call
for spending more than
$10.5 billion on the war
against drugs in 1991, at
least $1 billion more than
this year, an administration
source said yesterday
Money for the Pentagon's
effort to battle drugs would
rise about 50 percent, from
$880 million this year to
$1.2 billion in fiscal 1991, a
draft of the strategy said.
Congress allocated about
$8.8 billion for the drug war
this fiscal year, about $900
million more than the $7.9
billion sought by Bush in
the strategy unveiled in Sep
tember.
But the new strategy,
basing drug war expendi
tures on new base figures,
says the country is now
spending $9.5 billion, not
$8.8 billion, said the source.
