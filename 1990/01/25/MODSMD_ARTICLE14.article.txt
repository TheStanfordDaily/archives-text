## A name that fits
### 
ONE OF THESE things is not
like the other: Okada,
Ujamaa, Casa Zapata and
. . . Lathrop. Of the four ethnic
theme houses in Stanford's resi
dential system — the Asian-
American, African-American,
Chicano and Mexican-American
and Native American theme houses
— all but one have ethnic names
that reflect the cultures they rep
resent.
But, Lathrop, the Native Amer
ican theme house, bears the
maiden name of Jane Stanford.
A proposal by residents of
Lathrop and the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization seeks to
choose a new name for the house
from a Native American language.
According to a memo distributed
to Row houses by Diana Conklin,
director of the Row, a proposed

name should "seek to reflect what
is unique and valuable about the
house and to convey its spirit."
Lathrop became the Native
American theme house just two
years ago, and a Native American
name would further help to
strengthen the identity of the house
and the community.
After house residents meet and
decide on an appropriate name,
they must submit a proposal with
three or four choices to Conklin
who reviews the proposed names
and submits them to Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Norm Robinson
at Residential Affairs for final ap
proval.
Ethnic theme houses are in
tended to represent and celebrate
a specific culture, and their names
should reflect this mission.
