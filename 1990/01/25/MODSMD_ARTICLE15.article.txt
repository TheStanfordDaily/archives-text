# Filling the lake
## 
### 
TWO YEARS AGO, ASSU
Senate candidate Amol
Doshi promised "a bigger
beach at Lake Lag." This year, the
ASSU can't even promise a lake.
Despite a higher chance that
precipitation levels will allow the
lake — which was empty last year
and only partially filled the year
before — to be filled, ASSU finan
cial" manager Sandra Leal says the
funds don't exist to pay for a
lifeguard to patrol the area.
In the past, Leal said Student
Affairs gave the ASSU the money
to pay the lifeguard. However,
when the Boathouse was torn down
earlier this year because it was
unsafe, the funds for a lifeguard
were reallocated to pay for higher
insurance costs.
Now the ASSU may have to
make a choice between not having
a full lake or redirecting some
funds, but Leal questioned

whether students care.
The answer could come loud and
clear from the windsurfing and
sailing students who had to be
transported to and from Felt Lake
last spring for class. The courses
are traditionally some of the most
popular at Stanford, and the
money saved by not needing to get
transportation for those students
could decrease the actual cost of
paying a lifeguard.
More fundamentally, the poten
tial glitch in filling the lake accen
tuates the need for the ASSU to
search for a new insurance carrier.
Earlier this year, the sharply in
creased premiums — despite the
ASSU's removal of large liabilities
like the Boathouse — sent the
Senior Class scrambling to find an
alternate insurance plan.
Whatever solution they choose,
the ASSU should let Mother Na
ture decide the status of Lake Lag.
