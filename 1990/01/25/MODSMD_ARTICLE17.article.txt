## The 						'model minorityâ€™ myth 
### 
ASIAN-AMERICANS HAVE typi
cally been classified as the "model
minority," as an idealized minority
group that has seemingly made it in
America. At the core of this classification
is the belief that Asian-Americans are
free from the dilemmas of racism, poverty
and a lack of education that plague other
ethnic minorities. As a people, they seem
prosperous, fitting nicely into America's
melting pot.
At Stanford, this belief seems to ring
true. With the percentage of Asian- Amer
ican undergraduates well over twice the
percentage of Asian-Americans in
America, it's hard to argue that Asian-
Americans experience serious hurdles to
an education.
It's also hard to argue that Asian-
Americans have problems with poverty
when the Asian-Americans here at Stan
ford have the same types of clothes, drive
the same types of cars and go home to
the same types of houses that everyone"
else does. *""" m
And it's difficult to argue about anti-
Asian racism when an Asian-American
can walk through White Plaza, or sit at
the Coffee House, or simply go to class
free from racial slurs.
Asian-Americans seem to get along just
fine here at Stanford. They join frater
nities and sororities, participate in stu
dent government and even write for The
Daily.
With so much freedom and opportu
nity, why should we bother anyone with
the educational plight of the Asian-
Americans who seemingly have it all?
The key word to remember here is
myth. Even though the rosy picture of
Stanford and the nation may say other

wise, simple facts prove the notion of a
model minority to be wrong.
The belief that Asian-Americans enjoy
a high degree of success ignores the fact
that 35.1 percent of Vietnamese, 47 per
cent of Cambodians, 65 percent of the
Hmong and 67 percent of Laotians live
below the poverty level. When compared
with only 9.6 percent of all Americans
living below the poverty level, a dilemma
arises that can't be shrugged off with a
simple, "They're just lazy."
Even here at Stanford, the idea of a
model minority just doesn't wash. On
one hand, we have a high number of
Asian-Americans in the classrooms. But
on the other hand, we have an equally
high number of Asian-Americans in the
United Stanford Workers, fighting for
fair working and living conditions. In
terms of educational and economic op
portunity, many Asian-Americans are
stili impoverished, while others
seemingly have it all.
So what's the concern? Why worry
about a myth that makes your people
look good, while other minorities are
fighting to remove negative stereotypes?
The fact of the matter is that this so
called complimentary stereotype is
destructive.
In terms of help in the form of affirm
ative action, the model minority myth
keeps much needed aid away from truly
needy and truly deserving Asian-
Americans. With the belief that Asian-
Americans are successful, many schools,
including UC-Berkeley just this year,
have ceased affirmative action for Asian-
Americans.
In addition, the model minority myth
has been used to reduce aid to other

minorities. The argument is that if Asian-
Americans can succeed, all other
minorites should as well. Aside from
being untrue, this argument pits minority
group against minority group, and is ul
timately destructive.
On the personal level, it creates anxiety
for the Asian-American who feels that
he or she must live up to the unreal
standards of his or her race.
So what's to be done?
Is affirmative action the answer? Or
is it just replacing racism with more rac
ism 7 Does affirmative action target the
wrong 'people, helping the Asian- Amer
icans that are-ftlready educated and suc
cessful, leaving the truly needy behind?
Can we justify it's racist nature in our
endeavor to speed up the equalizing proc
ess?
These questions don't have any easy
answers. They're problematic in their
very nature. That's the point. There is
a problem here, and its solution does not
lie in our ignoring it or avoiding it, hoping
that the natural wheels of America will
grind it out. It's not going to go away
until all of us get in there, do some hard
thinking and take some action.
