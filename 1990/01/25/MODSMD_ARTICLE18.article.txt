## Condemning homosexuality is violently dehumanizing 
### 
WHAT CAN IT possibly mean
when 13 percent of Stanford's
freshmen class condemns
homosexual relations? It says a lot
about gays, life on the Stanford
campus and a certain sector of our
freshmen class.
Poignantly, it tells how for gays, life
on the Stanford campus can be jeopar
dized by the attitudes represented by
this uncompassionate percentage. It
sickens me to think that anybody,
especially a student at this supposedly
pluralistic, diverse institution, could
check a box stating that he condemns
the personal relations of someone else.
Perhaps someone could feel uncom
fortable with the notion; he could
certainly decide it is not for him. But

to inflict this view upon others and
condemn their behaviors? Just what is
it about homosexual relationships that
13 percent find so offensive? It obvi
ously can't be the quality of the rela
tionships, or the amount of love in
volved; the condemnation included my
intimate friendship with my former
lover as well as my one-night stands.
I truly wish I could understand the
reasoning of this 13 percent, because
such opinions have dangerous conse
quences for me personally. When a
group of people say that they condemn
homosexual relationships, they are
condemning my validity.
They are condemning most of my
past and all of my present love inter
ests, as well as the majority of my

friendships. With such a loss, I would
cease to be what I define for myself as
human. The truly frightening aspect of
this 13 percent's bias is that it denies
me as a person, based merely on the
gender of whom I choose to love. Once
dehumanized, I am more vulnerable to
attack.
When I hear that 13 percent of our
freshmen class condemns me without
even knowing me, I recall how truly
frightened and enraged I felt last year
while reading "faggots deserve to be
killed" in front of Stanford's post
office. In this context it is easier to
understand why I cringe any time I
hear my dormmates refer to people as
"fags." These attacks on my lifestyle

are too similar to threats on my life.
I would like to ask 13 percent of the
Class of '93 to consider what they are
saying when they condemn homosexual
relations. I question whether they
mean to be as violent as I am taking
them to be. I ask what is it about my
having a boyfriend that offends them
so, and where do they get off con
demning me?
Finally, I would like to ask everyone
reading this letter to imagine how they
would feel walking up to the post
office and read a death threat. Perhaps
that can best explain this "faggot with
a cause." I'm fighting for my life.
