# Escort service needs student fees to promote safety
## 
### 
I am writing on behalf of Stanford
United for Rape Elimination (more
popularly known as S.U.R.E. Escort
Service) to express my thoughts about
a problem that we and most other
special-fee organizations here at Stan
ford experienced during fall quarter,
that is, a shortage of funds due to an
inordinately high number of students
requesting a fee refund from our or
ganization.
As it happened, 37.4 percent of the
student body requested a refund from
us last quarter. This caused our group
to be short approximately $1,900 over
and above the 25 percent (or $4,500)
of our budget allocated to cover ASSU
refunds.
This 37.4 percent is a sharp contrast
to the number of voters last spring

who voted not to give refunding to
S.U.R.E. It suggests to me that there
are a great number of people out there
who think that S.U.R.E. is a worth
while service as long as they don't
have to sacrifice their $1.68 per quar
ter to fund it.
With the recent surge in sexually
related crimes on campus, it is time
for the students to assess what they
want from the service. After receiving
a voice of concern from the Council of
Presidents — the representatives of the
students' interests on campus — we
extended our hours during Dead Week
beyond normal and kept the service
open during finals as well. This caused
an extra $600 drain to our already
battered budget, but we definitely felt
that the expense was warranted.
However, there is only so much
blood one can squeeze from a turnip,
and if the pattern of refunds continues
during this quarter, it is questionable
that we will be able to offer this exten
sion of our service again, and our pres
ent services may even need to be cur
tailed.

To answer the major questions the
public might have about our service,
we offer golf cart nighttime escorts to
women not wanting to walk alone on
campus at night. The majority of our
budget, therefore, is devoted to wages
for the escorts and upkeep of the golf
carts.
These two areas account for approxi
mately 75 percent of our annual
budget (the other major expenditure
being publicity). As it stands we have
no way of reducing these expenditures
and still providing service of acceptable
quality. The only option to paying our
workers is not paying them; reducing
their wages is out of the question
since most of them currently make
under campus minimum wage.
It is our feeling that for a service
such as this we need reliability and
coordination, two things that would be
sharply lacking if the service were to
be run on a volunteer basis.
As for the carts, if we were to elimi
nate them, we would cause substantial
delays to people wanting escorts given

the volume of calls we are currently
receiving.
What we are up against now is the
question that each student must ask
her or himself: "Is it worth $1.68 per
quarter to me to know that when I or
a female friend of mine is in a situa
tion where they do not feel comforta
ble walking alone at night that a reli
able alternative to that fear is avail
able?" I urge all students to think
about this question before going in to
receive their winter quarter refund.
