## Changing sorority bid system will benefit sororities and rushees 
### 
WE WOULD LIKE to clear up
some misconceptions we feel
were presented in Monday's
Daily article on this year's sorority
rush. Our intentions in changing last
year's bid system are to benefit both
sororities and rushees.
The following observations have been
made about Stanford's previous guar
anteed bid system:
• Over 90 percent of rushees last
year opted out of receiving a guaran
teed bid by not listing all seven sorori
ties on their final ranking.
• If a rushee did participate in the
guaranteed bid system, she faced the
possiblity of receiveing a bid from a
sorority she did not wish to join. If
this situation arose, she might decline
the bid or eventually de-pledge, thus

We are not attempting to exclude women from
the sorority system; we are trying to be more
honest, fair and realistic. These changes are
supported by the majority of Stanford sororities,
both large and small.

hurting the rushee, the sorority and
the entire system.
• Under the previous system, the
rushee had no way of telling which
sororities were most interested in her.
Without this feedback, she might con
tinue to rank other sororities above

ones that are actively recruiting her,
resulting in misconceptions about
sororities' preferences. She might miss
out on the opportunity to attend a
party where she would be treated with
the most consideration and attention.
The Invite/Regret system that ISC

will be implementing this year, which
does not guarantee each woman a bid,
should avoid these problems in the
following way:
After initially meeting all of the
sororities twice, the rushee will receive
invitations from sororities that believe
she will feel most comfortable as part
of their group. This way, she will know
that she is welcome and actively
recruited at every party she attends.
Both sorority and rushee will have a
more realistic idea of what group the
rushee may actually join. The entire
experience should be better for all
women involved.
With this year's rush changes, the
ISC hopes to avoid some of the rejec
tion and disappointment that was
characteristic of the guaranteed bid

system. In addition to the new bid
system, we are expanding our rush
counselor program to help the rushees
make thoughtful decisions about choos
ing a group in which they will be the
happiest.
We are not attempting to exclude
women from the sorority system, we
are trying to be more honest, fair and
realistic. These changes are supported
by the majority of Stanford sororities,
both large and small. Our intentions
are to ensure a positive experience for
all parties involved: the Greek system,
the individual sororities and, most
importantly, the rushee.
