## Azzi-less Cardinal regroups for 'Cats VanDerveer says team can take game to another level Arizona 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Guard Angela Taylor makes a good pass and a
cheer erupts from the sidelines. Forward Chris Mac-
Murdo blocks a shot and they shout their approval.
They are Julie Zeilstra, Trisha Stevens and Jen
nifer Azzi, and they're all on exercise bicycles watch
ing the team scrimmage. Zeilstra and Stevens
normally sit out of practice the day after a game.
Azzi, however, wishes she was out there. It's just
that, because of her sprained ankle, she is in no
condition to play.
Of course, Azzi was not supposed to be able to
play in Tuesday night's game against No. 6 Long
Beach State. "[Tuesday] night was kind of a unique
situation because of television (the game was on
ESPN) and the caliber of the team," Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "[Jennifer] probably shouldn't
have played."
Still, she was in the starting lineup for the 102nd
straight game. Even though she only saw limited
action, it was obvious she gave the team an emo
tional boost. She will miss tonight's game with
Arizona.
In an odd way, Azzi's iryury may help the Cardinal
down the road. VanDerveer has been talking about
how important it is to get contributions from the
bench on the perimeter. Tuesday night, she got just
what she was looking for.
Stacy Parson and Martha Richards both came up
with superb performances. VanDerveer was pleased
not only with their scoring (they combined for 16
points), but also with their rebounding, passing and
defense. "I thought [Stacy] was fabulous," she said.
"What could you ask for that she didn't do."
VanDerveer said she was provided with a seven
page report card on the team by the legendary Pete
Newell who attended the game with Long Beach.
The report contained repeated references to the
unselfishness of the Cardinal. It went on to com
mend the team's commitment to defense.


Al Green â€” Dally file
With Jennifer Azzl sidelined because of a sprained ankle, senior forward Katy Steding will be called
on to pick up the offensive slack tonight against Arizona at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
