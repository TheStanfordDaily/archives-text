## Azzi-less Cardinal regroups for 'Cats VanDerveer says team can take game to another level Arizona 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Guard Angela Taylor makes a good pass and a
cheer erupts from the sidelines. Forward Chris Mac-
Murdo blocks a shot and they shout their approval.
They are Julie Zeilstra, Trisha Stevens and Jen
nifer Azzi, and they're all on exercise bicycles watch
ing the team scrimmage. Zeilstra and Stevens
normally sit out of practice the day after a game.
Azzi, however, wishes she was out there. It's just
that, because of her sprained ankle, she is in no
condition to play.
Of course, Azzi was not supposed to be able to
play in Tuesday night's game against No. 6 Long
Beach State. "[Tuesday] night was kind of a unique
situation because of television (the game was on
ESPN) and the caliber of the team," Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "[Jennifer] probably shouldn't
have played."
Still, she was in the starting lineup for the 102nd
straight game. Even though she only saw limited
action, it was obvious she gave the team an emo
tional boost. She will miss tonight's game with
Arizona.
In an odd way, Azzi's iryury may help the Cardinal
down the road. VanDerveer has been talking about
how important it is to get contributions from the
bench on the perimeter. Tuesday night, she got just
what she was looking for.
Stacy Parson and Martha Richards both came up
with superb performances. VanDerveer was pleased
not only with their scoring (they combined for 16
points), but also with their rebounding, passing and
defense. "I thought [Stacy] was fabulous," she said.
"What could you ask for that she didn't do."
VanDerveer said she was provided with a seven
page report card on the team by the legendary Pete
Newell who attended the game with Long Beach.
The report contained repeated references to the
unselfishness of the Cardinal. It went on to com
mend the team's commitment to defense.


Al Green — Dally file
With Jennifer Azzl sidelined because of a sprained ankle, senior forward Katy Steding will be called
on to pick up the offensive slack tonight against Arizona at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Basically, Newell's analysis de
scribed all the things Stanford did
right that could "stop a team" if
they were done wrong, VanDer
veer added.
But don't believe the good news
makes VanDerveer complacent.
"We really want to re-focus on
our goals," she said. High on that
list of goals is what VanDerveer
called "getting the dirty work
done — rebounding, setting

screens." She talked about how
important it was to keep the con
centration level high as the stretch
run approaches. "Last year, our
last seven games we took off . . .
some coaches call it peaking," she
said. "I hope we're ready to take
off."
Observers of the Cardinal
might find it hard to believe the
team can take it to a higher gear.
After scoring another dominant
victory over a top-10 team, one
finds it hard to imagine there
could be a better women's basket
ball team in the U.S. of A. The
notion that this better team may

emerge from must be frightening
to prospective opponents.
For the Stanford women,
though, it's a notion that makes
perfect sense. They know there is
a possible national championship
waiting in the not-too-distant fu
ture — as long as they keep fo
cused and keep working on the
little things.
Card notes
Stanford players dominate the
Pacifi' 10 Conference statistics.
Stevens, Zeilstra, Katy
St» Jing and Val Whiting are all
among the'Pac- 10's top 15 scorers.

Whiting's 8.0 rebounds per game
place her sixth in the Pac-10, while
Steding's 6.9 are good for ninth place.
Whiting, Azzi and Stevens hold the
fifth through seventh' spots among the
field goal percentage leaders.
Whiting, who is only a freshman,
also is the second-leading shot blocker
at nearly two per game. Azzi, Stevens
and Zeilstra make the top-10 free
throw shooting list. Finally, Steding
and Sonja Henning find themselves
among the steal leaders.
Stevens' 35-point performance
Tuesday was not only a career high,
it was the largest scoring total by a
Pac-10 player this season.

Still, she was in the starting lineup for the 102nd
straight game. Even though she only saw limited
action, it was obvious she gave the team an emo
tional boost. She will miss tonight's game with
Arizona.
In an odd way, Azzi's iryury may help the Cardinal
down the road. VanDerveer has been talking about
how important it is to get contributions from the
bench on the perimeter. Tuesday night, she got just
what she was looking for.
Stacy Parson and Martha Richards both came up
with superb performances. VanDerveer was pleased
not only with their scoring (they combined for 16
points), but also with their rebounding, passing and
defense. "I thought [Stacy] was fabulous," she said.
"What could you ask for that she didn't do."
VanDerveer said she was provided with a seven
page report card on the team by the legendary Pete
Newell who attended the game with Long Beach.
The report contained repeated references to the
unselfishness of the Cardinal. It went on to com
mend the team's commitment to defense.


Al Green — Dally file
With Jennifer Azzl sidelined because of a sprained ankle, senior forward Katy Steding will be called
on to pick up the offensive slack tonight against Arizona at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Basically, Newell's analysis de
scribed all the things Stanford did
right that could "stop a team" if
they were done wrong, VanDer
veer added.
But don't believe the good news
makes VanDerveer complacent.
"We really want to re-focus on
our goals," she said. High on that
list of goals is what VanDerveer
called "getting the dirty work
done — rebounding, setting

screens." She talked about how
important it was to keep the con
centration level high as the stretch
run approaches. "Last year, our
last seven games we took off . . .
some coaches call it peaking," she
said. "I hope we're ready to take
off."
Observers of the Cardinal
might find it hard to believe the
team can take it to a higher gear.
After scoring another dominant
victory over a top-10 team, one
finds it hard to imagine there
could be a better women's basket
ball team in the U.S. of A. The
notion that this better team may

emerge from must be frightening
to prospective opponents.
For the Stanford women,
though, it's a notion that makes
perfect sense. They know there is
a possible national championship
waiting in the not-too-distant fu
ture — as long as they keep fo
cused and keep working on the
little things.
Card notes
Stanford players dominate the
Pacifi' 10 Conference statistics.
Stevens, Zeilstra, Katy
St» Jing and Val Whiting are all
among the'Pac- 10's top 15 scorers.

Whiting's 8.0 rebounds per game
place her sixth in the Pac-10, while
Steding's 6.9 are good for ninth place.
Whiting, Azzi and Stevens hold the
fifth through seventh' spots among the
field goal percentage leaders.
Whiting, who is only a freshman,
also is the second-leading shot blocker
at nearly two per game. Azzi, Stevens
and Zeilstra make the top-10 free
throw shooting list. Finally, Steding
and Sonja Henning find themselves
among the steal leaders.
Stevens' 35-point performance
Tuesday was not only a career high,
it was the largest scoring total by a
Pac-10 player this season.
