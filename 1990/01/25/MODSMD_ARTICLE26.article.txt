# Baseball hungry for No. 1 again

If you've been avoiding local sports sections
because you're sick of seeing headlines like
"Seifert installs game plan — players re
spond well," or "Seifert says McKyer isn't
boring" or even "Seifert still prefers oat bran,"
have faith. The Super Bowl will be over in 80
hours and 37 minutes.
The media coverage will be over in six weeks.
That'll be just in time for the stories on
the Giants and A's to kick into high gear again
(oh boy!), unless the threatened players'
strike/owner lockout takes place. I'm pretty
ambivalent about a strike — I love baseball,
but then again the thought of a spring quarter
with no stories about Jose's cars or Will's
unbelievably ridiculous salary sounds appeal

Besides, the real baseball season starts this
weekend. For a great many college baseball
teams, tomorrow is Opening Day, the one day
of the year when every team is the best in
the country, every player believes he can be

a chance of becoming sweet reality.
And this year, Opening Day comes not a

saw last year's dreams crash and burn. After
being tabbed the preseason No. 1, the Stanford
baseball team stumbled at the start and never
really got its act together until the last 10
games of the campaign.
By then it was too late. Despite nine wins
in those 10 games, the NCAA told the Cardinal
to stay home during the playoffs — and invited
Rider College. Stanford, two-time defending
College World Series champion, watched the
1989 tournament on television.
Needless to say, it hasn't been a particularly
joyous offseason.
Not that the season itself was loads of
fun. After two years of having things
go right at nearly every turn, two
NCAA Championships and talk of a new col
legiate baseball dynasty, the world caved in
on the Cardinal.
Errors, errors and more errors killed Stan
ford in the first half of the season — £oach
Mark Marquess figures the team blew as many
as eight games because of defensive goofs.
After that, the Cardinal spent the rest of the
year overcoming injuries — most notably to
pitching ace Mike Mussina — and trying to
