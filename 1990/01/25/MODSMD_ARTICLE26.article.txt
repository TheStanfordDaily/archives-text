# Baseball hungry for No. 1 again
## 
### 
If you've been avoiding local sports sections
because you're sick of seeing headlines like
"Seifert installs game plan — players re
spond well," or "Seifert says McKyer isn't
boring" or even "Seifert still prefers oat bran,"
have faith. The Super Bowl will be over in 80
hours and 37 minutes.
The media coverage will be over in six weeks.
That'll be just in time for the stories on
the Giants and A's to kick into high gear again
(oh boy!), unless the threatened players'
strike/owner lockout takes place. I'm pretty
ambivalent about a strike — I love baseball,
but then again the thought of a spring quarter
with no stories about Jose's cars or Will's
unbelievably ridiculous salary sounds appeal
ing.

Besides, the real baseball season starts this
weekend. For a great many college baseball
teams, tomorrow is Opening Day, the one day
of the year when every team is the best in
the country, every player believes he can be
come an immortal, and every dream still has
a chance of becoming sweet reality.
And this year, Opening Day comes not a
minute too soon for the Cardinal nine, which
saw last year's dreams crash and burn. After
being tabbed the preseason No. 1, the Stanford
baseball team stumbled at the start and never
really got its act together until the last 10
games of the campaign.
By then it was too late. Despite nine wins
in those 10 games, the NCAA told the Cardinal
to stay home during the playoffs — and invited
Rider College. Stanford, two-time defending
College World Series champion, watched the
1989 tournament on television.
Needless to say, it hasn't been a particularly
joyous offseason.
Not that the season itself was loads of
fun. After two years of having things
go right at nearly every turn, two
NCAA Championships and talk of a new col
legiate baseball dynasty, the world caved in
on the Cardinal.
Errors, errors and more errors killed Stan
ford in the first half of the season — £oach
Mark Marquess figures the team blew as many
as eight games because of defensive goofs.
After that, the Cardinal spent the rest of the
year overcoming injuries — most notably to
pitching ace Mike Mussina — and trying to


Cameron
Macky
climb out of the muck of its own
mistakes.
That didn't happen until the
final three weeks of the season,
when the team finally started to
play the way it knew it could.
What took so long? .
Senior rightfielder Paul Carey,
who calls last year "an embarrass
ment," isn't sure why 1989 was
a season in hell. Maybe, he says,
the team was content with two
NCAA titles. Or maybe they
didn't respect anyone. Or maybe
they thought they could just walk
on the field and win.

Or maybe there's no simple ex
planation: "As a team, we just
didn't perform the way we should
have," Carey said. "I wish I knew
why."
So, can anything be gained
from a season which started
out poorly and ended with
raised hopes crushed by the
NCAA? Certainly. Last year's
rookies — five of whom started
at one point or another — are a
year wiser. Three sophomores will
start in the field, and one more
at designated hitter, this weekend.
But the experience gained is ac
tually secondary to the other sig
nificant contribution last year
made to the 1990 Stanford Car
dinal: hunger. If last year's team

was content, this one is as dis
satisfied and discontent as it is
possible to be. Practices this fall
gave new meaning to the word
"intense." More running. More 8
a.m. meetings. There's a sense
that no one — players or coaches
— is going to let this season be
anything like the last one.
It's a subtle feeling, but it's
there nonetheless. Marquess says
it's something the team doesn't
really talk about, but it's still in
the back of everyone's minds.
It's that hunger — the feeling
of having something to prove to
themselves and the college
coaches who didn't think Stanford
deserved a tournament bid last
year — that could make the dif
ference this season. This team is

very, very good. It not only has
the potential to win a lot of games,
it has the potential to pummel
people.
With two of the best pitchers
in college baseball and probably
the top power hitter in the coun
try, the Cardinal has talent com
ing out its ears — as much as
any other team in college baseball
— and knows it can beat anyone.
The same could have been said
of last year's squad. This time
around, though, there's a chip on
the team's shoulder.
Don't bet on another embar
rassing season.

mistakes.
That didn't happen until the
final three weeks of the season,
when the team finally started to
play the way it knew it could.
What took so long? .
Senior rightfielder Paul Carey,
who calls last year "an embarrass
ment," isn't sure why 1989 was
a season in hell. Maybe, he says,
the team was content with two
NCAA titles. Or maybe they
didn't respect anyone. Or maybe
they thought they could just walk
on the field and win.

Or maybe there's no simple ex
planation: "As a team, we just
didn't perform the way we should
have," Carey said. "I wish I knew
why."
So, can anything be gained
from a season which started
out poorly and ended with
raised hopes crushed by the
NCAA? Certainly. Last year's
rookies — five of whom started
at one point or another — are a
year wiser. Three sophomores will
start in the field, and one more
at designated hitter, this weekend.
But the experience gained is ac
tually secondary to the other sig
nificant contribution last year
made to the 1990 Stanford Car
dinal: hunger. If last year's team

was content, this one is as dis
satisfied and discontent as it is
possible to be. Practices this fall
gave new meaning to the word
"intense." More running. More 8
a.m. meetings. There's a sense
that no one — players or coaches
— is going to let this season be
anything like the last one.
It's a subtle feeling, but it's
there nonetheless. Marquess says
it's something the team doesn't
really talk about, but it's still in
the back of everyone's minds.
It's that hunger — the feeling
of having something to prove to
themselves and the college
coaches who didn't think Stanford
deserved a tournament bid last
year — that could make the dif
ference this season. This team is

very, very good. It not only has
the potential to win a lot of games,
it has the potential to pummel
people.
With two of the best pitchers
in college baseball and probably
the top power hitter in the coun
try, the Cardinal has talent com
ing out its ears — as much as
any other team in college baseball
— and knows it can beat anyone.
The same could have been said
of last year's squad. This time
around, though, there's a chip on
the team's shoulder.
Don't bet on another embar
rassing season.

If you've been avoiding local sports sections
because you're sick of seeing headlines like
"Seifert installs game plan — players re
spond well," or "Seifert says McKyer isn't
boring" or even "Seifert still prefers oat bran,"
have faith. The Super Bowl will be over in 80
hours and 37 minutes.
The media coverage will be over in six weeks.
That'll be just in time for the stories on
the Giants and A's to kick into high gear again
(oh boy!), unless the threatened players'
strike/owner lockout takes place. I'm pretty
ambivalent about a strike — I love baseball,
but then again the thought of a spring quarter
with no stories about Jose's cars or Will's
unbelievably ridiculous salary sounds appeal
ing.

Besides, the real baseball season starts this
weekend. For a great many college baseball
teams, tomorrow is Opening Day, the one day
of the year when every team is the best in
the country, every player believes he can be
come an immortal, and every dream still has
a chance of becoming sweet reality.
And this year, Opening Day comes not a
minute too soon for the Cardinal nine, which
saw last year's dreams crash and burn. After
being tabbed the preseason No. 1, the Stanford
baseball team stumbled at the start and never
really got its act together until the last 10
games of the campaign.
By then it was too late. Despite nine wins
in those 10 games, the NCAA told the Cardinal
to stay home during the playoffs — and invited
Rider College. Stanford, two-time defending
College World Series champion, watched the
1989 tournament on television.
Needless to say, it hasn't been a particularly
joyous offseason.
Not that the season itself was loads of
fun. After two years of having things
go right at nearly every turn, two
NCAA Championships and talk of a new col
legiate baseball dynasty, the world caved in
on the Cardinal.
