# Wingate has moved from pine time to prime time in no time

### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
There have been a lot of surprises in
the world of collegiate athletics, mostly
bad. Athletes have been found using
drugs, cheating in school, and even com
miting crimes. For Cardinal basketball
Coach Mike Montgomery, however, the
biggest surprise this season has been
100 percent positive.
After seeing little playing time in his
first two seasons, 6-foot-7 forward Des
hon Wingate has been a force this
season, averaging 10.1 points and 6.3
rebounds a game. After serving as the
Cardinal's sixth man most of the year,
Wingate entered the starting lineup last
week and helped Stanford to wins over
then-No. 16 UCLA and USC.
The Cardinal, 12-3 overall and 4-2 in
the Pacific 10 Conference, faces No. 19
Arizona in Tucson tonight where the
Wildcats have won 41 straight games.
And at tipoff, Wingate will be jumping
center for the fourth time this year. As
a reserve, Wingate got a lot of minutes
and a lot of offensive rebounds. But
despite his success off the bench, he
still found it frustrating not to be in
the starting lineup.
"It was hard to take," he said. "It
was kind of frustrating. ... But you
have to go with it and make the most
of it. I didn't let the fact that I didn't
play the first five minutes put a damper
on the rest of the game."
Through it all, Montgomery consid
ered him a key player. "I've said all
along that he's a starter, but I like him
off the bench," Montgomery said. "Des
hon, as I've told him from day one, is
going to have a big impact on our win
ning some games."
Wingate had some big games off the
bench, including a 19-point performance
at UC-Irvine and a 16-point, 11-rebound
effort at Washington State. After that
last game, a 69-49 win in Pullman in
which Wingate also had three dunks,
Montgomery reconsidered his starting
lineup.
"He's given us a lift," Montgomery
said. "At some point he needs to be
rewarded for working hard."
Wingate made his second career start
against UCLA last Thursday (his first
was against Missouri-Kansas City when
Andrew Vlahov was ill) and made his
presence felt immediately. He hit an
18-footer just 22 seconds into the game
to give Stanford a 2-0 lead and hit two
more early jumpers.

The high school center-turned-small
forward finished with 11 points and
nine rebounds in the Cardinal's biggest
win of the season. "[Starting] is a def
inite pick-me-up," Wingate said. "I was
really jacked against UCIJV. I don't like
to lose to UCLA. I don't like to lose to
UCLA at home. Starting was a little
extra."
Two days later, against USC, Wingate
started and tied his career high of 11
boards and scored in double figures. In
Pac-10 games, he is averaging 11 points
and 7.5 rebounds per game after averag
ing 2.2 points and 1.5 rebounds his first
two years.
A part of the reason for his greatly
improved numbers is due to the fact
that Stanford lost six seniors from last
year's team, but most of the credit goes
to Wingate's hard work. He toured in
Hungary last summer with a collection
of Pac-10 all-stars and he feels that
helped him a lot.
"Playing in Hungary was a big con
fidence booster," Wingate said. "I did
well on the tour, so that helped me
tremendously."
UCLA Coach Jim Harrick coached
that team and probably regretted help
ing Wingate when he saw the Cardinal
beat his Bruins last week. "Coach Har
rick helped me a bit on 9ome things I
can work on," Wingate said. "Coach
Harrick told all of us how each of us
could improve, and we helped each other
too."
With renewed confidence, Wingate re
turned for his junior season with some

lofty goals: "To be a big contributor to
the team; to really help the team win;
help show everyone else that we can
still win, that we're still a threat in the
Pac-10."
After being picked to go 7-20 this
year by basketball announcer Dick
Vitale, Stanford is currently 12-3 and
receiving votes in the AP top 25."The
season's gone all right," he said. "It's
going better for me now that I'm in a
starting role. . . . I've done well in more
games than not, and I'm having more
fun in the game of basketball. It's given
me more confidence in my game."
But despite his, and the team's, suc
cess so far, Wingate sees a lot more out
there, like upsetting No. 19 Arizona
tonight. "I think our chances are pretty
good," he said. "If we concentrate on
the things we have to do, realize each
of us can defend our assignment and
each of us can score on the person, then
we can beat them. ... as long as we
have confidence."
"I really want to go down there and
beat them, end their 41-game streak."
And Wingate's goals for himself are
just as lofty. 'Before I graduate I want
to be recognized by the conference on
the all-conference team," he said. "My
main goal right now is working to play
after my career here at Stanford (in
professional baaketball).
I m just trying to improve myself
every day. I'm trying to add equipment
to my tool box If I work hard and
keep improving, I think I can do it."


Fierce rebounding and consistent scoring have propelled Deshon Wlngate Into the
starting lineup. Wlngate and the Cardinal will have to be more than fierce, however
to upset 19th-ranked Arizona tonight In McKale Center.
