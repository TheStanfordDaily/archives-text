KEYS TO VICTORY — The Cardinal has not had a good showing in McKale in some
time, but the biggest reason for that has been the Wildcats' press and suffocating
defense With guard Ken Lofton, the main pressor, graduated and Stanford showing
no signs of press succeptability, the press will likely not be an issue The Cardinal
needs to display good ball movement on offense to open up Keefe and the outside
shooters
