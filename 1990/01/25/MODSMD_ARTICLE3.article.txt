# Experts see hope for arms control treaties

Editor's note: This is the last
in a three-part series examining
how Stanford experts view the on
going changes in Eastern Europe.

As the relevance of NATO and
the Warsaw Pact as military al
liances decays, Stanford arms con
trol experts see more hope for
significant arms reduction by the
superpowers.
Many observers agree that arms
control agreements may be in
creasingly likely because the Cold
War is slowly becoming a relic
which is not likely to return
anytime soon.
"It's perfectly possible they can
declare it (the Cold War) open for
business, but it won't work," said
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Charles Hill. "The snake can wit
her again, but it's a dying snake."
Even an unlikely return to the
Cold War of old will not be a total
loss if treaties are signed and the
Soviets continue to comply, many
of those interviewed said.
And, with the military budgets
of both superpowers dwindling,
experts said that no time is better
than the present for arms reduc
tions, which would be particularly
pronounced in Europe.
Scholars and government offi
cials are coming to a consensus
that the U.S. military budget
must be cut significantly. And
with a perceived decrease in the
Soviet military threat, U.S. cuts
are almost inevitable.
In the Soviet Union, which
spends one quarter of its gross
national product on national se
curity by some estimates, the

budget knife is expected to cut
far deeper into military spending.
Perestroika, the overhaul of the
Soviet economy, requires that vast
military resources be diverted to
social programs.
In East Germany alone, the So
viet Union maintains 20 fully
equipped divisions, a total of
380,000 troops. That army,
crammed in a space about one
half the size of Oregon, is larger
than the U.S. forces in all of Eu
rope.
Facing deep budget cuts, the
Soviets are sure to cut some
troops from Eastern Europe, even
without a treaty, experts said.
"The Soviets are obviously in
terested to redirect the number
of troops in Europe," said Nor
man Naimark, director of the Cen
ter for Russian and Eastern
European Studies.
Some experts, like William
Perry of Stanford's Center for In
ternational Security and Arms
Control, urged that the United
States consider engaging in
"mutual unilateral reductions."
With these kinds of cuts, one su
perpower reduces arms in re
sponse to arms reductions by the
opponent's side.
Though this method lacks im
portant verification measures to
ensure the faith of the cuts,
mutual unilateral reductions can
avoid time-consuining treaty ne
gotiations, Perry said.
Others argued that the United
States should wait for the Soviets
to commit in writing before
making massive cuts. Though
treaties can be broken, countries
can only do so with a loss of in-

the possibility of significant arms reductions in the near future.
ternational trust.
Nevertheless, the stage is set
for an unprecedented agreement
between the United States and
the Soviet Union. Although nu
clear forces have typically been
the sole target of arms control
treaties, the superpowers are
poised to reach agreements on
both nuclear and conventional
weapons.
The Strategic Arms Reductions
Talks treaty, or START treaty,
and the Conventional Forces in
Europe treaty are both in ad
vanced stages of negotiation, and
President Bush hopes to have his
signature on the treaties by the
end of the year.
START is the most wide
reaching agreement yet proposed
by the superpowers. Under
START, each country will be al
lowed only 6,000 weapons on
1,600 ballistic missiles and bomb
ers.
The United States currently
maintains a nuclear force of about
13,000 strategic warheads on
about 2,000 delivery systems, in
cluding missiles and bombers. The
Soviet Union is slightly behind
the U.S., with about 10,600
deliverable strategic warheads
carried on about 2,500 missiles
and bombers.
The Conventional Forces in Eu
rope agreement could impose
stringent limits on the number of
troops, tanks and aircraft allowed
in Europe. The Warsaw Pact has
agreed to reductions to bring the
number of heavy main battle

tanks to 20,000. That would slash
the number of Soviet tanks by
30,000 and trim the number of
U.S. tanks by 2,000.
Also, the Soviets have agreed
in principle to cut ground and air
force personnel to 275,000. That
level would cut the Soviet forces
by 300,000.
"I think it's got to be an ironclad
treaty â€” one that brings parity
to both sides," said Hoover Senior
Fellow Richard Staar. "I don't see
any reason to make concessions
at this point . . . and I think if
they want it, they'll come
around."
In the past, the Soviet Union
has been unwilling for parity be
cause it would mean sacrificing
much of its military advantage.
But Stanford arms control experts
think parity is a realistic goal be
cause the Soviets have broadly
agreed to many U.S. proposals.
Something that has not yet
been resolved and may prove to
be a serious setback to a treaty
agreement is how to compare
forces.
Particularly troublesome is the
issue of what to count as aircraft.
For example, the United States
counts inceptors and trainers, in
which the Warsaw Pact has supe
riority.
Further complicating the pic
ture is the issue of verification
measures. Treaty verification has
been one of the crucial stumbling
blocks that has hampered previ
ous negotiations, although now it
has become far less of a problem
than it was at the beginning of
the 1980s.
"The Soviets would not even
discuss verification methods until
recent years, said Staar, who was

Reagan's ambassador to the
Vienna arms talks from 1981 to
1983. "No progress whatsoever
was made, but it was on the
table."
Significant ground was broken
in 1987 with the Intermediate
Range Nuclear Forces treaty, with
provisions for on-site inspection
of weapons facilities. Stringent
verification procedures became a
msyor stumbling block for the
treaty before the Soviet Union
conceded to American inspection
demands. The INF treaty includes
"the most intrusive verification
method that has been devised,"
said Hill.
The INF verification methods
set the tone for more treaty agree
ments on verification, but conven
tional treaty verification is
expected to be far more compli
cated than verification of nuclear
missiles.
Further, many intrusive
verification methods, such as al
lowing foreign observers into
militarily sensitive areas, is very
dependent upon friendly relations
between superpowers and the
countries hosting the forces.
Experts want to believe that So
viet President Mikhail Gorba
chev's revolution will succeed and
the United States can be confident
of the Soviet Union's motives. But
with partial chaos in the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe,
nobody knows how long this con
fidence in peace can last.
That, experts said, is where
verifiable arms control agree
ments become important. Said
Staar, "We can trust them, but
we can trust them as long as we
can verify that trust."
