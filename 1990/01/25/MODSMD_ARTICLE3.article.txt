# Experts see hope for arms control treaties

Editor's note: This is the last
in a three-part series examining
how Stanford experts view the on
going changes in Eastern Europe.

As the relevance of NATO and
the Warsaw Pact as military al
liances decays, Stanford arms con
trol experts see more hope for
significant arms reduction by the
superpowers.
Many observers agree that arms
control agreements may be in
creasingly likely because the Cold
War is slowly becoming a relic
which is not likely to return
anytime soon.
"It's perfectly possible they can
declare it (the Cold War) open for
business, but it won't work," said
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Charles Hill. "The snake can wit
her again, but it's a dying snake."
Even an unlikely return to the
Cold War of old will not be a total
loss if treaties are signed and the
Soviets continue to comply, many
of those interviewed said.
And, with the military budgets
of both superpowers dwindling,
experts said that no time is better
than the present for arms reduc
tions, which would be particularly
pronounced in Europe.
Scholars and government offi
cials are coming to a consensus
that the U.S. military budget
must be cut significantly. And
with a perceived decrease in the
Soviet military threat, U.S. cuts
are almost inevitable.
In the Soviet Union, which
spends one quarter of its gross
national product on national se
curity by some estimates, the

budget knife is expected to cut
far deeper into military spending.
Perestroika, the overhaul of the
Soviet economy, requires that vast
military resources be diverted to
social programs.
In East Germany alone, the So
viet Union maintains 20 fully
equipped divisions, a total of
380,000 troops. That army,
crammed in a space about one
half the size of Oregon, is larger
than the U.S. forces in all of Eu
rope.
Facing deep budget cuts, the
Soviets are sure to cut some
troops from Eastern Europe, even
without a treaty, experts said.
"The Soviets are obviously in
terested to redirect the number
of troops in Europe," said Nor
man Naimark, director of the Cen
ter for Russian and Eastern
European Studies.
Some experts, like William
Perry of Stanford's Center for In
ternational Security and Arms
Control, urged that the United
States consider engaging in
"mutual unilateral reductions."
With these kinds of cuts, one su
perpower reduces arms in re
sponse to arms reductions by the
opponent's side.
Though this method lacks im
portant verification measures to
ensure the faith of the cuts,
mutual unilateral reductions can
avoid time-consuining treaty ne
gotiations, Perry said.
Others argued that the United
States should wait for the Soviets
to commit in writing before
making massive cuts. Though
treaties can be broken, countries
can only do so with a loss of in-

the possibility of significant arms reductions in the near future.
