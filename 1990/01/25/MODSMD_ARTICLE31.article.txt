Technology conference held today
Nineteen of Italy's leading scientists, engineers
and businessmen and the country's ambassador
to the United States are participating in the first
Italian-American Conference on Technology
Transfers at Stanford today and tomorrow.
The conference is part of a new program in
which Stanford researchers from various disci
plines will take part in scholarly exchange with
their counterparts from universities all over Italy.
Topics to be discussed at the conference include
international scientific exchange, cooperation in
biotechnology, superconductivity, alternative en
ergy sources, factory automation, computer tech
nology and telecommunications.
University President Donald Kennedy will open
the conference this morning. Conference chairs
are Stanford's John Wirth, vice provost; Robert
Hofstadter, professor emeritus of physics; and
Chemistry Prof. Keith Hodgson.
The keynote address will be delivered by
Rinaldo Petrignani, Italy's ambassador to the
United States.
Through the exchange program, announced in
November, the Italians hope to learn about Stan
ford's biotechnology and physics programs and
to adopt new training and administrative struc
tures in science programs.
Kennedy forms quake committee
University President Donald Kennedy has ap
pointed a new commission to study how the Uni
versity can best prepare for the "Big One" â€” or

even another "Pretty Big One."
The commission, co-chaired by Civil Engineer
ing Prof. Haresh Shah and Asst. Provost John
Hughes, is charged with recommending how far
the University should go in trying to reduce the
impact of a future earthquake on academic pro
grams.
Kennedy requested by the end of the quarter
an overall recommendation on "Stanford's vision
for our physical and organizational performance
during and after the next mcgor earthquake."
The Presidential Commission on Earthquake
Risk Management will be divided into two groups.
One will study the vulnerability of campus build
ings; the other will assess the University's general
preparedness for earthquakes and other kinds of
emergencies.
Kennedy noted that earth scientists estimate
a 50 percent chance of a magnitude 7 earthquake
near Stanford on the San Andreas fault or on
the Hayward fault during the next 30 years.
Eating disorder sessions held
Hundreds of Stanford women have eating dis
orders, officials at Cowell Student Health Center
say.
To counter what they consider to be a severe
problem, Counseling and Psychological Services
at Cowell is sponsoring an eating disorders group
for women with bulimia or an obsession with food.
Typically the sessions draw from six to eight
women.
The sessions begin Monday, and women with
eating disorders are asked to call CAPS at 723-
3785 for a pre-group interview or other informa
tion on the program.
