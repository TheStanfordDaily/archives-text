# Columbae to reopen next year
## Church and other dorms remain closed indefinitely 
### Paula Gani Staff writer 
Quake-damaged Columbae House will re-open
next year, University officials said yesterday, but
Memorial Church, the Graduate School of Busi
ness library and three residences remain closed
indefinitely due to the Oct. 17 earthquake.
Engineers have been daunted by the extent of
damage to the interior of the church, and progress
has been slow. "We're still discussing even how
to fix it," said Thomas Dipressi, a manager with
Facilities Project Management. "It's in the
engineering-exploratory mode."
The arches in the church will require rebuilding
in order to bring them up to current earthquake
safety codes, according to Dipressi. Additionally,
experts have been pondering stategies to put
fallen tiles from the ceiling mosaics back into
place.
Damage repairs in the church are "in limbo"
while the University awaits federal funds for the
project, Dipressi said.
Damaged residences are also awaiting
reconstruction, according to Keith Guy, director
of Housing and Food Services.
Guy reaffirmed that Synergy, Phi Psi and Delta

Tau Delta houses will not be completed by next
year, but Columbae "will join the ranks of those
that will be fixed" by next fall. Theta Xi, Durand
and Roth houses are also expected to be occupied
next fall.
Repair work at the Business School is also "in
progress," said project manager Vojka Ivanek of
Facilities Project Management. Displaced faculty
and staff will be able to move back into their
offices next month.
The top three floors of the Business School
have been closed following the quake.
With the exception of Jackson Library, repairs
to the Business School will be completed by April
1, according to Ivanek. The library remains closed
indefinitely.
However, construction is proceeding as planned
on the "quake modulars," or temporary building
units, that will help alleviate the classroom
crunch resulting from the earthquake. Construc
tion began in December on three sets of modular
units, two of which — at Galvez Mall and Roble
Field — have been completed and are currently
holding classes.
Workers are "wrapping up and finishing" the
third site, located in the Wilbur Hall parking lot,
according to Dipressi.
