# Conklin tells stories of segregation
## 
### Bernadine Chee 
Many people learned in elemen
tary school that segregation ended
with the Supreme Court's 1954
decision on the Brown v. Board
of Education case.
But according to Diana Conklin,
assistant dean of Residential Af
fairs, segregation was "alive and
kicking" years after the Supreme
Court's decision barring it.
Conklin told her stories of seg
regation before and after 1954 to
about 30 people at the Sigma Chi
house Tuesday night.
When she was still a child in
southern Florida, she became
very conscious of segregation
when she accompanied her father
one day on an errand.
Her father left her in the truck
while he went to do the errand.
While he was gone, Conklin,
who is white, played with a little
black girl.
When her father returned, he
became very upset and upon their
return home put Conklin upstairs
in her room. He told her to "think
about what she had done" and to

come out only
when she had an
apology.
Conklin was in
a quandary about
what wrong she
had committed,
and her mother
finally explained
kindly to Conklin
the simple rule

that "we are not to talk to them."
In 1961, seven years after
Brown v. Board of Education,
Conklin was 15. When she rode
the bus she would sit at the back
"because it was exciting" — most
of all because it made everyone
on the bus noticeably uncomfort
able.
Once as she was about to take
a seat at the back of a bus, a
black man accidently "met her
gaze." Conklin noted that another
rule in the South was that a black
man did not look at a white wom
an.
When she related the story to
her family that evening, her
father became so upset that he
grabbed a shotgun and said, "I'm

gonna kill him."
Her mother managed to take
the gun away, and from that in
cident, said Conklin with a smile,
she learned never to tell her
father anything.
But perhaps Conklin's most re
vealing story concerned her expe
rience as an intern with the Miami
Herald in 1965, more than a dec
ade after the segregation ruling.
While working on the night
shift, she went with staff members
to cover a Ku Klux KJan rally.
About 10,000 people were gath
ered with crosses the size of tele
phone poles. Conklin listened to
speeches, including one by a Bap
tist minister who called for the
annihilation of the black race.
Conklin's experiences have
never left her, and much of the
discussion in the program cen
tered on thinking of ways to fight
racism.
Conklin noted that the burden
of racism is too often borne on
the shoulders of people of color,
and that people who are not direct
victims of racism should also
struggle against it.
