THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan / A stately
pleasure dome decree."
—Samuel Taylor Coleridge
Palo Alto has a pleasure dome of its
own. The Stanford Theater on University
Avenue is the Bay Area's answer to the
Alhambra. As the lights dim within this
stately pleasure dome of the silver screen,
golden pineapples and emerald palm
fronds fade into the gentle night that
enfolds the courtyard. Without the pro
tective embrace of the cupola-studded
walls, the soft twilight deepens into in
digo darkness.
This stunning movie palace, its
ceilings graced with sinuous arabesques,
was recently restored to its "art deco"
splendour by silver screen enthusiast Da
vid Packard.
The Stanford, built in 1925, was once
a showcase for both the motion-picture
masterpieces and the ephemeral failures
of Hollywood's studio era. But the old
Stanford, with its single large screen and
its 1,250-seat auditorium, could not
compete for movie-going audiences with
the multi-screen theaters of the '70s and
'80s.
It seemed that the Stanford Theater
was doomed to go the way of other old
movie palaces. In the early '80s, its

owners were planning to convert the
movie house into office space. But in
1987, the David and Lucille Packard
Foundation bought the theater and began
a two-year, $6 million restoration project
aimed at recreating a proper showcase
for the films of Hollywood's Golden Age.
Restoration of the theater was super
vised by David Packard who serves as
president of the foundation that operates
the theater on a non-profit basis.
"We want to run the theater as an
educational project," Packard said. "We're
planning several festivals to showcase
the films of different artists and directors
who contributed to the film industry dur
ing the years of the silver screen."
Tomorrow the Stanford Theater Foun
dation and the Institute of the American
Musical will begin a new festival, "The
Warner Bros. Musical (1933-1939)." The
festival will run through Feb. 15.
Beginning on Feb. 16, movie-goers will
have the rare opportunity to view the
entire corpus of director Frank Capra's
work. "We've been working with the Li
brary of Congress, which houses many
of the negatives of Capra's films," Pack
ard said.
According to Packard's wife Pamela,
who serves with her husband and theater
manager Libby Roberts on the Theater
Foundation's three-member board, the
Packard Foundation has provided the Li
brary of Congress with a generous grant

to pay for the restoration of all of Capra's
work.
"We'll have the best possible prints
made from the existing materials," said
Pamela Packard. "On Christmas Eve we
had the chance to show 'It's a Wonderful
Life/ and it was an incredibly beautiful
print."
The Christmas Eve screening of
Capra's film, followed by "The Wizard
of Oz" on Christmas Day, will become
a tradition at the Stanford Theater, said
David Packard. "Hundreds of people
came to see those films this Christmas,"
he said. "It was wonderful."
The most recent film series to show
at the Stanford, "A Week of Hitchcock
Favorites," will conclude tonight with a
chilling pair. The double feature begins
at 7 p.m. with "Vertigo," starring lames
Stewart and Kim Novack, followed by
"North by Northwest" at 9:25, with Cary
Grant and Eva Marie Saint.
Between shows audiences can enjoy
the lively sounds of a genuine Wurlitzer
theater organ. Although the Stanford
Theater was equipped with a Wurlitzer
organ when it opened in 1925, the con
sole had been removed by the time the
Packard Foundation acquired the building
in 1987.
Today, the original organ grills — in
their regilded rococo splendor — house
the pipes of an organ rebuilt from the
parts of several different instruments
plucked from old movie palaces through
out California.
"The pipes of the new organ came
from all over," stated Packard. "The

clarinet might have come from one
theater, the trumpet from another." Ac
cording to Packard, the console — the
keyboard, pedals and controls that oper
ate the organ's stops — came from
Grauman's Chinese Theater in Holly
wood, where "The Wizard of Oz"
premiered in 1939.
Packard wants audiences to experience
what it was like to view films in the
lavish movie palaces that pre-dated
small-screen theaters and VCRs. In the
expansive auditorium of the Stanford
Theater, movie-goers can enjoy classic
films made from the '20s to the '50s in
a milieu that recreates the sights and
sounds of another era.
The sounds of that era echo sonorously
within the walls of the Stanford Theater.
Like most movie houses built before the
advent of "talkies," the Stanford is not
a showcase for acoustical excellence.
"The auditorium is much more live
than modern theaters," Packard ex
plained. "When sound came into movies
they had to put some kind of sound
absorbing material on the walls to tone
down the reverberations."
According to Packard, by the time the
Stanford Theater Foundation had ob
tained the building, its walls were covered
with a less-than-attractive material. "It
looked pretty bad," he said, "so when we
restored the theater we put up a new

sound-absorbing material more in
keeping with the original artistic design
of die theatre."
Throughout the entire restoration proj
ect, Packard was careful to remain as
faithful as possible to the original
of the artists and architects who contrib
uted to the theater's construction. Ac
cording to Packard, all of the artwork in
the auditorium was restored to its
original state.
Since no photographs of the lobby
could be found, Packard relied upon
original water-color proposals submitted
by the A.T. Heinsbergen Co. when the
theater was first built in 1925. According
to Pamela Packard, artisans from the
Heinsbergen Co., as well as a team of
painters and architects, participated in
the two-year restoration effort.
The total cost of the project reached
$6 million. "Most of that cost came from
all the earthquake work," Packard said.
"We had to tear up the floor and
strengthen the theater." According to
Packard, the building was not damaged
in the Oct. 17 earthquake.
Pamela Packard hopes that the Stanford
Theater will be able to give back to the
master filmmakers of yesterday some of
the beauty and splendor they have given
to generations of viewers. "We're hoping
the theater will generate enough interest
and profits to fund a film preservation
project at a film archive," she said.
In the meantime, the Stanford Theater
is once again welcoming viewers into the
bright gardens of Hollywood's Golden
Age.
