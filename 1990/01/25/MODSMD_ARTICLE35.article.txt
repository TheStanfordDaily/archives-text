# Textbooks need more beef to satisfy today's discriminating students
## 
### 
I think we need to do something to
improve our college textbooks. Let's face
it, most textbooks are about as interesting
as those shows you see on public television
with titles like "Broccoli: An Historical
Perspective." We should ask our Congres
spcople in Washington, D.C. (official
slogan: "Have a crack at Washington") to
pass laws providing large federal tax breaks
for people who write interesting textbooks,
or perhaps to provide them with free
federal housing in the form of deserted
savings and loan buildings.
To start with, I'd beef up all physics
textbooks so that their story problems
were more realistic. Something like:
Problem #1 Her heart pounding like
thunder, the virgin Duchess felt the weight
of Dirk McCroft crushing her passionately
into the silken sheets, and a sigh escaped
her ruhy lips as her forbidden lover pressed
his bearded face to hers and his hot breath
steamed onto her throat. McCroft was a
huge, untamed man, half Greek, half
Cherokee, half Syrian. He had promised
her that the first time between them
would be slow and gentle, and now as
he held her and caressed her face the
Duchess realized that love with him could

be no other way. If McCroft weighs 86
kilograms and the Duchess weighs 52
kilograms, what must be the coefficient
of friction such that, on a bed that reclines
at an angle of 12 degrees, he can press
his body sensually into hers without
sliding off onto the floor!
Next, I'd make history textbooks more
interesting, too, with just a few minor
additions:
The Civil War "The Civil War (1861-65)
was brought about by many social, polit
ical and economic factors .... BUST A
MOVE! It was fougfit between the north
ern United States (the Union) and the
southern United States (the Confederacy)
in many fierce and historical battles ....
YEAH, BUST A MOVE!! The Civil War's
toll on human lives was devastating, a
fact that constantly haunted President
Abraham WILD THING' Lincoln.
(GUITAR SOLO)."
And look how much better your Spanish
textbook would be if it was written with
your enjoyment in mind:
Please translate the following everyday

conversation into English.
L: No quiero ir contigo.
DV: Luke, tiene que ir conmigo. i\b
soy su padre!
L: No, no es posible que Darth Vader
es mi padre. Prefiero morir.
DV: Venga. iEs su destina!
A few other suggested improvements:
(1) Release textbooks on cassette so you
can study while driving or whenever you
have a few spare moments in the day. (2)
Eliminate the bulky prefaces in which
textbook authors thank everybody they
have ever met — textbooks arc not an
Academy Award acccptance specch. (3)
Create pop-up textbooks like the ones we
had during childhood. This would be es
pecially helpful in classes like "Human
Sexuality."
With so many great ideas for improving
our textbooks, you must be asking your
self: "How come textbooks are so boring?"
To answer this question it is necessary
to understand the workings of the Federal
Reserve Board and how it relates to game
management policy in the Dakota Bad
lands with respect to the digestive system
of the Indo-European Water Buffalo. No,
I'm sorry, that's what's necessary to un

derstand how the ASSU organizes their
fee refunds. To understand TEXTBOOKS
you have to be familiar with the publishing
industry.
The publishing industry buys textbooks
from professors, who arc extremely poor
people despite the fact many of them work
for universities that have endowments well
in excess of the price of a "stealth" bomber.
Since professors are poor, they write many
textbooks in order to supplement their
income, and these textbooks are sold to
you, the consumer, for $55. The price of
each book breaks down as follows:
Printing costs: 53.50
Publisher's profit: $4.80
Author's royalties: $2.49
Shipping: $1.09
AM/FM Stereo $4.76

Tax and License: $9.20
Dealer Prep: $29.16
Total: $55.00
So you'd think that at $2.49 each a
professor would want to write a FASCI
NATING book that would sell THOU
SANDS of copies. Here's the catch. The
entire textbook industry, from New York
to Los Angeles, is run by the Yellow High
lighter Pen Mafia.
The highlighter mafia — overseen by
Vmnie "Bic" Lambada — survives on the
sales of their highlighter pens, and they
(the Mafia) know darned well that it's a
lot quicker to skim through a boring book
and highlight the important parts than
read the entire thing cover to cover
Hence, they sell billions of these little
yellow pens thanks to the "cooperation"
they get from textbook authors. There's
hardly a professor alive who has not been
visited by a thug from the yellow high
lighter pen mafia in the middle of the
night. It's not that our professors don't
want to write witty, fascinating textbooks
They're just living in fear.

for people who write interesting textbooks,
or perhaps to provide them with free
federal housing in the form of deserted
savings and loan buildings.
To start with, I'd beef up all physics
textbooks so that their story problems
were more realistic. Something like:
Problem #1 Her heart pounding like
thunder, the virgin Duchess felt the weight
of Dirk McCroft crushing her passionately
into the silken sheets, and a sigh escaped
her ruhy lips as her forbidden lover pressed
his bearded face to hers and his hot breath
steamed onto her throat. McCroft was a
huge, untamed man, half Greek, half
Cherokee, half Syrian. He had promised
her that the first time between them
would be slow and gentle, and now as
he held her and caressed her face the
Duchess realized that love with him could

be no other way. If McCroft weighs 86
kilograms and the Duchess weighs 52
kilograms, what must be the coefficient
of friction such that, on a bed that reclines
at an angle of 12 degrees, he can press
his body sensually into hers without
sliding off onto the floor!
Next, I'd make history textbooks more
interesting, too, with just a few minor
additions:
The Civil War "The Civil War (1861-65)
was brought about by many social, polit
ical and economic factors .... BUST A
MOVE! It was fougfit between the north
ern United States (the Union) and the
southern United States (the Confederacy)
in many fierce and historical battles ....
YEAH, BUST A MOVE!! The Civil War's
toll on human lives was devastating, a
fact that constantly haunted President
Abraham WILD THING' Lincoln.
(GUITAR SOLO)."
And look how much better your Spanish
textbook would be if it was written with
your enjoyment in mind:
Please translate the following everyday

conversation into English.
L: No quiero ir contigo.
DV: Luke, tiene que ir conmigo. i\b
soy su padre!
L: No, no es posible que Darth Vader
es mi padre. Prefiero morir.
DV: Venga. iEs su destina!
A few other suggested improvements:
(1) Release textbooks on cassette so you
can study while driving or whenever you
have a few spare moments in the day. (2)
Eliminate the bulky prefaces in which
textbook authors thank everybody they
have ever met — textbooks arc not an
Academy Award acccptance specch. (3)
Create pop-up textbooks like the ones we
had during childhood. This would be es
pecially helpful in classes like "Human
Sexuality."
With so many great ideas for improving
our textbooks, you must be asking your
self: "How come textbooks are so boring?"
To answer this question it is necessary
to understand the workings of the Federal
Reserve Board and how it relates to game
management policy in the Dakota Bad
lands with respect to the digestive system
of the Indo-European Water Buffalo. No,
I'm sorry, that's what's necessary to un

derstand how the ASSU organizes their
fee refunds. To understand TEXTBOOKS
you have to be familiar with the publishing
industry.
The publishing industry buys textbooks
from professors, who arc extremely poor
people despite the fact many of them work
for universities that have endowments well
in excess of the price of a "stealth" bomber.
Since professors are poor, they write many
textbooks in order to supplement their
income, and these textbooks are sold to
you, the consumer, for $55. The price of
each book breaks down as follows:
Printing costs: 53.50
Publisher's profit: $4.80
Author's royalties: $2.49
Shipping: $1.09
AM/FM Stereo $4.76

Tax and License: $9.20
Dealer Prep: $29.16
Total: $55.00
So you'd think that at $2.49 each a
professor would want to write a FASCI
NATING book that would sell THOU
SANDS of copies. Here's the catch. The
entire textbook industry, from New York
to Los Angeles, is run by the Yellow High
lighter Pen Mafia.
The highlighter mafia — overseen by
Vmnie "Bic" Lambada — survives on the
sales of their highlighter pens, and they
(the Mafia) know darned well that it's a
lot quicker to skim through a boring book
and highlight the important parts than
read the entire thing cover to cover
Hence, they sell billions of these little
yellow pens thanks to the "cooperation"
they get from textbook authors. There's
hardly a professor alive who has not been
visited by a thug from the yellow high
lighter pen mafia in the middle of the
night. It's not that our professors don't
want to write witty, fascinating textbooks
They're just living in fear.

I think we need to do something to
improve our college textbooks. Let's face
it, most textbooks are about as interesting
as those shows you see on public television
with titles like "Broccoli: An Historical
Perspective." We should ask our Congres
spcople in Washington, D.C. (official
slogan: "Have a crack at Washington") to
pass laws providing large federal tax breaks
for people who write interesting textbooks,
or perhaps to provide them with free
federal housing in the form of deserted
savings and loan buildings.

textbooks so that their story problems
