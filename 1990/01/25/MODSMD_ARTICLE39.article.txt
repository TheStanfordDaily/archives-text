# Band provides cool entertainment, year-round

"Wait, guys, stop. We have to
talk now." The Ice Weasels re
luctantly put down their instru
ments. They say they've been
together since Oct. 1988 â€” and
this is probably the only straight
answer I got when I interviewed
them.
I asked the group how they
came up with their name.
"Chris, say something funny,"
percussionist Dave Gomez
yawned.
"I've got a head-cold," Chris
Martin, a bass player, answered.
"We're not going to tell you,"
Stanford graduate Tom Bailey
grins.
For some reason I thought this
was going to be easier.
Bailey can be described as the
band's ringleader. "I killed a lion
with my bare hands six weeks
ago," he grunted. In addition to
big game hunting, Bailey enjoys
guitar and handles some vocals
for the Weasels.
Percussionist Matt Grimshaw,
or "Grimcheez" to the Weasels,
is the connection that brought the
band together. Grimshaw ex
plained, "Yeah, I knew all of
them."
Martin, an anthropology major,
admits the Ice Weasels "Don't let
[him]sing."
Dave Gomez is a percussionist
turned lead vocalist. He earned
his master's in education at Stan
ford and is now known as "Mr.
Gomez" to his high school stu-

dents. Outside of the classroom
Gomez is known for other talents
including "strange bodily gyra
tions."
To the best of my knowledge,
I have no relatives named Buck,"
guitarist Doug Dorst reflects.
The newest Weasel, junior
Charity Kahn, adds her talents
on keyboard and vocals.
But what kind of music do Ice
Weasels make? After some dis
cussion among the members, the
band settles on "chronic steel
tipped classic rock with a hard
edge." According to Martin, how
ever, chronic may be too strong
a word. "It's more of a nagging
pain," he explains.
This is not a Euro-synth-pop
kind of band. The Weasels per
form covers of Hendrix, Led Zep
pelin, Clapton and The Grateful
Dead. Their play list also includes
classic rock from The Rolling
Stones and Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Though much of the music
does not typically have a dance
label "It's not only listenable, it's
danceable," says Dorst.
The image the band has estab
lished is not one that is particu
larly clean-cut. I had to remind

them more than once I needed
some quotes that could be put in
print.
Practices with the Weasels are
not just for fun, however. Though
they joked about the lack of struc
ture of their practice time, the

musicians did get serious. While
learning a new song Bailey
stopped the group several times
yelling "I said six beats."
The Ice Weasels are together
both to have a good time and to
play the kind of music they like.

"We're also great guys to party
with," notes Bailey.
"With whom to party," corrects
Dorst.
Leave it to the bad boys of
campus rock 'n' roll to avoid end
ing a sentence with a preposition.
