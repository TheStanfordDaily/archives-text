# Chinese students hope Senate lets them stay
## Vote could ensure protection of those in U.S. 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer With AP wire reports 
With the House of Representatives firmly
on their side, Chinese students at Stanford
face another long day of waiting for the
Senate vote to override President Bush's
veto of a bill to protect Chinese students
in the United States.
Yesterday, in its first substantive vote
this year, the House voted 390-25 to over
ride Bush's veto of the Pelosi bill that
would lift the home country return require
ment for Chinese students on J-l visas.
The Senate vote is scheduled for this
morning, following a flurry of last-minute
lobbying as both sides try to tip the narrow
balance in their favor. The vote is expected
to be very close.
There are almost 400 Chinese nationals
at Stanford, and 90 percent hold J-l visas
which require the bearer to return to China
following graduation. The bill to lift this
requirement, sponsored by Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., was passed unanimously
last November.
Citing the need to maintain "flexibility"
in his foreign policy, Bush vetoed the Pelosi
bill shortly after its passage.
Wang Weijia, a graduate student in elec
trical engineering, spent all day yesterday
watching television coverage of Congress
and waiting for the vote. He said he was
"very encouraged and moved by the Amer
ican people's support."
"We hope this landslide vote will affect
the Senate," Wang said.

stiff opposition from the White House. The
president has been actively lobbying Re
publican senators this week. He needs 34
senators to defeat the override attempt.
Chinese students say they are confident
of the support of at least eight Republicans,
in addition to the 55 Democrats in the
Senate, leaving them four votes short of
the two-thirds majority needed to override
the president's decision.
A press officer for Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif., said Wilson will support the over
ride. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., will also
support the override, according to Chinese
students here.
Xu Guanghan, an electrical engineering
graduate student who has been active in
lobbying efforts, said that he is "not too
confident" about the upcoming Senate vote.
The White House has been pulling out
all the stops in an attempt to prevent an
override. Bush held a breakfast conference
for Republican senators and has been con
tacting them individually by phone over
the past two days. Secretary of State James
Baker attended Wednesday's GOP Senate
luncheon to urge support of the
president's position.
At the White House breakfast,
Bush hit hard on his contention
that a veto override would mean
a total cutoff of the flow of stu
dents to the United States. Bush
also pointed to changes within
China such as lifting of martial
law in Beijing, which he said jus
tified his policy toward China.
But critics disagreed. Rep. Step
hen Solarz, D-N.Y., said, "On the
issue of China, the president has
lost his credibility." Solarz is the

chair of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee.
Saying that he sees no change
in Chinese policy toward dissi
dents, Rep. William Broomfield,
R-Mich., added that letting the
veto stand "would be obviously
sending the wrong signal to the
rest of the world about what took
place just a few months ago."
The independent Chinese stu
dent union, which has been
leading lobbying efforts, sent out
an emergency report yesterday on
the national electronic mail net
work, China Net, calling the situ
ation "critical" and asking
students to lobby undecided Re
publicans.
