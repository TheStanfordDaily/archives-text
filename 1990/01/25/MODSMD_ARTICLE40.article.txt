# 'Labour' outweighs 'love'
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
Anyone who has followed ÜB4O
knows that their album "Labour
of Love" was more than just the
1988 commercial hit, "Red Red
Wine."
"Labour of Love" — released
eons before "Red Red Wine" be
came Top-40 fodder — was actu
ally an eclectic collection of classic
songs from the "golden age" of
reggae, reinterpreted by ÜB4O.
With the recent release of "Labour
of Love II," ÜB4O returns to the
music scene.
However, there's more un
originality than just the title. Once
again, the album consists of 10
vintage reggae songs, re-recorded
by ÜB4O.
According to the liner notes,
ÜB4o's favorite classic reggae
tracks "could have made four al
bums at least." Yet, after listening
to "Labour of Love II," one wonders
how long it took the band to
scrounge together half an album's
worth of songs.
This time, their proven formula
only works for the first five tracks.
And although listening to the first
side of this album could spark a
"love" for ÜB4O, listening to the
second side is more like hard
"labour."
One should be wary when all
four of the album's advertised
songs lie on the first side.
"Labour of Love II" starts out
quickly, with A 1 Green's "Here I
Am (Come and Take Me)." The
upbeat tempo and powerful bridge
spark the song's pace, and Ali
Campbell's lead vocals reveal a
slight dash of vulnerability. Like
"Red Red Wine," "Here I Am" dis
plays both reggae and commercial
potential.
A lack of vocal clarity often
detracts from the full effect of the
song. In"The Way You Do The
Things You Do," the song cli
maxes until the chorus. When the
instruments momentarily stop,
however, Campbell just mumbles
the title through his teeth. In
"Kingston Town," however, sharp,
clean words paint an extremely
vivid picture of a mysterious, ro
mantic town at night.
Throughout the first side, the
quick tempos and various instru
ments help overcome the muffled
vocals. Although bass lines and
melodies are often simple and pre
dictable, the tracks are catchy, fun
and very danceable. The atmos
phere is captured in the lyrics of
"Groovin'." "I'm just groovin' /
Can't stop groovin' / Groovin' 'til
I die."
Unfortunately, all of the mo
mentum of the first side is lost by
the dull, inferior second side. In
"Baby," bassist-turned-guest
vocalist Earl Falconer compounds
an annoying staccato drum beat
with a thin, wispy and over-

reverberating voice.
"Wedding Day" proves
monotonous, and the uneven me
ter of "Wear You To The Ball"
sounds more like a poorly-rhymed
rap song.
"Homely Girl" stands out for its
unorthodox topic,- an early dis
covery of inner beauty foreshadows
a girl's development into a gor
geous adult. "It must have broke
your poor little heart / When the
boys used to say / Tou look better
in the dark.'"
However, this track's novelty is
lost by the unoriginal theme of the
"Impossible Love" — unrequited
love resulting in introspective self
pity. Like the rest of the second
side, this track drags on endlessly.
It is difficult to determine
whether ÜB4O is at fault for the
vapid second side of "Labour of
Love II." After all, it isn't really
their own material. Still, any fan
of ÜB4O or of reggae music
deserves much more than five good
songs.
Regrettably, the weakness of this
album as a whole will ultimately
hamper the exposure potential of
the first five tracks. It's just too
bad that you can't buy only half
of an album.
