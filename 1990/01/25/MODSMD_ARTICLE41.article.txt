# Colorful dining written all over Fresco's walls

### Paula Gani Staff writer 
If you're looking for a place to
savor a good meal while enjoying
the company and conversation of
your dining partners, Fresco is the
place to go.
Owner Chris Oswald described
his restaurant simply as "casual,"
but my date targeted the atmos
phere as "comfortably noisy." With
its two dining rooms, full bar and
lunch counter, Fresco is undeni
ably spacious. But the dimmed
lights and the simple elegance of
the decor allow you to experience
an island of privacy within a
friendly crowd.
Fresco fits into the category of
California cuisine. The full-course
menu varies from Southwestern to
Italian and satisfies both the meat
eater and vegetarian. To get the
most out of your dining adventure,
I suggest you order the out-of-the
ordinary items.
We began with the Blue Corn
Crepe Quesadillas, which are
scrumptious crepes filled with goat
cheese and scallions. There prob
ably aren't many places in the
country that serve this dish, and
it whets your appetite for the
pleasures yet to come.
Fresco's popular Cream of
Roasted Red Pepper Soup sells by
the gallon each night, and under
standably so. Don't let the thought
of pepper soup scare you away —
it's actually very subtle and

creamy.
Any entree you order will be aes
thetically as well as gastronomi
cally pleasing. Fresh yellow and
green vegetables complemented
the stuffed chicken breast I or
dered. There was obviously a great
deal of time put into making the
spinach-basil cream sauce look as
good as it tasted.
After allowing your dinner to
digest, be sure and ask for the
special chocolate mousse pie, a tra
dition that has been with Fresco
since its 1983 opening. A pecan
crust surrounds a fluffy chocolate
mousse, cinnamon and meringue
pie.
Fresco's service is an outstand
ing plus. Our waiter, Vic, was truly
helpful and knew the menu well.
And unlike smaller restaurants,
where you're rushed in and out of
your table, Fresco's serving staff
allows you plenty of time to savor
your food in between courses and
actually enjoy the company of your
dining partners.
Fresco's aura is a bit more ma
ture than a bar-and-grill-type res
taurant. A complete meal will run
from $10 to $20, a little high for
a typical student's budget. But the
restaurant is perfect for business
conversation, and a good place to
take mom and dad when they're
in town.

Fresco is located at 3398 El
Camino Real in Palo Alto. Call
493-3970 for reservations.
