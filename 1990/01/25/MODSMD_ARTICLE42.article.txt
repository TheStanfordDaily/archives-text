# Bite into something exotic
## New caf√© caters to students 
### Elizabeth Laurence Staff writer 
You can't blame University Avenue res
taurants for turning a deaf ear to the growls
of hungry stomachs at this end of Palm
Drive. The yuppies downtown keep regular
hours and full wallets. We don't.
Still, Nick Frost, co-owner of the new
Mango Cafe on University, is on to some
thing. "If you're hungry at 11 o' clock at
night and you're taking a study break, you
have a choice between Domino's and Jack
in the Box," Frost observed.
A recent Stanford graduate himself, Frost
has come up with an alternative to that
too-familiar cuisine in the form of the
Mango Cafe, which features, as Frost puts
it, "exotic things at prices that aren't going
to make you get another [Guaranteed Stu
dent Loan J."
Besides being the only Caribbean restau
rant in Palo Alto, the Mango Cafe is open
until midnight seven days a week, and it's
an easy bike ride from campus. That should
help quiet the late-night roar of Stanford
stomachs.
Awareness of the needs of students is not
all that separates the cafe from other local

restaurants. Because the kitchen is small,
the menu mostly lists cold dishes like pat6s
and sausages, in addition to a huge selection
of non-alcoholic tropical drinks. Caribbean
art and reggae music manage to transform
the narrow room into a comfortable shelter
from northern cares.
Food at the Mango Cafe is delicious and
tastes more exotic than you would expect.
Pat 6 may sound standard, but cognac and
pepper seasoning add amazing zip. Satisfy
ing, surprising taste trickles all the way
down to the tropical soft drinks, of which
the cafe sells seven varieties. They are
lighter, fruitier and less sweet than con
tinental colas. If you're still thirsty, try a
Mango Hurricane, practically a fish bowl of
fresh tropical juices and cut fruit.
The Mango Cafe is especially impressive
considering that Frost, who majored in eco
nomics and industrial engineering, has never
worked in a restaurant. He didn't even hash.
As a student, Frost envisioned himself work
ing in a high-tech field after graduation. "I
had no idea I was going to do this," he said.
We're lucky that he did

The Mango Cafd is located at 483 University
Ave. in Palo Alto.
