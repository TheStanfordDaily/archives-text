# 'Music Box' holds painful truth
## 
### Andrea Parkes Staff writer 
The title of this movie may con
jure up visions of tinkly music and
toy ballerinas, but from the first
moments of "Music Box," such
tender thoughts will compete with
the grindings of the mechanical

cogs underneath in this statement
about the human capacity for love
and cruelty.
Disturbing and provocative, the
juxtaposition of the devotion
among father, daughter and
grandson and the supposed in
humanity of the eldest, is the

driving force behind this film. Part
mystery, part courtroom drama
and, above all, an exploration of
human relationships, "Music Box"
casts Jessica Lange as Ann Talbot,
a divorced criminal attorney with
a 11-year-old son Mikey (Lucas
Haas) and a huge dilemma.
Could her father, a Hungarian
immigrant and Chicago blue-collar
worker, actually have committed
the grotesque war crimes he is ac
cused of almost 50 years later?
And will she have the legal skill
and inner strength to acquit him?
From the beginning, it is difficult
to picture Michael Laszlo (Armin
Mueller-Stahl), as anything but a
devoted father, raising Ann and
her somewhat simple-minded but
loveable brother Karchy (Michael
Rooker) after the early death of
their mother. Laszlo is also a
doting grandfather and committed
anti-communist. In short, he's a
truly loyal American.
He simply does not appear ca
pable of being the "monster" who
tortured children and turned the
Danube River of his native
Budapest red with the blood of in
nocents, and then forged docu
ments in order to escape to the
United States after the war, drop
ping out of sight for half a century.
Can a person be capable of such
a double-sided nature? Can such
a person be a good father?
In the court room testimony of
the survivors, tension is brilliantly
created and intensified through vis
ually compelling scenes that drop
clues about the nature of the man
"Mishka," a member of the Hun
garian branch of the Nazi Special
Service. These scenes contrast with
the Michael Laszlo who does push
ups with his grandson and even
occasionally sneaks out to spend
the night with the local bakery
woman.
The war of Ann's emotions leads
her to Budapest where she tries to
find out the truth about her father.
Ann is forced to make difficult
choices as she finds out more
about the past.
