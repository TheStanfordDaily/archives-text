# 'Left Foot' right on target
## Film proves disability doesn't mean handicap 
### Melissa Dagodag 
"My Left Foot" is a film about the true
story of a painter, Christy Brown, who was
born with cerebral palsy that only leaves
him able to control his left foot.
Although the plot revolves around Christy
(played quite convincingly by Daniel Day-
Lewis of "My Beautiful Laundrctte," "Room
With A View" and"The Unbearable Light
ness of Being"), the film leaves the primary
impression of a working-class Irish family
struggling to remain united in the face of
adversity.
The most powerful force in the family is
the mother, endearingly played by Brcnda
Fricke.
Mrs. Brown speaks to Christy, believing
that he can understand, even though every
one else treats him like an idiot. It is her
kind and devoted treatment of Christy that

inspires him to scrawl his first written word,
"MOTHER," on the floor with a piece of
chalk wedged between his toes.
The film's most touching moments dis
play polarized emotions. When Christy traps
a ball between his head and the ground,
preventing a potential goal, and the opposing
player keeps kicking the ball unsucessfully
at his head, the audience responds simul
taneously with pride and pity for Christy.
"My Left Foot" avoids sentimentality typ
ical to stories about the disabled. Christy's
life is not defined by his losses; rather, he
charges ahead as any fully-functioning man
might do.
"My Left Foot" is fresh and humorous.
The film refuses to treat disability with the
traditional, tear-jerking sentimentality. This
treatment docs justice to its viewers by not
telling them with tears and violins when to
feel happy or sad.
