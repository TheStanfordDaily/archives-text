# Sex drives crooked cop under
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
To those who know him, Sgt.
Dennis Peck is a family man —
well-liked and well-respected. Yet,
sex is this cop's vice.
Married to his third wife, Peck
has eight children with another on
the way, and a mistress — who
is also his partner's wife. He sup
ports his libido with money passed
under the table by a handful of
society's moral low-riders. And he
keeps himself safe from the high
riders by infecting their minds with
devastating imagery where sex is
the primary weapon.
Though "Internal Affairs" has its
share of violence and action, the
real source of intensity is the psy

chological combat Peck (Richard
Gere) wages with internal affairs
Sgt. Raymond Avila (Andy Garcia),
who is investigating Peck and his
partner for corruption.
The virus Peck plants in Avila's
mind — images of Peck and Avila's
wife having sex — nearly brings
about Avila's downfall. In his first
outburst, for example, Avila ex
plodes and attacks Peck. Later, he
even slaps his wife in public.
As the mental brinksmanship
continues, Peck drives Avila to the
point of having hallucinations of
his wife and Peck having sex.
Climaxing with a final deadly
confrontation between Peck, Avila
and Avila's wife, the final scene of
the film embodies its flaws and
strengths. It is stylish and intense,

yet ultimately predictable. Director
Mike Figgis gives the film a moody
look that is not as blatant as a
Ridley Scott film but more distinc
tive than most cop thrillers.
However, he does not quite sal
vage Henry Bean's average script.
Richard Gere turns in the best
performance that I have seen him
give. His creation of a complex,
demonic cop is unquestionably the
film's strong point. As an intense,
somewhat self-righteous Sgt. Avila,
Andy Garcia finally gives himself
a darker edge that is definitely a
plus.
For many people, "Internal Af
fairs' " good cop vs. bad cop prem
ise may be trite, but, if you can
accept a little predictability, this
version of it is not too bad.
