# 'Henry V' shakes spear at mediocrity
## 
### David Chang Staff writer 
To be honest, or not to be honest
... no, just kidding. To be honest, I
couldn't understand at least a fifth of
"Henry V," the highly acclaimed new
film version of Shakespeare's historical
play.
Shakespeare-watching is a difficult
thing, you know. It helps to have an
affinity for iambic pentameter, period
costumes, dramatic dynamics and
British accents. If you don't, you won't
catch everything — which can be frus
trating.
But that is no reason to avoid "Henry
V." Thanks to the emotional potential
of the original material, and to the
efforts of Kenneth Branagh, who di
rected it, adapted it and starred in it,
the film delivers all the force you'd
expect from Shakespeare.

The plot focuses on the young king,
who rashly commits to a war with
France. Travel-weary and outnum
bered, the English move across France
toward a final, bloody conflict with
their well-rested enemies. Along the
way, Henr comes to understand a
king's duties and dilemmas as well as
the consequences of his original deci
sion.
Branagh really shines when his part
calls for intensity. At the siege of the
French city of Harfleur, he is pure
vitriol, demanding that the town gover
nor yield to prevent further loss of life.
Although what he asks is humane, his
words threaten reckless pillage and his
voice resonates with the madness of
battle.
Later, as the exhausted, hungry Eng
lish troops wind through the country
side, Henry is put to the test again.
He has ordered the men to leave the

French citizens untouched to prevent
unnecessary killing. Bardolph, one of
his old drinking buddies, is caught pil
laging in violation of the order. To set
an example of mercy toward his
enemies, Henry is forced to hang his
friend.
However, I found the pre-battle
scenes the most absorbing. They are
the times when his confidence is at
its weakest and when his leadership is
crucial.
On the night before the final con
frontation, Henry walks around the
camp, his face concealed by the cowl
of a cloak, and discusses the coming
battle with some of his disheartened
men around the campfire. At the edges
of the camp, sleeping soldiers lie on
the ground, eerie precursors of the next
day's carnage.
When the conversation is over,
Henry is alone and painfully aware
of his responsibility for his men
and the war. Illuminated by a pale,
unearthly light, he kneels and
prays for grace and the courage of
his men. Branagh plays it with
such fervor that the campground
becomes his own Gethsemane.
Just before the battle, Branagh
delivers his "We happy few" speech
to his men. It's simply beautiful.
With mingled fury and joy, he
creates a fraternity of patriots out
of his ragged troops, his voice rang
ing from a whisper to a roar.
Sometimes the film seems to be
mixing conflicting elements —
Henry's drinking buddies seem like
Laurels and Hardys, milling about
on the battlefield — but in the
final tally, "Henry V" is fully worth
watching.
And to think that Branagh is
only 28 years old. He's received a
great deal of praise, and he's been
called "the new Olivier." Well,
whatever he is, I'm glad he has
such talent, and after being bowled
over by his pre-battle monologues,
I'm looking forward to seeing him
in a tragedy.
