# 'Tremors' won't shake you up
## Sci-fi flick with Family Ties dad measures low on Richter Scale 
### Greg Douglas 
There was an earthquake a cou
ple of days ago, around ten o'clock
at night.
It seems that most of the
campus missed this event. I, how
ever, was finely attuned to the
slight movement of the earth. And
when I felt this mild shake, my
adrenaline started pumping. I
stood perfectly still, careful not to
emit any sound or joggle the floor
beneath me in any way, for fear
that the dusty, snake-like tentacle
of one of the voracious creatures
from the movie "Tremors" would
reach out for my leg.
Then I paused and thought to
myself, "You know, that movie
was really bad!"
And so it was. "Tremors" is a
pseudo-spoof-horror-comedy-love
story ensemble that doesn't pan

out effectively in any of these di
rections. A cross between "Dune,"
"The Dukes of Hazzard" and"The
Wilderness Family," "Tremors" is
only mildly entertaining.
The comedy is predictable, the
story line is predictable, the char
acters are predictable. Basically, if
they knew about these beasties
who burrow through the desert
sand, anyone could tell you what
happens — so I'll spare you the
burden of reading it.
The special effects are OK, but
the shots rely too heavily on close
ups of different configurations of
sheep and cow guts to show what
happens to unfortunate humans
and befuddled sand worms. •
In regard to the acting, the only
reason I would recommend that
anyone see this movie is for the
amusing portrayal by Michael
Gross, the liberal, fatherly figure

most of us grew up with on the
show "Family Ties," of a hard-core,
commie-hating, multiple gun
toting survivalist.
As Val and Earl, however, Kevin
Bacon and Richard Ward deliver
unimpressive, stereotypical
portrayals of two run-of-the-mill
local yokels. Perhaps this does
break new ground for Bacon, how
ever, for he shifts from that city
slick cool guy who danced his
socks off in "Footloose" to a farm
handyman trying to make it from
a town of 14 to Bixby, a town of
triple that number.
All things considered, "Tremors"
is definitely not worth the full
movie rate. If you're in the mood
for a " 'Dune' comes to Mayberry"
kind of entertainment you might
go see the matinee, but even that's
a stretch of my recommending
abilities.
