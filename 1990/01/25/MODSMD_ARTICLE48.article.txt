# 'Iceberg' sinks Ice-T

### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
"Freedom of Speech . . . Just
Watch What You Say."
That's the ironic theme played
out in Los Angeles rapper Ice-T's
third album, his revenge for the
bad rap he's received by those who
claim his music glamorizes drugs
and violence, d la gang-rappers
Eazy-E and NWA. Previous rhymes
like "I'm Your Pusher," actually a
song about using music instead of
drugs, have caused some to include
him in the category.
And despite the misplaced
criticism of Ice-T's lyrics, his
abusive objectification of women
that pervades new songs like
"Iceberg" make him difficult to
defend.
The criticism that Ice promotes
drugs and street violence is well
off target; careful dissection of his
lyrics reveal an anti-drug and anti
violence message guised in termi
nology well understood by L.A.
gangs.
In "This One's For Me," Ice
clears out the closet and the ter
minology and talks straight to
those in the black community in
volved with drugs and violence.
"We're just killing ourselves while

the others laugh / Look at the street
it's a cocaine blood bath / We gotta
realize dope is pure death / Mess
with drugs you're breathing your
last breath / Selling drugs is
straight up genocide / They're
gonna laugh while we all die."
But most of Ice's social com
mentary remains twisted in a
cleverly ironic phraseology that
shows most clearly in "Shut Up,
Be Happy," a Big Brother-type an
nouncement that the U.S. is under
martial law: "Anyone caught out
side the gates of their subdivisioned
sectors after curfew will be shot.
Remain calm. Do not panic
The number one enemy of progress
is questions. National security is
more important than individual
will. ... Be happy. At last every
thing is done for you."
As long as Ice stays on that
track, his strengths show through
and his music can be put in a
class with Public Enemy. As the
far-from-modest rapper puts it,
"My lethal weapon's my mind."
Granted, Ice-T is no Whodini,
as his own self-designed "X-rated"
sticker on the compact disc warns.
But when he strays down the path
of extreme and sometimes violent
objectification of women, he kisses
away some of his defense forces.
