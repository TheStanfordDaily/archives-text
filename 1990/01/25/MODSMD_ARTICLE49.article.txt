# New Dylan album: not just for the Byrds
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
Lyrics are finally back in fashion.
Although bands that dominated
the '80s had the right look or the
hip sound, they lacked substance.
Who cared if Madonna wasn't a
poet — she sure was sexy.
Then there was Bono. Although
some claim he went overboard at
times, the principle songwriter for
U2 brought socially conscious
lyrics back into the forefront of
music. Artists like Sting, Peter
Gabriel and Tracy Chapman
quickly followed, each one meeting
with equal success. For all their
originality, these talented writers,
along with other greats like Elvis
Costello and Lou Reed, point their
finger at Bob Dylan as being the
man that influenced them.
While Dylan is revered both crit
ically and commercially, many still
reject him for his voice or his style
of music. His pearls of wisdom go
unheard because certain people
don't like the sound of his voice.
Others don't ever listen to his
heart-wrenching tales because they
don't go for that "folk" sound.
Well the problem has been
remedied in some ways. Certain
Dylan tunes have always found
their way into the popular main
stream via remakes by other art
ists. But aside from the '60s Byrds

album, "Byrds Play Dylan," there
has never been a compilation al
bum featuring the brilliant lyrics
of Dylan as performed by others.
While the Byrds album ran the
risk of turning off listeners who
didn't go for their style, the re
cently released "Songs of Dylan —
As Performed by Fifteen Great Art
ists" offers enough variety to ap
peal to the most eclectic listener.
Most of the recordings are by
well-known performers, ranging
from Billy Joel to Eric Clapton, but
the best performance is turned in
by unknown Graham Bennet. His
emotional rendition of the 1966
"It's All Over Now Baby Blue" is
bound to conjure up a few con
verts. Bennet brings alive the lyrics
that reflect the way we have all
felt during those times of depres
sion and abandonment.
In a close second for the best
interpretation are The Band's ver
sions of "When I Paint My Mas
terpiece" and"I Shall Be Released."
The Band earned the right have
multiple songs on the rccord be
cause their 1975 performances as
a backing band marked Dylan's
major comeback.
Each of the 15 artists, from
Siouxie and the Banshees to Rod
Stewart recognizes Dylan's genius.
Both Dylan fans and those who
have rejected him in the pist now
have a perfect way to appreciate
him.
