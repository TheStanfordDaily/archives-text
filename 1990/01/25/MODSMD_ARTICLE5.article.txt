# Proposed changes questioned
## Ban on dorms buying alcohol draws fire 
### Holly Hacker 
During an hour-and-a-half
debate yesterday about the re
cently proposed University al
cohol policy changes, student
leaders strongly objected to the
plan that would prohibit the
purchase of alcohol with dor
mitory funds.
At the first meeting of the
Alcohol Policy Task Force,
sponsored by the Council of
Presidents, several house
officers and resident assistants
argued that such a change
would force students who nor
mally drink at dorm parties to
drink in a private, unmonitored
atmosphere.
Last week Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, Athletic
Director Andy Geiger and Di
rector of Public Safety Marvin
Herrington recommended four
revisions to the current alcohol
policy.
The changes, if approved by
University President Donald
Kennedy, would forbid the pur
chase of alcohol with Univer
sity-collected funds, the con
sumption of alcoholic beverages
at Stanford athletic facilities
and events, and the advertising
of alcohol at athletic events. In
addition, students convicted of
driving while intoxicated would
be unable to park on campus
for one year.
At yesterday's meeting,
Lyons and Geiger joined Stan
ford Police Capt. Marvin Moore
to outline the policy changes
and answer questions from rep
resentatives of various student
groups. Students included res
ident assistants, house officers,
ASSU dorm representatives,
ASSU senators, members of
Risk Reduction of Intoxicants
in the Stanford Community
and members of the Interfra
ternity and Intersorority Coun
cils.
IFC President Todd Ortega,
an RA at Cedro House, voiced
the prevailing opinion of the
25 students at the meeting. "At
a dorm party, students are sur
rounded by RAs, sober
monitors and friends who know

their level of drinking experi
ence," he said.
The policy change would
result in excessive drinking
"behind closed doors, and that
can only increase the problem
tremendously," Ortega added.
Granada House president
Chris Patil echoed these senti
ments. "This policy change
would cause more problems
than it would solve," he said.
In addition, "preventing the
use of dorm funds to purchase
alcohol would burn the frats as
the principle providers," he
added.
By going to fraternity parties
to drink, students are "more
likely to drive and cause
damage to other people's prop
erty," all in a more loosely reg
ulated environment, Patil said.
"The focus will be on alcohol
â€” people will go to parties to
drink," he said.
Ortega voiced concern that
the policy could create more
problems than the fraternities
can handle. "The Greek system
already sponsors a fairly large
percentage of the social life,"
he explained. Without alcohol
available at dorm parties, fra
ternities would see an influx
of "inexperienced drinkers,"
primarily freshmen, Ortega
said.
Ortega also forsees the prob
lem of students rushing frater
nities primarily because of the
availability of alcohol there.
"We don't want a pledge class
filled with people with potential
alcohol problems," he said.
Suggestions from students
included setting a ceiling limit
on the amount of dorm money
used to purchase alcohol and
more educating students about
safe drinking practices. "We
need a stronger emphasis on
education instead of the slap
ping of hands," said ASSU
Senator David Rimer.
While Moore agreed that ed
ucation programs have "had a
tremendous effect on educating
students on alcohol," he said
problems remain. The police
