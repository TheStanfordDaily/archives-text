# Perry says Stealth will fly high
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial Staff 
At the beginning of the Carter
administration, William Perry
launched the United States on an
intensive and expensive program
to develop Stealth technology, a
method of cloaking aircraft, mis
siles and submarines from radar.
Since that time, when Perry
was undersecretary for research
and engineering in the Depart
ment of Defense, the Stealth pro
gram has taken an intense beating
in the media. The highlight of the
program, the B-2 bomber, has
been heavily berated for its high
price tag. Critics say the bomber
gives little bang for the buck.
Now in his position as co
director of Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms
Control, Perry still regards
Stealth technology as one of the
most important aspects of defense
strategy. "I believe that and still
believe that Stealth technology is
the most important thing that has
come along in the last few
decades."
But Perry urged that it would
be an expensive mistake to deploy
the number of Stealth bombers
the Reagan administration had
originally proposed.
Early in the Reagan adminis
tration, the Defense Department
embarked on a program to build
the B-l bomber, one that serves
the same purpose as the B-2
bomber but without the Stealth
technology. Perry said the B-l pro
gram is unnecessary along with

the B-2 bomber.
"I thought it was a mistake to
fight for the B-l and the B-2,"
Perry said. "The mistake, I think,
was starting both programs."
Now that the B-l bombers are
built, "I see no basis for building
an entire fleet of them," he said.
Instead, Perry recommends
trimming the current Bush ad
ministration plan to only 25 or
50 B-2 bombers instead of the
proposed 132-bomber fleet.
Perry argued that the B-2 is a
necessary component of the nu
clear Triad, the three-pronged at
tack force made up of missiles,
submarines and bombers.
Deterrence, the notion that the
Soviet Union will not attack if
the United States can retaliate

with a potent nuclear force, is seen
as being dependent upon a strong
bomber force because of its rela
tive invulnerability from a Soviet
first-strike attack.
The American strategic bomber
force consists of about 300 up
dated B-52s and B-1B aircraft.
While the actual number of bomb
ers has decreased from a high of
1,620 planes in 1957, the number
of deliverable warheads in the
bomber force over that time has
more than doubled to over 5,000
weapons.
The bomber leg of the Triad is
considered by experts to be vital
because bombers, including the B
2, are too slow and cumbersome
to be considered for a nuclear
first-strike against the Soviet Un
ion. First-strike weapons can be
destabilizing, encouraging both
sides to "use them or lose them,"
but second-strike weapons can be
a deterrent to a first-strike.
The B-2 bomber's many critics
said the bomber will cost more
than $500 million each, and the
total cost of the a fleet will be
about $80 billion. That, they said,
is far more than the cost of the
B-l program.
But Perry claimed there was
"deliberate confusion" about the
cost of B-2 program.
Critics have included the re
search necessary to develop
Stealth technology in the cost of
the B-2 bomber, he said. The exact
amount of research on Stealth
technology is still classified, but
he said the cost is "much more
than $10 billion."
