## Bush supports Gorbachev 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Bush expressed hope yester
day that Mikhail S. Gorbachev
"not only survives but stays
strong" in the face of "enormous"
problems. He declined comment
on whether the Soviet leader has
gone too far in trying to quell
civil strife in Azerbaijan.
"Anytime you have a use of
force and the loss of life, we are
concerned. But I don't believe I
can judge that question right
now," said Bush of the Soviet
crackdown on rioting in the
largely Moslem Soviet republic.
The president, at a news con
ference, also announced support
for elevating the Environmental
Protection Agency to the Cabinet,
castigated a "sleight-of-hand"
plan to cut Social Security taxes
and mounted a last-ditch effort to
prevent an override of his veto of
a bill protecting Chinese students
from deportation.
Bush also presided at a full
dress military welcome for the
president of North Yemen, Ali Ab
dullah Saleh, who was returning
for a state dinner last night.
With the strife in Azerbaijan
and demands for independence
from the Baltic states of Lit
huania, Latvia and Estonia, Bush
said Gorbachev is "faced with an
ethnic problem here and an in
ternal problem of enormous di
mensions."

Bush said he "can't make pre
dictions" about Gorbachev's
chances of surviving the challeng
es, but added:
"I hope he not only survives
but stays strong. Because I think
it is in our interest that
perestroika succeed and go for
ward."
On other topics, Bush:
• Called Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan's idea of a rollback in
the Sociai Security tax "a disguise
for increased taxes around the
corner." He called it "odd that a
Republican president ... is the one
that is protecting the sanctity of
the Social Security benefits."
But Bush also said a proposal
by conservative House Republi
cans to allow workers to shift part
of their payroll taxes into private
retirement accounts "has some in
teresting ingredients" and is
worthy of study.
• Said he "can't confirm"
reports of deep division within the
Bush family on abortion, denying
a magazine account that disagree
ment surfaced at a family meeting
but stopping short of saying there
is no such division.
• Offered a polite no-thank
you to Czechoslovakia President
Vaclav Havel's offer to have the
next Bush-Gorbachev summit in
Prague instead of the United
States.
