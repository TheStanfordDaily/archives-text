MEASLES
For the first 26 weeks of 1989, there was an
increase in the number of cases of
measles in the U.S. of 380% compared to
the 1988 total for the same penod. 70
colleges and universities have reported
cases of measles already this year. The
Immunization Committee of ACHA
(Amencan College Health Association)
recently recommended that all colleges
now require two doses of measles vac
cine pnor to college entry.
While not required by Stanford this fall, it is
strongly recommended that students bom
1957 or later who have not had a second
vaccination do so at Cowell as soon as
possible. The charge will be $25. No
appointment is needed.
Exception: students who have had a
measles vaccination at Cowell or else
where since 1979, need not have a
second shot.
