First-graders at McNair
Elementary School in East Palo
Alto greeted sophomore Hernan
Vera, shouting, "Coach, coach!"
Vera and others from his dorm
work for TEAM, a public service
program that sends Stanford stu
dents to East Palo Alto schools
each week to teach physical edu
cation.
Vera said he likes working with
children. "They give so much
back. They have so much affec
tion. They always want to grab
your hand or sit in your lap."
Program coordinator Jennifer
Steele said there is almost no
structured physical education
taught in East Palo Alto schools,
although a California state law
requires that school children have
a certain number of hours during
the week.
The main purpose of TEAM is
to "put in structured time for the
kids, have them learn, skills, build
cardiovascular strength, health,
and Steele said.
D'Layne Kerr, another coordi
nator, said there are currently 150
student volunteers working at five
different schools in East Palo Alto.
Dorm groups teach children from
first through sixth grades.
The program was started in
1985 by Chris Braun, a Stanford
undergraduate who began by
taking a small group from his
dorm to one school in East Palo
Alto.
"The first time I went, as soon
as I walked in, all the kids jumped
out of their seats with beaming
smiles and wanted to play," said
freshman Shawn Canter. The
younger children like to play
games like "duck, duck, goose"
and "steal the bacon," while the
older children want to play sports
like soccer or football, Canter said.
Canter said that in the last class
he taught, the class was divided
into two groups to play both foot
ball and basketball. "We would

pretend to be like the 49ers and
I'd say 'go out for a bomb,' " he
said. "The kids were eager to show
us how fast they were," Canter
said, "so we had three or four
races to see who could come in
first. They were very excited
about that."
McNair Vice Principal Bob
Howington said, "The Stanford
students get a positive reaction
from the students and teachers
and are a very big help."
Howington said the children
would be taught physical educa
tion if the TEAM members didn't
come, but the instruction
wouldn't be as structured.
'"The children get a little bit
more from'PE," Howington' sfcid.
"They get to' do things.in smaller
groups and do different kinds of
activities." The TEAM coaches, he
said, "have a youth and enthusi
asm about PE" that the regular
teachers may not always have.
The children are being taught
important lessons and skills. "The
kids are very competitive and
really get into it," said sophomore
Marilyn Gray. "We try to teach
them to learn about sportsman
ship.
"Some boys, and especially the
girls, don't even know how to
catch a ball, but we try to encour
age them to participate," Gray
added.
Vera said coaching the children
is fun for him because it gives
him a chance to relive his child
hood. He said he made several
one-on-one friendships in his
fifth-grade class. "I think if I help
one or two or even more, it's worth
it,"he said.
