# Students offer the basics to barrio kids

Junior Nicky Ramos drove
through East Palo Alto Saturday
morning with nine children in
the back of her old Volvo station
wagon.
"All these kids have big
hearts," she said. "I'd go to the
edge of the earth for my kids."
Then she paused. "I mean,
they're not my kids. Can you
imagine having these guys be
my kids?" she joked.
"We are your kids!" shouted

For 17 years, Stanford stu

program have been tutoring
children from East Palo Alto
schools on weekends. The kids

Many families in East Palo Alto are

to learn English.

learn the basics: reading, writ
ing, math and science.
But Stanford students also
give these children lessons not
taught in the classroom. Rela
tionships developed in the pro
gram give the children the
self-confidence and role models

needed to educate themselves
and better their lives.
"We don't claim to save
anyone's lives," Ramos said. "We
just give them support." She in
sisted barrio children are no dif
ferent from other children, and
the kids in the station wagon
backed up this assertion, teasing

each other about their alleged
girlfriends and boyfriends.
"I like to read any kind of
books," Romero said. "I want to
become a mechanic, like my fath
er. Maybe something else, I don't
know."
Ramos said children in East
Palo Alto receive different envi
ronmental pressures than other
children. "If parents have the
time and energy to put into their
child's education, it shows," she
said. "It often turns out, though,
that the parents are over
worked."
Many families in East Palo
Alto are newly arrived South and
Central American immigrants,
and there is additional pressure
on their children to adjust and
to learn English.
Another barrier to the
children's development is the
drug dealers who wake up early
Saturday morning and arrive on
the street corners before the
tutors come to pick the children
up.
At El Centro Chicano, where
the children are taught, they eat
breakfast and play tag before
their tutors arrive. The 75 Stan
ford students who staff the pro
gram tutor the children
individually, some in both
Spanish and English.
Sophomore Victoria Carreon,
a program tutor, said, "It's a
really rewarding experience. You
can teach the students one-on
one and see them progress be
cause you can tutor the same
kid over four years."
Apparently, the program is
getting through to many of the
children. The students were
given an assignment to write on
what they wanted to be when
they grew up. Many wanted to
be police officers or teachers.
One child, Albert Moreno,
wrote, "I want to be a doctor so
I can help poor people and my
family. When poor people need
help, I am going to cure them
and not charge them too much
money."
