## Officials say 30 dead as Colombian jet crashes in N.Y. 
### 
COVE NECK, N.Y. (AP) — A Colom
bian Boeing 707 with more than 140
people aboard crashed in fog and rain
last night while on approach to Kennedy
International Airport, killing as many as
30 people and injuring dozens, authorities
said.
Avianca Flight 52, en route from
Bogota, crashed at about 9:45 p.m. in
this isolated, exclusive hamlet on the
north shore of Long Island, Kennedy air
port officials said. The jet broke into
several pieces.
"There were just dead bodies all over

the place. ... It was the worst thing you
ever saw," an unidentified young man
who arrived at the scene told WNBC-TV.
"Kids were screaming for their parents.
Parents were screaming for their kids,"
said Robert Laßella, a Long Island res
ident who helped remove six people from
the wreckage. After that, "I just couldn't
take it anymore."
New York City Emergency Medical
Service personnel said there were 25 to
30 people killed, according to spokes
woman Lynn Schulman. But she said
Nassau County officials were reporting

a much lower total.
"There's a lot of confusion going on,"
Schulman said. "Our medical director is
at the scene. .. . It's very dark. It's a
wooded area. These are the figures we
have. Our people feel they are correct."
Earlier in the night, Kathleen Bergen,
a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said at least nine people
were confirmed dead. Seventy people
were being taken to area hospitals, said
Nassau County fire dispatcher Robert
Sutton.
Some were in critical condition with

multiple fractures and shock, hospital of
ficials said. Of the injured, at least nine
were children.
CBS-TV reported that doctors on the
scene said at least 80 survivors were being
cared for there. The FAA knew of at
least 30 survivors, Bergen said.
Many ambulances and helicopters were
at the scene, where bloodied victims were
lined up on stretchers. Some passengers
were seen lying motionless. Others, in
cluding children, were conscious and ap
parently not seriously hurt as they were
helped from the wreckage.

Kennedy's control tower lost contact
with Flight 52 at 9:34 p.m. when the
23-year-old Boeing 707 was about 15
miles northeast of the airport after a
five-hour flight, said Port Authority
Police Officer Phil Montouri.
Montouri said "there was no radio com
munication at all to the tower. It just
went down."
Steve Ulman, a Cove Neck resident,
said the plane narrowly missed a house
and crashed three houses away from one
owned by tennis star John McEnroe.
