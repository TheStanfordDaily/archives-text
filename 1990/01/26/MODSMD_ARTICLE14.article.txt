BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)
— A former diplomat who re
turned home after 50 years in
exile said yesterday he fears the
gains of the pro-democracy revo
lution are being thwarted by the
provisional government.
lon Ratiu, who arrived Wednes
day, joined opposition parties in
denouncing the decision of the
governing National Salvation
Front to compete in elections in
May.
"This is a negation of democ
racy in my view," he said.
For the second straight night,
about 300 people gathered outside
Front headquarters to demand
the governing body's resignation,
despite a ban on such protests.
The protesters, about 150 feet
from the building, shouted "Down
with the Front!" and"The Na
tional Salvation Front equals the
Communist Party of Romania!"
Between them and the building
stood two lines of police and sol
diers in armored vehicles, their
guns pointed at the protesters.
A similar rally Wednesday
ended peacefully.
In apparent response to that
protest, the governing body yes
terday again published in news
papers a decree outlawing dem

onstrations on Bucharest streets
without police permits.
Critics say the provisional gov
ernment cannot remain neutral if
it takes part in elections that it
administers, and some accuse it
of being a front for Communist
rule.
The U.S. State Department said
yesterday Romania's leaders had
gone too far in banning protests
in Bucharest and urged them to
reaffirm their commitment to
democratic rule.
Three opposition parties called
for the Front to resign and for a
broader-based interim govern
ment to rule until the May 20
elections. The joint communique
indicated the parties have formed
an alliance against the Front.
Ratiu, 72, heads the World
Union of Free Romanians, the lar
gest Romanian exile organization.
Ratiu was a Romanian diplomat
in Britain in 1940 and asked for
political asylum when a Nazi gov
ernment took over his country
that year. He moved to Britain
and became a millionaire through
property and shipping interests.
"I've come to this country ...
after having been steeped in West
ern democracy ... I've come to this
country to help establish real de

mocracy," he said yesterday.
Asked whether he was worried
about losing the gains of the revo
lution that ended one-party Com
munist rule, Ratiu said: "I am
worried and certainly will do my
best to prevent it, because ...
people sacrificed their lives for
real democracy."
He said he was most concerned
that the Front was not providing
equal access to all parties on radio,
television and newspapers. He
said he plans to start a newspaper.
Ratiu hopes to be a candidate
for the National Peasant Party in
his hometown of Turda in western
Transylvania.
Asked if he would accept an
offer to run for president, he
replied, "I will accept to serve in
whatever capacity they ask me."
lon Puiu, the party's vice pres
ident, on Wednesday called Ratiu
"one of the greatest figures of our
party."
Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu was overthrown in the
revolution Dec. 22 and executed
three days later, and the National
Salvation Front was to rule until
the elections. It first said it would
not field candidates, but it
reversed itself Tuesday.
