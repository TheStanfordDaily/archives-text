# Soviet economic outlook bleak

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -
Economic reforms initiated by
Mikhail S. Gorbachev have had
little impact so far in the Soviet
Union and appear unlikely to
succeed, NATO believes.
A NATO study obtained yester
day by The Associated Press called
the failure evident from the
decline in Soviet living standards.
The report, based on informa
tion up to July, compared eco
nomic reforms in China and the
Soviet Union. Economic analysts
of the 16-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization compiled the
study and handed it to NATO
foreign ministers in December.
It said, "The failure of the So
viet leadership to press ahead
with key measures such as price
reforms, and the half-hearted
manner in which it has ap
proached the growing fiscal and
monetary crisis, are reflected in
the continuing decline of the So
viet Union's economic position.
"The survival prospects for eco

nomic reforms in the Soviet
Union — now admitted by the
leadership to be in a 'state of
crisis' — become increasingly
doubtful."
The report said no Communist
nation has succeeded in trans
forming a centrally planned econ
omy to a flourishing free-market
system, mainly because of the
conflicting interests between de
mands for economic reforms and
the goals of Communist parties
and the vested interests of their
members.
The analysts found, "Whenever
it came to do or die in past reform
efforts, the party bureaucrats
have always put their own interest
first, as reflected once again by
recent events in China."
It said that from the start, eco
nomic programs in the Soviet
Union and China were hampered
by "unsuitable political institu
tions," and predicted the reform
drive in China would lose more
ground. The study said reform

has been "rechanneled toward
areas the new, more
conservative and auspicious lead
ership in Beijing,*,..
Poland and Hungary, leaders in
the moves toward democracy in
Eastern Europe, offered the
prospect of cutting ties between
the Communist Party bureau
cracy and its vested interest in
obsolete economic structures, the
study held, adding:
"Gorbachev's support for these
efforts in Hungary and Poland
may be indicative of his own vi
sion of reform."
The NATO report said, "By
trying to maintain the country's
'socialist achievements,' economic
reforms in the Soviet Union will
remain piecemeal.
"But piecemeal reforms to a
centrally planned economy
generate unpredictable frictions
that would not arise if other eco
nomic variables were free to adapt
to remove their sting."
