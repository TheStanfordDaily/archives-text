## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Warring
nationalists agreed yesterday to a
cease-fire along one of the tense
battlefronts of the bloody conflict
between Armenia and Azerbaijan,
Tass said.
The announcement came as
Baltic activists, worried that the
dispute might affect their own
peaceful push for independence,
offered to help mediate the blood
feud between Armenia and Azer
baijan.
Iran, which has ethnic and re
ligious ties to Azerbaijan, also of
fered to help settle the crisis.
There were fewer reports of
fighting yesterday.Tass said life
was returning to normal in Baku,
the Azerbaijani capital that was
the scene of much of the violence.
During talks in the Armenian
town of Yeraskhe, representatives
of the Armenian All-National

Movement and the People's Front
of Nakhichevan agreed to lay
down their weapons, the Soviet
news agency said.
"According to the agreement. . .
along the entire border between
Armenia and the Nakhichevan
Autonomous region all exchanges
of fire between opposing informal
groups must stop," Tass said.
Nakhichevan is culturally and
politically a part of Azerbaijan,
although it is physically separated
from the republic by Armenia,
which lies on its northern border.
It is bounded by Iran on the south
and a small section in the west
borders Turkey.
Tass did not say whether the
truce was holding. It also was un
certain whether the two organi
zations could enforce it.
Martin Martirosyan, a spokes
man for the the Armenian All-

National Movement, said no
agreement had been reached yet
on an exchange of hostages. He
said three Armenians were being
held by Azerbaijanis.
Tass also said a truce was
reached on the border of Ar
menia's Idzhevan district and
Azerbaijan's Kazakh district.
Christian Armenians and Mos
lem Azerbaijanis have been
feuding for the past two years
primarily over control of Nagorno-
Karabakh, a section of Azerbaijan
populated mainly by ethnic Ar
menians.
The feud has exploded into a
virtual civil war and has fueled a
nationalist movement to make
Azerbaijan independent of the So
viet Union.
On Jan. 13-14, Azerbayanis at
tacked ethnic Armenians living in
the Baku, killing dozens.
