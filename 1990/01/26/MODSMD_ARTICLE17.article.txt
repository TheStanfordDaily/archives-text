Liberian massacre reported
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — Liberian sol
diers accused of massacring civilians are leaving
few survivors in their relentless search for rebels
near the Ivory Coast border, diplomats and med
ical workers said yesterday.
"They tell really horrendous stories of soldiers
spraying entire villages with ,50-caliber machine
guns," a Western diplomat said. Bullets from
such heavy weapons tear huge holes in bodies.
The diplomat and Ivorian sources estimated
at least 500 civilians had been killed in Liberia's
eastern Nimba region since soldiers were sent to
stop rebel attacks that began Dec. 24.
"Refugees say there are not many wounded
people because the soldiers slaughtered so many,"
the diplomat said.
Non-Communists resign
EAST BERLIN (AP) — A minority party in
East Germany's Communist-led government
resigned its three Cabinet posts late yesterday
and called on other coalition partners to do
likewise.
The withdrawal by the Christian Democratic
Union (CDU), effective Feb. 9, heightened the
crisis of confidence faced by the Communist gov
ernment of Premier Hans Modrow.
The government was forced earlier yesterday
to agree to meyor concessions to encourage free
enterprise because of growing pressure for market
reforms and reunification with West Germany.
Haitian siege may end
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril said his military government might
declare an end Friday to the 30-day state of siege
imposed after an army colonel was slain last
weekend.
A radical political leader was reported missing
yesterday, days after the government declared
the emergency, exiled several opponents and ar
rested others, who said police beat them.
When reporters asked Avril yesterday when he
would lift the state of siege, he frowned and said:
"It could be tomorrow." Critics accuse Avril of
using the killing Saturday of Col. Andre Neptune,
his wife and a servant as a pretext to crack down
on the opposition and renege on elections.
Since Saturday, the military government has

arrested more than 50 political leaders and
militants. Most have been released, but five civic
and political leaders and two radical militants
were exiled to the United States and France.

Storm lashes Europe
LONDON (AP) — A fierce storm with torrential
rains driven by winds of up to 110 mph cut a
trail of destruction across southern England and
into Europe yesterday, killing at least 62 people
in five countries.
A reactor chimney was blown down at the
Paluel nuclear power plant in France. State
owned Electricite de France said the plant was
shut down immediately and any possible hazards
would be monitored.
The casualty figure was highest in Britain,
where police said 39 people had been killed. Else
where, authorities reported 11 killed in the Neth
erlands, six in France, five in Belgium and one
in West Germany.
Refugees fate undecided
GENEVA (AP) — An international meeting
has ended in disarray, and the fate of thousands
of Vietnamese refugees hangs on a dispute be
tween the United States and Britain over whether
they should be sent home against their will.
The 30-nation conference on refugees ad
journed Wednesday after U.S. officials insisted
no Vietnamese be forced to return home before
Jan. 1, 1991. That blocked consensus on a pro
posed starting date of July 1.
The U.N. refugee office had proposed the six
month suspension of repatriations as a compro
mise between U.S. demands and Britain's argu
ment that only immediate deportations would
deter another mass influx of boat people to the
overcrowded colony.
Although the two-day meeting ended without
agreement, it marked the first international con
sensus that Vietnamese deemed to have fled for
economic rather than political reasons should be
returned even against their will.
"We do have agreement on mandatory repatria
tion," McLaren told reporters. "What we don't
have is a date."
McLaren said lack of an international agree
ment would not deter Britain from returning
boat people under last year's agreement with
Vietnam.
