Guaranteed bid system
was degrading to women
rushing sororities

IMAGINE THE MEN on
campus getting dressed up and
being led around from frater
nity to fraternity in small groups
during Rush.
Imagine men on campus being
guaranteed a spot in a fraternity
so that their feelings won't be hurt.
The recent decision by the In
tersorority Council to get rid of
the guaranteed bid system for
Sorority Rush is long overdue.
Women on this campus are just as
strong and capable of dealing with
rejection as men. They are not little
children who have to be led around
by the hand.
It is true that no one likes to
be excluded from a group. But
that's life. No one likes it when
someone is picked over them. But
it happens.
The guaranteed bid system was
based on the insulting premise that
women cannot handle rejection on
their own. Rejection is not an easy
thing to handle, but it is ridiculous
to assume that women are less
well-equipped to handle it than
men. Women are strong and should
not be underestimated.
The main argument against the
guaranteed bid system is that

smaller sororities are forced to ac
cept members they might not want.
This argument is made by the
leaders of smaller sororities them
selves.
It seems cruel on the surface
but it is true that a sorority should
not be forced to accept women who
they do not want. Perhaps after a
while, those women will be in
cluded into the group, but chances
are that they will never feel quite
right and they will lose the benefit
of joining a sorority or de-pledge.
It also seems as if sororities are
not the only ones who are selective.
90 percent of the women who go
through Sorority Rush do not even
fill out their Rush cards complete
ly. There are some sororities that
they don't want to be in â€” they
reject the sorority by not listing it
on their card. That, in itself, is
enough to show that the guaran
teed bid system is outdated and
unnecessary.
Another argument goes that the
smaller sororities may not survive
if they are not assured that rushees
will be guaranteed a bid. But this
too is annulled by women not
utilizing their guaranteed bid op
tion.
The 10 percent of the women
who still use the system are just
as strong as the 90 percent who
opt not to. It is about time the
University stopped leading women
around by the hand and trusted
them to deal with the challenges,
joys, disappointments and glories
of life themselves.
