# Under consideration
## Engineering dean eyed for presidencies 
### Elizabeth Howton Editorial staff 
School of Engineering Dean
James Gibbons is reportedly un
der consideration for the
presidencies of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology or Car
negie Mellon University, but he's
not saying publicly whether he's
interested in either post.
Although Gibbons will not con
firm and deny that he is a can
didate at either school, he says he
has "talked with people of both
institutions at their request" and
given his "views of various prob
lems and opportunities" confront
ing the two universities.
But despite these "discussions
of institutional opportunities," he

says, "I'm not
looking for an
other job."
A recent issue
of Science maga
zine said Gibbons
was "under dis
cussion" as a can
didate for the
MIT presidency.
University Presi-

dent Donald Kennedy was also
named as a possibility.
Kennedy, who remarked in an
interview with The Daily last
month that "I can take off a lot
of clothes, and I'll still be wearing
Cardinal red underwear under
neath," is not considered likely to


Glbbons
leave Stanford any time soon.
The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon's
student newspaper, reported this
week that Gibbons was the
"favored candidate" in Carnegie
Mellon's search in late October,
but that his level of interest has
decreased since then.
Calling the overtures "a tribute
to Stanford," Gibbons explained
that other schools are interested
in the way Stanford treats issues
and solves problems.
"People have a great regard for
how Stanford has done things for
the past three decades" during its
rise to national, he said.
MlT's provost, John Deutch,

who was a leading candidate for
the MIT presidency, announced
Tuesday that he will resign as
provost and return to teaching
and research, according to The
Tech, MlT's student newspaper.
It was not clear whether he with
drew his name from consideration
for the presidency or whether the
search committee told him he
would not be offered the post.
Deutch had been unpopular
with some students and faculty
members for what they called his
abrasive and uncommunicative
management style and for his
large income from corporate con
sulting.
Gibbons is a professor of elec
trical engineering and also holds
an appointment at the Center for
Integrated Systems.
