## Can't fault refund seekers 
### 
WHEN STUDENTS lined up last
quarter to receive their ASSU
fee refunds, they walked away
with more than 30 percent of the budgets
for many student groups, including a
staggering 51.4 percent of the Asian
American Student Association's budget.
Fourteen student groups lost at least
25 percent of their annual funding.
Many students, rocked by this news,
responded with a resounding "So what?"
Granted, many of the student groups
on campus contribute much to the intel
lectual and cultural atmosphere of Stan
ford. The ASSU Speakers' Bureau, for
instance, brings a wide assortment of
ideologists, politicians and national fig
ures to campus. I've learned more from
some of their speakers than I've learned
in some classes.
Many other student groups, however,
fail to serve much of the student body
outside their own constituencies, al
though they would have you believe that
they are indispensable facets of Stanford
life.
Speakers' Bureau Director Rana
Bhadury wrote The Daily Tuesday that
students "don't really think too much
about taking their money back" and
"there is a trend toward .. . taking back
more and more money."
Imagine that. Students who shell out
$20,000 a year to be here are taking
some of their money back when the
chance is offered them. Can that be
faulted?
And if students haven't benefited from
a group's existence, why shouldn't they
take their money back from that group?

Another underlying factor for the mas
sive fee refunds appears to be the dreaded
"backlash effect." The Black Student
Union narrowly won its fee assessment
in 1988 after a year of high profile agita
tion for a reform of the Western Culture
Program.
Last spring, the backlash victim was
the Axe Committee. After tying them
selves to the axe for years, refusing to
let mere students near the thing and
wasting two years trying to fix the axe's
display case, students shot them down
twice in the spring elections.
Looking at the groups that lost the
most from the fall refunds, the backlash
seems to be omnipresent. The elections
last spring occurred before the May 15
occupation of University President
DonaJd Kennedy's office; the refunds gave
students their first opportunity to un
leash the backlash against the student
groups behind the takeover.^
Three of the four biggest losers \rttere"'
students of color groups (which seem to
perpetually have some part of the campus
angry at them); the Stanford Band, after
a very unfunny and tiresome football
halftime season, lost 31.5 percent of its
fee request.
But student groups that appeared to
have done nothing wrong still lost big.
The Speakers' Bureau lost 31.9 percent,
Club Sports lost 29 percent and the Con
cert Network lost 29 percent.
To avoid the losses to campus life that
might occur, the ASSU can try a couple
of approaches.
Every quarter, a student pays $28 in
fees. Most likely, he or she does not re

quest all of it back, but only from those
groups that don't seem to benefit him
or her or the campus as a whole.
Instead of charging a flat rate and then
distributing it among all of the various
student groups, lower the rate to $20 but
without the option of receiving a refund,
and then allow the student to determine
which group gets how much of his or her
money.
A second approach is to abolish all
student fees and force the groups to raise
the money themselves, from students or
alumni, community groups, fundraisers,
whatever. It might take a few years of
students partially subsidizing these
groups as they create a reliable network
of fundraising, but if phased in gradually,
those groups most committed to reaching
the entire Stanford community would
benefit.
We cannot blame students for taking
their money back, but the student body
needs to find a way to protect the budgets
of those student groups that enhance
Stanford's community.
Unless steps are taken to solve this
dilemma, we will all lose some part of
campus life that we value.

quest all of it back, but only from those
groups that don't seem to benefit him
or her or the campus as a whole.
Instead of charging a flat rate and then
distributing it among all of the various
student groups, lower the rate to $20 but
without the option of receiving a refund,
and then allow the student to determine
which group gets how much of his or her
money.
A second approach is to abolish all
student fees and force the groups to raise
the money themselves, from students or
alumni, community groups, fundraisers,
whatever. It might take a few years of
students partially subsidizing these
groups as they create a reliable network
of fundraising, but if phased in gradually,
those groups most committed to reaching
the entire Stanford community would
benefit.
We cannot blame students for taking
their money back, but the student body
needs to find a way to protect the budgets
of those student groups that enhance
Stanford's community.
Unless steps are taken to solve this
dilemma, we will all lose some part of
campus life that we value.
