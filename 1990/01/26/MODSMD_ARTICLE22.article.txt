## Columnist praises black leaders who are anti-Semitic 
### 
I WISH TO EXPRESS my outrage
at the comments of Cheryl Taylor
in her Monday column. In the
midst of lecturing why we should all
support the Black Student Union, she
mentions that, "... we (the Stanford
community) are all inspired by the
messages of Bishop Desmond Tutu,
Jesse Jackson, (etc. . . .)"
While I hold much respect for the
remaining members of her list, I am
insulted by the inclusion of the first
two.
On the Bishop's recent visit to Israel,
he delivered two messages to the
Jewish population:
• The Israeli's treatment of the
Palestinians, he decreed, was akin to

Taylor's upholding Bishop Desmond Tutu and Jesse
Jackson shows an insensitive disregard for the values
and beliefs of others.

the white South Africans' treatment of
blacks, and
• It is time the Jews forgave the
Nazis.
His first point is obviously one of
ignorance, as the state of Israel's right
to exist is not even acknowledged by
most of the countries in the Middle
East. It is impossible to live peacefully
among war-like peoples who would
rather see you extirpated.

His second point is almost comical.
The Jews should forgive the Nazis,
who only 50 years ago attempted to
exterminate our race from the earth.
This comes from a black man, when
many black Americans still point to
slavery for the reason for their current
socioeconomic position.
Slavery ended over 100 years ago.
This is not meant to be insensitive
toward the black community but

rather to draw parallels between the
two most persecuted groups in history.
Jackson's ideas are much better
known. From the day he uttered the
word "Hymietown" ("hymie" being as
derogatory a word as "nigger"), the
Jewish community has known his
stance. His subsequent inclusion of the
Jews in the "Rainbow Coalition" was
nothing more than patronization and
an insult to our collective intelligence.
I believe that each individual is
entitled to his or her own opinion, but
blanket statements such as Taylor's
show an insensitive disregard for the
values and beliefs of others.
