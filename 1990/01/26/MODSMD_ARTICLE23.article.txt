# ASSU should only make students who use services pay for them
## 
### 
An article "ASSU refunds increase,
leaving groups strapped" in the Mon
day Daily manifests the problems in
the current ASSU fee assessment pro
gram at Stanford.
According to the article, most stu
dent groups lost in excess of 30 percent
of their monies through the quarterly
refund process. It seems clear that
either most people do not want fund
ing for certain programs or a third
want funding for no programs.
I wonder if there are more students
who are dissatisfied with the way their
money is being spent but do not get
their refunds due to the annoying,
time-consuming process necessary to
obtain refunds.
Most students merely accept the
ASSU fee assessment as another ex
pense which gets lost among the four
figure charges they see on their Uni-

versity bill. But it is interesting to see
just how flimsy is the ASSU's "jurisdic
tion" to take away our money.
Perhaps a more important issue is
that everyone must automatically pay
for all fees and services which the
ASSU provides before they can obtain
refunds, whether they want them or
not.
At the same time, there seems to be
a clear conflict of interest when the
same ASSU which administers the
funds also is in charge of informing
the students about the possiblity of
refunds; as a case in point, many
freshmen do not even know that they
can get refunds due to the paucity of
publicity about rebates.
The final result is that students who
do utilize the organizations and clubs
are subsidized by the many who either
do not know or are too frustrated by
the process to get refunds.
The current fee refund solution is
clearly inadequate. A better solution
would be for the students that actually
use the services to pay for them. One
system of implementation would be to
send individuals a form over the sum

mer asking whether they want fees
added to their bill or not.
Another approach would lead to di
rectly charging students for services
whether it means levying dues on club
members or selling The Daily.
Either mechanism would lead to a
more efficient result in which only
organizations which actually have
popular support would receive funding,
and only students which benefit from
the activity would pay for them. And
there will be one less line on campus.
