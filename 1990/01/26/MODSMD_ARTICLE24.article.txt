I applaud Facilities Project Manage
ment Secretary Debra Cleveland's Wed
nesday letter concerning the question
of Stan ford'B divestment from South
Africa.
I know that it would not be a con

venient or simple move for Stanford to
make; there are vast complexities in
volved.
However, if moral conscience has any
appeal, then I am confident that Stan
ford will not stand with those Ameri
can institutions and businesses (largely
dominated by white Americans) that
are of paternalistic mind — that pur
port divestment is not in black South
Africans' best interests despite the fact
that the call for divestment comes
from the vast mEyority of black South
Africans themselves.
This type of arrogance is an insult
to black South Africans. If we boldly
claim to support their struggles, we
should respect their appeal for divest
ment. although it entails a struggle for
us.
I do not ask Stanford to divest and
expect to be immune from personal
cost if it is necessary. I, as an em
ployee of this University, would volun
tarily accept a salary freeze or reduc
tion
