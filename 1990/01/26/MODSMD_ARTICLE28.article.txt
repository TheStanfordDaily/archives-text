## Stanford students pursue personal research projects 
### Theresa Urist 
Say you find yourself in a less
than-appealing class, reading The
Daily as a source of diversion and
pondering what it would be like
to break the confines of the lec
ture hall.
Perhaps you'd rather be in the
shoes of Stanford engineering stu
dents Rich Reay, Louis Rosenberg
and Tom Annau, who are cur
rently toiling away for academic
credit in a Stanford laboratory,
trying to construct a bi-pedal
robot which will combine electri
cal and mechanical engineering
skills. Or perhaps you'd like to
research and write a paper on a
federal compensation law you in
vestigated last summer, as senior
Leslie Hatamiya is currently
doing.
Or, maybe it would be your pref
erence to document some of the
artwork on campus, and interview
the artists, just as Daniel Luna
and Anita DeLucio are now doing
at Casa Zapata and El Centro Chi
cano. Sound challenging? Well, it's
certainly a possibility, if you are
a Stanford student who is both
innovative and inquisitive, and
also anxious to try a personal re
search project. All you need to do
is stop by the Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities program, lo
cated in Sweet Hall, and find out
how the URO may be able to help
guide and fund you in your re
search ambitions.
Initiated in 1974, the URO
exists for the purpose of helping
undergraduate students complete
individual research projects for ac
ademic credit. The URO was orig
inally designed with the motive
of linking undergraduates and
faculty in faculty-initiated re
search efforts. The setup involved
professors listing possible re
search projects that students
could complete for academic cred
it. This professor-suggested/
student-accepted format worked
fairly successfully until the winter
of 1985, when the URO under
went a transformation from low
key to high tech, and students
gained considerable opportunities
to initiate their own research proj
ects.
The first factor in the profile
the URO came through
a decision to move the headquar
ters from the Old Union basement
to the first floor of Sweet Hall.
The organization — literally —
moved up in the world. A mone
tary contribution also aided in the
URO's development, with a
$300,000 endowment from the
Firestone family fortifying the or
ganization and allowing it to
expand financially. A third chris
tening element — Project Con-

care to studying elections in Nicaragua.

course — added the high tech
aspect to the organization, by al
lowing research opportunities to
be displayed on computer Folio
files, thus heightening acces
sability. Finally, the format of the
program was changed from
professor-suggested to student
suggested, so that any student
with a challenging and well
defined research proposal can ap
ply for URO funds.
The statistics prove the URO
program has been successfully
launched as a popular undergrad
uate alternative. In the spring of
1985, the program awarded 25
grants and 38 small grants
to Stanford undergraduates. A
major grant covers up to $2500
worth of student research ex
penses, while a minor grant offers
a maximum of $500. Since then,
the URO has given funding to
634 projects, amounting in a
grand total of $558,000 awarded
to student-designed research ef
forts.
On the average, the organiza
tion has awarded $878 per student
to pursue their projects. Last
spring alone, the URO accepted
proposals for 163 projects, thus
agreeing to reimburse $183,000.
According to Laura Selznick, di
rector of URO, the monies, "are
given in small chunks, so everyone
has a chance."
So how do the students spend
the grant in relation to their proj
ect? Selznick says that allotted
grant funds are mostly used
toward supplies, expenses and
travel. She adds that in certain
circumstances, students on finan
cial aid pursuing summer re
search can receive supplemental
funding to replace lost summer
earnings. Last year, 15 students
pn financial aid received an acjLded
stipend to compensate them Tor
lost earnings. Selznick stresses
that, "You don't have to be rich
to participate — it's the academic
content that matters."
Selznick explains enthusiasti
cally why this program not only
is popular, but also may be a nec
essary alternative for Stanford
undergraduates. "Students can
come to Stanford and satisfy dis
tribution requirements, but they
don't get anything to take away

all their own. Through the URO
students must know a faculty
member, define a project and fig
ure out resources. The quarter
system is such a push; while this
(research) offers a greater depth,"
she claims. "You can forget the
facts you've learned, but skills
stay with you — you don't just
do what you're told."
Selznick says the application
process isn't all that hard, as long
as you've got well-defined ideas.
In order to apply for URO funds,
students must first find a faculty
member to sponsor the project,
then draft an explicit proposal and
submit a transcript along with a
budget outline. Reay, Rosenberg
and Annau submitted a 40-page
proposal — one of the longest the
URO has ever received — when
they applied for funding, but in
general, it's the quality of the pro
posal that matters. Once accepted
by the URO, funding will be pro
vided mostly through a network
of private donors, many of whom
meet or exchange letters with
their researching students.
Past successful research pro
posals have covered a wide variety
of subjects, from examining
African tribal health care to
studying elections in Nicaragua.
Other grant recipients have fol
lowed the human rights move
ment in Chile, or tested the
non-compliance of teens in cancer
therapy. Many times, undergrad
uate researchers have chosen their
project based on a personal goal,
for which deep personal motiva
tion is necessary. Following are
the projects of a few highly
motivated students, who were able
to pursue personal and academic
interests by applying to the URO.
Luck and timing
Leslie Hatamiya, a Japanese-
is a Stanford senior
making in political science. An
issue which is personally impor
tant to herself and her family is
the effort of the U. S. government
to address the wrongs done to
Japanese-Americans during
World War 11. Hatamiya therefore
designed her own research proj
ect, titled "Righting a wrong —
the passage of the Civil Liberties
Act of 1988," which she calls a
case study of a recently-passed bill
that gives monetary compensa

tion and governmental apology to
Japanese- Americans interred
during World War 11.
Hatamiya, who is the daughter
of two previously interred citizens,
decided to focus her research on
why the bill had passed. With
Japanese- Americans making up
only a small proportion of the pop
ulation and a price tag for com
pensation set at $1.2 billion, this
legislation seemed unlikely on the
surface to be passed into law.
Hatamiya said her studies took
her on a trip to Washington where
she interviewed grass roots organ
izers, congresspeople and commit
tee staff council members. In her
two weeks of concentrated re
search, Hatamiya was able to
speak to two previously interred
congresspeople from California,
Norman Mineta and Robert Mat
sui, as well as interviewing
California Senator Alan Cranston
and legislative otaff from-eight
other congressional offices.
Hatamiya also traveled to New
York and interviewed Japanese-
American Citizen League organi
zers.
Hatamiya said she began her
research looking for demographic
factors as a key to the bill's suc
cess, but ended by concluding that
"luck and timing" played a much
larger role. Currently, Hatamiya
has written about 130 pages of
what she estimates will be a 250-

page manuscript documenting her
research. She says she's not sure
what will happen to the paper
once complete, but hopes for pub
lication if the paper is good.
In retrospect, Hatamiya looks
favorably on her opportunity to
research a subject she found per
sonally and academically challeng
ing. She adds that the URO played
an integral role in funding such
research efforts, and zealously
recommends the URO: "They give
undergrads an opportunity to do
first-hand research, (which) the
average Stanford student is not
able to do in class."
A cultural effort
A picture tells a thousand
words. Anita DeLucio and Daniel
Luna, also Stanford undergradu
ates, have designed a research
project to document the words of
painted pictures.
Luna, a senior and resident as
sistant at Casa Zapata, became
interested in the many murals in
Zapata when he first lived there
as a freshman. DeLucio, a Spanish
major, says her interest was
peaked in a Chicano Fellows class.
The duo has set out to document,
photograph and research the 22
murals which emblazon the walls
of Casa Zapata and El Centro Chi
cano.
The vivid wall paintings, dating
back as far as 1973, depict strong
images and messages relating to

the climate of their times. Bright
colors relaying political themes
and social statements are artistic
renditions of a changing era.
Luna's and DeLucio's research
has taken them on interviews and
information -gathering sessions
both inside and outside of the
Stanford community. Basically,
the goal of their project is to
produce concrete documentation
on the different artists of the
murals, and to state the initial
purpose of each mural.
According to the pair, the re
search grant from URO helps pro
vide funding for a mailing sent
out to all Chicano alumni since
1973. In addition, the monies for
the research went toward copied
material, video equipment rental
and photography of the wall paint
ings. Explains Luna, "the money
helped in giving us extra re
sources so that we can go back
the details."
As an ultimate goal, the two
plan to publish a pamphlet or book
outlining their findings, which
will provide the community with
a reference on each mural. The
two have a strong interest in ac
complishing this aim, and
DeLucio encourages "anyone who
has any special interest to pursue
it through the Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities." As a sec
ond thought she adds, "I would
recommend it . . . definitely."
