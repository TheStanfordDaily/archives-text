# Soul food chef knows how to please
## 
### Kim Bluitt 
Imagine yourself up late on an
other Friday night and all of a
sudden you feel those familiar
hunger pangs which seem to
strike around midnight. You could
call Domino's (again) or you could
try something new — something
tasty, fulfilling and reasonably
priced. Have you ever thought of
ordering . . . soul food?
Dimples and Company, a local
soul food restaurant, is located in
East Palo Alto at 1943 University
Ave. Open until 2 a.m. on Fridays
and Saturdays, Dimples and Com
pany features mouth-watering
dishes such as pork ribs, sliced
beef, chicken, barbecue baked
beans, potato salad, peach cobbler
and sweet potato pie to name a
few of the in-house and take-out
specialty items.
If these dishes sound irresisti
ble, then you really must meet
the proud owner of Dimples and
Company, Debra Gaines. Gaines,
who is nicknamed Dimples, has
captured the hearts of many Stan

ford students. Her association
with Stanford began three years
ago when she was asked by a Stan
ford professor to cater an on
campus event.
"I love working for Stanford,"
said Dimples. "I'm always
honored when they call and ask
me to do something." A business
graduate of the University of
Armstrong in Berkeley, Dimples
has been in business in East Palo
Alto for four years. In this span
of time, she has worked with
everyone from Stanford students
to entertainers like The Whispers,
Suave and Keith Sweat. Dimples
may soon become a local celebrity
herself, as future plans include
marketing her own barbecue
sauce, available in Safeway stores
next month.
Don't think success would go
to Dimples' head, however. Ac
cording to BROC Orientation co
ordinator Cheryl Taylor, who has
asked Dimples and Company to
cater several of the BROC activ
ities, "The thing I like about her
is that she's very professional and

her food is just amazing!"
Others on campus obviously
agree, for Dimples and Company
has catered for Stanford groups
ranging from the Stanford Medi
cal Center to several of the campus
tailgating parties, as well as sup
plying delivered lunches and inti
mate dinners for two on special
occasions.
In November, Dimples catered
for a play directed by a Stanford
senior, Corey Davis. "I needed
soul food for my play, 'America:
Countdown to Liberation.' The
food is wonderful. She makes a
mean sweet potato pie," grinned
Davis. "She's warm and treats you
like her own kid."
This warmth obviously is im
portant to Dimples, for she values
her relationship with Stanford
students. "It's important to me
that the students get as much out
of this as 1 do. I have a good
rapport with the students and
that means a lot to me because
I love young people and like to
see what they're trying to do with
their lives. They give me energy."
