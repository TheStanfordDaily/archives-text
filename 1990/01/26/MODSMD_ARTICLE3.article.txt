# Stanford-owned park skyrockets in value

The next time you visit the soc
cer and baseball fields in El
Camino Park in Palo Alto, tread
carefully on the grass. It's worth
more than $300,000.
Under terms of the 98-year
lease between the city of Palo Alto
and Stanford, the park's rent is
periodically adjusted to reflect the
market value of the University's
land. This year's assessment called
for more than a $100,000-per
year increase, a recommendation
that has upset the city.
According to Bill Fellman, real
property manager for Palo Alto,
the city owes Stanford a total of
$434,800 for the use of about 16
acres of the University's land, up
from last year's rent of $324,800.
El Camino Park, which occupies

7.5 acres of land across from the
Stanford Shopping Center, makes
up $313,547 of the bill.
The city has subleased the other
8.5 acres to businesses, including
the Red Cross, Mac Arthur Park
restaurant, the Holiday Inn and
various transportation facilities
owned by the district.
Despite the rent Palo Alto col
lects from these business tenants,
the city will endure a net loss of
$120,000 this year because of the
rent squeeze.
Fellman said that in order to
terminate the park's lease, both
the local voters and Stanford
would have to approve the break.
Stanford had expressed interest
in an "early out" if it could
develop the land itself, he added.
The Stanford Land Manage
ment Office did not return phone
calls.
