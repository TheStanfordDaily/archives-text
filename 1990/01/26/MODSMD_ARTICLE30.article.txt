# Bug examines chucking capacities of the woodchuck
## 
### Aram Irwin Staff writer 
Dear Bug,
It must be pretty rough picking
good questions out of all the ones
you receive each week. Why don't
you just make up your own ques
tions and answer them?
— Needle in the Haystack
"Pretty rough?" Actually it's
more than "pretty rough" to find
good questions. In fact, Needle,
finding good questions is almost
harder than, say, fitting a camel
through your eye, or maybe
(gasp!) even harder than getting
into Green Library without a pass
port.
That's why I have an account
on LOTS at Macbeth. Send your
pressing inquiries about love,
money, future, the love of your
future money (and good luck de
veloping that kind of love consid
ering your hefty Stanford loan)

to B.BUG-ME, or else write to
me care of The Stanford Daily,
Storke Publications Building,
Stanford, CA 94305.
But back to your question,
Needle. Why don't I just make up
questions for this column? Hmm
... why not? Let's try it:

Dear Me,
Why don't I just write my own
questions?
— The Bug
Well, Bug, you probably don't
write your own questions because
if you did, your column would
have to be called 'Bugging Myself
or 'I'm Bugged' or something
equally foolish.
Dear The Bug,
Not to sound impious or any
thing, but why are you The Bug?
I mean, what's the origin of the
"Bug Me" name?
— Just Curious
What would you suggest as an
alternative name for the column
— "Just Curious"? I think not.
Besides, it's easier drawing ac
companying graphics for a column
titled "Bug Me" than it would be
to draw graphics for a column
titled "Piss Me Off."
Dear Bug,
How much wood would a wood
chuck chuck if a woodchuck could
chuck wood?
— Charlie
Well, Chuck, let's first take a
closer look at this graceful animal.
The "woodchuck," more often
known as the "groundhog," and
even more commonly known as
Marmota Monax, is a furry crea
ture with a plump body, short legs
and a rather slow wit, prone to
hibernating in the winter — much
like the majority of ousted East
ern Bloc leaders. And the little
suckers cannot chuck wood for
beans, or for any other food for
that matter.
However, the woodchuck is a
close relative of the beaver, an
animal most certainly adept at the

art of wood chucking. Still, how
much wood can a beaver chuck
since a beaver can chuck wood?
The largest tree ever seen felled
by a beaver was 110 feet tall and
five feet, seven inches thick, which
means El Palo Alto, our beloved
mascot The Tree (no offense in
tended to our other beloved mas
cot The Color Dark Red), is by
no means safe from rabid beaver
attacks.
This 11-story tree would have
a volume of approximately 2693
square feet, and, figuring the
average density of pine wood to
be about 0.47 pounds per cubic
foot, a weight of about 1266
pounds. And the beaver responsi

ble for felling this timber was
probably of Hans-and-Franz
proportions, like 72 pounds or so
(Ja, 70 pounds for a beaver is like
300 pounds for a human).
So if a 72-pound beaver can
chuck 1266 pounds of wood, your
average 11-pound woodchuck, if
she were indeed capable of chuck
ing wood, would chuck about 193
pounds of wood, or about 412
cubic feet. Not bad for a rodent.
On the other hand, Chuck, if
you merely wanted to know how
much wood a woodchuck could
carry if a woodchuck could carry
wood, we'd have to compare the
woodchuck to a different animal,

a proportionately much stronger
animal — indeed, perhaps the
strongest animal on earth — the
ant.
And since I (cough) am one, I
should know that an ant can carry
up to 52 times its own weight.
So if our average 11-pound wood
chuck were bitten by a radioactive
ant (obviously gaining the propor
tional strength of an ant), this
fortunate woodchuck would be
quite capable of handily picking
up and juggling both Roseanne
Barr and Oprah Winfrey, even
before they discovered Slim Fast
— in other words, up to 572
pounds.

woodchuck to a different animal,

a proportionately much stronger
animal — indeed, perhaps the
strongest animal on earth — the
ant.
And since I (cough) am one, I
should know that an ant can carry
up to 52 times its own weight.
So if our average 11-pound wood
chuck were bitten by a radioactive
ant (obviously gaining the propor
tional strength of an ant), this
fortunate woodchuck would be
quite capable of handily picking
up and juggling both Roseanne
Barr and Oprah Winfrey, even
before they discovered Slim Fast
— in other words, up to 572
pounds.

Dear Bug,
It must be pretty rough picking
good questions out of all the ones
you receive each week. Why don't
you just make up your own ques
tions and answer them?
— Needle in the Haystack
"Pretty rough?" Actually it's
more than "pretty rough" to find
good questions. In fact, Needle,
finding good questions is almost
harder than, say, fitting a camel
through your eye, or maybe
(gasp!) even harder than getting
into Green Library without a pass
port.
That's why I have an account
on LOTS at Macbeth. Send your
pressing inquiries about love,
money, future, the love of your
future money (and good luck de
veloping that kind of love consid
ering your hefty Stanford loan)

to B.BUG-ME, or else write to
me care of The Stanford Daily,
Storke Publications Building,
Stanford, CA 94305.
But back to your question,
Needle. Why don't I just make up
questions for this column? Hmm
... why not? Let's try it:

Dear Me,
Why don't I just write my own
questions?
— The Bug
Well, Bug, you probably don't
write your own questions because
if you did, your column would
have to be called 'Bugging Myself
or 'I'm Bugged' or something
equally foolish.
Dear The Bug,
Not to sound impious or any
thing, but why are you The Bug?
I mean, what's the origin of the
"Bug Me" name?
— Just Curious
What would you suggest as an
alternative name for the column
— "Just Curious"? I think not.
Besides, it's easier drawing ac
companying graphics for a column
titled "Bug Me" than it would be
to draw graphics for a column
titled "Piss Me Off."
Dear Bug,
How much wood would a wood
chuck chuck if a woodchuck could
chuck wood?
— Charlie
Well, Chuck, let's first take a
closer look at this graceful animal.
The "woodchuck," more often
known as the "groundhog," and
even more commonly known as
Marmota Monax, is a furry crea
ture with a plump body, short legs
and a rather slow wit, prone to
hibernating in the winter — much
like the majority of ousted East
ern Bloc leaders. And the little
suckers cannot chuck wood for
beans, or for any other food for
that matter.
However, the woodchuck is a
close relative of the beaver, an
animal most certainly adept at the

art of wood chucking. Still, how
much wood can a beaver chuck
since a beaver can chuck wood?
The largest tree ever seen felled
by a beaver was 110 feet tall and
five feet, seven inches thick, which
means El Palo Alto, our beloved
mascot The Tree (no offense in
tended to our other beloved mas
cot The Color Dark Red), is by
no means safe from rabid beaver
attacks.
This 11-story tree would have
a volume of approximately 2693
square feet, and, figuring the
average density of pine wood to
be about 0.47 pounds per cubic
foot, a weight of about 1266
pounds. And the beaver responsi

ble for felling this timber was
probably of Hans-and-Franz
proportions, like 72 pounds or so
(Ja, 70 pounds for a beaver is like
300 pounds for a human).
So if a 72-pound beaver can
chuck 1266 pounds of wood, your
average 11-pound woodchuck, if
she were indeed capable of chuck
ing wood, would chuck about 193
pounds of wood, or about 412
cubic feet. Not bad for a rodent.
On the other hand, Chuck, if
you merely wanted to know how
much wood a woodchuck could
carry if a woodchuck could carry
wood, we'd have to compare the
woodchuck to a different animal,

a proportionately much stronger
animal — indeed, perhaps the
strongest animal on earth — the
ant.
And since I (cough) am one, I
should know that an ant can carry
up to 52 times its own weight.
So if our average 11-pound wood
chuck were bitten by a radioactive
ant (obviously gaining the propor
tional strength of an ant), this
fortunate woodchuck would be
quite capable of handily picking
up and juggling both Roseanne
Barr and Oprah Winfrey, even
before they discovered Slim Fast
— in other words, up to 572
pounds.
