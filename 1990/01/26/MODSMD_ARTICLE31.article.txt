## Cardinal rolls over 'Cats, 92-69 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
For the first time since early in the
1986-87 season, Stanford took to the
court without the services of Ail-
American Jennifer Azzi. The Cardinal's
star guard was kept out of action last
night by a sprained ankle sustained in
practice Monday.^
Though the injury stopped Azzi, it
could not slow down Stanford as Katy
Steding led all scorers with 21 points
and Sonja Henning ran the Cardinal
offense to perfection in a 92-69 win over
Arizona. Henning tied a career high
with 12 assists and did not commit a
single turnover in 34 minutes.

Stanford extended its best start ever
to 17-0, 7-0 in Pacific 10 Conference
play. The Wildcats slipped under the
.500 mark at 8-9, 1-5 in conference
games.
"Katy had 21 points, eight rebounds,
four assists and three steals, and I see
it as an average game for her," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "It's be
coming so that it is expected.
"I'm surprised when she misses,"
VanDerveer added.
The Cardinal got another strong game
from Trisha Stevens, who had scored
78 points in the last three games en
tering last night's action. Stevens
finished with 20 on a torrid 10-of-13
shooting performance.
Stevens scored eight of Stanford's
first 25 points as the Cardinal could
only manage a one point lead, 25-24,
at the 8:10 mark of the first half.
Stevens acknowledged the team came
out a bit sluggish after recording an
other victory over a top-10 team Tues
day night.
"After the Tennessee game, we came
off kind of slow," Stevens said. "After

Washington, it was the same against
Washington State. We were really up
for Long Beach State (Tuesday)."
Stevens added the Cardinal will have
to avoid letdowns after big games in
the future, but noted it was the team's
fourth game in seven days and people
may have simply been a bit tired.
VanDerveer echoed a similar theme.
"I thought we looked a little tired at
times," she said. "But we got some
people more experience." Martha Ric
hards, Chris MacMurdo and Molly
Goodenbour all saw over 10 minutes of
action. Goodenbour was particularly im
pressive, picking up six assists with
some deft passing. Like Henning, she
did not turn the ball over.
With 7:11 left in the opening stanza,
VanDerveer called for a timeout and
her pep talk got Stanford to shake off
its lackadaisical start. The Cardinal
responded with 14 unanswered points,
including six from Val Whiting, who
had another sensational game. W T hiting
scored 18 points, making eight of 10
from the field, grabbed six rebounds

and blocked two shots. She also recorded
three assists and three steals.
Arizona made it a 12-point game, 45-
33, at halftime. The Wildcats opened
the second half with four straight and
the lead was trimmed to eight. Stanford
responded with a 16-7 margin over the
next five minutes.
That opened the Cardinal's edge to
61-44 and the Wildcats could not pull
within 17 the rest of the way.
"The ball went inside a lot," VanDer
veer said of Stanford's success in the
low post. "As far as I was concerned,
it was same old, same old."
Said Stevens: "People have to concen
trate on our perimeter players, that al
lows us to go one-on-one inside."
Timi Brown was the top scorer for
Arizona with 14 points. Teammates
Brenda Frese and Julie Meyer managed
10 apiece.
Card notes
Stevens exited the game with eight
minutes to play and things well in control.
She probably would have remained in there
a bit longer had anyone realized she now
has 999 career points.
Overall, the Cardinal shot .633 from the
field and .875 from the line. Stanford man
aged 34 assists against only 10 turnovers.
Stanford's busy period will come to an end
with the Arizona State game. The Cardinal
will have six days off before its game next
Saturday at California. Azzi should be ready
to go by then.
