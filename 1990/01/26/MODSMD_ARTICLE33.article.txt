Men playing with boys.
. so carefully and
cogentfy describe the dominance of the
Stanford men's volleyball team as it
prepares to compete in the first official
competition of the season at the 26th
Annual UCSB/Michelob Light Collegiate
Invitational Tournament, to be held today
and tomorrow.
Stanford has coasted through a flaw
less preseason, during which it has swept
past highly-touted Hawaii in four straight
matches with four different starting
lineups, upset defending NCAA champion
UCLA, publicly humiliated the Aggies of
UC-Davis and cruised past a stalwart
alumni squad. Now, the No. 1-ranked
Cardinal, officially 0-0 on the season, will
likely be the target of many a vengeful
team at the well-represented tourney.

In addition to traditional powerhouses
UCLA, Hawaii and Pepperdine, several
other contenders may occupy the atten
tions of Stanford coaches. Manitoba, a
team from Canada, previously won the
UCSB tournament and,< not surprisingly,
received the number-one seeding in its
individual preliminary pool. Most wor
risome about Mantioba, Cardinal Asst.
Coach Reuben Nieves said, is that Stan
ford "knows nothing about them."
UCSB, which is ranked ninth nation
ally by Volleyball Monthly and will be
backed by the home crowd, and BYU, a
team that the magazine noted as an up
and-coming power, will also be in attend
ance.
"This has always been a real strong
tournament," Nieves said. "It's a golden
opportunity because it gives us a chance
to get a look at everybody."
The complete tournament will feature
a starting field of 24, which has been

divided into six separate pools of four.
Each team will begin by playing its pool
opponents in a two-out-of-three match
format. The first- and second-place fin
ishers in each particular pool will advance
to the winners' brackets and will compete
with other pool victors for the champi
onship. Every squad will play eight
matches, regardless of record.
Stanford, seeded first in their pool, has
been slated to play Chico State in its
first match today.
While much has been made of the
team's top ranking, the coaching staff
has been careful to downplay its signif
icance. "I think the tendency is to make
being ranked number one a bigger deal
[than it should be]," Nieves said. "There
are a lot more important things than
whether we are ranked number one, such
as sticking to the plan and not overplay
ing a guy during this tournament."
Attributable partly to the effects of

intensive weight training the team has
recently initiated, Nieves observes that
the players have "struggled a little in
practice and haven't been as smooth or
consistent the past week."
Such a concession, nevertheless, should
offer little comfort to opposing teams be
cause of the overwhelming depth of the
Cardinal squad, a subject of which even
the coaches are quite candid. "I'm not
sure if any team can match our depth
to the 15th and 16th players," Nieves
said.
Given the exhausting schedule of the
tourney (eight matches in two days), the
Cardinal will no doubt showcase its stellar
group of reserves. Careful attention may
be paid to Ryan Moos, a hitter who lately
has been the first player off the bench,
middle blocker John Bezmalinovic, who
has played admirably in an auxiliary role,
