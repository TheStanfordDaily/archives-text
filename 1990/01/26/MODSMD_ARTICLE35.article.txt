# Keefe stars but Cardinal falls, 68-61

TUCSON, Ariz. — Oklahoma couldn't
do it. UNLV couldn't do it. UCLA
couldn't do it. And Stanford couldn't
do it, but they sure tried.
None of those teams have been able
to beat Arizona in McKale Center, and
with a 68-61 win over the Cardinal last
night, the Wildcats ran their home win
ning streak to 42 straight games, the
longest in the nation.

Poor shooting and creative officiating
got Stanford down 20 points early and
while a big rally moved Stanford to
within one, it was not enough to dig
the Cardinal out of the hole.
Stanford fell to 12-4 overall, 4-3 in
the Pacific 10 Conference going into
tomorrow's game at Arizona Slate. Ar
izona moved into third place in the con
ference at 12-3 overall, 6-3 in league
games.

Stanford's top scorer and rebounder,
Adam Keefe, picked up three fouls of
dubious merit in the first 4:04 of the
game and sat out the rest of the first
half. Meanwhile Stanford made only
eight of the team's first 25 shots and
was whistled for eight fouls to Arizona's
one in the first 15 minutes.
The capacity crowd of 13,619 was
louder than any Stanford has faced all
year, and with Keefe out, the youthful
visitors appeared flustered.
The Cardinal trailed by 20 at 38-18
with 2:14 remaining in the first half,
but a 7-2 rally cut it to 40-25 at the
half. Arizona's 6-foot-11, 243-pound cen
ter Sean Rooks drew the fouls on Keefe
and scored 15 points before intermis
sion.
"Arizona came out there very aggres
sive," Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "Obviously, the crowd was
very aggressive and very loud. We looked

a little young out there, didn't make
the plays. . . . And we didn't have Keefe
in there as the go-to guy."
Stanford continued the rally by scor
ing 15 of the second half's first 17
points, cutting it to 42-40. Keefe scored
eight in the run, including six in the
first 2:08 of the half. Keefe finished
with 24 points in 24 minutes on 10-of-13
shooting.
The Wildcats responded to the chal
lenge as guard Matt Muehlebach scored
10 second-half points. The Cardinal was
within one at 46-45 after a Kenny Am
mann three-pointer but never caught
Arizona after the horrible start.
"I'm real proud of the kids," Mont
gomery said. "We hung in there.. . . It's
a tough place to play."
Ammann finished with nine for the
Cardinal and Andrew Vlahov and John
Patrick chipped in seven each. Redshirt
freshman Paul Garrett played impres
sively as well.
Montgomery refused to comment on
the officiating, as did Keefe, but felt
the early calls took his team out of the
game. "Obviously you're going to be a

more confident basketball team with
your best player in there," Montgomery
said. "Obviously it hurt us in the first
half.
"These kids have made a lot of prog
ress and were going to win some more
games."
Keefe agreed, saying, "We've proven
ourselves by playing with some pretty
good teams this year. You get to a point
where you gotta stop saying, 'We can
play with these teams,' and just beat
them. But just for us to fight back like
that is a lift — that we didn't crumble."

Despite sitting out most of the first half, sophomore sensation Adam Keefe poured
in 24 points in 24 minutes on 10-of-13 shooting. Keefe's efforts and an amazing
scoring run early in the second half were not enough, however, as No. 19 Arizona
won the contest, 68-61.
