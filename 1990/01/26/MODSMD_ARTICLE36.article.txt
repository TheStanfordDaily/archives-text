# Men's Basketball at Arizona State
## 
### 
TOMORROW - Live on KZSU (90.1 FM) and KCBS (740 AM) with a 6:30 p.m. (PST)
tip-off in the University Activities Center.
RECORDS — Stanford (12-4, 4-3 in Pac-10 play, ranked 34th nationally with nine votes
in the AP poll), Arizona State (9-8, 2-6).
INJURIES — Arizona State guard Matt Anderson injured his knee against Washington
Jan. 6. He will likely not play tomorrow.
SERIES — Arizona State has won 14 to the Cardinal's 12 in the series. Last year
Stanford beat the Sun Devils by 29 in Maples and by 15 at the UAC. Anderson scored
21 in Tempe last year in the loss. Stanford has won five of the last six against ASU.
SUN DEVIL UPDATE — Arizona State lost a heartbreaker, 68 66, to California in double
overtime last night. Alex Austin is the big threat, averaging 19.3 points and 7.3
rebounds per game. Younger brother Isaac Austin is scoring 13.4 points and pulling
down 5.7 rebounds per outing. Isaac Austin leads the team with 12 dunks, an official
statistic on the ASU press release.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford struggled with Adam Keefe out in the first half last night,
but came back to give Arizona a big fight last night. Keefe had 20 second-half points,
but Stanford fell 68-61.
KEYS TO VICTORY — The Devils are shooting only 44 8 percent from the field, so if
Stanford plays the good defense that has been a constant this year, ASU's numbers
should be even lower. If Alex Austin doesn't go completely crazy — he's had 31
points twice so far this year — the Cardinal has a good shot at Pac-10 road win
number two.
