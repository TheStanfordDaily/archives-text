# Power, pitching, pride should propel Cardinal back to top
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Ask Paul Carey, Stanford's All-
Everything rightfielder, why he
didn't turn pro after last season.
You'll get a simple answer.
"I feel we have a chance to win
the NCAA's this year," Carey said.
"I came back to win."
He came to the right place be
cause the 1990 Stanford baseball
team, ranked fourth in the coun
try, has all the ingredients of a
championship club. Then again,
so did last year's squad, which
had, by Stanford standards, a dis
mal season.
Something has changed,
though. After an offseason spent
wondering about 1989's mistakes,
the team's attitude is markedly
different. "Everyone's into it a
little more," junior pitcher Mike
Mussina said. "We're having more
8 o'clock meetings, doing more
running . .
"Practice has been more in
tense, but in a fun way," Carey
said. "We're not panicking."
Pitcher Stan Spencer agreed.
"It's been a lot more intense; the
team's attitude is a lot better,"
Spencer said. "We're looking
around and saying we're not going
to go through the motions. Last
year we did just go through the
motions. We didn't have much life
in us."
The life is there this year, along
with loads of talent.
Especially on the pitching staff.
If the Cardinal is going to fly in
1990, it will do so on the twin
right wings of Mussina and Spen
cer, whom Marquess calls "two of
the finest starters in college base
ball." Both are expected to be
picked in the first two rounds of
the June amateur draft.
Mussina, who has been named
a preseason first-team Ail-
American by several publications,
is fully recovered from the
strained tendon in his pitching el
bow, which sidelined him for most
of 1989. After spending the sum
mer lifting weights, he started

throwing again in November and
was back at full strength "about
a week later. I had no problem
with it," Mussina said. "Once I
tested it, I put all doubts aside."
Marquess thinks Mussina is not
only back to his early 1989 form
— he struck out 55 and walked
four in the 46 innings he pitched
— but is even better. "He's got a
little more velocity than he did
before the injury," Marquess said.
"I just think he's a little rusty.
"I would expect it to take him
maybe three four weeks to get
into top shape, because he hasn't
pitched in a long time competi
tively," Marquess said.
"Healthwise, he's proved to him
self and everyone else that he's
sound. He hasn't even had an
ache."
Mussina isn't worried about the
long layoff from competition. "I
might be rusty, but I'm not
worried about the games," he
said. "It's just a matter of being
physically able to pitch.
"I won't be able to go long yet
— it's too early. But when the
time comes, I'll be ready."
So will Spencer, who had an
outstanding fall campaign. "This
is as good as I've seen him pitch,"
Marquess said. "He's really in
good shape, he's throwing harder,
(he's got) great location, his break
ing ball is sharper. He's really de
veloped a good change.
"Stan's really a much better
pitcher now than he was last year
at this time," Marquess contin
ued. "And he was a good pitcher
last year."
Spencer thinks that spending
the summer without pitching —
for the first time in five years —
helped improve his game. "I think
I've picked up a few miles per
hour on my fastball, and I've im
proved my breaking ball," Spencer
said. "I'm getting it over for
strikes more. Those are the two
major reasons [I'm pitching
well]."
The third starting spot is up
for grabs. "There are a number
of guys who can fill that spot,"

Marquess said. Freshmen Jamie
Cepeda and Brian Sackinsky, both
righthanders, seem to have the
inside track, but it's too early to
tell. "We don't really have to make
that decision for about three or
four weeks," Marquess said. "The
way that we'll do it early is no
one will go nine innings. . . . We're
gonna have six or eight pitchers
get quite a bit of work."
Most of those pitchers will end
up in the bullpen with junior Scott
Weiss, who took over the top relief

spot last year when now-departed
Steve Chitren moved to the start
ing rotation. "We started [Scott]
occasionally last year, but we'd
like to use him strictly out of the
bullpen [this year] because of the
experience he gives us," Marquess
said.
Sackinsky may also come out
of the pen, but Marquess added,
"We're just experimenting. The
trouble with freshmen is not
everybody can come out of the
bullpen, so we'll experiment a

little and see if those guys can."
The team's pitching talent ob
viously runs deep. "The key to
this year is hitting," Carey said.
"Our pitchers aren't going to give
up any runs."
Leading the way in the hitting
department is pre-season Ail-
American Carey, who will break
Stanford records for career
homers, hits, doubles and RBI if
he has even an average season.
As usual, Carey will see lots of
breaking balls at the plate, but
he said, "I've come to expect off
speed stuff."
Opposing pitchers will most
likely pitch around the senior
rightfielder, unless the batter be
hind him proves to be a threat
as well. "When Paul comes to the
plate, [pitchers] bear down more,"
Marquess said. "The fastball has
a little bit extra, the breaking ball
has a little more snap, and that's
because everyone knows him and
respects him. That's why it's so
important for us to have some
body behind him that can protect
him."
Right now that man is sopho
more firstbaseman David
McCarty. "McCarty's really come
of age," Marquess said. "He's got
some power, he doesn't strike out
a lot normally, and I think he's

going to make it so they can't
pitch around Paul. . . . Initially
they will be very careful of Paul,
until McCarty proves he's a good
hitter and can hurt you."
Sophomore shortstop Roger
Burnett will also be expected to
provide some power. Burnett took
over as the starter at short in
March last year and went on to
finish second on the team in
homers, with six, and batting,
with a .308 average. The other
infield starters will be senior
thirdbaseman Tim Griffin (who
will most likely split time with
sophomore designated hitter Da
vid Holbrook), junior Troy Paul
sen, who makes the switch from
left field to second, and sopho
more catcher Troy Tall man.
Tallman struggled offensively
last season, but is so outstanding
behind the plate that Marquess
said, "If he hits .250, that'll be a
good year."
Two new starters join Carey in
the outfield. In left, which Mar
quess calls the team's "most com
petitive spot," junior Ryan Turner
gets the starting nod over Mike
Eicher and Steve Solomon, but
that may change. "That's just a
dogfight," Marquess said.


James Rucker — Daily file
Junior pitcher Stan Spencer will open the Cardinal's 1990 campaign
on the mound as the Cardinal meets Santa Clara.
Center field belongs to Jeff
Hammonds, the team's most
highly touted freshman. "He's a
superstar," Carey said. "He
should make a big impact. He's
got all the tools."
Not the least of those tools is
great speed, which is why Ham
monds will bat at the top of the

order. "He's got a rare combina
tion — he's got speed, he's got
some power," Marquess said.
"He's very polished for such a
young player. ... I think we're
very fortunate to have a player
of his ability be able to make the
adjustment [to college baseball] so
quickly."
With speed, power, pitching and
intensity on its side, 1990 could
prove to be quite a pleasant season
for the Cardinal.

viously runs deep. "The key to
this year is hitting," Carey said.
"Our pitchers aren't going to give
up any runs."
Leading the way in the hitting
department is pre-season Ail-
American Carey, who will break
Stanford records for career
homers, hits, doubles and RBI if
he has even an average season.
As usual, Carey will see lots of
breaking balls at the plate, but
he said, "I've come to expect off
speed stuff."
Opposing pitchers will most
likely pitch around the senior
rightfielder, unless the batter be
hind him proves to be a threat
as well. "When Paul comes to the
plate, [pitchers] bear down more,"
Marquess said. "The fastball has
a little bit extra, the breaking ball
has a little more snap, and that's
because everyone knows him and
respects him. That's why it's so
important for us to have some
body behind him that can protect
him."
Right now that man is sopho
more firstbaseman David
McCarty. "McCarty's really come
of age," Marquess said. "He's got
some power, he doesn't strike out
a lot normally, and I think he's

going to make it so they can't
pitch around Paul. . . . Initially
they will be very careful of Paul,
until McCarty proves he's a good
hitter and can hurt you."
Sophomore shortstop Roger
Burnett will also be expected to
provide some power. Burnett took
over as the starter at short in
March last year and went on to
finish second on the team in
homers, with six, and batting,
with a .308 average. The other
infield starters will be senior
thirdbaseman Tim Griffin (who
will most likely split time with
sophomore designated hitter Da
vid Holbrook), junior Troy Paul
sen, who makes the switch from
left field to second, and sopho
more catcher Troy Tall man.
Tallman struggled offensively
last season, but is so outstanding
behind the plate that Marquess
said, "If he hits .250, that'll be a
good year."
Two new starters join Carey in
the outfield. In left, which Mar
quess calls the team's "most com
petitive spot," junior Ryan Turner
gets the starting nod over Mike
Eicher and Steve Solomon, but
that may change. "That's just a
dogfight," Marquess said.


James Rucker — Daily file
Junior pitcher Stan Spencer will open the Cardinal's 1990 campaign
on the mound as the Cardinal meets Santa Clara.
Center field belongs to Jeff
Hammonds, the team's most
highly touted freshman. "He's a
superstar," Carey said. "He
should make a big impact. He's
got all the tools."
Not the least of those tools is
great speed, which is why Ham
monds will bat at the top of the

order. "He's got a rare combina
tion — he's got speed, he's got
some power," Marquess said.
"He's very polished for such a
young player. ... I think we're
very fortunate to have a player
of his ability be able to make the
adjustment [to college baseball] so
quickly."
With speed, power, pitching and
intensity on its side, 1990 could
prove to be quite a pleasant season
for the Cardinal.
Ask Paul Carey, Stanford's All-
Everything rightfielder, why he
didn't turn pro after last season.
You'll get a simple answer.
"I feel we have a chance to win
the NCAA's this year," Carey said.
"I came back to win."
He came to the right place be
cause the 1990 Stanford baseball
team, ranked fourth in the coun
try, has all the ingredients of a
championship club. Then again,
so did last year's squad, which
had, by Stanford standards, a dis
mal season.
Something has changed,
though. After an offseason spent
wondering about 1989's mistakes,
the team's attitude is markedly
different. "Everyone's into it a
little more," junior pitcher Mike
Mussina said. "We're having more
8 o'clock meetings, doing more
running . .
"Practice has been more in
tense, but in a fun way," Carey
said. "We're not panicking."
Pitcher Stan Spencer agreed.
"It's been a lot more intense; the
team's attitude is a lot better,"
Spencer said. "We're looking
around and saying we're not going
to go through the motions. Last
year we did just go through the
motions. We didn't have much life
in us."
The life is there this year, along
with loads of talent.
Especially on the pitching staff.
If the Cardinal is going to fly in
1990, it will do so on the twin
right wings of Mussina and Spen
cer, whom Marquess calls "two of
the finest starters in college base
ball." Both are expected to be
picked in the first two rounds of
the June amateur draft.
Mussina, who has been named
a preseason first-team Ail-
American by several publications,
is fully recovered from the
strained tendon in his pitching el
bow, which sidelined him for most
of 1989. After spending the sum
mer lifting weights, he started

throwing again in November and
was back at full strength "about
a week later. I had no problem
with it," Mussina said. "Once I
tested it, I put all doubts aside."
Marquess thinks Mussina is not
only back to his early 1989 form
— he struck out 55 and walked
four in the 46 innings he pitched
— but is even better. "He's got a
little more velocity than he did
before the injury," Marquess said.
"I just think he's a little rusty.
"I would expect it to take him
maybe three four weeks to get
into top shape, because he hasn't
pitched in a long time competi
tively," Marquess said.
"Healthwise, he's proved to him
self and everyone else that he's
sound. He hasn't even had an
ache."
Mussina isn't worried about the
long layoff from competition. "I
might be rusty, but I'm not
worried about the games," he
said. "It's just a matter of being
physically able to pitch.
"I won't be able to go long yet
— it's too early. But when the
time comes, I'll be ready."
So will Spencer, who had an
outstanding fall campaign. "This
is as good as I've seen him pitch,"
Marquess said. "He's really in
good shape, he's throwing harder,
(he's got) great location, his break
ing ball is sharper. He's really de
veloped a good change.
"Stan's really a much better
pitcher now than he was last year
at this time," Marquess contin
ued. "And he was a good pitcher
last year."
Spencer thinks that spending
the summer without pitching —
for the first time in five years —
helped improve his game. "I think
I've picked up a few miles per
hour on my fastball, and I've im
proved my breaking ball," Spencer
said. "I'm getting it over for
strikes more. Those are the two
major reasons [I'm pitching
well]."
The third starting spot is up
for grabs. "There are a number
of guys who can fill that spot,"

Marquess said. Freshmen Jamie
Cepeda and Brian Sackinsky, both
righthanders, seem to have the
inside track, but it's too early to
tell. "We don't really have to make
that decision for about three or
four weeks," Marquess said. "The
way that we'll do it early is no
one will go nine innings. . . . We're
gonna have six or eight pitchers
get quite a bit of work."
Most of those pitchers will end
up in the bullpen with junior Scott
Weiss, who took over the top relief

spot last year when now-departed
Steve Chitren moved to the start
ing rotation. "We started [Scott]
occasionally last year, but we'd
like to use him strictly out of the
bullpen [this year] because of the
experience he gives us," Marquess
said.
Sackinsky may also come out
of the pen, but Marquess added,
"We're just experimenting. The
trouble with freshmen is not
everybody can come out of the
bullpen, so we'll experiment a

little and see if those guys can."
The team's pitching talent ob
viously runs deep. "The key to
this year is hitting," Carey said.
"Our pitchers aren't going to give
up any runs."
Leading the way in the hitting
department is pre-season Ail-

he has even an average season.

throwing again in November and
was back at full strength "about
a week later. I had no problem
with it," Mussina said. "Once I
tested it, I put all doubts aside."
Marquess thinks Mussina is not
only back to his early 1989 form
— he struck out 55 and walked
four in the 46 innings he pitched
— but is even better. "He's got a
little more velocity than he did
before the injury," Marquess said.
"I just think he's a little rusty.
"I would expect it to take him
maybe three four weeks to get
into top shape, because he hasn't
pitched in a long time competi
tively," Marquess said.
"Healthwise, he's proved to him
self and everyone else that he's
sound. He hasn't even had an
ache."
Mussina isn't worried about the
long layoff from competition. "I
might be rusty, but I'm not
worried about the games," he
said. "It's just a matter of being
physically able to pitch.
"I won't be able to go long yet
— it's too early. But when the
time comes, I'll be ready."
So will Spencer, who had an
outstanding fall campaign. "This
is as good as I've seen him pitch,"
Marquess said. "He's really in
good shape, he's throwing harder,
(he's got) great location, his break
ing ball is sharper. He's really de
veloped a good change.
"Stan's really a much better
pitcher now than he was last year
at this time," Marquess contin
ued. "And he was a good pitcher
last year."
Spencer thinks that spending
the summer without pitching —
for the first time in five years —
helped improve his game. "I think
I've picked up a few miles per
hour on my fastball, and I've im
proved my breaking ball," Spencer
said. "I'm getting it over for
strikes more. Those are the two
major reasons [I'm pitching
well]."
The third starting spot is up
for grabs. "There are a number
of guys who can fill that spot,"

Marquess said. Freshmen Jamie
Cepeda and Brian Sackinsky, both
righthanders, seem to have the
inside track, but it's too early to
tell. "We don't really have to make
that decision for about three or
four weeks," Marquess said. "The
way that we'll do it early is no
one will go nine innings. . . . We're
gonna have six or eight pitchers
get quite a bit of work."
Most of those pitchers will end
up in the bullpen with junior Scott
Weiss, who took over the top relief

spot last year when now-departed
Steve Chitren moved to the start
ing rotation. "We started [Scott]
occasionally last year, but we'd
like to use him strictly out of the
bullpen [this year] because of the
experience he gives us," Marquess
said.
Sackinsky may also come out
of the pen, but Marquess added,
"We're just experimenting. The
trouble with freshmen is not
everybody can come out of the
bullpen, so we'll experiment a

little and see if those guys can."
The team's pitching talent ob
viously runs deep. "The key to
this year is hitting," Carey said.
"Our pitchers aren't going to give
up any runs."
Leading the way in the hitting
department is pre-season Ail-
American Carey, who will break
Stanford records for career
homers, hits, doubles and RBI if
he has even an average season.
As usual, Carey will see lots of
breaking balls at the plate, but
he said, "I've come to expect off
speed stuff."
Opposing pitchers will most
likely pitch around the senior
rightfielder, unless the batter be
hind him proves to be a threat
as well. "When Paul comes to the
plate, [pitchers] bear down more,"
Marquess said. "The fastball has
a little bit extra, the breaking ball
has a little more snap, and that's
because everyone knows him and
respects him. That's why it's so
important for us to have some
body behind him that can protect
him."
Right now that man is sopho
more firstbaseman David
McCarty. "McCarty's really come
of age," Marquess said. "He's got
some power, he doesn't strike out
a lot normally, and I think he's

going to make it so they can't
pitch around Paul. . . . Initially
they will be very careful of Paul,
until McCarty proves he's a good
hitter and can hurt you."
Sophomore shortstop Roger
Burnett will also be expected to
provide some power. Burnett took
over as the starter at short in
March last year and went on to
finish second on the team in
homers, with six, and batting,
with a .308 average. The other
infield starters will be senior
thirdbaseman Tim Griffin (who
will most likely split time with
sophomore designated hitter Da
vid Holbrook), junior Troy Paul
sen, who makes the switch from
left field to second, and sopho
more catcher Troy Tall man.
Tallman struggled offensively
last season, but is so outstanding
behind the plate that Marquess
said, "If he hits .250, that'll be a
good year."
Two new starters join Carey in
the outfield. In left, which Mar
quess calls the team's "most com
petitive spot," junior Ryan Turner
gets the starting nod over Mike
Eicher and Steve Solomon, but
that may change. "That's just a
dogfight," Marquess said.


James Rucker — Daily file
Junior pitcher Stan Spencer will open the Cardinal's 1990 campaign
on the mound as the Cardinal meets Santa Clara.
Center field belongs to Jeff
Hammonds, the team's most
highly touted freshman. "He's a
superstar," Carey said. "He
should make a big impact. He's
got all the tools."
Not the least of those tools is
great speed, which is why Ham
monds will bat at the top of the

order. "He's got a rare combina
tion — he's got speed, he's got
some power," Marquess said.
"He's very polished for such a
young player. ... I think we're
very fortunate to have a player
of his ability be able to make the
adjustment [to college baseball] so
quickly."
With speed, power, pitching and
intensity on its side, 1990 could
prove to be quite a pleasant season
for the Cardinal.
