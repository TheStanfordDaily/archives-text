# Baseball vs. Santa Clara
## 
### 
THIS WEEKEND — Today at Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium, 2:30 p.m.,
and Sunday at Sunken Diamond, 11:30 a.m. The Cardinal plays its annual
Alumni game Saturday at noon at Sunken Diamond
RECORDS — This is the first game of the year for both teams Stanford
is ranked fourth in two national preseason polls and third in another
BRONCO UPDATE — The Broncos are led by junior shortstop Ed Giovanola,
who was a Sporting News first-team All-America pick last year. Giovanola
led the team in batting average (.378), runs (76) and steals (23) in 1989.
Junior righthander Vince Fultz, one of nine Bronco pitchers returning
from last year's 40-22 team, will probably start on the mound.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Junior Stan Spencer will get the start on the hill,
but several pitchers will probably see action. Starters are back at six
other positions, with freshman Jeff Hammonds and junior Ryan Turner
making their first starts in the outfield.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Santa Clara's strength is its pitching, which makes
sense when you consider that the team lost all its power hitters. To win,
the Cardinal should keep Giovanola off the basepaths and avoid the low
scoring that has plagued the team in its last two season openers.
