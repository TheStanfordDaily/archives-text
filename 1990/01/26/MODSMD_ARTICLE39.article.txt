### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
Someone viewing the score of Stanford's
59-0 wrestling victory over Fullerton State
might have thought the Titans did not show
up. Well, most of them didn't. Literally.
Fullerton State sent three wrestlers onto
the mat last night at Burnham Pavilion due
to a scheduling conflict. The Titans (6-9)
thought that they had enough depth to
schedule two meets on the same night. How
ever, injuries and academic eligibility problems
depleted the squad.
The Cardinal (8-2) was obviously disap
pointed.
Steve Buddie (177), who won by a technical
fall, said, "They got a little cocky. Their pro
gram has been improving. They have gotten

some good recruits, and somewhere along the
line the coach thought he could get away with
more than he did and he used us along the
way."
Buddie did some using himself, as he took
only 3:31 to dispose of the Titans' Dwayne
Bush. He was pleased with the outcome, but

not satisfied. "I wanted the pin just to make
our coach a little happier," he said.
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel, who gave
away free passes to the next home meet as a
result of the circumstances, controlled his
feelings. Horpel said, "Basically it was just
really irresponsible for the Fullerton coach
(Dan Lewis) to do what he did."
In the 118-pound match, Dave Nowick
pinned Lam Duong with 6:22 expired. Nowick
used his up-tempo style to fatigue Duong. It
was Nowick's first win by fall of the season.
The only other contest of the meet featured
Stanford's James Dinette (142) against Tony
Crisci of Fullerton State. Using a ferocious
side arm-bar, Dinette pinned Crisci with 4:33
gone in the match.
Dinette said, "I wanted to really get on top
and establish dominance right away. It seemed
to work."
