# Senate upholds visa bill veto
## Chinese students fear Bush may use them as bargaining chip 
### Wendie Schneider Staff writer With wire reports 
The year of the horse begins this
weekend on a note of profound disap
pointment for Chinese students at
Stanford and other U.S. universities,
following the Senate's vote to uphold
President Bush's veto of a bill to extend
their visas.
The Senate yesterday voted 62-37,
falling five votes short of the two-thirds
majority required to override. Last No
vember Bush vetoed the Pelosi bill,
which would have lifted the home
country return requirement for Chinese
students on J-l visas.
The majority of Chinese students at
Stanford hold J-l visas, which require
them to return to China for two years
after finishing their studies.
When Bush vetoed the bill, he ordered
government agencies to adopt what are
essentially the same safeguards. The
veto was an effort to preserve executive
branch foreign policy prerogatives, he
said, and to keep open the door for

future student and cultural exchanges.
"I will not break faith with Chinese
students here. . . . They were safe then,
and they are safe now, and they will
be safe in the future," Bush told a White
House news conference Wednesday.
To Chinese students at Stanford, the
president's assurances ring hollow in
light of recent revelations about the two
missions to Beijing by national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft.
Chinese students fear the administra
tive directive replacing the Pelosi bill
will be used as a bargaining chip in
Bush's relations with Chinese leaders.
Unlike a law, a directive can be changed
at any time, they argue.
In the meantime, students are taking
advantage of the benefits offered under
the directive. Within hours after the
Senate vote, Chinese students were com
ing to the International Center office of
the Association of Chinese Students and
Scholars at Stanford to request forms
for changing visa status under the direc
tive.
Xu Guanghan of the association at
tributes this change from the previous

wait-and-see attitude to uncertainty
about how long the president will keep
his word.
Students are also worried about the
effect of the vote on their ability to
carry on pro-democracy activities in the
United States. As long as the threat of
return remains, many students are
hesitant to publicly oppose the Chinese
government.
"It's a great setback for the student
movement," said one graduate student
who requested anonymity. "People will
no longer feel secure."
Underlying student anger at the set
back is the desire to influence U.S. policy
toward China. Students at Stanford ar
gue that maintaining pressure on the
Chinese government is the best way to
influence the outcome of infighting
within the leadership.
In accordance with this aim, students
plan to continue their lobbying efforts
in support of upcoming bills on eco
nomic sanctions. Also, they intend to
support other bills on immigration law
that would provide further protections.
