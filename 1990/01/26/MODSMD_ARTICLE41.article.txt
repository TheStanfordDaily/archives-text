## 
### Amy Howard 
Some of the nation's top gym
nasts will take to the mats to
morrow as Stanford's men's
gymnastics team hosts UC-Santa
Barbara in its first home meet of
the year. Stanford lost only two
roembers to graduation from last
year's team, which reached the
NCAA Championships and
finished fourth overall.
Several squad members are
coming off impressive showings
at last summer's United States
Championships. Case in point is
sbphomore Tim Ryan, who won
the all-around title at age 18. Es
tablishing himself as the nation's
top gymnast, he took the gold
medal on the high bar and placed
second on both the pommel horse

and the parallel bars.
Ryan was accompanied by
senior Conrad Voorsanger, who
came away with a fourth-place all
around finish and a gold on the
parallel bars. Voorsanger is cur
rently ranked second in the na
tion. Senior Charles Loop rounded
out the impressive Cardinal con

tingent on the U.S. National team.
After competing in the World
Championships in West Germany
last October and several other
World Cup meets, the gymnasts
are ready for the collegiate season.
"It's really good to be back,"
Voorsanger said. "The attitude in
the gym is good and everybody is
working hard."
Among those hard workers are
the newest members of the team,
freshmen Jair Lynch, Jeff Bender
and Shawn Adameck. Coach
Sadao Hamada has high expecta
tions for these newcomers, espe
cially Lynch, whose specialties are
the pommel horse and parallel
bars.
"He (Lynch) could win those
two events in any meet in the
country on a good day," Hamada
said.

Rounding out the team are re
turning gymnasts Adam Forman,
Timothy Wang and David Neith
hardt, all of whom have proven
themselves to be tough competi
tors. With this amount of talent
to work with, Hamada character
izes the team as the strongest he
has seen in his 18 years of coach
ing at Stanford.
Hamada has developed a strat
egy that he hopes will lead the
team to victory at both the Pacific
10 Conference and NCAA Cham
pionships. Right now the team is
training "carefully" to avoid inju
ries and focus on individual
performances rather than the
overall team score in the meets.
The gymnasts will compete in
six events: the pommel horse, par
allel bars, high bar, rings, vault
and floor exercise.
