Home sweet home . ..
After traveling to such exotic
places as Boise, Idaho and
Seattle, Washington, the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team
will be competing in the more
familar surroundings of
Burnham Pavilion when it
faces UC-Davis tonight in the
first home meet of the Cardi
nal's season.
In addition to the advantage
of not having to travel and the
support of the home crowd,
"we'll have more confidence at
this meet because we'll be com
peting in more familiar sur
roundings," junior Mprietta
Frey said.
Besides seeking their first
notch in the win column, the
gymnasts are also looking to
show the Stanford fans that
numbers do not tell the whole
story.
"We're a lot better than the
scores indicate," senior Susan
Banta said. "We've been per
forming very solid routines,
but we weren't throwing full
difficulty. We're finally starting
to increase our difficulty, and
the performances won't look
much different, but the scores
will go up."
The lineup for this meet will

look slightly different from
those of the past two meets.
Frey will be competing in her
first meet of the season. She
will join junior Jennifer Bloom,
co-captains Banta and senior
Dina Amoroso and freshmen
Erin McCann and Danielle
Leone on bars. Frey will also
perform exhibition floor and
balance beam.
McCann, Bloom and
Amoroso will again comprise
the all-around team for the
Cardinal, competing in all four
events.
Banta will compete on floor
exercise for the first time this
season. Along with the all
around team, Leone and soph
omore Denise Villars are also
entered.
