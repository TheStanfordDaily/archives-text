# No ordinary freshman
## Diver Kraus has made immediate impact 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
Stanford sports fans have been blessed
with a talented, influential list of freshman
athletes this year. The spikes of volleyball
star Bev Oden, the fakes of soccer standout
Julie Foudy and the massive impact of
football lineman Bob Whitfield all have
impressed Cardinal sports enthusiasts.
Less well-known but just as impressive
is Mark Kraus, one of three freshmen ath
letes who make up the 1989-90 men's diving
team.
"Mark has worked real hard and is
progressing a lot faster than I thought he
would in both the physical and mental ap
proach to diving," Coach Rick Schavone
said. "He has talent, great potential, but
he is still young."
Kraus has been diving since he was seven
years old. In 1988, while attending West
minster High School in Atlanta, he com
peted as a member of the U.S. National
Age Group diving team.
"Usually when we have an Age Group

stud come in, it takes a lot of time to get
them to give up some of the things that
made them successful at that level,"
Schavone said. "He's opening up and doing
that a lot quicker than 1 thought he would
be able to."
Along with classmates Richard Endriss
and Brad Wightman, Kraus has had to
step right into the diving program and try
to make an immediate impact while still
making progress toward his long-term goals
of competing at a senior diving level. As

Diver Mark Kraus has not had much time to adjust to life on the Farm as the freshman has been trying to score
points for the Cardinal against the best in the nation.
