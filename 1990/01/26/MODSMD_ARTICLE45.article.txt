# No ordinary freshman
## Diver Kraus has made immediate impact 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
Stanford sports fans have been blessed
with a talented, influential list of freshman
athletes this year. The spikes of volleyball
star Bev Oden, the fakes of soccer standout
Julie Foudy and the massive impact of
football lineman Bob Whitfield all have
impressed Cardinal sports enthusiasts.
Less well-known but just as impressive
is Mark Kraus, one of three freshmen ath
letes who make up the 1989-90 men's diving
team.
"Mark has worked real hard and is
progressing a lot faster than I thought he
would in both the physical and mental ap
proach to diving," Coach Rick Schavone
said. "He has talent, great potential, but
he is still young."
Kraus has been diving since he was seven
years old. In 1988, while attending West
minster High School in Atlanta, he com
peted as a member of the U.S. National
Age Group diving team.
"Usually when we have an Age Group

stud come in, it takes a lot of time to get
them to give up some of the things that
made them successful at that level,"
Schavone said. "He's opening up and doing
that a lot quicker than 1 thought he would
be able to."
Along with classmates Richard Endriss
and Brad Wightman, Kraus has had to
step right into the diving program and try
to make an immediate impact while still
making progress toward his long-term goals
of competing at a senior diving level. As

the swimming team looks to the
divers in hopes that they can bol
ster the Cardinal team score,
Kraus has to concentrate on con
stantly learning new dives and
perfecting his form.
"It's a little bit rough to jump
into leadership roles as fresh
men," Kraus said. "The swim
team naturally wants us to score
points for them even though we're
just trying to get the feeling of
college diving."
While enjoying his present role
as instructor, Schavone foresees
great things in the future for his
freshmen.
"I could be coaching a junior
who I know I've gotten close to
his physical limits out of him.
Even though they can win Pac-lOs,
I know I've come as far with them
as I basically can," Schavone said.
"Instead, I have miles to go with
these guys. They have the enthu
siasm to take them to the heights
of what I have seen in Stanford
diving."
This season, the NCAA Cham
pionships have created only three
qualifying spots for the entire
Western region. Schavone believes

that his divers, after placing in
the top six at the Pacific 10 Cham
pionships, will be competing for
the third spot at the NCAAs.
"It's not out of my range to
make NCAAs, but it will be
rough," Kraus said.
In the meantime, Kraus and his
teammates will continue to work
on their dives while participating
in dual meets. Arizona will bring
two freshman divers here on Sat
urday, and the Cardinal freshmen
will be able to gauge more ac
curately their progress in compar
ison to other young divers.
"We can't think of our progress
in terms of points," Schavone said.
"We want to stay in the learning
phase as long as possible and then,
at the last second, allow them to
try to perform as well as they

can.

For the record

A Jan. 19 article quoted a
source saying that about $22,000
was needed to pay a lifeguard for
Lake Lagunita. In fact, of the ap
proximately $23,000 budgeted in
1988-89, only $11,000 was spent
on the lifeguard's salary, with the
remainder covering security,
maintenance, trash collection and
other expenses.
