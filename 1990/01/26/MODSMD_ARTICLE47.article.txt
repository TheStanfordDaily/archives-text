# From Edina to Stanford, Heisick has breaststroked to top of class
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
As the defending national cham
pions, the Stanford women's swim
team probably had its pick of high
school seniors from all the swim
ming hotbeds across the country
last year. So naturally one of the
swimmers recruited was a
breaststroker from Edina, Minn.
Minnesota? Where the only rea
son to have a pool is so you can
fill it in the winter to play hockey?
For a swimmer who spent her
early years hating the water?
Sure. Why not? Especially when
that swimmer is Lori Heisick,
who, after only three collegiate
meets, has already shown she is
one of the nation's top breast
strokers.
Heisick and the rest of the top
ranked Cardinal return home this
weekend to meet Arizona State
today and Arizona tomorrow.
Both meets begin at noon at
deGuerre Pool.
"Minnesota is not exactly a
powerhouse for swimming,"
Heisick said. But despite that,
Heisick set the national high
school record in the 100-yard
breaststroke last year and cur
rently. lM£,tb&4ie&t4imes in both
the lOfr 200 breaststrokes on
a team known for being extremely
strong in that stroke.
"Nobody would have guessed
when I was little that I would be
a swimmer," she said. "I just
hated it at first. I just hated the
water."
She learned to like it eventually,
however. "Mom and Dad had me
taking swim lessons at the Red
Cross and they said I could stop

ifl joined the swim team, so that's
what I did," she said. "I've always
been real competitive. I loved the
meets. ... I think that's what kept
me going. . . . The first race I ever
swum at a meet was the 50 breast.
I won it and that's where it took
off, I guess."
Heisick continued to improve
and went from beating girls in
Minnesota to beating the nation's
best. She qualified for the 1988
Olympic Trials and placed third
in the 100-meter breaststroke.
Unfortunately for her, only the
top two in each event made it to
Seoul.
Making it an even tougher pill
to swallow, one of the two swim
mers who beat her was Tracey
McFarlane, a 1988 Texas gradu
ate. McFarlane was born in
Canada but was granted U.S.
citizenship specially by President
Reagan a couple months prior to
the Trials.
"That was kind of harsh,"
Heisick said. "It was hard dealing
with that because it was so close."
Heisick, unlike almost everyone

else who didn't make the Olympic
team, didn't take a break after
the disappointment. "One of my
goals was to get the national high
sch< ol record," she said. "I didn't
take any time off after Trials."
Heisick broke the record and
soon college recruiters were call
ing her all the time. "It was kind
of hard to deal with," she said,
"but it was flattering because it
was nice to have a choice of where
to go to school."
Heisick was leaning toward
Texas because the new Longhorn
coach, Mark Schubert, had been
her coach for some time. "We were
really, really close," Heisick said.
"Everyone in the swimming world
thought I was going to Texas. . . .
Finally somebody asked me, 'This
may sound awful, but where
would you want to be if you could
never swim again?' That's when
I realized that I wanted to be here.
"How could I turn down a place
like this? I'd hate myself the rest
of my life if I did."
Since arriving in the fall,
Heisick has had to adjust to much
tougher practices and being just
one of five outstanding
breaststrokers for the Cardinal.
"I was really overwhelmed at
first," she said. "It was such a
change to be around all these
people who are so talented."
Heisick also began swimming
the 200 breaststroke more fre
quently in addition to her best
event, the 100. "I was always a
little scared of that event," she
said of the 200. "After all the
thousands and thousands of yards
of breaststroke I've done since I've
been here, the 200 doesn't seem

that long anymore."
With a lifetime best of 2:19.00
in the 200 coming in to her fresh
man year, Heisick swam a 2:18.55
two weeks ago against Michigan.
Last week she came in at 2:16.13
against UCLA to shave two more
seconds off her lifetime best. Con
sidering the team is still in intense
training for March's NCAA Cham
pionships, her times will likely
drop a lot more.

But it is in the 100 that she
has the highest expectations.
"One of my goals, maybe not for
this year, is to break a minute in
the 100 breast," she said. "No
American woman has ever done
that. . . . The American record is
a minute point five and that's my
goal for this year. All I can do is
give it my best shot."
In addition to the individual
hopes, she shares the goal held

by all her teammates. "1 really,
really want to be part of a national
championship team," she said.
The Cardinal, with a 4-0 start
and a No. 1 national ranking, i9
well on its way to that goal.
"[The coachesl expect a lot of
us, and I think that's what makes
us better as a team, trying to live
up to that," Heisick said. "I don't
think it could be going any better
than it is."
