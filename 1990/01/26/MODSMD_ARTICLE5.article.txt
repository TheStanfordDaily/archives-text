Marian Wright Edelman, founder and
president of the Children's Defense
Fund, will be the speaker at Stanford's
1990 commencement ceremony.
Edelman is "one of the foremost ad
vocates for children in this country,"
according to Senior Class President Mi
chael Roark, a member of the speaker
selection committee.
Edelman is well-known as a public
interest activist who believes in action.
In"I Dream a World," a collection of
autobiographical portraits of prominent
U.S. black women, she writes, "Children
cannot eat rhetoric, and they cannot be

sheltered by commis
sions.
"We lose about
10,000 children every
year to poverty. That's
more kids over a five
year period than we lost
in the Vietnam war. But
where is the outrage?"
Edelman last spoke at
Stanford during the

1985 You Can Make a Difference con
ference on hunger.
A graduate of Spelman College and
Yale Law School, Edelman was the first
black woman admitted to the bar in
Mississippi, and was integral to the im
plementation of the Head Start program

for pre-kindergarten education in that
state. She is also the author of a book,
"Families in Peril: An Agenda for Social
Change, " based on a 1986 series of lec
tures she gave at Harvard University.
"She is the kind of speaker who will
rock people's boats a little bit, make
them think about what they are going
to do with their lives," said senior Laura
Pinkney, who studied Edelman's book
in a civil rights course at Stanford and
subsequently served as an intern at the
Children's Defense Fund. "She has been
a great role model for me."
Edelman will be Stanford's third
female commencement speaker in the
past four decades and its first black
woman speaker, according to Roark.
