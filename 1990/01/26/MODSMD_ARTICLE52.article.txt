# Co Po hours shorter, fro yo to go to Co Ho

Students are not the only ones
juggling their schedules to meet
demands at the beginning of the
quarter.
Tresidder Union, in its second
quarter under Bon Appetit man
agement, is also making some ad
justments to its hours.
When classes began in January,
new hours went into effect for the
Corner Pocket and Baker Street.
Both now close at 7 p.m.
"We found that business drasti
cally dropped in the evenings,"
explained Paul Szczesiul, associ
ate director of Tresidder. "With
the light use, we decided to com
bine some services to help save
money."
The major impact students will
feel due to the change is on the
availability of frozen yogurt,
which was moved to Baker Street
in the fall.
Szczesiul said the traditional
study break has not been forgot
ten. "We will have a fro yo ma
chine installed in the Coffee
House hopefully by next week,"
he said, explaining that only
wiring work still needs to be done.
The Coffee House remains open
to midnight.
Duke Diercks, Coffee House
manager, also voiced excitement
over the change. Drawing on his
experience as a former student,
he explained, "The Co Ho used
to have its own set of people, and
a different group would hang out
at the Co Po. These lines aren't

as separate anymore, and fro yo
appeals to both types."
"In the past, you wouldn't take
a date to the Co Ho," said Diercks,
explaining his philosophy, "We
want it to become a hangout, but
not for just one type of student."
Szczesiul explained that the
dining area by the Corner Pocket
and Baker Street will remain open
in the evening where students can
sit, talk and study.
"These changes aren't carved in
marble," said Szczesiul. "We are
still learning and staying in
volved." He said the hours may
change again in the spring if the
demand picks up.
As for the Corner Pocket pizza,
Szczesiul said that no decision had
been made yet on whether to move
that to the Coffee House as well.
Diercks said that the Coffe House
is continually changing its menu
in response to demand.
"If pizza moves here, I would
want to differentiate it from the
Co Po, maybe making individual
size ones," said Diercks.
Szczesiul said that fall quarter
saw an increase in overall Tres
idder business from "pleased cus
tomers." He added that "more
refinements can be expected in
response to a need for continued
belt-tightening."
The project for the renovation
of the area formerly occupied by
LOTS-II has been put on hold be
cause of the earthquake, Szczesiul
said. "The University is assessing
its needs for space before we go
ahead and draw up plans," he ex
plained.
