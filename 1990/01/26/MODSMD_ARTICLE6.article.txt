# Disability hasn't held back Truman Scholar
## Despite learning impairment, senior excels in academics, extracurriculars 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
He is a Truman Scholar, but
he can't put together a five-piece
puzzle. He is the director of
Stanford in Government, but he
can't remember the names of
the assistant directors. He has
never received lower than a B
in a Stanford class, yet during
his freshman year, Andy Weis
couldn't remember his phone
number until spring quarter.
Weis, now a senior, has a
learning disability. He is one of
at least 43 learning-disabled stu
dents at Stanford. The number
could be as high as 150, accord

ing to Molly Sandperl, coordina
tor of the learning disability
program at the Disability
Resource Center.
A learning disability is a dis
crepancy between intelligence,
learning potential and actual
performance in one or more dis
creet areas, according to Jim
Bouquin, director of the
Disabilty Resource Center.
Characteristics of learning dis
abilities range from inability to
read a map to reversing letters
and words in spelling and writ
ing. Some people with learning
disabilities have memory diffi
culty, while others suffer from
extreme test anxiety.

It may appear that these
characterisitics describe difficul
ties many people experience, but
those diagnosed with specific
learning disabilities suffer from
them more often and with
greater severity than usual.
Weis has problems with audio
and visual perception. He has
difficulties discriminating be
tween certain consonant and
vowel sounds as well as problems
involving spacial visualization,
needed for tasks from geometry
exercises to parking a car.
In addition, Weis does not rea
son sequentially.
"Most people reason from A
to B to C to D. I sometimes go

from A to C to D and back to
B," Weis explained.
"If I could fully explain how
my mind fails to store and
retrieve information, I wouldn't
have a learning disability," he
said.
Weis was originally diagnosed
as learning-disabled in elemen
tary school. After some time, it
appeared that his disability had
been cured.
"But learning disabilities are
chronic. They don't go away,"
he said.
In high school, as the work
load increased, Weis began to
have difficulties again. He con
tinued to get good grades, which
he attributes to working very
hard.
"My family are all achievers.
I wanted to be one, too. I used
to get up at four in the morning
to study. I thought I was stupid
and was only doing well because
I worked so hard," Weis said.
His difficulties affected his
confidence more than his grades.
"I couldn't even call a girl for
a homework assignment," he
said.
During his sophomore year of
high school, Weis went through
an extensive battery of tests. He
described the day his learning
disability was diagnosed as "one
of the best days of my life."
"It would be devastating for
a lot of people, but for me it
was liberating. I found out there
was a name for what I was ex
pen encing," he said.
In his fourth year at Stanford,
Weis said, "1 still have a chip on
my shoulder to prove myself."
"My high school counselor told
me that even if I was 'lucky'
enough to get in to Stanford, I
would never get anything above
a C," Weis said.

Stanford in Government director Andy Wei#, a senior, has a learning disability but has excelled
both in and out of the classroom.
But, thanks to much hard work,
Weis has never even received a C
in a class.
He said he reads the materials
for all his classes at least three
times — when they are assigned
and before every midterm and
final.
Weis said he must "drop every
thing before a blue-book exam."
In Political Science 35, a class for
which few students do all the
reading even once, Weis reread all
course material before both the
midterm and final.
Because he suffers from severe
test anxiety, Weis now only takes
classes that require papers in
stead of exams.
"I can't eat anything for two
days before a test or I'll throw
up," Weis said. "I've never
finished a test on time at Stan
ford."
Like other disabled students,
Weis has the opportunity to take
advantage of special testing ac
commodations — like a longer
test-taking period or using a
private room for testing — but
has only done so twice.
Other services available to
learning-disabled students include
note-takers, the use of books on
tape, support groups for learning
disabled students and the use of
spell-checkers during exams.
"All these accommodations are

specified by law and accepted na
tionally," said Sandperl.
Currently, there are 43 students
at Stanford who have either iden
tified themselves as learning
disabled or been discovered
through testing coordinated by
the center and the Children's
Hospital and paid for by Cowell
Student Health Services.
Bouquin said during fall quar
ter this year, one student a week
was identified as learning
disabled.
"It's not something in the
drinking water, so it must be that
we are becoming much more able
to identify learning-disabled stu
dents than before," he said.
Sandperl explained, however,
that more research is needed on
learning-disabled students above
the high school level.
"There has been no research
done on people with learning dis
abilities on a post-secondary
level," she said. The Disability
Resource Center's programs are
based on research that has been
done on children, she added.
The center currently works with
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter and the Center for Teaching
and Learning to develop what
Weis refers to as "alternative com
pensatory techniques."
Stan Wanat of the Center for
Teaching and Learning, who
works with learning-disabled stu
dents, said he provides the same
type of information to them as
he would to any other student.
Wanat said he looks at each stu

dent's pattern of strengths and
needs and "helps him or her learn
to maximize his or her learning
efficiency."
This includes "helping the stu
dent to develop a specific plan to
deal with special academic tasks
by trying out some new learning
strategies," Wanat said.
According to Weis, many
learning-disabled students don't
use the resources available to
them because of the stigma sur
rounding disabilities.
"There are people who can't ac
cept [their learning disabilities]
and say they don't need any help.
You're only cheating yourself
then. You should use the services
available, services that provide
access to a similar education,"
Weis said.
He added that difficulties often
arise because a learning disability
is "invisible," as compared to a
physical disability.
Sandperl explained that people
are often patronizing because they
don't understand learning dis
abilities.
"We don't need people to feel
sorry for learning-disabled stu
dents. It's like playing on the var
sity tennis team with one arm
tied behind your back. I think
you're damn good if you can play
with only one arm," Sandperl
said.
Michelle Marincovich, director
of the Center for Teaching and
Learning, said she believes other
students can learn a great deal
from learning-disabled students.

"It's a real mark of intelligence
to be able to work around a dis
ability," she said.
Weis, who received a Truman
Scholarship for his public service
work — which included tutoring
other learning-disabled students,
said his learning disability is a
positive aspect of his life.
"I have to study harder, but
I'm used to working harder, so I
have all this free time on my
hands," he said.
In addition to directing Stan
ford in Government, Weis is an
advising associate, a fraternity
member and a marathon runner.
Unlike many other learning
disabled students, Weis self
identified on his application to
Stanford.
Assoc. Director of Admissions
Jon Reider said the University
does not ask about any type of
disability on its application, but
encourages disabled students to
write about their disabilities.
"We are particularly interested
in how applicants have coped with
their disabilities. This helps us
understand their determination,
their strength of character and
attitude toward life, all of which
are relevant to the admissions
process," a University statement
says.
Reider explained that Stanford
"doesn't necessarily give breaks,"
but said factors such as standard
ized test scores are weighed dif
ferently.
