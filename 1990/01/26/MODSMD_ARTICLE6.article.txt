# Disability hasn't held back Truman Scholar
## Despite learning impairment, senior excels in academics, extracurriculars 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
He is a Truman Scholar, but
he can't put together a five-piece
puzzle. He is the director of
Stanford in Government, but he
can't remember the names of
the assistant directors. He has
never received lower than a B
in a Stanford class, yet during
his freshman year, Andy Weis
couldn't remember his phone
number until spring quarter.
Weis, now a senior, has a
learning disability. He is one of
at least 43 learning-disabled stu
dents at Stanford. The number
could be as high as 150, accord

ing to Molly Sandperl, coordina
tor of the learning disability
program at the Disability
Resource Center.
A learning disability is a dis
crepancy between intelligence,
learning potential and actual
performance in one or more dis
creet areas, according to Jim
Bouquin, director of the
Disabilty Resource Center.
Characteristics of learning dis
abilities range from inability to
read a map to reversing letters
and words in spelling and writ
ing. Some people with learning
disabilities have memory diffi
culty, while others suffer from
extreme test anxiety.

It may appear that these
characterisitics describe difficul
ties many people experience, but
those diagnosed with specific
learning disabilities suffer from
them more often and with
greater severity than usual.
Weis has problems with audio
and visual perception. He has
difficulties discriminating be
tween certain consonant and
vowel sounds as well as problems
involving spacial visualization,
needed for tasks from geometry
exercises to parking a car.
In addition, Weis does not rea
son sequentially.
"Most people reason from A
to B to C to D. I sometimes go

from A to C to D and back to
B," Weis explained.
"If I could fully explain how
my mind fails to store and
retrieve information, I wouldn't
have a learning disability," he
said.
Weis was originally diagnosed
as learning-disabled in elemen
tary school. After some time, it
appeared that his disability had
been cured.
"But learning disabilities are
chronic. They don't go away,"
he said.
In high school, as the work
load increased, Weis began to
have difficulties again. He con
tinued to get good grades, which
he attributes to working very
hard.
"My family are all achievers.
I wanted to be one, too. I used
to get up at four in the morning
to study. I thought I was stupid
and was only doing well because
I worked so hard," Weis said.
His difficulties affected his
confidence more than his grades.
"I couldn't even call a girl for
a homework assignment," he
said.
During his sophomore year of
high school, Weis went through
an extensive battery of tests. He
described the day his learning
disability was diagnosed as "one
of the best days of my life."
"It would be devastating for
a lot of people, but for me it
was liberating. I found out there
was a name for what I was ex
pen encing," he said.
In his fourth year at Stanford,
Weis said, "1 still have a chip on
my shoulder to prove myself."
"My high school counselor told
me that even if I was 'lucky'
enough to get in to Stanford, I
would never get anything above
a C," Weis said.
