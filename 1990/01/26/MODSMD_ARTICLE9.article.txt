# Students Reaching Out
## LinkAGE bridges generation gap 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Kathleen Vanderpool, 90,
relates her travel experiences
while sophomore Tanya Frutkin
talks of her desire to visit Europe.
The conversation reflects the
benefits the two women derive
from each other — the experience
of a full life and the optimisim of
youth.
Vanderpool and Frutkin were
brought together by a public serv
ice program called Generation
LinkAGE. Each week, groups of
Stanford students visit residents
of Channing House or Lytton
Gardens, two retirement homes in
Palo Alto. They wheel disabled
residents, take them places, and
— most importantly — make con
tact with them.
"Old people need to hold on to
youth. We don't want to be shoved
off," said Channing House resi
dent Sara Deal. "The tie with

Stanford fills a void."
"The students make friends
with the residents and have a nice
interaction with them," said
Channing House activities direc
tor Lanita Allen. Many of the
residents are former Stanford pro
fessors who like to talk about the
campus. The students "have good
conversations with them and take
them on walks and also provide
more arms and ears" for the res
idents, Allen said.
The program was started in
1985 by medical student Julie
Switzer, then a freshman. It was
originally called Adopt-a-
Grandparent and was composed
of 15 residents of Switzer's dorm,
Trancos.
According to Switzer, there
were visiting programs in place,
but students were not allowed to
revisit the elderly people. The pro
grams did not want the residents
to become dependent on visits
from students.

"I met a lot of nice people and
I thought not revisiting them was
too bad," Switzer said, so she
started a project in which Stan
ford students could establish long
term relationships with elderly
people.
Friendships developed through
the program can last for many
years. Switzer said she still visits
a 97-year-old woman she saw
through the program.
Sometimes, visiting the resi
dents can be difficult. Last quar
ter, sophomore April Saks visited
a woman who suffered from
Alzheimer's disease. "It can be ex
tremely difficult and draining to
talk to someone suffering like
that," Saks said.
Saks said she has learned much
about the elderly, however. "You
get a different perspective on life,"
she said. "Many people have this
negative view of the elderly, but
you realize that they are just as
youthful as you are."
