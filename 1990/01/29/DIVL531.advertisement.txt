RESOURCES FOR SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT
~9 , Interim Response Protocol
Issued by the Task Force on Sexual Assault
January, 1990
The Task Force on Sexual Assault was appointed in August, 1989, by the Dean of Student Affairs, and is
in the process of formulating a University-wide sexual assault protocol. The Task Force defines sexual
assault as any forced or unconsented sexual activity. Examples may include, but are not limited to> verbal or
physical coercion, threat of injury, or lack of informed consent due to impairment by alcohol or other drugs. For
the interim period from now until the publication of the Task Force's final report (Nov., 1990), the Task
Force recommends the following sexual assault response protocol for the student community.
Because we believe your physical safety is paramount, we strongly urge all survivors of a sexual assault
(female or male) to seek immediate medical attention, from the emergency room at the Stanford Hospital
or at El Camino Hospital, or from your own health care specialist. If you are a survivor (recently or in
the past), or if you have any questions regarding your experience, or if you know of someone who could
use these resources, we strongly recommend that you contact any or all of the following services. By
contacting these resources, survivors can advance their own recovery, and assist the Stanford community
in the elimination of sexual assaults.
★ Call 911, or 723-9633, for the Stanford Police Department. These are law enforcement officers who
are trained to respond sensitively, and who will provide information about medical, legal and counseling
options available to you. What you can expect: You will be asked to describe the incident and to seek
medical care. You do not have to identify yourself by name, and you are under no obligation to file an official
police report. You retain the option to pursue criminal legal action up to six years after the assault. You are
strongly encouraged to notify the police.
★ Call 493-7273 for the Mid-Peninsula YWCA Rape Crisis Center. This Center, staffed by
state-certified volunteer advocates, provides crisis intervention services for survivors of sexual assault and
their families in northern Santa Clara county. What you can expect: You can access 24-hour confidential
counseling, emergency assistance, information and referral, accompaniment and advocacy to the hospital,
police, and court procedures. Confidential walk-in counseling is also available on a limited basis at no
charge. You can request a male or female counselor or advocate.
★ Call 725-4739 for Chris Griffith, Director of the Stanford Rape Response Group. This is an
on-campus group made up of trained Stanford professional staff and students. What you can expect: You
can access confidential crisis intervention, and on-campus advocacy for University-related problems; i.e.,
academic, financial, or housing problems. This group can be reached after business hours by calling
the police.
