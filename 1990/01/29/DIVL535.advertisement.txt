Either.
By age 30, Alexander the Great had«con
quered the known world. But it wasn't his
resume that led him to victory. Instead, he
possessed the ambition and perseverance of
a dynamic leader.

that combination that
drives our team to the
forefront of the elec
tronics industry. With
over $292,000,000 in
sales last year, we continue
to excel in the design and
manufacture of microwave components and
systems. 1988 also brought the introduction
of over 115 new products used in a wide
range of defense, communications and com
mercial applications.
And now, as we sharpen our focus on the
future, we look to today's Alexanders. They
