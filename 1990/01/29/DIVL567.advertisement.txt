WHO SAYS THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A FREE LUNCH?
Stanford kept the axe and the 9 Stanford alums on our development team were
treated to a free victory lunch by our 6 Cal grads following the Big Game.
We can't guarantee a free lunch every year, but we can offer an excellent
opportunity for challenge and growth, competitive salaries and a generous
benefit package in an upbeat environment of friendly rivalry.
We are a small, but rapidly growing, software development company. Founded
in 1984, we are now the leading supplier of expert-system software to the
business community. The company currently has 175 employees with
headquarters in Palo Alto and regional sales offices throughout the United
States, Canada and Europe.
We seek software engineering candidates with a BS or MS in EE, CS, Math
Sciences or a related field. Two or four years experience developing software in
a commercial environment is helpful but not required. Prefer US citizenship
or US Permanent Visa (PRV).
MONDAY, FEBRUARY STH
we will be on campus
interviewing for software engineers.
