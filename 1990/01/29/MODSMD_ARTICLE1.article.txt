# New phone system: For whom does the bell toll?
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
The telecommunications revolution
will come to Stanford sometime this
summer, when all residences are con
verted to the University phone system
— but some students say they'd rather
stick with Pacific Bell.
Next fall, students will be able to walk
into their rooms, plug in a phone and
hear a dial tone, without having to wait
three to five days for Pacific Bell to
connect their service. In addition, they
will be given their phone numbers im
mediately.
Some students will even be able to
connect computers in their rooms di
rectly to SUNet, the University com
puter network.

However, many students, particularly
graduate students, are dismayed at the
prospect of having to switch from Pacific
Bell service to University service. They
feel that any possible benefits of the
Stanford system simply do not outweigh
the added cost and inconvenience it will
cause them.
The conversion from the current
Pacific Bell system to the Stanford sys
tem will involve many significant
changes in telephone use and billing.
Almost any phone can be used with
the new system, even rotary phones,
according to Communications Service
director Jan Thomson, who is in charge
of the University phone system and the
project to extend it to the residences.
Under the new system, calls made
within the Stanford campus will require

dialing only five digits. To make an off
campus call, the number 9 must be
dialed first.
Calls made beyond an eight-mile limit,
which is identical to the Pacific Bell
local calling area, will now require an
additional seven-digit personal access
code.
This code will have to be entered after
the number is dialed and will also have
to be used on all long-distance calls.
The system will be part of the same
phone network now used by all Univer
sity offices and Roble Hall.
Personal access codes
Each student will be issued his or her
own personal access code, according to
Thomson, and students will keep the
same code as long as they remain at

Stanford. Most likely, the Office of Com
munication Services will begin issuing
codes sometime this spring to students
who want them.
The primary advantage of the access
code system is that students will be
billed individually for their long-distance
service. Students will no longer have to
go through the complicated process of
dividing up their monthly long-distance
bills with their roommates, Thomson
said.
In addition, students can make a call
from any phone on campus and have it
charged to their personal code.
The University phone system was
placed in Roble Hall when it was rein
forced, and for the most part, students
seem to like the new system.
Karen Grieb, a junior who moved into

Roble after the earthquake, said the
individual bills "make it very easy at
the end of the month." She also said
she is not really bothered by having to
dial the seven extra digits.
Lan Brown, a sophomore living in
Roble, said having to dial seven more
digits is "kind of a hassle," but he likes
the individual billing.
But graduate students, many of whom
live with their families, do not need the
advantages of individual billing and feel
that having to enter the extra seven
digits will be very inconvenient.
Jonathan Matthews, a graduate stu
dent in education who lives in Escondido
Village with his wife, said he does not
need separate billing and does not want
to be forced to use an access code
when it is of no benefit to him.
Mike Murray, a graduate stu
dent in engineering who also lives
in Escondido Village, said it will
just be a "pain to use the [personal
access codel." Even though he is
not married and has a roommate,
he feels that the individual billing
is not worth the added inconven
ience for him.
Murray also feels that the
"advantage of having a working
jack upon moving in is meaning
less for graduate students," who
often stay in one apartment for
several years and only have their
service connected once.
Thomson said she is aware that
the need of graduate students dif
fer from those of undergraduates.
In response to their concerns,
Communication Services may give
graduate students the option of
having their long-distance calls
billed directly to their phone in
stead of to an access code.
A question of rates
One of the most serious criti
cisms of the new system involves
the rates. Even though the phone
lines in rooms will be working
when the students move in, a line
activation fee of $36 must be paid.
This fee is comparable to the
$37.75 fee charged by Pacific Bell
for line activation.
Most objections focus on the
monthly service charge of $13.60,
which pays for unlimited local
calls and must be paid on any
operating phone line. This fee is
nearly the same as the $13.50 flat
rate fee charged by Pacific Bell
for fundamentally the same serv
ice.
However, Pacific Bell offers two
other monthly rate plans which
are considerably cheaper than the
flat rate fee offered by Pacific Bell
or by Stanford.
One such plan, called measured
rate service, offers a more
restricted calling plan for a
reduced monthly fee. Matthews
said he uses measured-rate serv
ice and has monthly fees ranging
from $7 to $8.
"I will probably be paying at
least $50 more per year," Mat
thews said.
Residents who subscribe to the
other reduced-rate service, Uni
versal Lifeline Service, will have

to pay even more money on the
Stanford plan.
According to Murray, many
families in Escondido Village, pos
sibly as many as 100, use lifeline
service, which only charges them
$2.50 per month.
Lifeline service is available only
to people with very limited finan
cial resources, and under the new
system, they may be forced to
spend over $100 more per year,
Murray said.
Thomson said she is aware of
the problem for students who use
lifeline service. Because Pacific
Bell will not disclose how many
students subscribe to lifeline serv
ice, she said she can not be sure
of the extent of the problem.
Although Communication Serv
ices is looking into the situation,
lifeline service would be difficult
to implement on Stanford's sys
tem, she said.
Most distance calls cheaper
Calls beyond the eight-mile
service area but still within this
area code will be charged at the
same rate as Pacific Bell, Thom
son said.
Long-distance service is an
other area of controversy. Under
the new system, students will not
be able to choose their own long
distance service.
According to Thomson, the
Stanford system uses a combina
tion of different long-distance
services to provide cost-efficient
yet high-quality service.
Thomson said the weekend and
night rates, applicable when most
students do their long-distance
calling, are between 5 percent and
15 percent below AT&T's prices,
depending on the call.
Brown confirmed Thomson's
claim, saying "rates seem to be
cheaper, as long as you are not
making calls in the middle of the
day."
Thomson admitted that Stan
ford's daytime rates are now
somewhat higher. However, she
said she has set a goal to reduce
daytime rates to between 5 per
cent and 10 percent below AT&T's.
Students can still use telephone
credit cards to make phone calls.
Kelly Parsons, also a Roble resi
dent, said he has no problems
using a Sprint calling card instead
of his access code.
In fact, in order to make calls
to 976, 950 and 900 prefixes, res
idents must use a calling card.
Stanford's system does not have

the capability ?of filing students
for calls made td these numbers,
Thomson said.
International rates are compa
rable to those of AT&T, Thomson
said. She ho pep that Communica
tion Services will be able to reduce
its international rates in the fu
ture.
Possible rate increases?
Murray said that although
Stanford's rates are now fairly
low, he fears that the University
may raise rates at any point in
the future because it is not a
federally regulated utility, like
Pacific Bell.
"When was the last time Stan
ford lowered its rates for any
thing?" Murray asked.
Thomson disagrees, however.
Communication Services is a serv
ice center which must report
annually to the federal govern
ment, she said. Her office is re
quired to be within 5 percent of
breaking even within a year.
Thus, Stanford cannot raise
rates in order to make a profit.
Thomson did say that rates
could increase if the vendors, such
as Pacific Bell, AT&T, and other
telephone companies, raise their
rates.
She said her job involves trying
to balance the University's need
for high-quality telephone service
with its desire for cost-efficiency.
Any increase in rates would affect
the University as well as students.
Another University bill
Students will be billed monthly
for their phone calls through the
Bursar's Office. The telephone bill
will be mailed separately from the
regular University bill, according
to Pam Hansson, an assistant bur
sar.
Payments can be made through
the mail or put in a box in the
Bursar's Office, Hansson said.
The names of students who are
delinquent on their payments will
be given to Communication Serv
ices, Hansson said.
Because the phone system is
now a University operation, stu
dents who do not pay their phone
bills may now have their registra
tion put on hold, according to
Thomson.
The separation between Com
munication Services and the Bur
sar's Office has inconvenienced at
least one Roble student this year.
Brown said his bill was received
one month late by the Bursar's

Office, and his next bill included
an extra charge.
When he called Communication
Services, the office could not im
mediately determine whether his
original payment had been re
ceived, he said.
Brown said the problems with
his bill were eventually cleared up.
One of Murray's complaints
about the new system is the pos
sibility that someone could ille
gally obtain someone else's access
code and run up charges on that
account.
However, Thomson said any
student whose bill contained in
correct charges can resolve the
problem with Communication
Services. "Illegal charges will not
be a debt to the individual whose
account they were charged to."
Privacy issues debated
Students will no longer be listed
with directory assistance or in the
white pages. Instead, anyone wan
ting to find the number of a Stan
ford student will have to call the
Stanford operator's number, at
which someone is on duty 24
hours a day, seven days a week,

Thomson said.
Ideally, if a person calls direc
tory assistance looking for a Stan
ford number, the operator should
refer him or her to the Stanford
operator. However, Murray said
he is skeptical of how well the
system will work.
Matthews also noted that many
graduate students have spouses
who are not affiliated with the
University — and would also not
be listed with directory assistance.
A final important issue is
privacy. About 10 percent of Uni
versity phones are now equipped
with a screen that lists the phone
numbers of incoming calls from
University phones.
The system is designed to make
receptionists' jobs easier, and it
seems likely that such screens will
become even more common in the
future, Thomson said.
However, certain organizations
on campus — such as the Bridge,
Counseling and Psychological
Services, and the police depart
ment — take calls that are
supposed to be confidential.
Student calls to such telephones
might no longer be anonymous or

confidential under the new sys-!
tem, Murray said.
The conversion from Pacific!
Bell service to Stanford service;
will take place in stages over this;
summer, Thomson said.
Starting in June, telephone"
cable will be placed in conduitsi
throughout campus that have al-J
ready been laid in the ground. No;
work will be done inside actual;
dorm rooms or apartments, except)
where repairs are needed, since»
the system will use the existing
phone wiring, according to Thorny
son. !
