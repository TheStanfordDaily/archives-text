# New phone system: For whom does the bell toll?
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
The telecommunications revolution
will come to Stanford sometime this
summer, when all residences are con
verted to the University phone system
â€” but some students say they'd rather
stick with Pacific Bell.
Next fall, students will be able to walk
into their rooms, plug in a phone and
hear a dial tone, without having to wait
three to five days for Pacific Bell to
connect their service. In addition, they
will be given their phone numbers im
mediately.
Some students will even be able to
connect computers in their rooms di
rectly to SUNet, the University com
puter network.

However, many students, particularly
graduate students, are dismayed at the
prospect of having to switch from Pacific
Bell service to University service. They
feel that any possible benefits of the
Stanford system simply do not outweigh
the added cost and inconvenience it will
cause them.
The conversion from the current
Pacific Bell system to the Stanford sys
tem will involve many significant
changes in telephone use and billing.
Almost any phone can be used with
the new system, even rotary phones,
according to Communications Service
director Jan Thomson, who is in charge
of the University phone system and the
project to extend it to the residences.
Under the new system, calls made
within the Stanford campus will require

dialing only five digits. To make an off
campus call, the number 9 must be
dialed first.
Calls made beyond an eight-mile limit,
which is identical to the Pacific Bell
local calling area, will now require an
additional seven-digit personal access
code.
This code will have to be entered after
the number is dialed and will also have
to be used on all long-distance calls.
The system will be part of the same
phone network now used by all Univer
sity offices and Roble Hall.
Personal access codes
Each student will be issued his or her
own personal access code, according to
Thomson, and students will keep the
same code as long as they remain at

Stanford. Most likely, the Office of Com
munication Services will begin issuing
codes sometime this spring to students
who want them.
The primary advantage of the access
code system is that students will be
billed individually for their long-distance
service. Students will no longer have to
go through the complicated process of
dividing up their monthly long-distance
bills with their roommates, Thomson
said.
In addition, students can make a call
from any phone on campus and have it
charged to their personal code.
The University phone system was
placed in Roble Hall when it was rein
forced, and for the most part, students
seem to like the new system.
Karen Grieb, a junior who moved into

Roble after the earthquake, said the
individual bills "make it very easy at
the end of the month." She also said
she is not really bothered by having to
dial the seven extra digits.
Lan Brown, a sophomore living in
Roble, said having to dial seven more
digits is "kind of a hassle," but he likes
the individual billing.
But graduate students, many of whom
live with their families, do not need the
advantages of individual billing and feel
that having to enter the extra seven
digits will be very inconvenient.
Jonathan Matthews, a graduate stu
dent in education who lives in Escondido
Village with his wife, said he does not
need separate billing and does not want
