Romania since December's revolt,
i Thousands of anti-government protesters
broke through a line of armed soldiers,
Pushing to the doors of the government
headquarters and scurrying atop a half

;<vith his government and had agreed to
Jroad talks.
£ Iliescu was named head of a loose coa
lition of disaffected Communists and intel
jecuals who assumed power after a revolt
justed the 24-year regime of Nicolae
jCeausescu, who was executed with his wife,
jfelena, on Dec. 25.
But the governing National Salvation
jrront has come under fire recently for
Announcing its intention to compete in free
Elections against newly formed opposition
jbarties. Critics allege the front cannot fairly
Compete in balloting it will also administer,
|md some allege it supports a return to
*>ne-party rule.
4 Pro-government demonstrators also
Crowded around the building chanting
4 Iliescu ... We are with you!" but they were
Outnumbered and out-shouted by the op
position forces.

I he two sides booed and hissed at each
other, but there was no violence. No injuries
were reported as the line of soldiers about
75 yards from the building gave way to
the crowd. The soldiers then re-formed
their line five deep at the building's
entrances.
After nightfall, truckloads of pro
government demonstrators were brought
to the square, some shouting that the op

and "gypsies."
After the reinforcements arrived, Iliescu
reappeared and shouted over a microphone
that the front had met representatives of
the three parties sponsoring the protest.
"All the political parties agreed to
cooperate, including the three that spon
sored this demonstration," Iliescu said.
"Next week we will continue the dialogue."

seeking to run candidates in May elections
would meet with front leaders Thursday.
Earlier, a spokesman with the opposition
Peasants Party said that party leaders met
Iliescu to demand that the front give way
to a broader-based interim government.
A small crowd held a separate protest
at the headquarters of the state radio and
television building and demanded access to
the media to call for the resignation of the
provisional government. A 10-minute seg
ment of that protest was telecast later.
About 2,000 of the National Salvation
Front's backers held another rally earlier
at a nearby district government building,
chanting "The front is vis and we are the
people."
