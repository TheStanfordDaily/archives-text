# E. German elections moved up

### 
EAST BERLIN (AP) - East
Germany's Communist-led gov
ernment and opposition forces
agreed late yesterday to move the
nation's first free elections up to
March 18 and to govern by coa
lition until then.
Communist Premier Hans
Modrow and the more than 40
opposition representatives an
nounced the new election date —
moving ahead by nearly two
months the balloting that had
been planned for May 6.
The decisions were part of a
"common responsibility to
strengthen democracy in East
Germany," Modrow said.
The agreement, which includes
the fourth restructuring of the
Cabinet in as many months, ac
knowledged the need to quickly
seat a government that has the
trust and confidence of the
populace.
A new Cabinet — the first to
include representatives from
emerging reform groups — will
be submitted by Wednesday to
Parliament, said Martin Ziegler, a
Lutheran Church official.
The new leadership will include
one member from each of the nine
opposition groups represented at
weekly talks with government, al
though the ministers will be
named without portfolio, Ziegler
said.
Wolfgang Schnur of the Demo
cratic Awakening movement said
the Cabinet members will decide
later how to distribute ministerial
responsibilities.
The planned Cabinet changes
follow an announcement three
days ago that Christian Demo-

Over a dozen small
parties will compete
in the elections.

cratic Union was pulling out its
three ministers. But following
yesterday's agreement, the Union
— one of four traditionally
Communist-allied parties — was
expected to take part in the new
leadership, Schnur said.
Modrow also has been repeat
edly challenged by the pro
democracy opposition groups,
which contend he has no mandate
to govern because he and his 27-
member Communist-dominated
Cabinet were seated by a Parlia
ment that was not democratically
elected.
More than a dozen small polit
ical parties are vying for public
support in this nation of 16 mil
lion, which is troubled by eco
nomic disaster and a continuing
exodus of its most promising
workers.
The flight westward, which
drained the nation of more than
340,000 people last year, recently
swelled to about 2,500 departures
daily.
Many opposition parties held
weekend congresses to chart strat
egy for the elections, which will
be the country's first free com
petitive vote.
But there was little indication
the fractious reform forces would
be able to band together to chal
lenge the still-dominant Commu
nists.

New Forum, the largest of the
pro-democracy groups to emerge
from last fall's peaceful revolu
tion, previously claimed 200,000
members.
But a moderate faction split
from the movement to form a new
party over the weekend, and the
core group collapsed into divisive
squabbling yesterday at its con
vention in East Berlin.
The splinter group named itself
the German Forum Party and
spoke out at its meeting in Karl-
Marx-Stadt for a complete break
with socialism. It claimed to have
100,000 members, suggesting that
as many as half of New Forum's
supporters had defected.
The New Forum delegates who
met in East Berlin reiterated their
aim of combining socialist ideol
ogy with some free enterprise.
Meanwhile, the leader of the
Christian Democratic Union an
nounced that he was prepared to
seek an election coalition with
Democratic Awakening and the
German Social Union, two oppo
sition groups that support
market-oriented reforms and
closer ties with West Germany.
Also yesterday, a West German
newspaper reported that East
Germany's former hard-line
leader, Erich Honecker, will be ar
rested Monday upon his release
from a hospital.
Doctors have determined that
Honecker, 77, is too ill to be held
in custody following surgery for
kidney cancer and he will be sent
to a prison hospital instead of jail,
Bild newspaper said.
