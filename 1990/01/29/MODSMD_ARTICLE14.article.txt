## Those lethal refunds 
### 
Refunding process is
dooming even groups
approved of by majority

AT STANFORD, one can
learn as much outside the
classroom as inside the class
room.
Most extracurricular learning
results directly from the prevalence
of student organizations on
campus, which offer everything
from a chance to learn the radio
business firsthand to a means
through which to celebrate one's
ethnic heritage.
These opportunities are now in
serious jeopardy.
Most campus organizations are
funded by student money collected
through the ASSU. Groups seeking
appropriations from this pool of
student money go on the ballot in
the ASSU spring election, tying
their fate to the will of the voters.
Such is democracy.
But, in what has always been a
strange twist on democratic prin
ciples, the ASSU permits students
who vote in the spring election to
reclaim money from organizations
of which they personally do not
And students are free to
reclaim all their money for pizza.
The rationale allegedly has
something to do with protecting
the rights of the minority. But the
reality is now the stripping away
of money from student groups
whose fee requests have been ap
proved by the student body.

The Asian American Students
Association received the support of
68 percent of the student body last
spring, thus winning its fee re
quest. Only 32 percent of the stu
dent body voted against AASA. But
during last week's ASSU fee
refunding process, AASA lost more
than 51 percent of its money.
AASA is not alone.
Overall, 11 student organiza
tions lost at least 25 percent of
their funding to students claiming
refunds.
The ASSU fee refunding process
is a distortion of democracy, it is
killing student groups on campus,
and it has to go.
Such a move would require an
amendment to the ASSU Consti
tution, which would require ap
proval of the student body in this
spring's election. With the support
of all Council of Presidents candi
dates and ASSU senator-hopefuls,
and with a large dose of publicity
by student groups, the amendment
might just pass.
The last time such an amend
ment was proposed was 1985. It
failed. But the reaction of its au
thor, then-ASSU senator Mark
Soble, following the proposal's
defeat, may very well prove prop
hetic: "I think students will ap
prove something along these lines
within the next five years. They
are going to be forced to if the
special fee system is to remain sol
vent."
If students do not approve an
amendment eliminating fee
refunds, many student groups will
soon meet their demises, which
would be everyone's loss.
