AD House presumed guilty despite proven innocence

THE FUNNY THING about
demons is that once you start
hunting for them, more often
than not you wall end up finding them
exactly where you expected them to be.
In this case, the demons in question
are drugs and the threat they pose to
society. We by no means want to
trivialize this threat. Every death or
ruined life caused by drugs is a
tragedy. President Bush's war on drugs
is rationally sound in basis as well as
timeliness. What we question is the
arena in which this war is being
fought.
The AD House is a community in
the truest sense, and the ties between
its members are strong.
It is a house in which you can
depend on the fact that your neighbor
will value your personal liberty as
highly as his or her own. It is not a
house divided into "us" and "them"

camps, as quotations from a past house
member suggested (on the back page
of Wednesday's Daily).
The only way we can respond to
these allegations is by expressing our
wish that this person be interviewed
further before his or her story is given
any credence.
What this house has undergone in
the past 11 days has affected us all
deeply. We residents feel violated, help
less and persecuted. For many of us,
eating, not to mention studying, has
been out of the question. It has gotten
to the point where some here swear
they have heard phantom reverbera
tions and clicking while talking on the
phone.
And there is nothing like watching
your resident assistant being taken
away in a nondescript blue Ford by
two police officers in suits
("undercover," you understand) to

make you feel like a clay pigeon on a
clear day.
We criticize the Stanford Police
Department for their handling of the
drug raid. Their basis for the search
warrant was the report of an "infor
mant" whose appetite for revenge
appears to be superseded only by his
or her overindulgent imagination.
We find the guilty-although-proven
innocent attitude they have shown
since the raid both alarming and ap
palling. We can see that to err may be
human, but doing so can tend to screw
up promotions.
Little better was The Daily's cover
age of the raid. One \)f the things we
resent the most is the way The Daily
was quick to tie the raid to past hap
penings in the house (with the article
"AD House has history of drug use" in
Wednesday's Daily).
If there is one thing the University

has made painfully clear to us over the
past year, it has been that our house
no longer belongs to Alpha Delta Phi
fraternity.
Our history is four months long. To
connect this event in any way with
improprieties of previous residents is
unfair and irresponsible.
One thing that this event has given
its participants is a healthy helping of
hindsight.
Despite this, some people are of the
opinion that the demons in question
have been found and are currently
residing in the AD House.
We find this sad because it means
that the most important lesson of this
happening has been overlooked â€”
namely, the reason that demon-hunting
is so easy to do is that demons usually
spring from the hearts of those doing
the seeking.
