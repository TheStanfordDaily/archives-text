# Carpooling is no panacea for campus parking problems
## 
### 
In a Jan. 22 editorial titled "No
parking zones," The Daily put forth a
very simple argument based on an
even simpler principle of economics:
convenience costs. The more convenient
a good or service, the higher its cost.
This applies to parking at Stanford.
The closer people want to park to their
dorm, office, laboratory or classroom,
the more expensive it should be.
Unfortunately, after recognizing this
principle, The Daily came to the wrong
conclusion: pay for students' very con
venient parking by inconveniencing
everyone else.

The only solution The Daily recom
mends — more carpools and rideshar
ing — inconveniences only employees
and faculty, not students.
Clearly, carpools are part of the solu
tion, but cannot be the whole solution.
In the next few years, because of
construction of new residences (such as
Kimball Hall), laboratories, offices and
classrooms, as well as new hiring in all
areas of University life, Stanford will
experience a shortfall of between 1,900
and 3,000 parking spaces.
Presently, 424 people participate in
carpools — most of whom tend to be
our lowest-paid, farthest-traveling em
ployees. Even if participation increases
by 200 people each year, the University
will still be far short of meeting the
demand for parking in years to come.
Increasing participation in carpools
will most likely be costly. The creation
of a carpool program will require heavy

What we don't need are
solutions that will hurt one
group for the convenience
of another.

expenditures either through incentives
or on vans and a bureaucracy to
schedule and oversee it.
In addition, if past participation pat
terns are any indication, union mem
bers and lower-level staff will pay for
the convenience of students, upper-level
staff and faculty.
This is a long way of saying that
there are no simple solutions to our
parking dilemma and that all aspects
must be considered.
The alternative to spending $40 mil
lion dollars on parking structures —

money that otherwise could be spent
on student programs, faculty housing,
reseach space, etc. — is for each of us
to ask the fundamental question: "How
much is my convenience worth and
how can I change my behavior so that
we don't spend that kind of money?"
The Committee on Parking and
Transportation is presently reconsider
ing all parking policies on campus and
will issue a report in March.
During spring quarter, there will be
a comment period and a series of
public hearings. As chair, I hope to
hear from all of you.
What we need are creative solutions
to our common problem. What we
don't need are solutions that will hurt
one group for the convenience of an
other.
