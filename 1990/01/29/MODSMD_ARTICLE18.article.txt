## Writers' social responsibility 
### 
IN "AFRO-AMERICAN WRITING
1950-1970," a course in which I am
presently enrolled, my professor,
Sandra Drake, explained that writing is
an ethical act. And it is by nature social:
The writer draws from the myriad expe
riences of men and women in society and
attempts to make sense of them all via
the written word, she said.
Through his or her writing, these sen
timents and experiences are reaffirmed,
validated and guided toward a higher
level of understanding or resolution.
Because of this relationship with the
community from which he or she comes,
and in recognizing the power of the writ
ten word, it is the writer's social respon
sibility to fairly and accurately articulate
the sentiments and experiences of the
society about which he or she writes, she
said.
The social responsibility of the writer.
Never before I heard Prof. Drake's com
ments (which came at the end of my stint
as a Daily columnist) did I truly under
stand the concept of the writer's obliga
tion to his or her community.
This responsibility goes much further
than merely presenting a positive and
inoffensive picture of the community.
Rather, it extends and obligates the writer
to ignite, validate and challenge the so
ciety's collective sentiments and experi
ences in a coherent manner.
That is the obligation of the writer to
his or her community.
I only now understand and can artic
ulate what has motivated me through
this Daily volume to discuss the issues
which impact the communities of which

I am a part.
I have written as an African-American
student, belonging at once to the student
of color and overall student communities
â€” but primarily to the Black community.
It is from there that I come, from that
base that I am developing a political and
social understanding of society and to
there that I have committed myself.
It is mutually beneficial for other com
munities to gain an understanding and
knowledge of a black perspective.
Rather than being a "special interest"
perspective, it makes an integral contri
bution to the entire community. Black,
white, Chicano/Latino, Asian-American,
Native American and all other sentiments
and experiences create the total Stanford
community.
For myself, as an African-American
woman, writing this column has been a
learning and growing exprience for me.
Over these 4 months, I have come to
rely on different individuals and institu
tions for guidance and clarity.
From them, as well as many others in
history, I have drawn great inspiration
and have been guided.
I would like to thank Malcolm X and
anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells-
Barnett, both of whom are perhaps my
greatest inspirations. For always telling
it like it was, is and should be, I admire
them greatly and humbly try to carry
on their tradition.
I would like to thank Daily multicul
tural liaison Steve Phillips, an extraor
dinarily talented writer and good friend
who has helped me to clearly articulate
my thoughts as well as challenged me to

Never being complacent
and always challenging
current assumptions of the
'way things are' are the
things that add spice to
Stanford.

realize my own potential as a writer. J
I would also like to thank the entire
Stanford community for making "the
Farm" a place in which issues abound
and a variety of viewpoints flourish.
Never being complacent and always chal
lenging current assumptions of the "way
things are" are the things that add spice
to Stanford.
Most importantly, I want to thank the
African-American community here at
Stanford and in East Palo Alto.
Through finding my home in these
symbiotic communities, I have developed
a better understanding of my brothers
and sisters and how I as a writer can
play a role in helping to find solutions
to the vast array of problems that have
an impact on all of us.

is her final column.
