## Applying the model of the 1967 Cleveland mayoral race 
### 
T HAT'S WHERE Mayor Stokes
lives, my mom would say when
ever we drove past Carl Stokes'
house during my childhood in
Cleveland.
While my brothers and I were proud
that our mayor was black, we did not
fully grasp the historic significance of
that fact nor the legacy Stokes left for
the United States
loday, few others truly appreciate
the lesson of the Stokes victory that
will be portrayed in tonight's segment
of "Eyes on the Prize II."
After stripping away the cosmetic
components of American inequality —
segregated buses and public facilities
— the black freedom movement in the
1960s came face to face with the cen
tral issue of the time — power. Black
power. In Cleveland, the thrust for
power catapulted Stokes into national
prominence as the first black mayor of
a major American city.
The right reading of Stokes' 1967
election reveals a strategy and formula
for the political transformation of the
United States in the 19905.
Stokes' electoral equation included
three vital factors — high black voter
registration, record black voter turnout
and a sizeable minority of the white
vote.
Black Clevelanders in 1967 accounted

for 35 percent of the city's total popu
lation. Recognizing the potential of that
base and driven by the imperative of
the times, Stokes entered the race
knowing the numbers could be put
together to win.
The first numbers involved regis
tered voters. After losing the 1965
mayoral race by 2,000 votes out of the
more than 200,000 that were cast, the
Stokes team knew that every unregis
tered black voter represented the po
tential margin of victory in 1967.
The second set of numbers were
actual voters. Newly registered voters
had to turn out and vote in record
numbers for the formula to work. To
guarantee high registration and turn
out, Stokes put together an astounding
political machine.
His campaign had precinct organizers
for all 903 of Cleveland's polls, and
they turned out 80 percent of the
registered black voters. Ninety five
percent of those voters pulled the lever
for Stokes, and in five precincts, the
Republican candidate did not receive a
single vote.
The final piece of the equation was
the white vote. With a highly energized
and mobilized black electorate, Stokes
did not need many white votes. He
received 19 percent of the white vote,
about 35,000, and defeated his oppon

ent by 1,500 votes.
The most important lesson of Stokes'
victory is that the black vote is strate
gic in U.S. politics. An organized black
electorate joined by about 20 percent of
the white vote represents a new elec
toral majority in many American urban
centers.
When Asian-Americans, Native Amer
icans, Chicanos and Latinos are added
to the equation, the potential for
change is undeniable.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson articulated
the potential of such a "rainbow coali
tion" when he said, "When the old
minorities come together, they form a
new majority."
The movement to reform the West
ern Culture Program demonstrated
that such a coalition can be built at
Stanford.
Contrary to "conventional wisdom,"
that kind of coalition is not built by
taking a moderate political approach,
but by closely aligning the candidate
with the black struggle for freedom.
After centuries of broken promises,
economic exploitation and political
repression, black people want change.
Only when presented with a candidate
who offers significant restructuring of
the status quo will they register and
vote in numbers large enough to
produce a Stokes-like victory.

Running at the height of the Black
Power era, Stokes embodied black
aspirations for power and self
determination. To many, his election
was the fulfillment of Martin Luther
King Jr.'s dream.
Fifteen years later, Chicago Mayor
Harold Washington touched a similar
chord in black America.
Declaring that "I stand here as a
result of 400 years of travail and
struggle in this country," Washington
gave new life to a movement that had
been searching for organization and
unitv.
Washington's victory inspired Jack
son to embark on his 1984 crusade
cloaked in a campaign's clothing. Sens
ing the historical tide shifting, two
million new voters registered.
Two years later, those new black
voters joined a minority of the white
population in six southern states to
elect Democratic senators and wrest
control of the U.S. Senate from the
Republican Party.
And for one brief, shining moment in
March 1988, the brothers and sisters
and aunts and uncles of the people
who elected Stokes as mayor thrust
Jackson to the front of the race for
the Democratic presidential nomination.
As political pundits prognosticate and

predict developments in the 19905, they
would do well to take a moment and
watch tonight's "Eyes on the Prize II."
Stokes's example offers the key to a
rebirth of progressive politics in this
nation and on this campus. When one
factors in the growth of the other
minority populations, the result is a
potential new majority based on pro
gressive politics.
The numbers are there. People of
color in the United States will soon
comprise close to one-third of the
population. If Stokes' highly efficient
organization can be replicated on the
national level, then one day in the not
too-distant future, I can drive by the
White House and say to my children.
"That's where President Jackson lives."
