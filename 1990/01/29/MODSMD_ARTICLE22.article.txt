Letter writing, messages both
sent and received and the space
that is constructed in this com
munication, is the major theme
in Nobel Prize-winning Nigerian
author Wole Soyinka's latest book
"Isara: A Voyage Around Essay."
A message in the form of a let
ter about the death of his father
and a message in the form of an
unopened-till-"years later" tin
box, were the occasions for the
writing of the book, Soyinka in
forms us in the preface.
Unable to go to his father's fu
neral because he was exiled from
Nigeria, Soyinka sent a taped mes
sage instead. Years later, after
finding a tin box belonging to his
mother and seeing the various
bits and pieces of the past that it
contained, the memory of that
past and his anger at not being
able to see his father for a last
time, compelled him to write
"Isara."
Written as fragments from an

incomplete childhood mem
ory of the roughly 15-

year period before,
during and after

World War 11,
"Isara," in the

words of its
author, rep-

resents:
"the

period when a pattern of (the lives
of his father and his friends) was
set — for better or worse — under
the compelling impact of the
megor events in their times, both
local and global, the uneasy love
hate relationship with the colonial
presence, and its own ambiguous
attitudes towards the Western
educated elite of the Nigerian
protectorate."
Alternating between first and
third person narratives, the book
is both a per-

sonal and his
torical account
of the life and
times of a
Nigerian vil
lage and its in
habitants.
It tells us of
the intrigues,
the failed eco
nom i c ven
tures, the
formation of a
community in

exile, the power
of the exiled and this power's ef
fects.
Soditan, a schoolteacher and the
main character of the book, tells
us the story of his friends and
family, their life in Isara and their
life away from it. The omniscient
narrator also tells us of Soditan
and his friends' attempts at es
tablishing a new order, a new gov
ernment and a new political
stability out of their ex-colonial
— or newly acquired — freedom.
In these efforts and in the book
itself, education is made a priority.

colonizers are negotiated.
The story is made up of six
inter-connecting parts; the plot is
circular. The very first word of
part one and of the book, is the
name of part six and the last word
in the book: "Ashtabula." "Ash
tabula" is the mythic place that
is established out of and through
Soditan's correspondence with his
American pen pal Wade Cudeback.
Reversing the traditional 19th
century explorer's narratives —

the best exam
ple of which is
Livingstone
and his "Mis
sionary Tra
vels" which he
sent in install
ments in letter
form to Eng
land as he was
discovering
"new" ground
— Soyinka has
an American
sending ac-

counts of his
travels in the United States to a
Nigerian.
He, Soditan, tries to imagine
this "Ashtabula" in the way the
English were invited to imagine
Africa, and can only see it as
belonging to the "Indians ( who)
were the real owners of the Amer
ican continent."
Soditan thus, in his refusal to
imagine something unknown to
him in terms that are known,
refuses to repeat Livingstone's
cognizance and reconnaissance of
Africa from the point of view of
an all-knowing and all
encompassing Englishman. Ash
tabula becomes a place that needs
to be negotiated, in order for it

to exist. It becomes a place where
political commitment is required
and history is carried on the
shoulders of its people.
"Isara" narrates this history in
a very engaged and engaging man
ner. Shifting from the general to
the particular, from world histor
ical events like World War II to
the politics of a small town like
Isara, from the political situation
in Isara to the way it affects the
small community of exiles from
Isara, the book demonstrates that
the first world and third world
are not each other's civilizational
o hers.
Having Wade Cudeback, upon
his arrival in Isara, repeat Stan
ley's famous words to Livingstone
in his "Teacher Soditan, I
presume?" Soyinka rewrites his
tory in order to demonstrate this
merging of English and Nigerian
history.
Although Cudeback places him
in the tradition of the great white
missionaries, Soditan's "Welcome
to Ashtabula" response under
mines that move by reminding
him that just as "Ashtabula" is
"Indian" even though that owner
ship has been displaced, Isara is
"African" and Livingstone's and
the colonizers' ownership has
been displaced. The legacy they
left behind is explored in "Isara,"
as is the resistance and critical
transformation of that legacy.
Substituting "Ashtabula" for
Isara, is also Soditan/Soyinka's
way of reminding the reader of
those violent linguistic, territorial
and bodily inscriptions or
markings that translated the
Africa that was (with all its his

tory, customs, people, passions
and politics as we see in Isara) to
the "Africa" we have come to
know from travelogues, hunting
and commercial expeditions,
Banana Republic stores, popular
fiction and film.
These translations and viola
tions came into being because the
West needed that oppositional
other against which to define it
self, and through which it could
support itself economically and in
tellectually. Thus the myth of the
"heart of darkness" was born: a
myth that existed only due to the
projected fantasies and worries of
the white men about themselves

and their own dark side. In this
way the stereotypes of the "lazy
African" and the "sly Oriental"
were created: as a result of the
white man's anxieties about his
own deeds towards these people
in the process of his colonizing of
them.
The Isara that he comes to see,
Soditan seems to be telling
Cudeback, is only another "Ash
tabula" for him, since he is only
a tourist who, like all tourists,
carries the metaphor and intellec
tual baggage of his imaginary
town wherever he goes. That town
could be anywhere in the world,
though Cudeback (well meaning
as he is) in his account of it, only
serves to turn it into another ver
sion of "Ashtabula."
Like the well-meaning critics of
and on "Africa," in its most

serious criticism of such critics
and readers, the book tells us:
"Cudeback traveled for pleasure,
not necessity. But fsara was bereft
of choice; she pushed her sons
and daughters out, firstly to be
trained, then to earn a living."
One of these sons, Soyinka, earns
his living as a writer.
It is through his efforts that
Isara/Nigeria has shifted from its
position in our collective imagina
tion as a "fabulous" place and
become a country with a national
identity that is manifested in its
history and literature, both of
which are portrayed in "Isara."

Letter writing, messages both
sent and received and the space
that is constructed in this com
munication, is the major theme
in Nobel Prize-winning Nigerian
author Wole Soyinka's latest book
"Isara: A Voyage Around Essay."
A message in the form of a let
ter about the death of his father
and a message in the form of an
unopened-till-"years later" tin
box, were the occasions for the
writing of the book, Soyinka in
forms us in the preface.
Unable to go to his father's fu
neral because he was exiled from
Nigeria, Soyinka sent a taped mes
sage instead. Years later, after
finding a tin box belonging to his
mother and seeing the various
bits and pieces of the past that it
contained, the memory of that
past and his anger at not being
able to see his father for a last
time, compelled him to write
"Isara."
Written as fragments from an

incomplete childhood mem
ory of the roughly 15-

year period before,
during and after

World War 11,
"Isara," in the

words of its
author, rep-

resents:
"the

period when a pattern of (the lives
of his father and his friends) was
set — for better or worse — under
the compelling impact of the
megor events in their times, both
local and global, the uneasy love
hate relationship with the colonial
presence, and its own ambiguous
attitudes towards the Western
educated elite of the Nigerian
protectorate."
Alternating between first and
third person narratives, the book
is both a per-

sonal and his
torical account
of the life and
times of a
Nigerian vil
lage and its in
habitants.
It tells us of
the intrigues,
the failed eco
nom i c ven
tures, the
formation of a
community in

exile, the power
of the exiled and this power's ef
fects.
Soditan, a schoolteacher and the
main character of the book, tells
us the story of his friends and
family, their life in Isara and their
life away from it. The omniscient
narrator also tells us of Soditan
and his friends' attempts at es
tablishing a new order, a new gov
ernment and a new political
stability out of their ex-colonial
— or newly acquired — freedom.
In these efforts and in the book
itself, education is made a priority.

colonizers are negotiated.
The story is made up of six
inter-connecting parts; the plot is
circular. The very first word of
part one and of the book, is the
name of part six and the last word
in the book: "Ashtabula." "Ash
tabula" is the mythic place that
is established out of and through
Soditan's correspondence with his
American pen pal Wade Cudeback.
Reversing the traditional 19th
century explorer's narratives —

the best exam
ple of which is
Livingstone
and his "Mis
sionary Tra
vels" which he
sent in install
ments in letter
form to Eng
land as he was
discovering
"new" ground
— Soyinka has
an American
sending ac-

counts of his
travels in the United States to a
Nigerian.
He, Soditan, tries to imagine
this "Ashtabula" in the way the
English were invited to imagine
Africa, and can only see it as
belonging to the "Indians ( who)
were the real owners of the Amer
ican continent."
Soditan thus, in his refusal to
imagine something unknown to
him in terms that are known,
refuses to repeat Livingstone's
cognizance and reconnaissance of
Africa from the point of view of
an all-knowing and all
encompassing Englishman. Ash
tabula becomes a place that needs
to be negotiated, in order for it

to exist. It becomes a place where
political commitment is required
and history is carried on the
shoulders of its people.
"Isara" narrates this history in
a very engaged and engaging man
ner. Shifting from the general to
the particular, from world histor
ical events like World War II to
the politics of a small town like
Isara, from the political situation
in Isara to the way it affects the
small community of exiles from
Isara, the book demonstrates that
the first world and third world
are not each other's civilizational
o hers.
Having Wade Cudeback, upon
his arrival in Isara, repeat Stan
ley's famous words to Livingstone
in his "Teacher Soditan, I
presume?" Soyinka rewrites his
tory in order to demonstrate this
merging of English and Nigerian
history.
Although Cudeback places him
in the tradition of the great white
missionaries, Soditan's "Welcome
to Ashtabula" response under
mines that move by reminding
him that just as "Ashtabula" is
"Indian" even though that owner
ship has been displaced, Isara is
"African" and Livingstone's and
the colonizers' ownership has
been displaced. The legacy they
left behind is explored in "Isara,"
as is the resistance and critical
transformation of that legacy.
Substituting "Ashtabula" for
Isara, is also Soditan/Soyinka's
way of reminding the reader of
those violent linguistic, territorial
and bodily inscriptions or
markings that translated the
Africa that was (with all its his

tory, customs, people, passions
and politics as we see in Isara) to
the "Africa" we have come to
know from travelogues, hunting
and commercial expeditions,
Banana Republic stores, popular
fiction and film.
These translations and viola
tions came into being because the
West needed that oppositional
other against which to define it
self, and through which it could
support itself economically and in
tellectually. Thus the myth of the
"heart of darkness" was born: a
myth that existed only due to the
projected fantasies and worries of
the white men about themselves

and their own dark side. In this
way the stereotypes of the "lazy
African" and the "sly Oriental"
were created: as a result of the
white man's anxieties about his
own deeds towards these people
in the process of his colonizing of
them.
The Isara that he comes to see,
Soditan seems to be telling
Cudeback, is only another "Ash
tabula" for him, since he is only
a tourist who, like all tourists,
carries the metaphor and intellec
tual baggage of his imaginary
town wherever he goes. That town
could be anywhere in the world,
though Cudeback (well meaning
as he is) in his account of it, only
serves to turn it into another ver
sion of "Ashtabula."
Like the well-meaning critics of
and on "Africa," in its most

serious criticism of such critics
and readers, the book tells us:
"Cudeback traveled for pleasure,
not necessity. But fsara was bereft
of choice; she pushed her sons
and daughters out, firstly to be
trained, then to earn a living."
One of these sons, Soyinka, earns
his living as a writer.
It is through his efforts that
Isara/Nigeria has shifted from its
position in our collective imagina
tion as a "fabulous" place and
become a country with a national
identity that is manifested in its
history and literature, both of
which are portrayed in "Isara."
