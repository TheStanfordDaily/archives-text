Historians of Africa often think
of themselves as battling Western
misconceptions about the contin
ent and its people. Unfortunately,
most of these historians have been
guilty of addressing only each
other, rarely writing books com
prehensible and palatable to non
specialists.
With "Mau Mau: An African
Crucible," his second popular his
tory in two years, Robert Edger
ton confirms himself as one of
the handful of scholars writing
African history for a general read
ership. Like Basil Davidson's
popular histories, and Julie
Frederickse's two imaginative,
scrap-book format studies of
Southern Africa, Edgerton's book
aims to change its audience's

preconceived notions of Africa.
Edgerton has chosen his subject
well. Mau Mau, a violent African
uprising against colonialism, con
vulsed Kenya from 1952 to the
end of the decade. Though the
movement paved the way for
Kenya's independence in 1963, in
the West, Mau Mau was — and
remains — popularly misun
derstood.
Much of the popular misconcep
tion stems from Robert Ruark's
best-selling 1955 novel, "Someth
ing of Value." Ruark champions
the viewpoint of Kenya's white
settlers: Europeans sometimes
treated Africans callously, but
meant well, and knew what was
best for a benighted people only
a half-step removed from a dim,
savage past. Mau Mau, wrote
Ruark, was a reversion to that
savagery.
Ruark portrayed Africans as
morally debased, but usually
harmless and loyal to whites.

Africans had skills and wise tradi
tions, and might be respected and
relied upon in much the same
manner as a well-trained, beloved
horse; but they were ill-equipped
for the rules and sensibilities of
the modern world, and needed the
firm guiding hand of whites. A
few unscrupulous, over-educated
Africans dragged Kenya into Mau
Mau, controlling blindly super
stitious masses through elaborate
oathing rituals. Settler counter
violence, though gruesome and
tragic, was necessary for the cause
of civilization.
Historians have been shredding
the racist assumptions and often
wild inaccuracies of the
Ruark'settler view since the early
19605. Edgerton, though, is the
first to take the message to the
public that only knows "Someth
ing of Value," and that, lacking
an alternative, still accepts it as
true. "Mau Mau: An African
Crucible" provides a firm correc

tive, for which Edgerton deserves
congratulations, thanks and a
wide audience.
"Mau Mau" takes the opposite
view from Ruark. Here, the set
tlers are bad, really bad. Edgerton
sees their depredations against
Africans, their extreme racism
and "their fierce self interest" as
the roots of Mau Mau. Europeans
are not painted as uniformly evil;
nor are all Africans models of
decency and decorum, although he
holds that nationalism and resis
tance to oppression justified
African revolt. Edgerton sums up
his overall outlook by quoting
C.L.R. James: "The cruelties of
property and privilege are always
more ferocious than the revenges
of poverty and oppression."
Within that, Edgerton tries to un
derstand everyone, but not let
anybody off the hook easily. So
far, so good.
Readers familiar with Mau
Mau, however, may be dis
satisfied. The publisher's jacket
summary claims a number of
"firsts" for "Mau Mau" that are
mirrors and nonsense. The book
mostly draws on published
sources, and though Edgerton has
created his own synthesis, few of
the research findings are his.
Fault here lies not with the au
thor, but with a publisher that
misrepresents him and wishes
away the original work of others.
Nevertheless, the blurb puts
"Mau Mau" under a cloud even
before the binding has been
cracked.
Other problems are of Edger
ton's own doing. In the first third
of the book, on the background
to the uprising, Edgerton spills
so much ink vilifying the settlers
that he ends up putting them at
the center of the story. The book
is fundamentally weakened by its
lack of a coherent African history
of Kenya before Mau Mau.
While settler evil is plumbed to
its depths, Edgerton presents
African society in small bits and
pieces, as momentary reflections
of what the settlers begat. No
cogent picture of Kenyan African
society under colonialism
emerges. And it soon gets
tiresome to see Africans mainly
through the eyes of wrong-headed
Europeans.

Because Edgerton never ex
amines African social dynamics,
his analysis of Mau Mau's causes
has no bite. The book touches on
African concerns: seizure of much
of their land for white settlement;
the stuffing of Africans into over
crowded Native Reserves; the
growing gap between richer
Africans and central Kenya's
newly landless, who worked for
settlers and squatted on settler
land, or drifted into towns. But
Edgerton's treatment of these fac
tors is so piecemeal and fractured
that the interconnections between
them are lost.
As a result, Edgerton ends up
building his book around charac
ter sketches and anecdotes.
Though the sketches and stories
often contradict each other, he
doesn't reconcile or acknowledge
the contradictions in an overall
explanatory structure. Driving
home again and again what a
nasty bunch the settlers were is
simply not enough of a framework
to make sense of the material.
Some of his anecdotes and bio
sketches badly misfire. When in

troducing Jomo Kenyatta, a
prominent politician and orator
who became Kenya's first presi
dent, Edgerton states that while
in Europe, Kenyatta attended one
of Hitler's earliest rallies, where
"he may have absorbed some of
Hitler'B skills in controlling a large
crowd."
Later, Edgerton describes an
other African politician, Tom
Mboya, as a "radical" because by
the late 1950s he advocated
Kenya's independence. Never
mind that Mboya was fiercely
anti-communist, pulled African
trade unions out of anti colonial
politics (in contrast, for instance,
to South African trade unions
today) and was on the CLA payroll
during the Kennedy administra
tion. Edgerton makes many
similar throw-away comments
that call into question his judg
ment and grasp of the nuances of
his subject matter.

ground social dynamics, it im

Officers of the Kenya Regiment round up men end boys suspected of supporting Mau Mau Insurgents

fighting of the 19505. Edgerton's
anecdotal style serves him better
for describing the combatants and
their war. His chapter on the Mau
Mau forest fighters effectively
traces their development from a
rag-tag, clumsy conglomeration
into a series of small, highly dis
ciplined fighting groups, whose
stamina and intimate knowledge
of their environment made them
astonishingly mobile and difficult
to track. But they were increas
ingly confined within the forests,
and their struggle was whittled
down to evading capture.
Edgerton's descriptions of white
response to Mau Mau and of the
detention camps designed to
"cleanse" suspects of their Mau
Mau oaths make for his best chap
ters on Europeans. He gives a
graphic, unnervingly effective ac
count of white bloodlust, racism
and rage, providing a grisly expose
of both random and systematic
brutalization. For a few years,
from 1952, it was virtually open
season for settlers to summarily
torture, maim or kill any central-
Kenya African who they thought
was 'acting suspiciously.' Larger
scale government "sweeps" of
African villages and urban neigh
borhoods netted tens of thousands
of supposed suspects for detention

camp "shock" treatment.
These chapters show how the
colonial and British Governments
blithely overlooked regularized —
and highly illegal — torture, and
covered up, papered over or just
ignored hundreds of killings, until
word of a 1959 detention camp
massacre leaked out to the world
press. When other atrocities were
unearthed, the Kenya government
declared an amnesty for everyone
on all sides of Mau Mau, and
ended its formal state of emer
gency. Roughly, 80 Europeans and
11,000 Africans had been killed.
Edgerton's last narrative chap
ter gives a clear and succinct sum
mary of Kenya's much-studied
transition to independence. The
British government could no
longer justify the financial and
moral costs of white rule, in the
face of African nationalism and
changing world beliefs about im
perialism. London looked to hand
political control of Kenya to
Africans. To most settlers' horror,
Jomo Kenyatta was released from
prison, then elected to the highest
office in the land; to their relief,
Kenyatta finally proved that he
was not the "leader to darkness
and death" they had long imag
ined him to be.
As Edgerton shows, Mau Mau
supporters, too, found that
Kenyatta was not the man they
had imagined. He told im
poverished ex-Mau Mau, who had
fought for land as much as for

freedom, that all private property
(including loyalist Africans'
seizures of Mau Mau supporters'
land) would be upheld. Only those
who could afford to buy land
would get it.
Kenyatta preached that Mau
Mau should be forgiven and, more
pointedly, forgotten by all. Public
figures who insisted on remem
bering, especially with regard to
African land claims, were
ostracized from the ruling elite.
The poor who had fought for Mau
Mau and the promise of a better
future for the most part sank
deeper into poverty.
"Mau Mau: An African
Crucible" will serve general
readers well. It moves briskly,
shocks, educates and entertains.
It is not really for historians of
Africa — they would fault the
book's lack of analytical weight
and Edgerton's uncertain control
over the material. A more thor
ough study would work a well
reasoned interpretation through
the narrative, handle its sources
better, and offer a more coherent
picture of the dynamics of African
society. An overview on Mau Mau
satisfying to both scholars and a
larger audience could no doubt be
written, but it hasn't been yet.

Mau Mau: An African Crucible
By Robert B. Edgerton
The Free Press, $22.95
Reviewed by Bill Bravman
Historians of Africa often think
of themselves as battling Western
misconceptions about the contin
ent and its people. Unfortunately,
most of these historians have been
guilty of addressing only each
other, rarely writing books com
prehensible and palatable to non
specialists.
With "Mau Mau: An African
Crucible," his second popular his
tory in two years, Robert Edger
ton confirms himself as one of
the handful of scholars writing
African history for a general read
ership. Like Basil Davidson's
popular histories, and Julie
Frederickse's two imaginative,
scrap-book format studies of
Southern Africa, Edgerton's book
aims to change its audience's

preconceived notions of Africa.
Edgerton has chosen his subject
well. Mau Mau, a violent African
uprising against colonialism, con
vulsed Kenya from 1952 to the
end of the decade. Though the
movement paved the way for
Kenya's independence in 1963, in
the West, Mau Mau was — and
remains — popularly misun
derstood.
Much of the popular misconcep
tion stems from Robert Ruark's
best-selling 1955 novel, "Someth
ing of Value." Ruark champions
the viewpoint of Kenya's white
settlers: Europeans sometimes
treated Africans callously, but
meant well, and knew what was
best for a benighted people only
a half-step removed from a dim,
savage past. Mau Mau, wrote
Ruark, was a reversion to that
savagery.
Ruark portrayed Africans as
morally debased, but usually
harmless and loyal to whites.

Africans had skills and wise tradi
tions, and might be respected and
relied upon in much the same
manner as a well-trained, beloved
horse; but they were ill-equipped
for the rules and sensibilities of
the modern world, and needed the
firm guiding hand of whites. A
few unscrupulous, over-educated
Africans dragged Kenya into Mau
Mau, controlling blindly super
stitious masses through elaborate
oathing rituals. Settler counter
violence, though gruesome and
tragic, was necessary for the cause
of civilization.
Historians have been shredding
the racist assumptions and often
wild inaccuracies of the
Ruark'settler view since the early
19605. Edgerton, though, is the
first to take the message to the
public that only knows "Someth
ing of Value," and that, lacking
an alternative, still accepts it as
true. "Mau Mau: An African
Crucible" provides a firm correc

tive, for which Edgerton deserves
congratulations, thanks and a
wide audience.
"Mau Mau" takes the opposite
view from Ruark. Here, the set
tlers are bad, really bad. Edgerton
sees their depredations against
Africans, their extreme racism
and "their fierce self interest" as
the roots of Mau Mau. Europeans
are not painted as uniformly evil;
nor are all Africans models of
decency and decorum, although he
holds that nationalism and resis
tance to oppression justified
African revolt. Edgerton sums up
his overall outlook by quoting
C.L.R. James: "The cruelties of
property and privilege are always
more ferocious than the revenges
of poverty and oppression."
Within that, Edgerton tries to un
derstand everyone, but not let
anybody off the hook easily. So
far, so good.
Readers familiar with Mau
Mau, however, may be dis
satisfied. The publisher's jacket
summary claims a number of
"firsts" for "Mau Mau" that are
mirrors and nonsense. The book
mostly draws on published
sources, and though Edgerton has
created his own synthesis, few of
the research findings are his.
Fault here lies not with the au
thor, but with a publisher that
misrepresents him and wishes
away the original work of others.
Nevertheless, the blurb puts
"Mau Mau" under a cloud even
before the binding has been
cracked.
Other problems are of Edger
ton's own doing. In the first third
of the book, on the background
to the uprising, Edgerton spills
so much ink vilifying the settlers
that he ends up putting them at
the center of the story. The book
is fundamentally weakened by its
lack of a coherent African history
of Kenya before Mau Mau.
While settler evil is plumbed to
its depths, Edgerton presents
African society in small bits and
pieces, as momentary reflections
of what the settlers begat. No
cogent picture of Kenyan African
society under colonialism
emerges. And it soon gets
tiresome to see Africans mainly
through the eyes of wrong-headed
Europeans.

Because Edgerton never ex
amines African social dynamics,
his analysis of Mau Mau's causes
has no bite. The book touches on
African concerns: seizure of much
of their land for white settlement;
the stuffing of Africans into over
crowded Native Reserves; the
growing gap between richer
Africans and central Kenya's
newly landless, who worked for
settlers and squatted on settler
land, or drifted into towns. But
Edgerton's treatment of these fac
tors is so piecemeal and fractured
that the interconnections between
them are lost.
As a result, Edgerton ends up
building his book around charac
ter sketches and anecdotes.
Though the sketches and stories
often contradict each other, he
doesn't reconcile or acknowledge
the contradictions in an overall
explanatory structure. Driving
home again and again what a
nasty bunch the settlers were is
simply not enough of a framework
to make sense of the material.
Some of his anecdotes and bio
sketches badly misfire. When in

troducing Jomo Kenyatta, a
prominent politician and orator
who became Kenya's first presi
dent, Edgerton states that while
in Europe, Kenyatta attended one
of Hitler's earliest rallies, where
"he may have absorbed some of
Hitler'B skills in controlling a large
crowd."
Later, Edgerton describes an
other African politician, Tom
Mboya, as a "radical" because by
the late 1950s he advocated
Kenya's independence. Never
mind that Mboya was fiercely
anti-communist, pulled African
trade unions out of anti colonial
politics (in contrast, for instance,
to South African trade unions
today) and was on the CLA payroll
during the Kennedy administra
tion. Edgerton makes many
similar throw-away comments
that call into question his judg
ment and grasp of the nuances of
his subject matter.
If "Mau Mau" is weak on back
ground social dynamics, it im
proves as it moves into the actual

Officers of the Kenya Regiment round up men end boys suspected of supporting Mau Mau Insurgents

fighting of the 19505. Edgerton's
anecdotal style serves him better
for describing the combatants and
their war. His chapter on the Mau
Mau forest fighters effectively
traces their development from a
rag-tag, clumsy conglomeration
into a series of small, highly dis
ciplined fighting groups, whose
stamina and intimate knowledge
of their environment made them
astonishingly mobile and difficult
to track. But they were increas
ingly confined within the forests,
and their struggle was whittled
down to evading capture.
Edgerton's descriptions of white
response to Mau Mau and of the
detention camps designed to
"cleanse" suspects of their Mau
Mau oaths make for his best chap
ters on Europeans. He gives a
graphic, unnervingly effective ac
count of white bloodlust, racism
and rage, providing a grisly expose
of both random and systematic
brutalization. For a few years,
from 1952, it was virtually open
season for settlers to summarily
torture, maim or kill any central-
Kenya African who they thought
was 'acting suspiciously.' Larger
scale government "sweeps" of
African villages and urban neigh
borhoods netted tens of thousands
of supposed suspects for detention

camp "shock" treatment.
These chapters show how the
colonial and British Governments
blithely overlooked regularized —
and highly illegal — torture, and
covered up, papered over or just
ignored hundreds of killings, until
word of a 1959 detention camp
massacre leaked out to the world
press. When other atrocities were
unearthed, the Kenya government
declared an amnesty for everyone
on all sides of Mau Mau, and
ended its formal state of emer
gency. Roughly, 80 Europeans and
11,000 Africans had been killed.
Edgerton's last narrative chap
ter gives a clear and succinct sum
mary of Kenya's much-studied
transition to independence. The
British government could no
longer justify the financial and
moral costs of white rule, in the
face of African nationalism and
changing world beliefs about im
perialism. London looked to hand
political control of Kenya to
Africans. To most settlers' horror,
Jomo Kenyatta was released from
prison, then elected to the highest
office in the land; to their relief,
Kenyatta finally proved that he
was not the "leader to darkness
and death" they had long imag
ined him to be.
As Edgerton shows, Mau Mau
supporters, too, found that
Kenyatta was not the man they
had imagined. He told im
poverished ex-Mau Mau, who had
fought for land as much as for

freedom, that all private property
(including loyalist Africans'
seizures of Mau Mau supporters'
land) would be upheld. Only those
who could afford to buy land
would get it.

Jomo Kenyatta was released from
prison, then elected to the highest
office in the land; to their relief,
Kenyatta finally proved that he
was not the "leader to darkness

As Edgerton shows, Mau Mau
supporters, too, found that
Kenyatta was not the man they
had imagined. He told im
poverished ex-Mau Mau, who had
fought for land as much as for

freedom, that all private property
(including loyalist Africans'
seizures of Mau Mau supporters'
land) would be upheld. Only those
who could afford to buy land

Kenyatta preached that Mau
Mau should be forgiven and, more
pointedly, forgotten by all. Public
figures who insisted on remem

African land claims, were

Mau Mau: An African Crucible
By Robert B. Edgerton
The Free Press, $22.95
Reviewed by Bill Bravman
Historians of Africa often think
of themselves as battling Western
misconceptions about the contin
ent and its people. Unfortunately,
most of these historians have been
guilty of addressing only each
other, rarely writing books com
prehensible and palatable to non
specialists.
With "Mau Mau: An African
Crucible," his second popular his
tory in two years, Robert Edger
ton confirms himself as one of
the handful of scholars writing
African history for a general read
ership. Like Basil Davidson's
popular histories, and Julie
Frederickse's two imaginative,
scrap-book format studies of
Southern Africa, Edgerton's book
aims to change its audience's

preconceived notions of Africa.
Edgerton has chosen his subject
well. Mau Mau, a violent African
uprising against colonialism, con
vulsed Kenya from 1952 to the
end of the decade. Though the
movement paved the way for
Kenya's independence in 1963, in
the West, Mau Mau was — and
remains — popularly misun
derstood.
Much of the popular misconcep
tion stems from Robert Ruark's
best-selling 1955 novel, "Someth
ing of Value." Ruark champions
the viewpoint of Kenya's white
settlers: Europeans sometimes
treated Africans callously, but
meant well, and knew what was
best for a benighted people only
a half-step removed from a dim,
savage past. Mau Mau, wrote
Ruark, was a reversion to that
savagery.
Ruark portrayed Africans as
morally debased, but usually
harmless and loyal to whites.

Africans had skills and wise tradi
tions, and might be respected and
relied upon in much the same
manner as a well-trained, beloved
horse; but they were ill-equipped
for the rules and sensibilities of
the modern world, and needed the
firm guiding hand of whites. A
few unscrupulous, over-educated
Africans dragged Kenya into Mau
Mau, controlling blindly super
stitious masses through elaborate
oathing rituals. Settler counter
violence, though gruesome and
tragic, was necessary for the cause
of civilization.
Historians have been shredding
the racist assumptions and often
wild inaccuracies of the
Ruark'settler view since the early
19605. Edgerton, though, is the
first to take the message to the
public that only knows "Someth
ing of Value," and that, lacking
an alternative, still accepts it as
true. "Mau Mau: An African
Crucible" provides a firm correc

tive, for which Edgerton deserves
congratulations, thanks and a
wide audience.
"Mau Mau" takes the opposite
view from Ruark. Here, the set
tlers are bad, really bad. Edgerton
sees their depredations against
Africans, their extreme racism
and "their fierce self interest" as
the roots of Mau Mau. Europeans
are not painted as uniformly evil;
nor are all Africans models of
decency and decorum, although he
holds that nationalism and resis
tance to oppression justified
African revolt. Edgerton sums up
his overall outlook by quoting
C.L.R. James: "The cruelties of
property and privilege are always
more ferocious than the revenges
of poverty and oppression."
Within that, Edgerton tries to un
derstand everyone, but not let
anybody off the hook easily. So
far, so good.
Readers familiar with Mau
Mau, however, may be dis
satisfied. The publisher's jacket
summary claims a number of
"firsts" for "Mau Mau" that are
mirrors and nonsense. The book
mostly draws on published
sources, and though Edgerton has
created his own synthesis, few of
the research findings are his.
Fault here lies not with the au
thor, but with a publisher that
misrepresents him and wishes
away the original work of others.
Nevertheless, the blurb puts
"Mau Mau" under a cloud even
before the binding has been
cracked.
Other problems are of Edger
ton's own doing. In the first third
of the book, on the background
to the uprising, Edgerton spills
so much ink vilifying the settlers
that he ends up putting them at
the center of the story. The book
is fundamentally weakened by its
lack of a coherent African history
of Kenya before Mau Mau.
While settler evil is plumbed to
its depths, Edgerton presents
African society in small bits and
pieces, as momentary reflections
of what the settlers begat. No
cogent picture of Kenyan African
society under colonialism
emerges. And it soon gets
tiresome to see Africans mainly
through the eyes of wrong-headed
Europeans.

Because Edgerton never ex
amines African social dynamics,
his analysis of Mau Mau's causes
has no bite. The book touches on
African concerns: seizure of much
of their land for white settlement;
the stuffing of Africans into over
crowded Native Reserves; the
growing gap between richer
Africans and central Kenya's
newly landless, who worked for
settlers and squatted on settler
land, or drifted into towns. But
Edgerton's treatment of these fac
tors is so piecemeal and fractured
that the interconnections between
them are lost.
As a result, Edgerton ends up
building his book around charac
ter sketches and anecdotes.
Though the sketches and stories
often contradict each other, he
doesn't reconcile or acknowledge
the contradictions in an overall
explanatory structure. Driving
home again and again what a
nasty bunch the settlers were is
simply not enough of a framework
to make sense of the material.
Some of his anecdotes and bio
sketches badly misfire. When in

troducing Jomo Kenyatta, a
prominent politician and orator
who became Kenya's first presi
dent, Edgerton states that while
in Europe, Kenyatta attended one
of Hitler's earliest rallies, where
"he may have absorbed some of
Hitler'B skills in controlling a large
crowd."
Later, Edgerton describes an
other African politician, Tom
Mboya, as a "radical" because by
the late 1950s he advocated
Kenya's independence. Never
mind that Mboya was fiercely
anti-communist, pulled African
trade unions out of anti colonial
politics (in contrast, for instance,
to South African trade unions
today) and was on the CLA payroll
during the Kennedy administra
tion. Edgerton makes many
similar throw-away comments
that call into question his judg
ment and grasp of the nuances of
his subject matter.
If "Mau Mau" is weak on back
ground social dynamics, it im
proves as it moves into the actual


■Mau Mau An African Crucible'
Officers of the Kenya Regiment round up men end boys suspected of supporting Mau Mau Insurgents

torture and death threats while Interrogating their prisoners.

fighting of the 19505. Edgerton's
anecdotal style serves him better
for describing the combatants and
their war. His chapter on the Mau
Mau forest fighters effectively
traces their development from a
rag-tag, clumsy conglomeration
into a series of small, highly dis
ciplined fighting groups, whose
stamina and intimate knowledge
of their environment made them
astonishingly mobile and difficult
to track. But they were increas
ingly confined within the forests,
and their struggle was whittled
down to evading capture.
Edgerton's descriptions of white
response to Mau Mau and of the
detention camps designed to
"cleanse" suspects of their Mau
Mau oaths make for his best chap
ters on Europeans. He gives a
graphic, unnervingly effective ac
count of white bloodlust, racism
and rage, providing a grisly expose
of both random and systematic
brutalization. For a few years,
from 1952, it was virtually open
season for settlers to summarily
torture, maim or kill any central-
Kenya African who they thought
was 'acting suspiciously.' Larger
scale government "sweeps" of
African villages and urban neigh
borhoods netted tens of thousands
of supposed suspects for detention

camp "shock" treatment.
These chapters show how the
colonial and British Governments
blithely overlooked regularized —
and highly illegal — torture, and
covered up, papered over or just
ignored hundreds of killings, until
word of a 1959 detention camp
massacre leaked out to the world
press. When other atrocities were
unearthed, the Kenya government
declared an amnesty for everyone
on all sides of Mau Mau, and
