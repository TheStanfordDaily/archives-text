Women's Basketball

Cardinal 90
Sun Devils 63

Playing its fifth game in nine days,
the Cardinal looked tired especially in
the early going. Meanwhile, not appear
ing at all intimidated by second-ranked
Stanford, the Sun Devils started quickly.
On their first two trips down the
court, Arizona State got the ball down
low to center Monique Ambers and she
responded with a pair of easy buckets.
The Sun Devils added another score
and led 6-0.
Stanford, on the other hand, came
out ice cold. The Cardinal missed its
first half dozen shots before Julie
Zeilstra finally got a hoop at the 17:28
mark.
"We were pretty lame there at the
beginning," Katy Steding said. "People
say it's hard to get up for games like
this." But Steding noted that fatigue
may have played as much of a role as
anything.
Arizona State was mixing things up
defensively in an attempt to keep the
ball out of the low post. Though the
strategy was effective, it opened things
up on the perimeter and Stanford took
advantage.

Jennifer Azzi, who played 24 minutes
after missing Thursday's game with an
ankle injury, and Steding, the game's
leading scorer with 22 points, began
bombing from three-point land. Azzi
nailed three treys in the opening nine
minutes as Stanford overcame the early
deficit to move ahead 15-10.
Steding added two long bombs over
the next four minutes to key a 16-7
Cardinal run that made the score 31-17.
"Some teams let you exploit it," Steding
said of the three-pointer. "If you get it
right away, you get confident . . . The
basket keeps getting bigger and bigger."
It seemed to be bigger both ways as
the scrappy Sun Devils hit difficult shots
to keep things interesting. Freshman
guard Crystal Cobb, who entered the
game averaging less than five points,
came off the bench for Arizona State
and kept them in it with her unorthodox
jump shots.
Throwing up two-handed chucks from
all over the court, Cobb had 11 first-half
points including four in a row that cut
the Stanford lead to 31-23. She finished
with 17. "She had some tough shots,"
Steding said. "I don't know how they
went in."
With 1:52 left in the half, Stevens
was fouled. She sunk the first free
throw to raise her career point total to
1,000 and the P A. announcer let the
crowd of 2,726 know. They responded
with a loud ovation.
By halftime, the Cardinal had ex
tended its edge to 14 once again at
39-25. When the teams returned, Stan
ford wasted no time in salting the game
away. Stevens had six points and Steding
four as the Cardinal scored 17 points
while allowing Arizona State only four
in the opening 4:40 of the second stanza.
The referees called four fouls in that
span, then eight more in the subsequent
three minutes. But the stoppages of

play only delayed the inevitable for the
outmatched Sun Devils. Once again, the
Stanford offense was keyed by the bril
liant passing of Sonja Henning.
The Cardinal's point guard racked up
11 assists including pinpoint bounce
passes on the fast break and dazzling
bullets into the low post. Only once did
she turn the ball over.
Arizona State, on the other hand, had
trouble taking care of the basketball.
The Sun Devils turned it over 16 times
in the first half to allow the Cardinal
to move ahead easily. Then they
thwarted any comeback attempt by com
mitting another 12 miscues in the sec
ond half. Fifteen of the turnovers were
created by Stanford steals.
"We weren't on top of things," Steding
said of the overall effort. "We can play
a lot, a lot, a lot better.
"You have to give Arizona State cred
it, though. They knew what could hurt
us. They were able to exploit our weak
nesses," she added.
In the end, the Sun Devils were simply
unable to stay with the more talented
Cardinal. With just under nine minutes
remaining Stanford was up 66-40 and
VanDerveer began substituting.
Still, the Cardinal did its best to pro
vide some excitement for the hometown
crowd. Molly Goodenbour and Martha
Richards joined the three-point parade
and Chris MacMurdo drew cheers for
a backcourt steal and lay in. She also
completed a three-point play after
driving the lane and sinking a tough
leaner. Angela Taylor scored on a fast
break layup as well.
Card notes
VanDerveer's record here now stands at
100-37, a .730 winning percentage. Azzi was
2 of 2 at the free-throw line. For the season,
she's at .930 from the stripe — .964 in
conference games.
