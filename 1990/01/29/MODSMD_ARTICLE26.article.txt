TEMPE, Ariz. — Like all good student
athletes should, the Stanford basketball
team did some learning over the weekend.
; Instead of doing it in the classroom, how
fiver, they did it in the University Activ
ties Center at Arizona State.
• The lesson was that the Cardinal can
• afford to take no Pacific 10 Conference
! game for granted, and the teachers were
! the Sun Devils, who defeated Stanford
J 64-53 Saturday.
The Cardinal put in a lackluster per
' formance in being outhustled, out
| smarted and simply outplayed in the
I game. Stanford fell to 12-5 overall, 4-4
in the Pac-10, while ASU is now 10-8, 3-6.
"The way we played we were a half-step
slow, and it was mental, not physical,"
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"I thought they played harder than we
did, which is disappointing. . . . We just
can't have that happen."

Sun Devils 64
Cardinal 53

The Siln Devils ran a very deliberate
offense, taking 30 or more seconds off
the clock on every possession. The Car
dinal appeared to get frustrated on de
fense whvle waiting around for ASU to
shoot, and that seemed to carry over to
offense.
Stanford tried to fast break a little too
much and got careless with the ball in
the second half, resulting in 15 turnovers
and many uncontested ASU dunks and
layups.
The first half ended tied at 24 as the
Sun Devils clearly dictated the pace.
Adam Keefe, the Pac-10's second-leading
scorer didn't have a point for the Cardinal
that half as Stanford committed seven
turnovers while taking only 20 shots.
But Stanford remained in the game

because the league's fifth-best scorer,
Alex Austin, was 0 for 5 from the field
and had only four free throws for ASU.
Keefe got on the board with a short
shot only 12 seconds into the second half.
Austin and Stanford's Kenny Ammann
matched layups before ASU point guard
Mike Redhair hit a three-pointer for a
29-28 lead.
Redhair had been continually pressur
ing Stanford point guard John Patrick
most of the second half and a double-team
paid off in a steal and dunk by Austin.
Stanford then appeared to take control
with an 8-0 run to take a 36-31 lead.
A Redhair steal for another Austin
dunk stopped the run. Ammann hit a
jumper but then Cardinal turnovers
fueled a decisive 15-3 run. Keefe made
a pair af free throws to get within five
with 2:49 left but Stanford would not be
that close again.
"We just got outplayed tonight," Mont
gomery said. "Arizona State did an ex
cellent job. There are two things we can't

give up: transition baskets — layups, and
second-chance points. We got killed in
those two aspects. . . . Their offensive
rebounds hurt us because they'd run 30,
35 seconds off the clock and shoot it,
then rebound it and run 30 seconds
again."
The Sun Devils pulled down 11 offen
sive boards for the game. Austin led ASU
with 20 Brian Camper had
a career-high 15 and Redhair had 10
points and eight assists.
Andrew Vlahov led the Cardinal with
11 points and 10 rebounds. Ammann also
had 11 points and Keefe ended up with
a season-low 10 points and nine boards.
"We just didn't come out and play; we
came out flat," Keefe said. "Usually I
come out and it feels just short of having
been in a war. Right now I feel like I
didn't give 100 percent out there. I think
a few of my teammates probably feel the
same way. . . . We didn't deserve to win."
The Sun Devils played a very good
man-to-man defense the whole way and

kept Keefe out of the game. Six-foot-10,
250-pound Isaac Austin and 6-10, 232
Emory Lewis denied him the ball and
the guards helped out by double-teaming
Keefe. "I think they've done the best job
I've seen of covering down and still get
ting out to the shooters," Keefe said.
""I don't know if it was poor passing
on my part or if our guards weren't catch
ing the ball in position to shoot," he
continued. "But by the time the ball got
back outside the shot wasn't there. I
think maybe I passed up a couple of balls
I needed to take more aggressively to the
bucket."
For the game Stanford made only one
three-pointer in 11 tries, including none
in eight attempts in the second half. The
Cardinal also made only 8-of-14 free
throws, compared to ASU's 20 of 24.
The Stanford players held a team meet
ing the day before the game. The meeting
was to make sure the players would
realize the importance of the game, but
apperently it wasn't successful.
