The Stanford baseball team got 1990
off to a roaring start this weekend, teach
ing the Santa Clara Broncos a lesson in
pitching in Friday's season opener and
then using some textbook baseball to
hold on for a win yesterday.

At Santa Clara on Friday, Stanford
pitcher Stan Spencer stymied the
Broncos over six innings and the Car
dinal offense took advantage of a key
error to break the game open.
Junior Ryan Turner drove in the Car
dinal's first run with a two-out double
off Bronco starter Vince Fultz in the
second, but the big blow came in the
next inning. With two outs and catcher
Troy Tallman on third and Jeff Ham
monds at first, Fultz got two quick
strikes on David McCarty, but then
missed the plate three times in a row.
With the count full, McCarty hit a
dribbler down the third-base line, and
the race was on. Santa Clara's Nick
Mirizzi swooped in, scooped up the ball
and threw to first on a dead run. The
umpire was set to call McCarty out —
a dubious call — but then first baseman
Andy Solomon dropped the ball. Both
Tallman and Hammonds scored on the
error and when Tim Griffin doubled four
pitches later it was 4-0 Stanford.
That turned out to be more than
enough, because Spencer was putting on
a pitching clinic in the bottom half of
each inning. In his six innings of work,
Spencer gave up two singles, two fly
balls — both caught by Turner in left
field — and two pop flies. Every other
Bronco batter grounded out or struck
out.

At Sunken Diamond on Sunday, the
Cardinal again had a commanding lead
but this time let the Broncos back in
the game. Pitcher Mike Mussina, playing
in his first game since incurring an el
bow injury in the middle cf last season,
two-hit the Broncos for five innings and
seemed to be in complete control.
"I was a little tight at first," Mussina
said. "It took me awhile to get
loose. . . My off-speed stuff isn't quite
honed."
His fastball, however, was just fine,
and the Broncos got nothing through
five as Stanford built a 4-0 lead. In the
first inning shortstop Roger Burnett
picked up the team's first home run of
the year by lining a David Tuttle fastball
just over the fence in left, and it was
2-0 after Hammonds hit a two-out single
to score Holbrook in the second.
Hammonds picked up another RBI
when he tripled — with two outs — in
the fourth, and then he and Burnett
combined to write a paragraph of the
How to Play Perfect Baseball textbook.
On Tuttle's first pitch Hammonds took
off for home, and Burnett laid a sweet
bunt down the third-base line. Ham
monds was gone, so Mirizzi's only play
was to throw to first. Burnett beat the
throw, and Stanford had a four-run lead.
In the sixth, though, designated hitter
David Cornell hit a two-out shot deep
to the hole for an infield hit, and a
minute later Rick Bianchina tagged
Mussina for a roundtripper.
"He [Troy Tallmanl put down curve,
but I shook it off to a fastball and I
didn't get it in enough," Mussina said.
That was as close as the Broncos could
get, though McCarty doubled in Paul
Carey in the sixth, moved to third on
an error, and then scored on a wild pitch
to run the score to 6-2. The Broncos
scored twice in the ninth off freshman
Brian Sackinsky, but Scott Weiss came
in to get the final two outs and the save.
