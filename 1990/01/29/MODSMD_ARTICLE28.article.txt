### Baldwin Lee Editorial staff 
I he top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming team added more momentum
to an already top-notch season by rolling
over Arizona State and Arizona at
deGuerre Pool Friday and Saturday.
The Cardinal women put together a
strong meet Friday against Arizona
State, defeating the Sun Devils 104-36,
and returned Saturday to swim even
faster against a lackluster Arizona
squad, winning 117-16.
Coach Richard Quick said the team
usually swims better on the second day
of back-to-back meets, but while he "ex
pected good, we got excellent."

The Arizona State meet was charac

little punch — the Cardinal won 14 of

her under the NCAA qualifying cut for
the first time this season.
