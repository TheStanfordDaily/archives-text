I he top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming team added more momentum
to an already top-notch season by rolling
over Arizona State and Arizona at
deGuerre Pool Friday and Saturday.
The Cardinal women put together a
strong meet Friday against Arizona
State, defeating the Sun Devils 104-36,
and returned Saturday to swim even
faster against a lackluster Arizona
squad, winning 117-16.
Coach Richard Quick said the team
usually swims better on the second day
of back-to-back meets, but while he "ex
pected good, we got excellent."

Quick praised solid swimming during
the weekend "all through the lineup,"
as the Cardinal women easily disposed
of both opponents in spite of missing
three members to illness.
The Arizona State meet was charac
terized by good swims that set the team
up for Arizona. The Sun Devils put up
little punch — the Cardinal won 14 of
the 16 events. Stanford was led by Janel
Jorgensen, who won the 200 butterfly

and the 400 individual medley.
Quick said he was particularly excited
about a solid swim by sophomore Susan
Johnson, who won the 100 breaststroke.
Johnson is just coming back from a
knee injury.
In the Arizona meet, Stanford was
able to stay psychologically into a lop
sided meet by swimming against each
other and against the clock. Jill
Johnson, who won the 200 breaststroke,
provided some friendly competition for
second-place Lambert, whose 2:18.6 put
her under the NCAA qualifying cut for
the first time this season.
Quick cited Janet Evans' 9:32.6 time
in the 1000 free — 25 seconds faster
than her nearest opponent, and Jorgen
