# Bud beats flat Bud Light
## 
### 
While the drama of Super Bowl
XXIV waned soon after the San
Francisco 49ers took the field, the
heart-stopping and liver-eroding
play of Bud Bowl II kept Stanford
fans glued, or at least subdued,
in their seats.
With CBS announcers running
out of things to say in San Fran
cisco's awe-inspiring 55-10 Super
victory, attention turned off the
field for Super Bowl highlights.
In case you missed the pivotal
fourth quarter, the Bud team
came from behind to edge Bud
Light 36-34 in the second edition
of Budweiser's advertising extrav
aganza, the Bud Bowl.

"Bud Light was just foaming
over last year's loss," quipped
Cedro junior Ed Stevens, who had
been drinking Henry's at a Super
Bowl party. "Bud's looking a little
flat, but Bud Light has barley
solved its problems from last
year."
Like the 49ers, Bud won back
to-back Bud Bowls, leading some
fans to suspect that two versions
of the fourth quarter had been
filmed. If the Broncos had won,
then Bud Light, which led the
entire game, would have held on
for the suds title.
Played in "perfect beer weath
er," Bud Light went ahead 13-3
in the first quarter, and led at
halftime 20-13 on a scoring play
that faked a Bud defender "out
of his label."
Both squads tightened the caps
in the third quarter, as Bud Light
drank to a 34-30 advantage. In a
key play, Bud brought in the
vaunted Freezer, the Appliance of
Defiance, but Bud Light coun
tered with the Washer, the Dryer
and the Kitchen Sink on defense.
Bud handed to running back Billy
Bud (no offense Herman Melville)
for the crucial score.
Budweiser won the game on a
controversial last-play
fumblerooskie that bounced
through the icy end zone before
being recovered by Bud.
The final margin delighted
junior Lee Hsu, who predicted a
35-33 Bud victory before "the
game. Hsu sighted his "psychic
suds ability," with the forecast.
