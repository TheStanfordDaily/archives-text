# Stanford looks to trade technology overseas
## After successful ventures with U.S. firms, University eyes idea-swap with Italians 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
The University is looking overseas for new
markets with which to swap ideas, hoping to
add to the $11.5 million earned in 1989 from
technology transfer with American companies.
The first stop is Italy, and 19 of that coun
try's leading scientists, engineers and busines
speople met on campus Thursday and Friday
with University researchers and administra
tors to open the way for a systematic exchange
of technology with Italian universities and
corporations.
Topics at the conference included means of
expediting international scientific exchange,
as well as cooperating in studies of technology,
superconductivity, alternative energy sources,
factory automation, computer technology and
telecommunications.
Though relations between Stanford and its
Italian counterparts are still developing, since
last year the number of joint Stanford-Italian
committees in the relationship has jumped
from five to 11, and the Italian National Re
search Council has committed more than
$300,000 to the exchange.
According to John Wirth, vice provost for
academic planning and development, the
emerging ties with Italy represent a new stage
in the University's efforts to swap technology,
not only because the partner is a foreign

country, but also because the transfer involves
"multiple points of entry into Italian univer
sities and businesses."
In most cases, individual researchers estab
lish ties with private industry by transferring
information on highly specific and often
esoteric advancements. Businesses in turn
develop the research into marketable products
and return a royalty to the University.
"Our ties with Italy will be very compre
hensive, across the sciences and social sci
ences," Wirth said. "This is new for us and
a lot broader (than in the past)."
In addition to technological research, Stan
ford faculty have proposed exchanges in
studies in the humanities, logic and language,
and molecular genetics.
Wirth said the University chose Italy as its
first established overseas trading partner be
cause "they approached us first, and we were
interested."
"Italy seemed more serious and intense on
forming a relationship than other countries,"
he said. However, Wirth suggested that sys
tematic ties with Italy would represent a sig
nificant foothold for Stanford in Europe by
1992, when the European Community intends
to complete plans for large-scale integration.
Stanford's campus in Florence, Italy, may
also have contributed to the selection of Italy
as a new trading partner, but Wirth said the
center operates relatively independently of the

Italian government, and overseas technology
transfer will have to move through the normal
channels of Italian bureaucracy.
Such bureaucracy can often be monolithic,
Wirth said, but Rinaldo Petrignani, Italy's
ambassador to the United States, said the
Italian government is actively involved in fos
tering cooperation with American universities
because the exchange "is much too important
and cannot be left to the initiatives of indi
vidual businesses and universities."
Several members of the conference echoed
the need for caution in the relationship be
tween American universities and Italian busi
nesses in the world of technology transfer.
Universities must consider whether they are
compromising their independence in selling
information to private concerns. "Stanford
must not become a servant to industry," Wirth
said.
Such concern has reached violent propor
tions in Italy, as over the past few weeks
thousands of students have demonstrated in
17 cities over proposed changes in the struc
ture of Italian universities, the New York
Times reported. Demonstrations forced can
celation of classes at many schools, and pro
testers once occupied eight buildings at La
Sapienza, the main campus at the University
of Rome.
