# 49ers destroy Denver in Super Bowl XXIV
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Joe
Montana and the San Fran
cisco 49ers proved Sunday that
they have just one competitor
— history.
And history may have to
rally to catch them.
In the most one-sided Super
Bowl ever, the 49ers routed the
Denver Broncos 55-10 to be
come the first repeat NFL
champions in a decade and tie
the Pittsburgh Steelers as the
epitome of Super Bowl perfec
tion with four wins in four
tries.
"We need to do something
no team has ever done and
that's to Threepeat," said of
fensive tackle Bubba Paris,
singing "Re-re-re-pe-pe-pa
repeat."
"If they want to go for an
other one, that's fine with me,"
said George Seifert, the rookie
coach, after his team raced into
the locker room yelling
"Repeat! Repeat! Repeat!"
"Certainly, this is one of the
finest teams ever to play."
"Flawless," is the way Den
ver quarterback John Elway
described San Francisco after
being held to just 108 yards,
throwing two interceptions and
fumbling once.
Montana, 22 of 29 for 297
yards, had five touchdown
passes, three to Jerry Rice,
breaking a Super Bowl record
for TD passes. He also set a
record with 13 straight com
pletions and sent Denver to its
third Super Bowl loss in four
years and fourth overall, tying
Minnesota for futility.
San Francisco's point total
and victory margin were the
most ever in the NFL champi
onship game. Overall, Montana
holds eight individual Super
Bowl records, his teammates
nine others and the 49ers, as
a team, hold six.
"Joe's the best," said Rice,
who had seven catches for 148
yards.

It's perhaps the understate
ment of the decade.
Montana's final numbers set
career Super Bowl records for
touchdown passes, comple
tions, yards, passing attempts
and MVP awards — his third.
In his four Super Bowls, Mon
tana is 83 for 122 (68 percent)
for 1,142 yards, 11 touchdowns
and no interceptions.
"He's perhaps the greatest
quarterback who's ever played
the game," Seifert said. With
Montana's numbers, it would
be tempting to drop the "per
haps."
Montana, typically, praised
the offensive line that didn't
allow a sack in three playoff
games and a defense that
picked off two passes, forced
two fumbles and held Elway to
one completion in his first 10
attempts — a shovel pass to
Bobby Humphrey. Denver
gained just 167 yards in the
game.
"At this rate, heck, I can play
until I'm 40," said the 33-year
old Montana, who has a com
pletion rate of 78 percent in
three postseason wins by a
total of 126-26.
At that rate, he will own the
NFL record book just as the
49ers owned Sunday's game
from the opening gun. And
gave the NFC its sixth straight
Super Bowl victory.
By halftime it was 27-3 with
San Francisco playing against
the record book rather than the
Broncos, who have now been
outscored 136-40 in their four
Super Bowls.
San Francisco, meantime,
was boringly perfect. The 49ers
did even more than expected
by the experts who made them
favorites by nearly two touch
downs after a 14-2 season and
a waltz through the playoffs.
"We made brilliant
forecasters of a lot of experts,"
