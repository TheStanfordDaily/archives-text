The men *8 gymnastics team
trounced UC-Santa Barbara
271.4 to 254.9 Saturday in the
Cardinal's first home meet of
the season, showing Coach
Sadao Hamada and the
Burnham Pavilion crowd that
Stanford is tired of practice and
ready for prime time.
"My predictions for this meet
came true," said & pleased
Hamada. "It showed that our
strong events are pommel horse
and floor. The parallel and high
bars will improve with time; we
just need to do more routines
at an intense level," he said.
The first rotation of the meet,
the pommel horse, proved to be
Stanford's strongest event.

a 9.75 for his routine, the high
est score awarded by the judges
all evening. Both Conrad
Voorsanger and Charles Loop
turned in scores of 9.4 to give
Stanford a commanding lead
after one event.
This lead was never relin
quished, as the Cardinal went
on to dominate the floor exer
cise. Stanford's Timothy Wang
captured the highest score, a
9.5, despite a leg injury that
began to take its toll later in
the meet.
"I thought we had an
awesome meet," Wang said. "We

have great potential. This was
only our first real meet, and as
the season progresses we will
improve even more."
The high bar seemed to offer
the biggest challenge of the eve
ning. The level of difficulty in
the routines was high, which
led to several missed release
moves and lower scores overall.
Freshman Jeff Bender, who
scored a team high of 9.0, was
one of the few gymnasts who
could say "my high bar routine
made my meet."
The final rotation, the paral
lel bars, was highlighted by a
9.5 performance by Voorsanger,
the national champion in the
event. Voorsanger also ended up
with the highest all-around
score in the meet, followed
closely by Loop in second place
and Lynch in fifth.
