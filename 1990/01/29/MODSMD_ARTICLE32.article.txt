# Men's swimming slides past pitiful Arizona, Arizona State
## Stanford looks strong for weekend showdown 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
As the men's basketball team hurried to
return from a disappointing voyage to the
state of Arizona, the Stanford men's swim
ming team opened its conference dual meets
by lambasting two Arizona squads and
sending the swimmers of the Grand Canyon
State crawling back to their sun-baked
pools.
In combined men's and women's meets
at deGuerre Pool, the Cardinal men first
crushed Arizona State on Friday by a 74-39
score and then blasted Arizona Saturday
afternoon 101-32.

"I thought we performed well this week
end," junior J.B. Barr said. "It was a good
tune-up for next weekend's big meets down
south."
The Cardinal has two of its most impor
tant dual meets of the season on Friday
and Saturday against UCLA and USC. This
season both teams have beaten a Michigan
squad to whom Stanford lost in mid-
January.
This weekend, the Cardinal swimmers
capped off the strong performances by re
cording a pool record in the 400 freestyle
relay, the final event of Saturday's compe
tition. After just missing the record on
Friday against ASU to the disappointment
of the Cardinal spectators and team mem
bers who had cheered on nearly every

stroke, the four-class combination of senior
Doug Lillydahl, Barr, sophomore John
deGroot and freshman Erik Maurer swam
well ahead of the Arizona squad, touching
the wall in 3:00.676, over seven seconds
before the Wildcat relay finished. Despite
being just above the NCAA qualifying
standard of 2:59.53, the unshaved Cardinal
effort did wipe the only remaining Califor
nia swim off the deGuerre record books,
clearing out the 1988 Golden Bear time of
3:00.97.
"We set that time as a goal for ourselves
this weekend," Barr said. "It was great to
be able to accomplish what we set out for."
Individually, sophomore Jeff Rouse
started off Saturday's meet with an im
pressive 50.231 time in the 100 backstroke,
finishing under the NCAA qualifying time
of 50.34. The Cardinal swimmers also
dominated the 50, 100 and 1000 freestyle,
and the 200 individual medley, by sweeping
the first three spots in each of these events.
Using their performances in these meets
as a primer, the Cardinal swimmers now
prepare for their final two away dual meets
of the season in Los Angeles.
