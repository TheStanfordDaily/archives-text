"The competition was weaker
than I had hoped," said Stanford
wrestling Coach Chris Horpel, but
the Cardinal was still pleased with
its win in the All-Cal Invitational
Tournament Saturday at San
Francisco State.
The Cardinal ran away from
the rest of the field, scoring 92.25
points. The next closest team was
Chico State with 71.25. The other
teams which competed and the
order in which they finished were
San Francisco State, Humboldt
State, UC-Davis, Fresno State,
Fullerton State, and Bakersfield
State.

Because it was a weaker tourney we moved

to the tournament.
Coach Horpel said, "Because it
was a weaker tourney we moved
from wanting to be a top 2-3 finis
her, to expecting to win."
Stanford had three weight class
champions at the invitational.
The most exciting match took
place in the 190-pound weight
class. Stanford's Ron Perry was
tied with Ray Bon Johnson going
■into the last poruui. JP.ocj;y had
1:01 of advantage time in his fa
vor, and if a wl-estler has over a
minute at the end of the match

he is awarded a point.
Instead of starting in the down
position, which is normal for Per
ry, he chose to start neutral (with
both wrestlers standing), in order
to avoid losing his advantage time.
No one scored in the third round,
so the advantage turned out to
be the deciding point in a 4-3 bout.
Mark Graham (167) of Stanford
also had an impressive day. He
worked his way into the finals
were he took apart Humboldt
State's Mike Halket, 16-2.
The other weight class winner

for the Cardinal was Steve Buddie
(177). Buddie has only lost twice
this year. Yesterday, he did not
lose at all, as he defeated Dean
Heath, 9-1, in the finals.
Another Stanford wrestler who
had an outstanding day was Josh
Lisle. Lisle took home the award
for the most pins in the least
amount of time. He scored three
in 4:57. He finished third in the
126-pound weight class.
The Cardinal had a wrestler
place in each of the weight classes
at the tournament.
Those who placed were Dave
Nowick, third (118); Mark For
man, fourth (134); James Dinette,
second (142); Geoff Baum, second
(150); Mike Garrison, fourth
(150); Matt Topham, second
(158); Tommy Vardell, third
(HW); and Scott Palmbush,
fourth (HW).
