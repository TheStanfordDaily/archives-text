# Top-ranked spikers toppled by UCLA

The specter of invincibility
cloaking the Stanford men's vol
leyball team throughout the early
stages of the 1990 season was un
ceremoniously cast away this past
weekend.
After ruthlessly dismembering
preliminary competition en route
to the championship game of the
UC-Santa Barbara-Michelob
Light Collegiate Invitational, the
unscathed Cardinal fell abruptly
to arch-rival UCLA in four games
15-12, 4-15, 5-15, 7-15.

Stanford's early play in the
tournament certainly predicated a
more favorable outcome. The Car
dinal made quick work of its first
seven opponents defeating each in
two straight games.
Included among the fallen were
Pepperdine and Long Beach State,
both of whom are ranked in the

top five of most national volleyball
polls, and BYU and UC-Santa
Barbara, teams that Volleyball
Monthly noted as contenders in
its college preview issue.
After dismissing Long Beach
State for the second time this
season (previously, both the Car
dinal's starting team and reserve
team placed ahead of Long Beach
at an exhibition tourney), Stan
ford impressively qualified for the
championship match as the only
undefeated team in the tourna
ment and appeared formidable as
the squad prepared to defend its
No. 1 national ranking.

Due largely to a sudden inability
to "pass well" and to "stop the
quick attack," assistant coach
Ruben Nieves explained, Stanford
was instantly victimized in the
finals by the blocking of UCLA,
which had qualified for the match
on a tie-breaker.
After jumping quickly to a 3-0
lead in the first game, the Car
dinal, aided by the heroics of
Jimmy Klein, was able to fend off
a late UCLA run in the first game
and prevail 15-12. After that,
Nieves conceded, "we were out
passed and outserved by UCI.A."
