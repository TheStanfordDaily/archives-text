# Card gymnasts split
## 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
Scoring season bests in an
array of categories, the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team
opened its home schedule by
making short work of UC-Davis
Friday night at packed
Burnham Pavilion, defeating
the Aggies 181.05-170.35.
But Stanford's opening-night
euphoria did not carry over yes
terday, as California edged the
Cardinal 182.6-180.1.
Senior Dina Amoroso was
the outstanding performer of
the Davis meet, sweeping the
individual honors. She won all
four individual events in addi
tion to the all-around title,
scoring personal bests in every
one. Her efforts included a
score of 9.5 for a dazzling floor
exercise, a 9.45 on bars and a
37.55 in the all-around.
"We were all pretty pumped
up because it was our first
home meet and our first meet
in Burnham Pavilion, so I was
excited before the meet even

started," the Cardinal co
captain said.
The emotion, combined with
increased difficulty in several
of the gymnasts' routines,
added up to season bests in
nearly every team category as
well. One of these was a new
high team score of 45.25 for
the floor exercise, sparked by
season-topping performances
by four of the six competitors.
The total score of 181.05 was
also a new plateau.
A mental letdown from the
home opener, combined with a
couple of aching bodies, led to
a somewhat lackluster overall
performance by the squad in
its loss at California yesterday,
although some of the individual
performances were outstand
ing
Amoroso again sparkled in
the all-around competition,
posting a score of 36.85 to take
first place, but perhaps more
impressive was the presence of
a new all-around performer,
senior Marietta Frey.
