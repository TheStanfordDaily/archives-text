# Hirohito's death bad news for recycling center
## 
### David Chang Staff writer 
The Stanford Recycling Center, facing in
creased competition due to an international
glut of recycled paper, is changing its opera
tions to improve efficiency.
The center has reduced the frequency of
pickups at several campus buildings, cutting
back on the number of employees who have
to work overtime. Two extra service runs are
made each week to respond to special service
requests.
The changes come in response to, among
other things, increased domestic paper recy
cling, elections in Mexico, the 1988 Seoul
Olympics and the death of Japan's Emperor
Hirohito.
"As random as that seems, it's actually very
important, because a lot of calendars, memos,
things like that in Japan have the Emperor's
face on them," said Barb Voss, coordinator
of the Stanford Recycling Center. "When the
new Emperor was inaugurated, all the old
[items] had to be discarded and replaced with
new ones."
Japan has an extremely high recycling rate,
and the flood of unwanted paper items from
Japan helped to create a glut in the interna
tional market. The increase in domestic recy
cling and events that use large quantities of

paper — like political elections and the Olym
pics — add more raw paper to the market,
decreasing the price paper manufacturers pay
to recycling organizations.
Also, the federal government inadvertently
makes virgin paper less expensive than
recycled paper by selling land cheaply to lum
ber companies in hopes of keeping unemploy
ment down, especially in the Pacific
Northwest.
Prices for raw glass have also been depressed
in the local area, compounding the problems
for recyclers.
Stanford Recycling, a branch of the Uni
versity's Operations and Maintenance division,
has suffered in the past few years. According
to employee Noel Talbot, the center turned a
profit for the first time last year.
But the financial problems have returned
this year. "Our earnings have been really low,"
Voss said. "The University has had to sub
sidize us more than they ever have in the
past."
Things have been difficult for other
recyclers as well. Debbie Sargent, recycling
manager at the Browning-Ferris Recyclery in
Belmont, said, "I know that a lot of recycling
places (on the East Coast) have closed because
they just can't afford to operate."
However, the picture is not entirely gloomy
because of Stanford's geographical location,

the University's support and a few benevolent
state legislators.
The University is willing to help Stanford
Recycling in times of trouble. Every ton of
material the center recycles is a ton of trash
for which Stanford does not have to pay
landfill fees.
State legislation is making the incentives
for recycling even stronger. By 1995, all
municipalities and counties must achieve a 25
percent recycling and waste reduction rate or
face substantial fines.
These laws help recycling organizations by
creating a demand for recycled products. "A
lot of the problem is that [recycling organi
zations] focus on the collection end," Voss
confessed. "We collect the material, we process
it, we sell it. And we never really focus on
developing a domestic market for the material
we're collecting."
The legal constraints help recyclers on a
large scale. Meanwhile, Stanford Recycling
waits for the laws to take effect and focuses
on getting recycled products into the purchas
ing systems in the University and at the Book
store.
Voss is positive about the future of the
Stanford recycling program and the industry.
"What I've been hearing is that ... we can
expect (paper) prices to increase and stabilize
within the next two to three years."
