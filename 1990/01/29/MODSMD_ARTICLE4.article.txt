# Meyer renovation set back by quake

### Chris Roblyer 
The Oct. 17 earthquake did
more than topple books from the
shelves at Meyer Library â€” it has
forced University officials to cut
funds for a planned renovation of
the library from $19 million to
$2.7 million.
"Everything changed on Oct.
17," said chief Meyer librarian
Susan Perry. "Funds previously
allocated for the renovation of
Meyer had to be redirected to
what were considered more press
ing sources of need."
Before the earthquake, a huge
renovation of Meyer was to take
place in two phases. The plans
called for improved collections,
upgraded exhibits, a more exten
sive audio-visual and computer
system, new furniture and
architectural changes to the build
ing itself.
The first phase of these renova
tions was slated to start by 1992.
However, because earthquake re
pairs in other University build
ings are more pressing, such
sweeping plans have been signif
icantly pushed back.
"I can't see the original scope
of the renovations taking place
for at least eight to 10 years,"
said David Weber, director of Uni
versity Libraries.
Regardless of the redirection of
funds, at least a partial improve
ment of the facilities at Meyer is
"desperately needed," according

to Perry.
Jerry Gillespi, chair of the Ac
ademic Committee on Libraries,
argued that some renovation is
necessary because it is "a question
of public image as well as what's
in the best interests of the stu
dents who use it."
The University has already
given the library system approval
to raise $1.5 million to upgrade
language labs, audio-visual facili
ties, the computer clusters and
viewing rooms. The fund raising
will begin immediately.
Furniture is the second
"desperate need" of Meyer, ac
cording to Perry.
"Although the furniture was ad
equate in 1966," noted Weber,
"today it is shabby and ineffec
tive." A request compiled by Gil
lespi will be presented to Provost
James Rosse today asking for $1.2
million of University funds to be
earmarked for this improvement.
The quake also caused minor
structural damage, especially to
exterior windows, that is yet to
be fixed.
