# Panel says med schools are coming up short
## Doctors learn biology, not compassion

Medical schools are not serving
the best interests of their students
or society, according to medical
education experts at a conference
held at the School of Medicine.
"We're in trouble today in med
ical education," said Kenneth
Ludmerer, associate professor of
medicine and history at Washing
ton University of St. Louis.
The weekend conference was a
three-day event that examined
problems with the current medical
education system and possible so
lutions.
Ludmerer said medical schools
encourage rote memorization in
stead of critical thinking The
schools are "producing too many
encyclopedic physicians and not
enough thinking physicians," he
said.
He said medical schools also fall
short of producing compassionate
doctors. "Medical students learn
too much biology and not enough
about the personality of the pa
tient," he said.
Stanford's own medical pro
gram is focused too heavily on
research and not enough on clini
cal training, several medical ex
perts said.
"Stanford's goal of training re

searchers is not a societal goal,
it's an institutional goal indirectly
subsidized through government
tax exemptions and National In
stitutes of Health grants," said
Dr. Robert Lawrence of Harvard.
Dr. John Steward, associate
dean of student affairs at the Med
ical School, cited reports from su
pervisors of residency programs
who said Stanford medical grad
uates were "as well or better
prepared than their colleagues."
During the panel discussion,
Steward said Stanford's key
strength is its flexibility. The Med
ical School has core requirements,
but the courses can be taken at
any time. In addition, tuition
costs are reduced after the fourth
year, allowing students additional
time to complete their degree.
Steward said such flexibility in
scheduling "provides time for stu
dents to achieve their needs and
interests." He cited the number
of ways students use the addi
tional time, noting that about 70
percent of students take five or
more years to finish school.
According to Steward, about 90
percent of students do research
projects and about 21 percent
complete advanced degrees in
other disciplines. Students who
are single parents or pursue other
careers are able to study medicine
because of the school's flexibility,
he said.
Many medical students do re
search, however, in order to
reduce their medical school debts.
Steward said the mean debt in
curred by medical students
nationwide is $42,374, while
Stanford's average debt is
$33,239. A large part of the debt
is defrayed by stipends received
as research assistants.
The meyor external threat to
medical education, Ludmerer
said, is financial. A new form of
reimbursement introduced by
Medicare and Medicaid in 1984
has forced teaching hospitals to
process as many patients as pos
sible.
Under this plan, hospitals get
a set amount of money for a
diagnosed illness based on a na
tional average. Thus, even if a
patient requires more care than
can be provided by the plan, the
hospital will only get a set amount.
This encourages hospitals to treat
as many patients as they can with
out taking too much time on each
one.
A panel at the conference dis
cussed ways in which medical
schools can improve the training

they provide. Dr. B.W. Shragge of
McMaster Medical School said in
novative programs in his school
have created better clinical doc
tors.
McMaster, founded in 1965,
created small group tutorials of
four to six students. The tutorials
emphasized problem-based learn
ing in clinical situations.
"You don't think about prob
lems in carbohydrate metabolism
in the emergency room," Shragge
said. "You have a screaming child
with two hysterical parents, and
the bottom line may be a problem
with carbohydrate metabolism,
but it's not in the context of a
classroom."
McMaster's example has been
copied by other medical schools
with similar clinical-focused pro
grams. Harvard's new Pathways
program combines classroom lec
tures with small-group tutorials
and clinical experience once a
week.
A particularly innovative pro
gram was introduced at the Uni
versity of New Mexico. Dr. Arthur
Kaufman, a program administra
tor at the university, said there
is a great dearth of primary-care
physicians serving rural areas in
his state.
To solve this problem, the med
ical school began a new program
in which students go out into rural
small towns for four months and
act as community doctors. Kauf

man stressed that the large num
ber of new doctors going into
specialties rather than commu
nity or family medicine is prevent
ing many people from getting
adequate health care.
Lawrence said the dearth of
primary-care clinicians is caused
by medical students attracted to
more lucrative specialties. The
last graduating class from Har
vard, he said, had 19 students en
tering radiology and 10 in general
surgery, but only four going into
family medicine.
