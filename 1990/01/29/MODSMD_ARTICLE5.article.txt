## Doctors learn biology, not compassion

Medical schools are not serving
the best interests of their students
or society, according to medical
education experts at a conference
held at the School of Medicine.
"We're in trouble today in med
ical education," said Kenneth
Ludmerer, associate professor of
medicine and history at Washing
ton University of St. Louis.
The weekend conference was a
three-day event that examined
problems with the current medical
education system and possible so
lutions.
Ludmerer said medical schools
encourage rote memorization in
stead of critical thinking The
schools are "producing too many
encyclopedic physicians and not
enough thinking physicians," he
said.
He said medical schools also fall
short of producing compassionate
doctors. "Medical students learn
too much biology and not enough
about the personality of the pa
tient," he said.
Stanford's own medical pro
gram is focused too heavily on
research and not enough on clini
cal training, several medical ex
perts said.
"Stanford's goal of training re

searchers is not a societal goal,
it's an institutional goal indirectly
subsidized through government
tax exemptions and National In
stitutes of Health grants," said
Dr. Robert Lawrence of Harvard.
Dr. John Steward, associate
dean of student affairs at the Med
ical School, cited reports from su
pervisors of residency programs
who said Stanford medical grad
uates were "as well or better
prepared than their colleagues."
During the panel discussion,
Steward said Stanford's key
strength is its flexibility. The Med
ical School has core requirements,
but the courses can be taken at
any time. In addition, tuition
costs are reduced after the fourth
year, allowing students additional
time to complete their degree.
Steward said such flexibility in
scheduling "provides time for stu
dents to achieve their needs and
interests." He cited the number
of ways students use the addi
tional time, noting that about 70
percent of students take five or
more years to finish school.
According to Steward, about 90
percent of students do research
projects and about 21 percent
complete advanced degrees in
other disciplines. Students who
