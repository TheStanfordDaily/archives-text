It's time to write the Bug.
Send your Bug Me questions to the Stanford
Daily, Storke Publications Bldg., or drop them
off in person.
The Bug does not Bite.
THIS SUMMER, DON'T JUST
TAKE A PLUNGE INTO
CORPORATE AMERICA.
If you arc an undergraduate and no one is willing to give you a job that actu
ally requires you to supervise people and manage money, how are you going to get
business experience?
We at the Stanford Student Directory believe that you don't have to be a
graduate to take on the responsibilities of corporate executives. Every year, we
select responsible and entrepreneurial Stanford undergraduates to be in charge of
the Student Directory. And they are completely responsible for all phases of the
project and make all decisions concerning it.
So if you are a responsible Stanford undergraduate interested in this unique
opportunity, then we want to talk to you. We are currently accepting applications
for the Project Director and the Business Manager positions. Complete applica
tion materials are available in the Student Organization Office (SOS) located on
the 2nd Floor of Tresidder Union. We will also hold an information session on
Monday, February 5, at 7 p.m., in the Firetruck House. Applications are due on
Friday, February 8, at noon.
