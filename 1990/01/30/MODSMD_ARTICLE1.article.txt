# Debaters tackle abortion
## 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Abortion was compared to
slavery, and the beginnings of life
were disputed during a debate
that packed Roble Hall's main
lounge last night.
The debate, sponsored by Stan
ford in Government, featured pro
life advocate Catherine Short and
Count Gibson, a Stanford profes
sor of health research and policy.
Sylvia Cerel Bowen, a student
at the School of Medicine and co
author of the book "Contraceptive
Technology," and Charlotte
Schramm, community educator at
Planned Parenthood in San Jose,
represented the pro-choice side.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg
acted as moderator.
Each speaker was initially given
four minutes in which to present
his or her point of view, followed
by a five-minute rebuttal from
each speaker.
Bowen presented biological
facts, stressing that a fetus cannot
survive on its own until the 24th
week of pregnancy. She told the
audience that the risk of death
from delivering a child is four
times greater than the risk of
death from a first trimester abor
tion.
Gibson also turned to biology
to support the pro-life viewpoint,
saying that the development of
the fetus is "a steady unfolding"
and that the trimesters of preg
nancy are "arbitrary." The heart
of a fetus beats at six weeks, he
said, and a fetus can hear music
at 18 to 20 weeks.
Abortions are permitted up to
the 24th week of pregnancy in
California.
Gibson also argued that tech
nology is allowing more prema
ture babies to survive, possibly
leading to a situation where "at
one end of a hospital we have a
preemie, while at the other end
of the hospital a baby of the same
age is having its life terminated."
He expressed the opinion that
"any good argument for abortion
is a good argument for infan
ticide."
Schramm rejected this view,
saying that "a fetus is not the
same thing as a child." She said
that while people are capable of
having great feeling for a fetus,
the fetus cannot experience these
same feelings.
A 6-year-old child may have the
potential to be a doctor or attor
ney, she said, but the child cannot

command the salary of a doctor
or attorney based on this poten
tial. Similarly, the fact that a fetus
has the potential to be a human
being does not mean that it is a
human being, she concluded.
Schramm also noted that
"women all over the world choose
abortion by the millions."
Short denied that the pro-life
position is sexist, saying that
more men than women favor abor
tion on demand. She compared
the pro-life movement to the civil
rights movement, likening the un
born infant to blacks during
slavery, because in both cases, the
"victim" is not defined as a per
son, she said. The defenders of
both slavery and abortion, she

continued, claim that they are act
ing in the best interests of those
they victimize.
Short went on to compare the
argument that a fetus cannot feel
emotion to the claim that "blacks
are vicious. ... If blacks are freed
they can become civilized, and if
a fetus lives it can attain its full
potential," she said.
Schramm drew laughter from
the crowd when she stated that
"there is a big difference between
a fetus and a black individual"
because a fetus is biologically de
pendent on the mother.
Schramm added that the goal
of pro-lifers is "to prevent women
from having choices," paralleling
the situation of blacks in America.
