Abortion was compared to
slavery, and the beginnings of life
were disputed during a debate
that packed Roble Hall's main
lounge last night.
The debate, sponsored by Stan

Count Gibson, a Stanford profes

Sylvia Cerel Bowen, a student
at the School of Medicine and co
author of the book "Contraceptive

Planned Parenthood in San Jose,
represented the pro-choice side.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg
acted as moderator.
Each speaker was initially given

by a five-minute rebuttal from
each speaker.
Bowen presented biological
facts, stressing that a fetus cannot

audience that the risk of death
from delivering a child is four
times greater than the risk of
death from a first trimester abor

Gibson also turned to biology
to support the pro-life viewpoint,
saying that the development of
the fetus is "a steady unfolding"
and that the trimesters of preg

of a fetus beats at six weeks, he
said, and a fetus can hear music

Abortions are permitted up to
the 24th week of pregnancy in
California.
Gibson also argued that tech
nology is allowing more prema
ture babies to survive, possibly
leading to a situation where "at
one end of a hospital we have a
preemie, while at the other end
