## Romanian unrest mounts

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)
— The government accused oppo
nents yesterday of attempting a
coup, and supporters rallied be
hind it, occupying the offices of
one opposition party and forcing
another's leader to flee in an ar
mored car.
More than 15,000 people rallied
in Bucharest to support the self
appointed government that took
over when Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu was deposed
and executed last month. News
media reported similar demon
strations in several other cities
but gave no details.
On Sunday, about 15,000 people
protested in the capital, demand
ing the resignation of the Council
of the National Salvation Front,
the name adopted by the govern
ment that is running the country
until elections planned for May
20.
After initially declaring its only
purpose was to guide Romania
through the immediate post
revolutionary period, the Front
recently said it would enter can
didates in the elections.
That decision angered the fled
gling opposition, which says the
Front — 150 intellectuals, tech
nocrats and former Communists

— has an unfair advantage.
Many opposition politicians
have pointed to the Communist
pasts of leading Front members
and suggested it really is the Com
munist Party in disguise.
As the thousands of pro
government demonstrators gath
ered yesterday outside Front
headquarters in Victory Square,
three of Ceausescu's henchmen
pleaded guilty in court to com
plicity in genocide.
Former Interior Minister Tudor
Postelnicu, former Central Com
mittee secretary Emil Bobu and
former Politburo member Manea
Manescu, along with lon Dinca,
a former Politburo member who
pleaded guilty Saturday, admitted
supporting Ceausescu's order to
shoot demonstrators at the revo
lution's outset.
About the Sunday protest,
Front member Silviu Brucan said
it was organized by the Peasant's
Party, which was a dominant pres
ence in Parliament before World
War II and is thought to be the
strongest opposition party now.
Brucan, a ranking Communist
who fell out with Ceausescu after
criticizing his dictatorial methods,
told reporters the rally was an
attempt to overthrow the Front.

"Their shock troops came close
to the main entrance of the build
ing," he said. "The whole event
amounted to a putsch, a coup
d'etat."
Peasant's Party spokesman lon
Ratiu said of Brucan's allegations:
"The whole thing was turned
around to justify their actions
today."
Ratiu accused the Front of
staging Monday's demonstrations.
Many protesters arrived at Vic
tory Square in buses and trucks.
"We won't leave until you dis
solve the party!" demonstrators
chanted as they forced their way
into Liberal headquarters.
Peasant's Party leader Corneliu
Coposu was evacuated building by
soldiers in an armored car.
Brucan denied Ratiu's claim
that the Front staged and paid
for the demonstrations yesterday,
but several people outside the
Peasant's Party building in
directly suggested they had been
under pressure to demonstrate.
A woman who would not give
her name claimed the Sunday
demonstration also was less than
spontaneous. "They were given
dollars, cigarettes and lei," she
said, referring to the Romanian
currency.
