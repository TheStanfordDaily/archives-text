# Bush calls his 1991 budget an 'investment in the future'

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush yesterday sent Congress a $1.23
trillion budget for fiscal 1991 that keeps
new spending below inflation and recog
nizes "remarkable changes" in the world
by scaling back defense and rewarding
emerging democracies.
Bush called the spending plan an "in
vestment in the future," but Democrats
in Congress pounced on it as not bold
enough on defense cuts and too harsh
on social programs. They also disputed
the president's contention that his budget
would halve the deficit to $63.1 billion,
saying its economic assumptions were too
optimistic.
"This is a 'take-two-aspirin-and-call
me-in-the-morning budget,' " said Rep.

Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Budget Committee, which opens
hearings on the new budget tomorrow.
Fights loomed with the Democratic
controlled Congress on a range of fronts:
Bush's desire to cut Medicare and capital
gains taxes, to close military bases he
considers outmoded and, on the other
hand, to preserve some expensive weap
ons.
Bush would increase spending on space,
education, the environment and the war
on drugs. Losers this year are Medicare,
college student loans, farm subsidies, en
ergy conservation and mass transit.
The president's budget for the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1 calls for $36.5
billion in spending cuts and other deficit

reduction measures.
It projects a 7 percent increase in rev
enues, to $1.17 trillion, without a general
tax increase and just a 3 percent boost
in overall spending - more than a per
centage point below the current rate of
inflation.
Bush proposed defense spending of
$292.1 billion, a cut of 2 percent mea
sured against inflation, while boosting
foreign aid to Eastern Europe, the Philip
pines and Latin America.
On the domestic front, his budget
would leave in place the Social Security
tax increase that took effect earlier this
month. But it honors Bush's 1988 cam
paign pledge to propose no general tax
increase.

The budget calls for "family savings"
accounts under which families could bank
up to $5,000 a year and pay no tax on
interest on deposits held for seven or
more years.
"With an eye toward future growth
and expansion of the human frontier, the
budget's chief emphasis is on investment
in the future," Bush said in a brief mes
sage to Congress accompanying the
1,569-page document.
Bush's budget director, Richard G. Dar
man, opened the annual budget battle by
proposing a truce. "We fully expect to
negotiate with Congress over priorities,"
he told a briefing.
But Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-Ariz.,
senior Republican on the Senate Budget

Committee, said that getting a budget
agreement this year would be tough. "It's
not child's play," he said.
Bush's budget asserted it was meeting
the $64 billion deficit target for fiscal
1991, under the Gramm-Rudman budget
balancing law, "with specific and defen
sible measures — and without gimmicks."
However, critics claimed the adminis
tration's prescription for getting the
budget deficit down to $63.1 billion —
from a projected $123.8 billion this year
— does rely on accounting gimmicks.
"They continue to jimmy the figures,"
said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C. "It's
another fraud." The most dramatic el
ement of the budget was the scaleback
in defense.
