# Arabs condemn settlement

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) â€” Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein blamed the United States
yesterday for an influx of Soviet Jews to
Israel, an increase that Arab officials fear
will drive Palestinians out of the Israeli
occupied territories.
The Kremlin yesterday blasted the Israeli
government's decision to settle Soviet
emigres in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip and said the move complicates
plans to allow even more Soviet Jews to
emigrate.
"We strongly condemn endangering So
viet emigres by using them to crowd Pal
estinians out of their own land," said the
Soviet statement, which was reported by
the official Tass news agency. "This policy
reveals plans to create a 'Greater Israel'
above all at the expense of the Palestinian
people." Speaking in Cairo, Saddam said
the influx is causing "plain and serious
harm" to the Palestinians.
"We regard the United States as a par
ticipant in this immigration because of its
policies," said Saddam, standing beside
President Hosni Mubarak, whose Egypt is
the only Arab country at peace with Israel

and is among Washington's closest Arab
friends. w ' .
"If the United States was preventing na
tionals of other countries from settling in
it, we would say that this is a general
practice," he said.
"But for the United States to let in all
kinds of immigrants and prevent only
Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union
and East European countries, this can only
mean that it is opening only one door to
them. Namely, Israel's door."
The United States has a country-by
country quota for immigrants, with an an
nual global total of 270,000.
Until the Soviet Union removed many
of the restrictions on potential emigrants,
the U.S. quota never was filled. Its 50,000
quota for the fiscal year ending in June,
much higher than previously, was filled by
a backlog from last year, and as many as
400,000 more are expected to apply for
refugee status in the coming year.
Arafat and other Arab leaders say set
tling Soviet and other immigrants in the
Israeli-occupied lands would make a Middle
East peace settlement more difficult.
