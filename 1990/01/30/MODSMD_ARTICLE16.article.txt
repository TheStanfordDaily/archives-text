# Choice of character

### 
LET'S COMMEND Stanford
on a bold choice.
Marian Wright Edelman
will be a fantastic Commencement
speaker. A courageous, powerful
woman, her speaking ability is sec
ond only to her commitment to
public service.
Her work has been influential in
both the halls of Congress and the
inner cities. She has lobbied for
child care and civil rights in Wash
ington while continuing to keep in
touch with the people to whom she
has dedicated her life.
Yet she should not be looked ait
as a partisan speaker. Without
question, there will be students
who disagree with many of the is
sues and legislation she supports.
Still, in a society dominated by
material goods, monetary incen

tives and other individualistic in
ducements, Edelman's approach to
life will be refreshing.
After four years of conferences,
speeches and rallies, Stanford stu
dents will be sent out into the world
by someone who has truly made a
difference, who has used her edu
cation to help others. Perhaps she
will influence many of those un
employed graduates to do the
same.
She will do so with the dizzying
speaking style that is her hallmark.
Her topic will surely be enhanced
by her potent rhetoric and vivid
images.
Edelman may not be as famous
as some of the past Commencement
speakers, but her message can be
more valuable. For now, let us look
forward to her speech.
