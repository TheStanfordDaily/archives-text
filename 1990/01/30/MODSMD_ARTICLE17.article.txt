Commencement speaker chosen for wrong reasons

HER RANDOMNESS and her
relative anonymity not
withstanding, Marian Edelman
might be an appropriate Commence
ment speaker for a university that for
the last four years had fostered intel
lectual debate and committed itself to
a free academic atmosphere.
But Edelman is coming to Stanford.
Stanford, where, since our freshman
year, a group of fellow students, with
the abundant support of the adminis
tration, has kindly sought to pull us
from our ignorance and to "educate"
us in the proper philosophy, history,
political science and economics.

Stanford, where a set of loud and
baroque organizations have sought to
impose an original and sometimes
rather convoluted notion of life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.
Stanford, finally, where true free
speech has too often been sacrificed
upon the mantle of feel-good, arrogant,
"ofTended" and "outraged" cultural
relativism.
After researching Edelman's
qualifications and reading some of her
literature, we strongly suspect that the
agitated segment of our community
had more than its fair share of influ
ence in the selection of our Commence-

ment speaker — one that had the
proper gender, color and political orien
tation. We believe that the only consid
erations should have been personal
worth and renown.
While the administration may argue
that we had ample opportunity to
make our voices heard in the selection
process, this is not the point of our
complaint. A Commencement speaker
should be someone appropriate for the
entire community. Because of her lack
of fame and the controversial recent
history of Stanford, Edelman, no mat
ter how articulate she might be, cannot
meet this requirement.

We ask the administration to care
for once about a substantial portion of
the graduating class — and their
families — who would enjoy the pres
ence of a famous second speaker at
Commencement.
We are willing ourselves to arrange
for the invitation of such a speaker.
We hope the administration will be fair
enough not to bury our request behind
moanings about technical infeasibilty
or yet another patronizing lecture.
