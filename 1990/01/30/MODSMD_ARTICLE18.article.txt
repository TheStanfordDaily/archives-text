# Inflammatory letter doesn't speak for Jewish community
## 
### 
If each of us were to sit down and
compile a list of people we find inspi
rational, I'm sure we would come up
with a lot of different people. Maybe
we could start a discussion and learn
something about each other.
Instead, Jason Gische chose to be
"insulted" that black Daily columnist
Cheryl Taylor includes Bishop Des
mond Tutu and Jesse Jackson on such
a list. Well, as Gische himself points
out, "each individual is entitled to his
or her own opinion." I just wish
Gische could have given his opinion
without involving the rest of the
Jewish community, which he certainly
does not represent.
To say that Jesse Jackson's "inclu
sion of Jews in the 'Rainbow Coalition'
was nothing more than a patronization
and an insult to our collective intelli
gence" is in itself an insult to those

Jews and non-Jews who believe in the
coalition and are actively working to
strengthen black/Jewish relations. I
don't agree with everything Jackson
has said, but he is clearly an influen
tial leader who has inspired many
people.
In Bishop Tutu's case, I think the
Jewish community was hard hit by his
comments for the very reason that he
is so widely respected and recognized
as an inspirational leader.
Tutu discussed his remarks last
week in an interview on KQED-FM's
"South Africa Now." He expressed the
belief that we should forgive the Nazis,
not forget or condone. I'm not sure I
agree with, or even fully understand
his religious concept of forgiveness, but
I didn't find it at all "comical."
Tutu's criticisms of Israeli policy are
shared by many Jews, both in Israel
and the United States. It is his parallel
between Israel and South Africa that
has drawn almost unilateral criticism
from the Jewish community.
While I am personally bothered by
the comparison, it doesn't mean I can
suddenly write off Tutu as an influen
tial and inspirational leader.

We need more open communication
between our communities, not inflam
matory letters.
