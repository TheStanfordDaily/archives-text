# Food Service rarely offers adequate vegetarian food
## 
### 
1 applaud the Tuesday Jan. 23 arti
cle on fat in the Food Service diet; this
is an issue that has concerned me
since my arrival at Stanford.
I am a vegetarian for many reasons,
health among them. The entrees Food
Service offers vegetarians are appal
lingly high in cheese, oil and egg con
tent, and very low in protein. I do not
consider these ingredients an adequate
or healthy substitute for meat what
soever.
At many meals, vegetarians like
myself who are health or weight
conscious end up eating plain rice and
vegetables â€” although this "entree" is

low in fat, it is sorely lacking in flavor.
I am glad to hear that Food Service
attempts to incorporate at least one
low-fat entree (which should probably
have a maximum of 20 percent fat),
but unfortunately it is rarely the vege
tarian alternative, which leaves the
options I described above or a quantity
of bread, creating an imbalanced diet
as well, with no protein and a great
deal of starch.
It is frustrating, when asking a Food
Service manager if healthy food (such
as bagels) can be provided on a regular
basis, to be told that "it's impossible
because Tuesday and Thursday break
fasts are donut breakfasts." Would it
hurt to try a little harder? Perhaps
the students would eat healthy food if
it were more common and "normal" to
have it served.
