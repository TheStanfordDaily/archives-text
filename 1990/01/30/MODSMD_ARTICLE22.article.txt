STANFORD SUCKS." "The Cardi
nal reigns." "I hate it here." "I like
it here." "Stanford is a haven for
latent bigotry and hypocrisy." "Stanford
creates a multicultural environment
among its students.
It's pretty easy to tell who is happy
and who isn't in the above statements.
But how about the following: "Stanford
supports multiculturalism." "Stanford
tolerates multiculturalism." "Stanford
encourages multiculturalism." "Stanford
applauds multiculturalism."
Yeah, you can tell that there is some
difference between these, but it's not as
easily explained as in the first set of
statements. They're all shades of the
same idea. Yet, each viewpoint is unique.
Realizing the importance of a whole
spectrum of opinions isn't easy. The big
gest complaint I hear about the colum
nists as a group is that we all write about
the same thing: Louis Jackson, racism,
affirmative action, abortion and multi
culturalism.
Maybe they've been the basis of too
many columns. Except for Louis Jackson,
these are all topics that have received
perpetual attention since I came to Stan
ford, yet I hope they continue to be dis
cussed and debated.
But why? Aren't we beating many top
ics into the ground? Haven't we already
decided where we stand? What more is
there to say? A lot, from my perspective.
Except for the Super Bowl, issues
aren't resolved by forcing people to pick
a side and then having them fight it out.
There are no winners and losers in rac
ism. As long as it exists, we're all pun
ished.
Any solution that does arise will have

to be a dialogue between ideas. It's a
process of education, discovery and un
derstanding. Certainly, I have strong
views about abortion, affirmative action
and government spending, but they are
far from resolute convictions.
For now I believe that affirmative ac
tion is a way to bridge an ever-widening
gap between the haves and the have-nots.
For now, I believe a woman deserves
control over her own body, especially con
sidering the fallibility of current methods
of birth control. Yet, I am open to new
opinions. I don't know enough about any
topic to close the books and say, "This
is the right way to think about. .
This same idea applies to minorities
who are trying to find their own identity
in a not-so-multicultural world. Groups
like the Black Student Union, the Asian
American Students Association and
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student organ
ization, provide ways for minorities to
discover themselves without conflicting
opinions of the majority. These organi
zations nurture the personal ideas which
the mainstream attacks.
Of course, there's a subtle difference
between confident and convinced. If
people don't believe strongly about issues,
then they can't change the system. But
when people believe too strongly, they
begin to ignore opposing viewpoints. Even
with the best intentions, it's easy for mi
nority groups to mute the voice of reason.
A steadfast belief is not a petrified
belief. It can be altered. Indeed, the big
gest challenge we face as students is to
keep our minds open long after we leave
the Stanford bubble.
There has been a "closing of the Amer
ican mind," but not in the Allan Bloom

sense. When a person leaves a high school
or a university, it's easy to rejoice: "Thank
God I don't have to study for any more
finals." Education is over.
Nevertheless, the novelist James Mich
ener claims his college degree was "the
beginning of a real education. . . . Noth
ing that I studied in college has been of
use to me in my various jobs. But what
1 did learn was how to learn, how to
organize."
Looking at my room and my notebooks,
I don't think I've learned how to organize
yet. But isn't that a great way to think
of college graduation? A beginning of our
education. Each of us comes from a
unique background, and we all have
lenses through which we view the world.
Hopefully, Stanford can shape and tint
those lenses but not indurate them.
Writing a column has been a great
chance for me to put my views on the
line and get feedback to better under
stand the issues I present. Unfortunately,
we have to search for opportunities to
do this once we leave Stanford. And isn't
learning how to search for challenges and
then facing them the whole focus of a
liberal arts education? Or maybe that's
for you to decide.

STANFORD SUCKS." "The Cardi
nal reigns." "I hate it here." "I like
it here." "Stanford is a haven for
latent bigotry and hypocrisy." "Stanford
creates a multicultural environment
among its students.
It's pretty easy to tell who is happy
and who isn't in the above statements.
But how about the following: "Stanford
supports multiculturalism." "Stanford
tolerates multiculturalism." "Stanford
encourages multiculturalism." "Stanford
applauds multiculturalism."
Yeah, you can tell that there is some
difference between these, but it's not as
easily explained as in the first set of
statements. They're all shades of the
same idea. Yet, each viewpoint is unique.
Realizing the importance of a whole
spectrum of opinions isn't easy. The big
gest complaint I hear about the colum
nists as a group is that we all write about
the same thing: Louis Jackson, racism,
affirmative action, abortion and multi
culturalism.
Maybe they've been the basis of too
many columns. Except for Louis Jackson,
these are all topics that have received
perpetual attention since I came to Stan
ford, yet I hope they continue to be dis
cussed and debated.
But why? Aren't we beating many top
ics into the ground? Haven't we already
decided where we stand? What more is
there to say? A lot, from my perspective.
Except for the Super Bowl, issues
aren't resolved by forcing people to pick
a side and then having them fight it out.
There are no winners and losers in rac
ism. As long as it exists, we're all pun
ished.
Any solution that does arise will have

to be a dialogue between ideas. It's a
process of education, discovery and un
derstanding. Certainly, I have strong
views about abortion, affirmative action
and government spending, but they are
far from resolute convictions.
For now I believe that affirmative ac
tion is a way to bridge an ever-widening
gap between the haves and the have-nots.
For now, I believe a woman deserves
control over her own body, especially con
sidering the fallibility of current methods
of birth control. Yet, I am open to new
opinions. I don't know enough about any
topic to close the books and say, "This
is the right way to think about. .
This same idea applies to minorities
who are trying to find their own identity
in a not-so-multicultural world. Groups
like the Black Student Union, the Asian
American Students Association and
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student organ
ization, provide ways for minorities to
discover themselves without conflicting
opinions of the majority. These organi
zations nurture the personal ideas which
the mainstream attacks.
Of course, there's a subtle difference
between confident and convinced. If
people don't believe strongly about issues,
then they can't change the system. But
when people believe too strongly, they
begin to ignore opposing viewpoints. Even
with the best intentions, it's easy for mi
nority groups to mute the voice of reason.
A steadfast belief is not a petrified
belief. It can be altered. Indeed, the big
gest challenge we face as students is to
keep our minds open long after we leave
the Stanford bubble.
There has been a "closing of the Amer
ican mind," but not in the Allan Bloom

sense. When a person leaves a high school
or a university, it's easy to rejoice: "Thank
God I don't have to study for any more
finals." Education is over.
Nevertheless, the novelist James Mich
ener claims his college degree was "the
beginning of a real education. . . . Noth
ing that I studied in college has been of
use to me in my various jobs. But what
1 did learn was how to learn, how to
organize."
Looking at my room and my notebooks,
I don't think I've learned how to organize
yet. But isn't that a great way to think
of college graduation? A beginning of our
education. Each of us comes from a
unique background, and we all have
lenses through which we view the world.
Hopefully, Stanford can shape and tint
those lenses but not indurate them.
Writing a column has been a great
chance for me to put my views on the
line and get feedback to better under
stand the issues I present. Unfortunately,
we have to search for opportunities to
do this once we leave Stanford. And isn't
learning how to search for challenges and
then facing them the whole focus of a
liberal arts education? Or maybe that's
for you to decide.
