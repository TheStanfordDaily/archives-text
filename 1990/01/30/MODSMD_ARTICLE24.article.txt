## Keeping AIDS a secret only induces pain, fear and loneliness 
### 
GREETINGS! I begin the decade
with an exercise in honesty.
For almost one year and a
half I have been an AIDS patient
(technically with an ARC diagnosis).
After considerable thought, I have
elected to make my medical status
public at this time, not to cause alarm
or elicit sympathy; rather, I do it
because it is clearly evident to me that
although the disease has captured the
imagination of the public and continues
to command the attention of the
media, it persists in remaining a
private affair for those of us who
suffer from it and for our immediate
families.
Notwithstanding the question of the
right to privacy, there are some very
good reasons for maintaining one's
condition private. Although in some
instances it is illegal to discriminate
against us, the reality is that discrimi
nation does occur.
Nevertheless, I now strongly believe
that such discrimination is enhanced
and perpetuated by our own fear of
being honest — truly honest — about
our needs — emotional, physical and
spiritual (not to mention financial) —
and by our greatest fear: banishment

If anything good could be said about AIDS, it is
that it presents the potential of forcing us to
become soberly honest about our sexualities,
and it demands that we test the ethical, moral
and legal fiber of our institutions' commitment to
protect our fellow human beings.

from society. So we confuse "secrecy"
with "privacy" and banish ourselves.
Our fears force us into silence and,
for some, into requiring the secrecy of
those closest to us until, of course, the
patient dies. It is then that everyone
finally gets to know our "secret" (and
even then, denial of AIDS as a cause of
death is becoming increasingly accepta
ble).
Yes, people die all the time, and life
goes on, as it should. But for those of
us who have to stare death in the eye
every minute of every day that we
live, living, working and feeling in
silence becomes a self-imposed exile or,

shall we say, a premature death?
I choose life amongst the living! 1
challenge this regrettable secrecy! I
reject fear!
And I encourage others to do the
same. I break the silence and release
those of you who have shared my
secret and encourage everyone to talk
and react about AIDS openly, aggres
sively and honestly.
If anything good could be said about
AIDS, it is that it presents the poten
tial of forcing us to become soberly
honest about our sexualities, and it
demands that we test the ethical,
moral and legal fiber of our institu-

tions' commitment to protect our
fellow human beings.
I invite everyone who has ever
known me or worked with me to pause
a moment and look about you and ask
yourselves if anyone else in front of
you is carrying the burden of this
unnecessary secret.
Talk about it not as a statistical
probability but as a personal reality
that we all share. AIDS, in the long
run, is proving to be not an individ
ual's disease but a community's dis
ease. In a true community of humans,
where brotherhood and sisterhood
abounds, secrecy, in times of crises,
eventually becomes a counter
productive and unwanted burden. By
making my condition public in this
way, I hope to chip away a little of
this unnecessary and undesirable
hindrance.
At present, my physical energy is
diminished, but my mind remains
sharp and demanding; my spirit is
strong and creative, and my hopes are
high that a cure will be found soon.
Yet, I am a realist and a pragmatist.
I will go on living, working and striv
ing to achieve the goals that I have set

for myself, and I will continue to fight
for what I believe in. I am a fighter —
those of you who have been associated
with me know that.
But if the inevitable should come
before I see or communicate with any
of you again, I take this opportunity to
also thank you for the times we've
shared: the good ones and the bad
ones, for how could one be without the
other?
Finally, I pray that those of you who
are healthy, and whose hearts I have
been able to reach with my plea for
openness, keep your hearts open to
others like me who long to live their
whole lives through but who might still
have some trouble being true to them
selves.
For you HIV-positive people living in
secrecy, I ask you to join me in
publicly eschewing this unwarranted,
secret side of AIDS in the '90s. I, for
one, already feel lighter and truer to
myself.
I wish everyone a most happy and
honest final decade of this century!

shared: the good ones and the bad
ones, for how could one be without the
other?
Finally, I pray that those of you who
are healthy, and whose hearts I have
been able to reach with my plea for
openness, keep your hearts open to
others like me who long to live their
whole lives through but who might still
have some trouble being true to them
selves.
For you HIV-positive people living in
secrecy, I ask you to join me in
publicly eschewing this unwarranted,
secret side of AIDS in the '90s. I, for
one, already feel lighter and truer to
myself.
I wish everyone a most happy and
honest final decade of this century!

GREETINGS! I begin the decade
with an exercise in honesty.
For almost one year and a
half I have been an AIDS patient
(technically with an ARC diagnosis).
After considerable thought, I have
elected to make my medical status
public at this time, not to cause alarm
or elicit sympathy; rather, I do it
because it is clearly evident to me that
although the disease has captured the
imagination of the public and continues
to command the attention of the
media, it persists in remaining a
private affair for those of us who
suffer from it and for our immediate
families.
Notwithstanding the question of the
right to privacy, there are some very
good reasons for maintaining one's
condition private. Although in some
instances it is illegal to discriminate
against us, the reality is that discrimi
nation does occur.
Nevertheless, I now strongly believe
that such discrimination is enhanced
and perpetuated by our own fear of
being honest — truly honest — about
our needs — emotional, physical and
spiritual (not to mention financial) —
and by our greatest fear: banishment

If anything good could be said about AIDS, it is
that it presents the potential of forcing us to
become soberly honest about our sexualities,
and it demands that we test the ethical, moral
and legal fiber of our institutions' commitment to
protect our fellow human beings.

from society. So we confuse "secrecy"
with "privacy" and banish ourselves.
Our fears force us into silence and,
for some, into requiring the secrecy of
those closest to us until, of course, the
patient dies. It is then that everyone
finally gets to know our "secret" (and
even then, denial of AIDS as a cause of
death is becoming increasingly accepta
ble).
Yes, people die all the time, and life
goes on, as it should. But for those of
us who have to stare death in the eye
every minute of every day that we
live, living, working and feeling in
silence becomes a self-imposed exile or,

shall we say, a premature death?
I choose life amongst the living! 1
challenge this regrettable secrecy! I
reject fear!
And I encourage others to do the
same. I break the silence and release
those of you who have shared my
secret and encourage everyone to talk
and react about AIDS openly, aggres
sively and honestly.
If anything good could be said about
AIDS, it is that it presents the poten
tial of forcing us to become soberly
honest about our sexualities, and it
demands that we test the ethical,
moral and legal fiber of our institu-

tions' commitment to protect our
fellow human beings.
I invite everyone who has ever
known me or worked with me to pause
a moment and look about you and ask
yourselves if anyone else in front of
you is carrying the burden of this
unnecessary secret.
Talk about it not as a statistical
probability but as a personal reality
that we all share. AIDS, in the long
run, is proving to be not an individ
ual's disease but a community's dis
ease. In a true community of humans,
where brotherhood and sisterhood
abounds, secrecy, in times of crises,
eventually becomes a counter
productive and unwanted burden. By
making my condition public in this
way, I hope to chip away a little of
this unnecessary and undesirable
hindrance.
At present, my physical energy is
diminished, but my mind remains
sharp and demanding; my spirit is
strong and creative, and my hopes are
high that a cure will be found soon.
Yet, I am a realist and a pragmatist.
I will go on living, working and striv
ing to achieve the goals that I have set

for myself, and I will continue to fight
for what I believe in. I am a fighter —
those of you who have been associated
with me know that.
But if the inevitable should come
before I see or communicate with any
of you again, I take this opportunity to
also thank you for the times we've
shared: the good ones and the bad
ones, for how could one be without the
other?
Finally, I pray that those of you who
are healthy, and whose hearts I have
been able to reach with my plea for
openness, keep your hearts open to
others like me who long to live their
whole lives through but who might still
have some trouble being true to them
selves.
For you HIV-positive people living in
secrecy, I ask you to join me in
publicly eschewing this unwarranted,
secret side of AIDS in the '90s. I, for
one, already feel lighter and truer to
myself.
