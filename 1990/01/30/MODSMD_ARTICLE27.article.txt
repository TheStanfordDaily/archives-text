# Coeds critical of chastity door
## Grove architecture causes conflict 
### The Daily Palo Alto January 28, 1913 
The Board of Trustees des
ignated a site near the Stanford
post office for the construction
of the Stanford Union building.
Plans for the Union, prepared
in part by a graduate student
in Stanford's Civil Engineering
Department, took the form of
a quadrangle housing a large
clubhouse.
Stanford Union? It just
doesn't have the same ring to
it. I always thought they called
it "New Union" until 1956,
when a first-year law student
won his case in Federal Ap
peals Court to have the name
changed to "Old Union" on the
grounds of truth in advertising
laws. Guess I was wrong. Just
don't destroy my dream that
Meyer library is named after
the famed hot dog manufac
turer Oscar in honor of his
many contributions to under
graduate education.

One month after the opening
of the Grove Project, Stanford's
first experiment in coeduca
tional living, residents of the
house offered mixed reviews of
the new arrangement.
Most residents agreed that
coed living in Grove House al
lowed "more meaningful rela
tionships between the sexes,"
but criticized the Project for
not going far enough. Both men
and women criticized the in
stallation of a special swinging
door separating the women's
living areas from the men's.
After 11 p.m. the door would
only swing in only one direc
tion, allowing women to enter
the men's areas but keeping
men out of the women's area.
I've heard of chastity belts,
but a chastity door?

The Senior Class Presidents
extended an official invitation
to participate in Commence
ment to Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev. The idea for the
invitation began in the fall
when four Roble resident assis
tants circulated a petition sup
porting the idea, which 500
students signed.
In closing the letter, the four
Senior Class Presidents wrote,
"We believe an opportunity to
hear your hopes and dreams
for our future leaders can only
encourage and endorse the
peaceful coexistence of the USA
and USSR on all frontiers."
Not everyone agreed. David
Gress, a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution crit
icized the invitation, saying
that Gorbachev should not be
allowed a public forum to speak
without opposing speakers.
"It's like giving free
propaganda," he said.
Good point, Dave. "Endors
ing the peaceful coexistence of
the USA and USSR on all fron
tiers" sounds like propaganda
to me. Of course, that was
before you guys at Hoover
realized that Gorby was our
man in Moscow. Maybe we
should invite Mr. Gorbachev
back to this year's Commence
ment. He said "nyet" in 1986,
but it sounds like he could use
a sun-filled June vacation right
about now.
