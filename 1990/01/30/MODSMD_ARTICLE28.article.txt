## Rape Education Project stresses awareness Students work to foster better gender relations on campus 
### Paula Gani Staff writer 
"Rape" is an ugly word. It
brings to mind dark images of
violence and powerlessness.
As a large-scale societal prob
lem, sexual assault may seem too
overwhelming for a small group
of students to combat. Even so,
the 10 or so members of Rape
Education Project feel that
making students on campus take
notice of their relations with
members of the opposite sex is
one place to start.
Rape Education Project is a
coeducational student group that
was founded in 1978 following a
series of campus rapes. At the
time, there was no forum in which
students could address the prob
lem of sexual assault or personal
safety.
Twelve years later, the focus of
Rape Education Project has
shifted to the problem of acquaint
ance rape. Its membership con
sists of dedicated students
working toward educating the
campus on gender relations and
sexual assault.

"Our main function is to make
the campus aware (of the issue
of rape)," according to junior Mi
chelle Finkel.
A resident assistant or any other
student may request a "facilita
tion" by Rape Education Project
for their dormitory or group at
any time. During the facilitation,
a movie such as "Still Killing Us
Softly" or "Rethinking Rape" may
be shown, and one or two mem
bers will initiate a discussion.
"We try to facilitate discussions
instead of telling students what's
right or wrong," said Finkel.
Thus, facilitators leading dor
mitory, fraternity or sorority out
reaches don't have a specific
agenda. Instead, a group of stu
dents may discuss sexism, pornog
raphy or media images "as part
of a continuum that may result
in rape," said Finkel.
According to junior Vivian Vice,
Rape Education Project has re
cently turned its emphasis to
"gender alliances" to show the im
portance of open communication
between the sexes in combating
rape.
In a gender alliance workshop.

students are segregated by sex,
with a Rape Education Project
member of the respective sex
leading each group's discussion.
Questions such as "What do you
least like to hear about your
gender?" are addressed and then
discussed again when both groups
convene.
"It brings up what the other
gender wouldn't think to be hurt
ful or offensive," said Finkel.
This year, two of the group's
members, junior Suzanne O'Brien
and sophomore David Frazee,
wrote "Reforging Relationships,"
a booklet about gender relations
and sexual assault. It was distrib
uted during Freshmen Orienta
tion Week and is available from
Residential Education.
In addition, the group sponsors
Rape Education Week, held in the
spring. Last year, the activities
included the film "The Accused"
and speakers Catharine Mac-
Kinnon and Linda Marciano, as
well as various workshops.
"Rape Education week brought
(rape) to the forefront of students'
minds," said Finkel.

Finkel feels that the success of
Rape Education Week and the
sexual assault survey taken last
spring helped bring about the
Sexual Assault Task Force cur
rently in session.
This year, Rape Education
Week will emphasize not only the
causes leading to sexual coercion,
but also mechanisms to alleviate
the problem in society. "It will be
more positive, more empowering,"
said Finkel.
Finkel emphasized rape as a
societal concern, not just a men's
or a women's problem. For that
reason, the group is coed, and
strongly encourages members of
both sexes to attend facilitations.
A student interested in sexual
assault can take advantage of
Rape Education Project "to learn
something about yourself, and
learn how this problem affects
you," according to O'Brien. "If
you have some initiative and want
to start something, there's plenty
of room to run with it and plenty
of people willing to work with
vou."
