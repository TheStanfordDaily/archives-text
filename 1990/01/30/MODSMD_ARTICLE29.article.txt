# Half-Asian students come together, share common experiences
## 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
Seven women sit in a circle,
eating brownies and talking.
Some look distinctly Asian, others
distinctly Caucasian. And some
look like they fit into neither cat
egory.
The desire of these diverse
looking women to share their com
mon experiences as half-Asian
women led to the formation of
Stanford's only bi-racial discus
sion group — a group for half-
Asian students — that held its
first meeting Jan. 11.
The group originally started as
a group just for half-Asian women
but recently opened up to half-
Asian men also.
"Being half-Asian is a big part
of our lives, even before we knew
about it," said sophomore Sonya
Johnson, who is half-Japanese.
"The group was the first time I
had a chance to talk to half-Asian
women about being half-Asian. I
didn't know I had those things in
common with anybody."
Children of interracial relation
ships form a growing minority in
the United States. "We are part
of a growing population of people
who are mixed, and as we get rid
of prejudice, there will be more
and more mixed-race people," said
Shari Epstein, who is half-
Chinese.
Despite their increasing num
bers, however, group members say
they often feel invisible as half-
Asians.

group — the 'other'
on all the application
forms.'

"I felt this kind of emptiness,
that I didn't fit into some group
— the 'other' on all the applica
tion forms," said Naomi Williams,
whose mother is Japanese and
father is Caucasian.
Such ambivalence is com
pounded by a unique family en
vironment. "Most people are at
least in the same ethnic group as
their parents, but we're in this
strange group where we're not,"
noted Williams.
"Except for our siblings, we all
have had to deal with it alone. I
don't have a sister, so as a woman,
I really have been alone," said
Johnson.
In addition, half-Asians often
feel isolated from both the white
majority and the Asian minority.
"Each culture doesn't think we
belong to it," said Johnson.
Being part of two cultures has
unique pressures and advantages,
according to group members. "For
me it was liberating to realize that

I was not bicultural," sophomore
Lisa Mar said. "I used to feel in
adequate for not speaking Chi
nese, not looking Chinese, not
acting Chinese enough."
Half-Asians learn to balance
two identities. "I tried to run away
from the Asian part of me while
I was growing up. It was like, to
protect myself, I'm going to be
really American," said Johnson .
Being half-Asian has been a pos
itive influence for many group
members, serving as a bridge
across cultures. Johnson devel
oped an interest in Japanese cul
ture after her parents moved to
Japan and is now a graduate stu
dent in Asian languages.
Like Johnson, some half-Asians
feel they have "the freedom to
operate in both cultures." Four
of the seven group members are
pursuing some form of Asian
studies at Stanford.
"Being half-Asian also crosses
the Asian cultural barriers," said
Epstein.
"If you got a pure Chinese and
a pure Japanese person together,
they probably could not talk to
each other," said Johnson. "We
can, partly because we are all part
American. But I also think there
is something more fundamental
in Asia than most Asians know.
They (different Asian cultures)
are more fractured than they
should be."
The group opened their discus
sions to half-Asian men at their
last meeting, which was held last
Wednesday.

The half-Asian women's group expanded to admit men at their meeting last Wednesday. The group
formed two weeks ago as a forum for discussion and support.
