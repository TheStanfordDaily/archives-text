# ASSU decision may make or break lake
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Tonight's ASSU meeting may
prove prophetic for the state of
Lake Lagunita as well as the state
of the ASSU.
The senate is scheduled to con
sider a bill that may determine
whether the lake will be filled this
spring. It will also hear the annual
State of the Association address
in which the ASSU reviews its
accomplishments and its goals.
The speech will be given by mem
bers of the Council of Presidents.
The Budget and Finance com
mittee will present a bill calling
for the senate to allocate $9,000
to help defray costs of the lake.
Final allocation of the money will
be contingent on the results of a
student body survey to be taken
in house meetings during the next
two weeks, Senate Chair Ed
Sasaki said.
The bill, written by senator
Sheila Hayre, asks that the money
come out of the ASSU reserves,
an account normally used to pay
for incidental expenses and proj

ects. Last quarter the senate ap
proved a donation of $3,000 from
the reserves to assist the city of
Watsonville in earthquake relief.
The Stanford University Lake
Commission projects the operat
ing budget of the lake to be
$20,675, of which $11,000 is al
located for lifeguard salaries. The
remainder of the cost is for tele
phone installation, beach security,
storage sheds and other equip
ment.
Senator Stacey Leyton said she
expects approval of the bill to
prove students' commitment to
the lake. Michael Jackson, asso
ciate dean of Student Affairs, in
dicated last week that funds from
the ASSU would show him that
students support filling the lake.
Leyton stressed that the grant
will be a "one-time thing." She
said future funds might be raised
through special fees.
Senate Chair Ed Sasaki said last
night that he expects the bill to
pass.
The COP address will give a
historical persptective on the
ASSU, describing how the once
ill-regarded ASSU has changed its
focus to concentrate more on stu
dents and their needs, according
to COP members. The authors
also aim to show how the student
government's changes have bet
tered the ASSU's status in the
student community, according to
a draft of the speech.
The address will present the
ASSU's current progress toward
multiculturalism and community
spirit.
The meeting is open to all stu
dents and will be held at 7 p.m.
in room 180 of the Law School.
University President Donald Ken
nedy will be on hand to address
the ASSU and will take questions
from the audience.
The presentation will conclude
with a list of the future goals of
the ASSU, including more student
involvement in the association and
a stronger commitment to multi
cultural issues.
