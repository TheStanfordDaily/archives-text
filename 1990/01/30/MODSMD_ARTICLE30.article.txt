## Cardinal looks to extend win streak, avenge loss to Dons USF coach will rely on experience today 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Welcome to the Collegiate Baseball Quiz!
Today's question has to do with two Bay
Area teams and their 1989 performances.
At the foggy end of the peninsula, we
have a team that won 14 games, lost 30,
finished fourth in its conference and placed
exactly zero players on the all-league team
last season.
At the sunny end, we have a 30-28 team,
which also finished fourth in its league,
but this squad placed two players on the
all-conference team and had six players
taken in the amateur draft.
Now, which team had the better season?
Wrong.
As it turns out, success is a very relative
term. For the University of San Francisco
Dons, last year's fourth-place finish in the
West Coast Conference was the team's best

showing since — ouch — 1976. As for the
other team, Stanford's fourth-place Six-Pac
finish was the first time the team had
finished worst than second since 1979.
To top it all off, on April 11 of last year,
the Dons beat Stanford 6-4 in a game that
was probably the low point of the Cardinal's
season. The loss, which came right after
Arizona State had swept the Cardinal in
Tempe, gave Stanford its longest losing
streak of the season (four games) and
dropped the team to 17-22.
What goes around comes around, for
Stanford had been whomping USF for
years. In the last 12 seasons, while the
Cardinal has been tearing up the college
baseball world, the Dons have finished last
in their league nine times and were next
to last the other three.
And that's why 1989, far from being a

disaster, was actually a little more
enjoyable than usual for Coach
Ken Bowman, who has been at
the USF helm for the past 10
seasons. This season may be even
more fun as 16 lettermen return
for the Dons. Only 8-14 in league
play last year, the Dons may ac
tually reach .500 in 1990.
If they don't, though, Bowman
probably won't lie awake at night
worrying about it. Bowman won
the Humble Pie award at a Bay
Area baseball press conference
two weeks ago, saying, "I don't
think we match up with most
teams in this league. . . . We have
very limited resources. . . . We've
got six senior starters, but after
that, we don't have much depth.
"We won seven games last year
against these guys [other Bay
Area teamsl, but we only won
seven other games the whole year.
That should tell you something
about the coaching," Bowman
quipped.
However, Bowman was singing

a different tune in a recent USF
press release. "Our main strength
is going to be our experience,"
Bowman said. "We have some
good new talent to complement
our experience. On paper this
could be potentially the best team
I've ever coached."
Of course, Bowman realizes
that even the best possible USF
team is still going to have to
scrape out most of its wins. In
today's game with Stanford, which
is USF's season opener, the Dons
must start their most optimistic
season in years against a team
that's off to its best start in
several seasons — and remembers
what happened last April.
Card notes
Between the wins over Santa Clara
this weekend, the Cardinal defeated
an alumni team on Saturday, 9-7.
Former Stanford stars Frank Carey,
lion Witmeyer, Doug Kobbins, Mike
Aldrete, Brian Johnson and Jeff Hal
lard, among others, were on hand.
Despite constant heckling from the
cheap seats, freshman John Lynch
played three solid innings at third
and tossed a 1-2-3 ninth from the hill
to pick up his first career save.

dropped the team to 17-22.
What goes around comes around, for
Stanford had been whomping USF for
years. In the last 12 seasons, while the
Cardinal has been tearing up the college
baseball world, the Dons have finished last
in their league nine times and were next
to last the other three.
And that's why 1989, far from being a

disaster, was actually a little more
enjoyable than usual for Coach
Ken Bowman, who has been at
the USF helm for the past 10
seasons. This season may be even
more fun as 16 lettermen return
for the Dons. Only 8-14 in league
play last year, the Dons may ac
tually reach .500 in 1990.
If they don't, though, Bowman
probably won't lie awake at night
worrying about it. Bowman won
the Humble Pie award at a Bay
Area baseball press conference
two weeks ago, saying, "I don't
think we match up with most
teams in this league. . . . We have
very limited resources. . . . We've
got six senior starters, but after
that, we don't have much depth.
"We won seven games last year
against these guys [other Bay
Area teamsl, but we only won
seven other games the whole year.
That should tell you something
about the coaching," Bowman
quipped.
However, Bowman was singing

a different tune in a recent USF
press release. "Our main strength
is going to be our experience,"
Bowman said. "We have some
good new talent to complement
our experience. On paper this
could be potentially the best team
I've ever coached."
Of course, Bowman realizes
that even the best possible USF
team is still going to have to
scrape out most of its wins. In
today's game with Stanford, which
is USF's season opener, the Dons
must start their most optimistic
season in years against a team
that's off to its best start in
several seasons — and remembers
what happened last April.
Card notes
Between the wins over Santa Clara
this weekend, the Cardinal defeated
an alumni team on Saturday, 9-7.
Former Stanford stars Frank Carey,
lion Witmeyer, Doug Kobbins, Mike
Aldrete, Brian Johnson and Jeff Hal
lard, among others, were on hand.
Despite constant heckling from the
cheap seats, freshman John Lynch
played three solid innings at third
and tossed a 1-2-3 ninth from the hill
to pick up his first career save.

The Dons will have to reckon with the newest Cardinal superstar
today, freshman Jeff Hammonds. Hammonds went 4-for-10 last
week with a double, triple, three runs, two RBI and a stolen base.
