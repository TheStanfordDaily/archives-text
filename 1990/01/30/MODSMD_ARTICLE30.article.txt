Welcome to the Collegiate Baseball Quiz!
Today's question has to do with two Bay
Area teams and their 1989 performances.
At the foggy end of the peninsula, we
have a team that won 14 games, lost 30,
finished fourth in its conference and placed
exactly zero players on the all-league team
last season.
At the sunny end, we have a 30-28 team,
which also finished fourth in its league,
but this squad placed two players on the
all-conference team and had six players
taken in the amateur draft.
Now, which team had the better season?

Dons, last year's fourth-place finish in the
West Coast Conference was the team's best

showing since — ouch — 1976. As for the
other team, Stanford's fourth-place Six-Pac
finish was the first time the team had
finished worst than second since 1979.
To top it all off, on April 11 of last year,
the Dons beat Stanford 6-4 in a game that
was probably the low point of the Cardinal's
season. The loss, which came right after
Arizona State had swept the Cardinal in
Tempe, gave Stanford its longest losing
streak of the season (four games) and
dropped the team to 17-22.
What goes around comes around, for
Stanford had been whomping USF for
years. In the last 12 seasons, while the
Cardinal has been tearing up the college
baseball world, the Dons have finished last
in their league nine times and were next
to last the other three.
And that's why 1989, far from being a
