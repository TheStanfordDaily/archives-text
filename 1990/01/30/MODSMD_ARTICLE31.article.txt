# USF at Stanford
## 
### 
TODAY — 2:00 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
RECORDS — Stanford (2-0, ranked fourth nationally), USF (0-0).
SERIES — The teams split their two games last year, with the Cardinal trouncing the Dons
12-4 at Sunken Diamond Feb. 28. The Dons avenged the loss with a 6-4 win at home April
11.
DON UPDATE — USF has six starters back from last year's 14-30 squad, but only one, outfielder
Arnie Sambel, hit over .300 in 1989. Sambel also had the most RBIs among the returnees
27. Junior college transfer Jon French, who hit .370 at Modesto JC last season, is
expected to make an impact as well.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Freshman Jeff Hammonds debuted in style this weekend, going 4-for-10
with a double, triple, three runs, two RBI and a stolen base. ~ Sophomore shortstop Roger
Burnett was 3-for-9 with 3 RBI and had the team's first home run of the year Sunday in the
first inning... Until Santa Clara's Rick Bianchina homered in the sixth on Sunday, Stanford's
pitchers had tossed 14.2 innings of shutout ball to open the season ... The Cardinal defense
has yet to commit an error.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Although USF has perhaps its best team in years, it probably will still
have to struggle to reach .500 in the West Coast Conference If the Cardinal gets a solid
effort from its pitchers (several will probably see action) and continues its offensive ways
(everyone in the lineup had at least one run or RBI over the weekend), Stanford should cruise.
