# Drug testing at high school draws support
## School board rejects plan to test all students but will test all athletes 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — The drug
testing of athletes at suburban
Homewood-Flossmoor High
School drew much support and no
complaints in its first week and
will go on as planned, Athletic
Director Ken Schultz said yester
day.
"We've received a lot of positive
comments from people in the com
munity," Schultz said. "We've had
hundreds of phone calls from
schools all over the country inter
ested in our policy and proce
dures."
Fourteen students underwent
urine tests on the first day of the
program last week.
The school board approved the
testing last fall. Each week, on a

'I haven't received one negative call. I
figured there would be some, but there
haven't been/

randomly chosen day, a certain
number of the school's 305 student
athletes in winter sports are
randomly-selected to be tested for
drugs.
An informal poll of the student
body has indicated that 70 percent
approve of the tests, though 48
percent believe them to be a viola
tion of rights.
"I haven't received one negative
call," Schultz said Monday. "I

figured there would be some, but
there haven't been."
He declined to say whether any
of the students had tested positive
for drugs so far.
"We're not giving out any in
formation week by week," he said.
"Our policy protects the confiden
tiality of students. At the end of
the school year, we'll put out data
on the number of kids tested and
the number of positives."

The program calls for testing
15 student athletes per week —
one of those chosen last week was
absent from school — until March
1, when the number tested will
rise with the growing ranks of
student athletes going out for
warm-weather sports.
Under the test procedure, each
student is asked to disrobe in the
presence of a staff member from
the local hospital that is adminis
tering the tests. Subjects are then
handed hospital gowns and give
the urine samples in a stall
separated from the staffer by a
partition.
The samples are tested to en
sure they are fresh.
Some legal experts say drug
testing of student athletes may
erode society's expectations of
privacy for students. But such
testing survived a legal challenge
in December 1988, when the 7th

Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in
Chicago ruled unanimously that
John T. McCutcheon High School,
near Lafayette, Ind., could use
random drug tests for athletes.
The Homewood-Flossmoor
school board rejected a proposal
to have testing apply to all 2,000
students but plans eventually to
test all 1,200 sports participants
at the high school.
