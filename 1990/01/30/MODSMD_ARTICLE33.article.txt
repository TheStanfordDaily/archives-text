LONDON (AP) — British soccer
clubs are being told to bring their
dilapidated stadiums up to 20th
century standards by 1999.
A report on the deaths of 95
fans last April at Hillsborough
Stadium warned that such a
tragedy could occur again unless
drastic changes, such as doing
away with standing areas, are
made at British stadiums, many
of which were built in the late
1800s.
"The picture revealed is of a

general malaise or blight over the
game due to a number of factors,"
the report, released Monday, said.
"Principally these are old
grounds, poor facilities,
hooliganism, excessive drinking
and poor leadership.
"Inside the grounds, decay and
dilapidation are often extensive
. . . and little has been done to
improve the layout in accordance
with modern expectations. This is
chiefly because the safety and
comfort of those on the terraces

has not been regarded as a prior
ity."
The 109-page report is the cul
mination of a nine-month inves
tigation into the mishap at Shef
field, England, where a rush of
late-arriving fans led to a deadly
crush in the terraces, or standing
areas.
It was the highest death toll
ever documented at a European
sporting event.
The report said the biggest

clubs in England and Scotland
should replace standing areas
with seats by August 1994 and
that other professional soccer
teams in Britain should have all
seat stadiums by August 1999.
In Parliament, Home Secretary
David Waddington said the gov
ernment would push to implement
the recommendations even though
soccer officials have estimated it
could cost nearly a quarter of a
billion dollars.
