# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Sorry, Joe.
Trisha Stevens and Dan Hanan were
pretty super this past week as well, earning
each of them a spot in the Daily's Athletes
of the Week.
In fact, Stevens, a 6-foot-3 native of
Philomath, Ore., has been dominating Car
dinal opponents so thoroughly recently that
she was named Pacific 10 Conference Player
of the Week.
Stevens scored a career-high 35 points to
lead the No. 2 Cardinal past sixth-ranked

Long Beach State in a game televised na
tionally on ESPN. Stevens hit on 14 of 21
shots from the field and 7 of 9 from the
free throw line as Stanford captured the
105-91 victory.
In the game, she also recorded a double
double in points are, rebounds by grabbing
12 boards.
Thursday against Arizona, Stevens
scorched the nets for 20 points on 10-of-13
shooting. Stanford won that game 92-69 de
spite playing without Jennifer Azzi. When
Stevens exited the game with eight minutes
left, no one on the Cardinal bench realized
she had 999 points for her career.
Saturday, she went over the 1,000 mark
on a free throw with two minutes left in
the first half. Stevens had 13 points and
five rebounds in just 16 minutes as the
Cardinal's 90-63 victory over Arizona State
made the team 18-0.

Hanan, a senior middle blocker, spear
headed the Cardinal assault in seven con
secutive straight-game victories this past
week at the UCSB-Michelob Light Collegiate
Invitational.
Hanan, who resides in Huntington Beach,
Calif., contributed in a number of ways,
according to Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves.
"Dan has always been as one of the best
net players in the country in terms of his
blocking and hitting, but what impressed
us most was his back row play this week
end," Nieves said.
According to Nieves, Hanan made several
key digs and passes that were instrumental
in the Cardinal triumph against Pepperdine.
A 6-foot-5 All-American, Hannan led the

Cardinal in hitting percentage, digs, solo
blocks and block assists last year and racked
up similar numbers in the final against
UCLA.
In a losing effort to in the finals,
Hanan shined. "Dan played extremely well
and had a really good hitting match," Nieves
said. "We were not able to get the ball to
him as much as we would have liked."
