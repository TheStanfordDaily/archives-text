# Super Sunday ads too much for fan
## 
### 
Avery serious bit of news
came out of St. Louis last
night. A story, as re
ported by a radio station there,
claims that Bud Light was
guilty of throwing Bud Bowl 11.
It seems that Budway Joe,
Bud Light's star quarterback,
had been bragging a lot about
his team's chances in the week
leading up to the game. Most
people figured he was just a
cocky sort of guy, but it now
comes out his talk was done
only in an effort to drive up
the amount of money bet on
his team.

Budway Joe, the report in
dicates, was deeply in debt to
the Becks brothers, a loan
sharking consortium in Ger
many. He bet heavily against
his team and threw a key in
terception to set up Bud's
game-winning touchdown as
time expired.
After the game Joe did his
best to seem disappointed and
felt the whole team was to
blame. "We just came out flat,"
he said. "No bubbles or any
thing. I don't know why."
The radio station has yet to
indentify its sources or provide
any proof of a fix, but their
report implied that additional
information would be forth
coming shortly.
Speaking of Bud Bowl 11,
there has been a lot of confu
sion over the last-second,
game-winning touchdown.
While NFL rules prohibit
gaining yardage for recovering
a ball fumbled forward, BFL
regulations contain no such re
strictions. In a release by
league commisioner Paul
Tagliabrew, the rule was
clarified, and the touchdown
was upheld.
Speaking of the events of
Super Bowl Sunday,
wasn't that a great game
between the Broncos and the
49ers? I mean, even with the
new-found parity Pete Rozelle
used to talk about, a nailbiter
like this is one in a million.
Thus, it was good to see that
this event got the media cov
erage it so richly deserved. And
then some. And then some
more. And some more after
that.
The paper I get every morn
ing ran a special 20-page Super
Bowl section as the front sec
tion of the paper and had 27
stories on the game and various
aspects thereof.

Now that is a lot of stories.
In fact, it had three stories for
each touchdown. For a normal
Super Bowl, that could be al
most within reason. But with
the 49ers scoring every 45
seconds or so, there were a lot
of touchdowns and thus a lot
of stories.
Now if my favorite team, the
Raiders, was in the Super
Bowl, I wouldn't want 27
stories in the sports page the
next morning. I seriously
wouldn't want that much. I'd
like maybe a story or two on
the game, a couple of stories
on the key play and the turning
point and maybe something
about some player on one of
the teams.
And if it's the Raiders, I
could see maybe another story
on Bo Jackson's new decision
to pursue an NHL career. And
perhaps even an article on how
Marcus Allen is going to try to
upstage Bo by training to win
the decathalon in the 1992
Olympics.
And one on how after the
game, a cameraman came on
to the field and asked, "A 1
Davis, your team just won the
Super Bowl. What are you
going to do now?"
"I'm going to Disneyland,"
Davis said. "In fact, let's take
the whole team to Disneyland.
Heck, while we're at it let's
build a stadium. In Fan
tasyland. And we can play
there. Yeah, that's the ticket.
Now if we can get them to give
us an $80-million dollar fran
chise fee and build luxury
boxes for us to sell to Goofy
and his friends ..."
But even with all those
stories, there would only be
about a dozen or so. How these
writers came up with 27, I'll
never know. But 1 guess that's
why they're professionals,
while I just work for a college
paper.
The only thing I liked
about the Super Bowl
coverage, aside from the
"The Big Easy" headline,
which I thought was the best
around, was that they did have
a separate section. I thoroughly
er\joyed reaching for the sports
section and reading it in peace,
without anything on the 49ers,
the team I most love to hate.
Instead of having sports
stories on how Steve Young
prepared himself to spend three
hours standing on the bench
before coming in during gar
bage time, or how the Niners
were torn between dousing
Coach George Siefert with
cherry- or lemon-flavored
Gatorade, I was able to read
about actual sporting events.
You know, stufT like the PGA
Seniors Skins Game.

The only reason I watched the
game, aside from just a morbid
curiousity as to how bad it was
going to get, was for the commer
cials. In addition to the aforemen
tioned Bud Bowl II (which, as the
preveiw ads stated, is truly out
of control), there was a selection
of new ads making their debuts.
Considering how expensive ad
vertising during the Super Bowl
is, companies wanted to make
sure the ads they sent out were
winners. A few of them made
costly mistakes, but Nike did a
good job. Their "80, you do know
Diddley" ad was shown for the

last time during the pregame
show, to be replaced by a new ad.
This ad, called "The Announ
cers" was hyped as a better ad
than the one it replaced. Well, it's
pretty good, but I don't think it's
better. And it cannot hope to com
pare to the best sports-related ad
ever: the one with Mean Joe
Green and the little kid from
about 10 years ago.
Nike has also been rebroadcast
ing another of my favorites of late,
the one with Spike Lee telling you
what you can buy and what you
cannot. It's good stuff, pun in
tended.
But the best advertising cam
paign I've seen lately is put
on by Bud Light. It has a
group of four guys called the Bud

Light Daredevils who do halftime
shows at basketball games across
the nation. One of their stops was
in Tempe, Ariz., for halftime of
the Stanford-Arizona State game
last Saturday.
The guys look like former gym
nasts â€” you know, kind of short
with tremendous upper bodies.
They set up a couple mini
trampolines and some mats and
dunked some basketballs.
Not conventional dunking, how
ever, but vicious, high-flying, 360-
degree slamming. As an example
of the type of stuff they do, one
routine sent a guy flying towards
a trampoline near one basket.
He'd jump up, do half a flip, and
with his feet straight up in the
air and a basketball held below
head, he flipped the the ball into

the air.
Another guy followed, did a flip,
caught the ball and tossed it back
up again, all in mid-air. The third
guy did a flip, caught the ball and
bounced it off the backboard.
Then the last guy did a flip,
caught the ball in mid-air, kept
going up until he was about three
feet above the rim, then dunked
it with a vengeance on the way
down.
If Michael Jordan gets 10s for
his dunks, these guys deserve 16s
or so. And they put all other forms
of advertising to shame.

basketball writer. He couldn't
dunk a ball even with a tram
poline.
