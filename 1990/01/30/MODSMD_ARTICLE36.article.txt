# Fencers foiled at Invite
## Captain admits team could have done better 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer 
Stanford fencers faced fierce competition
in a multi-school tournament held last Sat
urday at Penn State.
While the women's team scrapped its
way to a 4-3 record against the seven East
ern schools it faced, the men fell 2-5 under
the superior steel of the Eastern teams.
Although the women posted decisive wins
(11-5 and 10-6) over North Carolina State
and Northwestern University, with a closer
call (9-7) against North Carolina, one of
their victories came down to a tally of
touches. Tied at 8-8 at the end of their
match against Cornell, Stanford's women
were awarded the victory with 61 touches
to Cornell's 59.
But Wisconsin handed Stanford defeat
by a similar narrow margin. After drawing
an 8-8 tie, Wisconsin gained the match
with 59 touches to Stanford's 55. "We could
have fenced better," said Grace Chang, the
women's team captain.
According to Chang, last week's compe
tition was the toughest Stanford has faced
this year.
"The fencing programs are a lot stronger
on the East Coast," Chang said. "Penn
State (who defeated Stanford 12-4) has one
of the top teams in the country."
Stanford had to travel all the way to
State College, Pa. to find a challenging
opponent, according to Chang. "There's not
much competition out here [in the West],"
Chang said. "Santa Cruz is fairly good, but
they haven't beat us this year."

The men's fencing team hasn't been so
lucky. Two weeks ago, the Stanford men
lost to UC-Santa Cruz in a close match
(13-14). Close calls added to the bitterness
of last Saturday's losses at Penn State as
well.
"We lost two matches 13-14," junior Stan
Brobston said. While those losses to Duke
University and North Carolina were close,
the Stanford men suffered a trouncing (5-
22) at the hands of No. 2-ranked Penn
State. The team also fell decisively to Cor
nell, 17-10. The Cardinal did fence past
North Carolina State (18-9) and North
western (21-6). "Despite the losses, we
showed the East Coast teams that we can
do more than play baseball and frisbee,"
men's team captain Jim Farrell said.
A member of the men's foil team,
Brobston was both pleased and perplexed
by Stanford's performance with that
weapon. The foil team played a key role
in Stanford's 18-9 victory over North
Carolina State, losing only one bout out
of nine.
But the foil team's narrower victories
over Duke and North Carolina contributed
to Stanford's narrow match losses to those
schools.
"Against Duke, I lost by one touch,"
Brobston said. "Three or four guys lost by
just a touch. A lot of times a victory is
just getting that extra edge, that extra
point."
Stanford's fencers are hoping wield that
edge at UC-Santa Cruz next Saturday. "I
think we'll beat them this time," Brobston
said.
