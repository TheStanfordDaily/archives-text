tions in The Associated Press

seventh straight week.
The Techsters received 52 first
place votes and 1,612 points from
a nationwide panel of 65 women's

13 first-place votes and 1,582

rivals.

spot to return to its all-time high
ranking at seventh, achieved ear

dropped two spots to eighth with
1,182 points after the loss at Stan
ford. The 49ers defeated Big West
rivals Fresno State and San Jose
State to stay a game behind
Nevada-Las Vegas in the league
standings.
Stephen F. Austin (15-2) and
Purdue (14-3) held the ninth and
10th spots, but voting was ex
