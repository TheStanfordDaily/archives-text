# El Centro director quietly overcame racial barriers

On the outside, she exudes a
petite, shy, unassuming aura.
On the inside, she possesses the
personal strength that is crucial
for her job as new director of El
Centro Chicano.
Stanford alumna Frances
Morales officially became the Uni
versity's first full-time director of
El Centro Dec. 20. "In the time
I've been here, I've been really
impressed with the high energy
of the students," she said.
Morales is making plans that
will shape El Centro's immediate
future. "We're working on an in
terim governing body while we
set up a more permanent advisory
or policy board," she said.
She said 9he will try to coor
dinate El Centro's activities with

other student groups. "Our basic
philosophy is to coordinate with
other organizations so we can
have as much community partic
ipation as possible," Morales said.
Morales hails from Weslaco,
Texas, a small, predominantly
Chicano town near the southern
most tip of the state. Raised in
what she called "a very lower
class" economic situation, she and
her family did agricultural work.
"I picked cotton when I was
growing up," she said. "That was
something I looked forward to
doing in the summer — helping
out my parents."
Even when she described un
pleasant experiences, her face still
carried a bright optimistic glow
The youngest of five children,
she recalled looking forward to
going to the Catholic school like
her siblings. But Spanish was her

first language, and she did not
learn English until the third
grade.
"When I started (in kindergar
ten) and found out there was
nothing but English, it was a big
disappointment. All I remember
was getting red marks on my
papers," she said.
She even considered dropping
out during the third grade but
credited one adult's positive rein
forcement as an incentive to stay.
"Looking back, it was amazing
because from early on — even
though I went to a Catholic school,
which was basically all Mexican
— even then I could tell the class
differences. The parents who had
more professional careers vs. the
ones from the rural areas , . . the
treatment was definitely differ
ent."
At 13 she and her family moved

to Fresno, Calif, and switched
from cotton-picking to grape
picking. Her tone became more
somber as she described the rac
ism she encountered in the Fresno
public schools.
"I wanted to take biology in the
ninth grade, and the counselor
told me that I couldn't take it
because I wasn't going to college."
Instead, she took typing.
The one Chicana teacher in the
school supported Morales. The
teacher told her, "Here's what
they're saying about you (in the
teacher lounge): They expect you
to be the next generation of maids.
You can do better."
At first glance, Morales' gentle
character and tiny frame suggest
a childhood of shyness, but it isn't
shyness, she asserted. "It's just


Frances Morales
that we grew up with a lot of
fears, the fears of something like
the border patrol or the fear of
not knowing English," she said.
"That put us into a situation
where we couldn't really partici
pate in the school system. It took
us a lot to get going."
Morales was the first in her
family to attend a four-year col
lege. She received a bachelor's in
Spanish and a teaching credential
from California State University
at Fresno in 1972. Morales also
received a master's degree in guid
ance and counseling from the Uni
versity of New Mexico in 1974.
She first came to Stanford in
1975. Here she received a master's
degree and doctorate in education

and a master's in anthropology.
After graduating from Stanford
in 1982, she gained valuable ex
perience in a Variety of jobs. She
taught in the Chicano Studies
Program at UC-Berkeley and then
worked with SRA Technology con
ducting national educational
studies.
Morales then took the reins as
director of a preschool community
education center in Redwood City.
Before coming back to Stanford,
she provided teacher training in
the Multifunctional Resource
Center in Oakland. Morales, who
is single, now lives in Oakland
and commutes every day.
She wistfully recalled her expe
rience as a student at Stanford.
"My first day here, when I was
applying to Stanford, the very
first place I came to was El
Centro." The integral role of El

Centro in the lives of Chicanos at
Stanford "is a role that is still
being played," she said.
She pursed her lips as she men
tioned statistics in the University
Committee on Minority Issues
report, which showed the number
of Chicano graduate students
decreasing. "There are so few of
us going to college. It's a loss for
the entire Chicano/Latino commu
nity and for the country as a
whole."
Speaking from experience, she
said, "As a student, sometimes
you're too busy with your
schedule to really take a look at
the different resources that are
available here." As a resource her
self, Morales said she enjoys meet
ing new people and working with
other programs to find more
avenues for collaboration.
