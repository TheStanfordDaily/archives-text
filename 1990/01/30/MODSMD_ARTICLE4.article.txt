On the outside, she exudes a
petite, shy, unassuming aura.
On the inside, she possesses the
personal strength that is crucial
for her job as new director of El
Centro Chicano.
Stanford alumna Frances
Morales officially became the Uni
versity's first full-time director of
El Centro Dec. 20. "In the time
I've been here, I've been really
impressed with the high energy
of the students," she said.
Morales is making plans that
will shape El Centro's immediate
future. "We're working on an in
terim governing body while we
set up a more permanent advisory
or policy board," she said.
She said 9he will try to coor
dinate El Centro's activities with

other student groups. "Our basic
philosophy is to coordinate with
other organizations so we can
have as much community partic
ipation as possible," Morales said.
Morales hails from Weslaco,
Texas, a small, predominantly
Chicano town near the southern
most tip of the state. Raised in
what she called "a very lower
class" economic situation, she and
her family did agricultural work.
"I picked cotton when I was
growing up," she said. "That was
something I looked forward to
doing in the summer — helping
out my parents."
Even when she described un
pleasant experiences, her face still
carried a bright optimistic glow
The youngest of five children,
she recalled looking forward to
going to the Catholic school like
her siblings. But Spanish was her

first language, and she did not
learn English until the third
grade.
"When I started (in kindergar
ten) and found out there was
nothing but English, it was a big
disappointment. All I remember
was getting red marks on my
papers," she said.
She even considered dropping
out during the third grade but
credited one adult's positive rein
forcement as an incentive to stay.
"Looking back, it was amazing
because from early on — even
though I went to a Catholic school,
which was basically all Mexican
— even then I could tell the class
differences. The parents who had
more professional careers vs. the
ones from the rural areas , . . the
treatment was definitely differ
ent."
At 13 she and her family moved

to Fresno, Calif, and switched
from cotton-picking to grape
picking. Her tone became more
somber as she described the rac
ism she encountered in the Fresno
public schools.
"I wanted to take biology in the
ninth grade, and the counselor
told me that I couldn't take it
because I wasn't going to college."
Instead, she took typing.
The one Chicana teacher in the
school supported Morales. The
teacher told her, "Here's what
they're saying about you (in the
teacher lounge): They expect you
to be the next generation of maids.
You can do better."
At first glance, Morales' gentle
character and tiny frame suggest
a childhood of shyness, but it isn't
shyness, she asserted. "It's just
