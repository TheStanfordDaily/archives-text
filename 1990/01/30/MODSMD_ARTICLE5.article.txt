Count 'em on your hand.
How many ex-techies do you
know here at Stanford — stu
dents who have traded in their
calculus and physics books and
opted for the humanities or
liberal arts route? Do you need
two .. . seven ... 21 hands?
Here's a twist: How many
music
do you know?
Ellen Ochoa, the first female
Hispanic selected to be an
astronaut and a former graduate
student at Stanford, is exactly
that. As one of 23 astronaut can
didates chosen from a field of
2,000 applicants, the former
aspiring musician was "ecstatic"
when she learned of her selection
two weeks ago.
Currently chief of the Intelli
gent Systems Technology Branch
at NASA/Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, Ochoa will
leave her post July 15 for
astronaut training at Johnson
Air Station in Houston.
Ochoa, 31, who is originally
from La Mesa, a suburb of San
Diego, attended San Diego State
University, where sha received
a bachelor's degree in physics.
But physics wasn't quite her
original plan, she says. When she
began college, she wanted to
study music.
"I played the flute in high
school, and I thought about
doing that as a career. In fact,
two of my brothers and sisters
were music majors at San Diego
State," she explains. "So I

thought about doing that." But
then she decided "it would be
better as a hobby."
Ochoa began to explore other
interests. For a while she was a
business and then she
briefly considered mtyoring in
English. "I couldn't make up my
mind," she recalls.
While she experimented with
the different majors, however,
Ochoa continued taking math, a
subject she always liked. Even
tually she settled on physics,
which she laughingly refers to
as the "sixth she declared
at San Diego State.
"It certainly wasn't something
I intended to do," she says."I
really didn't have a plan there.
It just kind of worked out."
After graduating with a bach
elor's degree in physics, she came
to Stanford to study electrical
engineering. Although she was
one of very few women in a male
dominated major, she says,
"Other than feeling a little self
conscious at times, I never really
felt that I was treated different
in any way. I had two really good
advisers and felt that I got good
advice and good support."
Her advisers were Prof.
Joseph Goodman, who now
chairs the Electrical Engineering
Department, and Assoc. Prof.
Bert Hesselink of the Aeronau
tics and Astronautics Depart
ment.
While Ochoa was in graduate
school, she began thinking about
her career plans and the possi
bility of being an astronaut.

Ellen Ochoa, a former Stanford graduate student, has been selected by NASA
as one of 23 astronaut candidates.
After she completed her doctorate
in electrical engineering in 1985,
Ochoa spent three years as a re
search engineer in Livermore
before she began working for
NASA/Ames, where she is cur
rently the manager of 30 scientists
and engineers.
In a few months, however, she
will be moving to Houston, where
she will complete a year of formal
astronaut training. From there,
she estimates she will undergo at
least another two years of general
training before blastoff.
The astronaut's education is
lengthy, Ochoa says. She first
spent five years getting her bach
elor's degree and then another five
completing her doctorate. Besides
all the technical know-how, the
most important thing that grad
uate school taught her was per
severance, she says.
The actual astronaut applica
tion process is lengthy, too. From
the 2,000 applications, "they win
nowed it down to about 100 people
based on your educational expe
rience and work experience," Oc
hoa recalls. "Then they invite
those 100 people down to
Johnson's for a week, and you
have an interview with the selec
tion board."
For most of the week, however,
all she did was "talk to the doctors
and the nurses" as they evaluated
her physical condition.
Then, on the day before the
news was broken to the media,
the selection committee informed
her that she was chosen as one
of the astronaut candidates. The

first thing she thought was, "I
have to call some people ... I
have to call my mom!"
Since then, her life has become
even busier with media interviews
and invitations to speak at schools
in addition to her job responsibil
ities. For now, she doesn't mind
the attention, she says, because
she is very happy about attaining
her goal of being an astronaut.
But she hopes things will calm
down soon because she has a lot
of work to do.
In order to become an
astronaut, grades are important,
Ochoa says. "When people say, 'It
doesn't matter what grade you
get in grad school,' that's wrong.
They do look at it." During the
selection process, she says, the
committee actually called her
graduate school professors ' to
inquire about her.
Also, there should be "some way
of being able to demonstrate your
accomplish ments."
She says she thinks the selec
tion committee especially looked
for candidates who were well
rounded individuals. Besides play
ing her music, Ochoa also plays
volleyball and enjoys flying
airplanes.
As for the Challenger tragedy,
Ochoa says it is something she
has thought about, but she feels
the risks are part of the job.
"There's no way for there not
to be risks. There's always going
to be risks. The most that you
can ask is that there's a good pro
gram that tries to minimize . . .
unsafe conditions.
"I think it's a lot safer now
than it used to be, but something
can always go wrong, and you just
have to ask, 'Is it worth it to me?"'

thought about doing that." But
then she decided "it would be
better as a hobby."
Ochoa began to explore other
interests. For a while she was a
business and then she
briefly considered mtyoring in
English. "I couldn't make up my
mind," she recalls.
While she experimented with
the different majors, however,
Ochoa continued taking math, a
subject she always liked. Even
tually she settled on physics,
which she laughingly refers to
as the "sixth she declared
at San Diego State.
"It certainly wasn't something
I intended to do," she says."I
really didn't have a plan there.
It just kind of worked out."
After graduating with a bach
elor's degree in physics, she came
to Stanford to study electrical
engineering. Although she was
one of very few women in a male
dominated major, she says,
"Other than feeling a little self
conscious at times, I never really
felt that I was treated different
in any way. I had two really good
advisers and felt that I got good
advice and good support."
Her advisers were Prof.
Joseph Goodman, who now
chairs the Electrical Engineering
Department, and Assoc. Prof.
Bert Hesselink of the Aeronau
tics and Astronautics Depart
ment.
While Ochoa was in graduate
school, she began thinking about
her career plans and the possi
bility of being an astronaut.

Ellen Ochoa, a former Stanford graduate student, has been selected by NASA
as one of 23 astronaut candidates.
After she completed her doctorate
in electrical engineering in 1985,
Ochoa spent three years as a re
search engineer in Livermore
before she began working for
NASA/Ames, where she is cur
rently the manager of 30 scientists
and engineers.
In a few months, however, she
will be moving to Houston, where
she will complete a year of formal
astronaut training. From there,
she estimates she will undergo at
least another two years of general
training before blastoff.
The astronaut's education is
lengthy, Ochoa says. She first
spent five years getting her bach
elor's degree and then another five
completing her doctorate. Besides
all the technical know-how, the
most important thing that grad
uate school taught her was per
severance, she says.
The actual astronaut applica
tion process is lengthy, too. From
the 2,000 applications, "they win
nowed it down to about 100 people
based on your educational expe
rience and work experience," Oc
hoa recalls. "Then they invite
those 100 people down to
Johnson's for a week, and you
have an interview with the selec
tion board."
For most of the week, however,
all she did was "talk to the doctors
and the nurses" as they evaluated
her physical condition.
Then, on the day before the
news was broken to the media,
the selection committee informed
her that she was chosen as one
of the astronaut candidates. The

first thing she thought was, "I
have to call some people ... I
have to call my mom!"
Since then, her life has become
even busier with media interviews
and invitations to speak at schools
in addition to her job responsibil
ities. For now, she doesn't mind
the attention, she says, because
she is very happy about attaining
her goal of being an astronaut.
But she hopes things will calm
down soon because she has a lot
of work to do.
In order to become an
astronaut, grades are important,
Ochoa says. "When people say, 'It
doesn't matter what grade you
get in grad school,' that's wrong.
They do look at it." During the
selection process, she says, the
committee actually called her
graduate school professors ' to
inquire about her.
Also, there should be "some way
of being able to demonstrate your
accomplish ments."
She says she thinks the selec
tion committee especially looked
for candidates who were well
rounded individuals. Besides play
ing her music, Ochoa also plays
volleyball and enjoys flying
airplanes.
As for the Challenger tragedy,
Ochoa says it is something she
has thought about, but she feels
the risks are part of the job.
"There's no way for there not
to be risks. There's always going
to be risks. The most that you
can ask is that there's a good pro
gram that tries to minimize . . .
unsafe conditions.
"I think it's a lot safer now
than it used to be, but something
can always go wrong, and you just
have to ask, 'Is it worth it to me?"'
Count 'em on your hand.
How many ex-techies do you
know here at Stanford — stu
dents who have traded in their
calculus and physics books and
opted for the humanities or
liberal arts route? Do you need
two .. . seven ... 21 hands?
Here's a twist: How many
music
do you know?
Ellen Ochoa, the first female
Hispanic selected to be an
astronaut and a former graduate
student at Stanford, is exactly
that. As one of 23 astronaut can
didates chosen from a field of
2,000 applicants, the former
aspiring musician was "ecstatic"
when she learned of her selection
two weeks ago.
Currently chief of the Intelli
gent Systems Technology Branch
at NASA/Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, Ochoa will
leave her post July 15 for
astronaut training at Johnson
Air Station in Houston.
Ochoa, 31, who is originally
from La Mesa, a suburb of San
Diego, attended San Diego State
University, where sha received
a bachelor's degree in physics.
But physics wasn't quite her
original plan, she says. When she
began college, she wanted to
study music.
"I played the flute in high
school, and I thought about
doing that as a career. In fact,
two of my brothers and sisters
were music majors at San Diego
State," she explains. "So I

thought about doing that." But
then she decided "it would be
better as a hobby."
