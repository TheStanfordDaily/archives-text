# Alum makes switch from tunes to moons

Count 'em on your hand.
How many ex-techies do you
know here at Stanford — stu
dents who have traded in their
calculus and physics books and
opted for the humanities or
liberal arts route? Do you need
two .. . seven ... 21 hands?
Here's a twist: How many
music
do you know?
Ellen Ochoa, the first female
Hispanic selected to be an
astronaut and a former graduate
student at Stanford, is exactly
that. As one of 23 astronaut can
didates chosen from a field of
2,000 applicants, the former
aspiring musician was "ecstatic"
when she learned of her selection
two weeks ago.
Currently chief of the Intelli
gent Systems Technology Branch
at NASA/Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, Ochoa will
leave her post July 15 for
astronaut training at Johnson
Air Station in Houston.
Ochoa, 31, who is originally
from La Mesa, a suburb of San
Diego, attended San Diego State
University, where sha received
a bachelor's degree in physics.
But physics wasn't quite her
original plan, she says. When she
began college, she wanted to
study music.
"I played the flute in high
school, and I thought about
doing that as a career. In fact,
two of my brothers and sisters
were music majors at San Diego
State," she explains. "So I

thought about doing that." But
then she decided "it would be
better as a hobby."
Ochoa began to explore other
interests. For a while she was a
business and then she
briefly considered mtyoring in
English. "I couldn't make up my
mind," she recalls.
While she experimented with
the different majors, however,
Ochoa continued taking math, a
subject she always liked. Even
tually she settled on physics,
which she laughingly refers to
as the "sixth she declared
at San Diego State.
"It certainly wasn't something
I intended to do," she says."I
really didn't have a plan there.
It just kind of worked out."
After graduating with a bach
elor's degree in physics, she came
to Stanford to study electrical
engineering. Although she was
one of very few women in a male
dominated major, she says,
"Other than feeling a little self
conscious at times, I never really
felt that I was treated different
in any way. I had two really good
advisers and felt that I got good
advice and good support."
Her advisers were Prof.
Joseph Goodman, who now
chairs the Electrical Engineering
Department, and Assoc. Prof.
Bert Hesselink of the Aeronau
tics and Astronautics Depart
ment.
While Ochoa was in graduate
school, she began thinking about
her career plans and the possi
bility of being an astronaut.
