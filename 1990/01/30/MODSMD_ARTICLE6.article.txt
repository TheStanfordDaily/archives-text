# Journal staff sees Soviet colleagues' democracy, chaos
## 
### Janine De Fao Senior staff writer 
Recent changes in the Soviet Union have led to
a "keen sense about anything undemocratic," ac
cording to Susan McKean, publisher of the first
Soviet-American student journal, to be published at
Stanford.
This realization came to McKean during winter
break when eight members of the American staff
of the journal, Montage, met for the first time with
their Soviet counterparts in Moscow.
The journal will be a forum for Soviet and Amer
ican student writing and artwork. The staff plans
to have all copy complete and sent to the Soviet
Union for translation in mid-February. They plan
to distribute the first issue, a full-color, approxi
mately 90-page magazine, in early May
"Everything had to be arranged democratically,"
McKean said of last month's meeting in Moscow,
adding that there is often "confusion between de
mocracy and chaos."
She described trying to select a Soviet photo editor
with 36 people present, a group in which a third
of the Soviets spoke English and only one American
spoke Russian.
"That's just not the typical way to conduct a job
interview," said Eric Jones, American managing
editor.
"It was difficult to arrange things in an efficient
and creative productive manner," McKean said,
eliciting laughter from Jones and Mark Weiner, the
American editor.
And as is common in cross-cultural discussions,
misunderstandings often occurred.
"We would think we had all agreed, and then one
of the Soviet editors would say something, and we'd
realize their concept of what they agreed to was
totally different," McKean said.
According to Weiner, the meetings were "produc
tive, but the smaller the better." He added that
Soviet and American editors are "thinking along
the same lines in terms of philosophy."
"It was exciting to hear them discussing, with
their Moscow dialect, things we
had been talking about for five
months without counterparts,"
Jones said of the Soviet staff.
The Soviet editor, managing
editor and business manager are
students or recent graduates of
Moscow State University and the
Moscow State University Insti
tute for Journalism.
Montage staff, on both sides of
the globe, hope the journal will
educate Soviet and American stu
dents about each other and them
selves. It aims to create an
understanding between Soviet
and American students, "the fu
ture intellectual and political
leaders of two of the most pow
erful nations," according to
McKean.
The journal will focus on writ
ing, photography and artwork of
American and Soviet students.
"We'd like it to be Rolling Stone
meets The New Yorker — in two
languages," said Doug Davis,
American art editor.
The theme of the first issue is
the origins of identity, including
national, religious and sexual
identity.
Currently, the project is garner

ing support in the United States
and the Soviet Union.
The Foundation for Social In
novations, the first independent
non-profit charitable organization
in the USSR, is providing office
space and technical support. A
branch in San Francisco is helping
with fundraising.
Office space in Moscow is an
important matter because the
"security and safety of computers
is a serious issue. It may be a
hazard to own one," McKean said,
noting that murders have been
committed during computer
thefts. Computers are worth 25
years of the average worker's
salary, Jones said.
The Novosti Press Agency in
Moscow has given permission for
the journal to publish under its
name, giving Montage freedom
from government and state
review.
In addition, a joint Soviet-
Swedish construction firm will
pay for the shipping of the journal
and distribution in the Soviet
Union.
San Francisco-Moscow
Teleport, an electronic mail serv
ice, has contributed all electronic
mail services, through which the
Soviet and American editors will
communicate.
The first electronic mail mes
sage was received at the American

editorial office, located in the
Knoll Annex, last week.
"Now the pace seems to quad
ruple every day," Jones said.
He said the American staff feels
confident with their Soviet coun
terparts.
"It was great that we could find
people we could really trust in
just a week. It just clicked," Jones
said.
"All of us were highly sensitive
to any kind of cultural im
perialism," McKean said.
At the meeting, however, the
Soviet editors presented story
ideas that were "incisive and titne
ly r " McKean said.
"The trip indicated the need for
the project even more," she added.
"We spent time working with So
viet students on a project we all
feel strongly about. There is really
a need for effective, humane com
munication" between the Soviet
Union and the United States, she
added.
McKean said the journal has
gotten "an interested, enthusiastic
reception from very diverse
sources" in the Soviet Union.
"We've established a very pow
erful link with students in that
country who have a future just
ready to be written. They desper
ately need education in how to
organize and govern themselves,"
she said.

According to Weiner, the meetings were "produc
tive, but the smaller the better." He added that
Soviet and American editors are "thinking along
the same lines in terms of philosophy."
"It was exciting to hear them discussing, with
their Moscow dialect, things we
had been talking about for five
months without counterparts,"
Jones said of the Soviet staff.
The Soviet editor, managing
editor and business manager are
students or recent graduates of
Moscow State University and the
Moscow State University Insti
tute for Journalism.
Montage staff, on both sides of
the globe, hope the journal will
educate Soviet and American stu
dents about each other and them
selves. It aims to create an
understanding between Soviet
and American students, "the fu
ture intellectual and political
leaders of two of the most pow
erful nations," according to
McKean.
The journal will focus on writ
ing, photography and artwork of
American and Soviet students.
"We'd like it to be Rolling Stone
meets The New Yorker — in two
languages," said Doug Davis,
American art editor.
The theme of the first issue is
the origins of identity, including
national, religious and sexual
identity.
Currently, the project is garner

ing support in the United States
and the Soviet Union.
The Foundation for Social In
novations, the first independent
non-profit charitable organization
in the USSR, is providing office
space and technical support. A
branch in San Francisco is helping
with fundraising.
Office space in Moscow is an
important matter because the
"security and safety of computers
is a serious issue. It may be a
hazard to own one," McKean said,
noting that murders have been
committed during computer
thefts. Computers are worth 25
years of the average worker's
salary, Jones said.
The Novosti Press Agency in
Moscow has given permission for
the journal to publish under its
name, giving Montage freedom
from government and state
review.
In addition, a joint Soviet-
Swedish construction firm will
pay for the shipping of the journal
and distribution in the Soviet
Union.
San Francisco-Moscow
Teleport, an electronic mail serv
ice, has contributed all electronic
mail services, through which the
Soviet and American editors will
communicate.
The first electronic mail mes
sage was received at the American

editorial office, located in the
Knoll Annex, last week.
"Now the pace seems to quad
ruple every day," Jones said.
He said the American staff feels
confident with their Soviet coun
terparts.
"It was great that we could find
people we could really trust in
just a week. It just clicked," Jones
said.
"All of us were highly sensitive
to any kind of cultural im
perialism," McKean said.
At the meeting, however, the
Soviet editors presented story
ideas that were "incisive and titne
ly r " McKean said.
"The trip indicated the need for
the project even more," she added.
"We spent time working with So
viet students on a project we all
feel strongly about. There is really
a need for effective, humane com
munication" between the Soviet
Union and the United States, she
added.
McKean said the journal has
gotten "an interested, enthusiastic
reception from very diverse
sources" in the Soviet Union.
"We've established a very pow
erful link with students in that
country who have a future just
ready to be written. They desper
ately need education in how to
organize and govern themselves,"
she said.
Recent changes in the Soviet Union have led to
a "keen sense about anything undemocratic," ac
cording to Susan McKean, publisher of the first
Soviet-American student journal, to be published at
Stanford.
This realization came to McKean during winter
break when eight members of the American staff
of the journal, Montage, met for the first time with
their Soviet counterparts in Moscow.
The journal will be a forum for Soviet and Amer
ican student writing and artwork. The staff plans
to have all copy complete and sent to the Soviet
Union for translation in mid-February. They plan
to distribute the first issue, a full-color, approxi
mately 90-page magazine, in early May
"Everything had to be arranged democratically,"
McKean said of last month's meeting in Moscow,
adding that there is often "confusion between de
mocracy and chaos."
She described trying to select a Soviet photo editor
with 36 people present, a group in which a third
of the Soviets spoke English and only one American
spoke Russian.
"That's just not the typical way to conduct a job
interview," said Eric Jones, American managing
editor.
"It was difficult to arrange things in an efficient
and creative productive manner," McKean said,
eliciting laughter from Jones and Mark Weiner, the
American editor.
And as is common in cross-cultural discussions,
misunderstandings often occurred.
"We would think we had all agreed, and then one
of the Soviet editors would say something, and we'd
realize their concept of what they agreed to was
totally different," McKean said.
According to Weiner, the meetings were "produc
tive, but the smaller the better." He added that
Soviet and American editors are "thinking along
the same lines in terms of philosophy."
