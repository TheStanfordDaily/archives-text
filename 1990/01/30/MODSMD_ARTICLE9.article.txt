# Wirth urges conservation activism
## Colorado senator lauds environmental responsibility 
### Steve Heifetz 
Sen. Timothy Wirth of Colorado
declared last night that environ
mental problems "have us on a
collision course with the world."
Wirth, a Democrat elected to
the U.S. Senate in 1986, stated
that Americans should take sat
isfaction in past accomplishments
in protecting the global environ
ment, but in order to prevent a
further deterioration, "we need to
clearly define our goals for the
last decade of this century," he
said.
Speaking in Bishop Auditorium,
the senator said the world is in
a state of enormous change and
its people must respond by shift
ing responsibilities to more global
issues, namely, the preservation

of natural resources.
"We have developed the ability
to fundamentally change our en
vironment" and have had to en
dure the loss of billions of tons
of topsoil, devastating effects of
acid rain, the destruction of the
rain forests "at one football-field
per-second" and the near-collapse
of water tables, he said.
A Stanford doctoral graduate in
education, Wirth outlined a pro
gram which he believes should be
undertaken to meet the "new con
ditions of global life."
First, he said, "we must be con
servative in the truest sense of
the word" by conserving water,
trees and energy resources, for
example.
Second, market forces should be
harnessed for the good of the en

vironment. Wirth explained that
about a year ago, he co-sponsored
a program titled Project '88, de
signed "to put a green thumb on
Adam Smith's invisible hand."
In addition, the private and
public sectors must cooperate on
a major research and development
program, he said. Alternatives to
fossil fuels should be investigated,
a rethinking of nuclear energy
policy should occur and a
reforestation effort should be un
dertaken, he said.
Wirth concluded that "activism
must begin in each of our own
back yards."
He urged the crowd to "go to
it," asserting that the American
public has "the responsibility to
push {the Congressl."
