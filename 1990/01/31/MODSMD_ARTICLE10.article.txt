Irvine calls for grant proposals
The Irvine Foundation has given deans, de
partment chairs and faculty until Feb. 19 to sub
mit proposals for funding grants to increase the
participation of underrepresented minorities in
academic careers.
Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies
Elizabeth Traugott announced the call for pro
posals, the fourth since the six-year Irvine Foun
dation Minority Student Grant was awarded in
1988.

The $2 million grant is designed to place more
minority students in the academic pipeline
leading to faculty and research positions at Stan
ford and elsewhere.
The grant currently funds 24 projects, ranging
from small one-year class programs to parts of
complex endeavors such as the Martin Luther
King Jr. Papers Project. Roughly half the money
generated by the grant — expected to be $2.6
million at the end of the six-year- term — remains
to be distributed.

Grads are Supreme Court clerks
Stanford's connections with the U.S. Supreme
Court are getting stronger, as three recent Law
School graduates are clerking at the court during
the 1989-90 term.
The graduates are Ivan Kong, a 1987 graduate
from Gaithersburg, Md.; Richard Klinger, a 1988
graduate from Cincinnati, Ohio; and Gregory
Priest, a 1988 graduate from Los Gatos. Fong
and Klinger are clerking for Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, while Priest is working for Justice
Thurgood Marshall.
The duties of Supreme Court law clerks are
to review the petitions and cases selected for
hearing, and to assist the justices in preparing
for oral argument and drafting legal opinions.
Three members of the high court — O'Connor,
Justice Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice
William Rehnquist — went to Stanford as grad
uates or undergraduates.
