## Gorbachev resignation rumored 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bush admin
istration officials said they could not
confirm a broadcast report yesterday
that Soviet President Mikhail Gorba
chev was considering relinquishing his
post as head of the Soviet Communist
Party.
"All I can tell you ... is that it's a
rumor, and therefore it's not something
that 1 think that we should respond to
or react to," Secretary of State James
A. Baker 111 told reporters after the
report was aired by Cable News Net
work.
Baker spoke as an aide announced a
rescheduling of talks in Moscow with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shev
ardnadze and said the one-day delay
was to avoid interfering with a meeting
of the Communist Party Central Com
mittee. Baker will be in Moscow Feb.
8-9, said spokeswoman Margaret Tut
wiler.
"We're following the story, as I know
you are, and we'll have a comment if
we ever determine it's something more
than just a rumor," Baker said of the
CNN account.
CNN, quoting a "well-informed and
usually reliable" party source, said from
Moscow that the re-emergence of Gor
bachev on telvision on Tuesday did not
rule out a dramatic resignation when
the policy-setting Central Committee
meets next Monday and Tuesday.

Before the TV appearance yesterday,
Gorbachev was last seen in public Jan.
20 explaining why Soviet troops had
been sent to the Azerbaijan republic.
According to the unnamed source,
Gorbachev had resisted sending troops
into Baku, the capital of the republic,
and was suffering severe depression
over the action, CNN said.
White House chief of Staff John
Sununu told reporters the administra
tion has been "trying for the last few
hours to try and get some additional
assessments, but I don't have anything
at all."
"We would like to understand the
details of what's involved and what's
implied if such a change has taken
place," he said. "And frankly at the
time we're talking here, I don't know
if it's correct."
Bush administration officials and in
telligence sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said there has been
speculation for weeks that Gorbachev
would yield his party post — while re
taining the presidency — but that they
had no information he would take the
step.
One senior administration official
said that if true, the decision "might
mean that there's a move toward
pluralism in mind, it might mean there's
a problem, it might be a plus. And very
frankly you can create scenarios on both

sides. . . . You can make an argument
that it's a reflection of strength and you
can make an argument that it's a re
flection of weakness."
Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., Senate
chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Commitee, said he had no confirmation
of the report, but if true it "may in
fact enhance Gorbachev's chances for
survival" by making it party bosses op
posed to his policies to criticize him.
Ever since his assumption of the top
party post in 1985, Ghorbachev has
sought to separate the party and the
government. The party has ruled the
country since the 1917 revolution, with
the government a distinctly secondary
entity.
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior
member of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee, said he had no independent
knowledge of Gorbachev's plans but that
a resignation as party leader would rep
resent an important loss of power for
the Soviet leader and throw uncertainty
into U.S.-Soviet relations.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-
Kan., said the report should mean cau
tion about cutting military spending:
"Let's call off this mad rush to spend
a dividend we don't even have yet."
Baker said American diplomats in
Moscow "know just about the same
thing that all the rest of us know right
now."
