WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge
yesterday ordered former President
Reagan to provide excerpts of his personal
diaries to John M. Poindexter for the
former national security adviser's upcom
ing Iran-Contra trial.
U.S. District Court Judge Harold
Greene said a 1985 entry includes a
"somewhat ambiguous comment" indicat-
Reagan knew of Poindexter's
worK tor the Nicaraguan Contras.
Greene said Reagan must surrender
the material by Monday, a move that
could trigger a claim of executive privilege

by the former president and might delay
the Feb. 20 starting date of the Poindex
ter trial.
Reagan submitted more than 100 diary
entries to the judge last Thursday. Greene
said entries covering more than 29 dif
ferent dates in 1985 and 1986 contain
"information of significance."
Theodore Olson, one of Reagan's
lawyers, declined to comment.
If Reagan balks at turning over the
material, Greene said he would provide
the former president and the Justice De
partment with a secret document Poin

dexter submitted to the court outlining
why he needs the diaries.
After court filings by all sides, includ
ing Iran-Contra prosecutors, the court
will "make a final decision with respect
to enforcement of the subpoena" for the
diaries, Greene said.
Reagan was ordered to give Poindexter
a diary entry relating to a "successful"
trip Poindexter took in December 1985
to Central America.
"The entry includes a somewhat am
biguous comment arguably indicating
that the former president knew" of Poin

dexter's "activities on behalf of the Con
tras," Greene said.
The judge said Poindexter is entitled
to diary entries in which Reagan describes
an effort to persuade the government of
Honduras to release a seized arms ship
ment that had been destined for the Con
tras.
Greene also said Poindexter must
receive diary -cusing on U.S.
military-type assistance to an uniden
tified Central American country that may
have been used in support of the Contras.
The entries "may show what types of

aid President Reagan thought could
legally be provided for the military or
paramilitary operations of the Contras,"
Greene said.
Poindexter also is entitled to Reagan's
diary entries concerning meetings with
Poindexter and others in December 1985
"to discuss the sales of arms to Iran,"
Green said, adding that one entry "ad
dresses .Lilwi..* issue of the proceeds
from these sales."
Reagan has denied knowing about the
diversion and Poindexter testified before
Congress that he didn't tell the president.
