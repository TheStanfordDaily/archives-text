### 
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) - The Na
tional Salvation Front government bowed
to the clamor from the opposition yesterday
and announced it had split into two groups,,
one to govern Romania and the other to
take part in coming elections.
In a further concession, senior Front
member Silviu Brucan said the Front would
propose that a coalition government be
formed until the planned May 20 elections
— in effect agreeing to share the power it
assumed during the December revolution
that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
A transcript of Brucan's comments to
selected reporters was made avaliable to
The Associated Press.
Both decisions were clearly meant to ap
pease increasingly strident attacks directed
against the Front. Opposition groups ac
cuse it of reneging on its word to run
Romania only until the elections, of refus
ing to share its access to news media and
other misuse of power.
Foes of the Front argue that a self
declared interim government should not
contest elections it will stage itself. Week
end demonstrations demanded that the
government resign.
In Washington, the State Department

earlier yesterday accused the National
Salvation Front of intimidating the oppo
sition and said department human rights
j,)i rect^liw&M"^£chil Lgr was in Buchattst
"forcefully stating our concerns."
Yesterday, Brucan, a member of the
Front's National Council, declared:
"We believe it is illegal for the front to
hold political power and take part in elec
tions at the same time."
"That is why we have split into a
provisional National Council, to hold
legislative power on the one hand, and the
National Salvation Front, which is to take
part in the elections as a political organi
zation, on the other."
Brucan said the government would sug
gest the opposition parties "take part in
the provisional National Council in order
to guarantee the objectivity of the elec
tions," when discussions between the gov
ernment and the opposition resume tomor
row.
In other developments yesterday, a mil
itary tribunal was told that Ceausescu's
defense minister, Vasile Milea, was not
killed on Ceausescu's orders, but killed him
self rather than give orders to fire on anti-
Ceaucescu demonstrators.
