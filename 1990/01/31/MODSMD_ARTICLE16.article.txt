Baltic peace proposal
RIGA, U.S.S.R. (AP) - Baltic
separatists say they have arranged an
unusual attempt to resolve bloody
strife in the Caucasus because that
conflict could jeopardize their own
peaceful drive for democracy.
After a week of intense work, Baltic
People's Front leaders said Armenians
and Azerbaijanis have agreed to meet
in Riga, capital of Latvia.
Representatives of the Armenian
All-National Movement and the
People's Front of Azerbaijan are tenta
tively scheduled to meet tomorrow,
but travel problems could delay the
discussions.
Reunification discussed
MOSCOW (AP) â€” President Mik
hail S. Gorbachev met yesterday with
East German Premier Hans Modrow
and appeared to be more open toward
eventual German reunification.

Modrow told reporters after the
meeting that Gorbachev "did not rule
out such a prospect in the future, and
at the same time did not venture to
set some time limits for that."
Earlier, the Kremlin chief said any
such decisions must include the four
Allied powers and take into account
European opinions.
More money for East
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
Democrats yesterday proposed a half
billion dollar aid package, $200 million
more than President Bush wants, to
foster emerging democracies in East
ern Europe.
The bill, introduced by Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. and the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee chair
man, would augment $738 million in
aid already approved for Poland and
Hungary with $511 million targeted
at Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.

Base closings with a bang
WASHINGTON (AP) - The chair
man of the House Armed Services
Committee accused the Bush admin
istration yesterday of putting "a po
litical gun to the head" of lawmakers
with a partisan list of military base
closings.
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney's list of more
than 72 domestic facilities and 14
overseas installations that would be
closed or scaled back had "potential."
But he objected strongly to the way
the administration wants Congress to
deal with the list.
"This is merely a list of candidates
for closure," Aspin told reporters at
a news conference. "The upshot is that
the list can be changed. Bases can be
deleted or perhaps added. That creates
hostages for the administration. Vote
against a veto override, your base is
safe. Vote to override, your base is
threatened."
