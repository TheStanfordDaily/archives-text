Recent police raid
brings up question
of campus drug use

WITH THE POLICE RAID
of the AD House, Stanford
has been added to the list
of battlegrounds in the war on
drugs.
The incident gives us the oppor
tunity to take a broader look at
the question of drug use on
campus. Are many students on
campus using drugs? If so, what
should the University and the
police do?
The first question is fairly dif
ficult to answer, since we live in
a community which operates on
trust and in which our privacy is
respected to a great degree.
Of course, each year when the
Grateful Dead trucks onto campus,
there are a number of highly
publicized drug busts and it is
probably true that per capita drug
use on campus skyrockets. But
what about when the Dead are not
in town?
Well, many studies of campus
drug use have been done, but none
have offered any clear, hard facts
about the extent of the activity.
While this is true, it is also true
that no one is arguing that the
campus is clean.
If you take it for granted that
some recreational use of controlled
substances goes on at Stanford, the
question is what should be done.
Until the AD House raid, it

seemed as if the University was
applying the same "see no evil,
hear no evil, speak no evil" policy
to drug use that it applies to alcohol
consumption by minors on
campus.
Although no drugs were found
in the AD House, the raid drove
home an important lesson. Stan
ford is not an "ivory (or even a
sandstone) tower" and students are
not above the law.
If students on campus are using
drugs, the bottom line is that they
are illegal. The police should be
commended for following up on
their tip. It is certainly better for
police to spend their time searching
for drug users and dealers on
campus than for them to spend it
busting students who have not reg
istered their bikes.
If students are found with drugs,
the law should take over. If stu
dents are proven to be drug dealers,
it should be not only a crime but
also a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
Even though drug dealers do not
force their clients to buy drugs, if
students are selling drugs, they are
encouraging drug use by their fel
low students. Therefore, it is no
longer a personal problem. It is a
community problem and should be
a Fundamental Standard violation.
The police should come down
just as hard on people who are
doing and dealing drugs on campus
as they would on someone who was
doing or dealing drugs in East Palo
Alto. And that also means not call
ing to ask to borrow the key to
the house first, because they don't
want to "damage a door."
