# Big change planned for Draw
## Housing Office considers proposal to eliminate Round Two 
### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
Round Two of the Draw will be elim
inated this spring if a new proposal
from the Housing Office meets with
approval.
The proposal, designed to reduce stu
dent anxiety over housing options and
to simplify the housing procedure, also
suggests moving the Draw three weeks
later into spring quarter.
Under the current system, potential
resident assistants and overseas studies
candidates are chosen and fraternity
rushees accept bids after Round One of
the Draw. Because approximately 700
people pull out of the Draw, Round Two
is needed to fill their spaces.
Changing the date of the Draw will
eliminate the need for a second round
because those 700 students will no

longer need to partici
pate in the annual lot
tery.
A major benefit of the
proposed change, ex
plained Housing Center
Director Rodger Whit
ney, will be the stream
lining of the complex
procedure currently in
place.

"In Round Two, we basically pull out
700 students who were shopping just to
see what number they got. Now, people
will have to make decisions about what
they want before the Draw," said Whit
ney.
Housing officials hope the changes
will lessen the confusion and anxiety
students encounter in dealing with Draw
deadlines. In addition, with only one
round and one set of housing results,

the office will have a simpler task in
assigning students.
Whitney pointed out that the general
procedures of the Draw will remain un
changed. Students will still be able to
join waiting lists, and the center will
still try to reunite divided groups.
Although rushees can attend dor
mitory open houses before accepting a
bid from a fraternity, they will no longer
be able to choose a draw number before
making a decision.
The proposal is currently under
review by RAs, resident fellows and the
Interfraternity Council. Housing offi
cials will meet today with the student
faculty Housing Operations Advisory
Committee to discuss the new system,
and wili conduct a public meeting next
week.

"I think we'll get a lot of sup
port. I see a consensus developing,
and we will know for sure in a
week," said Whitney.
Several RFs expressed approval
of the plan. The current Draw
procedure "is on people's minds
for a lot longer than it needs to
be," said Roble RF Ann Porteus,
who has seen its effects on stu
dents for the past five years.

"There are already many things
during spring quarter which can
detract from the dorm's sense of
community," Porteus said.
IFC President Todd Ortega, an
RAin Cedro House, said he favors
the new plan.
"My initial impression is that
the new proposal is very good.
Everything will take place after
Rush, so rushees will be making
their decisions completely on the
basis of their fraternity experi
ences (and not on their draw num
ber). That can only be good for
fraternities," said Ortega.

Many students also welcomed
the proposal, remembering the
time and stress involved with sort
ing out housing and grouping.
"I think it's a really good idea.
The Draw itself is bad enough
without having to go through two
rounds," said Su-Fei Wong, an un
declared sophomore.
"The Draw is by its nature com
plex, as it reflects a diverse
housing system. We're always
thinking of ways to make the
process easier, so students can
actually go to school," said Whit
ney.
