# Big change planned for Draw
## Housing Office considers proposal to eliminate Round Two 
### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
Round Two of the Draw will be elim
inated this spring if a new proposal
from the Housing Office meets with
approval.
The proposal, designed to reduce stu
dent anxiety over housing options and
to simplify the housing procedure, also
suggests moving the Draw three weeks
later into spring quarter.
Under the current system, potential
resident assistants and overseas studies
candidates are chosen and fraternity
rushees accept bids after Round One of
the Draw. Because approximately 700
people pull out of the Draw, Round Two
is needed to fill their spaces.
Changing the date of the Draw will
eliminate the need for a second round
because those 700 students will no

longer need to partici
pate in the annual lot
tery.
A major benefit of the
proposed change, ex
plained Housing Center
Director Rodger Whit
ney, will be the stream
lining of the complex
procedure currently in
place.

"In Round Two, we basically pull out
700 students who were shopping just to
see what number they got. Now, people
will have to make decisions about what
they want before the Draw," said Whit
ney.
Housing officials hope the changes
will lessen the confusion and anxiety
students encounter in dealing with Draw
deadlines. In addition, with only one
round and one set of housing results,

the office will have a simpler task in
assigning students.
Whitney pointed out that the general
procedures of the Draw will remain un
changed. Students will still be able to
join waiting lists, and the center will
still try to reunite divided groups.
Although rushees can attend dor
mitory open houses before accepting a
bid from a fraternity, they will no longer
be able to choose a draw number before
making a decision.
The proposal is currently under
review by RAs, resident fellows and the
Interfraternity Council. Housing offi
cials will meet today with the student
faculty Housing Operations Advisory
Committee to discuss the new system,
and wili conduct a public meeting next
week.
