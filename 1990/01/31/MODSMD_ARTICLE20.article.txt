## A
						few words about words 
### 
SOME PEOPLE THINK of words in
terms of numbers. As in, "250
words per double-spaced page using
a size 12 font means I need six pages to
reach the 1,500-word minimum on my
Cultures, Ideas and Values paper."
But two campus publications recently
ran pieces dealing with a more substan
tive view of words and questioning the
significance and desirability of certain
terms.
A Stanford Review editorial last week
satirized the move toward changing sexist
or otherwise offensive language. It
mocked the attempt to modify words like
freshman by proposing that all words
with man as a root be abolished â€” in
cluding the word woman.
It ridiculed the theory that using sexist
words leads to a sexist society which leads
to various offenses against women.
The Daily also ventured into the word
war last Wednesday by printing a number
of viewpoints debating the correctness of
certain words, such as frosh vs. freshman,
African-American vs. black, and rape sur
vivor vs. victim.
In The Review's piece, the idea that
words can translate into real action was
derided. The notion that speech which
diminishes women can lead to behavior
and attitudes which diminish women was
dismissed as ridiculous.
Some of The Daily staffers took the
opposite stance. They said that using
non-discriminatory words plays a part in
the effort to reduce sexism and racism
in society. Words can affect those they
reach, according to these observers.
Although the two positions seem

mutually exclusive, both are partially cor
rect.
The Review article was right in imply
ing that the link between words and ac
tions can be a weak one. Words uttered
or written without conviction do not nec
essarily produce results and can be some
what meaningless.
A recent example would be President
Bush's criticism of the Chinese govern
ment after the Tiananmen Square Mas
sacre.
Although he condemned the Chinese
leadership after the incident occurred,
Bush's words lost their meaning when a
few months later one of his aides drank
champagne with top Chinese officials
while negotiating the sale of communi
cation satellites to that country.
So The Review's doubts about the
causal link between words and observable
behavior are understandable and even
somewhat accurate.
But some of The Daily staffers are also
right. Words don't exist in a vacuum,
unconnected to the society they are used
in or the people who use them. While
they may not be the direct cause of dis
crimination or violence, a society's vocab
ulary does contribute to an atmosphere
that makes such injustices more
tolerable.
It would seem strange to use terms
like policewomen, firewomen or
postwomen to describe all the members
of these professions, yet for many years
the usage of men in that context, and
the subsequent division of jobs by gender,
prevailed.
Similarly, calling Asian-Americans yel

low or Native Americans red in the past
made it easier to ignore the culture and
history of these people by denying their
background.
Although the connection between
words and beliefs and behavior may be
an ambiguous one, the idea that vocab
ulary plays a part in the formation of
individual and societal attitudes and ac
tions should not be disregarded.
Over the past weeks, on a much smaller
scale, I've personally realized that a col
lection of words can produce results. I've
learned that they can provoke letters say
ing, "You are a cretinl" or "Fall on your
knees right now and ask Jesus Christ to
save your soul."
I've found they can inspire friends and
strangers to come up with such helpful
comments as "Good column," "Liked your
column," "That was an interesting
column" or "Your column was really stu
pid this week."
I've discovered they can cause your
misspelled name to be included in the
truly hilarious, and sometimes even
coherent, campus cartoon strip.
And I've also learned that it takes
about 600 words at size 12 font to fill
this space each week.
