## Some non-faculty make excellent freshman advisers 
### 
AMID JUSTIFIABLE campus
concern about attitudes and
behavior toward women and
minorities, we can forget underlying
principles which apply to everyone.
One such principle is the virtue of
treating all people as individuals rather
than as members of this or that group.
Another is the wisdom of doing unto
others as we'd have them do unto us.
If Art History Prof. Albert Elsen had
taken these principles into account, he
might have modified his Jan. 17 letter
to The Daily, in which he lamented the
early retirement of the admirable Bob
Beyers from Stanford News Service.

This letter is not about Beyers,
however. It is about the troublesome
attitude exemplified by Elsen's public
characterization of Beyers as one of
those "rare non-faculty members the
Stanford faculty considers a colleague."
Probably I'm not the only person
who winced at Elsen's implication that
Stanford faculty members do not, in
general, consider the rest of us around
here as colleague material.
But only after reading The Dialy's
editorial of Jan. 24, which called for
getting rid of non-faculty freshman
advisers, did I feel compelled to write.

The Daily and Elsen seem to think a
lot alike.
The Daily is right. Each student
should feel comfortable about approach
ing faculty members. Having a faculty
adviser may help to demystify the
professoriate, but there are other ways
as well.
To say about non-faculty advisers
that "freshmen. . . deserve more,"
lumps graduate students and staff
members into a campus underclass. Yet
many of them make excellent advisers.
A shortage of academic arrogance is
one of Stanford's more attractive char
acteristics. For those of us whose work

is primarily outside the classroom, the
opportunity to serve as freshman
advisers can be rewarding both person
ally and professionally.
More than once, incidentally, have I
felt satisfaction in recommending that
an advisee take an art history course
from my noted colleague Elsen.
Please be careful to avoid unwar
ranted and hurtful generalizations
when engaging in another attractive
Stanford characteristic: making the
place even better than it is.
