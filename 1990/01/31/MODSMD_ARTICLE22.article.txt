# New phone system will allow University to increase rates
## 
### 
It is interesting that one of the
touted features of the new University
phone system is individual billing; it's
not mentioned that there will still be
transfer of money among roommates
to pay for connection fee and monthly
service charges.
Communication Services Director Jan
Thomson said (in The Daily, Jan. 29)
that the weekend rates from the new
system are 5 to 15 percent lower than
AT&T's, depending on the call.
She failed to mention that with
AT&T's "Reach Out America" plan,
you can get savings on all calls day
and night, and the total savings exceed
the University's plan. I did not see a
mention of other phone services' (such
as Sprint or MCI) savings either.
And about rate increases, it will not
be too difficult for Stanford to find
uses — which does not include giving
it back to students — for surplus reve

nue in order to be within 5 percent of
breaking even.
We're told the University's goal with
this new phone system is to "provide
high-quality service while maintaining
cost-efficiency." From what I know
about this system, neither goal is
achieved, compared with the service I
receive now from Pacific Bell and
AT&T.
