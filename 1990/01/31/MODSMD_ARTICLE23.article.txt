# New alcohol policy formulated to reduce University's liability
## 
### 
There have been a lot of pieces
about the proposed drinking rules —
everything from the puke-green carpets
to George Shultz's bar tab — but I
don't think that people really under
stand what these proposed regulations
are for.
My undergraduate living group (at
another school) had the same rule
about spending dorm funds on alcohol,

and it has one simple purpose: to re
move any legal liability in a dorm
drinking accident.
The ASSU collects dorm fees, and
unknown to many people, they keep
about 4 percent.
When a dorm throws a party using
ASSU-collected fees, Stanford has pro
vided a channel for, and profited from,
students getting intoxicated.
If a student became intoxicated at a
dorm party and got hurt, the Univer
sity would be open to a lawsuit. By
restricting dorm funds to non-alcohol
uses, the University legally separates
itself from any student drinking.
These regulations are not usually
designed to discourage students from
drinking — students can still "pass the
hat" for alcohol, and this was the case
at my undergraduate living group.
In fact, if students cold be counted
on to pay dorm fees directly to their
dorm treasurer (I'm told this hasn't
worked out in the past at Stanford),
students could save money, avoid the
regulations and not even need the hat.
