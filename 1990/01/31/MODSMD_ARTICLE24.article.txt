# Bring back 'frosh seminars' for more faculty/frosh contact

The appeal of the Jan. 24 Daily's
editorial "Advise us, oh faculty" should
not go unanswered. There are two
simple ways to accomplish this request:
We used to have "freshman semi
nars" which consisted of advisees and
met weekly in the adviser's home. By
combining a rather mild form of in
struction with advising during the first
or the first two quarters, a close bond
was established such as the editorial
viat'wl'zes, and this bond lasted many
years.
Another way to achieve the same
end desired by The Daily would be to
have instructors in courses largely
taken by freshmen serve a number of
their students as advisers.
Either way both faculty and students
may find advising more attractive and
more satisfactory.
