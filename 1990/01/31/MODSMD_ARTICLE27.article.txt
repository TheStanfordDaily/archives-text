## Compact bulbs a bright idea 
### Jessica Hirst Staff writer 
Who would have thought I
would figure out how to save
money by dragging myself out of
bed for my 8 a.m. Environmental
Science and Technology class one
day last quarter?
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil
Masters always seems to choose
those boring subjects, the ones
that begin to sound interesting
only when he starts lecturing. You
know, like incinerators, ground
water and refrigerators.

This particular day's topic was
light bulbs, not an inherently in
teresting subject. But in that
class, Masters talked of the future
of light bulbs: the compact fluo
rescent.
Most people are familiar with
the typical incandescent light bulb
— the ones used whenever Wile
E. Coyote has a bright idea. These
bulbs are inexpensive, about 65
cents, but they burn out quickly
and consume a lot of power for
the light they provide.
The long, cylindrical fluorescent
bulb is also a well-known sight,
and though they are more energy
efficient than incandescent bulbs,
you would be sorely pressed to
put a typical fluorescent bulb into
your desk lamp.
Compact fluorescent bulbs are
the answer. They can be screwed
into most conventional incandes
cent light fixtures and have
several distinct advantages over
incandescent bulbs.
A compact fluorescent bulb uses

only one-fourth of the energy to
produce the same amount of light
as the incandescent bulb you may
be using to read this newspaper.
Over its lifetime, a single compact
fluorescent bulb avoids the bur
ning of 400 pounds of coal.
That is roughly equivalent to
preventing one-half a ton of car
bon dioxide and 20 pounds of sul
fur dioxide from being released
into the atmosphere. Carbon
dioxide is responsible for 50 per
cent of the greenhouse effect, the
heating of the earth caused by
the trapping of sunlight in the
atmosphere.
Emissions have increased by a
factor of 53 since the onset of the
industrial revolution, with 5.5 bil
lion tons added to the atmosphere
every year.
Sulfur dioxide is an air pol
lutant responsible for acid rain,
respiratory problems and damage
to vegetation, paint and metals.
Compact fluorescent bulbs cost
from $8 to $28 each, but they last
10 times as long as a conventional
bulb and more than pay for them
selves in terms of electricity
savings and replacement bulb
costs.
I first met a compact fluores
cent bulb in my Civil Engineering
170 problem set. The class showed
that a compact fluorescent bulb
saves 450 kilowatt-hours over its
10,000-hour life.
A consumer spends $41 to run
incandescent bulbs for 10,000
hours while spending only $24 to
use compact fluorescent bulbs for
the same period. The savings
results from getting the same
amount of light as is provided by
a 60-watt incandescent bulb for
only 15 watts.
Now here's the real winner.
Planting trees and using nuclear
power, other methods to reduce
carbon emissions, cost money in
the long run.

Compact fluorescent bulbs ac
tually result in a savings of $150
per ton of carbon saved. Although
you may groan at forking over
$15 versus 50 cents for the initial
cost of a light bulb, you are ac
tually spending much less in the
long run than you would to pol
lute.
Lighting is responsible for
about 25 percent of total U.S. elec
tricity use. By cutting down on
the amount of electricity you con
sume, it is possible to make a
significant impact on total energy
costs, both financially and en
vironmentally.
Stanford has already installed
compact fluorescent bulbs in the
lounge of the Business School, in
the Terman Engineering Building
and in the outer walkway of the
Quad. In addition, Julie Coopet
of the Housing Energy Conserva
tion Center reports that "the
majority of common areas in
housing are all fluorescent."
Senior physics major Karen
Orth has installed her own com
pact fluorescent "track lighting"
system in her room. Compact
fluorescent bulbs are larger and
heavier than incandescent bulbs,
and are not appropriate for all
light fixtures.
Orth bought a light socket and
cord at a hardware store, and
created a paper lampshade. She
bought the bulb at Stanford
Electric Works in Palo Alto. The
entire apparatus moves along a
rope tied at either end of her
room. Definitely classy.
Compact fluorescent bulbs save
money, energy, shopping time and
landfill space and also preserve
air quality. In the immortal words
of Masters, you have to ask your
self, "Is this a free lunch? Is this
better than a free lunch?" In this
case, the answer is a resounding
"yes."

Who would have thought I
would figure out how to save
money by dragging myself out of
bed for my 8 a.m. Environmental
Science and Technology class one
day last quarter?
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil
Masters always seems to choose
those boring subjects, the ones
that begin to sound interesting
only when he starts lecturing. You
know, like incinerators, ground
water and refrigerators.

This particular day's topic was
light bulbs, not an inherently in
teresting subject. But in that
class, Masters talked of the future
of light bulbs: the compact fluo
rescent.
Most people are familiar with
the typical incandescent light bulb
— the ones used whenever Wile
E. Coyote has a bright idea. These
bulbs are inexpensive, about 65
cents, but they burn out quickly
and consume a lot of power for
the light they provide.
The long, cylindrical fluorescent
bulb is also a well-known sight,
and though they are more energy
efficient than incandescent bulbs,
you would be sorely pressed to
put a typical fluorescent bulb into
your desk lamp.
Compact fluorescent bulbs are
the answer. They can be screwed
into most conventional incandes
cent light fixtures and have
several distinct advantages over
incandescent bulbs.
A compact fluorescent bulb uses

only one-fourth of the energy to
produce the same amount of light
as the incandescent bulb you may
be using to read this newspaper.
Over its lifetime, a single compact
fluorescent bulb avoids the bur
ning of 400 pounds of coal.
That is roughly equivalent to
preventing one-half a ton of car
bon dioxide and 20 pounds of sul
fur dioxide from being released
into the atmosphere. Carbon
dioxide is responsible for 50 per
cent of the greenhouse effect, the
heating of the earth caused by
the trapping of sunlight in the
atmosphere.
Emissions have increased by a
factor of 53 since the onset of the
industrial revolution, with 5.5 bil
lion tons added to the atmosphere
every year.
Sulfur dioxide is an air pol
lutant responsible for acid rain,
respiratory problems and damage
to vegetation, paint and metals.
Compact fluorescent bulbs cost
from $8 to $28 each, but they last
10 times as long as a conventional
bulb and more than pay for them
selves in terms of electricity
savings and replacement bulb
costs.
I first met a compact fluores
cent bulb in my Civil Engineering
170 problem set. The class showed
that a compact fluorescent bulb
saves 450 kilowatt-hours over its
10,000-hour life.
A consumer spends $41 to run
incandescent bulbs for 10,000
hours while spending only $24 to
use compact fluorescent bulbs for
the same period. The savings
results from getting the same
amount of light as is provided by
a 60-watt incandescent bulb for
only 15 watts.
Now here's the real winner.
Planting trees and using nuclear
power, other methods to reduce
carbon emissions, cost money in
the long run.

Compact fluorescent bulbs ac
tually result in a savings of $150
per ton of carbon saved. Although
you may groan at forking over
$15 versus 50 cents for the initial
cost of a light bulb, you are ac
tually spending much less in the
long run than you would to pol
lute.
