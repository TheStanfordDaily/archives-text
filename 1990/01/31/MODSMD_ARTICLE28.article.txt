## Stanford nerve chips offer technology for artificial limbs

It won't happen overnight. It
might not even happen in
several years, but the progress
is overwhelming, and the possi
bilities, say Stanford research
ers, are astounding.
What is it? It is a silicon chip
containing living nerve tissue
which may eventually lead to a
bionic person.
For the past two years, a
group of Stanford researchers
from the fields of biology, med
icine and electrical engineering
have been working on the
"nerve chip project." The project
raises the possibility of using
microchips to repair damaged
nerves.
Bernard Widrow, professor of
electrical engineering and pres
ident of the International
Neural Network Society com
ments, "For now, we are trying
to build an interface between a
peripheral nerve in an am
putated stump and a prosthesis
(an artificial limb)."
The task is horribly compli
cated by the fact that the nerve
has thousands of signals that
must be translated effectively
into a few useful signals. To
make matters worse, the human
body has an estimated 10 billion
neurons, all interconnected.
On Jan. 15 at the Interna
tional Joint Conference on
Neural Networks in Washing
ton, D.C., Widrow presented his
team's research. A year ago, the
Stanford research group im
planted a microchip in the foot
nerve of a rat, to create com
munication links between an ar
tificial network and the nervous
system.

The human body
has an estimated
10 billion neurons
in a complicated
network.

After a year, the experiment
was a huge success but on a
tiny scale. Individual nerve
fibers about 4 millionths of a
meter in diameter connected
again from the ends of the nerve
and grew through holes at one
end of the silicon chip. The holes
were about 1 millimeter by 3.6
millimeters.
Scientists were able to trans
mit and received signals from
the chip through a computer
acting as a neural network. The
artificial network models the
highly complex network of nerve
cells in the nervous system.
The team someday hopes to
apply this technology to a sys
tem that can electronically con
trol a human prosthesis by
relaying messages normally sent
to the limb from the brain.
But the big problem is that
"the nerves in the limb and the
prosthesis do not reconnect cor
rectly," says Greg Kovacs, a
Stanford medical student and a
doctoral candidate in electrical
engineering who designed the
chip. After the reattachment,
the electronic signals from the
brain get "scrambled" in the
damaged area, adds Kovacs.
The microchip, in connection
with the neural network, is re
sponsible for decoding this input

and sending out the proper in
formation to the robotic limb.
"Thousands of signals are sent
to the chip, but we want to pick
out only about 10 to 100 of
them, the most important
ones," says Widrow, "and make
them work."
A type of glove, similar to the
one manufactured by Nintendo
for use with video games, could
actually serve as a "artificial
learning system" for a patient
with a prosthetic hand. It con
tains sensors that follow the ar
ticulation of various joints in
the positions of the fingers.
"By placing the gloves on both
the healthy and the damaged
hands, the brain is able to learn
to adjust for the error signals,"
explains Widrow. But, he cau
tions, "You could never obtain
the exquisite control of the nat
ural hand."
"We're not there yet," em
phasizes Dr. Joseph Rosen, a
plastic surgeon in the Stanford
School of Medicine who is part
of the nerve chip project team.
"We would like to take a patient
with nerve injuries and utilize
the natural control signals
(decoded by the chip) in con
trolling prosthesis. . . but we are
working towards a goal that
could take a decade, even two
decades, to realize," Rosen says.
"The initial results are
promising but it's a long-term
project that when complete will
be of major importance," Rosen
says. But even if now it is only
a single chip in a single nerve,
in a few years it could be several
chips together creating a man
machine "bionic" interface.
The research project is funded
by the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
