Thin films conference
The past few years have been marked by rapid
advances in the technology of magnetic storage
of information. Recent advances in the develop
ment of thin films have been the impetus behind
the technology advances.
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center will
host a daylong workshop Friday on thin films.
Workshop speakers will also review advances
in recent research and methods for studying thin
film metal multilayer materials. One of theses

sions will involve information storage Other top
ics covered at the conference include:
• An overview of materials technology require
ments for increased area and volume information
storage densities microscopy
• Techniques for mechanical property studies of
thin magnetic films
• Grazing incidence X-ray scattering
Advance registration is requested. The regis
tration fee is $225 for the general public and
$50 for Stanford students and faculty. For infor
mation, call Roni Dunn.
