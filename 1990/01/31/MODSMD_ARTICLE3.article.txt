# Lagunita not definitely dried up
## Senate representatives to determine student opinion on filling lake 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night approved
a bill asking that representatives of the
senate visit dorms to determine the
opinions of students on the issue of
filling Lake Lagunita.
While the bill appropriated no money
toward the lake, it stated that the ASSU
"is considering payment of $9,000 in
'matching funds.' " The money would
be taken from ASSU Annual Reserves.
Last spring, the office of the Dean of
Student Affairs redirected funds nor
mally used to pay for lifeguards and
other expenses to cover a 300 percent
rise in ASSU insurance costs. ASSU

insurance rose to $45,000, up from
$15,000 last year.
With the money normally used to pay
for the lake being used for insurance,
the University Lake Commission is cur
rently searching for alternative methods
of funding.
Commenting on the bill, Michael Jack
son, associate dean of student affairs,
said the University "is committed to
having Lake Lagunita" in the long run,
but funding in the short term will be
difficult to find. He added that the
ASSU general budget will be scrutinized
to determine whether there are some
funds that could be rechanneled.
Jackson cautioned senators about
taking funds from the reserves, an ac

count normally used for incidental and
emergency expenses.
"Do we consider this to be an emer
gency?" he asked.
Jackson also cautioned senators about
setting a precedent by paying for a
lifeguard this year but not being able
to continue support in coming years.
The bill passed on an undivided voice
vote.
University President Donald Kennedy
presented his quarterly address to the
senate. Declaring that the University is
"facing significant resource strains,"
Kennedy cautioned that "we must
choose carefully what we commit our-
selves to."
Kennedy said the budgetary dif
ficulty was in large part due to
the earthquake and the "increas
ing reluctance" of the federal gov
ernment to fund research.
Responding to senators' written
questions, Kennedy commented
that the tone of the queries all
seemed to be antagonistic towards
University administration and of
ficials.
Rut he assured the senate that
"we, like you, want to do the right
thing." His comment referred to
last summer's Spike Lee film, "Do
the Right Thing."
The Council of Presidents pre
sented its annual "state of the

association" address.
COP member Aimee Allison
gave a short history of the ASSU
and its progress over the last few
years. She said the ASSU has
aided students "to embrace the
motion toward a multicultural
community, in a renewed spirit of
serving our communities and a
humane desire to solve the ills
facing our society"
COP member Ingrid Nava out
lined ASSU goals for coming
years. Most of the goals concerned
giving students a more active voice
in ASSU affairs.
Nava said the ASSU will be
working to create "a student gov
ernment that involves all the stu
dents. . . . That is why we are for
the first time taking the decisions
of the ASSU out to the dorms in

an effort to further democratize
the ASSU."
Nava concluded by saying that
"things are all right now, and they
will be even better in the future.'
