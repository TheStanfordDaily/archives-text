# Cholesterol testing questioned
## 
### Sue Biggins Staff writer 
Products are often marked with
labels touting low cholesterol. But
in the last few months, some sci
entists have stated that there is
no proof that cholesterol levels can
predict health.
The debate has caused confu
sion about whether cholesterol
testing is necessary.
Within the health community,
the general consensus is that a
cholesterol level of 200 milligrams
per decaliter or less is not a health
threat. Those with a level greater
than this might have an increased
risk of heart disease.
Some researchers feel that
there is little evidence for or
against cholesterol level as an in
dicator of heart disease risk, es
pecially in women and the elderly.
Although cholesterol levels may

not be an ideal measure, they do
offer information that would be
foolish to ignore, since heart
damage is reversible. Hardening
of the arteries has been found in
adolescents, so everyone who is
18 or over should be tested. The
cholesterol test is fast and painless
and involves giving a small
amount of blood.
Any person with a risk factor
for coronary heart disease should
be tested. Risk factors include
being male, having a family his-

Tory of heart disease, smoking,
having high blood pressure,
having diabetes and being more
than 30 percent overweight.
Anyone who has a low choles
terol level should be tested again
in one to five years in case the
level is increasing. A high test
result should be repeated to con
firm it. A confirmed high choles
terol level may require a
cholesterol reduction program.
Children in a family with a his
tory of high cholesterol should be
tested to determine if dietary
saturated fats and cholesterol
should be reduced. Children
younger than five years need the
cholesterol to grow and should not
control their diet.
Although a person with high
cholesterol may not develop heart
disease, it is impossible to rule
out.
