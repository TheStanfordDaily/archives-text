# Healthy mind speeds healing

### Katherine Hemela Staff writer 
Scientists have long puzzled
whether strong mental health
could affect physical ailments, and
recent Stanford research may
have provided that crucial link.
"The brain is such a complex
organ; it would be surprising if it
had the capacity to do nothing
more than to buy insurance," said
Dr. David Spiegel, associate pro
fessor of psychiatry, at a sympo
sium at the Medical Center Jan.

Spiegel *8 research on the effects
of psychosocial treatment on sur
vival of patients with breast can
cer clearly showed an essential
relationship between the mind
and the body.
Spiegel and colleagues, who
first began their research 15 years
ago, studied 86 women about 50
years old with recurring breast
cancer. The women were ran
domly assigned either to a group
that received psychotherapy or
one that did not.
"The women (in the therapy
group) came to care very deeply
for one another," Spiegel said.
"We encouraged mutual support
while helping the patients face and
deal with death."
The. researchers found "highly
significant" results, according to
Spiegel. While there was no ap
parent change in disease progres
sion in either group, the survival
time of the women who received
therapy was double the time of
those who did not.

"Frankly, I did not expect this.
But there is no other way to ac
count for it but through the ef
fects of psychology," Spiegel said.
"It was being a part of these sup
port groups that made the differ
ence. "
Dr. Karl Goodkin, associate pro
fessor of psychiatry at the Uni
versity of Miami's Biopsychosocial
Center for the Study of AIDS,
found similar results with patients
who tested positive for the AIDS
virus.
Goodkin found a definite cor
relation between coping with their
illness and stress level. The num
ber of cells directly invaded by
the AIDS virus for those under
low stress who coped actively was
937 per cubic millimeter. It
decreased to 828 for those under
high stress.
On the other hand, those who
coped passively with low stress
only had 795 cells per cubic mil
limeter, which further decreased
to 631 for the high stress group.
Thus, the psychological well
being of the patients had a clear
impact on the physiology of the
participants, the researchers con
cluded.
A third study of patients with
arthritis further indicated
evidence of the effects of psychol
ogy on illness. Dr. Halstead Hol
man, professor of medicine at
Stanford and an expert on psy
chosocial factors in arthritis,
found that the pain and depres
sion levels of patients who under
went a five-session therapy course
declined even though their phys

ical disability did not change.
"We found that the people who
did well did not believe that their
arthritis had irretrievably
damaged their lives and they felt
they could do something about
it," Holman stated. "The people
who did not do well felt that they
were helpless."
"This seemed to indicate per
ceived self-efficacy, which is the
confidence that one can do certain
things," Holman said. Thus, Hol
man and associates designed an
instrument which would measure
perceived self-efficacy to cope
with the consequences of
arthritis.
"To our pleasant surprise, we
got very high correlations be
tween their perceived self-efficacy
and the results of the course," he
said.
The research, conducted over a
period of many years, has involved
thousands of patients. Some
patients have been studied for four
years, in which time the level of
pain and depression has remained
low. "So this effect lasts," Holman
concluded.
"This is an additional benefit
beyond conventional medical
care," he stated.
"To the best of our knowledge,
previously no one has approached
the problem in an organized fash
ion from the standpoint of teach
ing the people what they can do
for themselves," said Holman.
"And this holds true for lung dis
ease, heart disease, phobias and
so on."

"This is an additional benefit

"To the best of our knowledge,

the problem in an organized fash
ion from the standpoint of teach
ing the people what they can do
for themselves," said Holman.
"And this holds true for lung dis
ease, heart disease, phobias and
so on."
