## Hawaiian feast served first for champion netters Women seek fifth straight national title 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Last season, the Stanford wom
en's tennis team said aloha to its
opponents early and often as they
went through the year unde
feated.
Today, the four-time defending
national champions will say aloha
to the Hawaii Rainbow Wahines
as they kick off the 1990 campaign
seeking yet another NCAA crown.
Though they have yet to com
pete in a dual match, the Cardinal
women are all through what some
members of the team consider the
most difficult part ot the year —
the challenge matches that deter
mine the lineup.
To no one's surprise, NCAA
singles champion Sandra Birch
will take over the No. 1 singles
spot vacated by Tami Whitlinger,
who is now on the pro tour. Birch
has risen in the lineup in each of
her seasons here. As a freshman
she played No. 4, last year she
played No. 2 and now she takes
over the top spot.
Stanford's opponents have more
to fear than Birch, however. "We
have a very, very tough lineup,"
Coach Frank Brennan said. "It's
the best lineup we've ever had.
"I've never had such a tough
time setting one through five and
I've never had such a tough time
picking a number six," he added,
alluding to the depth of talent of
this year's squad.
While the loss of a Tami Whit
linger would be trouble for most
teams, Stanford is fortunate to
still have Tami's twin sister Teri.
She will move to No. 4 this season
from No. 5.
The second spot belongs to
heralded freshman Meredith
McGrath. Currently ranked in the
top 100 on the women's computer,
McGrath should be a crowd
pleaser with her accomplished
serve-and-volley game.

Right behind her, sophomore
Debbie Graham will put her per
fect record in dual-match play on
the line. Last season, she was un
defeated in team competition.
Senior captain Lisa Green is
most certainly ttte nation's best
No. 5 player. A three-time NCAA
singles semifinalist, Green's posi
tion in the lineup shows just how
stacked the Cardinal is.
A three-way battle for the No.
6 spot ended with Heather Wil
lens, another top freshman, fen
ding off challenges from Kylie
Johnson and Mario Carruth.
Johnson held the sixth position
throughout all of last season.
Rrennan likes to use the early
season matches to get the team
prepared for the long road ahead.
"We are fortunate again to have
a schedule that allows us to ease
into it,"he said. He quickly added,
though, that it is "probably our
toughest opening schedule."
The Cardinal will be ready of
course, in singles and doubles.
Topping the doubles list is the
team of McGrath and Whitlinger.

'I've never had
such a tough time
setting one
through five and
I've never had
such a tough time
picking a number
six.'
— Frank Brennan

The pair captured the Riviera Ail-
American Championship this fall.
Next up is the Birch-Graham
duo. They made it to the NCAA
semifinals last season and are an
illustration that Stanford's depth
extends into the doubles arena as
well.
No. 3 doubles will be played by
Johnson and Willens. Brennan
noted that his fourth team, Green
and Carruth will also see a lot of
action.
