# Amazing recruits anchor Gould's powerful squad

### Greg Gottesman Editorial staff 
For most college tennis teams,
losing two top singles players to
the professional circuit would be
a sign of impending doom. Then
again, Stanford is not an ordinary
college tennis team.
In fact, according to Stanford
Coach Dick Gould, this team looks
better than last year's NCAA
Championship team, even with
the loss of Jeff Tarango, last
year's No. 1 player, and Martin
Blackman, whio played in the No.
2 and No. 3 slots.
"On paper, we are definitely a
better team this year," Gould said.
"But last year's team improved
as much as any team I've ever
had. This team will have to im
prove also."
After today, the University of
Hawaii may take exception to
Gould's claim that his team "will
have to improve."
With the addition of the No.
4-ranked junior in the world,
freshman Jonathan Stark, the No.
5-ranked junior in the world,
freshman Jared Palmer, and
Northern California's No. 1 men's
player, freshman Alexis Hombrec
her, the Cardinal starts right
where it left off last year — as
the No. 1 team in the country.
Stanford actually received all the
first place votes in the preseason
1990 Volvo Tennis Collegiate
Rankings.
Stanford also will return most
of its superstars from 1989, in

eluding senior Jeff Cathrall and
sophomore Alex O'Brien. Cathrall,
who spent fall quarter touring on
the Associated Tennis Profes
sional circuit, will fight with
much-improved O'Brien, Palmer
and Stark for the top spot on the
team.
Right now, however, Gould and
his team see today's 1:30 p.m.
match against Hawaii as an ex
cellent chance for dual meet ex
perience.
The tentative lineup for the
match will have Stark playing

first singles, Cathrall second,
O'Brien third, junior Glenn
Solomon fourth, Hombrecher
fifth and sophomore Jason Yee
sixth.
Solomon was an integral part
of last year's championship team,
posting an 18-7 record while com
peting in the three through five
spots.

Palmer, who is recovering from
knee surgery, will not play today.
In the doubles, Gould has made
a partial list but may change
teams, depending on the outcome
of the singles. Presently, Stark
and senior Eric Peus will play in
the top spot. Cathrall and O'Brien
are slated for second doubles,
while Hombrecher and junior Dan
Turbow will compete in the third
slot.
Although the Rainbows should
not pose any major problems for

the Cardinal, Gould still encour
ages students to come to Stanford
Tenn's Stadium and watch his
team's season opener.
"You get a chance to see two
freshmen who have never played
for us before," Gould said. "You
get to see the men and women
play at the same time, vhich only
happens a few times a year.
There's no admission charge with
Stanford ID. Besides, this is going
to be a really exciting team to
watch."
