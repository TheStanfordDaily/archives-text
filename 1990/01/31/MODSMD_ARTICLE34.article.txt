For most college tennis teams,
losing two top singles players to
the professional circuit would be
a sign of impending doom. Then
again, Stanford is not an ordinary
college tennis team.
In fact, according to Stanford
Coach Dick Gould, this team looks
better than last year's NCAA
Championship team, even with
the loss of Jeff Tarango, last
year's No. 1 player, and Martin
Blackman, whio played in the No.
2 and No. 3 slots.
"On paper, we are definitely a
better team this year," Gould said.
"But last year's team improved
as much as any team I've ever
had. This team will have to im
prove also."
After today, the University of
Hawaii may take exception to
Gould's claim that his team "will
have to improve."
With the addition of the No.
4-ranked junior in the world,
freshman Jonathan Stark, the No.
5-ranked junior in the world,
freshman Jared Palmer, and
Northern California's No. 1 men's
player, freshman Alexis Hombrec
her, the Cardinal starts right
where it left off last year — as
the No. 1 team in the country.
Stanford actually received all the
first place votes in the preseason
1990 Volvo Tennis Collegiate
Rankings.
Stanford also will return most
of its superstars from 1989, in

eluding senior Jeff Cathrall and
sophomore Alex O'Brien. Cathrall,
who spent fall quarter touring on
the Associated Tennis Profes
sional circuit, will fight with
much-improved O'Brien, Palmer
and Stark for the top spot on the
team.
Right now, however, Gould and
his team see today's 1:30 p.m.
match against Hawaii as an ex
cellent chance for dual meet ex
perience.
The tentative lineup for the
match will have Stark playing
