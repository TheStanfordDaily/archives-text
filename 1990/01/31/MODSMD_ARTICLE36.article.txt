Ladies and gentlemen, readers of all
ages, let's play our own version of
Jeopardy — the TV game show.
Announcer: The category is Cardinal
Sports. The $200 answer is: The 1984
Stanford women's team played anyway.
Yes, Contestant Number One, what is
the correct question?
Contestant: What if they held a bas
ketball game and nobody came?
Announcer: Correct! Select again.
Contestant: Cardinal Sports for $400.
Announcer: They average 93 points per
game and they're ranked No. 2 in the
country
Contestant Number One?
Contestant: Who is the 1990 Stanford
women's basketball team?
Announcer: Correct! The Final
Jeopardy question will also be in the
category of Cardinal Sports.
(Columnist: I know it doesn't work
this way But, it's my column and I can
do basically whatever I want.)
Announcer: The Final Jeopardy answer
is. The site of the 1990 NCAA Women's
Basketball Tournament West Regional.
Annoying music plays in the back
ground for about 30 seconds.
Announcer: Contestant Number One.
What is your question?
Contestant: What is Maples Pavilion?
Announcer: That's right . . .

We interrupt this simulation to
bring you some important infor
mation. GET EXCITED!!!
For the 2,700 fans that come out to
see the Cardinal at each home game,
none of this is news. For the rest of you,
I offer the following public service an
nouncement:
Stanford University has a good chance
to win its first basketball title since 1942
when the men's team brought home the
brass ring. These women are pretty un
believable.
Defending national champion Tennes
see visits Maples only to get pasted 85-71.
Seventh-ranked Washington comes to
town and loses by 40. That's a four fol
lowed by a zero. Top 10 teams don't lose
by 40.
Long Beach State drops by for an
ESPN tilt. They are ranked No. 6. Stan
ford buries them by halftime.

I realize that Louisiana Tech routinely
mashes its opponents and is no doubt an
excellent team. At this point, though, it's
really hard to imagine there's a better
team in this country than the Cardinal.
Consider that the national media seem
to think the Cardinal is little more than
Ail-American Jennifer Azzi, et al. Not to
take anything away from Azzi, who is
probably the best all-around player in
college hoops, but she is currently the
team's third leading scorer.
As a matter of fact, she leads Stanford
in only one statistical category — free
throw percentage. That fact speaks
volumes of the balance of the team. Five
players average between 13.4 and 16.3
points per game with Trisha Stevens top
ping the list.
Of the Cardinal's top six scorers, five
are shooting over 50 percent from the
field. The team is third in the nation in
shooting accuracy (.513) and fourth best
from the charity stripe (.770).
Statistics, as is often the case, fail to
tell the story adequately. The greatness
of the team cannot be described with
mere numbers.
You can't really see how cohesive and
committed the Cardinal are without
watching them practice and talking to
them. Only then do you see the story
behind the numbers.
No Stanford players are among the

At this point, though, it's
really hard to imagine

this country than the Car
dinal.

nation's individual scoring leaders — and
none of them care in the slightest. Every
player from Azzi to Angela Taylor, who
has played only 37 minutes this season,
realizes the importance of every other
player.
If there's someone who is unhappy
about a lack of playing time, they cer
tainly are not vocal about it. That isn't
surprising considering how supportive
the starters are of the reserves. As the
season has developed, the closeness of
the team has too.
The Cardinal is composed of 11 women
with a strong desire to win a national
title this season. It is not, as many think,
because it has to be this year or never.
Despite the impending graduation of Az
zi, Katy Steding and Stacy Parson, Stan
ford should contend for a championship
often in the future.
Instead, there are two reasons why
they want to win it all this year, and

this may be the only area where the team
is divided. The seniors, obviously, want
it now because there is no next year. The
rest of the team wants to win it for the
seniors.
Of course, they want it for themselves,
as well. But it goes deeper than that.
When Azzi, Steding arid Parson were
freshman, Stanford had won 27 games
the previous three seasons combined.
In 1987-88 and 1988-89 the Cardinal
won 27 and 28 games respectively. To
say the seniors have contributed to build
ing the women's basketball program at
Stanford is like saying Babe Ruth was
an all right power hitter — it understates
the case more than a little.
Fortunately, for those of you who have
not seen these women in action, you still
have ample opportunity. There are five
more regular season home games and
three postseason games slated for Maples
Pavilion.
Get yourself out of Jeopardy as soon
as possible ...

admission made by Stanford students in

Ail-American Jennifer Azzi, et al. Not to
take anything away from Azzi, who is
probably the best all-around player in
college hoops, but she is currently the
team's third leading scorer.
As a matter of fact, she leads Stanford
in only one statistical category — free
throw percentage. That fact speaks
volumes of the balance of the team. Five
players average between 13.4 and 16.3
points per game with Trisha Stevens top
ping the list.
Of the Cardinal's top six scorers, five
are shooting over 50 percent from the
field. The team is third in the nation in
shooting accuracy (.513) and fourth best
from the charity stripe (.770).
Statistics, as is often the case, fail to
tell the story adequately. The greatness
of the team cannot be described with
mere numbers.
You can't really see how cohesive and
committed the Cardinal are without
watching them practice and talking to
them. Only then do you see the story
behind the numbers.
No Stanford players are among the

nation's individual scoring leaders — and
none of them care in the slightest. Every
player from Azzi to Angela Taylor, who
has played only 37 minutes this season,
realizes the importance of every other
player.
If there's someone who is unhappy
about a lack of playing time, they cer
tainly are not vocal about it. That isn't
surprising considering how supportive
the starters are of the reserves. As the
season has developed, the closeness of
the team has too.
The Cardinal is composed of 11 women
with a strong desire to win a national
title this season. It is not, as many think,
because it has to be this year or never.
Despite the impending graduation of Az
zi, Katy Steding and Stacy Parson, Stan
ford should contend for a championship
often in the future.
Instead, there are two reasons why
they want to win it all this year, and

this may be the only area where the team
is divided. The seniors, obviously, want
it now because there is no next year. The
rest of the team wants to win it for the
seniors.
Of course, they want it for themselves,
as well. But it goes deeper than that.
When Azzi, Steding arid Parson were
freshman, Stanford had won 27 games
the previous three seasons combined.
In 1987-88 and 1988-89 the Cardinal
won 27 and 28 games respectively. To
say the seniors have contributed to build
ing the women's basketball program at
Stanford is like saying Babe Ruth was
an all right power hitter — it understates
the case more than a little.
Fortunately, for those of you who have
not seen these women in action, you still
have ample opportunity. There are five
more regular season home games and
three postseason games slated for Maples
Pavilion.

Ladies and gentlemen, readers of all
ages, let's play our own version of
Jeopardy — the TV game show.
Announcer: The category is Cardinal
Sports. The $200 answer is: The 1984
Stanford women's team played anyway.
Yes, Contestant Number One, what is
the correct question?
Contestant: What if they held a bas
ketball game and nobody came?
Announcer: Correct! Select again.
Contestant: Cardinal Sports for $400.
Announcer: They average 93 points per
game and they're ranked No. 2 in the
country
Contestant Number One?
Contestant: Who is the 1990 Stanford
women's basketball team?
Announcer: Correct! The Final
Jeopardy question will also be in the
category of Cardinal Sports.
(Columnist: I know it doesn't work
this way But, it's my column and I can
do basically whatever I want.)
Announcer: The Final Jeopardy answer
is. The site of the 1990 NCAA Women's
Basketball Tournament West Regional.
Annoying music plays in the back
ground for about 30 seconds.
Announcer: Contestant Number One.
What is your question?
Contestant: What is Maples Pavilion?
Announcer: That's right . . .

We interrupt this simulation to
bring you some important infor
mation. GET EXCITED!!!
For the 2,700 fans that come out to
see the Cardinal at each home game,
none of this is news. For the rest of you,
I offer the following public service an
nouncement:
Stanford University has a good chance
to win its first basketball title since 1942
when the men's team brought home the
brass ring. These women are pretty un
believable.
Defending national champion Tennes
see visits Maples only to get pasted 85-71.
Seventh-ranked Washington comes to
town and loses by 40. That's a four fol
lowed by a zero. Top 10 teams don't lose
by 40.
Long Beach State drops by for an
ESPN tilt. They are ranked No. 6. Stan
ford buries them by halftime.

I realize that Louisiana Tech routinely
mashes its opponents and is no doubt an
excellent team. At this point, though, it's
really hard to imagine there's a better
team in this country than the Cardinal.
