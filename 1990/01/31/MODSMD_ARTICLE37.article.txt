# Cardinal-Dons baseball bout rained out
## 
### 
The Stanford-USF baseball game scheduled for
yesterday afternoon was postponed until today at
2 p.m. due to expected rain.
The Cardinal, 2-0 after a season-opening weekend
sweep of Santa Clara, will host the Dons this af
ternoon at Sunken Diamond if the rains do not
return.
Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess is expected to
send several different pitchers to the mound against
the Dons, who will be playing their first game of
1990.
The Dons return six starters from last year's
14-30 team, but only outfielder Arnie Sambel hit
over .300 in 1989. Junior college transfer Jon French
should add some offensive punch as well. French
hit .370 at Modesto JC last year, leading Coach Bo
Aiello's Pirates.
Although Stanford has traditionally thrashed on
the Dons in midseason tuneups, USF managed a
split last season in the Bayshore series. Stanford
bombed the Dons 12-4 at Sunken Diamond on Feb.
28, but USF knocked off the Cardinal 6-4 on April
11, leaving Stanford's record at a paltry 17-22.
USF Coach Ken Bowman didn't appear very op
timistic at a Bay Area media conference, saying, "I
don't think we match up with most teams in this
league.. . .We have very limited resources. . . .We've
got six senior starters, but after that, we don't have
much depth."
Stanford, meanwhile, has hit the 1990 season in
full stride, adding a much-improved offensive attack
to a major league-quality pitching rotation.
Speedy center fielder Jeff Hammonds, a flashy
freshman from Plainfield, N.J., has ignited the top
of the lineup. In the weekend series, Hammonds
laced four hits, with a double, triple, three runs,
two RBI and a stolen base.
Sophomore shortstop Roger Burnett tagged three
hits against Santa Clara, including a home run
Sunday, Stanford's first of the year.
After challenging the Dons, Stanford will host a
three-game series with Cal-State Fullerton starting
Friday.
Stanford will visit USF April 24 for a mid-week
game in between weekend engagements at Arizona
and Arizona State.
