# Branner blitzes Biz
## 
### Rob Johnstone Staff writer 
Take your regulation 90ccer
field. Cut ten yards off the
length, leave the width the
same and add a pair of rickety
goalposts. You now have your
regulation intramural soccer
field.

But, wait — there's a catch.
Cut the number of players
from the regular 11 per team
to only seven a side. Now you're
ready for the widespread, fast
paced action of intramural soc
cer.
Undergraduate-graduate in
tramural matches pit the years
of intramural experience of the
graduate students against the
resilience of the youthful un
dergrads. In a coed soccer game
Saturday afternoon, it was
youth over experience as Bran
ner trounced the Biz school, 10-
0.
Branner was in control of the
game from the opening kickoff,
jumping out to a 6-0 halftime
lead and never looking back.
Branner's ball control proved
too much for the Biz school, as
Branner was seemingly able to
score at will.
In a B-league game Saturday
afternoon, it was the Toyon
Toads totally dominating F.C.
Med, winning by a score of 4-0.

Chris Regan opened the scoring
fifteen minutes into the first
half, putting Toyon up 1-0.
Toyon also got goals from Jus
tin Murphy, Rex Jameson and
Rick Marshall.
In women's basketball action
Sunday night, it was Keir
Smith's 12 points that led
Toyon to a 24-12 win over Biz
IA. Smith had 10 of her points
in the first half, as Toyon
opened up a 16-8 lead. Raelene
Walker added 10 points of her
own, as she and Smith com
bined for 22 of Toyon's 24
points.
Toyon held the Biz team to
one field goal in the second
half.
The intramural darts and
arm wrestling tournaments
were also held last week, made
interesting by some interesting
personalities competing in the
darts tournament.
"Put the two Biz school
teams in different halves of the
tournament, so you'll know
who will be in the final," said
one Biz school competitor. Both
Biz school teams were elimi
nated in the first round.
The two teams that did com
pete in the final were two-time
defending champions Synergy
and upstart Sigma Chi 2. In
the end, it was the underdog
Sigma Chi team beating Syn
ergy in three games.
The arm wrestling tourna
ment was won by the Arroyo-
Soto combination team, edging
Biz 2 by a score of 57-56.
