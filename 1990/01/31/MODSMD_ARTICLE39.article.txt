## Rebels runnin' from hotel bills 
### 
LAS VEGAS (AP) - The
NCAA will be asked to clarify
an usue Thursday that is nag
ging the UNLV basketball team
and could affect college coaches
and athletic directors across the
country.
The question: To what degree
are universities responsible for
seeing that bills of student ath
letes are paid?
Nine UNLV players have been
suspended for one game for
failing to pay incidental charges
at hotels where the team stayed
on the road last season. Charges
range from $7.51 for one athlete
to less than $100 in combined
bills for another. Most charges
total less than $50 per student,
university officials say.
The Runnin' Rebels, under
the NCAA microscope since a
celebrated battle with Coach
Jerry Tarkanian 13 years ago,
thought it was on solid ground.
Not so, according to the NCAA.
If the latest NCAA edict holds,
many coaches could be facing
the same question.
"To our knowledge, this is the
first time the NCAA has held
institutions accountable for
such charges by student ath
letes," said UNLV athletic di
rector Brad Rothermel.
"The institutions may have
the responsibility of making
sure the student athletes pay
their own bills," Janet Justus,
head of the eligiblity department
of the NCAA, said in a telephone
interview Tuesday.
Justus ruled last week that
the nine players, including three
starters, must sit out one game

each for failing to pay the inci
dental charges.
UNLV routinely notifies
hotels where the players stay
that the university will be re
sponsible only for the room cost
and team meals.
"We've always told the hotels
that no incidental charges could
be or would be paid by the in
stitution," Rothermel said. "We
told the hotels not to permit
these kinds of charges to occur."
Rothermel said hotels were in
structed to shut off the phones
of the players so they could not
make long distance calls. De
spite the written notices, some
athletes were able to make calls
and charge them to their room.
Others consumed snacks in
mini-bars found in many hotel
rooms.
The athletes were billed for
those charges, and the bills were
given to the athletes, but never
paid until Friday, Rothermel
said. The bills were paid by the
athletes.
Justus said the athletes
"received a benefit they would
not have received if they were
not an athlete, took advantage
of it, and didn't deal with it
properly."
She said the UNLV situation
was different "because so many
student athletes were involved."
Justus said she was not aware
of a specific case where an ath
lete was cited for placing long
distance calls from a hotel while
on a road trip. But she said
there was at least one case
where an athlete was cited for
making unauthorized long dis

tance calls.
The incidental charges were
discovered in a UNLV audit and
reported to the NCAA by the
university.
Starters Greg Anthony and
David Butler sat out Thursday's
69-67 victory over Santa Bar
bara and starter Stacey Augmon
and Chris Jeter were suspended
from Sunday's game at LSU,
which the Rebels lost 107-105.
Travis Bice and Moses Scurry
are scheduled to sit out Thurs
day's game against Utah State
with James Jones and Barry
Young missing Saturday's
televised meeting with North
Carolina State.
That could change if UNLV
is successful in appealing the
penalties at an NCAA legislative
meeting Thursday morning.
The university will be asking
the college sports governing
agency a basic question: Where
does a university's responsibility
toward its student-athletes
begin and end?
"If we are responsible for the
players' hotel bills, even after
we have a contract stating that
no long distance or incidental
charges are allowed, then are
we responsible for their power
and water bills, too?" Rothermel
asked.
"If a student on scholarship
is in arrears in his apartment
rent, is that the responsibility
of the institution to see that the
bill is paid? If the student
charges gasoline, is that now the
responsibility of the institution
to guarantee that the bill will
be paid?
