# Trudeau offers hope for the future
## Former Canadian prime minister accepts international law prize 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer 
"Things fall apart; the center cannot
hold/Mere anarchy is loosed upon the
world,/The blood-dimmed tide is loosed,
and everywhere/The ceremony of in
nocence is drowned. ..."
Pierre Trudeau, former prime minis
ter of Canada, conjured up the apocalyp
tic vision of W.B. Yeats in a powerful,
allusion-packed address delivered yes
terday to a large audience in Kresge
Auditorium. Trudeau was at Stanford
to accept the Jackson H. Ralston prize
in international law.
Citing the pessimistic prophesies
which often accompany the end of a
millenium, Trudeau sketched with both
humor and concern his own vision of
disaster and deliverance for the world.
"If ideas are the stuff of which history
is made, the governments of the Western
world seem unprepared to shape their
own destinies," Trudeau said.
Trudeau said that foreign investments
used to fund the U.S. deficit should go
to needy Latin American countries. At

the same time, he said, the economic
summits of the "Magnificent Seven" —
the United States, Japan, West Ger
many and other European trade
partners — have perpetuated a system
of disparate wealth and poverty between
Western nations and the Third World.
"Without some social contract the
market will simply turn out more of
everything desired for those wielding
some form of power," he said.
According to Trudeau, both the liberal
reforms of Eastern European nations
and the extensive economic deregulation
of the capitalist West represent a move
ment towards the ideal of liberty.
But Trudeau fears that in the
clamour for increased financial freedom,
the democratic ideals of equality and
fraternity are forgotten by nations
seeking financial prosperity: "Even in
the best of circumstances, our so-called
free markets are not always free."
Trudeau also contrasted the com
placency and low participation rates of
U.S. voters with the courage of the dis
enfranchised masses of Eastern Europe
and the students in China's Tiananmen

Square who risked their Uvea and fu
tures for political freedom. Quoting
Yeats again, he said, "The best lack all
conviction, while the worst are full of
passionate intensity."
Trudeau himself is full of passionate
intensity. During his 15 years as prime
minister of Canada, he achieved several
important political changes including
passage of the Official Languages Act
which recognizes both French and Eng
lish as official languages, and the enact
ment of the Canadian Charter of Rights,
a piece of legislation similar to the U.S.
Bill of Rights.
Trudeau said his vision of the world
is not yet apocalyptic. His hope for the
future rests in the commitment of the
world's wealthy and powerful nations
to "return to a more regulated economy
where public interest will have priority
over private property."
Trudeau wants renewed public inter
est to extend beyond the borders of the
Unites States and embrace not only the
developing democracies of Eastern Eu
rope but also the struggling nations of
the Third World.
