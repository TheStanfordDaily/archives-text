# High-priced boutiques may fill spaces in mall
## 
### Chris Roblyer 
The Stanford Shopping Center
is well-known for its wide array
of ritzy stores. With some vacated
spaces opening up in the center,
it is likely to become even ritzier
in the next few months.
Four small stores that have
been located in the mall for more
than a decade say they are being
forced out because of higher rents
and shrinking clientele. Thinker
Toys and Games and Things have
already closed up shop. In Mate
rial, a fabric store, and the Eat
Rite Nutrition Center are sched
uled to do the same within the
next few weeks.
Sheridan Linens of Australia
will be leasing the space currently
occupied by In Material. As for
the businesses that will replace
the other three stores, "there are
currently many prospects for
replacements, but no new leases
have been negotiated," according
to Rosemary McAndrews, director
of the mall.
Even though McAndrews has no
final plans for the spaces, she says
she is "looking for compatible
stores that provide the proper mix
for our tenants."
This essentially means that
more high-priced boutiques are
likely to replace less prestigious
stores that do not cater to the
well-off Stanford-Palo Alto com
munity, say the owners of the
stores that are leaving the center.

Declining sales are the reason
behind the closing of the Eat Rite
Nutrition Center, according to a
store employee.
But a manager of Games and
Things says that although sales
were up and business was
booming, the store was not of
fered a renewal of its lease.
But McAndrews disagrees that
the store was thriving, calling this
too rosy a portrayal. She calls the
refusal to renew the lease "just a
matter of economics."
The circumstances surrounding
the departure of In Material are
also disputed. Diane Toby, owner
of the store, was quoted in the
Palo Alto Weekly as saying, "The
rent went up — three times higher
than what I was paying before."
McAndrews angrily retorted
that these figures were "an out
right falsehood." She says that the
rent on the space went up only
80 percent. Moreover, she says
that "a standard increase" would
have been 180 percent.
But Toby says even a "reduced"
increase of 80 percent would be
too much for her to pay. However,
Toby maintains that the actual
increase is closer to her own fig
ure than the one that McAndrews
provided. "It's a difficult mall for
the independent merchant," says
Toby.
The new tenant will be paying
twice as much as did In Material,
according to McAndrews.
