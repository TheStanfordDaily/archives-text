# Chinese face uncertain future
## Students have tough choice: whether to change visa status

Stanford's community of 400
Chinese nationals must contend
with an uncertain future after
Congress recently failed to over
ride President Bush's veto of a
bill that would have allowed them
to remain in the United States.
Now, the only thing that stands
between many of the students and
a one-way ticket back to China is
Bush's Nov. 30 directive that al
lows students with a certain visa
to remain in the United States.
There are two kinds of visas
issued to students from foreign
countries: the J-l exchange visitor
visa and the F-l student visa.
Spouses of foreign students are
usually issued corresponding J-2
or F-2 dependent visas.
According to Marcia Makino,
foreign student adviser at Bechtel
International Center, a dif
ference between the J-l visa and
the F-l visa is that the J-l requires
a two-year return stav in the stu

dents' home country after they
complete their degrees. Only after
students fulfill this requirement
can they apply for a visa that will
allow them to work freely in the
United States.
The F-l student visa has no
such requirement.
The mtyority of Stanford's Chi
nese students have a J-l visa, re
quiring that they return home.
However, under Bush's directive,
they can change to an F-l visa
until Jan. 1, 1994. A presidential
directive can be rescinded at any
time.
Because the situation in the
People's Republic of China re
mains inhospitable to Chinese stu
dents overseas, many of whom
participated in pro-democracy ac
tivities last spring, most Chinese
students want to avoid returning
to China.
In the last two months, at least
60 of the approximately 400 Chi
nese nationals at Stanford have
attended information sessions at

the I-Center instructing them how
to go about changing their visa
status so that they can take ad
vantage of the directive's provi
sions. Of the 400 Chinese
nationals here, 197 are registered
students.
"My feeling is that since the
override was not successful, I
think now more people will con
sider applying [for a visa status
other than J-l]," Makino said.
"Whether we'll see all of the
students who could potentially
change, change, I don't know. I
think some people were perhaps
waiting or didn't come forth [to
change their visa status] immedi
ately after the Nov. 30 directive
was issued because they thought,
'well, if it becomes law, I'll have
a bit more time.' "
However, she said there has not
been a flood of Chinese students
seeking to change their visa status
from the J-l now that only Bush's
