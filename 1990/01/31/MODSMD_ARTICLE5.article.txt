# Chinese face uncertain future
## Students have tough choice: whether to change visa status

Stanford's community of 400
Chinese nationals must contend
with an uncertain future after
Congress recently failed to over
ride President Bush's veto of a
bill that would have allowed them
to remain in the United States.
Now, the only thing that stands
between many of the students and
a one-way ticket back to China is
Bush's Nov. 30 directive that al
lows students with a certain visa
to remain in the United States.
There are two kinds of visas
issued to students from foreign
countries: the J-l exchange visitor
visa and the F-l student visa.
Spouses of foreign students are
usually issued corresponding J-2
or F-2 dependent visas.
According to Marcia Makino,
foreign student adviser at Bechtel
International Center, a dif
ference between the J-l visa and
the F-l visa is that the J-l requires
a two-year return stav in the stu

dents' home country after they
complete their degrees. Only after
students fulfill this requirement
can they apply for a visa that will
allow them to work freely in the
United States.
The F-l student visa has no
such requirement.
The mtyority of Stanford's Chi
nese students have a J-l visa, re
quiring that they return home.
However, under Bush's directive,
they can change to an F-l visa
until Jan. 1, 1994. A presidential
directive can be rescinded at any
time.
Because the situation in the
People's Republic of China re
mains inhospitable to Chinese stu
dents overseas, many of whom
participated in pro-democracy ac
tivities last spring, most Chinese
students want to avoid returning
to China.
In the last two months, at least
60 of the approximately 400 Chi
nese nationals at Stanford have
attended information sessions at

the I-Center instructing them how
to go about changing their visa
status so that they can take ad
vantage of the directive's provi
sions. Of the 400 Chinese
nationals here, 197 are registered
students.
"My feeling is that since the
override was not successful, I
think now more people will con
sider applying [for a visa status
other than J-l]," Makino said.
"Whether we'll see all of the
students who could potentially
change, change, I don't know. I
think some people were perhaps
waiting or didn't come forth [to
change their visa status] immedi
ately after the Nov. 30 directive
was issued because they thought,
'well, if it becomes law, I'll have
a bit more time.' "
However, she said there has not
been a flood of Chinese students
seeking to change their visa status
from the J-l now that only Bush's
directive stands in the way of
their having to return to China
in the future.
Despite the relative attractive
ness of an F-l visa, a student's
decision to change visa status is
not an easy one. Even if the stu
dent bypasses the obstacles of a
visa switch, the F-l visa has many
restrictions.
According to the requirements
of the Immigration and Natural
ization Service, after Chinese stu
dents obtain their F-l student
visas, they cannot work off
campus until they have held the
F-l visa for nine months. This
may concern students who want
to seek off-campus employment
this summer.
For example, a Chinese gradu
ate student at Stanford, who
wants to remain anonymous, has
already secured employment with
a San Francisco firm for the sum
mer. However, if she were to apply
now to change from a J-l to an
F-l visa, she would not be able
to work there because in June
she would not have held the F-l
status for the requisite nine
months.
With an F-l visa, she would not
have to return to China if the
presidential directive were sud
denly rescinded. However, she
would have to forego the intern

ship and hope that she could find
a suitable on-campus job for the
summer.
Noting how much the job she
found means to her, she said, "I
won't even think of changing to
the F-l until the end of the sum
mer."
Another significant drawback
to the F-l visa is that it does not
allow F-l spouses, F-2s, to hold a
job.
Although the presidential direc
tive makes a special provision for
spouses of Chinese students by
allowing them to obtain a job and
keep it until June 5, 1990, this
privilege can be extended beyond
June 5 only with approval of the
Attorney General.
On the other hand, if Chinese
students still hold a J-l Exchange
Visitor visa, their J-2 spouses
would have the option of working
as long as their income was not
used to support their J-l spouse.
Thus, married students, who
make up the mÂ£\jority of regis
tered Chinese students at Stan
ford, considering a change from
J-l to F-l student status would
have to consider that from this
summer on until completing their
degrees, their income might be
the sole source of support for their
family.
During the year, that income
would consist only of a graduate
student stipend and earnings from
a limited part-time job.
Chinese graduate students plan-

Now more people
will consider applying
for a visa status other
than J-1.

ning to get their degrees this year
have to worry about their long
term futures. They have to try to
find a job soon so that they can
obtain "practical training" for a
maximum of a year for F-l stu
dents and a maximum of a year
and a half for J-1 students.
After that, to avoid returning
to China, they need to find a se
cure job in order to receive a work
ing visa, the H-l.
If they cannot obtain employ
ment at that time, they will have
to return home. However, even if
they do find a job, the H-l visa
has a five-year maximum and can
only be renewed with a valid pass
port from the Chinese govern
ment, a potential obstacle for some
students.
According to The New York
Times, Rush was asked at a press
conference whether his commit
ment that no Chinese students
would >e sent back to China
against their will would "run ab
solutely" or run "only until such
time n [the president felt] China
has anged in some way that
me' ' his approval."
1 resident Rush responded,
"Against (their) will is the con
trolling statement."
