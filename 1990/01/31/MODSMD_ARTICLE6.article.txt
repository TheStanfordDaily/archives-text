# Hughes sees Greek expansion
## Adviser envisions 60 to 70 percent membership 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Editorial staff 
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Mi
chael Hughes offered his vision
of fraternities and sororities at
Stanford — including a mem
bership rate of 60 to 70 percent
of the student body and more
emphasis on community service
— last night in an interview on
KZSU.
Hughes, who called himself a
"huge proponent and rah-rah
flag-waver" for Greek life, an
swered questions about his po
sition on open fraternity parties,
the image of Greeks on campus,
investigations and social suspen
sions of fraternities and soror
ities and the length of Rush.
Up front, Hughes said he is
not trying to close fraternity
parties — unless they are too
focused on alcohol.
However, he wants fraterni-

ties to host
fewer big par
ties and to in
teract with each
other and
campus groups
through smal
ler, "more man
ageable" par
ties.
Along these

lines, Hughes plans to initiate
a "Greek Week" of social activ
ities and philanthropy for the
student body.
The Greek community should
also make more positive contri
butions to the community at
large, "like the ethnic commu
nities" do, said Hughes. He cited
KA Mud Volleyball, sponsored
by Kappa Alpha fraternity, as
an already-existing example.
Hughes further envisions fra
ternities and sororities putting
on campus-wide educational

programs on issues like ac
quaintance rape, alcohol, gender
relations and multiculturalism.
With this approach, Greek life
will hopefully appeal to more
and more people — both stu
dents who will join the ranks
and administrators who cur
rently buy into negative "myths"
about letter organizations,
Hughes said.
Currently, 22 percent of Stan
ford undergraduates belong to
fraternities or sororities.
Concerning the investigations
and social suspensions of the
Phi Delta Theta and Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternities and
the Pi Beta Phi sorority, Hughes
said these organizations should
accept some of the responsibility
for incidents that occurred at
their parties. According to Cal
ifornia laws, party hosts can be
held responsible for the actions
of their guests, he said.
