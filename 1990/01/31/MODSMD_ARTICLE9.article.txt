# Unified language dept. proposed
## 
### David Bianco 
French and Italian Department
Chair Jean-Marie Apostolides
plans to present a proposal next
month to unify all European lan
guage departments under an
umbrella organization.
His proposal follows on the
heels of a similar suggestion by
Professor Emeritus of Romanic
Languages Ronald Hilton to
create a "Division of Language
Studies" encompassing all lan
guage departments.
Apostolides envisions the four
independent language depart
ments — French and Italian, Ger
man Studies, Slavic Languages
and Literature, and Spanish and
Portugese — "topped by an ad
ministrative and intellectual enti
ty" which he would like to call
European studies.
Unlike Hilton's proposal, Apos
tolides' proposal excludes Asian
Languages, focusing instead on a
Europe-wide curriculum of lan
guage, literature and culture.
In an interview yesterday, Apos
tolides said he would like to see
the entire process of implementing
a unified European studies cur
riculum take place in "less than
two years."
A European studies entity, he

said, "would be attractive to many
students and would give more
strength to the [School of] Hu
manities and Sciences."
The entity could encourage
American students to take more
than one foreign language, which
is the custom in Europe and Asia,
Apostolides said.
Hilton's proposal, published in
the Jan. 3 Campus Report, cites
the increasing importance of in
ternational awareness and the
fragmentation of Stanford
departments as prime reasons for
a Division of Language Studies to
encompass Stanford's five lan
guage departments.
Hilton said in an interview
Monday that the earthquake
damaged Language Corner should
be rebuilt in the fashion of His
tory Corner, adding enough space
for all the language departments
and classes to be in one location.
He further suggested that the
division's chair rotate among the
various language groups, to pla
cate the "nationalistic" objections
these groups may have if a per
manent chair is appointed.
Apostolides agreed with Hil
ton's idea of a rotating chair, say
ing it was necessary to "prevent
tyranny in the department."

So far, Hilton said, "a lot of
people have expressed their ap
proval" of his proposal. "There
has been no negative reaction."
Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Theodore An*
dersson, whose support is crucial
to either proposal's success, said
he was "entirely open to the idea"
of merging the language depart
ments. "We have in our univer
sities in this country a curious
tradition of national depart
ments," he said.
To move toward unity, An
dersson suggested that the de
partment chairs "put their heads
together" and investigate the pos
sibilities.
Prof. Michael Predmore,
Spanish and Portuguese Depart
ment chair, said the merger pro
posal "has some merit" but he
stopped short of endorsing a
unified language division.
He said cooperation among the
various language departments was
important, but already in effect.
He cited the programs in Modern
Thought and Literature and Com
parative Literature as examples
of cooperation, and encouraged
strengthening these programs,
calling them "innovative and
imaginative."
