# Grad students berate new phones
## Officials fail to reach out and touch Escondido residents 
### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
A meeting last night between Univer
sity Communication Services officials
and Escondido Village residents broke
into a shouting match as the officials
tried to defend upcoming changes in
campus phone service.
All phones in campus residences will
be converted to the University phone
system this summer.
Though the officials expected only 20
to 30 residents to attend, more than 80
graduate students and their spouses

packed the Escondido Village Center.
The meeting began with Maureen
Trimm, assistant director of Communi
cation Services, presenting the objec
tives of the new system. Describing how
this system fits into Stanford's long
range goal of creating "a full commu
nication arena" of computer and video
networks, Trimm had hardly begun
speaking when the standing room only
crowd interrupted her with shouted
questions.
Under the new system, the University
will decide what long-distance carrier
the residents can use, a man from the

audience pointed out.
"Why do we have to subject ourselves
to your choosing?" he demanded.
One woman asked if the system's im
plementation is definite.
"We've invested a lot of capital in the
project, and it's going to be carried out,"
said William Yundt, director of network
ing and one of four Communication
Services officials present.
The system will provide an infrastruc
ture for future data and video networks,
officials told the crowd. Similar systems
are operating at other mtgor uni
versities with success, they said.
"That's no reason to put up
with it!" shouted a member of the
audience. Another yelled, "Does
that mean it's right? Does that
make it fair?"
"I don't know how you people
behave at home," Yundt scolded,

adding that interruptions would
only hinder the discussion.
The residents then began
raising their hands and waited to
be called on before speaking.
One woman said she had two
telephone lines and wondered if
this arrangement would still be
possible under the new system.
The officials' reply was that it
would not be technically feasible.
Another called out concerns
about the cost. "So far it looks

like rates are going to go up 15
to 20 percent for all of us."
As Trimm tried to assure the
audience that she believes rates
under the new system will most
likely decrease in the future, the
crowd buzzed with uneasiness.
"We don't trust you," a woman
from the audience declared. "Can
you show me any other time when
the University has given us a good
price on anything?"
