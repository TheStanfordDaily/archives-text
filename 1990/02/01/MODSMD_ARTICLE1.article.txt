A meeting last night between Univer
sity Communication Services officials
and Escondido Village residents broke
into a shouting match as the officials
tried to defend upcoming changes in
campus phone service.

graduate students and their spouses

packed the Escondido Village Center.
The meeting began with Maureen
Trimm, assistant director of Communi
cation Services, presenting the objec

networks, Trimm had hardly begun
speaking when the standing room only
crowd interrupted her with shouted
questions.
Under the new system, the University
will decide what long-distance carrier
the residents can use, a man from the

audience pointed out.
"Why do we have to subject ourselves
to your choosing?" he demanded.

project, and it's going to be carried out,"
said William Yundt, director of network

Services officials present.

ture for future data and video networks,
officials told the crowd. Similar systems
