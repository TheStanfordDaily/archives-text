EAST BERLIN (AP) - West
German leaders yesterday praised
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
apparent acceptance of reunifica
tion as a signal that may instill
hope in East Germans fearful of
the uncertainties of reform.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl called
the Kremlin chiefs latest com
ments on German unity "en
couraging," and Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Gor
bachev had "correctly analyzed"
the volatile situation in East Ger
many.
East Germany's official news
agency ADN said that by making
clear his change of mind on the
German question, Gorbachev
"once more confirmed for all the
world his reputation as a
politician of realism."
Support for union with
prosperous West Germany has
surged among East Germans in
recent weeks as the depths of their
political and economic crises have
become clear.
East German Premier Hans
Modrow acknowledged in a speech
to Parliament this week that the
nation was on the verge of eco
nomic collapse, and said mounting
tensions forced him to move up
free elections to March 18.
Anti-Communist sentiment has
swelled among the population of
16 million, sparking mass demon
strations and labor strikes to

protest the distrusted party's con
tinued hold on the reins of power.
Modrow, a reformer who is
more trusted than most of his
fellow Communists, was forced by
the growing hostility toward his
still-dominant party to bring nine
opposition representatives into his
Cabinet.
The pro-democracy forces
joining Modrow were to submit
their proposed ministers by yes
terday, and three of the parties
publicly announced the names of
the representatives they put for
ward.
The Social Democrats, who
were hesitant to enter into a co
alition with the political parties
blamed for East Germany's cur
rent crises, nominated Walter
Romberg, who has not played a
prominent role in the party to
date. The Initiative for Peace and
Human Rights proposed Gerd
Poppe and Democracy Now of
fered Wolfgang Ullmann. Poppe
and Ullmann are negotiators for

their respective groups at the
weekly talks that advise Modrow's
interim government.
In Bonn, Kohl devoted much of
his address at a Cabinet meeting
to the issue of German unity and
the exodus of East Germans that
is inflicting social and economic
strains on both sides of the border.
Government spokesman Hans
Klein, a member of the West Ger
man Cabinet, said Kohl found
Gorbachev's views on reunifica
tion "encouraging."
Gorbachev commented during
talks with Modrow in Moscow on
Tuesday that a single German
state was likely in the future, al
though he cautioned that East
Germans "should not decide this
important issue on the streets."
West German newspapers re
ported Gorbachev's comments
prominently and hailed his appar
ent acceptance of German
reunification as coming to grips
with reality.
"Gorbachev has once again
shown himself to be a politician
of realism who has correctly
analyzed the developments in East
Germany and the will of the
people," Genscher told West Ger
man Radio.
Kohl suggested Gorbachev had
eased the fears of East Germans
by making clear that the Kremlin
would not stand in the way of
reunification.
