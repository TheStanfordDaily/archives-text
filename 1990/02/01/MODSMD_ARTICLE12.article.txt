# President Bush delivers his first State of the Union address

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush, acclaiming the "revolution of '89"
in Eastern Europe, proposed a sharp new
cut in U.S. and Soviet combat troops last
night, saying in his first State of the
Union address "the time is right to move
forward" in Europe.
Bush also announced plans to with
draw all of the nearly 13,000 troops sent
to Panama in an invasion to oust Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega "well before the
end of February."
Democrats and Republicans alike, as
sembled in joint session of Congress to
hear the president, stood in ovation when
Bush said, "One year ago, the people of
Panama lived in fear, under the thumb
of a dictator. Today, democracy is re
stored, Panama is free."
The troop offer was the surprising —

and popular — center
piece of a speech in which
Bush also proposed lofty
goals for American
schools and prodded law
makers to approve his
plans for a capital gains
tax cut and bills dealing
with clean air, child care,
crime, drugs, education
and other issues.

In reaction, House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley embraced the troop reduction plan
but said Democrats would offer a domes
tic agenda of their own.
With ambassadors from across the
world in attendance, Bush said, "We are
in a period of great transition, great hope,
yet great uncertainty...
"The events of the year just ended —

the revolution of '89 — have been a chain
reaction, change so striking that it marks
the beginning of a new era in the world's
affairs.
"Think back," Bush asked Congress
and his national broadcast audience, "to
the world we knew as 1989 began." In
the year since, Communist governments
gave way in Poland, East Germany,
Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
In such locations, Bush said, "the idea
called America is alive."
Hours before he delivered his address,
Bush telephoned Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to advise him of his pro
posal to cut U.S. and Soviet forces in
Central Europe to 195,000 on each side.
In his speech, Bush said:
"We recognize that the Soviet military
threat in Europe is diminishing but we

see little change in Soviet strategic
modernization. ... But the time is right
to move forward on a conventional arms
control agreement to move us to more
appropriate levels of military forces in
Europe."
His troop cutback proposal won imme
diate praise from Democrats, including
Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, who said it fit "the
changing circumstances in Europe and
the fiscal pressures" at home.
"It's time to act together," Bush said
in a speech intended to help set an
election-year agenda for a Democratic
run Congress. Even so, partisanship was
clear when Bush extolled his "no new
taxes" budget plan. Republicans erupted
with applause. Democrats didn't.
Bush was welcomed warmly as he en

tered the packed chamber, where con
gressional aides stood three deep around
the wails and spectators filled even the
aisle stairs in the visitors' galleries. A
cheer went up as Foley, D-Wash., intro
duced the president as "our former col
league."
Barbara Bush stood in the balcony with
hands clasped in front of her during the
2V2-minute welcoming ovation. Nearby
sat Marilyn Quayle and next to her, evan
gelist Billy Graham. In all, there were
30 interruptions for applause.
Foley agreed with much of what Bush
said, but said that on some points, Dem
ocrats disagree. Foley said Bush cannot
become the "education president," if his
budget for fiscal 1991 includes only a 2
percent increase in spending for educa
tion.
