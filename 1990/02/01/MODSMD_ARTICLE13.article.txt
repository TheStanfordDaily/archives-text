# Gorbachev will not resign

### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Mikhail S. Gorbachev
yesterday denied a report he might resign
as head of the Communist Party while
remaining Soviet president, and a leading
newspaper called him too valuable to risk
losing.
Another newspaper, the party daily
Pravda, urged authorities to strengthen the
powers of the presidency to protect Gor
bachev from efforts to oust him.
Correspondents covering Gorbachev's
meeting with Brazilian president-elect Fer
nando Collor de Mello asked about a West
ern television report that he was consid
ering quitting the party leadership.
"All this is groundless," Gorbachev said
in remarks that led the Soviet television
news last night. "It is in someone's interest
to propagate such things."
He added that similar rumors are be

coming common in the Soviet Union, and
"it demonstrates that we are a different
country, a different society. Everything is
discussed, and discussed openly."
Gorbachev has strengthened the
presidency and tried to shift power from
the ruling Communist Party to the elected
government. But it is far from clear
whether the reforms have gone far enough
for him to dare relinquishing the top post
in the party, which has been the source of
power for all previous Soviet leaders.
President Bush telephoned Gorbachev
Wednesday, but White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said there was no "direct"
discussion of the rumors. Fitzwater said
the two leaders talked about arms control.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 111
discounted the TV network report as "just
a rumor."
