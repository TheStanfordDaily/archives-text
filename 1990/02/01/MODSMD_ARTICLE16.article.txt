## Phony progress 
### 
New phone system
offers too little
and costs too much

After Tuesday's assu
"State of the Association"
address, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy said Stanford
developed the new University
phone system because students
wanted it. All things considered,
we shouldn't want it.
The bottom line is that for a
cost of $5 million, it will only pro
vide a couple of features that other
phone services do not — and they
provide some that it cannot.
The best feature of the phone
system is first day hook-up — stu
dents coming back from the sum
mer can plug their phones into
working lines as soon as they enter
their rooms. With Pacific Bell, stu
dents usually have to wait about
three to five days after they arrive
on campus for phone service.
Of course, everybody except
freshmen can get their lines set
up in advance by Pacific Bell if
they know where they will be living
and call ahead. And students who
stay at the same residence for more
than a year, such as graduate stu-
I dents, only need to set up their
line once anyway, 112
The University phone system
will also provide the feature of in
dividual billing, through the use
of individual personal access codes
for long distance calls, to every
roommate in a room. But how
much time and energy does this
save students — five minutes a
month figuring out who owes
what? If a student lives alone, the
answer is nothing. And students
will still have to whip out their
calculators to divvy up other phone
fees.

As for the amount of the bill,
the University's basic flat rate will
be competitive with Pacific Bell.
However, Pacific Bell offers two
other billing options, measured
rate service and Universal Lifeline
Service, which can be substantially
lower in cost than a flat rate.
The University phone system
does not offer such options.
In terms of comparing long dis
tance rates, the results are ambig
uous. The University's charges will
essentially be cheaper in the day
and more expensive at night than
Pacific Bell.
The much-heralded free personal
access codes are basically the same
as calling cards that can also be
obtained for free from other long
distance services. Plus, the access
codes can only be used on phones
in the system, whereas calling
cards can be used anywhere. Not
much advantage here.
A peripheral advantage of the
new phone system is that students
will be able to connect their com
puters to SUNet, the University
computer network, through the
same phone lines. The bubble
bursts again. Students can already
access SUNet with a standard
modem. And for students without
computers, this feature is of no
interest.
Another minor feature of the
system is that students will only
have to dial the last- five digits of
other phone numbers on the sys
tem to make a connection. But this
benefit is countered by the whop
ping 19 digits — 9 4- area code
+ phone number + seven-digit
access code — it takes to make a
call to someone eight miles from
Hoover Tower.
Therefore, the University phone
system does not improve the
already-existing services available
to students. Especially at a cost of
$5 million, the University should
remain out of the phone business.
