ASSU refunds are earned privilege, not inherent right

THE RECENT barrage of com
plaints about ASSU fee refund
ing causes me to remark on the
absurdity of it all. For the past week
and a half, The Daily has included
many statements on the subject.
One Council of Presidents member
thinks that people take their money
back because they "don't realize that
this is a major budget source for these
groups." The Daily staff editorializes
that the refunding process is a "distor
tion of democracy."
The first statement is ridiculous. If
there are any students on campus not

familiar with the fee assessment sys
tem, they are most likely the ones who
remain unaware of the refund system
as well. Those who take the time to
retrieve their money are quite
deliberate and cognizant in doing so.
The second statement is entirely
true, but not in the sense intended in
the editorial. The Daily uses the votes
received by these student groups in the
spring election as evidence in support
of the abolition of fee refunds.
The "distortion of democracy" here
is not, however, in some violation of a
supposed mandate given by the student

body in the spring elections. Instead, it
is in the shaky foundation of this
"mandate." It is in the system which
requires students to vote for any
groups at all in order to reserve their
donations for the groups that they
deem deserving.
Finally, the idea of groups handing
out informational literature to students
in line for their refunds is a blatantly
expedient ploy. It's true that these
groups need to appeal to the student
body for support, but to single out
those students who pose an immediate

threat to their financial welfare is both
self-serving and indecent.
In the end, student groups should
not see themselves as "deprived" by
students who receive refunds. The
simple fact that the University chooses
to include ASSU fees on our bill does
not denote that they are all monies
intended for that use by each student
affected. Instead they should realize
that they are extracurricular organiza
tions who need to earn the donations
that they desire.
