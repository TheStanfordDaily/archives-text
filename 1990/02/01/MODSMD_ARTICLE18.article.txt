# Speaker chosen on merit alone, and is well-known
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the let
ter sent by Ziad Sarkis and James
Turo about the choice of Marian Edel
man as commencement speaker.
Marian Wright Edelman is not un
known. Anyone who is interested and
follows national policy knows that she
is a well-known leader, revered by
many and passionately disliked by
others.
As for being "famous," perhaps her
name is not a household word but "60
Minutes" thought enough of her last
year to do a long personal profile.
I know that the student organizers
who have worked on three of the last
You Can Make A Difference Confer
ences will be thrilled to have her come,
for each year, after thoroughly
researching the fields of study — fam
ily, racism, education — the students
decided to ask her to give a major
address, only to run into scheduling

problems — she is usually booked a
year in advance.
1 can tell you that in the delibera
tions for the conferences, neither the
color of her skin nor her gender were
factors. It was the quality of her work,
her leadership as an advocate for the
children and her inspire that
made the students enthusiastic about
hearing her.
So I hope the students will practice
what they preached in their letter by
keeping an open mind and not have
preconceived notions of her worth just
because she is female and African-
American.
