# Money no reason not to fill up Lake Lagunita
## 
### 
Life on the Farm used to be much
simpler. For instance, if it rained, we
got a lake. If Stanford students, faculty
and staff weathered a stormy winter,
biked around in the mud, and clois-

tered themselves indoors, they were
rewarded in the spring with a lake,
pictured in numerous Stanford bro
chures, referred to in Courses and
Degrees and indicated on every campus
map.
Now it seems that despite adequate
water resources, the University is very
close to depriving the entire Stanford
community of its just desserts.
Every year Laguinita is enjoyed
by swimmers, sailors, windsurfers,
sunbathers and onlookers. Neither a
245-page commissioned report, nor an
impromptu poll by ASSU senators is
necessary to reveal this. If you have
ever been to the lake on a hot, sunny
(i.e. typical spring quarter) day, you
have witnessed it.
Lagunita is as fundamental a recrea
tional resource as Encina Gym, Roble
Field or the tennis courts. It is unfor
tunate that it is only filled for one
quarter in the first place.
I realize that the earthquake and
skyrocketing insurance costs have
forced the University to tighten its
belt. Furthermore, I will admit that a
lake does not play a pivotal role in the
Stanford educational experience.
Nevertheless, to forgo the lake be
cause the ASSU does not want to dip

into its annual reserves or because the
University does not want to spend
what is merely a Galvez Module in the
midst of its Centennial drive is need
less and unfair skimping, especially
since there was no lake last year! (And
what became of the money saved by
not having it?)
If Lagunita is not filled, Spring
Quarter will still be eryoyable. How
ever, maybe we should redraw some of
those maps.
