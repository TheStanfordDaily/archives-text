## Former Law School administrator to take permanent position 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Thomas Mcßride added the word
former to his title of associate dean of
the Law School yesterday.
And today, the 60-year-old lawyer
removed the word acting from his title
of acting director of Environmental
Health and Safety.
Mcßride, who has filled the shoes of
Carol Hoerner since she quit her post
as the University's safety czar Nov. 1,
decided he liked the job and would stay.
"In a very short time as interim di
rector, [Mcßride] has identified an im
portant set of issues, has shown great
managerial skills and has boosted
morale at Environmental Health and
Safety," said Biological Sciences Prof.
Robert Simoni, who is chair of the Uni
versity's Committee on Health and
Safety. "Any one of those accomplish
ments alone would have been impres
sive."
Before arriving at Stanford, Mcßride
was a U.S. government troubleshooter,
serving at different times as inspector

'I told everyone when I took this job
that I wouldn't play lawyer.'
— Thomas Mcßride

general for the Department of Labor
and the Department of Agriculture. He
was also an associate Watergate special
prosecutor.
Mcßride said one of the most impor
tant issues facing the University is risk
assessment. "I'd like to see a better
method to rank relative risks on
campus," he said.
For example, campus administrators
must determine whether more money
should go to bolster buildings in the
Quad against another earthquake or to
remove asbestos from dormitories.
With the University's funds in short
supply because of a mounting deficit,
straightforward answers to dilemmas

like this one are not easy to come by.
"There's no common scale in which to
view those relative risks," Mcßride said.
Besides developing better risk assess
ment, he said he would like to emphasize
safety education, an area that some crit
ics say is inadequate at Stanford.
Mcßride said his office should help
strengthen the education program cen
trally, but the responsibility lies ulti
mately with the individual departments
and schools.
Mcßride said he will try to not to let
his past experience influence his man
agement philosophy too much. "I told
everyone when I took this job that I
wouldn't play lawyer."
