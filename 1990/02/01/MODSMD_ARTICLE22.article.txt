# Keith Chun
## Final words of wisdom 
### 
AS YOU COULD already tell from
the note at the bottom, this is my
final column. I know, I know,
you're probably all choked up to see me
go and you'll probably miss seeing my
mug every Thursday. But try to hold
back those tears, at least until this last
one is done.
Writing for The Daily has made it an
interesting quarter and a half. It's made
me really have to pay attention to what's
going on at Stanford and out there in
the world. It's really hard to crawl under
a rock and do problem sets all day when
you have to write 4000 characters and
turn it in every Tuesday at five o'clock.
Overall, I've enjoyed it.
But, looking back, I've also found that
there's been a lot of issues that I've
wanted to address, but just didn't have
the time, or enough copy to make a full
column. As a final column, I thought
that I'd get to some of these hot issues
before time was out. Here's some of them:
Fraternities. They're pretty nice. A lot
of them do public service and stuff like
that. And if they don't damage anything,
there shouldn't be anything wrong with
a bunch of like-minded people getting
together for mutual enjoyment. And be
sides, the dorms don't have enough
money to pay for enough alcohol for the
whole year.
Dating at Stanford. The dating itself
isn't much of a hot issue here on campus.
The lack thereof and the consequent com
plaining is, however. My advice? Well, I
remember a high school teacher telling
me that if teenagers dressed like adults,
then they acted like adults. I think that

the same thing could apply to dating. If
people want to go on more dates, we'll
have to lose the sweatpants and sweat
shirt combo with the just-rolled-out-of
bed and couldn't-shower-look. Maybe that
could help in the battle for a date.
Big Game. Big Deal. Who really cares
if we're last or second to last in the
division? Somehow we've built up enough
hate and animosity for a small war with
a school that very few of us know any
thing about. I know, I know, like Chanel
No. 5, "live the fantasy."
The Earthquake. It was scary there
for awhile, but not quite as scary as all
the portables that are popping up all over
campus. I say that the class of *91 senior
pledge should be to never give any money
to the University until those things are
gone.
The Review. It's sort of like black
licorice. Some people like it, and everyone
else hates it. If you're really, really, really,
really hungry, and there's absolutely
nothing else to get, you might pick some
up, even though halfway through the bag
you realize how much you still hate it
and end up throwing it at someone or
leaving it under a chair somewhere.
The Daily. All the people that I've met
there have been pretty nice, both of them.
Oh, except for that guy who nearly bit
my head off when I tried to turn in a
story from a disk that had a virus on it.
Good gravy, use a Meyer Mac and they
treat you like you're an axe murderer.
Other than that, it's been nice to be
among the illustrious ranks of the five
unpaid Daily staffers.
President Bush's pro-life, pro-adoption

stance. I'll start considering it as soon
as the orphanages are empty and all stu
dents are taught sex education.
Don Kennedy. Seems like a nice dude.
The Building 10 Takeover. Plenty of
mistakes were made that day, on both
sides. But the real kicker was the drawn
out court battle. That was a little much.
I could imagine the conversation:
Judge: "So, with what are these young
men and women charged?"
District Attorney: "Unlawful assembly,
obstructing police business."
Judge: "Why did the students do this?"
District Attorney: "They wanted to
study a more diverse curriculum."
Gee whiz, even Judge Wopner wouldn't
let this one get on "The People's Court."
The new C-passing grade. I really don't
mind all that much. Maybe I'm crazy,
but I was getting sort of embarassed to
have to tell my friends that at Stanford
we can get full credit for a class with a
D-.
Well, that's about it. Take care, don't
hurt other people, and always look both
ways before crossing the street. Oh, and
never put off writing something until the
last minute. It's never as good and you're
bound to make mistaykes.

there have been pretty nice, both of them.
Oh, except for that guy who nearly bit
my head off when I tried to turn in a
story from a disk that had a virus on it.
Good gravy, use a Meyer Mac and they
treat you like you're an axe murderer.
Other than that, it's been nice to be
among the illustrious ranks of the five
unpaid Daily staffers.
President Bush's pro-life, pro-adoption

stance. I'll start considering it as soon
as the orphanages are empty and all stu
dents are taught sex education.
Don Kennedy. Seems like a nice dude.
The Building 10 Takeover. Plenty of
mistakes were made that day, on both
sides. But the real kicker was the drawn
out court battle. That was a little much.
I could imagine the conversation:
Judge: "So, with what are these young
men and women charged?"
District Attorney: "Unlawful assembly,
obstructing police business."
Judge: "Why did the students do this?"
District Attorney: "They wanted to
study a more diverse curriculum."
Gee whiz, even Judge Wopner wouldn't
let this one get on "The People's Court."
The new C-passing grade. I really don't
mind all that much. Maybe I'm crazy,
but I was getting sort of embarassed to
have to tell my friends that at Stanford
we can get full credit for a class with a
D-.
Well, that's about it. Take care, don't
hurt other people, and always look both
ways before crossing the street. Oh, and
never put off writing something until the
last minute. It's never as good and you're
bound to make mistaykes.

AS YOU COULD already tell from
the note at the bottom, this is my
final column. I know, I know,
you're probably all choked up to see me
go and you'll probably miss seeing my
mug every Thursday. But try to hold
back those tears, at least until this last
one is done.
Writing for The Daily has made it an
interesting quarter and a half. It's made
me really have to pay attention to what's
going on at Stanford and out there in
the world. It's really hard to crawl under
a rock and do problem sets all day when
you have to write 4000 characters and
turn it in every Tuesday at five o'clock.
Overall, I've enjoyed it.
But, looking back, I've also found that
there's been a lot of issues that I've
wanted to address, but just didn't have
the time, or enough copy to make a full
column. As a final column, I thought
that I'd get to some of these hot issues
before time was out. Here's some of them:
Fraternities. They're pretty nice. A lot
of them do public service and stuff like
that. And if they don't damage anything,
there shouldn't be anything wrong with
a bunch of like-minded people getting
together for mutual enjoyment. And be
sides, the dorms don't have enough
money to pay for enough alcohol for the
whole year.
Dating at Stanford. The dating itself
isn't much of a hot issue here on campus.
The lack thereof and the consequent com
plaining is, however. My advice? Well, I
remember a high school teacher telling
me that if teenagers dressed like adults,
then they acted like adults. I think that

the same thing could apply to dating. If
people want to go on more dates, we'll
have to lose the sweatpants and sweat
shirt combo with the just-rolled-out-of
bed and couldn't-shower-look. Maybe that
could help in the battle for a date.
Big Game. Big Deal. Who really cares
if we're last or second to last in the
division? Somehow we've built up enough
hate and animosity for a small war with
a school that very few of us know any
thing about. I know, I know, like Chanel
No. 5, "live the fantasy."
The Earthquake. It was scary there
for awhile, but not quite as scary as all
the portables that are popping up all over
campus. I say that the class of *91 senior
pledge should be to never give any money
to the University until those things are
gone.
The Review. It's sort of like black
licorice. Some people like it, and everyone
else hates it. If you're really, really, really,
really hungry, and there's absolutely
nothing else to get, you might pick some
up, even though halfway through the bag
you realize how much you still hate it
and end up throwing it at someone or
leaving it under a chair somewhere.
The Daily. All the people that I've met
there have been pretty nice, both of them.
Oh, except for that guy who nearly bit
my head off when I tried to turn in a
story from a disk that had a virus on it.
