AFTER READING The Daily's
article "The war of the words,"
the lack of logic in justifying the
use of terms like freshman and black
as opposed to frosh or first-year under
graduate and African-American was
quite apparent.
In the opinion of Lora Dawn
Headrick presenting the argument for
freshman, Headrick uses the quote
"the word was made for man, not man
for the word." The quote, if viewed in
its proper historical context, is true.
When the English language was
being formed by white males, words
were tailored to fit them. Policeman,
businessman, congressman, freshman,
etc. It made logical sense to place
"man" at the end of each of the terms
because women were all but excluded
from society, save having babies and
taking care of the home.
However, as society changed, so did
the roles of women. In the 1990s all
Eolicemen aren't men, neither are all
usinessmen, congressmen, freshmen,
etc. Just as society has changed and is
finally allowing women many of the

same benefits as men, the language
needs to change to reflect society.
Simply using a word to define a
group because of its syllable count, and
ignoring the social and political
ramifications of a term is ignorant and
insensitive. People who continually
place "man" at the end of words are
excluding half the world's population
and making women invisible — causing
people to assume the word is the
thing, i.e. all congressmen are men.
As with the term freshmen, when it
was coined all first-year undergradu
ates were men. Not anymore. Headrick
says that freshman is gender-specific.
That's true. It specifies male, first-year

undergraduates. I believe that if frosh
is inappropriate, then first-year under
graduate is the next logical choice. The
Daily could also use the terms inter
changeably. After all, frosh only has
one syllable.
Next, Dave Bianco, a proofreader for
The Daily, attempts to explain why
black is more valid than African-
American. Bianco says that "as each
term acquires a less-than-positive
connotation, a new term is coined."
This is not the case with African-
American and black.
The term black has not taken on a
negative connotation; it's that African-

American has grown in prominence
and recognition as a term that refers
to black Americans of African descent.
It gives black Americans a precise link
to their African heritage as well as
recognizing that we are also Ameri
cans.
Bianco also says the term African-
American includes "Egyptians and
South African whites." That's not true.
African-American refers to black people
of African descent born in America.
This rules out Egyptians (because they
are born in Egypt) and white South
Africans (because they are white and
born in South Africa).
Because self-determination has been
a crucial element of empowerment for
African-Americans, as well as for other
people of color and members of other
minority groups, it is not the place of
a white male proofreader to determine
what precipitates a change in terms
that define black Americans. I agree
with Steve Phillips' assessment that
the two words should be used inter
changeably, which is the policy with
most mtgor, credible newspapers and

magazines. ♦
If members of The Daily staff con
tinue to act as language dictators and
continue to determine which word will
refer to a specific group, where is their
commitment to fostering an environ
ment of growth built on multicul
turalism and diversity?
I challenge The Daily to place this
decision in the hands of the people
who are affected by these terms. I
believe the Stanford community, which
The Daily represents, should be allowed
to voice its opinion concerning this
seemingly unimportant matter. For the
groups being defined, this issue is
important in carving out an identity in
the larger society.
I would hope The Daily would take
my advice and seek the views of the
Stanford community to show its com
mitment to an environment of
pluralism and one of self
determination.

black is more valid than African-
American. Bianco says that "as each
term acquires a less-than-positive
connotation, a new term is coined."
This is not the case with African-
American and black.
The term black has not taken on a
negative connotation; it's that African-

American has grown in prominence
and recognition as a term that refers
to black Americans of African descent.
It gives black Americans a precise link
to their African heritage as well as
recognizing that we are also Ameri
cans.
Bianco also says the term African-
American includes "Egyptians and
South African whites." That's not true.
African-American refers to black people
of African descent born in America.
This rules out Egyptians (because they
are born in Egypt) and white South
Africans (because they are white and
born in South Africa).
Because self-determination has been
a crucial element of empowerment for
African-Americans, as well as for other
people of color and members of other
minority groups, it is not the place of
a white male proofreader to determine
what precipitates a change in terms
that define black Americans. I agree
with Steve Phillips' assessment that
the two words should be used inter
changeably, which is the policy with
most mtgor, credible newspapers and

magazines. ♦
If members of The Daily staff con
tinue to act as language dictators and
continue to determine which word will
refer to a specific group, where is their
commitment to fostering an environ
ment of growth built on multicul
turalism and diversity?
I challenge The Daily to place this
decision in the hands of the people
who are affected by these terms. I
believe the Stanford community, which
The Daily represents, should be allowed
to voice its opinion concerning this
seemingly unimportant matter. For the
groups being defined, this issue is
important in carving out an identity in
the larger society.
I would hope The Daily would take
my advice and seek the views of the
Stanford community to show its com
mitment to an environment of
pluralism and one of self
determination.
