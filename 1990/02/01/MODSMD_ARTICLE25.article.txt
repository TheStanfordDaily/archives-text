## Netters whitewash Rainbows in season opener Men lose just one match 
### Greg Gottesman Editorial staff 
Maybe it was the cold weather.
Maybe it was that Stanford played
at a higher level. Regardless of
the reasons, most of the men's
tennis team did not even take off
its sweats en route to a 8-1 victory
over Hawaii yesterday at Stanford
Tennis Stadium.

Rainbows 1

In his first dual meet match,
freshman Jonathan Stark showed
why many consider him a threat
to win the 1990 NCAA Champi
onships. With penetrating ground
strokes and his trademark serve,
Stark crushed Hawaii's No. 1
player, Peter Sohn, 6-0, 6-1. "I
was a little nervous going into the
match, being that it was my first
dual meet," Stark said. "Once I
warmed up, though, everything
felt pretty normal."
Stanford's No. 2 player, senior
Jeff Cathrall, also looked impres
sive, especially in the first set, as
he overpowered Mark Willmon 6-
0, 6-3. "Right now, I am just
trying to improve and concentrate
on not making so many unforced
errors," Cathrall said.
At the No. 3 spot, sophomore
Alex O'Brien wore down Stephen
Chin with deep, consistent
groundstrakes. Along with the 6-
0, 6-1 win, O'Brien also recorded
the most interesting shot of the
day. Up 4-1 in the second set,
O'Brien was forced to retreat for
one of Chin's lobs. O'Brien an
swered with a lob — but this was
no ordinary lob. In fact, O'Brien
and teammate Glenn Solomon ac
tually had a brief argument about
the height of the monster lob. "It
could have been a quarter mile
high," O'Brien said.
"No way," Solomon argued. "It

was at least a half mile up there."
After the lob returned to earth
(and, unbelievably, to the correct
side of the court), O'Brien out
rallied Chin for the point.
Before debating the height of
O'Brien's lob, Solomon did some
smashing of his own, downing
Hawaii's No. 4 player, Stephen
Humphreys, 6-1, 6-3.
Solomon gave much of the
credit for his second-set victory
to Asst. Coach John Whitlinger.
"I played well in the first set. But
when things go well, you have a
tendency to lose your concentra
tion," Solomon said. "Coach Whit
linger came over to me (at 4-3 in
the second set) and told me to
focus on the ball. That really
made the difference."
Playing in the No. 5 spot, Alexis
Hombrecher survived a tough
first set but ended in convincing
fashion with a 6-4, 6-0 win over
Peter Cannon. "I haven't played
in around two weeks because of
the knee surgery, so I was a little
tight in the first," Hombrecher
said. "But, after that first set, I
started feeling a lot better."
Sophomore Jason Yee, who was
playing in his first dual meet
singles match and is arguably the
most improved player on the
team, bageled Hawaii's Peter
Holiday 6-0, 6-0.
The three doubles matches saw
some new Cardinal faces as well
as the team's only loss.
In the top spot, two of Stan
ford's most experienced doubles
players, Eric Peus and Dan Tur
bow, met Willmon and Cannon.
The Cardinal duo preceded to
blast the Rainbows off the court,
6-0, 6-2. "I was returning really
well, and Eric was all over the
net," Turbow said.
Stanford's second doubles team
of John Connolly and team cap
tain Barry Richards provided
Hawaii with its only bright spot
as Humphreys and Sohn upended
the Cardinal tandem, 6-4, 6-2.
