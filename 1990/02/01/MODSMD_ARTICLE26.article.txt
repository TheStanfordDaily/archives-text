The University of Hawaii Rainbow Wahines
visited the Stanford Tennis Stadium yesterday, but
found little but gloomy skies as the four-time defend
ing NCAA-champion Stanford women's tennis team
dominated in its first dual match of the season.
Playing without their top three singles players
and their No. 2 doubles team, the Cardinal women
recorded their first shutout of the new decade,
defeating the Wahines 9-0.

Head Coach Frank Brennan decided not to play
the top half of his singles lineup, considering the
less-than-formidable foe and some minor injuries
to two of Stanford's top players. This gave several
players who will not normally start for the Cardinal
the chance to strut their stuff. At the same time,
they displayed Stanford's unmatched depth.
Mario Carruth, Kylie Johnson and Valerie Wilson
responded by losing a total of three games in the
romp. Freshman Carruth, playing at No. 4, defeated
Liat Shemesh 6-1, 6-0. Sophomore Johnson and
Wilson, a senior, matched the newcomer with identi
cal 6-1, 6-0 victories.
Carruth and Johnson, who played in the No. 6
slot last year with great success, are in a tight
competition for that spot this year with freshman
Heather Willens. Tentatively, Brennan has awarded
the final singles spot to Willens.
Playing No. 3 yesterday, Willens dispatched
Natalie Mackintosh 6-2, 6-1. On court No. 1, junior
Teri Whitlinger smashed Justine Tate by the. same
score.
Senior Lisa Green, playing No. 2, was plagued in
the first set by mental errors against a determined
underdog, Karen Felicilda. She managed to pull the
set out however, winning it 7-5. As she gained
confidence in her game, Green committed fewer
mistakes and won the second set more easily, 6-3.
When teamed with Carruth, however, her errors
were few as the duo trounced Enustun and Tanaka,
6-0, 6-1. Freshman phenom Meredith McGrath dis
played her dominating net play as she and Whit
linger blew out Tate and Mackintosh 6-0, 6-1.
Johnson and Willens shut the door on Shemesh
and Felicilda 6-1, 6-3 to close out the meet.
The four-time defending champions will host the
University of Washington tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
