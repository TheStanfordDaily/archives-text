# Funderburke signs letter of indentured servitude
## 
### 
I was casually reading my Webster's
New World Dictionary the other day
when I came across an interesting
little item.
"national letter of intent — n. the doc
ument, signed by a student athlete when
he or she decides to accept an athletic
scholarship from an NCAA school, that
legally binds said student-athlete body
and soul to said school (and his or her
coach, no matter what the coach's mental
disposition happens to be).
Should said student leave said school
for a reason not pleasing to the coach,
the document can be used to make said
student's life really, really miserable. See

also indentured servant."
Well, close enough.
Actually, I like the idea of letters of
intent. It's a nice, simple concept, an easy
way for a hotly-recruited athlete to say,

"I made up my mind, leave me alone."
For 99 percent of the athletes involved,
all the letter does is signify the end to
the time when schools and coaches fall
all over themselves to get prospects to
come to good ol* State U.
Players unhappy with some aspect of
their collegiate career can always transfer
— but at a price. The letter of intent
commits an athlete to a particular school
for one academic year. Leave before then,
and he or she loses a year of eligibility
— if not more. This is where it gets sticky.
To transfer, an athlete must get an
unconditional release from the letter of
intent. More often than not, this is no
big deal. But if the school (read: coach)

refuses to release the player — for any
reason — not one, but two seasons of
eligibility are lost.
Meet Bobby Knight.
Bobby, who coaches Indiana's
hoops team and is without a
doubt one of the best collegiate coaches
ever, has been having a small problem
with one of his players. Oops, sorry. One
of his former players.
The young man's name is Lawrence
Funderburke and, aside from having a
Hall of Fame name, not much has been
going his way since he quit Knight's
Hoosiers in December. Actually, very
little has gone his way for quite awhile.

He missed all but seven games of his
senior season in high school because he
got kicked off the team, which was Mis
hap No. 1.
Then Kentucky started to recruit him
— Mishap No. 2. Three months later the
Wildcats were on probation, and Funder
burke was barred from ever going there
because of alleged recruiting violations
involving him.
And then Indiana tried to get him to
sign a letter of intent, which led to Mishap
No. 3: Two Hoosier assistant coaches
talked to Funderburke (who really needs
a nickname) at an All-Star game. That's

an NCAA no-no. Indiana made a
report about it to the NCAA,
which decided not to punish
anyone.
Finally, Funderburke ended up
enrolling at Indiana — Mishap
No. 4. Even though he averaged
11.7 points in the team's first six
games, the player had an attitude
problem from the start. In a story
two weeks ago in Sports Il
lustrated, other players ripped his
lack of effort and one source said
he'd "nevf»r sppin an Indiana
player so disliked by his team
mates."
This makes a little more sense
when you consider that Funder
burke really wanted to be at Ken
tucky, but the NCAA prevented
him from going there. Anyway,

this all culminated in Mishap No.
5 — Funderburke quit school after
one of Knight's legendary tirades,
and said he wanted an uncondi
tional release so he could transfer.
Knight said no. Why? Well,
Bobby thinks someone — Ken
tucky — has kept wooing Fun
derburke illegally. At least that's
what he says. So far there's no
proof, but hey, who needs stuff
like that?
To make matters uglier, Knight
says he will release Funderburke
if he goes to Missouri, but not if
he wants to go to Kentucky. Bas
ically, because of the letter cf in
tent, Knight now has veto power
over where Funderburke can go
to school.
Does this seem really stupid?
Since Knight won't grant him
a release, Funderburke has
enrolled in St. Catherine's
junior college in Kentucky, and

the word is he's going to sue In
diana to get his release. Indiana
has been very quiet about the sit
uation — they don't know what
Funderburke plans to do. For his
part, Knight says he doesn't want
to hear Funderburke's name
again.
If Funderburke doesn't win the
suit, it means he has exactly one
year of eligibility left — his six
games in December count as one
season, and as it stands he's for
feited his next two. Granted, he's
no angel, but this seems incredi
bly harsh. When a coach can, in
effect, play hell with a player's
career — and let's remember
Knight is no genius when it comes
to relating to players — some
thing needs to be done.

Cameron Macky has signed a let
ter of intent to cover the baseball
team for The Daily.
