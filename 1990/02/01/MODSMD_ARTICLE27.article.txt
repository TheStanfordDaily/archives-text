# Funderburke signs letter of indentured servitude
## 
### 
I was casually reading my Webster's
New World Dictionary the other day
when I came across an interesting
little item.
"national letter of intent — n. the doc
ument, signed by a student athlete when
he or she decides to accept an athletic
scholarship from an NCAA school, that
legally binds said student-athlete body
and soul to said school (and his or her
coach, no matter what the coach's mental
disposition happens to be).
Should said student leave said school
for a reason not pleasing to the coach,
the document can be used to make said
student's life really, really miserable. See

also indentured servant."
Well, close enough.
Actually, I like the idea of letters of
intent. It's a nice, simple concept, an easy
way for a hotly-recruited athlete to say,

"I made up my mind, leave me alone."
For 99 percent of the athletes involved,
all the letter does is signify the end to
the time when schools and coaches fall
all over themselves to get prospects to
come to good ol* State U.
Players unhappy with some aspect of
their collegiate career can always transfer
— but at a price. The letter of intent
commits an athlete to a particular school
for one academic year. Leave before then,
and he or she loses a year of eligibility
— if not more. This is where it gets sticky.
To transfer, an athlete must get an
unconditional release from the letter of
intent. More often than not, this is no
big deal. But if the school (read: coach)

refuses to release the player — for any
reason — not one, but two seasons of
eligibility are lost.
Meet Bobby Knight.
Bobby, who coaches Indiana's
hoops team and is without a
doubt one of the best collegiate coaches
ever, has been having a small problem
with one of his players. Oops, sorry. One
of his former players.
The young man's name is Lawrence
Funderburke and, aside from having a
Hall of Fame name, not much has been
going his way since he quit Knight's
Hoosiers in December. Actually, very
little has gone his way for quite awhile.

He missed all but seven games of his
senior season in high school because he
got kicked off the team, which was Mis
hap No. 1.
Then Kentucky started to recruit him
— Mishap No. 2. Three months later the
Wildcats were on probation, and Funder
burke was barred from ever going there
because of alleged recruiting violations
involving him.
And then Indiana tried to get him to
sign a letter of intent, which led to Mishap
No. 3: Two Hoosier assistant coaches
talked to Funderburke (who really needs
a nickname) at an All-Star game. That's
