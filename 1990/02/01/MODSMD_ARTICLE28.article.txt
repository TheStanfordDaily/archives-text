# Stanford spikers set sights on Cal
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
For the first time this
season, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team is not ranked
number one in the nation. The
California Bears, nevertheless,
should hardly be jumping for
joy.
The Cardinal (0-1), which
dropped a spot to No. 2 in the
latest Tachikara Coaches' Poll
after an upset loss to UCLA
last weekend, will look to re
bound with a vengeance
against the Bears tonight at
Harmon Gym. After vigorous
practice sessions this week de
signed to work out some of the
difficulties encountered against
the Bruins, Stanford should be
at its punishing best tonight.
California, at the same time,
may be up to the challenge.
The Golden Bears, who com
pete as a club team, last year
defeated BYU to win the na
tional club volleyball champi
onships. In Sturm's estimation,
"this year, they're even better."
In addition to having what
Sturm considers some "very
good players," the Bears have
reason for some motivation of
their own. Tonight, California
will play its biggest match of
the season, as Stanford will be
the highest-ranked opponent it
will encounter this year. Before
a traditionally raucous home
crowd, the Bears will attempt
to seize one of their few
chances for national recogni
tion.

The statistics, however, por
tend a less-than-appealing end
for California. The two teams
have met three times already
this year, with Stanford win
ning each contest. In the most
recent confrontation, the Car
dinal disposed of the Bears in
straight games en route to a
second-place finish at the
UCSB-Michelob Light Col
legiate Invitational last
wppKAnn
"We've played Cal three
times," senior middle blocker
Dan Hanan said. "We know
what they can do."
