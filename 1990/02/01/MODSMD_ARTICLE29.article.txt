### 
TONIGHT — 7:30 p.m. start in
Harmon Gym.
NOTES — Stanford, ranked
No. 2 in the nation, is coming
off a second-place finish in
the prestigious UC-Santa
Barbara Michelob Light Tour
nament last weekend There
the Cardinal defeated the
Golden Bears 15-8, 15-12 for
their third victory against Cal
ifornia this season. Since Cal
is a club team, this match
won't count on Stanford's of
ficial record but it should pro
vide the Cardinal with some
good competition going into
their league opener against
Cal State-Northridge Satur
day night at Burnham Pavil
ion. The Stanford coaches
hope to utilize a number of
players in addition to their
starting six, including John
Bezmalinovic, Mike Lowe
and Jimmy Klein.
