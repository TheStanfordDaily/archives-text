### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Overcast skies. Temperatures
in the 50s. Intermittent drizzles.
Basically that description of aw
ful baseball weather was what
greated the USF Dons when they
came to Sunken Diamond yester
day. But if Mother Nature wasn't
nice, the Stanford nine was down
right mean, bashing the visitors
15-5.

Cardinal 15

Dons 5

The Cardinal used five home
runs, solid pitching, good defense
and aggressive baserunning to
run its record to 3-0 while the
Dons fell to 0-1.
"I'm very pleased," Coach Mark
Marquess said. "We swung the bat

very well, got the longball, had
good pitching, good defense. It was
the third straight game we didn't
make an error."
Shortstop Roger Burnett made
it 1-0 with a shot over the left
field wall in the first inning for
his, and the team's, second homer
of the year. Second baseman Tim
Griffin hit a solo shot of his own
to left field in the second, then
Stanford really heated up.
Freshman center fielder Jeff
Hammond led off the third with

a single, went to third on a wild
pitch, then watched helplessly as
the next two batters struck out.
But first baseman David McCarty
hit a two-out double, Griffin sin
gled and third baseman David
Holbrook drew a walk.
Ryan Turner and Troy Paulsen
then hit back-to-back RBI singles
to make it 6-0. Meanwhile fresh
man starter Jamie Cepeda shut
the Dons out through three in

nings. He has yet to give up a
run in his seven innings of work
so far this year.
Hammonds led off the fourth
by beating out a grounder to sec
ond and the Cardinal was in busi
ness again. An errant pick-off
throw went by the first baseman

and Hammonds again raced from
first to third. Burnett brought
him in with a double, Paul Carey
walked and GrifTin drove those
two in with a double of his own.
After Griffin stole third,
Holbrook hit a sacrifice fly to cen
ter to make it 10-0. Arnie Sambel
hit a three-run homer to narrow
the gap for USF in the fifth but
Todd French tripled for the Car
dinal in the bottom of that inning.
Hammonds brought him home to

make it 11-3.
An unearned Don run in the
sixth cut the lead to a mere seven,
but Hammonds completed his 4-
for-5 day with a homer in the
seventh. Freshman John Lynch,
who is also a quarterback on the
football team, made the best of
his first-ever collegiate at bat by
homering in the eighth to pad the
lead. Holbrook got Stanford's last
two runs on a homer of his own
later in the inning.
