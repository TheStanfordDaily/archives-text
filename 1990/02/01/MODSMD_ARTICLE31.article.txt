# Cardinal cagers challenge Ducks tonight
## Patrick is past the playground with more playing time; 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Over the past few years, the
sight of a Stanford guard launch
ing a three-pointer has become
quite common. Todd Lichti and
Terry Taylor are two of the most
prolific three-point shooters in
Pacific 10 Conference history and
Scott Meinert hit better than 58
percent of his treys last year to
set a school record.
With the graduation of those
three last year, however, it looked
like the Cardinal was going to
have to cut back on bombing from
outside and concentrate on work
ing the ball in. But thanks to the
outside shooting of guards John
Patrick and Kenny Ammann, the

'I'm pretty confident just playing my role
— being as steady as I can and trying to
make other people better.'
— John Patrick

Stanford outside game hasn't
dropped off too far.
While Ammann's ability to hit
the jumper was a known quantity,
the outside shooting, and overall
play, of Patrick has been in
strumental in the team's surpris
ing 12-5 start.
Stanford takes that record, and
a 4-4 Pac-10 mark, into a game

with Oregon tonight in Eugene.
But while the play of Patrick,
who is averaging 8.2 points, 2.9
rebounds and 3.9 assists per game
may have surprised many observ
ers, Patrick himself doesn't think
that way.
"I knew I could do the job," he
said. "It's also a lot easier under
the role of a point guard. ... In

Coach (Mike) Montgomery's sys
tem I don't think it's that tough
to be a point guard. ... I don't
have to go out and score 20 points
a game and make things happen.
If I can just play steady and do
my thing, other people are going
to carry the team."
Patrick, a junior, was the only
point guard with collegiate expe
rience coming into the season. He
was thus the likely candidate to
step in to replace Taylor and
Meinert. "I don't know if I
thought of myself as the heir ap
perent," Patrick said. "I did think
of myself as the most experienced.
But I think the position was up
in the air coming in.
"From the very beginning of
the year, I knew if I do my job,
I don't have to do anything spec
tacular — that's what we need in
a point guard. . . . Try and be
steady. Because in the past, if
there was any word that didn't
describe me it was steady."
As the fourth guard on the Car
dinal his first two years, Patrick
rarely got more than a couple of
minutes a game, if that. He
earned a reputation as an incon
sistent, flashy player who would
make one spectacular play fol
lowed by a mistake.
"As a freshman and sophomore
I was kind of searching for things
that could catch a person's eye
instead of being steady," he said.
"It's a lot easier when I am start
ing and when I understand my
role. ... I understand my role and
it's not very difficult.
"Freshman and sophomore year
I felt maybe if I hadn't scored the
basket or made a spectacular as
sist then I didn't do the job. I
guess that's the difference be
tween having a playground men
tality and a team mentality."
Patrick has been a lot steadier
this year and has enjoyed just ful
filling his role instead of trying
to do everything himself. "I think
I've done OK this year and I
definitely think I can play better,"
he said. "I'm pretty confident just
playing my role — being as steady
as I can and trying to make other
people better."
Stanford's strength this season
rests in the front court, especially
in power forward Adam Keefe,

who has emerged as one of the
dominant players in the Pac-10.
The reason Keefe and the others
have been successful is, in part,
the fact that Patrick can get the
ball to them. "Other people get
ting open shots is my job," Patrick
said. "Coach and I have an un
derstanding that I'm supposed to
get the ball inside. We have some
guys who can score in the blocks
if I get them the ball."
But teams have planned to stop
that plan of attack by overplaying
the inside. Against then-No. 16
UCLA, Keefe scored 18 points in
the first half. The Bruins then
double-teamed Keefe the rest of
the way, but left the outside open.
Patrick, who hadn't taken more
than four shots in a game before
this year, responded with perhaps
his best game, scoring a career
high 18 points and dishing out
seven assists. Two days later USC
tried a similar strategy and
Patrick had 17 points to lead the
team.
"It's not like I'm asked to do
stuff like Todd (Lichti), or Adam,"
he said. "Adam's got a tough
role. ... It's so much easier to say
you're going to be relied on to
take wide-open shots than to say
you're going to have to score 20
points a game with three guys

hanging on you. I feel like I can
make those open shots. . . . It's fun
to take open shots.
"Against UCLA, Kenny
(Ammann) and I were just playing
'horse.' We were just alternating
taking open shots. I don't think
teams will play us like that any
more. ... Actually, I hope teams
do play us like that."
In addition to finding more con
fidence in his role, Patrick has
also grown more confortable with
Montgomery's sometimes loud
style of coaching. "He was really
critical of me as a freshman,"
Patrick said, "but it was only
when I made a mistake. It was a
tough time getting used to playing
for him. I didn't adjust to it until
this year.
"He's been constructive this
year and I've been more able to
accept his criticism. Maybe I'm
more confident. . . . This year if
he gets upset and he talks to me
about something I'm doing wrong
I listen more to the content of
what he said. Before I'd listen
more to the way he said it."
The result has been a more con
fident Patrick; one more able to
put his talent to use. And while
he says he hasn't put it all to
gether yet, John Patrick is a lot
closer than a lot of people ex
pected.

if I get them the ball."
But teams have planned to stop
that plan of attack by overplaying
the inside. Against then-No. 16
UCLA, Keefe scored 18 points in
the first half. The Bruins then
double-teamed Keefe the rest of
the way, but left the outside open.
Patrick, who hadn't taken more
than four shots in a game before
this year, responded with perhaps
his best game, scoring a career
high 18 points and dishing out
seven assists. Two days later USC
tried a similar strategy and
Patrick had 17 points to lead the
team.
"It's not like I'm asked to do
stuff like Todd (Lichti), or Adam,"
he said. "Adam's got a tough
role. ... It's so much easier to say
you're going to be relied on to
take wide-open shots than to say
you're going to have to score 20
points a game with three guys

hanging on you. I feel like I can
make those open shots. . . . It's fun
to take open shots.
"Against UCLA, Kenny
(Ammann) and I were just playing
'horse.' We were just alternating
taking open shots. I don't think
teams will play us like that any
more. ... Actually, I hope teams
do play us like that."
In addition to finding more con
fidence in his role, Patrick has
also grown more confortable with
Montgomery's sometimes loud
style of coaching. "He was really
critical of me as a freshman,"
Patrick said, "but it was only
when I made a mistake. It was a
tough time getting used to playing
for him. I didn't adjust to it until
this year.
"He's been constructive this
year and I've been more able to
accept his criticism. Maybe I'm
more confident. . . . This year if
he gets upset and he talks to me
about something I'm doing wrong
I listen more to the content of
what he said. Before I'd listen
more to the way he said it."
The result has been a more con
fident Patrick; one more able to
put his talent to use. And while
he says he hasn't put it all to
gether yet, John Patrick is a lot
closer than a lot of people ex
pected.

Junior guard John Patrick has lost the playful playground antics of his game, replacing them with
consistency and dependability in the Cardinal backcourt. Patrick and his Stanford teammates hope
to break back into the winning column tonight at Oregon.
Over the past few years, the
sight of a Stanford guard launch
ing a three-pointer has become
quite common. Todd Lichti and
Terry Taylor are two of the most
prolific three-point shooters in
Pacific 10 Conference history and
Scott Meinert hit better than 58
percent of his treys last year to
set a school record.
With the graduation of those
three last year, however, it looked
like the Cardinal was going to
have to cut back on bombing from
outside and concentrate on work
ing the ball in. But thanks to the
outside shooting of guards John
Patrick and Kenny Ammann, the

'I'm pretty confident just playing my role
— being as steady as I can and trying to
make other people better.'
— John Patrick

Stanford outside game hasn't
dropped off too far.
While Ammann's ability to hit
the jumper was a known quantity,
the outside shooting, and overall
play, of Patrick has been in
strumental in the team's surpris
ing 12-5 start.
Stanford takes that record, and
a 4-4 Pac-10 mark, into a game

with Oregon tonight in Eugene.
But while the play of Patrick,
who is averaging 8.2 points, 2.9
rebounds and 3.9 assists per game
may have surprised many observ
ers, Patrick himself doesn't think
that way.
"I knew I could do the job," he
said. "It's also a lot easier under
the role of a point guard. ... In

Coach (Mike) Montgomery's sys
tem I don't think it's that tough
to be a point guard. ... I don't
have to go out and score 20 points
a game and make things happen.
If I can just play steady and do
my thing, other people are going
to carry the team."
Patrick, a junior, was the only
point guard with collegiate expe
rience coming into the season. He
was thus the likely candidate to
step in to replace Taylor and
Meinert. "I don't know if I
thought of myself as the heir ap
perent," Patrick said. "I did think
of myself as the most experienced.
But I think the position was up
in the air coming in.
"From the very beginning of
the year, I knew if I do my job,
I don't have to do anything spec
tacular — that's what we need in
a point guard. . . . Try and be
steady. Because in the past, if
there was any word that didn't
describe me it was steady."
As the fourth guard on the Car
dinal his first two years, Patrick
rarely got more than a couple of
minutes a game, if that. He
earned a reputation as an incon
sistent, flashy player who would
make one spectacular play fol
lowed by a mistake.
"As a freshman and sophomore
I was kind of searching for things
that could catch a person's eye
instead of being steady," he said.
"It's a lot easier when I am start
ing and when I understand my
role. ... I understand my role and
it's not very difficult.
"Freshman and sophomore year
I felt maybe if I hadn't scored the
basket or made a spectacular as
sist then I didn't do the job. I
guess that's the difference be
tween having a playground men
tality and a team mentality."
Patrick has been a lot steadier
this year and has enjoyed just ful
filling his role instead of trying
to do everything himself. "I think
I've done OK this year and I
definitely think I can play better,"
he said. "I'm pretty confident just
playing my role — being as steady
as I can and trying to make other
people better."
Stanford's strength this season
rests in the front court, especially
in power forward Adam Keefe,

who has emerged as one of the
dominant players in the Pac-10.
The reason Keefe and the others
have been successful is, in part,
the fact that Patrick can get the
ball to them. "Other people get
ting open shots is my job," Patrick
said. "Coach and I have an un
derstanding that I'm supposed to
get the ball inside. We have some
guys who can score in the blocks
if I get them the ball."
But teams have planned to stop
that plan of attack by overplaying
the inside. Against then-No. 16
