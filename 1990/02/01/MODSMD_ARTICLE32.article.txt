## 
### 
TONIGHT - Live KZSU (90.1 FM) and KCBS (740 AM) with a 7:30 p.m.
tipoff at McArthur Court.
RECORDS — Stanford (12-5, 4-4 in Pac-10 play), Oregon (10-8, 5-4).
SERIES — The Cardinal holds a 56-34 advantage over the Ducks in the
series. Stanford defeated Oregon 58-56 earlier in the season in Maples
Pavilion when Kenny Ammann hit a pull-up jumper as time expired.
Stanford has defeated Oregon five straight times.
DUCK UPDATE — Freshman point guard Terrell Brandon has been the
toast of Eugene since stepping on the court. He is averaging 17.2 points,
6.6 assists and 1.7 steals per game. Oregon is off to a surprisingly good
start at 5-4 in league play thanks to Brandon and juco transfer Kevin
Mixon, who is averaging 12.5 points a game.
CARDINAL UPDATE — The Cardinal is trying to rebound from two disap
pointing road losses this week Unfortunately, the schedule-makers have
Stanford playing two more road contests this week. Tonight Stanford
meets Oregon in Mac Court, a fairly tough place to play. The Cardinal
is shooting only .311 from three-point range after making a total of three
treys in 22 tries last week in Arizona. Adam Keefe is the only Stanford
player who has scored more than 21 points in a game this year.
KEYS TO VICTORY — The Cardinal barely beat Oregon in Maples earlier
this season but has shown the ability to play much better than that. If
Stanford puts its heart into the game, and there's no reason the team
shouldn't, a big road win is definitely possible.
