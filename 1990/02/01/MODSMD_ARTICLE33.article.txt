# Students opt to work over break
## 
### Lena Slachmuijlder Staff writer 
Be it decadence at Disneyland,
madness in Mazatlan, "raging" in
Reno, or just fun in the sun, most
Stanford students simply rule out
the option of more work over
spring break.
But for 90 students this spring
break, there will be no vacation
from learning. This year, six "al
ternative spring break" projects
are being offered by the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service. Two more
than last year, they include:
• A homelessness project in San
Francisco,
• A trip to the Zuni Pueblo Res
ervation in New Mexico,
• A reforestation project in
Stanislaus National Forest,
• Earthquake relief work in
Watsonville,
• A mental health policy project
at Napa State Hospital, and
• A grade-school outdoor educa
tion project at Half Moon Bay.
Last year's projects drew 165
applications, from which 60 stu
dents were selected. The feedback
on the projects was overwhelm
ingly positive, which led this
year's staff to increase the num
ber of participants to 90.
Applications, available at the
public service center, are due Feb.

what to expect, but
this was one of the
best experiences
I've ever had.'

academic class, ethnicity, gender
and public service background,
will be selected.
Participants in the program pay
$40 to $70 for housing and meals;
other costs are subsidized by the
ASSU.
As project director Lori Silver
said, "Students can't change the
world in one week." The projects,
however, are designed to combine
actual public service with learning
about the issue, through meetings
with policy makers and experts
involved in the field.
In one day, for example, stu
dents might help install play
ground equipment for a school or
do early morning landscaping
work; later, they might meet with
park rangers or local administra
tors.
Silver, a senior in political sci
ence, said she hopes the projects
will provide "a learning experience
for students to motivate them
selves and others to increase

public service."
Participants in last year's proj
ects have indeed continued work
on the issues. Students involved
in homelessness projects in San
Francisco and Los Angeles last
spring organized the Stanford
Homelessness Action Coalition
and helped to organize last year's
Homelessness Conference.
Sophomore Anne Blanche
Adams, who participated in the
Zuni Pueblo Reservation trip last
year, is the student coordinator of
the Zuni trip this year. Adams,
along with two other former par
ticipants in the spring break proj
ect, is founding a camp for Zuni
high school students to be held
this summer.
"None of us knew what to ex
pect, but this was one of the best
experiences I've ever had," Adams
said.
Adams, who had done some
work with the Plains Indians in
her home state of Montana, said
that she was attracted to the
spring break trips because, "I had
no money to go anywhere else."
Adams said that in addition to
teaching students about the Zuni
culture, the trip "was the only
way that 15 or 16 students could
get to know each other so well. ...
Every night we had discussions
about what we had done . . .
things we never have time to do
while we're here."
