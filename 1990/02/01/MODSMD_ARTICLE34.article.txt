## Abandon all hope, ye who dial 976 for fantasy, truth, enlightenment

THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING

Midway in my Stanford journey, I went
astray from the straight road and woke
to find myself alone with a telephone.
How shall I say what a connection it
was! I never heard such lewd, such des
perate, such sick conversation! Its very
memory gives shape to fear.
And it all began when I dialed 976
for the answers to my most pressing
questions.
Like many undeclared sophomores, I
am wallowing in the muck of confusion.
Somewhere between Plato and Marx, I
veered off the padded pre-professional
path. And now, my future is as certain
as a pennant for the Seattle Mariners.
There is something I am sure of, how
ever. Those 976 numbers won't tell you
anything you shouldn't already know.
Listening to some of them was like a
barefoot walk through hell. Yet, I will
share this tele-inferno with you.
My first stop on the downward spiral
toward deeper understanding was with
Ruth, Mistress of the Tarot. I figured
that anyone who charges $2 per minute
must know something.
Ruth's recording picked three cards for
me, the most illuminating of which was
the Knight of Swords. "A person or event
is moving swiftly into [my] life, like a
knight on a galloping horse," Ruth said.
She recommended that I "have fun, but
reign in the galloping horse when [I] feel
dizzy."
I made a mental note to keep that in
mind when midterms roll around. (I'm
sure my professors will understand when
I explain that I can't take their midterms
because I'm having disciplinary problems
with my horse.)
While her prophesies were potent,
V Ruth failed to lead me out of the
Vi darkness. On the contrary, the
tarot cards loomed before me
like Dante's leopard, lion
and wolf.

I decided I needed a less cosmic guide
in order to escape the wilderness. So I
dialed 976-SMUT.
The kittenish voice on the other end
of the line giggled, "If you're under 18,
you'd better hang up now." As I'm well
over 18, I stayed on the line.
The voice told me that I was standing
in Madame Zolta's cat house. She didn't
mention any cats being there, though.
Only women. And I had six rooms of
guides from which to choose.
The answer, alas, was not behind door
number six.
Instead, it was a recording of Alexia
the masseuse, who sounded suspiciously
like a rewed-up version of the woman
who had let me into Zolta's. Alexis had
all sorts of interesting things to say. Mas
sage over the telephone, though, is just
not the same as in person, so I hung up.
My quest for enlightenment did not
stop here, however. I thought perhaps
hearing someone else's dreams might be
my salvation.
So I dialed 976-1990, where a man
who sounded like he knew the truth
listed all the encounters he's had over
the last eight years. "There was a
hitchhiker â€” I took her to the hot tubs.
.... And Maria. Maria had huge, huge
bazookas." He went down the list, also
mentioning the "Indian." "She was really
from India," he said. "I went to her
house a couple of times and had curry."
And there was "the fat lady," with whom
he "went out a couple of times." Too
bad he couldn't remember her name.
Soon I realized he didn't have all the
answers, although he was asking more
interesting questions. Perhaps a live
guide may better serve me, I thought.
To that end, I dialed the"The Dream
line," and shared a brief, personal fantasy
with a stranger.
Yet Fate had decreed this Virgil to be
rather uninspirational. "Honey, take a
shower," the weedy-voiced man advised
when I was through describing my fa
write health-food fantasy.

This quick-and-dirty conversation
heralded the nadir of my odyssey through
the inferno. Even without Virgil, I j
realized that I would not find my salva- I
tion if I limited my quest to the bodily '
arena.
