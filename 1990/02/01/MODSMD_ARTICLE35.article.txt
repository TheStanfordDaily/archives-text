# Legendary columnist bids wistful farewell to Stanford's funny bone
## 
### 
The problem with being a humor writer
is not that it's hard to write funny stuff.
The problem is that it's hard not to. For
instance, in my classes at Stanford I have
written papers that:
• Explained how "Star Wars" was a
movie based on Chinese Taoism.
•Argued that Van Halen's "5150" al
bum was a plea for nuclear disarmament.
• Showed what would happen if "60
Minutes" investigated "Fantasy Island."
Needless to say, I'm not in much danger
of bagging a Rhodes or a Fullbright any
time soon.
I've been writing humor for as long as
I can remember My mother still has a
science fiction story I wrote in fourth
grade, the climax of which saw a ship of
marauding Klingons defeated by a package
of Bounce anti-static laundry sheets. (Get
it? They didn't "cling on" anymore.) I
think I've pretty much maintained that
level of sophistication in my humor.
Being funny on paper, I discovered, is
not at all like being runny in person. That's
why I was never the kid in third grade
who could get milk to come out of his
nose. Successful humor writing depends
as much on word order and rhythm as it
does on the actual jokes. The funniest
ideas, when committed to paper, are some
times as humorous as those public service
announcements for extraterrestrial dis
eases you sec on TV. It's hard to explain,

but you just can't take a stand-up comedy
routine and copy it onto paper. Humor,
as writing, has a completely different
structure than stand-up comedy.
Humor writing also does not offer any
kind of immediate response from the au
dience — you don't have a group of your
fans, sitting in front of you, laughing.
Sometimes, if I sec somebody walking
through White Plaza reading my column,
I'll circle around them on my bike to see
if they're smiling or giggling. Must give
people the most godawful creeps.
When I came to Stanford as a freshman
in 1986 I had a sort of vague idea that I
wanted to write for the newspaper or some
thing in my spare time. I had come here,
believe it or not, as a Math major. Math!
It only took two quarters to disabuse me
of that notion. Put simply: If you think
of Math as being the Super Bowl, I'm the
Denver Broncos.
I even went into The Daily a couple of
times early in my freshman year, though
I was far too shy to think of actually
talking to anyone. I'd sort of mill arouna,
not speaking, hoping somebody would as
sign me an article by accident. The editors
must have wondered why there was a
mute kid with a bad haircut standing
around in the newsroom.
It wasn't until spring quarter that the
Entertainment Editor, Mark Tompkins,
talked me into writing for The Daily. We

had been introduced through mutual
friends, and he assigned me my first Daily
article, a review of a performance of "Ar
senic and Old Lace" in San Francisco. It
took me two evenings to write the review,
but from that moment on, to quote Marion
Bany, I was irreversibly hooked. After writ
ing a few entertainment stories I was of
fered the Bug Me column, and the rest,
as they say in Building 200, is history.
Not everything went smoothly for me
in the beginning. During my sophomore
year I covered a speech by Libertarian
presidential candidate Ron Paul for the
news section of The Daily. My article ran
the next day, on the front page, with four
(count 'em) factual errors. I even got the
auditorium wrong I said the speech was
Even in Cubberley; it was held at Annen
:rg. You could train a small rodent to
do better.
The Daily takes lots of abuse from its
readers for exactly this reason. We do,
after all, make some world-class mistakes
on occasion. Still, these mistakes are a
product of one of The Daily's most
cherished of policies: Experience is simply
not necessary. Walk into The Daily offices,
choose a department and by the end of
the week your name can be splashed on
the pages of 15,000 newspapers. Trial by
fire, it's called, and it's a heck of a way

to leam your way in the journalism busi
ness. It gave me a chance to find my career
The Daily has taught me well. My ex
perience here has been enough to net in
ternships and job offers from several
newspapers who never even saw my tran
script. If my English TA is reading — the
one who gave me the 'C' last year — I
consider this the ultimate last laugh
This is my last "Tips on Adulthood"
for The Daily. With graduation approach
ing in just six weeks for this Linguistics
(snicker) major, it's time to hang up the
word processor and head out into The
Real World ™ And after 75 weeks in a
row, I'm ready to take a break from the
once-a-wcek grind of a humor column
(My roommate, incidentally, does a hys
terical imitation of what I look like when
I write my columns, complete with pacing,
dramatic Wagnerian gestures and
profanity.)

Before I depart, though, I should answer
the three most frequently asked questions
I get:
(1) Yes, I am shorter than I look in my
picture. 1 don't know why people think
I'm 6' 5" from the mug shot, but they
do Is that Manute 80l standing in the
background?
(2) "Tips on Adulthood" doesn't really
mean anything significant. We thought
up the title the night before my first
column, and it beat out such other con
tenders as "I'll Never Grow Up" and
"Berkowitz's Bits."
(3) Yes, I sleep with a teddy bear.
I would like to express my sincerest
thanks to all of the readers who have
faithfully followed my columns from the
dawning of Bug Me through the ranting
of "Tips on Adulthood " There's nothing
a writer wants more than to be read, so
from this writer to all you readers, a really
big thank you for reading. I truly appreciate
it.
By the way, I'm planning on doing this
here writing stuff for a living, so when
you see my books in the bookstore in a
couple of years, I'd appreciate it if you'd
buy them. I need the money

Andrew Berkowitz graduates this quarter
with a major in (snicker) Linguistics. This
