# Be happy: It's a Glee Club, after all
## 
### Charan Devereaux 
With over 50 members and new di
rector Michael Rosewall, this group is
reveling in its share of glee. Though not
as well-known as other student en
sembles, the Stanford Glee Club is sing
ing and growing.
What kind of music does the group
enjoy? After performing selections sucn
as "Stomp your Foot upon the Beat" at
last quarter's Big Game Sing-Off, the
Stanford Glee Club came forward and
joined hands to sings its own interpre
tation of "It's a Small World After All."
I applied to Stanford and MIT / I ap
plied to Harvard and Berkeley / Though
the first three were tough / Cal is easy
enough / It's a safe school after all.
In addition to songs that insult UC-
Berkeley, Rosewall directs spirituals,

madrigals, popular music and jazz. "We
try to bridge the gaps between the student
a cappella groups and the more tradi
tional classical ensembles," he says.
Freshman Suzanne Holmes praises the
variety of music, from "Hungarian folk
tunes to 'Georgia on My Mind.' " The
group also performed holiday carols at
the Christmas Faire and joined the Stan
ford Chorus for a fall concert.
New to Stanford this year, Rosewall
is working on his Ph.D. in conducting.
He comes from Minnesota and refers to
his home at "choral county." Tenor Mark
Isoniemi describes Rosewall as an "easy
going, laid back kind of guy." Members
agree, adding that their director has a
great deal of enthusiasm. Says Heather
Esquiro, "He's really interested in us and
the music we sing."
Glee Club members range from "frosh

to physics grad students," says member
Abby Williams. She says the atmosphere
of practices is both "energetic and com
fortable." Among Rosewall's favorite
music sayings during rehearsals are
"groovy" and "Let's hold that note for
about two months."
Some members have a lot of choral
experience and some don't. What group
members have in common, though, is
that they all like to sing. "Not just in
the shower, but everywhere," admits Nat
han Reading. "It's hard to get me to shut
up."

If you d like to share a little glee with
your sweetheart, the Glee Club will be
selling singing Valentines next week in
White Plaza. Their spring concert will
be March 2 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
