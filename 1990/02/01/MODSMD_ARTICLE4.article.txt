# Students organize summer camp to teach English in Taiwan
## 
### Elizabeth Weiss 
While many students hunt frantically
for summer jobs, nine Stanford students
and one Stanford graduate have assured
themselves of summer employment by
organizing a language camp in Taiwan.
Juniors Morris Sim and John Keller
first considered creating a summer lan
guage camp last September when Sim's
Taiwanese relatives were visiting the
United States. Subsequent discussion
among friends encouraged a group to
move ahead with the program.
Because the 10 instructors committed
themselves to the plan only a month ago,
the program is still in its developmental
stage, according to Sim.
The Stanford group will teach English
to Taiwanese children aged 3 to 14, said
Sim, who was born in Taiwan and lived
there for 10 years. The language camp
aims to "give students an intuitive grasp
of English" as an alternative to the rote

memorization commonly practiced in Tai
wan, he added.
The camp instructors include under
graduates Sim, Keller, Laura Lynn
Lawrence, Holly Ginsberg, John Reilly,
Angela Bakker, Dave Mack, M.A. Mikus,
Amy Handley and 1989 Stanford
alumnus George Handley, now a graduate
student at UC-Berkeley.
Sim is fairly confident that the camp
will be a success. "In Southeast Asia,
English is viewed as a universal lan
guage," he said, adding that Taiwan's
enthusiasm for English instruction is
closely related to high foreign investment
in the country.
"This is a regular business venture. We
may get money from it, or we may fail
miserably," Sim said.
However, the instructors agreed that
their goals extend far beyond simply earn
ing money or teaching English. "I hope
we learn as much about their culture as
they learn about ours. Cross-cultural

as important as learning new languages.'

communication is just as important as
learning new languages," Lawrence said.
The group has rented a building in
Puli, a town about two and a half hours
southeast of Taipei, for approximately
$400 per month. Camp tuition will
finance the rent and teaching supplies.
Sim said the exact tuition has not yet
been determined, since expenses cannot
be calculated until the curriculum is
finalized.
The instructors have established broad
goals for their program and are now de
signing specific lesson plans, according

to Ginsberg.
Younger children will experience
"complete immersion in the language
with accompanying body actions,"
Ginsberg said. Older children will "move
rapidly through basic units of grammar
and vocabulary," concentrating on situa
tional applications of English.
Sim said activities, games and role
playing will enhance fundamental vocab
ulary acquisition while maintaining
3tudent interest.
If the program attracts 400 students,
as hoped, instructors will teach 12 classes
of approximately 33 children each.

Sim noted that English instruction nor
mally begins in the sixth grade for
children in Taiwan, making the camp
ideal for parents who want their children
to start learning English at a younger
age.
The instructors, who must pay about
$1,000 for their plane tickets, will reside
with Sim's cousin in Puli. "It will be
similar to a dorm situation, but we'll be
responsible for our own cooking,**
Lawrence said.
Sim s relatives will oversee advertising
for the program and the physical setup
of the building, because none of the Stan
ford students will arrive in Taiwan until
spring quarter ends.
Preparing for the camp, eight instruc
tors are now enrolled in Linguistics 85
"Introduction to Methods of Teaching
English as a Second Language." The
other two instructors, George Handley
and Mikus, have previously taught Eng
lish as a second language.
