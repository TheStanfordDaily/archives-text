# Rock against racism at Stanford
## Benefit concert to come to Coffee House Friday 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
Music is a powerful force in res
haping cultures, ideas and values.
Thus, it's no surprise that there
will be a free benefit concert on
campus in support of multicul
turalism.
This event is part of a larger
West Coast series of concerts spon
sored by Rock Against Racism, a
non-profit organization attempting
to bring about social change
through music.
From Seattle to San Diego, in
cluding the Coffee House in Tres
idder Union, groups arc banding
together at local clubs to combat
racism, sexism and other forms of
oppression.
Headlining the Tresidder show

is The Havering, a group of Stan
ford graduate students. The Haver
ing was founded last year by third
year Ph.D. candidate in aeronautic
engineering Yusuf Jafry, who plays
guitar and has a cool Scottish ac
cent. On bass is fellow graduate
student in aeronautics and
astronautics, Ken Chaney.
Vocalizing for The Havering is
Jeff Adams, third-year Stanford
Medical School student. And
rounding out the band on drums
is Walter Sulde, a graduate student
in English at San Francisco State
University.
Also scheduled to perform is
Hobo, a guitar-based rock band
that hails from across the bay.
Hobo's strength is that they deliver
socially conscious lyrics without
being too preachy â€” a la Chapman

and Bono.
Rounding out the Tresidder line
up is Juliet Slip, an all-female band
from San Jose. Juliet Slip has been
together for three years and per
forms synthesizer-based pop music
with worthwhile lyrics. Pop music
with worthwhile lyrics?! There is
a first for everything.
Because Rock Against Racism is
non-profit, all proceeds will go to
the Richard and Carmela Ho Fund,
which encourages and supports
campus programs that promote
cross-cultural understanding and
pluraism.
Each of these bands will be per
forming all original music that's
fun to dance to at the Coffee
House Friday night starting at 8
p.m. Admission is free, but volun
tary donations will be accepted.
