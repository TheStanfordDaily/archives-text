# Good food isn't only in the City

When you think of fine dining,
you may think first of eating in
San Francisco. However, there is
a San Francisco-caliber restaurant
only ten minutes south, in Moun
tain View.
Chez T.J., located in a residen
tial neighborhood, is unique in its
surroundings and style. The quiet
establishment is run by the
owners, chef T.J. McCombie and
the rather witty maitre d', George
Aviet. The two maintain the ex
cellence customers have come to
expect.
Both McCombie and Aviet are
proud of the restaurant, and it
shows. The secret to their success
has been the care they take not
only with food, but also with the
customers.
It is an entire dining experience
they offer. The lights inside are
dimmed and the atmosphere is
quiet. The restaurant is small, so
only two waiters are needed each
evening. Aviet also makes his
rounds so that patrons feel at
home.
Chez T.J. serves three changing
fixed-price dinners of four, five and
eight courses, the largest being the
Cd "Menu gastronomique." The
is not unusual in any way.
It is quite simple and light, so the
multiple courses aren't over
whelming.
Most important, the food is ex
cellent. The poached oysters served

in neat half shells with angel hair
pasta on the side is a not-to-miss
appetizer.
Caviar-topped prawns, also
served in the shell, are a nice com
plement to the oysters. Berry sorbet
makes an excellent palate cleanser
after this flavorful seafood over
ture.
The main courses are just as
delicious as the lead-ins. Both the
Angus beef and breast of chicken
are tremendous. Both the high
grade beef and chicken rest in sur
prisingly good sauces.
Aside from the excellent service,
the main course is the best feature
of Chez T.J. Chef McCombie's ex
perience really shines through.
French-style salad with a Thai
peanut dressing follows the main
course, using lettuce that is picked
from the restaurant's garden. You
may choose an imported cheese

dressing instead, however. And you
do have a decision to make here,
there are five or six excellent
cheeses offered and all are deli
cious. Both T.J and George, as the
French do, take pride in their
knowledge and taste in fine wine
and cheese.
Desserts are all homemade, of
course, and served with French
Roast coffee to end the meal and
complete the simple but sophisti
cated dining experience.
Chez T.J has earned a great rep
utation in a short amount of time,
and deservedly so. It is a special
place for special occasions — and
that is the way the owners like to
keep it.
It is open only between Tuesday
and Saturday, and closed on most
major holidays — so plan accord
ingly and you will no doubt be
glad you did.

Chez T.J. is located at 938 Villa
St.in Mountain View. Call 964-
7466 for reservations.
