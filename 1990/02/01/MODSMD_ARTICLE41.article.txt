San Francisco. However, there is
a San Francisco-caliber restaurant
only ten minutes south, in Moun
tain View.
Chez T.J., located in a residen

surroundings and style. The quiet
establishment is run by the
owners, chef T.J. McCombie and
the rather witty maitre d', George
Aviet. The two maintain the ex

proud of the restaurant, and it
shows. The secret to their success
has been the care they take not
only with food, but also with the
customers.
It is an entire dining experience
they offer. The lights inside are
dimmed and the atmosphere is
quiet. The restaurant is small, so
only two waiters are needed each
evening. Aviet also makes his
rounds so that patrons feel at
home.
Chez T.J. serves three changing
fixed-price dinners of four, five and
eight courses, the largest being the
Cd "Menu gastronomique." The
is not unusual in any way.
It is quite simple and light, so the

Most important, the food is ex
cellent. The poached oysters served
