# Moore paints picture of rocky Flint life
## 
### Brad Bruner Staff writer 
Because average Americans
don't exactly enjoy "celebrating
human suffering while on vaca
tion" and don't visit the decaying
sights of Flint, Mich., filmmaker
Michael Moore has brought Flint
to them.
Packaged in shrewd humor, the
documentary Roger &. Me shows
the tragic side of working class
America more than any other film
in recent memory.
By stepping out of the usual
bounds of documentary blandness
and infusing "Roger" with the ir
resistible combination of a pulse,
a heart, a brain and a funny bone,
Moore has created the most unique
and effective film to be released
widely this year.
He begins by tracing his home
town from its days as a thriving
city fed by a mammoth General
Motors factory to its rather sudden
downfall after the General Motors
pullout.
Moore believes this pull-out
betrayed the faithful Flint working
class. Fie does not stop here, how
ever. Instead "Roger" goes on to
merge this ABC Evening News
type segment with a wealth of per
spective from the actual ex-
General Motors workers, painting
a true portrait of the class.

class. He even tries to bring Gen
eral Motors President Roger Smith
to Flint to see the destruction the
business move has wrought on the
community.
Moore selects "Roger" as a apt
representative of the thoughtless
business practices that he believes
are the source of Flint's woes. Yet
woven with the Roger episodes are
shots of the unemployed them
selves.
In the end Moore does not give
us any strict cure to the enforced
anorexia of Flint, but he does
succeed in providing us with a
viewpoint that is too frequently
ignored in the rush for big business
profits — that of the small guy
who must fight to keep from
drowning underneath "the Big Pic
ture" that men like Roger Smith
continue to banter about.
