# Adjani sculpts masterful Camille
## 
### Matthew Johnson 
"Camille Claudel," it seems, is
"the official French entry for Best
Foreign Film" at the Academy
Awards this March. This doesn't
necessarily mean the French think
it's great — they just think it could
win. If "Camille" takes the foreign
film Oscar, it'll be because it's so
similar to the kinds of American
films that win Oscars — it's big,
it's stately and it's got insanity in
it.
Like those films, "Camille" has
a lot of strengths. For starters,
Isabelle Adjani, dominates in the
title role. It's painful by the end
to watch her disintegrate into in
sanity.
Set around turn-of-the-century
Paris, the film follows Claudel's
life as a young sculptress. She
meets the "master" sculptor
Auguste Rodin. Initially uni
mpressed, she becomes his assis
tant, then his lover. The rivalry
that develops while she is his stu
dent eventually cripples her after
their affair ends. Her fear that
Rodin's influence is ruining her
career eventually destroys her.

The rivalry that develops while she is
Rodin's student eventually cripples her
after their affair ends. It eventually

Adjani's blue eyes give looks that
could kill. The intelligence — and
beauty — that sparkles through
them is reminiscent of a young
Jane Fonda.
Adjani also has Fonda's natural
acting style, and apparently wields
Fonda-like power behind the
scenes. "Camille Claudel" is in fact
Adjani's own project. After she
read a biography written by
Claudel's grandniece Reine-Marie
Paris, Adjani bought the rights to
the book.
She hand-picked first-time direc
tor Bruno Nuytten, whose
cinematographic work includes
"lean de Florette" and its sequel
"Manon of the Spring."
"Camille Claudel" avoids being
a "watch me sob my way to an

Oscars" star-vehicle, however, and
it's to Adjani's credit. There are
no prize-mongering histrionics
here. In any case co-star Gerard
Depardieu's turn as Auguste Rodin
is Adjani's match in subtlety and
skill.
Rodin may be the only area
where the film's subtle sense of
fun becomes apparent. He's a ter
rific character — his era's version
of the Artist As Corporation, so
successful that all he does is attend
social functions and dispense
quotable wisdom and occasionally
stop in his studio to check on the
progress of his assistants.
