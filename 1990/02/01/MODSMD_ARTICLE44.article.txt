# 'Passion'-less film lacks heat, dies fast
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
Let's see if you can deduce the
same conclusion I have verified by
sitting through the film "Mortal
Passion." Examine the following
pieces of circumstantial evidence:
• The film has not been ad
vertised on TV and its stars have
not darkened the doors of Letter
man, Carson, Geraldo or even
Byron Allen.
• More people have heard of my
cousin in Swainsboro, GA than
have heard of the cast and crew
of this film.
• It is titled "Mortal Passion"
and features a poster of a nude
woman bending backwards in
what must be a very uncomfortable
position.
• And the film opened at the
Old Mill Six theater, the home of
stillborn movies.
If you concluded that this mag
num opus leaves something to be
desired, you are not too far off
target.
The story of the film revolves
around Emily Morrow's (Krista
Erickson) attempt to get her hus
band Todd's money.
Todd is a melancholy guy who
has the aggression level of Jello
and tries to do breathing exercises
with carbon monoxide. Emily is a
woman who is in touch with

sexual needs and works as a cock
tail waitress to support Todd while
he remodels their million-dollar
house. Unhappy with Todd's view
on home improvements, Emily
decides to have him killed, sell the
houseand move to Malibu — The
American Dream.
If everything had gone well the
film would have been over in 30
minutes. Unfortunately, Todd's
big brother, Berke (Michael Bower),
shows up just as Emily is about
to blow away Todd.
For the next hour or so, Berke
kills Emily's boyfriend; Berke and
Emily do some post-murder pelvic
drilling; Berke buries the corpse;
Todd finds the corpse; Emily kills
her psychologist; Berke and Emily
do some more pelvic drilling; Berke
and Todd have a fight; Berke and
Emily drive off a canyon road and
kill themselves; and, finally, Todd
sits on the couch and looks pen
sive.
Visually there's not that much
to say except that director Andrew
Lane has done a good job keeping
the camera in focus. The screen
play by Alan Moskowitz spits up
such forgettable lines as "Baby, I
know how you're feelin'."
Overall, I think a better use of
your time would be to sit in the
dark and pass gas than even bother
to watch "Mortal Passion" on
cable.
