# Babbo's adds Italian flavor to mall
## 
### Elizabeth Laurence Staff writer 
Like the oregano that seasons it,
good Italian food can thrive on
seemingly barren ground. Babbo's
Italian restaurant is a prime ex
ample of this Mediterranean hardi
ness. Hidden, of all places, in the
bowels of the Stanford Shopping
Center, Babbo's takes the cake (but
they have other desserts too) for
culinary bliss where you'd least ex
pect to find it.
Impeccable service and food of
near-unearthly flavor make dinner
at Babbo's well worth the inevita
ble tromp through the mall, that
primordial forest teeming with
high school students and other
equally hideous indigenous
species.
Camouflage could help explain
Babbo's survival in this harsh en-

vironment. Well-lit, white-tiled,
sporting large modern paintings
and funky light fixtures, the res
taurant's appearance smacks of
metropolitan Europe. That is to
say, Babbo's looks just like the
rest of the upscale cafe-restaurants
in Palo Alto and especially in the
mall.
Beyond looks, however, Babbo's
has little in common with other
area restaurants. Service, for one
thing, is excellent. Without getting
in the way, our waiter was a master
at making sure we had what we
needed.
The owner himself, whose pho
tograph graces the cover of the
menu, circulated among the tables
to make sure all his guests were
happy. When we asked him if he
was Mr. Babbo, he smiled and said
yes. Then he asked us, "Do you
know what means Babbo?" He ex

plained that it meant "Daddy," the
perfect name for a restaurant that
treats you with family courtesy.
The food at Babbo's is unrivaled.
The menu offers, among other
things, several varieties of focaccia
(a type of Italian bread) and pizza.
Both the chicken focaccia, grilled
white meat with mustard sauce on
Italian bread, and the pizza Mar
gherita, seasoned with basil, are
unforgettable. The tomato on the
focaccia and the basil on the pizza
were dark and ripe even in January.
Babbo's diners are not the typ
ical mall crowd, but families and
native Italians, whose presence at
tests to the authenticity of the
dishes served there. Prices are high,
but not unreasonable considering
the quality of the food.

Babbo's is located at 717 Stanford
Shopping Center.
