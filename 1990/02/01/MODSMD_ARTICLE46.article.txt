# Mermaid soundtrack makes musical splash
## 
### John Louie Staff writer 
The motion picture soundtrack
has lost its allure.
Soundtracks used to be comple
ments for lavish movie musicals,
like "South Pacific" or "The King
and I." Then came the revelation
that by stuffing soundtracks with
chart-topping hits (i.e. "Flash
dance," "Pretty in Pink" and "Dirty
Dancing"), one could dominate
two separate media formats.
Soon, soundtracks became prod
ucts with purely capitalistic mo
tives. Nowadays, motion picture
soundtracks are filled with songs
that might not even appear in the
movie. And songs that do appear
in movies often have no relevance
to the plot or scene, but are merely
obvious plugs for the soundtracks
(i.e. Run D.M.C's "Christmas in
Hollis" which was awkwardly
placed in "Die Hard.")
The soundtrack to Disney's
"The Little Mermaid" restores the
movie soundtrack to what it was
meant to be — a collection of
original songs that is integral to
the motion picture. All of the 20
songs on "The Little Mermaid
Soundtrack" enhance an important
part of the movie's plot.
However, this does not take
away from the songs themselves,
which are brilliantly crafted musi
cally and lyrically. Howard Ash
man and Alan Menken, the team
that created the music for "Little
Shop of Horrors," display their
multi-faceted talents in a variety
of contemporary song styles, rang
ing from "lively Caribbean, to

show-stopping Broadway."
Undoubtedly, the soundtrack's
finest songs are performed by
Sebastian the Crab, the musical
conductor with a Jamaican accent.
"Under the Sea," Sebastian's plea
for Ariel to remain a mermaid,
contains simply ingenious lyrics.
Lines like "Each little clam, he
knows how to jam" are accompa
nied by a resonant Bermuda drum.
Sebastian also shines in "Kiss
the Girl," which steadily climaxes
into a resounding chorus. And
Ariel holds her own with "Part of
Your World," which highlights her
impressive vocal range. (Her voice
becomes a major focus in the
movie, too, but that would be
giving too much away.)
Even the supporting characters
make outstanding performances.
The soundtrack balances the evil
witch's thunderous "Poor Unfor
tunate Souls" with the comical
chef's "Les Poissons." Each indi
vidual number sparks a vivid recol
lection of a scene from the movie.
Half of the soundtrack's songs,
encompassing the entire second
side, are strictly orchestral num
bers. However, their familiar
melodies make them instrumental
parts of the soundtrack.
Somewhat surprisingly, despite
its unorthodox soundtrack style,
"The Little Mermaid Soundtrack"
is skyrocketing up the commercial
charts. It seems that the sound
track is receiving the attention and
popularity that the motion picture
is currently enjoying.
It deserves all of the attention.
After all, this is how soundtracks
