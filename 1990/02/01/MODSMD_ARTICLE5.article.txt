# Jaywalkers take to their heels
## Palo Alto cops use bicycles to crack down on crime

For two and a half years, Palo
Alto police officer Dana Delarocha
has been part of a crime-fighting
duo on wheels. But while the tele
vision "CHiPs" team chased big
time crooks on 750 cc. Harleys,
Delarocha nabs Palo Alto traffic
violators under his own pedal
power.
The Palo Alto bicycle patrolling
program began in the summer of
1987 as a supplementary force for
shopping center parking lots,
downtown streets and area parks.
Originally the officers, outfitted
with Raleigh's Technum "Chill"
mountain bikes, "had a main em
phasis of criminal apprehension,"
Delarocha said.
He further explained that even
though the bike team was effec
tive in making arrests, after the
first summer the "heat riding the
Chill" were reassigned to the traf

fic department.
Now, the main targets for
Delarocha and his partner are
traffic violators, jaywalkers and
illegal skateboarders. Delarocha
said that for this type of duty,
the bikes provide much greater
flexibility than a squad car.
But this advantage does not
mean the end of crime in Palo
Alto. Delarocha pointed out that
the bikes "don't really raise the
arrest and citation statistics, they
just make apprehension easier."
If you're thinking of riding your
bike on the forbidden sidewalks
of Palo Alto, don't plan on out
running Delarocha. A member of
the San Jose Bicycle Club since
1987, he works out daily on his
stationary bike and logs 150 miles
per week on his days off.
Delarocha's interest in bicycling
has grown with his involvement
in the police program. This Sep
tember, Delarocha plans to join
1,000 other police officers from
Europe and the United States on

a 13-day, 1,500-mile biking tour
from New York City to Miami.
Delarocha said the public's re
action has been favorable and that
the program has fostered better
interaction between Palo Alto res
idents and their police force. "The
bike uniform is so informal, it
makes people feel more at ease
just coming up and talking to us,"
he explained.
The uniform Delarocha likes to
wear for summer weather patroll
ing consists of black shorts, black
tennis shoes, the short sleeve
police shirt, and of course, a bike
helmet.
The department gives
Delarocha and his partner full
control over their bicycle patroll
ing schedule. Delarocha said that
during nice weather he "would
want to do it every day," but dur
ing this first full winter of patroll
ing he tries to follow a general
rule of two patrol days per week.
