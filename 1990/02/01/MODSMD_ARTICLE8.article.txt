# More fraternities closing parties
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
The Sigma Chi fraternity, as of
today, is no longer hosting open
parties, and the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity is considering closing
its parties.
According to Mark McNally,
Sigma Chi president, the national
chapter's Risk Management Pro
gram has required all chapters
nationwide to close their parties
to reduce liability.
Fraternal Affairs adviser Mi
chael Hughes said, "We are en
couraged that student organiza
tions are accepting more and more
responsibility" in ensuring safe
parties.
Under the new system, Sigma
Chi will have a bouncer at the
door to make sure only those stu
dents specified on a guest list will
be admitted to the fraternity's
parties. Otherwise, students must
get a special invitation good for
attendance at one party, McNally
said.

"All the guys in the house got
together and made the list,"
McNally said. He added that once
a student is on the list, the name
will remain there for the entire
year.
Sigma Chi is the second frater
nity at Stanford to institute a
guest-only policy. The Sigma Al
pha Epsilon fraternity closed its
parties in December 1988.
"This is not a move to exclude
anyone, just a move to manage
what's going on," Hughes said.
"We are promoting responsibility,
not elitism."
"There are so many risks you're
taking when you put on an event
and serve alcohol" that closing
parties will help keep things safer
and under more control, McNally
said.
Fraternities are exploring other
possibilities such as open parties
that are completely non-alcoholic,
or smaller events such as mixers
between fraternities and dorms,
Hughes said.
According to Phi Delt president

Chris Helling, the Phi Delts are
also considering closing parties.
Currently, the fraternity is
drafting a letter to submit to Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.
The letter reviews events of the
past three months and states that
the Phi Delts "have learned a
great deal and are ready to become
an active part of the community."
The Phi Delts were suspended
last quarter pending investigation
of an accident that occurred after
a September Phi Delt party. A
decision on the Phi Delts' status
should be reached "in the next
few weeks," Hughes said.
At their next house meeting,
fraternity members will vote
whether their letter to Lyons
should include a proposal to close
parties, Helling said.
The proposal will be submitted
within five days, he added.
According to Hughes, the pro
posal will be taken into account
when the Phi Delt suspension is
reviewed.
