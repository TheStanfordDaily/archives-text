Gymnast Duffy
to return in spring
If all goes well, sophomore
Adriana Duffy will return to
Stanford spring quarter. She
stopped out after incurring a
serious neck injury at the World
Gymnastics Championships in
Stuttgart, West Germany last
October.
According to Duffy's mother,
Edda Duffy, Adriana is feeling
"remarkably well. She's very
motivated to do what needs to
be done to get on with her life."
Dufly is currently recuperat
ing at Rancho Los Amigos Med
ical Center in Downey, Calif.,
one of the nation's leading hospi
tals for spinal iryury treatment.
Duffy was representing Puerto
Rico's national team when she
broke her neck between the
sixth and seventh vertebrae.
At present, Duffy can move
her arms very well, down to her
wrists. "She also has a lot of
flexibility in her neck" thanks
to a successful operation in
which she received a metal plate
graft, her mother said. However,
Duffy does not have a lot of
finger strength and cannot
move her lower body at all.
Duffy was transfered from
West Germany to Downey Nov.
19. She is now undergoing phys
ical therapy, which includes
weight-training for her arms
and learning wheelchair skills.
Duffy is also having opera

tional therapy, whereby she
learns how to get dressed, apply
makeup and put on contact
lenses. On top of that, she is
learning how to drive with
manual control, her mother
added.
"Adriana receives a lot of calls
from friends at Stanford and in
Puerto Rico. It helps her a lot
to know that people care," she
added.
Duffy can receive mail at 7601
E. Imperial Highway, Rancho
Los Amigos, Downey, Calif.
90242.

New Woman's Guide
to be distributed
The fifth edition of "A Wom
an's Guide to Stanford" will be
distributed free this week to all
campus residences.
The work of about a dozen
women, the guide covers issues
from health to sexism to child
care services.
Senior Teri Hopper, coordina
tor of the Women's Center, said
she believes the the time was
right for a revision due to a
resurgence of feminism on
campus. This editon of the guide
is twice as long as any previous
guide, Hopper said. The project
began last spring.
A section on health and
sexuality includes instructions
on how to do a breast self

examination, aa well aa infor
mation on birth control,
sexually transmitted diseases
and the use and abuse of drugs
and alcohol.
New to the guide in this edi
tion are profiles of prominent
Stanford women, including the
associate director of the King
Papers Project, Rachel Bagby,
and Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Jean Fetter.
The guide includes a list of
campus resources, including
support groups, academic and
professional school groups, child
care services and health and
counseling programs.
VA Medical Center
gets quake relief
The Veterans Administration
Medical Center in Palo Alto will
receive $56.8 million in earth
quake relief from the federal
government, hospital officials
have learned.
The center's Building 1 was
seriously damaged in the Oct.
17 earthquake and lost 300,000
square feet of clinical, adminis
trative and research space. The
building housed many Stanford
research projects, and the quake
set some projects back several
months.
The federal funding is the
first indication that the center
will be able to construct replace
ment facilities.
