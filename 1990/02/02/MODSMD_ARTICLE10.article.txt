## Serbs flee Yugoslav province as ethnic unrest continues 
### 
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) —
Trainloads of Serbs fled Kosovo
province as protests by ethnic Al
banians resulted in three more
deaths yesterday, the official news
agency Tanjug reported. The nine
day toll now stands at 21.
Soviet-made T-54 and T-72
tanks patrolled streets and air
force jets and helicopters filled
the skies as demonstrators gath
ered at noon in towns across
Kosovo, an impoverished region
adjacent to Albania where 90 per
cent of the 1.9 million people are
ethnic Albanians.
Two deaths occurred in
Podujevo, 20 miles north of the
provincial capital of Pristina, dur
ing a five-hour demonstration,
Tanjug said.
The protesters were killed as
demonstrators attacked a column
of military and police vehicles, the
Belgrade daily Borba reported in
Friday editions.
The third death yesterday oc
curred in Magura, a village near
Lipljan, 11 miles south of Pris
tina, Tanjug said without giving
particulars.
An Associated Press reporter
saw columns of army tanks and
armored personnel carriers ap

proaching from the direction of
the Serbian republic, of which
Kosovo is an autonomous prov
ince. Military jets flew overhead.
Tanjug said about 700 Serbs
were evacuated yesterday, includ
ing 400 children.
Tanks also were deployed in
February and March 1989 during
a spasm of ethnic violence con
nected with constitutional
changes made by Serbia in an at
tempt to gain greater control over
Kosovo. Twenty-eight people were
reported killed last year.
Two shifts of miners refused to
enter pits yesterday at the Stari
Trg mine at Trepca near Titova
Mitrovica, 25 miles north of Pris
tina, as a gesture of homage to
dead protesters, Tanjug reported.
The agency said they also signed
a human rights declaration.
Last year's ethnic strife began
with a sit-in at the mine in Feb
ruary.
During the miners' protest,
police fired tear gas to prevent
about 2,000 ethnic Albanians
massed at the outskirts of Titova
Mitrovica from entering the city,
the news agency reported.
Before the latest deaths were
announced, the provincial govern

ment said 18 ethnic Albanians had
been killed since the violence
began Jan. 24. It said 54 ethnic
Albanians and 45 policemen had
been injured.
Ethnic Albanians want more
autonomy, a halt to political trials,
release of political prisoners and
an end to the year-old state of
emergency. Official media have
described the region as verging
on civil war.
Yugoslavia's central government
said Thursday that the situation
is "further deteriorating," and the
official news agency Tanjug called
it "dramatic."
The government also said a
"dialogue should be opened with
democratic forces in Kosovo."
Leaders of independent groups
in Kosovo issued a statement yes
terday urging federal authorities
to negotiate with ethnic Albanians
in order to avoid a full-scale upris
ing.
Violence in Kosovo has caused
a backlash in some other parts of
Yugoslavia, a loose federation of
six republics and two autonomous
provinces, including demands by
Slavs for weapons so they can
fight in Kosovo for the Slavic mi
nority.

Tanks rolled Into the troubled Kosovo province yesterday as ethnic unrest continued. The reinforce
ments arrived to support the federal police of the Serbian government in their battle with Albanian
nationalists. Albanians, who are predominantly Moslem, comprise 90 percent of the population in the
impoverished southern region.
