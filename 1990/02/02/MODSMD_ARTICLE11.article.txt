# Aoun offensive fails; 70 die in latest round of Lebanese war

BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun failed to crush a rival Chris
tian force and struck a truce yesterday
after a three-day battle that killed at
least 70 people, police reported.
The two sides had pounded each other
with tank and artillery barrages and
shells inevitably went astray, smashing
homes, schools, hospitals and churches.
"It's a death machine," a woman said.
"Victims are lying in the streets every
where, yelling for help, but no one dares
approach them."
Most of the fighting centered on a
cluster of government buildings in Chris
tian east Beirut that house the cJustice
and Finance ministries. Much of the com
bat was house-to-house, and some shell
pocked buildings changed hands several
times.
Police said at least 70 people were killed
and 250 wounded since fighting began

Tuesday between Aoun's soldiers and
Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces, the lar
gest Christian militia. They said hospitals
were packed with casualties and short of
doctors and blood.
Aoun, who has been dismissed as army
commander but clings to his command
of about 20,000 soldiers, attacked on
Tuesday to try to gain full control of the
310-square-mile enclave north and east
of Beirut where 1 million Christians live.
Geagea has 6,000 militiamen bolstered
by several thousand reservists.
Aoun was fired by Moslem President
Elias Hrawi, who was elected in Novem
ber under terms of an Arab League
brokered peace plan aimed at shifting
political power to the Moslem rmyority
and ending a 15-year-old Christian-
Moslem civil war that has left 150,000
people dead.
Aoun says the plan, approved by Par

liament in October, provides no fixed
withdrawal timetable for Syria's esti
mated 45,000 troops.
Geagea has neither accepted not
rejected the peace accord, but she has
recognized Hrawi as president. About
22,000 soldiers are loyal to Hrawi.
Police said Aoun's soldiers tried to ad
vance behind a fierce howitzer barrage
yesterday but could not breach militia
defenses on the southern edge of the
Ashrafiyeh quarter. They said the appar
ent aim was to seize the main Lebanese
Forces ammunition depot in Ashrafiyeh.
Shortly before dusk yesterday, Chris
tian radio stations said Aoun and Geagea
agreed to the truce after a "telephone
discussion" to begin a truce at 4:15 p.m.
According to police, the Lebanese
Forces kept control of the Ashrafiyeh
quarter and port area of east Beirut when
the agreement was reached, with secure

supply lines to their main bases in the
Byblos region on the 30-mile coastal high
way north of the capital.
The Lebanese Broadcasting Corp.,
Geagea's television station, showed
Aoun's navy, armored and air bases north
of Beirut that were captured by the
Lebanese Forces.
Aoun's Channel 5 TV station conceded
the loss of the three bases, claiming
militiamen took the families of the offi
cers in each base hostage to force them
to surrender.
Police said Aoun's forces controlled the
eastern and northeastern flanks of east
Beirut and the wooded Metn mountains
to the northeast.
It was not immediately clear who had
come out ahead in the fighting.
Fighting "noticeably decreased" after
the cease-fire agreement, "but we still
have intermittent mortar and machine

gun exchanges in east Beirut and its
northern suburbs," said a police spokes
man, who cannot be identified under
standing regulations.
It was the fourth call for a truce since
the battle began and the first to have
an effect.
The United States blamed Aoun for
the worst fighting in the Christian zone
for nearly a year and said he should step
aside.
"Gen. Aoun must realize that his bel
licose behavior does not advance the in
terests of the Christians or any other
community, but only benefits those who
want to see Lebanon continue in anarchy
and turmoil," the State Department said.
Thousands of families hid in bomb shel
ters and basements. Thousands more
streamed into Moslem west Beirut during
a lull in the fighting, figuring they would
be safer there.

22,000 soldiers are loyal to Hrawi.
Police said Aoun's soldiers tried to ad
vance behind a fierce howitzer barrage
yesterday but could not breach militia
defenses on the southern edge of the
Ashrafiyeh quarter. They said the appar
ent aim was to seize the main Lebanese
Forces ammunition depot in Ashrafiyeh.
Shortly before dusk yesterday, Chris
tian radio stations said Aoun and Geagea
agreed to the truce after a "telephone
discussion" to begin a truce at 4:15 p.m.
According to police, the Lebanese
Forces kept control of the Ashrafiyeh
quarter and port area of east Beirut when
the agreement was reached, with secure

supply lines to their main bases in the
Byblos region on the 30-mile coastal high
way north of the capital.
The Lebanese Broadcasting Corp.,
Geagea's television station, showed
Aoun's navy, armored and air bases north
of Beirut that were captured by the
Lebanese Forces.
Aoun's Channel 5 TV station conceded
the loss of the three bases, claiming
militiamen took the families of the offi
cers in each base hostage to force them
to surrender.
Police said Aoun's forces controlled the
eastern and northeastern flanks of east
Beirut and the wooded Metn mountains
to the northeast.
It was not immediately clear who had
come out ahead in the fighting.
Fighting "noticeably decreased" after
the cease-fire agreement, "but we still
have intermittent mortar and machine

gun exchanges in east Beirut and its
northern suburbs," said a police spokes
man, who cannot be identified under
standing regulations.
It was the fourth call for a truce since
the battle began and the first to have
an effect.
The United States blamed Aoun for
the worst fighting in the Christian zone
for nearly a year and said he should step
aside.
"Gen. Aoun must realize that his bel
licose behavior does not advance the in
terests of the Christians or any other
community, but only benefits those who
want to see Lebanon continue in anarchy
and turmoil," the State Department said.
Thousands of families hid in bomb shel
ters and basements. Thousands more
streamed into Moslem west Beirut during
a lull in the fighting, figuring they would
be safer there.
