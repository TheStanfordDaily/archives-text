# Baker approves Soviet plan

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary of
State James A. Baker 111 gave qualified
approval yesterday to a proposal by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for a 35-
nation summit meeting next year to sign
a treaty to reduce troops and tanks in
Europe.
Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee that such a meeting could also
provide a framework to deal with the ques
tion of German reunification
But he said the Soviets first must agree
to the principle that free elections are a
human right.
And, Baker said, holding the 35-nation
summit meeting would depend on complet
ing the treaty to reduce NATO and Warsaw
Pact troops and non-nuclear weapons in
Europe.
Negotiations in Vienna are progressing,
although Baker said there is disagreement
on how to deal with combat aircraft and
helicopters.
The 35-nation conference would bring
together the United States, Canada, the
Soviet Union, the Vatican and all the coun
tries of Europe except Albania. The same
35 signed the Helsinki agreement of 1975,
which promoted human rights and, in ef
fect, recognized the post-World War II bor
ders of Europe.
Sen. Joseph D. Biden Jr., D-Del., had
urged the Bush administration to accept
Gorbachev's proposal.
"If we don't provide a framework that
accommodates East and West German con
cerns to resolve the unification issue, events
could seize the day," Biden said.

The senator earlier had urged the Bush
administration to accept Gorbachev's offer
and to use the 35-nation conference to
discuss further cuts in troops and weapons,
the German question and a timetable for
the removal of all foreign forces from Eu
rope.
Baker will hold talks next Thursday and
Friday in Moscow with Soviet Foreign Min
ister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and possibly
Gorbachev. Baker's endorsement of the
summit proposal, although qualified, rep
resented another attempt by the Bush ad
ministration to back the Soviet leader.
Also, U.S. officials are trying to develop
a strategy for dealing with the German
issue.
On Tuesday, Gorbachev appeared to sof
ten the Soviets' longstanding opposition to
reunification. "It is essential to act respon
sibly and not seek the solution to this
important issue on the streets," the Soviet
leader said during a visit to Moscow by
Hans Modrow, the East German premier.
The treaty would set a ceiling of 275,000
for U.S. and Soviet soldiers on foreign soil.
President Bush on Wednesday proposed re
ducing the V fi\ to 225,000 and setting a
sub-ceilirt- ..i 195,000 for Central Europe,
which includes East and West Germany.
It was not clear if the deeper cuts would
be part of the treaty now being negotiated
in Vienna or become the basis of a second
treaty.
Baker stressed that the U.S. priority is
to complete a treaty by the time Bush and
Gorbachev hold a summit meeting in Wash
ington in the second half of June.
