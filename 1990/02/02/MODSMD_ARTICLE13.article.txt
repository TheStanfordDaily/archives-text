Power to be shared
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP)
The National Salvation Front that
took over when Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown
agreed yesterday to share power with
the opposition in a "national unity"
council.
The agreement reached in negotia
tions between the Front and 29 other
political groups met a key demand by
the opposition, which also sought the
ruling body's resignation.
Opposition parties, intellectuals and
potential sources of Western aid have
demanded more democratic methods
from the Front, which has ruled bv
decree since Ceausescu's ouster and
execution in December.
Middleman sentenced
WASHINGTON (AF) - Iran-
Contra middleman Albert Hakim was
placed on two years probation and
fined $5,000 yesterday after giving up
his claim on what prosecutors said
was $7.3 million in arms-deal profits
now frozen in Swiss accounts.
The Iranian-born businessman, who
pleaded guilty Nov. 21 to illegally help
ing supplement Oliver North's govern
ment income with a $13,800 home

security system, bitterly attacked the
government after his sentencing.
"I have been abused by two presi
dents," Hakim said after his appear
ance before U.S. District Court Judge
Gerhard Gesell. "I'm talking about
President Reagan and President
Walsh," he said, the latter referring
to independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh, who directs the Iran-Contra
investigation.
ANC leaders predict
Mandela's release
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)
African National Congress leaders
said yesterday they are optimistic
about an early release of Nelson Man
dela from jail, despite his wife's as
sertion that his freedom could be
delayed.
"Sometimes the press sees too much
in the remarks of the wife who is
anxious about her husband," Walter
Sisulu said. "We are continually opti
mistic about his release."
Govan Mbeki, another ANC veter
an, said he expected Mandela's future
to be mentioned by South African
President F.W. de Klerk on Friday, in
a speech opening Parliament. The
speech, Mbeki indicated, could be cru
cial in making possible talks between

the dominant white minority and the
black majority on ending the apartheid
system of race segregation.
Kashmir calm questioned
SRINAGAR, India (AP) â€” The gov
ernment further relaxed curfew re
strictions in violence-wracked Kash
mir yesterday and claimed the situa
tion was improving, but a former chief
minister said the Moslem agitation
for secession was far from over.
"Kashmir is sitting on a volcano,"
said Farooq Abdullah, who resigned
as chief minister, or the state's top
elected official, on Jan. 19. "We do
not know if it will simmer down or
blow up."
Mexico refuses to act
MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexico said
yesterday it will not charge five
Mexican citizens, including two former
top-echelon lawmen here, who were
indicted in Los Angeles in the torture
slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena Salazar.
"We are not going to file any com
plaints at this time," a spokeswoman
for the Attorney General's office told
The Associated Press. "They were
members of the past administration."
