# Editorial
## Editor's farewell 
### 
IT'S AS IF MY LIFE were com
ing to an end.
During the past two weeks,
ever since the editor in chief for
Volume 197 was elected, friends
both inside and outside The Daily
have constantly asked me the same
brilliant question: "What's it like
to be a lame duck?"
At first, the question was not
funny simply because it was not
funny. But as today drew closer,
the question was not funny be
cause it was a reminder that a
substantial part of my life was com
ing to an end.
It reminded me that two-and-a
half years of the most intense fun
I've ever experienced were coming
to a close. It reminded me that
several friendships would no longer
be bonded by the same passion for
putting out one of the nation's best
college newspapers. It reminded
me that I would no longer have
an excuse for missing more than
50 percent of my classes.
But most of all, the question was
a reminder that The Daily could
— and would — continue without
me.
Although I will be helping train
and recruit new talent for The Dai
ly, the situation will not be the
same. Another editor will be sitting
in my office, using my computer
and making many of the same de
cisions that I had to make — but
he'll be doing it his way, not mine.
While that thought comes with
a healthy dose of remorse, a little
reflection reminds me that the
paper's continuity serves as the en
tire motivation for being editor.
The editor's role simply consists
of making sure The Daily contin
ues to give Stanford students a
fulfilling journalistic opportunity
and Stanford readers an appetizing
source of information and enter
tainment. If the paper proves
healthier after the editor's tenure,
the volume can be viewed as a
success.
Admittedly, my volume has come

and gone with its share of failures
Many projects that I wanted to
complete went unfinished, and
there were times when we failed
to fully serve our purpose.
But my two main goals were
realized — to bring more people
into The Daily and to provide more
in The Daily for readers. Our staff
has expanded from a famished 60
to a healthy 125, and our coverage
of campus has broadened to be
come a more comprehensive diary
of Stanford life.
Most of the new staff members
will remain after I am out of the
editor's chair, and they will con
tinue to uphold The Daily's mission
and make sure Stanford upholds
its own.
The latter purpose becomes an
even higher priority for The Daily
with the recent retirement of Stan
ford News Service Director Bob
Beyers, which has increased
speculation about the pressures
against News Service's open and
honest approach.
Luckily The Daily's independent
status means it does not have to
deal with those pressures, but
many others that exist make it
hard to continue the uphill climb
— most notable is the constant
turnover in staff.
This time, I'm part of that turn
over which I have seen take place
so often in the past two years..
Many of my "Daily friends" no
longer work here, and some are
leaving now. And though most
readers will only notice the disap
pearance of Andrew Berkowitz, his
final column reminded me that
more important things accompany
working at The Daily than the
thrill of seeing your name in print.
As the saying goes, the show
must go on. The Daily's will, and
so will mine.
