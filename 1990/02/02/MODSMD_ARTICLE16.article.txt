All should help choose Asian-American studies prof.

STANFORD IS IN the process of
hiring its first Asian-American
studies professor into a tenured
position. In the coming weeks, finalists
will be invited to campus to showcase
their talents.
These presentations will provide
opportunities Tor all students, faculty
and staff to contribute their voices and
we, the Asian American Students
Association, would like to encourage all
who are interested to attend.
This professorship is a significant
development for Stanford and especially
for the Asian-American community.
Ever since Asian-American students
have been at Stanford, we have been
interested in learning about our own
cultures, histories and communities
and have actively paved the way for
ourselves and for future generations of
Asian-American students.
Asian-American studies is a testa
ment to the spirit of us Asian-

American people and our experiences.
It increases our understanding of how
the past perceptions and attitudes
toward Asian-Americans affect these
individuals today. It encompasses a
wide variety of disciplines, such as
history, literature, psychology, sociology
and music.
It was in this spirit that we contin
ued our efforts to establish Asian-
American Studies last year. After all,
we merely wanted to hire just one
tenure-track Asian-American studies
professor for the entire university.
We circulated petitions and got over
1,000 signatures, ar.d about 80 percent
of the student body supports the devel
opment of an Ethnic Studies depart
ment, according to the third ASSU
Straw Poll taken last year.
Many professors and administrators
were supportive of the idea.
But it was not until Asian-American
students acted that this position be-

came a reality. Through the May 15
takeover of University President
Donald Kennedy's office, the best
sentiments of administrators, faculty
and students were translated into
action.
Now, all of us are working together
to bring the best-qualified scholar to
Stanford.
As the candidates for Stanford's first
tenured Asian-American studies profes
sorship come to campus, we hope you
will consider the following criteria that
we as students have come up with so
far:
• A commitment to teaching as well
as research;
• A desire to further develop Asian-
American Studies as a program;
• The ability to teach Asian-American
history, as history is the foundation of
understanding a group of people;
• A feeling of being part of the
Asian-American community and being

responsive to the issues and concerns
of the community;
• Knowledge about contemporary
issues such as gender issues; and
• Research skills to grapple with the
wealth of underused material at the
Hoover Institution.
AASA invites everyone to participate
in the selection process. Students are
also encouraged to sign up in groups
to attend office hours and have
dialogues with the candidates.
We feel that it is important for
everyone to take time to interact with
all the candidates, so that together we
can make an informed choice as to who
will best fufill the role of Asian-
American studies professor.
If you have any questions or com
ments, please stop by the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center.
