# University needs a balanced European Studies department

In the Wednesday Daily, French and
Italian Department Chair Jean-Marie
Apostolides modified the proposal I
made in Campus Report for a unified
language department to include only
modern European languages, thus in
effect reviving the old department of
that name.
His proposal is both right and
wrong.
It is right in that it recognizes the
emergence of a Europe which, regard
less of charges of "Eurocentricity," will
probably be the central factor in inter
national life culturally, politically and

economically.
Stanford needs a strong program in
European Studies.
Yet we live in one world, and Eu
rope does not live in a vacuum. The
Soviet Union is both European and
Asian, and linguistically Europe
stretches eastward as far as Vladivos
tok, while the Finno-Ugrian and
Turkish languages in Europe are an
Asian intrusion.
There is no sharp boundary between
Europe and Asia. Moreover, Mediter
ranean studies, an essential adjunct of
European studies, requires a knowledge
of Arabic which is sorely neglected at
Stanford.
The proposed for a strictly European
Studies department would leave other
less popular languages, such as Asian
languages and Arabic, in a marginal
status.
In my vision, the new division would

include not only those languages but
also classics and linguistics. The
Romance languages require a knowl
edge of Latin, and it is incredible that
we should be turning out doctoral
recipients in Spanish and Portugese
with no knowledge of Latin, a require
ment in virtually every other
university.
Linguistics has been distorted by a
stress on Third World languages, and
it would be mutually beneficial for that
department to cohabit with depart
ments representing the lan
guages.
The division I envision would thus
include some seven departments. This
would not prevent the formation within
it of a group of departments interested
in European studies.
Moreover, it would avoid the dichot
omy of Europe versus the rest of the

world, which has mused so much bit
terness in Qur debates about culture.
