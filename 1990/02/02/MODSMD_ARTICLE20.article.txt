# Erik Johnson
## My final 15 minutes of fame 
### 
MY FATHER once told me,
"Opinions are like asses. Every
one has one, but they usually
don't want to see yours." With that in
mind, I became a columnist.
Columnists, I thought, have the best
possible outlet for their opinions. They
get paid for saying what they think —
that's it. No grades, no evaluations. What
a terrific job.
Well, we don't get paid. And in order
to say what you think, you have to think
first.
Readers will readily spot mindless blat
her. A lot of people — my professors, my
peers — read these columns, and I wanted
to make sure my efforts were of high
quality.
Forget about the lack of grades. Per
formance is still vitally important. And
it's, still, a great jop. .
I tried to stick to relevant, coherent
topics over the past 16 weeks. I never
understand writers like San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Herb Caen, putting
together random bits of information and
calling it a column.
Sure, he does it everyday — that's
difficult, but I wonder if he just has a
short attention span.
I tried to address issues at Stanford
and in the larger world, and I sought a
sense of connection between the two.
Sometimes I felt like I got it; other times,
I missed completely.
I never felt at a loss for a topic, but
my time in this space is limited. So, Herb
Caen-style, here are some random
thoughts:
The world has changed dramatically in
the months since I took this job.

Everyone who cares about human
rights and dignity should be cautiously
optimistic about the events in Berlin,
Prague and Warsaw.
These changes have had a down side,
however. They unleashed a seemingly
endless series of absurd Berlin Wall and
Panama analogies.
Every urban problem became a "Berlin
Wall at home" or a "Panama in our own
backyard."
Folks, let's try to regain some sense of
historical proportions.
Speaking of Panama, roughly 90 per
cent of Americans supported the opera
tions to overthrow Noriega — the other
10 percent apparently attend Stanford.
I've reserved judgment.
If all the U.S. troops sent down there
in December are home by June, then I'll
call it-a success. For all the knee-jerk
naysayers, however, they should note this
invasion was an attempt to preserve the
results of a democratic election, not sub
vert them.
It could have been accomplished on a
smaller scale with less bloodshed, but
this invasion, at least, weighed in on the
side of human rights.
I'm a big U2 fan. I saw them in Oak
land two years ago and own all their
albums, but I'll never forgive Bono for
making ponytails on men fashionable.
Plainly, they look ridiculous. As my
friend Tim says, "They just gotta go."
I'm curious about the Stanford housing
practice of allowing minority freshmen
to request a roommate of a similar ethnic
backround.
Is this what is meant by multicul
turalism? While other freshmen cannot

Well, we don't get paid.
And In order to say what
you think, you have to
think first.

avoid exposure to multiculturalism, cour
tesy of the Culture, Ideas and Values
requirement, minority freshmen can
choose to surround themselves in their
own, familiar culture. Am I missing some
thing here?
Despite the current debate over fee
refunds, ASSU senator Stacey Leyton
deserves credit for suggesting ffiat"stu-'
dent fees be used to finance the safety
and maintenance of Lake Lagunita.
Although I appreciate the ecological
reasons for not filling the lake last spring,
1 — and most students, I think — want
it back.
What aspiring Stanford applicant isn't,
entranced by the pictures of the lake,
glimmering in the spring sunshine? The ;
ASSU should find some way to finance
the lake this year, and then seriously
consider Leyton's idea.
My 15 minutes of fame appear to be
up. To borrow a line from Lou Reed,
stick a fork in my ass and turn me over.
I'm done.
