## Student equestrienne sets high goals 
### Rohan Sippy 
Now playing at Governor's Cor
ner — one of the best balancing
acts seen in years. A show not to
be missed, one that features a
horse, a resident assistant posi
tion, a fund set up for athletes
and a whole lot more. All these
juggled together with breathtak
ing speed and dexterity. All part
of a day's work for Dana Klapper.
A Stanford degree is considered
to be enough work for some
people. Somebody better tell Klap

per that. Over the last four years
here at Stanford, the East Asian
Studies has managed to
find time for a wide variety of
activities, from serving in the
ASSU Senate to holding an RA
position at the Suites for two
years. One of Klapper's most un
usual and challenging activities,
however, is her passion for the
time-consuming and "prohibi
tively expensive" sport of compet
itive horse showing.
The Denver native started
riding when she was six and says

she has been "showing" her quar
ter horse every summer since she
was eight years old. Klapper says
riding is "a lifetime commitment"
for her, but she encountered both
time and financial constraints
when she attempted to continue
training her horse in college.
One of the problems Klapper
found was that the Stanford
Riding Club was not geared
toward her needs. It concentrates
more on "teaching people how to
ride. ... It was frustrating for me
to be with them, and they could
only help me so much because the
focus of their program was not
really on what I was doing."
Instead, according to Klapper,
"I was going to bed at two in the
morning and getting up at five to
muck out the stall." In addition,
Klapper was quickly spending her
summer earnings to pay for train
ing and other expenses. Klapper
says she got together with fellow
student and horse-aficionado
Susanna Mak because she "was
just trying to think of ways to
make high-level competition
feasible."
The result the two sophomores
came up with was AFIRE — the
Athlete's Fund for Individual
Recognition of Excellence. Klap
per and Mak approached Athletic
Director Andy Geiger with the
idea for funding individual ath
letes because they felt there were
probably several other student
athletes having similar problems.
Geiger asked the students to
design a formal proposal and than
put together a committee to ad
minister funds to deserving stu
dents.
Klapper says AFIRE originally
received about $20,000 to dis
tribute in the form of student
grants. She is proud of the fact
that "it's the only program of its
kind in the country" and says it
funded about three athletes per
quarter until this year.
Klapper is concerned because
the"the sports budget has really
been squeezed this year," and for
this reason, AFIRE has been un
able to grant funds recently. She

says the program is now under
review, but she stresses that it is
worthwhile because there are so
few other ways for individual ath
letes to receive funding.
Klapper says the $1,000 grant
she received last spring made it
possible for her to train for and
compete in the 1989 Ail-American
Quarter Horse Congress, "the lar
gest horse show in the entire
world." Klapper spent five days
last October competing against
hundreds of others in Columbus,
Ohio.
She competed in the catagories
of Amateur Showmanship and
Amateur Trail, an event she says
is supposed to simulate the effects
of riding on an open trail. She
actually chose the events to suit
her horse's ability and says she
was satisfied with a performance
that placed her in the top half of
the field in each event.
"Stanford definitely helped me
get there," Klapper says of her
accomplishment, but the funding
actually only covered about one
fifth of her costs. The in
defatigable worker instead
managed to hold down a full-time
job over the summer and then
race to the stables to train each
night for two or three hours.
It's something she has not con
tinued since returning to Stan
ford, because, she says, "it's kind
of an impossible situation" to
maintain both halves of her life
at such a high level. She adds
that, "it's hard to want to be good
at two things . . . sometimes you
can't have it both ways. " In ad
dition, her horse has now been
retired from competition and is
leading a life of leisure at the
Denver stables.
However, Klapper says,"I
definitely plan to get back into
the sport after college — I want
to try 'reining' (another category
of competition)." Training for an
internationally competitive horse
show took a lot of sweat and de
termination, but she reflects, "I'm
really proud of myself that I was
able to do it."

morning and getting up at five to
muck out the stall." In addition,
Klapper was quickly spending her
summer earnings to pay for train
ing and other expenses. Klapper
says she got together with fellow
student and horse-aficionado
Susanna Mak because she "was
just trying to think of ways to
make high-level competition
feasible."
The result the two sophomores
came up with was AFIRE — the
Athlete's Fund for Individual
Recognition of Excellence. Klap
per and Mak approached Athletic
Director Andy Geiger with the
idea for funding individual ath
letes because they felt there were
probably several other student
athletes having similar problems.
Geiger asked the students to
design a formal proposal and than
put together a committee to ad
minister funds to deserving stu
dents.
Klapper says AFIRE originally
received about $20,000 to dis
tribute in the form of student
grants. She is proud of the fact
that "it's the only program of its
kind in the country" and says it
funded about three athletes per
quarter until this year.
Klapper is concerned because
the"the sports budget has really
been squeezed this year," and for
this reason, AFIRE has been un
able to grant funds recently. She

says the program is now under
review, but she stresses that it is
worthwhile because there are so
few other ways for individual ath
letes to receive funding.
Klapper says the $1,000 grant
she received last spring made it
possible for her to train for and
compete in the 1989 Ail-American
Quarter Horse Congress, "the lar
gest horse show in the entire
world." Klapper spent five days
last October competing against
hundreds of others in Columbus,
Ohio.
She competed in the catagories
of Amateur Showmanship and
Amateur Trail, an event she says
is supposed to simulate the effects
of riding on an open trail. She
actually chose the events to suit
her horse's ability and says she
was satisfied with a performance
that placed her in the top half of
the field in each event.
"Stanford definitely helped me
get there," Klapper says of her
accomplishment, but the funding
actually only covered about one
fifth of her costs. The in
defatigable worker instead
managed to hold down a full-time
job over the summer and then
race to the stables to train each
night for two or three hours.
It's something she has not con
tinued since returning to Stan
ford, because, she says, "it's kind
of an impossible situation" to
maintain both halves of her life
at such a high level. She adds
that, "it's hard to want to be good
at two things . . . sometimes you
can't have it both ways. " In ad
dition, her horse has now been
retired from competition and is
leading a life of leisure at the
Denver stables.
However, Klapper says,"I
definitely plan to get back into
the sport after college — I want
to try 'reining' (another category
of competition)." Training for an
internationally competitive horse
show took a lot of sweat and de
termination, but she reflects, "I'm
really proud of myself that I was
able to do it."

Now playing at Governor's Cor
ner — one of the best balancing
acts seen in years. A show not to
be missed, one that features a
horse, a resident assistant posi
tion, a fund set up for athletes
and a whole lot more. All these
juggled together with breathtak
ing speed and dexterity. All part
of a day's work for Dana Klapper.
A Stanford degree is considered
to be enough work for some
people. Somebody better tell Klap

per that. Over the last four years
here at Stanford, the East Asian
Studies has managed to
find time for a wide variety of
activities, from serving in the
ASSU Senate to holding an RA
position at the Suites for two
years. One of Klapper's most un
usual and challenging activities,
however, is her passion for the
time-consuming and "prohibi
tively expensive" sport of compet
itive horse showing.
The Denver native started
riding when she was six and says

she has been "showing" her quar
ter horse every summer since she
was eight years old. Klapper says
riding is "a lifetime commitment"
for her, but she encountered both
time and financial constraints
when she attempted to continue
training her horse in college.
One of the problems Klapper
found was that the Stanford
Riding Club was not geared
toward her needs. It concentrates
more on "teaching people how to
ride. ... It was frustrating for me
to be with them, and they could
only help me so much because the
focus of their program was not
really on what I was doing."
Instead, according to Klapper,
"I was going to bed at two in the
morning and getting up at five to
muck out the stall." In addition,
Klapper was quickly spending her
