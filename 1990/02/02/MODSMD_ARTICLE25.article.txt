# Are you feeling shy?
## Palo Alto clinic is the place to go

Did you make up an excuse
to miss the last Stanford party?
Well, it could be more than
just the Stanford social scene.
Even if you consider yourself
confident in social situations,
you may be shy, according to
Lynne Henderson, founder of

the Palo Alto Shyness Clinic.
Henderson, who runs a one
woman operation, established
the Shyness Clinic in 1982, as
a result of a survey on shyness
monitored by Stanford Psychol
ogy Professor Philip Zimbardo.
According to the results of the

survey, which was based on about
10,000 responses by students and
others, 40 percent of the popula
tion acknowledges being chroni
cally shy and 93 percent of the
population acknowledges having
been shy at some point in their
lifetime.
Henderson, who got involved
with Zimbardo's studies when she
met him at a conference, does her
best to ensure that visitors to the
clinic don't experience those
familiar feelings of shyness. In
stead of having a receptionist or
secretary sign visitors in, it is
Henderson herself who opens the

door and greets people.
Once settled, Henderson ex
plains what, exactly, the term
"shyness" encompasses. The fear
that a shy person experiences, she
says, manifests itself in several
ways. Physiological reactions in
clude "butterflies in stomach,"
dry mouth, heart pounding and
perspiration. Most people experi
ence such feelings before giving a
speech, but some shy people ex
perience these reactions when get
ting on a bus or entering a
reception area.
A commcn misperception is
that a shy person is naturally in
troverted. An introvert is defined
as "one whose thoughts and in
terests are primarily directed in
ward," while an extrovert is
defined as "one primarily inter

ested in others or in the environ
ment." An introvert enjoys
solitude, often preferring only one
or two close friends, and might
choose not to attend a social event
out of the need and desire to be
alone.
A shy person, on the other
hand, wants to be with others but
is afraid to do so. The shy person
does not choose to be alone, but
he or she does so as a way to
avoid being in a threatening social
situation.
Henderson says she feels it is
possible to "overcome shyness."
She suggests not worrying about
the outcome of a social encounter
and instead to "break up" the task
of socializing with others into
small, manageable parts.
