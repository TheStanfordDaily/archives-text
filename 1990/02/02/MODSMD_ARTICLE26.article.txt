# Bug tackles Meyer fifth-floor elevator button mystery
## 
### Aram Irwin Staff writer 
Dear Bug,
The elevators in Meyer Library
have buttons to go to the fifth
floor. Even the lobby button on
the fourth floor has both an up
and a down arrow. How do I get
to that mysterious fifth floor? Who
works up there? Batman?
— Confused
Actually, Confused, it looks like
Meyer Library and the Mahal
have similar stories.
That famous mausoleum at
Agra, India, was built over a pe
riod of 18 years (from about 1630
to 1648) by Shah Jahan for his
favorite wife, Olga Buck Jahan.
Not to be outdone, Shah Jahan
decided to build a second, mirror
image Mahal directly across
from the first, pure white Tty
Mahal. Only this one, he decided,
would be hot pink, for his second
favorite wife, Candy Jahan.
Eventually, however, after much
berating from Olga, and much to
the relief of his advisors, the Shah
relented and decided that the
mirror-image Tfy Mahal would in
stead be black and that both Taj
Mahals would be carpeted with a
new kind of really furry rug he
had just invented, instead of all
that cold mosaic tile.
Unfortunately, by that time he
had run out of cash building the
first Taj Mahal. The second Taj
Mahal was never built, and the
original Taj Mahal was never car
peted (preserving its intricate
mosaic floor and its architectural

integrity). The world would have
to wait another few centuries for
"shag rugs" to be reinvented, and
Shah Jahan died a broken and
penniless man.
Now Stanford also once had
greater plans for its very own
gleaming palace. I am, of course,
referring to the illustrious Meyer
Library.
Stanford started building Meyer
in the '60s, back in the good old
days when Paul McCartney could
still write music, when UC-
Berkeley still had a reason for
being retro-'6os, when "herpes"
just sounded like the one between
Pisces and Virgo, and when Pres
ident Kennedy was, in fact, Pres
ident Kennedy. These were the
good old days when Stanford was
so disgustingly gorged with cash
that it could accomplish tasks of
staggering financial magnitude,
even filling Lake Lag (wow, man!)
or repaving Palm Drive (groovy!).
Stanford was so certain it could

afford adding a fifth floor to
Meyer soon after it was completed
that it went ahead and put a fifth
floor button in the elevators in
the lobbies.
Unfortunately, Stanford in
vested a tremendous amount of
money in perhaps one of the worst
marketing flops in U.S. history
— Richard Nixon poseable action
figures — and lost almost every
thing. Stanford scrambled madly
to recover, but the damage had
been done. The plans for a Meyer
fifth floor were scrapped, as well
as plans to rename the Hoover
Institute the Nixon Institute. In
retrospect, those plans don't seem
to be such a bad idea. After all,
what's wrong with a little image
enhancement?
Anyway, you can climb through
the emergency exit on the fourth
floor to reach Meyer's "fifth
floor," where you will, no doubt,
find a fascinating array of gravel
and pigeon droppings.
Renovation of Meyer was sched
uled for 1992, but in light of the
earthquake, it looks like we'll have
to wait at least a decade for that
fifth floor, let alone shag rugs.
Dear Inquisitive Insect,
What is the name of the plastic
thing that holds a six-pack to
gether?
— Some Concerned Individuals
on a Saturday Night
Most people would be satisfied,
I think, with "the plastic thing,"
but I wondered if you Concerned
Individuals might have stumbled
onto something bigger than either

of us might have ever imagined
. . . nahhh, probably not, but I
checked into your question any
way.
"I dunno," explained Bob at
American National Can Company
when I asked him that question.
It sounded as if Bob might have
already gotten to a six-pack or
two himself, so I thanked him
and tried elsewhere.
Pepsi representatives at 1-800-
433-COLA told me that the plastic
things "are called 'Hi-Cones.'
They're called Hi-Cones, and
that's all we know." And these
people are the representatives of
our New Generation? Neverthe
less, I must extend them some
sympathy. After all, it must be
frustrating living in a world in
which all you know is the name
of the little plastic thing that holds
a six-pack together.
Coca Cola representatives in
San Francisco were able to verify
the "Hi-Cone" name, and were
also able to give me a little more
information about Hi-Cones.
They're made out of a specially
treated plastic which will disin
tegrate eventually, so they're
supposedly biodegradeable. But
then again, the Statue of Liberty
will disintegrate eventually, and I
wouldn't call that biodegradable.
Regardless, the Coke would even
tually eat through the cans and
their Hi-Cone anyway.
Now you may think that the
word "Hi-Cone" is pretty much
useless. But how are you going to
explain when you call Cowell Stu
dent Health Center at 3:00 a.m.

after discovering your drunken
roommate's gotten his head
caught in one and is passed out?
So the next time you're at the
beach and your friend hysterically
points out a baby seal choking to
death on a plastic-six-pack-can
holder, you can calmly inform him

that the offending plastic unit is
a "Hi-Cone." Remember — your
diligence may save a human life
someday.
But don't expect to find "Hi-
Cone" on your graduate school en
trance exams anytime soon.
