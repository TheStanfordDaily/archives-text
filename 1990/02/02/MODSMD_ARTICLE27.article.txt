## Stanford loses heartbreaker Hoopsters come up one short in seesaw battle at Oregon 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
They may not be All-Americans like
Gary Payton and Chris Jackson, but
Stanford's John Patrick and Oregon's
Keith Reynolds were nevertheless the
main attactions in last night's drama
at McArthur Court.
As the curtain fell, though, the spot
light was shining on supporting actors
Terrell Brandon and Andrew Vlahov.
Brandon's curtain call was a running
15-footer in the lane over three Stanford
players that gave the Ducks a 62-59
lead.

Ducks 62
Cardinal 61

Vlahov's finale was an airball from
17 feet out as time expired that sealed
the Cardinal's 62-61 defeat and dropped
the team to 12-6, 4-5 in Pacific 10 Con
ference play. The Ducks are 11-8, 6-4.
Stanford was actually given the op
portunity to win the game by Reynolds.
With 10 ticks left on the clock, lie missed
the front end of a one-and-one to spoil
an otherwise flawless effort. Marcus
Lollie brought the ball upcourt, was cut
off and dished to Vlahov, who then took
the ill-fated shot.
"We had every opportunity to win,"
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "We
made critical turnovers in one period
of time."
That period came right after Stanford
opened the game's largest lead, 39-29,
with 15 minutes, 16 seconds remaining.
It seemed as though the Cardinal was
in control, and the Ducks were all but
dead. Then suddenly the tables were
turned. Vlahov fouled Richard Lucas,
who made both free throws. Stanford
turned it over against the press,. Bran
don found Reynolds on the baseline and
he converted. Quickly, the Cardinal
called timeout as the lead was cut to six.

Stanford got the ball past the mid
court line but then turned it over again.
Adam Keefe picked up his fourth foul
and headed for the bench. Lucas made
the second free throw, allowing the
Ducks to set up their press.
This time, Stanford couldn't get the
ball across and got called for a 10-second
violation. The crowd of 7,520 went in
sane. Kevin Mixon buried a three before
Vlahov hit Deshon Wingate on a perfect
alley-oop play to make it 41-37 Stanford.
Reynolds answered with a runner in
the lane, the Cardinal committed an
other backcourt turnover and Brandon
scored. Once more Stanford tried to
break the press and failed. Reynolds
sunk another baseline jumper to give
the Ducks a 43-41 lead.
"Reynolds really hurt us on the
baseline," Montgomery said. "He got
some real tough shots off."
The Cardinal asked for another
timeout at the 11:28 mark. Vlahov took

the inbounds pass and promptly
fumbled it out of bounds. Oregon
quickly got the ball to the red-hot
Reynolds and he sunk tne shot to give
the Ducks a 45-41 edge. He finished
with 23 and hit 8 of 9 shots in the
second half. Though Stanford led race
afterward, 49-48, the Ducks' 16-2 run
proved to be the back breaker.

Chris Eisenberg — Daily file
Sophomore Langtry Meyer and the Cardinal men's basketball team lost a cliff-hanger
in Eugene last night, 62-61. Adam Keefe, Derek Bruton, and Meyer will try to use
their height advantage tomorrow to offset the speed of All-American Gary Payton
and Oregon State.
Reynolds became the to go-to
guy because Stanford's zone de
fense stifled Terrell Brandon. In
the game at Maples, Brandon's
penetration led to a 21-point per
formance.
Instead of forcing it to Brandon,
the Ducks got the ball to
Reynolds. He hung out on the
baseline behind the Cardinal for
wards and simply elevated over
defenders.
"We knew the game was under
our control," said Patrick, who
finished with 20 points. "A 10-
point lead went to bust because
we just threw the ball away
"We should've won that game."
The Cardinal probably would
have if they had simply made their
free throws. Stanford was 8 of 19
from the stripe. Vlahov was 2 of

8 and Keefe 3 of 7.
"It was just one of those
nights," Keefe said. "Except for
one, I thought they were all going
in." «
Said Montgomery of the free
throws: "You can't do that on the
road and expect to win."
In the first half, Stanford didn't
hit much of anything. The Car
dinal was 10 of 29 from the field,
including 2 of 8 on three-pointers,
a .345 percentage. The Ducks,
however, were even worse. They
hit on only one quarter of their
shots. The Cardinal took a 25-23
halftime lead despite playing
without Keefe for the last six
minutes as the big man got into
foul trouble once again.
The Cardinal only committed
12 turnovers in the game, but
most of them came during the
fatal five minute stretch of the
second half.
