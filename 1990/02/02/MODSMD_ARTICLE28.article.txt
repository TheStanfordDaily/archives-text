# Men's Basketball at Oregon State
## 
### 
TOMORROW — Live on Raycom, channel 5, with a 3 p.m. tipoff at Gill Coliseum. KZSU
(90.1 FM) and KCBS (740 AM) will also broadcast the game.
RECORDS — Stanford (12-6, 4-5 in Pac-10 play), Oregon State (16-3, 9-1).
SERIES — The Beavers lead the all-time series with Stanford 56-31, including a 77-76
overtime win in Maples earlier this year. Guard Gary Payton scored 36 points for
OSU and added eight assists and seven rebounds. John Patrick hit six three-pointers
for a career-high 18 points in that game. (Patrick broke that record with 20 points last
night.)
BEAVER UPDATE — Payton has been doing it all for the Beavers all season. He leads
the Pac-10 in scoring at 26.6 points per game, and is also among the national leaders
in assists (9.1) and steals (3.7). He has established himself as the nation's top point
guard in the minds of everyone except Dick Vitale Backcourtmate Will Brantley and
forward Earl Martin are pitching in 12.4 points per game each. The Beavers handily
defeated California 98-81 last night as five players scored in double figures.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford is trying to snap a three-game losing streak on the road
and against a nationally ranked foe. Considering the 21st-ranked Beavers clobbered
California last night to take sole possession of first place in the Pac-10, the Cardinal
will have a tough time coming away with the win. Stanford has gone 4-6 after an 8-0
start.
KEYS TO VICTORY — Oregon State will probably press the Cardinal in an effort to force
mistakes. If Stanford can take advantage of the pressure by getting easy transition
baskets, it has a shot. The bad news, however, is that Payton only had 16 points last
night and will be probably looking to have a big game. The good news is that Stanford
can hardly do worse than the 8-of-19 free throw shooting effort the team had last night.
