# Error-less Cardinal readies to stomp Titans

Clank. It's infield practice time
at Sunken Diamond. As a coach
stands at the plate hitting
grounders, two lines of players
stand out near second, practicing
double plays.
Clank. The ball races off the
aluminum bat, skids over the
right side of the pitcher's mound,
and finds its way into a second
baseman's glove. He scoops it up
and shovels it over to the short
stop, who shuffles his feet across
the bag and fires to first baseman
David McCarty.
The ball pops into his glove,
and McCarty then flips the ball
to another player, who drops it in
a bucket. The second baseman
and shortstop go to the end of
their lines, and it all starts over
again.
Clank, skid, scoop, shovel,
shuffle, pop!. Then again. And
again. And again.
No mistakes.
When the Fullerton State

Titans come to bat today at
Sunken Diamond, they'll be facing
a team that thus far this season
has been doing a swell imitation
of a vacuum cleaner.
The 1990 season is three games
old, and the Stanford baseball
team has yet to commit an error.
Last year, the Cardinal made six
goofs in its first three games. Not
coincidentally, the team lost all
three. The team didn't play a
single error-free contest until the
17th game of the season, and
didn't get its third until the
season was almost half over.
"Certainly I'm pleased with the
defensive performance," Stanford
Asst. Coach Dean Stotz said. "I
think it's unusual to play three
errorless games at any time dur
ing the season."
In fact, the 1989 Cardinal had
only one three-game error-free
streak: the last three games of
the year. Guess who won each
game?
Stanford's D has been so solid
that the team has only had two
plays even come close to being

errors. Shortstop Roger Burnett
mishandled a shot deep in the hole
in the sixth inning against Santa
Clara Sunday, but the play was
scored a hit because the runner
would have been safe anyway.
Three innings later, senior sec
ond baseman Tim Griffin dropped
a grounder as he prepared to

throw, but he recovered in time
to make the play at first.
That's been it, except for one
passed ball, which doesn't count
as an error The team's defensive
improvement, though, hasn't been
a total surprise. "We had expected
this team to be much better defen
sively than last year's," Stotz said.
Why? "Experience, mainly."
With last year's crop of fresh
men — five of whom were starting
at one point — a year wiser, the
experience theory makes sense.
But it might be something more
than that.
"We've just worked really
hard," said Griffin, the only non
sophomore in the Cardinal infield.
"We've played loose as a team —
we didn't have any first-game jit
ters, and we've proven that we
can play well.
As for how much the D has
contributed to the Cardinal's hot
start, Stotz says"I think it's a
big part of it. The mainstays of
any team are pitching and
defense."
