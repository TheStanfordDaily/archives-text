# HIV prevalence to be assessed
## National AIDS study to include Stanford students 
### Lara Filson Staff writer 
Stanford and UC-Berkeley may
be rivals on the athletic field, but
when it comes to AIDS and the
health of college students, they
are willing to cooperate.
Both campuses are doing their
part by participating in a study
conducted by the Center for Dis
ease Control and the American
College Health Association to ob
tain estimates of the prevalence
of antibodies to HIV — the virus
that causes AIDS — in college
students.
"It's an opportunity for us to
make a positive contribution to
the nation's health," said Dr. John
Dorman, director of public rela
tions for Cowell Student Health
Center.
"We'll be contributing to knowl
edge which will lead to reduced
risk for students," agreed Dr. Har
vey Weinstein, acting director of
Cowell.

The study began last year with
19 colleges and universities across
the nation. Berkeley was one of
the first participating institu
tions. The study indicated that
one out of every 500 blood sam
ples tested positive for the HIV
antibody.
This year 24 randomly-selected
colleges, including Stanford, will
be added to the study.
Administration officials held up
Stanford's participation last year
because they were worried that
the infection rate at Stanford
might become public knowledge,
explained Dorman. However,
"There are no individual results
released which could link Stan
ford with any statistics," he said.
On campuses in the original
study, rates of infection ranged
from 0 to .9 percent, Dorman said,
but no rates for specific campuses
were released
The overall average of 1 in 500
is comparable to another group
that has been tested extensively:

military recruits. "There are 1.5
HIV-positive tests for every 1,000
tests of military recruits,"
Weinstein said.
Cathy Kodama, a health educa
tor at Berkeley, said concern over
confidentiality was also an issue
at that campus. "There was dis
cussion of those issues, but we
were certainly in favor of adding
to the pool of knowledge,
Kodama explained.
Stanford's participation in the
study will involve sending
residuals from blood samples
taken as part of routine tests of
students at Cowell to the Center
for Disease Control to be tested.
All personal identifiers will be
removed from the samples, and
Cowell will not get the results.
"The drawback is that it isn't
a truly representative sample be
cause it only involves students
who had a significant enough
[medical] problem to get blood
