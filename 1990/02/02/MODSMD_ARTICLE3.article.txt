# HIV prevalence to be assessed
## National AIDS study to include Stanford students 
### Lara Filson Staff writer 
Stanford and UC-Berkeley may
be rivals on the athletic field, but
when it comes to AIDS and the
health of college students, they
are willing to cooperate.
Both campuses are doing their
part by participating in a study
conducted by the Center for Dis
ease Control and the American
College Health Association to ob
tain estimates of the prevalence
of antibodies to HIV — the virus
that causes AIDS — in college
students.
"It's an opportunity for us to
make a positive contribution to
the nation's health," said Dr. John
Dorman, director of public rela
tions for Cowell Student Health
Center.
"We'll be contributing to knowl
edge which will lead to reduced
risk for students," agreed Dr. Har
vey Weinstein, acting director of
Cowell.

The study began last year with
19 colleges and universities across
the nation. Berkeley was one of
the first participating institu
tions. The study indicated that
one out of every 500 blood sam
ples tested positive for the HIV
antibody.
This year 24 randomly-selected
colleges, including Stanford, will
be added to the study.
Administration officials held up
Stanford's participation last year
because they were worried that
the infection rate at Stanford
might become public knowledge,
explained Dorman. However,
"There are no individual results
released which could link Stan
ford with any statistics," he said.
On campuses in the original
study, rates of infection ranged
from 0 to .9 percent, Dorman said,
but no rates for specific campuses
were released
The overall average of 1 in 500
is comparable to another group
that has been tested extensively:

military recruits. "There are 1.5
HIV-positive tests for every 1,000
tests of military recruits,"
Weinstein said.
Cathy Kodama, a health educa
tor at Berkeley, said concern over
confidentiality was also an issue
at that campus. "There was dis
cussion of those issues, but we
were certainly in favor of adding
to the pool of knowledge,
Kodama explained.
Stanford's participation in the
study will involve sending
residuals from blood samples
taken as part of routine tests of
students at Cowell to the Center
for Disease Control to be tested.
All personal identifiers will be
removed from the samples, and
Cowell will not get the results.
"The drawback is that it isn't
a truly representative sample be
cause it only involves students
who had a significant enough
[medical] problem to get blood
drawn," Dorman said.
Cowell now offers students con
fidential testing for the HIV virus.
Weinstein said 163 students took
advantage of the service last year.
"Most were at very low risk but
had some reason to worry," he
said.
"If there is early detection lof
HIV infection], there is now AZT,
which can prolong the time before
symptoms of AIDS come up," said
Dorman. "You can test positive
for the HIV antibody, which
means you are contagious, but it
can be as long as nine years before
infectious physical symptoms ap
pear."

'It's an opportunity for us to make a
positive contribution to the nation's
health.'

"We've seen people at Cowell
who have AIDS or are HlV
positive," Weinstein added.
According to Kodama, Cal does
not offer HIV antibody testing on
campus. "We refer students to
state-run sites off campus which
are free and anonymous," she
said.
"We're involved with AIDS ed
ucation on campus now," noted
Weinstein. "But if we can tell

what kind of directions the dis
ease is taking, we can eventually
design a more effective interven
tion."
Kodama said there is extensive
AIDS education on Cal's campus
by peer educators. "We have a
very supportive administration,
but for schools that don't, this
study has validated the existence
of AIDS in the college popula
tion," she said.
