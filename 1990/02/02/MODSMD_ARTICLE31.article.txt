# Volleyball tarnishes Golden Bears at Cal
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
With every successful Cali
fornia block or kill last night,
the Golden Bears' 6-foot-7
middle blocker Brent Bush
would raise his right arm in
exultation, stare across the net
at his arch-rival foes and shout.
His antics, however, did little
more than embellish a
seemingly hopeless attempt at
national recognition as the No.
2-ranked Cardinal men's vol
leyball team squashed the
Bears in Harmon Gym last
night.
Stanford continued its dom
inance of Cal, defeating the
squad for the fourth time in
as many tries, 15-2, 15-13, 15-
9.

everything but concede the
match before the contest, per
haps trying to relieve pressure
from his understandably
daunted players.
"I feel we can compete with
most WIVA teams," Nichols
said, "but Stanford is a notch
above the rest."
Obliging those remarks, the
Cardinal bolted out in the first
game to a 6-0 advantage,
buoyed by the pinpoint serving
of senior middle blocker Dan
Hanan and crucial Cal mis
takes.
The Bears were never able to
recover. After fighting to an 8-2
game score, California wilted
before the hitting of Duncan
Blackman and Dave Goss. Hanan
put the game out of reach with
a line-cradling ace at 11-2. Black
man served out the game.
As the teams switched sides,
Cal's coach could be heard dis
tinctly amid the sparse crowd ver
bally chastising his players. His
motivational tirade worked. After
surrendering a quick three points,
Cal raced back into the contest at
4-4.
The Stanford attack seemed to
stall temporarily as Cal jumped
ahead for the first time in the
match, extending its advantage to
9-5 at one juncture. Hanan, Goss
and Duncan Blackman renewed
their torrid hitting and managed
to reverse this trend. Junior swing
hitter John Alstrom smashed the
Bears' fledgling hopes of upset
with a decisive kill at 13-13.
Duncan Blackman contributed

the most balanced effort of the
evening, recording a game-high 14
kills and nine digs. Dan Hanan
once again carried a significant
portion of the defensive chores,
finishing with a team-high five
blocks. Dave Goss, still acclimat
ing to his starting position as a
high-priority outside hitter,
shared offensive honors with

Blackman, also offering 14 kills.
More importantly, the match
placed Stanford back on the
proper course for this Saturday's
home opener against Cal State-
Northridge. Northridge, the only
team to defeat No.l UCLA at the
UCSB collegiate tournament, is
led by the top recruit in the coun
try, Coley Kyman.

Junior John Alstrom will spearhead a fierce Cardinal attack against
Cal State-Northridge tomorrow in Burnham Pavilion. Admission is
