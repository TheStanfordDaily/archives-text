# Volleyball tarnishes Golden Bears at Cal
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
With every successful Cali
fornia block or kill last night,
the Golden Bears' 6-foot-7
middle blocker Brent Bush
would raise his right arm in
exultation, stare across the net
at his arch-rival foes and shout.
His antics, however, did little
more than embellish a
seemingly hopeless attempt at
national recognition as the No.
2-ranked Cardinal men's vol
leyball team squashed the
Bears in Harmon Gym last
night.
Stanford continued its dom
inance of Cal, defeating the
squad for the fourth time in
as many tries, 15-2, 15-13, 15-
9.

everything but concede the
match before the contest, per
haps trying to relieve pressure
from his understandably
daunted players.
"I feel we can compete with
most WIVA teams," Nichols
said, "but Stanford is a notch
above the rest."
Obliging those remarks, the
Cardinal bolted out in the first
game to a 6-0 advantage,
buoyed by the pinpoint serving
of senior middle blocker Dan
Hanan and crucial Cal mis
takes.
