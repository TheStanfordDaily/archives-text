# Evans forgoes money for education, sees Texas as next challenge
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
After getting back from the
1988 Olympics, where she won
three gold medals, Janet Evans
had a decision to make. She could
turn her fame into commercial
success by accepting any of several
endorsement offers, make hun
dreds of thousands of dollars and
be financially set for life.
On the other hand, she could
go to college, where she would
end up studying all the time, go
to swim practice 11 times a week
(year-round) and live the life of
a student.
Naturally, she chose the latter.
"If I had taken the endorse
ments, it would have meant quit
ting swimming," Evans said. "I
still thought I could go faster. Just
look at what I'd be missing out
on. It would have been like a job.
I was only 17."
After making that tough deci
sion, which she said took about a
week after coming back from the
Games, Evans found herself faced
with an even more complicated
decision. It seems that a lot of
collegiate swimming coaches
decided they would like to have
a world record holder on their
team, so the recruiting process
began.
"There were a lot of letters,"
Evans said. "It was hard saying
no to coaches. A lot of them would
send forms, and I just wouldn't
send it back, you know, hoping
they'd get the idea.
"It was down to Texas, Stan
ford, Florida — and USC was in

there for a while. Mostly it came
down to Texas, Florida and Stan
ford, then mostly Texas and Stan
ford."
Evans was interested in a com
bination of both swimming and
academics, and Stanford and
Texas each provided both. After
completing her on-campus visits
and thinking about it for a while,
Evans decided the Farm was
where she wanted to be.
"There were a lot of things,"
Evans said. "I really liked the
team. I liked Coach (Richard)
Quick — he's always done well
with all the collegiate swimmers
he's had. I liked the school, obvi
ously. How can you not like it?
"I liked the opportunity it gives
you. I didn't want to go to a school
just for the swimming. I liked the
fact that it was in California. Now
that I look at it, I have a hard
time believing I had a hard time
deciding."
Evans announced her decision
last May, and Stanford swimming
fans immediately began thinking
of adding four more NCAA titles
to the one the team won last year.
With Evans, who holds world
records in the 400-meter, 800-
meter and 1500-meter freestyles,
a few additional world-class fresh
men and a very strong returning
group, Stanford has been ranked
No. 1 all season long in the
coaches' poll.
And in addition to adjusting
naturally to collegiate swimming,
Evans found living at college less
complicated than expected. After
coming back from Seoul, she had
a parade in her honor, served as

the Grand Marshall of the Fiesta
Bowl and had reporters and fans
following her everywhere she
went. At Stanford, however, she's
just one of a handful of famous
students.
"It was fine," she said. "When
I first moved in, people on the
hall didn't say anything, which
was cool. Then a few days later,
I talked to them, and they said
they didn't want to bother me.
"They really care about my
swimming. My whole hall, just
about, is coming to the meet
(tomorrow). More than distrac
tions, I'd say it's a lot of support."
With that support, Evans and
her teammates have gotten off to
a 6-0 start in dual meets and have
yet to even be challenged. All that
should against No. 2 Texas
tomorrow at noon, however.
"We're all psyched to swim
Texas this weekend," she said.
The Longhorn Coach, Mark
Schubert, is apparently psyched
to swim against Stanford, too.
"I know that (Lady Longhorn
Coach) Mark (Schubert) is making
a big deal about it," Evans said.
"They're coming here Thursday,
and they're not swimming Cal
Friday. They're doing it Sunday.
They're going to be totally ready,
but we are too. I'm excited for
this meet."
Schubert also asked Quick to
remove the 400 individual medley
from the list of events swum. The
event has always been swum in
the Stanford-Texas dual meets,
but Schubert's protesting forced
the teams to follow the NCAAs
dual-meet schedule, which does

not include the 400 IM.
The significance is that Evan*
won one of her gold medals in
the 400-meter IM, junior Michelle
Griglione won the event for the
Cardinal at last year's NCAA
Championships and Stanford
sophomore Karen Kraemer took
filth in the event at NCAAs. Thus
Texas would probably get swept

were that event held.
But despite the high-level
politicking, Evans realizes it's still
only one meet. "It's a dual meet,"
she said. "It's a big dual meet,
but NCAAs are the big thing. But
I think it will give us a lot of
confidence going into NCAAs if
we swim well."
After the Texas meet, Stanford
swims a dual meet against Cali
fornia next week, then has the
Pacific 10 Conference and NCAA
Championship meets. After swim
ming for the fairly small Fullerton
Aquatics club team during the
past few years, Evans is excited
about going to NCAAs.
"Since I'm from a little team,
I always wanted to be on a big
team and have a chance to win,"
she said. "We're swimming really
well right now."

"There were a lot of letters,"
Evans said. "It was hard saying
no to coaches. A lot of them would
send forms, and I just wouldn't
send it back, you know, hoping
they'd get the idea.
"It was down to Texas, Stan
ford, Florida — and USC was in

there for a while. Mostly it came
down to Texas, Florida and Stan
ford, then mostly Texas and Stan
ford."
Evans was interested in a com
bination of both swimming and
academics, and Stanford and
Texas each provided both. After
completing her on-campus visits
and thinking about it for a while,
Evans decided the Farm was
where she wanted to be.
"There were a lot of things,"
Evans said. "I really liked the
team. I liked Coach (Richard)
Quick — he's always done well
with all the collegiate swimmers
he's had. I liked the school, obvi
ously. How can you not like it?
"I liked the opportunity it gives
you. I didn't want to go to a school
just for the swimming. I liked the
fact that it was in California. Now
that I look at it, I have a hard
time believing I had a hard time
deciding."
Evans announced her decision
last May, and Stanford swimming
fans immediately began thinking
of adding four more NCAA titles
to the one the team won last year.
With Evans, who holds world
records in the 400-meter, 800-
meter and 1500-meter freestyles,
a few additional world-class fresh
men and a very strong returning
group, Stanford has been ranked
No. 1 all season long in the
coaches' poll.
And in addition to adjusting
naturally to collegiate swimming,
Evans found living at college less
complicated than expected. After
coming back from Seoul, she had
a parade in her honor, served as

the Grand Marshall of the Fiesta
Bowl and had reporters and fans
following her everywhere she
went. At Stanford, however, she's
just one of a handful of famous
students.
"It was fine," she said. "When
I first moved in, people on the
hall didn't say anything, which
was cool. Then a few days later,
I talked to them, and they said
they didn't want to bother me.
"They really care about my
swimming. My whole hall, just
about, is coming to the meet
(tomorrow). More than distrac
tions, I'd say it's a lot of support."
With that support, Evans and
her teammates have gotten off to
a 6-0 start in dual meets and have
yet to even be challenged. All that
should against No. 2 Texas
tomorrow at noon, however.
"We're all psyched to swim
Texas this weekend," she said.
The Longhorn Coach, Mark
Schubert, is apparently psyched
to swim against Stanford, too.
"I know that (Lady Longhorn
Coach) Mark (Schubert) is making
a big deal about it," Evans said.
"They're coming here Thursday,
and they're not swimming Cal
Friday. They're doing it Sunday.
They're going to be totally ready,
but we are too. I'm excited for
this meet."
Schubert also asked Quick to
remove the 400 individual medley
from the list of events swum. The
event has always been swum in
the Stanford-Texas dual meets,
but Schubert's protesting forced
the teams to follow the NCAAs
dual-meet schedule, which does

not include the 400 IM.
The significance is that Evan*
won one of her gold medals in
the 400-meter IM, junior Michelle
Griglione won the event for the
Cardinal at last year's NCAA
Championships and Stanford
sophomore Karen Kraemer took
filth in the event at NCAAs. Thus
Texas would probably get swept

world's top female swimmer, has made a smooth adjustment to
college swimming and academic life. She is currently No. 1 in the
world in two events.
were that event held.
But despite the high-level
politicking, Evans realizes it's still
only one meet. "It's a dual meet,"
she said. "It's a big dual meet,
but NCAAs are the big thing. But
I think it will give us a lot of
confidence going into NCAAs if
we swim well."
After the Texas meet, Stanford
swims a dual meet against Cali
fornia next week, then has the
Pacific 10 Conference and NCAA
Championship meets. After swim
ming for the fairly small Fullerton
Aquatics club team during the
past few years, Evans is excited
about going to NCAAs.
"Since I'm from a little team,
I always wanted to be on a big
team and have a chance to win,"
she said. "We're swimming really
well right now."
After getting back from the
1988 Olympics, where she won
three gold medals, Janet Evans
had a decision to make. She could
turn her fame into commercial
success by accepting any of several
endorsement offers, make hun
dreds of thousands of dollars and
be financially set for life.
On the other hand, she could
go to college, where she would
end up studying all the time, go
to swim practice 11 times a week
(year-round) and live the life of
a student.
Naturally, she chose the latter.
"If I had taken the endorse
ments, it would have meant quit
ting swimming," Evans said. "I
still thought I could go faster. Just
look at what I'd be missing out
on. It would have been like a job.
I was only 17."
After making that tough deci
sion, which she said took about a
week after coming back from the
Games, Evans found herself faced
with an even more complicated
decision. It seems that a lot of
collegiate swimming coaches
decided they would like to have
a world record holder on their
team, so the recruiting process
began.
"There were a lot of letters,"
Evans said. "It was hard saying
no to coaches. A lot of them would
send forms, and I just wouldn't
send it back, you know, hoping
