# Hoops not enough for two-sport star

### Michaela Sanchez 
A typical day for sophomore
Martha Richards has little in com
mon with that of a Stanford stu
dent. After she finishes practicing
with the Cardinal women's bas
ketball team, Richards doesn't
head off to class or back to her
dorm. Instead, she heads for the
golf course.
Richards, you see, is not only
an integral part of the No. 2-
ranked basketball team, she is
also a member of the varsity golf
squad. For the Hudson, Wis. na
tive, it seems only natural — she
has been around sports all her life.
She attributes her success to
her athletic family. "I was always
outside throwing a football
around with my older brothers.
When I was younger, my first
dream was to become the first
female quarterback in the NFL."
Her time and talents were
quickly transferred from football
to basketball when she began
playing in the second grade. She
continued to improve with the

help of her father, who is a high
school basketball coach, and her
older brothers.
The skills she developed at
tracted the attention of Stanford
women's basketball Coach Tara
VanDerveer as she watched nu
merous video tapes of high school
games and all-star basketball
camps where "the cream rises to
the top."
VanDerveer said Richards is im
pressive because "she has very
good skills and a sense of the
game. She understands what is
happening on the floor, is a quick
learner and is able to play differ
ent positions."
Her teammates have the same
amount of confidence and respect
for Richards' contributions.
Senior forward Katy Steding, who
plays against Richards in practice,
feels that "she has come a long
way this year." Guard Jennifer
Azzi adds that Richards has
"great skills" and that her pres
ence on the team "brightens your

day."
Another strong point is her ex
cellent shooting ability. A popular
quote of the basketball team is:
"Martha has never met a basket
she didn't like."
Her favorite shot is "The Run
ner," which she describes as a
"long-range layup where you go
off on one foot and look like you
are running while you are shoot

ing.
VanDerveer also feels that one
of Richards' best qualities is she
understands her role on the team.
"She accepts that she is not the
star of the team as she was in
high school. [Shel cares a lot about
teammates and is able to put the
team ahead of herself."
Richards said her role is simple
— "come in off the bench, relieve
Katy and Jen, play good defense,
rebound and take good shots." She
likes the fact the pressure to per
form is taken off. "I have to work
hard and contribute but no longer
have to score 80 points (like in
high school)."
During the school year, where
autumn and winter quarters are
totally devoted to basketball, one
would think that spring would be
a chance to relax and rest up for
the next season. For Richards,
this isn't possible because she will
begin competing for the golf team

had a great basketball
program, but golf was
the icing on the cake.'

in 1990. Last season, she partic
ipated as a redshirt.
She sees golf as a great change
from the pressures of playing on
a nationally-ranked basketball
team. In addition to being a nice
break from Maples Pavilion, play
ing golf is also an opportunity to
escape from everything else,
which is one of the many reasons
why she enjoys the game so much.
"Playing golf you have complete
control; it is just you out on the
field. You only have to take care
of yourself, and it doesn't matter
what everyone else is doing," she
said
Richards added she is not ex
actly sure how she became inter
ested in golf, since no one in her
family plays. She suggested she
may have developed a liking for
the sport from watching golf tour
naments on television.
She started playing for a local
junior program and was in
strumental in getting a golf pro
gram implemented at her high
school. The combination of these
activities and her natural athletic
ability culminated in her winning
the Wisconsin state golf tourna
ment her senior year.

It is these talents that women's
golf Coach Tim Baldwin sees when
he says: "Martha truly has the
potential to be one of the best
golfers ever to attend Stanford.
She practices hard and is a won
derful addition to the team."
He realizes basketball is her No.
1 priority and is willing to help
her be the best golfer she can be
during the off-season.
Her desire to try to play two
varsity sports in college was what
swung her decision to come here.
"It was between UCLA and Stan
ford, and when I looked at the
both schools, I really liked the
coaches [herel. I knew that Stan
ford had a great basketball pro
gram, but golf was the icing on
the cake."
For the average college student,
it is difficult enough to juggle
classes and activities, but for Ric
hards, her participation in two
varsity sports makes her happier.
"I do much better when 1 am busy.
If I had more time, I would waste
more time."
Right now, Martha is content
playing a backup position for one
of the best teams in the country
but, at the same time, is looking
toward the next couple of years
when she will be a more dominant
force for the Cardinal. After grad
uation, she hopes to play golf on
the pro tour.
Whatever she decides to do, it
can be assured that the ball will
be in her court.

VanDerveer also feels that one
of Richards' best qualities is she
understands her role on the team.
"She accepts that she is not the
star of the team as she was in
high school. [Shel cares a lot about
teammates and is able to put the
team ahead of herself."
Richards said her role is simple
— "come in off the bench, relieve
Katy and Jen, play good defense,
rebound and take good shots." She
likes the fact the pressure to per
form is taken off. "I have to work
hard and contribute but no longer
have to score 80 points (like in
high school)."
During the school year, where
autumn and winter quarters are
totally devoted to basketball, one
would think that spring would be
a chance to relax and rest up for
the next season. For Richards,

in 1990. Last season, she partic
ipated as a redshirt.
She sees golf as a great change
from the pressures of playing on
a nationally-ranked basketball
team. In addition to being a nice
break from Maples Pavilion, play
ing golf is also an opportunity to
escape from everything else,
which is one of the many reasons
why she enjoys the game so much.
"Playing golf you have complete
control; it is just you out on the
field. You only have to take care
of yourself, and it doesn't matter
what everyone else is doing," she
said
Richards added she is not ex
actly sure how she became inter
ested in golf, since no one in her
family plays. She suggested she
may have developed a liking for
the sport from watching golf tour
naments on television.
She started playing for a local
junior program and was in
strumental in getting a golf pro
gram implemented at her high
school. The combination of these
activities and her natural athletic
ability culminated in her winning
the Wisconsin state golf tourna
ment her senior year.

It is these talents that women's
golf Coach Tim Baldwin sees when
he says: "Martha truly has the
potential to be one of the best
golfers ever to attend Stanford.
She practices hard and is a won
derful addition to the team."
He realizes basketball is her No.
1 priority and is willing to help
her be the best golfer she can be
during the off-season.
Her desire to try to play two
varsity sports in college was what
swung her decision to come here.
"It was between UCLA and Stan
ford, and when I looked at the
both schools, I really liked the
coaches [herel. I knew that Stan
ford had a great basketball pro
gram, but golf was the icing on
the cake."
For the average college student,
it is difficult enough to juggle
classes and activities, but for Ric
hards, her participation in two
varsity sports makes her happier.
"I do much better when 1 am busy.
If I had more time, I would waste
more time."
Right now, Martha is content
playing a backup position for one
of the best teams in the country
but, at the same time, is looking
toward the next couple of years
when she will be a more dominant
force for the Cardinal. After grad
uation, she hopes to play golf on
the pro tour.
Whatever she decides to do, it
can be assured that the ball will
be in her court.
A typical day for sophomore
Martha Richards has little in com
mon with that of a Stanford stu
dent. After she finishes practicing
with the Cardinal women's bas
ketball team, Richards doesn't
head off to class or back to her
dorm. Instead, she heads for the
golf course.
Richards, you see, is not only
an integral part of the No. 2-
ranked basketball team, she is
also a member of the varsity golf
squad. For the Hudson, Wis. na
tive, it seems only natural — she
has been around sports all her life.
She attributes her success to
her athletic family. "I was always
outside throwing a football
around with my older brothers.
When I was younger, my first
dream was to become the first
female quarterback in the NFL."
Her time and talents were
quickly transferred from football
to basketball when she began
playing in the second grade. She
continued to improve with the

help of her father, who is a high
school basketball coach, and her
older brothers.
The skills she developed at
tracted the attention of Stanford
women's basketball Coach Tara
VanDerveer as she watched nu
merous video tapes of high school
games and all-star basketball
camps where "the cream rises to
the top."
VanDerveer said Richards is im
pressive because "she has very
good skills and a sense of the
game. She understands what is
happening on the floor, is a quick
learner and is able to play differ
ent positions."
Her teammates have the same
amount of confidence and respect
for Richards' contributions.
Senior forward Katy Steding, who
plays against Richards in practice,
