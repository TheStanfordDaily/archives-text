# Women netters to bite 'Dawgs

The Washington Huskies have the best wom
en's tennis team in the Northwest, according
to Stanford Coach Frank Brennan. But that's
not saying much.
The Huskies come to the Stanford Tennis
Stadium today unranked, a fact that does not
hold up well when you are playing the No. 1
team in the country and the defending national
champions.
"They are better than Washington State,
Oregon and Oregon State," Brennan said.
"They just built a new indoor center and are
working on an effort to keep kids in the state."
These are not exactly words of fear. Brennan
has said that he, like most coaches, schedule
matches that get progressively harder. This is
the team's second match. Stanford beat its
first opponent, Hawaii, 9-0.
Washington came to Stanford to play in the
Rolex regional in the fall and "were not a
force," according to Brennan. None of its
players were ranked, and except for one dou
bles team, not a single Husky made it past
the second round.
But the 1:30 match tomorrow will be good
for the team in ways that go beyond the win
loss column.
"This match gives the freshmen a chance
to get acclimated," Brennan said. "They get
a chance to play in front of their roommates
and get comfortable wearing the uniforms."
