# First Stanford seminar televised
## Engineers are cheering as 'double E' hits TV 
### Aaron Thode Staff writer 
Engineers across the country
achieved every student's dream:
watching TV and studying at the
same time.
For the first time in its 21-year
history, the Stanford University
Instructional Television Network
this week beamed a five-hour sem
inar via microwave over a satellite
network to various customers
across the nation.
For $900, an organization could
send its engineers to school for a
day to learn about "Integrated
Technology Modeling for IC Proc
ess and Device Design."
Electrical Engineering Profes
sors Robert Dutton, James Plum
mer and Andrew Neureuther gave
presentations on designing inte
grated circuits by using modern
computers and other technological
tools. They even answered ques

tions from their "audience" dur
ing a one-hour phone-in session.
Although network officials ex
pect to barely break even with the
project, they hope to present two
more "mini-courses" this year and
expand to six next year. The sem
inar topics have not yet been cho
sen.
At present, the network only
broadcasts on a local scale; never
theless, more than 170 corpora
tions subscribe to the service in
order to receive unedited lectures
from more than 250 engineering
classes at Stanford.
The network also ships licensed
videocassettes of these classes
across the United States and to
more than 20 countries. For three
years, the network has also piped
these classes over SUNet channels
36 through 39 for student use.
The network sees its seminar

project as beneficial to its custom
ers. The broadcasts are "a much
more cost-effective way of attend
ing a seminar, since travel costs
and time away from campus are
eliminated," noted network direc
tor Andy DiPaolo in an interview
with Stanford News Service.
"Our focus is on the corporate
student as well [as the Stanford
student]," said Sally Kiester, in
ternational program coordinator
for the network. The seminars are
"compressed versions of regular
courses, so professional engineers
can follow the newest develop
ments in their field."
The network can expand its of
ferings to companies by develop
ing the seminar program,
according to Carolyn Schultz, the
network's marketing services
manager. "Engineers, like doc
tors, need to continue their
education," she said.
