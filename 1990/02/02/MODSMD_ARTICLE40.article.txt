# Noriega invades . . .
## Men's tennis hosts San Diego 
### Greg Gottesman Editorial staff 
The best team in college tennis
faces its first real challenge to
morrow as No. 1 Stanford squares
off against No. 17 University of
San Diego in Stanford Tennis Sta
dium at 1 p.m.
"It should be a great match,"
Stanford Coach Richard Gould
said. "[San Diego] is returning
four of their top guys from last
year. They have a bona fide No.
1 player. They beat us a few years
ago. Besides that, they're ranked
17th. This match should give us
a better indication of where we
are [at this time in the year]."
San Diego's No. 1 player, Jose
Luis Noriega — no relation to the
deposed dictator, according to
Gould — walks onto the Farm
with especially impressive credi
tials. Noriega, ranked second in
the country by the Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate Rankings, plays on
Peru's Davis Cup team, won a

collegiate clay court tour
nament earlier in the season and
has lost to only a few select
players in college tennis this year.
To Noriega's dismay, however,
one of those select players wears
Cardinal red. Freshman Johna
than Stark, who is currently
ranked sixth in the Volvo stand
ings, edged Noriega 7-5, 7-6 in
the second round of the Volvo
All-American Tournament in
Georgia last October.
"[Noriega's] No. 2 right now
and won a clay court tour
nament earlier in the year, so I'm
really excited to get a chance to
play him again," Stark said. "I
will need to serve well, be consis
tent [from the baseline] and also
attack a lot."
Junior Alex O'Brien probably
will be moved up to the No. 2
spot for Saturday's match, with
Jeff Cathrall, Glenn Solomon,
Alexis Hombrecher and Jason Yee
following in that order.
"This match could reallv set the

tone for the rest of the year,"
Solomon said. "San Diego is a
good team. A win could definitely
put us in an upward spiral."
