# Tough L.A. meets await swimmers
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
Southern California brings a
string of tourist images to mind,
ranging from the over-priced
studio-tours of Hollywood, to the
crowded beaches of Malibu, to the
electric parades at Disneyland.
Thoughts of Los Angeles for the
Stanford men's swimming team,
on the other hand, bring two very
different images: the UCLA Men's
Gym Pool and the USC
McDonald's Olympic Swim Pool.
This weekend the Cardinal
112 .'am, ranked No. 3 in the coaches'
j. ill with a 5-1 record, travels
south to participate in two of the
most important dual meets of its
season. Instead of waking up and
hitting all the tourist spots this
morning, the Cardinal jumped
into the Gym Pool at 8 a.m. to
get used to the water before its
1 p.m. meet against the Bruins.
Saturday, Stanford will go
through a similar routine before
challenging USC at noon.
"Traditionally, this is just a

great weekend," senior co-captain
Rick Gould said. "These are al
ways three of the fastest teams
in the country."
UCLA, ranked No. 8, brings a
strong dual meet squad into
today's competition. The Bruins
upset Michigan 58-55, a team
Stanford lost to 61-52 earlier this
season, and have compiled a 6-2
record. Although they will not

have the team strength to com
pete with Stanford at NCAAs, the
Bruins have enough strong swim
mers that the meet will most
likely come down to the high-point
relays.
"It will definitely be a tough
meet," Gould said. "They always
get up to swim really fast against
us."
The Cardinal swimmers have
an extra incentive in this trip to
UCLA. In 1988, the last time
Stanford competed at the Gym
Pool, the Cardinal lost the meet
in the final relay. According to
Gould, a Bruin B-relay team
splashed water and created waves
in the lanes of the Cardinal A
relay team. UCI.A pulled ahead
on the relay and won the meet
by one point.
"We have a little bit of revenge
factor against UCLA," Gould said.
"The splashing kind of stirred up
a little bit of animosity in us
towards them. It would be real
nice to beat them in L.A."
After finishing today's meet,
the Cardinal squad must find a
way to bring its competitive level
up a notch. USC, ranked No. 2,
has been chosen in various na
tional magazines, along with
Stanford and Texas, to be in
contention for the national title.
The Trojans have compiled a 7-0
record so far this season, includ
ing a victory over Michigan.
Former Olympian Dan Jorgen
son leads the Trojan swimmers.
Jorgenson will line up against
Cardinal senior John Witchel, who
holds Cardinal standards in both
the 200 and 500 freestyle. Witchel
recorded a 1:37.8 in the 200,
faster than Jorgenson's best, but
Jorgenson has a 4.25.32 in the
500, better than Witchel's quick
est finish.
