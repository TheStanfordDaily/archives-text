# Swimming at UCLA, USC
## 
### 
TODAY — 1 p.m. at UCLA's Men's
Gym Pool
SATURDAY noon at USC's
McDonald's Olympic Swim Sta
dium.
RECORDS - Stanford (5-1, 2-0 in
Pac-10 competition), UCLA (6-2,
0-0), USC (7-0, 0-0),
NOTES — The men's swim team
will find winning difficult in Los
Angeles, But because Stanford's
dual meet record does not play
a role in determing NCAA
qualifiers, both meets are impor
tant but not essential for the Car
dinal to win.
