# Freshman gymnast makes big splash
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Springing from the diving board
to the trampoline, Jair Lynch has
already bounded to the forefront
of the collegiate gymnastics world.
With his dynamic performances,
the Stanford freshman from
Washington, D.C. has proved his
change of sports a wise one.
A talented swimmer and diver
in his youth, Lynch began taking
gymnastic classes at age eight and
quickly displayed great potential
in the sport.
"I always received a lot of en
couragement and support to stick
with it,"he said. "1 also had some
very good coaches who taught me
the basics."
By the time Lynch entered high
school, his perserverance was be
ginning to pay off. During his
sophomore year in high school, he
was a contender for the Junior
National team but "blew it" be
cause he was trying more difficult
tricks than the other competitors.

Refusing to give up, he contin
ued to train for the subsequent
year's meet. He was rewarded
with an all-around win in the op
tional division, making him the
top junior gymnast in the country
at age 16.
He describes this as one of the
highlights of his career. Being a
part of the national team gave
him the opportunity to travel to
Spain, Sweden and France for

competitions. He qualified for the
team again during his senior year,
which attracted the attention of
many college recruiters.
Although he was widely
recruited, Lynch was able to nar
row his choices down to UCLA,
Illinois and Stanford. The factor
that made Stanford emerge as his
number one choice was discovered
during his recruiting trip here. "I
really liked the combination of
[assistant coach) Tong Fei and
Sadao [Hamada]. That was prob
ably what made me want to come
here the most."
Coach Hamada was also im
pressed with Lynch. "Jair is the
most talented gymnast I've ever
had," he said, "and talent does
not just mean being able to do
skills. It includes having a good
attitude, body type and
flexibility."
In his first two collegiate meets
Lynch has shown great potential,
especially in the parallel bars and
pommel horse. Last Saturday

against UC-Santa Barbara, he
won the pommel horse with a
meet-high score of 9.75 (out of
10). "Jair proved that he can
definitely be an NCAA contender,"
senior co-captain Conrad
Voorsanger said.
Lynch's goals for this season
match his potential. He hopes to
win a spot on the 18-and-over na
tional team by finishing in the
top twelve at this year's USA
Championships, the meet sopho
more Tim Ryan won last year.
According to Lynch, if he should
make the team, Stanford would
be the first school to put a fresh
man on the national team two
years in a row.
As a longer-term goal, Lynch is
also setting his sights on the 1992
Olympics. For now, however, he
is just happy to contribute to the
Cardinal. Hamada is certainly
glad to have his advanced talents.
"One thing about Jair is that
he is very exciting to watch," he
said.
