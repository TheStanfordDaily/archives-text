# Women gymnasts look to cool Sun Devils
## 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
If all goes well for the Stanford
women's gymnastics team this
weekend, Coach Breck Greenwood
will be sporting a new hairstyle
on Monday.
At the beginning of the season,
Greenwood offered the team a
challenge in order to add a bit
more motivation to the team's
goal of going to the NCAAs in
April. He told them that if they
beat a team ranked in the top 12
in the nation — the number of
teams which go to the NCAAs —
he would shave his head. When
top-10 Arizona State joins Stan

ford and New Mexico at Burnham
Pavilion Sunday, the gymnasts
will get their chance.
The upset effort will be
bolstered by the addition of diffi
culty to several of the routines
for this competition. Greenwood
expressed quiet optimism. "We're
certainly going to try to win the
meet," he said. "If we hit our
routines, we ought to be able to
at least give them a run for their
money."
Dina Amoroso will add more
difficulty to the floor exercise
routine that earned her a score
of 9.5 in the home opener last
week. In addition, Danielle Leone
will add an element to her bar

routine that could raise her score
four-tenths of a point and Jen
Bloom may perform a new bar
routine.
The lineup will remain largely
the same as that for the home
opener. The biggest change will
be the addition of sophomore
Shira Wohlberg, who will be
making her season debut for the
Cardinal as she joins the vault
team.
"I'm excited-to finally be able
to compete," Wohlberg said. "It
has been tough just sitting and
watching at the meets."
Sophomore Nicki Kobrine is
also new to the vault team since
Friday's meet. She earned a spot
in the lineup by virtue of a 9.2-
point peformance at California
Sunday.
Senior Susan Banta can be ex
pected to make her usual strong
contribution to the Cardinal ef
fort. She will compete in vault,
bars and floor exercise after rest

ing a sore foot at Cal, where she
competed only on bars. "It was
hard to sit back and watch the
team on Sunday," Banta said. "It
was very frustrating."
These comments are indicative
of the way Banta views her posi
tion as co-captain. "She feels that
she has a job to perform, and she
takes the role of captain serious
ly," Greenwood said. "She works
very hard and sets a good example
for the rest of the team. She really
leads by example."
