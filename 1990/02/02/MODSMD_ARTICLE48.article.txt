# Track travels world
## Card competes down South, Down Under 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and
women's track teams are plan
ning to get a jump on the new
season tomorrow, and they're
racing for the NCAAs already.
Seventeen men and women will
be competing on several tracks
around the world, including at
such exotic locales as South
Bend, Ind., Louisiana State
University and Australia.
Australia? The land of back
ward seasons, professional
midget throwing and Andrew
Vlahov?
Yep. The lone Cardinal
"Down Under" is David Strang,
representing Scotland in the
British Commonwealth Games.
Strang just missed the finals
of the men's 800-meter race
last Wednesday and is expected
to run a leg in the 1600-meter
relay this weekend.
Meanwhile, "down South" in
Baton Rouge, 11 Cardinal will
be running on LSU's vaunted
indoor track. Their objectives:
to acquire experience in the
competitive arena and to
qualify for the NCAA Indoor
Nationals.
Asst. Track Coach Scott
Chisam named several athletes
who appear particularly well
positioned to make the NCAA
cuts on the Tigers' turf. Among
them is Christie Gaines, the
fastest woman sprinter in Stan
ford's history. She holds the
school record in the 50-meter
dash and will test her stride
in the 55-meters tomorrow.
Rhonda Oliver and Marcus
Hickerson will both run the

400-meters. Oliver holds the
school record in that event.
Hickerson also will compete in
the long jump. Peggy Odita will
gun for speed and height in
the hurdles and high jump, and
Debby Maleug will push for dis
tance in the shot put.
At the same time, "back
East" in Hoosierland, five Car
dinal tracksters will try to run
and jump their way to victory
in an indoor meet at Notre
Dame. They include Jamie
Marek in the pole vault, Brian
Schultz in the 55-meters and
Jim Cram ton in the 400-meter
race.
Alex Acceta will be trying
make the NCAA Indoor quali
fying time in the 800 meters.
Finally, Bill Crowley will at
tempt to beat the NCAA Indoor
qualifying time of 4:02 in the
mile. For Crowley, who is also
a successful cross-country run
ner, the mile should seem like
a short sprint.
The first outdoor team com
petition for the Cardinal this
year will not be for several
weeks, but the team already
knows its primary goals for the
season: "Beat Cal" and "finish
in the top five of the Pac-10,"
in Chisam's words.
