# Married life suits Card wrestler

### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
When Ron Perry made up his
mind to wrestle at Stanford, he
made even a bigger decision at
the same time. He decided to
marry Julie Bush.
The two became high school
sweethearts at Areata High School
when Ron was a freshman and
Julie was a sophomore. Ron said,
"We lived a tenth of a mile apart,
and we never met each other until
high school."
They dated for four years and
decided to get engaged when Ron
was preparing to leave Areata to
come to school at Stanford. Ron
surprised some people when they
found out he was engaged as a
college freshman. "Everybody
looked at me in disbelief at the
fact that I was engaged," Perry
said. "By the end of the year,
everyone was going 'my gosh, he's
serious about this.' "
Ron and Julie were very serious
about their plans for marriage.
Because wrestling is a non
scholarship sport at Stanford, the
couple has to think of ways to
finance the part of Ron's educa
tion which is not covered by ac
ademic scholarships. Julie works
as a medical secretary in Palo
Alto, and in the off-season, Ron
gets a temporary job.
However, married life has been

kinder to the Perrys than they
expected.
"Everyone gives you those hor
ror stories before you're getting
married the last three or four
months â€” telling you this is going
to go wrong and this is not going
to happen. None of those things
have occurred, so here we are two
years later," Ron said.
After two years, marriage is
working out well for the Perrys,
but not everything is easy. "I
think the hardest part is being in
an area where everyone is so
career-oriented," Julie said.
"Everyone kind of looks at you
like you've got two heads."
Ron and Julie have been to
gether for a long time. Four years
of dating and two years of mar
riage could lead to a stale life for
many couples, but the Perrys are

'He's got such a dif
ferent personality
when he gets out
there.'

different. "We have more fun now
than we did when we were
dating," Julie said.
Not only is Julie a good wife,
but she also helps Ron with his
wrestling. "I found if I have been
wrestling poorly, then she
analyzes my wrestling extremely
well, not so much the technical
aspect of it, but more the mental
and psychological part of it," Ron
said.
What's it like for Julie to see
Ron wrestle? "It's funny for me
to sit in the stands and watch
because he gets this scowl on his
face, and you never see it any
place else," she said. "He's got
such a different personality when
he gets out there. It's the only
time you see his mean face."
The most striking characteristic
of the Perry relationship is that
the two do not act as if they are
married. One does not expect a
married couple to go to Senior
Pub Nights or to the Viennese
Ball. The Perrys do.
