# Profs swallow bait in great catfish debate
## Jackson, Perry argue fish's merit 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer 
Amidst frenzied forensic flip
flops that left fish lovers floun
dering, two Stanford professors
opened up a can of worms in a
debate held last night during
"Two Weeks of Fun and Con
tention" at Branner Hall.
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell
Jackson, Branner's resident fel
low, argued that "the catfish is
one of nature's most ignoble
creatures and should not be
eaten." Philosophy Prof. John
Perry argued for the kindly char
acter and culinary charisma of
the catfish.
"I'm downright bothered by
the catfish as a creature in na
ture, and more particularly, I'm
upset by it as a food," said Jack
son. He then proceeded to vilify
the vicious vertebrate, asserting
that the catfish is "a misbegot
ten creature not in the least
favored of nature."
According to Jackson, the cat
fish is "extremely ugly." When
the fish is served in restaurants,
he said, "even though it's gar
nished, it still maintains its rude
ugliness on the plate."
Aesthetic arguments aside,
though, the eminent historian
pointed out that the Ictalurus
furcatus is a bottom-feeding fish
which scavenges its food from
the beds of lakes and streams.
Jackson intimated that catfish
might be contaminated by dan
gerous pollutants corrupting the
nation's waterways: "Eat them
aplenty today and worry about

'I'm downright
bothered by the
catfish as a crea
ture in nature, and
more particularly,
I'm upset by it as
a food.'

mercury in your liver tomor
row."
Jackson said catfish also use
their poisonous spiny fins to in
tentionally inflict pain and suf
fering on soft-skinned humans.
Apparently, a public relations
officer at a Mississippi fish farm
told him the catfish must first
be stunned by an electric current
before handlers wearing "cotton
gloves over an iron mesh" can
clean the catfish "without being
snagged with its fins."
Following Jackson's exten
sively-researched presentation.
Perry gave an emotional appeal
on behalf of the maligned mon
ster. "The catfish has done a lot
for me, and I'm here to defend
it against this scurrilous attack."
Perry then related a quaint
family anecdote from his own
personal experiences to prove
that any fool can catch a catfish.
After a luckless day of fishing
for trout and bass, Perry — who
feared he would lose the respect
of his 5-year-old son — success

fully landed a catfish.
"I looked like something out
of a cigarette ad from 'Field and
Stream,' " Perry said.
In addition to the ego boost
that catfish provide to otherwise
inept fishermen, Perry also
pointed out that the fish are a
good source of protein and could
be cheaply raised almost

anywhere to help solve the
world's protein shortage.
"Here at Stanford we could
take some useless spot of
ground, like History Corner, and
raise catfish," Perry said.
Perry implied the vital role of
catfish in the cyclical saga of
human existence by showing the
audi#*nce a slide of his grandson.
