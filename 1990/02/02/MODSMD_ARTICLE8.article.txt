# Speaker selection process questioned
## 
### Chris Roblyer 
The selection of Marian Wright
Edelman as Stanford's 99th Com
mencement speaker has sparked
criticism of her suitability as a
speaker, but members of the com
mittee that selected her are
defending the choice.
Edelman, president of the
Children's Defense Fund, was rec
ommended "because of her lead
ership role in addressing the
problems facing children, particu
larly the underprivileged," accord
ing to Marlene Wine, special
assistant to the president, who co
chaired this year's selection panel.
Edelman attended Yale Law
School and has had a long history
of public service, civil rights and
human rights activism. However,
some seniors believe that the se
lection process ignores their
wishes and that, regardless of her
background, Edelman is an inap
propriate Commencement speaker
for Stanford.
In a Wednesday letter to The
Daily concerning the selection of
Edelman, two seniors, James
Turo and Ziad Sarkis, leveled two
primary criticisms against her se
lection.
First, her relative lack of fame
should have invalidated her as a
prospective speaker, according to

Turo and Sarkis. Turo noted that
"her international and national
renown are limited." Although
they agree that Edelman has dis
tinguished herself in public serv
ice, they believe she has only
nominal name recognition.
In response to this criticism,
Michael Roark, a senior class pres
ident who was on the selection
committee, said, "Whom are you
trying to impress?" According to
Roark, "Anyone who is politically
conscious should know about
Marian Edelman."
Senior Anne Truitt also dis
counted the importance of name
recognition. "I don't care who it
is as long as they give a good
speech," she said.
"I think we need to determine
what we want in a Commence
ment speaker. If that turns out
to be fame, Edelman probably
leaves something to be desired in
the eyes of many," said Jae Choi,
a fifth-year coterminal student.
Sandy Risser, an assistant to
the vice president for public af
fairs and member of the selection
panel, said she thought "fame
should not be an issue." The pri
mary criteria, according to Risser,
is to pick a "serious and dignified"
speaker.
Apart from the issue of fame,
Turo and Sarkis questioned the

motivation be
hind the selection
of Edelman.
Sarkis asserted
that "her selec
tion and the fact
that she is a
liberal black
woman are not
independent."
Her selection was

a case of "affirmative action," the
two said.
Sarkis believes that Edelman
was chosen not because of her
public service, but because she fits
into the mold of multiculturalism
and liberalism to which he con
siders the University committed.
Turo said that "a conservative
speaker wouldn't even get into the
prospective speaker pool."
The presidents and selection
panel maintain that Edelman was
chosen because she is a dynamic
speaker and has a very impressive
public record.
In a letter to The Daily yester
day, Catherine Milton, director of
the Haas Center for Public Serv
ice, said that "neither the color
of [Edelman's] skin nor her
gender were factors."
Milton went on to say that Edel
man was chosen because of "the
quality of her work, her leader
ship as an advocate for the

children and her ability to in
spire," noting that organizers of
the past three You Can Make a
Difference conferences have tried
unsuccessfully to bring Edelman
here to speak.
The fact that Edelman over
came discrimination on the basis
of her sex and her race should be
viewed as positive qualities that
better allow her to deliver a mean
ingful message, according to Pat
Devine, another of the presidents.
Edelman is only the fourth
woman and the first black woman
to speak at a Stanford Commence
ment.
"I think it's about time a
woman has spoken at gradua
tion," said senior Cathy Belcher.
Some seniors nevertheless feel
there are problems with the
speaker selection process. Belcher
said she thinks "the selection
process needs more direct involve
ment of seniors." Under the
current system, only two seniors,
are on the selection panel.
The panel comes up with six
prospective speakers and advises
University President Donald Ken
nedy on each. Kennedy makes the
final choice.
Although senior input was
solicited through ads in The Daily
and fliers, only 100 responses
were received.

ership role in addressing the
problems facing children, particu
larly the underprivileged," accord
ing to Marlene Wine, special
assistant to the president, who co
chaired this year's selection panel.
Edelman attended Yale Law
School and has had a long history
of public service, civil rights and
human rights activism. However,
some seniors believe that the se
lection process ignores their
wishes and that, regardless of her
background, Edelman is an inap
propriate Commencement speaker
for Stanford.
In a Wednesday letter to The
Daily concerning the selection of
Edelman, two seniors, James
Turo and Ziad Sarkis, leveled two
primary criticisms against her se
lection.
First, her relative lack of fame
should have invalidated her as a
prospective speaker, according to

Turo and Sarkis. Turo noted that
"her international and national
renown are limited." Although
they agree that Edelman has dis
tinguished herself in public serv
ice, they believe she has only
nominal name recognition.
In response to this criticism,
Michael Roark, a senior class pres
ident who was on the selection
committee, said, "Whom are you
trying to impress?" According to
Roark, "Anyone who is politically
conscious should know about
Marian Edelman."
Senior Anne Truitt also dis
counted the importance of name
recognition. "I don't care who it
is as long as they give a good
speech," she said.
"I think we need to determine
what we want in a Commence
ment speaker. If that turns out
to be fame, Edelman probably
leaves something to be desired in
the eyes of many," said Jae Choi,
a fifth-year coterminal student.
Sandy Risser, an assistant to
the vice president for public af
fairs and member of the selection
panel, said she thought "fame
should not be an issue." The pri
mary criteria, according to Risser,
is to pick a "serious and dignified"
speaker.
Apart from the issue of fame,
Turo and Sarkis questioned the

motivation be
hind the selection
of Edelman.
Sarkis asserted
that "her selec
tion and the fact
that she is a
liberal black
woman are not
independent."
Her selection was

a case of "affirmative action," the
two said.
Sarkis believes that Edelman
was chosen not because of her
public service, but because she fits
into the mold of multiculturalism
and liberalism to which he con
siders the University committed.
Turo said that "a conservative
speaker wouldn't even get into the
prospective speaker pool."
The presidents and selection
panel maintain that Edelman was
chosen because she is a dynamic
speaker and has a very impressive
public record.
In a letter to The Daily yester
day, Catherine Milton, director of
the Haas Center for Public Serv
ice, said that "neither the color
of [Edelman's] skin nor her
gender were factors."
Milton went on to say that Edel
man was chosen because of "the
quality of her work, her leader
ship as an advocate for the

children and her ability to in
spire," noting that organizers of
the past three You Can Make a
Difference conferences have tried
unsuccessfully to bring Edelman
here to speak.
The fact that Edelman over
came discrimination on the basis
of her sex and her race should be
viewed as positive qualities that
better allow her to deliver a mean
ingful message, according to Pat
Devine, another of the presidents.
Edelman is only the fourth
woman and the first black woman
to speak at a Stanford Commence
ment.
"I think it's about time a
woman has spoken at gradua
tion," said senior Cathy Belcher.
Some seniors nevertheless feel
there are problems with the
speaker selection process. Belcher
said she thinks "the selection
process needs more direct involve
ment of seniors." Under the
current system, only two seniors,
are on the selection panel.
The panel comes up with six
prospective speakers and advises
University President Donald Ken
nedy on each. Kennedy makes the
final choice.
Although senior input was
solicited through ads in The Daily
and fliers, only 100 responses
were received.
