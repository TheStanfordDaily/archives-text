Asian groups will
celebrate New Year
The newly-formed Stanford
Asian/Pacific American Alumni
Club has recently announced
plans for a $15,000 Asian
American Resource Center to
be established in the Asian
American Activities Center.
Emory Lee, a member of the
Class of 1959 and president of
the club, said the club wants
to create a center which could
house Asian-American books,
videos, newspapers, magazines,
student research and resource
materials. "We wanted to ben
efit as many students as pos
sible in a short amount of
time," he said.
Rick Yuen, assistant dean of
Student Affairs and director of
the activities center, said that
"what is needed is more schol
arship and understanding of
Asian-Americans." He said he
believed the center will be a
great resource for all students
researching Asian-Americans
because the materials will be
gathered in one place.
The alumni club was char
tered last spring to build a

strong network among Asian-
American alumni and to serve
as a resource for Asian-
American students on campus,
according to Lee.
Lee said once the organiza
tion "grows and matures,"
some long-term goals might in
clude an endowment fund for
Asian-American students.
The club's first steps towards
meeting both their short-term
and long-term goals will take
place this Saturday at 7:30
p.m., as they host a reception
of alumni at Ricker Dining and
Performance Center to raise
funds for the proposed resource
center.
The "Adopt-a-Book" recep
tion will be one of many pro
grams the Asian-American
community will hold this Sat
urday to celebrate the Lunar
New Year.
While it officially became the
year of the horse last Saturday,
the community is celebrating
this Saturday, with festivities
including a cross-campus lion
dance starting from Okada
House at 8 p.m. and a cultural
performance by students at
8:30 p.m. in Ricker.
