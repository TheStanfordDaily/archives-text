# Leland Stanford: His vision of labor made its Marx
## 
### Lena Slachmuijlder Staff writer 
Railroad "robber baron" Leland Stan
ford may not have been such a money
grubbing capitalist after all.
On the contrary, Stanford had a vision
of replacing capitalism with worker
owned cooperatives, according to an ar
ticle to be published in the Stanford
Historical Society's quarterly journal
Sandstone and Tile.
This vision of cooperative labor was
also the main underlying principle in
the founding of Stanford University, ac
cording to the author of the article, Lee
Altenberg, a postdoctoral student at
Duke University who received his Ph.D.
in biological sciences from Stanford.

Drawing from Stanford's writings,
speeches and legislation introduced to
the Senate, the author reveals a firm,
consistent commitment to the promotion
of cooperatives in labor relations, wom
en's rights and education.
Nobody has ever written so compre
hensive an article on Stanford's cooper
ative vision, according to Maggie
Kimball, acting University archivist.
As a U.S. senator, Stanford wrote
several bills designed to promote worker
cooperatives. In a newspaper interview
in 1887, Stanford said, "I have always
been fully persuaded that, through
cooperation, labor could become its own
employer."
Stanford predicted that growing cap
ital accumulations would subordinate

labor, and he aimed to halt the
monopolization of capital through the
promotion of cooperative associations,
according to Altenberg.
Stanford's bills attempted to legalize
the creation of worker cooperatives
which would secure their own wages
and exercise influence over the labor
market, thus reducing unemployment.
He predicted that more worker self
management would not only be more
productive, but would also yield a larger
pool of people able to organize their own
business ventures.
Stanford also fought for his land-loan
bill, designed to overcome the problem
atic lack of access to capital by farmers
through issuing currency based on
agricultural land value.

Stanford told Congress in 1892, "With
an abundance of money, unskilled
laborers, mechanics and other
workingmen will be able to carry on
cooperative societies because they will
be able to obtain the credit they deserve,
and even if employed by capital, all cause
for dissension between employed and
employer will be removed, as coopera
tion will regulate the price of labor and
be its perfect defense against inadequate
compensation."
Although neither of Stanford's bills
ever reached a vote on the Senate floor,
they reflected so strong a commitment
to the transformation of industrial pro
duction and ownership away from a cor
porate framework that he was
eventually ousted as president of the

Southern Pacific Railroad, writes A 1 ten
berg.
In the article, he notes that Stanford's
notions of cooperation sought to benefit
women as well. Stanford believed that
cooperatives, due to their intrinsically
democratic nature, would allow for more
business opportunities for women on all
levels, while also protecting them from
exploitation and providing them with
special benefits such as maternity leave.
In founding the University, Stanford
aimed to "produce in the minds of the
laboring classes the same facility for
combining their labor that exists in the
minds of capitalists," according to one
biography of Stanford. This would elim-
inate the dependency of the
laborer on the capitalist, Stanford
believed, and lead to a more
humane system of production.
Stanford reiterated this point
to the first class of Stanford stu
dents in 1891, when he said during
Opening Exercises, "We have also
provided that the benefits result
ing from cooperation shall be
freely taught. . . . Cooperative
societies bring forth the best ca
pacities, the best influences of the
individual for the benefit of the
whole, while the good influences
of the many aid the individual."
Altenberg notes that a course
about cooperative history and in
fluence was included in the first
year of the University's course
catalog, but not afterward. Alten
berg also writes that Stanford,
despite his visions of cooperatives,
"missed the opportunity to forge
such a connection when he failed
to establish the University itself
under a cooperative model."
"It's so thoroughly forgotten —
that's what makes it interesting,"
Altenberg said in an interview
with The Daily. Altenberg was in
troduced to Leland Stanford's co
operative vision while doing
research for a mini-course on co
operatives that he taught at the
University in fall 1986.
Altenberg primarily used re
sources available at the Stanford
University Archives, in addition
to several biographies of Stanford,
to construct his article. He said
that although the papers have al
ways been available to the public,

Cooperative living,
it turns out, was 'at
the foundation of
the University.'

this aspect of Leland Stanford has
been blocked out of the historical
writings of the man and his
founding intentions for the Uni
versity.
"The more I looked, the more
I found," said Altenberg, who
hopes, particularly in light of the
Centennial Campaign, "that it will
be acknowledged as part of the
University's lore about itself."
Altenberg, who was a resident
and eating associate at the
Columbae and Synergy co-ops on
campus, views Stanford's uncov
ered ideals as relevant to the co-op
community at Stanford.
"The co-ops have always felt
like they were struggling for
legitimacy, with the only valida
tion for themselves coming from
the inside," said Altenberg. "Now
it turns out that it was at the
foundation of the University."
When the first draft of his ar
ticle was completed in 1987, Al
tenberg was unable to get it
published. It was rejected by Stan
ford Magazine, In Writing, The
Daily and Campus Report. After
several revisions, Sandstone and
Tile editor Harry Press agreed to
publish it in the upcoming edition
of the journal, which will appear
within two weeks.

cooperatives, due to their intrinsically
democratic nature, would allow for more
business opportunities for women on all
levels, while also protecting them from
exploitation and providing them with
special benefits such as maternity leave.
In founding the University, Stanford
aimed to "produce in the minds of the
laboring classes the same facility for
combining their labor that exists in the
minds of capitalists," according to one
biography of Stanford. This would elim-
inate the dependency of the
laborer on the capitalist, Stanford
believed, and lead to a more
humane system of production.
Stanford reiterated this point
to the first class of Stanford stu
dents in 1891, when he said during
Opening Exercises, "We have also
provided that the benefits result
ing from cooperation shall be
freely taught. . . . Cooperative
societies bring forth the best ca
pacities, the best influences of the
individual for the benefit of the
whole, while the good influences
of the many aid the individual."
Altenberg notes that a course
about cooperative history and in
fluence was included in the first
year of the University's course
catalog, but not afterward. Alten
berg also writes that Stanford,
despite his visions of cooperatives,
"missed the opportunity to forge
such a connection when he failed
to establish the University itself
under a cooperative model."
"It's so thoroughly forgotten —
that's what makes it interesting,"
Altenberg said in an interview
with The Daily. Altenberg was in
troduced to Leland Stanford's co
operative vision while doing
research for a mini-course on co
operatives that he taught at the
University in fall 1986.
Altenberg primarily used re
sources available at the Stanford
University Archives, in addition
to several biographies of Stanford,
to construct his article. He said
that although the papers have al
ways been available to the public,

Cooperative living,
it turns out, was 'at
the foundation of
the University.'

this aspect of Leland Stanford has
been blocked out of the historical
writings of the man and his
founding intentions for the Uni
versity.
"The more I looked, the more
I found," said Altenberg, who
hopes, particularly in light of the
Centennial Campaign, "that it will
be acknowledged as part of the
University's lore about itself."
Altenberg, who was a resident
and eating associate at the
Columbae and Synergy co-ops on
campus, views Stanford's uncov
ered ideals as relevant to the co-op
community at Stanford.
"The co-ops have always felt
like they were struggling for
legitimacy, with the only valida
tion for themselves coming from
the inside," said Altenberg. "Now
it turns out that it was at the
foundation of the University."
When the first draft of his ar
ticle was completed in 1987, Al
tenberg was unable to get it
published. It was rejected by Stan
ford Magazine, In Writing, The
Daily and Campus Report. After
several revisions, Sandstone and
Tile editor Harry Press agreed to
publish it in the upcoming edition
of the journal, which will appear
within two weeks.

Railroad "robber baron" Leland Stan
ford may not have been such a money
grubbing capitalist after all.
On the contrary, Stanford had a vision
of replacing capitalism with worker
owned cooperatives, according to an ar
ticle to be published in the Stanford
Historical Society's quarterly journal
Sandstone and Tile.
This vision of cooperative labor was
also the main underlying principle in
the founding of Stanford University, ac
cording to the author of the article, Lee
Altenberg, a postdoctoral student at
Duke University who received his Ph.D.
in biological sciences from Stanford.

Drawing from Stanford's writings,
speeches and legislation introduced to
the Senate, the author reveals a firm,
consistent commitment to the promotion
of cooperatives in labor relations, wom
en's rights and education.
Nobody has ever written so compre
hensive an article on Stanford's cooper
ative vision, according to Maggie
Kimball, acting University archivist.
As a U.S. senator, Stanford wrote
several bills designed to promote worker
cooperatives. In a newspaper interview
in 1887, Stanford said, "I have always
been fully persuaded that, through
cooperation, labor could become its own
employer."
Stanford predicted that growing cap
ital accumulations would subordinate

labor, and he aimed to halt the
monopolization of capital through the
promotion of cooperative associations,
according to Altenberg.
Stanford's bills attempted to legalize
the creation of worker cooperatives
which would secure their own wages
and exercise influence over the labor
market, thus reducing unemployment.
He predicted that more worker self
management would not only be more
productive, but would also yield a larger
pool of people able to organize their own
business ventures.
Stanford also fought for his land-loan
bill, designed to overcome the problem
atic lack of access to capital by farmers
through issuing currency based on
agricultural land value.

Stanford told Congress in 1892, "With
an abundance of money, unskilled
laborers, mechanics and other
workingmen will be able to carry on
cooperative societies because they will
be able to obtain the credit they deserve,
and even if employed by capital, all cause
for dissension between employed and
employer will be removed, as coopera
tion will regulate the price of labor and
be its perfect defense against inadequate
compensation."
Although neither of Stanford's bills
ever reached a vote on the Senate floor,
they reflected so strong a commitment
to the transformation of industrial pro
duction and ownership away from a cor
porate framework that he was
eventually ousted as president of the

Southern Pacific Railroad, writes A 1 ten
berg.
