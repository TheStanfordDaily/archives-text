# Leland Stanford: His vision of labor made its Marx

Railroad "robber baron" Leland Stan
ford may not have been such a money
grubbing capitalist after all.
On the contrary, Stanford had a vision
of replacing capitalism with worker
owned cooperatives, according to an ar
ticle to be published in the Stanford
Historical Society's quarterly journal
Sandstone and Tile.
This vision of cooperative labor was
also the main underlying principle in
the founding of Stanford University, ac
cording to the author of the article, Lee
Altenberg, a postdoctoral student at
Duke University who received his Ph.D.
in biological sciences from Stanford.

Drawing from Stanford's writings,
speeches and legislation introduced to
the Senate, the author reveals a firm,
consistent commitment to the promotion
of cooperatives in labor relations, wom
en's rights and education.
Nobody has ever written so compre
hensive an article on Stanford's cooper
ative vision, according to Maggie
Kimball, acting University archivist.
As a U.S. senator, Stanford wrote
several bills designed to promote worker
cooperatives. In a newspaper interview
in 1887, Stanford said, "I have always
been fully persuaded that, through
cooperation, labor could become its own
employer."
Stanford predicted that growing cap
ital accumulations would subordinate

labor, and he aimed to halt the
monopolization of capital through the
promotion of cooperative associations,
according to Altenberg.
Stanford's bills attempted to legalize
the creation of worker cooperatives
which would secure their own wages
and exercise influence over the labor
market, thus reducing unemployment.
He predicted that more worker self
management would not only be more
productive, but would also yield a larger
pool of people able to organize their own
business ventures.
Stanford also fought for his land-loan
bill, designed to overcome the problem
atic lack of access to capital by farmers
through issuing currency based on
agricultural land value.

Stanford told Congress in 1892, "With
an abundance of money, unskilled
laborers, mechanics and other
workingmen will be able to carry on
cooperative societies because they will
be able to obtain the credit they deserve,
and even if employed by capital, all cause
for dissension between employed and
employer will be removed, as coopera
tion will regulate the price of labor and
be its perfect defense against inadequate
compensation."
Although neither of Stanford's bills
ever reached a vote on the Senate floor,
they reflected so strong a commitment
to the transformation of industrial pro
duction and ownership away from a cor
porate framework that he was
eventually ousted as president of the

Southern Pacific Railroad, writes A 1 ten
berg.
In the article, he notes that Stanford's
notions of cooperation sought to benefit
women as well. Stanford believed that
cooperatives, due to their intrinsically
democratic nature, would allow for more
business opportunities for women on all
levels, while also protecting them from
exploitation and providing them with
special benefits such as maternity leave.
In founding the University, Stanford
aimed to "produce in the minds of the
laboring classes the same facility for
combining their labor that exists in the
minds of capitalists," according to one
biography of Stanford. This would elim-
