## Tensions mount on eve of Party plenum 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Hundreds of
thousands of cheering protesters filled
the broad streets of the capital yes
terday to demand that the Commu
nists surrender their stranglehold on
power, in perhaps the biggest protest
in Moscow since the Bolshevik Revo
lution.
The huge gathering came on the eve
of a party Central Committee meeting
during which President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is expected to propose that
other parties be allowed to compete
for power, a move likely to spur an
intense struggle between hard-liners
and reformers.
The crowd waved huge white-red
and-blue flags of pre-revolutionary
Russia and held signs warning party
officials to "Remember Romania,"
where a bloody revolt last year toppled
the Stalinist regime of Nicolae
(^eausescu.
The masses stopped next to Red
Square for gigantic rally that was
meant to influence the pivotal Com
munist Party plenary meeting that
opens today.
"This plenum is the party's last
chance," declared Boris N. Yeltsin, a
populist Communist leader who
promised to place the crowd's demands
before the 251-member Central Com
mittee.
Others, harkening to the revolution
that overthrew the czar in February
1917 before being swept away by Lenin
eight months later, said a new revo
lution was under way
"Long live the beginning of the
peaceful, non-violent revolution of Feb
ruary 1990!" historian Yuri Afanasiev
told the cheering crowd.
Some demonstrators at the head of
the rally chanted "Politburo resign!"
Others whistled in derision when they
passed the Moscow city council head
quarters on Gorky Street.
Trucks blocked Moscow's Garden
Ring Road for the marchers who linked
arms next to Gorky Park and com
pletely filled eight lanes of traffic,
stretching back more than half a mile.

Cordons of uniformed police blocked
cars elsewhere, turning the center of
Moscow into a virtual pedestrian mall.
In all, the march and rally lasted
for about five hours before participants
began to disperse. Police observed the
peaceful proceedings in the historic
heart of the capital, but there were
no reports of any disturbances.
According to published reports,
party leader Gorbachev will propose
to the Central Committee that the
party give up the guarantee of power

that was written into the Soviet Con
stitution in 1977.
The Radio Moscow news service In
terfax also said Gorbachev was plan
ning structural reforms that would
reduce the size of the Central Com
mittee and possibly eliminate the
ruling Politburo. He also was expected
to give tacit approval to the concept
of private property.
Many Moscow observers expected a
concentrated effort from conservatives
in the Central Committee to stop the

reforms they believe have brought the
Soviet Union to economic ruin and
ethnic strife.
At least some in the crowd had
doubts whether Gorbachev is commit
ted to radical reforms. "Mikhail Ser
geyevich, whom are you with?" one
sign asked.
Reformers say they have been scared
in recent weeks by the Soviet military
assault on Baku, the capital of the
Azerbaijan republic where a fierce
nationalist movement has taken hold.
