# Slovenian Communists announce secession

I,JUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) â€”
liberal Communists yester
day broke away from the national
Communist Party and declared that
they no longer recognise the institu
tion that has ruled Yugoslavia since
World War 11.
The move followed disputes over the
pace of democratic reform and a vir
tual trade war between the relatively
affluent republic of Slovenia and
archrival Serbia, the largest and most
populous of Yugoslavia's six republics.
The break from the national party
by the Slovenian party was the first
formal party schism since the Corn

munists took power in 1945.
In yesterday's emergency meeting,
the Slovenian party also changed its
name and called for the release of all
political prisoners, an end to all polit
ical trials and immediate talks between
Yugoslav Communists and leaders of
newly formed opposition parties.
Slovenia's Communist Party presi
dent, Ciril Ribicic, said the new party
was not seeking secession from Yugos
lavia but the establishment of a Yugos
lav confederation that restricts central
authority.
"This is the end of the League of
Communists of Yugoslavia, in which

Slovenian Communists had the status
of an unequal minority," said Ribicic,
using the formal name of the national
party.
The national party "doesn't exist
any more for us," said Petar Bekes,
another Slovenian party leader.
Slovenian Communists have moved
quickly in the past three years to
create a pluralistic political system in
the republic. Their reforms have been
criticized harshly in Serbia, where the
ruling Communist hard-liners demand
continued national Communist Party
dominance.
Slovenian Communists stormed out

of a national party congress last month
after Serbian-led hard-liners rejected
reforms.
The national party said the congress
was indefinitely adjourned, but
Slovenian leaders said yesterday that
they are not returning.
"We do not want to be a part of an
old-style dogmatic organization such
as Yugoslavia's League of Commu
nists," Bekes told reporters. He said,
however, that the Slovenian Commu
nists "will remain open for cooperation
with all democratic-orentated forces"
in other Yugoslav republics.
