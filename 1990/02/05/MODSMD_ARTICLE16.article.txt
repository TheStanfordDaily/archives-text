# Editorial
## Editor's welcome 
### 
IT REALLY WASN'T a Coke
bottle.
The photo that ran Jan. 18
with the story announcing my elec
tion as editor of The Daily was
doctored. The truth of the matter
is that following the announcement
of the election results that Wed
nesday night, I imbibed. And the
day of the Daily election also being
my 21st birthday, the champagne
that I chugged at 10:30 that night
wasn't the first alcohol to enter
my system on Jan. 17, 1990.
That's reality. Our photo depart
ment — in the spirit of the evening
— pasted a Coke bottle over the
champagne bottle before the paper
went to press.
More than a few people were
fooled by the doctored photo.
Frankly, I'm flattered that a few
good friends could even momentar
ily entertain the notion that I'm
virtuous enough to celebrate my
election and 21st birthday with
Coca-Cola. Such was not the case.
The Daily doesn't doctor its
photos as a regular practice. It's
something we just don't do. So per
haps it's understandable that,
upon first glance, most people
would never consider the possibil
ity that I wasn't drinking from a
Coke bottle.
A cursory glance often fails to
provide a full or accurate picture
of reality. That's precisely what
makes covering the Stanford com
munity such a challenge. And that's
what makes it so fun.
Events and issues are often more
than they appear to be.
Most everything that constitutes
"news" at Stanford has a history
that extends well beyond the mem
ory of Stanford students.
This spring's ASSU election, for
instance, has a lot more riding on
it than who does and who doesn't
get to add a bogus position to their
resumes. Formed in 1985 as a co
alition of student of color organi
zations, the People's Platform now
dominates Stanford's student gov

ernment. The spring election prom
ises to showcase intense partisan
politics, and some believe this
could be the year Students First
wins the Council of Presidents elec
tion.
If Students First prevails, what
message, if any, would voters be
sending to the student of color or
ganizations? In order to have any
foundation for answering that
question, one must understand
how student politics have evolved
here over the last several years —
a timespan longer than most stu
dents' Stanford experience.
This volume we are making a
concerted effort to put current hap
penings and events in their broader
historical contexts. We want not
only to give you the news but also
a framework for making sense of
it. We will be using some broader
strokes as we paint our portrait of
the Stanford community.
We also want to do a better job
of introducing you to the players
behind the headlines. People make
news. There are few places that
harbor individuals with the vast
range of experiences, knowledge,
talents and ideologies that Stanford
does. This volume, we will be
sharing their stories with you.
We will both question authority
and question those who question
authority. We will harbor a healthy
skepticism toward all, and we will
harbor a healthy skepticism
toward all who advise us to harbor
a healthy skepticism toward
others.
Above all, we will never be con
tent with our first glance.
