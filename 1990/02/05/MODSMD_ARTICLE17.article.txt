Phone plan lacks communication with grad students

IN A SURGE of newfound warm
heartedness, Communication Serv
ices has decided to offer the stu
dents a new and improved telephone
service plan. Only, "offer" is not quite
the right word — unless rejecting the
plan is a possibility, and the "improve
ment" is a regression into the tele
phone flexibility of the sixties. But hey,
it's "new."
But I have one alarming complaint.
Most appalling, I find that Commu
nication Services has failed its primary
task. It has failed to communicate.
I and other residents of Escondido
Village have never been notified by the
Communication Services on the terms
and benefits of this telephone plan.
And if concerned residents like Mi
chael Murray were not to have raised
objections, no doubt this new scheme

would have gone unnoticed.
I find outrageous the lack of com
munication.
I find it ironic that Communication
Services, in such a poor attempt at
communicating itself as a legitimate
communications office, has demonstra
ted itself unfit for its appointed task.
I advance my disgust with this new
telephone plan with the cautionary
warning that if the new system doesn't
go well (and certainly we see
troublesome inaccuracies in their ac
counting), the students will carry the
burden.
Though Communication Services maj
keep the prices-on-paper below that of
AT&T, the actual cost may be higher,
and we will be picking up the tab for
the lobster dinners.
Though the monthly service rate

may drop to zero dollars, our quarterly
housing bill may go up a hundred
dollars.
For these reasons, new features and
unfeatures notwithstanding, the clear
collusion between the Housing Depart
ment and Communication Services
cannot be overlooked and should riot be
disregarded.
Moreover, just because Jan Thomson
has promised much doesn't mean that
she can (or will) deliver.
We in Escondido Village remember
many areas where Communication
Services has "liked to look into."
Most notably, we remember the
"looking into" of Stanford Cable Serv
ice and SUNet throughout Escondido
Village. I have waited over a year,
many others still longer, but we have
not seen anything done.

That need not be so. If Communica
tion Services wants to demonstrate its
altruism, it now has the perfect oppor
tunity to do so. Forget the new tele
phone plan. Install Stanford Cable.
Install SUNet. But forget the new
telephone plan.
With all the phone work necessary
to make a dated system that returns
less than 5 percent a year, the loss in
revenue would be insignificant; and
certainly the construction account is
already there. So as an alternative,
installing Stanford Cable and SUNet
throughout Escondido Village shouldn't
be too taxing for the self-discovered
generosity of Jan Thomson and Com
munication Services, I should think.
