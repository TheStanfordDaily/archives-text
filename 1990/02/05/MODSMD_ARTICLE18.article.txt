# Chicano community must recognize own

Arturo Islas, Stanford University
professor, in his prefacing remarks to a
reading from his latest novel, "Migrant
Souls," said at Meyer Library that his
novel was the first written by a Chi
cano and published by a meyor East
Coast publishing house. He called this
"an outrage" — that it has taken so
long for New York intellectuals to
notice a Chicano.
His reading went well and he had a
respectable showing of students,
literati, and friends.
What is also "an outrage" is that,
for all the talk here at Stanford re
garding cultural penetration, minority
issues, and general we're-not-noticed
because-you-don't-want-to-notice-us
types, none of these "types" showed.
Where the hell were members of the
University Committee on Minority

Issues, or the student rainbow coali
tion, or the Chicano faculty, or the
Chicano administrators, or all the sym
pathizers of liberal causes?
This is where it's at! This is the real
nitty gritty — not found in committees
or "politically correct" functions. Let
us become "intellectually correct" and
learn to patronize our own.
Next time someone whines about not
being noticed, that someone should ask
him/herself if he/she has noticed
him/herself!
