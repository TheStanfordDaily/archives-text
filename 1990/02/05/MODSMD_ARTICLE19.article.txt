# Friends, fans praise legendary columnist

As personal friends of Andrew
Berkowitz, we would like to express in
a public way our admiration for his
writing and our regrets that we will

actually have to subscribe to a newspa
per to see him in print in the future.
On a campus whose collective sense
of humor is rather blunt — remember
how we cherished The Farm Side —
Andrew has consistently supplied a fare
that catered to the sophisticated and
the obtuse alike. Not to slight any of
the other Daily writers who have tried
to evoke a chuckle, hut Andrew stands
(ahem) tall among the lot, a lark above
the din, a gem in the desert sands. . .
But seriously, we will miss A.B.'s
cherubic mug and rhythmic wit every
week and wish him a long, prolific
career in ink. Too often we assume our
friends know what we think of them.
