## Heed the unheard voices 
### 
LET ME GET this straight. Accord
ing to their Jan. 30 letter to The
Daily, seniors Ziad Sarkis and
James Turo have a problem with Marian
Wright Edelman speaking at Commence
ment because on the average day not
only would she not turn heads in Palo
Alto, but she also would not attract a
horde of autograph seekers.
And it would take more than two or
three words to describe her contributions
of lasting significance to the world. And
she's a liberal-to-left woman of color who
cares about kids. And she appeals to the
agitated segment of the Stanford com
munity.
No Gary Trudeau is she. No Ted Kop
pel. No Tip O'Neill. No way should she
be speaking at Commencement. Right?
Wrong. Edelman, founder and presi
dent of the Washington, D.C.-based
Children's Defense Fund, is everything a
Commencement speaker at the dawn of
the 1990s in the Bush-Quayle United
States should be: Edelman is an eloquent,
powerful, unyielding voice for the so
many that our society wrongfully has
labeled uneloquent, powerless and yield
ing. Children. Women of color. Women.
African-Americans.
The 1990s are a time for all of us in
positions of extreme privilege to place
those who have not benefited from such
privilege in the center of our universe.
We have to figure out that what we want,
what we think and who we are need not
always be the center of attention.
Commencement is a celebration of a
university and its graduates; a time for
recognition of the intellectual and per
sonal growth of a body of students, pro
fessors, faculty, administrators, parents
and support staff.
Yet the celebration is also one of a

beginning; hence the name "commence
ment." So, amid the self-congratulatory
pomp of the ceremony we can all use a
frank reminder of the circumstances we
face. And in this country, we have yet
to satisfactorily face the circumstances
of oppression that surround women,
people of color, women of color and
children.
When I received my bachelor's degree
from Drake Univeristy in 1986, the Com
mencement speakers were Robert Wolper,
David Helmick and Bayard Rustin, all
recipients of honorary doctorate degrees.
A producer, a future (now present) pres
ident of the United States Olympic Com
mittee and an African-American civil
rights activist. At the time, the only per
son I'd heard of was Wolper.
I'd seen "Roots" and the 1984 Olym
pics. Now the only speech I remember
is Rustin's. For the over 900 degree
recipients who on that day figured they
had conquered the world, Rustin
reminded us that many had not shared
in the conquest. He reminded us that we
shared the world with people whose voices
were not listened to.
Edelman, in who she is as a woman
of color (and we should see her gender
and her race), and in who she speaks for,
is one of those voices.
In her fall 1989 article in the Stanford
Law and Policy Review, Edelman wrote
that "America's most important national
priority should be to ensure our children's
physical, educational, and economic well
being. . . . The issue is not merely a mat
ter of money, but of national will, values,
and a commitment to our future. As a
wealthy, industrialized society, we cannot
continue to condemn a quarter of our
children to poverty, illness and educa
tional neglect."
Most of us at Stanford, I would venture,

The 1990s are a time for all
of us In positions of ex
treme privilege to place
those who have not bene
fited from such privilege in
the center of our universe.

didn't have to worry about a childhood
full of poverty, illness and educational
neglect. I anticipate that Edelman will
exhort and challenge us to share that
wealth.
On the other hand, seniors Sarkis and
Turo exhort and challenge us to worry
about how much time it takes us to tell
our friends and family who our Com
mencement speaker is. As if people aren't
going to show up unless the speaker has
been featured in People magazine at least
once.
Nonetheless, I accept the challenge and
go one step further; I've figured out a
list of speakers that will please the
speaker selection committee critics and
the critics' assessment of the priorities
of the speaker selection committee.
Gender — woman. Color — black.
Renown — well (as in well-renowned).
Robin Givens, Whitney Houston and
Florence Griffith Joyner. Commence
ment, June 17, 1990. Be there.

full of poverty, illness and educational

exhort and challenge us to share that
wealth.
On the other hand, seniors Sarkis and
Turo exhort and challenge us to worry
about how much time it takes us to tell
our friends and family who our Com
mencement speaker is. As if people aren't
going to show up unless the speaker has
been featured in People magazine at least
once.
Nonetheless, I accept the challenge and
go one step further; I've figured out a
list of speakers that will please the
speaker selection committee critics and
the critics' assessment of the priorities
of the speaker selection committee.
Gender — woman. Color — black.
Renown — well (as in well-renowned).

Florence Griffith Joyner. Commence

LET ME GET this straight. Accord
ing to their Jan. 30 letter to The
Daily, seniors Ziad Sarkis and
James Turo have a problem with Marian
Wright Edelman speaking at Commence
ment because on the average day not
only would she not turn heads in Palo
Alto, but she also would not attract a
horde of autograph seekers.
And it would take more than two or
three words to describe her contributions
of lasting significance to the world. And
she's a liberal-to-left woman of color who
cares about kids. And she appeals to the
agitated segment of the Stanford com
munity.
No Gary Trudeau is she. No Ted Kop
pel. No Tip O'Neill. No way should she
be speaking at Commencement. Right?
Wrong. Edelman, founder and presi
dent of the Washington, D.C.-based
Children's Defense Fund, is everything a
Commencement speaker at the dawn of
the 1990s in the Bush-Quayle United
States should be: Edelman is an eloquent,
powerful, unyielding voice for the so
many that our society wrongfully has
labeled uneloquent, powerless and yield
ing. Children. Women of color. Women.
African-Americans.
The 1990s are a time for all of us in
positions of extreme privilege to place
those who have not benefited from such
privilege in the center of our universe.
We have to figure out that what we want,
what we think and who we are need not
always be the center of attention.
Commencement is a celebration of a
university and its graduates; a time for
recognition of the intellectual and per
sonal growth of a body of students, pro
fessors, faculty, administrators, parents
and support staff.
Yet the celebration is also one of a

beginning; hence the name "commence
ment." So, amid the self-congratulatory
pomp of the ceremony we can all use a
frank reminder of the circumstances we
face. And in this country, we have yet
to satisfactorily face the circumstances
of oppression that surround women,
people of color, women of color and
children.
When I received my bachelor's degree
from Drake Univeristy in 1986, the Com
mencement speakers were Robert Wolper,
David Helmick and Bayard Rustin, all
recipients of honorary doctorate degrees.
A producer, a future (now present) pres
ident of the United States Olympic Com
mittee and an African-American civil
rights activist. At the time, the only per
son I'd heard of was Wolper.
I'd seen "Roots" and the 1984 Olym
pics. Now the only speech I remember
is Rustin's. For the over 900 degree
recipients who on that day figured they
had conquered the world, Rustin
reminded us that many had not shared
in the conquest. He reminded us that we
shared the world with people whose voices
were not listened to.
Edelman, in who she is as a woman
of color (and we should see her gender
and her race), and in who she speaks for,
is one of those voices.
In her fall 1989 article in the Stanford
Law and Policy Review, Edelman wrote
that "America's most important national
priority should be to ensure our children's
physical, educational, and economic well
being. . . . The issue is not merely a mat
ter of money, but of national will, values,
and a commitment to our future. As a
wealthy, industrialized society, we cannot
continue to condemn a quarter of our
children to poverty, illness and educa
tional neglect."
