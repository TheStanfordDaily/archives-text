## Cardinal cagers roll over Golden Bears 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
For 15 minutes, the Stanford
women's basketball team looked
mortal Saturday.
Facing the California Golden
Bears in the unfriendly confines
of Harmon Arena, the Cardinal
could not pull away in the early
going. Then senior Katy Steding
took over and Stanford cruised to
an easy 87-60 victory.
The nation's second ranked
team upped its season mark to a
perfect 19-0, 9-0 in Pacific 10 Con
ference play. California fell to 13-
6, 5-4.

Cardinal 87
Golden Bears 60

Playing its first game in a week,
the Cardinal women came out ice
cold. Stanford connected on only
five of its first 15 shots. The Bears
were shooting better but having
trouble holding on to the basket
ball. California committed 16
first-half turnovers.
"I don't think necessarily it was
one of our better efforts," Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer said,
noting that the team arrived in
Berkeley a little late after getting
stuck in traffic.
Following a television time-out
at the 3:48 mark, the Cardinal
had possession and a 26-24 lead
as they shook off the effects of
their layoff. Steding buried a
three-pointer from the right side,
quickly got back on defense to
intercept a pass and drove in for
a layup.
Her five quick points keyed an
11-0 Stanford run to give the Car
dinal a 13-point lead at 37-24.
The Bears answered with baskets
from Kesha Martin and Teresa
Palmisano to cut the lead to nine.
California may have had no
tions of heading for the locker
room facing only a single-digit def
icit, but Steding squelched those

by hitting a jumper from the
baseline with two seconds left in
the half to make it 29-28.
Steding's 17 points in the
opening stanza on 7-of-12 shooting
helped compensate for the fact
that guards Sonja Henning and
Jennifer Azzi were a combined 0
of 5 from the field. Henning, how
ever, was again superb quarter
backing the offense and dished
out five assists in the half en route
to nine for the game.
Cal started fast in the second
half, outscoring Stanford 6-2 on
back-to-back three-point plays by
Martin and Laura Baker. After a
trade of baskets that made the
score 43-36, Azzi drove the lane
for a layup and her first points
of the game.
That play sparked the Cardinal
as they scored 10 more un
answered points over the next
four minutes to move up 55-36
with 12:21 to play. Stanford would
lead by as many as 31 in the
closing minutes.
The game was perhaps a testa
ment to the Cardinal's balance
more than anything else. Trisha
Stevens, who has been unstop
pable of late, only managed six
points and Azzi and Henning com
bined for just 14.
Meanwhile, Steding finished
with 24 and starting frontcourt
mate Julie Zeilstra added 17. Val
Whiting came off the bench to
score 20 points, including 10 of
11 free throws. She also led a
strong rebounding effort in the
second half with 10.
The 5-foot-8 Henning was the
Cardinal's second-leading re
bounder with eight. "Katy had a
really strong game," VanDerveer
said. "It was a real good team
effort.
"We had consistent guard play.
Sonja did an excellent job running
the offense," she added. VanDer
veer said the best thing is "we're
not turning the ball over" and
"people are playing with an in
credible amount of confidence."

more than anything else. Trisha
Stevens, who has been unstop
pable of late, only managed six
points and Azzi and Henning com
bined for just 14.
Meanwhile, Steding finished
with 24 and starting frontcourt
mate Julie Zeilstra added 17. Val
Whiting came off the bench to
score 20 points, including 10 of
11 free throws. She also led a
strong rebounding effort in the
second half with 10.
The 5-foot-8 Henning was the
Cardinal's second-leading re
bounder with eight. "Katy had a
really strong game," VanDerveer
said. "It was a real good team
effort.
"We had consistent guard play.
Sonja did an excellent job running
the offense," she added. VanDer
veer said the best thing is "we're
not turning the ball over" and
"people are playing with an in
credible amount of confidence."
