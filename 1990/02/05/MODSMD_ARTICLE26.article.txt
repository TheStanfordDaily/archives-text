## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The steamroller known as the Stan
ford women's tennis team continues
to flatten its opponents. The Cardinal
upped its record to 2-0 Saturday by
turning the Washington Huskies into
a purple pancake en route to a con
vincing 9-0 romp.

The team came off the court pro
claiming that this match was not as
ho-hum as Hawaii, but the scene
changed little: nine straight set vic
tories with bagels abounding. Only
Heather Willens at No. 3 singles got
anywhere near tested, and that was
partly due to a slight muscle pull.
"Not to make excuses, but I had a
slight strain," Willens said after a 6-3,
6-2 victory over Kris Clevenger. "I was

to show my stuff, so when I do I have to
make the best of it.'

a little tired and was not moving my
feet. When I don't move my feet I
don't hit the ball well."
It was a day where the only problems
the Cardinal seemed to have came
from themselves. Stanford's No. 4
player, Mario Carruth, said that she
had some difficulty getting started in
her 6-2, 6-0 win over Kristen Hudson.
"I started out a little shaky," the
freshman said, "[Butl just the first
couple of games."
This sentiment was shared by
Meredith "Crime Dog" McGrath at No.
1. Playing in her first college dual
match, the freshman had some early
problems with hard hitting Cindy
Olejar.
"She was hitting the ball harder
than I have seen for awhile." McGrath

said after a 6-2, 6-0 victory. "I started
out really slow, but once I got going
I was fine."
At the five and six spots, Kylie
Johnson and Valerie Wilson, had little
trouble at all as they were the first
two off the court.
"I felt good," Johnson said after dis
patching with Jennifer Mead 6-0, 6-1.
"I played my normal game. I played
very controlled and really aggressive-
Wilson got the chance at number
six when Lisa Green woke up with her
knee too sore to play and thus forced
a change in the lineup. The senior was
happy with the playing time.
"I played pretty well," Wilson said
after her quick 6-0, 6-1 win over Lisa
Hirkley. "I don't get much chance to

show my stuff, so when I do I have
to make the best of it."
Teri Whitlinger has been making the
best of her chances for years, and con
tinued to do so on Saturday. The junior
used her grunting serve to power past
Washington's Mary Reilly in a routine
6-1, 6-1 victory.
Cardinal Coach Frank Brennan said
his team needed to work on their dou
bles, but against Washington the
women netters had little problem.
Whitlinger and McGrath took out
Washington's No. 1 team of Olejar and
Mead 6-1, 6-0, and the No. 2 team of
Johnson and Willens followed with a
6-1, 6-1 victory over Reilly and
Clevenger. Playing together for the
first time because of the absence of
Green, the No. 3 doubles team of Car
ruth and Wilson was a little tentative,
but still pulled out a 6-2, 6-4 win over
Clayton and Hudson.
"Everbody played pretty well again.
We had some parents in, and people
seem to play better in front of parents,"
Brennan said. "Nobody got injured and
they worked on things.
