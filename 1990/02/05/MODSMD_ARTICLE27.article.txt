Cardinal sweeps three
game series with Titans

The Stanford baseball team,
now 6-0 and off to its best start
since 1986, crunched the Titans
in the series opener on Friday,
applied water torture in a 1-0 win
Saturday, and then shocked
Fullerton with a come-from
behind, 8-7 win yesterday.
Friday's game, which the Car
dinal would win 8-1, was actually
a pitcher's duel for the first six
innings. Well, sort of.
"I didn't feel really in sync,"
Stanford starter Stan Spencer
said. "I never got comfort
able. . . (and) I left my fastball up
a lot."
The Titans apparently didn't
notice that Spencer wasn't pitch
ing well, because they got all of
three hits in the seven innings he
tossed. Meanwhile, Fullerton
starter Sam Colarusso was doing
just as well — except against Paul
Carey.
Carey, who normally doesn't
catch fire offensively until the

season is several weeks (or, as in
1988, several months) old, gave
the Cardinal all its early runs with
a RBI single in the first and a
solo home run in the fourth.
"That might be the earliest
homer I've hit," Carey said. "I
start off slowly — I don't know
why. But I'm gonna change it."
Carey's hits gave Stanford a 2-0
lead going into the seventh, when
the Titans' Chris Robinson came
in to relieve Colarusso. When he
exited exactly two outs later, the
lead had become 4-0, thanks to a
double by David Holbrook and
singles by Steve Solomon, Troy
Paulsen and Jeff Hammonds.
Robinson left a mess for lefty
Rich Faulks to clean up — Ham
monds was on first, Troy Tallman
(who had reached on an error)
was on second, and Carey was at
the plate. Faulks took measure of
the jam and promptly threw his
first pitch to the backstop, moving
up the runners.
Faulks then intentionally
walked Carey to get at David
McCarty, which seemed like a wise
move because Carey was 3-for-3
at the time.
Wrong. McCarty took the wise
move downtown, launching a 3-2
fastball into orbit. The ball soared
beyond the fence, floated over the
pine trees and cleared the 20-foot
high chainlink fence behind the
trees by at least 10 feet. It may
still be flying. Eight-zip Stanford,
game over.

"That (walking Carey) is the
thing I'm going to have to
prevent," McCarty said. "The
coaches put me behind Paul be
cause they have confidence in
me. . . Once I show I can hit the
ball, they'll have to pitch to Paul,
and he'll hurt them."
The explosion in game one was
contrasted by Saturday's wet de
fensive struggle — Roger Bur
nett's sacrifice fly to score Troy
Tallman in the third was the total
offensive output for both teams
on a day marred by wind, wind,
more wind and rain for the last
two innings.
Like Spencer the day before,
starter Mike Mussina wasn't at
his best, but neither were the
Titans. They got six hits — five

singles and a bunt — and only
threatened to score once, in the
final inning.
Scott Weiss, who came on (along
with the rain) in the eighth,
struck out the first two Titans in
the ninth. The second, Steve
Sisco, reached first when strike
three hit the dirt and got past
Tallman, and then the Titans put
on a beaut of a hit-and-run.
Sisco took off on a 1-1 pitch to
Matt Hattabaugh, and second
baseman Tim Griffin broke to
cover the bag. Hattabaugh then
poked the ball right in the gap
where Griffin had been playing,
and when the dust cleared Hat
tabaugh was at first and Sisco on
third the first Titan runner to
make it that far.
Domingo Mota then lofted a fly
to right, but it was too shallow
to score Sisco. Carey raced in for
the catch and fired home. Sisco
stayed put. Two down.
Finally, Kevin Fallow poked a
roller at Griffin, who dug it out
of the mud, tossed to McCarty
and ended the game.
The Cardinal's luck seemed to
run out in the early innings Sun
day, as Fullerton took a 4-0 lead
after only two shots at Stanford's
Jamie Sepeda. Down 1-0, Sepeda
got two quick outs in the second,
but then hit the next two batters
and gave up three straight hits
to dig the hole deeper.


AT Green - Dflffly
First baseman David McCarty helped lead Stanford's offensive
attack in its three game sweep of Fuilerton, breaking out for two
home runs — including a grand slam — and six RBI.
In the bottom of the second,
the Cardinal offense dug him right
back out, as Titan starter Huck
Flener took a trip to Pitcher Hell.
Ever have one of those innings?
Homer. Walk. Double. RBI
grounder — one out. Another
homer. Single. Error on the short
stop. Force at second — two down.
A run-scoring balk (now that
hurts!). And, finally, yet another
homer. Seven runs, three dongs
(courtesy of Griffin, Tallman, and
McCarty) and one very rattled
pitcher.
Just why Flener was left in so
long is anyone's guess, but finally
Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell
stopped the carnage by bringing
in Bill Fitzgerald to get the final
out of the inning.
After that, though, the Cardinal
was shut down and the Titans
got right back in it. Sepeda was
chased in the fourth after yielding
a walk and single, and reliever
Aaron Dorlarque then gave up a
home run to Phil Nevin to tie the

score.
"It was a lazy breaking ball,"
Dorlarque said. "Later on, I just
concentrated on getting on top of
my breaking ball."
It worked. He gave up two hits
the rest of the way. "Aaron gave
a fantastic performance," Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"He just shut them down for five
innings."
The Titan pitchers were doing
just as well, and no Cardinal bat
ter got past second again until
the bottom of the ninth. McCarty
then led off with a double to left,
and Greg Tripaldi came on to run
for him. Reliever Matt Watson in
tentionally walked Griffin, and
then Paulsen bunted them both
up.
After another intentional pass,
this time to Holbrook, the stage
was set for Solomon, who had
taken over in left for Ryan Turner
in the eighth and made a spec
tacular catch crashing into the
wall. Solomon worked the count
to 2-0 and then stroked a grounder
to right — just six inches away
from Borgogno's outstretched
glove — to score Tripaldi with
the winning run.
