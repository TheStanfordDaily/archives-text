# Beaver star downs Card

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — If the Stanford men's
basketball team were to vote for the player
of the year, you can bet they would be nearly
unanimous in selecting Gary Payton of Oregon
State.
Dr. Payton was in Saturday as he operated
for 32 points, 10 assists, seven rebounds and
five steals in the Beavers' 84-70 dissection of
the Cardinal before a "Dad's day" sellout crowd
of 10,400 in Gill Coliseum.

Beavers 84
Cardinal 70

Oregon State is now 17-3 and sitting atop
the Pacific 10 Conference at 10-1. The Cardinal
fell to 12-7, 4-6.
When guard John Patrick hit both ends of
a one-and-one 12 minutes, 11 seconds into the
game, Stanford trailed by only three. After
the television timeout, though, Oregon State
went on a 12-2 run including six points and
an assist from Payton to put the Beavers up
32-21.
"1 wouldn't mind playing against Payton
again if it was in the finals of the Pac-10
Tournament," Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said afterward.
"Other than that, I've seen enough of that
guy"
In a first half that saw Stanford's early 8-2
lead evaporate in a big way, Payton scored 21
points as the Beavers went into the locker
room with a commanding 47-29 advantage.
The bugaboo for the Cardinal was once again
what Montgomery called "not taking care of
the basketball." Though the Beavers used full
court pressure early, Stanford's trouble was
in the half court.
The Cardinal easily got the ball over the
timeline only to give it to the Beavers with
sloppy dribbling and lazy passing.
Patrick said Stanford's relative youth and
experience was "not an excuse" for the errant
play. The team knows what to do, but did not
get it done, he said.
The result of the turnovers was a number
of fast-break opportunities for Oregon State.
"They got a lot of easy baskets off transition,"
Patrick added.
Said Montgomery: "Turnovers for layups
absolutely kill you against a team like Oregon
State."
In the opening 20 minutes, Stanford com
mitted 14 turnovers.
But all the news was not bad. Adam Keefe,
who has had few opportunities of late as teams
have denied him the ball, got nine first-half
shots. He's been averaging that many per game
in Pac-10 play.
Keefe converted five of those attempts and
added two free throws for a total of 12 points
at intermission. He also had eight rebounds.
Andrew Vlahov, who has been struggling from
the field of late, had six at the half on 3-of-6
shooting. Keefe finished with 24 points and
13 boards, Vlahov 12 and eight.
Stanford's strategy was to get it in to the
big men as often as possible and exploit the
size advantage over the smaller Beavers. It
worked . . . sort of.
Oregon State's defensive tenacity and jump
shooting led Montgomery to play a small lineup
more suited to the Beavers. "We played three
guards to try to give us help against the pres
sure and the perimeter scoring," he said.
The result was that Payton got to operate
against defenders like 6-foot Marcus Lollie in
stead of 6-7 Deshon Wingate. Montgomery ex-
plained that the switch allowed
Payton to back in to the basket
and "find the open man or take
it into the lane."
"The hardest thing in the world
(to defend) is a guy who spin
dribbles," he said, adding that
Payton was a master of the
change of direction. "We felt to
try to commit an extra person (to
Payton) would have been defen
sive suicide," Montgomery said.
"Maybe in retrospect, with him
getting 32, it would've been a good
idea."
Despite all of Stanford's

troubles, the team showed its
moxie in the second half. When
the Beavers led 56-33 at the 17:55
mark, the Cardinal did anything
but play dead. Kenny Ammann,
who finished with 17, scored on
a fast-break layup and added a
three-pointer as Stanford
trimmed the margin to 18.
Those points keyed a 19-8 Car
dinal run that ended with another
Ammann trey and brought the
team within 12. Stanford had a
chance to trim it to 10 at the
midway point of the half. Am
mann threw a baseball pass to a
fast-breaking Keefe, but the Car
dinal big man wasn't looking and
the pass hit him in the back.

That turnover ended the threat

at intermission. He also had eight rebounds.
Andrew Vlahov, who has been struggling from
the field of late, had six at the half on 3-of-6
shooting. Keefe finished with 24 points and
13 boards, Vlahov 12 and eight.
Stanford's strategy was to get it in to the
big men as often as possible and exploit the
size advantage over the smaller Beavers. It
worked . . . sort of.
Oregon State's defensive tenacity and jump
shooting led Montgomery to play a small lineup
more suited to the Beavers. "We played three
guards to try to give us help against the pres
sure and the perimeter scoring," he said.
The result was that Payton got to operate
against defenders like 6-foot Marcus Lollie in
stead of 6-7 Deshon Wingate. Montgomery ex-
plained that the switch allowed
Payton to back in to the basket
and "find the open man or take
it into the lane."
"The hardest thing in the world
(to defend) is a guy who spin
dribbles," he said, adding that
Payton was a master of the
change of direction. "We felt to
try to commit an extra person (to
Payton) would have been defen
sive suicide," Montgomery said.
"Maybe in retrospect, with him
getting 32, it would've been a good
idea."
Despite all of Stanford's

troubles, the team showed its
moxie in the second half. When
the Beavers led 56-33 at the 17:55
mark, the Cardinal did anything
but play dead. Kenny Ammann,
who finished with 17, scored on
a fast-break layup and added a
three-pointer as Stanford
trimmed the margin to 18.
Those points keyed a 19-8 Car
dinal run that ended with another
Ammann trey and brought the
team within 12. Stanford had a
chance to trim it to 10 at the
midway point of the half. Am
mann threw a baseball pass to a
fast-breaking Keefe, but the Car
dinal big man wasn't looking and
the pass hit him in the back.

That turnover ended the threat
CORVALLIS, Ore. — If the Stanford men's
basketball team were to vote for the player
of the year, you can bet they would be nearly
unanimous in selecting Gary Payton of Oregon
State.
Dr. Payton was in Saturday as he operated
for 32 points, 10 assists, seven rebounds and
five steals in the Beavers' 84-70 dissection of
the Cardinal before a "Dad's day" sellout crowd
of 10,400 in Gill Coliseum.

Beavers 84
Cardinal 70

Oregon State is now 17-3 and sitting atop
the Pacific 10 Conference at 10-1. The Cardinal
fell to 12-7, 4-6.
When guard John Patrick hit both ends of
a one-and-one 12 minutes, 11 seconds into the
game, Stanford trailed by only three. After
the television timeout, though, Oregon State
went on a 12-2 run including six points and
an assist from Payton to put the Beavers up
32-21.
"1 wouldn't mind playing against Payton
again if it was in the finals of the Pac-10
Tournament," Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said afterward.
"Other than that, I've seen enough of that
guy"
In a first half that saw Stanford's early 8-2
lead evaporate in a big way, Payton scored 21
points as the Beavers went into the locker
room with a commanding 47-29 advantage.
The bugaboo for the Cardinal was once again
what Montgomery called "not taking care of
the basketball." Though the Beavers used full
court pressure early, Stanford's trouble was
in the half court.
The Cardinal easily got the ball over the
timeline only to give it to the Beavers with
sloppy dribbling and lazy passing.
Patrick said Stanford's relative youth and
experience was "not an excuse" for the errant
play. The team knows what to do, but did not
get it done, he said.
The result of the turnovers was a number
of fast-break opportunities for Oregon State.
"They got a lot of easy baskets off transition,"
Patrick added.
Said Montgomery: "Turnovers for layups
absolutely kill you against a team like Oregon
State."
In the opening 20 minutes, Stanford com
mitted 14 turnovers.
But all the news was not bad. Adam Keefe,
who has had few opportunities of late as teams
have denied him the ball, got nine first-half
shots. He's been averaging that many per game
in Pac-10 play.
Keefe converted five of those attempts and
added two free throws for a total of 12 points
at intermission. He also had eight rebounds.
Andrew Vlahov, who has been struggling from
the field of late, had six at the half on 3-of-6
shooting. Keefe finished with 24 points and
13 boards, Vlahov 12 and eight.
