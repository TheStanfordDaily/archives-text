# Grad students say phone system is wrong number
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Despite the University's recent attempts
to respond to their concerns about proposed
changes to the telephone system, graduate
students still feel their needs have been
put on hold.
In response to complaints from graduate
students, the Office of Communication
Services has made several modifications to
its original plans to bring the University
phone system to Escondido Village and the
Rains Apartments.
However, many graduate students feel
these changes are relatively insignificant
and that their needs have not been con
sidered by the University in its decision to
convert to the new system.
They think there is no real benefit in
Stanford's proposed telephone system,
while there are many disadvantages, par
ticularly in terms of rates and convenience.
Deferred benefits
Originally, the extension of the Univer
sity telephone system was part of a larger
project to extend the SUNet computer net
work and cable television to rooms and
apartments on campus â€” which would have
benefited students substantially.
However, because of a lack of funds,
rooms in older buildings, such as Escon

dido, will not be connected to SUNet.
Carla Chiotti, who is married to a grad
uate student and has two children, said the
new system "really doesn't offer anything
more. It gives higher rates for fewer serv
ices."
"Why can't we wait and get the whole
package at the same time?" she wondered.
Alon Levy, a graduate student in com
puter science, echoed Chiotti's sentiments.
"They should give us the added benefits
at the same time as the new telephone
system.
"Right now, we just have promises about
future benefits, while we have the disad
vantages of the phone system," he said.
Limited choices
Students are also angered because many
choices have been taken out of their hands,
particularly the choice of long-distance car
riers and special services.
Communication Services said its long
distance rates are lower than AT&T's in
the evening and night but slightly higher
during the day.
However, many students use other long
distance companies or special calling pro
grams, such as AT&T's Reach Out America
plan, which will not be available under the
new system.
Levy currently uses U.S. Sprint
to make frequent calls to Israel.
He said he thinks his rates under
Stanford's new system will go up.
Maureen Matthews, whose hus
band is a graduate student, sub
scribes to the Reach Out America
plan. She said she is also worried
that her rates will increase under
Stanford's plan.
Mary Gingell, who is married
to a postdoctoral scholar, is a na
tional officer in a volunteer or
ganization for which she makes
"at least 10 long-distance calls per
day-
She said her costs under Reach
Out America are at least 5 to 10
percent cheaper than Stanford's
rates will be, making her organ
ization pay more for her phone
calls.
The lack of a listing in directory
assistance will also cause prob
lems for her work, she said.
Like the lives of other campus
spouses, Gingell's life does not
revolve around Stanford. The
University did not take her situ
ation and that of others like her
into account when it decided to
go ahead with the phone system,
she said.
"Grandfather" clause
Mike Murray, a graduate stu
dent living in Escondido who has
been at the forefront of the fight
against the new phone system,
said Communication Services is
trying to accommodate some of
the residents' demands to give
graduate students living in Escon
dido and Rains more flexibility.

Under the revised proposal, Es
condido and Rains residents will
be able to choose whether they
want to have a personal access
code and individual billing for
their long-distance calling or have
their calls billed directly to the
line subscriber, according to Com
munication Services director Jan
Thomson.
In addition, any student on
campus can have his or her phone
number listed with directory as
sistance for a fee of $ 1 per month
for each name listed, Thomson
said.
In response to complaints about
the lack of Universal Lifeline serv
ice for low-income families, Com
munication Services will
"grandfather" anyone who is cur
rently on lifeline service and allow
them to pay a special low rate of
about $3.50 per month, Thomson
said.
Thomson said Communication
Services will not be able to offer
any service corresponding to
Pacific Bell's measured rate serv
ice, although her office will "look
into it"in future years.
In addition, current residents
will not be charged the $36 in
stallation fee when their telephone
service is switched from Pacific
Bell to Stanford's system in June,
she said.
Communication Services is con
sidering extending these options
to other residences in future
years. However, she said she is
wary of committing to more than
Communication Services can pro
vide.
Murray called Communication
Services' plan for Lifeline Service
a "short-term solution."
"A low-income family who
moves in next September will

have to pay Communication Serv
ices' full rata," Murray said.
"There needs to be some kind of
policy set to accommodate low
income families in the future."
Input: too little, too late
Going beyond the specifics of
the plan, many graduate students
are angered by Stanford's attitude
toward them.
Thomson said the original plans
for the phone system called for
rates and features that were as
close as possible to what people
were used to with Pacific Bell.
Most of these suggestions came
from the Housing Operations Ad
visory Committee, she said. The
committee is made up of admin
istrators and students.
However, graduate students
said they were not consulted
before the plans were made, and
now it is too late to make any
significant changes.
"I knew nothing about it" until
fairly recently, Gingell said. Most
of the changes that have been
made are the result of complaints
from graduate resident assistants.
"They didn't get any input from
us," she said.
Murray said he is worried about
what the future may hold for the
new system's services and rates.
"It is fairly easy to rally people
now," but after people become ac
customed to the system, it may
be very difficult to make any
changes, he said.
"How many complaints will it
take to make a change in the fu
ture?" he wondered.
Murray said he has written let
ters to the California Public
Utility Commission, which is
checking to see if any part of Stan
ford's new phone system is illegal.
