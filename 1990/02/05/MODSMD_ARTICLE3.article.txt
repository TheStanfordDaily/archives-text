# Grad students say phone system is wrong number
## 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
Despite the University's recent attempts
to respond to their concerns about proposed
changes to the telephone system, graduate
students still feel their needs have been
put on hold.
In response to complaints from graduate
students, the Office of Communication
Services has made several modifications to
its original plans to bring the University
phone system to Escondido Village and the
Rains Apartments.
However, many graduate students feel
these changes are relatively insignificant
and that their needs have not been con
sidered by the University in its decision to
convert to the new system.
They think there is no real benefit in
Stanford's proposed telephone system,
while there are many disadvantages, par
ticularly in terms of rates and convenience.
Deferred benefits
Originally, the extension of the Univer
sity telephone system was part of a larger
project to extend the SUNet computer net
work and cable television to rooms and
apartments on campus â€” which would have
benefited students substantially.
However, because of a lack of funds,
rooms in older buildings, such as Escon

dido, will not be connected to SUNet.
Carla Chiotti, who is married to a grad
uate student and has two children, said the
new system "really doesn't offer anything
more. It gives higher rates for fewer serv
ices."
"Why can't we wait and get the whole
package at the same time?" she wondered.
Alon Levy, a graduate student in com
puter science, echoed Chiotti's sentiments.
"They should give us the added benefits
at the same time as the new telephone
system.
"Right now, we just have promises about
future benefits, while we have the disad
vantages of the phone system," he said.
Limited choices
Students are also angered because many
choices have been taken out of their hands,
particularly the choice of long-distance car
riers and special services.
Communication Services said its long
distance rates are lower than AT&T's in
the evening and night but slightly higher
during the day.
However, many students use other long
distance companies or special calling pro
grams, such as AT&T's Reach Out America
plan, which will not be available under the
new system.
