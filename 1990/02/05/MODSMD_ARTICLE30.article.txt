# Card brands Longhorns
## No. 1 swimmers mutilate second-ranked Texas 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Saturday's swim meet at
deGuerre Pool was expected to be
a tough battle between the Stan
ford women and their counter
parts from Texas.
The Cardinal was ranked No.
1 in the coaches' poll and the
Lady Longhorns No. 2, while
Swimming World magazine had it
the other way around. Addition
ally, the two teams have combined
to win the last seven national
titles, and neither has finished
worse than third in the eight
years the NCAA has conducted a
championship meet.
Unfortunately, no one told
Stanford it was supposed to be a
close, exciting meet. The Cardinal
opened up a 43-9 lead after only
six events and cruised to a lop
sided 93-47 win over the Lady
Longhorns.

"I honestly didn't think the
score would be like that," Stan
ford Coach Richard Quick said.
"We won the close races and we
came from behind to get points."
Despite cold weather and over
cast skies, seven pool records were
set in front of the school-record
1800 spectators. And proving that
Stanford will be a national power
for years to come, three Cardinal
freshman combined to win seven
events and set five of those
records.
Janel Jorgensen won the 100-
yard and 200 freestyles as well as
the 200 individual medley, and set
a pool record in the IM. Her time
eclipsed the previous record set
in 1980 by Janet Buchan, who is

now known as Mrs. John Elway.
Lori Heisick won both breast
stroke events, setting a pool record
in the 200, and Janet Evans won
both the 1000 and 500 freestyles.
Evans' split at the midpoint of
the 1000 was so fast that it set
a pool record in the 500, and while
the second half of her swim was
not as fast, she still came in only
five seconds off her American
record.
"I think I took it out a little
too fast," she said. "Next time I'll
know. But I was still happy with
my time."
The time in the 1000 was both
a school and pool record, while
her 500 record lasted only an hour
before she broke it again in the
actual event.

gensen setting a pool record in
the 200 medley relay. After Evans
won the 1000 freestyle, Jorgensen
won the 200 freestyle and soph
omore Karen Kraemer passed
Texas' Katy Arris with about 50
yards left in the race to take sec
ond.
"I think the turning point was
the 200 freestyle," Quick said. "I
think they thought they could
sweep it."
The Cardinal extended the lead
in the next event as Susannah
Miller, Dede Trimble and Ma
honey swept the 100 backstroke.
Heisick and Jill Johnson then
went one-two in the 100 breast
stroke and the rout was on.
The next race, the 200 butterfly,
typified the meet. Texas had Kel
ley Davies and Kristi Kiggans en
tered — two swimmers who took
second and third in that event at
the NCAA Championships two
years ago. But Michelle Griglione
edged Davies for the win and
Jamie Rugless nosed Kiggans for
third.
The surprise of the day came
a few minutes later when Jorgen
sen beat Longhorns Julie Cooper
and defending NCAA champion
Leigh Ann Fetter in the 100 free
style.
"I would say the only swim that
surprised me was Janel's 100
free," Texas Coach Mark Schubert
said. "That was the most impres
sive."

and Amy Shaw, the American
record holder. Her time was 3Vfe
seconds faster than she had ever
swum before coming to Stanford
and is the fastest collegiate mark
in the event this year.
Next, in the 500 freestyle,
Kraemer again passed Arris 50
yards from the end of the race,
givimg her a second-place finish
behind Evans. The one-two finish
also cliched the dual meet with
four events remaining.
"Overall I think Stanford just
did a little better job than we did
of rising to the occasion,"
Schubert said. "I think [Texas]
will be better by the end of the
season. I'm confident of that."
The NCAA Championships will
be hosted by Texas March 15-17.
The Cardinal is the defending
champion but the team doesn't
think repeating is assured. "I
think our team is really getting
excited for NCAAs," Heisick said.
"But everyone on our team knows
what matters is what we do in
March, so we can't get too confi
dent."
"I think that we have the mo
mentum going to give us a real
good feeling going into NCAAs,"
Quick said. "You have to keep
improving from here. These times
are going to look mediocre in five
weeks. . . . [Texas has] a great
team and they'll be ready for
NCAAs."
