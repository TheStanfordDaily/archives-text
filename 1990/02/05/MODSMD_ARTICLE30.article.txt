# Card brands Longhorns
## No. 1 swimmers mutilate second-ranked Texas 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Saturday's swim meet at
deGuerre Pool was expected to be
a tough battle between the Stan
ford women and their counter
parts from Texas.
The Cardinal was ranked No.
1 in the coaches' poll and the
Lady Longhorns No. 2, while
Swimming World magazine had it
the other way around. Addition
ally, the two teams have combined
to win the last seven national
titles, and neither has finished
worse than third in the eight
years the NCAA has conducted a
championship meet.
Unfortunately, no one told
Stanford it was supposed to be a
close, exciting meet. The Cardinal
opened up a 43-9 lead after only
six events and cruised to a lop
sided 93-47 win over the Lady
Longhorns.

"I honestly didn't think the
score would be like that," Stan
ford Coach Richard Quick said.
"We won the close races and we
came from behind to get points."
Despite cold weather and over
cast skies, seven pool records were
set in front of the school-record
1800 spectators. And proving that
Stanford will be a national power
for years to come, three Cardinal
freshman combined to win seven
events and set five of those
records.
Janel Jorgensen won the 100-
yard and 200 freestyles as well as
the 200 individual medley, and set
a pool record in the IM. Her time
eclipsed the previous record set
in 1980 by Janet Buchan, who is

now known as Mrs. John Elway.
Lori Heisick won both breast
stroke events, setting a pool record
in the 200, and Janet Evans won
both the 1000 and 500 freestyles.
Evans' split at the midpoint of
the 1000 was so fast that it set
a pool record in the 500, and while
the second half of her swim was
not as fast, she still came in only
five seconds off her American
record.
"I think I took it out a little
too fast," she said. "Next time I'll
know. But I was still happy with
my time."
The time in the 1000 was both
a school and pool record, while
her 500 record lasted only an hour
before she broke it again in the
actual event.
Stanford opened the meet with
the team of Anne Mahoney,
Heisick, Suzy Buckovich and Jor
