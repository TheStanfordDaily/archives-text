# Men swimmers drop two
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
If you look only at the scoring of this
weekend's dual meets in Los Angeles, the
men's swimming team certainly did not
perform like one of the NCAA favorites.
No. 8 UCLA swam away from the Cardinal
64-48 on Friday afternoon, and then No.
2 USC sent Stanford reeling 76-37.
But, before giving up hope that this Car
dinal team has suddenly lost all of its cham
pionship form, listen to standout
sophomore Jeff Rouse: "We'll put this
weekend behind us because we all know
we're going to swim faster at the end of
the year. They [USC] like to think they're
going to beat us at Pac-lOs and NCAAs,
but I just can't see that happening. This
team is going to come together real well
at the end."
Despite the problems with scoring, the
Cardinal did continue to make progress
toward its projected times for the end of
the season. In the losing effort against
UCLA, Stanford recorded nine season-best
times, and, against USC, the Cardinal con
tinued to produce some impressive individ
ual efforts, particularly senior Byron
Burson's fast splits as an anchor for the
relays.
In the opening meet, the Cardinal slipped
up with a few injurious mathematical er-

Men's Swimming

Bruins 64, Cardinal 48
Trojans 76, Cardinal 37

rors. As the meet headed toward the final
event, the 400 free relay, the Cardinal staff
determined that the team did not need
senior John Witchel, who had already swum
two events, to compete in the 500 freestyle.
Instead of accruing points against the
Bruins, Witchel rested for Saturday's meet,
leaving Cardinal victory to the performance
of the final relay team. Unfortunately for
Stanford, by the time the relay lined up
for the concluding event, the Bruins had
pulled far enough ahead that Stanford
could not catch them. Regardless, UCI..A
put a lid on the meet by winning the relay.
"Of course the UCLA meet was a dis
appointment," Rouse said. "But that one
specific event was just one error amongst
a lot of other little things; if a couple people
had swum faster or if we had done things
differently in the lineup, we would have
still won."
Saturday, the Cardinal ran into one of
the best dual meet squads in the country.
With a 9-0 dual meet record, the Trojans
have established themselves as a
definite contender for the NCAA
title.
"USC was really strong - no
holes in their line-up at all." junior
J.B. Barr said. "Any time we had
a really good swim, they came
back with a better one."
The Cardinal 400 medley relay
team, composed of Rouse, junior
Matt Rodgers and seniors Doug
Lillydahl and Burson, opened the
USC meet by finishing nearly two
seconds ahead of the Trojan relay
with a 3:19.40, just under the
NCAA qualifying time of 3:19.62.

Witchel built off of this victory
to win the 1000 freestyle in
9:10.76, a Cardinal season-best.
Stanford's momentum came to
abrupt halt in the next race as
Olympian Dan Jorgensen began
the Trojan onslaught with a 200
freestyle victory. USC ran off a
string of victories in nine events,
including one and three-meter
diving. Only junior Matt Rodgers
was able to break the streak in
the second-to-last event by record
ing a 2:04.82 in the 200 breast
stroke.
"Even though things didn't
really go our way this weekend,
I reaily don't think this weekend
really changed things that much
when it comes down to Pac-lOs
or NCAAs," Barr said.
