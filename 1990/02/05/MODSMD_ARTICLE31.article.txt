# Men swimmers drop two
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
If you look only at the scoring of this
weekend's dual meets in Los Angeles, the
men's swimming team certainly did not
perform like one of the NCAA favorites.
No. 8 UCLA swam away from the Cardinal
64-48 on Friday afternoon, and then No.
2 USC sent Stanford reeling 76-37.
But, before giving up hope that this Car
dinal team has suddenly lost all of its cham
pionship form, listen to standout
sophomore Jeff Rouse: "We'll put this
weekend behind us because we all know
we're going to swim faster at the end of
the year. They [USC] like to think they're
going to beat us at Pac-lOs and NCAAs,
but I just can't see that happening. This
team is going to come together real well
at the end."
Despite the problems with scoring, the
Cardinal did continue to make progress
toward its projected times for the end of
the season. In the losing effort against
UCLA, Stanford recorded nine season-best
times, and, against USC, the Cardinal con
tinued to produce some impressive individ
ual efforts, particularly senior Byron
Burson's fast splits as an anchor for the
relays.
In the opening meet, the Cardinal slipped
up with a few injurious mathematical er-

rors. As the meet headed toward the final
event, the 400 free relay, the Cardinal staff
determined that the team did not need
senior John Witchel, who had already swum
two events, to compete in the 500 freestyle.
Instead of accruing points against the
Bruins, Witchel rested for Saturday's meet,
leaving Cardinal victory to the performance
of the final relay team. Unfortunately for
Stanford, by the time the relay lined up
for the concluding event, the Bruins had
pulled far enough ahead that Stanford
could not catch them. Regardless, UCI..A
put a lid on the meet by winning the relay.
"Of course the UCLA meet was a dis
appointment," Rouse said. "But that one
specific event was just one error amongst
a lot of other little things; if a couple people
had swum faster or if we had done things
differently in the lineup, we would have
still won."
Saturday, the Cardinal ran into one of
the best dual meet squads in the country.
With a 9-0 dual meet record, the Trojans
