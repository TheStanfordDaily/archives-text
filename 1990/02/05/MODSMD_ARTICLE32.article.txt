# Men's gymnastics romps in San Jose
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team has been plagued by injuries,
but that has not stopped them from
winning. The Cardinal traveled down
to San Jose Friday and behind a
strong performance by U.S. Open
Champion Tim Ryan scored 276.10 to
easily beat California, Air Force, and
the host Spartans.
"None of them were that good,"
junior Dave Neithardt said. "It wasn't
a peak meet for us, still, we did really
well."
Injuries to Tim Wang and Adam
Foreman have taken away some of
the team's depth, but not much was
needed on Friday. The strength of the
Cardinal program was evident in the
all-around as Ryan, Charles Loop, and
Jair Lynch scored 56.55, 56.40, and
55.50 respectively to finish 1-2-3.

Neithardt, put in the all-around be
cause of the injuries to Wang and
Foreman, was the next at ninth.
This dominance spread over into
the team competition, as Stanford
swept all six events. Only the vault
was close, with the Cardinal barely
outscoring the Bears of Berkeley 45.65
to 45.35. Not that it mattered much
— the event was the last of the day
for the Cardinal and only a series of
face plants would have kept the Car
dinal away from victory.
Leading the way for the team was
national champ Ryan. Despite wrist
problems, the sophomore had a "great,
great meet" according to Neithardt.

The highlight came in the high bar
when Ryan performed a full twisting
genger to score a 9.8. The genger, one
of the hardest moves in the sport, has
the gymnast come off the bar and
perform a back flip with a full twist
before catching the bar on his way
down.
Teammate Conrad Voorsanger was
on track to challenge Ryan for high
bar dominance, but had some trouble
with his routine. Voorsanger tried to
perform his self created "Voor
hanger", but lost his grip on the bar
and the judges "only" gave him a 9.1.
"He should have had it," Neithardt
said. "He didn't have one of his best
meets."
"Best", of course, is a relative term.
Voorsanger competed in five of the
events and scored above 9.0 in every
one except the pommel horse, where
he had a 8.45.
