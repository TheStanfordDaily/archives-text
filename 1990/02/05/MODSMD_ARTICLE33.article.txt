# Central valley foes overwhelm grapplers

### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestlers were
hoping to learn how good they
were this weekend as they
faced their toughest competi
tion this season. Unfortunately
for the Cardinal, the weekend
was a learning experience.
Stanford lost to 12th-ranked
Cal State-Bakersfield yester
day, and to 22nd-ranked
Fresno State on Saturday. The
defeats dropped the Cardinal's
dual meet record to 8-4, snap
ping their five dual meet win
streak.
In the Saturday match
versus Fresno State, a combi
nation of excellent wrestling by
the Bulldogs, and a lackluster
team performance by Stanford
resulted in a 28-6 Fresno State
blowout.
The only two Cardinal vic
tories were garnered by Steve
Buddy and Ron Perry. Buddy
dropped down a weight class
(from 177 to 167), and the
change did not harm his effec
tiveness. Buddy defeated the
Bulldogs' Scott Boness, 8-3.
Ron Perry (190) was the
other Cardinal victor. He han
dled Scott Benson of Fresno
State to capture a convincing
9-4 decision.

(158) was impressive in defeat.
Early in the match he lead the
Bulldogs' Wade Zimmerman,
who is ranked fourth in the
nation. Topham wound up
losing the bout, 7-4, but Coach
Chris Horpel was pleased with
his tenacious effort. "We
needed to have Topham's atti
tude up and down the line-up
to win," he said.
The team's attitude im
proved yesterday, but it was
not enough to knock off Cal
State-Bakersfield. The
Roadrunners downed Stanford
25-11.
The highlights of the Cal
State-Bakersfield match oc
curred in the 126 and
150-pound weight classes.
Stanford's Josh Lisle encoun
tered a talented Ahmed
El-Sokkary and won a decision,
4-3.
Geoff Baum (150) of Stan
ford took on the Roadrunners'
Leonard Sisneros and came
away with a 13-7 victory. Hor
pel said that he was pleased
with the performance of both
wrestlers.
