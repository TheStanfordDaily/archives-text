# No. 2 Spikers impale upstart Matadors

### Harold Yu Staff writer 
You know you're in trouble
when your number one hitter gets
blocked to the ground by the op
posing team's setter .. . who's 5-
foot-11 .. . and defending alone.
But Cardinal setter Parker
Blackman's defensive heroics
seemed to be the least of No. 9
Cal State-Northridge's worries
Saturday night at Burnham Pa
vilion, as Stanford (1-1) deflated
the upstart squad in straight
games, 15-11, 15-12, 15-5.
Discussing the prospects of his
team that had just come off vic
tories against No. 1 UCLA and

Men's Volleyball

Cardinal 15 15 15
Matadors 11 12 5 ,

No. 7 Pepperdine, Northridge
coach John Price was alarmingly
reserved prior to the game.
"In the last two weeks, we've
been playing extremely well,"
Coach Price explained. "But Stan
ford is a pretty experienced and
poised team. They're tough to
spurt on. I think if both teams
play great, either team could win.
But 1 think they're capable of
blowing us out whereas we're not

capable of blowing them out."
Price may have been underes
timating his own team's abilities.
The No. 2 Cardinal had noticeable
difficulty in pulling ahead of
Northridge during the first game.
The two teams rallied back and
forth exhanging numerous side
outs and maintained a close 6-6
game score.
Northridge then ebbed ahead by
displaying some of the firepower
it had used in upstaging the top
ranked Bruins. Sparked by several
kills from standout freshman
Coley Kyman, the Matadors com
mandeered the lead at 10-9.
Senior All-American Dan
Hanan, who finished the match

with a torrid .462 hitting percent
age, sought to change matters and
managed to do so with a
momentum-shifling kill at 11-11
and another at 12-11.
From there, Northridge seemed
confused by the intricate offense
run by senior setter Parker Black
man. The Cardinal scored three
consecutive times to end the
game.
The blowout possibility that oc
cupied the attentions of Price
before the match appeared to take
shape at the beginning of the sec
ond game. Stanford raced ahead
to a 6-2 advantage made ever
more pleasant by a crowd-pleasing
David Goss-Dan Hanan block. Un
nerved, Northridge answered with
a streak of its own and actually
pulled ahead at 7-6. Swing hitter
Duncan Blackman then il
lustrated why he was last year's
National Freshman of the Year,
digging a fierce hit at 8-7 and
then re-entering the same play to
offer a kill of his own. A Craig
Forsyth block at 11-8 placed the
game safely within Stanford's
grasp.
The Cardinal surrendered the
first three points of the final game
but responded with a match
clinching run of ten consecutive
points. Middle blocker Forsyth
repossesed the ball as he ham
mered several impressive kills in
the streak and pounded two
Northridge smashes back to their
turf.
Despite the three-game sweep,
Parker Blackman was quick to
point out that the Cardinal per
formance was below its norm of
excellence. "We were 60 or 70 per
cent of what we are capable of,"
Blackman said. "We play in
streaks. Our number one priority
is to avoid being a streaky team."
Others were more content with
the results, emphasizing the
quality of the opponent.
"We came out really strong. In
the first game, we both played
well," outside hitter Dave Goss
said, "But after th< first game,
Northridge really diun't have the
intensity."
