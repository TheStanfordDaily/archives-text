# Netters go up 3-0, get rained out

### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
It poured Saturday but not
before freshman Jonathan Stark
reigned, overpowering the na
tion's No. 2-rankec* player, Uni
versity of San Diego's Jose-Luis
Noriega, 6-3, 7-6.
Stark's victory came only mo
ments before Saturday's match be
tween top-ranked Stanford and
No. 17 USD was called on account
of rain.
The cancelled match, in which
the Cardinal held a 3-0 lead, will
not count on either team's record,
although the completed singles
matches will impact individual
records.
Sophomore Alex O'Brien and
senior John Connolly also re
corded wins before play was
halted.
Stark, who had beaten Noriega
earlier in the season at the Volvo
All-American Tournament in

Georgia, said he was pleased with
his play, especially in the second
set tiebreaker.
After winning the first set,
Stark jumped out to an early 4-0
lead in the second. At 4-0, how
ever, Noriega started a comeback
and eventually went up 6-5. "I got
a little tight [after being up 4-o],"
Stark said. "Then he got a little
momentum going. I was up 15-40
on his serve twice but couldn't
do anything."
After tying Noriega at 6-all,
Stark recorded an early mini
break and won two easy service
points to advance to a 3-0 lead.
Despite two pinpoint passing shots
by Noriega, Stark's overpowering
serve and touch volleys proved too
much as the Cardinal star went
on to score a 7-3 win in the tie
breaker.
"I tried to play very aggres
sively in the tiebreaker," said
Stark, who currently is ranked
sixth in the ITCA/Volvo Tennis

rankings. "I wanted to put a lot
of pressure on him and make sure
to get some first serves in."
At the No. 2 singles spot,
O'Brien dominated San Diego's
Chris Toomey, 6-4, 6-2. "Alex
played a great match, especially
in terms of putting pressure on
his opponent," Stanford Coach
Richard Gould said. "He was all
over the short balls."
Connolly, who saw limited ac
tion in 1989, proved that he could
make a significant impact, scoring
an easy win over USD's No. 6-
ranked player, Thomas Simonsen,
6-3, 6-1.
"[Connolly's win] was key for
us," Gould said. "Considering that
we had two guys out of the singles
lineup, we needed a solid effort
from John, and he gave it to us."
In other tennis news, Stanford
freshmen phenoms Stark and
Alexis Hombrecher, will compete
in the Volvo of San Francisco, to
be held today.

Stark is set to meet former
Stanford NCAA singles champion,
Dan Goldie, immediately follow
ing a 7:30 p.m. match between
Andre "Just Do It" Agassi and
Ramesh Krishnan. The winner of
the Stark-Goldie match will prob
ably square off against Agassi
Tuesday or Wednesday.
Hombrecher, who will meet a
qualifier, will not play today.
Jared Palmer, another Cardinal
freshman, was asked to compete
in the Volvo tournament but could
not due to injury.
"I think either guy could win,"
Gould said of the match between
Stark and Goldie. "[Goldie] was
No. 27 in the world last year and
reached the quarterfinals of Wim
beldon, but I don't think John
will be intimidated. It really could
go either way."
The Volvo tournament will be
held at the Civic Center in San
Francisco, and tickets are still
available.
