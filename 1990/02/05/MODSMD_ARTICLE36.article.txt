# Track and field takes off in style

### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
Some of Stanford's track and
field athletes got their first taste
of competition over the weekend,
and they're hungry for more. De
spite some impressive showings,
the Cardinal runners are not
satisfied.
Most of the competition was at
indoor meets in South Bend, Ind.
and Baton Rouge, La. Though the
events will not count as team com
petition, they gave the Cardinal
athletes a chance to gauge them
selves in an environment more
competitive than practice.
Although, as Coach Brooks

Johnson pointed out, "Indoors is
not our thing," many of the Car
dinal held their own at the meets.
"Down Under," at the British
Commonwealth Games in
Australlia, David Strang and his
46.4-second split helped the Scot
tish 1600-meter relay team set a
new Scottish record while placing
second.
At Notre Dame, two Cardinal
runners set new school records
for their events. Alex Acceta
smashed his own record in the
800-meters by nearly two seconds
with a 1:50.25 time, and James
Cramton flew around the covered
oval for a record 48.18 time in
the 400-meters. Acceta's time was

good for a spot at the NCAA In
doors.
Finally, at Louisiana State's in
door track, several of the Cardinal
placed in the top six in their
events. Peggy Odita and Rhonda
Oliver each captured sixth place
in their events, the 110-meter
hurdles and 200-meters, respec
tively.
Peter Kolotouros seized fifth
place in the 55-meter hurdles, and
John Hopkins grabbed fourth
place in the high jump, with a
leap of 6-foot-8.
Chryste Gaines garnered a
second-place finish in the 55-
meter dash with a time of 6.93
seconds, but missed the NCA

qualifying time by about a tenth
of a second.
Jodie Bilotta, who has been
working out with world distance
champion and former Cardinal
star Patti Sue Plummer, first sped
to a 4:55 mile mark, good enough
for second place in that event. She
then won the 800-meters with a
2:14.7 time.
Bilotta was ambivalent about
her performance. "It wasn't great,
but I was happy with how it
went. . . . I'll take it," she said.
Johnson said that Stanford's
task now is "to get tuned up for
the Bay Area Relays at Cal. We're
poised to do a decent job there."
