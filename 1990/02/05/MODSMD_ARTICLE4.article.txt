Listing self-image, drugs and
understanding of economics as
the three greatest problems af
fecting black Americans, nation
ally renowned educator and
author Jawanza Kunjufu pre
sented his analysis of the black
situation in America and offered
several solutions to the problems
he sees.
Kuryufu's Saturday speech was
the first mtyor event of Black Lib
eration Month 1990, the theme
of which is "It Begins from
Within: A Black Introspection."
Kunjufu attacked the idea that
drug abuse is predominantly a
problem in the black community,
asserting that of the 35 million
drug users in America, nearly 23

million are white.
To keep black youths from
using drugs, Kui\jufu offered a
five-point plan:
• Close the door for drug entry
into the United States,
• Encourage youths to emulate
leaders such as Malcolm X and
Martin Luther King, Jr.,
• Make it illegal for stores to
sell drug paraphernalia,
• Donate money seized during
drug busts to community drug
prevention programs, not to police
forces and
• Follow the example of men
such as Louis Farrakhan, who
believes stopping drug sales is the
job of the community, not the
police.
Drawing from several examples,
Kunjufu said black Americans

have the responsibility to reshape
the current economic structure in
America. "Though Afro-
Americans make up only 12 per
cent of the total population," he
said, "they purchase between 40
and 52 percent of all movie tickets.
But not one production studio is
owned by a black man."
According to Kunjufu's es
timates, nearly $280 billion is

earned by black Americans each
year, but 93 percent of this money
ends up in the hands of white
controlled corporations.
He believes blacks should stop
this interracial cash flow by start
ing "black businesses" and buying
"black products." These actions,
he said, would help black America
achieve some level of economic
and political equality.
The greatest problem facing
black America today, according to
Kunjufu, is the concept of self
image. Black youths must not be
lieve that "acting smart is acting
white, that natural beauty is
blonde hair, blue eyes and light
complexion and that white men
were responsible for the progress
