# Bush budget bad news for financial aid

Although the overall budget fig
ure for education is up, President
Bush's fiscal year 1991 budget
brings more bad news than good
for higher education, according to
Robert Huff, director of financial
aids.
The mtyor improvement under
the 1991 budget is an increase for
funding of the Pell Grant pro
gram. "Although funding has
gone up a bit, the program was
underfunded to begin with," said
Huff.
He said he considers any in
crease in funds an improvement,
but "the increases must be viewed
in context of the prior insufficient
funding of the program."
A $28 million increase for the

Three things make
Huff 'nervous'
about the Bush
budget.

Trio program, which includes
Head Start, is another improve
ment of the new budget."I com
mend all efforts of the Bush
administration in helping under
privileged students through this
program," said HufT.
However, aside from these im
provements, there are three
things that make Huff "nervous"
about the Bush budget:

• Funding for the Guaranteed
Student Loan program, also
known as the Stafford loan pro
gram, is down. The justification
for this cut is the expectation that
actual revenues will not be af
fected due to a projected decrease
in interest rates. If the projected
decrease does not materialize, the
program will be hurt.
• There is no new funding for
the Perkins loan program. This
will not allow that program "to
keep pace with rising education
costs," said Huff.
• "Cutbacks in state scholarship
programs are another mtyor prob
lem with the new budget," Huff
said. If less student funding is
provided by the states, "the Uni


George Bush
versity will have to pick up the
slack."
A coalition of 100 education lob
byists, known as the Committee
on Education Funding, said prob
lems in education demanded an
increase of $30.5 billion, accord

ing to a Jan. 31 article in The
Chronicle of Higher Education.
However, the committee's request
for a $2.5 billion increase last year
was largely ignored, the article
noted.
Regardless of the Bush budget,
"the University has a strong com
mitment to meet the demonstra
ted need of all its students," said
Huff. The decreases in federal

funding will be met by drawing
upon general University funds.
These funds are not likely to
be diverted from other programs,
Huff noted. "Since the Universi
ty's operating budget increases
every year, the necessary funds
will probably be taken from the
incremental increase in revenue
rather than a cutback in existing
allocations," said Huff.
