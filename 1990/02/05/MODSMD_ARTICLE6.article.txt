# Campus bats aren't only in the belfry

The Oct. 17 earthquake may
have intensified the student
housing crunch, yet thousands
of unofficial residents call Stan
ford "home" â€” and increasing
numbers are arriving daily.
"The*bats are everywhere on
campus," says Richard Skalski,
field representative for the
Crane Pest Control Co. "The
old Quad, specifically, is where
quite a few bats live. They stay
under the roof tiles of the old
buildings."
There have also been numer
ous bat sightings around Hoo
ver Tower and the campus
libraries.
From the early 1970s to
1985, the bats heavily popula
ted the inside of Meyer Library.
"Plenty of times, students
would get freaked out at
them," recalls Kathy Fehrn, of
fice manager of the library.
"This is understandable, be
cause the students would be
sitting there studying and a bat
would dive-bomb them. And
some students became very
cavalier about the whole thing.
They'd say 'Oh, yeah . . .
there's another bat.' "
Apparently, the bats con
tracted their bodies to about
the size of a pencil to inhabit
tiny spaces and grooves in the
library where the walls met the
ceilings. "Once they are in
here, boy, they multiply like
crazy, and then you've got bat
grandchildren you've got to

work at getting out," Fehrn
says."The staff became very
expert at popping wastebaskets
over them."
The bounty of bats eventu
ally led the University to con
tract Crane Pest Control Co.
for the great Bat Exclusion
Project. The project involved
installing screens, and
resealing and recaulking win
dows and other openings under
the eaves of the library.
"The University spent a
great deal of money on the proj
ect, and as far as I can tell, it
kept them out of the library,"
Fehrn says. "Believe me, we'd
know it if we had them back
again."
Before the exclusion project
began, the bats oyoyed spend
ing their evenings swooping in
circles under Meyer's spacious
skylight. "There were hun
dreds that would come out at
night. They kept flying back
and forth trying to find a place
to rest. They really move, those
little critters," Fehrn says.
The bats also would fly
through the connecting base
ment from Meyer to Green Li
brary's south stack. "A bat
occasionally migrates and
winds up in Green. I don't
think we've had anything as
extensive as the problem in
Meyer, though," says Eric
Heath, reference specialist at
Green.
Last year, several bats left
