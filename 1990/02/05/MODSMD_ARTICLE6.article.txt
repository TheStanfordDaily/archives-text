# Campus bats aren't only in the belfry
## 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
The Oct. 17 earthquake may
have intensified the student
housing crunch, yet thousands
of unofficial residents call Stan
ford "home" — and increasing
numbers are arriving daily.
"The*bats are everywhere on
campus," says Richard Skalski,
field representative for the
Crane Pest Control Co. "The
old Quad, specifically, is where
quite a few bats live. They stay
under the roof tiles of the old
buildings."
There have also been numer
ous bat sightings around Hoo
ver Tower and the campus
libraries.
From the early 1970s to
1985, the bats heavily popula
ted the inside of Meyer Library.
"Plenty of times, students
would get freaked out at
them," recalls Kathy Fehrn, of
fice manager of the library.
"This is understandable, be
cause the students would be
sitting there studying and a bat
would dive-bomb them. And
some students became very
cavalier about the whole thing.
They'd say 'Oh, yeah . . .
there's another bat.' "
Apparently, the bats con
tracted their bodies to about
the size of a pencil to inhabit
tiny spaces and grooves in the
library where the walls met the
ceilings. "Once they are in
here, boy, they multiply like
crazy, and then you've got bat
grandchildren you've got to

work at getting out," Fehrn
says."The staff became very
expert at popping wastebaskets
over them."
The bounty of bats eventu
ally led the University to con
tract Crane Pest Control Co.
for the great Bat Exclusion
Project. The project involved
installing screens, and
resealing and recaulking win
dows and other openings under
the eaves of the library.
"The University spent a
great deal of money on the proj
ect, and as far as I can tell, it
kept them out of the library,"
Fehrn says. "Believe me, we'd
know it if we had them back
again."
Before the exclusion project
began, the bats oyoyed spend
ing their evenings swooping in
circles under Meyer's spacious
skylight. "There were hun
dreds that would come out at
night. They kept flying back
and forth trying to find a place
to rest. They really move, those
little critters," Fehrn says.
The bats also would fly
through the connecting base
ment from Meyer to Green Li
brary's south stack. "A bat
occasionally migrates and
winds up in Green. I don't
think we've had anything as
extensive as the problem in
Meyer, though," says Eric
Heath, reference specialist at
Green.
Last year, several bats left
the libraries and infiltrated stu
dent housing. For instance, Bar
ney the Bat victimized residents
of Toyon Hall last winter quarter.
Junior John May suspects that
the unusual visitor spent a week
residing in his closet.
"We had squirrels and dogs and
stuff running through our hall
way occasionally, but never a bat,"
he says.
Barney "would tear up and
down the hall every night," May
adds. "A huge crowd would gath
er, then, as he approached, every
one would duck. It was like an
air show. He'd make a few runs,
then disappear. He basically
scared the hell out of everybody."
Eventually, Toyon residents
rallied and organized a group of
students who chased Barney out
of a window, using a large pole.
Skalski identifies Barney and
his friends as brown bats, which
fit into the larger category of
"house bats." These nocturnal
mammals devour enormous

amounts of insects and live in
colonies.
The bats pose little danger to
the well-being of the Stanford
campus, as they are a relatively
harmless species. Yet, the Verte
brate Pest Control Handbook,
produced by the Division of Plant
Industry, State of California,
warns that "Bats can carry rabies
.. . there ib evidence that exposure
of abraded skin to bat urine . . .
may be infective."
But, students need not worry
about the possibility of a bat
skulking into their rooms at night
and drinking their blood or other
precious bodily fluids. According
to the handbook, "As there are
no true bloodsucking bats in the
United States, a bite is unlikely
unless one is handling or other
wise disturbing bats."
Skalski savs he does not think
Stanford has rampant bat diffi
culties. "It's only a mild bat prob
lem," he says."The Palo Alto area
is a good climate for them."
And, most students are com
pletely oblivious to the invasion
of the campus bats. "I didn't even
know there were bats on campus,"
says freshman Susan Helfter.

air show. He'd make a few runs,
then disappear. He basically
scared the hell out of everybody."
Eventually, Toyon residents
rallied and organized a group of
students who chased Barney out
of a window, using a large pole.
Skalski identifies Barney and
his friends as brown bats, which
fit into the larger category of
"house bats." These nocturnal
mammals devour enormous

amounts of insects and live in
colonies.
The bats pose little danger to
the well-being of the Stanford
campus, as they are a relatively
harmless species. Yet, the Verte
brate Pest Control Handbook,
produced by the Division of Plant
Industry, State of California,
warns that "Bats can carry rabies
.. . there ib evidence that exposure
of abraded skin to bat urine . . .
may be infective."
But, students need not worry
about the possibility of a bat
skulking into their rooms at night
and drinking their blood or other
precious bodily fluids. According
to the handbook, "As there are
no true bloodsucking bats in the
United States, a bite is unlikely
unless one is handling or other
wise disturbing bats."
Skalski savs he does not think
Stanford has rampant bat diffi
culties. "It's only a mild bat prob
lem," he says."The Palo Alto area
is a good climate for them."
And, most students are com
pletely oblivious to the invasion
of the campus bats. "I didn't even
know there were bats on campus,"
says freshman Susan Helfter.
The Oct. 17 earthquake may
have intensified the student
housing crunch, yet thousands
of unofficial residents call Stan
ford "home" — and increasing
numbers are arriving daily.
"The*bats are everywhere on
campus," says Richard Skalski,
field representative for the
Crane Pest Control Co. "The
old Quad, specifically, is where
quite a few bats live. They stay
under the roof tiles of the old
buildings."
There have also been numer
ous bat sightings around Hoo
ver Tower and the campus
libraries.
From the early 1970s to
1985, the bats heavily popula
ted the inside of Meyer Library.
"Plenty of times, students
would get freaked out at
them," recalls Kathy Fehrn, of
fice manager of the library.
"This is understandable, be
cause the students would be
sitting there studying and a bat
would dive-bomb them. And
some students became very
cavalier about the whole thing.
They'd say 'Oh, yeah . . .
there's another bat.' "
Apparently, the bats con
tracted their bodies to about
the size of a pencil to inhabit
tiny spaces and grooves in the
library where the walls met the
ceilings. "Once they are in
here, boy, they multiply like
crazy, and then you've got bat
grandchildren you've got to

work at getting out," Fehrn
says."The staff became very
expert at popping wastebaskets
over them."
The bounty of bats eventu
ally led the University to con
tract Crane Pest Control Co.
for the great Bat Exclusion
Project. The project involved
installing screens, and
resealing and recaulking win
dows and other openings under
the eaves of the library.
"The University spent a
great deal of money on the proj
ect, and as far as I can tell, it
kept them out of the library,"
Fehrn says. "Believe me, we'd
know it if we had them back
again."
Before the exclusion project
began, the bats oyoyed spend
ing their evenings swooping in
circles under Meyer's spacious
skylight. "There were hun
dreds that would come out at
night. They kept flying back
and forth trying to find a place
to rest. They really move, those
little critters," Fehrn says.
The bats also would fly
through the connecting base
ment from Meyer to Green Li
brary's south stack. "A bat
occasionally migrates and
winds up in Green. I don't
think we've had anything as
extensive as the problem in
Meyer, though," says Eric
Heath, reference specialist at
Green.
Last year, several bats left
the libraries and infiltrated stu
dent housing. For instance, Bar
ney the Bat victimized residents
of Toyon Hall last winter quarter.
Junior John May suspects that
the unusual visitor spent a week
residing in his closet.
"We had squirrels and dogs and
stuff running through our hall
way occasionally, but never a bat,"
he says.
Barney "would tear up and
down the hall every night," May
adds. "A huge crowd would gath
er, then, as he approached, every
one would duck. It was like an
air show. He'd make a few runs,
then disappear. He basically
scared the hell out of everybody."
