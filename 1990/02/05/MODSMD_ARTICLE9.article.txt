# What Leland really had in mind

### 
On education:
"I want this institution to
deal particularly with the wel
fare of the masses. ... The few
very rich can get their educa
tion anywhere. They will be
welcome to this institution if
they come, but the object is
more primarily to reach the
multitude â€” those people who
have to consider the expendi
ture of every dollar."
"That this remedy (the lib
eration of labor from
capitalists) has not been seized
upon and adopted by the
masses of laboring men is due
wholly to the inadequacy of ed
ucational systems. Great social
principles and social forces are
availed of by men only after an
intelligent perception of their
value. It will be the aim of the
University to educate those
who come within its atmos
phere in the direction of
cooperation."
On worker ownership of indus
tries:
"What I believe is, the time
has come when the laboring
men can perform for them
selves the office of becoming
their own employers; that the
employer class is less indispen
sable in the modern organiza
tion of industries because the
laboring men themselves pos
sess sufficient intelligence to
organize into cooperative
relation and enjoy the entire
benefits of their own labor."
"A cooperative association of

men who know how to build a
railroad might be able to take
a contract just as well as a
corporation."
"Each individual member of
a cooperative society, being the
employer of his own labor,
works with that interest which
is inseparable from the new po
sition he enjoys. Each has an
interest in the other; each is
interested in each other's
health, in his sobriety, in his
intelligence, in his general com
petency, and each is a guard
upon the other's conduct.
There would be no idling in a
cooperative workshop."
"In fact cooperation is
merely an extension to the in
dustrial life of our people, of
our great political system of
self-government."
On women's rights:
In founding the University,
Stanford required the trustees
"to afford equal facilities and
give equal advantages in the
University to both sexes."
In reference to Stanford's co
op bill introduced in the Senate
and its benefits for women, he
said, "And if this cooperation
shall relieve them of the tem
porary incapacity arising from
the duties of motherhood, then
their capacity for production
may be utilized to the greatest
extent. Very many of the in
dustries would be open to and
managed as well by women in
their cooperative capacity as by
men."
