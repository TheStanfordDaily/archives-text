# Museum for 'fuzzies' outdated
## Physics Explorama falls into disrepair 
### Katherine Toy Staff writer 
Are you one of those "fuzzies" who keeps
a "techie" past in a carefully-guarded closet?
Perhaps Physics Prof. William Little had
you in mind when he created the Physics
Explorama. Back in the 19705, Little set
out to interest humanities and social science
students in learning bits and pieces of science
— and the Explorama was his answer.
But now the miniature museum, which
is located on the second floor of the Varian
Physics Building, has largely fallen into dis
repair.

Granted, its experiments and displays were
never quite as grand as those of San Fran
cisco's Exploratorium, but back in its
heyday, the Explorama attracted large num
bers of visitors.
"It . .. got rather bothersome with so
many people calling up and wanting tours,"
Little says.
Among the first displays were such ex
amples of 1970s technology as an LED crys
tal wristwatch, a hologram and a color
television set adapted to show vertical traces
that measure sound waves.
Since th«n. the watch has broken and been
discarded, the hologram of a woman in 1970s

clothing has become dated and the novelty
of vertical traces has been dwarfed by
modern computer graphics technology.
Unfortunately, the Explorama's lack of
funds prevents the program from keeping
up with technology.
In 1976, Little received a grant from the
National Science Foundation that, along
with small donations and volunteer labor,
enabled him to create the miniature hands
on museum.

continued upkeep of the program never

materialized, says lab supervisor
Martin La Pointe, who helped
Little create the Explorama and
now tends it in his spare time.
La Pointe admits that some of
the Explorama's displays are
rather antiquated, but he adds
that there is little chance of up
dating them, since they require
incredible amounts of mainte
nance.
"I'd like to see it in top shape,
. . . so when something is out, and
it will usually be out for quite a
while, it troubles me," says La
Pointe.

The maintenance of the Ex
plorama and an occasional new
exhibit cost about a few hundred
dollars a year, taken from the
Physics Department's teaching
funds.
The "newest" gadget is now two
years old — a plasma globe that
La Pointe bought at the Em
porium. "A little while later, I saw
it at the Price Club for about half
the price," he jokes.
Although some of the displays
may seem dated, Little says the
principles they are based on are
as current now as they were in
1976.
Little still talks excitedly about
the Explorama but does not have
the time to devote to the program.
The program needs a new advo

cate to search for and obtain
funds, he says.
"I had hoped that a3 younger
members of the staff came in, that
they would take it (the Ex
plorama) under their wing," he
says.
The Explorama still has occa
sional groups of outside visitors,
most of whom come in school
groups. La Pointe says these stu
dents usually make a day out of
touring the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and then spend
about 15 minutes at the Ex
plorama.

However, most of the Ex
plorama's visitors are Stanford
physics students walking through
the hallway on their way to the
lab.
