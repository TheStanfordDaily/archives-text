# Museum for 'fuzzies' outdated
## Physics Explorama falls into disrepair 
### Katherine Toy Staff writer 
Are you one of those "fuzzies" who keeps
a "techie" past in a carefully-guarded closet?
Perhaps Physics Prof. William Little had
you in mind when he created the Physics
Explorama. Back in the 19705, Little set
out to interest humanities and social science
students in learning bits and pieces of science
— and the Explorama was his answer.
But now the miniature museum, which
is located on the second floor of the Varian
Physics Building, has largely fallen into dis
repair.

Granted, its experiments and displays were
never quite as grand as those of San Fran
cisco's Exploratorium, but back in its
heyday, the Explorama attracted large num
bers of visitors.
"It . .. got rather bothersome with so
many people calling up and wanting tours,"
Little says.
Among the first displays were such ex
amples of 1970s technology as an LED crys
tal wristwatch, a hologram and a color
television set adapted to show vertical traces
that measure sound waves.
Since th«n. the watch has broken and been
discarded, the hologram of a woman in 1970s

clothing has become dated and the novelty
of vertical traces has been dwarfed by
modern computer graphics technology.
Unfortunately, the Explorama's lack of
funds prevents the program from keeping
up with technology.
In 1976, Little received a grant from the
National Science Foundation that, along
with small donations and volunteer labor,
enabled him to create the miniature hands
on museum.
But expected corporate funding for the
continued upkeep of the program never

Lack of funds and interest are the reasons behind the decline of the Physics Explorama. This plasma globe, purchased two years ago,
Is the newest display at the museum, which Is located in the Varian Physics Building.
