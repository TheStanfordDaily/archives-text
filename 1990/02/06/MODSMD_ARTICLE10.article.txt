A day in the life
Pakistani youths experiment with fire as the entire nation went on
strike yesterday to show their solidarity with Kashmiri guerillas fighting
to secede from India. Tensions seem to be mounting as frenzied
Pakistani protesters stormed across the Indo-Pak border in numbers
estimated by the Pakistanis to be about 30,000. The Indian Border
Security Force, however, placed the figure at 4,000. Escalation of the
conflict seems imminent.
