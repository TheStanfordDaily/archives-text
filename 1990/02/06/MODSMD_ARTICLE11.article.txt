# Gorbachev proposes radical party reforms

MOSCOW (AP) - Mikhail S. Gor
bachev told the Communist Party yes
terday it must give up its unchallenged
right to rule the Soviet Union to the
tide of democratic reform he let loose
five years ago.
In a historic speech to the party's
Central Committee in the Kremlin, he
tacitly acknowledged the growing
power of the pro-democracy movement
that has toppled Communist regimes
in Eastern Europe, set several Soviet
republics on the road to multiparty
politics and on Sunday drew huge
protests in Moscow.
But his move was unlikely to bring
about the disintegration of the Com
munist Party, and Gorbachev, who is
both party chief and head of govern
ment, did not address the possibility
of the party losing power.
The party wants to remain the
leading force in society but must prove
its worthiness, earning the right to
govern instead of taking it for granted,
Gorbachev said.
In the future, the party "intends to
struggle for the role of ruling party,
but to do it strictly in the framework
of the democratic process, rejecting
any kind of legal or political advan
tage," Gorbachev said.
Political reform that has strength

ened the Soviet government at the ex
pense of an all-controlling party appa
ratus, "has been accompanied by a
growth in political pluralism," Gorba
chev said, presenting a draft platform
to the 249-member Central Commit
tee.
"This process can lead to the crea
tion of parties at some stage."
Central Committee sources said Gor
bachev told the closed meeting that
political changes he has pushed
through since taking power in March
1985 have in effect created a multi
party system already.
In his speech, Gorbachev called into
question another tenet of Leninism â€”
democratic centralism, the theory that
requires strict adherence by the party's
20 million members to decisions once
they have been made at the top.
"The party's renewal presupposes its
thorough, comprehensive democratiza
tion and rethinking the principle of
democratic centralism with emphasis
on democracy and power of the party
masses," Gorbachev said.
The sources said that in contrast to
usual practice, there was no applause
for Politburo members when they en
tered the hall at the beginning of the
day, nor any applause for any of the
28 speteches during the session.
