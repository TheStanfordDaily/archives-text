JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — The main right-wing political
party exhorted whites yesterday to
mobilize against "the revolutionary,
left-wing announcements" of President
F.W. de Klerk.
Andries Treurnicht, the Conserva
tive Party leader, said South Africa's
5 million whites faced "the hour of
truth." His party applied for a permit
for a mass march in Pretoria on Feb.
15 to launch a "freedom struggle"
aimed at protecting whites from dom
ination by the black majority.
De Klerk, in a momentous speech
last week, lifted bans on more than
60 anti-apartheid groups, including the
African National Congress guerrilla
movement, and promised to free jailed
ANC leader Nelson Mandela in hopes
of clearing the way for negotiations
on black-white power sharing.

In other developments:
• Cabinet ministers said the govern
ment sought a new political system in
which all South Africans had full
voting rights. But they said special
protection would be required for
whites, and they reaffirmed govern
ment support for segregated neighbor
hoods and public schools;
• In Brussels, Belgium, foreign min
isters of the European Community
cautiously welcomed the reforms an
nounced by de Klerk but urged further
measures to dismantle apartheid.
• Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
met in London with Jesse Jackson,
the black American civil rights leader,
who was on his way to South Africa.
A spokesman said she asked him to
carry this message: "Tell Mr. Mandela
how many hopes ride on him for the
future of his country."
