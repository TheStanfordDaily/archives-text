## Money won't float 
### 
YOU CAN'T FILL a lake with
money. But the ASSU senate
seems to want to do just that
with Lake Lagunita.
Last Tuesday, the senate voted
to attend dorm meetings to deter
mine student opinion on the filling
of the lake and said it would con
sider devoting $9,000 of the ASSU
Annual Reserves as matching
funds to help fill it.
Both the senate and University
administrators have said that a
tight budget may prevent a full
lake this year.
Yet by framing the debate in
terms of whether they can raise
the money, they are missing the
real issue: water. It takes water to
fill a lake, and water is scarce in
California. About 80 million gal
lons of water are needed to fill
Lake Lag, according to Cheryl Jen
sen of Operations and Mainte
nance.
No matter how much student
support and student funds the

ASSU can raise, if the rains don't
come, neither will Lake Lag.
Not filling the lake will not cut
down on popular spring quarter
classes like sailing and windsurf
ing. The lake was empty last year,
but both classes were offered with
students conveniently transported
in vans to nearby lakes. The Ath
letic Department plans to do the
same this year.
To fill or not to fill the lake
promises to be as hot an issue as
flag burning in the upcoming
ASSU elections this spring. But a
decision which ultimately rests in
the hands of Mother Nature should
not be seen as a measure of how
committed the senate is to stu
dents.
While it is admirable for senators
to solicit student opinion at dorm
meetings this week, they should
be careful not to waste student
time with politicking and make cer
tain they frame the issue properly:
Water, not student funds will fill
Lake Lag this year.
