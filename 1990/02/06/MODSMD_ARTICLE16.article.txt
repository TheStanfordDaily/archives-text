# No mess, less stress

### 
ONLY ONE QUESTION
needs to be asked concern
ing the proposed elimina
tion of Round Two of the Draw:
Why didn't anyone think of it
sooner?
In the past, the Draw has not
only been stressful but confusing.
Granted, all the anxiety won't dis
appear if the process is shortened,
but the Draw will be less of a
central focus of spring quarter.
Fewer students will be left with
housing they really didn't want
simply because they didn't under
stand the convoluted structure of
Round Two.
Under the proposed system, the
Draw will take place after frater
nity bids have been given and res
ident assistant positions assigned.

This eliminates all the unneces
sary paperwork and hassle that
previously took place once 700 stu
dents dropped out of the Draw.
In addition, the new system
equalizes the situation between the
sexes because women do not have
the opportunity to pledge a housed
fraternity if they draw poorly. Men
will pledge fraternities because
they want to be members, not be
cause they have bad Draw num
bers.
The Draw has always been a
source of tension and arguments,
especially for freshmen. Pushing
the Draw back will simplify Draw
group choices because students will
know beforehand which of their
friends will not live in University
housing.
