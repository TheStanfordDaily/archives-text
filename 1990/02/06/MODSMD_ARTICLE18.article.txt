## Toward colorblind society 
### 
MUCH OF THE LAST month has
been spent trying to determine
what the "legacy" of Martin Lu
ther King is and ought to be. After a
generation since his death, this question
has not been resolved, and much of the
confusion stems from what King's vision
of relations between the races was.
Was it the Martin Luther King of 1963,
the Martin Luther King of the March on
Washington, D.C., who with unsurpassed
eloquence, urged that his children "be
judged by the content of their character,
and not the color of the skin?" It was
precisely this principle of a colorblind
society that captured the imagination of
our country 27 years ago and made the
civil rights legislation of the 1960s pos
sible.
Or was King's vision grounded in a
contradictory principle, that of affirma
tive action?
There are those who claim these two
ideas are compatible and indeed neces
sarily linked. Nonetheless, affirmative ac
tion is fundamentally opposed to the con
cept of a colorblind society. When admis
sion to educational institutions and
hiring decisions take into account the
race of the applicant, it cannot be said
that any of the applicants are being
judged solely by the content of their char
acter.
It is this dissonance to which support
ers of affirmative action must admit.
However, this contradiction does not dis
credit a priori this attempt to reorder
society. Indeed, there are powerful argu
ments which unify these two principles
and produce a compelling rationale for

affirmative action.
With convincing logic, most black
leaders argue that a colorblind society
will only sustain an imbalanced relation
ship between the races unless a level
playing field is established at the outset.
There is an unfortunate aspect to af
firmative action, the problem of the zero
sum game. A quota that mandates hirings
or admissions of minorities greater than
would normally be chosen under a process
that disregards race necessarily impinges
upon the rights of the applicants who are
displaced for no other reason than the
existence of the quota.
This impingement must be justified,
and this is done by pointing to the past
discrimination of minorities. However,
this rationale cannot be used to imple
ment a general program of affirmative
action that reaches across a nation of
vastly different experiences in, rppe rela
tions.
Affirmative action can Oftly bcrjusttfted
if there is very real evidence that minor
ities were denied opportunities in the par
ticular company or university, and if the
affirmative action policy presents a clear
vision of how it plans to rectify the cur
rent imbalance.
In a recent decision, the Supreme Court
offered a similar opinion, with Sandra
Day O'Connor requiring that affirmative
action must be "tailored" to the specific
circumstances of each case. This is an
eminently fair and just approach to a
thorny issue. Yet this was decried as an
"erosion" of civil rights, a roll back of
progress already made.
This criticism seems to be patently un
fair, because the "tailor-made" approach

There is an unfortunate
aspect to affirmative ac
tion, the problem of the
zero-sum game.

simply rejects a crude racial spoils system
and puts in its place a more reasonable
and nuanced framework for remedying
past injustices.
If we are to reject this approach, as
many have clearly and vociferously done,
then we will have a policy that is a crude
and sloppy instrument of social change.
The histories of the different areas of the
United States are not uniform, and it
would be ill-conceived to construct an
affirmative action policy that ignores this
fact.
Are we to assume that the history of
racial discrimination was unerringly
Ã¼biquitous? Many communities have long
had an unprejudiced mind, and still
others simply have never had minorities
to discriminate against. Is it, therefore,
unreasonable to object to the rectification
of past injuries that never occurred? I
emphatically say no.
