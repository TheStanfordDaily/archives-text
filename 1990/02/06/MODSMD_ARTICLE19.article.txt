Random drug raids challenging American ideals

WHEN THE DAILY'S Jan. 31
editorial commended Stanford
for its initiation into the na
tion's drug war, The Daily added its
own name to the list of participants in
the drug hysteria which is sweeping
this country.
This editorial called for the police to
simply break down the doors of sus
pected drug users on campus. After all,
the crime of drug use appears so evil
that it must be stopped at any cost,
even if this means abandoning citizens'
rights. The editorial echoes the present
American sentiment to forget the prin
ciple upon which this country claims to
be founded — personal liberties.
The editorial neglected to mention
the benefits of persecuting Stanford's

drug users. It states "many studies of
campus drug use have been done, but
none have offered any clear, hard facts
about the extent of the activity." The
editorial ignores the most important
piece of information which this sen
tence provides.
Drugs have not altered either the
performance of students or the busi
ness of the University in any detec
table manner. The author insists that
Stanford should hunt down users
anyway. Why? Since the user does not
seem to affect the community, perhaps
the writer believes that Stanford's
enforcement of the drug laws helps the
drug user. It is discouraging, if not
surprising, to hear Stanford's newspa
per screaming "jail" instead of "treat-

ment" along with the rest of the na
tion.
The Daily applauds the police for
spending "their time searching for drug
users." These criminals must be rooted
out, arrested and finally threatened
with violation of the Fundamental
Standard. The message is clear. Drug
use is immoral and corrupting, and
therefore any amount of privacy should
be sacrificed to stop it.
The editorial cites the University's
tolerant attitude toward underage
drinking. Once Stanford wins this war
on drugs, should it turn its police loose
on undergraduate dorms? In the future
will The Daily support raids on the
rooms of students suspected of playing

drinking games behind closed doors?
In recent American history, the
public has formed mobs to denounce
other types of behavior they view
immoral. In a rage against homosexu
ality, Georgians upheld the govern
ment's right to invade the privacy of
their bedrooms by declaring sodomy
illegal.
Are any of these acts, including drug
use, worth sacrificing the rights which
Americans are supposed to hold dear?
It terrifies me that Stanford's newspa
per willingly ignores these rights in its
fury to seek out drug users.
