# Asian-American finalist drops out
## 
### Quan Phung Staff writer 
In an announcement that
stunned many in the Asian-
American community, one of
three finalists for the Asian-
American studies professorship
withdrew his candidacy yesterday,
denouncing institutionalized eth
nic studies as "backward."
Speaking to about 70 students
and faculty members at a noon
reception, Cornell Sociology Prof.
Victor Nee said that ethnic studies
should be incorporated into main
stream academic departments
rather than isolated, a situation
that creates "segregation of ethnic
scholars and students who are in
the program."
"I'm not in the field of Asian-
American studies," Nee said. "I
don't teach courses in Asian-
American studies, and I don't plan
to."
In an interview after his pre
sentation, however, Nee said that
he was interested in a position
with Stanford's Sociology Depart
ment, and he might incorporate
research on the Asian-American
community in his teachings.
Nee's announcement startled
and confused many members of
the Asian-American community,
who for more than a year have
been calling for an Asian-
American studies professor. Nee,
one of three finalists for the po
sition, had been invited to speak
about his vision of Asian-
American studies as part of his
interview for the position.
Sylvia Yanagisako, chair of the
search committee, said it was
"disappointing that he did not
want the position."
"I didn't understand why he
was there to begin with," said
junior Anne Chang, Asian Amer
ican Student Association cultural
co-chair.
In his presentation, Nee out
lined his objections to Asian-
American studies as a separate
department.

Nee withdrew his
name from considera
tion, saying that eth
nic studies
segregates ethnic
groups from the
mainstream society.

Nee said that from his experi
ence and observation, ethnic
studies departments at major uni
versities such as UC-Berkeley,
Cornell and UCLA are not
effective.
According to Nee, the institu
tionalized form of ethnic studies
segregates ethnic groups from the
mainstream society, thereby de
feating the purpose of integration
and understanding. He said
"moving backwards would be
damaging to yourselves, and I'm
not interested in moving back
wards with that parochial view of
society."
"Ethnic studies is in a crisis
because it assumes that America
is divided by race," he said. "Eth
nic studies is good as a transi
tional device, but it should be
phased out" as society becomes
more multicultural.
However, he said he is not op
posed to the pursuit of ethnic
studies as a concentration in an
established department. Scholar
ship of Asian-Americans in de
partments such as sociology and
psychology is more comprehensive
when it compares Asian-
Americans with other ethnic
groups, he said."
The search for an Asian-
American studies scholar began
last year after the departure of
Gordon Chang, a history lecturer
who taught Stanford's only Asian-
American studies class, sparked
protests from student groups.
Rick Yuen, assistant dean of
Student Affairs and director of the
Asian American Activities Center,
said he questioned Nee's dedica
tion and commitment to Asian-
American studies. "If (Nee)
wanted to apply for sociology, he
should not have come to the meet
ing," Yuen said.
Anne Chang and AASA chair
Joe Park said they did not under
stand why Nee was even chosen
as a finalist.
"He does not match the goal of
Asian-American studies. That was
why we demonstrated," Anne
Chang said, referring: to last year's
takeover of the president's office.
Park said that he felt frustrated
by Nee's presentation: "His per
spective differed radically from
what we want."
However, Ron Nakao, one of
the two student members of the
search committee, said that some
good came from the experience.
Since Stanford has never dealt
with this issue before, questions
about whether Asian-American
studies be a departmental or in
terdepartmental program are all
part of the learning process, he
said.
Nee's withdrawal leaves only
two finalists who have yet to make
their presentations. In addition to
Gordon Chang, who will give his
presentation Thursday and Friday
this week, the search committee
has invitbd David Liu, an English
professor at Georgetown Univer
sity, to come next week.

Victor Nee, a sociology professor at Cornell, withdraws his can
didacy for the Asian-American studies professorship being offered
at Stanford. Nee was one of three finalists selected for the position.
In an announcement that
stunned many in the Asian-
American community, one of
three finalists for the Asian-
American studies professorship
withdrew his candidacy yesterday,
denouncing institutionalized eth
nic studies as "backward."
Speaking to about 70 students
and faculty members at a noon
reception, Cornell Sociology Prof.
Victor Nee said that ethnic studies
should be incorporated into main
stream academic departments
rather than isolated, a situation
that creates "segregation of ethnic
scholars and students who are in
the program."
"I'm not in the field of Asian-
American studies," Nee said. "I
don't teach courses in Asian-
American studies, and I don't plan
to."
In an interview after his pre
sentation, however, Nee said that
he was interested in a position
with Stanford's Sociology Depart
ment, and he might incorporate
research on the Asian-American
community in his teachings.
Nee's announcement startled
and confused many members of
the Asian-American community,
who for more than a year have
been calling for an Asian-
American studies professor. Nee,
one of three finalists for the po
sition, had been invited to speak
about his vision of Asian-
American studies as part of his
interview for the position.
Sylvia Yanagisako, chair of the
search committee, said it was
"disappointing that he did not
want the position."
"I didn't understand why he
was there to begin with," said
junior Anne Chang, Asian Amer
ican Student Association cultural
co-chair.
In his presentation, Nee out
lined his objections to Asian-
American studies as a separate
department.

Nee withdrew his
name from considera
tion, saying that eth
nic studies
segregates ethnic
groups from the
mainstream society.

Nee said that from his experi
ence and observation, ethnic
studies departments at major uni
versities such as UC-Berkeley,
Cornell and UCLA are not
effective.
According to Nee, the institu
tionalized form of ethnic studies
segregates ethnic groups from the
mainstream society, thereby de
feating the purpose of integration
and understanding. He said
"moving backwards would be
damaging to yourselves, and I'm
not interested in moving back
wards with that parochial view of
society."
"Ethnic studies is in a crisis
because it assumes that America
is divided by race," he said. "Eth
nic studies is good as a transi
tional device, but it should be
phased out" as society becomes
more multicultural.
However, he said he is not op
posed to the pursuit of ethnic
studies as a concentration in an
established department. Scholar
ship of Asian-Americans in de
partments such as sociology and
psychology is more comprehensive
when it compares Asian-
Americans with other ethnic
groups, he said."
The search for an Asian-
American studies scholar began
last year after the departure of
Gordon Chang, a history lecturer
who taught Stanford's only Asian-
American studies class, sparked
protests from student groups.
Rick Yuen, assistant dean of
Student Affairs and director of the
Asian American Activities Center,
said he questioned Nee's dedica
tion and commitment to Asian-
American studies. "If (Nee)
wanted to apply for sociology, he
should not have come to the meet
ing," Yuen said.
Anne Chang and AASA chair
Joe Park said they did not under
stand why Nee was even chosen
as a finalist.
"He does not match the goal of
Asian-American studies. That was
why we demonstrated," Anne
Chang said, referring: to last year's
takeover of the president's office.
Park said that he felt frustrated
by Nee's presentation: "His per
spective differed radically from
what we want."
However, Ron Nakao, one of
the two student members of the
search committee, said that some
good came from the experience.
Since Stanford has never dealt
with this issue before, questions
about whether Asian-American
studies be a departmental or in
terdepartmental program are all
part of the learning process, he
said.
Nee's withdrawal leaves only
two finalists who have yet to make
their presentations. In addition to
Gordon Chang, who will give his
presentation Thursday and Friday
this week, the search committee
has invitbd David Liu, an English
professor at Georgetown Univer
sity, to come next week.
