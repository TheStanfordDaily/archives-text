# Authority of the law requires questioning to give moral guides
## 
### 
The editorial appearing in the Jan.
31 issue of The Daily, entitled "No
Sandstone Tower," dealt with the
recent police raid on the Alpha Delta
Phi house in a simplistic and danger
ous manner. The editorial poses the
question: What should be done in light
of the discovery that drugs are being
sold on the Stanford campus? The
answer given: "The bottom line is that
(drugs) are illegal. ... If students are
found with drugs, the law should take
over."
This answer exemplifies a serious
problem with the attitudes of many
people in our society. It is especially
disheartening when it comes from the
Daily editorial staff, a group of people
with the opportunity to voice opinions
that influence the Stanford community.
We should not judge a situation on the

basis of its legality. The column does
not discuss the possible effects of
drugs. It states outright that the law
is above question, that it is "the bot
tom line."
We cannot consider the law and au
thority to be beyond question. Only
through close examination and con
stant questioning of our law can we
hope to improve the structure of soci
ety.
In response to the Daily editorial
staff, we would like to pose a question:
Where might our country be today if
the students of the 1960s had said
about racial and sexual discrimination,
"The bottom line is that it's legal, so
we should support it?" Perhaps the
lack of personal responsibility in our
society has led to the stagnation and
malaise that we find surrounding us.
