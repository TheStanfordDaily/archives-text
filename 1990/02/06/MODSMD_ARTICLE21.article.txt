# Parking lots lack space and efficiency; unfair for researchers
## 
### 
The current debate over the availa
bility of parking spaces and, in particu
lar, the arguments of the bureaucrats
presiding over the incipient shortage
would be rendered more credible if the
University practiced more efficient use
of space.
I regard being able to park my car
somewhere reasonably close to the
Department of Chemistry as modest
compensation for paying punitive over
head costs for the privilege of doing
research here.
This letter is prompted by the recent
conversion of the ground floor of
Parking Structure 1 from a "C" lot to
an "A" lot, which has merely removed
more than 100 spaces from general
use.
Various bogus arguments have been
proffered as an excuse for this

profiteering, but the fact remains that,
at any time, no more than about 15
percent of the new "A" spaces are
filled, while the remaining "C M floors
become occupied 30 to 45 minutes
earlier than before.
After 9 a.m., it is very nearly impos
sible to park legally within one-fourth
mile of the Chemistry Department if
one is in possession of a "C n lot stick
er.
This obviously penalizes late working
and corresponding late starts the fol
lowing morning. No doubt this situa
tion exists elsewhere on campus.
Perhaps a retrospective look at exist
ing sites, with a view to eliminating
this kind of petty sectarianism, might
come up with a few more spaces.
