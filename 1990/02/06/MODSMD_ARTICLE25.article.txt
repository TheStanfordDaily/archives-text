sity all strum their fingers on
their desks as they sit through
yet another boring history lec
ture. Throughout the land thou
sands of their peers ask the same
question that is racing through
their minds: Why the heck do we
need to study history?
Paul Gagnon's bode "Historical
Literacy: The Case for History in
American Education" provides a
series of persuasive answers to
this perennial question. The book,
a product of the Bradley Commis
sion on History in Schools, is a
valuable contribution to the in
vigorated drive for educational
reform in the United States. Gag
non, a history professor at the
University of Massachusetts, Bos
ton, has compiled several essays
by prominent professors, high
school teachers and educators that
analyze the problems of the his

tory curriculum in American
schools.
Most of the books' arguments
center around the Bradley Com
mission's recommendations for
the improvement of the history
curriculum in primary and sec
ondary education. The recommen
dations point out the flaws of the
present system and provide con
crete measures to correct those
problems. Among these reforms
are:
• a history-centered social studies
in the primary grades (K-6);
• more time devoted to the study
of history during middle and high
school, in order to promote an
understanding of the historical
experiences of people from all the
continents;
• more emphasis on the historical
contributions of minorities and
women;
• the need for college and uni
versity departments of history to
adapt the content and structure
of their programs to adequately
prepare prospective history teach
ers.
The book gives a clear, detailed
account of the transformation of
the history curriculum in schools
at the beginning of the 20th cen
tury. One of the authors, Hazel
Hertzberg, points out the gradual
decline of history in the curricu

lum due to political pressures
from reform-minded leaders, who
stressed the immediate utility of
the subjects learned in school in
stead of the long-term goals of
analytical thinking and historical
perspective. Thus history was
replaced by the more socially use
ful disciplines of civics and social
studies. History was clustered
along with the rest of the new
disciplines that took its place.
The various members of the
Bradley Commission, among
them Gordon Craig, an emeritus
professor of history at Stanford,
advocate a return to a history
oriented curriculum.
The writers propose clear guide
lines for a new history curricu
lum, shun the old social studies
format that emphasizes commu
nity and local history throughout
elementary school and advocate a
curriculum that enables students
to expand their horizons beyond
their personal experiences and
develop empathy for peoples of
different times and places.
The commission also calls for
an expanded role of history in the
higher grades (7-12), following a
sequence that will allow students
to study more thoroughly both
world and Western history.
The commission also proposes
various measures to improve the

teaching of history in schools,
making history more exciting and
accessible to students.
The book does not place respon
sibility on any single sector of ed
ucation, but it indicates the
harmful effects that poor teaching
in the early grades has on students
during secondary and higher ed
ucation.
The book acknowledges, but
does not propose, clear measures
to solve the obstacles to restruc
turing the social studies curricu
lum, such as the conflicting
political pressures and bureau
cratic inertia from teachers and
legislators alike. Also, its proposal
to provide continuity in the study
of history thoughout primary and
secondary schools may not be ef
fective, since students change
schools frequently. Moreover, it
points out, but does not discuss
in depth, how to solve the myriad
of problems that hinder effective
teaching, such as overcrowding,
drug abuse and absenteeism.
Despite these shortcomings,
this practical book should be read
by all those concerned with his
tory and with education. In the
wake of Stanford's You Can Make
a Difference conference on educa
tion, this book would be a timely
complement to anyone's reading
list.

reform in the United States. Gag
non, a history professor at the
University of Massachusetts, Bos
ton, has compiled several essays
by prominent professors, high
school teachers and educators that
analyze the problems of the his

tory curriculum in American
schools.
Most of the books' arguments
center around the Bradley Com
mission's recommendations for
the improvement of the history
curriculum in primary and sec
ondary education. The recommen
dations point out the flaws of the
present system and provide con
crete measures to correct those
problems. Among these reforms
are:
• a history-centered social studies
in the primary grades (K-6);
• more time devoted to the study
of history during middle and high
school, in order to promote an
understanding of the historical
experiences of people from all the
continents;
• more emphasis on the historical
contributions of minorities and
women;
• the need for college and uni
versity departments of history to
adapt the content and structure
of their programs to adequately
prepare prospective history teach
ers.
The book gives a clear, detailed
account of the transformation of
the history curriculum in schools
at the beginning of the 20th cen
tury. One of the authors, Hazel
Hertzberg, points out the gradual
decline of history in the curricu

lum due to political pressures
from reform-minded leaders, who
stressed the immediate utility of
the subjects learned in school in
stead of the long-term goals of
analytical thinking and historical
perspective. Thus history was
replaced by the more socially use
ful disciplines of civics and social
studies. History was clustered
along with the rest of the new
disciplines that took its place.
The various members of the
Bradley Commission, among
them Gordon Craig, an emeritus
professor of history at Stanford,
advocate a return to a history
oriented curriculum.
The writers propose clear guide
lines for a new history curricu
lum, shun the old social studies
format that emphasizes commu
nity and local history throughout
elementary school and advocate a
curriculum that enables students
to expand their horizons beyond
their personal experiences and
develop empathy for peoples of
different times and places.
The commission also calls for
an expanded role of history in the
higher grades (7-12), following a
sequence that will allow students
to study more thoroughly both
world and Western history.
The commission also proposes
various measures to improve the

teaching of history in schools,
making history more exciting and
accessible to students.
The book does not place respon
sibility on any single sector of ed
ucation, but it indicates the
harmful effects that poor teaching
in the early grades has on students
during secondary and higher ed
ucation.
The book acknowledges, but
does not propose, clear measures
to solve the obstacles to restruc
turing the social studies curricu
lum, such as the conflicting
political pressures and bureau
cratic inertia from teachers and
legislators alike. Also, its proposal
to provide continuity in the study
of history thoughout primary and
secondary schools may not be ef
fective, since students change
schools frequently. Moreover, it
points out, but does not discuss
in depth, how to solve the myriad
of problems that hinder effective
teaching, such as overcrowding,
drug abuse and absenteeism.
Despite these shortcomings,
this practical book should be read
by all those concerned with his
tory and with education. In the
wake of Stanford's You Can Make
a Difference conference on educa
tion, this book would be a timely
complement to anyone's reading
list.
