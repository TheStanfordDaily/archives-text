With his latest book, "Eden," Stanislaw
Lem has returned with a novel intended
to provoke the thoughts of readers as
well as entertain them. Anyone familiar
with Lem will not be surprised to find
that he has succeeded in doing both.
Although many writers are multi
talented, a large number of science fiction
writers have an aptitude for an extraordi
nary number of fields. Isaac Asimov, for
instance, is said to have written more
books on more subjects than anyone else.
Gregory Benford, who will probably be
labeled one of the greater science fiction
talents of the last 30 years of the 20th
century, is a professor of physics at the
University of California, Irvine. But Lem
is a breed apart.
Lem, who writes in Polish, is recog
nizably unique for having broken the lan
guage barrier. The works of most foreign -
language fiction writers — of any genre
— tend to appear only as short stories
in modest, unpublicized genre anthologies
of writers in the same language. Only
extraordinarily talented or popular writ
ers tend to break into the American mass
market with any noticeable impact.
Italo Calvino and Umberto Eco ("The
Name of the Rose" and now "Foucault's

Pendulum"), who write in Italian and
Carlos Fuentes (recently "Christopher
Unborn") and Gabriel Garcia Marquez
("One Hundred Days of Solitude" and
"Love in the Time of Cholera"), who write
in Spanish, are all excellent writers, and
some of the very few foreign authors
whose books ever thrive here.
Lem joins the ranks of these authors
as one whose books are successful enough
that his new novels go onto the shelves
of booksellers next to those that have
gone into reprints — and also as one who
is a very talented writer.
And, like Asimov and Benford, Lem is
a man with great scientific knowledge.
He is also well-versed in philosophy and
literature, as excerpts from some of his
shorter tales will immediately impress
upon the reader. But his prose is unlike
Asimov's almost determinedly bland
works and Benford's functional-to-fair
writing.
Lem is a versatile and skilled writer,
another rarity for this genre. He's done
everything in short fiction from comedy
to fable to suspense, often in the same
collection of tales (which tend to share
a character or conceit). His novels range
from mainstream fiction ("Hospital of
the Transfiguration," recently trans
lated), to detective stories ("The Investi
gation") to science fiction (the recent
"Fiasco").
As a novel writer, Lem would tend to
be classified with the "hard" science fic
tion writers, for his incorporation of sci

ence and technology into the story. In
his latest work, "Eden," technology is on
the periphery. Lem chooses instead to
attempt to explicate the alien society in
which his characters are stranded.
The opening chapter is replete with
metaphors for sexual intercourse and
birth. The story begins with a ship shud
dering as it penetrates the enveloping
environment of the atmosphere of the
planet Eden. The rocket plunges headlong
into the soil, and the seven crew members
carried by it emerge from one symbolic
womb after another — from the cocoons
in which they are resting, from the tech
nological traps of their topsy-turvy ship
and finally from the ship itself, through
a tunnel of earth that they excavate, onto
the surface of Eden.
Eden is a strange planet of which little
is known. The crew — all men, referred
to only by their occupations — split their
efforts between exploring the planet and
repairing their ship. Their progress in
one area seems at times to parallel the
other. Just as they soon discover that
vital components of their ship are func
tional, or may be rendered such, they
quickly learn that Eden was once, and
may still be, inhabited by intelligent
beings. They run across an abandoned
factory complex, and as they approach a
city, stumble across a horrific trench filled
by strange, revolting corpses. Yet these
perceptions of the crew are colored by
one element which is irreconciliable with
the intelligence and forces which have

wrought these works — their humanity.
Lem does not use this word in a com
plimentary sense, but rather as a neutral
— if not negative — term. The crew are
quite human — in other words, they
squabble and sulk.
The Engineer, a main player in the
book, repeatedly calls for the expedition
to take on a military footing and appears
to be more eager to destroy the alien
civilization than observe it. He has the
privilege of being the sole character to
be granted a first name (used in perhaps
a dozen instances), which serves to make
him more approachable to the reader
than most of the other characters.
The Doctor comes to oppose the En
gineer. He has the most "humanistic"
values of the crew (in the sense that he
respects the sanctity of life), but fctftfhbugh
the book follows him more closely than
anyone else, he is obviously remote from
the rest of the men.
The Captain's role is to delegate jobs
to his crew, and his decisions seem to
do little more than maintain a kind of
homeostasis. It is obvious that these men
are no superheroes — we are in a com
pletely different universe than that of
James T. Kirk and the gallant crew of
the Enterprise.
In "Eden," the non-interventionism of
the Doctor is intended to prevent the
society of Eden from being destroyed by
the values and judgments of the human
crew members.
Lem's theme is a negative comment

upon human nature (and, incidentally,
upon the jaunty imperialism of "Star
Trek" and Captain Kirk). At first the
primary sin of the characters is merely
that they judge the alien society by
human standards. By the end of the book,
the humans, despite all their efforts to
act benignly, have done no good for any
of the sentient beings involved.
In comparison to Lem's earlier books,
the writing in "Eden" is quite spartan,
especially when compared to the beguiling
imagery of "Fiasco," his last original
work. This is done in order to affect
neutrality or objectivity. Unfortunately,
it distances the reader from the book just
as the lack of names distances the reader
from its characters. Yet at the same time,
it serves to underscore the fact that this
book' is about ideas.
This novel has political implications
for the nations of Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union. Local writer Rob
Swigart feels, with a great degree of
merit, that the clumsy technology of the
book is meant to parody clumsy Soviet
culture as well as some American science
fiction.
The novel has deep implications here
at Stanford, too. Scientific standards
demand that sociologists and anthropol
ogists, among others, not allow their ob
servations to be colored by personal judg
ments.
While Lem cannot provide the answers
for us, he at least forces us to think
about these issues.
