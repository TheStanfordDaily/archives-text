## Is football's importance out of bounds? 
### 
"Football is becoming a huge and highly
specialized business and the amateur element
characteristic of college athletics is in danger
of disappearing from it. The function of a
University so far as football is concerned is
not to provide a spectacle for the entertainment
of outside crowds, but to interest as many of
its students as possible in healthful outdoor
sports. If football is essential for purposes of
entertainment, it should be professionalized
outside of the university. . . . The advertising
value of football is undoubted, but it brings
in its train some harmful effects, and it should
never be allowed to take precedence over the
physical, moral and intellectual needs of the
student body."
The above quote comes from an athletic
committee appointed by the board of
trustees of Southern Methodist Univer
sity, a school that has been charged with
various violations on and off for the past 70
years. Its relevence becomes more important
each and every day.

Just yesterday, Notre Dame announced it
had sold television rights to its home football
games to NBC. The deal, which runs for five
years, begins in 1991.
The interesting thing, however, is that Notre
Dame is one of 64 members of the College
Football Association. The CFA was formed a
few years back in an effort to give schools
more bargaining power in making television
deals with networks. Containing almost every
football school outside the Big Ten and
the Pacific 10 Conferences, it succeeded in
getting more college football on television and
bringing a lot more money into the coffers of
its members.
The interesting part is that ABC agreed last
month to pay the CFA $210 million for ex
clusive broadcast rights to CFA games for the
five-year period begining in 1991. ESPN had
earlier reached a similar five-year deal for
cable rights at a cost of $110 million.
Since the member institutions joitaed the
CFA in order to get more exposure and more
money, it seems fitting that a school would
leave the television package for the same rea
son. Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosen
thal said that ABC had plans to broadcast
some of the Fighting Irish's games on a re
gional basis and that he felt it "would almost
be better for us not to be on than to be on
in only part of the country."
It seems football, which is already too big,
is getting bigger. Notre Dame started their
schedule with a game in August this year.
How does a school justify having students play
ing football from mid-August into January?
Especially when the school's primary purpose
is allegedly to provide an education?
In a perfect world, an athletic program
would be for the athletes. At probably every
school in the nation, Stanford included, that
is not the case.
Football is king, basketball is queen and the
other sports play the role of servants to those
two. True, football and basketball provide the
only revenue for most schools' athletic depart-


Chris
Crader
ments. Here at Stanford, football
gate receipts and television money
are a big piece of the income pie.
But does that mean football
should get to spend all the money?
The capitalists and football lovers
obviously think so, but isn't it the
schools' choice?
If college athletics is meant to
make money, then give football
the use of the income. But if col
lege athletics is for the athletes,
they should be the benificiaries.
What makes a football player
more important than a fencer?
Football is allowed a total of 95
scholarships, while Stanford as a
whole awarded 253.8 during the
1988-89 school year. Football
coaches will explain for hours why
they need 95 scholarship players
to be competitive, but Berhane

Andeberhan has taken the wom
en's soccer team into the nation's
top 20 without any scholarships.
Of the 95 scholarship foot
ball players, only 60 can
travel to road games. True,
more can suit up for home games,
but if you can play with 60 guys
on the road, why can't you do it
at home?
Even the most ardent Cardinal
sports fan probably can't name
more than 40 football players. I
spent 10 or 15 minutes thinking
about it and could only come up
with 66 names, and I covered the
team for The Daily for the past
two years.
Now, I know full well that there
is no chance of Stanford giving
out fewer than 95 scholarships
while other teams have that many
available. It's that stuff about
being competitive and all that.
But the NCAA might want to con
sider reducing the maximum

number of scholarships available
for the sport, coaches' complaints
aside.
Seven of Stanford's 29 varsity
sports currently receive no athle
tic scholarships. And when the
Athletic Department faces a
budget crisis, like it is facing now,
it is always the minor sports that
get cut. Is someone on the crew
or wrestling or field hockey team
less important that a football
player?
I guess that is what the Athletic
Department has to decide now.
My opinion is that maybe football
shouldn't be the only thing and
that other sports should not be
automatically deemed inferior.
If the Athletic Department
studies its history, it might agree
â€” the quote at the top of this
column was written in 1923.

I guess that is what the Athletic
Department has to decide now.
My opinion is that maybe football
shouldn't be the only thing and
that other sports should not be
automatically deemed inferior.
If the Athletic Department
studies its history, it might agree
â€” the quote at the top of this
column was written in 1923.

Chris Crader is The Daily's men's
basketball writer.
"Football is becoming a huge and highly
specialized business and the amateur element
characteristic of college athletics is in danger
of disappearing from it. The function of a
University so far as football is concerned is
not to provide a spectacle for the entertainment
of outside crowds, but to interest as many of
its students as possible in healthful outdoor
sports. If football is essential for purposes of
entertainment, it should be professionalized
outside of the university. . . . The advertising
value of football is undoubted, but it brings
in its train some harmful effects, and it should
never be allowed to take precedence over the
physical, moral and intellectual needs of the
student body."
The above quote comes from an athletic
committee appointed by the board of
trustees of Southern Methodist Univer
sity, a school that has been charged with
various violations on and off for the past 70
years. Its relevence becomes more important
each and every day.

Just yesterday, Notre Dame announced it
had sold television rights to its home football
games to NBC. The deal, which runs for five
years, begins in 1991.
The interesting thing, however, is that Notre
Dame is one of 64 members of the College
Football Association. The CFA was formed a
few years back in an effort to give schools
more bargaining power in making television
deals with networks. Containing almost every
football school outside the Big Ten and
the Pacific 10 Conferences, it succeeded in
getting more college football on television and
bringing a lot more money into the coffers of
its members.
The interesting part is that ABC agreed last
month to pay the CFA $210 million for ex
clusive broadcast rights to CFA games for the
five-year period begining in 1991. ESPN had
earlier reached a similar five-year deal for
cable rights at a cost of $110 million.
Since the member institutions joitaed the
CFA in order to get more exposure and more
money, it seems fitting that a school would
leave the television package for the same rea
son. Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosen
thal said that ABC had plans to broadcast
some of the Fighting Irish's games on a re
gional basis and that he felt it "would almost
be better for us not to be on than to be on
in only part of the country."
It seems football, which is already too big,
is getting bigger. Notre Dame started their
schedule with a game in August this year.
How does a school justify having students play
ing football from mid-August into January?
Especially when the school's primary purpose
is allegedly to provide an education?
In a perfect world, an athletic program
would be for the athletes. At probably every
school in the nation, Stanford included, that
is not the case.
Football is king, basketball is queen and the
other sports play the role of servants to those
two. True, football and basketball provide the
only revenue for most schools' athletic depart-

ments. Here at Stanford, football
gate receipts and television money
are a big piece of the income pie.
But does that mean football
should get to spend all the money?
The capitalists and football lovers
obviously think so, but isn't it the
schools' choice?
If college athletics is meant to
make money, then give football
the use of the income. But if col
lege athletics is for the athletes,
they should be the benificiaries.
What makes a football player
more important than a fencer?
Football is allowed a total of 95
scholarships, while Stanford as a
whole awarded 253.8 during the
1988-89 school year. Football
coaches will explain for hours why
they need 95 scholarship players
to be competitive, but Berhane

Andeberhan has taken the wom
en's soccer team into the nation's
top 20 without any scholarships.
Of the 95 scholarship foot
ball players, only 60 can
travel to road games. True,
more can suit up for home games,
but if you can play with 60 guys
on the road, why can't you do it
at home?
Even the most ardent Cardinal
sports fan probably can't name
more than 40 football players. I
spent 10 or 15 minutes thinking
about it and could only come up
with 66 names, and I covered the
team for The Daily for the past
two years.
Now, I know full well that there
is no chance of Stanford giving
out fewer than 95 scholarships
while other teams have that many
available. It's that stuff about
being competitive and all that.
But the NCAA might want to con
sider reducing the maximum

number of scholarships available
for the sport, coaches' complaints
aside.
Seven of Stanford's 29 varsity
sports currently receive no athle
tic scholarships. And when the
Athletic Department faces a
budget crisis, like it is facing now,
it is always the minor sports that
get cut. Is someone on the crew
or wrestling or field hockey team
less important that a football
player?
I guess that is what the Athletic
Department has to decide now.
