# Oops! Card 'drops' one
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Ugliness was the order of the day at Sunken
Diamond yesterday, and the Sacramento State Hor
nets had themselves a feast.
The Stanford baseball team served up three early
defensive goofs for the Hornets, who turned the
miscues into four runs. After that, the offspeed
junk of starter Doug Thurman kept the Cardinal
bats flailing away at nothing but air until a last
inning Hornet flurry put the game out of reach.

Thurman, a lefty junior-college transfer, scattered
five hits over seven and a third innings for the win.
There was no great secret to his success, though.
"I was just changing speeds," he said. "I think they
(Stanford) are mostly fastball hitters, so I kept it
offspeed and moved my fastball in and out. .. .
Basically, I was just changing speeds."
Which means a lot of junk pitches, accounting
for the nine walks Thurman surrendered.
"He (Thurman) is the first guy we've faced this
year who's all offspeed," Stanford's Tim Griffin said.
"That's given us trouble in the past, and (today)
we didn't adjust very well."
In fact, Griffin was the only Cardinal player who
adjusted at all, as his solo home run to lead off the
third provided all of Stanford's offense. Everyone
else struggled — including senior Paul Carey, who
struck out swinging three times.
Carey didn't see a lot of decent pitches, and with
good reason. "I came in to watch Paul Carey Sat
urday when they played Fullerton State," Thurman
said. "He looked like he was susceptible to breaking
balls, so I tried to get him out in front and make
him fish for the ball."
"He (Thurman) did a good job keeping us off
balance," Carey said. "He mixed up his slider and
changeup and got his fastball over for strikes."
While Thurman kept the Cardinal hitters off bal
ance, his teammates were taking advantage of
several Stanford fielding flubs. The first came with
two outs in the top of the third. Hornet catcher
John Quintell poked a grounder toward first base
man David McCarty, who grabbed the ball and tossed
right to starting pitcher John Reid, who was covering
first. Reid dropped the ball, and Rafael Maldonado
scored from second on the play. One miscue, down
1-0.


Kai Keasy — Daily file
Ryan Turner gets a good cut on a breaking ball, one of the many that Cardinal batters saw yesterday
at Sunken Diamond. Sacramento State's Doug Thurman stymied Stanford, surrendering one run on
just five hits in a game won by the Hornets, 9-1.
