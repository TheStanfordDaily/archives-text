# Palmer returns; netters battle San Jose
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Jared Palmer, arguably one of the
top two freshman tennis players in
the country, makes his debut today
against San Jose at 1:30 p.m.
Palmer, who has been sidelined be
cause of knee surgery, will play at the
No. 6 spot, even though he normally
would compete at a much higher po
sition.
"He hasn't played a match that has
counted since October," Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger said. "You lose a little
sharpness when you haven't played in
a serious match for that long. It will
be interesting to see how he does."
Palmer, meanwhile, sees his opening
match as "good practice."
"My knee is almost at 100 percent,"
Palmer said. "I can play 100 percent
on it, but it still hurts sometimes.

'On paper we should definitely win the
match, but sometimes they throw away the
papers.'

"I just am excited to get the season
started."
Besides Palmer, San Jose will see
most of Stanford's normal lineup.
Coming off an impressive win over the
No. 2 player in the country, San
Diego's Jose-Luis Noriega, freshman
Johnathan Stark will be at the No. 1
spot. Alex O'Brien, Jeff Cathrall,
Glenn Solomon and Jason Yee should
play in the two through five positions.
Despite the strength of the Cardinal,
Stanford Coach Richard Gould warns
against looking past the Spartans.
"They have upgraded their team a lot,"

Gould said. "It's going to take a good
effort."
Whitlinger added, "On paper we
should definitely win the match, but
sometimes they throw away the
papers. Besides, everyone gets psyched
to play us."
Palmer, who is the No. 5-ranked
junior in the world, has a record that
â€¢ncludes wins over pro-circuit tennis
stars as Kevin Curren, Jimmy Arias
and former Stanford player Jeff
Tarango. He brings an accomplished
(and extremely powerful) all-court

game to San Jose.
"He literally can hit any shot in the
book," Whitlinger said.
If Palmer's knee holds up, the fresh
man may hook up with Stark to play
No. 1 doubles. Stark and Palmer, who
were the No. 2-ranked doubles team
in the country at the start of the year,
combined to win the Wimbeldon Jr.
doubles championships in 1989.
