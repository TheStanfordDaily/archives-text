# Stanford opens doors to Class of 2001 earlier than planned
## 
### Amy Arends Staff writer 
Even though the Class of 1994 won't
receive acceptance letters until April, the
Class of 2001 will enter Stanford Satur
day.
In tradition, Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Jean Fetter will welcome
them.
Fifth-graders from Costano Elemen
tary School in the Ravenswood School
District will become honorary Stanford
students Saturday during Teach For
America Day. The day's activities are or
ganized by Tomorrow's Teachers Today,
a newly formed Stanford organization

which encourages teaching.
The event is sponsored by Teach For
America, a national organization which
encourages teaching in inner-city or rural
areas.
The young 3tudents will have the op
portunity to take three half-hour classes
on subjects ranging from jazz dance to
rocket launching.
"The classes are supposed to be inter
active and entertaining. We call it 'stealth*
teaching — the kids don't even know
they're learning," said senior Lyn Fair
child, co-founder of Tomorrow's Teachers
Today.
Saturday's activities are the first of
many projects the student group is work

ing on. The group is also recruiting sen
iors and graduate students to apply for
Teach For America, an organization that
Fairchild likened to the Peace Corps,
"only it's a teacher corps working in the
inner cities and rural America."
"You really have to be part social
worker to teach in an inner city or rural
area," Fairchild said.
Non-education majors who want to
teach for two years before going on to
other jobs or continuing with teaching
are being recruited.
"They are especially looking for science,
engineering and foreign language majors,
as well as students of color," Fairchild
added.

The kids don't even
know they're learning.'

According to Fairchild, the purpose of
Tomorrow's Teachers Today is to provide
a voice for an organization like Teach
For America, as well as be a "peer support
network for Stanford students interested
in teaching."
"Sometimes, because of lunch and
detention duty, teaching isn't really
looked on as a professional position," she
said.

"We will be involved in putting together
a resource booklet, seminars and brown
bag luncheons to give Stanford students
the opportunity to find out about the
different teaching options they have avail
able as undergraduates and to encourage
teaching as a possible career," Fairchild
said.
Tomorrow's Teachers Today is
"separate from the different tutoring pro
grams on campus. We're interested in
phasing undergrads into schools to [be
teacher assistants for] classes or teach
classes or lecture regularly," Fairchild
said.
The group also wants to provide sum
mer internships to students, she added.
