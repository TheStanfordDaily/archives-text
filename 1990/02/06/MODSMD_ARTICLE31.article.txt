# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Undaunted by big-time collegiate athletics
and the towering reputations of their team
mates, freshmen Janel Jorgensen and Jeff
Hammonds are The Daily's Athletes of the
Week.
Maybe it's the mild temperatures, but the
two East Coast natives have adapted with
amazing quickness to their starting roles,
Jorgensen for the women's swimmers and
Hammonds with the Cardinal baseball team.
Both were instrumental in propelling their
squads to impressive victories last week.
Jorgensen, a 5-foot-9 butterflier from

Ridgefield, Conn., won three events in
leading No. 1 Stanford over No. 2 Texas
Saturday, 93-47. She did all this despite not
swimming her best event, the 100-yard but
terfly.
Jorgensen started by swimming the anchor
leg of the 200 medley relay, which set a
deGuerre pool record. Jorgensen was back
in the water 15 minutes later, winning the
200 freestyle for the Cardinal. Her time in
that event is the fastest in the nation so
far this year, despite the fact that she doesn't
consider the 200 freestyle one of her
strongest events.
She then defeated defending NCAA cham
pion Leigh Ann Fetter in the 100 freestyle
in what the Lady Longhorns' coach called
the only big surprise of the meet. Her time
of 50.19 was .61 seconds below her previous
lifetime best.
Jorgensen ended her day by setting a pool
record in the 200 individual medley,
breaking a 10-year-old standard. She also
beat two Texas swimmers who finished in
the top five in that event at last year's
NCAA Championships.

Hammonds, a 6-foot center fielder from
Plainfield, N.J., exhibited experience beyond
his years in going 10 for 18 last week to
lead Stanford to four wins and improve the
team's record to 6-0.
Hammonds went 4 for 5 Wednesday
against the University of San Francisco,
scoring three runs and driving in two. He
beat out a grounder to the second baseman
in the fourth inning and crushed a ball over
the left-field fence in the seventh to display
both power and speed.
In that game, Hammonds also twice went

from first to third on USF miscues, once
on a wild pitch and again on an errant
pick-off throw.
The highly-recruited speedster had two
hits, two stolen bases and two runs in Fri
day's 8-1 win over Cal State-Fullerton. He
also stole second successfully despite the
fact that a pitch-out was called on the play.
Saturday, he advanced Troy Tallman from
first to third with a hit to set up Stanford's
only run in a 1-0 win. He ended the weekend
by getting two singles and a double in Sun
day's 8-7 victory.
