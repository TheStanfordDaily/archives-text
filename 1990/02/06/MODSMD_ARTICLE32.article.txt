# Birch and Co. to take on the Utes
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
A year ago when Utah visited
the Stanford women's tennis
team, the big news was the return
to action of Eleni Rossides.
In four years here, Rossides was
seemingly always injured. Early
last season, her less-than
spectacular physical state was not
unique on the team. So far in
1990, however, the Cardinal has
not been bitten by the ir\jury bug
that has cropped up throughout
recent years.
Defending NCAA singles cham
pion Sandra Birch will compete
in her first dual meet of the
season today. Birch will also team
with Debbie Graham as the 1989
NCAA doubles finalists will play
No. 1 doubles for Stanford.
That match may be the most
interesting of the day. Birch and
Graham are slated to take on
Susie Costa and Ruth Ann
Stevens, the nation's 13th-ranked
doubles tandem. Birch and
Graham are rated 16th.
Stanford's has done nothing to
diminish its preseason ranking
yet. Seeing the team record two
perfect scores in dual meets last
week, without playing all the

team' 9 top players, has pleased
Coach Frank Brennan.
"I'm quite happy," Brennan
said. "So far, so good. [Everyone]
is playing well, and doubles is
coming along."
In 1989, the Utes fell to the
Cardinal 8-0 in the first match
played in the "new" Stanford Ten
nis Stadium. Today's match might
provide a similar result, but it is
still important as Stanford plays
incrementally tougher opponents
to prepare for the top teams com
ing up on the schedule.
