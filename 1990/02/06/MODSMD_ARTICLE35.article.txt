# Fencers slimed by Slugs in Santa Cruz
## 
### Dax Kurbegov Staff writer 
Last weekend's dual meet be
tween the Stanford and UC-Santa
Cruz fencing teams was supposed
to be sweet revenge for the Car
dinal men, who lost to Santa Cruz
two weeks ago on a controversial
call. Instead, the Banana Slugs
ran through the Cardinal men,
serving them their worst defeat
of the season.
The Cardinal women managed
to edge out the Santa Cruz squad
by four touches.
The Cardinal men lost the meet
by a margin of 19-8. The team
only managed to win one of the
three weapons employed in fenc
ing. Stanford held on to win sabre
by a score of 5-4 but lost in foil,
6-3.
Epee proved to be the men's
greatest shortcoming, as they fell
to Santa Cruz 9-0.
The Stanford women's team led

Fencing

their competition throughout.
Going into the last bout, the Car
dinal led by a score of 8-7, but
needed only one touch to secure
a victory based on indicators.
Fencer Olivia Judson lost the
bout to her Santa Cruz opponent,
but she managed to pull out four
touches before falling. "I wasn't
aware of the indicator situation,"
said Judson. "But everyone else
was. Next time it won't be so
close. I think everyone is coming
into form. Besides, it's always
easier on our home turf."
Stanford and Santa Cruz will
meet again in March for the West
Regional Fencing Championships,
which will be held at Maples Pa
vilion.
According to epee fencer David

Brody, the men should be able to
handle Santa Cruz at Regionals
as well.
"Our team just got back from
a really intense competition at
Penn State with some of the best
teams in the nation," said Brody.
"It seemed like we came out flat.
Their program at Santa Cruz is
more limited than ours, and it
was apparent that this meet
meant a lot more to them than
to us."
Brody also said that since the
teams have already fenced twice
this season, the Cardinal fencers
would be much better prepared
for the event.
Women's team captain Grace
Chang added, "We had a lot of
bad luck this weekend. We lost
six of the nine epee bouts by only
one touch. It easily could have
gone either way."
In their previous meeting, Stan
ford lost both foil and epee by
scores of 5-4.

"It's like when you start slip
ping and sliding," Jim Farrell, a
sabre fencer, said. "The further
you go, the harder it is to
straighten yourself. Today, we just
couldn't get off the touches."
Both teams will be travelling to
Los Angeles this weekend for the
Pacific 10 Conference Invitation
al, where Stanford will be the fa
vorite. According to Brody, the
Cardinal fencers should be able to
handle the West Coast teams as
well as they did last year when
they won the event.
