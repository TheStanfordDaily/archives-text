The Stanford women's gym
nastics team logged a season
high team score and turned in
some fine individual perform
ances at Burnham Pavilion
Sunday, but it fell short of the
competition in the final stand
ings.

Women's Gymnastics

Buoyed by generous scoring
— due largely to the presence
of nationally-ranked Arizona
State — Stanford tallied a point
total of 182.35 to finish behind
ASU (187.05) and New Mexico
(184.3) in the three-way meet.
Despite the high score, Coach
Breck Greenwood viewed the
meet in general as a missed
chance. "We had an opportu
nity to score very well in this
meet, but we dropped the ball."
Stanford did manage season

best team scores on vault and
floor exercise, but the disap
pointments came in the team's
best events — bars and balance
beam — where lack of prepa
ration seemed to play a role.
"Last week in practice, we
neglected the pressure work on
beam and concentrated on floor
and vault, and it showed," Asst.
Coach Penny Hauschild ex
plained.
The meet did, however, have
its share of high points for the
Cardinal. Senior co-captain
Dina Amoroso turned in her
usual gem of a performance in
all-around, scoring a season
best 37.7 to take second place
in the event.
Jennifer Bloom overcame the
pressure of following three fal
len teammates on beam as she
earned a season-topping 9.35
for her rock-solid routine.
Sophomore Shira Wohlberg
had a successful debut for
Stanford, scoring a 9.0 on vault
despite being the lead-off ath
lete in the team's first event,
a stressful position for a first
time competitor.
