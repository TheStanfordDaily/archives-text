One through 12 is once again
one through 12 as the top dozen
teams in the Associated Press
women's basketball remain un
changed from a week ago. Lou
isiana Tech's and Stanford's per
fect records are now at 19-0 with
the top-ranked Techsters receiv
ing 53 first-place votes and 1,637
points from a nationwide panel of
66 women's coaches.
Stanford drew the other 13
first-place votes and 1,597 points.
Both are on course to carry un
beaten records into the NCAA
Women's Final Four at Knoxville,
Tenn., at the end of March. Stan
ford might get somewhat of a chal
lenge this weekend when the Car
dinal travels to No. 7 Washington,
although it beat the Huskies, 102-
62, here last month. The game
will be t<' ' "" *-> an
ESPN taj., Sat
urday.
Missing from The Associated
Press women's college basketball
poll is Mississippi, and that is a
mystery to Coach Van Chancellor.
"I find it unbelieveable that
we're number one in what is
reputedly the toughest league in
the country and not in the Top
25," Chancellor said. "It must not
count for anything to beat Geor

gia, play well against Tennessee
and win 10 of our last 11."
Mississippi (16-5), which fell
out of the rankings in December,
leads the Southeastern Confer
ence at 5-1.
