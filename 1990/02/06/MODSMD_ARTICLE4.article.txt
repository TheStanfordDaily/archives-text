# Frats face Rush without a home
## 
### Holly Hacker 
Despite recently being added to
the unhoused fraternity list, Delta
Tau Delta and Theta Xi are ap
proaching spring Rush with a
business-as-usual attitude.
The two fraternities, which lost
their houses to the Oct. 17
temblor, "will be rushing with the
rest of the system," according to
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Michael
Hughes.
The problem is where they will
rush.
Although plans have not yet
been made definite, the Delts will
most likely hold their Rush parties
in a house "somewhere on the
Row," Delt President Chuck Gil
lingham said, adding that the In
terfraternity Council has the last
say on where the Delt Rush will
be held.
Taxi Rush chair David Polonet
said 553 Mayfield will be the site
of at least one, and possibly two,
of the Taxi's three Rush parties.
"The IFC has pointed out some

places where we might hold Rush,
but from there, we're on our own
to secure a house," Polonet said.
Polonet said he is concerned
that the addition of two unhoused
fraternities means "a lot of un
housed fraternities will be having
parties on the same nights," re
sulting in greater competition for
Rush party sites.
In addition, "the house itself is
one of the things people who rush
think about," said Polonet. Taxi
rushees will be shown the outside
of the house in the spring, but
pledges will have to wait until fall
— when the house is reopened —
to see the inside.
The Delt house will remain
closed next year. "Right now, it

doesn't look like we'll have a
house for quite a while," Gilling
ham said.
He added that after the earth
quake, about 90 percent of the
Delts moved off campus into
apartments. The displacement
"has affected us a lot," Gillingham
said, "because most of the time
we spent together was iri the
house."
The Delts have been trying to
maintain their fraternity ties, but
Gillingham said it has been a "new
experience" for them.
As for the Taxis, Polonet said
that being split up all over campus
has made it difficult for members
to stay in touch with each other.
The fraternity held a party Friday
night at the Alpha Sigma house,
and while Polonet said it was
"good," he added that "it wasn't
the same caliber as if had been
at our own house."
"Having an unhoused Rush is
a new experience for all of us, and
it's not how we'd prefer to do it,"
said Polonet, "but hopefully we'll
never have to do it again."
