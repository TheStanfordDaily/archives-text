'Black introspection'
Black Liberation Month
kicked off last weekend with a
speech on self-esteem and eco
nomic independence given by
prominent black educator
Jawanza Kunjufu. The month's
theme is "It Begins from
Within: A Black Introspection."
The planning committee chose
the theme to help blacks develop
a positive self-concept despite
racial barriers.
The month will "eliminate
self-doubt which underlies all
problems and reinforce self
worth, which ultimately
transcends all problems," coor
dinators said in a statement.
Speakers include Mae
Jemison, the first black female
astronaut, and Rosa Parks, the
well-known civil rights activist
whose refusal in 1955 to give
up her seat to a white man on
Alabama bus led to a boycott
and an eventual federal court
ruling declaring bus segregation
unconstitutional.
Jemison, a Stanford alumna,
will address challenges faced by
black women in the 1990s in a
speech Feb. 15 at 7 p.m. in

Kresge Auditorium. Parks will
speak in Memorial Auditorium
at 3 p.m., Feb. 19.
Other events include dance
presentations, films and a self
esteem workshop.
All programs are open to the
public. For further information

Services Center at 723-1587.
Polo club suspended
The Stanford polo club, a
student-supported club sport,
was suspended for a day last
week after the Los Altos Horse
men's Association complained
that 15 of the club's horses were
in poor condition.
The suspension was lifted
when a veterinarian and an of
ficial from the Peninsula
Humane Society examined the
horses but found only minor
problems. The veterinarian
found that several horses were
underweight, others needed a
dental checkup and some suf
fered from foot infections.
The examinations were
prompted by allegations that the
horses were emaciated, lame
and suffering from both diar

rhea and eye infections. The or
ganization contacted both news
paper and TV reporters about
the alleged abuse.
Alcohol policy vote
The Council of Presidents will
gauge student sentiment on the
new alcohol policy proposal to
morrow in what is expected to
be the first of many polls of
dorm residents this year.
The proposed alcohol policy,
released last month by Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons,
would prohibit dorm funds from
being spent on alcohol and would
prohibit stadium-goers from
bringing in alcohol.
The dorm votes are not bin
ding, said COP member David
Brown, but they are to provide
strong guidance to the ASSU.
"I think it will get people to
participate," noted Brown. In
grid Nava, Brown's fellow COP
member, has overseen creation
of the vote.
The COP announced in last
week's State of the Association
address that it will make the
dorm votes a permanent, feature.
