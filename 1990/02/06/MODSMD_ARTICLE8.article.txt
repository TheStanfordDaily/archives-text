Trailers, trailers, everywhere
Both Stanford and UC-Santa Cruz have in
stalled temporary trailer-like buildings on their
campuses as a result of the Oct. 17 earthquake.
But while at Stanford the trailers house class
rooms and offices, at Santa Cruz they may pro
vide shelter for homeless senior citizens.
UC-Santa Cruz has agreed to provide land for
a temporary mobile home park on the campus
to help house some of the 550 elderly people
displaced by the quake.
If approved by the Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency, the mobile home park will oc
cupy about nine acres on the 2,000-acre campus
for approximately 18 months. About 100 three
bedroom trailers expected to house about 150
people will be placed in the park.
The park would be managed by the Santa Cruz
County Housing Authority, which requested that
the university authorize the use of its land for
the temporary park.
UC out of weapons research?
A University of California faculty committee
has recommended that the UC system "phase
out" its management of two nuclear weapons
laboratories for the federal government.
The recommendation by a committee of the
Academic Senate, which represents faculty mem
bers on the system's nine campuses, would have
to be endorsed by the full senate before being
submitted to the university's Board of Regents,
a senate spokesperson said.
The committee voted 6-2 to recommend cutting
ties with the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos
National Laboratories. The Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory was not included because no weapons
research is done there.
The committee report said nuclear weapons
research and development are "contrary to the
fundamental nature of the university" because
they invoke "a high level of classified work and
explicit programmatic direction from the govern
ment."
The current contract for management of the
laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy
expires in 1992, and discussions are expected to
begin next September if a new five-year contract
is to be negotiated. The university is paid about
$11 million per year for managing the facilities.
UC increases minority hiring
Nearly half of the 539 professors recruited by
the University of California system in the last
academic year are women or members of minority
groups, according to a university affirmative ac
tion report.
Despite the increases, only 1.8 percent of the
system's current tenure-track faculty members
are black, 3.2 percent are Hispanic and 6.8 percent
are Asian.
David Gardner, the system's chancellor, hailed
the university's progress in attracting more
female and minority professors and students but
noted that more needed to be done.
Of the 539 professors who accepted offers to
teach at one of the system's nine campuses, the
report says 262 — 48.6 percent — are women
or members of minority groups. Among the 262
are 147 white women, 78 minority males and 37
minority women. Most of the newly hired people
joined the system this fall.
From 1983 to 1988, the number of minority
group members in tenure-track positions rose 25

percent, from 695 to 870, but their proportion
of the faculty increased only two percentage
points, from 10.2 to 12 percent. The total number
of faculty members jumped by more than 6 per
cent - to 7,225 in 1988 from 6,793 in 1983, the
report said.
Wisconsin urges ROTC ban
The faculty at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison urged last month that Reserve Officer
Training Corps programs be banned from the
campus unless the armed forces stop discriminat
ing against homosexuals by 1993.
In their first full meeting since 1970, faculty
members voted 386 to 248 to urge the university's
regents to sever the ROTC contracts with the
Air Force, Army and Navy unless those forces
admit homosexuals to ROTC programs.
The resolution is not binding on the regents,
and it was not known when they might take up
the question.
ROTC programs have come under fire at
several universities because the services exclude
homosexuals.
The controversy has come at a time when the
number of students in ROTC programs is
growing. About 96,000 students now participate
in the programs on 585 campuses.
Donna Shalala, chancellor of the Madison
campus, said she hoped the faculty's vote "will
encourage debate and discussion among members
of Congress about discrimination in the military."
Multicultural DR added
Beginning next fall, entering students at the
University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire will be
required to complete six credit hours' worth of
courses or fieldwork dealing with minority groups
and cultures.
The university senate voted last month to ap
prove the new requirement in response to a man
date issued by Kenneth Shaw, president of the
University of Wisconsin system.
Shaw, in a 1988 report called "Design for Di
versity," asked all of the system's campuses to
increase the number of minority students and
professors at their institutions and to provide
their students with a broader cultural experience.
Under the new requirement at Eau Claire,
students must take courses focusing on one or
more of the underrepresented minority groups
desginated in the report — Native Americans,
blacks, Hispanics and Southeast Asians.
Editor fired over racist articles
The editor of a Duke University humor mag
azine has been fired by the student publications
board for not responding to charges that two
articles about university dining hall workers were
racist.
The board first called for an apology from the
editor, Martin Padgett, and condemned the ar
ticles as "Offensive," said Mona Amer, head of
the Undergraduate Publications Board.
It dismissed Padgett when he delayed his apol
ogy and failed to attend a rally sponsored by
minority and ethnic student organizations, which
had voiced the charges of racism.
The concerns arose when two articles that the
editors said were intended to be satires of the
language and work habits of dining hall employ
ees appeared in last month's issue of the maga
zine.

begin next September if a new five-year contract
is to be negotiated. The university is paid about
$11 million per year for managing the facilities.
UC increases minority hiring
Nearly half of the 539 professors recruited by
the University of California system in the last
academic year are women or members of minority
groups, according to a university affirmative ac
tion report.
Despite the increases, only 1.8 percent of the
system's current tenure-track faculty members
are black, 3.2 percent are Hispanic and 6.8 percent
are Asian.
David Gardner, the system's chancellor, hailed
the university's progress in attracting more
female and minority professors and students but
noted that more needed to be done.
Of the 539 professors who accepted offers to
teach at one of the system's nine campuses, the
report says 262 — 48.6 percent — are women
or members of minority groups. Among the 262
are 147 white women, 78 minority males and 37
minority women. Most of the newly hired people
joined the system this fall.
From 1983 to 1988, the number of minority
group members in tenure-track positions rose 25

percent, from 695 to 870, but their proportion
of the faculty increased only two percentage
points, from 10.2 to 12 percent. The total number
of faculty members jumped by more than 6 per
cent - to 7,225 in 1988 from 6,793 in 1983, the
report said.
Wisconsin urges ROTC ban
The faculty at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison urged last month that Reserve Officer
Training Corps programs be banned from the
campus unless the armed forces stop discriminat
ing against homosexuals by 1993.
In their first full meeting since 1970, faculty
members voted 386 to 248 to urge the university's
regents to sever the ROTC contracts with the
Air Force, Army and Navy unless those forces
admit homosexuals to ROTC programs.
The resolution is not binding on the regents,
and it was not known when they might take up
the question.
ROTC programs have come under fire at
several universities because the services exclude
homosexuals.
The controversy has come at a time when the
number of students in ROTC programs is
growing. About 96,000 students now participate
in the programs on 585 campuses.
Donna Shalala, chancellor of the Madison
campus, said she hoped the faculty's vote "will
encourage debate and discussion among members
of Congress about discrimination in the military."
Multicultural DR added
Beginning next fall, entering students at the
University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire will be
required to complete six credit hours' worth of
courses or fieldwork dealing with minority groups
and cultures.
The university senate voted last month to ap
prove the new requirement in response to a man
date issued by Kenneth Shaw, president of the
University of Wisconsin system.
Shaw, in a 1988 report called "Design for Di
versity," asked all of the system's campuses to
increase the number of minority students and
professors at their institutions and to provide
their students with a broader cultural experience.
Under the new requirement at Eau Claire,
students must take courses focusing on one or
more of the underrepresented minority groups
desginated in the report — Native Americans,
blacks, Hispanics and Southeast Asians.
Editor fired over racist articles
The editor of a Duke University humor mag
azine has been fired by the student publications
board for not responding to charges that two
articles about university dining hall workers were
racist.
The board first called for an apology from the
editor, Martin Padgett, and condemned the ar
ticles as "Offensive," said Mona Amer, head of
the Undergraduate Publications Board.
It dismissed Padgett when he delayed his apol
ogy and failed to attend a rally sponsored by
minority and ethnic student organizations, which
had voiced the charges of racism.
The concerns arose when two articles that the
editors said were intended to be satires of the
language and work habits of dining hall employ
ees appeared in last month's issue of the maga
zine.

Trailers, trailers, everywhere
Both Stanford and UC-Santa Cruz have in
stalled temporary trailer-like buildings on their
campuses as a result of the Oct. 17 earthquake.
But while at Stanford the trailers house class
rooms and offices, at Santa Cruz they may pro
vide shelter for homeless senior citizens.
UC-Santa Cruz has agreed to provide land for
a temporary mobile home park on the campus
to help house some of the 550 elderly people
displaced by the quake.
If approved by the Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency, the mobile home park will oc
cupy about nine acres on the 2,000-acre campus
for approximately 18 months. About 100 three
bedroom trailers expected to house about 150
people will be placed in the park.
The park would be managed by the Santa Cruz
County Housing Authority, which requested that
the university authorize the use of its land for
the temporary park.
UC out of weapons research?
A University of California faculty committee
has recommended that the UC system "phase
out" its management of two nuclear weapons
laboratories for the federal government.
The recommendation by a committee of the
Academic Senate, which represents faculty mem
bers on the system's nine campuses, would have
to be endorsed by the full senate before being
submitted to the university's Board of Regents,
a senate spokesperson said.
The committee voted 6-2 to recommend cutting
ties with the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos
National Laboratories. The Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory was not included because no weapons
research is done there.
The committee report said nuclear weapons
research and development are "contrary to the
fundamental nature of the university" because
they invoke "a high level of classified work and
explicit programmatic direction from the govern
ment."
The current contract for management of the
laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy
expires in 1992, and discussions are expected to
begin next September if a new five-year contract
is to be negotiated. The university is paid about
$11 million per year for managing the facilities.
