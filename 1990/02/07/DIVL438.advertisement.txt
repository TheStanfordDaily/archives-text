SEROPREVALENCE SURVEY

Stanford has the exciting and important opportu
nity this year to be part of the ongoing study
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) and the Amencan College Health Associa
tion (ACHA) to assess the prevalence of the HIV
antibody in college students; this data will enable
us to join national efforts to combat HrV infection
on college campuses.
The study will be a "blinded serosurvey." Residual
blood from all blood samples collected at the
health center for any purpose, after the removal of
all personal identifiers, will be tested by the CDC
for the HIV antibody.
Blinded serosurveys are completely anonymous
No identifying markers will accompany the blood
sample. However, even if positive, individual
samples will not be able to be linked to individual
students and students will not be notified.
As in the past, testing for the HIV antibody will
continue to be available to students at any of
several anonymous testing sites in the area, as
well as being free to students on a confidential
basis at Cowell Student Health Center. Interested
students may call 723-4841 for information or
723-4843 for an appointment.
