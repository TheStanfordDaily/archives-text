# Shattering the silence of morning

Left, onlookers examine the remains of a
damaged switch that caused a blackout across
half of campus yesterday morning. The switch,
above, was shut down and power was restored
within an hour and a half. Some buildings had
power restored within 20 seconds. One witness
at the scene reported seeing a yellow ball of
light and white smoke and added that she felt
heat on her back as she left the area. The
accident caused a steam release at the Cardinal
Cogeneration Plant, which some people mis
took for an explosion.
