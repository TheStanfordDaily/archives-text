### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
The Donald Kennedy-George
Shultz World Tour rolls into
Mexico City this weekend to cel
ebrate Stanford's Centennial.
The price? It costs just 125,000
pesos per person ($46.12) Friday
night and 75,000 pesos ($27.67)
Saturday night to dine, dance and
hear the headliners — University
President Kennedy, former U.S.
Secretary of State Shultz,
Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari and various Stanford
faculty members — speak about
Latin American issues.
Co-sponsored by the Centennial
Committee and the Stanford
Alumni Association, the Kennedy-
Shultz tour began in London last
April and will continue with stops
in Toronto in March and possibly
Hong Kong next April.
No donations at the door are
necessary, say organizers. Con
trary to all appearances, the

Mexico City conference is not
meant to be a fundraiser in con
junction with the University's
five-year, $1.1 billion Centennial
Campaign, according to Susan
Wolfe, assistant director of the
Centennial.
Its primary purpose is to "put
on a little show" for Stanford's
1,450 Latin American alumni and
include them in the Centennial
Celebration, Wolfe said. It will also
help increase Stanford's interna
tional reputation, reaffirming its
ties with Mexico.
However, according to William
Stone, executive director of the
Alumni Association, it is "safe to
say" that the conference may in
spire alumni to make donations
to the University.
The cost of the Mexico City con
ference will be in the $10,000 ball
park, Stone said, because the Uni
versity will be renting out a dining
room in Mexico City's Camino
Real Hotel as well as paying the
airfare and hotel accommodations

for Stanford administrators, four
faculty and about seven staff
members.
Wolfe said no profit will be
made on the conference itself.
Along with Kennedy, Shultz and
Salinas, the lineup of faculty
speakers will include Prof. Clark
Reynolds, director of the Americas
Program-Project on U.S.-Mexico
Relations; Henry Levin, director
of the Center for Educational Re
search at Stanford; and Gary
Schoolnik, director of the School
of Medicine's Division of Geo
graphic Medicine.
The speeches will address the
implications of trade negotiations,
ties between research, field sci
ence and public health policy, ed
ucation alternatives, reasons the
world is changing and University
responses to the shrinking globe.
Organizers of the Toronto con
ference hope to secure Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
as a speaker.
