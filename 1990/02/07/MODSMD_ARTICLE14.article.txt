# Plenum is extended
## Gorbachev's new reforms under fire 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Communist
Party leaders added an unexpected
third day to their pivotal meeting yes
terday and sent Mikhail S. Gorbachev
back to the drawing board to fill in
holes in his blueprint for ending the
party's monopoly on power.
The extension of the party session,
which was supposed to end yesterday,
was a clear sign of the controversy
generated by Gorbachev's proposals to
revamp the country's political struc
ture.
It sharply contrasted with previous
sessions, when the Central Committee
automatically approved policies that
had been worked out at higher levels.
Central Committee sources said
most speakers agreed with Gorba
chev's proposal that the party's
monopoly on power, enshrined in the
Soviet Constitution, must end.
However, partial transcripts of two
days of the session, in which 51
speakers took the floor, indicated that
neither radical reformers nor hard
liners were satisfied with Gorbachev's
proposal.
Delegates interviewed Monday and
yesterday as they filed out onto Red
Square indicated a common objection:
the platform contains few specifics.
"A lot of its points, and this is what
has been said by many speakers, need
changes and reinforcement, es
pecially in the direction of stepping
up decisive action," L.A. Bibin, a non
voting Central Committee member,
said in a Soviet TV interview yesterday.
Bibin said he and others want the
platform to stress that the party must
remain united. The party's unity has
been threatened in recent months by
a breakaway of the party in Lithuania
and by proposals by Moscow radicals
for formal factions.
Still, the Soviet leader's platform has
yielded to the demands of political
reformers — including the thousands
of people who gathered near the Krem
lin wall Sunday — by removing the

party's monopoly and advancing to this
summer a party congress that will be
empowered to clear out conservatives
on the Central Committee.
Gorbachev is not likely to water
down the platform, for fear of dis
pleasing the increasingly active and
consolidated reformers. But he also
must be careful not to antagonize con
servatives, who remain strong in the
Central Committee.
Formally, the Central Committee has
the power to replace the party leader.
Indrek Toome, premier of the Baltic
republic of Estonia and a guest at the
party meeting, emphasized the threat
from hard-liners.
"I am worried about the wish of a
fairly large proportion of the people
in this hall to reverse things, so as to
clamp down on things and return to
the old order," Toome told Soviet TV.
Politburo member Yegor K. Ligac
hev, widely identified as its leading
conservative, received warm applause
for a speech criticizing failings in
perestroika, Gorbachev's reform pro
gram, the Central Committee source
said.
"After somewhat of an enlivening in
the first two years of perestroika, the
economy began to decline, inter-ethnic
feuds reached bloodshed, people began
to experience fear, and in some places
there is practically dual power," Ligac
hev said in remarks reported by Tass.
He said the Politburo, led by Gor
bachev, and the government commit
ted "serious oversights and mistakes."
