## A
						healthy decision 
### 
THE PAST TWO years have
been rocky indeed for the De
partment of Health and
Safety.
After a former safety employee
charged the University with a host
of management problems, the di
rector of Health and Safety was
forced out. The next director of
Environmental Health and Safety
stayed only four short months
before her commitment to the Uni
versity waned.
Now the University has a safety
director who plans to stay — hope
fully. Thomas Mcßride, who
stepped down as associate dean of
the Law School to take this job,
may just be the right person to
pull Health and Safety further
from its troubled past.
Mcßride does not pretend to be
an expert on chemical or radiation

safety.
What he does have, however, is
the ability to manage and the abil
ity to solve problems.
In the 19705, Mcßride was an
associate special prosecutor in the
Watergate case and oversaw a de
partment that brought about doz
ens of convictions.
Years later, President Carter ap
pointed Mcßride to be inspector
general of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and then inspector
general of the U.S. Department of
Labor. In both positions, Mcßride
was a troubleshooter responsible
for stamping out abuses.
Although his lack of experience
on safety matters is somewhat
troubling, Mcßride brings integri
ty, managerial skills and
commitment to his job. Let's hope
he lives up to expectations.
