# The 						courage within

### 
FEBRUARY IS Black Libera
tion Month, and the range
of events and speakers offers
all Stanford students abundant op
portunities for learning, growth
and introspection.
Stanford will have the opportu
nity to hear from and learn about
a number of important people who,
driven by internal conviction and
courage, made history.
Rosa Parks, the woman who
sparked the civil rights movement
by sitting in the front of a bus,
will speak at Arroyo House Feb.
19. Stanford alumna Mae Jemison,
the first African-American female
astronaut, will give an address Feb.
15 on "Challenges faced by black
women of the 19905." And Taylor
Branch, author of the Pulitzer
Prize-winning book "Parting the
Waters: America In the King
Years," will speak Feb. 13 in
Kresge Auditorium.

These and other events are im
portant beyond the significant ed
ucational opportunities they
represent. They provide a rare
chance to understand the inner
motivations and challenges faced
by people who have made history.
The Black Community Services
Center has chosen the appropriate
theme "It Begins From Within: A
Black Introspection." Progress
toward African-American libera
tion often begins from inner
strength; the power of a movement
lies in the unshakeable conviction
of its members.
Stanford is committed to build
ing a society which respects all
people. Sometimes those efforts are
difficult and require sacrifice. Dur
ing Black Liberation Month, and
indeed, during the entire year, let
us reflect on the kinds of changes
our society must make, and the
price we are willing to pay.
