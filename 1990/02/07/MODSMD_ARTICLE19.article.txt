Upcoming AIDS survey is flawed and irresponsible

THIS YEAR, Stanford will join 23
other universities in a nation
wide HIV prevalence survey. The
study began last year with 19 colleges
and universities and an infection rate
of one in 500 was found and widely
reported.
It is crucial that any epidemiological
study of HIV performed with students
at a university involve a representative
sample of the student body. This is
especially difficult when one must
account for such variables as sexual
practices, drug use, hemophilia and
blood transfusions.
Cowell Student Health Center is
planning to participate in a study
using blood samples from students
entering the University health services

and having blood drawn for other
reasons. This study design is flawed on
several levels, rendering a non
representative sample of students.
First, only a small group of the
students entering Cowell are being
tested. Second, no information is being
collected on any demographic variables
that might ensure that this sample is
representative of all students visiting
Cowell; and third, the students who go
to Cowell are not representative of the
student body as a whole.
This is especially important when
people who know that they have HIV,
or consider themselves at risk for HIV,
may be avoiding Cowell for fear of a
breach of confidentiality or because of
other institutional barriers. In a popu

lation with a low rate of infection, the
addition or subtraction of a few posi
tive tests will dramatically influence
the study results.
Since this study is one of the few
conducted on university campuses, its
results are of great importance. Con
sidering the questionable methodology
of this study, we hold little faith in the
widely publicized statistic that one in
500 American college students is infec
ted with HIV.
The mtyority of university students
are sexually active. Considering that
the highest rates of syphilis and gonor
rhea in the United States are found in
the 20 to 24-year-old age group, the
American college student population is
at significant risk for HIV infection.

Since HIV risk analysis for individ
uals in a potentially life and death
situation is already frought with diffi
culties, introducing imprecise and
confounding information to college
students is both unnecessary and
irresponsible. The funds allocated for
this study could be better used in a
more rigorously designed epidemiologi
cal study.
Stanford University, no matter how
well intentioned, should not contribute
to a study which will potentially
obscure the true epidemiology and risk
of infection for American college stu
dents.
