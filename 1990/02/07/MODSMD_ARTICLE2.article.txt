# Campus suffers major blackout
## Switch failure causes harmless steam release at Cogen plant 
### Janine De Fao Editorial staff 
About half the campus lost power
yesterday morning when a switch
failed at a Pacific Gas and Electric
substation on Panama Street, near
Terman Engineering Building.
The switch, part of a capacitor in
a regulatory system not vital to power
supply, malfunctioned at 8:42 a.m.
while a PG&E employee was working
on it. The man was not hurt.
One witness was within 20 feet of
the substation when the malfunction
occurred.
"I heard popping sounds like a gun
and then a cracking sound like elec
tricity," she said. "I turned and saw
a yellow ball of light and white smoke.
I screamed and started running."
The witness said she could feel heat
on her back as she left the area.

known, but it caused a "short circuitj
just like when you blow a circuit in
your house," said Jeff Sultan, Stan
ford's manager of electric utilities.
"In this case, it blew a big circuit
breaker that affects the whole
campus," Sultan said. The entire
campus originally lost power, but
some areas that were unaffected
regained electricity within 20 seconds.
Most of the main Quad and other
"scattered" buildings had no power
for an hour and 20 minutes.
The delay in restoring power to
some areas was due to "communica
tion time" between PG&E workers

and their headquarters, Sultan said.
The switch failure caused a steam
release at the nearby Cardinal Cogen
eration Plant. The cogenerator is de
signed to shut down automatically
when its electrical supply is cut, ac
cording to general manager Jim Mar
zonie. Safety valves release built-up
steam as a way of protecting the
plant's boilers, he said.
"Most of the excitement was caused
by the release valve. People thought
the noise was an explosion and many
probably thought they saw smoke, but
it was only steam," Sultan said.
The switches, which stabilize and
regulate the power supply, remained
turned off indefinitely after the inci
dent, he added. Sultan said the
switches are important but not nec
essary for power transmission.
Students reported that several 9
a.m. and 10 a.m. classes were canceled
due to lack of lighting.
