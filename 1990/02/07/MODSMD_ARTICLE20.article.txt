# Lyons, ASSU ask for feedback on alcohol proposals
## 
### 
We invite all students living in the
dormitories to participate in today's
campus vote on the four proposed rec
ommendations to augment the existing
alcohol policy.
This is the first time that such a
large number of students have had the
opportunity to voice their opinion on
this issue. We encourage each of you to
read carefully the information compiled
by the ASSU Alcohol Task Force
before you vote at your house meeting
tonight.
This vote will be very helpful in
assisting us in determining sentiments
and viewpoints of the majority of stu
dents in reference to each individual
proposal. We would also like to encour
age individuals and groups to write
thoughtful statements detailing the

reasons they support or oppose particu
lar proposals. Please do so by Feb. 15,
1990, and return them to the Dean of
Student Affairs Office (Room 323, Old
Union) or to the ASSU.
