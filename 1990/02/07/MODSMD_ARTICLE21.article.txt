# Reader was wrong in criticizing Chicano community
## 
### 
In Monday's Daily, Chicano graduate
student Sergio Guerrero lamented the
lack of "sympathizers of liberal causes"
at Prof. Arturo Islas' reading from
"Migrant Souls." He also blasted Chi
cano students for not "patronizing" our
own, and disparaged "politically cor
rect" functions, because that's not
where the "real nitty gritty" takes
place.

His self-righteous indignation is sti
fling. Does he know for a fact where
to find the nitty gritty? Even if he
does, what does it matter where the
nitty gritty is, as long as students are
learning and working together?
Chicano students at Stanford are
infamous for telling each other what is
politically correct, and now we're going
to tell each other what is "intellec
tually correct" as well.
We don't need more wasted negative
energy. Whatever happened to different
strokes for different folks? Can't
Chicano/Mexican-American students
express and celebrate our culture in
different ways? Or is someone going to
tell us what is "culturally correct" as
well?
Yes, we can all listen and learn from
Prof. Islas, and many of us do, but we
don't all have the time to attend
everything our diverse and energetic
community plans. We're not perfect.
As for Guerrero's question, "Where
the hell were the members of the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Issues,
or the student rainbow coalition .. .?" I

was a very active member of the Rain
bow Agenda my first year, and a
UCMI member during the next two
years, and I was there. Look closer
next time, and quit with the judgmen
tal jumping to conclusions.
