## Tough lessons learned 
### 
THE TREMENDOUS popularity of
Robert Fulghum's book, "All I
Really Need to Know I Learned in
Kindergarten," (No. 1 on The New York
Times bestseller list, non-fiction), made
me think back on all that I learned in
kindergarten. Like Fulghum, everything
that I needed to learn, or should I say,
everything that I was supposed to learn
about how to love and what to do and
how to be, I too learned in kindergarten.
These are the things that I learned:
I learned that Jesus was white, that
Mary and Joseph were white, that Santa
Claus was white, that the Tooth Fairy
was white, that Snow White was really
white, and that I wasn't.
I learned that no matter how hard my
sisier and I wished, prayed or tried, we
cou'd never look like Barbie and Ken.
Our hair was just too nappy.
I learned that my best friend Michelle
had a black daddy and a white mommy,
and that's why she had "good hair."
I learned that Michelle didn't have a
daddy, nor did most of the other little
black kids because their daddies never
showed up for parent-teacher day. Some
of the kids didn't have mommies or
daddies, so they sat by themselves.
I learned that there was a black side
of town and a white side of town, and
that the houses on the white side of town
were larger and had bigger yards to play
in. Some of the yards even had swing
sets like the ones at school.
I learned that Dick, Jane and Spot
lived on the white side of town because
they always had a big yard to play in.
I learned that the big giant house on

the white side of town was where my
grandmother worked, and her mother
before that. I learned that my grand
mother even helped raise Dick, Jane and
Spot, and that they used Aunt Jemima
syrup too.
I learned that my great-great-granny
didn't come to America on the Mayflower.
She came on a ship from Africa.
I learned that Africa was a jungle filled
with lots of animals, especially gorillas,
apes and chimpanzees, and that they were
all ruled by Tarzan, "Lord Of The
Jungle."
I learned that Tarzan was white. And
so were G.I. Joe and Ken for that matter.
I learned how to play dolls with my
sister. I learned that I hated my sister.
I learned that I loved my sister. I learned
that my sister and I could make bubble
baths when we farted in the tub. I learned
that my sister and I had different parts.
Hearned how to play doctor. I learned
that I could be a real doctor if I worked
really really hard, got good grades and
prayed to God.
I learned that I got excited watching
people kiss on television. I learned that
sex was evil, and that masturbation was
a sin.
I learned that little boys weren't sup
posed to kiss other little boys.
I learned that my real name wasn't
Corey Lyn Davis. It was Faggot Sissy
Punk.
I learned that little boys like me
couldn't play football or baseball, and if
you tried, the other boys, especially the
bigger ones, would make fun of you or
beat you up.

I learned that Jesus
was white, that Mary
and Joseph were
white, that Santa Claus
was white, that the
Tooth Fairy was white,
that Snow White was
really white, and that I
wasn't.

I learned that black eyes really weren't
black, but blue.
I learned that I could be president if
I wanted to be, that all I had to do was
work really really hard, get good grades
and pray to God.
I learned that the picture of the black
man hanging on my grandmother's wall
was a King who was shot by a white man
for "being a leader."
And wasn't I the smartest person in
kindergarten. I learned everything that
I was supposed to learn, and more.
