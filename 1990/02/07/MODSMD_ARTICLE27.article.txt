QJs there a connection be
mtween drinking decaf
feinated coffee and water
retention or weight-gain? In
what instances is drinking reg
ular coffee possibly healthier
than drinking decaffeinated
coffee?
A. I'll assume you've already
• committed my earlier
column on coffee to memory
and I can skip the lecture on
the health dangers of caffeine.
(Is it a diuretic?)
To find out about weight
gain, I talked to Dr. H. Robert
Superko of the Stanford Center
for Research in Disease Pre
vention. Superko just finished
a study of 180 middle-aged men
who for two months either
drank no coffee or carefully
controlled amounts of regular
coffee or decaf — no cream or
sugar allowed.
I know what you are think
ing — if you drink lots of reg
ular coffee, you should lose
weight from all that exercise
jumping off the walls. A recent
report in The Daily that links
sexual activity to coffee drink
ing seems to support that idea
too.
But Superko said that at the
end of his study, there was no
significant change in body
weight between the three
groups. So much for the regu
lar coffee diet.
What Superko and his re
search team did find, however,
is that drinking decaffeinated
coffee raises cholesterol levels,
while regular coffee does not.
He said that further studies

are needed, and that the dif
fer «ice doesn't seem to be in
the caffeine, but in the kind of
bean that is used. Mild-flavored
Arabica beans are usually used
for regular coffee while more
strongly flavored Robusta
beans are used for the decaf.
Superko said he doesn't
know of any other health dis
advantages of the decaffeinated
brew — and he has checked
the scientific literature pretty
carefully.
There are, of course, some
health effects that haven't been
studied. I'll be a lot healthier
if I go for the caffeine now and
finish this column tonight,
than if I fall asleep and face
my editor without it tomorrow.
. Dinner time, today . ..
VV •pasta! I am pouring hot
water into the pan with the idea
of gaining some time (you have
to boil the water first, and then
add the pasta), but my room
mate tells me that I should use
cold water because it boils
faster.
I think it's just a joke, but
he insists it's popular wis
dom. ... Is it true?
A. I agree, it does sound like
• a joke, but since I've been
fooled before, I decided to take
no chances and ask a physics
graduate student.

This means that
(gasp!) hot water
comes to a boil
faster than cold.

Whitney White came to my
rescue and patiently explained
that if you start with cold tap
water, you have to wait for it
to warm up to the temperature
of hot tap water. After that,
the water is the same, so the
additional time until the water
boils is the same too.
This means that (gasp!) hot
water comes to a boil faster
than cold.
White did say there might
be a reason for the idea that
cold water boils faster. Hotter
water can have more dissolved
impurities than cold water, and
these can raise the boiling tem
perature. But, he says,
feet isn't likely to be noticeable
in the water from your
household pipes.
