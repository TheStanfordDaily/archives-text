# Music professor gets good vibrations

Jon Bon Jovi jumps on stage,
the crowd goes wild and he begins
to play — a violin.
Sound far-fetched? Not with
Music Prof. Max Mathews' re
cently developed device that prom
ises to increase the attractiveness
of electronic string instruments
to the popular music industry.
The device, known as a pickup,
transforms the vibrations of
strings on an electronic violin,
cello or guitar into a series of
pulses that can be amplified on
a loudspeaker. According to Math
ews, the device gives "a good
reproduction of the motion the
string is making," and should
make a normally soft instrument
like the violin loud enough for
popular music fans.
He is also currently working on
an electronic drum that performs
most of the functions of modern
synthesizers. The drummer
moves two sticks around a tablet
like drumhead to make different
sounds and effects, allowing one
musician to play complicated se
quences easily and clearly.
Mathews has been experiment
ing with electronic music for over
30 years. In 1957, he invented
computer music, the digital syn
thesis of music, as a "by-product"
of his work on simulating tele
phone sounds on computers for
Bell Labs. Once he found that he
could digitize sound waves, Math
ews discovered that any sound
could be reproduced with a com
puter.
His program to play music by
computer was the forerunner of
synthesizers and the digital re
cording techniques used on com
pact discs.
In 1986, Mathews left his job
at Bell Labs to work full-time at
Stanford on his inventions. The
improved pickup is his latest in

vention. Made of a special material
known as a bimorphic piezo
electric element, the device is ex
tremely sensitive to vibrations, in
expensive and simple to install.
While this pickup is not the
first such device, it is the most
effective one. Previous pickups
were made of other piezoelectric
materials, but were installed on
the body of the violin or the bridge
— too far away from the strings
to produce accurate signals.

Placed directly under and very
close to each string, Mathews'
pickup can capture vibrations ac
curately. In addition, he has de
signed a slotted bridge for the
violin that supports the strings
on cantilevered beams, allowing
them to vibrate more effectively.
Mathews has patented the
pickup and licensed it to Zeta
Music Systems of Oakland, which
plans to use the new technology
to build electronic violins, cellos

and guitars. By improving the
quality and reducing the cost of
these instruments the pickup
should appeal to rock and jazz
bands.
"Symphony orchestras won't
use electric violins at all," says
Mathews. "But [the pickupl will
make the violin more popular in
popular music. The violin is an
expressive instrument, and if one
group starts using them, more
should follow."

of Jon Bon Jovi and Ozzy Osbourne.
