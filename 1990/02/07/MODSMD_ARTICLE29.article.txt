Testing Einstein
Stanford scientists have begun final as
sembly on Gravity Probe-B, a space-based
experiment designed to test Einstein's Gen
eral Theory of Relativity.
The experiment, conceived in 1960 by
Prof. Leonard Schiff, involves launching four
quartz gyroscopes into earth orbit. The gyro
scopes, the most spherical objects ever made,
will be set spinning while detectors measure
tiny changes in the axis of rotation.
The axis changes manifest the curvature

in space-time around the earth and the effect
of the earth's rotation on its gravitational
fields. Neither of these effects has ever beeA
tested by previous experiments.
The project will be tested on the Space
Shuttle in 1993, and a launch of the complete
satellite is planned for 1996.
Two win medals
Earth Sciences Prof. Steven Gorelick and
Assoc. Prof Paul Segall have won two of
the J.B. Macelwane Medals to be presented

this year by the American Geophysical
Union.
The medals are presented annually for
"significant contributions to the geophysical
sciences by a young scientist of outstanding
ability."
Gorelick, a hydrogeologist, is president of
the Internationa] Commission on Ground
water.
Segall, a geophysicist, specializes in fault
mechanism and crustal deformation studies.
He is a participant in the Parkfield Earth
quake Prediction Experiment.
