# Celebrating Chicano culture
## Fellows Program seeks continuity, commitment 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
"Soy Chicano/'Cause I'm
brown/And I'm proud/And I'll
make it in my own way."
It's a rallying song of the na
tion's second largest minority
group, a minority that by the year
2030 is projected to be the largest
population in California. It is a
celebration of the Chicano expe
rience in the Southwest and
throughout the country.
It is this culture that the Stan
ford Chicano Fellows Program
has been teaching students about
for 18 years.
Despite increased student inter
est in the program, however, Stan
ford has not made "an attractive
package" for other professors to
teach in the program, according
to junior Anita De Lucio, the un
dergraduate scholar in the Chi
cano Fellows. "The people who
end up losing are the students,"
she said.
De Lucio, chair of the Educa
tional Rights Committee of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, has been coordinating
a campaign to increase student
awareness of the Chicano Fellows
and Chicano Studies Programs.
"It's been on MEChA's plate for
some time now," she said, adding

that "well-directed energy" from
concerned students will be best at
effecting change.
"I'm very impressed at the ex
tent to which students have sup
ported" the program, said
UC-Davis History Prof. Luis Ar
royo, acting director and one of
two visiting faculty members.
"Every year, exceptional
courses have been offered, but we
need continuity," Arroyo said,
noting that classes currently
change every year because they
are taught by visiting professors.
The program, created in 1971
by the School of Humanities and
Sciences and the Office of Grad
uate Studies, consists of a direc
tor, visiting faculty who teach
three courses each and a graduate
fellow who teaches a course in the
spring. Arroyo, who has returned
to the program after teaching as
a visiting professor in 1982-83,
said the structure has remained
basically the same over the years.
The only change occurred last
year, when an undergraduate
scholar was added to the program
to conduct in-depth research and
write a thesis. The program does
not grant degrees.
Arroyo, who is serving as acting
director while director Tomas
Ybarra-Frausto is in New York
City, suggested other changes to
improve the program.
"To provide students with op
portunities, we need to make core
courses," Arroyo said. In three
years, he hopes to see six to 10
regular course offerings with
large enrollments.
Arroyo, De Lucio and M. Alicia
Arriz6n, a graduate teaching fel
low, brainstormed a list of possi
ble core courses, including:
• Introduction to Chicano cul
ture and life;
• Chicano history;
• Psychological aspects of the
Chicano experience;
• Civilization of the Southwest,
which should be comparable to
other departmental courses in
Latin American, Spanish and Por
tuguese culture and civilization;
• Chicano politics and organiza
tion;
• Sociology of the Chicano fam
ily — not simply as an element
of culture, but as a contribution
to the success of people in society;
• Introduction to Chicano
literature;
• Contemporary Chicano cul
ture, led by an anthropologist
highlighting "rural and urban
problems, the interaction of
Mexican-Americans and foreign
immigrants . . . and what it all
means for the United States";
• Chicano murals and art, a less
introspective form than most
Western art because much of it
is expressed through graffiti,
spray can art and murals; and
• La Chicana In literature,

focusing on the female working
class in the Southwest.
This spring, Arriz6n will be
teaching a three-unit Chicano
Studies course called "Introduc
tion to Contemporary 'Latina'
Writers: A Feminist Discourse in
a Socio-Historical Context."
Arriz6n noted that all the
courses must recognize the vari
ety of Latino cultures. "Chicanos
are not the only Latino group."
Other Latinos, from Nicara
guans in Chicano barrios to Sal
vadoran children in East Palo
Alto, frequently complain to her:
"I don't really relate to your
group."
The program should not deal
narrowly with Chicano issues, Ar
riz6n said, but must bring out
others which "relate to them all
as a whole," while maintaining the
uniqueness of the Chicano expe
rience.
UC-Berkeley Education Prof.
Guadalupe Vald6s, the other visit
ing faculty member, said Berkeley
now requires all students to take
an American Cultures course that
emphasizes multicultural interac
tion. Berkeley also has offered a
Chicano Studies bachelor's degree
since the 19705.
