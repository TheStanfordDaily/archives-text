# Celebrating Chicano culture
## Fellows Program seeks continuity, commitment

"Soy Chicano/'Cause I'm
brown/And I'm proud/And I'll
make it in my own way."
It's a rallying song of the na
tion's second largest minority
group, a minority that by the year
2030 is projected to be the largest
population in California. It is a
celebration of the Chicano expe
rience in the Southwest and
throughout the country.
It is this culture that the Stan
ford Chicano Fellows Program
has been teaching students about
for 18 years.
Despite increased student inter
est in the program, however, Stan
ford has not made "an attractive
package" for other professors to
teach in the program, according
to junior Anita De Lucio, the un
dergraduate scholar in the Chi
cano Fellows. "The people who
end up losing are the students,"
she said.
De Lucio, chair of the Educa
tional Rights Committee of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, has been coordinating
a campaign to increase student
awareness of the Chicano Fellows
and Chicano Studies Programs.
"It's been on MEChA's plate for
some time now," she said, adding

that "well-directed energy" from
concerned students will be best at
effecting change.
"I'm very impressed at the ex
tent to which students have sup
ported" the program, said
UC-Davis History Prof. Luis Ar
royo, acting director and one of
two visiting faculty members.
"Every year, exceptional
courses have been offered, but we
need continuity," Arroyo said,
noting that classes currently
change every year because they
are taught by visiting professors.
The program, created in 1971
by the School of Humanities and
Sciences and the Office of Grad
uate Studies, consists of a direc
tor, visiting faculty who teach
three courses each and a graduate
fellow who teaches a course in the
spring. Arroyo, who has returned
to the program after teaching as
a visiting professor in 1982-83,
said the structure has remained
basically the same over the years.
The only change occurred last
year, when an undergraduate
scholar was added to the program
to conduct in-depth research and
write a thesis. The program does
not grant degrees.
