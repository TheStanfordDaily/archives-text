## Cardinal netters steamroll to pair of stellar victories Men win without Stark 
### Steven Apfelberg 
The Stanford men's tennis team went to the Al
maden Valley Athletic Club expecting a fairly routine
win against the San Jose State Spartans. It came
back with the mission accomplished.
Except for senior Jeff Cathrall and sophomore
Alex O'Brien, everyone romped. Cathrall, playing
No. 2 singles, didn't feel 100 percent, losing 6-3,
6-0 to the Spartans' Brian Eagle.

O'Brien played sluggishly but still rallied to win
4-6, 7-6, 7-6 at the No. 1 singles spot.
"It was a good match," Asst. Coach John Whit
linger said. "Alex didn't play his best but was still
tough enough to come up with a victory."
As the scores indicate, the rest of the matches
proved easy for the Cardinal. Junior Glenn Solomon
crushed the Spartans' Billy Ball at No. 3 singles
and then teamed with classmate Jason Yee to defeat
Eagle and Ball 6-2, 6-3 at the No. 2 doubles position.
Yee won his No. 5 singles match in double bagel
fashion, 6-0, 6-0. O'Brien and junior Dan Turbow
captured the No. 1 doubles by the score of 6-2, 6-4.
San Jose State forfeited the No. 6 singles and No.
3 doubles matches.
The story of the day, though, may have been
freshman Jared Palmer's 6-1, 6-2 victory at No. 4
singles. Palmer, one of the most highly touted fresh
man in the country, had not played a competitive
match since October because of a knee injury.
Stanford Coach Richard Gould was anxious to
see how the delay would affect his stellar recruit.
Although Palmer's score was lopsided, it will take
a few more matches before he returns to top form.
After the match, Palmer said his knee felt "good."
"It hurt when I pushed off, but I could still play
as hard as I wanted," Palmer said. "I wasn't sharp
so there was no sense for me to play any higher
in the lineup. I was glad to have a fairly easy match
to ease back into competitive play."
Card notes
The team's two other top freshman recruits, Jonathan
Stark and Alexis Hombrecher, missed today's match be
cause they were competing in the Volvo Tennis Tourna
ment of San Francisco.
