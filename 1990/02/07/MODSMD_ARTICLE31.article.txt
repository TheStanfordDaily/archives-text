# Birch shows championship form
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Though the Stanford women's
tennis team is no longer perfect,
yesterday'B match with Utah did
nothing to suggest they are not
mighty close.
Led by NCAA singles champion
Sandra Birch, who recorded a per
fect 6-0, 6-0 victory over Kristen
Siegmund, the Cardinal romped
past the 24th-ranked Utes and
upped its season mark to 3-0.
Utah fell to 4-3.

Cardinal 8
Utes 1

Playing in her first dual meet
of the season, Birch showed no
signs of rust as she started fast
and never slowed down. In under
an hour, the Birch arsenal of
rocket forehands and crisp volleys
shot down the outmatched Sieg
mund without skipping a beat.
"I was looking forward to play
ing," Birch said afterward. "It was
nice to be out there."
Nice for Birch and the Cardinal
but certainly not for Utah. By the
time all the singles matches were
nine games old, Stanford led in
each one. The power tennis of the
Cardinal women was most evident
at No. 2 and No. 6 singles where
Debbie Graham and Kylie John
son were in action.
Johnson dropped only one game
in the second uet as she knocked
off Ruth Ann Stevens 6-0, 6-1.
Graham bested Susie Costa 6-1,
6-1 in impressive fashion.
At No. 5 singles, Mario Car-ruth
made short work of Stephanie Ball
6-2, 6-2. Lisa Green did similarly
as she dispatched Julie Kempin
6-3, 6-2 at No. 3.

The only match that showed the
slightest signs of trouble — and
they were (Juite slight, indeed —
was the No. 4 match between
Heather Willens and Liz Fox.
Down 3-4 in the first set, though,
Willens won the next three games
and cruised to a 6-4, 6-2 victory.
At No. 1 doubles, Utah coun
tered the Birch-Graham duo with
Stevens and Costa. The often
questionable Volvo/Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association
rankings had the Ute tandem
rated three spots ahead of Birch
and Graham.
The NCAA finalists from 1989,
though, made a strong statement
that the ranking was off base.
Birch and Graham recorded a 6-3
first-set win before running into
a little trouble.
Stanford's team recorded a
service break to open the second
set only to lose the next three
games to fall back 3-1. Fine shot
making by Graham gave the Car
dinal back a break quickly and
also gave the pair momentum.
Before the Utes could react they
were down 5-3 and Costa was
serving. Soon, an angle volley
from Graham gave she and Birch
as match point. Graham converted
it with a cross-court putaway to
seal the 6-3, 6-3 win.
Johnson and Willens squan
dered three match points at 5-4
in the second set of their match
with Kempin and Ball at No. 2
doubles. At 5-6 and 0-40, they
saved three set points before even
tually dropping the game and sec
ond set. The Cardinal captured a
close final |et and were 6-2, 5-7,
6-4 winners.
Carina Rolley and Valerie Wil
son were 6-2, 6-2 losers to Sieg
mund and Fox. It was the first
match Stanford has lost in a dual
meet this season.
