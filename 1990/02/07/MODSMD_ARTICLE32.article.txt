# Men's basketball naysayers are guilty of desertion
## 
### 
There is a sudden sense the Stanford
men's basketball is going nowhere
in a hurry.
After four straight losses on the road
— the first winless streak of that length
since a five-game skid to close out the
'86-87 season — the Cardinal's NCAA
tournament chances obviously took a
nosedive.
At this point, the only hope the team
has of making the big show is to win
seven of its final eight regular season
games and probably of couple more in
the Pacific 10 Conference Tournament.
However, the sudden desertions from
the "Hey, this team isn't all that bad"
camp are quite unwarranted. In the press
conference following the Oregon State
game, Coach Mike Montgomery noted
that after Stanford beat UCLA people
began expecting more from the team than
perhaps they were capable of doing.
What a difference a few months makes.
Before the season began, the squad was
picked to go nowhere. Montgomery's
streak of 11 winning seasons was thought
to be in jeopardy.
A couple of early wins, a relatively

respectable loss to No. 2 Kansas and the
upset of UCLA had the fair-weather
faithful marking March Madness off on
their calendars.
Then the team faced Arizona on the
Wildcats' home court in McKale Center.
Arizona does not lose in McKale Center
and holds the longest home winning
streak in the nation. Yet the scrappy
Cardinal, playing without star center
Adam Keefe for the last 15 minutes of
the first half, had a chance to win the
game.
In defeat, the squad raised fans' hopes
even further. Until Arizona State, that is.
When a sluggish Stanford effort led to
a loss in Tempe, it set the ball rolling

downhill. A last-second airball at Oregon
in a one-point defeat would be followed
by a dismantling at the hands of Oregon
State's superb guard, Gary Payton.
Now the team rests at 12-7, 4-6 in
conference play. The frontrunners in the
Stanford community have given up on
the boys in cardinal and white. "Another
nothing season," they say. "Mont
gomery's already packed his bags for
greener pastures," some mutter.
For starters, it is anything but a noth
ing season. With five home games
remaining — Stanford has only dropped
one Maples Pavilion matchup in the past
two seasons — the Cardinal has an ex
cellent shot at an NIT berth.
Put that in perspective. When Todd
Lichti left for the NBA and five seniors
departed as well, the pundits predicted
that '89-90 would be a "rebuilding" year.
Instead the Cardinal has its sights set
on playing in the postseason. In the 77-
year history of Stanford basketball, there
has been little in the way of tournament
appearances to talk about.
If the team indeed gets an invite to
the NIT, it would be anything but a

disappointment. And, even if March
means finals for the basketballers, a solid
record and the development of a very
young team would be an achievement in
and of itself.
A cursory look at the team's play
this season provides some disap
pointments, but also plenty of good
news. Keefe has established himself as
the best post player in the conference —
and of the best in the nation.
The 6-foot-9 sophomore will likely
finish his Stanford career as the school's

all-time best percentage shooter, one of
its top three rebounders and its second
leading scorer. He will then cart his
credentials to the NBA, incidentally.
In the backcourt, the Cardinal was
thought to be in nuyor trouble. The start
ing guards, Kenny Ammann and John
Patrick, had played a combined 86
minutes last season. Instead of falling on
their faces, though, Ammann and Patrick
have held their own.
Both are quality three-point shooters
and Patrick has run the offense far better
than many had expected. Freshman
Marcus Loilie played 31 minutes in the
two games weekend and seems to be es
tablishing himself as the team's third
guard.
Lollie's jump shot needs work, but he
is a point guard in the truest sense. He
is most at home bringing the ball up
court and directing traffic. Best of all,
Loilie is willing to drive the lane and
create all sorts of havoc for opposing
defenses to deal with. As he gains more
