# Spikers seek NCAA crown in 1990
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
They've got three guys playing
two varsity sports at Stanford,
three redshirt freshmen in cri
tical roles, two more freshmen
playing on the second team, a
starting middle blocker who
stands taller than only his 5-
foot-11 setter, and a transfer.
They've also got what most
coaches consider the deepest
lineup in the country and the
best shot at the collegiate title
in 1990.
The Stanford men's volleyball
team (1-1), currently No. 2 in
the nation, has established itself
as a permanent fixture among
the nation's volleyball elite. After
finishing 25-6 last season with
a second-place NCAA finish, the
Cardinal was picked early as the
odds-on favorite to bring home
the brass in 1990.
Volleyball Monthly, the publi
cation which accurately pre
dicted the NCAA women's
volleyball champion late last
year, boldly bypassed No. 1-
ranked, defending-champion
UCLA to tab Stanford as 1990's
victors. Considering the facts,
though, that decision is hardly
a surprise.
Coach Fred Sturm returns
five of the six starters from last
year's runner-up squad, and can
boast the addition of a number
of quality reserves.
Dan Hanan, who anchors the
team, has shown little regression
from his level of play that last

year earned him first-team All-
America status. As the Cardi
nal's tallest middle blocker,
Hanan has consistently drawn a
crowd of attention at the net
from opposing blockers and a
mass of exultations from observ
ers.
With a game that Coach
Sturm feels features no weak
nesses, the 6-5 senior has firmly
established himself as the num

ber one hitter on the squad and
the first man to whom setter
Parker Blackman always looks.
Despite the defensive attention
his eminent status has attracted,
Hanan has continued his torrid
play in 1990. His talent was
visible two weeks ago in his dom
inance of the UCSB-Michelob
Light Tournament, and during
the team'B demolition of Cal
State-Northridge Saturday.

"Dan is like another coach on
the court when he plays," Sturm
lauded. "He's a force of stability
and he carries a big load for us."
The graduation of Olympian
Scott Fortune has forced a sub
stantial reallotment of the hit
ting burdens this year. A
beneficiary of these changes is
sophomore Dave Goss, who red

shirted last season.
Playing in the non-passing out
side hitter position, Goss often
represents the second option in
the Cardinal offense behind
Hanan. His role is defined to em
phasize offense, and he has filled
it well.
Leading the team in kills in the
last two matches, Goss has be
come accustomed to punishing the
opponent's hardwood with em
phatic hits and has cemented his
place in the starting lineup.
It wasn't supposed to be so easy,
though. In high school, the 6-5
hitter was a multi-sport athlete
whose success in each perhaps
diverted attention from his volley
ball prowess. According to Coach
Sturm, Goss was basically an un
known commodity until he raised
some eyebrows at the Olympic
Festival his senior year. Stanford's
recruitment of Goss may have
been the steal of the decade.
After redshirting for experience
purposes last season, Goss has
been thrust immediately into the
only vacancy from last year's
starting group. Despite his rela
tive unfamiliarity with the team,
his efforts have not escaped ap
preciation.
"Dave gives us lots of help with
his hitting," Sturm said. "He's
very athletic and he has a very
dynamic jump serve. When he's
hitting well, he gives us a big
boost."
Few will argue which player at
Stanford, maybe in the nation,
has the most balanced assortment
of skills. Adept at ball handling
and passing, tenacious on the
jump serve, accomplished at
blocking, and demonstrative on
kills, sophomore Duncan Black
man provides an arsenal few can
contain.

of the two starting swing hitter
positions which features him as
both a primary passer and as a
high-priority hitter.

tensive follow-through, Blackman
finished third on the team last
year in both kills and digs. He
has continued to post the same
numbers with increasing fre
quency this season, contributing
the most digs on the team in the
match against Northridge.
"Duncan is one of our primary
passers," Sturm said. "He is a
very good blocker, he is carrying
a bigger hitting load, and he's very
quick on defense. We definitely
need a good season from him to
be successful."
Every special team seems to
have that one elusive player you
can call "the Natural," a person
who just has that special feel for
the game that can be neither
taught nor understood, merely
identified. Starting swing hitter
John Alstrom, according to Sturm
has got that "instinct."
The 6-3 junior from Newport
Beach impresses observers with
his modesty of character as much
as his abilities on the court.
Projecting a silent intensity,
Alstrom has established himself
as a top-rate defensive force.
"John is a great defensive
player," Sturm explained. "He is
a primary passer who is very
steady, smart and consistent. But,
sometimes he goes unnoticed be
cause of his personality."
Alstrom's lack of recognition
has hardly slowed him — in
Sturm's opinion, he is the most
steadying influence on the court.
Altstrom has shined this season
for the Cardinal, digging numer
ous balls to continue critical
rallies and displaying powerful
bursts of hitting.
Starting opposite Hanan is a
sure-fire formula for anonymity
in the volleyball world. Senior
Craig Forsyth, a four-year starter,
has done his best to shake the
spell as the "other" first-team
middle blocker for the Cardinal.
While absent in the headlines,

the 6-3 Forsyth has earned rave
reviews from Sturm. Frequently
blocking players several inches
taller than he, Forsyth, in Sturm's
estimation, "may be the team's
best blocker."
"Since last fall," Sturm said,
"Craig's been playing the best vol
leyball of his career. In the past,
he has been really hampered by
injuries but now he's the health
iest he's ever been. He's arrived."
Forsyth is always capable of
taking over a game, and you don't
have to look far for proof. Recent
ly, he dominated the third game
of the Northridge match, stuffing
several attackers and terminating
rallies with timely kills.
When someone said that you
should pick on people your own
size, 5-11 Cardinal starting setter
Parker Blackman wasn't listen
ing. He has recently made it a
point of embarrassing foes of far
greater frame in a variety of ways.
Whether he is confusing people
with his offense or blocking them
one-on-one, Blackman seems to
consistently rise to the occasion.
A four-year starter, Parker
Blackman is in Sturm's view an
extraordinarily "smart player who
knows the system well."
His skills span the horizon as
he excels in resurrecting errant
passes, digging and even front row
play. Against Northridge, he
posted 58 assists to go with three
service aces, five digs, five kills
and two blocks.
"Parker was the difference [that
night]," Northridge Coach John
Price said. "He just played great."
Sturm finds his personality the
most appealing aspect of the
senior's game. A true team player,
he can always be heard taking the
blame for a teammates' mistake
and promising that it won't hap
pen again. "He's an enthusiastic
player who is the emotional leader
on the court," Sturm said.
"Parker's the guy that everyone
on the team likes to play with."

Playing in the non-passing out

has continued to post the same

Every special team seems to
have that one elusive player you
can call "the Natural," a person
who just has that special feel for
the game that can be neither

John Alstrom, according to Sturm
has got that "instinct."
The 6-3 junior from Newport

Projecting a silent intensity,
Alstrom has established himself
as a top-rate defensive force.
"John is a great defensive

a primary passer who is very
steady, smart and consistent. But,
sometimes he goes unnoticed be
cause of his personality."
Alstrom's lack of recognition
has hardly slowed him — in
Sturm's opinion, he is the most
steadying influence on the court.
Altstrom has shined this season
for the Cardinal, digging numer

tensive follow-through, Blackman
finished third on the team last
year in both kills and digs. He
has continued to post the same
numbers with increasing fre
quency this season, contributing
the most digs on the team in the
match against Northridge.
"Duncan is one of our primary
passers," Sturm said. "He is a
very good blocker, he is carrying
a bigger hitting load, and he's very
quick on defense. We definitely
need a good season from him to
be successful."
Every special team seems to
have that one elusive player you
can call "the Natural," a person
who just has that special feel for
the game that can be neither
taught nor understood, merely
identified. Starting swing hitter
John Alstrom, according to Sturm
has got that "instinct."
The 6-3 junior from Newport
Beach impresses observers with
his modesty of character as much
as his abilities on the court.
Projecting a silent intensity,
Alstrom has established himself
as a top-rate defensive force.
"John is a great defensive
player," Sturm explained. "He is
a primary passer who is very
steady, smart and consistent. But,
sometimes he goes unnoticed be
cause of his personality."
Alstrom's lack of recognition
has hardly slowed him — in
Sturm's opinion, he is the most
steadying influence on the court.
Altstrom has shined this season
for the Cardinal, digging numer
ous balls to continue critical
rallies and displaying powerful
bursts of hitting.
Starting opposite Hanan is a
sure-fire formula for anonymity
in the volleyball world. Senior
Craig Forsyth, a four-year starter,
has done his best to shake the
spell as the "other" first-team
middle blocker for the Cardinal.
While absent in the headlines,

the 6-3 Forsyth has earned rave
reviews from Sturm. Frequently
blocking players several inches
taller than he, Forsyth, in Sturm's
estimation, "may be the team's
best blocker."
"Since last fall," Sturm said,
"Craig's been playing the best vol
leyball of his career. In the past,
he has been really hampered by
injuries but now he's the health
iest he's ever been. He's arrived."
Forsyth is always capable of
taking over a game, and you don't
have to look far for proof. Recent
ly, he dominated the third game
of the Northridge match, stuffing
several attackers and terminating
rallies with timely kills.
When someone said that you
should pick on people your own
size, 5-11 Cardinal starting setter
Parker Blackman wasn't listen
ing. He has recently made it a
point of embarrassing foes of far
greater frame in a variety of ways.
Whether he is confusing people
with his offense or blocking them
one-on-one, Blackman seems to
consistently rise to the occasion.
A four-year starter, Parker
Blackman is in Sturm's view an
extraordinarily "smart player who
knows the system well."
His skills span the horizon as
he excels in resurrecting errant
passes, digging and even front row
play. Against Northridge, he
posted 58 assists to go with three
service aces, five digs, five kills
and two blocks.
"Parker was the difference [that
night]," Northridge Coach John
Price said. "He just played great."
Sturm finds his personality the
most appealing aspect of the
senior's game. A true team player,
he can always be heard taking the
blame for a teammates' mistake
and promising that it won't hap
pen again. "He's an enthusiastic
player who is the emotional leader
on the court," Sturm said.
"Parker's the guy that everyone
on the team likes to play with."
