# Spikers seek NCAA crown in 1990

They've got three guys playing
two varsity sports at Stanford,
three redshirt freshmen in cri
tical roles, two more freshmen
playing on the second team, a
starting middle blocker who
stands taller than only his 5-
foot-11 setter, and a transfer.
They've also got what most
coaches consider the deepest
lineup in the country and the
best shot at the collegiate title
in 1990.
The Stanford men's volleyball
team (1-1), currently No. 2 in
the nation, has established itself
as a permanent fixture among
the nation's volleyball elite. After
finishing 25-6 last season with
a second-place NCAA finish, the
Cardinal was picked early as the
odds-on favorite to bring home
the brass in 1990.
Volleyball Monthly, the publi
cation which accurately pre
dicted the NCAA women's
volleyball champion late last
year, boldly bypassed No. 1-
ranked, defending-champion
UCLA to tab Stanford as 1990's
victors. Considering the facts,
though, that decision is hardly
a surprise.
Coach Fred Sturm returns
five of the six starters from last
year's runner-up squad, and can
boast the addition of a number
of quality reserves.
Dan Hanan, who anchors the
team, has shown little regression
from his level of play that last

year earned him first-team All-
America status. As the Cardi
nal's tallest middle blocker,
Hanan has consistently drawn a
crowd of attention at the net
from opposing blockers and a
mass of exultations from observ
ers.
With a game that Coach
Sturm feels features no weak
nesses, the 6-5 senior has firmly
established himself as the num

ber one hitter on the squad and
the first man to whom setter
Parker Blackman always looks.
Despite the defensive attention
his eminent status has attracted,
Hanan has continued his torrid
play in 1990. His talent was
visible two weeks ago in his dom
inance of the UCSB-Michelob
Light Tournament, and during
the team'B demolition of Cal
State-Northridge Saturday.

"Dan is like another coach on
the court when he plays," Sturm
lauded. "He's a force of stability
and he carries a big load for us."
The graduation of Olympian
Scott Fortune has forced a sub
stantial reallotment of the hit
ting burdens this year. A
beneficiary of these changes is
sophomore Dave Goss, who red
