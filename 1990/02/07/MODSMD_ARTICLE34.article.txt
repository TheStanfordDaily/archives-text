# Football money is spread around

### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
In his Tuesday column, Chris
Crader raised some relevant ques
tions about the importance of
football within the scheme of col
lege athletics. I agree with Chris
that the emphasis placed on foot
ball has been blown out of pro
portion by the economic factors
that surround the game.

Commentary

Crader cited the distribution of
funds within the Stanford Ath
letic Department as proof that the
priority placed on football here is
unfair. The case of scholarship al
location was the most convincing
part of the argument.
However, I hope I can make it
clear that no football revenue is
used to fund scholarships; raiher,
it is used to underwrite the op
erating expenses of the other
sports on campus. All of the
money for athletic scholarships is
raised through private donations
to either the Buck (men's sports)
or Cardinal (women's) clubs.
The revenue made by the foot
ball team is extensive, and it is
crucial to the functioning of the
athletic program here. The money
generated from gate receipts, con

legiate sports at Stanford.
Because the athletic department
relies so heavily on football reve
nue, it must make an effort to
maximize those profits. A good
football team means an additional
20,000 spectators at home games,
and two or three more television
appearances each year.
All schools in Division I football
have 95 scholarships, and in order
for Stanford to compete with
them it must have the same. With
less scholarships than competing
teams, the program would suffer.
Less money would come in, and
the financial situation would
worsen.
This is not to imply that the
football program is inherently
more important than any other
sport on this campus. I know too
many athletes who love their sport
as much as I loved mine to make
such a foolith comment. Football
is simply the most profitable. Be
cause its profits are crucial to the
survival of most of the other
sports on The Farm, it must sur
vive in order to give the other
sports an opportunity to exist.
