# Little 'O,' lots of 'D' in IMs

### Rob Johnstone Staff writer 
As a result of the randomness
of the scheduling in intramural
athletics, quite often an IM
game features two teams that
are on slightly different levels
of quality. A fit analogy would
be pitting Notre Dame's football
team against UC-Santa Cruz.
There was an unusually large
number of these types of games
this week at Maples Pavilion.
With wins seemingly guaranteed
before the start of these games,
teams battled to see how long
they could keep the opposing
team from scoring.
The winner in this category
was Biz 2D's C-league team, who
beat Rinconada 36-15. Biz's de
fense proved too tough for Rin
conada, holding them scoreless
for the first 19:04 of the first
half. Rinc hit a free throw with
56 seconds remaining in the
first half to score their first
points of the game. During this
time Biz had gone on a 22-0
run, resulting in a 22-1 halftime
lead. Rinconada did regain some
composure in the second half,
playing Biz even, resulting in
the 36-15 final.
Coming in second in the
shutout-attempt category was

3L's 40-11 victory over Flo-Mo
5 in a Thursday B-league game.
3L, the third-year law students,
opened up the game with an
18-0 run. Flo Mo's first and only
basket of the first half came
13:05 into the half, resulting in
a 28-2 halftime score. 3L eased
up the pace in the second half,
cruising to the 40-11 victory.
The bronze medal for the
shutout-attempt category goes
to Biz lA's women's team in its
game with Trancos, but the
medal was a bittersweet victory
for the Biz team.
The game evolved into a de
fensive struggle early, as neither
team scored for the first six
minutes, and the game appeared
to be headed for intramurals'
first scoreless tie in a basketball
game. But Biz then ran off three
quick points to take a 3-0 lead,
which held up until Trancos'
basket 13 minutes into the half
cut the Biz lead to 3-2.
Trancos again had scoring
problems at the beginning of the
second half, scoring only one
basket in the first 15 minutes
of the half. Biz opened up a 16-7
lead during the Trancos dry
spell, apparently ready to coast
to an easy victory with only five
minutes remaining. But
Trancos finally woke up and put

on a spectacular run.
Scoring more points than they
had in the first 35 minutes, the
Tracoans outscored Biz 10-0,
giving them a stunning 17-16
comeback win.
In a stellar comeback win, the
Betas won a battle of undefeated
C-league teams by beating Team
Gus 61-42 in overtime. The
Betas weathered a horrid shoot
ing performance in the first half
to only trail 27-21 at halftime.
After a Team Gus run in the
start of the second half sparked
by Danny Camacho, Team Gus
led 36-27 with five minutes
remaining.
The Betas then went on a 13-4
spurt over the last five minutes
to tie the score up at 40-40, led
by the shooting and defensive
play of Erik Johnson, Mark
Mayfield and Tim Trujillo.
The overtime period was
dominated by the Betas, who
seemed to turn the intensity up
a notch in the extra stanza.
They also implemented an im
portant change in their game
plan, utilizing their size advan
tage inside to get easy lay-ups.
A close game turned into a
blowout, as the Betas (3-0) out
scored Team Gus 21-2 in over
time for the 61-42 victory.
