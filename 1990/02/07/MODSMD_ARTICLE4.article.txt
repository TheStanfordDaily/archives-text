# Finalist's withdrawal stuns Asian-Americans
## Community disillusioned by Nee's actions 
### Quan Phung Staff writer 
Nothing that is important comes easily.
The Asian-American community learned
that this week as a controversy erupted
over one of the University's finalists for
the Asian-American scholar position.
If anything, Cornell Sociology Prof. Vic
tor Nee's withdrawal of his candidacy and
denouncement of ethnic studies as "moving
backwards" on Monday indicated there was
a need for better communication and
clearer definition about the role of the
Asian-American scholar.

News analysis

The Asian-American community has
been looking for a distinguished scholar
ever since Gordon Chang, the history lec
turer who taught Stanford's only Asian-
American class last year, left for a
tenure-track position at UC-Irvine.
The desire for Chang's replacement
sparked a highly charged protest and was
one of the factors leading to the May
takeover of University President Donald

Kennedy's office.
Because the emotion
from last year's events is
still strong, many advo
cates of Asian-American
studies were offended and
upset by Nee's criticism of
institutionalized ethnic
studies.
Rick Yuen, director of
the Asian American Activ-

ities Center, said Nee "misrepresented him
self' when he spoke to the community on
Monday.
"He used it as a stage to express his
views on Asian-American studies," said
Yuen. Although that was the original pur
pose of the forum, no one expected the
shocking statements that followed.
Commitment to building Asian-American
studies at Stanford is clearly an important
consideration in choosing the scholar. Nee's
lack of commitment to the field made Judy
Wu, issues chair for the Asian American
Student Association, wonder "why he
decided to come."
Yuen said that the attempt to attract


Nee
Nee was a waste of time and
money that could have been better
spent on another candidate.
In fact, the search committee
has invested many hours and
much money in the scholar search
already.
Before choosing the list of
finalists, the committee ensured
that anyone selected for an inter
view would be approved by the
department which the candidate
would enter.
Trying to sell the idea of a pro
fessor who will only devote half
time to an individual department
is not always easy. Last year's
debate over faculty appointments
to the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control, which
ended in the near-collapse of the
center, demonstrated that point.
In addition, the committee
placed several advertisements in
The Daily to inform and include
all members of the Stanford com
munity in the process of selecting
a scholar.
Nee's surprising statements
threatened to make a mockery of
the entire process.
However, Nee said he clearly
informed the search committee
that he wasn't interested in the
position prior to arriving on
campus. Yuen, a member of the
search committee, said he did not
know of any such declaration.
Nee said being "forced" to teach
two courses in Asian-American
studies per year would be limiting
to the scholar.
"I just came to look at Stanford
and talk to the faculty members

and students about my research,"
he said. Unlike the formal recruit
ment he underwent at UCLA last
week, Nee said Stanford's recruit
ment was "somewhere between
formal and informal."
For now, Nee said yesterday his
interest in any position at Stan
ford has been "postponed indefi
nitely." In an interview with The
Daily after his presentation to the
Asian-American community, he
expressed interest in a regular
Sociology Department position.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Ewart Thomas, who author
ized the search committee, said
students and committee members
should not be so "picky" about
looking for an Asian-American
scholar who will initiate an Asian-
American studies program.
"People can contribute in many
ways, and we should not get so
hung up on how many units and
what classes the person will
teach," Thomas said.
Sociology Department Chair
Morris Zelditch, who declared that
Nee is a distinguished sociologist,
declined to comment on the situ
ation.
The search committee and the
Asian-American community now
look to the remaining finalists —
Chang and Georgetown Compar
ative Literature Prof. David Liu
— in hopes of ridding the com
munity of the confusion and frus
tration that Nee's words
provoked.
Wu said she hopes students who
attended the presentation Monday
will not be "demoralized" by what
has happened and will continue
attending the presentations and
voicing their concerns.
