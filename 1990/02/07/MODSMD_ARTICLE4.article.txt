## Community disillusioned by Nee's actions

Nothing that is important comes easily.
The Asian-American community learned
that this week as a controversy erupted
over one of the University's finalists for
the Asian-American scholar position.
If anything, Cornell Sociology Prof. Vic
tor Nee's withdrawal of his candidacy and
denouncement of ethnic studies as "moving
backwards" on Monday indicated there was
a need for better communication and
clearer definition about the role of the
Asian-American scholar.

The Asian-American community has
been looking for a distinguished scholar
ever since Gordon Chang, the history lec
turer who taught Stanford's only Asian-
American class last year, left for a
tenure-track position at UC-Irvine.
The desire for Chang's replacement
sparked a highly charged protest and was
one of the factors leading to the May
takeover of University President Donald

Kennedy's office.
Because the emotion
from last year's events is
still strong, many advo
cates of Asian-American
studies were offended and
upset by Nee's criticism of
institutionalized ethnic
studies.
Rick Yuen, director of
the Asian American Activ-

ities Center, said Nee "misrepresented him
self' when he spoke to the community on
Monday.
"He used it as a stage to express his
views on Asian-American studies," said
Yuen. Although that was the original pur
pose of the forum, no one expected the
shocking statements that followed.
Commitment to building Asian-American
studies at Stanford is clearly an important
consideration in choosing the scholar. Nee's
lack of commitment to the field made Judy
Wu, issues chair for the Asian American
Student Association, wonder "why he
decided to come."
