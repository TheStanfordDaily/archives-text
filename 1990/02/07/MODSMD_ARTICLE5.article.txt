# Field hockey will lose varsity status next year
## 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
The athletics budget axe has fallen, and
it appears that the women's field hockey
team will be the first victim.
The team will be dropped from a varsity
to a club sport next year due to the Ath
letics Department's shortage of funds, ac
cording to sources within the department.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger is out of
town, and other Athletics Department ad
ministrators reached would not confirm or
deny the reports. The cut has not yet been
announced, but field hockey players con
firmed the report.
The Athletics Department, which has
stated since summer that it is strapped for
funds, expects a budget deficit of $ 1 million
this year. The budget deficit has sent Uni
versity administrators scrambling for ways
to reduce expenditures.
Field hockey and other Varsity II sports
that do not produce revenue have been
considered for budget cuts. Field hockey
received approximately $20,000 from the
Athletics Department this year, said team
member Beth Lewinger, a senior.

According to field hockey captain Carolyn
Clevinger, this funding was used to pay
for the coach, team travel and referees for
home games.
"The biggest blow is that our coach is
no longer with the University, and the
team can't afford her on the salary she's
being paid now," Clevinger said.
Coach Sheryl Johnson, a three-time
member of the U.S. Olympic team, told
the field hockey team about the decision
last Thursday after being informed of the
news by Tom Beckett, associate athletic
director. Johnson and Beckett were both
unavailable for comment.
Johnson also called potential recruits and
told them about the decision, Clevinger
said.
"Unfortunately, I think these were the
top recruits of the country coming in this
year — and if they're serious about field
hockey, they're going to go to a school that
treats them with respect," Lewinger said.
The team was told that it will still be
recognized as complying with NCAA reg
ulations and will have the same schedule
next year even though it will be a club
sport.
