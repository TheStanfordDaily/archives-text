# Studying 'Fun 101' across the nation
## Humphries learns what students do for enjoyment 
### Martha Brockenbrough Editorial staff 
Evan Humphries has taken
the road less traveled — less
traveled by most college stu
dents, that is.
Since September, he has been
motoring across country study
ing ways that students at top
colleges and universities have
fun — despite challenging aca
demic environments. And by
next September, the Swarth
more College junior hopes to
have written a combination
guide book and collection of
anecdotes on the subject.
Humphries rode his motor
cycle onto the Stanford campus
yesterday, in just one stop along
the way of his nationwide tour.
So far, he has visited 24 of the
top schools listed by U.S. News
and World Report's annual sur
vey of colleges. "I had to narrow
my list somehow," he explained.
Humphries has "known for a
while that (he] needed some time
off." Yet he doubted that studv

on the Farm appear happier than their counterparts elsewhere.
ing at another school or working
would be the kind of break he
needed.
Wanting to remain in a college
environment — without the work
— Humphries threw "whatever I
thought I might like to take with
me" and hit the road. "You really
can take time out to create some
of the experience that you want,"
Humphries said.
Humphries recognizes certain
problematic trends in the nation's
top schools. "The emphasis is on
excelling, rather than experienc
ing and learning," he said, adding
that students "miss out on the
real advantages" that college of
fers.
"College is becoming a stepping
stone in the career of students
who have aspirations for financial
and social success," he said,
rather than being an end in itself.
"That lifestyle misses out on what
it is like to be young."
Despite Humphries' criticism of
college students' emphasis on suc
cess, he doesn't suggest that life
has to be all fun and games.
"People are here to study hard,"
he said, a fact which makes having
fun that much more important.
Humphries said Stanford stu
dents are happier than their coun
terparts at other universities.
"People stress the fact that overall
it's a fairly well-rounded social
scene. . .. There's a lot of recrea
tion activities, which goes along
with the good weather."
At some other schools,
Humphries has observed that
while students "like their schools

and take pride in them, they often
ask themselves, 'Is it worth it?' "
On Saturdays, he explained,
Swarthmore students might sit
around "watching the UCLA
game and say, 'God, why aren't
we there?' "
Humphries will not opt for the
UCLA move, as he plans to return
to Swarthmore next year. "When
you've come through a college ex
perience, even though things may
not be like you wanted, to change
colleges midstream is to give up
that common link [between you
and your classmates].
"It always comes down to
people," Humphries said.
When he pulls up to a new
campus, he looks around for
people who "look like they have
the time of day,"and he asks them
if they have stories about how
they have fun at college.
"People are by and large good
natured and receptive," he said.
"I can always find someone who'll
let me sleep on their couch or
their floor."
Humphries said his odyssey has
been frustrating at times. "Keep
ing up the enthusiasm as I'm roll
ing into a college late at night is
tough . . . but when I've just met
some really cool people I can keep
going, no matter what."
Humphries said his goal to
write a book on his experiences
has kept him going. "If I'd been
traveling just to travel ... I
wouldn't have gotten anywhere."
He almost didn't get farther
than Rhode Island when his right
front axle broke in December. He
went home to Seattle to work for
a month at an engineering con
sulting firm and earned enough
money to buy a motorcycle.

scene. . .. There's a lot of recrea
tion activities, which goes along
with the good weather."
At some other schools,
Humphries has observed that
while students "like their schools

and take pride in them, they often
ask themselves, 'Is it worth it?' "
On Saturdays, he explained,
Swarthmore students might sit
around "watching the UCLA
game and say, 'God, why aren't
we there?' "
Humphries will not opt for the
UCLA move, as he plans to return
to Swarthmore next year. "When
you've come through a college ex
perience, even though things may
not be like you wanted, to change
colleges midstream is to give up
that common link [between you
and your classmates].
"It always comes down to
people," Humphries said.
When he pulls up to a new
campus, he looks around for
people who "look like they have
the time of day,"and he asks them
if they have stories about how
they have fun at college.
"People are by and large good
natured and receptive," he said.
"I can always find someone who'll
let me sleep on their couch or
their floor."
Humphries said his odyssey has
been frustrating at times. "Keep
ing up the enthusiasm as I'm roll
ing into a college late at night is
tough . . . but when I've just met
some really cool people I can keep
going, no matter what."
Humphries said his goal to
write a book on his experiences
has kept him going. "If I'd been
traveling just to travel ... I
wouldn't have gotten anywhere."
He almost didn't get farther
than Rhode Island when his right
front axle broke in December. He
went home to Seattle to work for
a month at an engineering con
sulting firm and earned enough
money to buy a motorcycle.
