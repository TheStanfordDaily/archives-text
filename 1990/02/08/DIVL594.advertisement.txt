If you are an undergraduate and no
one is willing to give you a job that actually
requires you to supervise people and man
age money, how are you going to get busi
ness experience?
We at the Stanford Student Directory be
lieve that you don't have to be a graduate to
take on the responsibilities of corporate execu
tives. Every year, we select responsible and
entrepreneurial Stanford undergraduates to
be in charge of the Student Directory. And they
are completely responsible for all phases of
the project and make all decisions concerning
it.
So if you are a responsible Stanford
undergraduate interested in this unique oppor
tunity, then we want to talk to you. We are cur
rently accepting applications for the Project
Director and the Business Manager posi
tions. Complete application materials are
available in the Student Organization Office
(SOS) located on the 2nd Floor of Tresidder
Union. Applications are due on Friday,
February 8, at noon.
STANFORD STUDENT DIRECTORY,
NOT YOUR REGULAR SUMMER JOB.
