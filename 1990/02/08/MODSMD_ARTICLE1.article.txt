# High liability limiting size of frat parties
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
What do you call 200 people drinking and dancing
at a fraternity house until the wee hours in the
morning? Most people would call it a party, but
fraternity members are starting to call it an insur
ance liability.
The momentum to limit the size of fraternity
parties by only allowing invited guests to attend
has built up in response to events at Stanford and
around the nation over the past few years.

News analysis

Last week, the Sigma Chi fraternity "closed" its
parties, becoming the second fraternity in the past
year to do so. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity,
which closed its parties last December, was the first.
Sigma Chi president Mark McNally said the fra
ternity decided to close its parties mainly because
a new insurance policy taken by the national fra
ternity required them to do so.
In the past, the Sigma Chis have obtained insur
ance policies on their own, but it is becoming in
creasingly difficult for fraternities to get insurance.
Many are being left with almost no alternative but
to accept a "closed party" clause in their policies.
McNally said he thinks the decision to close Sigma
Chi parties was a good one.
"Over the past few years, bad things have hap
pened to other fraternities," he said. "So far, we
have been very fortunate. With the new policy, it
will be easier for us to throw safe parties."
The decision to close parties is not an easy one
for housed fraternities to make. Stanford has a long
history of open fraternity parties and many students
make party-hopping on weekends a way of life.
Fraternity members fear that by closing their
parties they will alienate students who enjoy the
current openness of fraternity parties. They also
are concerned that students who are already
predisposed against fraternities will add elitism to
the list of "isms" that fraternities are accused of
promoting.
In an environment such as Stanford's, where the
very existence of the housed fraternity system is
always in question, fraternity members have a lot
to be concerned about.
Interfraternity Council president Todd Ortega said
the administration's policy of not allowing new fra
ternities to obtain housing is a clear sign that,
"beyond a doubt, they are against housed fraterni
ties."
Some students and administrators view housed
fraternities as "Animal House"-type dens of wild
behavior. Housed fraternities become the little cor
ners on which the University's "thousand points of
light" mission to promote multiculturalism and
equality have failed to shed light. They become the
scapegoats for the entire system â€” the places where
racism, sexism, alcoholism and drug use flourish.
But, for many others, housed fraternities are pres
tigious organizations with a long history of service
and commitment to the community. And even op
ponents of the fraternity system have come to agree
that housed fraternities are the hub of social life
on campus.
Ortega said the IFC plans to look more closely
at the issue of closing fraternity parties in the
upcoming weeks, adding that the issue of "closed
parties" is a very important one.
