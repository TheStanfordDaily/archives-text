# High liability limiting size of frat parties
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
What do you call 200 people drinking and dancing
at a fraternity house until the wee hours in the
morning? Most people would call it a party, but
fraternity members are starting to call it an insur
ance liability.
The momentum to limit the size of fraternity
parties by only allowing invited guests to attend
has built up in response to events at Stanford and
around the nation over the past few years.

News analysis

Last week, the Sigma Chi fraternity "closed" its
parties, becoming the second fraternity in the past
year to do so. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity,
which closed its parties last December, was the first.
Sigma Chi president Mark McNally said the fra
ternity decided to close its parties mainly because
a new insurance policy taken by the national fra
ternity required them to do so.
In the past, the Sigma Chis have obtained insur
ance policies on their own, but it is becoming in
creasingly difficult for fraternities to get insurance.
Many are being left with almost no alternative but
to accept a "closed party" clause in their policies.
McNally said he thinks the decision to close Sigma
Chi parties was a good one.
"Over the past few years, bad things have hap
pened to other fraternities," he said. "So far, we
have been very fortunate. With the new policy, it
will be easier for us to throw safe parties."
The decision to close parties is not an easy one
for housed fraternities to make. Stanford has a long
history of open fraternity parties and many students
make party-hopping on weekends a way of life.
Fraternity members fear that by closing their
parties they will alienate students who enjoy the
current openness of fraternity parties. They also
are concerned that students who are already
predisposed against fraternities will add elitism to
the list of "isms" that fraternities are accused of
promoting.
In an environment such as Stanford's, where the
very existence of the housed fraternity system is
always in question, fraternity members have a lot
to be concerned about.
Interfraternity Council president Todd Ortega said
the administration's policy of not allowing new fra
ternities to obtain housing is a clear sign that,
"beyond a doubt, they are against housed fraterni
ties."
Some students and administrators view housed
fraternities as "Animal House"-type dens of wild
behavior. Housed fraternities become the little cor
ners on which the University's "thousand points of
light" mission to promote multiculturalism and
equality have failed to shed light. They become the
scapegoats for the entire system — the places where
racism, sexism, alcoholism and drug use flourish.
But, for many others, housed fraternities are pres
tigious organizations with a long history of service
and commitment to the community. And even op
ponents of the fraternity system have come to agree
that housed fraternities are the hub of social life
on campus.
Ortega said the IFC plans to look more closely
at the issue of closing fraternity parties in the
upcoming weeks, adding that the issue of "closed
parties" is a very important one.
"When fraternities put on a
party, they put themselves in the
spotlight," Ortega said. "They put
themselves at risk. For example,
what happened with the [Phi
Delta Theta fraternity] — the in
cident was horrible, but they were
put on suspension. If the same
thing had happened at a dorm,
would the dorm have been put on
suspension?"
At the start of last quarter, an
intoxicated freshman was hit by
a pickup truck on Junipero Serra
Boulevard after allegedly leaving
a Phi Delt party.
Though housed fraternities
have resident assistants and are
under the auspices of Residential
Education, they are treated dif
ferently from dorms.
They have selective member
ship and no resident fellows. In
exchange for that freedom, they
are also expected to take more
responsibility for their actions.
Over the years, tragic events
such as the drowning death of a
student three years ago in Lake
Lagunita and this year's accident
on Junipero Serra have stirred up
feelings that housed fraternities
should clean up their acts.
Though not in direct response
to these incidents, the decision by
the SAEs and the Sigma Chis to

close their parties was certainly
indirectly affected by those events.
The SAEs and the Sigma Chis
are adopting different approaches
to "closed parties." The SAEs
keep a running guest list that stu
dents can get on by simply calling
ahead of time. The members hand
out cards that guests must show
at the door before they are allowed
to enter.
The Sigma Chis, on the other
hand, have a guest list made up
of friends and acquaintances who
they think will want to come,
McNally said.
"We decided not to keep a run
ning guest list, because if all
someone has to do is call up to
get invited, what is the point of
closing parties?" McNally said.
Since they have closed their
parties, both fraternities have
started to concentrate more on
reaching out and meeting new
people. The Sigma Chis have
decided to start inviting dorms to
barbecues every Friday, some
thing they used to only do during
Rush.
It remains to be seen which
manner of closing parties will
work out the best.
McNally said he feels all housed
fraternities should close their par
ties. But he thinks there should
not be a mandate from the IFC.
"Each fraternity should decide
the issue on its own and work
out their own way of doing
things," McNally said.

McNally said he feels all housed
fraternities should close their par
ties. But he thinks there should
not be a mandate from the IFC.
"Each fraternity should decide
the issue on its own and work
out their own way of doing
things," McNally said.
What do you call 200 people drinking and dancing
at a fraternity house until the wee hours in the
morning? Most people would call it a party, but
fraternity members are starting to call it an insur
ance liability.
The momentum to limit the size of fraternity
parties by only allowing invited guests to attend
has built up in response to events at Stanford and
around the nation over the past few years.

Last week, the Sigma Chi fraternity "closed" its
parties, becoming the second fraternity in the past
year to do so. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity,
which closed its parties last December, was the first.
Sigma Chi president Mark McNally said the fra
ternity decided to close its parties mainly because
a new insurance policy taken by the national fra
ternity required them to do so.
In the past, the Sigma Chis have obtained insur
ance policies on their own, but it is becoming in
creasingly difficult for fraternities to get insurance.
Many are being left with almost no alternative but
to accept a "closed party" clause in their policies.
McNally said he thinks the decision to close Sigma
Chi parties was a good one.
"Over the past few years, bad things have hap
pened to other fraternities," he said. "So far, we
have been very fortunate. With the new policy, it
will be easier for us to throw safe parties."
The decision to close parties is not an easy one
for housed fraternities to make. Stanford has a long
history of open fraternity parties and many students
make party-hopping on weekends a way of life.
Fraternity members fear that by closing their
parties they will alienate students who enjoy the
current openness of fraternity parties. They also
are concerned that students who are already
predisposed against fraternities will add elitism to
the list of "isms" that fraternities are accused of
promoting.
In an environment such as Stanford's, where the
very existence of the housed fraternity system is
always in question, fraternity members have a lot
to be concerned about.
Interfraternity Council president Todd Ortega said
the administration's policy of not allowing new fra
ternities to obtain housing is a clear sign that,
"beyond a doubt, they are against housed fraterni
ties."
Some students and administrators view housed
fraternities as "Animal House"-type dens of wild
behavior. Housed fraternities become the little cor
ners on which the University's "thousand points of
light" mission to promote multiculturalism and
equality have failed to shed light. They become the
scapegoats for the entire system — the places where
racism, sexism, alcoholism and drug use flourish.
But, for many others, housed fraternities are pres
tigious organizations with a long history of service
and commitment to the community. And even op
ponents of the fraternity system have come to agree
that housed fraternities are the hub of social life
on campus.
Ortega said the IFC plans to look more closely
at the issue of closing fraternity parties in the
upcoming weeks, adding that the issue of "closed
parties" is a very important one.
"When fraternities put on a
party, they put themselves in the
spotlight," Ortega said. "They put
themselves at risk. For example,
what happened with the [Phi
Delta Theta fraternity] — the in
cident was horrible, but they were
put on suspension. If the same
thing had happened at a dorm,
would the dorm have been put on
suspension?"
At the start of last quarter, an
intoxicated freshman was hit by
a pickup truck on Junipero Serra
Boulevard after allegedly leaving
a Phi Delt party.
Though housed fraternities
have resident assistants and are
under the auspices of Residential
Education, they are treated dif
ferently from dorms.
They have selective member
ship and no resident fellows. In
exchange for that freedom, they
are also expected to take more
responsibility for their actions.
Over the years, tragic events
such as the drowning death of a
student three years ago in Lake
Lagunita and this year's accident
on Junipero Serra have stirred up
feelings that housed fraternities
should clean up their acts.
Though not in direct response
to these incidents, the decision by
the SAEs and the Sigma Chis to

close their parties was certainly
indirectly affected by those events.
The SAEs and the Sigma Chis
are adopting different approaches
to "closed parties." The SAEs
keep a running guest list that stu
dents can get on by simply calling
ahead of time. The members hand
out cards that guests must show
at the door before they are allowed
to enter.
The Sigma Chis, on the other
hand, have a guest list made up
of friends and acquaintances who
they think will want to come,
McNally said.
"We decided not to keep a run
ning guest list, because if all
someone has to do is call up to
get invited, what is the point of
closing parties?" McNally said.
Since they have closed their
parties, both fraternities have
started to concentrate more on
reaching out and meeting new
people. The Sigma Chis have
decided to start inviting dorms to
barbecues every Friday, some
thing they used to only do during
Rush.
It remains to be seen which
manner of closing parties will
work out the best.
