# Two homeless frats won't go unhoused

They lost their homes in the
earthquake, but Delta Tau
Delta and Theta Xi will not
lose their status as housed fra
ternities, according to Diana
Conklin, director of the Row.
The University will overlook
this year's pledge quota for
these fraternities and assist
them in regaining houses on
campus, Conklin said.
Both the Taxi and Delt
houses were closed after the
Oct. 17 earthquake due to se
vere structural damage, forcing
members of both fraternities
to split up and find alternate
housing.
The Taxi house will reopen
in September, following exten
sive repairs, but the Delt house
will remain closed indefinitely.
However, the University is
taking steps to provide the
Delts housing for next year as
well.
"The Delts will have a house,
for sure," Conklin said.
Conklin would not specify
which houses are being looked
at but said the University is
"considering several possibili
ties right now."
No decision has been made
yet, but Conklin said the Delts'
new house "should definitely

be chosen" by spring Rush so
that rushees can look at the
house they will live in, should
they decide to pledge.
Prospective Taxi pledges will
be shown the outside of their
fraternity house but will not
be able to view the inside until
September, when the house
reopens.
In order for a fraternity to
retain housed status, it must
pledge a certain number of
"sophomore equivalents" —
students with two years of
guaranteed housing left — each
year. This year the University
will waive the quota for Taxi
and Delt members.
Should a fraternity fail to ful
fill its quota three out of four
consecutive years, it may be in
danger of losing its house.
Neither Taxi members nor
the Delts have met the rush
criterion for three of the past
four years.
However, "given the situa
tion that they're in, the Uni
versity quota just won't be
enforced," Conklin said.
Both fraternities may en
counter difficulties attracting
rushees this year, due to their
housing problems and the dif
ficulties they anticipate in
securing locations for Rush
parties.
