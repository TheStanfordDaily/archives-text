## Nicaragua releases political prisoners 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — The
Sandinista-dominated National As
sembly yesterday approved amnesty
for more than 1,000 political prisoners,
pre-empting a key opposition pledge
less than three weeks before elections.
The Sandinista party predicted it
will win the Feb. 25 elections by a
landslide and that the United States,
unable to ignore the results, will move
to normalize relations with Soviet
backed Nicaragua. - ■**»-
The amnesty covers 1,189 people,
most of them accused of taking part
in the U.S.-backed Contra insurgency.
The amnesty also covers 39 ex
officers of the hated National Guard
that defended Anastasio Somoza's

rightist dictatorship, which the Sandi
nistas overthrew in 1979.
Freedom for political prisoners, end
ing the military draft and reviving Nic
aragua's shattered economy are key
planks in the platform of Ortega's
main opponent, Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, publisher of the opposition
newspaper La Prensa and leader of
the U.S.-backed United National Op
position.
UNO, a 14-party coalition, is the
Sandinistas' main challenger in the
general election.
The language in the Barricada arti
cle lacked the acrimony that usually
accompanies government comments on
the United States, and reinforced a

common Sandinista theme of late, a
desire for normal relations.
Barricada paraphrased Interior Min
ister Tomas Borge as saying the San
dinistas will garner at least 70 percent
of the vote in the elections, placing
them "in unsurpassable conditions for
the government of the United States
not only to recognize the results, but
to start normalizing relations with
Nicaragua." Political observers and
non-U.S. diplomats generally agree
that while the Sandinistas have an
impressive campaign machine, wide
spread discontent over the economy
might give UNO a victory at the ballot
box.
