MOSCOW (AP) — The Communist
Party that for decades swore its red
tide would cover the globe bowed to
a different revolution yesterday and
agreed to allow alternative political
parties to compete for control of the
Soviet Union.
The decision amounts to an ac
knowledgment that new political forces
have taken root and that it is no longer
possible or desirable to crush them
with the repressive tactics of the past,
which ranged from mass murders un
der dictator Josef Stalin to the dissi
dent arrests preferred by Leonid I.
Brezhnev.
The decision by the party's Central
Committee to give up the Commu
nists' constitutional monopoly on
power was a triumph of political ma
neuvering by President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev. He packed the meeting of the
249-member body with more than 700
other officials, many of them progres
sives who took the floor to demand
radical reform.
In the end, the guests also were
allowed to vote on the new party plat
form, said Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a
famed eye surgeon and one of the par
ticipants. He spoke in an interview on
Red Square during a break in the
closed-door meeting.
"Article 6 will no longer be, there
will be a multiparty system. There will
be a normal democracy," Fyodorov
said, referring to the article in the
Soviet Constitution that guarantees
the Communists a leading role.
"We cannot rule out the emergence
of new parties," Politburo member
Vitaly I. Vorotnikov said in remarks
reported by the official Tass news
agency. "But we Communists are not
going to surrender our positions. Just
as any party in the world, we shall be
waging a struggle for our rights."
Fyodorov said that only maverick
Communist Boris N. Yeltsin voted
against the platform that called for
abolition of Article 6, which calls the
party the "leading and guiding" force
in Soviet society.
Tass and Radio Moscow reported the
approval of the platform but did not
provide immediate details. They said
the document would be published in
official newspapers later.
