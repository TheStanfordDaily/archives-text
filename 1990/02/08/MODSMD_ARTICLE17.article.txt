## Unrealistic vision 
### 
Hughes' vision for
our Greek system
is far from ideal

STANFORD may seem like a
strange world to some people.
Michael Hughes is one of
them.
As fraternal affairs adviser,
Hughes envisions 60 to 70 percent
membership in the Greek system
as an ideal for this University. He
calls himself a "rah-rah flag
waver" for fraternities and soror
ities
Additionally, he would like to see
these groups perform campus-wide
educational programs and, at the
same time, host smaller parties so
groups within the Greek system
will get to know one another better.
Unfortunately, Hughes hasn't
been around long enough to un
derstand what life at Stanford is
really about.
Unlike large public universities,
much of Stanford's social life
centers around dormitory activites.
Programs and parties are both part
of what is termed "residential ed
ucation" â€” a continuing social as
well as academic learning process
based in the residences.
Stanford's philosophy of student
life is not based on exclusivity.
While the Greek system does make
contributions to the University and
is beneficial to many students, a
system that is subjectively selective
should not be the focus of social

life at Stanford. A school where
the majority of students are in
volved in fraternities and sororities
puts pressure on all students to
join these groups, an option that
is financially impossible for many.
Hughes doesn't seem to have a
good understanding of what Greek
life means to Stanford students.
Many students pledge fraternities
and sororities knowing that Greek
life is fairly mellow here and that
they will still have time to get in
volved in other aspects of Stanford
life.
The number of students that
rush and actually pledge each year
is small; currently 22 percent of
the student body is Greek. If most
students don't want to be part of
the Greek system now, it is un
likely they would want to expand
it to be the dominant social activity
of the University.
Hughes also seems to be con
fused as to what exactly his role
is. While as fraternal affairs ad
viser he should have a positive at
titude toward Greek organizations,
being a "rah-rah flag-waver" prob
ably goes beyond the professional
scope of his position. As the sole
administrator for the Greek sys
tem, he should also be serving as
a moderator for their activites so
he can objectively represent both
the interests of the University .and
fraternal organizations.
Hughes' visions of Stanford and
what it should be are unrealistic.
Maybe after getting better ac
quainted with student life here
he'll have a better understanding
about the world according to Stan
ford students.
