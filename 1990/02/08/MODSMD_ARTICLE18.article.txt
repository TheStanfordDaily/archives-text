Demoting field hockey to club sport insults players

ON THURSDAY, Feb. 1, the
Stanford varsity feld hockey
team had a mandatory meeting
at lunch. At that meeting our coach
told us that the University had cut our
funding, cut her position and was
demoting our status to a club sport —
with the understanding that if we win
our division next season the Athletic
Department will recognize us as a
varsity sport and send us to NCAA
regionals.
As a varsity athlete and a Stanford
student, I am apalled and saddened to
receive such treatment from the Athle
tic Department. Performance-based
acceptance serves as insult rather than
incentive when our team has lost our
varsity standing and our coach.
Coach Sheryl Johnson is a three
time Olympian and was Northern
Pacific Coach of the Year in 1985 and
1987. During the six years she has

been here our team peaked at number
five in the nation, won the NorPac
Conference three times and appeared
in three NCAA playoffs. However, the
Athletic Department under the supervi
sion of Andy Geiger is so much in debt
that he is attempting to make $1.5
million in cutbacks next year.
As a result, Geiger decided to target
the Field Hockey team.
I consider myself incredibly lucky to
have been able to be a part of a var
sity team at Stanford during my first
three years here. It has immeasurably
changed, broadened and improved my
experience at Stanford. I cannot ex
press the pride that comes from
walking ofT the field after Division I
competition.
I am not forgetting the hardship,
toil, repetitiveness and frustration that
is also involved in playing a sport. I
have clocked my share of hours of

soreness, hesitantly begrudged my free
afternoons and grumbled at doing the
first, last and every sprint in between.
Varsity athletics have probably been
my biggest source of frustration and
discouragement at college and so it is a
tribute to their greatness that nothing
that I know of could have convinced
me not to play.
Nothing that is, except the Athletic
Department. Geiger thinks that by
allowing Field Hockey to continue as a
club sport he is depriving my team
mates and myself none of the above
pleasures. Such an assertion is false.
If the caliber and intensity of varsity
and club sports are the same, why
doesn't the Athletic Department
demote every sport except the money
making enterprises to club status and
everyone, the athletes and administra
tors, could be happy?
Such a scenario is just as ridiculous

as one where an athletic department
operates in a $1.5 million deficit. I
realize neither scenario can ever exist
and as a consequence there will have
to be some cutbacks next year that
nobody, including the Athletic Depart
ment, is happy about. I am sorry that
as a result my team and some of my
closest friends are the ones who are
going to suffer, and I am also sorry
that I am forced to be bitter about it.
I can accept that the Athletic De
partment must make cutbacks. It just
is painful that it has to be us. It
seems such a shame that it is not a
priority for the Athletic Department to
let as many individuals as possible
benefit from varisty sports when it
seems so worthwhile and so obtainable
