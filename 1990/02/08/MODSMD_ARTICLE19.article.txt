# Childhood memories still painful to recall
## 
### 
I suspect that a number of Daily
readers were upset by Corey Davis'
column yesterday, since in the few
hours after the paper hit the streets I
had already heard a number of people
comment that they are tired of being
made to feel guilty for being white and
being blamed for the situation of black
people in the United States today.
It is unfortunate that people have
this knee-jerk reaction. The automatic
assumption that a black writer is nec
essarily writing about racism with an
intent to blame is as closed-minded
and irresponsible as the assumption
that a conservative is a racist. We need
to look past the labels and really listen
to what people are saying.
Davis is right on with his depiction

of what it is like to be a black child in
the United States, and it is about time
that someone shared the tragedy. He is
doing so without casting any blame.
Blame, at this point, is irrelevant.
Change is what is important. Read
the column as an explanation of where
we are coming from, so that you might
better understand our need to keep on
struggling. With education and progres
sive change, perhaps my children won't
be psychologically stunted the way I
was:
At age three, it was already clear to
me that white dolls were beautiful and
that black dolls, whose features
resembled my own curly hair, brown
skin and flat nose, were ugly. This
may seem like a trivial point of refer
ence, yet consider the significance of
dolls to a 3-year-old girl.
At age four, I began to alienate my
daddy. I didn't like going out into the
world with him because people looked

at us like we were intruders and
treated us like we were bad. This
never happened when I was with my
mommy. My father is black, my
mother is white. Four years old.
