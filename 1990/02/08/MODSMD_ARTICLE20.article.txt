# Salaries don't reflect value of nurses' job
## 
### 
Budget cuts never come at a con
venient time for any organization.
However, it's more than just a coinci
dence to have Stanford University
Hospital management announce their
recent intentions just when their nurs
ing staff begins contract negotiations.
It shows either a lack of management's
ability to plan or careful intent to
thwart any increase in economic gains
for nurses.

I'm one nurse who remembers local
newspapers headlines of Sept. 1989
that were not about axing the budget,
but rather quoted salaries of Stanford
cardiac surgeons at greater then
$350,000. It seems strange to be con
sidered an equally important member
of a cardiology health care team yet
earn less than one-seventh that
amount. Maybe some are more equal
than others.
