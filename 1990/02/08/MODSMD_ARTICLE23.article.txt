## Beyond the coloring book 
### 
YOU MIGHT THINK, quite mis
takenly, that the pastimes of child
hood are trivial joys without stress
or contemplation. Surely, you do not
recall the world of coloring bodes, Legos
and Barbies as being an intellectual bur
den.
And yet, the simple act of coloring a
book with crayons is not without a
weighty consideration.
The integral concept of color balance
must not be forgotten. If the tulips in
the lower left corner of the page are
crayoned in magenta, the adjacent roses
must be of a different hue. If one house
sports a red roof, the neighboring house's
roof must be of a markedly different
shade so as to lend the picture a sense
of variety.
The heavy patch of sky blue at the top .
of the page is invariably balanced J
symetrically to a sprawl of grass-green
crayon on the bottom. The intelligent
youngster senses that, except for the
dominant white background, all colors
must be proportionally represented to
contrive an appearance of harmony pleas
ing to the eye.
Unfortunately, the intelligent young
ster does not always make an intelligent
college admissions officer. In fact, the
coloring book mentality, when applied off
paper, can be quite frightening.
This time, the college admissions offi
cers wield the crayons, and they have
decided that there are simply too many
Asian-Americans in the campus coloring
book. Their decision is based on reasons
other than aesthetics.
Indeed, many universities are reacting
to what is being dubbed "the Asian In

vasion." Although last year Asian-
Americans made up only 6 percent of the
state population, they made up 25 percent
of the University of California system
and 8 to 17 percent of the freshman
classes at Stanford, Harvard, Yale,
Brown, Princeton and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
David Garner, president of the Univer
sity of California system, publicly ex
pressed concern last year about Asian-
American "overrepresentation," saying
that this would make it more difficult
to find slots for Hispanic and black stu
dents.
His words betray a mentality that envi
sions a campus dominated by whites and
sprinkled with a few minorities here and
there for the appearance of "social prog
ress." And although University of Cali
fornia officials have consistently denied
the existence of racial quotas for admis
sions, it is difficult to believe when quotes
such as Garner's are coupled with mount
ing evidence of Asian-American entrance
curtailment.
After hitting a high mark in 1983,
Asian-American enrollment at UC-
Berkeley gradually declined over a period
of four years despite a marked increase
of qualified Asian-American applicants.
UC-Berkeley Prof. Ling-Ching Wang,
a Chinese-American, commented that "As
soon as the percentages of Asian-
American students began reaching double
digits at some universities, a red light
went on. Since then, Asian-American ad
missions rates have either stabilized or
declined. University officials see the prev
alence of Asian-Americans as a problem
and they have begun to look for ways to

slow down Asian-American admissions.
Are they scared of Berkeley's becoming
an Asian University? They're shaking in
their socks."
A qualified student, regardless of race,
is a qualified student. To impede entrance
based on other than academic reasons
constitutes a mentality that has strayed
far from the purpose of education. Aca
demic institutions flourish not because
of the differences in racial make-up, but
because of the academic qualifications or .
talents each student has.
This is not, however, to suggest that'
the admissions process should be
colorblind. A system that completely dis
regards race would be a system that fails
to acknowledge discrimination. The con
cept of affirmative action — of bolstering
admissions for minorities and disadvan
taged groups — is noble in its cause to
promote social equality.
It is only when affirmative action is
skewed, when quotas are used to curtail
rather than bolster, that the system
begins to function like a child with a
coloring book. This time, however, it is '
a question not of crayons or two
dimensional tulips, but rather, the course
of one's life.
