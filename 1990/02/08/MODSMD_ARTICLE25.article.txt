## Kevin Moore Columnist ignored historical context of racial discrimination 
### 
AT NO TIME in the history of the
United States has the issue of race
been far from the center of the
national consciousness. The original
framers of the Constitution struggled
with the moral quandary of allowing
slavery in a "nation dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created
equal." The tension created between the
North and South over the next 80 years
as a direct result of the institution of
slavery threatened to break the nation
apart; and indeed a war was fought that
finally put an end to the slavery.
Yet the tension continued. In the South
— after a brief period of reconstruction
where the Union army forced the white
South to treat its black citizens in a
manner guaranteeing their constitutional
rights — laws and social institutions were
created that left the now "free" black
person as much a pariah in the land of
his birth as he had ever been as a slave.
The early 20th century northern black
black fared hardly better. Lynchings and
legal segregation were not a part of his

life, but police brutality and de facto seg
regation were. Although looking at a
white woman would probably not cost
his life — as it cost Emmet Till in Mis
sissippi — trying to get a job in the
white-controlled labor unions of any city
large or small in the north would cost
any black person his self esteem and
inevitably lead to a small personal death
inside.
Imagine being a citizen in the land of
your birth, the land your parents and
grandparents had slaved on and given
their lives to, only to be told that the
jobs and schools and housing and other
wealth of the nation were not for you,
but for whites. Imagine seeing second
generation immigrants being allowed to
move where they pleased, being allowed
access to those coveted union jobs that
ensured a living wage and a measure of
self respect. And finally, imagine living
on with the only measure of hope ob
tained from the conviction that things
had to get better, if only because they
could not get any worse.

It is in this historical context that we
find ourselves today. And it is this his
torical context that we must not lose
sight of when we discuss the issue of
race in America.
Sadly, Alex Grant, in his column
"Toward colorblind society," shows either
an inability or an unwillingness to look
beyond the obvious and toward the truth
regarding the racial history of America
and one of the results of that history:
affirmative action.
Grant states that "Affirmative action
can only be justified if there is very real
evidence that minorities were denied
equal opportunities in the particular com
pany or university." There are very real
problems with this line of reasoning that
a close scrutiny of American history
reveal.
Grant's thinking fails to take into ac
count that any company or university in
America exists only in the context of the
overall society. The citizens of America
only have the opportunity to open a busi
ness or build a university if the resources

of the nation are sufficient.
Given this, and given the inarguable
fact that American black people have con
tributed at least a proportionate share
to the development of resources in
America, it is only just that black and
other minority Americans who contrib
uted mightily to this nation have access
to all of the resources of the nation.
Grant's line of reasoning is also suspect
in that it fails to look at the reality of
racism as we know it. He would subject
any affirmative action to what is called
a strict scrunity test. This test is flawed
not only in theory, failing to admit that
it is often impossible to prove racist intent
when it obviously exists, but in reality
because the definition of racist intent is
left to the interpretation of the judge.
So that while I might look at a fire
department in a county that is 50 percent
black yet has never had a black fireman
as an obvious case of racial discrimina
tion, another judge may say that there
is no record of intent to discriminate,

therefore there was no discrimination.
Clearly a policy that only acts when
the strict scrutiny test is applied not only
acts capriciously but often at odds with
common sense, because when we get right
down to it, we all know that particular
fire department has practiced discrimi
nation.
Grant further fails to take into account
the practical side of his theoretical argu
ment. If the University of California
opens a new campus, it would be obvious
that the new campus has not discrimi
nated in the past, yet would Grant abolish
affirmative action there? Surely the mi
nority taxpayers have a right to profit
from the benefits provided by this state
resource. And because the main benefit
to the citizens of that campus is the
opportunity to receive an education at
that campus, minority enrollment is man
datory.
