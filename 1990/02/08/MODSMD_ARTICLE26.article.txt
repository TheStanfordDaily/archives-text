## Irreplaceable Henning makes the court go 'round Junior guard doesn't put up the points or get recognition, but is the silent leader of the Cardinal backcourt 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Once upon a time, before the
Stanford women's basketball team
was receiving national recogni
tion, hardly anyone would have
believed they might play for an
NCAA Championship this year.
The team worked hard but sim
ply could not compete against
more talented squads To turn
things around would take time,
patience and an infusion of talent.
Perhaps even a little bit of
magic. Not the supernatural kind,
just the superhuman kind. You
know. Magic. As in Johnson. At
the beginning of the 1987-88
season, Stanford found its version
of the Los Angeles Laker wizard
in the form of 5-foot-8 point guard
Sonja Henning.
On a team filled with super
stars, Henning often receives little
recognition. She is not the one
who lights up the scoreboard for
30 points a night. As a result,
Henning does not receive nearly
as much attention as her back
court mate, Jennifer Azzi, for ex
ample.
It has little effect on Henning,
though. Instead of pouting, she
goes about the job of quarterback
ing the offense. Henning is not
the shot maker; she is the one
who sees to it others make shots.
"We have so many people who
score well," she says."It doesn't
matter who scores as long as we're
scoring. As long as we're winning
games, that's my primary goal —
not only as a point guard but as
a player."
Says Coach Tara VanDerveer:
"Sonja and Jennifer really set the
tone for our team. It helps when
you play with two really unselfish
guards. Sonja just wants to win.
Jennifer just wants to win.
"Sonja would just as soon pass
the ball inside, get an assist and
have us score, as she would score
herself. In her mind, our team
doing well seems to be her num
ber one priority."
Henning agrees. She feels her
contribution to the team's success
is far more important than self
aggrandizement. "I don't play for
publicity or for media attention
on myself, per se," Henning says.

"I'm excited when the team does
well and the media starts covering
us more. As long as we're win
ning, I'm happy."
"Sonja is so secure of herself,
she doesn't need lavish praise

from the newspapers," VanDer
veer says. "She knows what she
does for our team. Sophisticated
observers do, too. "There's a long
line in Sonja Henning's fan club.
It's hard to get to the front of

'It doesn't matter who scores as long as we're
scoring. As long as we're winning games,
that's my primary goal — not only as a point
guard but as a player.'
— Sonja Henning

the line," VanDerveer adds.
So it's not as if she has toiled
in complete obscurity at Stanford.
As a matter of fact, Henning was
named the team's most valuable
player her freshman year. Last
season, she shared MVP honors
with Azzi and was selected to the
All-Pacific 10 Conference team.
This year, Henning is probably
even better, but there is some
doubt as to whether she'll be
named All-Pac-10. Her scoring
average is down from just more
than 10 points to less than seven.
Yet, while Henning's game is hard
to measure in statistics there is
one number — her 7.1 assists per
game — that might begin to ap
proximate her worth.
It is one of the top totals in
the country and should attract the
attention of those who select the
conference's elite players. What
ever happens, though, Henning
will take it in stride.
VanDerveer thinks it would be
interesting if Henning was left off
the All-Pac-10 team because other
coaches failed to recognize her
contribution to the Cardinal. "If
they don't realize [how important
Sonja is], that shows why it's so
easy to beat them," she says.
"It shows they don't know what
makes our team go," VanDerveer
adds. "If Sonja is not the best
point guard in the Pac-10, who
is?" She says Stanford's other
guards — Azzi, Molly Gooden
bour, Stacy Parson and Angela
Taylor — would be the first to
agree.
"Ask Molly. Ask Jennifer. Ask
Stacy. Ask Angela. They don't
want to play against her. Ask
people who they want to play with.
They say Sonja. There's no doubt
in my mind she's the best," Van-
Derveer says.
What makes Henning so good
is that she has immense talent

and the sense to play within her
self. "There are lots of things I
can't do. I can't dunk or any
thing," she says, joking. "I try to
concentrate on the things I can
do well."
Those things are numerous,
VanDerveer notes. But if she had
a criticism of Henning, it would
be that she's "too conservative. It
wouldn't bother me if sometimes
she tried to make a little more
happen. She goes for the high per
centage play. She's not erratic at
all, never out of control."
VanDerveer realizes the
criticism is a compliment. "When
we're ahead or it's close, I like
the fact she's conservative and
makes the quality play," she adds,
laughing. Another of Henning's
strengths is her thorough knowl
edge of the game.
When Henning was a freshman,
she once stopped a practice to say
she thought someone was playing
out of position and needed a sub
stitute, VanDerveer recalls. Van-
Derveer told them to play on, but

Henning was insistent. Quickly,
the coach saw her point guard
was right.
Henning understates the inci
dent. "It wasn't a big deal," she
says. "To run the offense you have
to know what everyone else is
supposed to be doing. It was ob
vious to me someone was out of
position. I thought it was obvious
to everybody."
What is not obvious to some is
what Henning means to the Car
dinal, on and off the court. "When
we had the earthquake," VanDer
veer says,"I called Sonja to find
out how things were. She said,
'Tara, I talked to everyone, every
one is OK.' "
Of her play, VanDerveer says,
"I'm trying to think of a point
guard in the country who's better.
Who has anyone who runs their
offense better? Or sets people up?
Or handles the pressure?
"Without a good point guard
you ain't going nowhere. Forget
it, you're a .500 team. We were
a .500 team before Sonja got
here," she adds.
Says Azzi: "Without Sonja in
there it can get a little hectic."
"It cracks me up that to other
coaches she's just really an after
thought," VanDerveer says. "I'm
not going to give them secrets to
what makes us tick, but ..." The
coach knows it's her point guard
that provides a little touch of
magic.

Says Coach Tara VanDerveer:
"Sonja and Jennifer really set the
tone for our team. It helps when
you play with two really unselfish
guards. Sonja just wants to win.
Jennifer just wants to win.
"Sonja would just as soon pass
the ball inside, get an assist and
have us score, as she would score
herself. In her mind, our team
doing well seems to be her num
ber one priority."
Henning agrees. She feels her
contribution to the team's success
is far more important than self
aggrandizement. "I don't play for
publicity or for media attention
on myself, per se," Henning says.

"I'm excited when the team does
well and the media starts covering
us more. As long as we're win
ning, I'm happy."
"Sonja is so secure of herself,
she doesn't need lavish praise

from the newspapers," VanDer
veer says. "She knows what she
does for our team. Sophisticated
observers do, too. "There's a long
line in Sonja Henning's fan club.
It's hard to get to the front of

'It doesn't matter who scores as long as we're
scoring. As long as we're winning games,
that's my primary goal — not only as a point
guard but as a player.'
— Sonja Henning

the line," VanDerveer adds.
So it's not as if she has toiled
in complete obscurity at Stanford.
As a matter of fact, Henning was
named the team's most valuable
player her freshman year. Last
season, she shared MVP honors
with Azzi and was selected to the
All-Pacific 10 Conference team.
This year, Henning is probably
even better, but there is some
doubt as to whether she'll be
named All-Pac-10. Her scoring
average is down from just more
than 10 points to less than seven.
Yet, while Henning's game is hard
to measure in statistics there is
one number — her 7.1 assists per
game — that might begin to ap
proximate her worth.
It is one of the top totals in
the country and should attract the
attention of those who select the
conference's elite players. What
ever happens, though, Henning
will take it in stride.
VanDerveer thinks it would be
interesting if Henning was left off
the All-Pac-10 team because other
coaches failed to recognize her
contribution to the Cardinal. "If
they don't realize [how important
Sonja is], that shows why it's so
easy to beat them," she says.
"It shows they don't know what
makes our team go," VanDerveer
adds. "If Sonja is not the best
point guard in the Pac-10, who
is?" She says Stanford's other
guards — Azzi, Molly Gooden
bour, Stacy Parson and Angela
Taylor — would be the first to
agree.
"Ask Molly. Ask Jennifer. Ask
Stacy. Ask Angela. They don't
want to play against her. Ask
people who they want to play with.
They say Sonja. There's no doubt
in my mind she's the best," Van-
Derveer says.
What makes Henning so good
is that she has immense talent

and the sense to play within her
self. "There are lots of things I
can't do. I can't dunk or any
thing," she says, joking. "I try to
concentrate on the things I can
do well."
Those things are numerous,
VanDerveer notes. But if she had
a criticism of Henning, it would
be that she's "too conservative. It
wouldn't bother me if sometimes
she tried to make a little more
happen. She goes for the high per
centage play. She's not erratic at
all, never out of control."
VanDerveer realizes the
criticism is a compliment. "When
we're ahead or it's close, I like
the fact she's conservative and
makes the quality play," she adds,
laughing. Another of Henning's
strengths is her thorough knowl
edge of the game.
When Henning was a freshman,
she once stopped a practice to say
she thought someone was playing
out of position and needed a sub
stitute, VanDerveer recalls. Van-
Derveer told them to play on, but

Henning was insistent. Quickly,
the coach saw her point guard
was right.
Henning understates the inci
dent. "It wasn't a big deal," she
says. "To run the offense you have
to know what everyone else is
supposed to be doing. It was ob
vious to me someone was out of
position. I thought it was obvious
to everybody."
What is not obvious to some is
what Henning means to the Car
dinal, on and off the court. "When
we had the earthquake," VanDer
veer says,"I called Sonja to find
out how things were. She said,
'Tara, I talked to everyone, every
one is OK.' "
Of her play, VanDerveer says,
"I'm trying to think of a point
guard in the country who's better.
Who has anyone who runs their
offense better? Or sets people up?
Or handles the pressure?
"Without a good point guard
you ain't going nowhere. Forget
it, you're a .500 team. We were
a .500 team before Sonja got
here," she adds.
Says Azzi: "Without Sonja in
there it can get a little hectic."
"It cracks me up that to other
coaches she's just really an after
thought," VanDerveer says. "I'm
not going to give them secrets to
what makes us tick, but ..." The
coach knows it's her point guard
that provides a little touch of
magic.

All-Pac-10 guard Sonja Henning may not get the recognition, but
her teammates know she'll cut through the D and set them up for
the score. Henning and the Cardinal are looking to bust through
for their 20th straight victory tonight at Washington State.
Once upon a time, before the
Stanford women's basketball team
was receiving national recogni
tion, hardly anyone would have
believed they might play for an
NCAA Championship this year.
The team worked hard but sim
ply could not compete against
more talented squads To turn
things around would take time,
patience and an infusion of talent.
Perhaps even a little bit of
magic. Not the supernatural kind,
just the superhuman kind. You
know. Magic. As in Johnson. At
the beginning of the 1987-88
season, Stanford found its version
of the Los Angeles Laker wizard
in the form of 5-foot-8 point guard
Sonja Henning.
On a team filled with super
stars, Henning often receives little
recognition. She is not the one
who lights up the scoreboard for
30 points a night. As a result,
Henning does not receive nearly
as much attention as her back
court mate, Jennifer Azzi, for ex
ample.
It has little effect on Henning,
though. Instead of pouting, she
goes about the job of quarterback
ing the offense. Henning is not
the shot maker; she is the one
who sees to it others make shots.
"We have so many people who
score well," she says."It doesn't
matter who scores as long as we're
scoring. As long as we're winning
games, that's my primary goal —
not only as a point guard but as
a player."
Says Coach Tara VanDerveer:
"Sonja and Jennifer really set the
