# Rebounding the key to bouncing back against WSU
## Men's basketball sets its sights on snapping four-game losing streak as struggling Cougars visit Maples tonight 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Going into tonight's game against
Washington State, the Cardinal basket
ball team is in desperate need of
rebounding.
No, not that kind. Stanford is pulling
down 8.9 more boards per game than
its opponents, good enough to lead the
Pacific 10 Conference.
After suffering four straight losses
on the road, however, the Cardinal
realizes it needs to bounce back tonight
with a home win over the Cougars.
"I think it's really vital that we re
establish ourselves, get a couple of wins,
get our confidence back," forward
Andrew Vlahov said. "I think it's a turn
ing point. How we go this weekend will
decide whether we have a shot at post
season."
After an impressive 8-0 start, Stan
ford is currently 12-7 overall, 4-6 in
Pac-10 games. But facing last-place
Washington State tonight and eighth
place Washington Sunday afternoon
here, the Cardinal has a chance to get
back on a roll.
Two weeks ago Stanford faced getting
blown out at Arizona. But down 20
points in the first half, the Cardinal
mounted a comeback that brought the
team back to within one point before
falling. Bouyed by the optimism of

having outplayed the Wildcats in the
second half, the Cardinal headed to Ar
izona State looking for the team's second
Pac-10 road victory.
Instead Stanford came out flat, had
problems with a halfcourt trap and lost.
Last weekend, a second-half turnover
spurt and bad free throw shooting cost
the Cardinal a win at Oregon while 14
first half turnovers took the team out
of a game at Oregon State.
"I think we've been kind of unlucky,"
Vlahov said. "Three of the four games
â€” we've been in all of them down the
stretch but we haven't been able to make
the plays."
Stanford will finally get a chance to
make those plays in Maples Pavilion
after being on the road for two weeks.
The Cardinal is shooting .511 in Maples
this year but only .472 on the road.
Stanford has also won 21 of 22 games
at home over the past two years.
The team will additionally have the
advantage of facing a Washington State
team that is struggling in 1990. After
losing their last game in December the
Cougars have started the new year with
seven more losses in a row.
A big reason is the team's lack of
quality frontcourt players. Neil Evans
is the squad's rebounding leader with
a meager 4.9 per game. He is the only
WSU player averaging more than four
per game. The Cougars are also being

outrebounded by an average of 7.9
boards per game in Pac-10 play, good
for the cellar.
When the two teams met earlier this
year the Cardinal had a season-high 51
rebounds while Washington State had
only 36. Stanford could use a similar
edge tonight to avoid going down to the
wire.
Part of the reason Washington State
has had rebounding problems is that
the Cougars have been using a three
guard lineup. Leading the way has been
senior Darryl Woods. Woods launched
25 shots against Stanford earlier this
year, hitting only six, for a team-high
17 points. For the season he is averaging
16 points a game.
The other double-figure scorer is
guard Bennie Seltzer, who Stanford
hasn't seen yet. The freshman had to
leave town due to a family emergency
and missed the teams' earlier contest.
Seltzer has already scored 20 points or
more four times this year and is averag
ing 12.8 a game. He hit a three-pointer
as time expired to send the Cougars
into overtime against Washington two
weeks ago and leads the team with 44
treys.
The third guard is senior David
Sanders, who Stanford fans will never
forget. He had 32 points against the
Cardinal two years ago to give the
Cougars a 70-68 overtime win at
Maples. He made 7-of-ll three-pointers,
including the game-winner with 10
seconds remaining in the extra period.
But fame has been fleeting for
Sanders, who has scored in double fig
ures only twice this year. While he and
Seltzer are neck-and-neck for the team
lead in both assists and steals, Sanders
is averaging only 4.2 points a game.
The frontcourt contains Evans and
Brian Paine. Despite being 6-foot-10,
Paine is averaging only 3 9 rebounds a
game and is shooting well below 40
percent from the field.
None of the Cougar forwards showed
the ability to defend Cardinal forward
Adam Keefe in the teams' earlier meet
ing as the sophomore scored 30 points
and hauled in a career-high 15
rebounds. Stanford will likely look to
Keefe again tonight as often as possible.
Card notes
Only one plnver, UCLA's Trevor Wilson,
has reached double figures in rebounds
against the Cardinal. For Stanford Keefe
has reached double figures in rebounding
10 times in 19 games and Deshon Wingate
has done it three times.

Tho Cardinal hopes that Andrew Vlahov and his hardwood mates can bring down
the boards and put up enough points to snap its losing streak at Maples tonight.
