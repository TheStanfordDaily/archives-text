# Men's Basketball vs. Washington State
## 
### 
TONIGHT - Live on PSN television, KZSU (90.1 FM) and KCBS (740 AM) with a 7:30
p.m. tipoff in Maples Pavilion.
RECORDS — Stanford (12-7, 4-6 in Pac-10 play, Washington State (7-14, 1-10).
SERIES — The Cougars lead the overall series 44-37 but Stanford has won four straight
against Washington State. In Pullman earlier this year Adam Keefe had 30 points and
a career-high 15 rebounds to lead the Cardinal to a 69-49 win Deshon Wingate had
16 points and a career-high 11 boards in that game
COUGAR UPDATE — Guard Darryl Woods has been the main man for WSU this year
He is averaging 15 points a game and had 17 against the Cardinal earlier this year
as the only Cougar in double figures. He did it by taking 25 shots, however, making
only six. Freshman guard Bennie Seltzer missed the Stanford game due to a family
emergency. He will start tonight in a three-gaurd lineup and is second on the team
in scoring at 12.8 per game.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Back-to-back road trips, and back-to-back-to-back-to-back losses
on said trips, have left the Cardinal with a 4-6 league mark With two home games
(finally) this weekend, against two of the Pac-10's lesser teams, Stanford has a chance
to get back to 500. Susceptibility to the press, an old nemesis, has come back to
haunt the team the past two weeks as second-half turnovers were instrumental in
losses at both Arizona State and Oregon State.
KEYS TO VICTORY — A month ago Stanford proved it was clearly a better team than
Washington State, winning by 20 points despite a lot of missed free throws and overall
off play. The Cougars will try to gun from the outside, and if the Cardinal does the
same good job of getting a hand in the face of shooters, most of the WSU bombs
will come up duds. Stanford should be able to dominate inside, and if the team shows
the intensity it had at times earlier in the season, the Cardinal should find itself back
on the winning track STAT OF THE WEEK: Stanford is 11-0 when committing fewer
fouls than its opponent.
