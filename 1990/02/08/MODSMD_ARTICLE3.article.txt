# University facing more budget woes
## Provost to announce shortfall 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
Already deep in financial trou
ble, the University is preparing
to face more serious budget prob
lems that will likely be felt
University-wide next year.
Provost James Rosse will reveal
just how serious the problems are
in an address to the Faculty Sen
ate this afternoon. Among other

things, Rosse will
announce a
projected deficit
for the 1990-91
operating budget.
Last year the
University tallied
up a $2 million
operating budget
deficit, its first
unbalanced

budget in 13 years. The prospects
look even gloomier this year,
budget officials said.
"Next year and beyond, we've
got some serious problems," said
Tim Warner, director of Univer
sity budgets. "Looking down the
road, it doesn't get a whole lot
better."
University officials have
promised the Board of Trustees
they will bring in a balanced
budget this spring. But last winter
officials forecast a $7.3 million
shortfall for 1990-91, and the ac
tual deficit may be even larger.
That means significant cuts —
some of which will begin this year,
Warner said.
And earthquake repair costs,
now estimated at $140 million,
may throw a wrench into the
whole process if state and federal
aid packages don't come through.
Rosse will present his prelimi
nary budget report to the trustees
next week. Tuition and room and
board rates for next year will be
set at that time. The percentage

increases for both are expected to
be less than this year's, Warner
said.
The final budget guidelines for
next year will be submitted to the
trustees for approval in April.
The impending budget deficit is
the result of, among other things,
lower-than-projected research
volume, lower-than-projected in
direct cost recovery and a struc
tural imbalance in the budget
known to planners as the "2 per
cent problem."
"The double-digit growth we've
seen in research is not expected
to continue," said Dana Shelley,
a University budget planner. "The
budgets for research just aren't
growing, and the federal govern
ment doesn't have as much money
to allocate" because of its own
deficit.
Research volume is important
because of its effect on indirect
costs, the overhead the University
charges agencies funding research
to pay for administrative and sup
port costs. Recovery of indirect
costs is second only to tuition as
a source of income to the Univer
sity; its contribution to this year's
$384 million operating budget
was expected to be about $115
million.
When research volume and in
direct cost recovery fell short of
estimates last year, a $3 million
gap between projected income and
expenditures was created. That
amount was added to an $11 mil
lion gap that resulted from a
shortfall in gifts, increased staff
benefit costs, a deficit in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and several other things.
The total $14 million gap was
eventually pared to $2 million.
The "2 percent problem" refers
to a perennial gap at the start of


Rosse
the budget process equal to about
2 percent of the previous year's
budget. The 2 percent is allowed
for program development and
growth; it would be eliminated if
budget planners did not allow for
program improvements.
"In the past, we've assumed
that each year we could find ways
to close the gap," Shelley said.
"We could do the tweaking nec
essary to balance the budget.
That's getting harder and harder
to do."
The options for solving the 2
percent problem are narrowing
because actions such as large tui
tion increases and reductions in
salary rate growth are becoming
increasingly infeasible for the
University, budget officials said.
That leaves the University with
a budget deficit even before plan
ning has begun — and when in
come shortfalls and expenditure
increases are added in, the 2 per
cent problem becomes a 4 or 5
percent problem, as was the case
last year.
Solving the 2 percent problem
is a long-term dilemma that
budget planners are now address
ing. Of more immediate concern
will be how to reduce to zero, by
April, the budget gap to be an
nounced tomorrow.

Last year the gap was cut by
$12 million through several meas
ures, including an 8 percent tui
tion increase and a reduction in
staff salary increases.
Rosse and his advisers will work
out the necessary adjustments
over the next two months. But in
the long run, reducing budget
deficits will require a change in
attitude about growth in the Uni
versity — a change that is already
taking place.
"Stanford has always believed
that you do the right thing, what
ever the cost," said Joy Mundy,
a financial analyst for the Uni
versity. "This is a step backward;
now we're saying you have to con
sider costs, too. It's a radical
change for Stanford."
Financial manager Scott Leon
hard agreed. "Rather than looking
for new additional things to do,
we're looking more at consolidat
ing, streamlining and increasing
efficiency. In administrative and
support areas, we're looking at
not being state-of-the-art, but
mainstream," Leonhard said.
Damage repairs for the Oct. 17
earthquake are also unsettling for
budget planners. University offi
cials are now estimating that state
and federal aid, combined with
University fundraising, may cover
40 to 55 percent of the repair bill.
The rest will come from Univer
sity reserves and a long-term debt
from the operating budget.
