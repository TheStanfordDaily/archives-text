# University facing more budget woes
## Provost to announce shortfall 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
Already deep in financial trou
ble, the University is preparing
to face more serious budget prob
lems that will likely be felt
University-wide next year.
Provost James Rosse will reveal
just how serious the problems are
in an address to the Faculty Sen
ate this afternoon. Among other

things, Rosse will
announce a
projected deficit
for the 1990-91
operating budget.
Last year the
University tallied
up a $2 million
operating budget
deficit, its first
unbalanced

budget in 13 years. The prospects
look even gloomier this year,
budget officials said.
"Next year and beyond, we've
got some serious problems," said
Tim Warner, director of Univer
sity budgets. "Looking down the
road, it doesn't get a whole lot
better."
University officials have
promised the Board of Trustees
they will bring in a balanced
budget this spring. But last winter
officials forecast a $7.3 million
shortfall for 1990-91, and the ac
tual deficit may be even larger.
That means significant cuts â€”
some of which will begin this year,
Warner said.
And earthquake repair costs,
now estimated at $140 million,
may throw a wrench into the
whole process if state and federal
aid packages don't come through.
Rosse will present his prelimi
nary budget report to the trustees
next week. Tuition and room and
board rates for next year will be
set at that time. The percentage

increases for both are expected to
be less than this year's, Warner
said.
The final budget guidelines for
next year will be submitted to the
trustees for approval in April.
The impending budget deficit is
the result of, among other things,
lower-than-projected research
volume, lower-than-projected in
direct cost recovery and a struc
tural imbalance in the budget
known to planners as the "2 per
cent problem."
"The double-digit growth we've
seen in research is not expected
to continue," said Dana Shelley,
a University budget planner. "The
budgets for research just aren't
growing, and the federal govern
ment doesn't have as much money
to allocate" because of its own
deficit.
Research volume is important
because of its effect on indirect
costs, the overhead the University
charges agencies funding research
to pay for administrative and sup
port costs. Recovery of indirect
costs is second only to tuition as
a source of income to the Univer
sity; its contribution to this year's
$384 million operating budget
was expected to be about $115
million.
When research volume and in
direct cost recovery fell short of
estimates last year, a $3 million
gap between projected income and
expenditures was created. That
amount was added to an $11 mil
lion gap that resulted from a
shortfall in gifts, increased staff
benefit costs, a deficit in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and several other things.
The total $14 million gap was
eventually pared to $2 million.
The "2 percent problem" refers
to a perennial gap at the start of
