## Cardinal netters take a swing at professional competition in tourney 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Stanford tennis, as usual, is
invading the upper echelon of
college tennis as well as the pro
fessional circuit.
In the Volvo of San Fransisco
tennis tournament held at the
Civic Center this past week, two
Stanford freshmen, Johnathan
Stark and Alexis Hombrecher,
fell in first-round three-set

matches. Jared Palmer, another
frosh phenom, was invited to the
tourney but had to decline be
cause of a knee iryury.
Stark, Stanford's No. 1 player,
lost to former Cardinal Dan
Goldie, a NCAA champion and
a Wimbeldon quarterfinalist, 7-
6, 3-6, 7-6.
"It was a good match, but I
didn't serve as well as I could
have," Stark said. "I had a few
break points which I didn't con

vert. ... I had my opportuni
ties."
Stark actually was leading 2-1
in the third set. "I was up 2-1
with two break points," Stark
said. "Then I started to miss
some first serves, and things
kind of fell apart."
Hombrecher told a similar
story, losing to tournament
qualifer Chris Garner 7-6, 3-6,
6-3.
"I felt I could have beat him,"

'I had a few break
points which I didn't
convert... I had my
opportunities. 1

Hombrecher said. "In the third
set, he broke me once. [In that
game] I missed a couple of easy
volleys and double faulted. [That
break of serve] was the match."
Stanford Coach Dick Gould
wanted to credit tournament di
rector Barry MacKay for the
"unprecedented" act of allowing
three Stanford freshmen into the
professional tournament.
In other tennis news, Stan
ford's No. 2 player, Alex O'Brien,
will compete in the Rolex Na
tional Indoor Intercollegiate
Championships in Minnesota
today.
O'Brien, who currently is
ranked No. 23 by the Volvo Col
legiate Tennis Rankings, meets
No. 11-ranked John Falbo of
Kansas.
"Alex can win the tourna
ment," Asst. Coach John Whit
linger said. "He's playing that
well. There's absolutely no one
in the field he can't beat."
That's no small compliment
considering most of the nation's
top players are attending the
tournament, including No. 1-
ranked A 1 Parker of Georgia, No.
2-ranked Jose-Luis Noriega of
San Diego, No. 3-ranked Steve
Bryan of Texas, No. 4-ranked
Todd Martin of Northwestern
and defending NCAA champion
Donni Leaycraft of LSU.
"[Alex] has always been a
great baseline player, but he has
started to get into net more and
finish the points off. If he can
continue to do that and return
and pass well, he has a definite
shot at winning it," Whitlinger
added.
