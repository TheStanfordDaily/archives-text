### Mark Davies Staff writer 
Riding the momentum of its un
defeated league play, the Stanford
rugby team walked all over San
Jose State last Saturday, shutting
the Spartans out 35-0 to bring its
league record to 4-0. In a similar
manner, Stanford's second team
won its match 34-0.

"Although we clearly dominated
our opposition and played with
intensity, I don't want the team
to become overconfident — we
need to stay with the fundamen
tals," Coach Franck Boivert said.
"In a league filled with

opposition and played with intensity, I

fident — we need to stay with the fun
damentals.'

national-caliber teams, as ours is,
it takes strong, emotional play
built on a solid foundation of basic
skills to attain long range goals,"
he continued. "I believe this is
the direction in which we are
heading."
In spite of Boivert's cautious
optimism, the Stanford ruggers,
scoring seven tries on Saturday,
would be hard-pressed to improve
upon their performance.
The Cardinal attacked from all
sides, as J. C. Schmeil scored

three tries, Simon Fleming-Wood
tallied two, and Brian Bell and
Glenn Flores each added a score
of their own.
But it was intense teamwork
that resulted in the blowout, and
individuals refused to take credit
for the victory. When asked to
comment on his performance, J.
C. Schmeil replied, "It's hard to
take full credit for them myself
— the forwards did most of the
work. After all, rugby is a game
of teamwork."

The Cardinal's play was affected
by the weather, as the strong wind
forced the squad to alter strate
gies at halftime. By the results of
the contest, however, the switch
did not seem to hamper Stanford's
play.
Team captain Joe Croft com
mented on the Cardinal's game
plan. "We played a conservative
ground game the first half with
the wind in our face. However, in
the second half, with the wind at
our back, we exploited this advan
tage and we picked their defense
apart like a bad argument."
After four weeks of play the
Stanford ruggers have scored 14
tries against their opponents,
while only giving up four tries in
the process.
The Cardinal will attempt to
continue its winning streak this
Saturday at home against
Sacramento State in the soccer
stadium at 11 a.m.
