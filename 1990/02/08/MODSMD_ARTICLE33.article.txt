San Diego State hosted the first
two regattas of the South Series,
with 11 schools in 31 boats com

Sailing team will be competing in
the North Series to qualify for
the Pacific Coast Championships,

sailors to southern California to

tion, with two first place varsity
finishes. Stanford's Robert Brown
and Suzannah Mapes had rough
sailing on Saturday but placed
first in their division on Sunday.
Counterparts Matt Sanford and
Deborah Claymon sailed to second
place in their division on Saturday
but were deep on Sunday, giving
the varsity boat fourth overall on
Saturday and "a much improved
third place" thecfollowing day,"
according to Coach Blake Mid
dleton.
With light to moderate winds,
co-skippers A 1 Sargent and Peter
Somers had some difficulties at
330 pounds in the second varsity
boat, well over 50 pounds heavier
than most teams.
Sargent and Somer's boat was

balanced by Haley King and
Marina Kimball, whose sixth place
performance on Saturday high
lighted the weekend as they beat
Irvine's Rosalind Mead, the na
tion's top recruit last year.
Stanford's junior varsity also
fared well as John Emory and
Jon Schreiber teamed up with
Rusty Lhamon and Stacey
Misakian to dominate their divi
sion both days with first place
overall finishes.
"It was a much improved team
performance considering we
hadn't practiced in several
weeks," said Middleton.
The team will compete in its
first North Series Feb. 17 at
Santa Cruz.
