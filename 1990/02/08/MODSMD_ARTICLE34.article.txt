# Arbitration's the name of the game in the '90s
## 
### 
If your idea of The Perfect
Career is a job that doesn't
take up a lot of time, doesn't
take a lot of effort, pays really
well, involves little to no brain
activity and, of course, performs
a valuable service, I've got just
the thing for you.
Be an arbitrator. Not just a
labor negotiator or anything
meaningless like that — be a base
ball arbitrator. Major league base
ball has provided the perfect low
stress, high-paying, non-thinking
job. It's time to get in on the
ground floor.
For those of you unfamiliar
with arbitration as it applies to
the make-believe world of base
ball, the process goes more or less
like this:

At the end of a season, an
average player — let's call him
Joe Shlabotnik — asks his general
manager for more money. It
doesn't matter that Joe hit .216
with no homers and 23 runs
batted in for that year; all that
matters is that he's a year older,
inflation is going wild and he just
can't get by on his meager
$535,000 salary. (Is that what
Giants second baseman Robby
Thompson made last year? Boy,
what a coincidence.)
Anyway, Joe asks the GM for
a reasonable amount — say, 1.35
million clams per year. The GM
laughs in his face and offers
$800,000. Joe gets insulted (can
you blame him?) and storms out
of the room.
Here's where the arbitrator
comes in. If Joe has been in the
majors at least three years and
can't come to terms with his club
by the middle of January, by
mayor league rules he must file
for arbitration and submit his
ridiculously high salary request.
In turn, his club must submit its
ridiculously low offer.
Then the two sides spend a cou
ple of weeks glaring at each other
and sending hate mail until an
ostensibly neutral party — ye olde
arbitrator — decides which side
is being more ridiculous.
How does he do this? Simple:
He listens to both sides gripe, I
mean, present their arguments, he
weighs the evidence, looks at the
latest market figures, calculates
the opportunity costs — and then
goes into a back room to flip a
coin.
Heads and the player wins, tails
(for obvious reasons) and the club
wins. The arbitrator has to pick
one salary figure or the other,
nothing in between. Either way,
the arbitrator gets paid.
I think I've found my life's
work.
Now, some arbitrators may
say there's more to the
process than letting a toss
of a silver dollar decide the an
swer. I wonder if Bo Jackson
would agree.
80, the I-can-do-absolutely
everything-well outfielder/ run
ning back, wasn't happy with his
1989 baseball salary, which was
$610,000. That made him the
eleventh-highest paid player on
the Kansas City Royals, and for
someone who led the team in both
home runs (32) and RBI (105),
that's not exactly beaucoup bucks.
So, like any other unhappy
camper, he asked for a raise. A
$1.3 million raise.

That may sound absurd, but in
today's baseball market that's not
a crazy figure — which is scary.
Anyway, the Royals — they of the
"We're gonna spend $20 million
dollars on pitching and still finish
second" philosophy — politely told
Bo there wasn't a chance in you
know-where of him getting that
kind of money from them. They
offered a measly one million for
one year, thus creating the largest
gap in arbitration history.
The call from the coin, oops,
arbitrator, was in the Royals' fa
vor. Bo got the one mil, no more.
Hey, now he's the 10th highest
paid player on the tean.. What's
annoying is the straight face the
Royals tried to put on after it was
over.
"Based on historical signings
and current salary comparisons,
it was our belief that our number
was fair and one that was respon
sive to the marketplace," Royal
GM John Schuerholz said. Right.
This is the man who, after spend
ing $19 million to sign pitdhers
Storm Davis and Mark Davis, said
"We had the money and we spent
it." Apparently by the time Bo
asked for his, the Royals had no
more money.
Or maybe they were just
being asinine. As for a
"current salary compari
son," let's take a look at Joe
Carter, who just signed with the
San Diego Padres.
Both Joe and Bo are outfielders.
Let's see how they did in 1989
(the only figures I could find for
Carter were with nine games left
in the season, so his average may
be off a little and you can add
one or two to the other
categories).
Batting— Bo .256, Joe .245.
Home runs— Joe 35, Bo 32.
RBI- Bo 105, Joe 103.
Steals— Bo 26, Joe 13.
Slugging— Bo .496, Joe .474.
On-base pet.— Bo .307, Joe .294.
Bo struck out a major-league
leading 172 times and still got on
base more often than Carter.
The final stat, the one that's
really telling, is games played.
Carter compiled his 35 homers in
153 games. Bo got 32 in 127. Hm.
You add it all up, and whadda
you get?
1990 salary— Joe $3,067,000 (yes,
that's three million), Bo
$1,000,000.
Am I missing something?
The problem, of course, is
not that Bo doesn't make
a lot of money. I'm not
about to cry for a man who makes
more in one year than I'll make
in the next 30.
There are, as usual, several
ways of looking at this. One is
that Bo is getting cheated out of
a lot of money that other players
— ones with comparable stats —
are raking in. Another is that the
arbitrator in this case is a rock
of logic in a sea of insanity. With
spending going out of control,
someone has to say enough is
enough. But is it?
With CBS throwing money
around like it's yesterday's Daily,
teams are now willing to fork over
money to their players.
The question is whether adver
tisers are going to pay the unbe
lievably high charges for airtime
during CBS games. If not, the
next TV contract will be con
siderably less pricey, teams will
have less money. . . and player
salaries will go back down. Or
ticket prices will go waaaaaay up.
What happens when the money
stops?

Cameron Macky will make ap
proximately $535,000 this year
covering the baseball team, but
he'll be taking The Daily to arbi
tration in the off-season.

Heads and the player wins, tails
(for obvious reasons) and the club
wins. The arbitrator has to pick
one salary figure or the other,
nothing in between. Either way,
the arbitrator gets paid.
I think I've found my life's
work.
Now, some arbitrators may
say there's more to the
process than letting a toss
of a silver dollar decide the an
swer. I wonder if Bo Jackson
would agree.
80, the I-can-do-absolutely
everything-well outfielder/ run
ning back, wasn't happy with his
1989 baseball salary, which was
$610,000. That made him the
eleventh-highest paid player on
the Kansas City Royals, and for
someone who led the team in both
home runs (32) and RBI (105),
that's not exactly beaucoup bucks.
So, like any other unhappy
camper, he asked for a raise. A
$1.3 million raise.

That may sound absurd, but in
today's baseball market that's not
a crazy figure — which is scary.
Anyway, the Royals — they of the
"We're gonna spend $20 million
dollars on pitching and still finish
second" philosophy — politely told
Bo there wasn't a chance in you
know-where of him getting that
kind of money from them. They
offered a measly one million for
one year, thus creating the largest
gap in arbitration history.
The call from the coin, oops,
arbitrator, was in the Royals' fa
vor. Bo got the one mil, no more.
Hey, now he's the 10th highest
paid player on the tean.. What's
annoying is the straight face the
Royals tried to put on after it was
over.
"Based on historical signings
and current salary comparisons,
it was our belief that our number
was fair and one that was respon
sive to the marketplace," Royal
GM John Schuerholz said. Right.
This is the man who, after spend
ing $19 million to sign pitdhers
Storm Davis and Mark Davis, said
"We had the money and we spent
it." Apparently by the time Bo
asked for his, the Royals had no
more money.
Or maybe they were just
being asinine. As for a
"current salary compari
son," let's take a look at Joe
Carter, who just signed with the
San Diego Padres.
Both Joe and Bo are outfielders.
Let's see how they did in 1989
(the only figures I could find for
Carter were with nine games left
in the season, so his average may
be off a little and you can add
one or two to the other
categories).
Batting— Bo .256, Joe .245.
Home runs— Joe 35, Bo 32.
RBI- Bo 105, Joe 103.
Steals— Bo 26, Joe 13.
Slugging— Bo .496, Joe .474.
On-base pet.— Bo .307, Joe .294.
Bo struck out a major-league
leading 172 times and still got on
base more often than Carter.
The final stat, the one that's
really telling, is games played.
Carter compiled his 35 homers in
153 games. Bo got 32 in 127. Hm.
You add it all up, and whadda
you get?
1990 salary— Joe $3,067,000 (yes,
that's three million), Bo
$1,000,000.
Am I missing something?
The problem, of course, is
not that Bo doesn't make
a lot of money. I'm not
about to cry for a man who makes
more in one year than I'll make
in the next 30.
There are, as usual, several
ways of looking at this. One is
that Bo is getting cheated out of
a lot of money that other players
— ones with comparable stats —
are raking in. Another is that the
arbitrator in this case is a rock
of logic in a sea of insanity. With
spending going out of control,
someone has to say enough is
enough. But is it?
With CBS throwing money
around like it's yesterday's Daily,
teams are now willing to fork over
money to their players.
The question is whether adver
tisers are going to pay the unbe
lievably high charges for airtime
during CBS games. If not, the
next TV contract will be con
siderably less pricey, teams will
have less money. . . and player
salaries will go back down. Or
ticket prices will go waaaaaay up.
What happens when the money
stops?

Cameron Macky will make ap
proximately $535,000 this year
covering the baseball team, but
he'll be taking The Daily to arbi
tration in the off-season.

If your idea of The Perfect
Career is a job that doesn't
take up a lot of time, doesn't
take a lot of effort, pays really
well, involves little to no brain
activity and, of course, performs
a valuable service, I've got just
the thing for you.
Be an arbitrator. Not just a
labor negotiator or anything
meaningless like that — be a base
ball arbitrator. Major league base
ball has provided the perfect low
stress, high-paying, non-thinking
job. It's time to get in on the
ground floor.
For those of you unfamiliar
with arbitration as it applies to
the make-believe world of base
ball, the process goes more or less
like this:

At the end of a season, an
average player — let's call him
Joe Shlabotnik — asks his general
manager for more money. It
doesn't matter that Joe hit .216
with no homers and 23 runs
batted in for that year; all that
matters is that he's a year older,
inflation is going wild and he just
can't get by on his meager
$535,000 salary. (Is that what
Giants second baseman Robby
Thompson made last year? Boy,
what a coincidence.)
Anyway, Joe asks the GM for
a reasonable amount — say, 1.35
million clams per year. The GM
laughs in his face and offers
$800,000. Joe gets insulted (can
you blame him?) and storms out
of the room.
Here's where the arbitrator
comes in. If Joe has been in the
majors at least three years and
can't come to terms with his club
by the middle of January, by
mayor league rules he must file
for arbitration and submit his
ridiculously high salary request.
In turn, his club must submit its
ridiculously low offer.
Then the two sides spend a cou
ple of weeks glaring at each other
and sending hate mail until an
ostensibly neutral party — ye olde
arbitrator — decides which side
is being more ridiculous.
How does he do this? Simple:
He listens to both sides gripe, I
mean, present their arguments, he
weighs the evidence, looks at the
latest market figures, calculates
the opportunity costs — and then
goes into a back room to flip a
coin.
Heads and the player wins, tails
(for obvious reasons) and the club
wins. The arbitrator has to pick
one salary figure or the other,
nothing in between. Either way,
the arbitrator gets paid.
I think I've found my life's
work.
