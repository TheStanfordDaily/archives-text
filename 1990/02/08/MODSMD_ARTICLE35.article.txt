# Asbestos fears delay opening of modulars
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Within weeks of the Oct. 17
earthquake, displaced students
were given new homes by the
University. Some faculty, how
ever, still remain homeless.
Because of a possible as
bestos hazard and other delays,
faculty members and teaching
fellows will not be moving into
the prefabricated "quake
moduiars" in the Wilbur Hall
parking lot until March 1, said
Wayne Poulsen, an engineer
with Facilities Project Manage
ment.
University officials originally
anticipated the temporary com
plex would be ready for occu
pation at the beginning of the
quarter.
But in the process of disman
tling and moving the complex
from its original location in San
Jose to Stanford, construction
workers exposed asbestos
containing floor tiles at the
seams between individual
modulars.
Asbestos presents no health
hazards if contained, but if
present in the air can be dan
gerous because it is a
carcinogen.
The University intended to
cover the tiles with carpet to
prevent asbestos particles from
entering the atmosphere, a so

lution approved by Environ
mental Health and Safety,
according to Poulsen.
However, before roofs were
put on the 'B' building, the
tiles got soaked with rainwater
and became brittle and curled.
Construction workers stepped
on them, breaking the tiles into
pieces and possibly releasing
asbestos particles.
For the last two weeks, the
building has been closed off
while a cleanup crew from Op
erations and Maintenance
vacuumed and mopped
Yesterday, the crew took
samples to determine the level
of asbestos particles in the at
mosphere. The results of the
tests should be available today,
said Jeff Bramlett, head of the
asbestos program at Health
and Safety.
The fact that the samples
were taken does not mean that
the University suspects dan
gerous levels of asbestos,
Bramlett said. Federal law
requires such tests if material
with asbestos has been ex
posed.
According to analyses of the
tiles taken after the complex
was moved, one type contains
about 1 to 3 percent asbestos
and another about 3 to 5 per
cent — "pretty standard" pro
portions, according to
Bramlett.
