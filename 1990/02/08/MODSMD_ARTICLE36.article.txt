## Heart Search It's not just for the Tin Man 
### Lora Dawn Headrick Staff writer

You want a heart! You don't know
how lucky you are not to have one.
Hearts will never be practical until
they can be made unbreakable.
The Wizard wasn't lying. Two
weeks ago I sat in the middle of my
floor, surrounded by little shreds of
paper. My love letters, returned to
me in pieces, reflected the disarray of
my shattered heart.
Sound corny? My life is almost a
B-movie. Almost. In B-movies, love
conquers all. In my life, love falters
and fails.
So there 1 sit, like Alice in her sea
of self-piteous tears, having loved and
lost and not liking it at all. I look
around me, staring blankly at my
bleak life, when my eyes light on a
familiar image. On the wall, smiling
down upon me, is the patron saint of
my passion: the Tin Man.

My metallic friend is one of several
"Wizard of Oz" icons gracing my walls,
and he is my favorite. After all, what

are courage and honor and truth and
home, without heart, without love? The Tin
Man's quest endeared him to me above all

the other pilgrims in that timeless myth,
and I knew early in my life I should follow
in his clanking footsteps.

Yet here 1 sat, rusting in the junkyard of love.
Where did I go wrong? I'd asked myself that ques
tion a thousand times, and I already knew the
answer: my

fault. My stupid fault. If I could just get away from
my life for awhile, maybe go back in time or some
thing . . .

"I've gotta get out of this gloomy room," I said aloud
I grabbed my car keys, jumped up, and . . .
Damn! What happened to my headl I must have
bumped it on the desk drawer. I can't see anything.
A bright beam of light momentarily blinded my vi
sion. When my eyes finally focused, I found myself
looking at a strangely familiar face. Sunlight glinted off
his funnel hat, and his ticking testimonial dangled an
inch from my nose.

"Are you hurt?" he asked kindly.
"I don't think so," I said, rubbing my head. Then I
took a look around. I was lying on a yellow brick path
that ran through the middle of a wooded clearing.
The Tin Man was down on one knee, leaning on
his axe for balance.

"On second thought," I said, "I think I really hurt
my head."
"I'm not surprised," he said. "1 was just sitting
here on this stump, thinking about an old friend,
when you came hurtling down from the sky and
landed there on the road."

"Yeah, well, you know what they say. People
come and go so quickly here."
"Yes, I know,"he said sadly, reaching into his
hip pocket for a flask of crude oil. "One minute
she was at my side. The next minute,
'click-click-click,' and she was gone." As he took a
vigorous swig from the flask, a single tear traced its
treacherous path down his silver cheek.
"Oh, don't cry!" I said, jumping up. "You'll rust!"
"Oh, oh, oh —" he broke into sobs. "That's just
what she used to say," he cried, sitting down so hard
he dented his derriere.
"There, there," I soothed. "She had to go, you know
I mean, it wouldn't have worked. You're from two
different worlds."
"I know I'm old, but I'm not that old!" he said wit!
some spirit.
"No, that's not what I meant. But it would have
been hard for a young girl like Dorothy to feci happy
with you. I mean, you've got a lot of silver in your

hair. And you do run short on
elbow grease. In another few years,
you could have real problems with
arthritis. Can you blame her for
leaving?"
"I ... I guess not. But how is
it you know so much about what
Dorothy wants? And anyway, my
age shouldn't matter. Love should
have bridged the chasm between
youth and age, even between
Kansas and Oz."
"I know that's what love is sup
posed to do. But hearts aren't per
fect, and there are some things
that even love can't do."
He looked surprised and hurt.
"I gave everything I had to find
love, and you're telling me it's not
worth finding."
"Lesson number one," I began.
"The tinsmith didn't forget to give
you a heart. He just couldn't do
it. You can't manufacture love.
Everybody makes his own heart,
but it doesn't always come with a
warranty."
"Tell me about it. Now I know
I've got a heart, 'cause it's break
ing.' "
"Exactly," I said. "And don't you
know, you loved Dorothy long
before you got your ticker there.
You're looking too hard for love.
You've got to find it inside."
"Well, that's easy to say, but it
doesn't take away the pain. I did
find love inside — love for
Dorothy. Maybe I was foolish to
think she could return it, but . . ."
"Actually, you probably were
being foolish. You remember when
the witch told you to steer clear
of Dorothy?"
"She was a sweet, sincere girl!"
"Yeah, but her life was always
in turmoil. If the earliest stages of
a relationship are filled with con
flict, chaos and disaster, then you

should bail while you have the
chance. Date a Dorothy — some
one who's always fleeing the nasty
witches of childhood repressions
— and you're in for nothing but
heartache."
"Oh, this is too much!" and he
slammed his hand on his knee
with a resounding pingggg! and a
shower of sparks. "Be glad she left!
I wanted to cry for hours!"
"Well, you should have done it,"
I said, folding my arms over my
chest. "Dorothy was always telling
you to hold back, not to show your
feelings. Well, I say, don't give your
heart to someone who won't let
you show your true emotions. Love
isn't afraid of honesty."
He sniffled and wiped his eyes.
"No, that's okay," he said. "You're
right. Dorothy was a bitter-sweet
moment in my life, but the mo
ment's gone, and I should remem
ber her as she was and not try to
make her perfect."
He smiled faintly. "I know I
sound pretty empty. But, after all
is said and done, I did find what
I was looking for. I can register
emotion, jealousy, devotion, and
really feel the part."
"Yeah. Love's a strong feeling
." My words trailed off. I was
blue again, remembering my own
heartache. I needed to be alone.
"Listen, I've gotta get going," I
said. "I've got a deadline at The
Daily, and I still don't know what
to write for a Valentine story."
For a moment he looked sad
that I was leaving. Then his eyes
brightened. "I know what you can
tell them!" He whispered some
thing in my ear.
"Got it," I said. "I'll be sure they
get the message." Then I clicked
my heels and . . .
. . . and the Wizard is right:
"Hearts can never be practical until
they can be made unbreakable."
But you know what the Tin Man
said.
"But I ... I still want one."

and he is my favorite. After all, what

are courage and honor and truth and
home, without heart, without love? The Tin
Man's quest endeared him to me above all

the other pilgrims in that timeless myth,
and I knew early in my life I should follow
in his clanking footsteps.

Yet here 1 sat, rusting in the junkyard of love.
Where did I go wrong? I'd asked myself that ques
tion a thousand times, and I already knew the
answer: my

fault. My stupid fault. If I could just get away from
my life for awhile, maybe go back in time or some
thing . . .

"I've gotta get out of this gloomy room," I said aloud
I grabbed my car keys, jumped up, and . . .
Damn! What happened to my headl I must have
bumped it on the desk drawer. I can't see anything.
A bright beam of light momentarily blinded my vi
sion. When my eyes finally focused, I found myself
looking at a strangely familiar face. Sunlight glinted off
his funnel hat, and his ticking testimonial dangled an
inch from my nose.

"Are you hurt?" he asked kindly.
"I don't think so," I said, rubbing my head. Then I
took a look around. I was lying on a yellow brick path
that ran through the middle of a wooded clearing.
The Tin Man was down on one knee, leaning on
his axe for balance.

"On second thought," I said, "I think I really hurt
my head."
"I'm not surprised," he said. "1 was just sitting
here on this stump, thinking about an old friend,
when you came hurtling down from the sky and
landed there on the road."

"Yeah, well, you know what they say. People
come and go so quickly here."
"Yes, I know,"he said sadly, reaching into his
hip pocket for a flask of crude oil. "One minute
she was at my side. The next minute,
'click-click-click,' and she was gone." As he took a
vigorous swig from the flask, a single tear traced its
treacherous path down his silver cheek.
"Oh, don't cry!" I said, jumping up. "You'll rust!"
"Oh, oh, oh —" he broke into sobs. "That's just
what she used to say," he cried, sitting down so hard
he dented his derriere.
"There, there," I soothed. "She had to go, you know
I mean, it wouldn't have worked. You're from two
different worlds."
"I know I'm old, but I'm not that old!" he said wit!
some spirit.
"No, that's not what I meant. But it would have
been hard for a young girl like Dorothy to feci happy
with you. I mean, you've got a lot of silver in your

hair. And you do run short on
elbow grease. In another few years,
you could have real problems with
arthritis. Can you blame her for
leaving?"
"I ... I guess not. But how is
it you know so much about what
Dorothy wants? And anyway, my
age shouldn't matter. Love should
have bridged the chasm between
youth and age, even between
Kansas and Oz."
"I know that's what love is sup
posed to do. But hearts aren't per
fect, and there are some things
that even love can't do."
He looked surprised and hurt.
"I gave everything I had to find
love, and you're telling me it's not
worth finding."
"Lesson number one," I began.
"The tinsmith didn't forget to give
you a heart. He just couldn't do
it. You can't manufacture love.
Everybody makes his own heart,
but it doesn't always come with a
warranty."
"Tell me about it. Now I know
I've got a heart, 'cause it's break
ing.' "
"Exactly," I said. "And don't you
know, you loved Dorothy long
before you got your ticker there.
You're looking too hard for love.
You've got to find it inside."
"Well, that's easy to say, but it
doesn't take away the pain. I did
find love inside — love for
Dorothy. Maybe I was foolish to
think she could return it, but . . ."
"Actually, you probably were
being foolish. You remember when
the witch told you to steer clear
of Dorothy?"
"She was a sweet, sincere girl!"
"Yeah, but her life was always
in turmoil. If the earliest stages of
a relationship are filled with con
flict, chaos and disaster, then you

should bail while you have the
chance. Date a Dorothy — some
one who's always fleeing the nasty
witches of childhood repressions
— and you're in for nothing but
heartache."
"Oh, this is too much!" and he
slammed his hand on his knee
with a resounding pingggg! and a
shower of sparks. "Be glad she left!
I wanted to cry for hours!"
"Well, you should have done it,"
I said, folding my arms over my
chest. "Dorothy was always telling
you to hold back, not to show your
feelings. Well, I say, don't give your
heart to someone who won't let
you show your true emotions. Love
isn't afraid of honesty."
He sniffled and wiped his eyes.
"No, that's okay," he said. "You're
right. Dorothy was a bitter-sweet
moment in my life, but the mo
ment's gone, and I should remem
ber her as she was and not try to
make her perfect."
He smiled faintly. "I know I
sound pretty empty. But, after all
is said and done, I did find what
I was looking for. I can register
emotion, jealousy, devotion, and
really feel the part."
"Yeah. Love's a strong feeling
." My words trailed off. I was
blue again, remembering my own
heartache. I needed to be alone.
"Listen, I've gotta get going," I
said. "I've got a deadline at The
Daily, and I still don't know what
to write for a Valentine story."
For a moment he looked sad
that I was leaving. Then his eyes
brightened. "I know what you can
tell them!" He whispered some
thing in my ear.
"Got it," I said. "I'll be sure they
get the message." Then I clicked
my heels and . . .
. . . and the Wizard is right:
"Hearts can never be practical until
they can be made unbreakable."
But you know what the Tin Man
said.
"But I ... I still want one."
THE STANFORD DAILY'S JV^

You want a heart! You don't know
how lucky you are not to have one.
Hearts will never be practical until
they can be made unbreakable.
The Wizard wasn't lying. Two
weeks ago I sat in the middle of my
floor, surrounded by little shreds of
paper. My love letters, returned to
me in pieces, reflected the disarray of
my shattered heart.
Sound corny? My life is almost a
B-movie. Almost. In B-movies, love
conquers all. In my life, love falters
and fails.
So there 1 sit, like Alice in her sea
of self-piteous tears, having loved and
lost and not liking it at all. I look
around me, staring blankly at my
bleak life, when my eyes light on a
familiar image. On the wall, smiling
down upon me, is the patron saint of
my passion: the Tin Man.
