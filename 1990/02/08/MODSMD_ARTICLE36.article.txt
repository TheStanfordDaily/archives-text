## Heart Search It's not just for the Tin Man

You want a heart! You don't know
how lucky you are not to have one.
Hearts will never be practical until
they can be made unbreakable.
The Wizard wasn't lying. Two
weeks ago I sat in the middle of my
floor, surrounded by little shreds of
paper. My love letters, returned to
me in pieces, reflected the disarray of
my shattered heart.
Sound corny? My life is almost a
B-movie. Almost. In B-movies, love
conquers all. In my life, love falters
and fails.
So there 1 sit, like Alice in her sea
of self-piteous tears, having loved and
lost and not liking it at all. I look
around me, staring blankly at my
bleak life, when my eyes light on a
familiar image. On the wall, smiling
down upon me, is the patron saint of
my passion: the Tin Man.

My metallic friend is one of several
"Wizard of Oz" icons gracing my walls,
and he is my favorite. After all, what

are courage and honor and truth and
home, without heart, without love? The Tin
Man's quest endeared him to me above all

the other pilgrims in that timeless myth,
and I knew early in my life I should follow
in his clanking footsteps.

Yet here 1 sat, rusting in the junkyard of love.
Where did I go wrong? I'd asked myself that ques
tion a thousand times, and I already knew the
answer: my

fault. My stupid fault. If I could just get away from
my life for awhile, maybe go back in time or some
thing . . .

"I've gotta get out of this gloomy room," I said aloud
I grabbed my car keys, jumped up, and . . .
Damn! What happened to my headl I must have
bumped it on the desk drawer. I can't see anything.
A bright beam of light momentarily blinded my vi
sion. When my eyes finally focused, I found myself
looking at a strangely familiar face. Sunlight glinted off
his funnel hat, and his ticking testimonial dangled an
inch from my nose.

"Are you hurt?" he asked kindly.
"I don't think so," I said, rubbing my head. Then I
took a look around. I was lying on a yellow brick path
that ran through the middle of a wooded clearing.
The Tin Man was down on one knee, leaning on
his axe for balance.

"On second thought," I said, "I think I really hurt
my head."
"I'm not surprised," he said. "1 was just sitting
here on this stump, thinking about an old friend,
when you came hurtling down from the sky and
landed there on the road."

"Yeah, well, you know what they say. People
come and go so quickly here."
"Yes, I know,"he said sadly, reaching into his
hip pocket for a flask of crude oil. "One minute
she was at my side. The next minute,
'click-click-click,' and she was gone." As he took a
vigorous swig from the flask, a single tear traced its
treacherous path down his silver cheek.
"Oh, don't cry!" I said, jumping up. "You'll rust!"
"Oh, oh, oh â€”" he broke into sobs. "That's just
what she used to say," he cried, sitting down so hard
he dented his derriere.
"There, there," I soothed. "She had to go, you know
I mean, it wouldn't have worked. You're from two
different worlds."
"I know I'm old, but I'm not that old!" he said wit!
some spirit.
"No, that's not what I meant. But it would have
been hard for a young girl like Dorothy to feci happy
with you. I mean, you've got a lot of silver in your
