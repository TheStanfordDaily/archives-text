# Flashbacks to '60s, though done in '80s, look better in '90s
## 
### Mark Pinkus Staff writer 
Just when you thought you had
had enough of movies about the
'60s, one more film about the
hippie heyday comes along. But
"Flashback," starring Dennis Hop
per and Keifer Sutherland, does an
excellent job of representing the
glorious flower power era in terms
of the 19905.
Hopper hands in a brilliant per
formance as Huey Walker, a fugi
tive rabble-rouser wanted by the
FBI for over 20 years for allegedly
conspiring against then vice
president Spiro Agnew. Walker,
more than anything else, is a
prankster simply vying for a little
publicity in hopes of getting his
book published. Hopper brings a
genuine feeling to his character
that quickly attracts the audience's
sympathies.
Sutherland, on the other hand,
plays John Buckner, a hard-nosed
rookie FBI agent in charge of
delivering Walker from San Fran-
CISCO to opok.Oi*., »•

pivotal scene at Rainbow Zen, an
outdated Oregon commune, the
likes of Buckner are very hard to
stomach.
The commune scene changes
the pace of the entire movie. Before
this scene, the film plods along in
an entertaining yet unemotional
way. But clips of a well-made home
movie portraying life on the com
mune during the "summer of love"
gives "Flashback" the emotional
charge it was missing
The final segment of the film
builds off this newfound momen
tum, eventually creating a very
touching picture that offers the
'60s the respect it deserves.
As the star and director of the
cult classic "Easy Rider," Hopper
has had the experience of making
a realistic reflection of this often
over-romanticized time period.
Rather than trying to tell us that
the future can never be as good as
past, Hopper concludes with

the sentiment, "You'll see, the '90s
are going to make the '60s look
like the \SOs."
"Flashback'' reflects this sort of
optimism about the upcoming dec
ade. And if the soundtrack is any
indication, musically, there is
hope. Throughout the film, classic
rock by Jinn Hendrix and Bob
Dylan is successfully integrated
with recent releases by REM. and
Big Audio Dynamite
The movie includes a speech by
modern political satirist Mort Sahl.
Blaring from loudspeakers of a psy
chedelic bus, reminiscent of the
one used by Ken Keasey and his
pranksters, the curious crowd is
warned about being manipulated
by their government, thereby com
promising their own ideals. Sahl's
oration sounds like a speech from
20 years ago, but the poignancy it
offers today makes the audience
sit up and listen.
"Flashback" is not a nostalgic
movie for 1960s relics. Instead, it
is a film for 1990s optimists who
believe that this decade can truly
be an era of change and progrcs-
