# Despite earthquake, new housing still on track
## 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
The closing of seven houses following
the Oct. 17 earthquake put a strain
on student housing at the University,
but plans for a new dormitory that
would help relieve the strain are
proceeding on schedule.
Kimball Hall, which will replace a
portion of Manzanita Park, is sched
uled to open in September 1991. "Kim
ball Hall is, in fact, one of the few
things that has been unaffected by the
earthquake," said Richard Bennett, as
sociate director of the Centennial Cam
paign.
One of the Centennial Campaign's
primary objectives is to significantly
increase undergraduate housing space,

and the earthquake has not changed
that priority, Bennett said. Kimball
Hall's planned opening will be the
"next-to-the-last step on the way" to
guaranteeing four years of housing to
all undergraduates, he said.
Had the seven residences not been
closed following the earthquake, Kim
ball Hall's 200 beds would have elim
inated half of the unguaranteed
students who remain without housing
each year.
But the earthquake complicated this
issue, making guaranteed housing even
more scarce in the next Draw. Three
of the seven closed houses will remain
closed next fall, according to Rodger
Whitney, director of student housing.
The repair project is a separate process
and will not affect the progress of

Kimball Hall, he said.
However, approximately 20 trailers
will be removed as residences next year
as construction on Kimball Hall
proceeds. The eliminated spaces will
come from graduate student spots,
Hensley said, "because the University
has made a very strong commitment
to meet the need for undergraduate
housing."
The funds for the $10 million project
were secured prior to the earthquake
and therefore were not affected by it,
Bennett said.
The $7 million pledged by Stanford
trustees Peter Bing, Thomas Ford and
William Kimball will form the finan
cial basis for the project. The balance
will be financed "the usual way â€”
through debt," Bennett said. The Uni

versity debt service is similar to a
house mortgage and is the standard
method for financing new dorms.
The most recent building plans for
Kimball Hall will be presented to the
Board of Trustees for the third level
of detail approval on Monday.
The architecture of the three-story
hall will closely model that of neigh
boring Branner and Toyon Halls.
"We're back on track," project coor
dinator Robin Hensley said, and it ap
pears to be a pretty fast track.
Construction is set to begin immedi
ately after graduation this spring.
Eventually, the University plans to
expand Kimball Hall to provide about
550 to 600 beds, Bennett said. There
is no estimate as to when this second
phase of construction will begin.
