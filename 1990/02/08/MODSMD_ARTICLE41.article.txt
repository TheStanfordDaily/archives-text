Driving Miss Daisy
Based upon Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize win
ning play, "Driving Miss Daisy" otters Oscar
caliber performances by Morgan Freeman and
Jessica Tandy. The film is extremely engaging
and is one of the very best of 1989.
Born On The Fourth Of July
Director Oliver Stone's spiritual sequel to
"Platoon" is incredibly mesmerizing and un
pleasant. Tom Cruise gives the performance of
his career. I would not recommend this film for
a date, but but make every effort to see it.
Glory
Depicting the horrors of war and racism,
"Glory" is one of the few true Civil War films
to actually.focus on the war itself. The pageantry
and time period make the film much more
watchable than "Born On The Fourth Of July."
Always
Steven Spielberg's latest film has been over
looked to an extent, and that's a shame. "Al
ways" is an immensely entertaining romantic
comedy even though it's a little sappy.
The Little Mermaid
The most successful first-run animation ever,
"The Little Mermaid" is pure fun. The energetic
soundtrack will stick in your mind. Go see the
matinee show on the weekend. It's pure Disney
(even though Walt's dead).
