## Conclusion keeps Midler film from being 'Stella' 
### Greg Douglas 
I must confess that I am not much
of a Bette Midler fan.
In fact, I've actually grown to dislike
her rather vehemently in my two
decades of existence. Thus, I ventured
upon this movie-reviewing jaunt with
a definite predilection against any film
with Midler in the starring role, espe
cially one touted as rivaling "Steel Mag
nolias" for "sappiest movie of the year."
"Stella," however, proved much better
than I had originally anticipated.
In general, the acting was superb.
Midler, in the title role, delivers a con
vincing and engaging (albeit annoying)
performance as the bartender/single

mother who strives to provide the best
for her baby girl. Stephen Collins, the
affluent absentee doctor/father, gives an
outstanding portrayal of a man who
wants to know the love and warmth
of his unexpected daughter.
Both John Goodman, Stella's good
natured yet alcoholic friend, and Trim
Alvarado, the daughter torn between
her love for her divided parents, also
add magnificently to the overall acting
level of the flick.
The plot captured my attention for
most of the film, the breadth of situ
ations permitting every age and gender
to identify with some aspect of the
film. Several times I found myself
genuinely touched by the story.

However, about an hour and a half
into the movie, these emotional scenes
reached and surpassed the threshold of
tolerance. In the midst of riding the
emotional roller coaster up and down
again, I stopped short and thought to
myself, "When will the madness end?"
Still, I easily managed to slip back into
the emotions and crises of the charac
ters — at least until the conclusion.
Unfortunately, the film's ending
shattered my embryonic appreciation
for the efforts of Midler and the other
actors. Although I certainly would not
want to give it away for fear of ostraciz
ing those who admire the wet world of
emotional purging, the conclusion of

this movie leaves too many strings
untied. None of the major conflicts be
tween the primary characters are re
solved by the movie's ending, leaving
the viewer lost and alone to interpret
the real ending of the film.
Overall, "Stella" is a touching, enter
taining movie that capitalizes on its
impressive acting performances. How
ever, the movie's nebulous conclusion
leaves one with a bad aftertaste.
