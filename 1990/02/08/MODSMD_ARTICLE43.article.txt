# 'Sarge' leaves audience wondering who's in charge
## 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
"A Man Called Sarge" should never
have happened.
The screenplay, acting, directing, and
producing of this movie were all huge
mistakes. Together, "A Man Called
Sarge" represents perhaps one of the
worst motion pictures of all time.
Although obviously inspired by Mel
Brooks and the "Airplane" movies, this
sorry excuse for a plot falls flat on its
face without any of Brooks' grace or
Airplane's humor.
Set in 1942 in Northern Africa, "A
Man Called Sarge" follows a band of

four American soldiers who leave the
defeated French Foreign Legion to help
Montgomery's "Limey" troops defeat
the "sour"-Krauts.
Led by the Sarge (played by unknown
— and if this is the best he can do,
he'll remain unknown — Garry
Kroeger), the small band is nothing
more than a motley crew of superficial
characters with less depth than Lake
Lag. Together, they bumble through a
plot that resembles the worst of Buck
aroo Banzai and lohn Wayne's "The
Green Berets."
Like all real American servicemen in
Hollywood films, Sarge has a love
interest. He meets Sadie, a horny Amer

ican schoolteacher, in an Arab village,
and together they provide the viewer
with two staged "boy meets girl" scenes
and one romantic "boy punches girl
out" scene.
To round out the cast, there is also
an incompetent British officer; a
rescued French officer who is later killed
by his estranged lover-turned double
agent, Fifi; and a blonde-haired German
"bad guy" with a bad accent, none of
whom deserve further mention.
Besides having an uninspired cast,
the script by Stuart Gillard leaves every
thing to be desired, including an ad
mission rebate. Going to the bathroom
has never improved a movie's artistic

value like this one.
The attempts at humor are restricted
to unfunny Brooks-like exaggerations,
tasteless allusions to the history of
World War II (including the Holocaust)
and not-so-subtle, not-so-funny stereo
typical 19405-era racial slurs (i.e. Nips,
lerrys, Krauts, Frogs, Limeys).
So, besides having a poorly written
script, actors that can't act and a plot
less plot, "A Man Called Sarge" is the
movie to see.
