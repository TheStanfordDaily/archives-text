# Buddy film is in critical 'Condition'
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
Like its title implies, "Heart Condi
tion" is a schizophrenic film that needs
a doctor, not an audience. Part of the
time it is attempting (with the key word
being "attempting") to be a comedy,- at
other times the film aspires to serious.

O Heart Condition
Bob Hoskins, Denzel Washington

Most of the time, though, it seems
satisfied resembling a bad miniseries on
CBS. Why do people even bother to make
films like this?
If I had to guess, I'd say that the
writers, directors and actors responsible
for this regurgitation have probably
deluded themselves into thinking that
they have come up with a thought
provokuig, vsocially relevant vanauon on
the "buddy film." A glance at the press
packet proved I was correct.
Writer/director James Parriott claimed,

"It's not a conventional buddy picture.
The idea was to take two polemic char
acters and put them together." Surely he
jests.
Surprisingly, Parriott goes on to invoke
George Bernard Shaw. "There's a little
bit of 'Pygmalion' here," hallucinated
Parriott. Perhaps Parriott had trouble get
ting enough blood to the brain.
For all of Parriott's posturing, one
would expect "My Fair Lady" or "In The
Heat Of The Night." Instead, he serves
up a story about a bigoted vice cop named
Moony (Bob Hoskins) who suffers a heart
attack. Moony receives his new heart
from Napoleon Stone (Denzel Washing
ton), a stylish black attorney who is
romantically linked with Moony's old
girlfriend.
The twist is that Stone's spirit follows
Moony wherever he goes. And surpris
ingly enough, Moony and Stone don't
like each other. Imagine that!
With this innovative uhaiacter twist
as his motivation, Mo skirts finds an ex
cuse to recycle his acting style from

Washington's appearance in "Heart
Condition" is a whole different story. I
hope that this is not a sign that he is
selling out. Perhaps a Denzel Washington
integrity fund should be initiated so he
will have an incentive to make good
films.
