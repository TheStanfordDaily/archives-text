## Last of the road house restaurants Alice's provides exquisite fare that's not just for lumberjacks 
### Elizabeth Laurence Staff writer 
In the old logging town of Wood
side, where the golden arches of
McDonald's would appear puny
among the redwoods, there stands
a member of that noble, near
extinct species, the road house.
At Alice's restaurant, tucked in
the mountains where Skyline
meets Woodside Road, you can get
not only an honest American meal,
but also, as Arlo Guthrie assures
us, just about anything else you
want.
Alice's is a world away from Palo
Alto. Though the restaurant does
steady business at breakfast and
lunch, it gets packed for weekend
brunch. Despite recently beginning
to serve dinner, it has managed to
maintain integrity befitting a place
that started out as a general store
for loggers.
Little white curtains and neon

beer signs adorn the windows; red
and-white checked vinyl tops the
tables. The dark wood walls are
covered with relics of old Califor
nia and even of the restaurant's
own history. A newspaper photo
shows motorcycles packed in the
parking lot during the biker con
vention held at Alice's last June.
The dinner patrons were wearing
plaid lumberjack shirts, not from
any desire to fit in at Alice's, but
because many were the type who
wear plaid lumberjack shirts. The
down-home atmosphere was com
pleted by live music every Staurday
night.
The food is a little pricey and
less down-to-earth than you might
expect, but it's well worth it. The
dinner specials I ordered, a
cornmeal torte appetizer and an
entree of fettucine with vegetables,
were each satisfying and no* en
tirely conventional. The torte
bathed in tomato sauce, while the

fettucine swam among artichoke
hearts in a savory sea of provolone.
In addition to the specials, Alice's
offers a large selection of burgers
and other entrees. Whatever you
choose, be prepared for big por
tions.
And don't skip dessert. The res
taurant has many different fruit
pies whose evil twins mock us
from Food Service dessert plates.
One would not expect to find
espresso available in the middle of
the woods. With a unique restau
rant like Alice's, however, the sur
prising just seems plausible.

Alice's Restauraunt is located at
Skyline Blvd and Lahonda Road in
Woodside.
