## 'Up' beats leave ABC release heavy but hollow 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
It's rare to find an album that
falls into its own trap, but ABC's
latest release does just that.
As Martin Fry sings in the al
bum's final song, today's world is
"Paper Thin": Rich and wealthy
canvas / Clustered up in jewels /
Finding all your heavyweights / Are
featherweights and fools.
A clever critique that talks about
origami cities and nations built on
sand, the song nevertheless unveils

the failures of Up compared to
past ABC releases.
With the freshness of its earlier
releases, most notably Lexicon of
Love with the hits "Look of Love"
and "Poison Arrow," ABC estab
lished itself as a band that thrived
on originality. Now, you hear lyrics
like these in "I'm in Love With
You": I would swim the seven seas
/ 1 would crawl upon my knees /
I climb mountains high for you /
I would guarantee your every
dream come true / Oh I - I'm in

Up

love with you / Yes it's true. .. .
Despite being light on lyrics, Up
is heavy on beats.
The vibrance of the album's
basic rhythm is complemented
well by strong keyboard work by
Mark White — with Fry, the band's
only remaining member. When
heavy sax riffs are added on

"North," the album sounds com
plete with a jazzy dance appeal.
However, the album's candy
coatcd feel does not hook the lis
tener's passion. And despite the
incessant repetition of song titles
in the lyrics, most of the eight
songs are forgotten soon after they
are over.
The compact disc contains three
appealing remixes and has the best
disc art design available. But in
the end, as Fry sings, the album
is heavy but hollow.
