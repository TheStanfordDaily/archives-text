# They might be drowning in overwhelming 'Flood'
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Flood is not a normal album.
But then, They Might Be Giants
is certainly not a normal band.
One would expect as much from
a band whose most popular song,
"Don't Let's Start," has a video
sporting 8-foot hairdos. If you're
looking for socially conscious
music, look elsewhere; They Might
Be Giants' repertoire includes
tracks like "Toddler Hiway" and
"Chess Piece Face." Obviously,
this is not a band to take seriously.
All of the 19 tracks on They
Might Be Giants' newest album,
Flood, uphold the group's zany tra
dition. Flood is a dizzying tour of
random, scattered images. John
Flansburgh and John Linnel share
vocal and musical responsibilities
on the album. With track titles

Flood

like "Someone Keeps Moving My
Chair," "Sapphire Bullets of Pure
Love," and "Road Movie to Berlin,"
Flood comes off more like a mu
sical attempt at comedy.
And like most comedy, the
routine has its high and low points.
One of the better tracks, "Particle
Man," begins as a allusion to the
Beatles "Nowhere Man." Particle
Man, Particle Man/Is he a dot, or
is he a specks/When he's under
water, does he get wet! By the
middle of the song, however, the
band's intentions go awry, as They
Might Be Giants ponders Triangle
Man, Universe Man, and Person
Man. Background instruments
from tambourines and accordions

only compound the insanity.
The album's finest moment is
"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)," a
remake of the Four Lads' 1953
novelty. After beginning with
serious violins, They Might Be
Giants breaks into the quick, ri
diculous lyrics with such speed and
intensity that one can't help but
laugh.
The duo even succeeds with one
attempt at sober sincerity. In
"Lucky Ball & Chain," they lament
over unrequited love. 1 could shake
my tiny fist/eP swear I wasn't
wrong/But what's the sense in ar
guing/When you're all alone. It's
a surprising direction for They
Might Be Giants, and the endeavor
is quite admirable.
However, Flood does have its
share of weaknesses. Most of the
time, it's .difficult to discern
whether the lyrics are symbolically

cryptic or just plain weird. In
"Birdhouse In Your Soul," the band
insists It's a simple message
but follows with phrases like My
story's infinite/Like the longines
Symphonette.
It's also difficult to overwhelm
the strength of the often nasal vo
cals with light background music.
In "Hearing Aid," even the use of
sound effects can't save the vapid
lyrics. Attempts to sound like The
Beatles, "Rawhide," and "Hee
Haw" fare no better. Unfortunate
ly, it is the album's worst tracks
which stand out the most.
They Might Be Giants, in itself,
is a pretty funny joke. But any
good comedian knows that jokes
grow old. And without solid lyrical
or musical direction, They Might
Be Giants still is not good enough
to hold the spotlight for their entire
act.
