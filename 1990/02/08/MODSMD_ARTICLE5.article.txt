# Refund reform raised
## ASSU Senate chair proposes new process 
### Doug Lillydahl 
Amid debate centering on fee
requests, the ASSU Senate chair
proposed last night to eliminate
fee refunds, a plan that could save
the ASSU $15,000 in administra
tive costs.
Senate Chair Ed Sasaki out
lined several amendments to the
ASSU Constitution that would
reform the current fee refund sys
tem, promoting budget stability
for several student organizations.
Two-thirds of those who vote in
the spring elections are needed to
pass an amendment to the consti
tution.
Because many students have
collected their refunds in recent
years, several campus groups have
been left with unexpected budget
deficits.
Todd White, director of SURE
escort service, explained that the
unpredictable nature of the cur
rent system does "not meet the
needs of student groups what
soever" in creating budgets and

meeting commitments.
Under the current system,
groups are still unsure of their
resources until the ASSU refund
process is completed.
In order to prevent this uncer
tainty, organizations can budget
a "buffer" of up to 25 percent in
their fee request. If students take
back more than this amount from
a group's budget, then the organ
ization must repay the ASSU the
difference and operate with a def
icit.
The new proposal would create
two main reforms. First, student
fees would be reduced by the 25
percent buffer, and fee refunds
would be abolished.
Second, students who conscien
tiously object to funding specific
programs may reallocate their
money into the Program Board
funds or into the ASSU Senate
Discretionary Fund.
Sasaki anticipates that if these
reforms are accepted, $15,000 in
administrative costs for refunds
will be saved.
