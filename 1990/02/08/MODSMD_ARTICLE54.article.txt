## Composer turns story about killer into musical 
### Anita Schneider 
"There are very few things in
my life that I felt so certain and
so passionate about," said Douglas
Cohen, creator of the play based
on William Goldman's novel, "No
Way to Treat a Lady." Cohen
needed this passion to successfully
follow through on his goal of turn
ing the brutal story of a serial killer
into a musical theater piece.
Getting the rights to the book
wasn't an easy task. Though im
mediately impressed with Cohen's
song*, Goldman was concerned
that the savagery of "No Way to
Treat a Lady" would not be suitable
material for a musical.
Then Goldman heard Cohen's
songs performed at the ASCAP
musical theatre workshop in New
York City, where Cohen won the
support of a prestigious panel that
included Marvin Hamlish, Charles
Strouse ("Annie") and Bert Lane
("Finnian's Rainbow"). Goldman
was convinced, and later Cohen
received a Richard Rogers Founda
tion Grant that enabled him to
complete the work.
Though the serial murders are
what give "No Way to Treat a
Lady" its momentum, the story,
as Cohen views it, is really about
loneliness.
Kit, the serial killer, is desper
ately seeking his mother's love.
Morris Brummell, the New York
City cop assigned to the case, is
afraid to leave home, and his over
protective mother Flora fears that
he will. And Sarah, the beautiful,
sophisticated woman who enters
Morris' life as a result of the in
vestigation, desperately seeks com
panionship.
What adds a theatrical twist to
the story is that Kit is also a frus
trated actor. Fie takes on a variety
of disguises — priest, dance in-

murders are what

Treat a Lady' its mo

structor, French waiter, boy scout,
pizza delivery boy — to win his
victims' trust before striking.
W. Truett Roberts has created
an ingenious setting that resem
bles the inside of a disordered
mind. He clutters the stage with
old relics, hangs pictures at odd
angles, and takes away the barriers
between rooms. And Randal
West's precise and fluid direction
tempers the energy of his talented
cast.
Darlene Popovic plays the ghost
of Kit's mother, Morris' mother,
and each of the middle-aged vic
tims. Popovic is like a kaleido
scope. She easily and convincingly
transforms from Irish-Catholic
widow to Spanish dancer to Dolly
Parton look-alike.
As Kit, Stephen Frugoli's per
formance is absorbing, but slightly
stiff. When singing "Once More
From The Top," he seems to be
trying too hard. He relaxes, though,
in a final, soulful scene with Brum
mell.
James Shelby as Morris Brum
mell and Annie Kozuch as Sarah
Stone have a true sense of their
developing relationship and their
love songs provide a good balance
to the otherwise macabre subject
matter.
Playwright, composer, and
lyricist Cohen has developed an
unusual gem. His lyrics are clever
and funny, and his music is haunt

ing and expressive. Despite mini
mal predictability, his script
works well.
Cohen said he was "attracted to
properties where it's not just black
and white — there are gradations
of color, and a villain might com
mand our sympathies." With "No
Way to Treat a Lady," he contri

butes a whole spcctrum of his tal
ents to form a tight, professional,
and inventive musical.

"No Way to Treat a Lady" plays
until Mar. 4 on Theatre Works'
Stage 11, located at Jordan Center
Theater, 2225 Middlefield Road in
Palo Alto.
