# Offering a chance to dance

The girls lined up in front of
the mirror, scrutinizing their
dancing images as instructor
Ehud Krauss led them through
the choreography.
"One, two, three, four and
stretch...."
After they performed the com
bination to his liking, he told
them to practice another dance
step across the floor of the
classroom-turned-studio at East
Palo Alto's Ronald McNair
Middle School.
Decked in their colorful out
fits, some sporting dancewear
and jaw shoes and others in
street clothes, they pranced
across the floor.
"This step is like the cabbage
patch!" said one.
Another shouted triumphantly,
"I did it! I did it!"
These young students are part
of IndepenDANCE, a dance train
ing and performance program
geared for minority primary
school students in East Palo Alto.
The program allows "at-risk"
youth to receive free dance lessons
at least twice a week. The pro
gram is sponsored by the local
Zohar Dance Company, which
Krauss founded.
After watching some junior
high students breakdance in East
Palo Alto, Krauss piloted Indepen-
DANCE with 30 students. These
teenagers could certainly dance
like those he studied with at the
famous Alvin Ailey School in New
York, he thought. All they needed
was a chance.
When presented with the oppor
tunity, many young people eagerly
seized it. In a period of three
years, IndepenDANCE grew to

about 400 pupils, with students
from the Ravenswood School Dis
trict of East Palo Alto and from
the surrounding area. This year,
enrollment has decreased to
around 300 pupils because of a
lack of funds, Krauss said.
About 15 advanced dancers are
also in the Step-Up Ensemble.
These students take private
classes at the Zohar dance studio
and perform in the community.
Krauss, originally from Israel,
said people respond strangely
when they first see him with his
students.
"What's this white guy doing
with all these [black] kids?" is a
typical response, he said.
But "it doesn't make a differ
ence who teaches," Krauss said.
"It's a process not learning from
a book, but from a human being.
They get to learn from life."
Krauss has learned much from
the students about their language
and music. He often listens to
black radio stations to enable him
to choreograph pieces for Indepen-
DANCE.
"I have to know what I'm
doing," he said with Quincy
Jones' latest album playing in the

background.
The thought of Krauss not
knowing what he*3 doing has
never entered the minds of his
students. Although he is a strict
taskmaster, they say they er\joy
the challenge of participating in
the extracurricular activity.
IndepenDANCE has helped
Abayomi Jones to gain a sense of
discipline, a trait she will need
later in life. Jones, 9, plans to
become an obstetrician and dance
in her spare time.
Yashsmeen Oakley, an 11-year
old Step-Up student, laughed as
she imitated Krauss when he feels
his pupils are not giving their all.
"Get your stuff! Y'all can
leave!" Oakley mimicked.
Even though his students are
between the ages of 9 and 13,
Krauss expects them to meet pro
fessional standards of excellence.
Earlier at a lesson at the
McNair school, several students
left without informing Krauss.
When Krauss asked where one girl
was, he was simply told, "She
left."
He paused, noticeably upset.
"Well, that's her problem, honey!"
"I heard that!" a student

chimed.
The girl who left later called to
apologize, almost in tears.
Just as Krauss demands a lot
from his dancers, they demand
much of themselves.
Oakley gets mad when she can
not attend IndepenDANCE. "It's
something to look forward to," she
said. "When I dance, I feel like I
can do anything."
"Dance is a part of life. Just
like everyone has to get up every
morning and go to school, we have
to go to school and dance," Oakley
said.
Krauss pointed out that stu
dents must demonstrate this dis
cipline to remain in the program
because he checks their report
cards.
Besides teaching movement,
Krauss focuses on creative expres
sion. Students occasionally com
pose their own steps or analyze
their videotaped performances. At
other times, they attend master
classes taught by professional
dancers and instructors.
"Whatever they see on music
videos, I let them know they can
do it, too. I like the kids to have
some pride," Krauss said.
