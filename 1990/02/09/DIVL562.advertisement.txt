Student Telephone Services
By September 1990, the University will extend Stanford telephone services to all on-campus
student residences. Communication Services, the Stanford University department that provides
telephone service, would like to present an overview of the planned student telephone services.
The Stanford offering, which is very similar to those offered in peer institutions, is already being
used by students living in Roble Hal.
BfCosts for Stanford Telephone Services
For most students, Stanford telephone services wiN be less expen
sive than similar services from Pacific BeH. Specifically, this is the
case with the following rates:
® Una Sarvica: $12.95 per month for unlimited local area dialing.
Comparable service from Pacific Bell is $13.25. Communica
tion Services will lower its rate in September 1990.
® Call Waiting: An optional feature for $2.40 per month. Pacific
Bell charges $3.50 for this feature.
Long-Distanca Sarvica: The Stanford telephone system
provides long-distance services. Charges for similar domestic
long-distance calls average 5% to 10% lower than AT&T. (9%
to 14% lower for long-distance calls to locations in California.)
You can access the services of any long-distance company via
a calling card, but charges are substantially higher than with
Stanford since since the charge for each caH is surcharged 45c
to $1 by the long-distance company.
» Activation: $36 compared to Pacific Bell's $37.50 charge.
(Communication Services will not biH those students with Pacific
Bell service who are living on campus during the transition for
activating their Stanford service.)
Primary Advantages of Stanford Telephone Services
Stanford telephone service improves upon Pacific Bell service in several ways, including:
® Actlva Sarvica: Students moving into a campus residence at the beginning of Autumn Quar
ter will automatically have active telephone service in their rooms. Students can immediately
receive calls from, and place calls to, any on or off-campus locations.
o individual Billing: Stanford can biH charges for long-distance dialing directly to the student
who placed the caK. (After dialing a long-distance call, students wiN enter their 7-digit Personal
Access Code (PAC). Students can use their PACs with any campus telephones that aHow
long-distance calling, not just the phones in their rooms.) In addition, Stanford has a conven
ient on-campus location for paying telephone bils.
o SUNat: The student telephone service provides much of the groundwork required for bringing
SUNet services to student residences not yet served by the network. As a direct result of this
project, all student residences have the potential for a SUNet connection in a residence
computer cluster and possibly direct connections in each room. As funding for ex
tending SUNet services is secured, the University wiN offer the service to all student resi
dences. Active SUNet connections in each Manzanita unit, for example, are planned in the faN
of 1990.
» Cost Control: Currently, most students use basic AT&T, MCI, or US Sprint long-distance serv
ices, which make up the largest portion of the average student's telephone biH Since compa
rable Stanford service is less, most students will have lower costs. Stanford is committed to
continuing to offer rates that are tower or comparable to those available from telecommunication
companies.
id' Special Needs in Family Housing
Students in long-term family housing may have different requirements than single students, particu
larly in regards to using a Personal Access Code (PAC) for individual billing. Therefore, students in
Escondido Village and Rains Apartments will have the option of using a PAC or having aN long
distance calls billed directly to their telephone line. (Communication Services wiN evaluate this
option in the coming year as to the feasibility of offering the same choice to all residents in 1991.)
/issues and Concerns
o> Raducad Cholca: Students wiN no longer be able to select their long-distance carrier. This
elimination of individual choice may affect those students who are using one of the many dis
counted offerings available from long-distance companies. Stanford cannot match all these
special arrangements, however, it is competitive with most of them. For example, based on the
average student calling of 2.5 hours per month, Stanford is priced less than the popular
"Reach Out America* plan from AT&T.
Stanford's international calling rates are identical to those available using basic AT&T service.
Communication Services is working wifi long-distance companies to reduce costs for these calls
and will have international rates that are less than AT&T rates by September.
° Dkactory Listings: Students and spouses living on campus can list their names and telephone
numbers with Ihe Stanford operator for no charge. Listings with the Pacific BeN operator and in
the Palo Alto white pages wiN cost $1.00 per month per listing. Under Pacific Bell's current
residential service, the first name is free; listing for additional roommates costs $7.00 for inser
tion and 50c per month.
® Ufa Una Sarvica: Pacific BeN offers a subsidized low cost telephone service (Universal Lifeline)
for low income individuals and families. Those students who currently have Universal Lifeline
can caN Communication Services to discuss a low-cost plan to eliminate any additional financial
burden created by the change.
/Additional Information
Communication Services will distribute additional information about the change in telephone services
via campus publications and direct mailings. Subscription forms will be available at room/house
meetings this spring. Students can apply for their PAC at that time or anytime during tie summer
and it will be mailed to them in August. Telephone line subscriptions can be submitted In the faN
when room assignments are confirmed.
Students living on campus during Summer Quarter wiN hear in the spring sfcout the timing for the
transition to Stanford service lor their residence.

For most students, Stanford telephone services wiN be less expen
sive than similar services from Pacific BeH. Specifically, this is the
case with the following rates:
® Una Sarvica: $12.95 per month for unlimited local area dialing.
Comparable service from Pacific Bell is $13.25. Communica
tion Services will lower its rate in September 1990.
® Call Waiting: An optional feature for $2.40 per month. Pacific
Bell charges $3.50 for this feature.
Long-Distanca Sarvica: The Stanford telephone system
provides long-distance services. Charges for similar domestic
long-distance calls average 5% to 10% lower than AT&T. (9%
to 14% lower for long-distance calls to locations in California.)
You can access the services of any long-distance company via
a calling card, but charges are substantially higher than with
Stanford since since the charge for each caH is surcharged 45c
to $1 by the long-distance company.
» Activation: $36 compared to Pacific Bell's $37.50 charge.
(Communication Services will not biH those students with Pacific
Bell service who are living on campus during the transition for
activating their Stanford service.)
Primary Advantages of Stanford Telephone Services
Stanford telephone service improves upon Pacific Bell service in several ways, including:
® Actlva Sarvica: Students moving into a campus residence at the beginning of Autumn Quar
ter will automatically have active telephone service in their rooms. Students can immediately
receive calls from, and place calls to, any on or off-campus locations.
o individual Billing: Stanford can biH charges for long-distance dialing directly to the student
who placed the caK. (After dialing a long-distance call, students wiN enter their 7-digit Personal
Access Code (PAC). Students can use their PACs with any campus telephones that aHow
long-distance calling, not just the phones in their rooms.) In addition, Stanford has a conven
ient on-campus location for paying telephone bils.
o SUNat: The student telephone service provides much of the groundwork required for bringing
SUNet services to student residences not yet served by the network. As a direct result of this
project, all student residences have the potential for a SUNet connection in a residence
computer cluster and possibly direct connections in each room. As funding for ex
tending SUNet services is secured, the University wiN offer the service to all student resi
dences. Active SUNet connections in each Manzanita unit, for example, are planned in the faN
of 1990.
» Cost Control: Currently, most students use basic AT&T, MCI, or US Sprint long-distance serv
ices, which make up the largest portion of the average student's telephone biH Since compa
rable Stanford service is less, most students will have lower costs. Stanford is committed to
continuing to offer rates that are tower or comparable to those available from telecommunication
companies.
id' Special Needs in Family Housing
Students in long-term family housing may have different requirements than single students, particu
larly in regards to using a Personal Access Code (PAC) for individual billing. Therefore, students in
Escondido Village and Rains Apartments will have the option of using a PAC or having aN long
distance calls billed directly to their telephone line. (Communication Services wiN evaluate this
option in the coming year as to the feasibility of offering the same choice to all residents in 1991.)
/issues and Concerns
o> Raducad Cholca: Students wiN no longer be able to select their long-distance carrier. This
elimination of individual choice may affect those students who are using one of the many dis
counted offerings available from long-distance companies. Stanford cannot match all these
special arrangements, however, it is competitive with most of them. For example, based on the
average student calling of 2.5 hours per month, Stanford is priced less than the popular
"Reach Out America* plan from AT&T.
Stanford's international calling rates are identical to those available using basic AT&T service.
Communication Services is working wifi long-distance companies to reduce costs for these calls
and will have international rates that are less than AT&T rates by September.
° Dkactory Listings: Students and spouses living on campus can list their names and telephone
numbers with Ihe Stanford operator for no charge. Listings with the Pacific BeN operator and in
the Palo Alto white pages wiN cost $1.00 per month per listing. Under Pacific Bell's current
residential service, the first name is free; listing for additional roommates costs $7.00 for inser
tion and 50c per month.
® Ufa Una Sarvica: Pacific BeN offers a subsidized low cost telephone service (Universal Lifeline)
for low income individuals and families. Those students who currently have Universal Lifeline
can caN Communication Services to discuss a low-cost plan to eliminate any additional financial
burden created by the change.
/Additional Information
Communication Services will distribute additional information about the change in telephone services
via campus publications and direct mailings. Subscription forms will be available at room/house
meetings this spring. Students can apply for their PAC at that time or anytime during tie summer
and it will be mailed to them in August. Telephone line subscriptions can be submitted In the faN
when room assignments are confirmed.
Students living on campus during Summer Quarter wiN hear in the spring sfcout the timing for the
transition to Stanford service lor their residence.
