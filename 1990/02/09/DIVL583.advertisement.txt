"Fundamental teamwork,
extraordinary challenges...
at Digital!'
There is much more to Digital than being one of the world's leading
computer companies. Currently ranked in the top 50 of Fortune 500
companies, our success is largely due to small teams of talented individuals.
Our small-team approach creates immediate on-the-job challenges that
most graduates don't experience for months or even years. Our la rge-scale
operations provide for a multitude of career paths.
Our Western Software Laboratory, located in Palo Alto, California,
is the focal point for UNIX* operating systems workstation devel
opment software for Digital. This group is involved in the develop
ment of enabling system software for highly interactive workstation
applications running in a distributed environment.
This system software includes UNIX operating systems drivers
for displays and multi-media devices, X Window** system servers,
X libraries and toolkits, lower level X clients, multi-media servers
and toolkits, and related tools and debuggers. The group is also
responsible for the packaging and release of the software compo
nents that it develops for integration with base system components.
Ideal candidates will have strong interests and skills in system
software development with a workstation focus. A solid understand
ing of operating systems basics, working knowledge of UNIX oper
ating systems and C for interactive and distributed applications, and
graphics principles is highly desirable. An understanding of X and
audio and video basics would be a strong plus.
We have positions for both BS/MSCS or EE graduates (ideally
with a B/B+ average in Computer Science). U.S. Citizenship or per
manent residency is required.
On-campus interviews are scheduled for Tuesday, February 13.
Please sign up for interview at the Placement Office.
If interview is not convenient, please send your resume to Employ
ment Dept. 0209 STFD, CA, Digital Equipment Corporation,
130 Lytton Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94301.
We are an affirmative action employer.
