# University to cut operating budget by $22 million
## 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
Facing perhaps its most daunting fi
nancial challenge in nearly 100 years of
existence, the University will slash $22
million from its operating budget over
the next 18 months, Provost James Rosse
announced yesterday.
Staff layoffs may be included in the
reduction, but next year's undergraduate
tuition increase will be the lowest in 15
years.
The actions are part of a massive plan
to reduce the University's budget and
streamline its operations. Rosse an
nounced the plan to the Faculty Senate
yesterday, and a memo describing the
plan was delivered to all faculty and staff
members late in the afternoon.

"We must embark upon a significant
effort to restructure and streamline our
operating processes and the services pro
vided to faculty and students," Rosse said.
"Unless we reposition, we face five to 10
years of niggling problems that will force
us into the position of having to restrict
innovation, and our principal goal will
be to balance a budget that will never
come together."
The University is operating on a $2
million budget deficit this year. The total
operating budget is $388 million.
Faculty and teaching positions, finan
cial aid and items with legal obligations
will not be subject to cuts. But staff
positions will be reduced, construction of
the multi-million-dollar Near West
campus will be slowed and some academic

programs and student
services may be affected,
Rosse said.
The cuts are necessary
primarily because a
decline in government
sponsored research has
significantly reduced the
University's income. The
decline has resulted in a
nroiected $7.2 million

deficit for next year — a deficit that
Rosse and his advisers will have to elim
inate before April to turn in a balanced
budget to the Board of Trustees.
The income level will be further limited
by two other decisions budget planners
have made:
• If approved by the Board of Trustees,
next year's undergraduate tuition rate
increase will be held to 5.25 percent, or

the inflation rate plus 1 percent. This
year's increase was 8 percent.
• The indirect cost rate for University
research will be held to 78 percent next
year and into the near future. The rate,
which is the amount the University adds
to research grants to pay for overhead
costs, had been projected to jump to 84
percent by 1992.
Tuition and indirect cost recovery are
the two largest sources of income for the
operating budget.
Financial planners are also preparing
for serious budget strains as the Univer
sity seeks funding for earthquake repairs.
Of the estimated $140 million in repair
costs, only 40 to 55 percent will be covered
by state and federal aid, officials specu
lated.

Centennial mostly untouched
Though the University's $1.1 billion
Centennial Campaign is proceeding ahead
of schedule, the bulk of the funds raised
are for specific projects that are long
term investments, Rosse pointed out.
"We need to view these kinds of con
tributions as investments in the Univer
sity's future. If we spend them on
short-term needs, we jeopardize our long
term financial health," Rosse said.
To achieve the reduction, Rosse will
chair a committee that will set specific
targets across the University and create
task forces that will identify the actual
cuts.
The members of the steering commit
tee will be named within a week, Rosse


Rosse
said. The committee will identify
specific targets for reduction by
March 1, and task forces will be
established throughout the Uni
versity to decide how to meet
those targets.
Recommendations for cuts will
be presented to the trustees in
June, and the entire effort is
slated for completion in Septem
ber 1991.
The going will not be easy.
"Stanford will be a stronger, bet
ter institution when we're all
done," Rosse said. "But I think
we're going to go through a lot
of pain and travail to get there,
and I'm sure we'll make mis
takes."
The focus of the operation will
be on streamlining administrative
operations, increasing efficiency
and eliminating waste in Univer
sity processes. The emphasis on
economy and streamlining will af
fect all units of the University,
Rosse said.
"Discussion with many col
leagues, staff as well as faculty
and students, has revealed a
troublesome level of frustration:
with a decision-making style that
is too slow because it requires too
much consensus, and with a cum
bersome administrative struc

ture," Rosse said.
The steering committee and
task forces will work in coopera
tion with the Action Plans for
Change committee, created in Oc
tober to identify areas problems
of management efficiency.
Staff cuts imminent
The brunt of the budget-cut
burden will fall on staff. Rosse
noted that while the faculty has
grown 5.2 percent between 1981
and 1990, staff growth has
reached 23.2 percent. And man
agement of that growth needs to
be tightened, he said.
Stanford has 1,324 faculty
members and 6,415 employees,
excluding those at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
"Because salaries and benefits
comprise about two-thirds of our
budget, a reduction in staff posi
tions will be necessary," Rosse
said. "To minimize hardship to
employees and disruption to the
University, our first step in this
direction will be through attrition
and the elimination of open posi
tions.
"But, at this point, we cannot
eliminate the possibility of
layoffs."
Other areas of the University
with separate budgets, including
the School of Medicine and the
Graduate School of Business, will
be expected to "participate fully
in this effort with their own cost

reduction programs," Rosse said.
The University will also slow
down its building plans, most of
which are in the science and en
gineering area of campus known
as Near West.
John Ford, vice president for
development, told the Faculty
Senate that the Centennial Cam
paign's fundraising target for the
Near West campus has been
reduced from $180 million to $140
million due to lower-than
expected response from donors.
No specific buildings have been
targeted for delayed construction
or elimination.
Academic programs and student
services will have priority in the
search for budget cuts, Rosse said,
but there are no guarantees that
any areas will be left untouched.
Stanford's commitment to creat
ing a pluralistic community will
not be sacrificed, but progress on
the recommendations of the
UCMI report may be slower than
originally expected, he said.
Rosse said the $22 million re
duction should be no surprise to
people familiar with Stanford's
budgeting issues.
Rosse said he was pleased with
the Faculty Senate's "thoughtful"
reception to his plan. Most ques
tions senate members asked at the
meeting revolved around the Uni
versity's commitment to main
taining a competitive indirect cost
rate.
