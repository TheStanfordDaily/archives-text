# University to cut operating budget by $22 million
## 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
Facing perhaps its most daunting fi
nancial challenge in nearly 100 years of
existence, the University will slash $22
million from its operating budget over
the next 18 months, Provost James Rosse
announced yesterday.
Staff layoffs may be included in the
reduction, but next year's undergraduate
tuition increase will be the lowest in 15
years.
The actions are part of a massive plan
to reduce the University's budget and
streamline its operations. Rosse an
nounced the plan to the Faculty Senate
yesterday, and a memo describing the
plan was delivered to all faculty and staff
members late in the afternoon.

"We must embark upon a significant
effort to restructure and streamline our
operating processes and the services pro
vided to faculty and students," Rosse said.
"Unless we reposition, we face five to 10
years of niggling problems that will force
us into the position of having to restrict
innovation, and our principal goal will
be to balance a budget that will never
come together."
The University is operating on a $2
million budget deficit this year. The total
operating budget is $388 million.
Faculty and teaching positions, finan
cial aid and items with legal obligations
will not be subject to cuts. But staff
positions will be reduced, construction of
the multi-million-dollar Near West
campus will be slowed and some academic

programs and student
services may be affected,
Rosse said.
The cuts are necessary
primarily because a
decline in government
sponsored research has
significantly reduced the
University's income. The
decline has resulted in a

deficit for next year — a deficit that
Rosse and his advisers will have to elim
inate before April to turn in a balanced
budget to the Board of Trustees.
The income level will be further limited
by two other decisions budget planners
have made:
• If approved by the Board of Trustees,
next year's undergraduate tuition rate
increase will be held to 5.25 percent, or

the inflation rate plus 1 percent. This
year's increase was 8 percent.
• The indirect cost rate for University
research will be held to 78 percent next
year and into the near future. The rate,
which is the amount the University adds
to research grants to pay for overhead
costs, had been projected to jump to 84
percent by 1992.
Tuition and indirect cost recovery are
the two largest sources of income for the
operating budget.
Financial planners are also preparing
for serious budget strains as the Univer
sity seeks funding for earthquake repairs.
Of the estimated $140 million in repair
costs, only 40 to 55 percent will be covered
by state and federal aid, officials specu
lated.

Centennial mostly untouched
Though the University's $1.1 billion
Centennial Campaign is proceeding ahead
of schedule, the bulk of the funds raised
are for specific projects that are long
term investments, Rosse pointed out.
"We need to view these kinds of con
tributions as investments in the Univer
sity's future. If we spend them on
short-term needs, we jeopardize our long
term financial health," Rosse said.
To achieve the reduction, Rosse will
chair a committee that will set specific
targets across the University and create
task forces that will identify the actual
cuts.
The members of the steering commit
tee will be named within a week, Rosse
