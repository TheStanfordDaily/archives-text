Asbestos levels are OK
The level of asbestos particles in the air of the
Wilbur Hall parking lot "quake modulars" is safe,
according to test results released yesterday.
Only one of five air samples indicated the
presence of asbestos particles. Before the tests,
the University closed the temporary complex for
two weeks after asbestos-containing floor tiles
had been disturbed.
An independent laboratory determined that one
air sample contained 0.0028 asbestos structures
per cubic centimeter, well below levels set by the
Office of Safety and Health Administration and
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
OSHA sets 0.2 fibers per cubic centimeter as
the recommended safety limit. However, the Uni
versity abides by the EPA's more stringent rec
ommendation, 0.01 fibers per cubic centimeter.
The tests results are "wonderful," said Jeffrey
Bramlett, who heads the University's asbestos
program.
The Wilbur complex was constructed to tem
porarily house some faculty members and teach
ing fellows who had to evacuate their offices in
the Quad after the Oct. 17 earthquake.
Since there is no asbestos hazard, construction
of the complex can begin again.
Wayne Poulsen, one of the project managers
with Facilities Project Management, said the Wil
bur modulars are guaranteed to be ready by the
start of spring quarter, but the target date is
March 1.

Cartoon creator comments
"What's up, Doc?"
"Kill the waaaabittt!"
"Habbeebubabeebubabee — happy birthday,
you thing from outer space, you!"
Hundreds of people crammed into Cubberley
Auditorium last night to hear these immortal
words and the man who helped make them pos
sible: Chuck Jones — animator, director and
cultural icon.
Jones espoused his views on comedy, life at
the Warner Studios and, of course, Bugs Bunny,
Daffy Duck, Pepe Le Pew and other characters
he had either created or developed.
Jones' commentary was interspersed between
screenings of 12 classic cartoons that he directed,
among them "What's Opera, Doc?", "One Froggy
Evening," which some film reviewers have called
the best cartoon ever made, and the audience's
favorite, "Duck Dodgers and the 24V2 Century."
With a skill that would shock live-action direc
tors today, Jones and his fellow directors had to
plan an entire short down to the 24th of a second
before the film was even animated. "It was not
so much art as it was survival," Jones said.
The studio's producers — Leon Schlesinger,
and later Edward Selzer — were unwittingly
responsible for some of the best gags in the

cartoons. Once producer Selzer rushed to a room
in which Jones was sitting and shouted, Don t
make a film about bullfights. There's nothing
funny about bullfights!" Aaron Thode
Hoover historian dies
William Warren Bartley, a philosopher and in
tellectual historian at the Hoover Institution,
died of cancer at his home in Oakland on Monday.
He was 55.
Since 1984, Bartley was writing multi-volume
biographies of Karl Popper, the distinguished
philosopher of science, and F.A. Hayek, the 1974
Nobel laureate in economics. He also was editing
Hayek's collected works. At Bartley's urging, Pop
per, now 87, and Hayek, 90, both deposited their
papers in the Hoover Archives.
Alleged flasher bares all
As the result of a surprise confession, Stanford
Police believe they have solved most of the in
decent exposure incidents that have been plaguing
the campus during the past several months.
According to Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, Randolph
Rauch confessed last Tuesday to a police sergeant
that he had exposed himself to people at least
50 times while riding a bicycle on campus.
Several of the victims later positively identified
Rauch from a police lineup. The 32-year-old
Woodside transient has been charged with 16
counts of indecent exposure.
If found guilty, Rauch probably will be ordered
to undergo psychotherapy, "which he wants to
do anyway," Niemeyer said.
Police on Jan. 15 arrested another suspect,
Steven Wilder, for three or four of the exposures.
Police suspect that both Rauch and Wilder are
responsible for campus flashings.
"Because of the descriptions of the incidents,
we feel that these two individuals are responsible
for most of the exposures on campus," Niemeyer
said. However, the suspects have no connection
with the rape attempts or bathroom peepers of
last quarter, he added.

Books donated to libraries
Stanford University Libraries have acquired
the personal archives and book collections of two
Latin American authors and scholars in an at
tempt to establish the University as as a national
resource for the studying and teaching of Latin
American literature.
The acquisition of the personal collections of
Chilean writer and critic Fernando Alegria, pro
fessor emeritus at Stanford, and Mexican-
American poet and critic Luis Leal, professor
emeritus at the University of Illinois, will add
2,800 titles to the current collection of Chicano
and Latin American literature.
