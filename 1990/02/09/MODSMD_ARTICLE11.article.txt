## Dateline 
### 
Albania remains unchanged
TIRANA, Albania (AP) — A leading gov
ernment official said yesterday that Albania
will remain unaffected by democratic reforms
sweeping the Soviet bloc, but welcomes the
superpowers' reduced role in Europe.
"We are continuing along our own road,
which has been very different from that of
the Eastern bloc countries," Deputy Foreign
Minster Socrat Placa told The Associated
Press.
Cease-fire fails
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Hundreds of
Christians fled to the relative safety of Moslem
west Beirut during a lull yesterday in the
deadly war for supremacy between Christian
Gen. Michel Aoun and militia chieftain Samir
Geagea.
Mediators announced an agreement to end
the 10 days of fighting in which hundreds
have died, but Geagea said he would fight 100
years to keep Aoun from turning Lebanon's
Christian enclave into a "banana republic."
More than half a dozen previous cease-fires
have collapsed.
Terrorist apprehended
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — The state-owned
newspaper Al-Akhbar said today that police
arrested one of two terrorists who attacked a
tour bus with machine guns and hand grenades
on Feb. 3 and killed nine Israelis.
Yesterday, the paper said investigators
viewed videotape shot during the ambush. The
tape's owner said it showed the terrorists'
faces.
Al-Akhbar did not identify the arrested man
by name or nationality today nor did it give
attribution for its page one story.
Coal mine explosion
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — An explosion
ripped through a coal mine in northern
Turkey, trapping more than 50 miners inside,
and officials said yesterday that they had cut
off ventilation to the shaft to help extinguish
the blaze because there was no hope of finding
any more survivors.
Two miners survived the Wednesday night
blast in the state-owned Yeniceltik coal mine
in Merzifon, 240 miles northeast of Ankara
near the Black Sea, officials said.
Romanians try democracy
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — The largest
opposition party said yesterday it fears the
outgoing National Salvation Front will put
communist "big game" in the new council that
will run Romania until the May elections.
The new Council of National Unity, which
holds its inaugural meeting today, will give 29
opposition parties the opportunity to partici
pate in government. It will be the first real
opposition role in the government since the
Communist takeover in 1947.
NATO challenges opposition
VIENNA, Austria (AP) - NATO challenged
the Warsaw Pact on yesterday to accept a U.S.
proposal to remove hundreds of thousands of
American and Soviet soldiers from central Eu
rope, setting a regional ceiling of 195,000
troops for each superpower.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
pitching the plan at the 23-nation Conventional
Forces in Europe negotiations, called for a
mutual NATO-Warsaw Pact cap of 4,700 com
bat aircraft for central Europe, plus 500 air
defense interceptors for each side.
President Bush first proposed the reduced
troop levels Jan. 31. It was approved Tuesday
at NATO headquarters in Brussels by a high
level NATO task force.
Kohl facing negative reaction
BONN, West Germany (AP) — Rather than
calming fears of economic collapse in East
Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's advocacy
of one currency for East and West Germany
has created worries about continued prosperity
at home.
Economists and investors have reacted nega
tively to Kohl's proposal for swift introduction
of the West German mark in East Germany,
whose own mark is not convertible. Some ac
cuse him of trying to boost his chances in the
December elections.
Kohl to meet Gorbachev
WEST BERLIN (AP) - Chancellor Helmut
Kohl will tell Soviet President Mikhail S. Gor
bachev this weekend that he need not worry
about Soviet security interests as the Ger
manys move closer to reunification, officials
said yesterday.
Israel to shoot rocks
JERUSALEM (AP) — In its latest effort to
halt rioting in the occupied territories, the
Israeli army has introduced a jeep-mounted
gravel thrower that spews out 600 egg-sized
rocks a minute, Israel radio said yesterday.
The new device is the latest addition to the
army's growing anti-uprising arsenal that also
includes tear gas and various types of rubber,
plastic and metal bullets.
Israel has drawn international criticism for
firing guns at stone-throwers, most of them
children and teen-agers. But army officials con
tend troops only use live ammunition when
their lives are in danger.
