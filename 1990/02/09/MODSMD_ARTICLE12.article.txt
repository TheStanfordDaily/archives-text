# Yeltsin:
## Reforms are not enough 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Communist
maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and progres
sive activists said yesterday the party's
decision to renounce its legal claim on
power is not enough to end Soviet
political repression and centralized
control.
"It is necessary to eliminate
(Communist) party organizations in
the army, the police, the KGB, the
courts, in all the state institutions,"
said Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman for
one would-be opposition party, the
Democratic Union.
Yeltsin was the sole member of the
party's policy-making Central Commit
tee to oppose the political reforms Wed
nesday He said they failed to go far
enough.
"I had grounds to vote against. But
I think, however, that the platform
represents if not a step then a half-step
forward, and that lessens the tension
before the (party) Congress," he said
in an interview in his office near the
Kremlin.
He recommended the formation of
a second party if the Communist Party
fails to excise conservatives at the Con
gress to be held in early summer.
Yeltsin was a keynote speaker at
the largest pro-democracy rally in

decades at the foot of Red Square last
Sunday. Several hundred thousand
people rallied and demanded the party
abandon its guaranteed leading role
in Soviet society.
At the Central Committee meeting
that ended Wednesday, the party did
just that, approving President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's party platform that

calls for revoking the party's constitu
tional guarantee in favor of a multi
party system where Communists
would have to compete for power.
"The discussion was very hot. The
proposals were diametrically opposed.
It was not easy," Yeltsin said, gestur
ing expansively before departing to
take the political temperature among

activists in Leningrad.
Yeltsin said the platform, which has
yet to be made available to the public,
contained outdated language and failed
to endorse radical measures he said
are needed to undo the economic chaos
created by seven decades of central
planning.
