# Baker makes headway in Soviet negotiations

MOSCOW (AP) - The United
States and the Soviet Union made
headway yesterday toward new arms
control agreements, and also consid
ered a joint condemnation of Israel's
resettlement of Jewish immigrants on
the West Bank.
A half-dozen senior U.S. officials
made no mention of the Jewish settlers
in a briefing summing up more than
seven hours of talks between Secretary
of State James A. Baker 111 and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevard
nadze.
However, Gennady I. Gerasimov, the
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman,
said, "It is quite possible that as a
result of the Soviet-American talks a
common viewpoint will be expressed

on this issue, condemning Israel's at
tempt to resettle immigrants on some
one else's occupied territory,"
"There are no differences between
the United States and us on this
issue," he said.
The U.S. officials, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said Baker and
Shevardnadze made progress toward
treaties to curb long-range nuclear
weapons, ground troops, tanks and
combat aircraft in Europe, and to ban
production of chemical weapons.
Both Shevardnadze and Deputy
Foreign Minister Alexander Be
ssmertnykh echoed the positive U.S.
appraisal. "The discussion of the dis
armament problem is proceeding very
well," Shevardnadze told Tass, the So

viet news agency.
Gerasimov called the discussion
"very technical" and said it would keep
U.S. and Soviet experts busy through
the night sorting the proposals out.
Baker offered at least one concession
that would permit the Soviets to ex
clude from a projected ceiling some of
the combat aircraft they contend are
defensive.
The Soviets, meanwhile, dropped
their demand for a provision that
would allow them to scrap a long-range
missile-reduction agreement if they de
termined U.S. antimissile defenses in
space were illegal.
But the U.S. official who reported
the concession acknowledged that the
treaty, which President Bush and So

viet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
intend to sign at their Washington
summit meeting in June, would in
clude a common escape clause. Either
side could abandon the restrictions if
it concluded the treaty did not serve
its national interest.
The separate briefings produced
evidence of discord, too.
Gerasimov said the United States
still flatly refuses to consider reducing
naval forces. And he said the Soviets
would not sign the treaty if a dispute
over sea-launched cruise missiles was
not resolved.
The Bush administration refuses to
accept limitations on the weapons
carried aboard nuclear submarines and
surface ships.
