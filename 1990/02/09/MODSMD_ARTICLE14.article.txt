# Spill cleanup begins

### 
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.
(AP) — Crews worked under spot
lights early yesterday to protect
a wildlife preserve and beaches
from a slick of more than 290,000
gallons of oil spilled from a tanker
that may have gashed itself on
its anchor.
The 811-foot American Trader,
fully loaded with 21 million gal
lons of heavy Alaskan crude, tore
a 3-foot hole in a compartment
Wednesday as it was mooring at
an offshore pipeline terminal lVfc
miles from shore, the Coast Guard
said.
The slick hovered about a mile
from several popular beaches and
an estuary Wednesday morning,
but desert winds yesterday con
densed it from a four-mile-long
plume into a roundish, mile-long
blob and were pushing it away
from shore, officials said.
"It's good, because it's a smaller
area for us to corral," said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Mark Ken
nedy. "But the farther it gets off
shore, the harder it will be to get

it out of the water."
Cleanup crews using oil
containment booms and skimmer
boats were helped today by calm
seas. Lifeguards patrolled the
beaches for signs of oil. Nine oil
fouled birds were found alive on
the beach.
"Those wetlands and wildlife
preserves are so very precious,"
said Dorothy Green, president of
Heal the Bay, a local environmen
tal group.
British Petroleum has assumed
responsibility for the spill and
hired a contractor to join in the
cleanup, which was led by Clean
Coastal Waters, a cooperative
funded by oil companies, the
Coast Guard said.
A diver found a hole in the bot
tom of a forward compartment
that held more than 1 million gal
lons of crude, said Coast Guard
Capt. James Card. No other
damage was found.
The Coast Guard initially re
ported the tanker had struck a
submerged pipeline.
