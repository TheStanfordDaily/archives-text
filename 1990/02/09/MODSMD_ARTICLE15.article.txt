SOWETO, South Africa (AP) - The
Rev. Jesse Jackson told hundreds of
people in this impoverished black
township yesterday that their struggle
to win civil rights from the white-led
government has inspired hope around
the world.
Touring Soweto on the second day of
his visit to South Africa, the black U.S.
civil rights leader walked down streets
of ramshackle squatters' huts, stopped
at a day-care center, visited the home
of African National Congress leader Wal
ter Sisulu and spoke at a meeting of
township teachers.
At the Orlando Home and Creche, a
day-care center for Soweto children,
Jackson took preschool children on his
knee and posed for pictures under a
banner reading, "Welcome Baba Jesse
Jackson ... We love you very, very much."
"Baba," or father, is a term of respect.
Earlier, echoing speeches he made on
the campaign trail during the 1988 pres
idential race, Jackson roared to youths
gathered outside Sisulu's home: "Keep
your head high! Keep hope alive!"

Sisulu had Jackson
for tea at the white
washed stucco house he
returned to in October
after 25 years in prison.
An ANC flag fluttered
on a swaying staff over
the house. Outside, a
crowd of 100 people
sang and chanted.

Jackson, emerging arm in arm with
Sisulu, cheerfully joined in the dancing,
then stood quietly as Sisulu led the sing
ing of "God Rless Africa," the hymn
black nationalists hope will one day be
come South Africa's national anthem.
"You've inspired hope around the
world," Jackson declared. "It's so good
to see you express your will to be free,
and to see you determined to put hope
in your heart and hope in your brains,
and not dope in your veins."
"Right here in Soweto, every morning
now, you're teaching a potential presi
dent of a new South Africa," Jackson
said to shouts of "Viva!" from the au-
