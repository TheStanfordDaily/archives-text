## The 						price of a conscience 
### 
I'M SICK AND tired of Stanford
spending money on things 1 don't
use: "A" permit lots, office buildings,
labs, bollards and other pointless items.
It's not that I think these things aren't
necessary in some way, I just don't see
why my tuition money should fund them.
I'm sick and tired of Stanford spending
money on people I don't like, too.
Come on, we've all got 'em. Remember
that guy from your freshman dorm? The
completely obnoxious bore whose entire
family must have gone to Stanford? Or
how about that girl down the hall — the
complete airhead who had to have paid
someone to take her SATs.
And then remembt r finding out he was
the first of his family to go here — and
that she was valedictorian and being just
a bit paranoid that i aybe, just maybe,
they deserved to be here more than you
did?
It was a brief, moment to be
sure, but fortunately he, in the 7th week
of the quarter, grunted something about
"buying books, dude," and she called
home because she was all stressed —
over mail ordering the Benneton sweater
or shlepping to the Stanford Shopping
Center to buy it.
Wouldn't it be nice to exclude worthless
people and irrelevant projects from your
Stanford bill?
You could get rid of Mark and Rebecca
and all those other losers you hate. You
could list parking meter attendants,
"Release," and the salary paid to the
Council of Presidents.
Wouldn't that be nice? Sure it would.
But what about all those students and

faculty and staff who benefit from some
of those things even if you don't?
Say what?
Isn't it just a bit selfish of you to simply
pick and choose who benefits from your
money and who doesn't?
Damn. It's my conscience. Get out of
here.
No.
Look, it's my money, I've got the right
to pick and choose where it goes.
I suppose you'll want to do the same
thing when you pay your taxes to the
U.S. government, too?
Well .. .
Get real, you Thirtyscumthing flunky.
I'm not going to stand here and talk
to myself this way.
You're the kind of cretin who takes
back his entire ASSU refund without a
second thought.
That's not true. I did give it a thought.
For a second.
And?
Hey, 20 bucks is 20 bucks.
That's what I thought you'd say.
Hey, they wouldn't really offer it if it
killed off student groups, right? I mean,
you'd have to be really stupid to offer
money to students and honestly think
they wouldn't take it.
You're dealing with the ASSU, remem
ber?
Hmm. Oh yeah. Never mind.
Any other excuses?
Er, I'm just one guy taking a measly
couple of pennies back from each group?
Sorry. You're one of many guys, and
you're greedy. Keep in mind that you're
also a student — and that this is a Uni

versity . . .
I think I got briefed on this part as a
pro-fro.
Let me finish.
Sorry.
And this is a University with a whole
bunch of other students who want to get
something out of $60-some-odd-thousand
they're forking over. You may think the
Band or the Black Student Union stink,
but there are people who benefit a lot
from these organizations. Who are you to
try and prevent them from getting as
much out of Stanford as they want to get?
I'm not trying to prevent anyone from
getting what he wants out of Stanford,
I just don't see any reason I should con
tribute to things I don't agree with or
support.
bub, even if you are a concerned
student activist taking back cash from
groups that genuinely offend you, or
whether you just checked "gimme the
whole wad," isn't even relevant. This Uni
versity's got a commitment and an obli
gation to provide for the development of
its students. As part of this University,
so do you. And the sooner you learn that,
the better. Now I'm kicking your butt out
of here.
Ow.
