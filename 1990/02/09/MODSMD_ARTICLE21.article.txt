## HIV survey results misleading to those at high risk 
### 
The college/university
survey of HIV prevalence may
well be flawed and irresponsible,
as Reuben Granich and Jonathan
Mermin stated in their letter (Daily,
Feb. 7), but for reasons that often get
missed in the general media hype
about AIDS.
The original results from 16,861
anonymous students at 19 colleges and
universities were released last spring
with headlines suggesting that an HIV
infection rate of 1 per 500 students
was yet another gloomy indication that
AIDS was spreading everywhere. In
fact, even cursory examination of the
first student results shows that on
college campuses, as elsewhere, HIV
has not spread much beyond the tradi
tional AIDS risk group categories.
The college survey methodology is
clearly biiased, since it passively sam
ples persons visiting student health

centers, who are 1) generally more
likely to be female or 2) often more
likely to be sick. In the orginal survey,
despite the fact that a majority of
blood samples were from women, only
2 of the 30 HIV positive blood samples
were from women.
If it is conservatively assumed that
both of these women acquired HIV
through heterosexual contact, this
would work out to a rate of heterosex
ual HIV transmission among college
students of 1 per 4,000 or lower.
If the 1 per 500 rate were taken to
be representative of the general U.S.
population, it would imply 500,000
people infected with HIV. This is con
sistent with some estimates, including
mine, but is lower than the latest
estimates from the Centers for Disease
Control (0.7 - I.4.million).
But there are still good reasons to
question any results from such student
surveys.

Because the college survey is appro
priately designed to protect the con
fidentiality of adents, HIV/AIDS risk
group indentifier tnd most other
student characteristics are- not collec
ted. This makes it easy or convenient
to use the results to suggest that all
students are equally at risk for HIV.
Such a conclusion ill-serves those
students currently it. greatest risk of
HIV exposure - gay/bisexual males,
needle-sharing intravenous drug
abusers, past recipients of blood or
blood products, persons from some
African and Caribbean countries â€”
and/or the sexual partners of persons
in any of these risk groups.
Designing the college survey to
collect more student characteristics
would create additional concerns.
If only a handful of HIV positive
students on a few campuses who
suspect or know their own HIV status

decide to either participate or not
participate in the survey (through
avoiding or seeking student health
services) based on their interpretation
of the potential costs and benefits of
the survey, this could have a marked
impact on the numbers that ultimately
get reported.
For these reasons, I think that there
are better ways of tracking HIV preva
lence than with college student blood
surveys.
Developing reasoned and informed
AIDS awareness policies is at least as
difficult on a university campus as
elsewhere in society. Nevertheless,
students should be exposed to a full
diversity of opinion on this subject, as
well as on other subjects with political
content.
