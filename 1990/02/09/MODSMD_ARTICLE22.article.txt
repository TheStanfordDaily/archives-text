About the phone system to be in
stalled in Escondido Village — and at
the risk of disappointing the adminis
tration bashers that abound about the
place — v/hat's the big problem with
it??
I live in family housing in Escondido
and was at the meeting with Commu
nication Services people about it.
Before the meeting happened, several
requested changes had already been
made. At the meeting the staff
promised to look into concerns that
were raised there.
Mike Murray's column in the Feb. 9
Village Express "reporting" on the
phone system neglects to mention
several ways in which Communication

Services has changed the plan to an
swer Escondido concerns. I suggest the
residents read carefully the flyer in
cluded with the Express.
The bellicose, uncocDerative attitude
of most of the crowd v s a disgrace.
They had to be shouted 'own before
the staff could even outline the plan.
Many of the complaints that were
aired had no connection with the
phone system. It seemed that several
students took the opportunity to vent
their spleen about other matters.
I've heard repeatedly "What right
does Stanford have to do this?" and
"Why didn't they ask us first?"
This sort of question is almost too
juvenile to deserve an answer, but
after seeing the attitude of most of the
crowd that night, I have a feeling that
even if Stanford had asked for input
sooner, no consensus could have been
reached. The students would have been

too busy shouting at one another.
I'm free to say what the staff proba
bly wishes they could say: "If you
don't like the system when it's in
stalled, you arc free to go pay higher
rent elsewhere." I his might leave the
quieter majority of us here to at least
treat with common -courtesy and re
spect those who are just trying to do
their jobs.
