# Columnist complains, offers no solutions

Corey Davis learned a lot in kinder
garten. He remembers, in "Tough les
sons learned" (Daily, Feb. 7), that he
was the smartest student in his class.
Rut how does this relate to me or

any other Daily reader?
If he has an important message, a
concise statement of some unrealized
problem that exists today, or (even
better) a suggestion for change, I
would willingly hear it. Complaining,
however, does not affect social reforma
tion.
