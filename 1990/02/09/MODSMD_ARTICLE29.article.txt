# Freshman sweeps ugly man contest
## Fellow students bestow title upon him

Sparked by rivalry between the
freshman and sophomore classes
over the upcoming traditional
Frosh-Soph Jamboree, a group of
freshmen kidnapped sophomore
class president Hank Rosin and
Jamboree chairman Paul Elwood.
The group left Rosin in a disabled
car on a deserted road in the foot
hills near campus. Elwood was
found bound and gagged in a
second-floor room in Encina Hall,
then a freshman men's dorm on
campus.
We can only speculate that El
wood may have been slightly dis
appointed that he wasn't hidden
in Roble Hall, then a freshman
women's dorm, but at least he
didn't have to walk all the way
home from the foothills.

Frank Lloyd Wright, widely
considered the best architect in
American history, called Memorial
Auditorium "a vacuum three
times the size that would be nec
essary" to open a speech he gave
there on the future of American
architecture.
Gee, 1 wonder what he thought
of the simple, yet elegant design
of the lovely Lucie Stern dormitory
complex?

Wilbur Hall freshman Pete
Donnelly received the dubious
honor of being chosen as Stan
ford's "ugliest man." Donnelly
won the title in a charity drive
"beauty contest" held to raise
money for the Red Cross and the
World University Service.
Donnelly received 2,002 votes,
1,700 of which came from Bran
ner Hall. Voting was based on
pictures submitted by the contes
tants. Students paid five cents for
each vote they cast, and could vote
as many times as their spare
change allowed. Donnelly's
nearest competitor earned only
113 votes.
He got 2,002 votes? That must
have been some picture. I mean,
I never look that great in yearbook
photos either, but I'd hope Bran
ner freshmen wouldn't spend 85
bucks just to tell me that.

Plans were being laid
for 'the streak to end
all streaks.'

Stanford University Om
budsperson Lois Amsterdam
declared that "any and all Stan
ford University use of the Indian
symbol should be immediately dis
avowed and permanently
stopped." Amsterdam acted on be
half of a group of Native American
students who petitioned the Uni
versity to stop using the Indian
as its mascot.

The students began working for
the mascot change the previous
year, but only succeeded in con
vincing the University to change
its mascot from a big-nosed
caricature of an Indian to a less
derogatory picture of a chief. The
University adopted the Indian as
its mascot in 1930.
Those students let the school off
easy by not insisting that the
school mascot become the Stan
ford Racists for as many years as
the Stanford teams had played
under the banner of "Indians".

An outbreak of streaking hit
the Stanford campus, with naked
students running through the li
braries, the Quad, and almost all
the other public areas on campus.
One unidentified student admit
ted plans were being laid for "the
streak to end all streaks . . . going
through a Human Sexuality lec
ture."
Sound weird? Well they had to
do something to have fun in the
19705!
