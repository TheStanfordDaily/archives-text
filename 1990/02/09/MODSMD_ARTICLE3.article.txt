# Number of applicants drops again
## Demographic changes and quake contribute to lowest mark in 10 years

Hitting its lowest mark in 10 years,
the number of applications for freshman
admission to Stanford fell 13 percent
this year.
Less than 13,000 high school seniors
applied last fall, dropping 2,000 from
the year before. The decline was "a big
drop," according to Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions Jean Fetter, but it was
"not unexpected" and does not appear
to have damaged the quality of the ap
plicant pool.
Applicants' scores on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test are "very similar to last
year's," she said, which indicates the

decline in quantity does not necessarily
mean a decline in quality. But she em
phasized that SAT scores are only one
factor and quipped, "If we only admitted
students based on SAT scores, I
wouldn't have a job."
Fetter cited demographic changes as
the reason for the decline and
speculated that the Oct. 17 earthquake
may also have influenced some appli
cants.
The total number of high school sen
iors will continue to drop each year
through 1994, she said, leading to a
long-term overall drop in college appli
cations nationwide. This year, even the
number of students taking the SAT

dropped.
Fetter emphasized that applications
are falling at selective universities
throughout the country. Her own infor
mal survey of other colleges showed a
similar dramatic decrease at Duke,
which she said "attracts similar stu
dents" to those Stanford draws.
She also cited a 6 percent decrease
throughout the University of California
system and a 12 percent decrease at
UC-Santa Cruz, which was severely
shaken by the earthquake.
Harvard, which most successfully
competes for Stanford admitees, is down
