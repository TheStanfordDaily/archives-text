# Number of applicants drops again
## Demographic changes and quake contribute to lowest mark in 10 years 
### Dave Bianco 
Hitting its lowest mark in 10 years,
the number of applications for freshman
admission to Stanford fell 13 percent
this year.
Less than 13,000 high school seniors
applied last fall, dropping 2,000 from
the year before. The decline was "a big
drop," according to Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions Jean Fetter, but it was
"not unexpected" and does not appear
to have damaged the quality of the ap
plicant pool.
Applicants' scores on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test are "very similar to last
year's," she said, which indicates the

decline in quantity does not necessarily
mean a decline in quality. But she em
phasized that SAT scores are only one
factor and quipped, "If we only admitted
students based on SAT scores, I
wouldn't have a job."
Fetter cited demographic changes as
the reason for the decline and
speculated that the Oct. 17 earthquake
may also have influenced some appli
cants.
The total number of high school sen
iors will continue to drop each year
through 1994, she said, leading to a
long-term overall drop in college appli
cations nationwide. This year, even the
number of students taking the SAT

dropped.
Fetter emphasized that applications
are falling at selective universities
throughout the country. Her own infor
mal survey of other colleges showed a
similar dramatic decrease at Duke,
which she said "attracts similar stu
dents" to those Stanford draws.
She also cited a 6 percent decrease
throughout the University of California
system and a 12 percent decrease at
UC-Santa Cruz, which was severely
shaken by the earthquake.
Harvard, which most successfully
competes for Stanford admitees, is down
6 percent in applicants this year,
according to Marlyn McGrath-
Lewis, director of admissions for
Harvard and Radcliffe colleges.
McGrath-Lewis estimated that
12,200 students applied this year,
compared to last year's 12,843. In
comparison, Fetter estimated that
Stanford received 12,900 applica
tions this year, as opposed to
14,912 last year.
This means that while Stanford
still receives more freshman ap
plications than Harvard, the gap
has narrowed from more than
2,000 to about 700.
One indication that the earth
quake may have had an influence
is that applications from Califor
nia high school seniors, compared
to those from other regions in the
country, showed the smallest
drop, Fetter said.
"It is hard to dissociate that
from national demographics," she
noted, citing the trend for the gen
eral population of the country to
move south and west — meaning
that there are more high school

seniors in California than in the
past.
Despite the extensive national
coverage of the earthquake, Fet

ter said none of the applications
she has read during the first three
weeks of "reading period" has
mentioned the temblor in any way.

After several years of witnessing a growing applicant pool, Stanford
has seen numbers decline by about 1,000 each year since 1987.
This year's drop doubles that trend.
