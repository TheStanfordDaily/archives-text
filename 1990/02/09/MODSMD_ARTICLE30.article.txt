# Bug reveals extensive knowledge of pharmaceuticals
## 
### Aram Irwin Staff writer 
Welcome to the first week of
Volume 197 of The Stanford Daily
and to the first edition of "Diver
sions," the only section in The
Daily explicitly willing to admit
that you might have better things
to do with your time.
Nevertheless, The Bug remains
the same. As always, send your
pressing questions via electronic
mail to BUG-ME (NOT B.Bug
me) on LOTS at Macbeth, or write

Daily, Storke Publications Build

Dear Bug:
I was taking one of those "purity
tests" when I came across this
question: "Have you ever taken
four or more recreational drugs
within 24 hours?" / wasn't even
aware people really took more
than one drug at a time — what
would happen if I took multiple
drugs?
— Patrick O'Furniture
Golly gee whiz Pat, I would sure
hate to promote a degenerate life
style. Nevertheless, I feel it is
my duty as a social insect to pro
vide you with the information nec
essary to make the wise decision
and avoid all potent and addictive
substances and activites.
Thus, I've compiled this chart
on the effects of some common
drugs, using data collected
through research, interviews, and
(cough) a certain amount of em
pirical knowledge.

Drugs
Alcohol
Cocaine
LSD (Acid)
Amyl
Nitrate
Freon
Fluoro-
Carbon

rantasy When
Used Alone
Alcohol Wow, are you
funny. Damn funny You
can do no wrong You
think it might be fun to
bite your best friend's
date and then temember
doing it later You hope
no one gives you a hard
time about it, though —
you wouldn't want to
have to kick anyone's
ass
You are incredibly excited
and important and you
must tell everyone right
this minute It's OK if they
look irritated because
they think you're great,
especially the women,
who can't take their eyes
off of you.
Standing in a vortex of
swirling colored sound
waves, you realize you
are One With The
Universe Your skull melts
into a flaming jellyfish
swimming through a sea
of hot white noise. You
are pursued throughout
eternity by a pair of
screeching black skies
Aargggh. You've got to
have it Now. Here On
the kitchen floor With
anybody You never
noticed how sexy your
hamsters looked in their
slinky brown outfits.
You're bleeding and raw
and torn as your brain
tumbles naked down a
slope of jagged shards of
volcanic glass But it's
' un

because it's just so
amazingly funny that
you're all stoned Music
and sex were never
better Later you'll eat
everything in the fridge,
even the dog food,
unless you fall asleep
first Neon wallpaper
writhes across the night
»ky.
Huh? What? You lose
track of where your right
leg is. Ah, fuck it. It's
more fun to stare at the
door jamb, which is
currently pressed against
your eyeball You never
knew door jambs could
be so funny.
You can't stop laughing
at your own jokes, and
you don't even have to
say them because
everybody else knows
what you're going to say
and knows what a great
and hilarious guy you
are Sex is amazing
Colors you've never
heard before evaporate
what's left of your sense
of reality You find infinite
beauty in the cracks
between your teeth,
where, of course the
Universe is located You
live a life as a teutonic
knight, then as a floor
lamp
Pulled off the ground by
your bloated,
blood-swollen head, you
grin drunkenly until it
pops Upon landing, you
realize you've lost a few
I Q points
You're giggling and
bleeding and wheezing
and coughing as
thousands of papercuts
appear on your eyeballs
You gasp as your lungs
begin to hemmorhage.
and eventually choke on
your own blood

Liquid ecstasy flows
through your veins as
you settle back into the
sofa to drool awhile
Everything is perfect You
thank God for your
friends as you gleefully
vomit in their desk
drawers and walk out
with their stereos
You no longer find your
situation quite as
humorous. Your skin is
gone, and that's just not
funny, especially when
your lungs are slung over
your shoulders. You'd
like to cough, but you
can't seem to work it
around the vertebra
lodged in your throat
You are totally pumped It
feels like you've taken
your total life's energy
and drained it all into this
moment And you
probably have You try to
run around the room on
the walls, hoping
centrifugal force will keep
you up. You might die,
later.
You have a blinding
Universal sensory
overload just before you
descend into a 50,000
year guided tour of Hell.
Your brain is permanently
damaged but it makes no
difference because you'll
die before you ever figure
it out anyway
Immediate coma, lasting
about six months, then
death At about four
months you regain just
enough consciousness
to retain the brief
impression of a weed
eater working its way
through your cerebral
cortex

I
You're dizzy with
euphoria. You staple the
back of your hand a few
times to get rid of that
annoying itch. Your
girlfriend suggests
making out but you're
having a hard enough
time keeping your own
tongue in your mouth
You feel the need to
break someone's fingers,
but resist, knowing how
irritating the sound would
be You think about
maybe pulling some hair
out and gluing it back on.
Later, you remember
having done so You've
done a sloppy job
You have to tell everyone
about the total numbness
and bliss you feel but
can't seem to find the
motivation to move your
mouth You have 10,000
dreams about treading
water and wake up with a
gushing nosebleed
The Universe seems to
be suspended in the
middle of a sea of slug
and snail entrails, but
hey, that's just fine —
good,even
You are a drooling,
whining, shrieking
incomprehensible fool for
the first few minutes
before your EEG flatlines,
and loving every second
of it Nobody calls an
ambulance because
they're too happy to see
you go
Complete agony, then
death That's it.

Blood pulsates through
your eyeballs You are
righteously invincible
Except for the goddam
bugs crawling under your
eyelids You want to
make friends with this girl
but she seems perturbed
at your repeated
attempts to spear her
with your cocktail fork
You're fine Really you
are Except for the lead
bars pushing their way
through your lower
intestines. If only you
could stop collapsing.
Why can't people
understand your need to
bench-press them? At
least they could put up
with your violent
mood-swings After all. a
little violence never hurt
anyone.
You need to tell the Nazi
Smurfs who claim to be
your friends to stop
following you and trying
to eat your internal
organs, but you can't talk
because they've already
got your lungs You will
never escape Disney s
fascist battallion
Someone is trying to
prevent you from doing
damage to yourself But
they can't stop you
You're too clever for that
You pick a fight with the
linoleum floor in the
bathroom The floor wins
The veins just under your
skull swell and explode,
leaving a rather unsightly
mess on the rug Unless,
of course, you were
wearing swim goggles

On an impulse, you
decide to eat your lower
lip You give up after
some limited success
and concentrate on
pulling the scissors out of
your foot Giggling, you
realize they look kinda
good there and give up
You pass out and enter
into a shivering, sweating
coma You'll probably be
fine in a few days Later
you regret having shaved
a few years off your
lifespan
You feel a slight tweak in
the base of your skull
and shrivel into a
convulsing little pile
Cardiac fibrillation is
optional But hey. you've
never felt better
You decide to become
One with a sliding glass
door. It doesn t work as
well as you planned
You're hurting and
reeling and no longer
One with the Universe
But you're suffering will
end soon, when you stop
breathing
You're feverish then
hallucinating then dead
You feel really sick. Then
sicker Then you die

You can't concentrate
enough to remember
from one strained
heartbeat to the next You
phone your grandmother
and demand more glue
It feels good denying
your brain oxygen
You're not sure how you
got on the bus but you
see no reason why you
shouldn't masturbate
right now You are Conan
the Barbarian and you
have the right to do
whatever you want. The
other passengers
disapprove, and try to
rape you with their
tentacles.
Where did those bastard
friends of yours hide your
glue 9 It must be in the
room You chew almost
through the hardwood
floor before you're out of
teeth. You roll over and
choke to death on your
own tongue
You briefly entertain
thoughts of beating
yourself to death before
you die anyway
Death.
Death.
