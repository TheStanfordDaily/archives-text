# A 						Message From Stanford Provost Rosse About Budget Reductions and Streamlining
## 
### 
To The Stanford Community:
In the Faculty Senate yesterday, I
announced a major initiative to
redesign the ways in which we
provide support services to faculty
and students and to confront
significant budget problems. Just
as we are looking at this
Centennial period as a time in the
academic area to reexamine
ourselves and set a course
appropriate for our future, we
must take the same measures on
the nonacademic side.
While many of the factors to which
we must respond have their roots
outside the University, Stanford's
long-standing determination to
provide an environment within
which outstanding faculty and
students can do their best work is
the fundamental motivation for
this initiative. The goals of this
effort are to streamline
administrative and other support
services, to enhance their quality,
to reduce the cost of doing
business, and to make the Stanford
community increasingly inclusive
and engaged in a common pursuit.
I have no doubt that our
individual and collective abilities
are a match for this challenge.
The following statement discusses
the reasons behind this initiative
and outlines the elements in the
effort and the approach. I want
each of you to to consider it the
first installment of a dialogue
leading to actions that, in these
challenging times, will keep
Stanford strong, effective, and
vigorous.
Sincerely,
James N. Rosse
Vice President and Provost

Statement By
Provost James N. Rosse
To The Faculty Senate
Thursday, February 8,1990
Today 1 am announcing some important
steps to reduce Stanford's budget and to
restructure and streamline its
administrative operations.
This is not an isolated action. Rather,
today's announcement is one of a series of
efforts we must make to reshape and
refocus Stanford and its goals as we move
toward our second century. In recent
months, a committee under Bob Street's
leadership, Action Plans for Change, has
been evaluating our processes and our
organization. That work will continue, as
will our reform of the process by which
we develop the institution's budget—also
an effort that has been underway for some
time. In his April appearance to the
Academic Council, President Kennedy
will present a vision of our hopes for the
University, which will be an important
element in this process.
Right now, however, we must
acknowledge and begin a major response
to some fundamental changes in our
operating environment. The principal
changes are fourfold:
• First, there is deep concern on the part
of principal investigators that increases in
Stanford's indirect cost rate, however
justified, are limiting their research
opportunities and making their programs
less competitive.
• Second, there is substantial public
resistance to the cost of higher education,
especially at the highly selective private
institutions; and we are also reluctant to
limit access to a Stanford education — we
want to be sure that Stanford remains
affordable. Thus, there are strong
constraints on tuition and room and board
increases.
• Third, there is a major set of capital
budget problems that we owe to the recent
earthquake.
• As a consequence, and because of lower
than expected government research and
volume, the Operating Budget now faces
a larger than anticipated deficit for the
current year. The projection of the deficit
for next year is $7.2 million, and in our
best forecast of future years, significant
budget problems persist.
Taken one at a time none of these
factors—with the notable exception of the
earthquake—is new or surprising. Taken
together, these financial constraints argue
compellingly for strong budget measures.
There are equally compelling reasons for
carrying out these economies so that we
improve the way we do the business of
the University. Discussion with many
colleagues, staff as well as faculty and
students, has revealed a troublesome level
of frustration: with a decision making
style that is too slow because it requires
too much consensus, and with a
cumbersome administrative structure.
What Does The University Need To
Do?
First of all, we need to recreate a sense of
shared purpose and dedication to
Stanford's academic mission. That
challenge will be a central part of the
President's message to the Council in
April. But it is certainly clear to all that
Stanford's central purposes are education
and research, that faculty members —
whatever their particular interests —
stand behind the entire range of its
objectives, and that the administrative
staff is committed to the support of
faculty and students in carrying out those
objectives.
It follows that in responding to the urgent
need for economy and simplification, we
need to conserve the core academic
purposes and programs of the institution.
At the same time, we need to recognize
the critical character of the support roles,
find agreement as to which arc the most
essential, and then make those work as
well as they possibly can.
As we look to the future, Stanford's
continued success depends on our ability
to provide the capacity for innovation
and to achieve a stable financial
environment, one in which program
planning can occur and in which income
and expense are in balance.
To address these challenges and to
position the University for the future, we
must embark upon a significant effort to
restructure and streamline our operating
processes and the services provided to
faculty and students.
How Will The University Proceed?
I see five key elements in this
repositioning effort.
1. Restrain the Rate of Growth of Student
Charges — It will be a critical objective
of this process to slow the rate of growth
of tuition and room and board That
effort begins today with my
announcement of the 1990-91 general
undergraduate tuition and room and board
charges, to be proposed to the Trustees for
their action next week. The rate of
increase in that proposal is 5.25% for
tuition and 6% for room and board. The
combined increase of 5.5% is the lowest
in 15 years.
2. Hold the Indirect Cost Rate at 78% —
To give our faculty who conduct
sponsored research the best opportunity to
compete for shrinking Federal research
dollars, we will hold the indirect cost rate
at 78% in 1990-91 and beyond while
continuing to adhere to the policy of full

recovery of indirect costs. This is
consistent with the recent
recommendation of the Deans'
Subcommittee on Indirect Cost Policy.
Furthermore, it will be our long-term goal
to reduce the rate from 78%.
3. Achieve Expense Reductions in the
Operating Budget — In order to sustain
balanced budgets into the future and
achieve the first two objectives I just
articulated, we must reduce expenses
across the University's Operating Budget.
The emphasis on economy and
streamlining will affect all organizational
units of the University.
The principal focus of those reductions
will be on the non-formula areas of the
budget. Our target will be to reduce those
budget-base expenses in current terms by
$22 million over the next 18 months.
Faculty positions and those budget items
over which we have long-standing policy
or legal obligations (e.g., financial aid and
debt service) will not be subject to the
reduction. The result is that the $22
million must be taken out of a $175
million total. This will be a 13%
reduction. Because salaries and benefits
comprise about two-thirds of our budget,
a reduction in staff positions will be
necessary.
$22 million over 18 months is clearly a
significant reduction for Stanford and will
require us to make difficult decisions. To
minimize hardship to employees and
disruption to the University, our first step
in this direction will be through attrition
and the elimination of open positions.
But, at this point, we cannot eliminate the
possibility of layoffs.
In addition, we expect that the formula
areas (i.e., Medicine, Business, and
Hoover Research) and the auxiliary and
service units of the University will
participate fully in this effort with their
own cost reduction programs. All of the
expense reduction efforts arc critical to
the success of this endeavor and in
particular to reducing the pressure on the
indirect cost rate.
4. Continue to Reform Administrative
Processes — To guide its efforts, the
Action Plans for Change program has
established four principles:
• to simplify organizational structures,
• to simplify administrative processes,
• to create effective client/provider
interactions regarding support services,
• to change the management culture to
make these principles work.
These principles have a long-term validity
and their implementation is essential to
the success of this effort. Although the
work of APC will bring change, it cannot,
of itself, be all of the reform effort. Other
aspects will be carried out within and
across organization boundaries in
conjunction with budget reduction efforts.
5. Slow the Building Program —
Stanford's ambitious building program
must move at a more measured pace so
that it stays within the bounds of our
financial capacity.
What Is The Process The University
Will Follow?
Accomplishing our objectives will require
participation, creativity, and
understanding from every member of the
University community. The President and
I will lead this effort. A Steering
Committee will set specific targets across
units and functions of the University and
manage the process. This will lead to the
creation of task forces within
organizational units and across functions
whose challenge will be to achieve those
targets.
The work of the task forces will be
critical. They must be guided by a spirit
of cooperation, innovation, and
sensitivity—attributes which Stanford
people have in abundance but which will
be particularly important in this effort.
There are several principles that will
guide this process:
• We will have clear and specific targets
and timelines.
• There will be straightforward and
frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of
this effort.
• We aim to have full participation of
faculty, students, and staff in the process.
• Our objectives of achieving a pluralistic
community will be sustained.
• In implementing expense reductions,
our focus will be on making permanent
sustainable change.
Our objective will be to complete the
effort by September 1, 1991. There are
several important interim dates that will
mark our progress:
March 1,1990 — Steering Committee
Appointed and Task Forces Set
April 10,1990 — Board of Trustees
Meeting: Targets Stated and Initial
Proposals Discussed
June 15,1990 — Board of Trustees
Meeting: Recommendations from Task
Forces for Achievement of Targets
September 1,1990 — Begin
Implementation of FY9I
Recommendations and Completion of
Plans for Subsequent Years
In Conclusion
Finally, I think we need to put the steps I
have outlined in their proper perspective.
We are beginning this effort from a
position of considerable overall
strength—not one of weakness. We are
not in trouble as an institution. Rather,
we seek to avoid it in the future. The
streamlining measures we take over the
coming 18 months will not diminish our
quality, slow our momentum, or risk our
This is a paid advertisement

expectations of what we can and ought to
accomplish. Our fundamental
commitment to teaching and research
remains the same. These steps are
forward-looking changes from which we
will emerge leaner and stronger and with
an enhanced capacity to succeed in a
world in which resources are increasingly
limited.
We also need to view this as an effort that
will involve the entire Stanford
community. Everyone will in some way
be affected by these changes. We will be
successful only if we can approach this
effort in the spirit of working together to
strengthen our community, while not
losing our concern for the individual.
These are Stanford values that will help
us through this challenging process.
Our goal is a university that is able to
fulfill its mission by remaining financially
strong and vital through the 1990s and
well into the next century. With the
determination, support, and
encouragement of all concerned this goal
is well within our reach.
Questions and Answers
about Budget Reductions
and Streamlining
What is the main point of the Provost's
announcement?
Wc will be cutting Stanford's operating
budget by $22 million, or 13% of those
budgets for support functions, over the next
18 months. At the same time, wc arc
beginning a major streamlining of the way we
conduct the University's administrative
business. Wc also plan to simplify our
organizational structure.
Why is the University doing this now?
Overall, we are taking these actions in
response to major changes in the
environment in which we operate — a world
in which resources are increasingly limited
and harder to come by.
Specifically, we face large budget deficits
over the next several years unless wc trim
our expenses immediately. For example, if
wc were to take no action, we would incur a
deficit of over $7 million next year. The
repair and building costs resulting from the
October 17th earthquake have also added to
our budget problems.
Equally important, we have decided that we
can no longer rely quite so heavily on yearly
increases in two primary sources of income
— tuition and indirect cost recovery. We
have acted to slow the growth of tuition and
room and board expenses in order to keep a
Stanford education affordable. Wc will also
be holding the indirect cost rate at 78% in
1991 and beyond, with a goal of reducing
the rate over the long term. This rate, which
is charged to faculty members who conduct
government-sponsored research, is
becoming prohibitively high. As a result of
both actions, we will get proportionally less
revenue from these two sources in the
future, requiring us to cut our expenses.
What do you mean by streamlining, and
how does it fit in with these measures?
The way we conduct much of the
University's business has become slow and
cumbersome. These are problems that drive
up our overall expenses. By streamlining
the way we do things and simplifying the
staffing structure, we intend to save money
and improve service. In some cases, this
may mean finding ways to speed up and
become more efficient in our administrative
business — "working smarter." In other
cases, it may mean trimming or dropping
some types of services altogether. At this
point, however, wc don't know the exact
direction this effort will take.
How will this streamlining process be
accomplished?
The process will be led and managed by
President Kennedy and Provost Rosse.
Provost Rosse will chair a steering
committee that will set specific targets
across units and functions of the University.
Task forces within organizational units will
solicit and use faculty, staff, and student
input.
Where will the budget cuts be made?
The cuts will be made from a budget base of
about $175 million, out of our total current
operating budget of $388 million. Because
about two-thirds of this budget base is made
up of staff salaries and benefits, a reduction
in staff positions will be necessary.
We will not cut student financial aid, faculty
positions, and obligatory payments for
University debt, which add up to about $10()
million of the total budget. The remaining
portion of the budget is for self-supporting
units, such as the schools of Medicine and
Business, Hoover Research, and auxiliary
and service units. These areas will develop
their own cost reduction programs.
In addition, wc are also slowing the pace of
our campus building program. Besides the
costs of construction, new buildings also add
upkeep costs to the operating budget.
Slowing the pace will help us check the
growth of the budget.
What is the overall significance of these
actions to the University?
The basic purpose of these actions is to
strengthen Stanford's teaching and research
missions. Our ability to do this is
jeopardized unless wc remain financially
strong over the long term. Wc can't achieve
this without a balanced budget.
We embark on this process from a position
of considerable overall strength as an
institution. The actions, although
significant, will ensure that we stay
financially strong and vital in the years
ahead.

How will these actions affect faculty?
As we undertake the streamlining effort, the
kinds and level of staff services will change.
In some cases this may represent an
improvement, in others it may mean doing
with less administrative support in some
areas.
On the other hand, we will not eliminate any
faculty positions, nor will we reduce the
number of lecturers and teaching assistants.
In addition, by holding the indirect cost rate
at 78%, faculty who compete for
government grants will have a better chance
of success.
How will these actions affect students?
The key, immediate impact is that the
increase in tuition and room and board
expenses next year will be the smallest in 15
years. For the 1990-91 academic year, there
will be a combined increase of 5.5% (5.25%
for tuition and 6% for room and board).
In addition, students will also be affected by
the streamlining of student support and
administrative services. Because we don't
yet know exactly how things will change,
we can't say which services we provide to
students may be trimmed or dropped.
How will these actions affect staff?
We will not know exactly how these actions
will affect staff until the task forces, to be
appointed by March 1, complete their work
in June. We anticipate that staff will be
involved in helping to find solutions for
simplifying administrative processes and
reducing costs. The current number of staff
positions will have to be rcduccd to achicvc
the established financial goals. How this
will be accomplished is yet to be
determined, but managing attrition and
eliminating open positions will be the first
means considered.
Will there be layoffs?
There is a possibility that layoffs will be
necessary as a result of redesigning the way
administrative work gets done and in order
to achieve the budget-cutting goals.
Attrition, elimination of open positions, and
other means will be considered first. Should
layoffs be necessary, the University will
make a concerted effort to assure a fair
process that provides adequate assistance to
those who will be leaving. No specific
contingency plans for layoffs have been
developed at this time.
Will the University impose special
sanctions, such as a hiring freeze, a salary
freeze, salary reductions, or a cut in
benefits?
We are currently considering a range of
options to help us get repositioned for the
future. No specific strategies have been
ruled out at this point. It takes a great deal
of thought and analysis to properly
understand the various possibilities, and no
conclusions have yet been reached. In
addition, whatever measures might be taken
University-wide have to be considered in
light of the task force recommendations. As
soon as any decisions are made that will
affect staff, we will announce them.
How will the changes affect bargaining
unit employees?
Any changes in operations and staffing will
be made in accordance with the contract
covering bargaining unit employees.
What impact will these steps have on
affirmative action and the implementation
of the UCMI (University Committee on
Minority Issues) recommendations?
We anticipate a marked reduction in hiring
in the near term, so some opportunities to
improve diversity at some levels may be
reduced. At the same time, the Provost has
committed Stanford to sustaining our efforts
to achicvc a pluralistic community, and the
redesign of the way administrative work gets
done may allow more opportunities to
advance diversity.
What is the timeline for this process?
We will be establishing a number of task
forces by March 1. They will make specific
recommendations for streamlining and
budget cuts by June. We expect to begin
implementing the recommendations in
September and will complete them by 1991.
Why can't the University's endowment be
used to offset budget cuts?
The endowment, which is invested in stocks,
bonds, real estate, and other investments,
already contributes approximately 12% of
the current operating budget each year. If
we start spending the endowment principal,
as opposed to the money we cam from our
investments, we would soon find ourselves
earning less and less each year. Before too
long, this would require us to make even
more severe budget cuts, which could
threaten the University's future. In addition,
large parts of the endowment arc legally
restricted — that is, contributors specify for
what purpose the funds are to be used.
Why don't we use the contributions from
the successful Centennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the
Centennial Campaign already goes directly
to the University's annual operating budget.
The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as
building projects, equipment, and
endowment funds. We need to view these
kinds of contributions as investments in the
University's future. If we spend them on
short-term needs, we jeopardize our long
term financial health.
How will the University community be kept
informed?
There will be an organized effort to keep
people fully informed and to allow for input
into the process. There will also be special
meetings with supervisors and with
University leaders. Regular updates on the
situation will be provided via employee
mailings and Campus Report.

To The Stanford Community:
In the Faculty Senate yesterday, I
announced a major initiative to
redesign the ways in which we
provide support services to faculty
and students and to confront
significant budget problems. Just
as we are looking at this
Centennial period as a time in the
academic area to reexamine
ourselves and set a course
appropriate for our future, we
must take the same measures on
the nonacademic side.
While many of the factors to which
we must respond have their roots

students can do their best work is
the fundamental motivation for
this initiative. The goals of this

to reduce the cost of doing
business, and to make the Stanford
community increasingly inclusive
and engaged in a common pursuit.
I have no doubt that our
individual and collective abilities

To address these challenges and to

I see five key elements in this
repositioning effort.
1. Restrain the Rate of Growth of Student

of tuition and room and board That
effort begins today with my

expectations of what we can and ought to
accomplish. Our fundamental
commitment to teaching and research
remains the same. These steps are
forward-looking changes from which we
will emerge leaner and stronger and with
an enhanced capacity to succeed in a
world in which resources are increasingly
limited.
We also need to view this as an effort that
will involve the entire Stanford
community. Everyone will in some way
be affected by these changes. We will be
successful only if we can approach this
effort in the spirit of working together to
strengthen our community, while not
losing our concern for the individual.
These are Stanford values that will help
us through this challenging process.
Our goal is a university that is able to
fulfill its mission by remaining financially
strong and vital through the 1990s and
well into the next century. With the
determination, support, and
encouragement of all concerned this goal
is well within our reach.
Questions and Answers
about Budget Reductions
and Streamlining
What is the main point of the Provost's
announcement?
Wc will be cutting Stanford's operating
budget by $22 million, or 13% of those
budgets for support functions, over the next
18 months. At the same time, wc arc
beginning a major streamlining of the way we
conduct the University's administrative
business. Wc also plan to simplify our
organizational structure.
Why is the University doing this now?
Overall, we are taking these actions in
response to major changes in the
environment in which we operate — a world
in which resources are increasingly limited
and harder to come by.
Specifically, we face large budget deficits
over the next several years unless wc trim
our expenses immediately. For example, if
wc were to take no action, we would incur a
deficit of over $7 million next year. The
repair and building costs resulting from the
October 17th earthquake have also added to
our budget problems.
Equally important, we have decided that we
can no longer rely quite so heavily on yearly
increases in two primary sources of income
— tuition and indirect cost recovery. We
have acted to slow the growth of tuition and
room and board expenses in order to keep a
Stanford education affordable. Wc will also
be holding the indirect cost rate at 78% in
1991 and beyond, with a goal of reducing
the rate over the long term. This rate, which
is charged to faculty members who conduct
government-sponsored research, is
becoming prohibitively high. As a result of
both actions, we will get proportionally less
revenue from these two sources in the
future, requiring us to cut our expenses.
What do you mean by streamlining, and
how does it fit in with these measures?
The way we conduct much of the
University's business has become slow and
cumbersome. These are problems that drive
up our overall expenses. By streamlining
the way we do things and simplifying the
staffing structure, we intend to save money
and improve service. In some cases, this
may mean finding ways to speed up and
become more efficient in our administrative
business — "working smarter." In other
cases, it may mean trimming or dropping
some types of services altogether. At this
point, however, wc don't know the exact
direction this effort will take.
How will this streamlining process be
accomplished?
The process will be led and managed by
President Kennedy and Provost Rosse.
Provost Rosse will chair a steering
committee that will set specific targets
across units and functions of the University.
Task forces within organizational units will
solicit and use faculty, staff, and student
input.
Where will the budget cuts be made?
The cuts will be made from a budget base of
about $175 million, out of our total current
operating budget of $388 million. Because
about two-thirds of this budget base is made
up of staff salaries and benefits, a reduction
in staff positions will be necessary.
We will not cut student financial aid, faculty
positions, and obligatory payments for
University debt, which add up to about $10()
million of the total budget. The remaining
portion of the budget is for self-supporting
units, such as the schools of Medicine and
Business, Hoover Research, and auxiliary
and service units. These areas will develop
their own cost reduction programs.
In addition, wc are also slowing the pace of
our campus building program. Besides the
costs of construction, new buildings also add
upkeep costs to the operating budget.
Slowing the pace will help us check the
growth of the budget.
What is the overall significance of these
actions to the University?
The basic purpose of these actions is to
strengthen Stanford's teaching and research
missions. Our ability to do this is
jeopardized unless wc remain financially
strong over the long term. Wc can't achieve
this without a balanced budget.
We embark on this process from a position
of considerable overall strength as an
institution. The actions, although
significant, will ensure that we stay
financially strong and vital in the years
ahead.

How will these actions affect faculty?
As we undertake the streamlining effort, the
kinds and level of staff services will change.
In some cases this may represent an
improvement, in others it may mean doing
with less administrative support in some
areas.
On the other hand, we will not eliminate any
faculty positions, nor will we reduce the
number of lecturers and teaching assistants.
In addition, by holding the indirect cost rate
at 78%, faculty who compete for
government grants will have a better chance
of success.
How will these actions affect students?
The key, immediate impact is that the
increase in tuition and room and board
expenses next year will be the smallest in 15
years. For the 1990-91 academic year, there
will be a combined increase of 5.5% (5.25%
for tuition and 6% for room and board).
In addition, students will also be affected by
the streamlining of student support and
administrative services. Because we don't
yet know exactly how things will change,
we can't say which services we provide to
students may be trimmed or dropped.
How will these actions affect staff?
We will not know exactly how these actions
will affect staff until the task forces, to be
appointed by March 1, complete their work
in June. We anticipate that staff will be
involved in helping to find solutions for
simplifying administrative processes and
reducing costs. The current number of staff
positions will have to be rcduccd to achicvc
the established financial goals. How this
will be accomplished is yet to be
determined, but managing attrition and
eliminating open positions will be the first
means considered.
Will there be layoffs?
There is a possibility that layoffs will be
necessary as a result of redesigning the way
administrative work gets done and in order
to achieve the budget-cutting goals.
Attrition, elimination of open positions, and
other means will be considered first. Should
layoffs be necessary, the University will
make a concerted effort to assure a fair
process that provides adequate assistance to
those who will be leaving. No specific
contingency plans for layoffs have been
developed at this time.
Will the University impose special
sanctions, such as a hiring freeze, a salary
freeze, salary reductions, or a cut in
benefits?
We are currently considering a range of
options to help us get repositioned for the
future. No specific strategies have been
ruled out at this point. It takes a great deal
of thought and analysis to properly
understand the various possibilities, and no
conclusions have yet been reached. In
addition, whatever measures might be taken
University-wide have to be considered in
light of the task force recommendations. As
soon as any decisions are made that will
affect staff, we will announce them.
How will the changes affect bargaining
unit employees?
Any changes in operations and staffing will
be made in accordance with the contract
covering bargaining unit employees.
What impact will these steps have on
affirmative action and the implementation
of the UCMI (University Committee on
Minority Issues) recommendations?
We anticipate a marked reduction in hiring
in the near term, so some opportunities to
improve diversity at some levels may be
reduced. At the same time, the Provost has
committed Stanford to sustaining our efforts
to achicvc a pluralistic community, and the
redesign of the way administrative work gets
done may allow more opportunities to
advance diversity.
What is the timeline for this process?
We will be establishing a number of task
forces by March 1. They will make specific
recommendations for streamlining and
budget cuts by June. We expect to begin
implementing the recommendations in
September and will complete them by 1991.
Why can't the University's endowment be
used to offset budget cuts?
The endowment, which is invested in stocks,
bonds, real estate, and other investments,
already contributes approximately 12% of
the current operating budget each year. If
we start spending the endowment principal,
as opposed to the money we cam from our
investments, we would soon find ourselves
earning less and less each year. Before too
long, this would require us to make even
more severe budget cuts, which could
threaten the University's future. In addition,
large parts of the endowment arc legally
restricted — that is, contributors specify for
what purpose the funds are to be used.
Why don't we use the contributions from
the successful Centennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the
Centennial Campaign already goes directly
to the University's annual operating budget.
The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as
building projects, equipment, and
endowment funds. We need to view these
kinds of contributions as investments in the
University's future. If we spend them on
short-term needs, we jeopardize our long
term financial health.
How will the University community be kept
informed?
There will be an organized effort to keep
people fully informed and to allow for input
into the process. There will also be special
meetings with supervisors and with
University leaders. Regular updates on the
situation will be provided via employee
mailings and Campus Report.

To The Stanford Community:
In the Faculty Senate yesterday, I
announced a major initiative to
redesign the ways in which we
provide support services to faculty
and students and to confront
significant budget problems. Just
as we are looking at this
Centennial period as a time in the
academic area to reexamine
ourselves and set a course
appropriate for our future, we
must take the same measures on
the nonacademic side.
While many of the factors to which
we must respond have their roots
outside the University, Stanford's
long-standing determination to
provide an environment within
which outstanding faculty and
students can do their best work is
the fundamental motivation for
this initiative. The goals of this
effort are to streamline
administrative and other support
services, to enhance their quality,
to reduce the cost of doing
business, and to make the Stanford
community increasingly inclusive
and engaged in a common pursuit.
I have no doubt that our
individual and collective abilities
are a match for this challenge.
The following statement discusses
the reasons behind this initiative
and outlines the elements in the
effort and the approach. I want
each of you to to consider it the
first installment of a dialogue
leading to actions that, in these
challenging times, will keep
Stanford strong, effective, and
vigorous.
Sincerely,
James N. Rosse
Vice President and Provost

Statement By
Provost James N. Rosse
To The Faculty Senate
Thursday, February 8,1990
Today 1 am announcing some important
steps to reduce Stanford's budget and to
restructure and streamline its
administrative operations.
This is not an isolated action. Rather,
today's announcement is one of a series of
efforts we must make to reshape and
refocus Stanford and its goals as we move
toward our second century. In recent
months, a committee under Bob Street's
leadership, Action Plans for Change, has
been evaluating our processes and our
organization. That work will continue, as
will our reform of the process by which
we develop the institution's budget—also
an effort that has been underway for some
time. In his April appearance to the
Academic Council, President Kennedy
will present a vision of our hopes for the
University, which will be an important
element in this process.
Right now, however, we must
acknowledge and begin a major response
to some fundamental changes in our
operating environment. The principal
changes are fourfold:
• First, there is deep concern on the part
of principal investigators that increases in
Stanford's indirect cost rate, however
justified, are limiting their research
opportunities and making their programs
less competitive.
• Second, there is substantial public
resistance to the cost of higher education,
especially at the highly selective private
institutions; and we are also reluctant to
limit access to a Stanford education — we
want to be sure that Stanford remains
affordable. Thus, there are strong
constraints on tuition and room and board
increases.
• Third, there is a major set of capital
budget problems that we owe to the recent
earthquake.
• As a consequence, and because of lower
than expected government research and
volume, the Operating Budget now faces
a larger than anticipated deficit for the
current year. The projection of the deficit
for next year is $7.2 million, and in our
best forecast of future years, significant
budget problems persist.
Taken one at a time none of these
factors—with the notable exception of the
earthquake—is new or surprising. Taken
together, these financial constraints argue
compellingly for strong budget measures.
There are equally compelling reasons for
carrying out these economies so that we
improve the way we do the business of
the University. Discussion with many
colleagues, staff as well as faculty and
students, has revealed a troublesome level
of frustration: with a decision making
style that is too slow because it requires
too much consensus, and with a
cumbersome administrative structure.
What Does The University Need To
Do?
First of all, we need to recreate a sense of
shared purpose and dedication to
Stanford's academic mission. That
challenge will be a central part of the
President's message to the Council in
April. But it is certainly clear to all that
Stanford's central purposes are education
and research, that faculty members —
whatever their particular interests —
stand behind the entire range of its
objectives, and that the administrative
staff is committed to the support of
faculty and students in carrying out those
objectives.
It follows that in responding to the urgent
need for economy and simplification, we
need to conserve the core academic
purposes and programs of the institution.
At the same time, we need to recognize
the critical character of the support roles,
find agreement as to which arc the most
essential, and then make those work as
well as they possibly can.
As we look to the future, Stanford's
continued success depends on our ability
to provide the capacity for innovation
and to achieve a stable financial
environment, one in which program
planning can occur and in which income
and expense are in balance.
To address these challenges and to
position the University for the future, we
must embark upon a significant effort to
restructure and streamline our operating
processes and the services provided to
faculty and students.
How Will The University Proceed?
I see five key elements in this
repositioning effort.
1. Restrain the Rate of Growth of Student
Charges — It will be a critical objective
of this process to slow the rate of growth
of tuition and room and board That
effort begins today with my
announcement of the 1990-91 general
undergraduate tuition and room and board
charges, to be proposed to the Trustees for
their action next week. The rate of
increase in that proposal is 5.25% for
tuition and 6% for room and board. The
combined increase of 5.5% is the lowest
in 15 years.
2. Hold the Indirect Cost Rate at 78% —
To give our faculty who conduct
sponsored research the best opportunity to
compete for shrinking Federal research
dollars, we will hold the indirect cost rate
at 78% in 1990-91 and beyond while
continuing to adhere to the policy of full

recovery of indirect costs. This is
consistent with the recent
recommendation of the Deans'
Subcommittee on Indirect Cost Policy.
Furthermore, it will be our long-term goal
to reduce the rate from 78%.
3. Achieve Expense Reductions in the
Operating Budget — In order to sustain
balanced budgets into the future and
achieve the first two objectives I just
articulated, we must reduce expenses
across the University's Operating Budget.
The emphasis on economy and
streamlining will affect all organizational
units of the University.
The principal focus of those reductions
will be on the non-formula areas of the
budget. Our target will be to reduce those
budget-base expenses in current terms by
$22 million over the next 18 months.
Faculty positions and those budget items
over which we have long-standing policy
or legal obligations (e.g., financial aid and
debt service) will not be subject to the
reduction. The result is that the $22
million must be taken out of a $175
million total. This will be a 13%
reduction. Because salaries and benefits
comprise about two-thirds of our budget,
a reduction in staff positions will be
necessary.
$22 million over 18 months is clearly a
significant reduction for Stanford and will
require us to make difficult decisions. To
minimize hardship to employees and
disruption to the University, our first step
in this direction will be through attrition
and the elimination of open positions.
But, at this point, we cannot eliminate the
possibility of layoffs.
In addition, we expect that the formula
areas (i.e., Medicine, Business, and
Hoover Research) and the auxiliary and
service units of the University will
participate fully in this effort with their
own cost reduction programs. All of the
expense reduction efforts arc critical to
the success of this endeavor and in
particular to reducing the pressure on the
indirect cost rate.
4. Continue to Reform Administrative
Processes — To guide its efforts, the
Action Plans for Change program has
established four principles:
• to simplify organizational structures,
• to simplify administrative processes,
• to create effective client/provider
interactions regarding support services,
• to change the management culture to
make these principles work.
These principles have a long-term validity
and their implementation is essential to
the success of this effort. Although the
work of APC will bring change, it cannot,
of itself, be all of the reform effort. Other
aspects will be carried out within and
across organization boundaries in
conjunction with budget reduction efforts.
5. Slow the Building Program —
Stanford's ambitious building program
must move at a more measured pace so
that it stays within the bounds of our
financial capacity.
What Is The Process The University
Will Follow?
Accomplishing our objectives will require
participation, creativity, and
understanding from every member of the
University community. The President and
I will lead this effort. A Steering
Committee will set specific targets across
units and functions of the University and
manage the process. This will lead to the
creation of task forces within
organizational units and across functions
whose challenge will be to achieve those
targets.
The work of the task forces will be
critical. They must be guided by a spirit
of cooperation, innovation, and
sensitivity—attributes which Stanford
people have in abundance but which will
be particularly important in this effort.
There are several principles that will
guide this process:
• We will have clear and specific targets
and timelines.
• There will be straightforward and
frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of
this effort.
• We aim to have full participation of
faculty, students, and staff in the process.
• Our objectives of achieving a pluralistic
community will be sustained.
• In implementing expense reductions,
our focus will be on making permanent
sustainable change.
Our objective will be to complete the
effort by September 1, 1991. There are
several important interim dates that will
mark our progress:
March 1,1990 — Steering Committee
Appointed and Task Forces Set
April 10,1990 — Board of Trustees
Meeting: Targets Stated and Initial
Proposals Discussed
June 15,1990 — Board of Trustees
Meeting: Recommendations from Task
Forces for Achievement of Targets
September 1,1990 — Begin
Implementation of FY9I
Recommendations and Completion of
Plans for Subsequent Years
In Conclusion
Finally, I think we need to put the steps I
have outlined in their proper perspective.
We are beginning this effort from a
position of considerable overall
strength—not one of weakness. We are
not in trouble as an institution. Rather,
we seek to avoid it in the future. The
streamlining measures we take over the
coming 18 months will not diminish our
quality, slow our momentum, or risk our

expectations of what we can and ought to
accomplish. Our fundamental
commitment to teaching and research
remains the same. These steps are
forward-looking changes from which we
will emerge leaner and stronger and with
an enhanced capacity to succeed in a
world in which resources are increasingly
limited.
We also need to view this as an effort that
will involve the entire Stanford
community. Everyone will in some way
be affected by these changes. We will be
successful only if we can approach this
effort in the spirit of working together to
strengthen our community, while not
losing our concern for the individual.
These are Stanford values that will help
us through this challenging process.
Our goal is a university that is able to
fulfill its mission by remaining financially
strong and vital through the 1990s and
well into the next century. With the
determination, support, and
encouragement of all concerned this goal
is well within our reach.

Stanford strong, effective, and
vigorous.

Statement By
Provost James N. Rosse
To The Faculty Senate
Thursday, February 8,1990
Today 1 am announcing some important
steps to reduce Stanford's budget and to
restructure and streamline its
administrative operations.
This is not an isolated action. Rather,
today's announcement is one of a series of
efforts we must make to reshape and
refocus Stanford and its goals as we move
toward our second century. In recent
months, a committee under Bob Street's
leadership, Action Plans for Change, has
been evaluating our processes and our
organization. That work will continue, as
will our reform of the process by which
we develop the institution's budget—also
an effort that has been underway for some
time. In his April appearance to the
Academic Council, President Kennedy
will present a vision of our hopes for the
University, which will be an important
element in this process.
Right now, however, we must
acknowledge and begin a major response
to some fundamental changes in our
operating environment. The principal
changes are fourfold:
• First, there is deep concern on the part
of principal investigators that increases in
Stanford's indirect cost rate, however
justified, are limiting their research
opportunities and making their programs
less competitive.
• Second, there is substantial public
resistance to the cost of higher education,
especially at the highly selective private
institutions; and we are also reluctant to
limit access to a Stanford education — we
want to be sure that Stanford remains
affordable. Thus, there are strong
constraints on tuition and room and board
increases.
• Third, there is a major set of capital
budget problems that we owe to the recent
earthquake.
• As a consequence, and because of lower
than expected government research and
volume, the Operating Budget now faces
a larger than anticipated deficit for the
current year. The projection of the deficit
for next year is $7.2 million, and in our
best forecast of future years, significant
budget problems persist.
Taken one at a time none of these
factors—with the notable exception of the
earthquake—is new or surprising. Taken
together, these financial constraints argue
compellingly for strong budget measures.
There are equally compelling reasons for
carrying out these economies so that we
improve the way we do the business of
the University. Discussion with many
colleagues, staff as well as faculty and
students, has revealed a troublesome level
of frustration: with a decision making
style that is too slow because it requires
too much consensus, and with a
cumbersome administrative structure.
What Does The University Need To
Do?
First of all, we need to recreate a sense of
shared purpose and dedication to
Stanford's academic mission. That
challenge will be a central part of the
President's message to the Council in
April. But it is certainly clear to all that
Stanford's central purposes are education
and research, that faculty members —
whatever their particular interests —
stand behind the entire range of its
objectives, and that the administrative
staff is committed to the support of
faculty and students in carrying out those
objectives.
It follows that in responding to the urgent
need for economy and simplification, we
need to conserve the core academic
purposes and programs of the institution.
At the same time, we need to recognize
the critical character of the support roles,
find agreement as to which arc the most
essential, and then make those work as
well as they possibly can.
As we look to the future, Stanford's
continued success depends on our ability
to provide the capacity for innovation
and to achieve a stable financial
environment, one in which program
planning can occur and in which income
and expense are in balance.
To address these challenges and to
position the University for the future, we
must embark upon a significant effort to
restructure and streamline our operating
processes and the services provided to
faculty and students.
How Will The University Proceed?
I see five key elements in this
repositioning effort.
1. Restrain the Rate of Growth of Student
Charges — It will be a critical objective
of this process to slow the rate of growth
of tuition and room and board That
effort begins today with my
announcement of the 1990-91 general
undergraduate tuition and room and board
charges, to be proposed to the Trustees for
their action next week. The rate of
increase in that proposal is 5.25% for
tuition and 6% for room and board. The
combined increase of 5.5% is the lowest
in 15 years.
2. Hold the Indirect Cost Rate at 78% —
To give our faculty who conduct
sponsored research the best opportunity to
compete for shrinking Federal research
dollars, we will hold the indirect cost rate
at 78% in 1990-91 and beyond while
continuing to adhere to the policy of full

recovery of indirect costs. This is
consistent with the recent
recommendation of the Deans'
Subcommittee on Indirect Cost Policy.
Furthermore, it will be our long-term goal
to reduce the rate from 78%.
3. Achieve Expense Reductions in the
Operating Budget — In order to sustain
balanced budgets into the future and
achieve the first two objectives I just
articulated, we must reduce expenses
across the University's Operating Budget.
The emphasis on economy and
streamlining will affect all organizational
units of the University.
The principal focus of those reductions
will be on the non-formula areas of the
budget. Our target will be to reduce those
budget-base expenses in current terms by
$22 million over the next 18 months.
Faculty positions and those budget items
over which we have long-standing policy
or legal obligations (e.g., financial aid and
debt service) will not be subject to the
reduction. The result is that the $22
million must be taken out of a $175
million total. This will be a 13%
reduction. Because salaries and benefits
comprise about two-thirds of our budget,
a reduction in staff positions will be
necessary.
$22 million over 18 months is clearly a
significant reduction for Stanford and will
require us to make difficult decisions. To
minimize hardship to employees and
disruption to the University, our first step
in this direction will be through attrition
and the elimination of open positions.
But, at this point, we cannot eliminate the
possibility of layoffs.
In addition, we expect that the formula
areas (i.e., Medicine, Business, and
Hoover Research) and the auxiliary and
service units of the University will
participate fully in this effort with their
own cost reduction programs. All of the
expense reduction efforts arc critical to
the success of this endeavor and in
particular to reducing the pressure on the
indirect cost rate.
4. Continue to Reform Administrative
Processes — To guide its efforts, the
Action Plans for Change program has
established four principles:
• to simplify organizational structures,
• to simplify administrative processes,
• to create effective client/provider
interactions regarding support services,
• to change the management culture to
make these principles work.
These principles have a long-term validity
and their implementation is essential to
the success of this effort. Although the
work of APC will bring change, it cannot,
of itself, be all of the reform effort. Other
aspects will be carried out within and
across organization boundaries in
conjunction with budget reduction efforts.
5. Slow the Building Program —
Stanford's ambitious building program
must move at a more measured pace so
that it stays within the bounds of our
financial capacity.
What Is The Process The University
Will Follow?
Accomplishing our objectives will require
participation, creativity, and
understanding from every member of the
University community. The President and
I will lead this effort. A Steering
Committee will set specific targets across
units and functions of the University and
manage the process. This will lead to the
creation of task forces within
organizational units and across functions
whose challenge will be to achieve those
targets.
The work of the task forces will be
critical. They must be guided by a spirit
of cooperation, innovation, and
sensitivity—attributes which Stanford
people have in abundance but which will
be particularly important in this effort.
There are several principles that will
guide this process:
• We will have clear and specific targets
and timelines.
• There will be straightforward and
frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of
this effort.
• We aim to have full participation of
faculty, students, and staff in the process.
• Our objectives of achieving a pluralistic
community will be sustained.
• In implementing expense reductions,
our focus will be on making permanent
sustainable change.
Our objective will be to complete the
effort by September 1, 1991. There are
several important interim dates that will
mark our progress:
March 1,1990 — Steering Committee
Appointed and Task Forces Set
April 10,1990 — Board of Trustees
Meeting: Targets Stated and Initial
Proposals Discussed
June 15,1990 — Board of Trustees
Meeting: Recommendations from Task
Forces for Achievement of Targets
September 1,1990 — Begin
Implementation of FY9I
Recommendations and Completion of
Plans for Subsequent Years
In Conclusion
Finally, I think we need to put the steps I
have outlined in their proper perspective.
We are beginning this effort from a
position of considerable overall
strength—not one of weakness. We are
not in trouble as an institution. Rather,
we seek to avoid it in the future. The
streamlining measures we take over the
coming 18 months will not diminish our
quality, slow our momentum, or risk our
This is a paid advertisement

expectations of what we can and ought to
accomplish. Our fundamental
commitment to teaching and research
remains the same. These steps are
forward-looking changes from which we
will emerge leaner and stronger and with
an enhanced capacity to succeed in a
world in which resources are increasingly
limited.
We also need to view this as an effort that
will involve the entire Stanford
community. Everyone will in some way
be affected by these changes. We will be
successful only if we can approach this
effort in the spirit of working together to
strengthen our community, while not
losing our concern for the individual.
These are Stanford values that will help
us through this challenging process.
Our goal is a university that is able to
fulfill its mission by remaining financially
strong and vital through the 1990s and
well into the next century. With the
determination, support, and
encouragement of all concerned this goal
is well within our reach.
Questions and Answers
about Budget Reductions
and Streamlining
What is the main point of the Provost's
announcement?
Wc will be cutting Stanford's operating
budget by $22 million, or 13% of those
budgets for support functions, over the next
18 months. At the same time, wc arc
beginning a major streamlining of the way we
conduct the University's administrative
business. Wc also plan to simplify our
organizational structure.
Why is the University doing this now?
Overall, we are taking these actions in
response to major changes in the
environment in which we operate — a world
in which resources are increasingly limited
and harder to come by.
Specifically, we face large budget deficits
over the next several years unless wc trim
our expenses immediately. For example, if
wc were to take no action, we would incur a
deficit of over $7 million next year. The
repair and building costs resulting from the
October 17th earthquake have also added to
our budget problems.
Equally important, we have decided that we
can no longer rely quite so heavily on yearly
increases in two primary sources of income
— tuition and indirect cost recovery. We
have acted to slow the growth of tuition and
room and board expenses in order to keep a
Stanford education affordable. Wc will also
be holding the indirect cost rate at 78% in
1991 and beyond, with a goal of reducing
the rate over the long term. This rate, which
is charged to faculty members who conduct
government-sponsored research, is
becoming prohibitively high. As a result of
both actions, we will get proportionally less
revenue from these two sources in the
future, requiring us to cut our expenses.
What do you mean by streamlining, and
how does it fit in with these measures?
The way we conduct much of the
University's business has become slow and
cumbersome. These are problems that drive
up our overall expenses. By streamlining
the way we do things and simplifying the
staffing structure, we intend to save money
and improve service. In some cases, this
may mean finding ways to speed up and
become more efficient in our administrative
business — "working smarter." In other
cases, it may mean trimming or dropping
some types of services altogether. At this
point, however, wc don't know the exact
direction this effort will take.
How will this streamlining process be
accomplished?
The process will be led and managed by
President Kennedy and Provost Rosse.
Provost Rosse will chair a steering
committee that will set specific targets
across units and functions of the University.
Task forces within organizational units will
solicit and use faculty, staff, and student
input.
Where will the budget cuts be made?
The cuts will be made from a budget base of
about $175 million, out of our total current
operating budget of $388 million. Because
about two-thirds of this budget base is made
up of staff salaries and benefits, a reduction
in staff positions will be necessary.
We will not cut student financial aid, faculty
positions, and obligatory payments for
University debt, which add up to about $10()
million of the total budget. The remaining
portion of the budget is for self-supporting
units, such as the schools of Medicine and
Business, Hoover Research, and auxiliary
and service units. These areas will develop
their own cost reduction programs.
In addition, wc are also slowing the pace of
our campus building program. Besides the
costs of construction, new buildings also add
upkeep costs to the operating budget.
Slowing the pace will help us check the
growth of the budget.
What is the overall significance of these
actions to the University?
The basic purpose of these actions is to
strengthen Stanford's teaching and research
missions. Our ability to do this is
jeopardized unless wc remain financially
strong over the long term. Wc can't achieve
this without a balanced budget.
We embark on this process from a position
of considerable overall strength as an
institution. The actions, although
significant, will ensure that we stay
financially strong and vital in the years
ahead.

How will these actions affect faculty?
As we undertake the streamlining effort, the
kinds and level of staff services will change.
In some cases this may represent an
improvement, in others it may mean doing
with less administrative support in some
areas.
On the other hand, we will not eliminate any
faculty positions, nor will we reduce the
number of lecturers and teaching assistants.
In addition, by holding the indirect cost rate
at 78%, faculty who compete for
government grants will have a better chance
of success.
How will these actions affect students?
The key, immediate impact is that the
increase in tuition and room and board
expenses next year will be the smallest in 15
years. For the 1990-91 academic year, there
will be a combined increase of 5.5% (5.25%
for tuition and 6% for room and board).
In addition, students will also be affected by
the streamlining of student support and
administrative services. Because we don't
yet know exactly how things will change,
we can't say which services we provide to
students may be trimmed or dropped.
How will these actions affect staff?
We will not know exactly how these actions
will affect staff until the task forces, to be
appointed by March 1, complete their work
in June. We anticipate that staff will be
involved in helping to find solutions for
simplifying administrative processes and
reducing costs. The current number of staff
positions will have to be rcduccd to achicvc
the established financial goals. How this
will be accomplished is yet to be
determined, but managing attrition and
eliminating open positions will be the first
means considered.
Will there be layoffs?
There is a possibility that layoffs will be
necessary as a result of redesigning the way
administrative work gets done and in order
to achieve the budget-cutting goals.
Attrition, elimination of open positions, and
other means will be considered first. Should
layoffs be necessary, the University will
make a concerted effort to assure a fair
process that provides adequate assistance to
those who will be leaving. No specific
contingency plans for layoffs have been
developed at this time.
Will the University impose special
sanctions, such as a hiring freeze, a salary
freeze, salary reductions, or a cut in
benefits?
We are currently considering a range of
options to help us get repositioned for the
future. No specific strategies have been
ruled out at this point. It takes a great deal
of thought and analysis to properly
understand the various possibilities, and no
conclusions have yet been reached. In
addition, whatever measures might be taken
University-wide have to be considered in
light of the task force recommendations. As
soon as any decisions are made that will
affect staff, we will announce them.
How will the changes affect bargaining
unit employees?
Any changes in operations and staffing will
be made in accordance with the contract
covering bargaining unit employees.
What impact will these steps have on
affirmative action and the implementation
of the UCMI (University Committee on
Minority Issues) recommendations?
We anticipate a marked reduction in hiring
in the near term, so some opportunities to
improve diversity at some levels may be
reduced. At the same time, the Provost has
committed Stanford to sustaining our efforts
to achicvc a pluralistic community, and the
redesign of the way administrative work gets
done may allow more opportunities to
advance diversity.
What is the timeline for this process?
We will be establishing a number of task
forces by March 1. They will make specific
recommendations for streamlining and
budget cuts by June. We expect to begin
implementing the recommendations in
September and will complete them by 1991.
Why can't the University's endowment be
used to offset budget cuts?
The endowment, which is invested in stocks,
bonds, real estate, and other investments,
already contributes approximately 12% of
the current operating budget each year. If
we start spending the endowment principal,
as opposed to the money we cam from our
investments, we would soon find ourselves
earning less and less each year. Before too
long, this would require us to make even
more severe budget cuts, which could
threaten the University's future. In addition,
large parts of the endowment arc legally
restricted — that is, contributors specify for
what purpose the funds are to be used.
Why don't we use the contributions from
the successful Centennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the
Centennial Campaign already goes directly
to the University's annual operating budget.
The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as
building projects, equipment, and
endowment funds. We need to view these
kinds of contributions as investments in the
University's future. If we spend them on
short-term needs, we jeopardize our long
term financial health.
How will the University community be kept
informed?
There will be an organized effort to keep
people fully informed and to allow for input
into the process. There will also be special
meetings with supervisors and with
University leaders. Regular updates on the
situation will be provided via employee
mailings and Campus Report.

To The Stanford Community:
In the Faculty Senate yesterday, I
announced a major initiative to
redesign the ways in which we
provide support services to faculty
and students and to confront
significant budget problems. Just
as we are looking at this
Centennial period as a time in the
academic area to reexamine
ourselves and set a course
appropriate for our future, we
must take the same measures on
the nonacademic side.
While many of the factors to which
we must respond have their roots
outside the University, Stanford's
long-standing determination to
provide an environment within
which outstanding faculty and
students can do their best work is
the fundamental motivation for
this initiative. The goals of this
effort are to streamline
administrative and other support
services, to enhance their quality,
to reduce the cost of doing
business, and to make the Stanford
community increasingly inclusive
and engaged in a common pursuit.
I have no doubt that our
individual and collective abilities
are a match for this challenge.
The following statement discusses
the reasons behind this initiative
and outlines the elements in the
effort and the approach. I want
each of you to to consider it the
first installment of a dialogue
leading to actions that, in these
challenging times, will keep
Stanford strong, effective, and
vigorous.
Sincerely,
James N. Rosse
Vice President and Provost

To address these challenges and to

How Will The University Proceed?
I see five key elements in this
repositioning effort.
1. Restrain the Rate of Growth of Student

of this process to slow the rate of growth
of tuition and room and board That
effort begins today with my

increase in that proposal is 5.25% for
tuition and 6% for room and board. The
combined increase of 5.5% is the lowest

2. Hold the Indirect Cost Rate at 78% —

at 78% in 1990-91 and beyond while
continuing to adhere to the policy of full

consistent with the recent
recommendation of the Deans'

Furthermore, it will be our long-term goal
to reduce the rate from 78%.
3. Achieve Expense Reductions in the

balanced budgets into the future and
achieve the first two objectives I just

These principles have a long-term validity
and their implementation is essential to
the success of this effort. Although the
work of APC will bring change, it cannot,

aspects will be carried out within and
across organization boundaries in

Stanford's ambitious building program

Questions and Answers
about Budget Reductions
and Streamlining
What is the main point of the Provost's
announcement?
Wc will be cutting Stanford's operating
budget by $22 million, or 13% of those
budgets for support functions, over the next
18 months. At the same time, wc arc
beginning a major streamlining of the way we
conduct the University's administrative
business. Wc also plan to simplify our
organizational structure.
Why is the University doing this now?
Overall, we are taking these actions in
response to major changes in the
environment in which we operate — a world
in which resources are increasingly limited
and harder to come by.
Specifically, we face large budget deficits
over the next several years unless wc trim
our expenses immediately. For example, if
wc were to take no action, we would incur a
deficit of over $7 million next year. The
repair and building costs resulting from the
October 17th earthquake have also added to
our budget problems.
Equally important, we have decided that we
can no longer rely quite so heavily on yearly
increases in two primary sources of income
— tuition and indirect cost recovery. We
have acted to slow the growth of tuition and
room and board expenses in order to keep a
Stanford education affordable. Wc will also
be holding the indirect cost rate at 78% in
1991 and beyond, with a goal of reducing
the rate over the long term. This rate, which
is charged to faculty members who conduct
government-sponsored research, is
becoming prohibitively high. As a result of
both actions, we will get proportionally less
revenue from these two sources in the
future, requiring us to cut our expenses.
What do you mean by streamlining, and
how does it fit in with these measures?
The way we conduct much of the
University's business has become slow and
cumbersome. These are problems that drive
up our overall expenses. By streamlining
the way we do things and simplifying the
staffing structure, we intend to save money
and improve service. In some cases, this
may mean finding ways to speed up and
become more efficient in our administrative
business — "working smarter." In other
cases, it may mean trimming or dropping
some types of services altogether. At this
point, however, wc don't know the exact
direction this effort will take.
How will this streamlining process be
accomplished?
The process will be led and managed by
President Kennedy and Provost Rosse.
Provost Rosse will chair a steering
committee that will set specific targets
across units and functions of the University.
Task forces within organizational units will
solicit and use faculty, staff, and student
input.
Where will the budget cuts be made?
The cuts will be made from a budget base of
about $175 million, out of our total current
operating budget of $388 million. Because
about two-thirds of this budget base is made
up of staff salaries and benefits, a reduction
in staff positions will be necessary.
We will not cut student financial aid, faculty
positions, and obligatory payments for
University debt, which add up to about $10()
million of the total budget. The remaining
portion of the budget is for self-supporting
units, such as the schools of Medicine and
Business, Hoover Research, and auxiliary
and service units. These areas will develop
their own cost reduction programs.
In addition, wc are also slowing the pace of
our campus building program. Besides the
costs of construction, new buildings also add
upkeep costs to the operating budget.
Slowing the pace will help us check the
growth of the budget.
What is the overall significance of these
actions to the University?
The basic purpose of these actions is to
strengthen Stanford's teaching and research
missions. Our ability to do this is
jeopardized unless wc remain financially
strong over the long term. Wc can't achieve
this without a balanced budget.
We embark on this process from a position
of considerable overall strength as an
institution. The actions, although
significant, will ensure that we stay
financially strong and vital in the years
ahead.

How will these actions affect faculty?
As we undertake the streamlining effort, the
kinds and level of staff services will change.
In some cases this may represent an
improvement, in others it may mean doing
with less administrative support in some
areas.
On the other hand, we will not eliminate any
faculty positions, nor will we reduce the
number of lecturers and teaching assistants.
In addition, by holding the indirect cost rate
at 78%, faculty who compete for
government grants will have a better chance
of success.
How will these actions affect students?
The key, immediate impact is that the
increase in tuition and room and board
expenses next year will be the smallest in 15
years. For the 1990-91 academic year, there
will be a combined increase of 5.5% (5.25%
for tuition and 6% for room and board).
In addition, students will also be affected by
the streamlining of student support and
administrative services. Because we don't
yet know exactly how things will change,
we can't say which services we provide to
students may be trimmed or dropped.
How will these actions affect staff?
We will not know exactly how these actions
will affect staff until the task forces, to be
appointed by March 1, complete their work
in June. We anticipate that staff will be
involved in helping to find solutions for
simplifying administrative processes and
reducing costs. The current number of staff
positions will have to be rcduccd to achicvc
the established financial goals. How this
will be accomplished is yet to be
determined, but managing attrition and
eliminating open positions will be the first
means considered.
Will there be layoffs?
There is a possibility that layoffs will be
necessary as a result of redesigning the way
administrative work gets done and in order
to achieve the budget-cutting goals.
Attrition, elimination of open positions, and
other means will be considered first. Should
layoffs be necessary, the University will
make a concerted effort to assure a fair
process that provides adequate assistance to
those who will be leaving. No specific
contingency plans for layoffs have been
developed at this time.
Will the University impose special
sanctions, such as a hiring freeze, a salary
freeze, salary reductions, or a cut in
benefits?
We are currently considering a range of
options to help us get repositioned for the
future. No specific strategies have been
ruled out at this point. It takes a great deal
of thought and analysis to properly
understand the various possibilities, and no
conclusions have yet been reached. In
addition, whatever measures might be taken
University-wide have to be considered in
light of the task force recommendations. As
soon as any decisions are made that will
affect staff, we will announce them.
How will the changes affect bargaining
unit employees?
Any changes in operations and staffing will
be made in accordance with the contract
covering bargaining unit employees.
What impact will these steps have on
affirmative action and the implementation
of the UCMI (University Committee on
Minority Issues) recommendations?
We anticipate a marked reduction in hiring
in the near term, so some opportunities to
improve diversity at some levels may be
reduced. At the same time, the Provost has
committed Stanford to sustaining our efforts
to achicvc a pluralistic community, and the
redesign of the way administrative work gets
done may allow more opportunities to
advance diversity.
What is the timeline for this process?
We will be establishing a number of task
forces by March 1. They will make specific
recommendations for streamlining and
budget cuts by June. We expect to begin
implementing the recommendations in
September and will complete them by 1991.
Why can't the University's endowment be
used to offset budget cuts?
The endowment, which is invested in stocks,
bonds, real estate, and other investments,
already contributes approximately 12% of
the current operating budget each year. If
we start spending the endowment principal,
as opposed to the money we cam from our
investments, we would soon find ourselves
earning less and less each year. Before too
long, this would require us to make even
more severe budget cuts, which could
threaten the University's future. In addition,
large parts of the endowment arc legally
restricted — that is, contributors specify for
what purpose the funds are to be used.
Why don't we use the contributions from
the successful Centennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the
Centennial Campaign already goes directly
to the University's annual operating budget.
The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as
building projects, equipment, and
endowment funds. We need to view these
kinds of contributions as investments in the
University's future. If we spend them on
short-term needs, we jeopardize our long
term financial health.
How will the University community be kept
informed?
There will be an organized effort to keep
people fully informed and to allow for input
into the process. There will also be special
meetings with supervisors and with
University leaders. Regular updates on the
situation will be provided via employee
mailings and Campus Report.

To The Stanford Community:
In the Faculty Senate yesterday, I
announced a major initiative to
redesign the ways in which we
provide support services to faculty
and students and to confront
significant budget problems. Just
as we are looking at this
Centennial period as a time in the
academic area to reexamine
ourselves and set a course
appropriate for our future, we
must take the same measures on
the nonacademic side.
While many of the factors to which
we must respond have their roots
outside the University, Stanford's
long-standing determination to
provide an environment within
which outstanding faculty and
students can do their best work is
the fundamental motivation for
this initiative. The goals of this
effort are to streamline
administrative and other support
services, to enhance their quality,
to reduce the cost of doing
business, and to make the Stanford
community increasingly inclusive
and engaged in a common pursuit.
I have no doubt that our
individual and collective abilities
are a match for this challenge.
The following statement discusses
the reasons behind this initiative
and outlines the elements in the
effort and the approach. I want
each of you to to consider it the
first installment of a dialogue
leading to actions that, in these
challenging times, will keep
Stanford strong, effective, and
vigorous.
Sincerely,
James N. Rosse
Vice President and Provost

Statement By
Provost James N. Rosse
To The Faculty Senate
Thursday, February 8,1990
Today 1 am announcing some important
steps to reduce Stanford's budget and to
restructure and streamline its
administrative operations.
This is not an isolated action. Rather,
today's announcement is one of a series of
efforts we must make to reshape and
refocus Stanford and its goals as we move
toward our second century. In recent
months, a committee under Bob Street's
leadership, Action Plans for Change, has
been evaluating our processes and our
organization. That work will continue, as
will our reform of the process by which
we develop the institution's budget—also
an effort that has been underway for some
time. In his April appearance to the
Academic Council, President Kennedy
will present a vision of our hopes for the
University, which will be an important
element in this process.
Right now, however, we must
acknowledge and begin a major response
to some fundamental changes in our
operating environment. The principal
changes are fourfold:
• First, there is deep concern on the part
of principal investigators that increases in
Stanford's indirect cost rate, however
justified, are limiting their research
opportunities and making their programs
less competitive.
• Second, there is substantial public
resistance to the cost of higher education,
especially at the highly selective private
institutions; and we are also reluctant to
limit access to a Stanford education — we
want to be sure that Stanford remains
affordable. Thus, there are strong
constraints on tuition and room and board
increases.
• Third, there is a major set of capital
budget problems that we owe to the recent
earthquake.
• As a consequence, and because of lower
than expected government research and
volume, the Operating Budget now faces
a larger than anticipated deficit for the
current year. The projection of the deficit
for next year is $7.2 million, and in our
best forecast of future years, significant
budget problems persist.
Taken one at a time none of these
factors—with the notable exception of the
earthquake—is new or surprising. Taken
together, these financial constraints argue
compellingly for strong budget measures.
There are equally compelling reasons for
carrying out these economies so that we
improve the way we do the business of
the University. Discussion with many
colleagues, staff as well as faculty and
students, has revealed a troublesome level
of frustration: with a decision making
style that is too slow because it requires
too much consensus, and with a
cumbersome administrative structure.
What Does The University Need To
Do?
First of all, we need to recreate a sense of
shared purpose and dedication to
Stanford's academic mission. That
challenge will be a central part of the
President's message to the Council in
April. But it is certainly clear to all that
Stanford's central purposes are education
and research, that faculty members —
whatever their particular interests —
stand behind the entire range of its
objectives, and that the administrative
staff is committed to the support of
faculty and students in carrying out those
objectives.
It follows that in responding to the urgent
need for economy and simplification, we
need to conserve the core academic
purposes and programs of the institution.
At the same time, we need to recognize
the critical character of the support roles,
find agreement as to which arc the most
essential, and then make those work as
well as they possibly can.
As we look to the future, Stanford's
continued success depends on our ability
to provide the capacity for innovation
and to achieve a stable financial
environment, one in which program
planning can occur and in which income
and expense are in balance.
To address these challenges and to
position the University for the future, we
must embark upon a significant effort to
restructure and streamline our operating
processes and the services provided to
faculty and students.
How Will The University Proceed?
I see five key elements in this
repositioning effort.
1. Restrain the Rate of Growth of Student
Charges — It will be a critical objective
of this process to slow the rate of growth
of tuition and room and board That
effort begins today with my
announcement of the 1990-91 general
undergraduate tuition and room and board
charges, to be proposed to the Trustees for
their action next week. The rate of
increase in that proposal is 5.25% for
tuition and 6% for room and board. The
combined increase of 5.5% is the lowest
in 15 years.
2. Hold the Indirect Cost Rate at 78% —
To give our faculty who conduct
sponsored research the best opportunity to
compete for shrinking Federal research
dollars, we will hold the indirect cost rate
at 78% in 1990-91 and beyond while
continuing to adhere to the policy of full

recovery of indirect costs. This is
consistent with the recent
recommendation of the Deans'
Subcommittee on Indirect Cost Policy.
Furthermore, it will be our long-term goal
to reduce the rate from 78%.
3. Achieve Expense Reductions in the
Operating Budget — In order to sustain
balanced budgets into the future and
achieve the first two objectives I just
articulated, we must reduce expenses
across the University's Operating Budget.
The emphasis on economy and
streamlining will affect all organizational
units of the University.
The principal focus of those reductions
will be on the non-formula areas of the
budget. Our target will be to reduce those
budget-base expenses in current terms by
$22 million over the next 18 months.
Faculty positions and those budget items
over which we have long-standing policy
or legal obligations (e.g., financial aid and
debt service) will not be subject to the
reduction. The result is that the $22
million must be taken out of a $175
million total. This will be a 13%
reduction. Because salaries and benefits
comprise about two-thirds of our budget,
a reduction in staff positions will be
necessary.
$22 million over 18 months is clearly a
significant reduction for Stanford and will
require us to make difficult decisions. To
minimize hardship to employees and
disruption to the University, our first step
in this direction will be through attrition
and the elimination of open positions.
But, at this point, we cannot eliminate the
possibility of layoffs.
In addition, we expect that the formula
areas (i.e., Medicine, Business, and
Hoover Research) and the auxiliary and
service units of the University will
participate fully in this effort with their
own cost reduction programs. All of the
expense reduction efforts arc critical to
the success of this endeavor and in
particular to reducing the pressure on the
indirect cost rate.
4. Continue to Reform Administrative
Processes — To guide its efforts, the
Action Plans for Change program has
established four principles:
• to simplify organizational structures,
• to simplify administrative processes,
• to create effective client/provider
interactions regarding support services,
• to change the management culture to
make these principles work.
These principles have a long-term validity
and their implementation is essential to
the success of this effort. Although the
work of APC will bring change, it cannot,
of itself, be all of the reform effort. Other
aspects will be carried out within and
across organization boundaries in
conjunction with budget reduction efforts.
5. Slow the Building Program —
Stanford's ambitious building program
must move at a more measured pace so
that it stays within the bounds of our
financial capacity.
What Is The Process The University
Will Follow?
Accomplishing our objectives will require
participation, creativity, and
understanding from every member of the
University community. The President and
I will lead this effort. A Steering
Committee will set specific targets across
units and functions of the University and
manage the process. This will lead to the
creation of task forces within
organizational units and across functions
whose challenge will be to achieve those
targets.
The work of the task forces will be
critical. They must be guided by a spirit
of cooperation, innovation, and
sensitivity—attributes which Stanford
people have in abundance but which will
be particularly important in this effort.
There are several principles that will
guide this process:
• We will have clear and specific targets
and timelines.
• There will be straightforward and
frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of
this effort.
• We aim to have full participation of
faculty, students, and staff in the process.
• Our objectives of achieving a pluralistic
community will be sustained.
• In implementing expense reductions,
our focus will be on making permanent
sustainable change.
Our objective will be to complete the
effort by September 1, 1991. There are
several important interim dates that will
mark our progress:
March 1,1990 — Steering Committee
Appointed and Task Forces Set
April 10,1990 — Board of Trustees
Meeting: Targets Stated and Initial
Proposals Discussed
June 15,1990 — Board of Trustees
Meeting: Recommendations from Task
Forces for Achievement of Targets
September 1,1990 — Begin
Implementation of FY9I
Recommendations and Completion of
Plans for Subsequent Years
In Conclusion
Finally, I think we need to put the steps I
have outlined in their proper perspective.
We are beginning this effort from a
position of considerable overall
strength—not one of weakness. We are
not in trouble as an institution. Rather,
we seek to avoid it in the future. The
streamlining measures we take over the
coming 18 months will not diminish our
quality, slow our momentum, or risk our
This is a paid advertisement

expectations of what we can and ought to
accomplish. Our fundamental
commitment to teaching and research
remains the same. These steps are
forward-looking changes from which we
will emerge leaner and stronger and with
an enhanced capacity to succeed in a
world in which resources are increasingly
limited.
We also need to view this as an effort that
will involve the entire Stanford
community. Everyone will in some way
be affected by these changes. We will be
successful only if we can approach this
effort in the spirit of working together to
strengthen our community, while not
losing our concern for the individual.
These are Stanford values that will help
us through this challenging process.
Our goal is a university that is able to
fulfill its mission by remaining financially
strong and vital through the 1990s and
well into the next century. With the
determination, support, and
encouragement of all concerned this goal
is well within our reach.
Questions and Answers
about Budget Reductions
and Streamlining
What is the main point of the Provost's
announcement?
Wc will be cutting Stanford's operating
budget by $22 million, or 13% of those
budgets for support functions, over the next
18 months. At the same time, wc arc
beginning a major streamlining of the way we
conduct the University's administrative
business. Wc also plan to simplify our
organizational structure.
Why is the University doing this now?
Overall, we are taking these actions in

Right now, however, we must
acknowledge and begin a major response
to some fundamental changes in our
operating environment. The principal
changes are fourfold:
• First, there is deep concern on the part
of principal investigators that increases in
Stanford's indirect cost rate, however
justified, are limiting their research
opportunities and making their programs
less competitive.
• Second, there is substantial public
resistance to the cost of higher education,
especially at the highly selective private
institutions; and we are also reluctant to
limit access to a Stanford education — we
want to be sure that Stanford remains
affordable. Thus, there are strong
constraints on tuition and room and board
increases.
• Third, there is a major set of capital
budget problems that we owe to the recent
earthquake.
• As a consequence, and because of lower
than expected government research and
volume, the Operating Budget now faces
a larger than anticipated deficit for the
current year. The projection of the deficit
for next year is $7.2 million, and in our
best forecast of future years, significant
budget problems persist.
Taken one at a time none of these
factors—with the notable exception of the
earthquake—is new or surprising. Taken
together, these financial constraints argue
compellingly for strong budget measures.
There are equally compelling reasons for
carrying out these economies so that we
improve the way we do the business of
the University. Discussion with many
colleagues, staff as well as faculty and
students, has revealed a troublesome level
of frustration: with a decision making
style that is too slow because it requires
too much consensus, and with a
cumbersome administrative structure.
What Does The University Need To
Do?
First of all, we need to recreate a sense of
shared purpose and dedication to
Stanford's academic mission. That
challenge will be a central part of the
President's message to the Council in
April. But it is certainly clear to all that
Stanford's central purposes are education
and research, that faculty members —
whatever their particular interests —
stand behind the entire range of its
objectives, and that the administrative
staff is committed to the support of
faculty and students in carrying out those
objectives.
It follows that in responding to the urgent
need for economy and simplification, we
need to conserve the core academic
purposes and programs of the institution.
At the same time, we need to recognize
the critical character of the support roles,
find agreement as to which arc the most
essential, and then make those work as
well as they possibly can.
As we look to the future, Stanford's
continued success depends on our ability
to provide the capacity for innovation
and to achieve a stable financial
environment, one in which program
planning can occur and in which income
and expense are in balance.
To address these challenges and to
position the University for the future, we
must embark upon a significant effort to
restructure and streamline our operating
processes and the services provided to
faculty and students.
How Will The University Proceed?
I see five key elements in this
repositioning effort.
1. Restrain the Rate of Growth of Student
Charges — It will be a critical objective
of this process to slow the rate of growth
of tuition and room and board That
effort begins today with my
announcement of the 1990-91 general
undergraduate tuition and room and board
charges, to be proposed to the Trustees for
their action next week. The rate of
increase in that proposal is 5.25% for
tuition and 6% for room and board. The
combined increase of 5.5% is the lowest
in 15 years.
2. Hold the Indirect Cost Rate at 78% —
To give our faculty who conduct
sponsored research the best opportunity to
compete for shrinking Federal research
dollars, we will hold the indirect cost rate
at 78% in 1990-91 and beyond while
continuing to adhere to the policy of full

recovery of indirect costs. This is
consistent with the recent
recommendation of the Deans'
Subcommittee on Indirect Cost Policy.
Furthermore, it will be our long-term goal
to reduce the rate from 78%.
3. Achieve Expense Reductions in the
Operating Budget — In order to sustain
balanced budgets into the future and
achieve the first two objectives I just
articulated, we must reduce expenses
across the University's Operating Budget.
The emphasis on economy and
streamlining will affect all organizational
units of the University.
The principal focus of those reductions
will be on the non-formula areas of the
budget. Our target will be to reduce those
budget-base expenses in current terms by
$22 million over the next 18 months.
Faculty positions and those budget items
over which we have long-standing policy
or legal obligations (e.g., financial aid and
debt service) will not be subject to the
reduction. The result is that the $22
million must be taken out of a $175
million total. This will be a 13%
reduction. Because salaries and benefits
comprise about two-thirds of our budget,
a reduction in staff positions will be
necessary.
$22 million over 18 months is clearly a
significant reduction for Stanford and will
require us to make difficult decisions. To
minimize hardship to employees and
disruption to the University, our first step
in this direction will be through attrition
and the elimination of open positions.
But, at this point, we cannot eliminate the
possibility of layoffs.
In addition, we expect that the formula
areas (i.e., Medicine, Business, and
Hoover Research) and the auxiliary and
service units of the University will
participate fully in this effort with their
own cost reduction programs. All of the
expense reduction efforts arc critical to
the success of this endeavor and in
particular to reducing the pressure on the
indirect cost rate.
4. Continue to Reform Administrative
Processes — To guide its efforts, the
Action Plans for Change program has
established four principles:
• to simplify organizational structures,
• to simplify administrative processes,
• to create effective client/provider
interactions regarding support services,
• to change the management culture to
make these principles work.
These principles have a long-term validity
and their implementation is essential to
the success of this effort. Although the
work of APC will bring change, it cannot,
of itself, be all of the reform effort. Other
aspects will be carried out within and
across organization boundaries in
conjunction with budget reduction efforts.
5. Slow the Building Program —
Stanford's ambitious building program
must move at a more measured pace so
that it stays within the bounds of our
financial capacity.
What Is The Process The University
Will Follow?
Accomplishing our objectives will require
participation, creativity, and
understanding from every member of the
University community. The President and
I will lead this effort. A Steering
Committee will set specific targets across
units and functions of the University and
manage the process. This will lead to the
creation of task forces within
organizational units and across functions
whose challenge will be to achieve those
targets.
The work of the task forces will be
critical. They must be guided by a spirit
of cooperation, innovation, and
sensitivity—attributes which Stanford
people have in abundance but which will
be particularly important in this effort.
There are several principles that will
guide this process:
• We will have clear and specific targets
and timelines.
• There will be straightforward and
frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of
this effort.
• We aim to have full participation of
faculty, students, and staff in the process.
• Our objectives of achieving a pluralistic
community will be sustained.
• In implementing expense reductions,
our focus will be on making permanent
sustainable change.
Our objective will be to complete the
effort by September 1, 1991. There are
several important interim dates that will
mark our progress:
March 1,1990 — Steering Committee
Appointed and Task Forces Set
April 10,1990 — Board of Trustees
Meeting: Targets Stated and Initial
Proposals Discussed
June 15,1990 — Board of Trustees
Meeting: Recommendations from Task
Forces for Achievement of Targets
September 1,1990 — Begin
Implementation of FY9I
Recommendations and Completion of
Plans for Subsequent Years
In Conclusion
Finally, I think we need to put the steps I
have outlined in their proper perspective.
We are beginning this effort from a
position of considerable overall
strength—not one of weakness. We are
not in trouble as an institution. Rather,
we seek to avoid it in the future. The
streamlining measures we take over the
coming 18 months will not diminish our
quality, slow our momentum, or risk our
This is a paid advertisement

expectations of what we can and ought to
accomplish. Our fundamental
commitment to teaching and research
remains the same. These steps are
forward-looking changes from which we
will emerge leaner and stronger and with
an enhanced capacity to succeed in a
world in which resources are increasingly
limited.
We also need to view this as an effort that
will involve the entire Stanford
community. Everyone will in some way
be affected by these changes. We will be
successful only if we can approach this
effort in the spirit of working together to
strengthen our community, while not
losing our concern for the individual.
These are Stanford values that will help
us through this challenging process.
Our goal is a university that is able to
fulfill its mission by remaining financially
strong and vital through the 1990s and
well into the next century. With the
determination, support, and
encouragement of all concerned this goal
is well within our reach.
Questions and Answers
about Budget Reductions
and Streamlining
What is the main point of the Provost's
announcement?
Wc will be cutting Stanford's operating
budget by $22 million, or 13% of those
budgets for support functions, over the next
18 months. At the same time, wc arc
beginning a major streamlining of the way we
conduct the University's administrative
business. Wc also plan to simplify our
organizational structure.
Why is the University doing this now?
Overall, we are taking these actions in
response to major changes in the
environment in which we operate — a world
in which resources are increasingly limited
and harder to come by.
Specifically, we face large budget deficits
over the next several years unless wc trim
our expenses immediately. For example, if
wc were to take no action, we would incur a
deficit of over $7 million next year. The
repair and building costs resulting from the
October 17th earthquake have also added to
our budget problems.
Equally important, we have decided that we
can no longer rely quite so heavily on yearly
increases in two primary sources of income
— tuition and indirect cost recovery. We
have acted to slow the growth of tuition and
room and board expenses in order to keep a
Stanford education affordable. Wc will also
be holding the indirect cost rate at 78% in
1991 and beyond, with a goal of reducing
the rate over the long term. This rate, which
is charged to faculty members who conduct
government-sponsored research, is
becoming prohibitively high. As a result of
both actions, we will get proportionally less
revenue from these two sources in the
future, requiring us to cut our expenses.
What do you mean by streamlining, and
how does it fit in with these measures?
The way we conduct much of the
University's business has become slow and
cumbersome. These are problems that drive
up our overall expenses. By streamlining
the way we do things and simplifying the
staffing structure, we intend to save money
and improve service. In some cases, this
may mean finding ways to speed up and
become more efficient in our administrative
business — "working smarter." In other
cases, it may mean trimming or dropping
some types of services altogether. At this
point, however, wc don't know the exact
direction this effort will take.
How will this streamlining process be
accomplished?
The process will be led and managed by
President Kennedy and Provost Rosse.
Provost Rosse will chair a steering
committee that will set specific targets
across units and functions of the University.
Task forces within organizational units will
solicit and use faculty, staff, and student
input.
Where will the budget cuts be made?
The cuts will be made from a budget base of
about $175 million, out of our total current
operating budget of $388 million. Because
about two-thirds of this budget base is made
up of staff salaries and benefits, a reduction
in staff positions will be necessary.
We will not cut student financial aid, faculty
positions, and obligatory payments for
University debt, which add up to about $10()
million of the total budget. The remaining
portion of the budget is for self-supporting
units, such as the schools of Medicine and
Business, Hoover Research, and auxiliary
and service units. These areas will develop
their own cost reduction programs.
In addition, wc are also slowing the pace of
our campus building program. Besides the
costs of construction, new buildings also add
upkeep costs to the operating budget.
Slowing the pace will help us check the
growth of the budget.
What is the overall significance of these
actions to the University?
The basic purpose of these actions is to
strengthen Stanford's teaching and research
missions. Our ability to do this is
jeopardized unless wc remain financially
strong over the long term. Wc can't achieve
this without a balanced budget.
We embark on this process from a position
of considerable overall strength as an
institution. The actions, although
significant, will ensure that we stay
financially strong and vital in the years
ahead.

How will these actions affect faculty?
As we undertake the streamlining effort, the
kinds and level of staff services will change.
In some cases this may represent an
improvement, in others it may mean doing
with less administrative support in some
areas.
On the other hand, we will not eliminate any
faculty positions, nor will we reduce the
number of lecturers and teaching assistants.
In addition, by holding the indirect cost rate
at 78%, faculty who compete for
government grants will have a better chance
of success.
How will these actions affect students?
The key, immediate impact is that the
increase in tuition and room and board
expenses next year will be the smallest in 15
years. For the 1990-91 academic year, there
will be a combined increase of 5.5% (5.25%
for tuition and 6% for room and board).
In addition, students will also be affected by
the streamlining of student support and
administrative services. Because we don't
yet know exactly how things will change,
we can't say which services we provide to
students may be trimmed or dropped.
How will these actions affect staff?
We will not know exactly how these actions
will affect staff until the task forces, to be
appointed by March 1, complete their work
in June. We anticipate that staff will be
involved in helping to find solutions for
simplifying administrative processes and
reducing costs. The current number of staff
positions will have to be rcduccd to achicvc
the established financial goals. How this
will be accomplished is yet to be
determined, but managing attrition and
eliminating open positions will be the first
means considered.
Will there be layoffs?
There is a possibility that layoffs will be
necessary as a result of redesigning the way
administrative work gets done and in order
to achieve the budget-cutting goals.
Attrition, elimination of open positions, and
other means will be considered first. Should
layoffs be necessary, the University will
make a concerted effort to assure a fair
process that provides adequate assistance to
those who will be leaving. No specific
contingency plans for layoffs have been
developed at this time.
Will the University impose special
sanctions, such as a hiring freeze, a salary
freeze, salary reductions, or a cut in
benefits?
We are currently considering a range of
options to help us get repositioned for the
future. No specific strategies have been
ruled out at this point. It takes a great deal
of thought and analysis to properly
understand the various possibilities, and no
conclusions have yet been reached. In
addition, whatever measures might be taken
University-wide have to be considered in
light of the task force recommendations. As
soon as any decisions are made that will
affect staff, we will announce them.
How will the changes affect bargaining
unit employees?
Any changes in operations and staffing will
be made in accordance with the contract
covering bargaining unit employees.
What impact will these steps have on
affirmative action and the implementation
of the UCMI (University Committee on
Minority Issues) recommendations?
We anticipate a marked reduction in hiring
in the near term, so some opportunities to
improve diversity at some levels may be
reduced. At the same time, the Provost has
committed Stanford to sustaining our efforts
to achicvc a pluralistic community, and the
redesign of the way administrative work gets
done may allow more opportunities to
advance diversity.
What is the timeline for this process?
We will be establishing a number of task
forces by March 1. They will make specific
recommendations for streamlining and
budget cuts by June. We expect to begin
implementing the recommendations in
September and will complete them by 1991.
Why can't the University's endowment be
used to offset budget cuts?
The endowment, which is invested in stocks,
bonds, real estate, and other investments,
already contributes approximately 12% of
the current operating budget each year. If
we start spending the endowment principal,
as opposed to the money we cam from our
investments, we would soon find ourselves
earning less and less each year. Before too
long, this would require us to make even
more severe budget cuts, which could
threaten the University's future. In addition,
large parts of the endowment arc legally
restricted — that is, contributors specify for
what purpose the funds are to be used.
Why don't we use the contributions from
the successful Centennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the
Centennial Campaign already goes directly
to the University's annual operating budget.
The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as
building projects, equipment, and
endowment funds. We need to view these
kinds of contributions as investments in the
University's future. If we spend them on
short-term needs, we jeopardize our long
term financial health.
How will the University community be kept
informed?
There will be an organized effort to keep
people fully informed and to allow for input
into the process. There will also be special
meetings with supervisors and with
University leaders. Regular updates on the
situation will be provided via employee
mailings and Campus Report.

To The Stanford Community:
In the Faculty Senate yesterday, I
announced a major initiative to
redesign the ways in which we
provide support services to faculty
and students and to confront
significant budget problems. Just
as we are looking at this
Centennial period as a time in the
academic area to reexamine
ourselves and set a course
appropriate for our future, we
must take the same measures on
the nonacademic side.
While many of the factors to which
we must respond have their roots
outside the University, Stanford's
long-standing determination to
provide an environment within
which outstanding faculty and
students can do their best work is
the fundamental motivation for
this initiative. The goals of this
effort are to streamline
administrative and other support
services, to enhance their quality,
to reduce the cost of doing
business, and to make the Stanford
community increasingly inclusive
and engaged in a common pursuit.
I have no doubt that our
individual and collective abilities
are a match for this challenge.
The following statement discusses
the reasons behind this initiative
and outlines the elements in the
effort and the approach. I want
each of you to to consider it the
first installment of a dialogue
leading to actions that, in these
challenging times, will keep
Stanford strong, effective, and
vigorous.
Sincerely,
James N. Rosse
Vice President and Provost

Statement By
Provost James N. Rosse
To The Faculty Senate
Thursday, February 8,1990
Today 1 am announcing some important
steps to reduce Stanford's budget and to
restructure and streamline its
administrative operations.
This is not an isolated action. Rather,
today's announcement is one of a series of
efforts we must make to reshape and
refocus Stanford and its goals as we move
toward our second century. In recent
months, a committee under Bob Street's
leadership, Action Plans for Change, has
been evaluating our processes and our
organization. That work will continue, as
will our reform of the process by which
we develop the institution's budget—also
an effort that has been underway for some
time. In his April appearance to the
Academic Council, President Kennedy
will present a vision of our hopes for the
University, which will be an important
element in this process.
Right now, however, we must
acknowledge and begin a major response
to some fundamental changes in our
operating environment. The principal
changes are fourfold:
• First, there is deep concern on the part
of principal investigators that increases in
Stanford's indirect cost rate, however
justified, are limiting their research
opportunities and making their programs
less competitive.
• Second, there is substantial public
resistance to the cost of higher education,
especially at the highly selective private
institutions; and we are also reluctant to
limit access to a Stanford education — we
want to be sure that Stanford remains
affordable. Thus, there are strong
constraints on tuition and room and board
increases.
• Third, there is a major set of capital
budget problems that we owe to the recent
earthquake.
• As a consequence, and because of lower
than expected government research and
volume, the Operating Budget now faces
a larger than anticipated deficit for the
current year. The projection of the deficit
for next year is $7.2 million, and in our
best forecast of future years, significant
budget problems persist.
Taken one at a time none of these
factors—with the notable exception of the
earthquake—is new or surprising. Taken
together, these financial constraints argue
compellingly for strong budget measures.
There are equally compelling reasons for
carrying out these economies so that we
improve the way we do the business of
the University. Discussion with many
colleagues, staff as well as faculty and
students, has revealed a troublesome level
of frustration: with a decision making
style that is too slow because it requires
too much consensus, and with a
cumbersome administrative structure.
What Does The University Need To
Do?
First of all, we need to recreate a sense of
shared purpose and dedication to
Stanford's academic mission. That
challenge will be a central part of the
President's message to the Council in
April. But it is certainly clear to all that
Stanford's central purposes are education
and research, that faculty members —
whatever their particular interests —
stand behind the entire range of its
objectives, and that the administrative
staff is committed to the support of
faculty and students in carrying out those
objectives.
It follows that in responding to the urgent
need for economy and simplification, we
need to conserve the core academic
purposes and programs of the institution.
At the same time, we need to recognize
the critical character of the support roles,
find agreement as to which arc the most
essential, and then make those work as
well as they possibly can.
As we look to the future, Stanford's
continued success depends on our ability
to provide the capacity for innovation
and to achieve a stable financial
environment, one in which program
planning can occur and in which income
and expense are in balance.
To address these challenges and to
position the University for the future, we
must embark upon a significant effort to
restructure and streamline our operating
processes and the services provided to
faculty and students.
How Will The University Proceed?
I see five key elements in this
repositioning effort.
1. Restrain the Rate of Growth of Student
Charges — It will be a critical objective
of this process to slow the rate of growth
of tuition and room and board That
effort begins today with my
announcement of the 1990-91 general
undergraduate tuition and room and board
charges, to be proposed to the Trustees for
their action next week. The rate of
increase in that proposal is 5.25% for
tuition and 6% for room and board. The
combined increase of 5.5% is the lowest
in 15 years.
2. Hold the Indirect Cost Rate at 78% —
To give our faculty who conduct
sponsored research the best opportunity to
compete for shrinking Federal research
dollars, we will hold the indirect cost rate
at 78% in 1990-91 and beyond while
continuing to adhere to the policy of full

recovery of indirect costs. This is
consistent with the recent
recommendation of the Deans'
Subcommittee on Indirect Cost Policy.
Furthermore, it will be our long-term goal
to reduce the rate from 78%.
3. Achieve Expense Reductions in the
Operating Budget — In order to sustain
balanced budgets into the future and
achieve the first two objectives I just
articulated, we must reduce expenses
across the University's Operating Budget.
The emphasis on economy and
streamlining will affect all organizational
units of the University.
The principal focus of those reductions
will be on the non-formula areas of the
budget. Our target will be to reduce those
budget-base expenses in current terms by
$22 million over the next 18 months.
Faculty positions and those budget items
over which we have long-standing policy
or legal obligations (e.g., financial aid and
debt service) will not be subject to the
reduction. The result is that the $22
million must be taken out of a $175
million total. This will be a 13%
reduction. Because salaries and benefits
comprise about two-thirds of our budget,
a reduction in staff positions will be
necessary.
$22 million over 18 months is clearly a
significant reduction for Stanford and will
require us to make difficult decisions. To
minimize hardship to employees and
disruption to the University, our first step
in this direction will be through attrition
and the elimination of open positions.
But, at this point, we cannot eliminate the
possibility of layoffs.
In addition, we expect that the formula
areas (i.e., Medicine, Business, and
Hoover Research) and the auxiliary and
service units of the University will
participate fully in this effort with their
own cost reduction programs. All of the
expense reduction efforts arc critical to
the success of this endeavor and in
particular to reducing the pressure on the
indirect cost rate.
4. Continue to Reform Administrative
Processes — To guide its efforts, the
Action Plans for Change program has
established four principles:
• to simplify organizational structures,
• to simplify administrative processes,
• to create effective client/provider
interactions regarding support services,
• to change the management culture to
make these principles work.
These principles have a long-term validity
and their implementation is essential to
the success of this effort. Although the
work of APC will bring change, it cannot,
of itself, be all of the reform effort. Other
aspects will be carried out within and
across organization boundaries in
conjunction with budget reduction efforts.
5. Slow the Building Program —
Stanford's ambitious building program
must move at a more measured pace so
that it stays within the bounds of our
financial capacity.
What Is The Process The University
Will Follow?
Accomplishing our objectives will require
participation, creativity, and
understanding from every member of the
University community. The President and
I will lead this effort. A Steering
Committee will set specific targets across
units and functions of the University and
manage the process. This will lead to the
creation of task forces within
organizational units and across functions
whose challenge will be to achieve those
targets.
The work of the task forces will be
critical. They must be guided by a spirit
of cooperation, innovation, and
sensitivity—attributes which Stanford
people have in abundance but which will
be particularly important in this effort.
There are several principles that will
guide this process:
• We will have clear and specific targets
and timelines.
• There will be straightforward and
frequent communication to the entire
Stanford community about the progress of
this effort.
• We aim to have full participation of
faculty, students, and staff in the process.
• Our objectives of achieving a pluralistic
community will be sustained.
• In implementing expense reductions,
our focus will be on making permanent
sustainable change.
Our objective will be to complete the
effort by September 1, 1991. There are
several important interim dates that will
mark our progress:
March 1,1990 — Steering Committee

Finally, I think we need to put the steps I
have outlined in their proper perspective.
We are beginning this effort from a
position of considerable overall
strength—not one of weakness. We are
not in trouble as an institution. Rather,
we seek to avoid it in the future. The

future, requiring us to cut our expenses.
What do you mean by streamlining, and
how does it fit in with these measures?
The way we conduct much of the
University's business has become slow and
cumbersome. These are problems that drive
up our overall expenses. By streamlining
the way we do things and simplifying the
staffing structure, we intend to save money
and improve service. In some cases, this
may mean finding ways to speed up and
become more efficient in our administrative
business — "working smarter." In other
cases, it may mean trimming or dropping
some types of services altogether. At this
point, however, wc don't know the exact
direction this effort will take.
How will this streamlining process be
accomplished?
The process will be led and managed by
President Kennedy and Provost Rosse.
Provost Rosse will chair a steering
committee that will set specific targets
across units and functions of the University.
Task forces within organizational units will
solicit and use faculty, staff, and student
input.
Where will the budget cuts be made?
The cuts will be made from a budget base of
about $175 million, out of our total current
operating budget of $388 million. Because
about two-thirds of this budget base is made
up of staff salaries and benefits, a reduction
in staff positions will be necessary.
We will not cut student financial aid, faculty
positions, and obligatory payments for
University debt, which add up to about $10()
million of the total budget. The remaining
portion of the budget is for self-supporting
units, such as the schools of Medicine and
Business, Hoover Research, and auxiliary
and service units. These areas will develop
their own cost reduction programs.
In addition, wc are also slowing the pace of
our campus building program. Besides the
costs of construction, new buildings also add
upkeep costs to the operating budget.
Slowing the pace will help us check the
growth of the budget.
What is the overall significance of these
actions to the University?
The basic purpose of these actions is to
strengthen Stanford's teaching and research
missions. Our ability to do this is
jeopardized unless wc remain financially
strong over the long term. Wc can't achieve
this without a balanced budget.
We embark on this process from a position
of considerable overall strength as an
institution. The actions, although
significant, will ensure that we stay
financially strong and vital in the years
ahead.

How will these actions affect faculty?
As we undertake the streamlining effort, the
kinds and level of staff services will change.
In some cases this may represent an
improvement, in others it may mean doing
with less administrative support in some
areas.
On the other hand, we will not eliminate any
faculty positions, nor will we reduce the
number of lecturers and teaching assistants.
In addition, by holding the indirect cost rate
at 78%, faculty who compete for
government grants will have a better chance
of success.
How will these actions affect students?
The key, immediate impact is that the
increase in tuition and room and board
expenses next year will be the smallest in 15
years. For the 1990-91 academic year, there
will be a combined increase of 5.5% (5.25%
for tuition and 6% for room and board).
In addition, students will also be affected by
the streamlining of student support and
administrative services. Because we don't
yet know exactly how things will change,
we can't say which services we provide to
students may be trimmed or dropped.
How will these actions affect staff?
We will not know exactly how these actions
will affect staff until the task forces, to be
appointed by March 1, complete their work
in June. We anticipate that staff will be
involved in helping to find solutions for
simplifying administrative processes and
reducing costs. The current number of staff
positions will have to be rcduccd to achicvc
the established financial goals. How this
will be accomplished is yet to be
determined, but managing attrition and
eliminating open positions will be the first
means considered.
Will there be layoffs?
There is a possibility that layoffs will be
necessary as a result of redesigning the way
administrative work gets done and in order
to achieve the budget-cutting goals.
Attrition, elimination of open positions, and
other means will be considered first. Should
layoffs be necessary, the University will
make a concerted effort to assure a fair
process that provides adequate assistance to
those who will be leaving. No specific
contingency plans for layoffs have been
developed at this time.
Will the University impose special
sanctions, such as a hiring freeze, a salary
freeze, salary reductions, or a cut in
benefits?
We are currently considering a range of
options to help us get repositioned for the
future. No specific strategies have been
ruled out at this point. It takes a great deal
of thought and analysis to properly
understand the various possibilities, and no
conclusions have yet been reached. In
addition, whatever measures might be taken
University-wide have to be considered in
light of the task force recommendations. As
soon as any decisions are made that will
affect staff, we will announce them.
How will the changes affect bargaining
unit employees?
Any changes in operations and staffing will
be made in accordance with the contract
covering bargaining unit employees.
What impact will these steps have on
affirmative action and the implementation
of the UCMI (University Committee on
Minority Issues) recommendations?
We anticipate a marked reduction in hiring
in the near term, so some opportunities to
improve diversity at some levels may be
reduced. At the same time, the Provost has
committed Stanford to sustaining our efforts
to achicvc a pluralistic community, and the
redesign of the way administrative work gets
done may allow more opportunities to
advance diversity.
What is the timeline for this process?
We will be establishing a number of task
forces by March 1. They will make specific
recommendations for streamlining and
budget cuts by June. We expect to begin
implementing the recommendations in
September and will complete them by 1991.
Why can't the University's endowment be
used to offset budget cuts?
The endowment, which is invested in stocks,
bonds, real estate, and other investments,
already contributes approximately 12% of
the current operating budget each year. If
we start spending the endowment principal,
as opposed to the money we cam from our
investments, we would soon find ourselves
earning less and less each year. Before too
long, this would require us to make even
more severe budget cuts, which could
threaten the University's future. In addition,
large parts of the endowment arc legally
restricted — that is, contributors specify for
what purpose the funds are to be used.
Why don't we use the contributions from
the successful Centennial Campaign?
A portion of the money raised during the
Centennial Campaign already goes directly
to the University's annual operating budget.
The bulk of the contributions, however, is
restricted for specific purposes, such as
building projects, equipment, and
endowment funds. We need to view these
kinds of contributions as investments in the
University's future. If we spend them on
short-term needs, we jeopardize our long
term financial health.
How will the University community be kept
informed?
There will be an organized effort to keep
people fully informed and to allow for input
into the process. There will also be special
meetings with supervisors and with
University leaders. Regular updates on the
situation will be provided via employee
mailings and Campus Report.
