## Card shuts down WSU 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It just wasn't a night for punctuality.
To begin with, there were only about
1000 people in Maples Pavilion just 15
minutes before tipoff of the Cardinal's bas
ketball game with Washington State.

Cardinal 68
Cougars 54

But if the Stanford fans were merely
late, the Cougar offense missed the plane.
In the first 10 minutes, 45 seconds of the
game Washington State had 10 shots, four
balls stolen from them by Adam Keefe, two
more balls stolen by Andrew Vlahov, one
charging call and used up three timeouts.
The one thing they didn't have was points.
As in zero. Zip. Nada.
Bouyed by superb man-to-man defense,
Stanford opened up a 22-0 lead before WSU
center Brian Paine finally banked a ball
in. While the Cougars managed to close
within eight, they were never closer than
12 in the second half and Stanford snapped
a four-game losing streak, 68-54.
The win brings Stanford to 13-7 on the

season, and 5-6 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, heading into a game against Wash
ington Sunday afternoon. The Cougars,
who are winless in 1990, fell to 7-15 overall,
1-11 in league play, with their ninth
straight loss.
"Obviously we needed that very badly,"
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"The defense to start the game was a key
for us."
While the Cougars were producing noth
ing in their end of the court, Stanford was
displaying fine offense on the other end.
Guard John Patrick had four assists in the
opening spurt and was the beneficiary of
another pass. After Keefe rebounded a Dar
ryl Woods miss, the 6-foot-9 forward
brought the ball up court himself on the
break, dribbled behind his back and hit
Patrick with a perfect pass for a layup.
That was the biggest highlight for Keefe,
who played 29 minutes on a sprained ankle.
He took only one shot — he made it, of
course, to up his league-leading field goal
percentage to .670 — and had a total of
four points, his lowest output of the year.
The Pac-10's leading rebounder did pull
down six boards, however, second on the
Cardinal to Vlahov's eight.

Although hampered by a sprained ankle, Adam Keefe pulled down six boards and
added four points as the Cardinal crushed the Cougars 68-54 at Maples last night.
