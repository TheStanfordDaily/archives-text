## Card shuts down WSU 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It just wasn't a night for punctuality.
To begin with, there were only about
1000 people in Maples Pavilion just 15
minutes before tipoff of the Cardinal's bas
ketball game with Washington State.

Cardinal 68
Cougars 54

But if the Stanford fans were merely
late, the Cougar offense missed the plane.
In the first 10 minutes, 45 seconds of the
game Washington State had 10 shots, four
balls stolen from them by Adam Keefe, two
more balls stolen by Andrew Vlahov, one
charging call and used up three timeouts.
The one thing they didn't have was points.
As in zero. Zip. Nada.
Bouyed by superb man-to-man defense,
Stanford opened up a 22-0 lead before WSU
center Brian Paine finally banked a ball
in. While the Cougars managed to close
within eight, they were never closer than
12 in the second half and Stanford snapped
a four-game losing streak, 68-54.
The win brings Stanford to 13-7 on the

season, and 5-6 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, heading into a game against Wash
ington Sunday afternoon. The Cougars,
who are winless in 1990, fell to 7-15 overall,
1-11 in league play, with their ninth
straight loss.
"Obviously we needed that very badly,"
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"The defense to start the game was a key
for us."
While the Cougars were producing noth
ing in their end of the court, Stanford was
displaying fine offense on the other end.
Guard John Patrick had four assists in the
opening spurt and was the beneficiary of
another pass. After Keefe rebounded a Dar
ryl Woods miss, the 6-foot-9 forward
brought the ball up court himself on the
break, dribbled behind his back and hit
Patrick with a perfect pass for a layup.
That was the biggest highlight for Keefe,
who played 29 minutes on a sprained ankle.
He took only one shot — he made it, of
course, to up his league-leading field goal
percentage to .670 — and had a total of
four points, his lowest output of the year.
The Pac-10's leading rebounder did pull
down six boards, however, second on the
Cardinal to Vlahov's eight.

Although hampered by a sprained ankle, Adam Keefe pulled down six boards and
added four points as the Cardinal crushed the Cougars 68-54 at Maples last night.
After the run to open the game,
the Cardinal cooled off and made
a few costly turnovers. The result
was only one point in nearly 6V2
minutes as the Cougars went on
a 15-1 run to make it 23-15. But
Stanford bounced back to score
the final nine points of the half
for a 32-15 lead at the break.
Woods, who had 18 points to
lead the Cougars, hit a 19-footer
to open the second half but Wash
ington State got no closer than
15 until the game's final minute.
"We needed a good win," for
ward Deshon Wingate said. "1 ha
ven't lost four games in a row in
a long time and it didn't feel very
good."
Wingate finished with 11 points
on 5-of-6 shooting, including four
long jumpers and a second-half
dunk. Vlahov tallied 12 points and

Patrick and Kenny Hicks had 13
apiece to join Wingate in double
figures.
Hicks was particularly impres
sive, hitting four jumpers, includ
ing a three-pointer, converting a
nifty left-handed layup in the lane
and tipping in a missed shot for
his points. "Hicks came in and
had a nice game," Montgomery
said. "He shot the ball in and
played pretty well. ... I was glad
to get a chance to use him."
"I thought I played the best 1
have all year long," Hicks said.
"I just came in and tried to help
the team the best I could. Things
just went my way."
While Stanford's man-to-man
defense and 55-percent shooting
were positive notes, the Cardinal
still had one downer. The team
made only 10-of-20 free throws in
the game for the second poor per
formance from the line in three
outings.
But despite that problem, Stan
ford still got the win. The Cardi

nal is now 22-1 in Maples Pavilion
over the last two years, with the
one loss coming in overtime to
Oregon State.
Keefe feels that being home
again is just what Stanford
needed. "I think it just helps over
all," he said. "Two weeks is a long
time to go without a win. Coming
home and getting back into a nor
mal routine helped."
Stanford meets Washington, a
86-64 loser to California last
night, at Maples Sunday at 3 p.m.
"I just take the attitude that
it's my house and I don't want
anyone to come in here and beat
us," Wingate said.
