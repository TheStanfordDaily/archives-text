# Third starting pitcher?
## Baseball squad searches for victory, starting rotation as Cardinal takes on Hawaii Rainbows 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
When the Stanford baseball
team takes on the Hawaii Rain
bows this weekend in Honolulu,
the Cardinal starting pitchers will
be the the same as usual: Stan
Spencer in tonight's game, Mike
Mussina in tomorrow's . . . and
some guy named "To be an
nounced" on Sunday
Mr. TBA, who has three starts
so far this season, will most likely
be freshman Jamie Sepeda, but
then again it might be someone
else, like freshman Brian Sack
insky. Or maybe John Reid. Or
Aaron Dorlarque.
This weekend series is the last
for the Cardinal before it starts
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division play next week, and the
team still does not have a set

third pitcher. But that's not much
of a surprise, because the Cardinal
coaching staff has been in no rush
to name Spencer and Mussina's
cohort.
"We don't really have to make
that decision for about three or
four weeks," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said two weeks
ago at the start of the season.
"We'll probably have a pretty good

idea after the Hawaii series."
Odds are Sepeda will be tabbed,
but the picture is murkier than
it was just two games ago. In
three appearances this season, the
freshman has picked up a win and
a save, but got chased early in
his most recent start.
At Santa Clara two weeks ago,
Sepeda tossed three scoreless in
nings to nail down the save for

Spencer, and five days later he
started the 15-5 dismantling of
USF and picked up the win.
Sepeda'a stats for the first two
games were impressive: Six in
nings pitched, six hits, no runs
scored, seven strikeouts and only
one walk. Then came game No. 3.
Against Fullerton State Sun
day, Sepeda started his second
game of the year â€” and had his
first bout with disaster. With one
out in the first, Sepeda gave up
back-to-back doubles and the first
run of his collegiate career. In the
second, with two gone, he hit two
straight batters with pitches and
then surrendered two singles and
a double. Three runs scored.
Finally, in the fourth, Sepeda
walked the second batter up and,
after the next Titan singled, Mar
quess yanked the freshman. Dor
larque came in and gave up a

three-run homer, and two of the
runs were charged to Sepeda,
giving him six runs allowed in
only 3V3 innings.
If the Fullerton troubles were
a one-shot deal, then Sepeda
should be the team's third starter
both on Sunday and during next
weekend's UCLA series. If he
struggles again, though, things
could get sticky. Reid has started
the only other game of the season
(Spencer and Mussina have two
starts each) but after two appear
ances sports a 7.20 ERA.
Reid had better control against
Sacramento State this week, but
was the victim of several Cardinal
errors. He gave up four runs, one
of which was actually earned. If
he continues to improve, he may
work his way into the three-man
rotation.
