"Trisha tore 'em up," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "She looked
really tough on the block.
As usual, Stevens credited her team
mates. "God, the passes," she said in
amazement. "Did you see the passes
Soi\ja (Henning) was giving me?"
Stanford never made it to the hotel
in Pullman last night due to a
snowstorm in Eastern Washington. The
team bus made it through 75 of the 90
miles from the airport in Spokane before
a road block stopped it cold. It may
have been the best defense Stanford has
seen all season.
After the highway patrol concluded
the road would not reopen last night,
the Cardinal set up camp at the local
high school, getting to bed around 2:30
a.m.
It was not clear in the opening
minutes of last night's matchup at Boh
ler Gym that the Cardinal suffered no
adverse effects from its travel troubles.
Despite playing tenacious defense, Stan
ford could not gain much of an advan
tage on Washington State early.
With 10 minutes, 18 seconds remain
ing and the Cardinal up 20-17, Coach
Tara VanDerveer decided she had seen
enough and asked for a timeout. The
sideline pep talk obviously did the trick
as Stanford responded with a 26-2 run

over the next seven minutes.
"I saw we were scoring inside, inside,
inside," VanDerveer said. "All of the
sudden our perimeter people started
shooting." When they were not hitting,
VanDerveer called for the stoppage of
play and made it clear she wanted the
ball in the hands of Stevens and Co.
up front.
Things began innocently enough after
the timeout when Val Whiting made a
strong post move, Stacy Parson hit a
16-foot pull-up jumper, Sor\ja Henning
went coast to coast for a layup and
Whiting scored again.
Washington States Kristin Metson
followed that basket with the Cougars
only two points during the run, cutting
Stanford's lead to single digits, 28-19.
Then Stevens took over. Nearly un
stoppable in the low post, Stevens scored
the next six points on four free throws
and a baseline jumper. She scored again
during the run and finished the half
with 21 points on 8-of-12 shooting from
the field. Stevens also converted all five
attempt* from the stripe.
With the lead at 46-19, VanDerveer
began substituting her starters. Molly

Goodenbour came off the bench to score
the Cardinal's last five points of the
half. At intermission, the lead was an
insurmountable 51-26.
"Our guards are so great, you have
to play them honest," Stevens said, ex
plaining how that left her open down
low. "Anytime your going one-on-one
in the post, it's a disadvantage for the
defense."
Stevens said she wasn't doing any
thing special. She said the guards'
passes were so perfectly positioned "you
want to make the shot to give them the
assist."
Stanford was hot from the Held in
the first half, especially the Cardinal's
big people. The team converted 20 of
37 attempts from the field for a .541
percentage. The Cougars, by contrast,
were 8 of 25 — 32 percent. Stanford
held a huge edge on the boards as well,
26-10.
In the second stanza, the Cardinal
extended its margin early even though
the perimeter game got going. Katy
