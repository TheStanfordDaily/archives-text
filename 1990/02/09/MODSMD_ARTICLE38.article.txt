# Tough D the key

### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
The biggest cheer from
the Stanford crowd last
night during the game
against Washington State
came on a basket by the
Cougars, not the Cardinal.
The reason for the mocking
uproar was that the visitors
had just scored their first
points of the night, a full
10:46 into the game.
Stifling inside defense by
the Cardinal's front three of
Adam Keefe, Andrew Vlahov
and Deshon Wingate forced
the WSU guards to pull up
with shots from far outside.
The Cougars, who have had
trouble putting together an
effective offensive scheme all
year, just flat-out couldn't
put the ball in the basket.
For the half, Washington
State shot only 22 percent
from the floor, including an
embarassing l-of-12 from
three-point range. In the
second half, the struggling
Cougars bolstered those fig
ures to 50 percent on field
goals and a much-improved
6-of-13 from behind the
three-point stripe. But those
numbers only brought them
to 36 and 28 percent, respec
tively, for the game.
Before last night, Stan
ford led the Pacific-10 Con
ference in points allowed,
with an average of 63.4
points per game, and in
shooting percentage by the
opposition, holding other
ball clubs to only 43.7 per
cent on the year.
The Cardinal bettered
those marks against Wash
ington State, but really
didn't do anything different
than usual.
"We were playing solid de
fense," Vlahov said, "but
nothing special. We didn't
trap or anything like that."
Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery felt that one of
the keys coming into the
game would be to "play ag
gressively defensively," but
that cold shooting by the
Cougars also contributed to
the Cardinal's opening up
with such a huge lead.
"I don't think that our de
fense was the sole reason for
going up 22-0," Montgomery
said.
Washington State Coach
Kelvin Sampson summed it
up by admitting in exaspera
tion that his team just didn't
have the offensive fire
power.
"You try to pinpoint your
problems," Sampson said.
"And our problem was we
just couldn't score."
