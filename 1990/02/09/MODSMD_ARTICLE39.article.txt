# Breaststroker overcomes frosh jitters to lead Card to title
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Coming to Stanford can often
be a frightening experience. A 17-
year-old leaves home for a strange
place where you actually have to
study to get good grades.
The transition was even more
difficult for Jill Johnson four
years ago. Coming to Stanford as
one of the top high school
breaststrokers in the nation,
Johnson was effectively replacing
the just-graduated Kathy Smith,
the school record-holder in both
breaststroke events.
To make matters worse, in the
pool with Johnson every day at
practice was Susie Rapp, a silver
medalist in the 200-meter breast
stroke in the 1984 Olympics. Rapp
would set school records in five
different events before her career
on the Farm was over.
All in all, it was pretty heady
company for a freshman to be
keeping. "I was scared at first,"
Johnson said.
But now, four years later,
Johnson is at the other end of
the spectrum. Last year she was
the sixth-highest point-scorer at
the NCAA Championships, help
ing the Cardinal to its first na
tional title since 1983. She placed
fourth in the 200-yard individual
medley and took second in both
the 100 and 200 breaststrokes.
It's quite a long way to travel
for a scared freshman, but
Johnson thinks those early days
helped her achieve her later suc
cess. "It was good to train with
Susie," she said. "Once I got past
the scared stage it was the 'try
to keep up with Susie' stage. . . .
I think I won only one race the
whole year but I did well at [the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships]. I think I finally found a

place for myself at the end of the
season. ... I felt more confident
then."
Since then Johnson's confidence
has continued to grow and her
times have continued to drop. She
placed seventh in the 200 breast
stroke her freshman year and
sixth as a sophomore before
finishing as the runner-up to
Michigan's Ann Colloton last year.
Tomorrow Johnson, along with
fellow seniors Katie Connors, Bet
hanne Lambert and Susannah
Miller, will compete in her final
dual meet for the Cardinal. The
meet, against fourth-ranked Cal
ifornia, begins at noon at
deGuerre Pool.
Stanford brings a 7-0 record
and the No. 1 national ranking
into the meet. The Cardinal has
the Pac-10 Championships Feb.
23-25 then finishes the season
with the NCAA Championships,
March 15-17.
The breaststroke races tomor
row should be competitive as the
Golden Bears actually have some
of the top breaststrokers in the
nation, but they still don't match
up with the Cardinal. Stanford
freshman Lori Heisick has the na
tion's best time this year in both
the 100 and 200 breaststrokes and
Johnson currently ranks second

in the 100 and fourth in the 200.
Lambert and sophomores Susan
Johnson and J.T. Toton are also
among the nation's elite in both
events.
The highly-competitive group of
breaststrokers also makes meets
exciting even when Stanford is
overwhelming the opposition. And
with dual-meet scores like 108-13,
104-36 and 117-16 being the norm
for the Cardinal this year, a lot
of meets have been over early.
"If the other team isn't putting
up much of a fight we go Stanford
versus Stanford," Jill Johnson
said. "I think the idea is to stand
up and beat the person next to
you, or two lanes away."
With that attitude pervading
the team, and following a 93-47
win over No. 2 Texas last week
end, Stanford appears well on its
way to defending both the Pac-10
and NCAA titles won last year.
"I think it's been great," Johnson
said. "I'm amazed at how fast
people swam against Texas. . . .
People came back in better shape
in the fall. I think we're ahead
of where we were last year in
conditioning. ... I think things
look really good for NCAAs."
In addition to the team goal,
Johnson has high individual goals
for herself this year. Last year
she had the goal of winning the
200 breaststroke and posted the
fastest time in qualifying but lost
to Colloton in the final.
"Getting touched out in the 200
was a big disappointment,"
Johnson said. "I did my best time
ever by three-and-a-half seconds
but (winning) the 200 was my big
goal. ... I'd say there's a little of
a revenge element but I think
there'll be more competition this
year. Lori (Heisick) is swimming
really well and Dorsey (Tierney,
of Texas) is up there. ... I think

I can go faster than last year."
Johnson is also optimistic about
the 100 breaststroke after swim
ming that event well so far this
season. "I'm looking forward to
doing the 100 this year," she said.
"I think I might re-evaluate my
goals for the 100 because I'm
going pretty fast this year."
In her third event, the 200 IM,
Johnson surpised everyone with

her improvement last season.
While she doesn't think her but
terfly, backstroke and freestyle are
good enough to allow her to win
the event, she is hopeful she can
improve on last year's fourth
place finish.
And in the team competition
she doesn't think the result is as
obvious as the Stanford-Texas
dual meet would suggest. "I think

Texas is going to put up more of
a fight than the dual meet
showed," she said. "They have
more depth this year. . . . It's cer
tainly not going to be easy but
we're just going to go out there
and fight for every point."
She has come a long way indeed
from the scared freshman of four
years ago. Now, only her oppo
nents are afraid.
