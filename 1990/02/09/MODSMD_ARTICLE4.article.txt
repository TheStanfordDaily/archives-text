# Centennial cuts back Near West funds
## Fundraisers ahead of schedule, but $40 million redirected to quake relief 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Six months ahead of schedule, Stan
ford's Centennial Campaign, the largest
fundraising drive in the country, nas
raised $862 million of its $1.1 billion
goal, University fundraisers told the
Faculty Senate yesterday afternoon.
However, gifts solicited for the School
of Humanities and Sciences and the
Near West science and engineering com
plex remain below target, according to
John Ford, vice president for develop
ment.
The campaign has only raised 44 per
cent of the funds leading to the $180
million target for Near West and has
reduced the goal for the proposed de
velopment to $140 million.
Ford linked the troubling lack of
funds for Near West to the failure to
solicit two targeted $250 million gifts.
The $40 million diverted from Near
West will go toward earthquake repairs.
Only $13 million of the $40 million
in expected donations for the School of
Humanities and Sciences has been
raised, Ford said.
He attributed the deficiency to the

lack of wealthy graduates from Human
ities and Sciences as compared to the
School of Engineering, the Graduate
School of Business and the School of
Medicine.
"Humanities and Sciences has fewer
prospects who can give gifts of those
sizes," he said, referring to the multi
million dollar contributions solicited by
the Centennial Campaign.
Despite these setbacks, the fundrais
ing drive has successfully raised money
for "ongoing projects to keep the Uni
versity going" as well as collecting gifts
for several "featured objectives," Ford
said.
The Centennial has collected an en
dowment for the Haas Center for Public
Service as well as raised money for the
new undergraduate residence to be built
over a portion of the existing Manzanita
trailer park.
Of the 14,000 alumni who have been
targeted as potential donors, 5,000 have
been contacted. "We've got our work
cut out for us in the next two years,"
Ford said, as the Campaign gears up
to solicit gifts from the other 9,000.
After the Oct. 17 earthquake, those
involved in the Centennial debated

whether to increase the $1.1 billion goal
— "the psychology of trying to include
earthquake damage in the campaign,"
Ford explained.
"The conclusion was that we couldn't,
shouldn't, push the goal any higher,"
he said. "Stanford could exercise some
discipline."
Ford said that particular buildings
damaged by the earthquake probably
will receive some Centennial support
since they are attractive to many Stan
ford donors.
In other business, Spanish and Por
tuguese Prof. Mary Pratt questioned
Provost James Rosse about the un
finished modular units intended to
house her department and other depart
ments formerly located in Buildings 30
and 260.
The temporary buildings will be ready
in early March, Rosse said. He said he
expects the departments to work out of
the modulars for three years, until Lan
guage Comer is reopened.
In other action, the Senate unani
mously approved a proposal for the pro
gram in East Asian Studies to continue
conferring both bachelor's and master's
degrees.
