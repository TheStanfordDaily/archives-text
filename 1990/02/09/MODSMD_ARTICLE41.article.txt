# National spot lifts gymnast to new heights

Senior gymnast Conrad
Voorsanger was not your typical
child. Soon after learning hiow to
crawl, he learned how to
walk. . .on his hands. During
recess in kindergarten, Conrad
would leave his playmates in the
sandbox and head straight for the
monkey bars.
Luckily, he soon discovered a
sport that he could apply his self
developed talents to. By age 10,
he was on his way to becoming
one of the top gymnasts in the
nation.
Through the early stages of his
career, however, very few people
recognized how much potential he
had. He never received much at
tention in high school because his
focus was on the basics rather
than the big tricks. "No one
thought I was any good," he said.
He only practiced three times a
week, whereas most of his team
mates practiced every day.
Endless practice wasn't neces
sary. His natural ability carried
him through Junior National
squad qualifications two years in
a row. This understandably led to
some resentment among his fellow
gymnasts.
"I didn't do any hard tricks, so

I didn't make any mistakes. And
I would beat the guys who were
trying really difficult stuff but not
doing it perfectly," he explained.
All of this changed when
Voorsanger arrived at Stanford.
Coach Sadao Hamada began to
teach him the difficult tricks he
needed in order to compete at the
collegiate level. With his strong
background in the basic skills, he
had no trouble picking them up.
Voorsanger grabbed the atten
tion of the gymnastics world his

sophomore year, with a 9.9 score
on the parallel bars during a
NCAA preliminary meet. His first
place performance proved to be a
sign of things to come.
Another turning point occurred
during the spring of his junior
year. "I started working out in
sanely hard," he said. "I could
barely move after practice, and I
would just have to go home and
go to sleep." The goal of this
frenzied activity was a good
showing at the U.S.A. Champion
ships, which could lead to a spot
on the U.S. National team.
Voorsanger ended up with a 4th
place all-around finish, making
him one of eight gymnasts vying
for seven spots on the team that
would compete at the World
Championships in West Germany.
In the interim, however, he tore
a ligament in his thumb at the
Olympic Festival and the quality
of his performances went down.
"During training camp I was
really bad," he said. "Everybody
pretty much thought, 'OK, he's
the one we're going to leave be
hind.'"
Throughout September
Voorsanger continued to train
anyway, and on the first day of
classes of his senior year, he flew
to the East coast for the trial
meets. To many people's surprise,

he finished 2nd overall and
clinched a spot on the U.S. team.
Voorsanger had fulfilled his
long-term goal and personal chal
lenge. His 2nd place finish among
the Americans and his 30th place
all- around finish at the World
Championships merely provided
the icing on the cake.
His strong showing led to fur
ther recognition in the gymnastics
community. With his no. 2
ranking in the U.S., he was in
vited to compete in international
World Cup meets in Japan and
West Germany.
For now, however, his main con
centration is the Cardinal team.
Although he is an integral part of
the squad, he downplays his own
contributions and focuses on the
talents of the other members.
"I am really excited to be a
captain of this team in particular
because of its personality," he
said. "Everybody's motivated and
the mood in the gym is productive.
I have really good feelings about
the season."
The only thing that he wishes
he could change is the home meet
schedule, which conflicts with Fri
day night basketball games. For
those who prefer tumbling to drib
bling, however, the next home
meet will be on February 16th in
Burnham Pavilion.
