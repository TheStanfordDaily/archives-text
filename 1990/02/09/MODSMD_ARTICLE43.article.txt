# Two top-ranked Stanford netters advance in national tournament

### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Not too many Stanford stu
dents would choose to spend
February in Bloomington,
Minn. It's around 30 degrees,
and the night life is better in
Palo Alto.
But, for five Cardinal tennis
players, Bloomington is the hot
test spot in the country right
now.
The Rolex National Indoor
Championships kicked off today
in Bloomington, with Stanford
players making their presence
felt in both the men's and wom
en's draws.
On the men's side, sophomore
Alex O'Brien, who is ranked No.
23 by the Volvo Intercollegiate
Tennis Rankings, moved to the
second round as his opponent,
Kansas' John Falbo, was forced
to retire with a pulled muscle
early in the second set. O'Brien
led Falbo, ranked No. 11 nation
ally, 6-2, 1-0.
O'Brien now will face No. 4
Todd Martin of Northwestern.
"[Martin] is a big power hit
ter," Asst. Coach John Whit

linger said. "It's going to depend
on how well Alex returns and
passes. If he does that well, he
will win the match.
"Alex is seeing the ball well.
He feels real confident," Whit
linger said.
The women's team sent a
larger contingent to
Bloomington, including top
ranked Sandra Birch. Birch, the
only Cardinal seeded in the top
four, won 6-4, 6-2 over Brigham
Young's Mary Young yesterday.
Teri Whitlinger also tri
umphed today, recording a dif
ficult three-set win over USC's
Stephanie London 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
"[London] played well today,"
Teri Whitlinger said. "She
wasn't making too many mis
takes. But I felt if I could just
hang in there, I could win. It
was just a good match to get
under my belt."
Whitlinger, who beat London
earlier in the season, said she
probably should have come to
the net more. "I wanted to hit
myself for not getting in a few
more times," she said. "It would
have made the match so much
easier. That's definitely some

thing I will work on in the next
match."
For Stanford's Debbie
Graham and Lisa Green, how
ever, Bloomington was less kind.
Graham fell to Pepperdine's
Ginger Helgeson, 2-6, 6-3, 6-0.
According to a tournament di
rector, Helgeson, a Minnesota
native from nearby Edina, had
a huge hometown crowd cheer
ing on every point.
Graham, who has been seeded
No. 1 in the consolation bracket,
will meet Susan Williams of
Texas A&M.
Green, on the other hand, lost
to USC's Trisha Laux, 6-0, 6-3.
"In the first set, I wasn't really
in the match. I wasn't keeping
the ball in the court," Green
said. "The second set was a lot
closer, but [Laux] played really
well."
Green, seeded second in the
consolation draw, will square off
against Pepperdine's Janna
Kovacevich. Kovacevich beat
Green at the Volvo All-American
earlier in the season, and the
Stanford star will look to avenge
that loss.
