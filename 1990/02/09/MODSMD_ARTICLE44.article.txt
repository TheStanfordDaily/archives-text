# Card hosts revenge-minded UCSB
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Two weeks ago, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's volleyball team embar
rassed No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara,
sweeping them at their own tour
nament in front of their home
crowd.
Santa Barbara will look to
return the favor tonight as the
two teams compete in a best-of
five match format in Maples Pa
vilion at 7:30.
The Cardinal, coming off
straight-game victories against
upstart Cal State-Northridge and
California, will attempt to con
tinue its inspired play against yet
another highly-touted opponent.
The Gauchos, ranked ninth in
the preseason by Volleyball
Monthly, have suffered only one
official defeat, to No. 4 Hawaii.
The Gauchos are led by outside
hitters 6-foot-5 Todd Ahmadi and
6-foot-4 Mike Diehl although
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm cau
tions that Santa Barbara is
"capable of using a large number
of players."

"UC-Santa Barbara is a hus
tling, scrappy, ball control type
team," Sturm said. "This will be
a good test for us."
The Cardinal offense nonethe
less should be ready to pound
Santa Barbara's turf. Redshirt

freshman outside hitter Dave
Goss and senior middle blocker
Dan Hanan have undertaken
much of the hitting responsibili
ties thus far and have consistently
delivered.
Goss has led the Cardinal in
kills in the last two matches and
Hanan has registered points via
the block as well as the kill.
The match is the first of four
contests in the next ten days for
the Cardinal. Although the team
has focused solely on Santa Bar
bara in practice during the week,
some players may be anticipating
the two-match road trip the Stan
ford will make to Hawaii Monday.
Card notes
Backup setter Ryan O'Hara has
been practicing with the team and
may suit up tonight for the first time
in the regular season. Swing hitter
Ryan Moos, who broke a hand in his
bone, has not practiced and is im
probable.
In the latest Tachikara Coaches'
Poll, UCLA remains in the first po
sition with Stanford, USC, Hawaii
and Long Beach State following.
