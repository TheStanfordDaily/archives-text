# Cardinal grapplers hope new lineup is the key

The Stanford wrestling team
will put on some weight tonight
as it tries to defeat the Aggies
of UC-Davis.
"Our lineup is going to be
everybody moved (in weight] up
for the most part," said Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel.
Stanford enters the dual meet
with an 8-4 mark, while Davis
is 5-8.
Horpel said he is shuffling the
lineup in order to give some in
experienced wrestlers a chance
to compete. The change will also
challenge the wrestlers who are
competing in heavier weight
classes than usual.
The lighter weights will be the
most effected by the lineup
changes. Dave Nowick, Josh
Lisle and Dave Sacks will all rise
one weight class to 126, 134 and
142 respectively. This will make
room for Josh Fleming (118) who
has wrestled sparingly this year.
Injury is causing another
lineup shuffle. Davis' best
wrestler, Blu Taylor (158), was
scheduled to battle Matt Top
ham, but Topham sprained his

ankle during practice on Tues
day.
"It would have been a great
match to see Topham go against
their best wrestler," Horpel said.
Topham's substitute is likely
to be Mike Saran. "Mike Saran
actually hasn't competed yet this
season," said Horpel, "but he's
been looking pretty tough in
practice. It has just taken him
awhile to get in shape."
Steffond Jones will also
wrestle in place of Mark Graham
in the 167-pound weight class.
A key matchup will occur in
the 126-pound division where
Stanford's Dave Nowick will face
the Davis' Fred Cocio. Nowick
wrestled Cocio earlier this season
and narrowly won the bout.
The only other area of concern
for the Cardinal will be in the
150-pound weight class. Geoff
Baum will square off for the sec
ond time against Davis' Dan
Gwaltney. Gwaltney defeated
Baum at the Aggie Invitational
earlier this season.
Steve Buddie, the Cardinal's
most consistent wrestler, should
win again tonight. Buddie will
face Bill Pederson (177),

The Stanford wrestlers look to muscle out victory tonight by using a new lineup. After dropping
both matches last weekend the grapplers are hoping juggling the lineup and shifting some weight
classes will lead to victory against UC Davis.
