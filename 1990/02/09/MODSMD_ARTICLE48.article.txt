# Calling all the zany and spirited
## Search for the new tree begins 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
It is a strange dream.
You are in front of thousands
of people and find yourself
encased in styrofoam. Your
mind, boiling in a stew of beer
and doughnuts, tells your body
it is time. You begin to gyrate
and jump around, the sweat
pouring liberally from your
pores.
No one knows your name, but
they all know your name. The
crowd reaches for you and you
let them. A group of small
children approaches and you
find yourself in a sea of wild
screeches and giggles as the ur
chins maul your person. The
smallest of the lot reaches for
your hand, and looking down
you find yourself face to face
with two of the biggest eyes you
have seen.
You are happy. You are Tree
It is transition time in the
forest Stanford, and the band
needs your help. The anniver
sary of Gil Joseph Blank Ill's
selection as tree is upon us, and
the celebration includes him
being fired.
"Tradition has it that you can
be tree only once in your life,"
the soon-to-be-stump said.
"Kinda like being a virgin."
Sex is only part of the deal.
Actually, becoming the tree is a
little harder than losing your
virginity- being the tree requires
personality and some writing.
The first step is picking up an
application, which can be done
in the Student Organizational

The ploy the present tree used was a
re-surfacing of Elvis, but an Elvis that only
vegetation could love. With skin a light
green, eyebrows brown, and groomed wig
in place, Blank rode to his destiny...

Services office (SOS). Step two
is an informational meeting
February 15 in the Aspen room
(of course) located in Tresidder.
The applications get turned in
and a select few get chosen to
be interviewed.
About 15-20 people submit
applications, and out of that
about five to seven get chosen
for the interview," Blank said.
This is where the fun starts.
"We are looking for dazzly
showmanship, visual wit, and
mimetic verisimilitude," quoth
the tree.
This of course includes a cos
tume, and if you are smart,
some help from your friends.
Case in point is last years se
lection. The ploy the present
tree used was a re-surfacing of
Elvis, but an Elvis that only
vegetation could love. With skin
a light green, eyebrows brown,
and groomed wig in place, Blank
rode to his destiny, but he
wasn't alone. Surrounding The
King were fifteen secret service
men (complete with earphones
and guns) and two screaming
fans.
The idea was to have the
whole entourage present for
Blank's prepared presentation of
imported beer and song, but it

did not work that way. As soon
as he got there, Blank was
literally carried away by two
people in silver jumpsuits. Such
is the way of the Band.
Gil's friends waited around
and entertained themselves by
pretending to be band members
and harassing the next Tree-to
be. The person's pre-interview
trial included standing on one
foot and yelling his passion for
the position. It was his fault
though, he came alone.
"You need friends to come out
and make it a complete effort,"
Blank said." Two years ago a
person had his dorm make him
into an ice cream Sundae."
It sounds weird because it is.
Yet weird does not mean
obscene or vicious.
"Last year somebody turned
in a picture of himself urinating
on an effigy of Oskie," Blank
said. "This is not what we
want."
What they do want is appli
cants. The selection is open to
all, but former trees (stumps).
The last three trees have been
male, but they are the first
three male trees in its 16 year
history. Live the dream Stan
ford, pick up an application.
