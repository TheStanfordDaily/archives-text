# Campus Ministries conference backs Webb Ranch employees
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Pointing to the "urgency" of the
plight of Webb Ranch workers,
Stanford's Campus Ministries ad
ministered severe criticism of
Webb Ranch labor practices at a
press conference yesterday.
Student, faculty and staff
delegations to Webb Ranch were
"shocked and appalled" by condi
tions they saw at the Stanford
leased farm, according to a
statement issued by Campus Min
istries yesterday at the Old Union
press conference.
The statement emphasizes the
farm workers' poverty and the re
luctance of Webb Ranch officials
to improve conditions. "They (the
workers) have invested their lives
and labor in the ranch, but the
ranch now wants to divest them,"
the release states.
The University has leased the
land to the Webb family since
1922, and it is now used as a
vegetable and berry farm and
horse stabling facility.
"We feel compelled ... to ex
amine our moral responsibilities
(toward the ranch workers)," ac
cording to the statement written
cooperatively by representatives
of Campus Ministries.
Bob Gregg, dean of the chapel,
said the statement was meant "to
intensify and broaden in this com
munity the sense of urgency about
the plight of the workers."
According to the statement,
some workers have paid more
than $150 a month for rent, as a
percentage of their wages, "to live
in a 10 foot-by-10 foot room with
no electricity, no heating and in
adequate bedding."

Byron Bland, campus minister
in the United Campus Christian
Ministry, said the statement was
not meant to demand specific ac
tions, but to raise the Stanford
community's awareness. He said
he was afraid the workers' con
ditions at Webb Ranch would be
treated merely as a political issue,
rather than as the human
"tragedy" it is.
Floyd Thompkins, associate
dean of Memorial Church, said,
"We can't villainize anyone,"
noting the statement emphasizes
the responsibility of the entire
Stanford community.
Augustine Gonzalez, a worker
who is "the most outspoken
spokesman for the group" of
workers, has been singled out by
Webb Ranch managers, said
Daniel Ramirez, office coordina
tor in Residential Affairs.
Two weeks ago, on the same
day that Gonzalez spoke at a Na
tional Labor Relations Board
meeting, he said he was harassed
by a reckless driver.
Gonzalez, who has worked at
the ranch for 16 years, received
an eviction notice Monday forcing
him and his family to leave within
60 days. "This brings the whole
situation into very sharp relief,"
Ramirez said.
Gonzalez, who spoke in
Spanish, said the Webbs gave the
workers no reason for their at
tempts to force them to move out.
"Workers believe it's a retaliation
for trying to organize," Gonzalez
said.
According to Ramirez, part of
the Webbs' "strategy" to evict the
workers is to plow under harvest
crops and replace them with hay
for their horses, thus decreasing

the need for the workers.
A representative from the local
Community Action Agency said
the public interest group had of
fered to tear down the workers'
barracks and build new dormitor
ies without charge to the Webbs.
The offer was refused, she said.
Representatives of Campus
Ministries said they have unsuc
cessfully tried to begin a dialogue
with the Webbs.
The representatives agreed at
the press conference that student
involvement would be integral in
effecting improvement in the
workers' lives. The USW Local
680 is sponsoring a rally in White
Plaza at noon March 6 in support
of the workers.
Alma Medina, publicity coordi
nator of MEChA, said the Chi
cano/Latino student group is
reviving its labor support commit
tee. "The first step in any cam
paign is the educational process,"
she said.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley said the Faculty Senate
will discuss the issue in a forth
coming meeting. Manley said Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
felt "that the University was no
more responsible for the condi
tions (at Webb Ranch) than it was
for conditions of Macy's employ
ees."
But Gregg, a member of the
president's staff council, said
"there is no reason to think we
are confronting an administration
that is hostile or unsympathetic
to the workers."
"We were tired of being
humiliated," Gonzalez said. "As
far as us putting up with the ex
ploitation and discrimination, we
couldn't do it any longer."
