## 
### Todd Schneider 
Almost four-fifths of more than
1,100 surveyed undergraduates
say they favor using dorm funds
to buy alcohol, according to a
dorm poll conducted Wednesday
by the ASSU Alcohol Policy Task
Force.
The poll, conducted Wednesday
evening in dorms campus-wide,
asked students for their opinions
about this and three other pro
posals concerning changes in the
current University alcohol policy.
The four proposals were recently
introduced for community debate
by Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons..
Seventy-nine percent of the stu
dents rejected the proposal to
prohibit the use of student fees
collected by the University, such
as house dues, to purchase alcohol.
Only 12 percent agreed, and 9
percent abstained from answer
ing.
Just more than half the respon
dents favored the proposal that
would prohibit those convicted of
driving while intoxicated from

buying a parking permit on
campus for a year following their
conviction.
The closest results concerned
the proposal to permit alcohol at
University athletic events. Forty
five percent responded in favor of
the proposal, while 43 percent
were opposed.
Nearly 60 percent of the stu
dents did not support the fourth
proposal, to prohibit alcohol ad
vertising at athletic events. More
than 20 percent of the students
polled did not respond to this
question, more than to any other.
Council of Presidents member
Ingrid Nava said she was not sur
prised by the students' rejection
of the proposal to ban the use of
dorm funds for alcohol.
But concerning the proposal to
prohibit alcohol at athletic events,
Lyons said he was somewhat sur
prised by the student*' divided re
sponse. "The overwhelming
number of people I've talked to
support some kind of ban," he
9aid. "Not one voice has said it's
not a problem."
