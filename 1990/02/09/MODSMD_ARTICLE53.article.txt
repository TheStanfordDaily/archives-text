# Psychiatrist defends ethnic studies
## Cobbs warns audience about faults of color blindness 
### Rob Jamieson 
Dr. Price Cobbs, a world
renowned psychiatrist, ad
monished a Tresidder Union au
dience Wednesday to be wary of
Americans who advocate color
blindness and argue the need to
"move beyond" issues of race in
the future.
An audience of 150 in Tresid
der's Oak Lounge listened as
Cobbs, a noted psychiatrist
specializing in the study of race
relations, prescribed a path of ac
tion for blacks in the next century.
In his lecture, "Race, Ethnicity
and Cultural Differences in the
21st Century," Cobbs said, "It is
to our peril that we buy into the
notion of color blindness."
"Black people in America must
never forget that throughout this

country's history most things —
intellectual, emotional, spiritual
— associated with darker skin are
assumed to have less value than
is the case with white people."
Citing a "collusion to deny the
meaning of race" in America,
Cobbs challenged blacks to gain a
firm understanding of the mean
ing and psychology of race. Only
by first understanding how the
power structure uses race against
minorities, Cobbs argued, can
people of color empower them
selves around the issue of race.
Cobbs also noted a "monumen
tal task" for blacks in the 21st
century to reconcile the tension
of being black and American
against a backdrop of black
devaluation.
"Deep in every black soul that
has lived in this country there is

a balancing act," he said. "The
vivid manifestation of this on
going struggle occurs many times
when blacks are asked 'if things
are better off than before.'
"Whatever the answer is, there
is that inevitable pause as we ac
knowledge that the battle goes
on."
Cobbs, author of the books
"Black Rage" and"The Jesus
Bag," said that a key for African-
Americans in the future lies in
understanding racial identity and
resolving the inner conflict be
tween "the African part and the
American part."
Cobb's speech, the second in a
series, was sponsored by Stan
ford's Program in African and
Afro-American Studies, in
celebration of its 20th year.
