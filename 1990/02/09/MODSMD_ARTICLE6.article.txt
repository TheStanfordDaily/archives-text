# ASSU debuts new polling technique
## 
### Todd Schneider 
Long frustrated by a lack of
contact with students, the Council
of Presidents has launched a new
forum to gauge student opinion.
COP members believe the
method — in which ASSU dorm
representatives will conduct stu
dent opinion polls during dorm
meetings — to be the first of its
kind at Stanford.
The dorm representative polling
system is a change from the pre
vious ASSU Straw Poll, in which
dozens of at udents were randomly
selected to be called and ques
tioned about their opinions. Many
ASSU senators expect the new
voting system to strengthen the
dorm representative system,
which has been less effective than
originally intended.
