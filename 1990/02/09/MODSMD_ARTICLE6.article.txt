# ASSU debuts new polling technique
## 
### Todd Schneider 
Long frustrated by a lack of
contact with students, the Council
of Presidents has launched a new
forum to gauge student opinion.
COP members believe the
method — in which ASSU dorm
representatives will conduct stu
dent opinion polls during dorm
meetings — to be the first of its
kind at Stanford.
The dorm representative polling
system is a change from the pre
vious ASSU Straw Poll, in which
dozens of at udents were randomly
selected to be called and ques
tioned about their opinions. Many
ASSU senators expect the new
voting system to strengthen the
dorm representative system,
which has been less effective than
originally intended.
Council of Presidents member
Ingrid Nava, who put together the
dorm polling program, said the
new method will include a broader
base of students than the straw
poll and "make people feel like
they're really doing something"
to participate in the student gov
ernment.
"The straw poll didn't reach as
many people and was not scien
tific," said ASSU Senate Chair Ed
Sasaki. "After a straw poll, [the
Senate] would do a lot of second
guessing, such as 'Do [the stu
dents] know enough about the
issue they're voting on?' "
As part of the new ASSU dorm
polling, the dorm representative
will discuss the issue thoroughly
with dorm members before a vote.
And unlike the straw poll, the
dorm poll can be arranged quickly
to meet "the constantly changing
needs of the student body," ac
cording to ASSU senator Solina
Kwan. The straw polls required
extensive preparation and there
fore could not as easily reflect
current attitudes about pressing

campus issues.
Another benefit of dorm polling,
Nava said, is that it will cost noth
ing. For a straw poll, the ASSU
paid students to make the phone
calls.
Despite the apparent success of
dorm polling, however, straw polls
will continue. According to Nava,
participants in a telephone poll
will answer more questions than
students in a dorm meeting,
thereby eliciting responses about
more issues.
And Sasaki identified another
problem with the dorm poll: dorm
representatives may sometimes be
poorly prepared to present the is
sues. Also, the COP has not yet
made provisions to include grad
uate students in dorm polls.
Its shortcomings notwithstand
ing, the dorm polls have generally
received high marks from
senators who feel the ASSU has
not been in touch with student
concerns. However, at least one
critic has charged the COP with
attempting to use this new pro
gram as a public relations tool for
the upcoming election.
ASSU senator Kevin Warsh, a
member of the Students First
party, criticized the COP for

waiting until close to the ASSU
spring elections before introduc
ing dorm polling. He said he sus
pected the legitimacy of People's
Platform claims to represent the
opinions of students at the begin
ning of the year without the mech
anism of dorm polls.
"Polling students throughout
the course of the year is right,"
he said. "It seems disingenuous
[to start] now."
Sasaki said the critical question
of student support for funding
Lake Lagunita influenced the de
cision to improve the ASSU poll
ing techniques. The COP has
plans to conduct a dorm poll on
the status of the lake sometime
soon.
Nava said the COP must talk
to the Dean of Student Affairs
before a specific proposal can be
the subject of a dorm poll.
Although generally in favor of
the new method, Warsh said he
disagreed with polling students
about the lake. "It seems to me
a waste of time to use the dorm
reps to ask students, 'Do you want
[Lake Lagunita] filled?' when I
know a great msyority are in fa
vor."
