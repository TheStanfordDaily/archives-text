# Chang supports ethnic curriculum
## Prof, candidate wants institutionalized Asian-American studies 
### Quan Phung Staff writer 
Gordon Chang, associate pro
fessor of history at UC-Irvine,
questioned the notion that
institutionalized ethnic studies
would be detrimental to Asian-
Americans yesterday afternoon in
a presentation at the Asian Amer
ican Activities Center.
"It is necessary to have some
kind of institutional apparatus"
that brings together scholars from
different disciplines who are in
terested in Asian-American
studies, Chang said in a commu
nity presentation that was part of
his final interview for a tenure
track position in Asian-American
studies.
"Without it, Asian-American
studies would be lost at the Uni
versity," he said.
Asian-American studies is nat
urally "interdisciplinary," said
Chang, who spoke to an audience
of familiar faces. Until last sum
mer, Chang was a lecturer in
Stanford's History Deparment
and taught Stanford's only Asian-
American studies class.
It was Chang's decision to leave
Stanford last year that sparked
the Asian-American community
to petition for a tenure-track pro
fessor of Asian-American studies.
The issue was also one of the
central factors in the takeover of
the President's Office last May.
Chang's presentation was met
with apparent relief from the
more than 50 students, staff and
faculty members present. On
Monday, Cornell Sociology Prof.
Victor Nee angered many in the
Asian-American community by
his surprise decision to withdraw
his candidacy for the same posi
tion. In his presentation, Nee de
nounced the idea of ethnic studies
as "moving backwards."
According to sophomore Solina
Kwan, who listened to both

speakers, Chang's presentation
was "a breath of fresh air." She
said she was glad to hear
"someone who shares our goals
and who has a track record of
contribution to Asian-American
studies."
Jin Park, a junior in economics,
said, "We need someone on our
side because we're trying to es
tablish a foundation."
Addressing the community for
the first time since Monday's con
troversial presentation, Sylvia
Yanagisako, professor of anthro
pology and chair of the search
committee, said the committee is
"optimistic" about a successful
outcome in the search.
After the other finalist, George
town English Prof. David Liu,
gives his presentation on Feb. 13,
the committee will reconvene and
"decide what to do from there,"
according to Ron Nakao, a grad
uate student and one of the two
student members of the commit
tee.
Many in the audience praised
Chang's scholarship and commit
ment to Asian-American studies
after he spoke.

Nakao said Chang's scholarship
"is very impressive." But "in a
sense, this is the first candidate
we have seen, so we have to wait
until we hear all of them."
Park, who enrolled in Chang's
Asian-American history collo
quium as a freshman, said, "He
is very knowledgable and teaches
from his heart."
Lisa Kimura, a junior in applied
earth sciences, who heard Chang
speak for the first time, said, "His
past experiences and what he's
done at Stanford show that he is
committed" to building Asian-
American studies.
Chang said he believes "Asian-
American studies is a promising
field with much to be done." Many
universities, including UCLA,
Cornell and UC-San Diego are
currently looking for Asian-
American scholars who can con
tribute to their existing programs,
he said.
He said he believes Stanford has
the "right environment" to sup
port an Asian-American studies
program, citing that speaker se
ries, movies, programs and other
activities which currently exist are
integral in establishing a pro
gram.
Chang also cited the abundance
of untapped resources at Stan
ford. He said other scholars, such
as Yanagisako and Bill Hing, a
visiting professor at the Law
School, could be instrumental in
building such a program here.
It is "essential for minority
groups on campus to work to
gether," he said.
In an interview after the pre
sentation, Chang praised Stanford
students for their "remarkable"
effort in fighting to establish an
Asian-American scholar position.
Chang also expressed interest
in working with the Center for
International Security and Arms
Control again.

Monday, Cornell Sociology Prof.
Victor Nee angered many in the
Asian-American community by
his surprise decision to withdraw
his candidacy for the same posi
tion. In his presentation, Nee de
nounced the idea of ethnic studies
as "moving backwards."
According to sophomore Solina
Kwan, who listened to both

speakers, Chang's presentation
was "a breath of fresh air." She
said she was glad to hear
"someone who shares our goals
and who has a track record of
contribution to Asian-American
studies."
Jin Park, a junior in economics,
said, "We need someone on our
side because we're trying to es
tablish a foundation."
Addressing the community for
the first time since Monday's con
troversial presentation, Sylvia
Yanagisako, professor of anthro
pology and chair of the search
committee, said the committee is
"optimistic" about a successful
outcome in the search.
After the other finalist, George
town English Prof. David Liu,
gives his presentation on Feb. 13,
the committee will reconvene and
"decide what to do from there,"
according to Ron Nakao, a grad
uate student and one of the two
student members of the commit
tee.
Many in the audience praised
Chang's scholarship and commit
ment to Asian-American studies
after he spoke.

Nakao said Chang's scholarship
"is very impressive." But "in a
sense, this is the first candidate
we have seen, so we have to wait
until we hear all of them."
Park, who enrolled in Chang's
Asian-American history collo
quium as a freshman, said, "He
is very knowledgable and teaches
from his heart."
Lisa Kimura, a junior in applied
earth sciences, who heard Chang
speak for the first time, said, "His
past experiences and what he's
done at Stanford show that he is
committed" to building Asian-
American studies.
Chang said he believes "Asian-
American studies is a promising
field with much to be done." Many
universities, including UCLA,
Cornell and UC-San Diego are
currently looking for Asian-
American scholars who can con
tribute to their existing programs,
he said.
He said he believes Stanford has
the "right environment" to sup
port an Asian-American studies
program, citing that speaker se
ries, movies, programs and other
activities which currently exist are
integral in establishing a pro
gram.
Chang also cited the abundance
of untapped resources at Stan
ford. He said other scholars, such
as Yanagisako and Bill Hing, a
visiting professor at the Law
School, could be instrumental in
building such a program here.
It is "essential for minority
groups on campus to work to
gether," he said.
In an interview after the pre
sentation, Chang praised Stanford
students for their "remarkable"
effort in fighting to establish an
Asian-American scholar position.
Chang also expressed interest
in working with the Center for
International Security and Arms
Control again.
