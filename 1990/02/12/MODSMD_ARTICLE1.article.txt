# Mandela's release: long struggle forces Pretoria's hand

The cry of "Free Mandela" finally
was answered yesterday when the 71-
year-old South African leader walked
out of prison, a free man after 27 years.
Nelson Mandela's release resulted
from years of struggle by black South
Africans combined with international
pressure — including the efforts of the
Stanford community.
Mandela, who spoke in public yester
day for the first time in nearly three
decades, told a crowd in excess of
200,000 people, "Your tireless and heroic
sacrifices have made it possible for me
to be here today."

The Stanford community concurred
with Mandela's assessment and shared
the joy and excitement of the day. Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy called
Mandela's release "inspiring news" and
went on to say, "Freedom has been a
sort of epidemic this year. If it can go
from the Caucasus to the Baltic, maybe
some of those waves can reach to South
Africa, too."
"It's a great day in history," said Black
Student Union Chair Calvin Martin. "If
South Africa can be free, then that
should give inspiration for students in

California."
Freshman Tsele Nkhereanye, who
holds dual citizenship in the United
States and Lesotho, an independent
country within the borders of South
Africa, said, "I felt like the father of
my destiny had been set free. I intend
on going back to South Africa."
Stanford graduate student Jonathan
Jansen and his wife, who are South
African citizens, reportedly returned
home to Cape Town so they could wit
ness the historic events firsthand.
Professors who specialize in African
studies cited Mandela's release as one
of the great historic events of this cen
tury. Assoc. History Prof. Kennell Jack
son said Mandela "must be one of the

consummate moral forces of the 20th
century."
"He will be as important to the dis
cussions in South Africa as George
Washington was to the founding of
America," Jackson added.
Law Prof. William Gould, who has
visited South Africa three times, said
Mandela's release "represents some
thing both exhilarating and profound in
terms of a shift in the policy of the
ruling regime."
The scholars cited two factors — black
South African resistance and interna
tional economic sanctions — as critical
to producing Mandela's release.
The two elements have always been
related in that the internal resistance

movement haa consistently asked its in
ternational allies to help by economically
isolating the South African government.
James Gibbs, chair of the Anthropol
ogy Department, observed that "it was
undoubtedly a combination of economic
pressure from sanctions and resistance
of the [African National Congress], both
armed and unarmed, and the growing
strength of the trade union movement"
that resulted in Mandela's release.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy, chair of the Progr am in African
Studies, agreed with Gibbs, saying,
"There's nothing quite like a combina
tion of internal pressures and external
