# Mandela's release: long struggle forces Pretoria's hand
## 
### Steve Phillips Editorial staff 
The cry of "Free Mandela" finally
was answered yesterday when the 71-
year-old South African leader walked
out of prison, a free man after 27 years.
Nelson Mandela's release resulted
from years of struggle by black South
Africans combined with international
pressure — including the efforts of the
Stanford community.
Mandela, who spoke in public yester
day for the first time in nearly three
decades, told a crowd in excess of
200,000 people, "Your tireless and heroic
sacrifices have made it possible for me
to be here today."

The Stanford community concurred
with Mandela's assessment and shared
the joy and excitement of the day. Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy called
Mandela's release "inspiring news" and
went on to say, "Freedom has been a
sort of epidemic this year. If it can go
from the Caucasus to the Baltic, maybe
some of those waves can reach to South
Africa, too."
"It's a great day in history," said Black
Student Union Chair Calvin Martin. "If
South Africa can be free, then that
should give inspiration for students in

California."
Freshman Tsele Nkhereanye, who
holds dual citizenship in the United
States and Lesotho, an independent
country within the borders of South
Africa, said, "I felt like the father of
my destiny had been set free. I intend
on going back to South Africa."
Stanford graduate student Jonathan
Jansen and his wife, who are South
African citizens, reportedly returned
home to Cape Town so they could wit
ness the historic events firsthand.
Professors who specialize in African
studies cited Mandela's release as one
of the great historic events of this cen
tury. Assoc. History Prof. Kennell Jack
son said Mandela "must be one of the

consummate moral forces of the 20th
century."
"He will be as important to the dis
cussions in South Africa as George
Washington was to the founding of
America," Jackson added.
Law Prof. William Gould, who has
visited South Africa three times, said
Mandela's release "represents some
thing both exhilarating and profound in
terms of a shift in the policy of the
ruling regime."
The scholars cited two factors — black
South African resistance and interna
tional economic sanctions — as critical
to producing Mandela's release.
The two elements have always been
related in that the internal resistance

movement haa consistently asked its in
ternational allies to help by economically
isolating the South African government.
James Gibbs, chair of the Anthropol
ogy Department, observed that "it was
undoubtedly a combination of economic
pressure from sanctions and resistance
of the [African National Congress], both
armed and unarmed, and the growing
strength of the trade union movement"
that resulted in Mandela's release.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy, chair of the Progr am in African
Studies, agreed with Gibbs, saying,
"There's nothing quite like a combina
tion of internal pressures and external
pressures."
What Kennedy referred to as
"the steady determination of
black South Africans and their
leadership in the struggle for the
rights they deserve" was also a
critical factor in changing the pol
icies of the South African govern
ment.
The African National Congress
began its struggle in 1912 and
has been waging an armed
struggle since 1961 after the kil
ling of 60 unarmed black civilians
in Sharpeville.
For the past three decades,
black resistance has continued to
challenge the apartheid regime.
Over the years, an international
solidarity movement has devel
oped. The principal form of
solidarity requested by the anti
apartheid movement was eco
nomic sanctions against the South
African government.
Since the early 19705, the Stan
ford community has responded to
that call. In 1971, the BSU chal
lenged the administration to
divest its stock holdings in corpo
rations which operated in South
Africa, and the trustees responded
by developing a policy on invest
ment responsibility.
After the 1976 killing in Soweto
of several black South African stu
dents who were protesting racism
in the education system, Ameri
can students escalated their de
mands for divestment.
At Stanford, 294 people were
arrested at a sit-in in Old Union
in 1977 and the University
responded by establishing the

Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility.
Most recently, in 1984, the
South African struggle intensified
again and inspired Americans to
respond with national demonstra
tions and calls for sanctions. At
Stanford, after thousands of stu
dents demonstrated in 1985 and
slept out in the Quad in support
of divestment, the University
divested from its first company
in South Africa.
Stanford has also been linked
to the South African struggle
through the appearance here of
major leaders of the anti
apartheid movement. South
AJfrican leaders Archbishop Des
mond Tutu, a Nobel laureate, and
the Rev. Allan Boesak gave
keynote addresses at the Univer
sity's annual Martin Luther King
Jr. celebrations in 1986 and 1988,
respectively. Both individuals im
plored the Stanford community
to support economic sanctions.
Stanford experts acknowledged
that all of this pressure has had
an impact. Gould, who has been
barred by the South African gov
ernment from traveling to that
country, said, "Very simply, they
wanted to get sanctions off their
back. Their economy has been
hurting very badly."
Abernethy noted that "the
cumulative effect of a number of
countries imposing economic
sanctions" has brought about zero
growth in the South African eco
nomy.
Although yesterday was a day
of celebration, the optimism was
tempered by the reality of the
challenge ahead. Gibbs said that
the release was "a very important
step in a movement toward de

'I felt like the father of
my destiny had been
set free.'

mocracy in South Africa, but it
is only a first step. What happens
next is critical."
According to Abernethy, Man
dela must reconcile a diverse spec
trum of opinion within the black
community as well as reassure a
nervous white population. "The
[African National Congress] must
move from opposing apartheid to
imposing policies," said Aber
nethy.
Despite the challenges ahead,
the professors expressed hope that
real movements toward democ
racy are possible in the near fu
ture. Gibbs and Abernethy both
cited the recent peaceful transi
tion to power of the Southwest
African People's Organization in
neighboring Namibia as reason
for optimism in South Africa.
"The really quite remarkable
developments in Namibia, where
[the People's Organization], in
fairly short order, worked out the
basis for a democratic society, is
an enormously good sign," said
Abernethy.
If the challenges in the future
are to result in a democratic
South Africa, it seems likely that
the combination of internal resis
tance and external pressure must
continue.
In his speech yesterday, Man
dela signaled that the struggle will
continue: "Today, the majority of
South Africans, black and white,
recognize that apartheid has no
future. It has to be ended by our
decisive mass action."

tion of internal pressures and external
pressures."
What Kennedy referred to as
"the steady determination of
black South Africans and their
leadership in the struggle for the
rights they deserve" was also a
critical factor in changing the pol
icies of the South African govern
ment.
The African National Congress
began its struggle in 1912 and
has been waging an armed
struggle since 1961 after the kil
ling of 60 unarmed black civilians
in Sharpeville.
For the past three decades,
black resistance has continued to
challenge the apartheid regime.
Over the years, an international
solidarity movement has devel
oped. The principal form of
solidarity requested by the anti
apartheid movement was eco
nomic sanctions against the South
African government.
Since the early 19705, the Stan
ford community has responded to
that call. In 1971, the BSU chal
lenged the administration to
divest its stock holdings in corpo
rations which operated in South
Africa, and the trustees responded
by developing a policy on invest
ment responsibility.
After the 1976 killing in Soweto
of several black South African stu
dents who were protesting racism
in the education system, Ameri
can students escalated their de
mands for divestment.
At Stanford, 294 people were
arrested at a sit-in in Old Union
in 1977 and the University
responded by establishing the

Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility.
Most recently, in 1984, the
South African struggle intensified
again and inspired Americans to
respond with national demonstra
tions and calls for sanctions. At
Stanford, after thousands of stu
dents demonstrated in 1985 and
slept out in the Quad in support
of divestment, the University
divested from its first company
in South Africa.
Stanford has also been linked
to the South African struggle
through the appearance here of
major leaders of the anti
apartheid movement. South
AJfrican leaders Archbishop Des
mond Tutu, a Nobel laureate, and
the Rev. Allan Boesak gave
keynote addresses at the Univer
sity's annual Martin Luther King
Jr. celebrations in 1986 and 1988,
respectively. Both individuals im
plored the Stanford community
to support economic sanctions.
Stanford experts acknowledged
that all of this pressure has had
an impact. Gould, who has been
barred by the South African gov
ernment from traveling to that
country, said, "Very simply, they
wanted to get sanctions off their
back. Their economy has been
hurting very badly."
Abernethy noted that "the
cumulative effect of a number of
countries imposing economic
sanctions" has brought about zero
growth in the South African eco
nomy.
Although yesterday was a day
of celebration, the optimism was
tempered by the reality of the
challenge ahead. Gibbs said that
the release was "a very important
step in a movement toward de

'I felt like the father of
my destiny had been
set free.'

mocracy in South Africa, but it
is only a first step. What happens
next is critical."
According to Abernethy, Man
dela must reconcile a diverse spec
trum of opinion within the black
community as well as reassure a
nervous white population. "The
[African National Congress] must
move from opposing apartheid to
imposing policies," said Aber
nethy.
Despite the challenges ahead,
the professors expressed hope that
real movements toward democ
racy are possible in the near fu
ture. Gibbs and Abernethy both
cited the recent peaceful transi
tion to power of the Southwest
African People's Organization in
neighboring Namibia as reason
for optimism in South Africa.
"The really quite remarkable
developments in Namibia, where
[the People's Organization], in
fairly short order, worked out the
basis for a democratic society, is
an enormously good sign," said
Abernethy.
If the challenges in the future
are to result in a democratic
South Africa, it seems likely that
the combination of internal resis
tance and external pressure must
continue.
In his speech yesterday, Man
dela signaled that the struggle will
continue: "Today, the majority of
South Africans, black and white,
recognize that apartheid has no
future. It has to be ended by our
decisive mass action."
The cry of "Free Mandela" finally
was answered yesterday when the 71-
year-old South African leader walked
out of prison, a free man after 27 years.
Nelson Mandela's release resulted
from years of struggle by black South
Africans combined with international
pressure — including the efforts of the
Stanford community.
Mandela, who spoke in public yester
day for the first time in nearly three
decades, told a crowd in excess of
200,000 people, "Your tireless and heroic
sacrifices have made it possible for me
to be here today."

release, page 3

The Stanford community concurred
with Mandela's assessment and shared
the joy and excitement of the day. Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy called
Mandela's release "inspiring news" and
went on to say, "Freedom has been a
sort of epidemic this year. If it can go
from the Caucasus to the Baltic, maybe
some of those waves can reach to South
Africa, too."
"It's a great day in history," said Black
Student Union Chair Calvin Martin. "If
South Africa can be free, then that
should give inspiration for students in

California."
Freshman Tsele Nkhereanye, who
holds dual citizenship in the United
States and Lesotho, an independent
country within the borders of South
Africa, said, "I felt like the father of
my destiny had been set free. I intend
on going back to South Africa."
Stanford graduate student Jonathan
Jansen and his wife, who are South
African citizens, reportedly returned
home to Cape Town so they could wit
ness the historic events firsthand.
Professors who specialize in African
studies cited Mandela's release as one
of the great historic events of this cen
tury. Assoc. History Prof. Kennell Jack
son said Mandela "must be one of the

consummate moral forces of the 20th
century."
"He will be as important to the dis
cussions in South Africa as George
Washington was to the founding of
America," Jackson added.
Law Prof. William Gould, who has
visited South Africa three times, said
Mandela's release "represents some
thing both exhilarating and profound in
terms of a shift in the policy of the
ruling regime."
The scholars cited two factors — black
South African resistance and interna
tional economic sanctions — as critical
to producing Mandela's release.
The two elements have always been
related in that the internal resistance

movement haa consistently asked its in
ternational allies to help by economically
isolating the South African government.
James Gibbs, chair of the Anthropol
ogy Department, observed that "it was
undoubtedly a combination of economic
pressure from sanctions and resistance
of the [African National Congress], both
armed and unarmed, and the growing
strength of the trade union movement"
that resulted in Mandela's release.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy, chair of the Progr am in African
Studies, agreed with Gibbs, saying,
