Reagan cancels speech
LAS VEGAS (AP) — Former Pres
ident Ronald Reagan, preparing to
testify by videotape in the trial of a
former White House aide, ftaimed a
scheduling conflict yesterday in can
celing a speech before thousands of
auto dealers.
Defense attorneys for former Na
tional Security Adviser John Poin
dexter have subpoenaed Reagan's
diaries for Poindexter's trial on
charges of obstructing Congress dur
ing an investigation into arms sales
to Contra forces in Nicaragua.
A federal judge ordered Reagan to
turn over some of the entries. Reagan
is resisting the subpoena by invoking
executive privilege.

On Friday, Reagan agreed to an
swer questions in videotape tes
timony. That taping is to take place
in Los Angeles on Friday, four days
before the scheduled start of Poin
dexter's trial.
Welfare experiments
DALLAS (AP) — Thousands of
poor people in Texas and four other
states are unwitting subjects in a
federal experiment that denies some
aid to a portion of them to see how
well they live without it, a newspaper
said yesterday.
Extra Medicaid and child-care
benefits now go to about 8,000 people
in five regions of Texas, while about
800 people — selected at random bv

birth date — are excluded. On April
1, those extra benefits will be avail
able to more than 50,000 people
statewide — but not to the 800 un
lucky Texans who face two more
years without the help, The Dallas
Morning News reported yesterday.
The point of the federal study: to
see how well the new expanded pro
grams wean people off the welfare
rolls.
Arms policy criticized
WASHINGTON (AP) - The chair
man of the Senate Armed Services
Committee criticized the Bush ad
ministration's arms control position
yesterday as being put together by

"carpenters rather than architects,"
lacking a broad view.
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the
administration needs to take a look
at U.S. weapons systems as they
relate to arms control and an appar
ent willingness by the Soviets to dis
arm.
"It's going to be awfully hard for
this administration to say we've had
a breakthrough in negotiating with
the Soviets, we're going to reduce
arms by about 30 to 40 percent and
then come up and say we want two
missiles — two of them mobile; we
want a new B-2 bomber; we want an
SDI program to go forward full steam
— all of these things at one time,"
Nunn said on NBC-TV's "Meet the
Press" program.
