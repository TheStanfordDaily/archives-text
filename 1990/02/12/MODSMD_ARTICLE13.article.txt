Protests, sanctions
helped pave way
to Mandela's freedom

FREE AT LAST, free at last.
History was made yesterday
at 6:15 a.m. PST as Nelson
Mandela, the jailed leader of South
Africa's black liberation struggle,
breathed free air for the first time
in 27 years.
Mandela's release comes after
South African president F.W. de
Klerk, over the course of the past
10 days, has made sweeping con
cessions to blacks, including
legalizing the African National
Congress.
South Africa's reforms come at
a time of monumental change, as
democracy comes to oppressive
regimes all over the world. Now
we can only hope that South Africa
will continue to follow the tide of
the times, and that the blacks of
South Africa will finally see the
justice and liberty they have been
so long denied.
Although economic sanctions
were the push that finally set
South Africa in motion, these sanc
tions would not have come about
had it not been for the people
around the world who cried out
for justice.
Stanford can take pride in being
a strong force in the movement
against apartheid.
The Stanford Black Student
Union took the lead in joining the
struggle with its 1971 set of de
mands calling for "an end to Stan
ford complicity with racist corpo
rate policies and practices, foreign
and domestic."
Years later, in June 1976, Stan
ford students reacted against the
news of a Soweto massacre in
South Africa by holding one of the
largest sit-ins in the country in

Old Union. During the protest, 294
students were arrested in solidarity
with the struggling blacks of South
Africa.
In a more recent demonstration
in 1985, about 250 students
protested Stanford's holdings in
South Africa and called for com
plete divestment of stocks of all
corporations operating in South
Africa.
Each of these events showed the
University the breadth and the
strength of the students' commit
ment.
The University responded posi
tively to the students' demands —
we now hold a policy of selected
divestment, which means we look
at the corporations on a case-by
case basis. Thus far, Stanford has
divested millions from South
Africa.
Stanford can feel good in
knowing that we have developed a
socially responsible policy — that
we have been a part of the move
ment that made Mandela's freedom
a reality.
At the same time, it is important
to remember that Mandela's re
lease is only a first step toward
change. Apartheid still remains
strong, and, in the words of the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, "[Mandela] is
out of jail, but not free: not free
to move to the neighborhood of his
choice, not free to send his
grandchildren to the school of his
choice; not free to vote; not free
to run for office in his own coun
try."
We must look at Mandela's re
lease as a sign that our struggle
has not been in vain — not that
our struggle is over.
His release should give us the
inspiration to continue our fight
— it must serve to renew our hope
in a better world — so that one
day the words of the old Negro
spiritual will be a reality, and we
will all be free at last.
