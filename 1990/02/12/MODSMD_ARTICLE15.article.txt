## Finding new role models 
### 
WHEN I WAS 8 years old, I tucked
my braided pigtails under a blue
and red baseball cap, reasoning
with all of my third-grade wisdom that
the disguise would hide my gender,
grabbed my Tony Oliva autographed
glove and jumped in the family Wagoneer
to go to the baseball park. The early
April temperatures were soaring into the
50s in Pocatello, Idaho, and snow had
been absent for at least a couple of weeks.
The season was Little League, that
glorious time of year when 8-year-olds
dream of becoming the next Reggie Jack
son.
Reggie Jackson? Aw, who am I kidding?
I was never going to be the next Reggie
Jackson. I didn't have the bat, I didn't
have the speed, and I didn't have what
every Little Leaguer protected with a cup
and jock.
But the powers-that-were at Bannock
Boys Baseball concentrated only on the
absence of the last feature. The league,
officials — among whom was my elemen
tary school vice principal — took one look
at me and didn't even give me a chance
to let a grounder roll through my legs.
At age 25, I've gotten over the Little
League thing. To be honest, fear of a
lawsuit prompted the league to let me
in the next year — and I didn't even
have to wear a cup and jock.
But I still haven't gotten over having
Reggie Jackson as my role model.
You see, when you're a little kid and
you love sports, you don't just want to
be like Reggie Jackson, you want to be
Reggie Jackson. You walk out in the front
yard with your bat and say, "Reggie Jack

son steps to the plate. Two on and two
out. The A's are down by two." You dig
in your fake spikes and say, "Here's the
pitch, Jackson swings — going, going,
gone. Home run!" You practice your home
run trot. You even practice tipping your
cap to the crowd.
It's not that there's something wrong
with having Reggie as a role model. I
still like the guy; I even take my car to
his dealership on El Camino Real for
servicing.
It's just that in a world where little
girls not only can't be Reggie Jackson
but also can't even be like him, it would
be a vast improvement to have some
women role models. Little girls who like
to throw or hit round things — and don't
get convinced that tennis is the only ap
propriate sport for someone of their
gender — need someone to be. Little girls
need to be able to step to the plate without
that odd dysfunctional moment when
they call themselves "Reggie."
That's why, although it probably wasn't
her favorite moment, the best thing I've
seen Stanford guard Jennifer Azzi do all
season happened Jan. 25 during the Car
dinal's pre-game tuneup for its win over
the University of Arizona. While the rest
of the squad shot lay-ups, Azzi, dressed
in street clothes and, wearing a brace on
her sprained ankle, stood amid a throng
of young girls — and, I suspect, some
young boys — and signed autographs.
When I played basketball as a kid, 1
sought autographs of local college players,
too. Only they had names like Steve and
Ed and Ernie.
Undoubtedly Azzi's three-page spread

in Sports Illustrated and two regular
season appearances on ESPN have made
her a role model for many who themselves
can't show up in Maples. Undoubtedly if
Sonja Henning, Katy Steding and the
rest of the team hadn't had to play, they,
too, would have been surrounded.
In fact, at the conclusion of a subse
quent home game — while taking a break
from trying to talk some precocious child
out of one of those little red victory balls
— I noticed that some of the players
take time to sign autographs and chat
with the younger fans before heading for
the showers.
1 wouldn't be surprised if there's an
8-year-old girl in Pocatello, Idaho, who
wants to be Jennifer Azzi. Maybe dys
function over sports role models for girls
is going the way of the 25-cent stamp.
Whoa! Hold that thought. r
The Feb. 12 issue of Sports Illustrated
just arrived, and I was reminded that I
can't be too sanguine about women role
models in sports. Yes, the swimsuit issue.
In Sports Illustrated, women who don't
actually swim — or shoot baskets or hit
tennis balls or putt — get a lot more
than three pages of coverage.

Whoa! Hold that thought. r
The Feb. 12 issue of Sports Illustrated
just arrived, and I was reminded that I
can't be too sanguine about women role
models in sports. Yes, the swimsuit issue.
In Sports Illustrated, women who don't
actually swim — or shoot baskets or hit
tennis balls or putt — get a lot more
than three pages of coverage.

WHEN I WAS 8 years old, I tucked
my braided pigtails under a blue
and red baseball cap, reasoning
with all of my third-grade wisdom that
the disguise would hide my gender,
grabbed my Tony Oliva autographed
glove and jumped in the family Wagoneer
to go to the baseball park. The early
April temperatures were soaring into the
50s in Pocatello, Idaho, and snow had
been absent for at least a couple of weeks.
The season was Little League, that
glorious time of year when 8-year-olds
dream of becoming the next Reggie Jack
son.
Reggie Jackson? Aw, who am I kidding?
I was never going to be the next Reggie
Jackson. I didn't have the bat, I didn't
have the speed, and I didn't have what
every Little Leaguer protected with a cup
and jock.
But the powers-that-were at Bannock
Boys Baseball concentrated only on the
absence of the last feature. The league,
officials — among whom was my elemen
tary school vice principal — took one look
at me and didn't even give me a chance
to let a grounder roll through my legs.
At age 25, I've gotten over the Little
League thing. To be honest, fear of a
lawsuit prompted the league to let me
in the next year — and I didn't even
have to wear a cup and jock.
But I still haven't gotten over having
Reggie Jackson as my role model.
You see, when you're a little kid and
you love sports, you don't just want to
be like Reggie Jackson, you want to be
Reggie Jackson. You walk out in the front
yard with your bat and say, "Reggie Jack

son steps to the plate. Two on and two
out. The A's are down by two." You dig
in your fake spikes and say, "Here's the
pitch, Jackson swings — going, going,
gone. Home run!" You practice your home
run trot. You even practice tipping your
cap to the crowd.
It's not that there's something wrong
with having Reggie as a role model. I
still like the guy; I even take my car to
his dealership on El Camino Real for
servicing.
It's just that in a world where little
girls not only can't be Reggie Jackson
but also can't even be like him, it would
be a vast improvement to have some
women role models. Little girls who like
to throw or hit round things — and don't
get convinced that tennis is the only ap
propriate sport for someone of their
gender — need someone to be. Little girls
need to be able to step to the plate without
that odd dysfunctional moment when
they call themselves "Reggie."
That's why, although it probably wasn't
her favorite moment, the best thing I've
seen Stanford guard Jennifer Azzi do all
season happened Jan. 25 during the Car
dinal's pre-game tuneup for its win over
the University of Arizona. While the rest
of the squad shot lay-ups, Azzi, dressed
in street clothes and, wearing a brace on
her sprained ankle, stood amid a throng
of young girls — and, I suspect, some
young boys — and signed autographs.
When I played basketball as a kid, 1
sought autographs of local college players,
too. Only they had names like Steve and
Ed and Ernie.
Undoubtedly Azzi's three-page spread

in Sports Illustrated and two regular
season appearances on ESPN have made
her a role model for many who themselves
can't show up in Maples. Undoubtedly if
Sonja Henning, Katy Steding and the
rest of the team hadn't had to play, they,
too, would have been surrounded.
