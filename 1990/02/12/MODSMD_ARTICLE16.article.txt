## Confusion abounds following professor's speech 
### 
AN ARTICLE in The Daily of
Feb. 7 said that Cornell Sociol
ogy Prof. Victor Nee withdrew
his candidacy as "one of the Universi
ty's finalists for the Asian-American
scholar position" with a "denounce
ment" of ethnic studies as "moving
backwards."
But nowhere in the article is there a
full account of what Nee, a scholar
with excellent credentials, had to say.
We are told that "many advocates of
Asian-American studies were offended
and upset by Nee's criticism of institu
tionalized ethnic studies." But what,

precisely, did Nee say?
We are told that Nee "mis
represented himself' when "he spoke to
the community on Monday." But what
did he say?
"He (Nee) used it as a stage to
express his views on Asian-American
studies," we are further told. But what

We are told that 'many advocates of Asian-American
studies were offended and upset by Nee's criticism of
institutionalized ethnic studies.'

exactly are his views? What did he
say?
The article states that "no one
expected the shocking statements that
followed." What shocking statements?
What did he say?
It goes on to say that "Nee's surpris
ing statements threatened to make a

mockery of the entire process of selec
ting a scholar." Good grief, as Charlie
Brown would say. What in the world
did he say?
The story's headline read "Finalist's
withdrawal stuns Asian-Americans."
People around here are not stunned
that often by what happens on the
campus. Along comes a respected
visiting scholar who does just that â€”
but we aren't told what he said!
Why is that?
