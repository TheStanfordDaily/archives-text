# College HIV survey is not perfect but still valuable

Reuben Granich and Jonathan Mer
min's letter to the editor on Feb. 7
stated that Stanford's participation in
the HIV seroprevalence survey was
"flawed and irresponsible."
There is no question that the survey
design has limitations. Only those who
come to the student health service (50
percent of the student body — 6,400
students — in spring quarter, 1989)
are eligible for the study. Of this
group, only those from whom blood is
drawn are included, about 400 students
per month.
Consequently, the survey results
show the prevalence of the HIV an
tibody not for the whole student body,
but only among those who come to the
student health service and have blood
drawn.
Because we are, in fact, collecting
demographic information on this sub
sample, final data from the survey will
examine prevalence in a variety of sub

populations. Moreover, the goal of the
survey is to obtain samples on 10 per
cent of the student body, so that 1,300
samples — not a small number — will
be obtained.
Given the above limitations, should
the study not be done at all?
The current college survey is one of
a "family of serosurveys" being done
by the Centers for Disease Control.
Other populations being studied in
clude hospital admissions, newborns,
women's clinics, drug abuse clinics and
the military.
Although we may not achieve
statistical significance with the college
survey for any one campus, we may on
a nationwide basis. Every year of the
study more schools will be involved;
every year the survey will be more
finely tuned from an epidemiologic
standpoint; and it is hoped that every
year we will get a little closer to the
real seroprevalence in each of these
populations.
We feel that it is of great importance
to establish nationwide trends among
college students. Although the current
survey is still not perfect, as Granich
and Mermin accurately point out, we
feel that we have responsibly examined

the proposal and other options that
might exist, and we are proud to he a
part of this effort.
