# University should hire outside agency to streamline budget
## 
### 
It would appear that Stanford has
finally come to terms with its bloated
bureaucracy.
Provost James Rosses letter dated
Feb. 8 outlined measures to cut $22
million, or 13 percent, of the Univer
sity budget over the next 18 months.
Most of these cuts will be in staff and
administration. Rosse's statements are

laudable especially in light of his prom
ise not to increase indirect costs and to
keep tuition and board increases within
reason.
However, closer scrutiny of how
Rosse plans to implement needed belt
tightening measures is very dishearten
ing. Rosse expects the Street commit
tee to recommend specific changes for
reducing the budget. That would be
fine except that the people who are on
the Street committee are the same
people who got us into this mess in
the first place.
What the University really needs to
do is hire an independent organization
to look at how Stanford can become
"leaner and meaner." The fact is that
Stanford's financial problems are too
hi)' !,e handled by committees of
professors who may be experts in their
subjects but are certainly not experts
in knowing how to run a $1 billion
business in the most efficient way.
The sooner we realize this, the
sooner we can clean up the bureau
cratic largesse and get down to the
real business of the University.
