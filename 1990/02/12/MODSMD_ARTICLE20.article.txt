## Past university tensions have produced progress

OLD WINESKINS CANNOT
retain new wine. That biblical
metaphor aptly describes the
relationship between old institutions of
higher education and the arrival in the
1960s of black students with a new
attitude on America's college campuses.
Tonight's Eyes on the Prize broadcast,
"Ain't Gonna Shuffle No More," shows
how the collision of the old and the
new at Howard University created
temporary tension and conflict which
ultimately produced progress and
positive change.
Old wineskins.
Despite obvious differences, fascinat
ing parallels exist between Stanford
and Howard. While on opposite coasts
and serving different racial student
bodies, in historical origins, curriculum
content and educational mission, the
universities have much in common.
Howard was founded immediately
following the Civil War in 1867 to
socialize the newly-freed slaves.
Reflecting the outlook of the foun
ders, things black were not valued. As
late as 1967, Howard had no gospel
choir, students could not play jazz
music in the music room, and there
was just one course in black studies:
"Negro history." One Howard student
remarked, "After you got finished with
all the humanities and the Western

Civ-type of course, you couldn't fit
that one course in."
Stanford, too, had a "Western Civ
type" requirement, many humanities
courses and no Afro-American studies.
Neither were there many black stu
dents or professors. Not until the late
19605, during the height of the civil
rights movement, did the number of
black Stanford students exceed 100. By
that time, the philosophy, curriculum
and direction of higher education had
long been established, and people of
color were not in the picture.
New wine.
Then came the era of Black Power,
African independence, raised fists and
building takeovers. In the late 1950s
and 19605, a proud and assertive black
people embraced and reveled in their
heritage and culture that had been
denied and distorted for centuries.
Singing "Say it loud, I'm black and
I'm proud," wearing Afros and African
dashikis, and listening to John
Coltrane, a new generation of black
people emerged in the 19605.
Naturally, the young black Ameri
cans wanted to bring their culture onto
campus. Equally naturally, the essen
tially conservative institutions of
higher education resisted change. The
prospect of validating the ideas and
history of the people whose labor and

land had produced so much of
America's wealth troubled the Rockefel
lers, the Stanfords, the members of
Howard's Board of Trustees and other
Americans who owned much of that
wealth.
The clashes between the old and the
new at Stanford and at Howard were
painful, but ultimately positive. One
thousand students at Howard shut
down their administration building to
demand a reorientation of their institu
tion. During the occupation, the stu
dents played John Coltrane music,
listened to Malcolm X speeches, and
conducted classes in black history.
They wanted to transform the curricu
lum and to break free from the ivory
tower and make ties with the black
community.
Some 3,000 miles away, Stanford —
and scores of other schools — followed
Howard's example. Just as Howard
students reached the point where they
could not allow business to proceed as
usual, so too did Stanford's Black
Student Union find it necessary to
voice its concerns during a University
convocation. After displacing the
provost from the microphone in April
1968, the BSU issued 10 demands to
fight racism and walked out to a
standing ovation. Those demands were
the seeds of the multiculturalism that

is flowering at Stanford today.
The demands raised on both coasts
and in most states in between were
quite similar: more financial aid, in
creased admission of students of color,
more faculty of color. In short, they
wanted a multicultural university.
The confrontations were often pain
ful, but much progress has resulted.
Today, dozens of schools have black
studies programs, the number of black
faculty has grown significantly, and
multicultural education is widely ac
cepted as an important educational
goal.
But much unfinished business re
mains. Twenty years later, America's
colleges and universities have not
fundamentally changed. The wineskins
are not yet new. And so, we have
witnessed a replay of the growth proc
ess that took place in the 19605.
In March 1989, Howard students
again seized their administration build
ing to demand a student voice on the
Board of Trustees, academic credit for
community service and a graduate
program in African-American studies.
Once again, America's college students
emulated Howard by taking over build
ings to draw attention to neglected, yet
critical concerns.
The essence of the demands has not
changed. While many college and uni

versity leaders verbally validate the
vision of change, the real test comes
when budgets are divided and funds
apportioned.
As recent events in Southern Africa
and Eastern Europe demonstrate, a
new world is emerging. The institu
tions — educational, political and
economic — that shape people's rela
tions to one another must change
accordingly. This is one world with
many different people and many differ
ent cultures. Our educational system
must prepare a new generation to live
in, contribute to and improve the
emerging new world. We need new
wineskins for new wine.

standing ovation. Those demands were
the seeds of the multiculturalism that

is flowering at Stanford today.
The demands raised on both coasts
and in most states in between were
quite similar: more financial aid, in
creased admission of students of color,
more faculty of color. In short, they
wanted a multicultural university.
The confrontations were often pain
ful, but much progress has resulted.
Today, dozens of schools have black
studies programs, the number of black
faculty has grown significantly, and
multicultural education is widely ac
cepted as an important educational
goal.
But much unfinished business re
mains. Twenty years later, America's
colleges and universities have not
fundamentally changed. The wineskins
are not yet new. And so, we have
witnessed a replay of the growth proc
ess that took place in the 19605.
In March 1989, Howard students
again seized their administration build
ing to demand a student voice on the
Board of Trustees, academic credit for
community service and a graduate
program in African-American studies.
Once again, America's college students
emulated Howard by taking over build
ings to draw attention to neglected, yet
critical concerns.
The essence of the demands has not
changed. While many college and uni

versity leaders verbally validate the
vision of change, the real test comes
when budgets are divided and funds
apportioned.
As recent events in Southern Africa
and Eastern Europe demonstrate, a
new world is emerging. The institu
tions — educational, political and
economic — that shape people's rela
tions to one another must change
accordingly. This is one world with
many different people and many differ
ent cultures. Our educational system
must prepare a new generation to live
in, contribute to and improve the
emerging new world. We need new
wineskins for new wine.

Black History
OLD WINESKINS CANNOT
retain new wine. That biblical
metaphor aptly describes the
relationship between old institutions of
higher education and the arrival in the
1960s of black students with a new
attitude on America's college campuses.
Tonight's Eyes on the Prize broadcast,
"Ain't Gonna Shuffle No More," shows
how the collision of the old and the
new at Howard University created
temporary tension and conflict which
ultimately produced progress and
positive change.
Old wineskins.
Despite obvious differences, fascinat
ing parallels exist between Stanford
and Howard. While on opposite coasts
and serving different racial student
bodies, in historical origins, curriculum
content and educational mission, the
universities have much in common.
Howard was founded immediately
following the Civil War in 1867 to
socialize the newly-freed slaves.
Reflecting the outlook of the foun
ders, things black were not valued. As
late as 1967, Howard had no gospel
choir, students could not play jazz
music in the music room, and there
was just one course in black studies:
"Negro history." One Howard student
remarked, "After you got finished with
all the humanities and the Western

Civ-type of course, you couldn't fit
that one course in."
Stanford, too, had a "Western Civ
type" requirement, many humanities
courses and no Afro-American studies.
Neither were there many black stu
dents or professors. Not until the late
19605, during the height of the civil
rights movement, did the number of
black Stanford students exceed 100. By
that time, the philosophy, curriculum
and direction of higher education had
long been established, and people of
color were not in the picture.
New wine.
Then came the era of Black Power,
African independence, raised fists and
building takeovers. In the late 1950s
and 19605, a proud and assertive black
people embraced and reveled in their
heritage and culture that had been
denied and distorted for centuries.
Singing "Say it loud, I'm black and
I'm proud," wearing Afros and African
dashikis, and listening to John
Coltrane, a new generation of black
people emerged in the 19605.
Naturally, the young black Ameri
cans wanted to bring their culture onto
campus. Equally naturally, the essen
tially conservative institutions of
higher education resisted change. The
prospect of validating the ideas and
history of the people whose labor and

land had produced so much of
America's wealth troubled the Rockefel
lers, the Stanfords, the members of
Howard's Board of Trustees and other
Americans who owned much of that
wealth.
The clashes between the old and the
new at Stanford and at Howard were
painful, but ultimately positive. One
thousand students at Howard shut
down their administration building to
demand a reorientation of their institu
tion. During the occupation, the stu
dents played John Coltrane music,
listened to Malcolm X speeches, and
conducted classes in black history.
They wanted to transform the curricu
lum and to break free from the ivory
tower and make ties with the black
community.
Some 3,000 miles away, Stanford —
and scores of other schools — followed
Howard's example. Just as Howard
students reached the point where they
could not allow business to proceed as
usual, so too did Stanford's Black
Student Union find it necessary to
voice its concerns during a University
convocation. After displacing the
provost from the microphone in April
1968, the BSU issued 10 demands to
fight racism and walked out to a
standing ovation. Those demands were
the seeds of the multiculturalism that

is flowering at Stanford today.
