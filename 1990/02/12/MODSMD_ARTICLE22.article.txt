## Wingate, Vlahov make UW pay for 'insults' 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
In the beginning of the season, Stanford men's
basketball opponents had only to concentrate on
stopping center Adam Keefe. The other starting big
men, forwards Deshon Wingate and Andrew Vlahov,
had failed to distinguish themselves.
Yesterday, the Washington Huskies banked on
the continuance of this trend and concentrated on
stopping Keefe and the Cardinal guards.
Left open by defenders helping out on other
players, Wingate took the challenge and tallied 22
points and 14 rebounds, both career highs. Vlahov
added 13 points to his five rebounds, three assists,
two blocks, two steals, and rock-solid defense.
Wingate also played stellar defense, trading off
with Vlahov to limit the Huskies' only hot hand,
sky-walking forward Dion Brown, to four points in
the second half.
But it was their contribution on the offensive end
that had everyone talking.
"We thought we had to make the other two guys
[Wingate and Vlahov] prove themselves," Washing
ton Coach Lynn Nance said. Nance said the plan
was a "make-shift deal," that proved to be a "crazy
idea."
Nance's crazy idea was also "insulting" to Win
gate, who quickly took advantage of the inattention.
He scored eight points in the first four minutes of
the contest.
"They were daring me to shoot," Wingate said.
"It is kind of insulting. It showed that they didn't
respect me."
Wingate hit shots from midrange and outside, as
well as several tip-ins and put-backs and one spec
tacular alley-oop slam off a feed from Vlahov. But
Wingate still sees his job as more that of a role
player, not a featured offensive threat.
"If I do my job, it takes the pressure off the rest
of the team," Wingate said.
Still, Wingate has been getting "more and more
aggressive offensively since the beginning of the
season," Vlahov commented.
Vlahov, for his part, quietly threaded Washington's
"triangle and two" defense with driving bank shots
and following inside lay-ups.
"They try to make you anxious," Vlahov said.
"But I just took my time."
