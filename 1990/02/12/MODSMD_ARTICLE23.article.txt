Coming into yesterday's game against
Stanford, Washington basketball Coach
Lynn Nance had a plan. Realizing that
center Adam Keefe is far and away the
Cardinal's leading scorer he packed in three
guys on him.
But he knew that Stanford guards John
Patrick and Kenny Ammann had hurt
teams that had placed too much emphasis
on Keefe. So in addition to the three-man
zone, he had his guards play those two
man-to-man.
Nance's plan was to let Stanford's other
front-line players, Deshon Wingate and
Andrew Vlahov, have open shots and hope
Keefe didn't score too much. Unfortunately
for Nance, his plan worked only too well.
Wingate exploded for 22 points and 14
rebounds, both career highs, and Vlahov
chipped in 13 points to lead the Cardinal
to a 59-48 win over Nance's Huskies.
"It was a crazy idea," Nance said after
the game. "I thought that was the way we
had to guard this particular team at this
particular time. . . . Actually the defense
didn't beat us. We had an offensive drought
there for a while and I thought that beat
us."
"When I got out there I just saw they
were daring me to shoot," Wingate said.
"I felt I had the hot hand. I felt to help
the team I had to be an offensive threat. . . .
Anytime someone dares you to shoot and
you do and shoot it in, it feels good."
Stanford held Washington to .385 shoot
ing from the floor and the Huskies' 48
points was the least made by an opponent
this year.
The Cardinal is now 14-7 overall, 6-6
and tied with Oregon for fifth in the Pacific
10 Conference. Washington is now 9-13
overall, 3-10 and ninth in the Pac-10.
Nance's defense did its job as Keefe, hin
dered by an injured ankle, suffered earlier
in the week, scored only nine points on
2-of-8 shooting but added seven boards.

Patrick and Ammann combined to take
only seven shots but did a good job on the
defensive end.
All-league guard Eldridge Recasner had
a team-high 19 points for the Huskies but
the Washington guards made only 9 of 27
shots for the game.
Wingate had eight points as Stanford
jumped out to a 13-3 lead but the Huskies
scored the next seven points. The Cardinal
held the lead throughout the first half, but
the basketball was not pretty.
Stanford shot .346 while Washington hit
less than 27 percent of its shots in the
half. There were also 16 fouls called before
intermission as the officiating looked hap
hazard.
"I don't know what they were really
thinking about," Wingate said.
The Huskies opened the second half with
a 14-5 run to take a six-point lead, but
then Stanford came back. Wingate scored
10 points as the Cardinal cruised out to a
49-41 lead it would never relinquish. Recas
ner hit a three-pointer and Mike Hayward
hit a leaner from about 10 feet to cut the
Cardinal lead to three with 1:55 to go.
Wingate made both ends of a one-and-one
and after a couple of blown possessions,
Stanford called timeout. During the
timeout Nance got hit with a technical
foul, effectively ending the game.
"I felt like it got to the point where we
didn't have any respect," he said. "It got
to the point where it was ridiculous. I had
to do what I had to do. We were working
hard and I thought we deserved better
than that."
Ammann sank the two technical shots
and Wingate hit both ends of another one
and-one to make it 55-46. After Recasner
scored on a fine baseline drive, Patrick
made a pair of free throws with 12 seconds
left. Vlahov had a two-handed break-away
dunk at the buzzer for the final margin.
"That concludes a much-needed and very
nice weekend for us," Montgomery said.
"The second half we had a much
better effort, with patience on of
fense and intensity on defense."
"This game was really big,"
Wingate said. "A friend of mine,
a guy who played here before,
Howard Wright, he told me before
the game, 'If you lose this game
it could be the season.' "
Stanford travels south this
weekend to face eighth-place USC
Thursday night and third-place
UCLA Sunday. The Cardinal is
currently 1-5 on the road in Pac-10
games and will be looking for a
chance to move up in the stand
ings. "We have a chance to finish
up there if we hang in there and
work hard," Montgomery said.

intermission as the officiating looked hap
hazard.
"I don't know what they were really
thinking about," Wingate said.
The Huskies opened the second half with
a 14-5 run to take a six-point lead, but
then Stanford came back. Wingate scored
10 points as the Cardinal cruised out to a
49-41 lead it would never relinquish. Recas
ner hit a three-pointer and Mike Hayward
hit a leaner from about 10 feet to cut the
Cardinal lead to three with 1:55 to go.
Wingate made both ends of a one-and-one
and after a couple of blown possessions,
Stanford called timeout. During the
timeout Nance got hit with a technical
foul, effectively ending the game.
"I felt like it got to the point where we
didn't have any respect," he said. "It got
to the point where it was ridiculous. I had
to do what I had to do. We were working
hard and I thought we deserved better
than that."
Ammann sank the two technical shots
and Wingate hit both ends of another one
and-one to make it 55-46. After Recasner
scored on a fine baseline drive, Patrick
made a pair of free throws with 12 seconds
left. Vlahov had a two-handed break-away
dunk at the buzzer for the final margin.
"That concludes a much-needed and very
nice weekend for us," Montgomery said.
"The second half we had a much
better effort, with patience on of
fense and intensity on defense."
"This game was really big,"
Wingate said. "A friend of mine,
a guy who played here before,
Howard Wright, he told me before
the game, 'If you lose this game
it could be the season.' "
Stanford travels south this
weekend to face eighth-place USC
Thursday night and third-place
UCLA Sunday. The Cardinal is
currently 1-5 on the road in Pac-10
games and will be looking for a
chance to move up in the stand
ings. "We have a chance to finish
up there if we hang in there and
work hard," Montgomery said.
Coming into yesterday's game against
Stanford, Washington basketball Coach
Lynn Nance had a plan. Realizing that
center Adam Keefe is far and away the
Cardinal's leading scorer he packed in three
guys on him.
But he knew that Stanford guards John
Patrick and Kenny Ammann had hurt
teams that had placed too much emphasis
on Keefe. So in addition to the three-man
zone, he had his guards play those two
man-to-man.
Nance's plan was to let Stanford's other
front-line players, Deshon Wingate and
Andrew Vlahov, have open shots and hope
Keefe didn't score too much. Unfortunately
for Nance, his plan worked only too well.
Wingate exploded for 22 points and 14
rebounds, both career highs, and Vlahov
chipped in 13 points to lead the Cardinal
to a 59-48 win over Nance's Huskies.
"It was a crazy idea," Nance said after
the game. "I thought that was the way we
had to guard this particular team at this
particular time. . . . Actually the defense
didn't beat us. We had an offensive drought
there for a while and I thought that beat
us."
"When I got out there I just saw they
were daring me to shoot," Wingate said.
"I felt I had the hot hand. I felt to help
the team I had to be an offensive threat. . . .
Anytime someone dares you to shoot and
you do and shoot it in, it feels good."
Stanford held Washington to .385 shoot
ing from the floor and the Huskies' 48
points was the least made by an opponent
this year.
The Cardinal is now 14-7 overall, 6-6
and tied with Oregon for fifth in the Pacific
10 Conference. Washington is now 9-13
overall, 3-10 and ninth in the Pac-10.
Nance's defense did its job as Keefe, hin
dered by an injured ankle, suffered earlier
in the week, scored only nine points on
2-of-8 shooting but added seven boards.

Patrick and Ammann combined to take
only seven shots but did a good job on the
defensive end.
All-league guard Eldridge Recasner had
a team-high 19 points for the Huskies but
the Washington guards made only 9 of 27
shots for the game.
Wingate had eight points as Stanford
jumped out to a 13-3 lead but the Huskies
scored the next seven points. The Cardinal
held the lead throughout the first half, but
the basketball was not pretty.
Stanford shot .346 while Washington hit
less than 27 percent of its shots in the
half. There were also 16 fouls called before
intermission as the officiating looked hap
hazard.
"I don't know what they were really
thinking about," Wingate said.
