# Make that 20-1 — Washington ends Cardinal's streak
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE — The Cardinal lost
the battle. Maybe in the end, it
will help them win the war.
After dismantling the Washing
ton Huskies in Maples Pavilion a
month ago, the Stanford women's
basketball team entered Satur
day's rematch confident they
would record another win. In
stead, the Huskies handed Stan
ford its first loss of the season
and, in so doing, may have pro
vided the extra dose of motivation
that will vault the Cardinal to a
national title.
Before a sellout crowd of 7,704
in Hec Edmundson Pavilion,
Washington led most of the way
en route to an 81-78 victory over
the nation's No. 2 team. The
Huskies are now 19-2, 10-1 and
tied with the Cardinal for first
place in Pacific 10 Conference
play. Stanford's record stands at
20-1.

Huskies 81
Cardinal 78

When Washington lost to Stan
ford 102-62 in Maples Pavilion, it
hit rock bottom. Saturday, the
Huskies were flying high and
celebrating as if they had won the
NCAA Championship.
The Cardinal, on the other
hand, took its first setback as an
opportunity to reflect and reded
icate itself to winning its first na
tional crown.
"A lot of people say you can
learn more by losing a game,"
Jennifer Azzi said afterward. "I'm
definitely going to work
harder. ... I just think we really
need to work harder."
Azzi added she hoped the defeat
would "make people mad enough"
to do something about it. In the
1988-89 season, Stanford's disap

pointing defeat allowed them no
chance to recover. "Last year, it
came at Louisiana Tech (in the
NCAA tournament), and it was
too late."
Noting the Cardinal may have
been a little "complacent," Stan
ford Coach said:
"A lot of times we can win not
doing the right thing. If we had
pulled the game out [our players]
wouldn't be saying, 'We didn't set
screens, we didn't box out.'
"We have some people in a coin
fort zone," she added. "They have
to get out of it. . . . Hopefully, the
loss will get their attention." Van-
Derveer explained that it would
lend credence to the coaching
staff's pleadings when they warn
the team what could happen if
they fail to execute at a high level.
"We can't just show up," Van-
Derveer said.
Of course, all the post-mortems
would never have been uttered
had Stanford won the game. And
the Cardinal almost did.

With 2:31 left on the game
clock, Katy Steding hit a three
pointer to give Stanford a 73-71
lead — its first since holding a
16-15 advantage midway through
the first half.
But the Husky women an
swered the challenge with six
straight points on a layin by Amy
Mickelson and two baskets from
Laurie Merlino. Mickelson, who
led Washington with 24 points,
and Merlino, who chipped in 22,
were the big guns for the Huskies
all night long. The duo missed
only five shots while hitting 17.
After Merlino's second hoop,
Steding buried a 15-footer from
the left baseline to make it 77-75,
Washington. The Cardinal called
a timeout. When play resumed
Stanford aggressively went for the
steal without worrying about
fouling the Huskies.
In a twist of fate VanDerveer
termed "ironic," Stanford only
had three team fouls at the time.
The Cardinal began using them,

but because Washington was not
in the bonus, Stanford could not
put them at the free throw line.
Three times, Cardinal players
fouled; three times the Huskies
inbounded the ball and ran more
time off the clock. By the time
Sonja Henning fouled Merlino,
only 14 ticks remained. Merlino
hit both ends of the one-and-one
and gave Washington a 79-75
edge.
Azzi quickly hit a three-pointer
to cut the lead to one and called
another timeout with seven
seconds left in the game. But
Stanford was out of timeouts and
was therefore assessed a technical
foul.
"Jennifer knew we needed a
timeout," VanDerveer said. "I
should have saved one for her and
1 didn't." Regardless, if Azzi did
not call the timeout, Washington
could have let the ball roll around
for a couple of seconds, pick it up
and run the clock out without get
ting it inbounds.

Azzi had accidentally given the
Cardinal one glimmer of hope. It
dimmed considerably, though,
when Merlino, who was 9 of 10
from the line, knocked down both
foul shots.
"I wanted the ball. I wanted to
be at that free throw line," Mer
lino said. "To be in that situation
there was no way I was going to
let my team down."
The Huskies then got to in
bound the ball because of the tech
nical. Martha Richards fouled
Traci Thirdgill immediately. With
all of Washington's players back
on defense, Thirdgill went to shoot
the one-and-one. She missed, but
beat three Stanford players to the
ball in the corner and time ex
pired.
Washington Coach Chris
Gobrecht was surprisingly con
ciliatory after the game. Following
the loss in Maples, Gobrecht re
turned to Seattle to talk trash
about the Cardinal. She said the
team was high on the Huskies'
"hate" list and added, "We have
always struggled with the fact
that Stanford was given respect
before it earned it and at our ex
pense."
The remarks earned her a rep
rimand from the school's athletic
director, Mike Lude, and may
have led her to change her tune.
Said Gobrecht Saturday: "1 know
we're not the best team in the
nation. But Stanford might be.
We played in front of the most
incredible crowd I've ever seen
and still only won by three points.
"But it shows what can happen
when we put it all together," she
added.
Put it all together, indeed.
Washington outshot and out
rebounded the Cardinal, commit
ted fewer turnovers and dished
out more assists. The Huskies
seemed to gain confidence as the
game went along, believing more

and more they could win the
game.
Washington was particularly
tenacious on defense as it denied
Stanford's post people the ball in
the first half. Trisha Stevens,
whose 21 points were tops for the
Cardinal, got only three shots in
the opening 20 minutes. Val
Whiting and Julie Zeilstra —
Stanford's other low-post options
— combined for only five first
half shots.
The Huskies, on the other
hand, had their way down low.
Mickelson, Washington's 6-foot-3
center, missed just one shot as
she scored 14 points before the
intermission to help lead her team
to a 42-35 halftime edge.
"We were not playing with the
intensity we needed defensively,"
VanDerveer said. "A lot of the
things they did, we wanted to do.
"We count on some people who
weren't able to pick up the slack,"
she added.
VanDerveer did not mention
any names, but several of Stan
ford's top six players were as in
effective as they had been at any
time this season. And, in each

case, the Stanford women made
critical contributions as well.
Steding was only 5 of 15 from
the field, but hit the big baskets
in Stanford's 14-2 run that turned
a 69-60 deficit into a short-lived
lead.
Henning committed a season
high six turnovers — more than
she would make in a normal week
end — but provided 40 minutes
of floor leadership that kept
things from getting chaotic.
Whiting connected on just 1 of 4
shots, yet blocked three shots to
key the Cardinal's defensive
charge in the second half.
"I try to go into practice every
day like we lost the game the
night before," VanDerveer said.
Today, she and the Stanford team
will all hit the practice court
having actually experienced that
loss. If they learn their lessons
well, they may not have the
feeling again this season.

The remarks earned her a rep
rimand from the school's athletic

Said Gobrecht Saturday: "1 know
we're not the best team in the

We played in front of the most
incredible crowd I've ever seen
and still only won by three points.
"But it shows what can happen

Put it all together, indeed.
Washington outshot and out
rebounded the Cardinal, commit

out more assists. The Huskies
seemed to gain confidence as the
game went along, believing more

and more they could win the
game.
Washington was particularly
tenacious on defense as it denied
Stanford's post people the ball in
the first half. Trisha Stevens,
whose 21 points were tops for the
Cardinal, got only three shots in
the opening 20 minutes. Val
Whiting and Julie Zeilstra —
Stanford's other low-post options
— combined for only five first
half shots.
The Huskies, on the other
hand, had their way down low.
Mickelson, Washington's 6-foot-3
center, missed just one shot as
she scored 14 points before the
intermission to help lead her team
to a 42-35 halftime edge.
"We were not playing with the
intensity we needed defensively,"
VanDerveer said. "A lot of the

"We count on some people who

she added.
VanDerveer did not mention
any names, but several of Stan
ford's top six players were as in
effective as they had been at any
time this season. And, in each

case, the Stanford women made
critical contributions as well.
Steding was only 5 of 15 from
the field, but hit the big baskets
in Stanford's 14-2 run that turned
a 69-60 deficit into a short-lived
lead.
Henning committed a season
high six turnovers — more than
she would make in a normal week
end — but provided 40 minutes
of floor leadership that kept
things from getting chaotic.
Whiting connected on just 1 of 4
shots, yet blocked three shots to
key the Cardinal's defensive
charge in the second half.
"I try to go into practice every

Huskies 81
Cardinal 78

When Washington lost to Stan
ford 102-62 in Maples Pavilion, it
hit rock bottom. Saturday, the
Huskies were flying high and
celebrating as if they had won the
NCAA Championship.
The Cardinal, on the other
hand, took its first setback as an
opportunity to reflect and reded
icate itself to winning its first na
tional crown.
"A lot of people say you can
learn more by losing a game,"
Jennifer Azzi said afterward. "I'm
definitely going to work
harder. ... I just think we really
need to work harder."
Azzi added she hoped the defeat
would "make people mad enough"
to do something about it. In the
1988-89 season, Stanford's disap

pointing defeat allowed them no
chance to recover. "Last year, it
came at Louisiana Tech (in the
NCAA tournament), and it was
too late."
Noting the Cardinal may have
been a little "complacent," Stan
ford Coach said:
"A lot of times we can win not
doing the right thing. If we had
pulled the game out [our players]
wouldn't be saying, 'We didn't set
screens, we didn't box out.'
"We have some people in a coin
fort zone," she added. "They have
to get out of it. . . . Hopefully, the
loss will get their attention." Van-
Derveer explained that it would
lend credence to the coaching
staff's pleadings when they warn
the team what could happen if
they fail to execute at a high level.
"We can't just show up," Van-
Derveer said.
Of course, all the post-mortems
would never have been uttered
had Stanford won the game. And
the Cardinal almost did.

With 2:31 left on the game
clock, Katy Steding hit a three
pointer to give Stanford a 73-71
lead — its first since holding a
16-15 advantage midway through
the first half.
But the Husky women an
swered the challenge with six
straight points on a layin by Amy
Mickelson and two baskets from
Laurie Merlino. Mickelson, who
led Washington with 24 points,
and Merlino, who chipped in 22,
were the big guns for the Huskies
all night long. The duo missed
only five shots while hitting 17.
After Merlino's second hoop,
Steding buried a 15-footer from
the left baseline to make it 77-75,
Washington. The Cardinal called
a timeout. When play resumed
Stanford aggressively went for the
steal without worrying about
fouling the Huskies.
In a twist of fate VanDerveer
termed "ironic," Stanford only
had three team fouls at the time.
The Cardinal began using them,

but because Washington was not
in the bonus, Stanford could not
put them at the free throw line.
Three times, Cardinal players
fouled; three times the Huskies
inbounded the ball and ran more
time off the clock. By the time
Sonja Henning fouled Merlino,
only 14 ticks remained. Merlino
hit both ends of the one-and-one
and gave Washington a 79-75
edge.
Azzi quickly hit a three-pointer
to cut the lead to one and called
another timeout with seven
seconds left in the game. But
Stanford was out of timeouts and
was therefore assessed a technical
foul.
"Jennifer knew we needed a
timeout," VanDerveer said. "I
should have saved one for her and
1 didn't." Regardless, if Azzi did
not call the timeout, Washington
could have let the ball roll around
for a couple of seconds, pick it up
and run the clock out without get
ting it inbounds.

Azzi had accidentally given the
Cardinal one glimmer of hope. It
dimmed considerably, though,
when Merlino, who was 9 of 10
from the line, knocked down both
foul shots.
"I wanted the ball. I wanted to
be at that free throw line," Mer
lino said. "To be in that situation
there was no way I was going to
let my team down."
The Huskies then got to in
bound the ball because of the tech
nical. Martha Richards fouled
Traci Thirdgill immediately. With
all of Washington's players back
on defense, Thirdgill went to shoot
the one-and-one. She missed, but
beat three Stanford players to the
ball in the corner and time ex
pired.
Washington Coach Chris
Gobrecht was surprisingly con
ciliatory after the game. Following

led Washington with 24 points,
and Merlino, who chipped in 22,
were the big guns for the Huskies
all night long. The duo missed
only five shots while hitting 17.
After Merlino's second hoop,
Steding buried a 15-footer from
the left baseline to make it 77-75,
Washington. The Cardinal called
a timeout. When play resumed
Stanford aggressively went for the
steal without worrying about
fouling the Huskies.
In a twist of fate VanDerveer
termed "ironic," Stanford only
had three team fouls at the time.
The Cardinal began using them,

but because Washington was not
in the bonus, Stanford could not
put them at the free throw line.
Three times, Cardinal players
fouled; three times the Huskies
inbounded the ball and ran more
time off the clock. By the time
Sonja Henning fouled Merlino,
only 14 ticks remained. Merlino
hit both ends of the one-and-one
and gave Washington a 79-75
edge.
Azzi quickly hit a three-pointer
to cut the lead to one and called
another timeout with seven
seconds left in the game. But
Stanford was out of timeouts and
was therefore assessed a technical
foul.
"Jennifer knew we needed a
timeout," VanDerveer said. "I
should have saved one for her and
1 didn't." Regardless, if Azzi did
not call the timeout, Washington
could have let the ball roll around
for a couple of seconds, pick it up
and run the clock out without get
ting it inbounds.

Azzi had accidentally given the
Cardinal one glimmer of hope. It
dimmed considerably, though,
when Merlino, who was 9 of 10
from the line, knocked down both
foul shots.
"I wanted the ball. I wanted to
be at that free throw line," Mer
lino said. "To be in that situation
there was no way I was going to
let my team down."
The Huskies then got to in
bound the ball because of the tech
nical. Martha Richards fouled
Traci Thirdgill immediately. With
all of Washington's players back
on defense, Thirdgill went to shoot
the one-and-one. She missed, but
beat three Stanford players to the
ball in the corner and time ex
pired.
Washington Coach Chris
Gobrecht was surprisingly con
ciliatory after the game. Following
the loss in Maples, Gobrecht re
turned to Seattle to talk trash
about the Cardinal. She said the
team was high on the Huskies'
"hate" list and added, "We have
always struggled with the fact
that Stanford was given respect
before it earned it and at our ex
pense."
The remarks earned her a rep
rimand from the school's athletic
director, Mike Lude, and may
have led her to change her tune.
Said Gobrecht Saturday: "1 know
we're not the best team in the
nation. But Stanford might be.
We played in front of the most
incredible crowd I've ever seen
and still only won by three points.
"But it shows what can happen
when we put it all together," she
added.
Put it all together, indeed.
Washington outshot and out
rebounded the Cardinal, commit
ted fewer turnovers and dished
out more assists. The Huskies
seemed to gain confidence as the
game went along, believing more

and more they could win the
game.
Washington was particularly
tenacious on defense as it denied
Stanford's post people the ball in
the first half. Trisha Stevens,
whose 21 points were tops for the
Cardinal, got only three shots in
the opening 20 minutes. Val
Whiting and Julie Zeilstra —
Stanford's other low-post options
— combined for only five first
half shots.
The Huskies, on the other
hand, had their way down low.
Mickelson, Washington's 6-foot-3
center, missed just one shot as
she scored 14 points before the
intermission to help lead her team
to a 42-35 halftime edge.
"We were not playing with the
intensity we needed defensively,"
VanDerveer said. "A lot of the
things they did, we wanted to do.
"We count on some people who
weren't able to pick up the slack,"
she added.
VanDerveer did not mention
any names, but several of Stan
ford's top six players were as in
effective as they had been at any
time this season. And, in each

case, the Stanford women made
critical contributions as well.
Steding was only 5 of 15 from
the field, but hit the big baskets
in Stanford's 14-2 run that turned
a 69-60 deficit into a short-lived
lead.
Henning committed a season
high six turnovers — more than
she would make in a normal week
end — but provided 40 minutes
of floor leadership that kept
things from getting chaotic.
Whiting connected on just 1 of 4
shots, yet blocked three shots to
key the Cardinal's defensive
charge in the second half.
"I try to go into practice every
day like we lost the game the
night before," VanDerveer said.
Today, she and the Stanford team
will all hit the practice court
having actually experienced that
loss. If they learn their lessons
well, they may not have the
feeling again this season.
