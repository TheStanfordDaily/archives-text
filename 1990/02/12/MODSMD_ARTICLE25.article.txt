# Swimmers catch Bears hibernating
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Saturday was a day of upsets
in the world of sports: Mike
Tyson lost his heavyweight
crown. The Cardinal women's
basketball team lost a game. And
the Stanford women's swim
team lost a meet.
Okay, maybe that's stretching
it a bit too far. The truth is, the
swim team didn't really lose. In
fact, as usual, the meet wasn't
even close.
Closing out the dual-meet
season the way the team began
it, the Cardinal hammered a UC
school. In the opener it was UC-
Santa Barbara; yesterday it was
fourth-ranked California, by a
112-28 score.

Women's Swimming

Cardinal 112
Golden Bears 28

While the Golden Bears didn't
swim all their best swimmers in
their top events, Stanford
showed its cross-Bay rivals that
they were clearly overmatched.
"First of all I think it's ridic
ulous for a team to come all the
way over here and not swim
their best people in their best
events," Stanford Coach Richard
Quick said. "They're the fourth
ranked team in the nation 9
Today they looked more like No.
40. . . . But our team swam well.
I'm pleased."
While four Stanford seniors
made their final deGuerre ap
perances and combined to win
four events, the most memorable
performance came from a fresh

man. Lori Heisick won the 100-
yard breaststroke in a time of
1:01.38, smashing her own pool
record and breaking the school
and Pacific 10 Conference record
held by Susie Rapp, a 1984
Olympic silver medalist. Heisick
has the nation's fastest time in
that event by more than two
seconds.
"I didn't think I'd swim that
fast because I wasn't swimming
that fast in practice this week,"
Heisick said. "It was a surprise.
A very pleasant surprise."
Cardinal junior Michelle

Griglione also got her name in
the record books, breaking her
own deGuerre pool record in the
400 individual medley. "I was
surprised about that because I
didn't feel that great during the
swim," she said. "I think I'm
swimming better this year. ... I
think I did more conditioning
work and more stroke work and
I think it's going to pay off at
the end."
Senior co-captain Susannah
Miller won her only two races
of the day, the 100 backstroke
and the 200 IM, to close out her

dual-meet career. Senior Bet
hanne Lambert just missed her
career-best time in taking second
to Heisick in the 100 breast
stroke and came back to nose
out classmate Jill Johnson in the
200 breaststroke.
Katie Connors also won her
final home competition, the
three-meter diving. Connors had
earlier taken third in the one
meter competition. Sophomore
Melisa Kuller took second off
both boards, leaving diving

this year In a meet this weekend at deGuerre pool.
Coach Rick Schavone optimistic
for the remainder of the season.
"They're diving really well," he
said. "They're strong; they're
spinning fast; they're just not real
fine. They'll get finer with some
rest. I'm really happy. . . . It's sad
to see Katie graduate."
In addition to Miller and
Griglione, who won the 200 back
stroke as well as the 400 IM,
freshman Janel Jorgensen also
won two events. Jorgensen missed
the pool record in the 100 butter
fly by .20 seconds and missed the
pool record in the 200 butterfly
by .03 seconds, but won both
events handily.
"I think we swam really well,"
Griglione said. "I was really sur
prised after last week (when Stan
ford crushed No. 2 Texas). The
attitude was a little different."
After finishing the dual-meet
season with a perfect 8-0 record,
including convincing wins over
teams ranked No. 2, 4, 6, 7, 8,
11 and 14 in the nation, Stanford
will now get ready for the Pac-10

Championships two weeks from
now. The Cardinal has already
qualified 14 swimmers for the
NCAA Championships and would
like to up that number to 17, the
maximum a team can bring, at
the Pac-10 meet.
The league meet will be held at
East Los Angeles Junior College
Feb. 23-25. The Cardinal has
dominated the meet every year
since the Pac-10 recognized wom
en's swimming in the 1987 season.
Last year Stanford defeated
runner-up Cal by more than 400
points and this year's team ap
pears to be at least as strong.
"I think we'll be closer than
this meet would indicate," Cal
Coach Karen Moe Thornton said.
"The Stanford team has so much
depth that I don't think we can
beat them, but we'll give it our
best shot."

Freshman Janet Evans was named
the U.S. Olympic Committee's

"They're diving really well," he
said. "They're strong; they're
spinning fast; they're just not real
fine. They'll get finer with some
rest. I'm really happy. . . . It's sad
to see Katie graduate."
In addition to Miller and
Griglione, who won the 200 back
stroke as well as the 400 IM,
freshman Janel Jorgensen also
won two events. Jorgensen missed
the pool record in the 100 butter
fly by .20 seconds and missed the
pool record in the 200 butterfly
by .03 seconds, but won both
events handily.
"I think we swam really well,"
Griglione said. "I was really sur
prised after last week (when Stan
ford crushed No. 2 Texas). The
attitude was a little different."
After finishing the dual-meet
season with a perfect 8-0 record,
including convincing wins over
teams ranked No. 2, 4, 6, 7, 8,
11 and 14 in the nation, Stanford
will now get ready for the Pac-10

Championships two weeks from
now. The Cardinal has already
qualified 14 swimmers for the
NCAA Championships and would
like to up that number to 17, the
maximum a team can bring, at
the Pac-10 meet.
The league meet will be held at
East Los Angeles Junior College
Feb. 23-25. The Cardinal has
dominated the meet every year
since the Pac-10 recognized wom
en's swimming in the 1987 season.
Last year Stanford defeated
runner-up Cal by more than 400
points and this year's team ap
pears to be at least as strong.
"I think we'll be closer than
this meet would indicate," Cal
Coach Karen Moe Thornton said.
"The Stanford team has so much
depth that I don't think we can
beat them, but we'll give it our
best shot."

Freshman Janet Evans was named
the U.S. Olympic Committee's
Sportswoman of the Year. Hurdler
Roger Kingdom, who, like Evans, was
a gold medalist in the 1988 Olympics
and a world record-setter in 1989,
was named the Sportsman of the Year.
Saturday was a day of upsets
in the world of sports: Mike
Tyson lost his heavyweight
crown. The Cardinal women's
basketball team lost a game. And
the Stanford women's swim
team lost a meet.
Okay, maybe that's stretching
it a bit too far. The truth is, the
swim team didn't really lose. In
fact, as usual, the meet wasn't
even close.
Closing out the dual-meet
season the way the team began
it, the Cardinal hammered a UC
school. In the opener it was UC-
Santa Barbara; yesterday it was
fourth-ranked California, by a
112-28 score.

Women's Swimming

Cardinal 112
Golden Bears 28

While the Golden Bears didn't
swim all their best swimmers in
their top events, Stanford
showed its cross-Bay rivals that
they were clearly overmatched.
"First of all I think it's ridic
ulous for a team to come all the
way over here and not swim
their best people in their best
events," Stanford Coach Richard
Quick said. "They're the fourth
ranked team in the nation 9
Today they looked more like No.
40. . . . But our team swam well.
I'm pleased."
While four Stanford seniors
made their final deGuerre ap
perances and combined to win
four events, the most memorable
performance came from a fresh

man. Lori Heisick won the 100-
yard breaststroke in a time of
1:01.38, smashing her own pool
record and breaking the school
and Pacific 10 Conference record
held by Susie Rapp, a 1984
Olympic silver medalist. Heisick
has the nation's fastest time in
that event by more than two
seconds.
"I didn't think I'd swim that
fast because I wasn't swimming
that fast in practice this week,"
Heisick said. "It was a surprise.
A very pleasant surprise."
Cardinal junior Michelle

Griglione also got her name in
the record books, breaking her
own deGuerre pool record in the
400 individual medley. "I was
surprised about that because I
didn't feel that great during the
swim," she said. "I think I'm
swimming better this year. ... I
think I did more conditioning
work and more stroke work and
I think it's going to pay off at
the end."
Senior co-captain Susannah
Miller won her only two races
of the day, the 100 backstroke
and the 200 IM, to close out her

dual-meet career. Senior Bet
hanne Lambert just missed her
career-best time in taking second
to Heisick in the 100 breast
stroke and came back to nose
out classmate Jill Johnson in the
200 breaststroke.
Katie Connors also won her
final home competition, the
three-meter diving. Connors had
earlier taken third in the one
meter competition. Sophomore
Melisa Kuller took second off
both boards, leaving diving
