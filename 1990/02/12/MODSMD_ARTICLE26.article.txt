# Stanford clouds the Rainbows' weekend

University of Hawaii fans,
whether they're jamming a vol
leyball arena or packing a baseball
stadium, tend to be quite loud.
But only when they have a little
something to cheer about.
The Rainbow rooters were
noticeably silent this weekend, as
the Stanford baseball team made
a little noise of its own. The Car
dinal pounded the Rainbows on
Friday and Saturday nights, and
then used speed and strong pitch
ing to complete the sweep on Sun
day.

Cardinal sweeps three
games from Rainbows

With the wins, Stanford is now
9-1 on the season and has a full
head of steam going into Friday's
Six-Pac opener at For their
part, the Rainbows are left to pick
up the mess left by the Cardinal
hurricane that stormed the is
lands.
Friday's contest, which was a
12-6 semi-blowout, was actually
the only "close" game of the se
ries. The Cardinal got on the
board immediately (Sunday's
game was the only time Stanford
didn't score in the top of the first)
as center fielder Jeff Hammonds
led off with a triple and scored
two batters later when David
McCarty also tripled. McCarty
came in on a Paul Carey single,
and two walks and a single later,
Rainbow starter Brady Perreira
was gone.

With two more runs in the sec
ond, starter Stan Spencer had a
5-0 lead to work with, which
usually is more than enough for
someone with an ERA of 0.00 on
the year. The Rainbows were able
to get at Spencer, though, touch
ing him up for two runs in the
second, fourth, and eighth in
nings. The runs in the fourth,
both unearned, cut the Cardinal
lead to 6-4.
That was as close as they got
— Troy Paulsen singled and
scored in the sixth, McCarty
tripled Hammonds home in the
eighth, and Carey then hit a mon
ster home run — he's now tied
for first place on Stanford's all
time list with 42 — to put the
game away.
Paulsen, making his first defen
sive start at second after sitting
out two weeks with a shoulder
ir\jury, ended up three-for-six with
two doubles and three runs.
The pounding continued in the
following night's 11-2 rout, led by
Paulsen's five-for-five, four-RBI
feast at the plate. The big story,
though, was pitcher Mike Mus
sina's total domination of the
Rainbows. Throwing his fastball
in excess of 90 mph, Mussina
stymied Hawaii for eight innings,
giving up all of four hits while
striking out 11.
The offense did all right as well,
scoring at least one run in each
of the first six innings. In fact,
by the time KZSU joined the game
in progress in the bottom of the
the third, Stanford was up five-zip
and Mussina was cruising to his
third win in three starts.
