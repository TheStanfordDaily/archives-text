On a weekend in which every
thing that was supposed to hap
pen in sports — Mike Tyson,
where were you? — didn't, one
constant remained.
The No. 2-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team (2-1) con
tinued its mastery of highly
ranked competition on Friday,
giving UC-Santa Barbara a four
game seminar in textbook volley
ball, 15-2, 15-6, 10-15, 15-6.

Men's Volleyball

Cardinal over the Gauchos
15-2, 15-6, 10-15, 15-6

Playing on the extra-bouncy
hardwood of Maples Pavilion did
little for the vertical leaps of the
Gauchos, as the Cardinal hit
through, over, and around the
Santa Barbara block throughout
the WIVA Conference match.
The bludgeoning was immedi
ately evident, as UCSB stumbled
onto the floor in the first game.
Despite a No. 8 national ranking,
the Gauchos showed little evidence
as to why they had commanded
so much respect from the Cardinal
coaching staff throughout the past
practice week.
"The first two games were
really good for us," said sopho
more swing hitter Duncan Black
man, who led the team in digs.
"I still think we could have played
better defense."
The Cardinal defense had little
trouble in the first game, however.
Spearheaded by three kills and a
block from sophomore David
Goss, Stanford commandeered an
early 8-0 advantage and left the
confidence of its opponents in
shambles. During the run, Santa

Barbara failed miserably in utiliz
ing its strength, a tough penchant
for siding out.
Following a single score by the
Gauchos, the Cardinal once again
donned its scholarly gowns and
proceeded to demonstrate a num
ber of advanced offensive schemes
Santa Barbara simply could not
follow.
After Hanan registered a rally
killing block at 9-1, setter Parker
Blackman ran the offense to near
perfection, utilizing each of his
multi-talented teammates. Swing
hitter John Alstrom seized the op
portunity to pound three consecu
tive balls around perplexed Santa
Barbara passers, contributing to
a 12-1 game score.
After another solitary strike by
UCSB, the Cardinal decided to

end the session and recessed
prevailing 15-2.
The second game followed in
much the same fashion as senior
middle blocker Craig Forsyth and
Hanan kept the ball plastered on
Santa Barbara's turf. Forsyth
pounded four kills and combined
with Goss on an animated block
during another lopsided 12-4
streak. Hanan squelched any
Gaucho comeback hopes at 12-6,
siding out for Stanford three
times with kills. Two Goss blocks
ended the game.
Following three setter changes
and facing the specter of another
sweep at the hands of Stanford,
Santa Barbara appeared to find
its stride in the third game.
Capitalizing on accomplished hit
ting from Mike Diehl, the Gauchos
managed an early 4-0 run.
After the Cardinal edged back
on some critical blocks, Santa Bar
bara fled ahead to an 11-5 advan
tage. Despite the concerted efforts
of Hanan who staved off a game
point at 10-14, Stanford was
forced to concede its first game
of the season at home.
"In the third game, we came
out really flat," Hanan said.
"They're the type of team that if
they have a little momentum, they
play well."
The starting six returned to the
floor after a noticeably sullen
switch of sides and proceeded to
halt any fledgling prospects of an
upset. Five Goss kills etched a
12-3 Stanford advantage on the
scoreboard, extinguishing any
doubts about the game's outcome
Despite the relative ease with
which Stanford dispatched Santa
Barbara, several team members
remain wary of future encounters.
"This is a team that we have to
respect," Hanan said. "We know
their personnel, but we have got
to be ready to play ouv game."
