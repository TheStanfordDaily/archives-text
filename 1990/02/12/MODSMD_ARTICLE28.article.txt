# Stanford at Hawaii
## 
### 
TONIGHT — Television: HNL
Cable. 9:05 p.m. PST start at
the University of Hawaii.
TOMORROW NIGHT - Same two
teams.
RECORDS — Stanford (2-1, 2-0 in
WIVA play; ranked No. 2 nation
ally), Hawaii (7-2, ranked No. 4
in the nation).
INJURIES — Ryan Moos, Stan
ford reserve outside hitter, is still
recovering from a hand injury
and is doubtful.
NOTES — According to the
players, Stanford may face its
biggest challenge of the season
traveling to Hawaii to face the
highly-touted Rainbows in two
consecutive conference match
es. Hawaii, which is led by hitter
Carlos Birceno, runs a sophisti
cated two-setter offense and
may have revenge on their
minds. The Cardinal defeated
the Rainbows in four straight
matches in Hawaii over the
preseason.
