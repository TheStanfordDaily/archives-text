### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
For the UC-Davis wrestling
team, the only good thing about
Friday night's match against
Stanford was the free pizza
served afterward. The Cardinal,
now 9-4 on the season, dis
mantled the Aggies (5-9) by a
score of 39-5.

The most inspirational match
took place in the 126-pound con
test, where Stanford's Dave
Nowick wrestled the Aggies'
Fred Cocio. With the match tied
4-4 late in the second period,
Nowick sprained his ankle. The
match was interrupted while
Stanford trainer, Ricky Hayes,
applied heavy tape to support
the ankle.
"I thought that he [Nowick]
had quite possibly been broken

when he had sprained his
ankle," Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel said.
But Nowick ignored the in
jury, coming back to score three
points in the final 42 seconds
of the round. He held on to beat
Cocio, 9-7.
"The iryury timeout gave me
a chance to gather my marbles
a little bit and comeback,"
Nowick said. "When I was down
there hurt I was thinking it's
probably worth it to go through
the pain to win this match."

Mark Savage went through con
siderable pain, but he did not
come close to winning his
match. The Cardinal's Steffond
Jones used a menacing headlock
to pin Savage with 3:53 expired
in the match.
"I was a little surprised at
how well Steffond Jones
wrestled," Horpel said. "As soon
as he escaped he turned into a
different person. All of the self
confidence he probably had in
high school came back. Suddenly

something clicked and he turned
into a great wrestler. When you
are wrestling at that level it
makes you really good."
Steve Buddie was also really
good. He pinned UC-Davis' Bill
Pederson at the 3:24 mark.
Buddie, a resident assistant at
Adelfa, had a large contingent
from his dorm cheering him to
victory. The junior had to
counter an effective move by
Pederson at the opening of the
bout.
"I freaked out. I've seen him
do it before and it's his bread
and butter move, so I thought
I better get the hell out of here,"
said Buddie.
In the 150-pound match,
Stanford's Geoff Baum suffered
an illegal head butt from the
Aggies' Chris Mullkoy. Baum
was leading 5-2 at the time, and
an apparently frustrated Mul
lkoy charged at Baum, hitting
him in the nose with his
forehead. Baum went on to win
the match, 9-4.
