# Axe falls on track and field
## Athletic Dept. budget cuts force loss of 25 scholarships 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
The athletics budget ax has fal
len again, this time cutting off
about 25 full scholarships for
recruits in track and field.
Working in conjunction with
University-wide efforts to cut
back expenditures, the Depart
ment of Athletics expects to save
about $500,000 with a decision to
only offer scholarships to incom
ing freshmen who match NCAA
qualifying times, said Andy
Geiger, athletic director.
As a result, only about five
track and field athletes per year
will enter Stanford on scholarship.
The rest will have to pay their
own way, but, like other students,
they can receive need-based finan
cial aid from the University if they
qualify, Geiger noted.
"This was the last thing in the
world ... I wanted to do, but we
had no choice," said Geiger.
Until this year, the Athletics
department consistently offered
30 full track and field scholarships
per year, the maximum allowed

by the NCAA.
Geiger said this year's track and
field recruits, currently seniors in
high school, have been informed
of the decision.
He also emphasized that no ath
letes who are currently on schol
arship will be affected, whether
they meet NCAA qualifying times
or not.
In addition, the track program
will not be reduced in terms of
facilities or coaching, and it will
retain its varsity status, Geiger
said.
He added that no other athletic
scholarships will be cut.
Track and field Coach Brooks
Johnson accepted the decision in
light of "certain realities," saying
he felt Geiger made the decision
"with maximum reluctance."
However, the Athletics depart
ment is still trying to reduce its
budget deficit.
John Kates, the Athletics de
partment's director of develop
ment for meyor gifts, said two
areas where cuts could be made
are in scholarships and on "the
operational side" — in staff reduc-

tions, for exam
ple.
Geiger also
confirmed that
the field hockey
program had lost
its varsity status
— a move that
will save the Ath
letics department
about $20,000.

Geiger said, "It tears me up. . . .
I don't like dismantling" any pro
gram.
However, Geiger said the
hockey team was "going nowhere"
and he would rather spend money
on more promising teams like
women's soccer.
Geiger noted that Stanford has
the smallest student body in the
Pacific-10 Conference and main
tains the largest number of var
sity teams.
"We're doing our damnedest"
to provide facilities for as many
sports as possible, he said.
Kates added, "We're wrestling
with the same [budget problems]
as the rest of the University. . . .
We've held on as long as we can."
