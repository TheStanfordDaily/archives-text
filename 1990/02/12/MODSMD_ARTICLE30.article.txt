After a long road trip, the Car
dinal men's gymnastics team man
aged to pull off a sweeping victory
at the Santa Barbara Invitational
Saturday night.
The competition provided Stan
ford with the chance to match up
against No. 3-ranked Fullerton
State, UC-Santa Barbara, San
Jose State, Brigham Young, and
Arizona State. Illinois, the defend
ing NCAA champion, was sched
uled to compete but did not.

Conrad Voorsanger, whose per
formance earned him a score of
56.55 (out of 60) and a first place
all-around finish. Tim Ryan con
tributed a third place showing,
and Charles Loop rounded out the
team by placing sixth overall.
Jair Lynch only competed in
five of the six events due to a
wrist injury, but still managed to
be impressive. His average score
was 9.4, and his 9.6 performance
on the high bar earned him second

place in that event. Tim Wang
was also injured and only com
peted on the parallel bars and
pommel horse.
The highlight of the meet was
the team's performance on the
high bar, with Stanford sweeping
first, second and third place and
accumulating a total of more than
47 points. This constituted the
highest team score on an event
this season.
The weakest areas proved to be
the pommel horse and parallel
bars. "We still haven't had a meet
where we've done well on all six
events, which is frustrating,"
Loop observed.
The injury situation has not
made things any easier. Junior
Adam Forman will not be able to
compete this year due to a knee
injury, and freshman Shawn
Adameck is redshirting due to
wrist problems.
"With fewer people competing,
everybody needs to hit their
routines and concentrate on get
ting better," Lynch said.
Gymnastics rules allow six gym
nasts to compete in each event,
and the top five scores are
counted. With only five gymnasts
healthy enough to compete in
some events for the Cardinal,
there is no longer the option of
discarding the lowest score.
