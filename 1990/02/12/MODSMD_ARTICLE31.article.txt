# Cardinal starts winter play in Tucson
## 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
As the curtain rises on the win
ter season of the Stanford wom
en's golf team, the squad's sights
are firmly set on landing a lead
role among the sport's elite.
Today's opening round of the
University of Arizona Intercol
legiate in Tucson provides the
Cardinal linksters with the first
chance of 1990 to showcase their
wide array of talent.
The team enters its initial event
of the winter season with a sense
that it has not yet fully realized
its vast golfing potential. Despite
enjoying top ten finishes in each
of its four autumn tournaments,
the Cardinal was unable to im
prove its preseason No. 8 national

ranking.
While most coaches would con
sider an eighth national ranking
as grounds to celebrate, Stanford
Coach Tim Baldwin felt his squad
is capable of even higher achieve
ments.
"We played solidly in the fall,

but we know we can do even bet
ter. We've definitely got the tools,
now our starters have to look for
excellent and consistent play,"
Baldwin said.
The Arizona Intercollegiate's
strong field offers an excellent op
portunity for the Cardinal to
boost its already impressive
record at the expense of some of
the preeminent powers of col
legiate golf.
San Jose State, Arizona State,
and host Arizona, currently the
top three teams in the nation,
present significant obstacles to
Stanford's quest for the team title.
The talented field looks to over
come the challenge presented by
the demanding Randolph Park
links. Site of both PGA and LPGA
Tucson events, the course is

renowned for its tight fairways
and two-tier greens.
The Cardinal will be repre
sented in Arizona by the same
five players who performed con
sistently in the fall.
Sophomores Stephanie Davis,
Adele Moore and Audrey Wooding,
junior Jodi Figley, and senior
Stephanie Parel seek to continue
the team's fine season.
The squad seems primed for
this first test of the winter.
Wooding reflected her teammates
confident approach to this crucial
event. "We ourselves know that
we can win tournaments, we just
need to prove it now. We're ex
cited to finally get back on the
course and find out what we can
do," Wooding said.
