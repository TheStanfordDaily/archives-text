## 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
Gymnasts are expected to fly
in the process of a meet, but
the Stanford women were
flying high before the compe
tition even began Saturday at
Burnham Pavilion.
"This was an awesome
meet," Cardinal co-captain
Susan Banta said afterward.
"We were so pumped up for it."

Cardinal second in
four'way home meet \

The result was a season-best
team score of 185.55, a dra
matic improvement on the pre
vious high of 182.35. The score
was good enough for second
place, behind defending Pacific
10 Conference champion
Oregon State's 188. Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo scored a
183.75 to edge Stanford
nemesis Boise State (183.1) for
third place.
Season bests were the word
of the day for the Cardinal. In
addition to the overall score,
the team set new high marks
in all four individual events as
well as all-around.
Senior co-captain Dina
moroso added to her list of

all-around wins by scoring a
37.95 to top Cal Poly-SLO's
Stacey Peterson, who scored a
37.7. Amoroso's score included
season highs in vault, balance
beam and bars. Jennifer Bloom
also had a tremendous all
around effort, adding more
than a point to her season best
with a score of 37.15.
Stanford led off the meet in
fine fashion as all six of the
competitors scored above nine
in vault. Banta, Amoroso and
sophomore Nicki Kobrine each
earned scores of 9.4 as Stanford
tallied a 46.65 in the event. On
bars, the Cardinal once again
sent only five competitors be
cause of injuries but still man
aged a score of 45.6.
Balance beam was where the
gymnasts really strutted their
stuff, winning the event by .7
with a 47.10. Amoroso tied for
top honors with a 9.55, and
Marietta Frey showed no ill ef
fects of her scary fall in last
week's meet as she scored a
9.45 to finish in a tie for third.
Making the effort even more
impressive was the absence of
two Cardinal regulars from the
beam team. Denise Villars and
Erin McCann sat out the meet
because of ankle injuries.
"We were missing two key
people, but the rest of the
people really picked up the
slack," Coach Breck Green
wood said.
