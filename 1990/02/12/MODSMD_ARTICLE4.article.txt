## Stanford gathers information for tuition price-fixing probe 
### Geoff Goldman Staff writer 
The U.S. Department of Justice
request for "detailed information"
in a price-fixing investigation was
a tall order, but Stanford was
happy to oblige — with enough
documents to make a stack more
than 40 feet tall.
On Sept. 12 last year, the Legal
Office received a request for in
formation from the Justice De
partment in an investigation of
price-fixing among top univer
sities.
Now, five months later, Stan
ford attorneys have almost com
pleted their response to the
request.
The Justice Department's 13-
page document requested detailed
information about all aspects of
the University's setting of fees,
salaries and financial aid over the
past four years.
The department has requested

similar information from about 50
major universities across the
country. It is currently in the early
stages of an investigation of
whether the universities are in
violation of federal antitrust laws.
In particular, the investigators
are looking for evidence of price
fixing or other collusion among
different universities with respect
to tuition and other fees. Such an
agreement would not necessarily
have to be a written contract.
The demand is only a prelimi
nary part of the investigation, and
no charges have been filed against
Stanford or any other university
at this time, according to General
Counsel John Schwartz.
The response to this request,
which has been done in stages
over the past few months, has
involved a massive amount of
work for University attorneys.
In terms of sheer numbers,
Stanford's response has involved
tens of thousands of pages of doc

uments, according to University
counsel Tom Fenner, who has su
pervised Stanford's response.
Schwartz estimated the amount
of material at 23 boxes, each one
and-a-half feet deep.
Schwartz emphasized that al
though Stanford meets with and
has relationships with other uni
versities, it does not participate
in any price-fixing or collusion
with other schools.
Stanford has refused to join the
Overlap Group, an organization
of selective schools which meets
regularly to discuss tuition,
salaries and financial aid.
Schwartz said Stanford is com
plying completely with the Justice
Department investigation.
The department demanded two
primary types of information
from Stanford and its activities:
documentation and inter
rogatories — questions about
Stanford's activities in the
determination of fees, salaries and
financial aid.
The demand required that
Stanford produce eight different
categories of documents, relating
to the period from Jan. 1, 1985
to Sept. 12, 1989. The documents
requested include the following:
• Income statements and bal
ance sheets for this four-year pe
riod, information about the fees
charged students and the pro
posed and actual budgets of the
University;
• All documents about agree
ments between Stanford and other
universities relating to fees,
salaries or financial aid; and
• All documents, plans, working
papers, studies, catalogs, bro
chures and publications that have
anything to do with fees, salaries
or financial aid.
According to the demand, the
term "document" includes all of
the following types of informa

tion: "contracts, letters,
telegrams, memoranda, checks
and check stubs, notes, reports,
studies, books, speeches, commen
taries, articles, announcements,
programs, telephone books or
messages, visitor books, desk and
pocket calendars, appointment
books, business cards, minutes of
meetings, conferences, telephone
conversations, accounting ledgers,
financial statements, photostats,
microfilms, tapes and computer
printouts."
In addition, the Legal Office
had to thoroughly describe the
process by which fees, salaries and
financial aid awards are deter
mined.
Stanford was also required to
list the names of all University
officers, present and past, who
were involved in these financial
matters and to describe any meet
ings at which a discussion of these
issues took place.
Parts of Stanford's response
have been sent to the Justice De
partment, but the University has
received no formal reply. Fenner
said he expected that the depart
ment would reply soon.

Stanford was also required to

were involved in these financial
matters and to describe any meet

issues took place.
Parts of Stanford's response
have been sent to the Justice De
partment, but the University has
received no formal reply. Fenner
said he expected that the depart
ment would reply soon.
