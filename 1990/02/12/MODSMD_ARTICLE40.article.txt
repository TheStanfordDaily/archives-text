# Betting on bovine bowel movements

If it's a question of money, let
the chips fall where they may.
Or, as freshman Vamsi Mootha
put it,"I guess for $1,000 a person
is willing to wish for a cow to
shit on his name."
Mootha, fellow Wilbur Hall res
idents, and other dung-donee
hopefuls were on hand Saturday
afternoon for a friendly game of

Bovine Bingo at Wilbur Field.
For a $3 donation, students pur
chased a square on the playing
field, and if Frank the Longhorn
used that square for a dumping
ground, the lucky ticket-holder
would see $1,000 plop into his or
her lap.
This odiferous event was spon
sored for the second year in a row
by the women's crew team. "Last
year's bingo game was a record
breaking fund-raiser," said team

member Heather Westwater. "We
made a profit of about $10,500."
While Westwater could not say
for sure how much profit the team
would make at this year's event,
she was confident that the
amount would be significant.
"Everyone worked really hard
this year — it was a 100-percent
team effort."
But nobody gave as much as
Frank. The 7-year-old longhorn
steer from Rancho Viejo stood

tethered to a trailer all morning,
waiting for his chance to shine.
According to owner Ed Coha,
Frank is half house pet, half wild
thing.
Coha, who leases the ranch
from the University, uses Frank
as a lead steer when he grazes
his cattle. "I go out there and
start hollerin' at him, and he
knows that 1 want him to go along
to the house, into the gate, and
down to the barn."
However, Coha feared that
Frank's head-tossing, tem
peramental ways might cause
problems at Saturday's event. So
instead he sent Pepe, a younger
steer, onto the field at 1 p.m.
But 15 minutes into the event,
Pepe was still holding back.
"Everyone's been cheering, 'Poo
poo, Pepe,' but I don't think it's
working," said freshman Ronit
Karpati.
"It's an ironic situation," Maura
Danforth added. The Rinconada
freshman was surprised that the
end was so long in coming. "Last
year the cow shit within the first
10 minutes."
Finally Frank took the field,
and within 30 seconds the deed
was done. To the titillation of the
waiting crowd, Frank made a
deposit on square P-22.
The spoils of that soil will be
divided among freshmen Tamara
Ahrens and Grant Murata, as well
as Stanford parent Carol Maz
zalupo. Ahrens, a member of the
women's crew team, was the only
winner on hand to witness the
blessed event.
"I'll probably buy books next
quarter with the money," Ahrens
said.

Frank the Longhorn did what comes naturally In this year's Bovine Bingo game. The event was used
as a fund-rasier for the women's crew team.
