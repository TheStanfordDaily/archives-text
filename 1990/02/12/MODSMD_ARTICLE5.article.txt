# Campbell flies frequently to bring Congress home to constituents
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
When Rep. Tom Campbell hops into a
plane and jeta away to California for the
weekend, he's not taking a vacation. It's
just part of the job.
In his first term as representative of
California's 12th District — the district
that includes Stanford — Campbell has
kept in touch with constituents by going
to 85 town meetings and conducting six
issue-intensive forums, including one last
Saturday at Palo Alto High School on
global warming.
Campbell flies from Washington, D.C.,
to California late Thursday nights. On
Fridays, he travels around to check on
progress at his three district offices. On
Saturdays, he meets with constituents

Its ridiculous now. Companies get tax breaks for
giving schools computers, but they don't get any
breaks for letting employees go to work as teachers.'

and goes to town meetings. And, on Sun
days, he teaches a course in the Law
School called "Issues of Law in Public
Policy."
"1 tried, but I just couldn't stay away
from teaching," said Campbell, a tenured
professor at the Law School since 1987.
"I enjoy it too much."
In the class, Campbell's students some
times study aspects of bills he has helped
write, which gives them a definite edge
when it comes to determining authorial
intent.

"When I say 'Congress meant this,' it's
really the truth," Campbell said.
On Mondays, Campbell flies back to
Washington, reading and writing letters
on the plane.
"The time change works against me
when I fly on Mondays so [the tripl takes
up most of the day," Campbell explained.
"I spend time on the plane reading 'Dear
Colleague' letters in which other repre
sentatives present their bills."
Then, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and
Thursdays, Campbell works on his bills,

getting support for them, doing commit
tee work and voting on bills that come
before the House.
Campbell serves on the Science, Space
and Technology Committee and, since last
fall, the Judiciary Committee. He said it
has been difficult to be a freshman Re
publican in the Democrat-controlled Con
gress, but he added that he feels he has
made progress.
One of Campbell's specialties is trade
law. He has put that expertise to use by
helping draft a package of nine bills that
has been adopted by the Republican Con
ference as the official Republican position
on the competitiveness of U.S. companies
in the world market.
Campbell will be meeting soon with
Vice President Dan Quayle, who is the
head of the competitiveness task force,

to get his support for the package.
"The competitiveness package will
come up as an issue this year, but
whether it goes through depends upon
how much priority the White House gives
it," Campbell said.
The package includes one bill that will
make it easier for companies to embark
on joint ventures. Other bills in the pack
age will promote research and develop
ment, remove tax incentives that promote
leveraged buyouts, cut capital gains taxes
and offer tax deductions to companies
who loan their employees out to schools
as teachers.
"It's ridiculous now. Companies get tax
breaks for giving schools computers, but
they don't get any breaks for letting em-
ployees go work as teachers,"
Campbell said. "Students could
learn a lot from professionals who
are out there in the field "
Campbell has also written a bill
that will put the same restrictions
on foreign investments in this
country that other countries put
on U.S. investments abroad. He
hopes this reciprocity bill will help
to open up foreign investment op
portunities for U.S. investors.
In addition, Campbell has been
working on environmental issues.
He has introduced legislation that
will give states the final word
when it comes to prohibiting off
shore oil drilling. He is working
on a bill that will create incentives
for companies to clean up ground
water toxins and another bill that
will levy a tax on leaded gasoline.
To solve the problem of the
budget deficit, Campbell is push
ing for a presidential line-item
veto bill.
"If a line-item veto bill is
passed, the deficit will disappear
quickly," Campbell said. But he
said he doubts that a line-item
veto bill will ever pass.
"The only way a line-item veto
is going to happen is if the pres
ident does it and then lets the
courts decide the issue," Campbell
said.
Campbell said civil rights and
abortion will be two of the biggest
issues on Capitol Hill this year.
On the civil rights front, he has
written a bill that will allow em
ployees to use statistical data to
support their claims of hiring dis
crimination.
