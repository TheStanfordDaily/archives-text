CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -
Nelson Mandela walked through a
prison gate to freedom yesterday, set
ting set off joyous celebrations as
blacks nationwide welcomed their
leader back from 27 years in jail.
"Comrades and fellow South
Africans, I greet you all in the name
of peace, democracy and freedom for
all," Mandela told tens of thousands
of cheering supporters who thronged
outside City Hall at twilight, many
getting their first look at the 71-year
old African National Congress leader.
Mandela emphatically reaffirmed
his commitment to the ANC's guerrilla
campaign and called for increased
pressure to end white-minority domi
nation — the same cause that resulted
in his life sentence on charges of plot
ting against the government He also
reiterated that talks with the govern
ment cannot begin until it lifts the
state of emergency.
"I stand here before you not as a
prophet, but as a humble servant of
you the people," said the white-haired
Mandela, who looked much more an
elder statesman in his suit and tie
than a guerrilla leader.
"Today, the majority of South
Africans, black and white, recognize
that apartheid has no future. It has
to be ended by our decisive mass ac
tion," he said in a rousing half-hour
speech frequently interrupted by roars
of "Viva!"
"Very good news, very good news,"
President Bush said after Mandela's
release. Bush said he telephoned Man
dela, told him all Americans "were
rejoicing at his release" and invited
him to the White House.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking at
a church service outside Cape Town
shortly before Mandela was released,
commended the South African govern
ment for making a "courageous step"
but said "the pillars of apartheid
remain in place."
A thunderous cheer went up as the

man who was the world's most famous
prisoner walked hand-in-hand with his
wife, Winnie, through the gate of Vic
tor Verster prison in Paarl, 35 miles
from Cape Town.
Under a brilliant blue sky, the Man
delas gave clenched-fist salutes to the
hundreds of supporters who had
waited for hours outside, many of them
waving green, gold and black ANC
flags and wearing T-shirts emblazoned
with a youthful image of Mandela.
Mandela appeared solemn and dig
nified as he and Winnie walked to a
white BMW sedan and climbed in. He
broke into a broad smile as the car
set off slowly in a police-escorted
motorcade.
The decision to free Mandela, after
a prolonged international campaign on
his behalf, was announced Saturday
by President F.W. de Klerk. Eight days
earlier, de Klerk stunned the nation
by lifting a 30-year ban on the ANC
and announcing other reforms aimed
at clearing the way for black-white
negotiations.
De Klerk, who spoke at length Sat
urday on Mandela's release, stayed out
of the public eye Sunday. Anton
Pretorius, a de Klerk spokesman, said
the president planned to comment on
Mandela's release later in the week.
Government television, however,
broadcast live Mandela's exit from
prison and later showed most of the
ANC leader's speech.
His elderly appearance probably
shocked many South Africans, the
majority of whom were born after
Mandela was last seen publicly in 1964.
Mandela in his speech called de
Klerk "a man of integrity" who had
gone further than any previous Na
tional Party leader in accommodating
black political aspirations.
But he said further steps — includ
ing the lifting of the state of emergency
and release of all political prisoners
— must be taken before talks can
begin.

yesterday from the Victor prison in "own, South Africa. Mandela
had been imprisoned for 27 years.
