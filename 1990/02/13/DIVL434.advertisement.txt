AROUND THE TIME OF
THE EARTHQUAKE?
The Office of Development is starting an all-out
effort to raise money to restore the buildings
that were damaged in the earthquake, including
student residences, Quad classrooms, the library
and the church.
We'd like to tell the students' side of the story —
students like you who were displaced from class
rooms or residences or were otherwise incon
venienced. How did you cope and how were
you helped?
If you have written about your experience during
this difficult period and are willing to share your
story with us please call Development Publications
at 7254295.
CALL RENE AT 5-4295 TODAY.
YOU'LL BE DOING STANFORD A GREAT SERVICE.
