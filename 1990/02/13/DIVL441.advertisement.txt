HEALTHNOTES
HIV TESTING
Early identification of HIV infection is
important!
Early treatment with AZT may significantly
postpone the onset of AIDS in infected but
asymptomatic people.
A survey done jointly by the Center for
Disease Control (CDC) and the Amencan
College Health Association (ACHA) last year
showed that 2 per thousand college students
were infected with the HIV vims. Also recent
evidence has demonstrated that zidovudine
(AZT) is effective in delaying progression of
the infection.
If you think you may be at nsk, from previous
sexual contact or contaminated needle use,
consider getting tested now!
Testing is available anonymously at the
following sites:
