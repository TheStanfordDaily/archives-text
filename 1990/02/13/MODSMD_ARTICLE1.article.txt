# Phi Delts will face new rules
## 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
After spending nearly four
months on social suspension pend
ing investigation, the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity will negotiate
new social guidelines today in a
meeting between University offi
cials and Phi Delt officers.
The Phi Delts have prepared a
series of proposals they will pres
ent at today's meeting, which may
be one of the final phases in the
Phi Delt investigation. The Phi
Delts are expected to present
strict guidelines for parties and
their upcoming spring Rush.
The meeting will be attended
by fraternal affairs adviser Mi
chael Hughes, Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Michael Jackson and
director of the Row Diana Con
klin.
Hughes has been handling the
investigation of the Phi Delts
since they were first placed on
social suspension in October. His
revised report was recently corn-
pleted but has not yet been re
leased.
"We want to get the fraternity
involved as much as possible,"
Hughes said, explaining that the
meeting's purpose is to discuss all
of the fraternity's proposals.
Phi Delt president Chris Helling
said he was "definitely pleased"
about the fraternity's opportunity
to voice its opinion. "By consid
ering our proposals, the Univer
sity is allowing us to demonstrate
our commitment to the commu
nity at large."
Whether or not tomorrow's
meeting will bring the investiga
tion and social suspension to a
close is uncertain. Jackson said
the two sides may still need to
negotiate after the meeting but
added that the two sides are
"closer to resolution" than they
were one month ago.
The Phi Delts hope the meeting

will end their four-month-long
suspension and resolve the inves
tigation, according to Helling.
The fraternity was put on social
suspension the second week of fall
quarter, after an intoxicated
freshman was hit by a truck on
Junipero Serra Boulevard after
attending the Phi Delt "Hurricane
Party."
The procedure being followed
in the Phi Delt case is "not un
usual," according to Jackson.
"Similar steps were taken when
we had problems with Delta Up
silon and Theta Xi in the past."
Jackson said the meetings with
the Phi Delts allow the fraternity
to discuss mitigating circum
stances.
"Our purpose is education,"
Jackson said. "In some cases it
may involve punishment, but ed
ucation is our main intent."
"We also have to consider the
historical context," Jackson said.
"We've had problems with the Phi
Delts a number of times, and we
have to take that into considera
tion."
