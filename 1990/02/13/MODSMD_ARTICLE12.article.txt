# Soviet Union accepts ownership of property
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — The Communist
Party embraced the principle of private
property yesterday in a radical rejec
tion of some of the fundamentals of
Marxism and Soviet socialism.
"The Communist Party of the Soviet
Union believes the existence of indi
vidual property, including ownership
of the means of production, does not
contradict the modern stage in the
country's economic development," the
party's new platform says.
The platform was approved Wednes
day by the party's policy-making Cen
tral Committee but not published in
final form until yesterday.
It represents Soviet President Mik
hail S. Gorbachev's boldest break with
communist orthodoxy and contradicts
public statements he made just months
ago.
The platform did not make clear in
what sense the party still considers
itself to be Communist, but pays
homage to the creative spirit of Mar
xism and the philosphy's humanistic
outlook of opposing religion and em
phasizing man's daily existence.
It also points with pride to the con
cepts of pensions, free education and
medical care and other social benefits
that it says the Soviet system
pioneered.
In deciding on sweeping changes,
however, the platform says the party
took into account the new hunger of
Soviet citizens for democracy and
reform, as expressed by mass rallies
and local political organizing all over

the country.
The document also says the Com
munist Party supports:
• "Protection of a citizen's person
ality and honor, the immunity of his
home and property, the secrecy of cor
respondence."
• Citizen "participation in running
the affairs of society and the state,
freedom of speech, the press, meetings
and demonstrations and the formation
of public organizations."
• "Man's free self-determination in
the spiritual sphere, the freedom of
conscience and religion."
• A stronger presidency that would
further erode the power of the party
in favor of the government. Party of
ficials said last week they would would
give up their constitutional monopoly
on power.
Soviet laws long have promised wide
political freedoms, but the Communist
Party has dominated every aspect of
life and has been intolerant of any
challenge.
In a departure from one of the Marx
ist slogans once used to justify rule
by terror and liquidation of the middle
class, the party dismissed the concept
of a dictatorship of the proletariat,
saying: "The rule-of-law state of the
whole people has no room for dicta
torship by any class."
Communists intend to reform the
top-heavy Soviet system, in serious
economic straits, into a "planned
market economy based on a diversity
of property forms.
