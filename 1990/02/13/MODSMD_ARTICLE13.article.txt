Britain supports de Klerk
LONDON (AP) - Britain called
today for a swift relaxation of sanc
tions against South Africa to save
President F.W. de Klerk from being
toppled by a white backlash.
But most other countries said the
release Sunday of black leader Nelson
Mandela was not enough to warrant
easing sanctions. The 12-nation Eu
ropean Community appeared likely
to isolate Britain on the issue, and
President Bush said it was too early
to talk about lifting sanctions.
The Soviet Union, which armed
Mandela's African National Congress
guerrilla movement, and China joined
in international expressions of
delight at Mandela's freedom.
Violence is justified
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — Nelson Mandela said yester
day he seeks a South Africa that is
fair to both whites and blacks, and
he insisted that violence against
apartheid is justified.
The 71-year-old black leader, en

joying his first full day of freedom
ifter 27 years in prison, defended
the policies of his African National
Congress but said talks with the gov
ernment could be held soon.
The activists making arrangements
for Mandela decided he should not
re-enter Soweto until today, when a
massive welcoming rally is planned.
They refused to disclose where he
would spend the night, although tele
vision networks deployed helicopters
to pursue him.
Mandela said negotiations between
the ANC and the government could
begin "very soon" if President F.W.
de Klerk continues his peace initia
tive and makes further reforms.
"The state of emergency has to be
lifted in its entirety and political pris
oners have to be released," Mandela
told more than 200 journalists as
sembled on the lawn outside the of
ficial residence of Anglican Arch
bishop Desmond Tutu in Capy Town.
Nationalization proposed
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — When Nelson Mandela ex

pressed support yesterday for
nationalizing gold mines and other
assets, he shocked the business world
and gold shares fell 4 percent on the
Johannesburg stock exchange.
The financial rand, a special cur
rency used to encourage foreign in
vestment, plummeted 10 percent on
the black leader's first day of freedom
after more than 27 years in prison.
Gold prices rose in Europe and the
United States.
Mandela said he supports the
African National Congress economic
plan for a state-run economy, includ
ing nationalizing mines and other
major industries.
Violence continues
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — A white security guard yes
terday shot and killed one of a group
of club-carrying blacks who chased
and cornered him during a celebra
tion of Nelson Mandela's release,
police said.
The guard was harassed and
chased along a central Johannesburg
street by about 50 revelers, and fired
after he was cornered by members

of the group carrying bricks and
clubs, Capt. Eugene Opperman said.
Four bystanders were wounded by
shotgun pellets.
South African coverage
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — South African television yes
terday kept up its extensive coverage

of Mandela's stroll to freedom on
Sunday along with clips of the black
leader's speech, in which he endorsed
the armed struggle against the white
minority government.

major capitals on how foreign gov
ernments were responding.
South African newspapers
showered the release with massive
coverage. Several in Johannesburg

tions with headlines like, "Mandela
