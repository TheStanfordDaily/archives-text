## Painful choices 
### 
Bulging bureaucracy
leaves large deficit,
many tough choices

LET'S HOPE the announce
ment last week of $22 million
in budget cuts isn't a case
of too little, too late.
The University should be com
mended for taking drastic action
to fix a serious problem. But it is
disturbing that such drastic action
is needed.
One is left wondering why the
situation was allowed to get this
bad. In the midst of a Centennial
Campaign which has raised $862
million itself, Stanford is facing a
projected $7.2 million deficit in
next year's operating budget.
Erasing that deficit will mean
tough budget choices, and the long
term cuts are even more serious.
Staff positions are already on the
cutting block, and, despite as
surances from budget officials, stu
dent services are not invulnerable
either.
Further, Provost James Rosse
has not ruled out the possibility
that cutbacks will be made in some
academic programs. The reduction
of academic opportunities is a high
price to pay for the burgeoning
bureaucracy that has allowed the
operating budget to become so in
flated.
It is hoped that student services
and academic programs truly are
the last to go under the budget
knife.
Progress on UCMI recommenda
tions will also be slowed as a result
of the impending cuts. A com
promised commitment to building
a pluralistic community is disturb
ing.
Limited funds must not trans
late into limited vision. It is more
important than ever, even in dif

ficult financial times, that the Uni
versity throw its full institutional
support behind the recommenda
tions of the University Committee
on Minority Issues.
While it is still undetermined
where the budget cuts and changes
to solve the deficit problem will
occur, two early indications by the
budget planners are encouraging.
Next year's tuition increase,
pending approval by the Board of
Trustees, will be held to 5.25 per
cent — still 1 percent above the
inflation rate, but significantly less
than this year's 8 percent increase.
Further, the indirect cost rate,
the amount the University adds to
research grants to cover overhead
costs, will be limited to 78 percent
in the near future — a gift to
researchers who rely on a compet
itive rate to secure grants.
A close eye should be kept on
the University to ensure these
plans do not go by the wayside.
Tuition and indirect cost recovery
are the two largest sources of in
come for the operating budget. The
two areas provide tempting ways
to increase revenue and erase the
deficit.
Rosse indicated that financial
aid will not be subject to cuts,
which is good news for the 70 per
cent of the student body that
depends on it. The bad news lies
in the inability to promise new
funding. With tuition costs up 5.25
percent and room and board up 6
percent, there will be greater need
for financial aid than ever before.
And despite the increases, Stan
ford must continue to be accessible
to students of ail socio-economic
backgrounds.
Rosse has indicated that Stan
ford will be going through "a lot
of pain and travail" as the budget
is brought into line. He's right.
But the University should do all
it can to minimize the pain on the
people for whom it exists.
