## Intolerance is the answer 
### 
AT AN INSTITUTION like Stan
ford, there is a spirit of open
mindedness and tolerance that is
so very absent in the outside world where
narrow-mindedness seems to be the rule,
rather than the exception. This spirit,
this sense of possibility, breathes life into
our university. It is the variety of cultures
and viewpoints and lifestyles that gives
the Stanford education its richness. And
it is the receptiveness to differences that
makes all this possible.
However much we subscribe to this
liberal outlook, we must concede that the
principle of tolerance is not, and cannot,
be absolute. I am speaking of our current
drug crisis. When it comes to drugs, the
acceptance and tolerance of alternative
lifestyles is not possible. Tolerance can
be a recipe for inaction and it can be an
easy rationalization for looking the other
way when an individual and collective
tragedy is happening.
And looking the other way is exactly
what most of this campus is choosing to
do. Unfortunately, some are doing more
than that. Aram Irwin, the current
"Bug," lives up to his nom de plume by
chronicling in his Feb. 9 column the ap
parently entertaining experiences that are
possible with today's popular drugs.
Perhaps this light-hearted demeanor
would be changed if one visited the "crack
babies" at San Francisco General Hospi
tal, and fully appreciated how fun cocaine
is. It is irresponsible to laugh at behavior
which is, at its base, tragic and pathetic.
Drug use is simply not benign. Drug
use is not a private matter because it
carries with it enormous social costs. The
consequences of drug use do not stop

with the consumption of drugs. Even if
we were to presume that the iryury sus
tained from doing say, a little cocaine, is
strictly the business of the user, we would
be left with the illegal and violent behav
ior that stems from the supplying of
drugs, which is extremely destructive to
innocent people.
Our ravaged inner cities and chaotic
Colombia are living and dying proof. Our
drug use finances the drug lords who are
making Colombia an unsafe place to live
and reducing that nation to a state of
anarchy.
The only way to succeed in this "war
on drugs" is to change attitudes. "Cutting
drugs off at the source" is not going to
work when coca leaves bring in several
times the income that a legal crop will.
"Education" alone will not do the job
either. It is a rather small remedy because
the exhortations and the cool rational
arguments against drugs by high school
teachers are ineffective when weighed
against the coercive influences that
children — and adults — feel when they
are among peers.
It is peer pressure, it is the overt ac
ceptability of drug use which allows for
the permeation of drugs into our society.
We must fight the drug problem with
criticism and condemnation of drug use.
It is simply hypocritical for Stanford stu
dents to attack the government for not
spending enough money to tell kids not
to take drugs when we ourselves condone
their use with our silence and implicit
approval.
It is time for us to dig in our heels
and embrace stubbornness and rigidity.

Intolerance is the answer. Even in our
island of academia, we are not above the
fray. We must speak up when dormmates
use drugs. We may even have to turn in
drug users to the police and let them
face prosecution to the full extent of the
law.
This is where people feel uneasy about
fighting drugs. Punishing drug pushers
and battling the Medellin drug cartel is
one thing, but going after users is quite
another. This drug war is not just fight
ing against the guys in the black hats
because the enemy is within us.
By the way, the student who notified
the Stanford Police about the suspected
drug use and drug dealing in the AD
House receives my commendation. It
takes uncommon courage to take a dif
ficult stand in the face of disapproving
peer pressure.
It is exactly this fortitude that is
needed from all of us. It is, however,
regrettable that the house residents were
tipped off about the raid beforehand.
Nonetheless, his or her action will serve
as a deterrent for those who might have
been involved in drug dealing.
