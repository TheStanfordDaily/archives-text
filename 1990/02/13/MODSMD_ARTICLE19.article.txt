## Asian-American studies promotes multiculturalism 
### 
ON MONDAY, Feb. 5, Stanford's
first candidate for the position
of Asian-American studies pro
fessor, Victor Nee, came to share with
us his views on the development of
Asian-American studies. We would like
to address his opinion that in
stitutionalizing Asian-American studies
as a distinct field is "backward."
Nee's opinions do not arise from an
understanding of this University's
vision for building a "benchmark multi
cultural campus," the 20-year struggle
to establish Asian-American studies at
Stanford, or the campus-wide support
for this vision. He raised several mis
conceptions regarding the institutionali
zation of Asian-American studies.
At this time in Stanford's history, we
seek to bring the experiences, history
and contributions of ethnic miniorities
into our curriculum. The broadening of
the Area 1 distribution requirement is
one example of this. The upcoming
proposals for the incorporation of
ethnic studies into the curriculum is
another example.
Of course, there are questions about
how to best integrate these experiences
into the curriculum. Some, like Nee,
may argue that the best way is to
"mainstream" the experiences of Asian-
Americans and may pit this view
against one of building up Asian-
American studies programs and depart
ments. This pitting is the "backward"
element of Victor Nee's arguments.
We in the Asian-American commu
nity are not opposed to the
"mainstreaming" of the experiences of
Asian-Americans — in fact, it would be
a welcome change. We would not have
to sit in classes about 19th-century
America and have the experiences of
Chinese-Americans left out entirely. We
would not learn about World War II
and have no mention of Executive
Order 9066, the order that interned
over 120,000 U.S. citizens in camps.

Our view of developing Asian-American studies
is to both incorporate material into standard
classes and to create new classes with new
perspectives.

Nor could we go through entire sociol
ogy classes and not learn a single
thing about Asian-Americans.
In addition to incorporating the
experiences and perspectives of Asian-
Americans into "mainstream" classes,
we also see the need to study this
material on its own terms. Asian-
Americans have a distinct culture and
history that should be understood and
appreciated.
Classes that focus on topics such as
Asian-American literature, Asian-
American history and Asian-American
psychology, should be offered just as
there are now classes such as
"American Indian Mythology," "African-
American Literature," "The Modern
Black Freedom Struggle" and "Chicano
Life and Culture." After all, classes
such as these wili further help us
understand the experiences and cul
tures of each group of people in their
own context and from their own per
spective.
Our view of developing Asian-
American studies, then, is to both
incorporate material into standard
classes and to create new classes with
new perspectives.
However, our question is simply this:
How will Stanford expand its curricu
lum to include Asian-American studies,
when few, if any, faculty here are
qualified to teach Asian-American
studies? Even just to "mainstream"
this history and experience, there
needs to be professors who are experts

in the field to act as resources for
other faculty.
Scholars hired to teach and develop
the field of Asian-American studies will
guide and train undergraduate and
graduate students to further explore
this field of study. They will also
develop new classes that focus on
Asian-Americans, and help to incor
porate these materials into other
classes. With administrative and staff
support, these professors can further
develop Asian-American studies by
inviting guest lecturers, creating post
doctoral positions and applying for
research grants.
In other words, strong programs and
departments are not a contradiction to
"mainstreaming" Asian-American
studies but are in fact necessary to
accomplish this goal.
By hiring the first Asian-American
studies scholar, the University is taking
the next step in its commitment to an
education that includes the experiences
of Asian-Americans. Given that race is
a significant factor in American society,
our education must teach us to under
stand, respect and value these differ
ences.
The majority of Asian-Americans are
immigrants who face harsh living
conditions and often drop out of high
school. We need to understand these
people and the issues they face if our
education is to equip us to face the
challenges of our ever-changing society.
This has not always been the under

standing of the Stanford community.
Just three years ago, as Stanford was
reflecting on its past 100 years and
formulating goals for its next century,
not a single word was being said about
muticulturalism. It was indeed possible
and actually the norm for Stanford
students to go through four years here
at Stanford and not learn a single
thing about Asian-Americans.
Through the efforts of many, includ
ing University President Donald Ken
nedy, Provost James Rosse and Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Ewart
Thomas, times have changed. Today,
we have the University Committee on
Minority Issues report, a plan to
realize Stanford's vision of multicul
turalism. Now the debate is not over
whether or not to build a multicultural
campus, but how to build it. We can
not let those wishing to further their
own ends distract us from our vision.
We all have worked too long and
hard to see one candidate who wishes
only to obtain a coveted tenured
professorship at Stanford attempt to
manipulate and use the process for his
own ends. Whatever led Victor Nee to
believe that this was possible must be
cleared up.
This is why we, in the Asian Ameri
can Student Association, have urged all
who are interested in realizing the
vision of multicultural education to
attend the community presentations
and hear all the candidates. We have a
responsibility to contribute to the
selection of a qualified Asian-American
studies scholar and we have learned
that we must continue our efforts until
the very end, not just to hire the
professor, not just to develop Asian-
American studies but to truly build
that rainbow multicultural community
that will shine brightly nationwide.

proposals for the incorporation of
ethnic studies into the curriculum is
another example.
Of course, there are questions about
how to best integrate these experiences
into the curriculum. Some, like Nee,
may argue that the best way is to
"mainstream" the experiences of Asian-
Americans and may pit this view
against one of building up Asian-
American studies programs and depart
ments. This pitting is the "backward"
element of Victor Nee's arguments.
We in the Asian-American commu
nity are not opposed to the
"mainstreaming" of the experiences of
Asian-Americans — in fact, it would be
a welcome change. We would not have
to sit in classes about 19th-century
America and have the experiences of
Chinese-Americans left out entirely. We
would not learn about World War II
and have no mention of Executive
Order 9066, the order that interned
over 120,000 U.S. citizens in camps.

Our view of developing Asian-American studies
is to both incorporate material into standard
classes and to create new classes with new
perspectives.

Nor could we go through entire sociol
ogy classes and not learn a single
thing about Asian-Americans.
In addition to incorporating the
experiences and perspectives of Asian-
Americans into "mainstream" classes,
we also see the need to study this
material on its own terms. Asian-
Americans have a distinct culture and
history that should be understood and
appreciated.
Classes that focus on topics such as
Asian-American literature, Asian-
American history and Asian-American
psychology, should be offered just as
there are now classes such as
"American Indian Mythology," "African-
American Literature," "The Modern
Black Freedom Struggle" and "Chicano
Life and Culture." After all, classes
such as these wili further help us
understand the experiences and cul
tures of each group of people in their
own context and from their own per
spective.
Our view of developing Asian-
American studies, then, is to both
incorporate material into standard
classes and to create new classes with
new perspectives.
However, our question is simply this:
How will Stanford expand its curricu
lum to include Asian-American studies,
when few, if any, faculty here are
qualified to teach Asian-American
studies? Even just to "mainstream"
this history and experience, there
needs to be professors who are experts

in the field to act as resources for
other faculty.
Scholars hired to teach and develop
the field of Asian-American studies will
guide and train undergraduate and
graduate students to further explore
this field of study. They will also
develop new classes that focus on
Asian-Americans, and help to incor
porate these materials into other
classes. With administrative and staff
support, these professors can further
develop Asian-American studies by
inviting guest lecturers, creating post
doctoral positions and applying for
research grants.
In other words, strong programs and
departments are not a contradiction to
"mainstreaming" Asian-American
studies but are in fact necessary to
accomplish this goal.
By hiring the first Asian-American
studies scholar, the University is taking
the next step in its commitment to an
education that includes the experiences
of Asian-Americans. Given that race is
a significant factor in American society,
our education must teach us to under
stand, respect and value these differ
ences.
The majority of Asian-Americans are
immigrants who face harsh living
conditions and often drop out of high
school. We need to understand these
people and the issues they face if our
education is to equip us to face the
challenges of our ever-changing society.
This has not always been the under

standing of the Stanford community.
Just three years ago, as Stanford was
reflecting on its past 100 years and
formulating goals for its next century,
not a single word was being said about
muticulturalism. It was indeed possible
and actually the norm for Stanford
students to go through four years here
at Stanford and not learn a single
thing about Asian-Americans.
Through the efforts of many, includ
ing University President Donald Ken
nedy, Provost James Rosse and Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Ewart
Thomas, times have changed. Today,
we have the University Committee on
Minority Issues report, a plan to
realize Stanford's vision of multicul
turalism. Now the debate is not over
whether or not to build a multicultural
campus, but how to build it. We can
not let those wishing to further their
own ends distract us from our vision.
We all have worked too long and
hard to see one candidate who wishes
only to obtain a coveted tenured
professorship at Stanford attempt to
manipulate and use the process for his
own ends. Whatever led Victor Nee to
believe that this was possible must be
cleared up.
This is why we, in the Asian Ameri
can Student Association, have urged all
who are interested in realizing the
vision of multicultural education to
attend the community presentations
and hear all the candidates. We have a
responsibility to contribute to the
selection of a qualified Asian-American
studies scholar and we have learned
that we must continue our efforts until
the very end, not just to hire the
professor, not just to develop Asian-
American studies but to truly build
that rainbow multicultural community
that will shine brightly nationwide.

ON MONDAY, Feb. 5, Stanford's
first candidate for the position
of Asian-American studies pro
fessor, Victor Nee, came to share with
us his views on the development of
Asian-American studies. We would like
to address his opinion that in
stitutionalizing Asian-American studies
as a distinct field is "backward."
Nee's opinions do not arise from an
understanding of this University's
vision for building a "benchmark multi
cultural campus," the 20-year struggle
to establish Asian-American studies at
Stanford, or the campus-wide support
for this vision. He raised several mis
conceptions regarding the institutionali
zation of Asian-American studies.
At this time in Stanford's history, we
seek to bring the experiences, history
and contributions of ethnic miniorities
into our curriculum. The broadening of
the Area 1 distribution requirement is
one example of this. The upcoming
proposals for the incorporation of
ethnic studies into the curriculum is
another example.

how to best integrate these experiences
