MY REMARKS TO an assembled
group of Asian-American stu
dents on Feb. 5 seem to have
stirred up an intense debate about the
future of ethnic studies at Stanford.
Clearly, feelings run strong on this
issue and while to some participants in
the debate my views make sense, to
others they appear to be a betrayal of
the impulse to organize and seek
recognition for ethnic studies pro
grams.
Overall, the tenor of the response to
my unrehearsed remarks seems to
reflect an unresolved dilemma over the
nature and direction of ethnic studies
at Stanford. Although before coming to
Stanford I had been told that I would
be discussing my views on Asian-
American studies at an "informal
gathering of students," I was surprised
and disturbed to discover myself facing
approximately 70 students with
prepared questions as well as a
reporter and photographer from The
Daily.
I cannot recall hearing of any inter
view for a senior-level faculty appoint
ment at any other institution which
entailed holding a press conference.

Since, in fact, it appears that it was
not an informal discussion of views
that was scheduled for during my visit,
I would like to take this opportunity to
clarify my views formally.
The events leading to and folowing
the occupation of University President
Donald Kennedy s office last May
interestingly replay the drama which
led to the establishment of ethnic
studies within the American academy
20 years ago. Since that time, it has
been my sense that there has been a
growing recognition that ethnic studies
as an institutional form is in crisis
wherever it exists as a separate aca
demic entity.
Although I realize that in the cur
rent search for a professor of Asian-
American studies at Stanford the
intent is to appoint a faculty in a
mainline department, it seemed to me
that in the current mobilized state of
things at Stanford it was relevant to
discuss and reflect on why the concep
tion of ethnic studies as a separate
disciplinary and institutional entity
might be in crisis.
As someone who participated in the
civil rights movement as a student in

the 19605, I am fully supportive of the
view that the histories and experiences
of groups that have been historically
subject to discrimination should be
represented in educational curricula,
and I futhermore believe that what we
often call the "cultural" expressions of
such groups should be expressed and
recognized.
I feel, however, that the constitution
of discrete academic disciplines and
departments around notions of ethnic
identities has proven to be both practi
cally and intellectually problematic.
In a practical sense, the setting up
of departments of ethnic studies on
American campuses that hire their
own faculty and produce their own
degrees has most often been accompa
nied by feelings of ambivalence on the
part of both faculty and students in
these programs, who find themselves
physically isolated from colleagues and
peers and in a situation that often
seems to perpetuate discrimination
rather than reverse or eradicate it.
The new diversity in ethnic composi
tion of students at universities like
Stanford is the result of a watershed
change that is taking place in our

society.
At this historic juncture, can minor
ity students who mtyor in ethnic
studies and pursue programs of study
which, whether intentionally or not,
tend through their very constitution as
academic disciplines to reify and rein
force notions of essentialized ethnic
and cultural identities, be well
prepared for their futures?
The opinions I expressed during the
"informal exchange of views" at Stan
ford reflected my positive evalution of
a different model for developing multi
cultural curricula in universities.
At Cornell there has been a virtual
revolution in recent years in the Col
lege of Arts and Sciences, due in part
to the intellectual leadership of Henry
Louis Gates, the W.E.B. du Bois Pro
fessor of English Literature. This
change has been effected by the rapid
increase in courses that focus on mi
nority culture and experiences within
mainline humanities and social science
departments.
Minority and majority students who
might not otherwise take courses in
ethnic studies discover that ethnicity is
an important component of the con-

temporary experience. Through this
approach Cornell has been able to
attract top-flight new minority faculty
and also to dramatically diversify both
the course offerings and the intellec
tual agenda of "traditional" disciplines.
The protocol of the academic recruit
ment visit, particularly involving senior
faculty, is actually well-established. I
had not been forewarned that I was
about to make a public statement
concerning an ongoing struggle about
which I knew very little and in which
I had no part.
I was so taken aback by this break
of academic protocol that I withdrew
my name from the search. However, in
retrospect I am pleased that I had the
opportunity to discuss my views with
Stanford Asian-American students. If
the debate was heated and at times
antagonistic, it suggests that the issues
are important. I am cautiously optimis
tic that one outcome of the debate will
be a more thoughtful consideration of
the form ethnic studies will take at
Stanford in the future.
