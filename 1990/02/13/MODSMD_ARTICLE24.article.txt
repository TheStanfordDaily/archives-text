Among Schoolchildren

Tracy Kidder is a remarkable writer. After having
captured for us a major event of our technological
age, the design and launching of a computer, in
"The Soul of a New Machine," he has, in his latest
book, "Among Schoolchildren," turned his attention
to a strikingly different world.
We are now in Mrs. Zajac's classroom, with the
children she teaches in a public school in Holyoke,
Mass. As the crow flies, we are only 50 mik. aw v
from the basement where that new machine was
born, from the place where the state of the art was
pushed one step further and where talented en
gineers fulfilled their dreams.
In that basement we had felt something exciting
and important was happening, it was like watching
the landing on the moon. A tremendous amount of
energy was expended on something difficult and
clever, and lots of money rode on whether the
computer would ship out.
This intoxicating mix of daring and expertise
swept the participants so completely, so exhaustingly
fast, that any one of them could doubt his ability
to solve the technical problems at hand, but none
could question their shared assumption that build
ing a fast powerful computer at reckless speed was
terribly meaningful and important.
But in Kidder's latest book, we are among school
children, disconnected from the power and affluence
of the corporations where computer engineers work.
For several of these kids, though they are not yet
in their teens, there is hardly any future at all.
Mrs. Zajac might be their last chance, the last time
someone will be genuinely, deeply interested in them,
and give them enough attention and affection that
they might open up and learn a little bit.
Maybe because she is so accurately there with
them, aware of what they do, in tune with what
they feel, they might drop some of their defenses,
not be so defiant and understand she cares. She
really does care. I'm not sure I've ever met anyone
who cares the way Kidder makes me feel she does.
If she had been my teacher in high school, I think
I'd be a different, better person now.
But it is difficult to feel someone cares for you,
if you are afraid, as Clarence is: "He had his arms
folded on his chest and was glaring at her. The
picture of defiance. He would show her. She felt
like laughing for a moment. His stubbornness was
impressive. Nearly an hour passed, and the boy did
no work at all. Chris (Mrs. Zajac) sighed, got up
and walked over to Clarence. He turned his face
away as she approached. Chris sat in a child's chair
and, resting her chin on her hand, leaned her face
close to Clarence's. He turned his face farther away."
Mrs. Zajac's job is difficult and also terribly simple.
The kind of simplicity the earthquake brought us
back to when, for a few days, it took the wind out
of our values and pursuits, making them seem
hollow in the same way the World Series became
hollow.
Perhaps we should not be surprised that our
values can seem worthless. As a society we are very
well-organized to build computers, we admire the
single-mindedness with which, in"The Soul of a
New Machine," dozens of engineers drove them
selves numb to build a newer, faster and better
computer, giving their all to bring it to life. But to

save Clarence's soul there is only Mrs. Zajac.
She is alone. We do not send the best and brightest
college graduates to help her. We must even wonder,
given the way we live, why someone as dedicated
and energetic as Mrs. Zajac is not doing better for
herself.
Fortunately, some of the other children are not
so close to tailing off the edge into that world which
is linked to the rest of us only through fear, hatred
and violence. Mrs. Zajac in fact has a couple of
extraordinarily bright children in her class. And she
is trying to teach these bright ones, nurture their
inquisitive, pliable minds, push them a bit, while
at the same time not leaving Clarence behind, giving
him unfailingly the remedial affection he so des
perately needs and may never accept.
It's not her job. She is there to teach, not to be
a surrogate mother, but she is spirited enough to
take the kids as they come to her. Fortunately some
respond, and one of the book's pleasures is that it
conveys this awakening.
There is nothing fancy about Kidder's writing,
he uses ordinary words, a straightforward style,
but to powerful effect. We feel we know these
children and Mrs. Zajac better than if we had been
in his place, observing that classroom through the
course of a school year.
Although Kidder ascribes thoughts and feelings
convincingly and with empathy, there is always a
sense of incompleteness.
No matter. This definite tone, joined to the sharp
focus on the denizens of one classroom, makes for
a strong, stirring book. There is little theorizing
here, no propounding of any p<rlitical or adminis
trative solution to our schools' ills. W r hich is not to
say that Kidder does not point at an answer. After
spending a year with him among schoolchildren, we
may feel that what matters most is whether we care.
