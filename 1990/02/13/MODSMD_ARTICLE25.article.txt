# From the mouths of babes
## A
						search for simple truths in literature by and for kids 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
We all have something in com
mon. Whether we are of Europe
an, African, Latin American,
Asian, Native American or
Australian descent, whether we
are male or female, short or tall,
we were all children once and
some of us still are.
What children read and what
children write should be of inter
est to us all, because their
thoughts will shape the future.
They are the world's hope and, if
you stop to look around, you'll
see that they are in for a chal
lenge.
Perhaps the biggest news in
children's literature this year has
been the release of Dr. Seuss' 43rd
book, "Oh, the Places You'll Go."
This little gem, a must-read for
graduating Stanford students,
prepares the reader for the ups
and downs of the real world.
The book preaches that, in our
lives, we should strive for success,
but it never says that work is
required. It prepares you for lone
liness and setbacks and it calls
life a "great balancing act," but
according to Dr. Seuss, success is
"98% percent guaranteed."
Unfortunately, there is not a
single woman in the story, though
to be fair the book usually uses
the pronoun "you" and the char
acter in the tale is fairly
androgynous.
As usual, the illustrations are
marvelous.
The book has the same carpe
diem spirit made popular in the
past year by the summer movie
hit "Dead Poets' Society."
Unlike Dr. Seuss' last two books
"The Butter Battle Book" and
"You're Only Old Once" which
taught children about the threat
of nuclear war and aging, respec
tively, this new book ends on an
optimistic note. Perhaps recent
world events have caused Dr.
Seuss to paint a brighter picture
for the world's children.
Though there are a wealth of
amazing stories written for
children, collections of children's
writings are usually much harder
to find. But they are worth the
search.
"A Monster is Bigger than
Nine" is a collection of children's
sayings compiled by teachers since
1970 at Northfield Day Care in
Northfield, Minn. The teachers
were struck by the "strange and
wonderful things" the children
they cared for said, so they re
corded them over the years and
published them in 1988.
The book includes such keen ob
servations of life as:
• I'm getting dizzy from coloring
this circle.
• Listen to the sun.
• What if orange were colored
green.
• Let's play the good guys are
bad and the bad guys are good.
• We played this two other agos.
• You draw something and I'll
say it's good even if it isn't.

Dear God,
Can't you make church more fun? What about having a
few videos? Just trying to help,
Celia, age 10
Dear God,
Thank you for my parents, my sister Anita, and for my
grandma and grandpa. I forgive you for my brother
Phil. I guess you didn't finish working on him.
Sean, age 12
Dear God,
Did you invent math to count the animals on Noah's
ark? Do we still need it?
Jeanne, age 11
Dear God,
I saw the Grand Canyon last summer. Nice piece of
work.
Alan, age 9
Dear God,
I don't really believe in you but I'm supposed to write
a letter so here goes. Also I want to get in a book. If
you are real why don't you prove it by appearing to
me? I'll be on Schoolhouse Road at 5 O'CLOCK
tomorrow. We'll see.
Laura, age 9
Dear God,
Is there a Christmas in Russia? They got nerve. They
must have stole it from us. Mad, real mad,
Jimmy, age 11
Dear God,
My bat mitzvah is only nine months away. Please think
about me. I hope we can meet. I'll be the red-haired
girl who looks scared.
Shana, age 12
Dear God,
Could you change the taste of asparagus? Everything
else is OK.
Fred, age 9
Dear Santa,
I was going to write God but I heard that you were in
charge of toys.

- These are actual letters collected in David Heller's 1987
book, "Dear God: Children's Letters to God." Heller has
a doctorate in psychology from the University of
Chicago.

Nine" and "Dear God: Children's
Letters to God," which is ex
cerpted on this page, are the
lighter side of children's writing
compilations.
More serious, yet equally as re
vealing is a book of poems and
illustrations by children who were
held in a concentration camp dur
ing World War II called "I Never
Saw Another Butterfly." The book
paints a much darker picture, but

it should be read.
The fountain of youth may be
mythical, but nothing will bring
out the child in you like reading
books for and by children.
And if you've read all the way
to this point, without stopping be
cause you thought children's
literature was anti-intellectual,
then Happy Valentine's Day. If
you haven't read this far, then I
guess it doesn't matter anyway.
