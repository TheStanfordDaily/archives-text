## April Fools' Day comes a bit early 
### 
Ladies and gentlemen, the
heavyweight cham-peen
of the world, Buster
Douglas!
For those of you who spent
the weekend hibernating, or
had a rough night Saturday
and are just getting out of bed
now to find some aspirin and
swear off Burgermeister
forever, that is how Mr.
Douglas is introduced these
days.

Does everyone have the same
reaction to that sentence as I
do?
I mean, what the heck is
this? Some sort of joke? The
heavyweight champion of the
world? The Buster Douglas?
Well, I have a theory to ex
plain this. Now, Sunday was
Feb. 11. What must have hap
pened is that some guys who
work at the local papers were
trying to be funny.
They wanted to run some
joke stories. Now the normal
procedure is to do that on April
Fool's Day. Everyone does it,
everyone who reads the stories
has a good laugh, and then
things go back to normal.
The problem is, a lot of
people have it figured out.
They know stuff is coming that
day, so they don't really believe
the stories.
So these conspirators
decided, "Why wait until 4-1?
Let's do it on 2-11 instead.
Nobody will figure it out and
it'll be a lot of fun."
So they decided to create this
story that Mike Tyson got
knocked on his flabby and out
of-shape backside. They
thought about it for a while
and figured, "Why not?"
With the fight taking place
in Tokyo, no one would know
any better. And with Tyson's
last few fights lasting no more
than about 91 seconds, the
pranksters figured that nobody
watched the fight on television
Saturday night.
So they got together and
came up with this story. They
sent it to ESPN, put it on the
Associated Press wire, and ran
it in all the papers. The fight
will be rebroadcast Friday on
HBO and everyone will watch
it. They'll see that Tyson ac
tually knocked Douglas out in
the second round, that Tyson
barely even got hit. But the
conspirators will have had a
great laugh at the expense of
the American public.
While they were at it,
they decided to come
up with a few more
stories to run. A quick look at

any paper from Sunday will
prove it. The big headlines read
that Nelson Mandela was going
to be freed that day.
Now, we're supposed to be
lieve that South Africa is going
to free this man after holding
him captive for 27 years? This
strikes me as a bit unlikely.
Meanwhile, another story
has West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl saying that he
thinks Germany will be
reunified within two years.
And that the Soviet Union will
allow this to happen.
Yeah, right.
Speaking of the Soviet
Union, they're still trying to
tell us that the Communist
Party there is going to give up
exclusive control of the elec
toral process.
And if all this isn't enough
to convince you that the news
papers were playing a joke on
us, they insisted that the Car
dinal women's basketball team
actually lost a game. And not
to the Lakers or anyone like

So they decided to
create this story
that Mike Tyson got
knocked on his
flabby and out-of
shape backside.

that; they allegedly lost to a
collegiate women's team.
This is just too much for me
to believe in one day.
The beauty of the whole
cover-up, confuse-the
public scheme, is that
nobody can check the results.
Tyson-Douglas was in Tokyo.
Pretoria, Bonn and Moscow are
pretty far away, and Seattle
isn't even that close.
These few guys who are run
ning the hoax have the Amer
ican sports public in the palm
of their hands. They're almost
like OPEC was 10 or 12 years
ago.
I just hope they don't get
cocky from the success of their
jokes this weekend and try to
fool us again. Who knows what
they'll say.
They might try to convince
us that major league baseball
players and owners are risking
forfeiting all the money from
their huge new television con
tract while haggling over who
gets to keep more of the
windfall. Or that a 5-foot-3 guy
is playing in the NBA and is
in the league's top 10 in both
steals and assists. Or even that
Stanford's basketball team is
14-7 after losing six players to
graduation last year.
But I guess nobody would
believe any of those things.

Mike Tyson's next opponent.
