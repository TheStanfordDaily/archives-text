# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Some Stanford athletes can waltz in and
capture The Daily's prestigious Athlete of
the Week award as precocious freshmen.
Others must toil for years in obscurity
before attaining their day in the sun. Such
are the stories of Lori Heisick and Deshon
Wingate, who reign as this week's winners.
Heisick, a 5-foot-6 breaststroker from
Edina, Minn., is the second freshman wom

en's swimmer to be selected for the honor,
and the other was not Janet Evans. Follow
ing on the heels of Janel Jorgensen's selec
tion last week, Heisick provided the biggest
highlight in the Cardinal's 112-28 destruc
tion of No. 4 California Saturday.
Heisick, who came to Stanford perhaps
not as highly touted as her Olympic-medalist
classmates, merely broke the deGuerre Pool,
Stanford, and Pacific 10 Conference records
in the 100-yard breaststroke on Saturday.
Her time of 1:01.38 was 1.12 seconds better
than the previous deGuerre mark, which
Heisick set a few weeks ago.
The old Stanford and Pac-10 mark of
1:01.86 was set by Susie Rapp, silver
medalist at the 1984 Olympics, at the NCAA
Championships. At the NCAAs in March a
rested Heisick could conceivably best the
NCAA record of 1:00.51, set by Texas swim
mer Tracey McFarlane two years ago.

Wingate, a 6-7 junior from Austin, Texas,
embodies the other end of the AOTW spec
trum. In his fourth year on the Farm, the
forward has finally come into his own and
excelled to the best of his athletic abilities
for the Cardinal men's basketball team.
Known for his rebounding and general
athleticism, Wingate was not considered a
scoring threat for the Cardinal by other
teams â€” that is, at least not until Sunday.
When the Washington Huskies tried to
follow that scouting report, Wingate
promptly rewrote the book on the Stanford

offensive attack. When the carnage was com
plete, he had new career highs of 22 points
and 14 rebounds. An alley-oop slam by Win
gate in the first half highlighted an other
wise routine win for the Cardinal.
For the the week, Wingate had 33 points
on 13-of-24 shooting (with a pair of dunks),
as Stanford broke its four-game losing streak
with a sweep of Washington and Washington
State.
