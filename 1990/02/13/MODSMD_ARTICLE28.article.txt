What a difference a hole makes.
After completing the opening
round of yesterday's University of
Arizona Intercollegiate in Tucson
tied for seventh place, this
seemingly simple statement be
came painfully obvious for the
Stanford women's golf team.
The Cardinal's 305 team total
is 14 shots of the blistering pace
set by leader UCLA. Perrenial
powers Arizona State, San Jose
State, and host Arizona are all
within six strokes of the Bruins.
Stanford's score could have
been five strokes lower had the
team been able to succesfully
navigate the 18th hole of the Ran-

Women's Golf
dolph Park North Course.
According to Coach Tim
Baldwin, the finishing hole in
Tucson is a "difficult little par-4,
with a pond guarding the entry
path to the green." That water
hazard proved to be a murky
grave for sophomores Audrey
Wooding and Stephanie Davis,
who both placed approach shots
in the drink. Each suffered a
double-bogey six on the final hole.
Sophomore Adele Moore man
aged to avoid the troublesome

lake, but found sand instead.
After a blast out of the bunker
and two putts, Moore had a bogey
five.
Despite the woes of 18, Baldwin
was satisfied with his team's per
formance.
"We turned a possible 300 into
305 and fell from fifth to seventh
in the process. But, it was one of
the best rounds we played so far
this year, especially through
seventeen holes," Baldwin said.
The Cardinal was led by junior
Jodi Figley, whose solid two-over
par 74 tied her for tenth place
individually. Jean Zedlitz of UCLA
and San Jose State's Dina Am
maccapane share the lead after
opening rounds of 70.

After an up-and-down fall
season, Baldwin was especially
pleased with Figley's play. "It's
great to see Jodi get back on track.
She really hit the ball solid this
round," he said.
Even with their final hole
tragedy, Wooding and Moore both
fired steady 76's to bolster the
Cardinal play at the Arizona In
vite.
Davis and Senior Stephanie
Parel carded a pair of 79's to con
tribute to Stanford's fine first day
showing.
Baldwin was optimistic about
the squad's chances in today's sec
ond round. "We're first off the
tee at 8 a.m., we're hitting it well,
good things should happen."
