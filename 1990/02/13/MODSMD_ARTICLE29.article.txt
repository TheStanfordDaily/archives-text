# Cardinal faces brutal Six-Pac race
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Three teams ranked among the
top six in the country. Six
preseason All-America players.
Enough talent to stock a few of
your favorite minor-league teams.
Looks like another boring year
for Six-Pac baseball.
When the Stanford baseball
team travels to UCLA this week
end to face the Bruins, it will be
starting a Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division schedule that
has the Cardinal facing No. 15
UCLA, No. 1 USC, and No. 6
Arizona State. On successive
weekends.
Today, in an "off' game, the
Cardinal takes on No. 19 San Jose
State in its final tuneup before
division play begins. And, with
the talent that abounds at almost
every school in the league, it looks
to be quite a heated race for the
division championship.
"If you don't play well on a
given weekend in this league,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said, "no matter who you're play
ing, you're going to get beat. We're
hoping, with that year of experi
ence (last season), that we'll be

able to compete for the league
title."
The Cardinal will do much bet
ter than just compete â€” with its
roaring 9-1 start, the team has
risen to No. 2 in the latest
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball poll and
No. 3 in Baseball America's
rankings. USC, top-ranked in the
BA poll, is sixth on ESPN's ledger,
with ASU at No. 8.
In a preseason poll of the
league's coaches, USC was picked
to win the title, followed by Stan
ford, ASU, UCLA, Arizona and
California. Here, in the coaches'
predicted order of finish, are cap

sule previews of the Cardinal's up
coming opponents:
USC
Even though Stanford is ranked
higher than the Trojans in three
of the four major polls, the
coaches tabbed USC to take the
conference crown. Why? Experi
ence.
"USC has made the playoffs the
last two years, finished fourth two
years ago, third last year, (and)
they've got basically everybody
back," Marquess said. "I think
they deserve to be No. 1. . . .
They're the team to beat."
The Trojans, who are 5-2, are
led by consensus All-America sec
ond baseman Bret Boone, who led
the team in home runs last year
with nine and placed third on the
squad with 57 RBI. Boone, who
was an All-Pac-10 player in 1989,
is joined by outfielder John Jack
son, named a preseason All-
America by BA, and outfielders
Mike Robertson and Mark Smith,
who were both second-team
Freshman All-Americans last
season.
Arizona State
The Sun Devils, who dropped
two of three to No. 1 Texas (ESPN

poll) last weekend, have 22 players
on their roster. Eighteen of them
are freshmen, sophomores or
junior-college transfers. The
Devils' nucleus will consist of
shortstop Anthony Manahan, who
led the Six-Pac in hitting (.387)
last year, and outfielder Mike Kel
ly, 1989's Collegiate Baseball
Freshman of the Year.
At pitcher, JC transfer Douma
was 3-0 with a 1.16 ERA before
the Texas series, and sophomore
Sean Rees was also 3-0, sporting
a 2.42 ERA.
UCLA
Speed and pitching are the
name of the game for the Bruins:
Four players who hit double fig
ures in steals are back, as are
pitchers who tossed 525% of last
year's 527 innings.
"UCLA's very sound," Mar
quess said. "They think this is
one of their better teams. They
played very well at the end of the
season, and I think they're going
to surprise a lot of people because
of their pitching."
Arizona
"Arizona has a whole new team
