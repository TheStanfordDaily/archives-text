# Stanford Golf Course raided by police
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
The California Alcoholic Beverage Control
agency raided the Stanford Golf Course's Club
house Restaurant Friday, and the restaurant
will be indefinitely suspended from selling
beer and wine.
At the 5:25 p.m. raid, investigators con
firmed a tip they and The Daily received last
week that the restaurant had been operating
without a license to sell alcoholic beverages.
The restaurant had sold beer and wine with
out a liquor license since 1985, when John
Hutchinson became the owner, according to
investigators. The restaurant is leased to
Hutchinson by the University and is under
the supervision of the Department of Athletics.
When asked whether he knew of the permit
violation before Friday's raid, associate athle
tic director Alan Cummings said yesterday"it
would be premature to get into that now"
but said later in an interview with the Stan
ford News Service that he had known about
the problem as early as last spring.

As a result of the investigation, Cummings
said in the future the Athletics department
"would make sure that (Hutchinson] is con
forming to the terms of his contract."
In addition to operating without a liquor
license, the restaurant may have violated al
cohol regulations by not buying its beer and
wine through an alcohol distributor, according
to a Beverage Control spokesperson.
Instead of using a distributor, Hutchinson
often asked employees to buy cases of beer
at local grocery stores for sale at the restau
rant and at a concession stand on the tenth
tee of the golf course, said Michelle Baird, a
former restaurant employee.
The restaurant has also come under attack
from a 1988 lawsuit filed by Baird against
Hutchinson and Stanford after she did not
receive worker's compensation for an injury
that severed a nerve in her right ring finger.
At the time of Baird's accident, the restau
rant did not carry compensation insurance
for its employees, although it did have it
"shortly before and shortly after" the accident,
according to Pat Kerwin, Hutchinson's lawyer.

The compensation insurance policy ran out
before Baird's accident because Hutchinson's
wife, who was in charge of renewing the in
surance policy, suffered a brain aneurism and
required two operations, Kerwin said.
Hutchinson was unaware that a new policy
was necessary until it had already expired,
he said.
As a result of the lapse in compensation
insurance coverage, Baird never received any
money for medical bills. Baird still requires
microsurgery in order to increase the use of
her right hand, but she said she cannot afford
to pay for it without compensation.
Instead of going immediately to a trial, the
lawsuit underwent an arbitration hearing last
Tuesday. A decision returned by the arbitrator
on Friday found in favor of the University
and Hutchinson without giving an explana
tion.
The arbitration hearing, however, is not
legally binding to either party. After losing in
arbitration, Baird has the option to request
a trial by jury but faces the additional penalty
of paying all court costs if she loses.
