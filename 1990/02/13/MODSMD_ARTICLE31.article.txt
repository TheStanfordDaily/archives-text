## Buddie wins with mental edge 
### Jay Banfield 
"l believe that I can rise above
any issue of money," junior Steve
Buddie declares with a conviction
that would make anyone hard
pressed to disagree. With scholar
ship money dwindling in the wres
tling program in recent years, the
Stanford wrestling team along
with several other Cardinal ath
letic squads has been forced to
adopt this slogan as their credo.
Not many people believe it so
strongly or use it to such great
advantage as Buddie does, how
ever. "I take great pleasure in
beating a guy who has been given
a full scholarship, and who makes
wrestling his life," he adds with
an air of determination.
Evidently, Buddie has been ex
periencing a lot of that particular
pleasure recently. After wrapping
up last season with a 28-7 record
and a top-16 placing at the NCAA
tournament (177-pound class),
Buddie this year has compiled an
even more impressive record of
20-2-1. Those two losses came in
a very tough field at the recent
Las Vegas Invitational.
However, he does note that "my
record may be a little deceiving."
Buddie only makes this
qualification as a result of the
lack of money. Stanford wrestling

does not have the budget of an
Arizona State or an lowa, and
therefore Buddie and his fellow
grapplers have not had the level
of competition they may have
liked thus far this year. "This fi
nancial situation will always make
Stanford an underdog," declares
Buddie.
Because of its budget, the team
is unable to go up against some
of the powerhouses of the Midwest
and the East on a regular basis.
He believes that this lack of
consistently-challenging competi
tion is the biggest obstacle that
he and his teammates have to
face. It is certainly not an insur
mountable one, though â€” if the
wrestler can use it to his advan
tage.
"Every university has a weight
room, and every wrestler has to
run stadiums," Buddie quickly
noted. At the collegiate level, he
asserts, "All quality wrestlers
have basically the same strength,
agility, and overall talent." What
it then boils down to, he observed,
is searching for the mental edge.
All athletes at one time or an
other have dealt with this ever
elusive advantage. Some have
searched for it in books, while still
others have studied every video-
