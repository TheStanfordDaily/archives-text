## Buddie wins with mental edge 
### Jay Banfield 
"l believe that I can rise above
any issue of money," junior Steve
Buddie declares with a conviction
that would make anyone hard
pressed to disagree. With scholar
ship money dwindling in the wres
tling program in recent years, the
Stanford wrestling team along
with several other Cardinal ath
letic squads has been forced to
adopt this slogan as their credo.
Not many people believe it so
strongly or use it to such great
advantage as Buddie does, how
ever. "I take great pleasure in
beating a guy who has been given
a full scholarship, and who makes
wrestling his life," he adds with
an air of determination.
Evidently, Buddie has been ex
periencing a lot of that particular
pleasure recently. After wrapping
up last season with a 28-7 record
and a top-16 placing at the NCAA
tournament (177-pound class),
Buddie this year has compiled an
even more impressive record of
20-2-1. Those two losses came in
a very tough field at the recent
Las Vegas Invitational.
However, he does note that "my
record may be a little deceiving."
Buddie only makes this
qualification as a result of the
lack of money. Stanford wrestling

does not have the budget of an
Arizona State or an lowa, and
therefore Buddie and his fellow
grapplers have not had the level
of competition they may have
liked thus far this year. "This fi
nancial situation will always make
Stanford an underdog," declares
Buddie.
Because of its budget, the team
is unable to go up against some
of the powerhouses of the Midwest
and the East on a regular basis.
He believes that this lack of
consistently-challenging competi
tion is the biggest obstacle that
he and his teammates have to
face. It is certainly not an insur
mountable one, though — if the
wrestler can use it to his advan
tage.
"Every university has a weight
room, and every wrestler has to
run stadiums," Buddie quickly
noted. At the collegiate level, he
asserts, "All quality wrestlers
have basically the same strength,
agility, and overall talent." What
it then boils down to, he observed,
is searching for the mental edge.
All athletes at one time or an
other have dealt with this ever
elusive advantage. Some have
searched for it in books, while still
others have studied every video-
tape on the subject. For Buddie,
it seems to come naturally.
Before every match, Buddie
"calls to mind every experience
he has ever regretted." Inevitably,
though, the thought of losing his
high school state championship to
one G.T. Taylor dominates his
thoughts. One might think that
these negative images might ac
tually work against an athlete, but
Buddie has a knack for making a
seeming disadvantage work in his
favor.
To prove this, when he met
Taylor once again, Buddie was
able to overcome his mental
nemesis and exact revenge. The
victory was especially sweet be
cause Taylor, who wrestles for Ar
izona State, is on a full scholarship
and has "probably made wrestling
his life," Buddie said.
"G.T. hasn't improved that
much," he commented. And after
a pause, he added, "I think I
have."
Buddie is apparently looking to
continue that improvement. With
a big match this weekend against
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo (the
final home match of the season),
he is making preparations to drop
down from his current 177-pound
class to the quicker 167-pound
category. The reason? Looking for
another edge.
"By the end of the match," ad
mits Buddie, "I definitely feel his
[the opponent's) weight." Thus,
by dropping one weight class, he
hopes that he can turn the tables
and make others feel as if they
are at the disadvantage.

1 take great pleasure
in beating a guy who
has been given a full
scholarship, and who
makes wrestling his
life.'
— Steve Buddie

One cannot help but think that
there might also be an ulterior
motive lurking somewhere behind
this very rational reasoning. Con
fides Buddie, "I have always
dreamt about winning the big one
against Dan St. John." St. John,
of ASU, is the defending national
champion at the 158-pound class,
and has been tabbed by some as
the best wrestler in the country.
Coincidentally, St. John has
decided to move up to the very
same class that Buddie is moving
down to, 167.
That, though, is off in the dis
tant future for Buddie. First, he
must concentrate on winning the
remaining Pacific 10 Conference
matches, so as to assure himself
of a good seeding at the Pac-10
Tournament. In so doing, he will
improve his chances of finishing
in the top three in the conference
and thus receive a return invita
tion to the NCAA Tournament in
College Park, MD.
Then, and only then, can he
begin to look toward his Ail-
American aspirations and a pos
sible dream matchup with St.
John. If the G.T. Taylor story is
any indication of things to come,
St. John may have his hands full.

Junior Steve Buddie, shown here battling a tough competitor, has
compiled a 28-7 mark this season. The grappler captain from Berea,
Ohio, who finished in the top 16 in his weight class at the NCAAs
last year, plans to drop to the 167-pound class in the hopes of
capturing an NCAA championship in late March.
