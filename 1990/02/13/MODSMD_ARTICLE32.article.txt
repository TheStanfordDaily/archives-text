# O'Brien quietly one of the nation's toughest
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Sophomore Alex O'Brien does not
have the best serve on the men's tennis
team.
He doesn't have the most powerful
groundstrokes or the best volleys.
Johnathan Stark has better touch, and
Glenn Solomon is just as consistent.
But on a big point — at 5-all in the
third — no one is better than O'Brien.
"He's one of those guys who just
has a knack for coming up with the
big shot whenever he needs it,"
Solomon said.
Ironically, it was the lack of "coming
up with the big shot" that hurt O'Brien
this past weekend at the Rolex Na
tional Indoor Championships in Min
nesota. Up 5-3 in the first-set tie
breaker against No. 4 Todd Martin of
Northwestern, O'Brien let the match
slip away. "I played a tight point, and
then he hit a good serve," said O'Brien,
who beat No. 11 John Falbo of Kansas
in the first round, 6-2, 1-0. "I didn't
execute well [at the end of the tie
breaker]."
O'Brien's eventual 7-6, 6-3 loss, how
ever, did not worry Stanford Coach
Dick Gould. "lAlexl is one of 16 guys
in college tennis who can win the
NCAAs," Gould said. "I say that be-

The guy is so mentally
tough off the court. I'm
just glad I don't have to
play against him.'

cause of his mental toughness, because
of the way he responds to pressure
situations, and because of the way he
can come back.
"He does tend to get a little tentative
sometimes," Gould added. "He needs
to realize that when he's playing his
best, he is attacking."
O'Brien, who has been working es
pecially hard on improving his serve
and-volley game, agreed. "Lately, I
have been trying to attack more. Last
year, I would play conservatively on
the big points, but now I am trying
to put pressure on my opponent. It's
a nightmare to lose a big point just
because you didn't take chances."
Meanwhile, O'Brien can take solace
in the fact that Martin went on to win
the tournament, beating three of the
top-five players in the country in the
process. Still, O'Brien is anything but
content. "The one thing the tourna
ment let me know is that I am as good
as all the players there," O'Brien said.
That's not a pithy statement consid
ering the top five players in the NCAA
rankings attended the tournament.
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger, who
traveled to Minnesota with the soph
omore star, said O'Brien was extremely
close to winning the match. "He
needed to pass well, return well and
hit penetrating groundstrokes. He
didn't quite do that," Whitlinger said.
"Still, Alex did not play his best and
came awfully close to winning that
match. That's saying a lot."
Whitlinger also praised O'Brien's
mental game. "You know when you go
out onto the court with Alex that he
is going to give you 110 percent. He's

definitely a fighter."
O'Brien's mental toughness, how
ever, is not confined to the tennis
court. "We used to play pranks on
Alex all the time," said Tom Leven
berg, a friend of O'Brien's in Donner
last year. "The thing was, Alex would
never give up. He would know how to
wait just long enough — pretend like
he wasn't playing or something — and

then he would attack when we weren't
ready. The guy is so mentally tough
off the court. I'm just glad I don't
have to play against him on the court."
O'Brien, who presently plays No. 2
singles behind Stark, looks forward to
competing against lesser competition
as the top-ranked Cardinal squares off
against UC-Santa Barbara today at
1:30 p.m. in Stanford Tennis Stadium.

cause of his mental toughness, because
of the way he responds to pressure
situations, and because of the way he
can come back.
"He does tend to get a little tentative
sometimes," Gould added. "He needs
to realize that when he's playing his
best, he is attacking."
O'Brien, who has been working es
pecially hard on improving his serve
and-volley game, agreed. "Lately, I
have been trying to attack more. Last
year, I would play conservatively on
the big points, but now I am trying
to put pressure on my opponent. It's
a nightmare to lose a big point just
because you didn't take chances."
Meanwhile, O'Brien can take solace
in the fact that Martin went on to win
the tournament, beating three of the
top-five players in the country in the
process. Still, O'Brien is anything but
content. "The one thing the tourna
ment let me know is that I am as good
as all the players there," O'Brien said.
That's not a pithy statement consid
ering the top five players in the NCAA
rankings attended the tournament.
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger, who
traveled to Minnesota with the soph
omore star, said O'Brien was extremely
close to winning the match. "He
needed to pass well, return well and
hit penetrating groundstrokes. He
didn't quite do that," Whitlinger said.
"Still, Alex did not play his best and
came awfully close to winning that
match. That's saying a lot."
Whitlinger also praised O'Brien's
mental game. "You know when you go
out onto the court with Alex that he
is going to give you 110 percent. He's

definitely a fighter."
O'Brien's mental toughness, how
ever, is not confined to the tennis
court. "We used to play pranks on
Alex all the time," said Tom Leven
berg, a friend of O'Brien's in Donner
last year. "The thing was, Alex would
never give up. He would know how to
wait just long enough — pretend like
he wasn't playing or something — and

then he would attack when we weren't
ready. The guy is so mentally tough
off the court. I'm just glad I don't
have to play against him on the court."
O'Brien, who presently plays No. 2
singles behind Stark, looks forward to
competing against lesser competition
