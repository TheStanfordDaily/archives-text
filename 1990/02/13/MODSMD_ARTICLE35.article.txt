Returning from what Coach Frank Brennan
termed a "rugged" trip to Minneapolis for the
Rolex National Indoor Championships, the
women's tennis team is glad to be back home.
Though Stanford could not boast of having
the Rolex champion, Brennan felt his players
at the tournament did well — especially in
light of the adversity they faced.
Defending NCAA champion Sandra Birch
reached the semifinals before defaulting to
Pepperdine's Ginger Helgeson, who went on
to win the tournament. Birch had a case of
the flu, and it forced her to opt out of the
match.
Debbie Graham lost to Helgeson but came
back to beat Susan Williams of Texas A&M
in the consolation bracket. She then fell to
Young. Brennan said Graham "had trouble
seeing." He explained that it was dark on the
courts, especially at night.
"We looked very good," Brennan said of the
Stanford women's showing. "Everyone else
looked very good. I'm scared to death."
Card notes
Freshman Meredith McGrath skipped the Rolex
to play in a professional tournament in Wichita,
Kan. She won the doubles title there with Manon
Bollegraf of the Netherlands.
