# Women's hoops drops a notch in poll
## 
### 
Louisiana Tech (21-0), the only
remaining Division I women's bas
ketball team with a perfect record,
was also perfect in the latest As
sociated Press poll.
The Techsters, No. 1 for 10
weeks, received all 66 first-place
votes and 1,650 points from a
nationwide panel of women's
coaches.
Meanwhile, ranked teams from
a week ago combined for 11 looses
— seven to each other and four
to outsiders.
Washington's upset of previos
uly unbeaten and second-ranked
Stanford enabled UNLV to move
to No. 2. The Rebels (21-1) com
pleted their first-ever season
sweep over Long Beach State and
received 1,559 points.
Stanford (20-1), tied with Wash
ington for first in the Pacific 10

Conference, fell to No. 3.
Washington (19-2), whose only
Pac-10 obstacle is Oregon
on Saturday, jumped two spots to
fifth with 1,354 points.
"Stanford was a great win, no
doubt," Washington coach Chris
Gobrecht said, "but we're going
to have our hands full this week
end at Oregon. If we can get past
that, we should be in good shape
the rest of the way."
On the men's side, the Cardinal
received votes in the poll for the
first time in several weeks.
