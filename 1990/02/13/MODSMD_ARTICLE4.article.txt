# Federal deficit leads to financial aid cuts

In the college world, wars are
fought not with bullets but with
dollars. And with dwindling gov
ernmental support, Stanford's Fi
nancial Aids Office appears to be
losing.
During President Reagan's
eight years in office, the number
of grant awards decreased and the
total dollar amount of student
loans increased. At the same time,
the focus of the U.S. government
switched from giving middle
income students a choice among
institutions to providing the min
imum amount of funding to as
sure access to higher education.
"Financial aid programs are
casualties of the efforts to deal
with the [federal] budget deficit,"
according to Financial Aids Direc
tor Robert Huff.
Ironically, federal student aid
began in the midst of other wars.
During the Cold War, the dis
tant calls of Sputnik prompted the
United States to pour more
money into education. In 1958,
the government bÂ«gan the Na
tional Defense Education Act,
predecessor of today's Perkins
Loan program.
That same year, Stanford
created the Financial Aids Office,
merging aid programs throughout
the University into a single entity.
In 1964, President Lyndon
Johnson initiated the Work-Study
Act as part of his "War on
Poverty." The program subsidizes

launched a grant program that
formed the basis for the Pell
Grant.
Today, these three federal pro
grams account for 90 percent of
financial aid awarded to students.
As the U.S. budget deficit in
creased, federal grants decreased,
causing a rapid expansion in the
use of student loans. Today, more
than 50 percent of funding comes
through student loans, compared
to 17 percent in the 1975-76 ac
ademic year, according to Huff.
Congress justifies this increase
in student loans "since students
are the only benefactors of their
education," he said.
Huff suspects a more political
motivation. Since loans are less
costly to the government than
grants, Congress seems to offer
the same amount of total student
aid while the education budget
appears smaller, he said.
As the education budget
dwindled, the numbers of voca-
