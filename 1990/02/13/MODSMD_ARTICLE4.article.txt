# Federal deficit leads to financial aid cuts

In the college world, wars are
fought not with bullets but with
dollars. And with dwindling gov
ernmental support, Stanford's Fi
nancial Aids Office appears to be
losing.
During President Reagan's
eight years in office, the number
of grant awards decreased and the
total dollar amount of student
loans increased. At the same time,
the focus of the U.S. government
switched from giving middle
income students a choice among
institutions to providing the min
imum amount of funding to as
sure access to higher education.
"Financial aid programs are
casualties of the efforts to deal
with the [federal] budget deficit,"
according to Financial Aids Direc
tor Robert Huff.
Ironically, federal student aid
began in the midst of other wars.
During the Cold War, the dis
tant calls of Sputnik prompted the
United States to pour more
money into education. In 1958,
the government bÂ«gan the Na
tional Defense Education Act,
predecessor of today's Perkins
Loan program.
That same year, Stanford
created the Financial Aids Office,
merging aid programs throughout
the University into a single entity.
In 1964, President Lyndon
Johnson initiated the Work-Study
Act as part of his "War on
Poverty." The program subsidizes

funds.'

taged students. Johnson also
launched a grant program that
formed the basis for the Pell
Grant.
Today, these three federal pro
grams account for 90 percent of
financial aid awarded to students.
As the U.S. budget deficit in
creased, federal grants decreased,
causing a rapid expansion in the
use of student loans. Today, more
than 50 percent of funding comes
through student loans, compared
to 17 percent in the 1975-76 ac
ademic year, according to Huff.
Congress justifies this increase
in student loans "since students
are the only benefactors of their
education," he said.
Huff suspects a more political
motivation. Since loans are less
costly to the government than
grants, Congress seems to offer
the same amount of total student
aid while the education budget
appears smaller, he said.
As the education budget
dwindled, the numbers of voca-
tional schools and older students
increased dramatically, increasing
the demand for student aid. "More
and more students in more and
more institutions are competing
for federal funds," Huff said.
More importantly, the imple
mentation of the congressional
methodology on student monies
prevents the Financial Aids Office
from providing other important
services.

Government regulations force
the office to use a standardized
process for determining need, re
stricting flexibility and causing
administrative headaches, Huff
said. Due to these rules, he added,
the office has become more of a
law enforcement agency rather
than a social agency.
The office must inquire into
every applicant's complete finan
cial aid history, checking the stu
dent's draft and immigration
status. It must also obtain a legal
statement from students to insure
that they are not involved with
drug use or sales while on finan

cial aid.
Because of the bureaucratic
time burden, Huff says that his
office cannot provide the infor
mation, guidance and outreach as
sistance that is truly needed.
For example, since the federal
government controls the financial
aid process,' the applications for
financial aid will not be ready un
til March 6.
However, the process can be
changed. The Federal Education
Act of 1965 reauthorizes student
aid programs approximately every
four years, giving the government
a chance to evaluate its student

aid programs.
"Students and college ad
minstrators have an opportunity
to shape these issues," Huff said.
Despite the budgetary con
straints on both Stanford and the
Department of Education, Stan
ford has never cut its undergrad
uate aid in any way. "Stanford
has the strongest and most con
sistent commitment to student
aid," Huff said.
While this year's operating
budget cut the administrative
funds of the Financial Aids Office,
no cuts to undergraduate aid have
been proposed for the near future.
