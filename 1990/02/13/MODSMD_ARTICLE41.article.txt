# Unknown affliction fells trees

Planted nearly a century ago
when Stanford was just a seedling
institution, the campus'
eucalyptus trees may not be
around for the the blossoming
Centennial Celebration.
Several blue gum eucalyptus, of
the species eucalyptus globulus,
located in the grove opposite Stan
ford Stadium and on Campus
Drive near Panama Street, have
died suddenly and unexpectedly,
according to Herb Fong, manager
of grounds and custodial services.
The first victims were found on
campus early in 1988, leading to
an investigation into the cause of
death. Larry Costello, a horticul
ture adviser at UC-Berkeley who
was called in for the investigation,
said the campus trees suffered a
similar ailment as one that has
affected many trees in the Bay
Area.
"We first saw the 'Sudden
Death' disease about a year before
in the Bay Area," Costello ex
plained. "The trees on campus
had the same symptoms."
"They look normal until late
summer or early fall. Then in
about four to eight weeks they
are completely dead," said Art
McCane, a plant pathologist at
Berkeley.
The exact cause of death has
not yet been determined, but a
fungus has been isolated from the
water-conducting tissue of the
trees. "It seems that the fungus
invades through the roots and

causes vascular streaking, which
plugs up water movement and the
tree dies," McCane said.
"It's all still kind of a mystery,"
admitted McCane.
Affected trees range from Bur
lingame to as far north as Vallejo,
said Costello. "They are all
episodic. Trees are dying here and
there. The critical thing is that it
isn't all over. Our greatest con
cern is that it doesn't spread," he

said.
The impact on campus has been
relatively minor. The major cost
has been in removing the trees,
which Fong estimated at $6,000.
"There is a potential for some
hazardous situations by the Sta
dium because it is used for
parking for concerts and games,
and some damage might occur if
part of a dead tree were to fall,"
he said.

Nearly a century old, Stanford's eucalyptus trees are inexplicably
dying. A possible cause of death is a fungus in the water.
