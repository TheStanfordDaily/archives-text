# Employees worry about losing jobs
## Budget slashes mean cuts in staff 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
In the controller's office at En
cina Hall, one thing is on every
one's mind: layoffs.
At Old Union, some office staff
are worried that fewer people will
soon be doing more work for less
money.
Throughout the University, em
ployees are wondering how their
lives will be affected by last week's
announcement that a cut in the
University's operating budget will
result in staff reductions.
"People are talking about it all
the time," said one manager in
the controller's office, who did not
want to be identified. "This morn
ing, people came in saying, 'Gee,
I had a tough weekend. All I did
was sit around worrying about
my job.' And I said, 'Me, too.' "
On the desks of many office
workers lies a copy of an open
letter to faculty and staff from
Provost James Rosse, distributed
last Thursday afternoon. The let
ter outlines the University's deci
sion to slash $22 million from its
operating budget in the next 18
months — an action that may
result in staff layoffs.
The budget cut is necessary,
Rosse said, because the University
will face increasing budget deficits
for the next several years if it
doesn't significantly trim its ex
penditures. The crunch is coming
now because government
sponsored research has signifi
cantly reduced the University's in
come at a time when it is becom
ing increasingly difficult to raise
either tuition or the overhead cost
rate on research grants, he said.
Faculty will not be affected by
the cuts. Rather, staff will bear
the brunt of the reductions be
cause their salaries and benefits
make up two-thirds of the budget,
Rosse said.
No decisions have yet been
made, but the cuts may affect vir
tually every University operation,
from the Office of the President
to Operations and Maintenance.
"I can't speak for how employ
ees feel, but there is some level
of anxiety," said Mary Moore, di

rector of Human Resources Serv
ices. "It varies by person, and it's
based on how vulnerable people
feel in one place or another, how
close they are to teaching and re
search activities, whether their
department has a reputation for
being overstaffed, and so on."
Rosse said academic programs
and student services will be con
sidered last for budget cuts, and
employees in those areas are
breathing easier than some in
other areas. And Moore empha
sized that layoffs are the last
resort — actions such as salary
reductions, hiring freezes and
benefits cuts will be considered
first.
The leadership of the United
Stanford Workers is not particu
larly concerned about the staff
cuts, according to field represen
tative Rodney Barnette.
"I don't think anything's going
to adversely affect us," Barnette
said. "Any cuts would have to be
bargained with us, and in those
areas we're pretty much stream
lined already."
The USW will, however, send a
letter to University officials re
questing information about the
budget cuts and asking for union
participation in determining
where cuts will be made. The
USW represents about 1,300 tech
nical, maintenance and service
workers.
But for University office
workers whose jobs may be hang
ing in the balance during the next
18 months, there are few as
surances to ease the tension.
"I think a lot of people are
worried about it," said one em
ployee in the Bursar's Office. "We
might have the same amount of
work with fewer people."
"I knew the budget was tight,
but I didn't know it would be
something like this," another
said. "But I'm not terribly con
cerned about it. Anything's pos
sible, but since we're in student
services I've hoped they wouldn't
do anything here."
At Encina, the anxiety is more
evident: "A lot of people are
