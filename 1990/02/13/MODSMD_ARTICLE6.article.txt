His favorite joke is "college."
His second favorite joke is "grad
school." And junior Foster
Johnson says his victory in last
week's Certs College Comedy
Competition was his first, except
for "getting into Stanford."
Nancy Noelke, program coor
dinator for Tresidder Programs,
which arranged to bring last
week's comedy competition to
Stanford, described Foster's win
ning routine: "It was great. He
has a deadpan humor that takes
you by surprise. That's what the
audience really liked."
The judge of the contest, pro
fessional comedian Brad Reeder,
presented Johnson with a plaque
which Johnson waved proudly
above his head. "I now have this
terrific plaque, upon which the
Certs logo is five times the size
of anything else," he quipped.
He also received two packages
of spearmint-flavored Certs
breath mints for competing. "I
feel a little ambiguous at being
a spokesman for bad breath,"
Johnson said in an interview.
The videotape of his Coffee
House routine, which was filmed
by contest officals, is currently
competing against others in the
region. "Big Brother hasn't told
me any news, but maybe one
day I'll get a phone call from
the judges, saying, 'Dude, you're
all the way to Miami Beach!' "
Johnson explains what would
happen if he won the regional

in a regional coniesi.
competition: "I would be
televised, telling jokes amongst
several thousand fraternities.
The situation is somewhat
similar to a Christian among the
lions. Or a heathen among the
lions. Or maybe a Christian
among the heathens, I'm not
really sure."

The winner of the final com
petition in Miami Beach would
tour New York comedy clubs for
a week, a task that Johnson says
would require great spiritual
strength.
"I think that comedy is a call
ing, kind of like the priesthood,"
Johnson says. "1 definitely want

to get one of those funny hats,
like the Pope."
Johnson actually has serious
motivations for becoming a com
edian. "I do comedy because how
often can you get up in front of
a big group of strangers to say

Junior Foster Johnson clowns around after his victory in the Certs College Comedy Competition
at the Coffee House last week. His routine was judged by a professional comedian and entered
mean things and get applauded
for it? You should try it,"he says.
Johnson creates his routines by
"keeping my eyes open." Unlike
most comedians, he does not
prepare formal routines. "I don't
really tell jokes; I find it hard to
top the society that we live in."
Johnson looks to Richard Pryor,
Jay Leno and Dan Quayle as the
gods of comedy. He enjoys Eddie
Murphy, but says,"I don't look
nearly as good as he does in a
leather leisure suit."
The aspiring comedian sees
himself more as "the white Woody
Allen," but dormmate Peter
Habicht says, "Foster will be the
next Sam Kinison — not in ap
pearance, but in satire, of course."
Johnson attended Wesleyan
College, worked for several years,
and then came to Stanford be
cause he always wanted a Stan
ford sweatshirt. "Had I known
they cost $50 apiece, I might still
be in New York."
As a transfer student, he eyes
Stanford with a fresh perspective.
Humorous comments are based
on his many interesting observa
tions about the campus. "Why can

funny hats, like the
Pope wears.'

I buy drugs from the guy down
the hall, but I get carded at the
library? I haven't figured it out
yet. .. . How can I, a 24-year-old
junior, end up living with an 18-
year-old senior? ... I thought 1
was funny, but the people at the
Housing Office are the real com
edians around here."
California is definitely a radical
change from his previous resi
dence in New York City. "I like
dirt and pollution," says Johnson,
in defense of the city where he
lived the past three years.
Prior to his transfer to Stan
ford, Johnson worked as a
screenwriter and story editor for

Cinema Seven Productions on
such productions as "The Blob."
"My function was quality con
trol," Johnson explains. "If we got
anything of quality in the office,
my job was to eradicate it."
Johnson does not harbor pleas
ant feelings toward the movie in
dustry. "The problem with the
movie business was that people
worked about two steps on the
moral ladder below Congress
men," he notes. "It's kind of a
slimy business, but it sure beats
working."
Besides comedy, Johnson's
other activities include bowling
and semiotics. He also dabbles
with music, much to the chagrin
of his dormmates. His musical
tastes vary, but he says his favor
ite type of music is "loud."
For the most part, though, those
close to Johnson hold a special
place in their hearts for the com
edian, whose intense sense of
humor eliminates all possibility
of maintaining serious facial ex
pression.
"Foster is the funniest man in
the United States," says freshman
Nick Clemens, a fellow Serra res
ident. Here, Johnson interjects,
"Yeah, right. Today, Stanford; to
morrow, the world."
