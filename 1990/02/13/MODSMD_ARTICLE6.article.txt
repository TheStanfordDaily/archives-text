His favorite joke is "college."
His second favorite joke is "grad
school." And junior Foster
Johnson says his victory in last
week's Certs College Comedy
Competition was his first, except
for "getting into Stanford."
Nancy Noelke, program coor
dinator for Tresidder Programs,
which arranged to bring last
week's comedy competition to
Stanford, described Foster's win
ning routine: "It was great. He
has a deadpan humor that takes
you by surprise. That's what the
audience really liked."
The judge of the contest, pro
fessional comedian Brad Reeder,
presented Johnson with a plaque
which Johnson waved proudly
above his head. "I now have this
terrific plaque, upon which the
Certs logo is five times the size
of anything else," he quipped.
He also received two packages
of spearmint-flavored Certs
breath mints for competing. "I
feel a little ambiguous at being

lions. Or a heathen among the
lions. Or maybe a Christian
among the heathens, I'm not
really sure."

The winner of the final com
petition in Miami Beach would
tour New York comedy clubs for
a week, a task that Johnson says
would require great spiritual
strength.
"I think that comedy is a call
ing, kind of like the priesthood,"
Johnson says. "1 definitely want

to get one of those funny hats,
like the Pope."
Johnson actually has serious
motivations for becoming a com
edian. "I do comedy because how
often can you get up in front of
