onate a coat to the Bay Area
homeless and get an extra
10% off your Valentine's Day
Sale purchases at The
North Face factory outlets.
For too many people, survival is a
matter of staying warm one more
night. So, this Valentine's Day
we're asking you to share some
much-needed warmth with the Bay
Area's homeless.
Here's how. From February
14th through the 19th, bring your
clean, used coats to any of our
three Bay Area factory outlets.
Donated coats will be distributed to
the homeless with the help of the Sao
Francisco Coalition on Homelessness,
the Emergency Services Network
of Alameda County, and the
Urban Ministries of Palo Alto.
In return, you can replace
your coats with the ultimate in
outdoor survival gear, and save an
additional 10% off your Valentine's
Day Sale purchases.
Our employees have already
begun by donating more than 300
coats. So come on in to The North
F ace factory outlet nearest you
with your coats and join us in giving
something warm to someone who
needs it. It's not just a nice thought,
it's a matter of survival.
