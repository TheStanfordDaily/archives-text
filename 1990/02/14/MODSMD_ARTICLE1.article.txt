# Senate tackles alcohol policy, phone system
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night endorsed and signed
a letter responding to the University's proposed
alcohol policy, as well as calling for changes to the
new phone system.
The letter asks that dorm funds be available to
be spent on alcohol, claiming that the proposed
policy by Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
"eliminates democratic decision-making within res
idences and contradicts the current policy issuing
responsibility to the individual."
At present, students in residences are allowed to
vote that dorm funds be used to purchase alcohol,
a policy that has lately come under criticism by the
University Alcohol Policy Task Force due to liability
problems.
While the letter states that the University should
ban alcohol from being brought into Stanford Sta
dium, it also recommended that beer be sold inside
the gates. Currently, people 21 years or older are
permitted to bring one six-pack of beer into the
stadium, but no alcohol is sold inside.
The letter also supports the alcohol policy's rec
ommendation that the Department of Athletics not
allow promotion and advertising of alcohol at sports
events and that students convicted of driving while
intoxicated be stripped of their right to a campus
parking permit during the year following the con
viction.
The bill passed on an undivided voice vote.
The senate also passed a bill calling for the soon
to-be University phone system to implement several
unplanned features including "pro-choice long dis
tance" carrier selection, according to the bill's co
author, Douglas Bone.
The bill also asked that University President
Donald Kennedy reiterate his promise made at the
last senate meeting that "rates will be kept low or
Stanford will get out of the phone business."
Introducing a separate bill during the meeting,
graduate senator Peter Thiel called for the senate
to research UC-Irvine Prof. Gordon Chang's alleged
involvement with the League of Revolutionary
Struggle. On Monday, the Stanford Review reported
that Chang wrote an article for the Maoist group's
publication "The Forward Journal of Socialist
Thought."
Thiel said that "there are some grave concerns
about Professor Chang's competence," adding that
just as he is "against a Nazi teaching German
studies, (he is] against a Maoist teaching Asian
studies."
Chang is one of two candidates being considered
for an Asian-American scholar po
sition at Stanford.
Thiel added that he "would like
Professor Chang to clarify his po
sition as soon as possible."
Several senators attacked
Thiel's bill, saying that it smacked

of McCarthyism. Senate associate
Kevin Lewis said he "was abso
lutely sickened tonight to see an
attempt at restricting free speech
on this campus."
Thiel denied the charges of
McCarthyism, saying that the
issue revolved around Chang's fit
ness for the teaching post.
The bill was defeated on a
divided voice vote.

In other ASSU action, the sen
ate confirmed senator Sophia
Shing as associate administrative
manager and approved the
budgets for special fee groups. It
also gave $200 to Arroyo House
to help support a visit by Rosa
Parks, a prominent civil rights ac
tivist, as well as $200 to fund
seven delegates to travel to the
United States Student Association
conference in Washington, D.C.
