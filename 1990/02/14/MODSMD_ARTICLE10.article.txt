# More revenue, much less pain than cookies
## Senior Class presidents to offer computer dating for romance, profit 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
How sexually frustrated are you?
How far do you like to go on a first date?
In response to these questions, most people
would: a) assault the questioner, or b) answer
diligently because they are Stanford students
filling out a new questionnaire in hopes of
finding the perfect match.
In order to raise funds for upcoming events,
the Senior Class has organized a computer
dating service for the entire student body,
with matchups to be released today.
"We need revenue and needed to think of
a fundraiser that wouldn't be so much of a
pain . . . like selling cookies," said Senior Class
president Leslie Hatamiya. "We're doing this
more for fun than to set people up. People
always joke about dating on campus. ... It
will be fun to see who is on your list."
"We really don't expect people to take this
thing as a life or death matter," said Will
Kennedy, technical consultant for the Senior
Class computer dating service program. "It's
just the simplest way we can think of to
provide people with their top 10 most com
patible choices."

The dating service is open to all undergrad
uate and graduate Stanford students of any
sexual preference. Participant* must answer
35 personal questions on a scale from one to
five, one meaning "strongly agree" and five
meaning "strongly disagree."
According to Kennedy, the program "takes
the 10 lowest differences in question scores.
Those 10 choices are your 10 best matches."
The questionnaires were distributed to
every dorm on campus. Les Fraley, who helped
develop the form, estimates "between 5 and
10 percent response from the dorms. Some of
the dorms were really good about turning
their forms in, and some were really bad —
maybe because so many other surveys were
passed out at the same time."
Compatibility lists will be available starting
today in White Plaza for $3. Students can
also pick up and turn in questionnaires there
or in the ASSU office.
Some participants are a little hesitant, but
most are looking forward to receiving their
lists.
"I think it's a cool way to meet someone
new — without the pressure of having to go
to a frat party," said freshman Kimberly
Young. "Some of the questions were silly. Al

together, I don't think they give a really com
plete perception of a person ... but the results
should be interesting."
The Senior Class dating service is not the
only means by which Stanford students can
broaden their social horizons.
Those who are more academically-oriented
will be pleased to learn that an assignment
in Computer Science 106 A includes a type of
compatibility program which will simultane
ously exercise coursework knowledge while
assisting in the search for a suitable match.
The more than 200 students in the class
take a personality test, which covers four dif
ferent dimensions of character. After the
results are compiled, the class seating is ar
ranged according to the compatibility of the
students. Lecturer Stuart Reges also arranges
for a small gift exchange to take place between
compatible students.
"It's all meant just for fun," said Computer
Science 1068 instructor Steve Fisher, who in
cludes a compatibility program for his own
classes. Fisher's program, however, matches
students with celebrities. "It's totally fake. It's
a totally bogus thing you'd never use as a
dating service. [But] Computer Science 106 A's
program could be taken much more seriously."
