Troop reductions announced
OTTAWA (AP) - The United States and
the Soviet Union agreed yesterday on a sharp
reduction in troop deployments in Central Eu
rope to 195,000 for each superpower, Canadian
External Affairs Minister Joseph Clark an
nounced.
The United States could keep up to 30,000
troops elsewhere in Europe under the agree
ment, Clark said.
The accord worked out during an "open
skies" conference represents Soviet acceptance
of the initiative President Bush unveiled in
his State of the Union address Jan. 31.
Clark made the announcement in a confer
ence hall with Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze and other foreign
ministers looking on. Baker and Shevardnadze
did not speak.
The United States now has about 305,000
troops in Europe, of which about 275,000 are
on the central front — mostly West Germany
— and 30,000, generally in Navy and Air Force
units, in Greece, Turkey, Italy, Spain and Brit
ain.
The Soviet Union has about 565,000 in East
Germany, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslova
kia — four nations that have shed their
hardline communist governments.
Indian journalist shot
SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Moslem militants

Witnesses also said the body of Inspector

Soviet unrest reported
MOSCOW (AP) — A crowd stormed Com
munist Party headquarters in the Tadzhikis
tan capital of Dushanbe yesterday in ethnic
rioting that has killed at least 37 people and
injured 108, news reports said.
Armenians fled the city by the hundreds to
. escape the violence, which began Monday. The
situation worsened yesterday, with at least 200
new attacks and other incidents despite a cur
few and state of emergency, late-night televi
sion news said.
Soldiers in tanks and armored personnel
carriers were reportedly in control of the cen
tral Asian city 1,600 miles from Moscow, but
violence was spreading to the suburbs, said
Anatoly Larenok, a correspondent for the na
tional newspaper Vozdushny Transport.
"There are tanks guarding key buildings in
the center of the city," he said.
Violence broke out in Dushanbe on Monday
after rumors spread that thousands of Ar
menian refugees — already fleeing ethnic
clashes with Azerbaijanis in the Caucasus —
were being given preference for scarce new
housing.
