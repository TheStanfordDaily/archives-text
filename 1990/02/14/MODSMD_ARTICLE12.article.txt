OTTAWA (AP) — The United States
and its European allies forged agree
ment with the Soviet Union and East
Germany yesterday on a two-stage for
mula to reunite the two Germanys
after 45 years of division, according
to a statement obtained by The Asso
ciated Press.
In the first stage, East Germany
and West Germany would meet on le
gal, economic and political issues, ac
cording to the statement. The talks
would begin soon after East Germany
holds its March 18 national elections.
In the second stage the foreign min
isters of the two Germanys would meet
with the foreign ministers of the
United States, France, Britain and the
Soviet Union "to discuss external
aspects of the establishment of Ger
man unity, including the issues of se
curity of the neighboring states."
Although the statement was not spe
cific, among the "external aspects" to
be considered by the Big Four allies
of World War II — who defeated Nazi
Germany and its allies in the most
devastating war in history — will be
whether the new Germany is a mem
ber of the main Western military al
liance, the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization.
The United States wants a united
Germany to remain in the NATO al
liance.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze met earlier yesterday
along with his West German counter
part, Hans-Dietrich Genscher and with
U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker.
