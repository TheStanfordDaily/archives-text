The assu deserves
kudos for developing an ef
ficient means of integrating
the opinions of their constituents
into their actions.
The new "Dorm Vote" system
— unveiled last week as a method
for gleaning student opinion on the
proposed University alcohol policy
— offers a new way for the Council
of Presidents and ASSU Senate to
get direct input from the student
body.
Introducing important issues at
dorm meetings succeeds in bring
ing these issues to the attention
of students, allowing for intelligent
discussion, and getting a concrete
idea of where the general public
stands.
Of course, there's a catch.
The "Dorm Vote" can only reach
out to those who live in on-campus
dormitories and who attend house

meetings. Off-campus students and
people in campus residences with
out regular meetings (or without
ASSU dorm reps) are dis
enfranchised.
A side effect of this failing is the
fact that the so-called "vote" can
not possibly be a sound gauge of
student opinion, since so many are
unable to participate. For clarity's
sake, the ASSU should use the
term "poll" rather than "vote,"
since voting implies that everyone,
dormitory resident or not, has an
equal chance to express his or her
opinion.
Still, it is encouraging that the
elected bodies are willing to allow
their opinions to be tempered by
the expressed will of the student
body, and perhaps they can now
find ways to reach out to those
who are currently being left out in
the cold.
