# Misleading results

IT IS DOUBTFUL that the up
coming HIV survey, designed
to determine HIV sero
prevalence among college students,
will reveal any helpful information.
The survey will study blood
drawn from students at Stanford
and several other universities
across the nation. At Stanford, the
results will come not from a ran
dom mix of campus students, but
from those who have blood drawn
for other reasons at Cowell Student
Health Center.
And there is reason to believe
that group will not be representa
tive.
Because Cowell is a student
health center, it is only able to
provide confidential, not anony
mous HIV testing. In other words,
although the results are not placed
in the patient's file, he or she has
to give his or her name when

tested.
For that reason, many of the
leaders of the AIDS education com
munity recommend that people go
somewhere other than Cowell to
have blood drawn. Many of the
people this survey is attempting to
detect, then, may purposefully
avoid Cowell and therefore detec
tion.
Since the percentage of college
students infected with HIV is al
ready low (estimated at one in
500), if just a few people who are
HIV positive avoid Cowell, the
results can be altered significantly.
Thus, we cannot accept the
results of this survey — at least
at Stanford — as definitive.
While it is a worthwhile goal to
seek information on the percent
ages of college students who are
HIV positive, this survey is not
the place to look.
