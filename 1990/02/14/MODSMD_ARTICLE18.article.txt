Affirmative action should respond to needy not color

WHAT IS CARRIE Chang really
saying in her Feb.B column
"Beyond the Coloring Book?"
Behind the familiar muddled thinking
("It is only when affirmative action is
skewed, when quotas are used to cur
tail rather than bolster" â€” as if
quotas can ever do one without the
other) is a strong and controversial
position which Chang implies but does
not openly state: that Asian-Americans
deserve to be over-represented in uni
versity admissions but whites do not.
I think that such positions ought to
be stated clearly so they can be
debated openly, and that the current
situation of Asian-American college
applicants provides a good context for
rational debate about the long-term
goals of affirmative action programs.
What is the evidence for interpreting
her column as holding this position?
Chang opposes declining admissions for
qualified Asian-American applicants,
despite overrepresentation, although for
many years there have been declining
admissions of white applicants (to the
point where at 3ome campuses like

Since affirmative action is a zero-sum game,
affirmative action by definition takes slots from
qualified applicants and gives them to un
qualified applicants.

UC-Berkeley whites are under
represented).
What are the merits of her position?
She can take as a fact that whites
have discriminated against all of the
other major applicant groups (by race);
it is also true that of all the groups
only whites and Asian-Americans could
attain proportional or greater represen
tation by qualification alone.
The principal goal of affirmative
action is to undo some of the past
discrimination; the question is when do
we stop? It seems logical that when a
group can fulfill proportional represen
tation by qualification alone, that is
evidence that discrimination and its

effects are no longer a factor that
needs to be remedied, at least in the
aggregate with respect to college ad
missions.
Since affirmative action is a zero
sum game, affirmative action by defini
tion takes slots from qualified appli
cants and gives them to unqualified
applicants. Should then, affirmative
action slots come out of the white pool
or white and Asian-American pool?
If affirmative action is seen as
retribution for past discrimination that
whites ought to pay to minorities, then
the slots ought to all come from the
white pool. If it is seen as quasi
socialism, where the fortunate make
sacrifices for the less fortunate, then

both whites and Asian-Americans
ought to suffer fewer admissions than
qualification alone would merit.
Put another way, what are the long
term goals of affirmative action? To
punish white people until some fair
ness criterion has been reached, or to
try to attain a "level playing field"
where all racial groups can attain
proportional representation solely
through qualification?
Thinking about affirmative action
primarily by race erects barriers which
are destructive to true multicultural
education. It also misses the point that
affirmative action seeks foremost to
address, which is that some or many
but not all members of a minority
group have suffered from the tilted
playing field of discrimination. Affirma
tive action should help people based on
actual need; admitting students based
on the color of their skin serves the
purpose of balancing the colors in a
picture but not the educational poten
tial on a campus.
