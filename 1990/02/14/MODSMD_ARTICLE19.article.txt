# Mandela's freedom came despite lack of Stanford initiative
## 
### 
We were appalled by the self
congratulatory nature of the Feb. 2
Daily editorial concerning Nelson Man
dela.
To quote, "Stanford can take pride
in being a strong force in the move
ment against apartheid." Granted there
are some individual people and groups
on campus that can "take pride."
However, Stanford as a whole must
honestly examine its role and wonder.

"If all other universities and sectors of
society had taken the same half
hearted approach to economic sanc
tions, would Mandela be free today?"
Though a number of other univer
sities appreciated their moral roles in
society as "guiding lights" and adopted
the policy of divestment, Stanford
could only muster up "selected divest
ment."
This policy allowed for Stanford to
maintain investment in companies that
were somehow trying to indicate disap
proval of apartheid even though they
remained in South Africa and thereby
continued to give tacit approval to the
racist system.
Not surprisingly, the rate of divest

ment was too slow for many student
organizations that continued to ask
Stanford to respond "positively to the
students' demands," but to no avail.
Ironically, often the companies
(which Stanford still invests) would
pull out of South Africa on their own
accord, even though they were follow
ing Stanford's guidelines. Luckily for
Mandela, many corporate CEOs were
more sensitive to the call for freedom
than University President Donald Ken
nedy and Stanford's Board of Trustees.
The Stanford student body, as part
of the University, must also bear re
sponsibility. Organizations dedicated to
the movement, like Students for a Free
South Africa and Stanford Out of

South Africa, often dwindled on the
vine from lack of student interest.
Today Stanford, like the rest of the
world, can sing in joy for Mandela's
"freedom." But we should also feel the
pangs of guilt, the pangs of our fruit
less apathy in the past. Only then can
we fully appreciate the price of real
freedom, and hopefully be willing to
pay it for the sake of those oppressed
in South Africa, our own nation and
elsewhere.
