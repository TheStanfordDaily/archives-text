# Trustees approve tuition hike
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
In a meeting yesterday, the Board of Trustees
approved a 5.5 percent combined tuition and room
and board hike for next year, the lowest increase
in 15 years.
Tuition for undergraduate students in academic
year 1990-91 was set at $14,280, up 5.25 percent
from last year, and room and board at $5,930, up
6 percent.
According to Provost James Rosse, the relatively
low tuition increase — last year's was 8 percent —
is the result of the University's recognition that
high increases will place the cost of a Stanford
education out reach for many students.
The 5.5 percent increase will make a Stanford
education "more affordable than it was last year,"
according to Robert Huff, director of financial aids.
The University will try to keep tuition increases
equal to no more than the rate of inflation plus 1
percent, he said.
The lower revenue brought in by tuition "forces
us to reduce expenses," according to Rosse, because

tuition comprises about one-half of the University's
$388 million operating budget.
At last Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting, Rosse
announced the University's plan to cut $22 million
from its operating budget over the next 18 months.
The trustees also approved tuition increases in
the various graduate school programs.
General graduate tuition will rise 6 percent from
last year to $14,280, the same as undergraduate
tuition. Tuition in the School of Medicine will go
up 6.9 percent to $17,925; the School of Law, up
5.1 percent to $14,894; the Graduate School of Busi
ness, up 8.2 percent to $16,575; and the School of
Engineering, up 5.3 percent to $15,000.
In other matters, the board discussed this year's
13 percent drop in the freshman applicant pool. A
committee of the board stated that it is too early
to determine the causes of the decrease but said it
will do so in the coming months. The committee
cited the change in demographics and the Oct. 17
earthquake as likely contributors.
In addition, the Committee on Land and Buildings
approved the final architectural design for Kimball
Hall.
