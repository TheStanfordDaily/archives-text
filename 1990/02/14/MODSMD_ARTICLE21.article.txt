THE RELEASE OF Nelson Mandela
has brought mixed emotions for
me.
Of course I'm happy that Mandela has
been freed from his desolate jail cell. I'm
happy that Winnie Mandela, after 27
years, will finally be able to share the
same bed with her husband. I'm happy
that Mandela's children will no longer
have to view their father from behind
bars. And I'm happy that the black people
of South Africa will be able to enjoy
momentary freedom.
However, I don't have any overwhelm
ing belief in the principles of democracy,
world peace, or racial harmony in South
Africa. How can I, when I know that
President de Klerk's decision to release
Mandela and the other imprisoned
African National Congress leaders had
more to do with dollars and cents than
with any belief in democracy.
For me, the most powerful moment of
Mandela's televised release came at the
end of his speech when he began speaking
to his people in their native language.
Although I didn't understand what Man
dela was saying, I felt a cold chill rush
through my body. Why? Because that
moment showed me how connected and
disconnected I am to black people in
Africa.
I am an African-American. This means
that I have a direct historical and cultural
link to all the black people in Africa.
However, American hegemony has his
torically tried to break this link through
slavery, the American educational system
and the media. Thus it was ironic that
one of the mediums which helped to break

that link was now showing me just how
connected I was to the black people in
South Africa and their struggle. The pic
tures of the black South Africans gath
ered around Mandela mirrored those of
the March on Washington, where Martin
Luther King Jr. stood as a symbol of
hope for freedom.
However, I know that freedom doesn't
come easily. Part of me wants the black
people of South Africa to overthrow the
South African government. Yet another
part of me — the more "rational" or
"democratic" part of me — knows that
violence is wrong, even though the white
government denies blacks the most basic
human rights.
This moral dilemma, between forcibly
attaining equal rights while adhering to
democratic principles, has been the his
toric fate of the black race. In an attempt
to reconcile this dilemma, black people
have assumed a moral and spiritual su
periority over whites by considering
themselves to be more Christian and
democratic than whites. (For black people
who disagree with me, I ask them to
consider where the phrase, "white people
have no home training," is rooted.) I be
lieve it is this moral dilemma which keeps
black people from overthrowing the white
power structure in this country and in
South Africa.
Despite this moral dilemma, there is
one thing that both parts of me have
concluded: democracy in South Africa
won't come without more bloodshed. If
blacks follow the lead of Eastern Europe
by overthrowing the government, I
suspect there will be outrage from all

the Western powers, and they would
probably condemn the blacks as barbaric.
Yet these same Western powers praise
the Romanians for their "heroic" actions
in overthrowing the Communist govern
ment and establishing democracy.

the call for freedom is sweeping the
world. Black people all over the world
are united in their struggle for democ

people will not wait for freedom to be
