## Bug raises goosebumps 
### Megan Beardsley Staff writer 
Q. About goose bumps:
• Do they jump out, or
are they what's left when the
rest of the skin contracts?
A. They're actually a
• combination of both. A
tiny muscle attaches the
roots of hairs to the surface
of your skin. When you are
cold or frightened this
muscle — the arrector pili
— contracts, pushing the
hair up and pulling nearby
skin down, according to Dr.
Youn Kim of the Dermatol
ogy Department at the
School of Medicine. This re
action isn't particularly
helpful, Kim says. It just
happens.
The arrector pili belongs
to a group of muscles called
smooth muscles. These are
different from the skeletal
muscles you use to move
your arms or legs. For one
thing, they look smoother
when you examine them
with a microscope. A more
important difference is that
you can't control them. They
react automatically to hor
mones such as adrenaline.
