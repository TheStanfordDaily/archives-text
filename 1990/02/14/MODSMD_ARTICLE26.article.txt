# Caressing plants makes them short and strong

Talking to your plants won't
work. Neither will playing your
favorite Elvis tunes for them.
Contrary to popular belief,
friendly conversation and sooth
ing music cannot dramatically al
ter a plant's development.
But touch can.
It has long been known that
touch affects plant growth: In ear
lier studies, chrysanthemums
were shown to grow compactly if
shaken several times each day,
and Bonsai tree growers have long
used touch as a shaping technique
for yielding thicker trunks.
Now, researchers at the Medical
Center have actually identified a
set of five plant genes that re
spond to stimuli such as rain,
wind, wounding and simple touch.
Dr. Ronald Davis, professor of
Biochemistry, and postdoctoral
fellow Janet Braam initially set
out to study the effects of spray
ing plants with hormones and dis
covered that several genes in the
plants turned on. Further experi
ments, however, revealed that
spraying water on the plants
activated the same genes.
After extensive study, the re
searchers determined that the im
portant factor wasn't the hormone
or the water. It was the touch.
In a set of carefully monitored
experiments, Braam has followed
the developmental changes in a
group of Arabidopsis, a member
of the mustard family. This
species is a good model for other
plants because of its small size

and simple structure.
Braam compared an experimen
tal group that was touched several
times daily to a control group that
was left alone. One of the most
noticeable differences was height
— the touched plants were several
inches shorter than those which
were not touched at all.
Braam and Davis speculate that
the genes they have identified may
be those primarily responsible for
this response to touch. "When the
plant is stimulated by touch,
within five to ten minutes, all five
of the identified genes become
turned on," Braam said. When a
gene is turned on it produces RNA
from DNA. "Techniques using a
molecularly cloned gene as a probe
can tell us if RNA is being
produced," he added.
Activation of a gene by touch
lasts for about an hour, and then
the plant returns to its normal
functioning. However, continuous
stimulation, like wind or rain, can
keep the genes turned on for long
periods of time and considerably
change the growth of the plant.
This accounts for the develop
mental difference between coastal
trees, which grow shorter and
stockier in their windy and rainy
environment, as opposed to the
inland varieties that live in more
sheltered surroundings.
"Plants cannot move to escape
their environment, so they need
to adapt to the situation," Braam
explained. One way they can do
this is to change their develop
ment. With shorter and stronger

trunks, for example, coastal trees
can better withstand further
stress from high winds and rain.
Few animals have the ability to
do this, but such adaptation is an
especially important characteris
tic for non-mobile organisms like
plants.
Braam and her group have dis

covered that three of the identi
fied genes direct synthesis of
proteins closely related to cal
modulin. Calmodulin is a protein
that binds to calcium, which is
important in the transmission of
stimuli from the outside environ
ment into the celi.
"All five genes respond to all

of the touch stimuli," Braam said.
She has experimented with other
forms of touch, including simulat
ing gusts of wind and wounding
the plants with scissors. "The
plants could sense a wide-variety
of stimuli," she said. "They look
so passive, but they feel touch,
and they're changing."
