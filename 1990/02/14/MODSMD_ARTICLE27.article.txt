# Superconductors may become commercially feasible

A team of Stanford physicists has come
one step closer to making superconductors
practical.
Ted Geballe, professor of applied physics,
John Bravman, assistant professor of ma
terials science, and a group of graduate
students have maintained an electric cur
rent in a thin film of superconductive ma
terial, YBa 2 Cu 3 0 7 , for extended periods of
time.
Superconductors are dependent on three
factors: current, magnetic flux and tem
perature. If any of these factors is increased
too much, the material loses its supercon
ductive properties.
Further, these factors depend on each

other. For example, if the critical temper
ature (the highest temperature at which
the material superconducts) is raised, the
critical current is lessened.
Until a few years ago, the highest re
corded critical temperature for any mate
rial was approximately 23 degrees Kelvin
(-418 degrees Fahrenheit).
But in 1987, materials were discovered
that retained their superconductive prop
erties up to 90 K (-298 F). Because this
is warmer than the boiling point of liquid
nitrogen, which is inexpensive and easy to
obtain, it became commercially feasible to
maintain materials in a superconducting
state.
In theory, if a superconducting material
has its current, magnetic field and tem

perature within the limits, the current
should have zero resistance and flow in
definitely.
However, according to Bravman, "The
idea of critical current is a misnomer. It
implies that the current can go on indefi
nitely with zero resistance, but this is not
the case with higher temperatures."
It had already been proven that it is
possible to reduce the amount of current
dissipation in the higher temperature su
perconductors, and the team of Stanford
physicists set out to demonstrate this ex
perimentally.
"What we did had been done before with
conventional superconductors. It wasn't,
however, really necessary with them be
cause they had a negligible amount of

current dissipation to start with," Bravman
said.
The Stanford physicists brought a su
perconductor at 78 K (-320 F) to its critical
state, so that every part of the material
carried the critical current. Then, the ma
terial was slightly cooled by a one-half of
a degree Kelvin. This decrease in temper
ature raised the critical current slightly.
As a result of the lowered temperature,
the amount of current dissipated decreased.
Although the amount of current dissipated
was reduced to practically zero, it was not
entirely eliminated.
"It is impossible for the current dissipa
tion to completely disappear," Bravman
said. "There will always be some resis
tance."
