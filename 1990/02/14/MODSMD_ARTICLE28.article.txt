# Ladakhs' Tibetan paradise threatened by invasion of Western ideas
## 
### Jessica Hirst Staff writer 
Picture the headlines: "Stan
ford on $100,000 a Day." The
story describes Martian tourists
on a wildly extravagant holiday,
throwing down $100 for a sand
wich at the Coffee House, or
$1000 for that quaint Serra House
T-shirt. The Martians never work,
and they never run out of money.
This is the way the Ladakh, a
Buddhist people in the nor
thernmost part of India, view the
Western tourists who began visit
ing their homeland in the mid
-19705.
Ladakh is part of the high al
titude desert of Tibet, where the
sun shines 300 days a year, the
weather is relentlessly cold and a
foreigner might have trouble
eking out an existence.
Yet amidst the gray expanses

of stony hills are small, well
tended patches of green, lined with
flat-roofed mud houses. These are
the villages of the Ladakh, who
know the secrets of the land. They
grow barley, which prospers up to
an elevation of 14,000 feet.
They use primitive tools, yet
they labor in the fields only four
months out of the year. The
remaining eight months are for
weddings, story-telling and crafts.
Their homes are built with mate
rials from the local environment,
and are surprisingly well
insulated against the frigid
winters.

1 he Ladakh, through centuries
of experience, have learned how
to live in careful harmony with
their natural environment, but
now that harmony is threatened
by the discordant tones of con
ventional development.
Swedish linguist Helena
Norberg-Hodge, who spoke at
Stanford on Jan. 31, is working
to help the Ladakh develop in a
way that preserves their active,
vital enjoyment of life and their
sustainable practices.
Norberg-Hodge, winner of the
1986 Right Livelihood Award
(dubbed the alternative Nobel
Prize) originally came to Ladakh
as part of a film crew. She stayed
on to study the Ladakhi language
and to defend the Ladakh against
what she calls the ruthless con
sumerism that is threatening to
drop an environmental bomb on
their carefully balanced society.

A diesel gas pump looks
remarkably out of place among
the squarish stone and mud tow
ers. The fuel must be brought in
over the mountains, and creates
a new air pollution problem. More
than the physical invasion of the
land that accompanies modern so
ciety, Norberg-Hodge is concerned
about the psychological impact of
development.
"A profound sense is growing,
especially among the young
people, that their own culture is
backward and terribly inferior.
They feel they must become
modern as quickly as possible,"
said Norberg-Hodge.
"There is something else even
more modern than polluting fac
tories and white bread and
agricultural chemicals â€” and that
something is bringing them back
to the very essence of what the

Ladakhi culture is all about," she
added.
To that end, the Ladakh Project
has produced a play in which a
Ladakhi just returning from Cal
ifornia describes natives who
value the stone ground whole
wheat organic bread that the
Ladakhis are giving up for expen
sive modern white bread.
Norberg-Hodge wants to help the
Ladakhis sidestep the years it has
taken modern society to realize
that natural fibers are better than
polyester, and show them that
Ladakh is far ahead of other
societies in terms of long-range
sustainability.
Norberg-Hodge believes that
the standard of living can be
raised without harming the envi
ronment or destroying the ethical
and spiritual foundation of
Ladakh. To that end she supports

biological and cultural diversity,
which she believes to be inex
tricably intertwined.
Specifically, she opposes
centralization of ideas and energy,
and favors what she calls location
specific education to teach
children how to get the most out
of their corner of the earth.
The new modern agricultural
schools promote use of hybrid
seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and
mechanized equipment. Their
books were written by people who
have never been to Ladakh to wit
ness the passing down of detailed
information about the soil fer
tility, topography and tradition
behind each particular family plot.
The Ladakh Project has signif
icance on a global scale, for it is
a precious case study of the effects
of conventional development,
tracked since the first road was
built into the area.
