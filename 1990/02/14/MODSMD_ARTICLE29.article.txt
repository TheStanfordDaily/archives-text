# Angry customers may doom Apple
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Apple Computer is in the headlines
— and that is not good news.
Once the darling of the industry,
the $5 billion personal computer firm
is facing declining profits and slower
revenue growth. In addition, customer
complaints are flooding the Cupertino
headquarters' phone lines.
Apple's troubles are numerous and
in unrelated areas. One problem is
products that do not work as ad
vertised. The most notorious of these
is the I mage writer LQ, a printer that
accepts wide paper and can do color
work.
The LQ has been dubbed the
"printer from hell" by users. Apple
responded to complaints by working
out some bugs in the printer and of
fering free trade-ins to all users last
year. Many took advantage of the pro
gram, but still feel the LQ was de
signed and built by Satan, Inc.
Similarly, the hard disk drives
shipped with thousands of computers
over the past year have failed without
reason. Again, Apple offered a free
fix. Again, it has failed to completely
fix the problem.
Another trouble spot for the firm
is the lack of a low-cost Macintosh.
Many believe an inexpensive machine

would boost sales of all
Macs as it would allow
the computer to
proliferate in businesses
and schools that have
not adopted the ma
chine because of its cost.
Apple does have a
cheap Macintosh — the
Plus — which retails for
near $1,000. But it fails
to satisfy users because

it is underpowered compared to the
company's recent offerings.
This puts Apple in a difficult situ
ation. A low-cost computer that has
enough power to satisfy users might
severely cut into sales of Apple's more
expensive computers that retail for
$3,500 and up.
Still, expect to see a new machine
with a fair amount of power by sum
mer. The board of directors at Apple
has decided getting a low-cost Mac to
market is high on the priority list. If
executed properly, Apple should be
able to bring out the new machine
without killing demand for its other
products.
Unfortunately, history suggests this
will not be the case. Apple has time
and again made older machines ob
solete by producing cheaper, faster al
ternatives. Right now the company
cannot afford to make a similar mis-

take.
The success or failure
of the new product will
have a impact on
whether Apple flies high
in the 1990s or contin
ues to suffer.
So will the introduc
tion of System 7, sched
uled for sometime this
year.
Once upon a time the

Macintosh was a revolutionary prod
uct admired for its ease of use. Com
peting products required training.
System 7, a major revision of the
fundamental software that runs the
Macintosh, is intended to allow Apple
to recapture the technological high
ground. It is also a jumping-off point
for the as-yet-unannounced System 8,
which will theoretically revolutionize
the way people use computers.
Apple realizes the importance of the
product but whether they will deliver
what customers are waiting for — in
a timely manner — is anything but
certain.
How Chairman John Sculley gets
his troops to respond to these chal
lenges will go a long way toward de
termining if Apple is to become the
$10 billion company it hopes to be.
The next 11 months will be interesting
to watch.
