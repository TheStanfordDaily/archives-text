# Detailing history's ins and outs
## Journalist posits vision of racially driven politics 
### Greg Blackwood 
"All of the great issues . . . that
politicians studiously avoid . . . are
at one level or another racially
driven," said Taylor Branch, a
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
and author, in a speech last night
in Kresge Auditorium.
The speech, titled "Outsiders
and Insiders: Race and American
History," explored the role in his
tory of insiders, the mf\jority in
a given population, and outsiders,
the minority.
Branch won the Pulitzer for his
book "Parting the Waters:
America in the King Years, 1954-
63," a documentary on the civil

rights movement and the life of
Martin Luther King Jr.
According to Branch, all history
is a struggle between outsiders
and insiders. While insiders
usually have the advantage, out
siders often have a particular in
sight that evens the odds, he said.
As Branch noted, "outsider cul
tures are known for their special
vision."
The struggle is characterized by
a cyclical conflict in the outsider
culture which tends at times to
assimilation and at other times
to separation, he said. Branch,
who is white, thinks that "we are
now at the end of a long inward
turning period" in black American

history and will soon enter an
other cycle in which black Amer
icans struggle to become further
assimilated into mainstream
American society.
Branch noted that cross
cultural understanding is largely
absent in past generations, a state
of affairs which lends a singular
perspective to American thought.
Racial issues are almost always
foremost in times of change, he
said.
The American media, he
claimed, are as much at fault as
are the politicians. The sensitive,
fundamental issue of racial inter-
action is often poorly covered, if
at all.
Tendencies on both sides of the
racial barrier are to suppress in
formation about any sort of
struggle, especially in times of
agitation, Branch said. It is for
this reason that he believes "racial
histories have always been hid
den" and do not "exist in most
standard historical records."
Another difficulty inherent in
trying to document these racial
differences in print is the cultural
nature of the problem. Because
the issues are so race-specific,
they can most accurately be com
municated only by oral tradition,
he noted.
A native of Atlanta, Branch at
tended the University of North
Carolina and did graduate work
at Princeton University. He has
worked as a writer for Washington
Monthly, Harpers and Esquire
magazines and wrote or co
authored four books before under
taking the six years of research
and writing that led to the pub
lication of "Parting the Waters."
Branch won both the Pulitzer
Prize in history and the National
Book Critics Circle Award for non
fiction last year. "Parting the
Waters" is the first in a two
volume series on the life of Martin
Luther King Jr. and on the
struggle for racial equality in
America.

the struggles between insiders, who he said were the majority, and
outsiders, or minority groups. Branch spoke last night in Kresge
