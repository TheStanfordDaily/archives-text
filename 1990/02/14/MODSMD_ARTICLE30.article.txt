### Katherine Hemela Staff writer 
Stanford's new Center for Biomedical
Ethics, which opens today at the Medical
Center, will provide a focus for research
into some of the most sensitive issues con
fronted by the medical profession today.
Dr. Thomas Raffin, acting chief of the
Division of Respiratory Medicine, and Dr.
Krnle Young, chair of the Stanford Hospital
committee on ethics, began developing the
center eighteen months ago.
Both taught biomedical ethics at Stan
ford and "thought that biomedical ethics
should be solidified and extended" beyond
the classrooms, said Young, who will co
direct the center with Raffin.
John Golensky, a renowned medical eth
icist, will inaugurate the center with a
public lecture called "The Crisis in Amer
ican Health Care: Is Rationing Necessary,"
today at 4:30 p.m. in Fairchild Auditorium.
The lecture is on "one of the most dif
ficult issues which our new center hopes
to address and conduct research in," Young
said. Similar lectures are scheduled for May
and October.
The new center, funded by two anony
mous donors, is planning to conduct re
search into issues the medical community
is confronted with regularly, and provide
students with scholarship money to do re
search in the area.
"We are also interested in developing a
masters degree in biomedical ethics
through the Department of Health Re
search and Policy," Young said. "We would

'We would like to bring
philosophers to the front
lines.'

like to bring post-doctoral fellows to Stan
ford for a year to specialize in bioethics,
to bring philosophers to the Medical Center
for three months to come to the front lines,
and to send physicians to the Department
of Philosophy to get some basic course
work in ethics," he added.
Other plans for the center include pro
moting international conferences and pub
lishing the proceedings of important issues
in biomedical ethics. The first conference,
tentatively planned for 1991, will be titled
"Ethical Ramifications of the New Genet
ics."
Raffin and Young hope that the center
will have a major impact on the education
of the people in the Medical Center and
stimulate discussion in the local commu
nities.
"Stanford is fairly lax in developing a
center of this kind," Young said. Other
major medical centers across the country
have had similar centers for several years.
"However, once such a center is established,
it enables the university to be at the cutting
edge in important issues in applied ethics,"
Young said.
"We hope to be nothing less than the
major West Coast resource for biomedical
ethics," Raffin said.
