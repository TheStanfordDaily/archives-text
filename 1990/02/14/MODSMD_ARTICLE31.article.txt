## Card squeaks out victory in 8th 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Strong pitching is nothing new to
Stanford baseball, which means that the
team's come-from-behind win over San
Jose State yesterday had no unusual
aspects to it. There was power (two
Cardinal home runs), speed (Jeff Ham
monds' steal in the eighth led to the
winning run) and great pitching, from
John Reid.

Hold up. The John Reid who pitched
so poorly in his first two games that
he didn't even get to make the team's
recent trip to Hawaii? That John Reid?
Yup. Reid, who came on in the third
inning of the game, gave up only one
run on two hits in six innings of work
to pick up his first Stanford victory.
And more importantly, he found some
confidence that will help both him and
his team down the road.
"John just hasn't been confident —
he's seemed almost tentative at times,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"Today he went after them a little bet
ter. He needed that, and we needed
that."
"I've been suffering from 'mental
downness,'" Reid said. "I didn't do too
well in my first two games, and I was
in fear that it would happen
again. . . (but) I relaxed today, which I
haven't done before."

Any reason why? "Not getting to go
to Hawaii (last weekend) is a great
stimulant," Reid said.
Marquess agreed. "The greatest
motivator of all is not playing," he said.
"We've got a deep pitching staff. . . It
keeps everyone on their toes and work
ing hard."
Reid took over in the third for lefty
Steve Worrell, who was making his first
1990 appearance on the mound. Worrell,
who has been bothered by a sore shoul
der, only tossed two innings, but didn't
have many problems with the Spartans.
His defense did.
In the top of the first, with men on
first and second via a hit and walk,
designated hitter Pete D'Errico hit a
grounder to second baseman Troy Paul
sen. Paulsen flipped to Roger Burnett
at second — much, much too high. Bur
nett had to leap to catch the ball, and
by the time he fired to first everyone
was safe.
David McCarty then tried to pick off
the Spartan runner at third, which
turned an already ugly play into disaster
for the Cardinal. The throw was in the
dirt, allowing two runs to score. Two
runs, no hits, two errors in one play.
Worrell retired the next five batters
he faced, setting the stage for Reid, who
hadn't pitched well in his first two out
ings. And, when he gave up a solo home
run to Jeff Ball in the third, it looked
like he might be in for another long day
Then something funny happened.
Reid, who had walked eight and struck
out four before yesterday, allowed only
two Spartans to reach base in the next
five innings. By the time he was taken
out in the ninth, Reid had struck out

six, walked none and given up only two
hits, effectively shutting down the Spar
tan attack.
While Reid stifled the Spartans, the
Cardinal offense was slowly creeping
back into the game against San Jose's
Mark Ringkamp. Troy Tallman hit a
solo home run in the third, and Tim
Griffin pounded his fourth homer of
the season — all of them leading off
an inning — in the fifth. Well, maybe
"pounded" isn't quite the right word.
The ball was pretty much popped up
to left, took a long ride on the wind,
and landed just over the fence.
"On a normal day that's an F-7,"
Spartan Coach Sam Piraro said. "Un
fortunately, on this day it wasn't."
Stanford followed up Griffin's hit
with four straight singles to knot the
score, but, with the bases loaded and
no outs, Jeff Hammonds popped up and
Paulsen hit into a double play. Tie game.
Things stayed calm until the bottom
of the eighth, when Hammonds led off
with a single and — surprise — stole
second by a mile. After Paulsen flew
out, McCarty hit a liner just over the
shortstop's glove. Hammonds, who was
dancing off second, paused to make sure
the ball reached the outfield and then
took off. Left fielder Eric Booker picked
up the ball, Hammonds steamed toward
home . . . and Booker threw to second
Hello? "(Booker) felt he didn't have
a play," Piraro said. "I think he made
the right decision. I don't think there's
any way in hell we're going to get Ham
monds on that play."


A! Green — Daily
Second baseman Roger Burnett and the Cardinal bounced back from a 3-0 deficit
to take a 4-3 thriller from San Jose State yesterday.
The Spartans came right back
in the top of the ninth. Reid gave
up an opening single to D'Errico
and was pulled in favor of Aaron
Dorlarque. The next batter hit a
chopper back to the pitcher, mov
ing D'Errico to second.
Dorlarque then walked Charles
Havel. On the next pitch, first
baseman Ozzie Fernandez hit a
slicing pop into left. Left fielder
Steve Solomon charged,
slid . . . and just barely missed the
ball.
Bases loaded. One out.
With the game on the line, the
Spartans' Greg Mugg then hit a
wimp liner to McCarty. Two gone,
leaving Steve Anderson at the
plate.
Dorlarque reared back. Pitch
No. 1: Called strike. Pitch No. 2:
Swing and a miss by a mile. Pitch
No. 3: Right down the gut. An
derson stood, stared and started
walking home.

Strong pitching is nothing new to
Stanford baseball, which means that the
team's come-from-behind win over San
Jose State yesterday had no unusual
aspects to it. There was power (two
Cardinal home runs), speed (Jeff Ham

winning run) and great pitching, from
John Reid.

Cardinal 4

Hold up. The John Reid who pitched
so poorly in his first two games that
he didn't even get to make the team's
recent trip to Hawaii? That John Reid?
Yup. Reid, who came on in the third
inning of the game, gave up only one
run on two hits in six innings of work
to pick up his first Stanford victory.
And more importantly, he found some
confidence that will help both him and
his team down the road.
"John just hasn't been confident —
he's seemed almost tentative at times,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"Today he went after them a little bet
ter. He needed that, and we needed
that."
"I've been suffering from 'mental
downness,'" Reid said. "I didn't do too
well in my first two games, and I was
in fear that it would happen
again. . . (but) I relaxed today, which I
haven't done before."

Any reason why? "Not getting to go
to Hawaii (last weekend) is a great
stimulant," Reid said.
Marquess agreed. "The greatest
motivator of all is not playing," he said.
"We've got a deep pitching staff. . . It
keeps everyone on their toes and work
ing hard."
Reid took over in the third for lefty
Steve Worrell, who was making his first
1990 appearance on the mound. Worrell,
who has been bothered by a sore shoul
der, only tossed two innings, but didn't
have many problems with the Spartans.
His defense did.
In the top of the first, with men on
first and second via a hit and walk,
designated hitter Pete D'Errico hit a
grounder to second baseman Troy Paul
sen. Paulsen flipped to Roger Burnett
at second — much, much too high. Bur
nett had to leap to catch the ball, and
by the time he fired to first everyone
was safe.
David McCarty then tried to pick off
the Spartan runner at third, which
turned an already ugly play into disaster
for the Cardinal. The throw was in the
dirt, allowing two runs to score. Two
runs, no hits, two errors in one play.
Worrell retired the next five batters
he faced, setting the stage for Reid, who
hadn't pitched well in his first two out
ings. And, when he gave up a solo home
run to Jeff Ball in the third, it looked
like he might be in for another long day
Then something funny happened.
Reid, who had walked eight and struck
out four before yesterday, allowed only
two Spartans to reach base in the next
five innings. By the time he was taken
out in the ninth, Reid had struck out

six, walked none and given up only two
hits, effectively shutting down the Spar
tan attack.
While Reid stifled the Spartans, the
Cardinal offense was slowly creeping
back into the game against San Jose's
Mark Ringkamp. Troy Tallman hit a
solo home run in the third, and Tim
Griffin pounded his fourth homer of
the season — all of them leading off
an inning — in the fifth. Well, maybe
"pounded" isn't quite the right word.
The ball was pretty much popped up
to left, took a long ride on the wind,
and landed just over the fence.
"On a normal day that's an F-7,"
Spartan Coach Sam Piraro said. "Un
fortunately, on this day it wasn't."
Stanford followed up Griffin's hit
with four straight singles to knot the
score, but, with the bases loaded and
no outs, Jeff Hammonds popped up and
Paulsen hit into a double play. Tie game.
Things stayed calm until the bottom
of the eighth, when Hammonds led off
with a single and — surprise — stole
second by a mile. After Paulsen flew
out, McCarty hit a liner just over the
shortstop's glove. Hammonds, who was
dancing off second, paused to make sure
the ball reached the outfield and then
took off. Left fielder Eric Booker picked
up the ball, Hammonds steamed toward
home . . . and Booker threw to second
Hello? "(Booker) felt he didn't have
a play," Piraro said. "I think he made
the right decision. I don't think there's
any way in hell we're going to get Ham
monds on that play."


A! Green — Daily
Second baseman Roger Burnett and the Cardinal bounced back from a 3-0 deficit
to take a 4-3 thriller from San Jose State yesterday.
The Spartans came right back
in the top of the ninth. Reid gave
up an opening single to D'Errico
and was pulled in favor of Aaron
Dorlarque. The next batter hit a
chopper back to the pitcher, mov
ing D'Errico to second.
Dorlarque then walked Charles
Havel. On the next pitch, first
baseman Ozzie Fernandez hit a
slicing pop into left. Left fielder
Steve Solomon charged,
slid . . . and just barely missed the
ball.
Bases loaded. One out.
With the game on the line, the
Spartans' Greg Mugg then hit a
wimp liner to McCarty. Two gone,
leaving Steve Anderson at the
plate.
Dorlarque reared back. Pitch
No. 1: Called strike. Pitch No. 2:
