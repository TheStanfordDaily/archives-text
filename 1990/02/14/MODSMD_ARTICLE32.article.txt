# There's no place like home for fairy tales and the Cardinal
## 
### 
Never is it more apparent there's
no place like home than when
you're on the road.
The women's basketball team learned
that lesson last Wednesday as they slept
on the floor of Colfax High School in
Eastern Washington.
Coach Tara VanDerveer was adamant
the team's travel difficulties played no
role in the Cardinal's first loss of the
season Saturday. So be it. A number of
other factors could easily have conspired
to do in the Cardinal anyway.
Consider that Stanford's opponent —
the Washington Huskies — had it in for
the women in cardinal and white after
suffering a 40-point thrashing in Maples
Pavilion a month ago.
Now add in 7,704 hostile Husky fans

hoopin' and hollarin' in Hec Edmundson
Pavilion. Mix in a dash of general travel
fatigue from two plane fights and a couple
of long bus rides, and you have the perfect
recipe for a Washington win.
As expected, the loss knocked the Car
dinal down one notch in the Associated
Press poll to the No. 3 spot. Not good

news for Stanford, but not fatal either.
The team is still on track to host the
West Regional of the NCAA Tournament
in late March.
At that time, the Cardinal will have
an opportunity to do unto others as
others have done unto them. The visitors
will have to contend with hotel rooms,
delays in SFO, an unfamiliar court and
Maples Mania.
Imagine a few thousand Stanford stu
dents who have just completed finals and
feel like letting loose by screaming their
heads off. You can bet the teams placed
in the West by the selection committee
won't-be too excited to come play in
Maples where the Cardinal can boast of
the second longest home winning streak
in the nation.

Tasting defeat for the first time this
season did not sit well with the
Stanford women. Said VanDerveer:
"The loss at Maples hurt [Washington}.
I hope a loss like this bothers us as
much."
You can bet it did, especially in the
case of Jennifer Azzi. Stanford's star
guard talked about how there have been
"a few games where we came out flat.
It's something we need to work on . . .
coming out stronger.
"They came out ready to go; we came
out sluggish," she added.
Even as the game progressed and the
possibility of defeat loomed larger, Azzi
never gave up hope. "At no time in the
game did I think we were going to lose,"
she said. But they did. For Azzi, who

says "losing is the worst," it gave her an
opportunity to rededicate herself to the
goal the team set for itself in October
— winning the national championship.
Azzi, a player whose immense talent
may be exceeded only by her competi
tiveness, wants to close her storybook
career with a fairy- tale ending. It goes
something like this:
Once upon a time, a girl from Oak
Ridge, Tenn. grows up playing basketball.
She loves the game and can continue
playing it when she heads off to college.
Twenty miles down the road is the Uni
versity of Tennessee — the women's bas
ketball school in the U.S. of A.
She does not really want to play there.
They do not really want her to play there.
