# Women netters tame tenacious tigers
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
It was cold enough to freeze an ocean.
Or at least a university named for one
as the University of the Pacific could
manage just one point off Stanford in
women's tennis yesterday.
Flaying without the services of
Sandra Birch, the nation's top player,
No. 1-ranked Stanford battled the ele
ments and the tenacious Tigers as they
upped their season record to 4-0.

Stanford got off to a fast start as
sophomore Kylie Johnson and senior
captain Lisa Green recorded 6-0, 6-1
victories over Lucy Aronne and Kim
Uyema.
"I played pretty well," Green said af
terward. "She wasn't that consistent."

Green noted that the weather was
unusually unpleasant and was pleased
to get done quickly. "It was really
windy," she said. "It was frustrating."
But for Green, who has been strug
gling some this year, it was a pleasing
showing overall. "I played better than
I have been playing," Green said. When
asked if she felt she was getting her
game back to top form, she said she
was "trying to . . . slowly."
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said
the match was a "good little test before
we go off to Arizona. Their number one
player played well, their number two
player played well."
Brennan was referring to Lisa Mat
sushima and Julie DeArmond of Pacific.
At No. 2 singles, Debbie Graham posted
an impressive 6-2 victory in the first
set. Undaunted, DeArmond took the sec
ond set 6-3. In the clincher, Graham
overpowered DeArmond with her serve
and groundstrokes and won the set 6-1.
At No. 1, Meredith McGrath also
started strong with her serve-and-volley
game and won the opening set 6-3. When

she began to struggle, Matsushima
pounced and captured the next set 6-2.
McGrath, who had a 3:45 p.m. meeting
with a professor to take a midterm,
suddenly realized she had to finish
things up.
Up 4-2 in the third, McGrath broke
Matsushima and gained the opportunity
to serve for the match. Down a break
point, the Stanford freshman drew even
with a powerful approach shot. Another
winner gave McGrath a match point
but she double-faulted to make it deuce
again.
Quickly, McGrath retrieved the balls
and prepared to serve. Brennan tried
to exhort her to slow down. Matsushima
missed wide on the next point to give
McGrath another opportunity to close
out the match.
"Meredith, serve and volley," Green
said from the stands. McGrath took the
advice, won the point and headed off
to her meeting just about on time.

At No. 4 singles Heather Widens slammed the door on UOP's Tisha Lee 6-3, 6-1 as Stanford did the same to the
Tiger squad. Despite the absence of Its No. 1 player the Cardinal had no problem In compiling an effortless 8-1 victory
yesterday.
6-1, 6-1 at No. 3 singles. Heather
Willens, playing at No. 4, bested
Tisha Lee 6-3, 6-1.
With Birch out with the flu and
McGrath taking an exam, the Car
dinal was short half of its top two
doubles tandems. That meant
Johnson and Willens had the mis
fortune of meeting Powell and
Matsushima, the sixth-rated team
in the country. The Pacific pair
triumphed 6-3, 6-3. "That was not
an upset," Brennan said.
Green and Mario Carruth
pasted DeArmond and Lee 6-0,
6-1 at No. 2 doubles. Finally, in
the last match to be concluded,
Valerie Wilson and Carina Rolley
gutted out a tough three setter
with Aronne and Uyema. The
Stanford pair won 6-2, 4-6, 7-6
(7-4).
