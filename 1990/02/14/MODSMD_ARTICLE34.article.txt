## 
### 
Stanford power forward Adam Keefe
reinjured his left ankle at basketball
practice yesterday and will miss today's
practice. The team is leaving for Los
Angeles after practice today for games
with USC tomorrow and No. 23 UCLA
Sunday.
"I'll play," Keefe said of this weekend's
games. "It's just a matter of good
luck/bad luck — get it caught in the
wrong situation and it'll go over again."
Keefe originally suffered the injury,
actually a combination sprained ankle
and sprained foot, two weeks ago. He
reir\ju~ed it last week and felt, "it was
just feeling the way it should," before

he reinjured it yesterday.
Keefe currently leads the Pacific 10
Conference in rebounding, at 9.3 per
game, and field goal shooting percentage,
at .655. He is also fourth in the league
in scoring at 18.8 points per game. With
the ankle bothering him he had only
four and nine points in wins over Wash
ington State and Washington last week
end.
The Cardinal is 14-7 overall, 6-6 in
the Pac-10, going into tomorrow night's
7:30 p.m. game with the Trojans at the
Los Angeles Sports Arena. USC is 8-11,
3-9. Stanford plays UCLA (16-5, 9-3) in
a televised game Sunday afternoon at 3
p.m. in Pauley Pavilion.
