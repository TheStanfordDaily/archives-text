# Figley paces Card golfers as both move into third

### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
The Stanford women's golf team has fo
cused all year on competing with the titans
of the collegiate links: San Jose State, Ar
izona State, and Arizona.
With two rounds complete at the Uni
versity of Arizona Intercollegiate in Tuc
son, the Cardinal is tied for third, in the
midst of the nation's top three teams.
Stanford trails leader ASIT by 10 strokes
and shares possession of third with defend
ing NCAA champion San Jose State. Host
Arizona is just four shots back in seventh
place.
The Cardinal linksters, currently ranked
eighth nationally, entered the second day
of competition tied for seventh place. The
squad tamed the demanding Randolph
Park North course yesterday with an ex
cellent score of 301, the lowest eryoyed by
any of the 18 teams in Tuesday's round.
The team has been plagued this season
by tltoughts that it had not yet realized
its true potential. After yesterday's promis
ing round, such doubts may be fading.
Stanford coach Tim Baldwin described
his team's play as "the best round we've
played in a strong field."
"We've had better scoring days, but none
in such an important event with such tough
competition," he said. The Cardinal was
led by the fine play of junior Jodi Figley,
who complimented Monday's 74 with a
sparkling one-under-par 71 yesterday.
Figley's 145 total tied her for third in
dividually. She is just two shots of the pace
of Lynn Mikulas of Arizona State, who
carded a brilliant round of 69.
Baldwin was not surprised by the success

Figley has enjoyed in Tucson.
"Coming into this tournament, I was
expecting big things from Jodi. She has
not disappointed me or her teammates in
the least," he said.
Sophomore Stephanie Davis rebounded
nicely from an opening round 79 to fire a
steady 74. But for her "putting woes,"
Baldwin was thoroughly satisfied with
Davis' performance.
"Stephanie simply hit the ball well all
afternoon. She suffered some rough mo
ments on the green, but simply played a
fine round of golf," he said. Adele Moore
and Audrey Wooding both suffered disap
pointing second rounds of 77 and 79. The
sophomores, who have each provided solid
play thus far this season, seek to regain
their form in today's final round.
Senior Stephanie Parel continued to have
her difficulties at the Arizona Intercol
legiate. Her 159 total is not indicative of
the play she is capable of.
Stanford not only had to overcome a
challenging course but also faced blustery
conditions in yesterday's second round.
With strong gusts wreaking havoc on
many shots, Baldwin felt his team's play
was all the more impressive.
The squad's sights are firmly set on
catching the leading Sun Devils. Ranked
No 2 nationally and loaded with players
Baldwin described as "scoring machines,"
the Cardinal will need one of its best rounds
of the year if its hopes to take the lead.
Paired with ASU and second place UCLA
in today's final group off the tee, Stanford
will have an opportunity to demonstrate
that it deserves recognition as one of the
nation's best.
