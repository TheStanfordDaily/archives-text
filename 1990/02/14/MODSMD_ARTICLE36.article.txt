# Spikers outshine Hawaii Rainbows
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Playing two consecutive matches against No. 4
Hawaii is quite a task. Factor in 1200 raucous fans
who take volleyball as seriously as Big Easterners
take collegiate hoops, and you have one of the most
daunting feats in men's volleyball.
The 1990 Cardinal, however, has all but dispelled
this golden axiom of college volleyball. After tho
roughly thrashing the Hawaii Rainbows in four
straight matches during the preseason, the Stanford
men's volleyball team returned to Kium Gym Mon
day night to continue where it had left off. Ignoring
mild jeering from the crowds and thwarting a stand
out effort from Hawaii Ail-American Carlos Briceno,
the No. 2 Cardinal dispatched the Rainbows in four
games, 15-9, 2- 15, 16-14, 15-9, raising its season
record to 3-1.

Tuesday: Cardinal 3, Rainbows 2

Capitalizing on less-than-normal defensive atten
tion on Cardinal All-American Dan Hanan, setter
Parker Blackman took the liberty to direct the load
of Stanford's attack in Hanan's direction. The senior
middle blocker, who was set 41 times, converted 24
of those balls into kills, spearheading a first game
offensive charge.
"We came out pretty strong in the first game,"
Hanan said. "They didn't have as many defenders
on me as other teams have had. My hitting was on
and I was blocking pretty well."
Slightly reminiscent of Friday's match against
UC-Santa Barbara, the Cardinal suffered a mild
lapse after a fast start and paid the consequences.
"We got kind of confident," Hanan explained.
"Then we slipped and we came out real flat in the
second game. They had momentum."
Returning to form, the Cardinal streaked out in
front in the third game, applying significant defen
sive pressure. Effectively siding out and forcing
Hawaii out of its rhythm, Stanford outdueled its
unsettled opponents, 16-14.

Last night, Stanford defeated the Rainbows in five.
The Cardinal came back from a two game deficit
to pull off a 12-15, 9-15, 15-10, 15-8, 15-11 victory.
