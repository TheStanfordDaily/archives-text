# Neither wind nor Gauchos can derail netters
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
UC-Santa Barbara and Mother Nature pulled
out all the stops, but the Stanford men's tennis
team was unfazed as it romped over the Gauchos
9-0 yesterday afternoon at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium.
The cold weather and harsh wind may have
bothered the Stanford players, but it certainly did
not affect the Cardinal scorecard. Stanford won
five of the six singles matches in straight sets.
The only scare for the Cardinal came at the
No. 1 position, where freshman Jonathan Stark
met up with David Decret of Paris, France. After
losing the first set, Stark was down a break at

Men's Tennis

Cardinal 9
Gauchos 0

4-2 in the second.
"John was a little sluggish on his serve and a
little sloppy on his volleys [in the early going],"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "But then his
serve got better, and he started playing to the
middle of the court more. fDecret] was hitting
some great shots when John hit the ball out wide,
so hitting down the middle helped him a lot."
Stark regained his composure and eventually
won the match, 2-6, 6-4, 6-1. "I told [Stark] that

tennis is a lot like basketball. In the beginning,
you may be missing a lot of shots but eventually
they start falling in," Gould said.
At the No. 2 spot, sophomore Alex O'Brien
dominated Bensen Curb, 6-2, 6-1. "Nobody likes
playing in the wind," O'Brien said. "I tried to get
into the net more and step into the ball to take
away the effect [of the windl."
"Alex definitely played the best match of the
day," Gould said. "He was quick on the ball and
quick on the attack. One of his opponent's weak
nesses was his serve, and Alex took advantage
and punished the guy with some great returns."
Senior Jeff Cathrall won in straight sets as well,
beating UC-Santa Barbara's No. 3 player, Randy
Flachman, 6-4, 6-4.
Freshman Jared Palmer continued his comeback
from knee surgery yesterday, scoring a 6-2, 6-4
win over G.K. Fleming at the No. 4 spot. But
Palmer was not pleased. "I was missing a lot of
balls. My feet were out of sync. It comes from
being off my feet for three weeks," Palmer said.
Junior Glenn Solomon and freshman Alexis
Hombrecher had no trouble in the No. 5 and No.
6 spots, respectively. Both won their matches by
a final tally of 6-2, 6-2.
"We haven't had the greatest weather lately,"
Solomon said. "In the wind, you really have to
keep your feet moving and set up well because
the ball could change direction at any time."
The Cardinal won all three doubles matches,
but Coach Gould was a little disappointed.
"Some of the doubles combinations we had in
there hadn't played together in a long time, so I
guess I shouldn't have expected that they would
play that well," Gould said.
In No. 1 doubles, Stark and Palmer, who were
ranked as high as No. 2 by the Volvo Collegiate
Tennis Rankings, edged Decret and Curb, 7-6,
6-4. Cathrall and Hombrecher won at the No. 2
spot, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. O'Brien and sophomore Jason
Yee played a loose first set but came back to bagel
the Gaucho team in the second, recording a 7-5,
6-0 win.
"I had a mental crisis in the first set," O'Brien
said. "I lost my concentration, and my mind
started drifting out near Antarctica. I wasn't even
coming in on my serve. We regrouped after the
first set, though, and got things back together."
Despite the cold weather, the match had one
of the better crowd turnouts of the year. "It sure
helps to have all the Stanford guys out there,"
O'Brien said.

guess I shouldn't have expected that they would
play that well," Gould said.
In No. 1 doubles, Stark and Palmer, who were
ranked as high as No. 2 by the Volvo Collegiate
Tennis Rankings, edged Decret and Curb, 7-6,
6-4. Cathrall and Hombrecher won at the No. 2
spot, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. O'Brien and sophomore Jason
Yee played a loose first set but came back to bagel
the Gaucho team in the second, recording a 7-5,
6-0 win.
"I had a mental crisis in the first set," O'Brien
said. "I lost my concentration, and my mind
started drifting out near Antarctica. I wasn't even
coming in on my serve. We regrouped after the
first set, though, and got things back together."
Despite the cold weather, the match had one
of the better crowd turnouts of the year. "It sure
helps to have all the Stanford guys out there,"
O'Brien said.


Freshman Alexis Hombrecher cruised to a 6-2, 6-2 victory yesterday as the Cardinal un
ceremoniously deposed of the Gauchos 9-0.
