Ruggers roll to victory
For the second week in a row,
the Stanford rugby team
decimated their opponent,
blowing out Sacramento State on
Saturday 49-6 to raise their
league record to 5-0.
The outcome of the contest
was decided early on when Stan
ford scored in the opening
minutes and never looked back.
The match was marked by con
tinual scoring — complete till
the closing seconds of the game

— and constant pressure on the
Hornets.
It has been this ability to per
petuate a high level of play, not
only for the 80 minutes of each
individual match but also for the
entire season, that Coach Franck
Boivert sees as his team's
greatest asset.
"We have been developing our
skills and teamwork for many
months now, and we've shown
we can definitely play with any
team in the country," Boivert
said. "But without intensity and
courage these skills are useless."

"I'm very pleased with the
players and the intensity of play
that they have all demonstra
ted."
Much like last week's match,
the Cardinal displayed the abil
ity to score repeatedly — tallying
eight tries by the end of the
contest.
Scoring 21 of Stanford's 49
points was junior Simon
Fleming-Wood, who converted 8-
of-10 kick attempts and scored
a try. In addition, Mark Davies
had two tries while Brian Bell,
Joe Croft, Glenn Flores, John

Hamilton, and Ed Stevens each
added one of their own.
In five weeks of play, the Car
dinal has outscored its oppo
nents 120-25. This week
Stanford rugby travels to U.C.
Davis where it will attempt to
remain undefeated on the
season.
Synchro wins
Despite suffering from an in
complete roster due to two flu
striken swimmers, Stanford's
synchronized swimming team,
currently ranked No. 2 in the
nation, beat California on Sat
urday 96-77 at Berkeley's
Spieker Pool.
Both Mandy Blake and
Melinda Downey were sick with
the flu and were unable to com
pete Saturday, resulting in the
Cardinal's having to rearrange
its scheduled routines.
According to Stanford Coach
Maisel, the victory was just fur
ther testament to the depth and
flexibility that the team pos
sesses. "We had outstanding
swims for early season and im
pressive adaptability," Maisel
said.
Stanford swept the senior fig
ures, a type of compulsory event,
with Karen Madsen taking first,
Ginny Cohn second, and Debbie
Brear third. In addition, Mad
sen, Cohn, and Brear teamed up
to capture the trio routine com
petition.
Michelle Ghert won the solo
event, and Cohn and Brear con
tinued to dominate the meet
with their routine taking first
in the duet competition. Finish
ing second in the same category
were Stanford swimmers Rekha
Rao and Mandy Schivell.
