the Stanford fencing teams on

the Continental airliner which
flew the Cardinal men and women

Men and Women take
first in Pac-10 Invite

Over Friday and Saturday, the
Cardinal went head-to-head with
and solidly crushed seven schools
including UCLA, California, and
Cal State-Fullerton. In the proc
ess, the men's team compiled a
bout record of 119-42 while the
women recorded an impressive
bout record of 72-8.
"We did what we had to do,"
women's Coach Sherry Pos
thumus said. "I'm pleased. Very
pleased."
Their five wins this weekend
completed a perfect season, 11-0,
against West Coast schools for the
Cardinal women. Lana Kang, one
of the Cardinal's outstanding
first-year fencers, went unde
feated this weekend and is
expected to attend the NCAA
Championships. Likewise, not one
member of the women's team lost
more than three bouts this week
end.
"We would have done well re

gardless of our spirit," senior
Vanessa Southern said. "But, on
this trip the team really became
unified. Everyone was always
right there behind you. It made
a big difference."
Prior to the team's departure,
men's Coach Zoran Tulum ad
dressed his men's team which had
been struggling prior to this week
end as they had lost two consecu
tive meets to UC-Santa Cruz.
"Something I didn't see at Penn
State was team unity," Tulum
said. "I want to hear you support
one another. Many fencers are in
timidated when the whole team
gets into the match."
The new strategy proved effec
tive as the Cardinal men never
trailed in any meet.
"We have a very young team
with many inexperienced fencers,"
Tulum said. "The epee team, for
example, just needed a few vic
tories so that they could know
just how good they can be." The
epee team only lost once on the
trip.
On Friday, the men defeated
UC-San Diego 23-4, and Long
Beach 17-7. The women won 16-0
and 13-3, respectively. The men's
toughest competition came
against Cal State-Fullerton. Al
though the men lost both sabre,
5-4, and epee, 6-3, they soundly
won foil by a margin of 8-1 to
win overall.
Sophomore Leonard D'Amico
led the Stanford men with a 21-0
record in sabre. Close behind,
sophomore Nick Bravin ended the
weekend with a cumulative foil
record of 20-1.
"We really came together as a
team on this trip," Bravin said.
"If we had been this together at
