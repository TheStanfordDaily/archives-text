# Liu backs creation of Asian-American studies

### Quan Phung Staff writer 
Citing the present as a "his
torical moment and opportunity
that won't come again," George
town English Prof. David Liu
said that Asian-Americans today
are primed to take a more active
role in creating Asian-American
studies programs.
Liu, one of two candidates for
a tenure-track position in Asian-
American studies here, said that
ethnic studies and minority con
cerns are now "within the
bounds of order" and are ac
cepted by mainstream America.
As a result, Asian-Americans
must not remain "passive ob
jects to ethnicity" like they did
in the late 1970s when he was
a student at UC-Berkeley, Liu
><aid.
Asian-Americans "can't be
satisfied with nominal exis
tence," he said, addressing the
50 students and faculty mem
bers at a noontime presentation
at the Asian American Activities
(Center yesterday.
Many of the students and fac
ulty present also listened last
week to the other finalist for
the Asian-American scholar po
sition, UC-Irvine Historv Prof.

Gordon Chang, as well as former
finalist Cornell Sociology Prof.
Victor Nee. Nee, uncomfortable
with the direction of the es
tablishment of an Asian-
American studies program here,
dropped out of the race last
week.
Sophomore Sophia Shing said
she was glad to hear that "both
Liu and Chang believe in insti
tutionalized ethnic studies. I es
pecially liked the way Liu was
very clear in his ideas of Asian-
American studies," she said.
Liu said that Asian-Americans
should "become writers of his
tory and not be written by it."
Though he commended univer
sities such as Stanford for
making a more concerted effort
to hire minority faculty, Liu
warned about that effort being
a token gesture.
He said students should not
allow the University to hire 30
minority faculty members in
only the sciences. Students must
insist that these positions go to
liberal arts professors as well,
Liu said.
He said that "it is incumbent
on whoever is selected to work
against a situation where this is
just a token position."
If he gets the Asian-American

studies tenure-track position,
Liu said he would try to attract
more Asian-Americans scholars.
"A program with two to three
professors will not provide long
term effects," said Liu. Only
"when you get a critical mass"
can a solid program be devel
oped.
"It doesn't make sense to set
a program unless you have the
commitment and resources to do
it,"he said.
Interest in ethnic studies and
commitment to minority issues

at this time has given Asian-
Americans the opportunity to
"plant people" in various disci
plines such as anthropology,
comparative literature and
sociology. These scholars can ed
ucate students and faculty
within their own disciplines
about the importance of eth
nicity.
At the same time, Liu stressed
the importance of an institu
tional basis. "Anything mean
ingful must have an institutional
identity. We can't have Asian-
American History 1A without
having Asian-American History
18. It would be a kind of an
amputation," he said.
Liu said he believed that
looking at the idea of in
stitutionalizing ethnic studies as
an "either/or" proposition was
"dangerous." Rather, he said he
believes that ethnic studies can
both be incorporated into main
stream departments as well as
exist in its institutionalized
form.
In his presentation, Liu cited
the Japanese Relocation Act as
one example of how dominant
groups in American society ra
tionalize their violent treatment
of Asian-Americans through
rhetoric.
