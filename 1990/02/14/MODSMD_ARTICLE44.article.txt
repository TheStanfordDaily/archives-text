# Public Service Center a model, Gardner says

Stanford's Haas Center for
Public Service stands as a model
for universities nationwide, said
newly-installed public service
Prof. John Gardner, who praised
the center for fostering student
leadership — a quality he said is
in short supply on other college
campuses.
Speaking yesterday at a lun
cheon in his honor, Gardner, a
former secretary of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare under Lyndon
Johnson, founder of the citizens'
lobby Common Cause and a
prolific scholar, observed that
"there are serious shortcomings
in how we deal with young men
and women who might emerge as
leaders."
Universities emphasize individ
ual achievement over group re
sponsibility and classroom
learning over experiential learn
ing, segregating students from
mainstream American life,
Gardner said.
"Young leaders need to learn
very early to deal with many dif
ferent constituencies . . . yet many
of the best universities and grad
uate and professional schools help

young students move away from
the mainstream of life to spend
time with others who share their
sense of superiority," Gardner
said.
"This is not the form of 21st
century leadership," he added.
However, Gardner noted that
Stanford's commitment to public
service "recognizes that every
thing can't be taught in class
rooms."
Gardner's remarks came as part
of a luncheon in the Inner Quad
highlighting the accomplishments
of Stanford's 5-year-old Public
Service Center, renamed the Haas
Center for Public Service last year
after the Bay Area's Haas family
donated $6.2 million to endow the
center.
Of the Haas' family's gift, $1.2
million was designated for a
professorship in public service, to
which Gardner was named. He
works part-time, dividing his time
between the graduate schools of
Business and Education.
University President Donald
Kennedy, speaking at the lun
cheon, said, "There's no
accomplishment at Stanford in
the last 10 years that I take
greater personal pleasure in than
(the center)."
