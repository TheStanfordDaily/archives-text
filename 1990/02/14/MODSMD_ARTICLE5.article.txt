# Dirty water
## Stanford could pay $600,000 for contamination settlement 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
In a settlement expected to
thwart a long and complex legal
battle, Stanford has agreed to pay
as much as $600,000 to dispose
of contaminated groundwater at
the Oregon Expressway-Alma
Street underpass in Palo Alto.
The agreement — made be
tween Hewlett-Packard Co.,
Varian Associates and Santa Clara
County — ends months of intense
negotiations, but none of the par
ties has accepted blame for the
contamination.
Each day for at least the last
three years, as many as 500,000
gallons of tainted water have been
pumped into Matadero Creek
from a county pumping station at
the Oregon Expressway under
pass at Alma Street. The water,
which is not used for drinking,
includes higher-than-accepted
levels of contaminants, which in
clude trichloroethene, perchloro
ethene, dichloroethene and
thrichloroethane.
The Bay Area Regional Water
Quality Control Board informed
Santa Clara County that the
county would be responsible for
repairing the situation. Although
it did not cause the contamina
tion, the county was named re
sponsible because it was discharg
ing the water pumped from the
underpass in order to prevent
flooding.
Last year, Hewlett-Packard and
Varian offered to pay two-thirds
of the total cost to prevent the
discharge to the creek, but Stan
ford refused to pay the other
third. Both companies have facil
ities in the Stanford Research
Park that have had leaks to
groundwater. Their facilities at
640 Page Mill Road and 601 Cal
ifornia Ave., respectively, are the
suspected sources for the Oregon
Expressway contamination, and
their operations are on Stanford
owned land.
The University has taken the
position on this and other con
taminations that because it did

not directly cause the problem, it
should not have to pay.
The county warned Stanford
that inaction would result in a
legal battle, and the University
entered into negotiations with
Hewlett-Packard and Varian to
hammer out an agreement that
was acceptable to the county.
"We indicated that if there was
a suit, it would be complicated,"
said Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs. A law
suit would be "detrimental" to all
parties involved, Horton added,
explaining why the University
decided to settle.
By signing yesterday's agree
ment, Santa Clara County will
only pay staff costs incurred. It
will not pay for the hundreds of
thousands of dollars necessary to
divert the water into the sanitary
sewer.
The county has begun construc
tion of a sewer connection to
redirect the contaminated water
into Palo Alto's sanitary sewer by
March. The county has received
a permit from the city to discharge
the water into the sewer.
Stanford has agreed it will pay
20 percent of the consulting and
capital costs, which will each be
more than $300,000.
Stanford also agreed to pay 20
percent of the $300,000 yearly
costs to maintain the system for
the first five years and 11 percent
after that if the contamination
still lingers. Cleanup of the con
tamination is expected to take
many years, if not decades.
The agreement specifies that
Stanford, in any event, will pay
no more than $600,000.
"I think [the three parties] were
pretty cooperative," said Alice
Sicular, an aide to Santa Clara
County Supervisor Dianne
McKenna. "I think the county is
very fortunate to get Stanford to
agree."
When asked what she thought
about the parties not accepting
responsibility for the contamina
tion despite their agreement to
pay, Sicular said, "That speaks
for itself."
