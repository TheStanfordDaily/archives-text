# King of condoms combats AIDS
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Editorial staff 
To graduate student Daniel
Rao, good things come in small
packages, but the best things
can easily be stretched three
times their normal size.
If you think he has a partic
ular affinity for rubber bands,
you're only half right.
Rao is universally acknowl
edged to be the king of condoms.

the prince of prophylactics and
the lord of latex.
His realm extends campus
wide; his throne is located in
Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe.
The shop, located in the Fire
Truck House, was developed by
the Gay and Alliance
at Stanford as a result of its
AIDS Education Project.
In the fall of 1985, GLAS
members put together a show
case of condoms to emphasize

their importance in slowing the
spread of sexually-transmitted
diseases.
When they realized that many
of the different brands were un
known on campus, the members
sought a way to make them
more available As the treasurer
of GLAS, Bao took responsibility
for the creation and main
tainence of the sliop.

Graduate student Daniel Bao, Stanford's "King of condoms,'' works to promote awareness about
condoms through Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe and prophylactic presentation parties.
To further inform the commu
nity about condom usage and va
riety, GLAS organizes periodic
"rubberware parties." At these
events. Bao presents his audience
with an awesome array of con
doms, showcasing their various
strengths and weaknesses. Bao
keeps many of the shop's condoms
and lubricants in a two-tone
tackle box, which has won the
attention of many.
"It's pretty dramatic, so it
works pretty well," Bao says.
"People do recognize it on
campus. They always say, 'There
goes Daniel and his condom
box.' "
One highlight of the evening
comes when he inflates a prop
hylactic to unprecedented propor
tions and places it over his head.
"Sometimes I had a problem
when my hair was really short,"
Bao says."It would puncture the
condom."
Bao has never worn a sper
micidal condom as a hat, but since
most spermicides are detergent
based, it would be similar to a
shampoo, he points out.
The shop usually carries an as
sortment of 25 brands of prop
hylactics and four types of
lubricants.
But now Bao's home away from
home is filled with 25,000 con
doms.
Before he graduates with a
master's in Latin American
studies, Bao will put on an event
guaranteed to bring new meaning
to "the old college try."
Starting today, students will be
able to participate in the Fourth
Annual Condom Rating Contest.
Seven condom manufacturers
have donated nearly 90,000 sam
ples for the competition, which
will be held in conjunction with
five other Bay Area schools.
Students can pick up packets of
prophylactics in White Plaza. Shy
students should get their packets

tomorrow or Friday to avoid being
part of the media coverage of the
event, Bao says.
As in the previous three years
of the contest's existence, students
will rate the condoms in such
categories as taste, smell, appear
ance and lubrication.
It is important that students
then fill out the ballots that ac
company their condoms by Feb.
28.
"If people don't turn in ballots,
the manufacturers aren't going to
know what people like and don't
like," Bao says.
Faculty and staff also take ad
vantage of the condom giveaway,
according to Bao. But out of re
spect for their privacy, he refuses
to reveal which University em
ployees ask for condoms.
"You want a scoop?" he laughs.
"One day, I'll write it all down!"
The Condom Contest seeks to
show that "unlike men, not all
condoms are created equal," Bao
explains.
A quick tour of the shop proves
Bao correct. A shelf covered with
blown-up birth control devices at
tests to the various sizes and
styles available.
Skinless Skin Crown was last
year's contest champion. But the
prospects for a repeat look slim,
with six strong contenders in the
field.
First, there's the Flancy, "the
leading-edge condom"— and Bao's
personal favorite. These pink
prophylactics are decorated with
a rose pattern.
"It's so subtle!" Bao raves. "It's
not a ribbing, because you don't
feel it; it's just printed."
Then there's the Mentor System
condom, which contains adhesive
strips to prevent slippage. Like its
namesake, the condom sticks to
you like glue and prevents mis
takes from happening.
But some feel that the Mentor
brand has led them astray, Bao
says.
"A few people do complain that
they are hard to get off, but I
think the problem is that instead

of rolling them off, they are trying
to pull them off."
He reaches for one of the many
fake bananas that adorn the shop
to demonstrate the proper unroll
ing technique.
After struggling with the Men
tor for a while, he gives up.
"It sticks more to plastic than
it would to human skin," he notes,
yanking it off the phony fruit.
The snap of the prophylactic as
it comes off the model is enough
to make a grown man wince. "If
you did that, that might hurt,"
Bao says."I swear that it doesn't
stick as much to human skin."
Some manufacturers are con
sidering making innovative con
doms that glow in the dark or
taste like particular foods.
Others are calling for the crea
tion of a Stanford condom, a pos
sibility which is highly likely,
according to Bao.
Bao jokingly foresees the day
when "they'll do a Marilyn
Monroe condom or something.
[Or one wherel you can put your
own face on it too!"
Bao advises students to become
educated condom consumers by
reading books on the subject and
practicing with different types.
"If you think about it, people
expect to use condoms like they
expect to drive," Bao says. "They
expect to be able to get in the
car, without having ever taken
driver's training or anything."
Condoms also make great gifts,
says Bao.
One winter, Bao was a not-so-
Secret Santa, giving a succession
of condoms to a Catholic
dormmate.
Bao says his parents have am
bivalent feelings about their son's
activism in this arena.
"They think it's a good cause,
but they wish somebody else's
child would do it,"he explains.
But they are growing more ac
customed to it."In fact, I had my
mother ask me for condoms," Bao
says.
One has to wonder what Sig
mund Freud would have thought.

"It's so subtle!" Bao raves. "It's
not a ribbing, because you don't
feel it; it's just printed."
Then there's the Mentor System
condom, which contains adhesive
strips to prevent slippage. Like its
namesake, the condom sticks to
you like glue and prevents mis
takes from happening.
But some feel that the Mentor
brand has led them astray, Bao
says.
"A few people do complain that
they are hard to get off, but I
think the problem is that instead

of rolling them off, they are trying
to pull them off."
He reaches for one of the many
fake bananas that adorn the shop
to demonstrate the proper unroll
ing technique.
After struggling with the Men
tor for a while, he gives up.
"It sticks more to plastic than
it would to human skin," he notes,
yanking it off the phony fruit.
The snap of the prophylactic as
it comes off the model is enough
to make a grown man wince. "If
you did that, that might hurt,"
Bao says."I swear that it doesn't
stick as much to human skin."
Some manufacturers are con
sidering making innovative con
doms that glow in the dark or
taste like particular foods.
Others are calling for the crea
tion of a Stanford condom, a pos
sibility which is highly likely,
according to Bao.
Bao jokingly foresees the day
when "they'll do a Marilyn
Monroe condom or something.
[Or one wherel you can put your
own face on it too!"
Bao advises students to become
educated condom consumers by
reading books on the subject and
practicing with different types.
"If you think about it, people
expect to use condoms like they
expect to drive," Bao says. "They
expect to be able to get in the
car, without having ever taken
driver's training or anything."
Condoms also make great gifts,
says Bao.
One winter, Bao was a not-so-
Secret Santa, giving a succession
of condoms to a Catholic
dormmate.
Bao says his parents have am
bivalent feelings about their son's
activism in this arena.
"They think it's a good cause,
but they wish somebody else's
child would do it,"he explains.
But they are growing more ac
customed to it."In fact, I had my
mother ask me for condoms," Bao
says.
One has to wonder what Sig
mund Freud would have thought.
To graduate student Daniel
Rao, good things come in small
packages, but the best things
can easily be stretched three
times their normal size.
If you think he has a partic
ular affinity for rubber bands,
you're only half right.
Rao is universally acknowl
edged to be the king of condoms.

the prince of prophylactics and
the lord of latex.
His realm extends campus
wide; his throne is located in
Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe.
The shop, located in the Fire
Truck House, was developed by
the Gay and Alliance
at Stanford as a result of its
AIDS Education Project.
In the fall of 1985, GLAS
members put together a show
case of condoms to emphasize

their importance in slowing the
spread of sexually-transmitted
diseases.
When they realized that many
of the different brands were un
known on campus, the members
sought a way to make them
more available As the treasurer
of GLAS, Bao took responsibility
for the creation and main
tainence of the sliop.

Graduate student Daniel Bao, Stanford's "King of condoms,'' works to promote awareness about
condoms through Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe and prophylactic presentation parties.
To further inform the commu
nity about condom usage and va
riety, GLAS organizes periodic
"rubberware parties." At these
events. Bao presents his audience
with an awesome array of con
doms, showcasing their various
strengths and weaknesses. Bao
keeps many of the shop's condoms
and lubricants in a two-tone
tackle box, which has won the
attention of many.
"It's pretty dramatic, so it
works pretty well," Bao says.
"People do recognize it on
campus. They always say, 'There
goes Daniel and his condom
box.' "
One highlight of the evening
comes when he inflates a prop
hylactic to unprecedented propor
tions and places it over his head.
"Sometimes I had a problem
when my hair was really short,"
Bao says."It would puncture the
condom."
Bao has never worn a sper
micidal condom as a hat, but since
most spermicides are detergent
based, it would be similar to a
shampoo, he points out.
The shop usually carries an as
sortment of 25 brands of prop
hylactics and four types of
lubricants.
But now Bao's home away from
home is filled with 25,000 con
doms.
Before he graduates with a
master's in Latin American
studies, Bao will put on an event
guaranteed to bring new meaning
to "the old college try."
Starting today, students will be
able to participate in the Fourth
Annual Condom Rating Contest.
Seven condom manufacturers
have donated nearly 90,000 sam
ples for the competition, which
will be held in conjunction with
five other Bay Area schools.
Students can pick up packets of
prophylactics in White Plaza. Shy
students should get their packets

tomorrow or Friday to avoid being
part of the media coverage of the
event, Bao says.
As in the previous three years
of the contest's existence, students
will rate the condoms in such
categories as taste, smell, appear
ance and lubrication.
It is important that students
then fill out the ballots that ac
company their condoms by Feb.
28.
"If people don't turn in ballots,
the manufacturers aren't going to
know what people like and don't
like," Bao says.
Faculty and staff also take ad
vantage of the condom giveaway,
according to Bao. But out of re
spect for their privacy, he refuses
to reveal which University em
ployees ask for condoms.
"You want a scoop?" he laughs.
"One day, I'll write it all down!"
The Condom Contest seeks to
show that "unlike men, not all
condoms are created equal," Bao
explains.
A quick tour of the shop proves
Bao correct. A shelf covered with
blown-up birth control devices at
tests to the various sizes and
styles available.
Skinless Skin Crown was last
year's contest champion. But the
prospects for a repeat look slim,
with six strong contenders in the
field.
First, there's the Flancy, "the
leading-edge condom"— and Bao's
personal favorite. These pink
prophylactics are decorated with
a rose pattern.

not a ribbing, because you don't
feel it; it's just printed."
