Phi Delts resubmit
new social guidelines
Following yesterday's negoti
ations with University officials,
Phi Delta Theta fraternity of
ficers are revising their social
guideline proposals and will
resubmit them to the Univer
sity tomorrow.
The 10-page proposal, drawn
up by Phi Delt officers, is ex
pected to include stricter guide
lines for house parties and
spring Rush.
The Phi Delts' original pro
posals were presented yester
day by fraternity president,
Chris Helling, in a meeting
with University officials. The
meeting, organized to negotiate
the Phi Delts' new social guide
lines, was attended by fraternal
affairs adviser Michael Hughes,
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Jackson and director
of the Row, Diana Conklin.

The 40-minute meeting "was
a very positive one," according
to Helling.
"We concretely outlined our
proposal," Helling said, "but at
this point it is still incomplete
and in need of some modifica
tions."
The Phi Delts, anxious to
bring the investigation to a
close, expect to complete the
revisions by this evening and
resubmit the proposals.
