Cartel surrenders labs
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — On the eve of
a U.S.-Latin American drug summit, the pow
erful Medellin cocaine cartel surrendered its
three largest cocaine-processing laboratories
to authorities.
The White House denounced the kidnapping
this week of two Americans by suspected leftist
guerrillas. The captors said they wanted to
protest President Bush's visit for the drug
summit today.
There were reports that one of the Ameri
cans had been released, but the White House
said today it believed both were still being held.
Kennedy downplays role
WASHINGTON (AP) —- Anthony Kennedy,
who has solidified a conservative Supreme
Court majority since becoming a justice two
years ago Sunday, says he feels no special
pressure when thrust to center stage.
"People ask me, 'How do you feel being the
ninth vote?' I say, 'Well, I' m one of nine.'
Everybody's vote makes a difference," Kennedy
said in a rare interview.
As the junior member, he is the last to give
his views and to cast his vote on each case
during the court's secret conferences. "If it's
5-4, my say is very important," Kennedy said.
"I'm guaranteed an audience."
Plant attack uncovered
ATLANTA (AP) — Seven people plotted to
bomb a nuclear plant and other targets and
then falsely implicate a Latin American "dupe"
in a scheme to win a drug kingpin's release
from prison, prosecutors charged Wednesday
The seven, all residents of Tennessee or Ken
tucky, are in custody, U.S. Attorney Ray
Rukstele said after the indictment, returned
by a grand jury Tuesday in a four-year inves
tigation, was unsealed yesterday.
Flag law reviewed
SEATTLE (AP) — Attorneys for four people
accused of burning a U.S. flag asked a federal
judge today to strike down the flag desecration
law, saying the government can persuade but
must not compel people to be patriotic.
"The flag serves its purpose for Congress
because people are free to wave it," said defense
attorney David Cole. "If you want people to
be free to wave it you also have to let people
be free to burn it.
The hearing today before U.S. District Judge
Barbara Rothstein was the first constitutional
challenge of the FJag Protection Act of 1989,
Cole said. Rothstein said she would issue a
ruling in several days.
Autopilot was off
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The prose
cution's star witness in the Joseph Hazelwood
trial said today the tanker Exxon Valdez's
autopilot was turned off long before a crucial
maneuver and had nothing to do with the
ship's grounding.
Third mate Gregory Cousins also said he is
convinced that had the helmsman on the ship
followed his orders, the tanker would have
missed a rocky reef by several miles.
The testimony came during cross
examination by Hazelwood's lawyer, who
sought to show that all the procedures aboard
the tanker were moving smoothly until the
helmsman failed to execute a 10-degree right
turn.
Rushdie threat reissued
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Iranian radical
leaders said yesterday that no matter how
closely he is guarded, British author Salman
Rushdie will be killed in accordance with
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's edict issued one
year ago.
