# ANC insists on full black voting rights

SOWETO, South Africa (AP) — The
African National Congress insists on
full black voting rights, but it is open
to compromise on other constitutional
issues and to considering guarantees
for whites, Nelson Mandela said yes
terday.
Mandela, who plans to consult soon
with ANC leaders in Zambia, did not
elaborate on what compromises might
be reached.
"I think it be most presumptuous
of me to speak for the ANC," he said.
"It is the ANC who would decide what
compromises it should make. ... We
are ready for honorable compromises
without surrendering our principles."
During a conversation with a small
group of reporters, Mandela was asked
whether the ANC was willing to ne
gotiate about its demand for a one
person, one-vote system, which would
lead to black majority rule.
"That is the nature of compromising
— you compromise on fundamental
issues," he said, but did not give the
impression the ANC was prepared to
alter its position on voting.
The 71-year-old black leader praised
President F.W. de Klerk, who legalized
the ANC two weeks ago and released
him from prison Sunday after 27
years. Because of de Klerk's flexibility
and integrity, he said, "the possibility
of a settlement is always there."
"Compromises must be made in re
spect to every issue, as long as that
compromise is in the interest not only
of one population group, but the coun
try as whole," Mandela told reporters
at his four-room home, where he slept
Tuesday night for the first time since
his imprisonment in 1962.
Mandela has said since his release
that the African National Congress
wants to ease the fears of South
Africa's 5 million whites about domi
nation by the 28 million blacks.
He has expressed opposition, how
ever, to the government concept of
"group rights," which would give spe
cial legal protection to whites and
other minorities.
"We are aware of the fears of the
whites in the country of being
dominated by blacks, and we are ad
dressing that very seriously and very
earnestly," he said yesterday.
"I am convinced that, in discussions

between the ANC and the government,
we will be able to find a solution which
will be accepted by everybody, black
and white."
De Klerk's National Party is com
mitted to negotiating a new constitu
tion within five years extending polit
ical rights to blacks. Gerrit Viljoen,
the constitutional development minis
ter, conceded Tuesday the resulting
government "is unlikely to have the
National Party in control,"
In Lusaka, Zambia, the ANC lead
ership began a two-day meeting ex
pected to focus on Mandela's future
role and a response to de Klerk's in
itiatives.
ANC officials have acknowledged
they were caught off guard Feb. 2
when de Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on
the guerrilla movement and made
other major concessions in a bid to
get negotiations started.
In recent months, Mandela had met
frequently with senior government of
ficials, including de Klerk, to discuss
prospects for negotiations between
them and the ANC.
"My optimism has been strength
ened" in those discussions, he said yes
terday.
Mandela reaffirmed support for the
ANC's guerrilla campaign, which he
helped launch in the early 1960s before
receiving a life prison sentence, and
would not apologize for deaths of
civilians.
"You can't avoid people getting
caught up in the cross fire when two
people are shooting at each other," he
said. "People must not only worry
about casualties" caused by the ANC.
"They must worry about the series of
casualties caused by the government
over the decades."
Police said yesterday a new outbreak
of fighting between rival black factions
had taken at least 13 lives.
They said officers using tear gas,
rubber bullets and shotguns were
trying to quell unrest at Kwanobuhle
near Uitenhage, where nine of the vic
tims were killed.
Four deaths were reported in Natal
Province, where black supporters and
opponents of the ANC have feuded for
three years. The government said sol
diers would be deployed to halt the
fighting.

try as whole," Mandela told reporters
at his four-room home, where he slept
Tuesday night for the first time since
his imprisonment in 1962.
Mandela has said since his release
that the African National Congress
wants to ease the fears of South
Africa's 5 million whites about domi
nation by the 28 million blacks.
He has expressed opposition, how
ever, to the government concept of
"group rights," which would give spe
cial legal protection to whites and
other minorities.
"We are aware of the fears of the
whites in the country of being
dominated by blacks, and we are ad
dressing that very seriously and very
earnestly," he said yesterday.
"I am convinced that, in discussions

between the ANC and the government,
we will be able to find a solution which
will be accepted by everybody, black
and white."
De Klerk's National Party is com
mitted to negotiating a new constitu
tion within five years extending polit
ical rights to blacks. Gerrit Viljoen,
the constitutional development minis
ter, conceded Tuesday the resulting
government "is unlikely to have the
National Party in control,"
In Lusaka, Zambia, the ANC lead
ership began a two-day meeting ex
pected to focus on Mandela's future
role and a response to de Klerk's in
itiatives.
ANC officials have acknowledged
they were caught off guard Feb. 2
when de Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on
the guerrilla movement and made
other major concessions in a bid to
get negotiations started.
In recent months, Mandela had met
frequently with senior government of
ficials, including de Klerk, to discuss
prospects for negotiations between
them and the ANC.
"My optimism has been strength
ened" in those discussions, he said yes
terday.
Mandela reaffirmed support for the
ANC's guerrilla campaign, which he
helped launch in the early 1960s before
receiving a life prison sentence, and
would not apologize for deaths of
civilians.
"You can't avoid people getting
caught up in the cross fire when two
people are shooting at each other," he
said. "People must not only worry
about casualties" caused by the ANC.
"They must worry about the series of
casualties caused by the government
over the decades."
Police said yesterday a new outbreak
of fighting between rival black factions
had taken at least 13 lives.
They said officers using tear gas,
rubber bullets and shotguns were
trying to quell unrest at Kwanobuhle
near Uitenhage, where nine of the vic
tims were killed.
Four deaths were reported in Natal
Province, where black supporters and
opponents of the ANC have feuded for
three years. The government said sol
diers would be deployed to halt the
fighting.
