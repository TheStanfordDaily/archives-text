Bush hails change
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush, hailing "historic change" in
superpower relations, said yesterday
that Soviet acceptance of his troop
cut proposal removed a obsta
cle to a conventional arms treaty for
Europe.
Bush said he was caught by
surprise at how quickly the troop
agreement and a separate pact to
speed German unification had fallen
into place.
"We're dealing with historic
change," Bush told reporters. He
added with a laugh, "I mean to be
very elated about this."
The latest developments came
Tuesday in Ottawa in talks between
Secretary of State James A. Baker
111, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and other European
foreign ministers.
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorba
chev, who last week called for parity
with U.S. forces, agreed to a pullout
that will leave both sides with
195,000 troops in Central Europe, but
an additional U.S. troops in

Britain, Italy, Spain, Greece and
Turkey.
"This is an important break
through which removes a major ob
stacle to the early conclusion of a
CFE (Conventional Forces in Europe)
treaty, and it also established the
principle that U.S. forces in Europe
are not to be treated as equivalent
to Soviet forces in Eastern Europe,"
said Bush.
Sleeping in a hangar
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush planned to sleep aboard Air
Force One in an airport hangar in
the Maryland suburbs last night so
he can snooze through an early
morning takeoff and arrive refreshed
for drug summit talks in Colombia
today.
White House press secretary Mar
lin Fitzwater said Bush's unusual
sleeping arrangements had nothing
to do with elaborate security precau
tions surrounding his one-day sum
mit today with the presidents of
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
"It's a sleep thing, not a security

thing," Fitzwater said. "He feels it's
the best way for him to get the most
sleep without having to wake up in
the middle of the night."
'Macho man' Bush
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Bush clearly relishes his metamor
phosis from wimp to what he calls
"macho man," even though he insists
his trip tomorrow to violence-torn
Colombia should not be seen as an
act of bravado.
"I'm not going to do something
stupid or macho," Bush reassured a
recent audience.
Although White House officials
claim the president has no surprises
up his sleeve for the drug summit,
even these assurances are being
greeted with some skepticism. Bush
in the past has proven adept at
springing forth with surprise propos
als and agendas.
His decision to ignore the concerns
expressed by top aides and to attend
the four-nation conference in Car
tagena, Colombia, is just the latest
in a series of bold strokes taken bv

a president who at times has been
criticized by Democrats as being
overly cautious.
Bush says his decision to go to
Cartagena, amid what may be the
tightest military and Secret Service
security ever assembled for a U.S.
president, is an important symbolic
gesture of solidarity with host pres
ident Virgilio Barco in his fight
against the Colombian drug cartels.
Coca growers shunned
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush will refuse to meet with
Peruvian coca growers at the Colom
bian drug summit and will travel to
Cartagena with a sharply reduced
staff because of concerns for his
safety, White House officials said yes
terday.
On the eve of the one-day meeting
of four hemispheric nations, the
White House also retreated from pre
vious suggestions that Bush would
revive a proposal to send U.S. Navy
warships into South American waters
to track cocaine-trafficking planes.
