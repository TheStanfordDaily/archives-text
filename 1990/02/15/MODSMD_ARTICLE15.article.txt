Complications part
of growth process
toward ethnic studies

Although the search
is ending, a new era is just
beginning.
The search for Stanford's first
Asian-American studies scholar is
nearing its completion, and soon
the search committee will achieve
its worthwhile goal ot hiring a
tenure-track professor to teach, re
search, and develop Asian-
American studies.
Two highly qualified, viable can
didates have completed a unique
search process that involved stu
dents, staff, and faculty in commu
nity presentations, departmental
lectures, interviews and discus
sions.
The search took place in the con
text of a 20-year legacy of faculty,
administrators, staff and especially
students working to institution
alize Asian-American studies at
Stanford. The Asian American Stu
dents Association deserves special
mention as a vital force in the ef
forts toward developing an Asian-
American studies program. And
both past and present members of
the Stanford community deserve
commendation for their dedicated
work.

Yet while the search process has
gone well, it has not been without
its difficulties. These past two
weeks have had their share of
debate and tension. Competing
views on the future of ethnic
studies at Stanford have been of
fered, as well as conflicting
opinions on the characteristics and
qualifications of the candidates.
The search has at times been a
trying process for all those in
volved. However, these complica
tions and complexities are part of
a growth process for the entire
Stanford community in establish
ing ethnic studies.
Now is the time to focus energy
on the issue at hand: choosing the
best Asian-American studies
scholar based on the results of the
search process and determined by
the relevant criteria of teaching
ability, scholarship, research, and
committment to building Asian-
American studies at Stanford. For
this task, the search committee
needs the continuing support and
input of the Stanford community.
The hiring of Stanford's first
Asian-American Studies scholar is
a significant achievement, but it is
only one step toward making the
concept of a multicultural educa
tion a concrete reality. It is a step
in the process of building an edu
cation that reflects the importance
of diverse peoples, histories, and
cultures. And it is one step in the
beginning of a new and exciting
era at Stanford.
