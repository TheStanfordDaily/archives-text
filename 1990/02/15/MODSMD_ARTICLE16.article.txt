University must make commitment to combat rape

WE, THE members of SWOPSI
173: Issues in Self-Defense for
Women, demand that the
University aid in reducing the in
cidence of sexual assault on campus.
Sexual assaults, especially acquaint
ance rape, pose a major threat to
Stanford students. According to the
Rape Education Project's survey last
spring:
•37 percent of female graduate stu
dents, 29 percent of female undergrad
uate students, 16 percent of male
graduate students, and 10 percent of
male undergraduate students indicated
that they had been coerced or forced
into sexual activity against their will.
Approximately 98 percent of the vic
tims knew their assailant.
• Despite this high prevalence, fewer

than one in 10 survivors told anyone
about the incident. Less than 2 percent
reported the crime to legal authorities.
Only two rapes have been reported
through the University in the past
seven years.
• In an effort to educate and empower
themselves, over 100 female students
went to the first meeting of the
SWOPSI self-defense class this winter
quarter, but only 36 spots were avail
able.
Despite the high frequency of rape
on this campus, there is little talk of it
and few survivors reporting. Further
more, there is a high unmet demand
for education and resources. Currently,
all rape resources on this campus are
organized and run entirely by students.
Much of the discrepancy between the

high prevalence and the lack of knowl
edge is due to the myths surrounding
this issue. In fact, many people in the
Stanford community deny both the
crime's occurrence and the risk.
How can all students receive an
equal Stanford education when so
many feel vulnerable and threatened
by rape? As indicated by the statistics
above, this campus is not safe. This
environment produces feelings of vul
nerability that interfere with students'
work.
We demand that the University:
• Adopt and publicize a written policy
defining and condemning rape in a
letter, written and signed by University
President Donald Kennedy, to the
entire Stanford community. This letter
should include steps students can

follow if raped, rights and resources
available to survivors, and conse
quences for student assailants.
• Require that education and informa
tion about sexual assaults is provided,
especially for incoming students. This
education must include funded, avail
able SWOPSI self-defense classes.
• Create a safer environment by in
creasing outdoor lighting and dor
mitory security.
No one will leave Stanford unaf
fected by this crime.
I hese demands have been institu
tionalized on many college campuses
across the nation. It's time for Stan
ford to achieve this level of security
and equality.
