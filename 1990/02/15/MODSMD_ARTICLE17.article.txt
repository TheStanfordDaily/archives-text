# Senate's proposal does not accurately represent students
## 
### 
We applaud the ASSU's campus-wide
poll on the proposed change in Stan
ford's alcohol policy. It showed a con
cern for student opinion and was an
innovative step in campus politics.
Yet in the ASSU Senate meeting of
Feb. 13, the Student Affairs committee
submitted for approval a letter to Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons detail
ing the ASSU's recommendation on
these changes.
The header of the resolution stated,
"The authors of this bill ... prepared
the senate response only after exten
sive sonsultation with the student com
munity, [the Council of Presidents],
and the Alcohol Policy Task Force."
However, regarding the second pro
posal (the ban on advertising of aJcohol

at athletic events), the letter read:
"The senate concurs with the Alcohol
Policy Task Force in supporting this
proposal. We recognize, however, that a
vast majority of students oppose this
recommendation. We believe that the
matter is best left to the discretion of
the Althetic Department,"
The letter was approved by the sen
ate by undivided voice vote (that is to
say, unanimously).
The ASSU is elected as a representa
tive body and, as such, has a responsi
bility to recognize the opinions of the
students. To casually dismiss a
mtyority of 58 percent to 24 percent
against the proposal — while claiming
to have listened to the campus' views
— shows a disregard for their respon
siblity as delegates. We recognize the
ASSU's right to express its opinion,
but not under the guise of popular
mtyority.
