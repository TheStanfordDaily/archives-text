# Efforts of students in South Bay relief deserve recognition
## 
### 
It is probably not widely known on
Stanford's campus that a group of
dedicated volunteers provided 3,000
meals last quarter to the South Bay's
hungry and homeless This group col
lectively hauled nearly 4,000 pounds of
food from their dormitory or house
kitchens to a central storage freezer
located at the Bridge. Were it not for
these volunteers' efforts, those 3,000
meals would have ended up in the
garbage.
I write, therefore, to publicly express
my thanks to those many volunteers
who work under the acronym SPOON.
Every week these Stanford students
commit the time and energy necessary
for the Stanford Project on Nutrition's
extensive operations.

Their efforts provide a sometimes
ignored portion of the South Bay's
population the opportunity to eat
nutritious food. For that, they are
greatly admired among the various
service agencies in Stanford's surround
ing communities. Once again, a sincere
thank you to all who work with
SPOON.
