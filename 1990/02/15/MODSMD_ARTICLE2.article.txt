# Overhead expenses remain high
## Researchers disturbed despite promises to limit rate 
### Elizabeth Weiss 
The good news in the attempt to rem
edy the University's financial ailments
is its pledge to hold the indirect cost of
research at a 78 percent rate for 1991
and beyond. The bad news is that this
new rate will be the highest in the
country.
Researchers aware of the damage to
University programs done by high over
head expenses fear the action may do
little to improve an already precarious
situation.
In order to reduce a budget deficit
that is climbing every year, Provost
James Rosse told the Faculty Senate
last week that Stanford will cut its op
erating budget by $22 million over the
next 18 months.
An important goal of the massive
plan, Rosse said, is "to give our faculty

who conduct sponsored research the
best opportunity to compete for shrink
ing federal research dollars."
The University normally derives
about one-third of its budget from tui
tion and another third from indirect
cost recovery, which is money added to
research grants to cover such overhead
costs as building maintenance and
utilities.
When researchers calculate their over
head costs next year, they will first add
28 percent for staff and faculty benefits
to the actual research costs. Then an
other 78 percent of the combined
amount will be added to determine the
total cost of the project.
The total cost of research, therefore,
will be well more than twice the cost
of doing the actual research — and the
highest in the nation.
Both faculty and administrators ac

knowledge the potential dangers asso
ciated with maintaining such a high
indirect cost rate.
Researchers claim the high rate is a
distinct disadvantage in obtaining suf
ficient government funding for their
programs.
While it is difficult to produce statisti
cal evidence proving that a high indirect
cost rate hurts Stanford scientists hun
ting for grants, many researchers are
convinced that the amount of money
awarded them is affected by the Uni
versity's high rate. Approximately 90
percent of basic research funding comes
from government sources.
Asst. Chemistry Prof. Lisa McElwee-
White said that during a discussion with
a National Science Foundation grant
proposal officer, she was told, "It's too
bad your overhead rate is so high.
This is the amount that assistant
professors get."
Consequently, researchers need
to obtain more grants to do the
same amount of work. In addition,
competition for grants is severe.
Rosse's plan to "streamline"
University operations is partly an
attempt to keep the indirect cost
rate competitive. A dramatic in
crease in research volume would
also be helpful, since this would
increase University income.
But Dean of Research Robert
Byer says this prospect is unlikely.
"We have no levers to increase
research volume except to provide
the faculty with the proper envi
ronment for research," he said.
Identifying where specific
budget cuts will be made is left
to yet-to-be-appointed task forces
over the next few months.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Anthony Siegman said choosing
specific areas for cuts will be
difficult. More importantly, he
added, "researchers have to be
concerned that the University will
cut the overhead rate by reducing
services, and we will have to
replace those services with direct
charges against our contracts."
The indirect cost rate issue has
also focused attention on human
ities departments. Some research
ers say humanities faculty have,
in the past, had few indirect cost
rate problems. Byer explained
that 5 percent of the faculty, based
primarily in non-humanities de
partments, brings in 50 percent
of campus research volume.
Siegman said there are indirect
costs associated with humanities
departments "which are paid by
the University in a way that is
hidden," as part of the general
University budget for overhead.
To clarify matters, Siegman ad
vocates "full cost accounting." He
said, "If the University budgeted
every department at full costs,
everybody would understand the
reality of indirect costs, and there
would be much more motivation
to keep indirect costs down."
Forecasts for the future of in
direct cost rates are cautiously op
timistic. Chemistry Prof. James
Collman predicts "some decrease
eventually, but I don't know how
much, and I believe it will take a
long time."

to the actual research costs. Then an
other 78 percent of the combined
amount will be added to determine the
total cost of the project.
The total cost of research, therefore,
will be well more than twice the cost
of doing the actual research — and the
highest in the nation.
Both faculty and administrators ac

knowledge the potential dangers asso
ciated with maintaining such a high
indirect cost rate.
Researchers claim the high rate is a
distinct disadvantage in obtaining suf
ficient government funding for their
programs.
While it is difficult to produce statisti
cal evidence proving that a high indirect
cost rate hurts Stanford scientists hun
ting for grants, many researchers are
convinced that the amount of money
awarded them is affected by the Uni
versity's high rate. Approximately 90
percent of basic research funding comes
from government sources.
Asst. Chemistry Prof. Lisa McElwee-
White said that during a discussion with
a National Science Foundation grant
proposal officer, she was told, "It's too
bad your overhead rate is so high.
This is the amount that assistant
professors get."
Consequently, researchers need
to obtain more grants to do the
same amount of work. In addition,
competition for grants is severe.
Rosse's plan to "streamline"
University operations is partly an
attempt to keep the indirect cost
rate competitive. A dramatic in
crease in research volume would
also be helpful, since this would
increase University income.
But Dean of Research Robert
Byer says this prospect is unlikely.
"We have no levers to increase
research volume except to provide
the faculty with the proper envi
ronment for research," he said.
Identifying where specific
budget cuts will be made is left
to yet-to-be-appointed task forces
over the next few months.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Anthony Siegman said choosing
specific areas for cuts will be
difficult. More importantly, he
added, "researchers have to be
concerned that the University will
cut the overhead rate by reducing
services, and we will have to
replace those services with direct
charges against our contracts."
The indirect cost rate issue has
also focused attention on human
ities departments. Some research
ers say humanities faculty have,
in the past, had few indirect cost
rate problems. Byer explained
that 5 percent of the faculty, based
primarily in non-humanities de
partments, brings in 50 percent
of campus research volume.
Siegman said there are indirect
costs associated with humanities
departments "which are paid by
the University in a way that is
hidden," as part of the general
University budget for overhead.
To clarify matters, Siegman ad
vocates "full cost accounting." He
said, "If the University budgeted
every department at full costs,
everybody would understand the
reality of indirect costs, and there
would be much more motivation
to keep indirect costs down."
Forecasts for the future of in
direct cost rates are cautiously op
timistic. Chemistry Prof. James
Collman predicts "some decrease
eventually, but I don't know how
much, and I believe it will take a
long time."
