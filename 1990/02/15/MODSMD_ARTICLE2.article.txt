# Overhead expenses remain high
## Researchers disturbed despite promises to limit rate 
### Elizabeth Weiss 
The good news in the attempt to rem
edy the University's financial ailments
is its pledge to hold the indirect cost of
research at a 78 percent rate for 1991
and beyond. The bad news is that this
new rate will be the highest in the
country.
Researchers aware of the damage to
University programs done by high over
head expenses fear the action may do
little to improve an already precarious
situation.
In order to reduce a budget deficit
that is climbing every year, Provost
James Rosse told the Faculty Senate
last week that Stanford will cut its op
erating budget by $22 million over the
next 18 months.
An important goal of the massive
plan, Rosse said, is "to give our faculty

who conduct sponsored research the
best opportunity to compete for shrink
ing federal research dollars."
The University normally derives
about one-third of its budget from tui
tion and another third from indirect
cost recovery, which is money added to
research grants to cover such overhead
costs as building maintenance and
utilities.
When researchers calculate their over
head costs next year, they will first add
28 percent for staff and faculty benefits
to the actual research costs. Then an
other 78 percent of the combined
amount will be added to determine the
total cost of the project.
The total cost of research, therefore,
will be well more than twice the cost
of doing the actual research â€” and the
highest in the nation.
Both faculty and administrators ac

knowledge the potential dangers asso
ciated with maintaining such a high
indirect cost rate.
Researchers claim the high rate is a
distinct disadvantage in obtaining suf
ficient government funding for their
programs.
While it is difficult to produce statisti
cal evidence proving that a high indirect
cost rate hurts Stanford scientists hun
ting for grants, many researchers are
convinced that the amount of money
awarded them is affected by the Uni
versity's high rate. Approximately 90
percent of basic research funding comes
from government sources.
