ASIAN RUGS. Asian beef-flavored
ramen. The Asian Express.
Sound peculiar â€” perhaps even
heretical? The extent to which those
terms sound like misnomers reflects the
extent to which we've allowed the word
"oriental" to become standardized in the
English language.
But perhaps even more disturbing than
the persistent use of "Oriental" in con
junction with artifacts and cuisine is its
continued usage in describing people.
While the term "Asian" has become
accepted in organizations such as the
Asian American Student Association, it
still isn't uncommon to hear the word
"Oriental" floating around.
In fact, although the term Asian came
out of a growing consciousness movement
in the 19605, not unlike the movement
to change the term "colored" to "black,"
it wasn't until the 1970s that the term
Asian became standard Associated"Prrss
style used in newspapers.
Even now, nearly two decades later, a
few confused publications, such as The
Stanford Review, whether because of
their dearth of journalistic style or in
sensitivity toward racial issues, lag be
hind the times by using the word "Orien
tal" in their articles.
In an article in last week's Review, a
journalist described Okada, the Asian-
American theme house, as the "oriental
theme house," doubly pathetic in that
they also lopped off "-American" in its
description.
On the surface, the word "Oriental"
may seem innocuous and not unlike the
word Asian. The geographic terms
"Orient" and "Asia" are coupled with the

morphemes "-al" and "-n", respectively,
to create an meaning "a person
from that place."
The Orient, however, connotes an ex
otic, mysterious quality that has come
to perpetrate such stereotypes as the
"inscrutable Oriental".
The geographical concept of the Orient
also uses Europe as its reference point
for the center of the world, and thus
comes off as ethnocentric and derogatory.
In fact, the word "Oriental" is often used
interchangedly with adjectives such as
"strange" or "alien."
Even in comparing linguistic meaning,
however, one might ask, "Who cares?
Isn't this name thing a bit petty? Would
the Oriental American Student Organi
zation (OASA) be any different from the
Asian American Student Organization
(AASA)? Would Asian beef-flavored
ramen taste at all different from Oriental
beef-flavored ramen?" .
Or, to alter the words of the Bard a
bit, "What's in a name? That which we
call Oriental by another name would be
as stereotyped and discriminated
against."
Similarly, an Asian-American who ad
heres to the term "Oriental" might flip
pantly ask, "Does this mean I'm being
racist against myself?"
While use of the word "Oriental" may
not signify anything derogatory in intent,
it does reflect an apathy toward the ef
forts of the 1960s to promote an aware
ness of racial identity. While it would be
far-fetched to claim that language abso
lutely molds ideology or that words can
influence human thoughts to the extent
that Newspeak does in George Orwell's

novel "1984," there is no denying that
we are influenced by the framework of
the language we use.
What may seem like a trivial linguistic
difference reflects the way an entire race
is represented.
Thus, although the effort to make
"Oriental" defunct does not necessarily
ensure a diminishing of racial stereotyp
ing, it at least severs the possible negative
connotations of the word "Oriental" from
the description of a people.
.Even those that adhere to the terms
Asian or Asian-American might argue
that standardized expressions such as
"Oriental rug" deal with inanimate ob
jects ("How can I be derogatory to a
rug?"), hardly meriting the effort it would
take to clothe them in Asian terms.
Nevertheless, these objects represent the
culture of a people; retaining "Oriental"
sends mixed signals as how to identify
that culture.
While it's true that phrases such as
"Oriental rug" have become standardized
to the point of making "Asian rug" laugh
able, it's also true that some standards
are worth changing.
