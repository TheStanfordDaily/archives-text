## PRECOCIOUS IN THE POST Adam Keefe dominates Pac-10 in soph season 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Nineteen ninety was supposed
to be Adam Keefe's year. The
6-foot-9 sophomore was widely
considered the Cardinal's top returnee
and he was to be the key to Stanford's
success.
Keefe has been a dominant force
for Stanford this year, but not in the
way most people expected. Teams have
done everything they can to shut him
down most of the season, and he isn't
able to get the ball as much as he,
or the coaching staff, would like. But
the focus on him has allowed his team
mates to score and the result, while
personally frustrating, has been a
bunch of wins for the team.
And if the constant attention of op
ponents isn't enough, the past few
weeks Keefe has been hampered by
an ankle sprain. With the 14-7 Car
dinal heading into the stretch run,
Keefe reinjured the ankle Tuesday in
practice and will be slowed in this
weekend's games.
Stanford is in Los Angeles to face
USC at the Sports Arena tonight at
7:30 p.m. The Cardinal also plays
23rd-ranked UCLA Sunday afternoon
at Pauley Pavilion.
"The injury definitely makes it frus
trating," Keefe said. "Dake (Walden,
the team's trainer) said it was about
two or three days away from being
back to 100 percent [before Tuesday]."
The injury, which is actually a com
bination sprained left foot and ankle,
originally occurred in a game at
Oregon State two weeks ago. He rein
jured it last week and scored only
four and nine points, respectively, in
wins over Washington State and
Washington over last weekend.
Those are the only two times this
season that Keefe, the Cardinal's
leading scorer and rebounder, has not

reached double figures in scoring.
That Keefe made it to double fig
ures in each of Stanford's first 19
games is impressive, considering what
teams have done in an attempt to
stop him. In fact, the defenses he has
encountered have been almost as frus
trating as the ankle injury.
Against UCLA earlier this year in
Maples Pavilion, Keefe had 18 points
at halftime on 5-of-5 shooting from
the field. The Bruins came out after
intermission with a box-and-one de
fense, meaning guard Gerald Madkins
followed Keefe everywhere, trying to
keep the ball out of his hands. Mean
while UCLA's other four players were
in a zone defense and were ready and
willing to help Madkins if Keefe ever
did manage to get the ball.
Keefe only had five second-half
points, and got off only one shot, but
guards Kenny Ammann and John
Patrick had only one man guarding
the two of them. Those two, who said
it was "like playing 'Horse,' " com
bined for 39 points and led Stanford
to the win.
Just last Sunday the Huskies tried
a different gimmick defense to stop
the big redhead. They had three
players play a tight zone around Keefe

in the low post and matched their
other two players up on Ammann and
Patrick, man-to-man. This time for
wards Deshon Wingate and Andrew
Vlahov picked up the slack offensively,
producing another Stanford win.
"What teams are doing and the at
tention is frustrating," Keefe said. "As
a player, you'd rather be the one, not
have the other players do the job.. . .
You want to go out and do things
yourself. What I have to realize is
while I'm not scoring big numbers or
rebounding big numbers, I'm helping
the other guys out."
The attention is a big change for
Keefe, wno came off the bench as a
freshman last year. "Last year I think
that was part of my success," he said.
"I was able to hide behind Howard
Wright and Eric Reveno. People were
taking a deep breath when I came in.
I think other teams were glad to see
me coming in because that meant one
of those two was going out."
But despite the change in roles,
Keefe doesn't think his game is any
different. "This year I don't think I'm
doing anything any different," he said.
"I'm still shooting shots I think I can

leaders in scoring and rebounding.
make; I'm just shooting more of
them."
Change or no change, his
results this year have been im
pressive. Although he is averaging
less than 11 shots a game, Keefe
is fourth in the Pacific 10 Con
ference in scoring at 18.8 points
a game. He is the league's top
rebounder with 9.3 a game and
is also leading the conference in
field goal percentage.
With numbers like that, Keefe
looks like a lock for the All-Pac-10
team. But he isn't worried about
that. "I've never really been one
to set personal goals," he said.
"When I had my meeting with
(Coach Mike) Montgomery before
the season, he mentioned the
numbers 20 (points) and 10
(rebounds). I thought that was a
little unrealistic. ... I think my
goals are just to establish myself
as a force inside."
Judging from the defenses he
has seen this year, Keefe has met
those goals and more. "Teams are
doing things to try to slow me
down and let others carry the
load," he said. "It seems the teams
that have concentrated on doing
that have really paid the price. I
don't think there's anyone on this
team you can disregard."
