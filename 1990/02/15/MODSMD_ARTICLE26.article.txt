# Val Whiting plays beyond her years as a freshman
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
On the court, Val Whiting
is the kind of intimidat
ing, physical player oppo
nents hate to match up against.
Whether she is scoring in the
low post or blocking a shot into
the seats, Whiting does her part
to make the other team
miserable.
Off the court, Whiting is soft
spoken, friendly and always
quick with a joke — the kind of
person teammates love to have
around. If Whiting were a little
used reserve, she could make a
significant contribution to her
team with her positive attitude.
But the 6-foot-3 freshman
from Wilmington, Del. is any
thing but a bit player. Whiting
is the "sixth man" for the No.
3-ranked Stanford Cardinal
women's basketball team.
Last year, when the Cardinal
came up one win short of the
Final Four, it was obvious the
team's biggest weakness was
rebounding. In two of Stanford's
three defeats last season — an
early-season matchup with pe
rennial powerhouse Tennessee
and the regional final of the
NCAA tournament versus Lou
isiana Tech — the opposition
outrebounded the Cardinal by a
wide margin.
Though the team's top re
bounder, Evon Asforis, was
headed for graduation, Coach
Tara VanDerveer knew her team
would do a better job on the

glass this season. The primary
reason was the arrival of
Whiting, a prep superstar who
average 30.3 points and 16.1
rebounds during her senior year
at Ursuline Academy.
Whiting, says,"I didn't know
where I'd fit in (at Stanford)."
She got a pretty good idea,
though, when she received calls
from VanDerveer and her assis
tants. "All I'd hear on the tele
phone was rebounding, rebound
ing," Whiting remembers. "So I
guessed I would be a rebounder."
So far she has not disap
pointed. Whiting is pulling down
7.6 boards per game, tops on the
team and good enough for sixth
in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Due in part to Whiting's efforts,
Stanford gets 5.8 more rebounds
per game than the opposition
versus 2.8 last year.
The Cardinal center is also
14th in the Pac-10 in scoring at
14.2 points per game, second in
blocked shots at 1.9 and tops in
field goal percentage at .554.
Perhaps the most impressive
thing is that Whiting is doing it
all in a reserve role — a marked
contrast to her high school days
when she was the focal point of
four straight state champions at
Ursuline.
"It's been a big adjustment,"
Whiting says of coming off the
bench. "But my ego hasn't fal
len." Before the season began,
one of the two low-post positions
was already reserved for all
conference performer Trisha
Stevens. Julie Zeilstra had the

inside track for the other one,
though it was possible Whiting
might win the job in the fall.
The thought never entered her
mind.
"I really didn't think about
starting, I just wanted to con
tribute," Whiting says. "Honest
ly, I thought I wouldn't start
because I was a freshman."
Being a reserve has not done
anything to dampen her enthu
siasm. "I just try to psych myself
up on the bench to get ready,"
she adds.
Says VanDerveer: "She's han
dled it very well. Val provides a
real good spark coming in off
the bench. It's not like we drop
off. I think it's good for her to
watch and see what's going on.
"Val is really bright. She can
watch the game and make ad
justments," VanDerveer adds.
Stevens agrees. "When she
subs in for me, there is not going
to be any let down," Stevens
says. "There's going to be a boost
if anything."
VanDerveer calls Whiting the
team's "sixth starter" and says,

"I think it's more important
who's in at the end of the game
than at the beginning.
"Val, Trisha and Julie play
really well together. I'd like to
think we have three of the best
post people (in the country) on
one team," she adds. "Val is a
different type of player than
Trisha or Julie. She is very phys
ical and aggressive. She comple
ments them real well."
Despite the success she has
attained so far, Whiting is any
thing but satisfied. She says the
biggest thing she has had to deal
with is "the fast pace of the
game."
"In high school, you can stall
the ball for two minutes if you
want," Whiting says. To play in
the Cardinal's up-tempo system,
Whiting says she is "practicing
hard and getting advice from the
coaches. I watch video of our
games to' see what I'm doing
wrong."
Mostly, though, she sees what
she does right, as her coach will

attest. "Val has great hands. She
catches just about everything
thrown her way," VanDerveer
says."I really like her quick move
to the basket, too.
"Val is our best rebounder. She
doesn't make very many mistakes
and handles the ball real well,"
VanDerveer adds.
Not that VanDerveer dofesn't
see room for improvement. "Val
has a presence. She blocks shots,
rebounds and can play very good
defense. But the hardest thing for
a freshman is adjusting to the
intensity and pace (of the college
game). She will do even better
when she is stronger and in better
shape," VanDerveer explains.
Stevens, who spends a lot of
time playing against Whiting in
practice, is impressed with the
freshman. "Val's already out
standing," she says. As for her
future, "the sky's the limit,"
Stevens adds.
Whiting is also making her
presence felt outside of basketball.
"The best thing about her,"
Stevens says, "is her attitude and
personality. She's a lot of fun to
be around. Val is not one
dimensional."
When she is not busy practicing,
Whiting finds time to coach her
dorm's intramural basketball

team and, of course, do her school
work.
"I felt a little frantic the first
quarter. 1 think all freshmen feel
that way," Whiting says.
For someone who says"I always
wanted to go somewhere on the
West Coast for college," Stanford
has not been a disappointment. "I
love it. That's all I have to say."
Whiting is especially enjoying
herself on the court where an
average of 2,700 fans — a school
record — comes out to watch the
Cardinal play. At home games,
people from Whiting's dorm take
over a section and hold up a sign
that reads "Val's Pals."
"The games playing before the
big crowds have been especially
fun," she says. "It's good to have
people come out and support
you."
She says the only game that
was not fun was last Saturday
night's, the loss at Washington.
"It was tough, but we can learn
from it. Better now than in the
NCAA tournament," she says.
"We have to work harder, get
stronger mentally and physically,"
she explains. "We're not as strong
mentally as we need to be."
But Whiting is confident that
once March rolls around, she and
her teammates will be ready. She
has won championships four years
in a row and there is no reason
why she cannot keep the streak
going.
