# Football attracts another top-20 class
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Proving that last year's out
standing freshman class was not
a fluke, football Coach Denny
Green announced the signings of
letters of intent by 17 players yes
terday. The class has already been
rated the 15th-best in the nation
by scouting expert Tom Lemming
and is widely considered one of
the nation's top 20.
"We're extremely pleased with
the 1990 recruiting class," Green
said. "We feel we were able to
achieve excellent balance in our
offensive and defensive prospects.
Our number-one objective was to
find players who have exhibited
leadership qualities and have a
history of producing consistent,
winning efforts. All of our players
exemplify that trait."
At the top of the class are a
trio of West Coast players:
Hartwell Brown, Jason Fisk and
Tommy Knecht. Brown is perhaps
the most highly-regarded of the
17 signees. He is a 6-foot-3, 235-

pound defensive end from Los
Alamos, Calif., who will play out
side linebacker at Stanford. He
was named Super Prep maga
zine's Far West Defensive Player
of the Year.
"The big thing about Hartwell
Brown is he's an explosive player,"
Green said. "He's an ideal guy for
us. He's a bigtime recruit —
everybody was after him."
Fisk, a 6-4, 250-pound defensive
lineman from Davis, Calif.,
declined recruiting trips to Notre
Dame, USC and Colorado because
he knew he wanted to go to Stan
ford.
Knecht was rated the fourth
best quarterback in the nation by
Lemming and the eighth-best by
Super Prep. Lemming also named
him the West Coast Offensive
Player of the Year. The 6-3, 195-
pound Corvallis, Ore., native
threw for 1518 yards last year
"Stanford gives you the balance
between academics and athletics
that no other college in America
can give you," Knecht said. "And
Stanford football is on the way

up — they'll be in a bowl game
in a year or two."
Green brought in 16 high
schoolers and one junior college
transfer yesterday, the first day
of the letter of intent signing pe
riod. He feels nearly all of them
have the potential to contribute
immediately in some capacity.
Joining Brown and Fisk on de
fense next year will be 6-1, 220-
pound linebacker Dan Byers; 6-6,
255-po ind lineman Mike Jerich;
and, 6-4, 250-pound lineman Ross
McQuivey.
Byers transferred to Stanford
before this quarter from Butte
Junior College, where his team
gave up only 31 yards rushing a
game last year. "He will challenge
in the spring for a starting spot,"
Green said.
Green brought in three new
running backs: Ethan Allen (6-1,
185) from St. Peter, Minn., who
was a 1000-yard rusher last year;
Roger Boden (5-11, 175) of
Hacienda Heights, Calif., who
could be an immediate starter as
a kick and punt returner; and

Mark Hatzenhuhler (6-1, 225) of
Gait, Calif., who had 2,162 yards
and 28 touchdowns last year.
Also added to the offense are
wide reciever Vaughn Bryant (5-
11, 175), a high school quarter
back from Orchard Lake, Mich.;
tight end Tony Cline (6-5, 240)
from Davis, Calif.; lineman Seth
Dittman (6-8, 260) from Tigard,
Ore.; wideout David Shaw (6-1,
195), the son of Cardinal second
ary Coach Willie Shaw, of Union
City, Calif.; and center Scott
White (6-5, 260) of Vienna, Va.
The Cardinal also added run
ning back/defensive back Kevin
Garnett (5-11, 190) and
placekicker Aaron Mills of Satel
lite Beach, Fla. Garnett, of Naper
ville, 111., is the younger brother
of Stanford freshman Dave Gar
nett. The elder Garnett earned a
starting inside linebacking job
early last season.
"This group has a lot more bal
ance (than last year's)," Green
said. There are certain guys in
this group who you know are
'comers.'
