# Card gets snowed
## 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
Neither rain, nor sleet, nor
even snow could keep the Stan
ford women's golf team from a
strong completion of yester
day's final round of the Uni
versity of Arizona Intercol
legiate.
The Cardinal put on its rain
gear and completed its debut
event of the winter season tied
for third, only four shots of the
pace set by victorious Arizona
State.
It was a "White Valentine's
Day," as a freak storm buffeted
the Tucson area with gale force
winds and an amalgam of snow
and freezing rain.
The horrendous conditions
made the already challenging
Randolph Park links all the
more difficult, as the 18-team
field struggled to complete
play.

vidually.
Baldwin was "extremely im
pressed" with the play of soph
omores Stephanie Davis and
Audrey Wooding. The pair
braved the elements yesterday
for fine rounds of 76 and 75.
According to Baldwin, soph
omore Adele Moore closed the
Arizona event with a "solid"
78, while senior Stephanie
Parel finished with a disap
pointing total of 240.
