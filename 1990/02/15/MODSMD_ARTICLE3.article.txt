# Dry Rush and closed parties
## Phi Delts propose new guidelines 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
The Phi Delta Theta fraternity will
submit to the University today plans
for a completely dry Rush and other
dramatic changes in social guidelines.
The proposal is a marked departure
from traditional house policy. Among
its provisions, the Phi Delts have out
lined a shift in emphasis from open to
closed parties, elimination of alcohol
from all open parties and the institution
of a completely dry Rush.
The Phi Delts negotiated the terms
of their new social policy with Univer
sity officials on Tuesday. The fraternity
then revised its proposal and will resub-

Mit it for approval this
morning.
After four months of
social suspension pend
ing an investigation,
the Phi Delts' status
should be cleared by the
end of the week, accord
ing to Universty offi
cials.
In October, fraternal

affairs adviser Michael Hughes
suspended the fraternity when an in
toxicated freshman was hit by a truck
after leaving a Phi Delt party.
After Hughes, Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson and director of
the Row Diana Conklin review the doc

ument, its key elements will be incor
porated into the final University report
to be submitted to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons.
Both Hughes and Jackson expect a
speedy approval of the document.
"We anticipate an acceptance, seeing
as Lyons has been working closely with
us throughout the entire process," said
Hughes, who has been handling the Phi
Delt investigation since October.
Lyons could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
The Phi Delt proposal states the fra
ternity's concern with correcting its
"image problem" and"the regular oc-


Hughes
currence of a behavioral problem,"
which has concerned the Univer
sity for the last few years.
One of the most salient changes
outlined in the proposal is the
complete reversal of house policy
concerning Rush. By an over
whelming majority, the Phi Delts
chose to hold a completely dry
Rush.
In past years, Phi Delt Rush
was comprised of one dry week
and two weeks in which alcohol
was served at parties.
Although dry parties could
work against the Phi Delts in at
tracting rushees, fraternity pres
ident Chris Helling feels the
chapter's strength and resolve to

"actively pursue Rush" will com
pensate for any disadvantage.
Shifting "the emphasis of the
chapter's social agenda from open
parties to closed parties" is an
other element of the Phi
Delt proposal.
Under the new policy, open par
ties will be restricted to weekend
afternoon, backyard events with
a focus on activities such as vol
leyball or basketball tournaments.
These functions will serve to
make the fraternity's facilities
available to the campus commu
nity without running the risk
involved in holding large parties
with alcohol.
Two types of closed parties will
be held under the Phi Delts' new
system.
The first is a mixer with a
sorority or other similarly defined

group. Such parties will be
restricted in attendance to mem
bers of these organizations.
The other type of closed party
will "allow each chapter member
a strictly limited number of in
vitations." The number of invita
tions per member will vary, but
attendance at each party will not
exceed 350 people at any time.
To further ensure the safety of
their parties, the Phi Delts plan
to hire an outside service to mon
itor doors and serve alcohol.
Door monitors will be in
structed to admit only those in
dividuals with an invitation and
proper Stanford identification. In
addition, they will be told to
prevent intoxicated guests from
leaving the party. Sober monitors
from the fraternity will escort any
guests needing assistance.
