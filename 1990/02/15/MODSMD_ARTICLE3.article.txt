## Phi Delts propose new guidelines 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
The Phi Delta Theta fraternity will
submit to the University today plans
for a completely dry Rush and other
dramatic changes in social guidelines.
The proposal is a marked departure
from traditional house policy. Among
its provisions, the Phi Delts have out
lined a shift in emphasis from open to
closed parties, elimination of alcohol
from all open parties and the institution
of a completely dry Rush.
The Phi Delts negotiated the terms
of their new social policy with Univer
sity officials on Tuesday. The fraternity
then revised its proposal and will resub-

Mit it for approval this
morning.
After four months of
social suspension pend
ing an investigation,
the Phi Delts' status
should be cleared by the
end of the week, accord
ing to Universty offi
cials.
In October, fraternal

affairs adviser Michael Hughes
suspended the fraternity when an in
toxicated freshman was hit by a truck
after leaving a Phi Delt party.
After Hughes, Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson and director of
the Row Diana Conklin review the doc

ument, its key elements will be incor
porated into the final University report
to be submitted to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons.
Both Hughes and Jackson expect a
speedy approval of the document.
"We anticipate an acceptance, seeing
as Lyons has been working closely with
us throughout the entire process," said
Hughes, who has been handling the Phi
Delt investigation since October.
Lyons could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
The Phi Delt proposal states the fra
ternity's concern with correcting its
"image problem" and"the regular oc-
