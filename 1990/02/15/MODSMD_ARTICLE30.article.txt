# Don says: check the tape
## 
### 
I've got it. There seems to
have been a slight disagree
ment this week over the
"legality" of Buster Douglas's
dismantling of Mike Tyson, but
I've figured out how incredible
snafus such as this can be
avoided. It's really quite simple.
Now, you've seen all the pic
tures and read all the stories —
Buster won. I mean, he was
standing and Tyson wasn't,
right? I don't know much about
boxing (other than it seems
really stupid that people shell
out hundreds of dollars to watch
two grown men hit each other),
but isn't that how things like
boxing matches and wars are
decided? The last one standing
wins?
Well, no. At least not in Don
King's world. Don says Buster
got the benefit of a long count
in the eighth round, and be
cause of it, his knockout of Iron
Mike shouldn't count. Well hey,
this seems like a legitimate
gripe, doesn't it? After all,
Douglas only landed more
punches and jabs than Mike on
the way to knocking him silly
in the 10th. He must have had
to cheat to win.
Anyway, it seems the ref got
confused in the eighth and gave
Buster a few extra seconds to
recover from his fall. True
enough; however, Buster was
completely coherent at the time
and was only waiting for a few
seconds before standing. No big
deal.
Not so, screams Don. Buster
was the beneficiary of a long
count, which means he should
have been out of the fight. And

— this is the crucial point —
King used television replays to
make his case.
Does anyone see what would
have solved this whole mess
before it even started? C'mon,
it's easy!
Instant replay!
Think about it: Instant
replay, as everyone
knows, is a joke. So is
boxing. Instant replay is annoy
ing. So is Don King. It's a perfect
three-way match.
The basic premise would work
something like this: Any time a
fighter knocked down his op
ponent, the Replay Clock would
start to tick. The ref would
count as well, but that really
wouldn't matter. (Referees are
now inconsequential in the
NFL, but no one wants to admit
it.) If the fallen boxer regains
his feet, the fight would stop
then and there to wait for the
instant replay verdict.
The official would then pore
over the tape for, say, ten
minutes, and if he determined
that the refs count was wrong,
the fight would be over. "Sorry,
Buster. I know it looks like
you're fine, but the videotape's
got you in a half crouch after

10.001 seconds. You're gone."
If the tape was "i n -
conclusive," the fight would go
on. Of course, the flow would
be completely disrupted, the
long wait would be a pain in
the rear and the crowd would
have nothing to do during the
break except sweat on each
other, but that's progress.
In fact, instant replay should
be used in all sports. Retroac
tively. Don Larsen's perfect
game in the 1956 World Series?
Forget it. The final called strike
missed the plate by two inches.
Mary Lou Retton's perfect
vault? No way. Check the
replays and you'll see a hop at
the end. Take away the gold.
Michael Jordan's shot to beat
Cleveland in the playoffs last
year? He.walked. Michael's
NCAA Championship-winning
shot in 1982? No dice. James
Worthy was in the paint too
long Franco Harris' Immac
ulate Reception (the single
greatest play of all time) in
1972? Touched the ground.
Doug Flutie's Hail Mary to beat
Miami in 1984? He wasn't
wearing his mouthpiece. No
touchdown.
Now, if we'd had instant
replay all these years, none of
this nonsense would have hap
pened. And, of course, the sports
world would have been a much
better place.
Yeesh.

Well, no. At least not in Don
King's world. Don says Buster
got the benefit of a long count
in the eighth round, and be
cause of it, his knockout of Iron
Mike shouldn't count. Well hey,
this seems like a legitimate
gripe, doesn't it? After all,
Douglas only landed more
punches and jabs than Mike on
the way to knocking him silly
in the 10th. He must have had
to cheat to win.
Anyway, it seems the ref got
confused in the eighth and gave
Buster a few extra seconds to
recover from his fall. True
enough; however, Buster was
completely coherent at the time
and was only waiting for a few
seconds before standing. No big
deal.
Not so, screams Don. Buster
was the beneficiary of a long
count, which means he should
have been out of the fight. And

— this is the crucial point —
King used television replays to
make his case.
Does anyone see what would
have solved this whole mess
before it even started? C'mon,
it's easy!
Instant replay!
Think about it: Instant
replay, as everyone
knows, is a joke. So is
boxing. Instant replay is annoy
ing. So is Don King. It's a perfect
three-way match.
The basic premise would work
something like this: Any time a
fighter knocked down his op
ponent, the Replay Clock would
start to tick. The ref would
count as well, but that really
wouldn't matter. (Referees are
now inconsequential in the
NFL, but no one wants to admit
it.) If the fallen boxer regains
his feet, the fight would stop
then and there to wait for the
instant replay verdict.
The official would then pore
over the tape for, say, ten
minutes, and if he determined
that the refs count was wrong,
the fight would be over. "Sorry,
Buster. I know it looks like
you're fine, but the videotape's
got you in a half crouch after

10.001 seconds. You're gone."
If the tape was "i n -
conclusive," the fight would go
on. Of course, the flow would
be completely disrupted, the
long wait would be a pain in
the rear and the crowd would
have nothing to do during the
break except sweat on each
other, but that's progress.
In fact, instant replay should
be used in all sports. Retroac
tively. Don Larsen's perfect
game in the 1956 World Series?
Forget it. The final called strike
missed the plate by two inches.
Mary Lou Retton's perfect
vault? No way. Check the
replays and you'll see a hop at
the end. Take away the gold.
Michael Jordan's shot to beat
Cleveland in the playoffs last
year? He.walked. Michael's
NCAA Championship-winning
shot in 1982? No dice. James
Worthy was in the paint too
long Franco Harris' Immac
ulate Reception (the single
greatest play of all time) in
1972? Touched the ground.
Doug Flutie's Hail Mary to beat
Miami in 1984? He wasn't
wearing his mouthpiece. No
touchdown.
Now, if we'd had instant
replay all these years, none of
this nonsense would have hap
pened. And, of course, the sports
world would have been a much
better place.
Yeesh.

Cameron Macky missed four
free throws in The Daily's one
point IM hoops loss to Cedro
last week, but replay officials
are still looking at the tapes.
