When most travelers return
from Hawaii, they bring back a
few things like tans, flower leis
and the like. The Stanford men's
volleyball team brought back two
things that won't fade nearly as
fast: a pair of wins over the
fourth-ranked Rainbow Warriors.
After defeating Hawaii fairly
easily Monday night, the second
ranked Cardinal faced the task of
doing it again. After a slow start,
Stanford did just that, pulling out
a 12-15, 9-15, 15-10, 15-8, 15-11
victory.

Stanford raised its record to 4-1
overall, 4-0 in Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association play.
Hawaii is now 8-4, 4-2. Stanford
is tied with USC atop the Wilson
Division in the WIVA standings.
"The first two games Hawaii
was hotter than a firecracker,"
Cardinal Coach Fred Sturm said.
"It seemed every ball we hit their
way got blocked or got dug. . . .
The third game we started getting
into our rhythm."
As has been the case for most
of the last three years, Dan Hanan
led the way for Stanford. He had
29 kills, 23 digs and nine blocks,

all match-highs, and hit .418.
Duncan Blackman added 23 kills
and 17 digs and Craig Forsyth
had 13 kills, 10 digs, six blocks
and a .500 hitting percentage.
Sophomore transfer Robert
Hillman also helped. He came into
the match in the third game for
his fir. a t-ever appearence in a
Stanford uniform and recorded 12
kills, seven digs and three blocks.
"I think the real story of the
second match was Hillman,"
Sturm said. "Bob came in in the
third game and really sparked the
team. He, as much as anyone,
turned it around."
