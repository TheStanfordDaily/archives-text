# Tennis star and tutor
## Cathrall schools opponents, teaches math 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
If you see someone walking
around campus wearing a cape,
it's probably Jeff Cathrall.
Not only does Cathrall play No.
3 on the best team in college ten
nis, but he also is taking 20 units,
tutoring math six hours a week
and trying to graduate after miss
ing the entire fall quarter.
The senior, who is mtyoring in
mathematics, spent last Fall trav
eling around the world on the As
sociated Tennis Professional cir
cuit. "It had its ups and downs,"
Cathrall said. "It's pretty gruel
ing."
But taking on grueling tasks is
nothing new to Cathrall, who will
miss this weekend's NorCal Inter
collegiate tournament because of
academic demands.
Although the academic de
mands may stop Cathrall from
attending various tournaments
this year, they will not halt his
tutoring. "It's something I really
enjoy. I enjoy helping people. I
feel like someday I might want to
be a teacher," said Cathrall, who
works as a math tutor for the
Academic Resource Center and
the Mathematics Department.
Cathrall's team members are
not complaining as Catrhall has
tutored three tennis players reg
ularly this year. Several more are
waiting in the wings.
"[Cathrall's tutoring] really
shows another side to the guy. He
likes helping other people, and
that says a lot," Asst. Coach John
Whitlinger said. "I know I cer
tainly could have used him [when
I went to school here]."
When he is not giving math les
sons, Cathrall is giving tennis les
sons — to Cardinal opponents, of
course. "I truly believe there is
no one in college tennis he can't
beat," Coach Dick Gould said.
"The biggest challenge for him is

to try to keep his results consis
tent day in and day out."
Cathrall agreed, saying that
mental consistency and aggres
siveness are the two things on
which he needs to improve.'"l am
trying to work on my concentra
tion. Sometimes I have problems
with that," said Cathrall, who was
ranked No. 36 in the pre-season
Volvo Intercollegiate Tennis
Rankings. "I also am trying to
work on my aggressive game, but
not necessarily my serve-and
volley game. I think I'm best when
I am being aggressive [from the
baseline]. Most great players have
one thing they do particularly
well. McEnroe mastered the
serve-and-volley game. Lendl
plays off the ground very well."
Gould added that Cathrall has
become a more well-rounded
player while at Stanford. "When
he came here as a freshman, he
used to let the ball drop down
low and then hit it as hard as he
could," Gould said. "But he has

added a lot of variety lately. His
volley has improved a lot. I still
would like to see him serve and
volley more."
Despite starting all four years
for the Cardinal, Cathrall has
never played in the No. 1 spot.
"It's got to be tough because he's
never had a chance to play No.
1," Gould said. "But he still has
to come out here and played his
best. I certainly respect him for
that."
After graduation, Cathrall said
he will give the professional cir
cuit another shot. "I am just going
to go out there and see how I do.
There's a lot of good players," he
said.
Cathrall will not play in the
match today against San Diego
State to give sophomore Jason Yee
a chance to compete. Yee will fill
Cathrall's vacated spot at the Nor-
Cal Intercollegiates as well. Cath
rall will be ready, however, for the
all-important National Team In
doors Thursday in Louisville, Ky.


Tracy Allen — Daily file
Jeff Cathrall, a senior from Lakewood, Colo., has been a solid
four-year starter on the highly talented Cardinal men's tennis team.
"Catman," who was No. 36 in the Volvo preseason rankings, devotes
some of his time off the court to tutoring math to other Stanford
students.
