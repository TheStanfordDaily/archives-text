## Bowled over No longer just for the Midwest, bowling catches fire on coasts 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
|S\sTANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

Ever since "Laverne and Shirley" went off the air, bowling has lost
one of its biggest plugs. Mr. DeFazio's alley, where Lenny and Squiggy
spent many an hour trying to "pick up chicks," provided the most
frequent hangout for the Milwaukeeans.
And while bowling is often viewed solely as the sport of the Mid
west, where cold winter nights force residents inside for entertain
ment, the sport is gaining popularity outside the Great Lakes states
Prizes and ratings on the Pro Bowlers' Tour are on the rise, and
new multi-lane complexes have been built to add to the Americar
landscape created by movie multiplexes.
For Stanford students, bowling can provide an alternative
entertainment source to fraternity parties, movies and excur
sions to the City. Three local alleys offer a variety of
atmospheres, and a trip to San Francisco's Rock 'N Bowl
any Friday or Saturday night can appease any crowd that
is split between an urge to bowl and a desire to dance.
The three closest alleys are Palo Alto Bowl in Palo Alto,
Camino Bowl in Mountain View and Mel's Redwood Bowl
in Redwood City. All three are located on El Camino
Real, making it easy for hard-core bowlers to make
a whirlwind tour of the trio.
Camino and Palo Alto, both owned by the same comp
any, offer a mixed atmosphere between old and new.
Both feature state-of-the-art automatic scoring and
slightly renovated facilities, but both show some wear
and tear from bowler after bowler shooting for that
highly prized 300 game.
Rates are the same at both lanes, and the prices show
that bowling has become more expensive since the days
of junior high bowling leagues. From 5 p.m. to mid
night, bowling will set you back $2.75 per game; any
other time, games are $2.25 apiece. Shoes cost $1.50,
and as always, you will need to leave one at the counter.
Some special rates are available at different times, but
offers vary on the season.
Camino's best feature is derived from its Safeway ,
schedule: 24-hour bowling. You haven't really had a full
day until you've bowled from 1 to 4 in the morning. Lyon's
Restaurant, located just down the street, offers a neat
early morning breakfast stop for hungry bowlers.
Palo Alto Bowl unfortunately closes at midnight. ,
If you are at either alley early enough, food and drinks
can complement your evening, as both alleys have a full bar
with big-screen TV. Palo Alto even has a full-fledged snack
bar with a variety of inexpensive snack foods and Chinese en
trees, including daily specials.

For those in need of a haircut between games, Palo Alto Bowl
even has a beauty salon inside.
Mel's Redwood Bowl, although a little farther from campus, of
fers all the basics at cheaper rates ($1.75 or $2.25 per game, $1
for shoes) and caters more to the hard-core bowler who does not
miss all the amenities found at the other two.
Although automatic scoring and a full bar are not available, the most
noticeable absentee is the ever-important jukebox â€” which at Camino pro
vides a nostalgic mix of old classics and some new songs to help you burn the
midnight oil.
For those who really want an experience to last a lifetime, Rock 'N Bowl has
22 lanes with the usual bowling excitement, supplemented well by music from a large
sound system and rock videos on the automatic scoring screens. For between $6 and
$9, you can bowl and dance all you want for two to three hours in one of two shifts
each night.
Spaces usually fill up, so reservations often help if you want to get in.

The Senior Class will honor America's sport tonight by holding Senior I'uh Night at
Palo Alto Bowl, from 9 p.m. to midnight.
