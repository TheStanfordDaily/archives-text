# Boingo keeps lighting darkness in 'Tunnel'
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
From a band with a name like
"Oingo Boingo," serious, introspec
tive music is the last thing one
would expect.
But Oingo Boingo's newest al
bum, "Dark at the End of the Tun
nel" makes one think again. Gone
are the days of bouncy songs like
"Only A Lad," the dance tracks
like "Elevator Man," movie cuts
like "Weird Science," and commer
cial sell-outs like "Not my Slave."
"Dark at the End of the Tunnel"
displays musical textures, unor
thodox rhythms, and insightful
lyrics previously unheard of by this
Southern California band.
"We're moving in a new direc
tion," said lead vocalist Danny
Elfman, "exploring texture, mood,
and melody. It's more than a single
dimension."
Undoubtedly, with this album,
Oingo Boingo is making a bold
move toward critical respectability.
Perhaps it's just a continuation of
the process catalyzed by the recent
success of Elfman's critically ac
claimed "Batman" score. Or maybe
it's that the band is finally matur
ing. Whatever the reason, the
results are musically and lyrically
impressive.
"Out of Control," clearly the al
bum's finest track, exemplifies the

new techniques of Oingo Boingo,
as they deftly descibe the terrors
of teenage suicide. Elfman's vocal
range is strengthened by the un
orthodox beats, and the song
smoothly flows right through the
track's sudden starts and stops.
Lyrically, the song is insightfully
profound, and Elfman's voice
matches the words with a dash of
vulnerability You're out of control,
and you want the world to love
you/Or maybe you just want a
chance/To let thern know that you
live and breathe and suffer.
In many of the album's tracks,
Oingo Boingo takes their tradi
tional formulas and turns them
upside-down. The sudden stops of
"Long Breakdown" arc unpredic
tably enjoyable. "Skin" starts with
the band's trademark xylophone,
but suddenly breaks into Beach
Boys-like harmonies.
Even the album's slow spots,
like "When the Lights Go Down"
and "Glory Be," are supported by
the momentum of the other tracks.
Sam Phipps' opening horns on
"Dream Somehow" and "Try to
Believe" spark the album's syn
thesizers and guitars. An added
bonus is "Flesh 'N' Blood," a track

from this summer's "Ghostbusters
II" soundtrack.
"Dark at the End of the Tunnel"
lust may he the album which
propels Oingo Boingo to commer
cial success and critical applause.

The band definitely deserves the
success. After all, this album was
a long time in the making

Oingo Roingo's new album will be
released February 20.
