# Costner's 'Revenge' is sweet fare for fans
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
Unlike any other film in
recent memory, "Revenge"
depicts the extreme intensity
and costs of both love and
revenge.
Though set in the present,
the basic story could easily be
a Shakespearean tragedy Not
that "Revenge" has esoteric,
literary pretensions. It simply
concentrates on the intangible
covenants formed in friendship
and love and the violence that
erupts from their betrayal.
After Cochran (Kevin
Costner) retires as a Navy pilot,
the story shifts to Mexico,
where he goes to visit his ten
nis/hunting partner, Tiburon
(Anthony Quinn) While he is
there, Tiburon's wife, Miryea
(Madeleine Stowe), quietly
pursues him Equally attracted,
Cochran resists her advances at
first out of respect for Tiburon
However, he eventually suc
cumbs and sets in motion the
tragic consequences.
Director Tony Scott of "Top
Gun" fame tackles a much
stronger story this time around

Kevin Costner

and proves his skill. Scott's
heavily stylized look works to
the advantage of the film with
out dominating it.
The pnmary flaws of the film
arise from the script by Jim Har
rison and Jeffrey Fiskin. The
pseudo-father-son relationship
between Cochran and Tiburon
is a strength that is not ex
ploited enough in the film.
Once again, Costner confirms
himself as one of the pre
eminent leading men in Amer
ican film. In "Revenge," he plays
a darker, more vicious character
that is only the protagonist, not
the hero. In addition, Quinn
proves he is an actor that lives
up to his legendary status.
The chemistry between
Quinn and Costner creates a
completely convincing father
son relationship As Tiburon's
caged, young wife, Stowe gives
perhaps the most sensual, smol
dering performance in years.
Revenge" will open nationally
