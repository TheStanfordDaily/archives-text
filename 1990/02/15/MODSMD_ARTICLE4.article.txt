# Financial aid seen as obstacle to creating diverse student body
## 
### Lena Slachmuijlder Staff writer 
Despite the University's commitment
to "need-blind" admissions and the
"need-based" allocation of financial aid,
Stanford is still perceived by many pro
spective students as an unaffordable
"country club."
According to guidance counselors from
local high schools, most students are in
timidated by financial aid forms and sim
ply do not believe that they will receive
financial aid from an expensive private
school such as Stanford.
"We hold financial aid workshops in

the fall, hut they still don't do it," said
Margaret • Williams, an adviser at
CStlmont High School in Belmont, where
many students from East Palo Alto are
bussed.
Low-income students are often discour
aged from applying to Stanford by several
facets of the University's financial aid
policy, including recruiting techniques,
the ratio of self-help assistance to grants
and the absence of loan forgiveness pro
grams for students who enter public serv
ice after graduation.
Financial aids officer Nan McKenna,
who runs financial aid outreach pro
grams, said she has found that students

"come in with the idea that they can't
afford to come here." There should be
more emphasis placed on Stanford's
"need-blind" admissions at the programs,
she said.
Recruiting techniques that are not
geared to minority or low-income stu
dents can deter a possible applicant. Ac
cording to senior Jason Lewis, co-chair
of the Stanford American Indian Organ
ization, "there is not enough outreach to
Native Americans who are in the reserva
tions."
For Native Americans, "family systems
might differ," said James Larimore, di
rector of the Native American Cultural

Center. Students might have extended
family obligations, such as caring for sick
relatives, that are not accounted for by
the nuclear-family structure used at the
Financial Aids Office, he said.
Similarly, Williams said students at
Carlmont are often discouraged when
"the student profile doesn't fit with the
questions . . . they are a teenager with a
baby, or they live with their boyfriend's
parents."
Keith Archuleta, director of the Black
Community Services Center, said he
thinks Stanford's policies are particularly
"disuraging" to inner-city youths.
Policy changes since 1973, including

giving "more work-study hours, more
loans, and more responsibility," along
with less grants or scholarships, to stu
dents in need of financial assistance, have
made many poor black students unable
to afford Stanford, Archuleta said.
Under the current financial aid policy
self-help programs (work-study and
loans) can account for up to 25 percent
of the total cost of attending Stanford.
Decreasing the percentage of loans,
coupled with increased budgeting for
scholarships and grants, was one of the
financial aid recommendations by the
University Committee on Minority Is
sues.
