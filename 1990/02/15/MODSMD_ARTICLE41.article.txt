## Smart cop, dumb cop miss top 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
Gene Hackman is an extremely
versatile actor.
Throughout his career, it seems,
he has played in either exceptional
movies like "The French Connec
tion" and "Mississippi Burning,"
or awful movies like "The Package"
and "Superman IV." With "Loose
Cannons," Hackman continues
this trend, albeit not for the better
half of his career.
Instead of creating the motion
picture equivalent of a thundering
artillery barrage, "Loose Cannons"
produces the cinematic experience
of a .22-caliber pistol.
Starring Hackman and Dan Ayk
royd, "Loose Cannons" is based
upon the well-worn "buddy con
cept," in which the personalities
of the two protagonists are antit
hetical in nature. It follows that
the outcome is predictable from
the outset. Yes, once again, two
opposite characters come to some
sort of mutual understanding and
appreciation of one another. Yawn.
Another formulaic mistreatment
in this film involves the attempted

combination of action and comedy.
Striving for a "Beverly Hills Cop"
style, director Bob Clark has diffi
culty establishing a happy medium
between a realistic plot and various
amusing happenstances.
One example is the villain's ex
tensive shooting at guest star Dom
DeLuise from a five-foot distance
with an automatic assault rifle.
Later in the movie, DeLuise
emerges with only a few gripes
about the "12 ounces of lead in
his ass" which cause him slight
pain when sitting. Unlike DeLuise,
I felt considerable pain for being
forced to deal with such gross un
realism. Whew, Dom was lucky!
As could be expected, along with
such chicanery comes the tradi
tional plethora of bumbling FBI
men trying to butt in on our
heroes' case, bumbling villains
who manage to keep goofing up
when all the advantages are theirs,
and a beautiful, but still bumbling,

But then, what could
one really expect from
the man who brought
us 'The Love Boat!'

secret agent who aids our cham
pions in their fight against every
one.
Hackman seems out of character
in this movie, or in character if
one agrees with the dichotomy es
tablished above, while Aykxoyd
delivers yet another lackluster per
formance. Aykroyd's shenan
nigans become tiresome, and one
starts to hope that a bad guy will
just shoot him the next time he
starts up the schizophrenic
routine.
Overall, the movie has some
funny parts and some well
presented action scenes, but its at
tempt to fuse these two falls
limply, like a pop-gun cork on a
string. But then, what could one
really expect from producer Aaron
Spelling, the same man who
brought us "The Love Boat?"
