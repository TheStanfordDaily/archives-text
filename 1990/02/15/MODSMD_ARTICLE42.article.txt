# DeNiro, Fonda go off track
## Rambling plot, false starts obscure emotional story 
### Andrea Parkes Staff writer 
Two big names do not a great movie
make.
Perhaps MGM thought that casting Jane
Fonda and Robert DeNiro would overcome
the many obvious failings of the script of
"Stanley and Iris." They thought wrong.
While there are a few redeeming mo
ments, as a whole, "Stanley and Iris" is too
sickeningly sweet to be believable.
The overwhelming problem with the film
is its fragmented, rambling plot. Apparently,
the focus is on Iris, a recently-widowed
worker in a bakery factory, and her efforts
to teach illiterate co-worker Stanley to read.
Simultaneously, romance develops between
them.
Before making that intention even
remotely clear, however, the movie winds
through various false starts and complica
tions that are supposed to bring the two
into an intensely emotional bond. Instead,
the shuffling subplots occur without initia
tion, resolution, or apparent relevance.
This lack of direction carries over into
Stanley and Iris' personal relationship. Ini
tially, fate brings the two together, as Stanley
unsuccessfully attempts to nab a man who
has snatched Iris' purse.
The downward spiral of emotions contin
ues as Iris' sister is beaten by her husband,
Stanley loses his job, and Stanley's father
dies in a low-cost old age home. All of these
potentially heartbreaking events are handled

with enough sensitivity to make you wonder
why both of them don't see suicide as the
only alternative.
The cnitre relationship of Stanley and Iris
is so incredibly trite, that even the most
sentimental viewers can't help but feel
nauseous. It is truly a struggle to stay awake
until the love affair reaches its predictable
climax, as Stanley and Iris attain the
"American dream" — a six bedroom Detroit
house complete with brand new Buick.
Inexplicably, Stanley is able to transform
his hidden knack for making "contraptions"
into a great invention, the "quicker-cooling
multiple cake rack," and from there, success
is just beating down his door. His rags to
riches story lacks that special something
with which to titter on one's heartstrings.
Sadly, Stanley's quest for literacy is equally
uninspiring. Stanley's unexplained mood
swings from disillusionment to optimism
culminate in a triumphant march around
the public library while reciting from random
books, including the Bible. This scene
caused me more frustration and confusion
than I think Stanley felt all along the path.
"Stanley and Iris" does little to illuminate
the problem of adult illiteracy. And after
listening to the outrageously banal dialogue
of the script, one could hardly call this
screenplay a step toward literacy.
