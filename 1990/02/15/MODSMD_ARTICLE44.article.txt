# New tough-cop film lacks 'Lethal' charm
## 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
If "Lethal Weapon" was the
homo sapiens of action films, then
"Hard To Kill" would be the homo
erectus.
It lacks the intangibles of charm
and class that make "Die Hard"
and "Lethal Weapon" so watch
able. Nevertheless, it is far superior
to such Cannon Films classics as
"Invasion U.S.A."
The poster for the film basically
summarizes the plot to insure that
the audience is not too intellectu
ally taxed.
Steven Seagal plays Mason
Storm, the testosterone repository
of the Los Angeles Police Depart
ment. He's the kind of guy that
gets down on his knees to give a
knife-wielding punk a fair fight.
But there's more to Storm than
his gonads.
He's also a family man who
spends quality time with his son
and has sex with his wife. That
is, until three "hired assassins" kill
his family and leave him for dead.
The middle section of the film
is an interesting mixture of "Rip
Van Winkle" and "Rocky," as
Mason grows a long, flowing beard
while comatose for seven years.

O Hard to Kill
Steven Seagal

As it has been deemed by natural
law, the remainder of the film is
a ho-hum carousel of death. Every
one who is on camera for more
than 10 seconds dies, except for
Storm, his new companion (Kelly
Le Brock), and his son, secretly
alive.
The final action sequence does
offer one piece of realism. After
killing the man that murdered his
wife, Mason utters the most real
istic catch-phrase in film history:
"Fuck you, and die!" Considering
Storm had just killed six men and
had a gallon of adrenaline pumping
through him, a pithy statement
that rivals Shakespeare would have
definitely been out of place.
In only his second outing as a
leading man, Seagal is an effective
mixture of Clint Eastwood and
Sylvester Stallone. He has a certain
omniscient smugness that serves
him well, while also managing to
be a likeable guy.
"Hard To Kill" is not a bad film;
it just has to been seen in the
right context, like a Saturday night.
