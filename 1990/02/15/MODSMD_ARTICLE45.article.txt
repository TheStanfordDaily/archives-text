## No film prince, charming Ant back to music 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Sure, there's no more Antmusic,
no more Goody Two Shoes, and
no more An trap.
On the other hand, there's no
more Strip, no more Puss in Boots,
and no more Vive Le Rock. •
After four years of pursuing his
fledgling acting career, starring in
six films that nobody but late-night
Cinemax viewers may have seen,
Adam Ant has returned to practice
his original craft — music.
His last two albums — 1983's
"Strip" and 1985's "Vive Le Rock"
— left few anxiously awaiting an
other album, as it was obvious
that Ant was distracted by the
chance to have his face on film.
While Ant has not forfeited his
movie career — he stars in the
upcoming "Trust Me" — "Man
ners & Physique" shows a
rejuvenated focus on music.
Those who know Ant's musical
history will realize the appropriate
ness of the album's title, but Ant
no longer depends upon developing
an 18th-century "Prince Charm

ing" persona. The trademark war
paint and flamboyant pirate gear
are gone.
The music likewise has changed.
Produced by Andre Cymone, an
ex-Prince cohort who produces
Jody Watley's albums, Ant has
mixed a Minneapolis feel with his
London punk funk roots to produce
an enjoyable blend of danceable,
energetic songs.
"Room at the Top," the album's
first single, showcases Ant's new
confidence as he re-enters the
music world, while "Manners &
Physique" wittily characterizes the
skin-deep obsessions of Southern
Californians.
One strong influence remains
from the Adam and the Ants era
in the form of Marco Pirroni's
guitar work, which will make the
new sound immediately familiar
to old fans — even though the
infectious double-drummer march
effect is Anthistory.
