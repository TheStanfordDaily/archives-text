# Not R.E.M., but Toad a band to be reckoned with
## 
### Joe Pigato 
Every young rock group has to
pay its dues to break into the rock
'n' roll industry.
For the last two years, Toad the
Wet Sprocket wondered what the
future held for their moody, per
sonal musical offerings. Continu
ous gigs in bars and clubs built
up a dedicated following in Santa
Barbara, but the "big break" was
yet to come.
After a stint of shows in Los
Angeles, Columbia Records offered
Toad a four-album contract, un
precedented for a new group on a
major recording label. Soon, Toad
was touring with the B-52's and
Ziggy Marley, and receiving critical
and commercial recognition for

their debut album, Bread and
Circus.
With the release of their second
album, Pale, Toad the Wet
Sprocket shows just how far they
have come.
Pale spotlights the band's mu
sical diversity, through the suc
cessful use of violins, accordions,
and mandolins. Toad is equally
strong with their vocals. Todd Nic
hols makes an impressive debut
on lead vocals in"I Think About"
and "Nothing Is Alone." Glen Phil
lips shows surprising range for a
nineteen-year-old. Phillips encour
ages his listeners to extract their
own personal meaning from
Toad's music.
In "Come Back Down," Toad

Pale

incisively depicts the struggle of a
drug addict caught in an endless
cycle: I've quit this a million
times/Can't quite stay away/fust
one more time . . . /I'll be ok. The
melodic solo line, along with
haunting back-up vocals, creates a
portrait of emotions experienced
on another mediocre trip.
The beautiful, compelling "Liars
Everywhere" is a simple song
which seeks individualism without
undue influence by others. Don't
listen now/There are liars every
where. The song is Toad's most
subtle display of their musical

growth and abilities.
Toad the Wet Sprocket is often
inaccuratcly compared to R.E.M.
Perhaps the band docs resemble
R.E.M. in its potential to slowly
build-up to a prominent place
within America's upper echelon of
rock music. However, Pale reveals
a distinctive charm of passionate
music that deserves its own merit.
People waited seven years to
jump on the R.E.M. bandwagon,
but its true fans were aware of
R.E.M.'s talent from the start.
With Pale lies the opportunity to
become attached to a promising
group in its early days. Toad the
Wet Sprocket is an intriguing group
with outstanding, genuine music.
Now is the time to beat the crowd.
