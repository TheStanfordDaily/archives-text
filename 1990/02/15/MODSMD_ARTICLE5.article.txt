# Making the big bucks?
## High-paying jobs may be glamorous, but hashers make more per hour 
### Chris Roblyer 
Generic jobs such as hasher,
office assistant and library clerk
have long been viewed as an easy
way for students to make a quick
buck. But for those willing to
work more hours — and earn
less per hour — a much wider
array of jobs exists on campus.
Wages for traditional jobs un
der the Financial Aids Office's
work-study program range from
$6.32 to $9 an hour. Less con
ventional jobs may prove more
stimulating, but they rarely pro
vide greater financial rewards.
Interest, not money, is stu
dents' main attraction to these
jobs.
Moreover, many of the less
conventional jobs on campus are
often task-oriented rather than
time-oriented. "Although the
salaries of the people who head
up SURE (Escort Service) may
sound good, they aren't that
great considering the time we
put into it," said Todd White,
one of the two directors of
SURE.
Although salaries for many
student positions are not neces
sarily outstanding, the jobs
nevertheless provide a wide ar
ray of employment opportuni
ties. Many people associate the

ASSU with elected positions, but
most available jobs are open to
anyone. The salaries range from
about $200 to more than $4,000
per quarter.
The administrative branch of
the ASSU is comprised of about
a dozen major salaried positions.
Chief among these are the fi
nancial manager, the senate
chair, the administrative mana
ger and the four members of the
Council of Presidents. The
salaries of these positions range
from $1,500 to more than $4,000
per quarter.
While the COP and senate
chair positions both are deter
mined through elections, the
rest of the administrative posi
tions are open to any 3tudent
through an application process
that takes place during winter
quarter. Other support positions
pay anywhere from $360 to $750
per quarter.
"A mcyor time commitment is
necessary in any of these posi
tions," said Sandra Leal, the cur
rent financial manager. "I know
the salaries sound good, but it
takes a lot of work to run the
ASSU."
She noted that people often
do not see the money tney earn.

Annual earnings
Above are the annual salaries for selected campus jobs. Resident assistants
returning for a second year earn $200 more than the listed amount. The listed
salary for the editor in chief of The Daily Includes summer earnings. Though the
total earnings for some of the positions may be impressive, the hourly salaries
for many of these jobe are leaa than the Unlvereity base rate of $6.32 an hour.
But most of the Jobs are task-oriented rather than time-oriented, and students
may find them more Interesting than haahlng or working In University libraries.
