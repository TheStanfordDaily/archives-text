# Making the big bucks?
## High-paying jobs may be glamorous, but hashers make more per hour 
### Chris Roblyer 
Generic jobs such as hasher,
office assistant and library clerk
have long been viewed as an easy
way for students to make a quick
buck. But for those willing to
work more hours — and earn
less per hour — a much wider
array of jobs exists on campus.
Wages for traditional jobs un
der the Financial Aids Office's
work-study program range from
$6.32 to $9 an hour. Less con
ventional jobs may prove more
stimulating, but they rarely pro
vide greater financial rewards.
Interest, not money, is stu
dents' main attraction to these
jobs.
Moreover, many of the less
conventional jobs on campus are
often task-oriented rather than
time-oriented. "Although the
salaries of the people who head
up SURE (Escort Service) may
sound good, they aren't that
great considering the time we
put into it," said Todd White,
one of the two directors of
SURE.
Although salaries for many
student positions are not neces
sarily outstanding, the jobs
nevertheless provide a wide ar
ray of employment opportuni
ties. Many people associate the

ASSU with elected positions, but
most available jobs are open to
anyone. The salaries range from
about $200 to more than $4,000
per quarter.
The administrative branch of
the ASSU is comprised of about
a dozen major salaried positions.
Chief among these are the fi
nancial manager, the senate
chair, the administrative mana
ger and the four members of the
Council of Presidents. The
salaries of these positions range
from $1,500 to more than $4,000
per quarter.
While the COP and senate
chair positions both are deter
mined through elections, the
rest of the administrative posi
tions are open to any 3tudent
through an application process
that takes place during winter
quarter. Other support positions
pay anywhere from $360 to $750
per quarter.
"A mcyor time commitment is
necessary in any of these posi
tions," said Sandra Leal, the cur
rent financial manager. "I know
the salaries sound good, but it
takes a lot of work to run the
ASSU."
She noted that people often
do not see the money tney earn.

Annual earnings
Above are the annual salaries for selected campus jobs. Resident assistants
returning for a second year earn $200 more than the listed amount. The listed
salary for the editor in chief of The Daily Includes summer earnings. Though the
total earnings for some of the positions may be impressive, the hourly salaries
for many of these jobe are leaa than the Unlvereity base rate of $6.32 an hour.
But most of the Jobs are task-oriented rather than time-oriented, and students
may find them more Interesting than haahlng or working In University libraries.
For many students on financial
aid, the money made from these
positions can be deferred as a tax
free contribution toward their tui
tion.
Apart from its general admin
istration, the ASSU runs several
independent projects, including
the linen service, Sunday Flicks,
Lecture Notes, the T-shirt shop,
the Ad Agency and dry cleaning.
In order to boost incentives, the
ASSU pays the directors of these
projects largely on a commission
basis.
Because some of these projects
do not generate much profit, a
base salary of approximately
$1,600 per year is given to the
directors as well.
Although the ASSU provides a
wide array of jobs, it's only the
tip of the iceberg for campus em
ployment opportunities.

Noah Fogelson and Jack
Moriarity, the two managers of
KZSU, each get paid $2,046.
SURE Escort Service is also
managed by two student directors
who receive $2,250 each for hiring
escorts, scheduling, organizing
publicity and serving as liaisons
to the University administration.
One of the most popular and
competitive student positions on
campus is that of resident assis
tant. The application process for
RAs takes place during the spring.
First-time RAs are paid 79 percent
of the average room and board
costs; this year, the salary is
$4,250. Returning RAs get a $200
bonus.
Student publications provide
yet another opportunity for em
ployment as well as journalistic
experience.
Although much of the work put
into the Student Directory takes
place over the summer, those stu
dents who take part in the pub
lication can earn lucrative
salaries. The editors, business

manager and project manager
each get paid an hourly wage of
$7 to $8.
At the end of the project, these
positions receive a bonus of ap
proximately $2,000. The advertis
ing representatives for the
directory can earn almost as
much.
The Daily also provides wages
to all staff members. First-time
contributors to The Daily can
make $10 for each story they
write, and raises come with pro
motions to staff writer and senior
staff writer. The editorial staff of
The Daily is comprised of approx
imately 50 students annually.
They earn a combined total of
$65,000 for the year.
Positions on the advertising and
sales staff can prove even more
lucrative, with a staff of 15 earn
ing a total of $94,000. The adver
tising staff gets paid on a
commission of 8 percent for ads
placed by regular customers and
15 percent for ads placed by new
customers.

of the average room and board
costs; this year, the salary is
$4,250. Returning RAs get a $200
bonus.
Student publications provide
yet another opportunity for em
ployment as well as journalistic
experience.
Although much of the work put
into the Student Directory takes
place over the summer, those stu
dents who take part in the pub
lication can earn lucrative
salaries. The editors, business

manager and project manager
each get paid an hourly wage of
$7 to $8.
At the end of the project, these
positions receive a bonus of ap
proximately $2,000. The advertis
ing representatives for the
directory can earn almost as
much.
The Daily also provides wages
to all staff members. First-time
contributors to The Daily can
make $10 for each story they
write, and raises come with pro
motions to staff writer and senior
staff writer. The editorial staff of
The Daily is comprised of approx
imately 50 students annually.
They earn a combined total of
$65,000 for the year.
Positions on the advertising and
sales staff can prove even more
lucrative, with a staff of 15 earn
ing a total of $94,000. The adver
tising staff gets paid on a
commission of 8 percent for ads
placed by regular customers and
15 percent for ads placed by new
customers.
Generic jobs such as hasher,
office assistant and library clerk
have long been viewed as an easy
way for students to make a quick
buck. But for those willing to
work more hours — and earn
less per hour — a much wider
array of jobs exists on campus.
Wages for traditional jobs un
der the Financial Aids Office's
work-study program range from
$6.32 to $9 an hour. Less con
ventional jobs may prove more
stimulating, but they rarely pro
vide greater financial rewards.
Interest, not money, is stu
dents' main attraction to these
jobs.
Moreover, many of the less
conventional jobs on campus are
often task-oriented rather than
time-oriented. "Although the
salaries of the people who head
up SURE (Escort Service) may
sound good, they aren't that
great considering the time we
put into it," said Todd White,
one of the two directors of
SURE.
Although salaries for many
student positions are not neces
sarily outstanding, the jobs
nevertheless provide a wide ar
ray of employment opportuni
ties. Many people associate the

ASSU with elected positions, but
most available jobs are open to
anyone. The salaries range from
about $200 to more than $4,000
per quarter.
The administrative branch of
the ASSU is comprised of about
a dozen major salaried positions.
Chief among these are the fi
nancial manager, the senate
chair, the administrative mana
ger and the four members of the
Council of Presidents. The
salaries of these positions range
from $1,500 to more than $4,000
per quarter.
While the COP and senate
chair positions both are deter
mined through elections, the
rest of the administrative posi
tions are open to any 3tudent
through an application process
that takes place during winter
quarter. Other support positions
pay anywhere from $360 to $750
per quarter.
"A mcyor time commitment is
necessary in any of these posi
tions," said Sandra Leal, the cur
rent financial manager. "I know
the salaries sound good, but it
takes a lot of work to run the
ASSU."
She noted that people often
do not see the money tney earn.

Annual earnings
Above are the annual salaries for selected campus jobs. Resident assistants
returning for a second year earn $200 more than the listed amount. The listed
salary for the editor in chief of The Daily Includes summer earnings. Though the
total earnings for some of the positions may be impressive, the hourly salaries
for many of these jobe are leaa than the Unlvereity base rate of $6.32 an hour.
But most of the Jobs are task-oriented rather than time-oriented, and students
may find them more Interesting than haahlng or working In University libraries.
For many students on financial
aid, the money made from these
positions can be deferred as a tax
free contribution toward their tui
tion.
Apart from its general admin
istration, the ASSU runs several
independent projects, including
the linen service, Sunday Flicks,
Lecture Notes, the T-shirt shop,
the Ad Agency and dry cleaning.
In order to boost incentives, the
ASSU pays the directors of these
projects largely on a commission
basis.
Because some of these projects
do not generate much profit, a
base salary of approximately
$1,600 per year is given to the
directors as well.
Although the ASSU provides a
wide array of jobs, it's only the
tip of the iceberg for campus em
ployment opportunities.

Noah Fogelson and Jack
Moriarity, the two managers of
KZSU, each get paid $2,046.
SURE Escort Service is also
managed by two student directors
who receive $2,250 each for hiring
escorts, scheduling, organizing
publicity and serving as liaisons
to the University administration.
