# Low in profile, high on talent
## Stanford Chamber Chorale boasts a wealth of experience 
### Charan Devereaux 
Stanford singers can be heard at
events all around campus in a va
riety of different singing groups.
Several of these groups are "com
mon dormitory names," with large
followings and widespread
popularity.
But for the Stanford Chamber
Chorale, a relatively low profile is
definitely not a reflection of the
group's talent.
The Chorale is the most selec
tive group in the music depart
ment. A chamber choir of 33
voices, the group includes fresh
men as well as post-doctoral fel
lows. And in the past few years,
the group has been honored by
other composers, who have written
works specifically for the en
semble.
Past travels of the Chorale have
taken it far away from the Stanford
campus. During its 1985-86 tour
of Europe, the choir performed in
live concerts heard by over 40,000
people. Including television and

radio audiences, the Chorale has
been heard by over 60 million
people.
The Chorale was the only choir
invited to participate in the celebra
tion of the 600 th anniversary of
the University of Heidelberg in
Germany, and one Christmas Eve,
it performed with the Berlin Sym
phony in Bethlehem.
Music Prof. William Ramsey, di
rector of the Chorale, also boasts
a well-traveled past. Ramsey has
appeared as a soloist at Carnegie
Hall, Town Hall, and Lincoln Cen
ter in New York. In addition to
teaching at Stanford, Ramsey is
active as a choral and operatic per
former, as well as a guest conduc
tor.
Currently, many Chorale mem
bers themselves serve as conduc
tors for their ensemble. These
"guest conductors" include music
directors of Fleet Street, Counter
point and the Glee Club, as well
as orchestral and vocal conductors
of Ram's Head productions. Mem
bers have gone on to direct Bay

Including media ap
pearances, the Chorale
has been heard by over
60 million people.

Area churches, theaters and opera
houses.
One Chorale singer, graduate
student Alexander Tkaczevski, has
arranged and composed music
himself and won the 1986 Hartford
Symphony Orchestra Composer's
Competition.
The Chorale prides itself in pro
viding Stanford and surrounding
communities with a cultural
music experience. Senior Andrew
Arrow describes the music as "ac
cessible, unlike some stuffy high
brow music."

The Chorale's next concert ap
pearance is March 6 in Annenberg
Auditorium.
