# Health-Mex proves a bland concept

Cannibalism lives in Northern
California. I had just taken a seat
in Rooh's Cafe Salsa in Los Altos,
part of a new chain of "healthy"
Mexican restaurants. The "Miami
Vice" decor and background yuppie
music did little for an authentic
atmosphere, but I was hungry,
willing to forgive.
Then I saw it. I'll forever Rooh
the day I opened that menu. For
there, listed among the enchiladas,
burritos, and fajitas were . . . KIDS.
I read the first selection, "KIDS
finger burrito . . . 1.75," and could
go no further. Visions of Upton
Sinclair's "The Jungle" over
whelmed me.
Rooh's Cafe Salsa gives a new
twist on the Mexican theme by
providing, yes, healthy Mexican

Mexican

food. To hell with oxymorons. No
lard, no cholesterol, no frying, no
preservatives, and, unsurprisingly,
no taste. Health is the name of
the game here — half the entrees
are vegetarian — so expect some
sacrifices in the flavor range.
Most of the traditional Mexican
fare is available (including drinks,
but no tamales or hard-shell tacos),
along with some specials. Passing
on the Kids Finger, I tried a Rooh's
original, "Rolitos," enchiladas with
cheese instead of sauce topping.
My companion had the "Beef Pan
cake Pizza" — enchiladas stacked
instead of rolled next to each other.
Mexican food was invented to
clog arteries and shorten life spans,

so the taste of this stuff was bound
to be different, and it was. The
leaner, tamer taste takes some get
ting used to, but I managed to
make the adjustment; my com
panion, however, was less success
ful.
Prices seem reasonable (all
entrees are under $6), but this is
just a clever Rooh's. Servings are
smaller than average, and the
prices do not include normally
complimentary chips, rice, or
beans. However, the service is fast,
almost suspiciously so.
So if you crave pseudo-Mexican,
but actually care about your body,
Rooh's may be worth a visit; for
the rest of us, there's always
Pedro's. If you do go, though, ask
about the KIDS soft drink for me:
Do they at least debone the poor
child before he hits the blender?
