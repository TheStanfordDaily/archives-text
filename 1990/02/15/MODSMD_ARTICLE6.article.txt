# McBride places Stanford safety on front burner
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Thomas Mcßride, the new director of Environ
mental Health and Safety, is devoting himself to
the mission of giving Stanford "the best health and
safety program in the country, without breaking
the bank."
Mcßride has directed the Peace Corps in Latin
America, prosecuted Nixon's campaign contributors
in the Watergate scandal and investigated fraud and
abuse for the Departments of Agriculture and Labor,
with no career plan other than a desire to be "on
the front burner" working on the social issues of
the day.
His philosophy has always been: "Do a good job
in the job you have and the opportunities will seek
you out." In retrospect, the chain of opportunities
that led Mcßride to Health and Safety are indeed
linked by his former job experiences.
After graduating from Columbia Law School in
1956, Mcßride worked in New York for 10 years as
a prosecuting attorney.
But eventually, the "Roman gladiatorial combat"
of trial law burned him out. Mcßride wanted to
have more time for his family. And he wanted to
do "something dramatically different."
So Mcßride joined the Peace Corps in 1965 —
and brought his wife and two sons along
Public service really is a family affair for Mcßride.
His wife, Catherine Milton, is director of the Haas
Center for Public Service.
Mcßride became deputy director for all of the
Peace Corps in Latin America,
and it was in this capacity that
he first developed the leadership
skills he employs as head of
Health and Safety
Mcßride believes the role of a
leader is "to motivate people and
give them a sense of mission."
And the Peace Corps "is an or
ganization that lives and breathes
motivation. .. . (The conditions
of) extreme hardship require in
dividual and group leadership," he
said.
After three years in the Peace
Corps, Mcßride decided to explore
what lawyers could do in public
service in the United States. He
moved to the nation's capital to
work on the problem of police mis
handling incidents of racial un
rest.
Being in the right place at the
right time — Washington, D.C. in
the early 1970s — and having the
right credentials as a prosecuting
attorney yielded another opportu
nity for Mcßride: the directorship
of the Watergate Campaign Con

tributions Task Force.
"I feel government's first re
sponsibility is to be honest," he
said.
Mcßride prosecuted dozens of
people and corporations for
making illegal campaign contribu
tions, including New York
Yankees baseball team owner
George Steinbrenner and petro
leum millionaire Armand Ham
mer.
Later, Mcßride further in
creased his reputation as a gov
ernment troubleshooter, another
skill he brings to Health and
Safety He served as inspector gen
eral for both the Department of
Agriculture under President
Carter and the Department of
Labor under President Reagan.
After these experiences,
Mcßride redirected his energies
again, this time to education.
As an associate dean at the Law
School, his diverse experience
served him well. According to As
soc. Law School Dean Frank Bur
cata, who worked as the school's
financial manager when Mcßride
was there, "He was great to work
for. ... If you had a question, he
had a contact in Washington."
Citing the adage "the best way

to learn is to teach," Mcßride said
he cultivated his interests in sci
ence and public policy by design
ing and teaching an
undergraduate course called
"Legal and Political Perspectives
in Biology and Technology." He
believed there was a lack of op
portunities for undergraduate
students to get involved in public
policy issues.
Since he arrived at Stanford,
Mcßride has enjoyed seeing op
portunites in public service at
Stanford grow, particularly
because the public service center
is under the direction of his wife.
A new opportunity opened for
Mcßride when Carol Hoerner,
former director of Health and
Safety, resigned in October.
Mcßride became the new director
last month.
Mcßride does not have any fu
ture career plans. He is devoting
his full energies to minimizing
health and safety risks at Stan
ford for the next two or three
years at least, he said.
In terms of current social issues
that are attracting his attention,
Mcßride says he was inspired by
this year's "You Can Make a Dif
ference" conference on education.

a prosecuting attorney.
But eventually, the "Roman gladiatorial combat"
of trial law burned him out. Mcßride wanted to
have more time for his family. And he wanted to
do "something dramatically different."
So Mcßride joined the Peace Corps in 1965 —
and brought his wife and two sons along
Public service really is a family affair for Mcßride.
His wife, Catherine Milton, is director of the Haas
Center for Public Service.
Mcßride became deputy director for all of the
Peace Corps in Latin America,
and it was in this capacity that
he first developed the leadership
skills he employs as head of
Health and Safety
Mcßride believes the role of a
leader is "to motivate people and
give them a sense of mission."
And the Peace Corps "is an or
ganization that lives and breathes
motivation. .. . (The conditions
of) extreme hardship require in
dividual and group leadership," he
said.
After three years in the Peace
Corps, Mcßride decided to explore
what lawyers could do in public
service in the United States. He
moved to the nation's capital to
work on the problem of police mis
handling incidents of racial un
rest.
Being in the right place at the
right time — Washington, D.C. in
the early 1970s — and having the
right credentials as a prosecuting
attorney yielded another opportu
nity for Mcßride: the directorship
of the Watergate Campaign Con

tributions Task Force.
"I feel government's first re
sponsibility is to be honest," he
said.
Mcßride prosecuted dozens of
people and corporations for
making illegal campaign contribu
tions, including New York
Yankees baseball team owner
George Steinbrenner and petro
leum millionaire Armand Ham
mer.
Later, Mcßride further in
creased his reputation as a gov
ernment troubleshooter, another
skill he brings to Health and
Safety He served as inspector gen
eral for both the Department of
Agriculture under President
Carter and the Department of
Labor under President Reagan.
After these experiences,
Mcßride redirected his energies
again, this time to education.
As an associate dean at the Law
School, his diverse experience
served him well. According to As
soc. Law School Dean Frank Bur
cata, who worked as the school's
financial manager when Mcßride
was there, "He was great to work
for. ... If you had a question, he
had a contact in Washington."
Citing the adage "the best way

to learn is to teach," Mcßride said
he cultivated his interests in sci
ence and public policy by design
ing and teaching an
undergraduate course called
"Legal and Political Perspectives
in Biology and Technology." He
believed there was a lack of op
portunities for undergraduate
students to get involved in public
policy issues.
Since he arrived at Stanford,
Mcßride has enjoyed seeing op
portunites in public service at
Stanford grow, particularly
because the public service center
is under the direction of his wife.
A new opportunity opened for
Mcßride when Carol Hoerner,
former director of Health and
Safety, resigned in October.
Mcßride became the new director
last month.
Mcßride does not have any fu
ture career plans. He is devoting
his full energies to minimizing
health and safety risks at Stan
ford for the next two or three
years at least, he said.
In terms of current social issues
that are attracting his attention,
Mcßride says he was inspired by
this year's "You Can Make a Dif
ference" conference on education.
