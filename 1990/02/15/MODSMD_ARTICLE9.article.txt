# Bush budget won't ease pain

Facing University budget
woes and high overhead costs,
most University researchers
would appreciate extra funding
from the government. How
ever, President Bush's
seemingly promising 1991
budget proposals for science
and technology offer little to
the majority of Stanford scien
tists.
"The president's budget looks
good, but what Congress may
do with it is another story. The
small research scientist proba
bly won't fare well," said Dean
of Research Robert Byer.
The relatively generous
funding recommendations for
some science areas may well
prove ephemeral. For example,
the proposed 14 percent in
crease in the National Science
Foundation's budget could
easily fall to 8 percent by the
time Congress finishes the long
budget approval process, Byer
said.
Grants and contracts from
the foundation furnished $25
million of Stanford's $368 mil
lion in total research expendi
tures in fiscal year 1989,
according to Stanford's Spon
sored Projects report of expen
ditures.
Of the significant increases
remaining after Congress com
pletes its budget revisions, rela
tively few will benefit
University laboratories. In
stead, great portions of the
budget will finance nationwide
educational improvements, sci
ence and technology center con
struction and "new science"
projects â€” all essentially unre
lated to Stanford.
While Bush proposed hearty
increases for some Department
of Energy programs, Michael
Riordan, an information officer
at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, said SLAC,
supported by the Energy
Department, is unlikely to fare
particularly well in the budget
deliberations.
Byer explained that potential

benefits for SLAC will only
slightly counterbalance the
cuts made in last year's $127
million budget. The Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Lab at
SLAC may, however, garner ad
ditional federal support.
For Stanford-based medical
research, Bush's proposal to in
crease the National Institute
of Health's budget by 3.7 per
cent, excluding funds for AIDS
and human genome mapping
research, is "not bad, but way
below what is needed to main
tain the current services
budget, which does not include
new programs," said David
Korn, vice president and dean
of the School of Medicine.
At worst, insufficient fund
ing could cause significant fi
nancial reductions in
individual medical research
grants, cutting existing grants
by 4 to 6 percent and future
grants by as much as 20 per
cent, said Korn.
A possible bright spot for
Stanford involves Bush's pro
posed 57 percent funding
increase in global-change re
search areas such as ozone
depletion and global warming.
The Energy Department, which
provided $25.4 million for
Stanford research expenditures
(excluding SLAC) in 1989, has
earmarked specific funds for
solar energy work.
The proposed increases in
solar energy funding are long
overdue, according to Assoc.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Richard Swanson, whose
research focuses on photovol
taic cells. "During the Reagan
administration, nuclear re
search got considerable sup
port, and solar research did
not," he said.
Because Swanson's own re
search has maintained a
healthy level of funding, the
budget changes should not af
fect his work significantly.
However, he said the increases
would give a needed boost to
the private solar cell industry,
which has been "hanging on by
its fingernails."
