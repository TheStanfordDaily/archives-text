CANCER.
IT'S SIMPLY
NOT WHAT
IT USED
TO BE.
Over the last 40
years, research pro
grams supported by
the American Cancer
Society have made
increasing progress in
the treatment, detec
tion and prevention
ofcancer.
In 1986 alone, the
Society funded over
700 projects con
ducted by the most
distinguished scien
tists and research
institutions in the
country.
Which is why, this
year, hundreds of
thousands of people
will be successfully
treated for the
disease.
We are winning.
But we need you to
help keep it that way.
