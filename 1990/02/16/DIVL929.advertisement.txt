SOME TEST PILOTS
NEVER LEAVE THE GROUND
Test pilots. It's kind of how we see our
selves when we're field testing the new arrivals
from the big guvs, like Nike, Avia, Asics.
That's what we were doing, soaked to the
- 11 bone, on Mt. Tam that day.
It's not that the manu
athletes that are definitely out of our league. Or
that we doubted the spec sheets. Or disagreed
with the reviews. It's just that we can't look vou
in the eye and tell you this one can support your
arch or that one might save your knees, without
firsthand experience. So we've got this policy. We
won't recommend anything to our customers we
haven't tried ourselves. Which means, when you
push your body to its limits with equipment from
Fleet Feet, you won't be taking chances.
You'll be out there with the right stuff.
