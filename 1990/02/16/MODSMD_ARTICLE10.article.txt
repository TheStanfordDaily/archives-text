### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
The United States should strive
to provide excellent health care to
all citizens, nationally renowned
Jesuit priest and biomedical eth
icist Dr. John Golenski said Wed
nesday at Stanford.
At the opening of the Stanford
Center for Biomedical Ethics,
Golenski addressed a packed Fair
child Auditorium on "The Crisis
in American Health Care: Is
Rationing Necessary?"
He said the United States is
currently practicing a form of
rationing, "by access, by social
class . . . without much fore
thought," giving better medical
benefits to the wealthy. He cited
the state of Oregon as an example
of ideal health care: "all patients
treated in similar fashion, with
universal access to a basic set of
services."
Golenski outlined the health
plan which he helped the Oregon
Legislature develop. The plan
ranks a set of essential health care

services and assigns costs to these
services on a per capita basis. The
state then allocates funds to the
program to make eligible citizens
whose incomes are below the
poverty level and people who were
previously uninsurable because of
prior illness, Golenski said.
The program also mandates all
Oregon employers to provide
health insurance to their employ
ees, he added. Health services are
ranked according to their capacity
to promote longevity and higher
quality of life, Golenski said.
At present, transplants are the
only procedures made unavailable
in Oregon by cost-benefit analysis,
which Golenski disagrees with
"vehemently" because few people
need the treatment, making it
relatively cheap in the total
budget.
Golenski attributed the need for
rationing health care to the
Reagan administration, which
took office "under the assumption
of not increasing taxes and main
taining defense spending levels."
