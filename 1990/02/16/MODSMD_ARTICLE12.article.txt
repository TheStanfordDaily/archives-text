Britain restores relationship

in English by Sir Crispin Tickell, British am

Latvia condemns declaration
MOSCOW (AP) — The Latvian parliament
yesterday condemned the 1940 declaration that
made the Baltic republic part of the Soviet
Union, Tass reported.
The parliament, or Supreme Soviet, said the
declaration was taken without making clear
the will of the people and led to loss of Latvia's
independence.
The vote was 177-40, with 33 deputies
abstaining or absent, said Valdis Birzens of
the Latvian Popular Front newspaper Atmoda.
The parliament also voted to restore the
red-and-white flag and the national anthem
of independent Latvia, Birzens said. The in
dependence flag replaces one with the Com
munist hammer and sickle emblem.
Bush approach to media
BARRANQUILLA, Colombia (AP) - Pres
ident Bush complained testily yesterday about
news accounts which he said portrayed him
as deceptive, declaring he would hold fewer
news conferences and initiate a "new ap
proach" toward reporters.
"From now on, it's going to be a little dif
ferent. ... So we've got a new relationship,"
Bush told reporters traveling with him aboard
Air Force One to the four-nation Colombia
drug summit.
"It will be pleasant. It will be fun. But it's
different," said the president, who has averaged
one question and answer session with
reporters each week since taking office 13
months ago.
