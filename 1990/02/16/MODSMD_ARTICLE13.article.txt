## Bush attends Latin American drug summit 
### 
CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) —
President Bush and three Latin Amer
ican leaders, conducting drug-fighting
summitry under an unusally heavy
air, sea and land security cover, agreed
yesterday on a coordinated attack
against cocaine producers and mur
derous traffickers.
Flanked by the leaders of the three
largest cocaine-producing nations,
Bush pledged after the talks to step
up attempts to curtail the demand for
narcotics at home and to help combat
drug-running abroad.
But in a joint communique, the four
leaders apparently ruled out the use
of U.S. military forces in the Andean
region. "Each country may involve its
armed forces in this fight within its
own national territory," it said.
Extraordinary security precautions
were taken to protect Bush and his
three summit partners, with some
5,000 uniformed troops watching over
the proceedings. Battleships presented
an imposing force off shore and
helicopter gunships hovered nearby.
But Colombian guerrillas made their
own point, one of defiance. They kid
napped an American priest in Cali,
the third U.S. citizen taken prisoner
by rebels this week. Also, a small bomb
exploded yesterday morning, 4V2 miles
from Barranquila Airport, damaging
a voltage regulator of a line that fed
the air conditioning of the airport
where Bush landed two hours later.
Summing up his talks with the Latin
American presidents, Bush told
reporters, "I owe it to the children of
America, the United States,... to these
three presidents, to guarantee them
that we will do everything we can to
cut ... the demand for narcotics in the
United States."
That was a message that had been
awaited by the three — Presidents Vir
gilio Barco of Colombia, Jaime Paz
Zamora of Bolivia and Alan Garcia of
Peru, who came to the summit com
plaining that the United States had
not done enough at home to curtail
demand for drugs.
Zamora, with a nod to the sweeping
reforms that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev had introduced to his part
of the world, said a new openness had
been attained here. "A perestroika has
begun," he told reporters at a wind-up
news conference.
Zamora said the leaders had talked
about creating an "alternate economy"
so the peasants of the coca-growing
and processing nations would not be

dependent on the crop for their
livelihoods.
After the meetings, he said, "We
understand the true magnitude of the
problem and how to face it."
Barco said, "No," when asked if
Colombia would be willing to have U.S.
naval forces patrolling in international
waters off Colombia's coast to keep
track of drug shipments. "It is not
necessary," he said.

Said Garcia: "What has changed
here is concepts, so that we never go
back — a better relationship between
Latin America and the United States."
Responding to Colombian com
plaints that U.S. trade policy has
harmed its major legal exports such
as coffee, cut flowers and sugar, Bush
promised to work to help open more
U.S. markets.
In their communique, the summit

nations called for a "world conference
against illicit drug trafficking in 1991."
The four nations agreed to hold a high
level followup to yesterday's session
witnin six months, but specified no
level of U.S. aid to help the South
Americans.
Bush previously had pledged $2.2
billion over five years to aid the An
dean xuiini r i*fi> d
militarily in waging $|je drug war.''
