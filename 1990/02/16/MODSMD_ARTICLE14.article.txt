Afghan aid suspended
WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. food
aid to the Afghan rebels has been
suspended for the second time in
three months because some of the
assistance has been stolen, the State
Department said yesterday.
Deputy spokesman Richard Bouc
her said he expects that new arrange
ments for monitoring the assistance
mil be in place soon and that the
suspension will be brief.
Food shipments representing about
30 percent of total U.S. humanitarian
aid to the rebels were suspended in
late November because of difficulty
in meeting government monitoring
reqirements, he said.
Quayle sings new tune
WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice Pres
ident Dan Quayle, often the voice of

skepticism within the White House
toward the Soviet Union, said yes
terday he has changed his opinion
about the communist state.
"I would say anybody that has not
changed their mind over the last six
or seven months is not thinking cor
rectly," he said of the fast-changing
reforms that Mikhail S. Gorbachev
has ushered in in Moscow.
"Of course you change your opin
ion," Quayle said after a reporter
asked if he remained suspicious of
Gorbachev's intentions.
Reagan testimony closed
WASHINGTON (AP) - The press
and public will be barred from at
tending former President Reagan's
videotaped Iran-Contra testimony
Friday in Los Angeles, a federal judge
ruled yesterday. An edited version
will be released later, he said.

Reagan is to be questioned in con
nection with the trial of former Na
tional Security Adviser John Poin
dexter, who contends the former pres
ident authorized his activities in the
affair.
U.S. District Court Judge Harold
Greene said he would "order the re
lease of the tape" within a few days,
after editing to remove material
deemed to touch on classified mat
ters.
In a separate development yester
day, the Bush administration joined
Reagan in asserting executive
privilege supporting his attempt to
avoid turning over some 33 diary
excerpts to Poindexter.
A drop in the bucket
WASHINGTON (AP) - Dramatic
cuts in the size of U.S. fighting
forces, phased in over the next five

years, would do little to help budget
writers shrink next year's federal def
icit, congressional analysts say.
The Congressional Budget Office
said in its annual overview of poten
tial spending cuts and tax increases
Wednesday that cutting troop
strength by one quarter by 1995
would save just $510 million next
year from the Bush administration's
plans.
Oil imports surge
WASHINGTON (AP) - Imports
accounted for an all-time high of 54
percent of the nation's petroleum con
sumption last month, the American
Petroleum Institute said yesterday.
Although the record-high level was
spurred in part by a hitter cold snap
across much of the nation in Decem
ber that increased demand for
heating fuel.
