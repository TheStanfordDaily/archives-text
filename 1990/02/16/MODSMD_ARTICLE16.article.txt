Athletics Department
must provide answers
about harmful rumors

IT'S TIME FOR some straight
answers.
For more than a week,
rumors have been flying about pro
gram cutbacks in the Department
of Athletics due to a projected $1
million budget deficit.
First, the community learned
that the women's field hockey team
will be dropped from a varsity to
a club sport next year. Then it
learned that 25 full scholarships
will be cut from the track and field
program, leaving only five track
scholarships for incoming fresh
men each year.
The community can only be left
wondering: what's next?
But perhaps as disturbing as the
cuts themselves is the way in which
they have been announced — or
admitted to.
Despite statements such as, "It
tears me up" and "We're doing our
damnedest," Athletic Director
Andy Geiger has yet to provide the
community with full disclosure of
what cuts are being planned.
Announcements of the cuts have
come, rather, through snippets of
information being leaked to the
press. Several Bay Area newspa
pers, including The Daily, have
picked up on parts of the story.
But the Athletics Department has
been unwilling to provide a com

plete, coherent explanation detail
ing exactly what cuts will be made.
Through this week, Geiger con
tinued to dodge questions on the
subject.
This method of dealing with the
issue is at best unreasonable and
at worst irresponsible. Further, it
must certainly be upsetting to
members of other teams, who are
left wondering if they're next.
Geiger's comments on why field
hockey was selected for cutbacks
are equally disturbing. He told The
Daily that the team was "going
nowhere" and that he would rather
spend money on more promising
programs.
Here's the message, athletes:
win, or lose your program.
The entire fiasco will lead only
to increased mistrust of the Ath
letics Department unless steps are
taken now to inform the commu
nity.
Stanford has the smallest stu
dent body and the largest number
of varsity teams in the Pacific 10
Conference, and managing a
budget for such an operation is
not simple. The budget problems
the Athletics Department faces are
serious, and resolving them may
require belt-tightening in many
programs.
But the Stanford community op
erates best on the principle of open
communication, be the news good
or bad. The Athletics Department's
handling of these budget cut an
nouncements has been a disap
pointing failure in this respect.
Andy Geiger needs to stop
dodging the issue and confront it
openly. And he needs to do it now.
