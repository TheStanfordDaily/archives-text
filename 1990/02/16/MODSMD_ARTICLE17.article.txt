Speaker will bring great historical legacy to campus

WE ARE WRITING to announce
the visit of Mrs. Rosa Parks to
the Stanford community this
coming weekend. Parks will be speak
ing on Monday, Feb. 19 at 3 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium during a pro
gram entitled, "Thank You, Sister Rosa
Parks." Most people remember Parks
as "the black woman who refused to
give up her seat on a bus to a white
man," but few know of the historic
implications of her actions and of her
other achievements.
Contrary to most accounts, Parks
was not a quiet, passive woman who
one day, "out of the blue," decided she
had had enough of Jim Crow segrega
tion; rather, she was a woman with a
long history of involvement in the
protest tradition, serving as the secre
tary of her local Montgomery National
Association for the Advancement of

Colored People and an organizer of the
NAACP Youth Council.
Dec. 1, 1955 was not the first day
Parks had refused to surrender her
seat and, in fact, the driver who had
her arrested was the same man who
had evicted her from another bus in
1943.
In response to Parks' arrest, black
activists and leaders in Montgomery
formed the Montgomery Improvement
Association, choosing as their leader,
the newly arrived and charismatic
young minister, Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. On Dec. 5, the association
launched a huge bus boycott to protest
the segregation laws of the Mont
gomery transist system. This boycott
was to become known as the Mont
gomery Bus Boycott, lasting 381 days
and thrusting King into national
prominence.

Since the days of the boycott, Parks
has continued her political activism
and commitment to her community.
After her arrest, she lost her job in
Montgomery and moved to Detroit,
where she worked for 25 years with
Congressman John Conj'ers. In Febru
ary 1987, Parks founded the Rosa and
Raymond Parks Institute for Self
Development. The purpose of the
institute is "to provide unique pro
grams to train future and present
leaders and to reach youth and young
adults not typically singled out for
special programs."
We are honored to bring Parks to
Stanford, since much of the Stanford
community is inspired by Parks'
achievements, courage and determina
tion. We thank the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, Undergraduate Studies, the
many Stanford residences that contrib-

uted and all of our other sponsors for
their support.
We are ecstatic that Parks' visit
could coincide with Black Liberation
Month and the other events com
memorating black history and achieve
ment; however, we wish to emphasize
that Parks is not only a distinguished
black American, but a distinguished
American. The political events of the
1950s and 1960s affect all of us,
whether or not we are conscious of it.
So, we invite you all to come to
Memorial Auditorium on Feb. 19 and
celebrate Rosa Parks, "the spark of the
Civil Rights Movement." We hope to
see you there.
