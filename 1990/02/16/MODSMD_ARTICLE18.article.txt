# Hockey to continue despite budget cuts
## 
### 
I was hurt, angered and insulted by
Athletic Director Andy Geiger's ap
praisal of the field hockey team quoted
in Monday's Daily. According to The
Daily, Geiger justified dropping the
program because it was "going
nowhere" and he would rather support
other "more promising teams." Is the
Stanford Department of Athletics fi
nally showing its true colors? The car
dinal and white seems to be turning
green.
The message I hear is that teams
are only valuable in so far as they
rank nationally and bring home NCAA
titles. Geiger is telling me that the
team I play on is not worth his green
unless we perform — unless we win.
So support is gauged by success. The

Athletics Department, however, argues
that certain teams cannot truly com
pete without the maximum scholarships
allowed, that essentially success hinges
on support. If this is true, collegiate
athletics is bound in a vicious circle at
the mercy of the athletic director who,
with the stroke of his budget pen, can
make or break a program.
But the hockey program did not
break in 1985 when the Athletics De
partment completely cut off our fund
ing.
The coaches volunteered, and the
team fought its way to the top of the
conference, competing in the NCAAs
for three years straight. In 1987, my
freshman year, we were ranked fifth in
the nation. With only minimal support
from the Athletics Department and no
more scholarships, the program sur
vived on fundraising.
Is that the history of a program
going nowhere?

Geiger said that he had no choice —
reductions had to be made to bail him
out of a $1.5 million deficit. Why did
he choose to cripple one promising
program by cutting 25 of their scholar
ships? Why cut a program that for
years has survived on the bare mini
mum? What about across the board
reductions? And how did we get into
this mess anyway?
Despite Geiger's executive decision
that we are not worth his support, we
will be competing with varsity status
next year.
We will complete our planned
schedule, and our NCAA opponents will
mark their games with us on their
season records. We know we are going
somewhere and we believe it is worth
the investment.
