# Additional lights increase pollution
## 
### 
I write in response to yesterday's
letter by the students of SWOPSI 173.
Although I support the intentions of
these students, I am alarmed by their
call for increased campus lighting. The
production of light in addition to being
costly is an often overlooked, though
serious, source of pollution.
Optical astronomy is perhaps the
most tragic victim of increased light.
The Stanford Student Observatory, the
Lick Observatory just to the south of
us, and optical observatories through
out the world are now severely limited
in the work they can do. Is it neces
sary for Stanford to achieve the
radiance of that obscene desert pariah,
Las Vegas?
