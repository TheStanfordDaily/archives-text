# 'Dead in the water'
## Dorm fund prohibition cut from alcohol plan 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
Facing widespread student opposition to
a proposed ban of alcohol purchases with
University-collected dorm funds, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons said yesterday
that he will drop the proposal.
"I think this one's dead in the water,"
Lyons said. "I haven't heard any support
for it, and I'm not interested in spending
any more time on it."
Lyons plans to continue pursuing the
other three proposed alcohol regulations,
which include a ban on alcohol in all athletic
facilities, an end to alcohol advertising at
athletic events and parking restrictions for
persons with drunk driving convictions.
"We've got three 'goes' here and one 'no
go,' " he said.
The four proposed regulations were
prompted by recent concerns about campus
alcohol abuse.
"The public commentary has made a lot
of decisions for us," Lyons said. He said
that individual letters, an ASSU alcohol
policy task force and residential staff dis
cussions have resulted in "a lot of consen
sus on these issues."
To gauge student opinion on controver
sial issues, the ASSU implemented its first-

ever dorm poll of more
than 1,100 students.
"I'm very glad we went
to the grass-roots level,"
said Solina Kwan, chair of
student affairs for the
ASSU Senate and one of
the principal authors of the
task force's statement. "It's
a good start, and I'm sure
we'll use this polling

method again and again."
The results of the poll were used by the
alcohol task force to compile recommenda
tions to Lyons. The poll showed overwhelm
ing opposition to the proposal on dorm
funds.
However, the ASSU task force chose to
support the proposed ban on alcohol ad
vertising at athletic events in spite of the
vast student opposition to this issue ex
pressed in the poll.
Kwan said that most students' concerns
centered on the loss of advertising revenues
for the Department of Athletics, but that
the task force's meetings with Athletic Di
rector Andy (Jeiger made it apparent that
there would be no such loss. The ASSU
determined that it was "not a student issue,


Lyons
but an issue for the Department
of Athletics," Kwan said.
Lyons plans to hold additional
discussions with Geiger on this
issue.
Another of the three remaining
regulations proposes an alcohol
ban at athletic events, which
would change the current policy
that allows one six-pack of beer
per person into Stanford Stadium.
A policy similar to the proposed
one has been implemented at base
ball games and has caused "no
great outcries," Lyons said. He
plans further discussions regard
ing student suggestions to sell al
cohol ofculrtiin.
The third proposal would
prohibit persons with drunk
driving convictions from receiving
campus parking permits. The

technical issues have yet to fo
worked out, Lyons said, althougl
it is clear that the ban would applj
to all members of the Stanford
community, including faculty anil
staff with such convictions. 1
couldn't support just a student
only rule," he said.
Lyons plans to continue review
ing the letters and suggestioni
given to him by students. "Then
are some good ideas in there," hi
said, and he plans to attack
several student letters to his final
proposal to University President
Donald Kennedy.
"I'm very glad to see an admin'
istrator take student opinions into
account," Kwan said. "He reallj
believes in his role in helping stu
dent affairs."
The three final alcohol regull
tion proposals will be submitta
to Kennedy by March 1. If ap
proved, these regulations wil
probably take effect next fall
Lyons said.
