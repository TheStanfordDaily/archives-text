## When money takes over

STANFORD University, Inc.
When Robert Beyers left the
Stanford News Service, the words
"Stanford" and "corporation" were tossed
about in the papers with a chilling prox
imity. The idea that Stanford is being
run more like a business and less like a
university is frightening.
Now, don't get me wrong — I know
we're running a deficit here and I know
that to some degree a university must
be a business. The problem is that we're
letting economics dominate and corrupt
us.
See, it used to be that Stanford didn't
care too much for image. We were creative
and unusual; we worked hard and we
played hard; we were smart and not stuf
fy. But somewhere along the line someone
saw an awful lot of eyes on us — and
we got vain.
We began confusing imag* with essence
— and now my university has all but
lost the very thing that brought me here:,
its attitude.
When I first visited in 1986, I couldn't
believe what I saw. "Here," I thought,
"is the place for me." What I saw was
"the best and the brightest" as they say,
in a place that gave me the distinct im
pression that alongside the serious aca
demics was some real energy. It was as
if someone had stolen the fun, imagina
tive people from the Ivy Leagues and put
them out on a peninsula where they
couldn't be corrupted by the gray stul
tifying fog of academic propriety.
But that is no longer the case. Today,
the watchword is prudence: don't take
risks, don't trust instinct, and for God's

sake don't make a mistake.
Like a fungus, caution has crept silently
into all facets of the University: The Of
fice of Residential Education has gone
from educating residents to indoctrinat
ing them; the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions is safer admitting one-track
wonders than it is accepting students
with a general intellectual curiosity and
a creative spark; and the Athletics De
partment gets paranoid if everything isn't
perfect at every sporting event.
We're working to perfect the no-fault
university.
The nice thing about a no-fault uni
versity is that it's safe. You avoid a lot
of controversy, corporations give you
money, and crotchety alumni don't whine
as loudly. On the other hand, attending
"no-fault U." may be likened to staying
at home all day watching Brady Bunch
reruns and eating" mayonnaise — 1 "lFs
boring as hell and after a while you get
sick of it.
But not enough of us have gotten sick.
Most of us are content to just let it be.
Does it seem like 10 percent of Stanford's
students are running 90 percent of
campus organizations? Does it seem like
the majority of students sit in their rooms
and study rather than participate in some
form of extracurricular activity? Does it
seem awfully quiet?
I've heard that Rice University in Texas
is trying hard to become what Stanford
once was. And I've heard it said that
we're becoming more and more like Har
vard — and that's sad.
I spent a high school summer at Har
vard and until I visited Stanford, that

was where I wanted to go to college)
Getting rejected from Harvard helped mj
decision a bit, but that's not the point
The point is that some people came hen
because they felt that studying was no'
in itself an undergraduate education
They sensed the value Stanford place*
on individuality. They knew that Stan fori
was something special; that it was un
conventional; that it was moving alonj
the road less travelled.
Well, we moved for a while, but latelj
I feel like we've stopped. I didn't comf
here to be treated like a junior executive
I came here to be a student.
Leave conservative planning am
buttoned-down conduct to the corporatf
world, Stanford, lest you really do devolvf
into Stanford University, Inc.
