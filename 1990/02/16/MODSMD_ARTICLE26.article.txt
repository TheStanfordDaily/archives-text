Dear Bug,
Why does it seem like The Dai
ly's columnists all sound alike?
They all seem to be pretty much
Constantly offended and irritated.
Is there any difference between the
columns I columnists or does one
person just write them all?
— The Doppelganger Watch
Ah, Doppelganger, I'm afraid
you've missed out — the careful
Daily columnist reader should be
able to discern at least half a
dozen distinct types of Daily
columns and columnists.
In fact, I believe I've pinpointed
at least a dozen "Different Kindsa
Daily Columnist" so far. While the
neighboring guide can be in
strumental in distinguishing be
tween the myriad of columnists
types, it is important to note that
this is not the definitive guide.
