## Stanford starts slow, ends strong to bury Trojans 
### Debbie Spander Editorial Staff 
With the toughest conference game
of the season behind them, the Cardinal
women returned to cruise control last
night. It was almost a little too soon.
It took Stanford 20 minutes of missed
shots, turnovers and bad passes to show
its national championship caliber form.
But after a half of battling the women
of Troy for control of the game, and of
concentrating on defense, the Cardinal
returned to its expected caliber of of
fensive play and could do no wrong.
The end result was a satsifying 86-60
victory over Southern California.

The team that moved up and down
the Maples hardwood the first twenty
minutes of play was not Stanford, at
least not on offense. After scoring the
first four points off two free throws
and a bank shot by Julie Zielstra, the
Cardinal did not score for the next five
minutes. Seven minutes into the contest
the squad trailed the Trojans 6-4 and
could not make a shot.
Their play on offense, however, did
not faze the Cardinal. After getting beat
by Washington last week on defense,
Coach Tara VanDerveer decided the
squad would concentrate only on de
fense, and offense would follow. While
it took an entire half for the strategy
to kick into effect, VanDerveer proved
prophetess.
"I've been talking about defense all
week long," she said. "Causing turn
overs and blocking the lanes is what I
wanted to emphasize. We're used to a
slower pace on defense and it put our
offense out of synch for a while. But it
was the best defensive effort I've seen
all year."
While the Cardinal was concentrating
on stopping USC under its basket and
forcing turnovers — it eventually caused
the Trojans to cough up the ball 22
times — it looked average on offense.

Numerous shots were just thrown at
the basket, rebounding was not a given
after missed shots, and passing was not
crisp.
It was hard to tell which squad was
earmarked for a Final 4 slot as the two
teams traded leads, and mistakes, the
entire first half. The Cardinal never
broke it open, holding a maximum edge
of five points and leading just 36-33 at
the half.
The slow offensive performance, how
ever, was penciled into Stanford's game
plan.
"I was not worried the first half be
cause of our defensive effort. It is going
to help us in the long run," VanDerveer
said.
Once the Cardinal hit the floor the
second half, however, there was no ques
tioning which team was gunning for
Tennessee. VanDerveer's hunch proved
correct: offense fell in place as well as
defense, and USC could only watch in
amazement.
Less than a minute into play Stanford
opened a 43-32 lead and never looked
back.
After shooting only .441 the first half,
the Cardinal hit almost 57 percent of
its shots, with center/forward Trisha
Stevens pouring in 16 alone on her

return trip to the court. The Stanford
women controlled all aspects of the
game, setting the pace, executing crisp
passing, scoring at will, and keeping the
Trojans off the scoreboard for minutes
at a time. The only question with 15
minutes of play remaining was how
many would the Cardinal put on the
board.
"The second half they made some
adjustments and really began to pound
the ball inside," Trojan Coach Mariar ie
Stanley said. "The thing that impressed
me the last time we played them was
how well Stanford executed. It was
really evident in the second half. They
put us away in the first three minutes."
Stevens led the Cardinal's offensive
attack with 21. Jennifer Azzi added 15
and nine rebounds, Zeilstra contributed
14 points and 10 boards, and Sonja Hen
ning put up another 12 points. Tammy
Hammond led the Trojans with 19.
According to VanDerveer, the Cardi
nal looked at last night's game as the
beginning of a new season: after the
loss to Washington. The Cardinal's
NCAA-focused theme? Intensity.
And according to Stanley, Stanford
has all the ingredients for going all the

with 21 points on the night.
