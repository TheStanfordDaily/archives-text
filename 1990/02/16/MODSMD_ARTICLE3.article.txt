# IFC may seek house for one of three unhoused fraternities
## 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Everyone talks about the shortage of
indergraduate housing at Stanford. Now
he Interfraternity Council is seeking to
urn talk into action.
The IFC is currently discussing the
jossibility of one of Stanford's unhoused
raternities getting housing, according to
IFC Vice President Erik Jorgensen. If the
Jniversity approves the housing, it would
)e a major policy shift, since no housing
jetitions have been accepted since 1982.
Jorgensen stressed that the idea is "in
he preliminary stages" and that the IFC
'hasn't worked out any strategy yet."
FC President Todd Ortega said he
referred not to comment on the plan.
At this point, however, the executive
committee of the IFC is determining
which unhoused fraternity might be in

terested in getting a house.
Sigma Nu, Alpha Epsilon Pi and Sigma
Phi Epsilon are "the main viable" con
tenders for a house, according to Dan
Nemo, president of Alpha Epsilon Pi.
David Reid, president of Sigma Phi Ep
silon, said that his fraternity is "con
sidering the issue right now" and that
it is "certainly possible" that the Sig Eps
are interested in getting a house. John
Hafer, president of Sigma Nu, could not
be reached for comment.
Jorgensen said that the idea of housing
a currently unhoused fraternity stems
from the University publication, "Regula
tions Governing the Operation of Frater
nities." The regulations state that a
fraternity that has had its house placed
in the Draw may have its house returned
to the fraternity system if the system as
a whole makes its quota the following
year, according to Jorgensen.

The fraternities did make their collec
tive quota last year, for the first time in
eight years, and Jorgensen said that
rather than returning a house which has
been taken from the fraternity system,
the construction of an entirely new house
or the restoration of an earthquake
damaged house "would be key."
The fraternities would provide "some
financial assistance" in building or
renovating a house, Jorgensen said. He
suggested the possibility of splitting the
costs almost evenly with the University.
Nemo said the national chapter of Al
pha Epsilon Pi is willing to pay the entire
cost of providing a house for the Stanford
chapter.
Though he said he is not involved in
the considerations, fraternal affairs ad
viser Michael Hughes expressed some
skepticism about the plan, which he
described as "an entirely undergraduate

Sigma Nu, Alpha Epsilon
Pi and Sigma Phi Epsilon
are 'the main viable' con
tenders.

initiative."
Hughes stated that while many un
housed fraternities do want houses, last
year's report on fraternities and sororities
represents an "institutionally strong
statement" by the University against cre
ating new housed fraternities.
The 1988 report states that, since 1982,
"there has been a freeze on housing peti
tions" although there is "no formal lim
itation on housing."
Jorgensen said that while he is aware
of the problems presented by the task
force report, building a new fraternity

house may nonetheless be possible. He
pointed out that a new fraternity house
would lessen the deficit of housing at
Stanford and that particularly since the
earthquake, Stanford "is in bad condition
for student housing."
Nemo agreed that "it's going to be
tough" to convince University officials to
give i house to an unhoused fraternity,
but that to do so would "be totally ben
eficial" for the University.
Nemo and Jorgensen both stressed the
need for student support in achieving
their goal. Nemo said that "if we can get
the right people behind us," the plan
might work.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
however, does not appear to support the
IFC plans. While claiming not to have
heard anything about the plans, he stated
that there "are no plans to increase" the
number of residential fraternities.
