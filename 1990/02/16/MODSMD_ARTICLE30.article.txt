t night Stanford did have to face
*, the Trojans' star freshman guard.
- made quite an impression in his
d appearance against Stanford as
ored 34 points to lead USC to a
win over the Cardinal.
ler's partner in the backcourt,
1: Pack, added 20 points to offset a
)int, 10-rebound effort from Adam

Keefe. Andrew Vlahov added 15 points
and 10 boards for the Cardinal.
Stanford falls to 44-8 overall, 6-7 in
the Pacific 10 Conference going into Sun
day's game at No. 23 UCLA. The Trojans
are now 9-11 overall, 4-9 in the Pac-10.
"Too much guards," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "We couldn't con
trol their guards. We couldn't defend
them."
The Cardinal was charged with 23 fouls
on the game and Miner made Stanford
pay by connecting on all 15 of his free
throws. Both Stanford starting guards,
John Patrick and Kenny Ammann, fouled
out while trying to keep USC's guards
under control.
"I don't what to say anything about
the officials but we didn't get any calls,"
Vlahov said. He also wondered about how
Miner drew nine fouls on the game.
"Maybe last year I'd expect (Sean) Elliott
to get that kind of protection but. ..."
Playing defense against USC's
playground-style, one-on-one offense also
seemed to affect Stanford's guards on the

other end. The five Cardinal guards coiti
hined for just seven points.
The Trojans led for nearly the first 15
minutes of the game before Derek Bruton
made it 26-24 with a layin off a pass
from Keefe. The Cardinal had tied the
game a minute earlier when Vlahov stole
a ball, dribbled upcourt on a two-on-one,
passed to Keefe and got the ball back for
a layup.
Vlahov then had a pair of put-back
hoops and Keefe had a free throw to
complete the 9-0 run and give Stanford
a 31-24 lead. Pack helped to tie the game
at 33 with a pair of baskets off drives
and an assist, but a Keefe layin made it
35-33 Stanford at the half.
USC took the lead for good at 43-41
when Miner nailed a 19-footer, and after
two Keefe free throws cut it to 47-45 the
Trojans went on a 12-2 run.
"I thought we had these guys beat,
then we let them get on top of us," Vlahov
said. "They got a little momentum, then
they just jumped on us."
"We had a stretch there where
we didn't get much done on of
fense or defense," Montgomery
said. "We were there for a while,
then we had a spurt where we
just didn't do much."
Miner hit 8-of-13 field goals on
the evening, mostly burying long
jumpers with defenders on him.
Meanwhile Pack was penetrating
the Stanford defense almost at
will.
"I don't think I could've done
a better job on Miner," Ammann
said. "He was hitting shots in my
face. I was fouling him and he
was hitting anyway. He's got a
bright future in front of him.
"I thought he made some pretty
tough shots. He was hitting
threes, falling away with me hang
ing all over him. I thought I played
the best defense I have all year
but it was like I wasn't there."
In addition to getting beat by
the guards, Stanford had two old
problems pop up again. The Car
dinal hit only 17-of-29 free throws
(.586) and made only l-of-10
three-pointers.
The Trojans also got 12 offen
sive rebounds, including five by
guards.
"They started coming up with
all the tipped balls, loose balls,
and their guards were getting big
rebounds," Keefe said. "Balls just
fell their way and I think that
happens because of aggressive
ness."
The Cardinal now has to face
UCLA in a game that will be triply
difficult. In addition to playing in
"Pauley Pavilion, where the Car
dinal is 0-24, the Bruins are still
smarting from a loss to Stanford
last month. Furthermore, the
Bruins will likely come out even
more fired up after being upset
by California last night.
"That's going to be a tough
game for us," Keefe said. "There
are no magic answers. We're just
going to have to grind it out."
Card notes
While Stanford's starting backcourt
had four points, USC's starting
frontcourt had a whopping seven.
