ler's partner in the backcourt,
1: Pack, added 20 points to offset a
)int, 10-rebound effort from Adam

Keefe. Andrew Vlahov added 15 points
and 10 boards for the Cardinal.
Stanford falls to 44-8 overall, 6-7 in
the Pacific 10 Conference going into Sun
day's game at No. 23 UCLA. The Trojans
are now 9-11 overall, 4-9 in the Pac-10.
"Too much guards," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "We couldn't con
trol their guards. We couldn't defend
them."
The Cardinal was charged with 23 fouls
on the game and Miner made Stanford
pay by connecting on all 15 of his free
throws. Both Stanford starting guards,
John Patrick and Kenny Ammann, fouled

passed to Keefe and got the ball back for
a layup.
Vlahov then had a pair of put-back
hoops and Keefe had a free throw to
complete the 9-0 run and give Stanford
a 31-24 lead. Pack helped to tie the game
at 33 with a pair of baskets off drives
and an assist, but a Keefe layin made it
35-33 Stanford at the half.
USC took the lead for good at 43-41
when Miner nailed a 19-footer, and after
two Keefe free throws cut it to 47-45 the
Trojans went on a 12-2 run.
