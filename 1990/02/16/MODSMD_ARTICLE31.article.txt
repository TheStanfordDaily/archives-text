# Men's Basketball at UCLA
## 
### 
SUNDAY — Live on Raycom (channel 5), KZSU (90.1 FM) and KCBS (740 AM) with a 3
p.m. tipoff at Pauley Pavilion.
RECORDS — Stanford (14-8, 6-7 in Pac-10 play, tied for 39th in the AP poll with two votes),
UCLA (16-6, 9-4, ranked No. 23).
INJURIES — Forward Adam Keefe reinjured his left ankle in practice Tuesday. He played
against USC last night, scoring 26 points and grabbing 10 rebounds.
SERIES — The Bruins lead the overall series by a lot. Actually, it's 109-71. Stanford,
however, has won the last three games, including an 87-79 Cardinal triumph in Maples
earlier this season. Guard Kenny Amrrann had a career-high 21 points in the win and
Keefe added 23. The Bruins played a box-and-one defense on Keefe to hold him to five
points in the second half but Ammann and John Patrick burned UCLA from the outside.
BRUIN UPDATE — UCLA is stinging after a 79-71 loss to California on their home floor.
The Bruins will has that and the loss in Maples in January to motivate them against the
Cardinal. UCLA is led by Don Mac Lean. who is second in the Pac-10 in both scoring
(20.3) and rebounding (8.8).
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford, coming off its disappointing loss to the Trojans, desperately
needs a win to keep postseason hopes alive. The Cardinal have lost their last five Pac-10
road games, and own just one conference road win.
KEYS TO VICTORY — When the Bruins came to Maples, Tracy Murray was 0 for 8 from
the field. Two days later he made the first start of his career against California and made
9-of-10 shots, including five three-pointers. Clearly, not letting Murray light it up from
outside is a priority, especially considering he averaged 44 points a game in high
school last year. STAT O' THE WEEK: Stanford is 11-0 when holding its opponent under
60 points.
