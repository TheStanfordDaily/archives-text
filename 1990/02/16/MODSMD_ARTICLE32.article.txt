I'he uncharacteristic chills that
swept through the Stanford Ten
nis Stadium did not lead to an
uncharacteristic result. The Stan
ford men's tennis team romped,
defeating the San Diego State net
ters by a tally of 8-1.
Leading the charge was junior
Glenn Solomon, who quickly won
6-1, 6-0 at No. 4 singles. Stanford
Coach Dick Gould summed it up
when he said, "Glenn is just play
ing super tennis. When you win
6-1, 6-0, it is pretty obvious that
everything is going great."

Hi?.

The first five singles matches
were won in straight sets by the
Cardinal. The freshmen trio of
Jonathan Stark at No. 1 singles,
Jared Palmer at No. 3 singles,
and Alexis Homhrecher at No. 5
singles continued their spectacu
lar rookie seasons.
Stark won 6-1, 7-5 over SDSU's
Ricardo Herrera. Palmer defeated
Woody Yocom 6-1, 6-4, while
Homhrecher heat Kerry Safdie 6-
4. 6- 4 Rounding out the
straight-sets victors was sopho
more Alex O'Brien, who won his
No. 2 singles match 6-3, 7-5.
At No. 6, Gould started .Jason
Yee because of the absence of Jeff
Cathrall from the lineup. Yee
battled toughly to win his match
in three long sets by the score of
6-4, 5-7, 7-5.
"Jason came through a

struggle," Asst. Coach John Whit
linger said. "His opponent was not
easy to play. He hung in, though,
and won it. He did the right things
on the crucial points."
Immediately after his marathon
match, he joined Hombrecher to
play the No. 2 doubles match.
Hombrecher and Yee made sure
that no time would be wasted,
winning 6-1, 6-1.
At No. 1 doubles the freshman
tandem of Stark and Palmer won
6-2, 7-6 (7-5). The two stars won
the Wimbledon juniors together
last summer, and are continuing
to play well at Stanford.
"We had a concentration lapse
in the second set, but we focused
each time one of our serves got
broken," Stark added. "We played
a good tiebreaker." Stanford's
lone setback was at the No. 3
doubles where seniot Eric Peus
and junior Dan Turbow were
beaten 6-4, 6-2 by the Aztecs'
