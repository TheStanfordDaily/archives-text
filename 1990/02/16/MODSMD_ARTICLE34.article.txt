# Horpel's guidance fortifies wrestling

### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling pro
gram makes do with what it
has. And as long as it has Chris
Horpel as its head coach, it will
have more than it needs to sur
vive.
Horpel graduated from Stan
ford in 1975. After school, he
devoted his life entirely to wres
tling for the next six months
in an attempt to make the 1976
U.S. Olympic team.
"I was first alternate," Hor
pel said. "I injured my knee
and didn't complete the final
match."
When Horpel came back to
the Bay Area after the Olympic
Trials, the Stanford wrestling
program had been reduced to
a club sport. So he started his
coaching career at Palo Alto
High School. It was there that
he coached Dave and Mark
Schultz, two wrestlers who
wound up winning Olympic
Gold Medals in 1984.
After short stints as head
coach at Gunn High School,
apd assistant coach at UCLA,
Horpel took over as head coach
at Stanford in 1979.
"It was still a club program
that year, but we had an
alumnus who confided in me
and said he was going to con
tribute enough money to make
the program much-better

funded than it ever was
before," he said.
With the money from the
alumnus, and Dave and Mark
Schultz as assistant coaches,
Stanford wrestling was
rejuvenated. "It made Stanford
wrestling look like it was a very
well-funded, well-followed and
well-promoted program. When
in reality, we were getting by
on a shoestring."
Tomorrow night Horpel will
have a chance to do something
he has not done since he has
been at Stanford: beat Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo. "Hopefully
we'll be able to take advantage
of the fact that they've been
having a rough season."
