# Paulsen bounces back from '89 woes

### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
I The Stanford baseball team
oesn't have a Comeback Player
112 the Year award, but it just
light need one after this season.
■ Unfortunately, there's one
jroblem with the word
Comeback." It's a compliment,
Lt it also usually means the
layer or team had a nightmare
E a son the year before. And well,
fcightmare" pretty much sums
|p last season for the Stanford
[aseball team — and for second
Useman Troy Paulsen in partic-
Bar.
[ "Last year was just a frustrat-
Lg season all around," Paulsen
Lys. "Coming into this year, I
jdn't think there was any way
re were going to let that happen
I "
bain.
[He was right. After only 11
ames, the Stanford squad has
10 wn that 1990 will be nothing
; all like 1989. And Paulsen,
[hose game took a nosedive in
089, has also turned things
found in spectacular fashion,
he junior leads the team in bat
ng (.408), is third in RBI (11)
id is in the top 10 in the Pacific
) Conference in four different
atistical categories.
To top it off, Paulsen was
amed the Pac-10's Player of the
feek after going 10-for-16 with
ine RBI in last weekend's sweep
Hawaii. All this from a player
ho hit .244 in the first half of
tet season and committed 15 er
trs in the team's first 16 games.
As complete as Paulsen's resur
nce has been, though, it hasn't
sctly surprised anyone. This is,
ter all, the same player who had
school-record 28-game hitting
reak two years ago, hit .342,
Hied 104 hits (the second-best
ardinal effort ever) and was
imed All-Pac-10 as a freshman.
So what happened last year?
'here were a lot of things wrong,
id they kept getting worse,"
lulsen says. "At the start I had
ouble fielding, and when I came
it of that, I wasn't hitting. By
at time it was halfway through
e season. (Then) I would make
many adjustments in a week's
ne that I couldn't get into a
oove with any of them."
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
inks there might have been an
her reason for Paulsen's sub-par
ar. "The key thing is (Troy)
ied to do too much," Marquess
ys. "He felt he had to do a lot.
»tried to do a lot to help the
am last year because we had so
any young players, we'd lost
me key guys and I just think

he tried too hard."
Paulsen agrees. "I tend to put
more pressure on myself than
need be," he says,"and I was
trying to do too much.
"Sometimes it's not even con
scious," Paulsen says."I was bat
ting three or four and thinking I
had to hit the ball out of the park
every time. You can't hit that way;
even power hitters can't do that.
That wasn't my role."
With the Cardinal's offense
taking off once again this year,
Paulsen's expectations have
changed. "This year we have so
many guys who can hit it out, I
don't have to worry about it,"he
says.
"This year we have a more ex
perienced team, and I don't think
(Troy) feels he has to carry the
load all by himself," Marquess
says. "He's just playing within
himself, and I think that's all he
needs to do."
Of course, "playing within him
self' doesn't completely explain
Paulsen's return to form. "We
have a new hitting style this
year," Paulsen says."(Former
Stanford player) Dave Esquer
worked with Tim Griffin and me
on it over the summer." Appar
ently the schooling worked: Paul
sen is on fire and Griffin, who
had seven career home runs before
1990, already has four this season.
His improved hitting has given
Paulsen the responsibility of bat
ting behind leadoff speedster Jeff
Hammonds. Paulsen, who injured
his throwing shoulder a month
ago diving for a ball, started the
season in the eighth batting slot,
but was moved to No. 2 by Mar
quess for the Hawaii series.
"I started Troy out at eight be
cause his shoulder was bothering
him (and) it was affecting his
swing a little bit," Marquess says.
"We were winning, so I just stayed
with it.
"He's one of our better hitters
and I want him to get up an extra
at bat," Marquess continues. "If
Hammonds is on ahead of him,
he's a tough two hitter.
With Paulsen playing his role
like the freshman of '88 did, the
Cardinal offense has gone nuts —
and the wins have piled up. "I
don't want to say we have a killer
instinct, but that's pretty much
the way it's worked out," Paulsen
says. "We're putting teams away
early and we're (also) winning the
close- -ones, • whisk we - didrv't- -do
last year."
Of course, as anyone will tell
you, a lot of things are different
from last year.


Junior Troy Paulsen has made a smooth switch from shortstop to
second base this season.
