Four and oh and away they
go.
The Stanford women's tennis
team is taking its perfect record
and No. 1 ranking to the Desert
State this weekend. The team
opens it Pacific 10 Conference
schedule with matches at Ari
zona State and Arizona.
So far things have gone ac
cording to plan for the Cardi
nal. A series of incrementally
tougher matches was scheduled
by Coach Frank Brennan to al
low his team to ease into the
grueling season schedule.
For the first time this week
end, Stanford should have its
"normal" lineup in place.
Sandra Birch, who had a bout
with the flu last weekend while
competing at the Rolex tour
nament in Minneapolis, will
take her place atop the singles
lineup.
Following her is freshman
Meredith McGrath. Heralded
as the nation's top recruit,
McGrath has not disappointed
thus far. Tuesday, McGrath
needed to make a quick exit
from her match to take a mid
term.
At No. 3 singles, Debbie
Graham takes her flawless

dual-match record to Arizona.
Graham has not lost in team
competition during her young
college career.
The singles lineup will be
rounded out by Teri Whit
linger, Lisa Green and Heather
Willens.
Green struggled in the au
tumn but feels like her game
is coming together now. There
is not a team in the country
that can boast of a No. 5 player
anywhere near Green's caliber.
Willens, a freshman like
McGrath, won the No. 6 spot
in a competitive battle with
freshman Mario Carruth and
sophomore Kylie Johnson.
