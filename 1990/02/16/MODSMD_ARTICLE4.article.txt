# Pay now, attend later
## Several states offer tuition prepayment 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
As the cost of a college educa
tion continues to mount, several
states have passed laws allowing
parents to pay their children's tui
tions years in advance. In Cali
fornia, however, the idea hasn't
caught on.
The prepayment scheme began
in Pittsburgh in 1986 when Du
quesne University offered to sell
parents four years of guaranteed
tuition for their children, to be
used when they reached college
age. The guarantees were contin
gent upon the children's admission
to college and could be refunded
if they did not attend.
The savings from such a prepay
nent plan could amount to several
housands of dollars, as rising col
ege tuition rates have consis
ently outpaced both the inflation
ate and the rate of increase in
amily incomes for the past 10
ears. Paying for tuition a decade
n advance can thus save a family
rom paying many more dollars
ater on.
Duquesne's idea sparked legis
ation in Michigan in December
1986 for a state-run trust fund,
n which parents paid for a guar
inteed four years' tuition at any
Michigan state college or univer
ity.
The Michigan bill prompted
ther states around the country
i introduce similar legislation. ll
nois, in January 1988, intro
uced special tax-exempt bonds
iat parents could buy to be put
•ward their children's education.
Wyoming followed with its own
repayment plan. California state

Sen. Tom Hayden, a Democrat,
introduced a bill in 1987 for a
similar program.
In October 1988, a national bill,
sponsored by Sen. Edward Ken
nedy, D-Mass., created special tax
free bonds that families earning
up to $60,000 a year could buy
to use for college tuition. The bill
was passed 94-0.
While the idea of prepayment
had an auspicious beginning,
problems arose in the forms of
expense and federal taxation. Du
quesne had to scrap its prepay
ment plan due to tuition rates
that rose higher than expected.
The university could not recover
returns on their investments fast
enough to avoid losing money by
offering tuition at a lower rate.
State programs also ran into
trouble. The Michigan bill was
passed in 1986 but was delayed
two years because the Internal
Revenue Service ruled that par
ents had to pay federal taxes on
the otherwise tax-free trust fund.
In fact, not everyone agreed
prepayment was a good idea. A
1988 New York Times editorial
criticized Kennedy's bill as being
too expensive, costing the govern
ment as much as $1 billion a year
by some estimates.
Prepayment plans were also
locked out of California when Re
publican Gov. George Deuk
meijian vetoed Hayden's bill in
1987. Since the veto, support for
prepayment plans has dwindled
in California.
The most selective colleges
around the country have also cho
sen not to pursue the prepayment
idea, instead letting the govern
ment handle such programs. Du
quesne's example could be one
reason: single institutions would
have great difficulty meeting the
financial costs of prepayment pro
grams.
Bruce Hooper, University of
Wyoming loan manager, said "it's
Uic «ar-ly to tell" whether the
returns on parents' investments
are enough to cover tuition in
creases in Wyoming's program.
The prepayment plan is in its
third vear.

Admissions are another prob
lem. There can be no guarantee
the child with the prepaid tuition
will be admitted to a highly com
petitive university, according to
Stanford's financial aids director,
Robert Huff.
But Hooper said, "We tell the
parents right up front that this
does not guarantee admission to
the university." If the child does
not go to the University of
Wyoming, the parents will be
refunded their money plus 4 per
cent interest.
Officials also raise the question
of prestige for the most selective
colleges, which are under constant
pressure to stay competitive.

Staying competitive requires
funds for new facilities, equip
ment and personnel. In turn, tui
tion rates steadily increase as the
institutions decide it is better to
maintain the competitive edge and
spend more money rather than
make tuitions easier to afford.
As student aid becomes more
scarce with shrinking federal
funds, most of the financial aid
that students receive comes from
institutional financial aid. Huff
said Stanford's Parent Loan Pro
gram offers loans given at "com
petitive rates" compared to other
institutions. He said the loans
take an average of five or six years
to pay off.
