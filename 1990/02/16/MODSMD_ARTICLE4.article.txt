# Pay now, attend later
## Several states offer tuition prepayment 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
As the cost of a college educa
tion continues to mount, several
states have passed laws allowing
parents to pay their children's tui
tions years in advance. In Cali
fornia, however, the idea hasn't
caught on.
The prepayment scheme began
in Pittsburgh in 1986 when Du
quesne University offered to sell
parents four years of guaranteed
tuition for their children, to be
used when they reached college
age. The guarantees were contin
gent upon the children's admission
to college and could be refunded
if they did not attend.
The savings from such a prepay
nent plan could amount to several
housands of dollars, as rising col
ege tuition rates have consis
ently outpaced both the inflation
ate and the rate of increase in
amily incomes for the past 10
ears. Paying for tuition a decade
n advance can thus save a family
rom paying many more dollars
ater on.
Duquesne's idea sparked legis
ation in Michigan in December
1986 for a state-run trust fund,
n which parents paid for a guar
inteed four years' tuition at any
Michigan state college or univer
ity.
The Michigan bill prompted
ther states around the country
i introduce similar legislation. ll
nois, in January 1988, intro
uced special tax-exempt bonds
iat parents could buy to be put
â€¢ward their children's education.
Wyoming followed with its own
repayment plan. California state

Sen. Tom Hayden, a Democrat,
introduced a bill in 1987 for a
similar program.
In October 1988, a national bill,
sponsored by Sen. Edward Ken
nedy, D-Mass., created special tax
free bonds that families earning
up to $60,000 a year could buy
to use for college tuition. The bill
was passed 94-0.
While the idea of prepayment
had an auspicious beginning,
problems arose in the forms of
expense and federal taxation. Du
quesne had to scrap its prepay
ment plan due to tuition rates
that rose higher than expected.
The university could not recover
returns on their investments fast
enough to avoid losing money by
offering tuition at a lower rate.
State programs also ran into
trouble. The Michigan bill was
passed in 1986 but was delayed
two years because the Internal
Revenue Service ruled that par
ents had to pay federal taxes on
the otherwise tax-free trust fund.
In fact, not everyone agreed
prepayment was a good idea. A
1988 New York Times editorial
criticized Kennedy's bill as being
too expensive, costing the govern
ment as much as $1 billion a year
by some estimates.
Prepayment plans were also
locked out of California when Re
publican Gov. George Deuk
meijian vetoed Hayden's bill in
1987. Since the veto, support for
prepayment plans has dwindled
in California.
The most selective colleges
around the country have also cho
sen not to pursue the prepayment
