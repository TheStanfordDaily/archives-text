After three consecutive home
meets, Stanford's women gym
nasts have to travel to enemy ter
ritory, competing in the four-team
Cactus Classic in Tucson, Ariz,
tomorrow night.
Following the emotional
buildup preceding last weekend's
super-charged performance at
Burnham Pavilion, the Cardinal
has suffered a bit of a mental
let-down.
"I think any team has its ups
and downs," senior Dina Amoroso
said.
This is not to say that Stanford
will have to be wheelbarrowed
into the meet. Cardinal spirits will
be lifted by the return of two key
performers from ankle injuries.
Freshman Erin McCann will be

back in the all-around competition
a*id sophomore Denise Villars will
return on balance beam and floor
exercise.
"Having them back will help us
spirit-wise," Susan Banta said. "It
will especially help to have Enn
back on bars because we'll have
six people on bars instead of five."
