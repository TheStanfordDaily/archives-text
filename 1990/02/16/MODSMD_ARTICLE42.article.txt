# Senior Loop leads undefeated men's gymnasts
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Charles Loop and Sir Walter
Raleigh may have something in
common. According to teammate
Conrad Voorsanger, Loop would
"throw himself into a puddle and
let us walk over him if he thought
it would help us get to the other
side."
It is this devotion and dedica
tion to his team that has earned
the senior from Dallas the respect
of his fellow gymnasts.
Gymnastics has been a part of
Loop's life ever since he was four
years old, when he was spotted
diving at a public pool by a local
gymnastics coach who thought he
showed potential. Loop began
competing at age eight, and soon
proved the coach's intuitions to
be correct.
Throughout most of his high
school career, however, Loop kept
a fairly low profile. In June of
his senior year he entered the
Junior National Championships,
but did not have any expectations
of placing in the top 10 and be
coming a member of the junior
national team. In fact, he did
manage to take 10th and earn a
spot on the squad, but he decided
to turn it down because he had
already made other plans.
"I stayed up all night agonizing
over the decision," he said. "It
was definitely the most traumatic
experience of my career."
Loop already knew that he
would be joining the Cardinal
team in the fall, and he wanted

to take a break before beginning
the rigorous training Coach
Hamada had in store for him.
"Once I got to Stanford, I had to
pretty much drop everything I
had learned in the past 18 years
and start over again," he ex
plained.
Coming onto the team with him
were Conrad Voorsanger and
Adam Forman, both widely
sought recruits. For this reason,
Loop thought he would have a
year off from all-around competi
tion during which he could refine
his basic skills. After two team
members were injured, however,
it became clear that he would get
his first taste of collegiate com
petition as a freshman.
Since that time, "Charles has
just worked and worked,"
Hamada said. "He has a really
positive attitude and he enjoys the
sport. He's nice to have in the
gym because he's always positive,
pleasant and energetic."
Loop's hard work paid off last

year and earned him a spot on
the Senior Developmental na
tional team. This team is com
prised of the top six gymnasts
under the age of 21 who just
missed spots on the U.S. national
team. Loop's immediate personal
goal is to make that team by

finishing well in this year's U.S.
Championships.
His focus ultimately shifts back
to the team, however. "Winning
NCAAs is my most important goal
right now," he said. "This year's
team has the most potential be
cause the chemistry is so good.

We're all best friends and the mys
tique it takes to win is there." j
According to Hamada, Loop j s
an important contributor to the
team psychology. "He serves as a
role model for the younger gym.
nasts, who really look up to him
He's a good leader," he said.
