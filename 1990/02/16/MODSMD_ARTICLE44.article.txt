# Bears invade deGuerre
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
Whenever Stanford swimming teams line
up against California, the stench of fierce
competition emanates from the pool. How
ever, for the Cardinal men's team, another
factor will make Saturday's noon meet at
deGuerre Pool against the Golden Bears a
little more pungent than usual.
For seven Cardinal seniors, Saturday will
be the last day they will swim competitively
in deGuerre Pool. Byron Burson, Jeff Garr,
Rick Gould, Lunn Lestina, Doug Lillydahl,
Sam Schwartz and John Witchel have this
final opportunity to mark up deGuerre
records.
"Just being the last home meet of the
season — regardless of whether it was
against USC, UCLA or Berkeley — makes
this meet exciting," Burson said.
The Golden Bears bring an 8-4 reSSfd
into deGuerre, after falling 94-39 to USC
and 75-38 to UCLA in their last two meets.
Golden Bear standout freestyler Sean Kil
lion and individual medley strength Jeff
Prior will also be competing for the final
time at Stanford.
"This is not the biggest meet of the year
for us by any stretch of the imagination,"
Burson said. "Cal has a worse record than
us, and we should have no problem winning
the meet."
Regardless of the outcome against the
Bears, these seven seniors have already left
their stamp with numerous deGuerre Pool
records: Garr in the 50 freestyle, 200 med
ley relay and 200 freestyle relay, Gould in
the 200 medley relay, Burson in the 200

freestyle relay and Witchel in the 200 free
style.
"I'm really excited with my swimming.
I think I'm setting myself up for a great
finale to my career," Burson said. "As a
team, we've been getting a little extra rest,
and, in the next few weeks, I just think
the team is going to go crazy."
After falling to UCLA and USC in dual' .
meets two weekends a"go, Stanford "(5-3) v
needs to bring its times down to challenge
for the NCAA Championship. The swim
mers expect that the late March competi
tion will come down to an extremely close
race between Stanford, Texas and USC.
"Our team is better than any team I
have been on at Stanford," said Burson, a
member of the NCAA Championship teams
of 1986 and 1987.
"This year we've also got a couple of
outstanding swimmers, but now the
dropoff to the next level of swimmer is no
where near what it was my freshman year,"
Burson said.
After facing California, the Cardinal will
have two weeks to prepare for the Pac-10
Championships, where most of the swim
mers hope to qualify for NCAAs.
