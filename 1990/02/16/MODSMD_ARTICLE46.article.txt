# Card to tangle Tigers
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
After an exhausting span of two weeks
against top-five competition, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team appears to be
getting just what the doctor ordered this
weekend: Loyola Marymount.
The No. 15 Tigers, coming to the
Farm for a 5 p.m. Sunday match, are
1-3 in the WIVA conference. Stanford
Coach Fred Sturm, however, is not so
easily fooled.
"Loyola is much better than their
record indicates," Sturm said. "They've
played the very best teams very tough.
They are not to be underestimated."
The No. 2 Cardinal indeed may en
counter a tougher-than-expected oppon
ent ."IToybla features several noted
players including middle blocker Chris
Young and outside hitters Chuck Donlon
and Sio Saipaia. The offense is coor
dinated by setter Rick McLaughlin, a
player Sturm considers to be "very
smart."
"Later in the season," Sturm pre
dicted, "I'll probably say 'I told you
Loyola is going to beat some teams.' "
Stanford, however, has no intention
of being the first victim of this prophecy.
After going undefeated in a strenuous
string of matches against No. 7 North
ridge, No. 8 UCSB and No. 4 Hawaii,
the Cardinal has managed to justify its
sky-high preseason expectations.
Despite what Sturm terms "adverse

conditions" against Hawaii early this
week, Stanford played admirably and
has managed to build a tide of momen
tum. Senior middle blocker Dan Hanan
launched his game into outer orbit this
week recording the most kills in Hawaii
and has continued to raise the team to
another level. Fellow middle blocker
Craig Forsyth has been playing "excep
tionally well a«d has really stood out,"
Sturm said.
The team is further reinforced by the
return of swing hitter Ryan Moos and
backup setter Ryan O'Hara. Both in
jured players have begun regular prac
tices with the team, Sturm announced.
Loyola may be cautioned not to con
centrate on Stanford's starting six too
heavily in practice. Bob Hillman, a trans
fer from Georgetown who plays the
swinghitter position, saw significant
time in Hawaii and performed admirab
ly. Mike Lowe, who started at times last
year, continues to loom in the back
ground as a powerful non-passing out
side hitter. "They're always ready to
go," Sturm said.
