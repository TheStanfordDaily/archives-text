# Archuleta turns Black House into 'home'
## Director proposed his job as student 
### Danzy Senna Editorial staff 
As the director of the Black
Community Services Center,
Keith Archuleta prefers not to
sit in an ivory tower.
Under his guidance, the Black
House feels more like a home
than an administration building,
with students coming and going,
studying and relaxing through
out the day.
Archuleta sees his role as
being "his brother's and sister's
keeper."
And it's no wonder. Only 12
years ago Archuleta was a fiery
student activist at Stanford, or
ganizing and studying in the
same building where he cur
rently serves as director.
In fact, as co-chair of the Black
Student Union from 1977 to
1978, Archuleta wrote the pro
posal that led to the creation of
his current job.
Archuleta's history at Stan
ford seems quite paradoxical —
having gone from student activ
ist to administrator in so short
a time.
But Archuleta explains, "I ran
the Black House in '76 and 77;
now I'm getting paid for it. So
it's not a hard transition. I do
it like a student."
As an undergraduate, Archu
leta led many of the movements
to make Stanford more racially
diverse. Archuleta says that mul
ticulturalism, becoming more ac
cepted now, was a radical

concept in his day.
"Twenty years later, we can
say we have these multicultural
institutions," he says."The plan
was not for them to be here.
For 15 years, we had to
struggle."
For Archuleta, struggle has
been natural.
He has faced it from the day

he was born, the son of an
unwed 17-year-old Chicana and
a black man in the Air Force
who was stationed in Vietnam
His family lived in poverty in
the projects of Denver, and by a
young age he was already ex
posed to the crime-ridden
realities of inner-city life.
Archuleta was saved from that

hostile environment when he was
sent to live with his aunt and
uncle in Kinston, North
Carolina. Here, he was just as
poor — he spent his summers
working in tobacco fields — but
he avoided urban dangers.
