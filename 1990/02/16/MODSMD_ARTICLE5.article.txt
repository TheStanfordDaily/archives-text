# Archuleta turns Black House into 'home'
## Director proposed his job as student 
### Danzy Senna Editorial staff 
As the director of the Black
Community Services Center,
Keith Archuleta prefers not to
sit in an ivory tower.
Under his guidance, the Black
House feels more like a home
than an administration building,
with students coming and going,
studying and relaxing through
out the day.
Archuleta sees his role as
being "his brother's and sister's
keeper."
And it's no wonder. Only 12
years ago Archuleta was a fiery
student activist at Stanford, or
ganizing and studying in the
same building where he cur
rently serves as director.
In fact, as co-chair of the Black
Student Union from 1977 to
1978, Archuleta wrote the pro
posal that led to the creation of
his current job.
Archuleta's history at Stan
ford seems quite paradoxical —
having gone from student activ
ist to administrator in so short
a time.
But Archuleta explains, "I ran
the Black House in '76 and 77;
now I'm getting paid for it. So
it's not a hard transition. I do
it like a student."
As an undergraduate, Archu
leta led many of the movements
to make Stanford more racially
diverse. Archuleta says that mul
ticulturalism, becoming more ac
cepted now, was a radical

concept in his day.
"Twenty years later, we can
say we have these multicultural
institutions," he says."The plan
was not for them to be here.
For 15 years, we had to
struggle."
For Archuleta, struggle has
been natural.
He has faced it from the day

he was born, the son of an
unwed 17-year-old Chicana and
a black man in the Air Force
who was stationed in Vietnam
His family lived in poverty in
the projects of Denver, and by a
young age he was already ex
posed to the crime-ridden
realities of inner-city life.
Archuleta was saved from that

hostile environment when he was
sent to live with his aunt and
uncle in Kinston, North
Carolina. Here, he was just as
poor — he spent his summers
working in tobacco fields — but
he avoided urban dangers.

Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Keith Archuleta, who serves as director of the Black Community
Services Center, works to make the center feel like home to black students. Archuleta has been
active in Stanford's black community since he was co-chair of the Black Student Union in 1977-78,
when he proposed the job he currently holds.
Going to high school in the early
days of court-ordered desegrega
tion, Archuleta saw himself as a
bridge between the two worlds of
black and white.
"You know, a lot of times when
you're separated, you feel like you
have to choose. I never looked at
it that way," Archuleta says."I
said, 'I can bring both worlds to
gether and be the type of person
who translates the world for both
groups.' "
Archuleta decided to go to Stan
ford to leave the South, thinking
that he could expand the limited
options available to him.
"I still believed in a myth when
1 came from the South — that
education would deal with rac
ism," he says."I thought Stanford
was going to be the best and the
brightest of the nation."
He experienced culture shock
soon after arriving here. In
retrospect, he describes those first
years at Stanford as difficult ones:
"Here I am coming as a freshman,
someone who has lived in poverty
in both Denver and North
Carolina, coming to Stanford. My
roommate was a tall white guy
with blonde hair who was on the
swim team from Los Altos Hills.
And 1 thought I knew some rich
people in Kinston. But I really
learned what rich was when I got
here."
Archuleta became increasingly
angry during his first few years
at Stanford, as he began to realize
what he had been denied in his
education. "I remember in
seventh grade, back in Kinston,
having a history teacher tell us
how slavery was good for black
people because it was a civilizing
factor, how it got them out of
savagery. And that was all of the
black history we got."

Because he wasn't learning
black history in his Stanford
classes, Archuleta took the initi
ative to educate himself as a fresh
man. He and his friends started
their own KZSU show, "Black
Perspectives," which aired every
Thursday night during all of Ar
chuleta's undergraduate years.
Students interviewed black
campus personalities about cur
rent events.
Archuleta also became involved
in reviving the BSU and The Real
News, the black community news
paper. And the more he became
involved and aware, the more he
realized the need for change, he
says.
Archuleta describes his years at
Stanford as "battle-oriented." He
suggests those years were almost
more difficult than the 1960s be
cause, he believes, "it is easier to
fight for something than to fight
to keep something."
Archuleta describes the 1970s
as "a real journey" for him and
other black student activists of
the time.
"It took us three years, a core
of us, to really educate ourselves
— to find out how and why to
keep what people had fought and
died for.
"I always say that was the pe
riod of the flood, when we found
rocks and we held on," Archuleta
explains. "Those of us who had
any commitment to the black com
munity, we just held on."
Archuleta spent his undergrad
uate years working to establish
self-determination in the black
community. "If you're going to
have this Constitution, this Dec
laration of Independence and this
Stanford University, this is mine
then," he says.
After graduating from Stan
ford, Archuleta worked as a con
sultant and legislative aide to the
Ways and Means Committee of
the California Legislature. He also

'We sort of incor
porated that Stanfor
dism ... that you
don't criticize and you
don't make waves.'

spent time in West Africa as a
volunteer in community develop
ment.
Archuleta returned to Stanford
in 1982 to attend the Graduate
School of Business. Although this
seemed to contradict his political
beliefs, Archuleta believed that he
could effect change more skillfully
once educated in the way the
country works.
But after an unhappy year at
the Business School, Archuleta
started working as a program di
rector at Tresidder Union. From
there, he became assistant direc
tor of the Row.
These jobs made his move from
student to administrator an easier
transition, he says.
Changes, good and bad
Archuleta has seen positive
changes in the black community
since the time when he was a
student, much of which he attri
butes to institutions in the black
community, such as Ujamaa
House and the Black House.
"Having the [Black House] has
sustained the organizational
strengths we had," Archuleta
says. "We probably have the
strongest BSU in the country —
it's been consistent and it's win
ning things, rather than simply
resting on its laurels."
Archuleta sees only one nega
tive change in his community:
"We sort of incorporated that
Stanfordism . . . that you don't
criticize and you don't make
waves. That's a Stanford culture
thing. If you disagree, it's sort of
intellectually, and you don't get

emotional. You don't do things
from the heart."
Archuleta saw this attitude in
parts of the black community dur
ing the May 15 takeover of Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy's office. Although some
of its members were involved, the
BSU did not formally support the
protest, to Archuleta's dismay.
"It was one of the first times
the BSU leadership wasn't down
for a sit-in or a takeover," Archu
leta says.
On the students' side
The University tried to depict
students involved in the takeover
as "not a part of Stanford," Ar
chuleta says.
"I said, 'I have seen situations
where drunken fraternity people
have thrown couches out of win
dows, and we have handled them
like they were the kings and
queens of Morocco. And maybe
their parents are. But [the pro
testers] didn't do anything that
day. They just took over a build
ing.' "
Archuleta was the only admin
istrator allowed to enter the build
ing on the day of the takeover
because many students tend to
view Archuleta more as an ally in
struggle than a part of the system
they are struggling to improve.
In the words of junior Louis
Jackson, one of the May 15 protes
tors, "Keith is a father, a brother,
an administrator, an artist — but
most importantly, he's a friend."
Archuleta explores the reasons
for this: "Students could see I was
there for them, and if there was
a difference between what the ad
ministration thought and what
they thought, usually you could
find me thinking along the same
line as the students.
"I never forget that I was a
student. I believe in youth and
what they do. No matter how old
I get, I don't want to lose that."
