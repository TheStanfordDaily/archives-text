# Astronaut: imagination should override image
## 
### Sarah Kling 
If you learn one lesson at Stan
ford, said Mae Jemison, Stanford
alumna and NASA's first black
woman astronaut, never let some
one else limit what you can be
because of their lack of imagina
tion.
Speaking last night in Kresge
Auditorium, Jemison emphasized
that "other people's images don't
allow you what you want to be."
She told audience members that
they must "make the most of each
day," whether it be at Stanford
or at another school, in the career
world or in the Third World.
Jemison, one of several
speakers invited to celebrate
Black Liberation Month, placed
special emphasis on the availabil
ity of educational opportunities
for everyone. Many tasks face the
current generation, she said, and
people must participate in
decision-making in order to im
prove social and economic
conditions.
In order to achieve progress,
the work force in its entirety must
be technically educated, she said.
All doors need to be opened for
children to receive instruction in
math and sciences. Jemison also
stressed the need for a well
rounded education.
"We need a cross-section of ex
posure to math, sciences and
liberal arts," she said. "Extensive
knowledge in one limited area will

not benefit thi
world. We have to
understand polj.
tics and mathe.
matics in order to
deal with people,'
On becoming
the first black
woman astro,
naut, she com.
mented, "I wy

not the first qualified black
woman to apply to the program,
I just happened to apply at a time
when society had grown enougj
to finally allow a black woman
astronaut."
Jemison also emphasized \
necessity of using the past to help
us see into the future. Her meÂ»
sage: "To know where we're going
to, we must know where we cam<
from."
She began her career at Stan,
ford in 1973 as a freshman
Roble Hall, then the black themi
house. She was involved in thi
performing arts, with talents ai
a dancer, actress and choreog
rapher. Also active in politics
Jemison was president of thi
Black Student Union in 1974 am
1975.
Jemison has been assigned a
a mission specialist on STS-41
Spacelab I, a cooperative missioi
between the United States am
Japan to conduct experiments ii
life sciences and materials proe
essing. Spacelab I is scheduled foi
launch in June 1991.
