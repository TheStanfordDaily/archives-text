# Letter from the editor: Get off the Farm!
## 
### 
Sometimes it's hard to believe
that San Francisco is just minutes
away from Stanford. When those
midterms and finals roll around,
the earth shrinks down to a few class
rooms, a library carrel, the Wilbur lunch
line and maybe a bed. Palo Alto disap
pears from the map, and San Francisco,
not surprisingly, gets relegated to a dif
ferent universe.
Even if you manage the superhuman
feat of keeping your perspective intact
when academic and other pressures set
in, Farm and City are still worlds apart.
San Francisco's landscape, climate,
people, culture and architecture, not to
mention its size, are so different from
Stanford's that the distance between the
two places seems much greater than the
actual 40 miles.
Stanford's air is clear, blue and warm,

but fog and Bay breezes kiss the City
even at the height of summer. Stanford
has foothills, but San Francisco's hills are
almost too steep to foot. Unlike Stan
ford, San Francisco offers night life be
sides sitting in front of a computer at
AIR. There are neighborhoods full of old
houses to look at and freaky people to
stare at. Or swallow your pride and visit
the tourist spots; they're often the most
fun places of all.
If this isn't enough motivation for you
to throw that biology book at your
roommate and hop on the CalTrain,
then read on. Off the Farm's writers
have ventured to the City, and do they
ever have stories to tell. But don't daw
dle — you've got a train to catch!
