# Golden Gate Park

In 1871 this narrow patch of land was no more than a heap of
sand dunes, but since then it has flourished into a maze of mead
ows, lakes (which, unlike our poor Lagunita, actually have water
in them) and attractions so assorted that only time could have
guided their arrangement on the four square miles between Ful
ton Street and Lincoln Way. And like the patch of beach that re
mains to remind us of what came before, we see signs of the old
becoming new all over the park.
The hub of activity in the park consists of two museum build
ings and the courtyard between them. If the day begins on the
chilly side, as it usually does, the museums are a good place to

start exploring. Parking, mostly
along the sides of streets, is
free and, amazingly, often
available, but be prepared to
walk some distance to your
destination.
The California Academy of
the Sciences (admission $4,
open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily)
offers all the stuffed animals,
old bones and other delights
you remember from that third
grade field trip to a natural his
tory museum. But things have
changed since grammar school
— many of the exhibits are
modern, including video
screens and computers that
make the museum-going ex
perience more hands-on.
An exhibit completed just
this spring, called "Life
through Time: Evidence for
Evolution" marks this new ap
proach. Your journey through
life on earth may begin with a
few minutes playing on one of
the computers programmed to
trace different "family trees"
for the origins of mammals or
reptiles.
From there, you encounter
a collage of fossils, models, di
agrams, video screens and
even live animals and plants,
moving chronologically from
the first cell to the pteradactyl
to the wooly mammoth. Al
though I thought the 8-foot
moving, sound-making cen
tipede was a little too Univer
sal Studios to belonc in a sci-

ence museum, on the whole, this get-the-visitor-involved idea
makes science informative and fun.
The museum also practices the new idea of science meeting
art by hosting several nature photography exhibits, including one
on undersea life and another one on Yosemite. But if you like to
see nature really close up, stop by the attached Steinhart aquari
um, which features fish and reptiles from .ill over the world, as
well as dolphins, sea lions and penguins.
As you leave the museum and enter the courtyard, the beat of
the Congo drums or the harmonics of a barbershop quartet may
call you over to the the Music Concourse. The site of a multitude
of cultural events, the bandshell is the c urrent home for the Sum

mer Festival of Performing Arts. Performances t.ike place every
Thursday from 1 to 3 p.m. through Oct. 18.
If you manage to pull yourself away from the music, The de
Young Memorial Museum awaits (admission $4, open Wednes
day through Sunday only). The oldest museum in the city, the de
Young houses a great collection of North American art, as well as
a selection from the ancient and European world before the mid
19th century.
The best exhibit in the museum is its special show of Amish
quilts. Hung in a darkened room with dramatic lighting, the old
becomes new once again: the intricately patterned and stitched

quilts even resemble modern
art, eroding the line typically
drawn between "folk" art and
"high" art. If truly modern art is
more your style, there is an in
teresting show of )im Dine
drawings from 1973 to 1987,
many of which have never
been seen in public before.
With the same admission
ticket you can stroll into the
Asian Art Museum of San Fran
cisco, which houses a large
collection of works from China
and a smaller but equally fine
collection from Japan. The sec
ond floor is filled with tidbits
from India, Indonesia, Iran and
other Asian cultures.
Because these styles and
subject matter of Asian art is
unfamiliar to many viewers,
the museum is conveniently
laid out in chronological order
by country. But the greatest
help of all is a computer
demonstration of Thangka
painting, a traditional style of
Buddhist monks in Tibet. Sci
ence meets art again in this
friendly Macintosh program,
which graphs one of the com
plicated paintings. By moving
around the screen and i licking
any god or object, you can ac
tivate the three video screens
above to explain various as
pects of the figure, sue h as the
way it was painted or its sym
bolism.
Now that school is starting,
such a bombardment of

knowledge and culture, western and not, may just be too much
for one poor brain to handle. Never tear! A day in the park can
be just the thing to restore peacefulness and sanity to a hectic life.
Pull on a sweatshirt and get lost on one of the nature trails that
pop up every few feet, or wander through the Japanese Tea gar
den (admission $2). -\s the ancient beauty of pagodas, bonsai
trees and tlowing carp pools are food for a weary soul, jasmine
tea and oriental cookies at the open-air tea house feed a weary
body.
It you'd rather lie sniffing flowers than sipping tea, you can
point your nose in many directions. A long rose garden extending
behind the art museum blooms .ill summer, and patches of vari

ous other plants like cherry trees, rhododendrons and tulips (ac
companied by a real Dutch windmill) pop up at various other
times of the year in various other locations.
More formal gardens include the Shakespeare garden, filled
with flowers Shakespeare mentions in his works, and of course
the main attractions: the Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Car
dens and the Conservatory of Flowers. The Arboretum (admission
is free) has collections of plants from around the world, including
a California Collection of Native Plants. Not only the oldest re
maining building in the park, the conservatory is also one of the
most fascinating and beautiful.
Built in England and transported here in pieces that sailed all
the way around Cape Horn, the Victorian-style glass building was
erected on 1879. This structure provides quite a contrast to the
neon roller-bladers that zoom around outside it. Inside (admis
sion $4), carefully controlled temperature and moisture levels in
its dome support a range of tropical plants, including huge palm

trees.
If nil this plant talk sounds a
little sedate, never fear. A great
place to play — in fact, Ameri
ca's oldest public park — is
right down the road. The sym
biosis of new and old appears
in the recently remodeled
playgrounds (one of tires and
wood, another of little bright
plastic triangles) and the vin
tage Herschell-Spillman
Carousel ($1 per ride). And I
wasn't the only "adult" not ac
companied by a little kid riding
this masterpiece of craftsman
ship constructed in 1914.
Though, like so many struc
tures in the park, the carousel
has been restored recently, it
still seems to be from a differ
ent age. The bright carved an
imals are intricate and imagi
native, and include frogs, cats,
pigs, an ostrich with big feet
and a monster that is part sea

horse and part griffin. The tunes pinging from the 1920s German
Cebruder band organ complete the air of backward time travel.
Tennis, anyone? Soccer? Lawn bowling? You can find a spot for
almost any sport, new or old, here among the trees, including
baseball diamonds, a 9-hole golf course, horseback riding, horse
shoe pits, even a polo field that's become a football stadium. On
the largest lake in the park, Stow Lake, you can either cross over
the Roman bridges to climb to the the hilly island in the center
and get a cool view of the city, or you can cross under them in a
rowboat or paddle boat (rental $8 to $11 per hour).
Even if you just want to see these sights, riding a bike ride can
cut down the time it takes to get around. With so much to do in
the three and a half miles between ends of the park, it would be
difficult for even the most ambitious to see everything in.i day.
And I wouldn't recommend trying. Golden Gate Park is just
too beautiful to hurry through. So stop in a meadow to play t'ris
bee or read your book in a good old-fashioned hammock in a se
cluded grove. Even if all you're reading is your linguistics home
work, it pays to remember that people are not meant to live in li
braries.

In 1871 this narrow patch of land was no more than a heap of
sand dunes, but since then it has flourished into a maze of mead
ows, lakes (which, unlike our poor Lagunita, actually have water
in them) and attractions so assorted that only time could have
guided their arrangement on the four square miles between Ful

changed since grammar school
— many of the exhibits are
modern, including video
screens and computers that
make the museum-going ex
perience more hands-on.
An exhibit completed just
this spring, called "Life
through Time: Evidence for
Evolution" marks this new ap
proach. Your journey through
life on earth may begin with a
few minutes playing on one of
the computers programmed to
trace different "family trees"
for the origins of mammals or

From there, you encounter

even live animals and plants,
moving chronologically from
the first cell to the pteradactyl
to the wooly mammoth. Al
though I thought the 8-foot
moving, sound-making cen
tipede was a little too Univer
sal Studios to belonc in a sci-

makes science informative and fun.
The museum also practices the new idea of science meeting
art by hosting several nature photography exhibits, including one
on undersea life and another one on Yosemite. But if you like to
see nature really close up, stop by the attached Steinhart aquari
um, which features fish and reptiles from .ill over the world, as
well as dolphins, sea lions and penguins.
As you leave the museum and enter the courtyard, the beat of
the Congo drums or the harmonics of a barbershop quartet may
call you over to the the Music Concourse. The site of a multitude
of cultural events, the bandshell is the c urrent home for the Sum

trees and tlowing carp pools are food for a weary soul, jasmine
tea and oriental cookies at the open-air tea house feed a weary
body.
It you'd rather lie sniffing flowers than sipping tea, you can
point your nose in many directions. A long rose garden extending
behind the art museum blooms .ill summer, and patches of vari

times of the year in various other locations.
More formal gardens include the Shakespeare garden, filled
with flowers Shakespeare mentions in his works, and of course
the main attractions: the Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Car

is free) has collections of plants from around the world, including
a California Collection of Native Plants. Not only the oldest re
maining building in the park, the conservatory is also one of the
most fascinating and beautiful.
Built in England and transported here in pieces that sailed all
the way around Cape Horn, the Victorian-style glass building was
erected on 1879. This structure provides quite a contrast to the
neon roller-bladers that zoom around outside it. Inside (admis

its dome support a range of tropical plants, including huge palm

trees.
If nil this plant talk sounds a

knowledge and culture, western and not, may just be too much
for one poor brain to handle. Never tear! A day in the park can
be just the thing to restore peacefulness and sanity to a hectic life.
Pull on a sweatshirt and get lost on one of the nature trails that
pop up every few feet, or wander through the Japanese Tea gar
den (admission $2). -\s the ancient beauty of pagodas, bonsai
trees and tlowing carp pools are food for a weary soul, jasmine
tea and oriental cookies at the open-air tea house feed a weary
body.
It you'd rather lie sniffing flowers than sipping tea, you can
point your nose in many directions. A long rose garden extending
behind the art museum blooms .ill summer, and patches of vari

ous other plants like cherry trees, rhododendrons and tulips (ac
companied by a real Dutch windmill) pop up at various other
times of the year in various other locations.
More formal gardens include the Shakespeare garden, filled
with flowers Shakespeare mentions in his works, and of course
the main attractions: the Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Car
dens and the Conservatory of Flowers. The Arboretum (admission
is free) has collections of plants from around the world, including
a California Collection of Native Plants. Not only the oldest re
maining building in the park, the conservatory is also one of the
most fascinating and beautiful.
Built in England and transported here in pieces that sailed all
the way around Cape Horn, the Victorian-style glass building was
erected on 1879. This structure provides quite a contrast to the
neon roller-bladers that zoom around outside it. Inside (admis
sion $4), carefully controlled temperature and moisture levels in
its dome support a range of tropical plants, including huge palm

trees.
If nil this plant talk sounds a
little sedate, never fear. A great
place to play — in fact, Ameri
ca's oldest public park — is
right down the road. The sym
biosis of new and old appears
in the recently remodeled
playgrounds (one of tires and
wood, another of little bright
plastic triangles) and the vin
tage Herschell-Spillman
Carousel ($1 per ride). And I
wasn't the only "adult" not ac
companied by a little kid riding
this masterpiece of craftsman
ship constructed in 1914.
Though, like so many struc
tures in the park, the carousel
has been restored recently, it
still seems to be from a differ
ent age. The bright carved an
imals are intricate and imagi
native, and include frogs, cats,
pigs, an ostrich with big feet
and a monster that is part sea

horse and part griffin. The tunes pinging from the 1920s German
Cebruder band organ complete the air of backward time travel.
Tennis, anyone? Soccer? Lawn bowling? You can find a spot for
almost any sport, new or old, here among the trees, including
baseball diamonds, a 9-hole golf course, horseback riding, horse
shoe pits, even a polo field that's become a football stadium. On
the largest lake in the park, Stow Lake, you can either cross over
the Roman bridges to climb to the the hilly island in the center
and get a cool view of the city, or you can cross under them in a
rowboat or paddle boat (rental $8 to $11 per hour).
Even if you just want to see these sights, riding a bike ride can
cut down the time it takes to get around. With so much to do in
the three and a half miles between ends of the park, it would be
difficult for even the most ambitious to see everything in.i day.
And I wouldn't recommend trying. Golden Gate Park is just
too beautiful to hurry through. So stop in a meadow to play t'ris
bee or read your book in a good old-fashioned hammock in a se
cluded grove. Even if all you're reading is your linguistics home
work, it pays to remember that people are not meant to live in li
braries.
