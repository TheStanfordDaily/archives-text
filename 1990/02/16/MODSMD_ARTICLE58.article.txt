# Feel the Beat
## Whispers of lost generation echo in the City's bookstores 
### Frank Quaratiello 
Bookstores arc a wellspring of inspiration and a final resting
place for literature of old. The stories, poems and words
filed away on their shelves divide time rhythmically and
mark changes.
In San Francisco, there is a wide variety of bookstores where
the tales of countless generations whisper like the rustle of pages.
And the whispers of the Beat generation are louder than most.
Reflecting backward and echoing forward, the Beat writers offer
a captivating vision of the world that is still relevant today.
Many of the generation's prominent figures — Allen Ginsberg,
jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, Ncal Cassady, Lawrence Fcr
linghetti — have slipped out of the limelight or passed away, but
their literary work lives on, and more critical attention is being fo
cused on it now than ever before.
If you follow the whispers of the Beat writers through San Fran
cisco, you may be surprised by what you find. Though the roots
of the Beat generation are in New York, San Francisco is where
many of the writers found their soul.
The City Lights bookstore, founded in 1953 by Lawrence Fer
linghetti and Peter Martin, is one of the most powerful symbols
that the Beats left behind. The bookstore, one of the first in Amer
ica to specialize in quality paperbacks, devotes an entire room to
poetry and a special section to the Beats.
Ferlinghetti was friends with Ginsberg and many other Beat
