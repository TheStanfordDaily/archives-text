# Feel the Beat
## Whispers of lost generation echo in the City's bookstores 
### Frank Quaratiello 
Bookstores arc a wellspring of inspiration and a final resting
place for literature of old. The stories, poems and words
filed away on their shelves divide time rhythmically and
mark changes.
In San Francisco, there is a wide variety of bookstores where
the tales of countless generations whisper like the rustle of pages.
And the whispers of the Beat generation are louder than most.
Reflecting backward and echoing forward, the Beat writers offer
a captivating vision of the world that is still relevant today.
Many of the generation's prominent figures — Allen Ginsberg,
jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, Ncal Cassady, Lawrence Fcr
linghetti — have slipped out of the limelight or passed away, but
their literary work lives on, and more critical attention is being fo
cused on it now than ever before.
If you follow the whispers of the Beat writers through San Fran
cisco, you may be surprised by what you find. Though the roots
of the Beat generation are in New York, San Francisco is where
many of the writers found their soul.
The City Lights bookstore, founded in 1953 by Lawrence Fer
linghetti and Peter Martin, is one of the most powerful symbols
that the Beats left behind. The bookstore, one of the first in Amer
ica to specialize in quality paperbacks, devotes an entire room to
poetry and a special section to the Beats.

writers. It was City Lights press that published Ginsberg's poem
"Howl" and several Beat books.
In the little corner poetry room, the Beats take their rightful
place next to other great poets and writers. There arc a table and
two chairs where I sat and read under the watchful eye of a large
photo of Walt Whitman.
Through the window, the background of Broadway's sex-for
sale district seemed a fitting background as I read the wild adven
tures of the Beats.
But something wasn't quite right. The stark contrasts, drinking
and whoring coupled with spirituality and appreciation for life,
don't speak as strongly to our own even-keel generation of Miata
owning yuppies.
Downstairs, reading through the pages of philosophy books
and plays, I heard bums screaming poetry in the alleys behind the
store. Everyone else ignored them.
Is that what happened to the Beat generation? I wondered.
But when I went outside the poetry had stopped, the bums were
gone and all I heard was the barking of a stray dog.

A man on the street will still read
you poems from the Haight-
Ashbury Literary Journal if you buy
a copy from him. But everybody
has something to sell and seems
self-consciously hip.

So I went somewhere else, following the whispers to the
Haight-Ashbury district. Here one-of-a-kind bookstores like Great
Expectations, a rock 'n' roll bookstore with T-shirts along the ceil
ing, and the Anarchist Collective bookstore seem anachronistic.
Like museums, they offer visions and dreams of struggling gener
ations of the past.
There are still characters on the streets — people who seem to
have walked off the pages of Beat books. A man on the street will
still read you poems from the Haight-Ashbury Literary Journal if
you buy a copy from him. But everybody has something to sell
and everything seems self-consciously hip.
Other stores in the City sell books in different languages, and
of course there are stores that sell conventional works you could
find at Kepler's and Printer's Inc. Used-book stores with high,
leaning stacks can be like those old boarded-up houses you and
your friends used to explore in hopes of finding forgotten trea
sures.
But if you are searching for the Beats themselves, you won't
find them. They have moved on. Their works still offer their vi
sion, and new books about their lives put that vision into perspec
tive. But a new literature concerned with today's issues — multi
culturalism, yuppiedom, homclessness, poverty, AIDS — has
emerged from the glowing embers of the Beat writers' work to
thrive in San Francisco.
In some of these newer works, you hear the echo of the Beats
and the more distant echoes of the Beats' sources — William
Blake, William Carlos Williams and others. It is the steady drip
drop of literature into the calm pool of human existence. It di
vides time and keeps sending ripples ever outward to the edges.
