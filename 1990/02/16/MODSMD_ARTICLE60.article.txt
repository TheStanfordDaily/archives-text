# Visit San Francisco's revival movie houses and
## Live the movie 
### Ted Wong 
Commercial movie theaters are a lot like airports.
Mere departure points, airports exist for you to
leave them, and the time you spend there is kept
as short and painless as possible. The corporate
version of natural selection has shaped air travel into the
quickest, most efficient means of traveling long distances.
And the most antiseptic.
Many theaters work tfit* same way. Since their purpose
is solely to launch you to wherever the movie takes place,
the theaters themselves might as well be invisible. As long
as the lights are out, the audience is happy.
Architei ture at these cinemas is at best generic, like at
AMC. Old Mill and Palo Alto Square, and at worst, cloned
and artificial, as any body who has been to one of the Cen
tury cinemas knows. This kind of theater is designed to
move as many cola drinking, popcorn-pounding cus
tomers past its screens as possible. The only draw is the
movie itself, and companies that run these theaters base
their choices primarily on profit potential.
