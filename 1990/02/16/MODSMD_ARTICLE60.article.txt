# Visit San Francisco's revival movie houses and
## Live the movie 
### Ted Wong 
Commercial movie theaters are a lot like airports.
Mere departure points, airports exist for you to
leave them, and the time you spend there is kept
as short and painless as possible. The corporate
version of natural selection has shaped air travel into the
quickest, most efficient means of traveling long distances.
And the most antiseptic.
Many theaters work tfit* same way. Since their purpose
is solely to launch you to wherever the movie takes place,
the theaters themselves might as well be invisible. As long
as the lights are out, the audience is happy.
Architei ture at these cinemas is at best generic, like at
AMC. Old Mill and Palo Alto Square, and at worst, cloned
and artificial, as any body who has been to one of the Cen
tury cinemas knows. This kind of theater is designed to
move as many cola drinking, popcorn-pounding cus
tomers past its screens as possible. The only draw is the
movie itself, and companies that run these theaters base
their choices primarily on profit potential.

Of course, commercial theaters play an important role for
movie industry and audience alike. For one thing, they have kept
Hollywood from folding under the juggernaut of television.
A few producers of big-budget films coming out of Hollywood
these days actually deserve the ridiculous fortunes they make
from their movies. Steven Spielberg, for one, has proven a master
storyteller, and living in a huge house with Amy Irving makes his
work no less valid.
But if you seek a human rather than a corporate experience in
moviegoing, there are several San Francisco cinemas you should
not miss. Imagine a theater where your vacation from the toils
and turmoils of Stanford life does not end with the rolling of the
credits. Imagine watching a movie in an environment, a world
where film, theater and even neighborhood mix to create a cine
matic experience that includes far more than just what's on the
screen.

Imagine a theater where your vaca
tion from the toils and turmoils of
Stanford life does not end with the
rolling of the credits. Imagine
watching a movie in an 'environ-
ment,' a world where film, theater
and even neighborhood mix to cre
ate a cinematic experience that in
cludes far more than just what's on
the screen.

Such theaters, called revival houses or rep (for repertory) the
aters, are to commercial cinemas what the railroads are to air
travel. The adage that getting there is half the fun applies as
strongly to seeing movies as it does to travel.
Two things make rail travel different from flying. The first is
speed. Though trains can take days to get to places just a few
hours away by plane, you see more along the way, and on a ter
restrial level instead of from a perspective that only birds and me
teorologists understand.
Most of the revival houses in the Bay Area, with the notable ex
ception of the Stanford Theatre on University Avenue in Palo
Alto, are in San Francisco. But, like the sights you see from the
window of a train, the chance to visit some of the City's most in
teresting neighborhoods more than makes up for the inconve
nience of the trip. Since revival houses specialize in screening "al
ternative" cinema, such as foreign films, underground and inde
pendent productions, and art films, these theaters thrive in neigh
borhoods which are about as far in atmosphere from Palo Alto as
David Lynch is from Alan Alda.
The romance of rail travel also sets it apart from flying. Rail
roads have a cultural history, a context woven around them by
everyone from Paul Theroux to Arlo Guthrie. On a train, the
wheels clack along the rails, America rolls by and getting there
transcends the necessary evil that air travel has made it.
Cinema, too, works best in a cultural context. It's impossible to
mistake a rep theater for one of its corporate-owned commercial
cousins. A revival house is a place for exchange between people,
rather than between a corporation and a moviegoing public. Rep
theaters often express their social consciousness by screening rel
evant films or by donating a night's proceeds to a cause. The fla
vor of the neighborhood and the often whimsical tastes of the
management invariably work their way into the theater, so each
house has a distinct personality.
The Castro Theatre on Castro and Market Streets is a comfort
able mix of commercial theater and revival house, a charat ter
which matches the eclectic neighborhood in which the cinema is
situated. You could leave the theater, stop by the Double Rain
bow for a benign ice cream cone and then drop by the Gauntlet
to get a nipple pierced.
The Castro's playlist consists mainly of old critical successes
like "Wings of Desire" and"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence,"
and also some Sunday Flicks fare such as "sex, lies, & videotape"
and "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown." The the
ater has been known to block off an entire week for a film festival.
Festivals range from the San Francisco International Lesbian and
Gay Film Festival to The Films of Fatty Arbuckle.
The York Theater, on 24th Street near Potrero, is owned by a
collective of seven members, who, besides choosing films and
handling finances, sell and take the tickets, vend food and drinks,
and run the projection booth. The York's playlist contains stan
dard revival stuff like "Ran" and "Psycho," recent foreign releases
including "A Zed and Two Noughts," "Popul Vuh" and "Mr. Uni
verse," and hokey but fun flicks such as "Repulsion" and"The
Surfer Girls in 3-D."
The York stands in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood
and has a reputation for showing good films on Latino culture
such as "Diego Rivera: I Paint What I See" and "Frida." If you can
judge from the number of minority and social-issue films, includ
ing Shohei Imamura's "The Insect Woman," "Malcolm X" and
"Through the Wire," the owners of the York believe in film's role
as a social force.

It's impossible to mistake a rep the
ater for one of its corporate-owned
cousins. A revival house is a place
for exchange between people,
rather than between a corporation
and a moviegoing public.

The collective that owns the York also has another theater, the
Red Vic. Though the Red Vic is closed now, the owners plan to
reopen it at a new location on Haight Street near Golden Gate
Park. The playlist is similar to that of the York, but since the Vic is
in the Haight, it has a reputation of being somewhat more chal
lenging. Both the Red Vic and the York serve popcorn in wooden
bowls, with either butter or yeast on top. You should at least try
the yeast, if only to discover that you never want to taste it again.
Collective members also take turns baking homemade cookies
for the audience.
Whether it is hidden truth or just fun that you seek, watching
a movie in one of the City's revival houses offers pleasure and
power not to lie found elsewhere.
