# NORTH BEACH
## Bars, Beatniks and the best calzone in the City 
### Jamie Collette 
Surfers, be warned: North Beach is no more a beach than
Lagunita is a lake. A journey to North Beach will bring you
not to the water's edge, but to one of San Francisco's old
est neighborhoods, spanning the area between Telegraph
and Russian hills.
The beach that gave this historical area its name disappeared
when landfill was dumped into the Bay to expand the district. So
leave your boards at home, and bring your ID and a pocketful of
money instead.

Known as San Francisco's "Little Italy," North Beach is also as
sociated with the Beatnik era of the 19505. Along with Greenwich
Village and Venice Beach, North Beach became one of the three
poles around which the Beatnik movement revolved.
Artists, writers and musicians drawn to this town-within-a-city
brought additional color to the area. Barbara Streisand and Jack
Kerouac began their careers here.
Famous today for its thriving nightlife, North Beach is no
longer dominated by its Italian heritage or by the Beatnik influ
ence, but their flavor lingers.
The past figures prominently in the atmosphere of several


Hilary Smith Daily
North Beach establishments.
At Vesuvio, a bar across from
the renowned City Lights
Bookstore, you can kick off the
evening with a beer amid the
same prints, posters and map
tables that surrounded Jack
London and Mark Twain.
Other hangouts like the
nearby Caffe Tosca and the
Bohemian Cigar Store, though
dating back to other eras, con
tinue to be centers for thinkers
and drinkers of all ages. Chica
go and Texas blues still re
sound within the walls of The
Grant and Green and a few
neighboring clubs.
The City's best calzone are
pulled from the ovens of
Tomasso's Famous Pizzeria, a
hole in the wall tucked away
from the porn shops on
Kearny.
Recent years have brought
new spice to the 1 area. On
Columbus Street, the "main
drag" of North Beach, authen
tic thin-crust Italian pizza can
be found in the upbeat, neon
lit Calzone's, where indoor
seating along the sidewalks
suggests a European-style pen
chant for people-watching.
Caffe Roma is a popular
late-night spot for espresso
and small pizzas. Because of
its early closing hours, I have
yet to discover whether Caffe
Puccini across the street really
plays Puccini. But the lively
Caffe Greco next door stays
open late, serves tasty veg
etable tortus, good desserts
and coffees, and is always full
of people.
For non-coffee drinkers,
Gelato on Union is not far, and
just around the corner you can
gather on the outdoor patio of
the ever-bustling Savoy Tivoli
or browse in the crazy post
card store across the street.
Once in the shop, you may
never leave.
The same goes for North
Beach. Once familiar with its
secrets, surprises and neigh
borhood charm, you won't
want to leave it either.
