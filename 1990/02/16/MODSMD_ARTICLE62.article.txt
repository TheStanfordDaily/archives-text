# NEON NIGHTS SOUTH OF MARKET
## 
### Liz Lempert 
Tired of the dorm parties at Flo Mo? Sick of fro yo at the CoPo? Had
enough of the nightlife under the shadow of Moo Tow? Then maybe
you're ready to get off the Farm and experience the excitement of a new
abbreviation: SoMa.
Until 10 years ago, San Francisco's South of Market District (hence,
SoMa) was known primarily for its warehouses. But now many of the warehouses
have been converted into roomy nightclubs, restaurants and even hip laundromats.
Folsom Street, between 7th and 11th, contains many of area's trendiest hangouts
all within walking distance of each other.
Start at Julie's Supper Club, a bar and restaurant with '50s
overtones located on the corner of 7th and Folsom. Though
known for its martinis, Julie's Italian-Californian cuisine deserves
praises of its own.
Served by waiters dripping with Dcp and waitresses sporting
beehives, Julie's patrons may sometimes feel they've been trans
ported to the backstage of a B-52s concert.
Trendiness, however, comes at a price. Julie's is almost always
packed with people — a 45-minute wait for dinner is the norm
— but you can sit or stand at the bar while you wait.
Squeeze through the crowds at the front bar and grab a drink
in the aquatic theme room in back. Larger-than-life plaster mar
lins and other replicas of sea creatures dominate the turquoise
decor.
Just a few doors down from Julie's is the less-crowded, more
intimate Eddie Jacks Restaurant and Cafe, located at 1151 Fol
som. The food is more exotic than Julie's (you can order cous
cous), more expensive (entrees start at $16), and not as good.
Directly upstairs is the Tap Room Bar, a great place to find a
dark corner and take a break from the crowds. The mood in the
Tap Room Bar is mod and sophisticated — you may feel more at
home if you're wearing black.

]ulie's patrons may feel they've
been transported to the backstage
of a B-52s concert.

Doing laundry may not be high up on your list of must-do ac
tivitics in the City, but Brain Wash at 1122 Folsom may chang(
your mind.
It's a combination cafc-laundromat, which enables you to sif
espresso sty lishly while watching over your machine to make sure
no one steals your socks.
Hamburger Mary's, at 1582 Folsom, offers more standard fare
in a non-standard atmosphere. Their hamburgers are rumored tc
be among the best in the City, but you may have to wait to get z
table.
In addition to the food, the decor at Hamburger Mary's sets
this restaurant-bar apart. The collection of road signs and trinkets
on its walls rivals that of the Stanford Band Shak.
Folsom is also home to several dance bars. Most are dark and
mod, scummy but fun.
The prominent feature at The Oasis (11th and Folsom) is its
dance-floor — a swimming pool with a Plexiglass covering. But in
order to dance on the water, and even to get inside the club, you
must be 21.
The Oasis plays mainly modern rock music, as does the Par
adise Lounge, which is located directly across the street. Paradise
Lounge sports a split level dance floor and pool tables in back.
Paradise Lounge wins the distinction of being the darkest of
the SoMa dance clubs — quite a feat considering the competi
tion. It is also one of the smokiest clubs in the area, so stay away
if you have an aversion to cigarettes.
From the exterior, Holy Cow, at 1535 Folsom, has the potential
of setting itself apart from the rest of the Folsom dance-bar scene.
A large plastic cow hangs from the sign outside its door, and a siz
able crowd of people are usually waiting to get inside.
Once inside, however, Holy Cow is nothing but disappointing.
Its sticky beer-covered floors and flesh-pressing crowds make me
think of a USC frat party, even though I've never been to one.
