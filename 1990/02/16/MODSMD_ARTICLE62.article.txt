# NEON NIGHTS SOUTH OF MARKET
## 
### Liz Lempert 
Tired of the dorm parties at Flo Mo? Sick of fro yo at the CoPo? Had
enough of the nightlife under the shadow of Moo Tow? Then maybe
you're ready to get off the Farm and experience the excitement of a new
abbreviation: SoMa.
Until 10 years ago, San Francisco's South of Market District (hence,
SoMa) was known primarily for its warehouses. But now many of the warehouses
have been converted into roomy nightclubs, restaurants and even hip laundromats.
Folsom Street, between 7th and 11th, contains many of area's trendiest hangouts
all within walking distance of each other.
