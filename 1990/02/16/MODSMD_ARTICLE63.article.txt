# Tall tales of high hills
## Gripmen recount rocky rides and cable fables 
### Lisa Nellor 
Though often thought of as a touristy
thing to do, riding a cable car
through the streets of San Francisco
can bring an entirely new perspective to
the city.
Two dollars will buy you not only two
hours of riding pleasure, but also an un
forgettable tour of San Francisco. Instead
of having to comb the curbsides for a
parking spot, taking the cable car - at
the leisurely pace of 9.5 mph â€” allows
you to enjoy your ride through the City.
