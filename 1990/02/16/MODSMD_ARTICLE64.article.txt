"It gets funny sometimes," he said with
a smile. "Anything can happen."
You could even meet your future
spouse on a cable car. Al Grimaud, who
has been conducting the cable cars for 12
years, did just that. I le was driving and she
was riding. When they came to the end (if
the line at Fisherman's Wharf, "I asked her
out for a cup of coffee, and we've been to
gether since," he said.
They recently tied the knot while riding
on the very cable car that brought them
together.
This kind of event doesn't happen every
day, but taking the cable car is still a fun
way to explore San [~rancisco.
The cable cars have no motors of their
own. Instead, they are pulled along by an
underground steel-and-rope cable that
works similarly to a ski tow rope. That's
like a giant pair of pliers grabbing a moving
steel cable and pulling a 20,000 pound
car loaded with about 60 passengers up
one of San Francisco's big hills. Not shabby
for the world's oldest cable car system.
There are three different sets of cables
traversing the city: the California Street
line, the Powell-Hyde line, and the Pow
ell-Mason line. Together these routes take
you to the most popular and well-known
areas of San Francisco.

The California Street line begins in the
financial district, near the Embarcadero
BART station.
"Next stop, Chinatown!" the gripman
yells as the car passes the wide assortment
of restaurants and shops of this distinctive
area.
Just a couple of blocks down, the Cali
fornia line crosses the Powell-Mason line,
which originates near the Powell Street
BART station on Market. Since a ticket al
lows you to get on and off as often as you
want, this is a good spot to pick up a car
heading north to the wharf area.
"Next stop, the Cable Car Barn!" The
Barn, located at the corner of Mason and
Washington Streets, houses the Cable Car
Museum and .ill the controls for the oper
ating lines. The Museum is free, open to
the public during the week, and provides
visitors with a glimpse of what goes on be
neath the rails.
Pick up the car again, and you can
coast over to the t lyde Street line which
travels through residential Russian Mill and
past the windy Lombard Street.
"The end of the line, Fisherman's
Wharf!" At this end, as well as at Union
Station, the single-ended cars are turned
around on a giant turntable which enables
them to begin their trips back through the
city.

The cars have been traveling these
paths for a long time. First installed in San
Francisco in 1873, the cable car was the
first practical mechanical street transporta
tion. By 1894 the system had expanded to
include 103 miles of track.
The earthquake of 1906 ended most
cable car traffic, but San Franciscans soon
found that nothing else was capable of
carrying people over the enormous hills,
so some of the lines were rebuilt.
The San Francisco cable car system was
written into the (ity < harter in the 19505,
and in 1964 it was designated as America's
only moving national landmark.
The only operating cable car system in
the world, San Franc isco's lines were com
pletely renovated in the 1980s to prepare
for another century of use. About 26 cars
now run daily.
Loville said he can always spot the
freeloaders who are "riding free and feel
ing guilty" tor not paying. But despite such
minor hassles, he and most cable car
drivers really love the job.
"It's neat to drive the world's only mov
ing historical monument," said loville.
"I plan on retiring in this job," l.oville
said. "And after I retire, I might oven c ome
back and do it for free. I enjoy it that
much."

visitors with a glimpse of what goes on be
neath the rails.
Pick up the car again, and you can
coast over to the t lyde Street line which
travels through residential Russian Mill and
past the windy Lombard Street.
"The end of the line, Fisherman's
Wharf!" At this end, as well as at Union
Station, the single-ended cars are turned
around on a giant turntable which enables
them to begin their trips back through the
city.

The cars have been traveling these
paths for a long time. First installed in San
Francisco in 1873, the cable car was the
first practical mechanical street transporta
tion. By 1894 the system had expanded to
include 103 miles of track.
The earthquake of 1906 ended most
cable car traffic, but San Franciscans soon
found that nothing else was capable of
carrying people over the enormous hills,
so some of the lines were rebuilt.
The San Francisco cable car system was
written into the (ity < harter in the 19505,
and in 1964 it was designated as America's
only moving national landmark.
The only operating cable car system in
the world, San Franc isco's lines were com
pletely renovated in the 1980s to prepare
for another century of use. About 26 cars
now run daily.
Loville said he can always spot the
freeloaders who are "riding free and feel
ing guilty" tor not paying. But despite such
minor hassles, he and most cable car
drivers really love the job.
"It's neat to drive the world's only mov
ing historical monument," said loville.
"I plan on retiring in this job," l.oville
said. "And after I retire, I might oven c ome
back and do it for free. I enjoy it that
much."
