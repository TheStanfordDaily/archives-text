## Hiking up the down staircase of Lyon Street 
### Liz Lempert 
From the top, it offers a breathtaking
view of the City. From the bottom, it
presents a literally breath-taking
hike back up to the summit.
Lyon Street is San Francisco at its best
Iâ€” a spectacular view, a cool sea breeze,
find a hide-away from the tourists.
| As it intersects Broadway, Lyon Street
closes itself off from auto traffic and turns
Into a grand staircase to the Bay.
I With the Presidio, San Francisco's euca
lyptus-lined naval base, directly to the left
and hints of the downtown skyline peak
ing over mansions to the right, Lyon Street
Otters one of the best vistas in the City.

Below lies the Marina district with its
boxy, whitewashed houses and red-tiled
roofs. And the jewel of the Marina, the
Palace of Fine Arts, sparkles in the distance
against a backdrop of sailboats and ferries.
Descending the stairs, you can catch a
glimpse of Alcatraz, the infamous prison is
land, to your right.
The Lyon Street staircase, encased in a
garden of flowers, begins in the tony
neighborhood of Pacific Heights, home of
San Francisco's richest and most powerful
players, including gubernatorial candidate
Dianne Feinstein and lawyer Melvin Belli.
Halfway down the staircase, the stairs
descend into a courtyard in front of the
reigning mansion of Lyon Street, a tan

brick Italian villa flying a largo French flag
out its side window.
Rich but not ostentatious, this home
keeps its distance from the public with
signs in French and English making it clear
that it is a private residence.
The lions of Lyon Street, two copper
turned-green statues, watch over the
courtyard, which boasts a fountain and a
rose garden.
The stairs descend for five steep blocks,
eventually dropping you smack on the
doorstep of the Palace of Fine Arts, the
majestic Romanesque building that houses
the Exploratorium, a hands-on science
museum.
The museum features innovative dis-

plays that enliven the basic concepts of physics, chemistry and
biology. It's a must-see for scientists and fuzzies alike, but if
you're in the mood to be in the fresh air, a stroll around the out
side of the building is also well worth the trip.
Only a skeleton of the original structure designed by Bernard
Maybeck for the Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1915 now re
mains. But the gray-green rotunda and buff and ochre Corinthi
an columns are perhaps even more enchanting in their hol
lowed-out state.
A dirt path winds along a duck pond and under the arches of
the dome. These grounds would be the perfect spot for a picnic
if it weren't for the cooing pigeons that strut their stuff here. Still,
many people try to enjoy their lunch despite the aggressive scav
engers who take bites out of your sandwich even without being
offered.
)ust one more block brings you to the foot of the Bay. When
you stand at the edge of the St. Francis Yacht Club, the Golden
Gate Bridge is almost close enough to touch. Neon flashes of
windsurfers skim the water and occasionally roll up onto the
shore.
It is a lucky accident that Lyon Street remains one of San Fran
cisco's lesser-known treasures. Parking is ample near the top of
the staircase and on Lyon itself before the street closes to auto
traffic. But you can avoid the street's precipitous drop by parking
on the less-hilly Broadway instead.
Remember to pack a sweatshirt. Icy gusts from the Bay sweep
straight up the stairs. If they aren't dressed warmly enough, even
the most enchanted visitors will find their body and spirit chilled
by the wind.
