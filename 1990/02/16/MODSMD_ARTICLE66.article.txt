# ON THE
## WATERFRONT It may be touristy and commercialized, but the City's shoreline offers history charm and a penny for a song 
### Sarah Laurence 
If you're wondering what makes San Francisco's waterfront
special, ask sidewalk sax player Rodney Byrd. "It's just like
everywhere else," Byrd says, "but they got water. The water
makes everything come to life."
Byrd, whose name evokes the legendary Charlie Parker ("But
he died on heroin; I won't," Byrd is quick to point out), plays on
the corner of Beach and Larkin Streets in front of Ghirardelli
Square's Boudin Bakery.
Byrd's tunes, ranging from the big band hit "In the Mood" to
the Mickey Mouse Club theme song, add much-needed spice to
the super-touristy Ghirardelli Square. Byrd's look is spicy too. The
flash of the gold tips on his shoes are enough to make you
ashamed of your drab Reeboks.
It's easy to pass a comfortable half-hour listening to Byrd from
the tables in front of Boudin, supposedly the City's first Trench
bakery Boudin serves creamy, flavorful clam chowder in a small

loaf of its famed Frcnch bread.
They also offer sandwiches
named after various San Fran
cisco districts. And Italian so
das. And espresso.
Sound too good to be true?
It is. Boudin's logo boasts 1849
as the bakery's year of estab
lishment, and its walls bear
black-and-white prints of Mrs.
Isidore Boudin, the bakery's
founder.
But the building itself can't
be more than a few years old,

and a stroll cast along the water, past Boudin carts selling bread
and pastries, reveals that this caf6 isn't the Boudin Bakery. It's a
Boudin Bakery. Like everything within a few blocks of Fisherman's
Wharf except the water and Rodney Byrd, Boudin is franchised.
If you're seeking something real in this area, you have to look
hard, or all you'll find is commercialism wrapped in a skimpy
cloak of history. Take Ghirardelli Square. Though this brick com
plex at one time manufactured bliss (some people call it choco
late), the square's walls now enclose nothing more exquisite than

the pretty penny its stores lift daily from hapless Midwesterners.
Why even bother to visit San Francisco if all you'll find are The
Sharper Image, Ann Taylor and other shops that have second
homes in commercial bastions as far-flung as Tokyo, Moscow and
the Stanford Shopping Center?
The worst atrocity lining the square's courtyard is the Ghi
rardelli shop itself. To buy a cone or sundae, you have to fill out
an order form and then stand in line for 20 minutes. Or, if you're
in a hurry, go to Ghirardelli's candy store next door, where you
only have to wait for 1 5 minutes.
Whichever path you choose, you will at some point find your
self standing between amusement-park style railings, the kind
that always make me feel like a cow being led to the slaughter.
The only difference from Great America is that the railings here
are brass-colored instead of chrome. Now that's elegance.
The chocolate itself is good, though not too special, since you
can buy it from the Stanford Bookstore at similarly inflated prices.
Besides an inner wrapper that looks deceptively like one of Willy

Wonka's golden tickets, the
milk chocolate bar with al
monds is far from disappoint
ing.
In all, unless you've spent
your whole life on a farm — or,
more probably, in a library stall
at The Farm — Chirardelli
Square offers little that you
haven't seen before. Though
fascinating from an anthropo
logical standpoint, the square
doesn't have much to offer in
connection with present-day

San Francisco.
If it weren't for the saving grace of the water, the same would
go for Fisherman's Wharf. Pier 39 suffers blights ranging from a
Kodak film center to a multi-media oddity called The San Francis
co Experience, a place that claims it can simulate earthquakes.
But the pier is wonderfully bearable because bay wavelets lap
it on three sides. And of this region's two pervading scents — the
smell of fish and the smell of out-of-towners — the former man-
