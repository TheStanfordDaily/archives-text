# ON THE
## WATERFRONT It may be touristy and commercialized, but the City's shoreline offers history charm and a penny for a song 
### Sarah Laurence 
If you're wondering what makes San Francisco's waterfront
special, ask sidewalk sax player Rodney Byrd. "It's just like
everywhere else," Byrd says, "but they got water. The water
makes everything come to life."
Byrd, whose name evokes the legendary Charlie Parker ("But
he died on heroin; I won't," Byrd is quick to point out), plays on
the corner of Beach and Larkin Streets in front of Ghirardelli
Square's Boudin Bakery.
Byrd's tunes, ranging from the big band hit "In the Mood" to
the Mickey Mouse Club theme song, add much-needed spice to
the super-touristy Ghirardelli Square. Byrd's look is spicy too. The
flash of the gold tips on his shoes are enough to make you
ashamed of your drab Reeboks.
It's easy to pass a comfortable half-hour listening to Byrd from
the tables in front of Boudin, supposedly the City's first Trench
bakery Boudin serves creamy, flavorful clam chowder in a small

loaf of its famed Frcnch bread.
They also offer sandwiches
named after various San Fran
cisco districts. And Italian so
das. And espresso.
Sound too good to be true?
It is. Boudin's logo boasts 1849
as the bakery's year of estab
lishment, and its walls bear
black-and-white prints of Mrs.
Isidore Boudin, the bakery's
founder.
But the building itself can't
be more than a few years old,

and a stroll cast along the water, past Boudin carts selling bread
and pastries, reveals that this caf6 isn't the Boudin Bakery. It's a
Boudin Bakery. Like everything within a few blocks of Fisherman's
Wharf except the water and Rodney Byrd, Boudin is franchised.
If you're seeking something real in this area, you have to look
hard, or all you'll find is commercialism wrapped in a skimpy
cloak of history. Take Ghirardelli Square. Though this brick com
plex at one time manufactured bliss (some people call it choco
late), the square's walls now enclose nothing more exquisite than

the pretty penny its stores lift daily from hapless Midwesterners.
Why even bother to visit San Francisco if all you'll find are The
Sharper Image, Ann Taylor and other shops that have second
homes in commercial bastions as far-flung as Tokyo, Moscow and
the Stanford Shopping Center?
The worst atrocity lining the square's courtyard is the Ghi
rardelli shop itself. To buy a cone or sundae, you have to fill out
an order form and then stand in line for 20 minutes. Or, if you're
in a hurry, go to Ghirardelli's candy store next door, where you
only have to wait for 1 5 minutes.
Whichever path you choose, you will at some point find your
self standing between amusement-park style railings, the kind
that always make me feel like a cow being led to the slaughter.
The only difference from Great America is that the railings here
are brass-colored instead of chrome. Now that's elegance.
The chocolate itself is good, though not too special, since you
can buy it from the Stanford Bookstore at similarly inflated prices.
Besides an inner wrapper that looks deceptively like one of Willy

Wonka's golden tickets, the
milk chocolate bar with al
monds is far from disappoint
ing.
In all, unless you've spent
your whole life on a farm — or,
more probably, in a library stall
at The Farm — Chirardelli
Square offers little that you
haven't seen before. Though
fascinating from an anthropo
logical standpoint, the square
doesn't have much to offer in
connection with present-day

San Francisco.
If it weren't for the saving grace of the water, the same would
go for Fisherman's Wharf. Pier 39 suffers blights ranging from a
Kodak film center to a multi-media oddity called The San Francis
co Experience, a place that claims it can simulate earthquakes.
But the pier is wonderfully bearable because bay wavelets lap
it on three sides. And of this region's two pervading scents — the
smell of fish and the smell of out-of-towners — the former man-

ages to dominate.
That's what Byrd was talking about
when he remarked that the source of this
area's magic is that "they got water." Im
mune to construction, if not to pollution,
the Bay washes serenity and beauty onto
even the seediest of shorelines.
In addition to water, Fisherman's
Wharf offers the unique opportunity of a
visit to Alcatraz Island, a source of dark
magic as potent as the water's benign in
fluence. Nicknamed Devil's Island, the
Rock has been a pocket of hell since the
day it burst through the water's surface.
The Spaniards named it La Isla de los
Alcatraces — the Island of the Pelicans.
Which proves that this boulder was de
monic even before anyone set foot on it.
Pelicans are scary critters.
Not content just to lie huge, these birds
are also among the ugliest of Cod's crea
tures. When they take off, beating the air
with their piston wings, you can't help
thinking that if the sky doesn't fall in
protest, these monsters will certainly
knock it down.
For better or for worse, Alcatraz's peli
cans appear to have flown the coop just as
surely as its convicts have. The water birds
and jailbirds have been replaced by a
third type of feathered friend, the fowl
tourist.

It's a toss-up whether the penitentiary
was more infernal during its operating
years than it is now. At least back then it
was blatantly evil. Today, when you can
buy a photo of yourself standing in front
of the island next to a life-size cut-out of
Madonna or George Bush, the good, the
bad and the ugly (i.e. you, Madonna and
Bush, in that order) can no longer be sep
arated.

But any questions today's Alcatraz
might rdise dissolve when you gaze across
the mile-and-a-quarter to the island. The
Rock's fog erases all sentiment except a
grey dread to match its own aspect.
Anyone interested in witnessing a land
scape with an aura should not pass up a
visit to Alcatraz. Though one-way tickets
to the island used to be available, if not
desirable, for free, Attorney General

Robert Kennedy ended that practice by
closing the penitentiary in 1963.
These days the round trip from Pier 41
costs five bucks. Three more dollars will
secure you a Walkman tour narrated by
former convicts and wardens.
It's a good idea to book ferry tickets in
advance through Ticketron. Also, give
yourself three hours for the trip. If that
seems like too large a chunk of the after
noon, remember that the privilege of vis
iting Alcatraz used to take up a lifetime.
West of the physical prison of Alcatraz
and the spiritual prison of Fisherman's
Wharf, the Marina Green presents an airy,
untainted stretch of shore. Though badly
shaken last Oct. 1 7, the Marina district re
mains untouched by commercialism.
The Marina's part-rock, part-sand coast
presents a stretch of accessible bayshore,
a rarity in San Francisco. \ lere you can en
joy real seaside pastimes like looking at
boats, gulls and even the fog-filled Golden
Gate Bridge off to the left.
We are lucky that Rodney I3yrd brings
honesty to Ghirardelli Square and that Al
catraz, in its perverse way, adds interest to
Fisherman's Wharf. But if you're truly after
a taste of the coast, skip these spots and
head straight for the Marina. This is one of
the few places where a shore is still a
shore.
