# Loving it, Haight-ing it
## Take a stroll through time in a walk down Haight Street 
### Sophie Romillat 
For people who would like a chance to re
live, at least for a couple of hours, the '60s
and '70s, the anachronistic Haight Ash
bury district in San Francisco is the place to
visit.
Centered at the crossing of Haight and Ash
bury Streets in the southwestern part of town, this
unforgettable area is best experienced by walking
the few blocks west on Haight Street from Mason
ic Avenue to Golden Gate Park.
Boutiques with intricate stained glass windows
line Haight Street. Their merchandise, from old
fashioned clothes to costume jewelry and col
lectibles, recalls bygone decades. Even for those
too young to remember the '60s and '70s, this
district affords the rare opportunity to borrow the
spirit of these eras.
People who frequent the Haight are as colorful
and old-fashioned as the shops. You will see men
dressed and coiffed like Jesus Christ and red
haired women wrapped in long purple dresses
and Indian scarves. But neo-hippies by no means
monopolize the streets. They share their turf with
men dressed in leather and sporting punk hair
dos. You also see people who defy categorization,
like one old lady with platinum blond hair, tie
dyed clothes, funky rings on her fingers and a
peacock feather adorning her wheelchair.
Haight Street itself is captivating. Graffiti like
"legalize pot and abolish money" covers the
walls, and musicians play acid rock, soul or jazz
music on every corner. I met one keyboard player
who reminded me of Ray Charles. He agreed to
let me take his picture, but as I was aiming my
camera, a woman walked in front of him. I asked
her to move, and she said, "He's my husband. If
you want a picture of him, you'll have to take a

picture of both of us." So that's what I had to do.
You may also comc across aspiring poets sell
ing their work on the street. These people will
read you lengthy passages of their product in
hopes of awakening your interest or at least mak
ing you feel guilty. There are also sidewalk artists
who will sketch portraits that are flattering, if not
entirely realistic.
The best pastime of all is to observe the
denizens of this unique region. The hippies'
dress, as well as their slow way of talking and
moving, will surprise you.
These people believe that love can save the
world. But unlike the hippies of past decades,
they are listless, and their philosophy is no longer
new. Their fashion isn't either.
If you like what you see, take advantage of the
many shops on Haight Street that specialize in
'60s garb. If you prefer more modern clothes,
you'll find shops that carry motorcycle leathers,
skin-tight tops and fluorescent leggings.

These people believe that
they can save the world.
But unlike the hippies of
the past, they are listless,
and their philosophy is no
longer new.

These places carry patchwork jackets, hand
maid jewelry, T-shirts decorated with pictures and
witticisms, tie-dyed clothes, Elvis regalia, multi
colored sneakers, bell-bottomed pants, records,
musical instruments and custom-painted leather
jackets. There are also a few buy, sell and trade
stores, so be sure to bring your parents' antiques.
Rollerbladcs will add speed, and maybe scabs,
to your visit. "5.0. H." (short tor Skates On Haight
— though, for beginners especially, the letters
"5.0.5." might be more fitting), situated at 1818
Haight, will rent blades for $6 an hour or $24 a
day. Look out: Rollerblading is harder than it ap
pears, and in a city as hilly as San Francisco, brak
ing is no small matter. You may find that roller
skates, slightly cheaper to rent than rollerbladcs,
are also easier to control.
Don't worry if you're hungry after this grueling
exercise. The Haight boasts many coffee shops,
grocery and health food stores and caf<ss.
Try the Night Break Cafe at 1827 Haight. There
is even a bowling alley next door for the rare per
son who still wants to stand up after a day of all
the Haight has to offer — people watching, shop
ping, sightseeing and flailing around these lively
streets with single rows of wheels attached to the
soles of your feet.

"legalize pot and abolish money" covers the
walls, and musicians play acid rock, soul or jazz
music on every corner. I met one keyboard player
who reminded me of Ray Charles. He agreed to
let me take his picture, but as I was aiming my
camera, a woman walked in front of him. I asked
her to move, and she said, "He's my husband. If
you want a picture of him, you'll have to take a

picture of both of us." So that's what I had to do.
You may also comc across aspiring poets sell
ing their work on the street. These people will
read you lengthy passages of their product in
hopes of awakening your interest or at least mak
ing you feel guilty. There are also sidewalk artists
who will sketch portraits that are flattering, if not
entirely realistic.
The best pastime of all is to observe the
denizens of this unique region. The hippies'
dress, as well as their slow way of talking and
moving, will surprise you.
These people believe that love can save the
world. But unlike the hippies of past decades,
they are listless, and their philosophy is no longer
new. Their fashion isn't either.
If you like what you see, take advantage of the
many shops on Haight Street that specialize in
'60s garb. If you prefer more modern clothes,
you'll find shops that carry motorcycle leathers,
skin-tight tops and fluorescent leggings.

These people believe that
they can save the world.
But unlike the hippies of
the past, they are listless,
and their philosophy is no

These places carry patchwork jackets, hand
maid jewelry, T-shirts decorated with pictures and
witticisms, tie-dyed clothes, Elvis regalia, multi
colored sneakers, bell-bottomed pants, records,
musical instruments and custom-painted leather
jackets. There are also a few buy, sell and trade
stores, so be sure to bring your parents' antiques.
Rollerbladcs will add speed, and maybe scabs,
to your visit. "5.0. H." (short tor Skates On Haight
— though, for beginners especially, the letters
"5.0.5." might be more fitting), situated at 1818
Haight, will rent blades for $6 an hour or $24 a
day. Look out: Rollerblading is harder than it ap
pears, and in a city as hilly as San Francisco, brak
ing is no small matter. You may find that roller
skates, slightly cheaper to rent than rollerbladcs,
are also easier to control.
Don't worry if you're hungry after this grueling
exercise. The Haight boasts many coffee shops,
grocery and health food stores and caf<ss.
Try the Night Break Cafe at 1827 Haight. There
is even a bowling alley next door for the rare per
son who still wants to stand up after a day of all
the Haight has to offer — people watching, shop
ping, sightseeing and flailing around these lively
streets with single rows of wheels attached to the
soles of your feet.
