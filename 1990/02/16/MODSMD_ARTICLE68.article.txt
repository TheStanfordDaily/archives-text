# Amorous adventures
## If Stanford doesn't satisfy your romantic appetite, take your heart to San Francisco 
### Greg Douglas 
It is a widespread rumor that Stanford men and women do
not design to involve themselves in romantic pursuits during
their college years. We all know that this is a myth. Deep
down, or maybe not so deep, we all desire the amorous at
tention of that sexy someone.
Overall, however, Stanford is not a very romantic place. Sure,
the view from the Foothills can he nice at night, but there have
been so many "incidents" up there that not even couples would
feel totally safe. Besides, having dry grass spike through your
c lothes as you sit in a pile of cow dung is enough to put off even
the most romantically inclined twosome.
So v\hat's the solution? Where do those few lucky Stanfordians
who actually have the chance to act upon their longings for love
go to fulfill them?
You might have drawn a clue from the theme of this publica
tion. San Francisco is the place to really indulge your romantic
appetites.
But before actually awakening your appetites on this amorous
adventure, make sure you arrive in the ( it\ during the daylight
hours. A ride on the CalTrain can be a relaxing way to get there.
Fairly inexpensive and offering time to cuddle and see the
scenery, the train beats fighting rush-hour traffic on the freeway.
How many people have been proposed to while stuck in a

bumper-to-bumper traffic jam?
No matter how you get there, make sure you go to the parks.
The Headlands just across the Golden Gate Bridge offer breath
taking vistas of the Pacific, the City and the bridge â€” all perfect
photo opportunities. Furthermore, there are many secluded
beaches or hilltops within walking distance where you and your
companion can sneak some quality kissing time, or just hold
hands and watch the sun fall into the ocean.
Another park possibility is Golden Gate Park in the city. Full of
tree-lined walkways and grassy lawns, this is a wonderful area to
take your super-significant other for a casual, holding-hands kind
of stroll where you can talk or kiss or both, though probably not
at the same time.
Another, more touristy possibility is to hit hot spots like Fisher
man's Wharf and Ghirardelli and Union Squares during the day.
Although these places will probably be swarming with out-of
towners, two individuals intent on fun and romance could have
a great time wandering in and out of all the cute little shops and
snacking on a variety of overpriced food.
But make sure not to eat too much because once you've both
worked up an appetite by walking around, it's time to hit a ro
mantic restaurant.
In the ranks of the City's romantic restaurants, Le Castel and
Ristorante Donatello stand tall.
Le Castel, a French restaurant managed and owned by Fritz
Frankel, combines the best of all facets of romance into a superb
dining experience. Subdued lighting, comfortable seats and
French-Moorish decor create a positively aphrodisiac environ
ment.
The service surpasses even such romantic ambiance. Frankel
himself greeted the patrons at each table, establishing the kind of
intimate owner-patron relationship that draws people back again
and again. The four-course meal was served without hurry, allow
ing us to really enjoy and savor our meal. Especially impressive
was the time allowed us to drink our wine and cleanse our
palates between the salad and the entrde, a delectable roast duck
cooked Alsatian style and served on a bed of sauerkraut with a
delicious brown sauce.
Across Europe and the City, Ristorante Donatello, a Mobil
four-star establishment, offers excellent service, ambiance and
food. Eive waiters in black tuxedoes greeted us as we arrived.
Others swiftly approached and took care of our every need.
The entries we ordered, befitting such a maritime town as San
Francisco, were an artfully presented Maine Lobster dish and a
healthy cut of grilled fresh swordfish.
Considering the well-known ability of chocolate to arouse af
fection at the very least, dessert is not to be missed. Try the white
chocolate mousse with raspberries in a raspberry sauce, or the
"chocolate salame," which consists of two slices of dark chocolate
with nuts that look like the specks in salami.
How do you wrap up an amazing amorous excursion? You
could relish the romance you've already had and return to Stan
ford, or you could find a little bed-and-breakfast place for snug
gling and cuddling through the morning in a cozy, romantic set
ting.
Secluded and serene, establishments such as the Archbishops
Mansion, White Swan Inn and the aptly named Bed and Break
fast Inn can supply the perfect conclusion to the perfect day. Al
though this treat will further deplete your funds by amounts rang
ing from $80 for a small room to $250 for a suite, there is no bet
ter way to round out your romantic experience than by spending
the night in a firelit room and waking up to breakfast in bed.
