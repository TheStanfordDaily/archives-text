It's hard to go wrong at the shiny silver
Fog City Diner on Battery Street, the at
mosphere is casual, and the menu, con
sisting of hearty appetizers, sandwiches,
salads and unusual entrees, is extensive
and creative. The bread sampler, club
sandwich and teriyaki chicken salad are
great.
On your way to a game at Candlestick
Park? Try stopping in China Basin first for a
juicy hamburger at The Ramp or the Mis
sion Rock Resort (breakfast and lunch
only). Generous servings, great fries, low
prices and blue jeans attract people to
these two hangouts.
You can also find a good burger at The
Balboa Cafe in the Bermuda Triangle.
This usually crowded restaurant is a good
starter to a hopping night on Union Street.
Musical chairs is the name of the game
at Seltzer City, at f>BB Bth Street, where
customers are asked to change seats with
every course. These dinners occur only
monthly, so be sure to make a reservation
if you're interested. Seltzer City's primary
attraction is its seltzer bar, offering 25 to
30 flavors every day. Connoisseurs of the
New York Egg Cream (a drink made with
whole milk, chocolate syrup and seltzer
water) won't find one this good even in
New York. If you're feeling bubbly, check
this place out. Breakfast and luncn only.
Caribbean
The exotic decor and menu of Miss
Pearl's Jam House, at 601 Eddy, are sure
to please. While this colorful restaurant is

popular for its unique dishes, the bar, fea
turing sling chairs, reggae music and fun
drinks, may draw an even larger crowd.
If you prefer a quieter atmosphere,
Cha £ha Cha Cafe at 1805 Haight Street
offers the exciting style of Miss Pearl's,
with less hustle and bustle.
Chinese
If you're in the Union Street area, Tien
Fu on Filmore is a great place to go. The
food is inexpensive, very good and not
greasy.
Yank Sing, at 425 Battery Street, fea
tures award-winning dim sum. The fast
moving trolleys of treats are sometimes
hard to catch, but consider that a blessing
unless you want to burst your belt buckle
at this amazing place.
There are lots of excellent Thai restau
rants in the area of Battery, Broadway and
Columbus Streets. Your best bet is just to
roam until you find a place that suits your
mood.
French
You can dine Trench-style at nearly any
hour at the snazzy, softly-lit L'Entrecote
de Paris, at 2032 Union Street. Artistic
lighting and piano music make this a
restaurant for a special night. It's roman
tic, but far from stuffy. The Entrecote set
menu — a petite salad, thinly sliced steak
and all the shoestring potatoes you can
cat for $16.95 — is optional, but you're
crazy not to order it. The chicken crepes
are delicious too. In case your love affair
with their garlic steak threatens to end
your love affair with you're date, don't de
spair. You can buy a jar of it on your way
out.

Indian
The spicy scent of succulent lamb,
seafood and chicken marinade from its
tandoori ovens fills the air at Caylord's in
Chirardelli Square. Pink linen and soft
music create romantic ambiance, but
Gaylord's is not cheap — expect to pay
around $40 for dinner for two.
Italian
For good calzone, house chianti and
special gourmet pizzas at fairly inexpen
sive prices, Olives on Scott below Lom
bard is a great bet. Roman murals on the
walls add to the charm of this place.
Pizzeria Uno, with locations at Fisher
man's Wharf and on Lombard in the Ma
rina, is a must-do for anyone who hasn't
already been there. Tasty Chicago-style
deep-dish pizza and a casual atmosphere
often make for a wait.
But waiting — on the corner of Grant
and Union outside the North Beach
Pizzeria — is the next best thing to this
restaurant's renowned yet inexpensive
pizza and pasta dishes. Parking in the area
is next to impossible, but the food and fun
you'll find at this bustling pizzeria make it
well worth the walk.
Also in North Beach is what one former
Stanford Italian professor considers the
most authentically Italian restaurant in
San Francisco. I he calzone at Tomasso's
Famous Pizzeria, at 1042 Kearny, come
straight from Italia. Don't be misled by the
"famous" part, however. Tomasso's is the
epitome of a hole in the wall, but all the
more of a find for its cozy, undiscovered
quality.
It you're spending an evening near the
Tmbarcadero, perhaps on your way to the
Punchline comedy club, II Fornaio on
Battery Street is a super all-around restau
rant with average-priced pastas, excellent
rotisserie chicken and pricier entrees.
High ceilings, wooden-booths and excel
lent food make this restaurant appropriate
for both formal and informal occasions.
Delicious pasta, the freshest ingredi
ents and great atmosphere continue to
make Ciao, at 230 Jackson, one of San
Francisco's most successful restaurants.
Don't miss this one.
Middle Eastern
If you're willing to drift from the beaten
path, a trip to Mamounia's Moroccan
Restaurant, at 4411 Balboa Street, is the
way to go. Though the optional set menu
is not cheap, I recommend it because it
provides the opportunity to sample a wide
variety of sumptuous, unusual Moroccan
dishes. You dine inside an exotically deco
rated tent, sit on huge pillows at brass ta
bles and cat, in keeping with Moroccan
tradition, with your fingers. The waiters'
turbans and curled slippers further enrich
the atmosphere.
Seafood
For out-of-town visitors, or for a
chance to play tourist in your own town,
Dante's Sea Catch is one of the few
restaurants on her 39 that offer a view of
the Bay without compromising their
menu. Known for its fresh seafood,

seafood pastas and clam chowder (and
also for the cheesy garlic bread that comes
automatically with dinner), Dante's won't
empty your purse if you order with discre
tion. Large windows make this an inviting
summer spot, while cozy couches and
fireplaces upstairs are an attraction on
colder evenings.
Specializing in soups, salads and sand
wiches, the Cliff House at the end of
Geary Boulevard, with its picturesque
oceanside setting is the place for
"seafood, surf and sunsets," as they boast,
and don't forget their omelettes, which
they call "45 of your favorite."
Tex-Mex
For good service and good fun, Bulls,
on the corner of Van Ness and Market, is
a popular place to hang out and meet
people, on weeknights as well as week
ends. lie sure to try the spicy potato chips
at the bar.
At the Corona Bar and Grill, situated
at 88 Cyril Magnin, you can enjoy a relax
ing dinner in a casual yet chic atmo
sphere. Going on a date? Great lighting,
fruity champagne cocktails and a tasty
menu make this the perfect spot. If you're
willing to spring a little cash, you can't go
wrong at this place.
Vegetarian
Vegetarian fare is waiting at The Real
Good Karma Natural Foods Restaurant

on Dolores for anyone who gets a kit k out
of this restaurant's name.
Greens at Fort Mason has found tav< r
among vegetarians and non-vegeta- in
alike. Imaginative salads, homen ide
soups and a view of the Bay are an urn
this restaurant's attractions.
