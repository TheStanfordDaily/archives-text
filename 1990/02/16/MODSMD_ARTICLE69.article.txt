It's hard to go wrong at the shiny silver
Fog City Diner on Battery Street, the at
mosphere is casual, and the menu, con
sisting of hearty appetizers, sandwiches,
salads and unusual entrees, is extensive
and creative. The bread sampler, club
sandwich and teriyaki chicken salad are
great.
On your way to a game at Candlestick
Park? Try stopping in China Basin first for a
juicy hamburger at The Ramp or the Mis
sion Rock Resort (breakfast and lunch
only). Generous servings, great fries, low
prices and blue jeans attract people to
these two hangouts.
You can also find a good burger at The
Balboa Cafe in the Bermuda Triangle.
This usually crowded restaurant is a good
starter to a hopping night on Union Street.
Musical chairs is the name of the game
at Seltzer City, at f>BB Bth Street, where
customers are asked to change seats with
every course. These dinners occur only
monthly, so be sure to make a reservation
if you're interested. Seltzer City's primary
attraction is its seltzer bar, offering 25 to
30 flavors every day. Connoisseurs of the
New York Egg Cream (a drink made with
whole milk, chocolate syrup and seltzer
water) won't find one this good even in
New York. If you're feeling bubbly, check
this place out. Breakfast and luncn only.

The exotic decor and menu of Miss
Pearl's Jam House, at 601 Eddy, are sure
to please. While this colorful restaurant is

popular for its unique dishes, the bar, fea
turing sling chairs, reggae music and fun
drinks, may draw an even larger crowd.
If you prefer a quieter atmosphere,
Cha £ha Cha Cafe at 1805 Haight Street
offers the exciting style of Miss Pearl's,
with less hustle and bustle.
Chinese
If you're in the Union Street area, Tien
Fu on Filmore is a great place to go. The
food is inexpensive, very good and not
greasy.
Yank Sing, at 425 Battery Street, fea
tures award-winning dim sum. The fast
moving trolleys of treats are sometimes
hard to catch, but consider that a blessing
unless you want to burst your belt buckle
at this amazing place.
There are lots of excellent Thai restau
rants in the area of Battery, Broadway and
Columbus Streets. Your best bet is just to
roam until you find a place that suits your
mood.
French
You can dine Trench-style at nearly any
hour at the snazzy, softly-lit L'Entrecote
de Paris, at 2032 Union Street. Artistic
lighting and piano music make this a
restaurant for a special night. It's roman
tic, but far from stuffy. The Entrecote set
menu — a petite salad, thinly sliced steak
and all the shoestring potatoes you can
cat for $16.95 — is optional, but you're
crazy not to order it. The chicken crepes
are delicious too. In case your love affair
with their garlic steak threatens to end
your love affair with you're date, don't de
spair. You can buy a jar of it on your way
out.

Indian
The spicy scent of succulent lamb,
seafood and chicken marinade from its
tandoori ovens fills the air at Caylord's in
Chirardelli Square. Pink linen and soft
music create romantic ambiance, but
Gaylord's is not cheap — expect to pay
around $40 for dinner for two.
Italian
For good calzone, house chianti and
special gourmet pizzas at fairly inexpen
sive prices, Olives on Scott below Lom
bard is a great bet. Roman murals on the
walls add to the charm of this place.
Pizzeria Uno, with locations at Fisher
man's Wharf and on Lombard in the Ma
rina, is a must-do for anyone who hasn't
already been there. Tasty Chicago-style
deep-dish pizza and a casual atmosphere
often make for a wait.
But waiting — on the corner of Grant
and Union outside the North Beach
Pizzeria — is the next best thing to this
restaurant's renowned yet inexpensive
pizza and pasta dishes. Parking in the area
is next to impossible, but the food and fun
you'll find at this bustling pizzeria make it
well worth the walk.
Also in North Beach is what one former
Stanford Italian professor considers the
most authentically Italian restaurant in
San Francisco. I he calzone at Tomasso's
Famous Pizzeria, at 1042 Kearny, come
straight from Italia. Don't be misled by the
"famous" part, however. Tomasso's is the
epitome of a hole in the wall, but all the
more of a find for its cozy, undiscovered
quality.
It you're spending an evening near the
Tmbarcadero, perhaps on your way to the
