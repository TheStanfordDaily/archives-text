Getting to San Francisco from Stanford:
U.S. 101, Bayshore Freeway. Direct but often
agonizingly slow due to heavy traffic.
I-280. The quickest route from Stanford to the
City. Traffic is lighter than on 101, the scenery is
lovely and you avoid the headache of driving
through downtown Palo Alto.
California Highway 1. Slow but breathtaking
oceanside route. Take 280 north, then go west
on 92 to Half Moon Bay and north on 1.
CalTrain. Leaves from University Avenue in
Palo Alto and arrives at Fourth and Townsend
Streets in San Francisco.
