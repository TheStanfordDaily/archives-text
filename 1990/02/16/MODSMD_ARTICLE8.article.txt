Plans for a psychiatric hospital
at the Medical Center came to an
abrupt halt this week as Charter
Medical Corp. called off the $22
million dollar joint venture with
the University.
Charter's executive vice presi
dent, J. Rodney Laughlin, ex
plained in a letter this week to
Medical School Dean David Korn
that his company decided to abort
the venture after "a careful as
sessment of the current economic
circumstances of psychiatric reim
bursement."
At present, escalated cosu of
facilities in northern California
and protracted delays in reim
bursements would have made the
plan unfeasible, he said in a tele
phone interview.
Laughlin said that after he had
raised the concern, both Stanford
and Charter "realized it is a risky

The $22 million, 80-bed psychiatric hospital
was scrapped because of increased construc
tion costs and projected delays in reimburse
ments, Medical Center officials said.

business, which caused [them] to
hold off."
The final legal documents of the
joint venture were to have been
signed as soon as the search for
a new Psychiatry Department
chair was completed. Laughlin
said that because the project was
so complicated, Charter was re
luctant to undertake the plan
before the appointment of a new
department head.
Under the terms of the joint
vtnture, Charter was to have con
structed an 80-bed hospital and
an adjacent academic office and
clinic build'ng on a 6.5-acre site
near the Meoiral Center. Faculty
raised objections early in the plan-

ning because the hospital was to
be an outside money-making ven
ture run in conjunction with the
University.
According to Korn, both Stan
ford and Charter had concluded
earlier that the goal to create a
center with comprehensive, high
quality mental health services and
advanced training programs was
unique and worth pursuing. The
termination of the plan "came as
a surprise" to some people, said
Spyros Andreopoulos, director of
the Medical Center News Bureau.
Malinda Mitchell, associate di
rector of Stanford Hospital, said
Charter reached the decision be
cause construction costs had been

rising during "the length of time
needed to get approval" for the
project.
The Board of Trustees approved
the design of the $22 million psy
chiatry center in March 1988, and
the University has already in
vested funds in developing the
project.
David Mendelow, associate vice
president of the Medical School,
said the school is actively pursuing
a number of alternatives.
Walton Roth, professor in psy
chiatry, said department members
were mainly upset "about the un
certainty and the amount of time
the negotiations have taken."
Roland Ciaranello, also a pro
fessor in psychiatry, said the can
cellation is not going to have an
adverse effect on new training
programs. "It was a hope that the
plan would expand the depart
ment's revenue, but we didn't lose
from the plan being canceled," he
said.
