Ann Simonton, a former
Sports Illustrated swimsuit
model who now proudly calls
herself a radical feminist, said
last night that today's adver
tisers have turned "a real
human being into a con
sumable product."
Simonton spoke to more than
200 students in the Roble Hall
lounge about the images of
women in advertising, the
media and pornography.
Simonton also showed an hour
long slide presentation, which
she takes to presentations all
over the country.
Unfortunately, she said,
women today want to change
themselves, not the beauty
standards created by today's
advertisers.
Simonton preaches civil dis
obedience, self-defense and the
right of a woman to control
her own body and sexuality.
She said she believes that "a

community becomes what it
tolerates.
"We have a responsibility to
speak up, change the reality
and create the type of world
we want to live in," she said.
Simonton is the founder of
Media Watch, a Santa Cruz
non-profit organization that
actively criticizes the
"demeaning" images of women
in advertising and the media.
The organization is anti
censorship and works to bring
nudity and sexuality out in the
open so discussion can take
place. A sign at one of the
group's demonstrations said,
"We do not oppose nudity and
sexuality. We oppose pornogra
phy. There is a difference."
Simonton started modeling
at age 14 and continued until
she was 27. During that time
she entered many beauty
pageants and was on the covers
of several national magazines,
including Glamour, Vogue and
Cosmopolitan.
