We at the Stanford Student
Directory believe that you donl have to be
a graduate to take on the responsibilities of
corporate executives. Every year, we
choose responsible and entrepreneurial
Stanford undergraduates to manage the
Student Directory. And they are respon
sible for all phases of the project and make
all decisions concerning it.
So if you are a responsible Stanford
undergraduate interested in this unique
opportunity, then we want to talk to you.
We are still accepting applications for the
Project Director and the Business Man
ager positions. Complete application ma
tenals are available in the Student Organi
zation Services (SOS) Office located on the
2nd Floor of Tresidder Union. Applica
tions are due on Friday, February 23, at
noon, in the SOS Office.
