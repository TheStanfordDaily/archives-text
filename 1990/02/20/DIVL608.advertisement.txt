OTAL PAID
Until last year, Webb Ranch workers received these pay sheets
every month with each paycheck. The sheets show unemployment
tax deductions, which are supposed to be paid by the employer.
Further deductions are made for rent and utilities, which cannot
legally be taken out without written authorization from the employee.
(Although rent is normally 75 cents per hour, this pay sheet deducts
50 cents per hour.) This pay sheet, which lacks a social security
number, also has a deduction of $10 for gasoline used on the job
when operating Webb Ranch equipment.
