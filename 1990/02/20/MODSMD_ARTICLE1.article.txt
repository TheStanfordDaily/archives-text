# Parking spot shortage may hurt students
## 
### Ari Richter Staff writer 
Students who have long enjoyed priority parking
on campus could be the first victims in the Uni
versity's attempts to curb its high costs of providing
parking.
Facing an anticipated need for hundreds of ad
ditional parking spaces, the Committee on Trans
portation and Parking, charged with the responsi
bility of redefining the University's parking policies,
may recommend that students bear the brunt of
the parking spot shortfall.
At its most recent meeting, the committee mem
bers came to what chair Peter Sidebottom called
''a decision."
"No longer is convenience going to be the guiding
principle" for University parking policy, Sidebottom
said. Until now, the policy has been to provide a
parking supply that unconditionally met the needs
of the Stanford community.
It has also been University policy to provide stu
dent residents with the cheapest and most convenient
parking spaces.
With the University strapped for cash, adding
multimillion dollar parking structures appears to
be one of the last things the committee will rec
ommend.
According to Sidebottom, the top priority will
become "conservation of resources, both financial
and natural."
Committee staff have been given the next two
weeks to formulate a four-year plan for managing
the limited parking supply, according to Julia
Fremori, managing director of University Transpor
tation Programs.
Such a plan will include suggestions for reducing
the negative impact of the narrowed parking options.
These measures would include shuttle buses, car
pools, and even taxi service. Other measures would
encourage bicycle use and ensure the safety of com
munity members forced to park outside the central
campus, Fremon said.
Resident student parking spaces, numbering 4,671
in all, represent more than a quarter of all central
campus parking.
According to Tom Auer, a member of the com
mittee staff, recent committee sessions have involved
consideration of questions such as: "What if we
took away all the [residential student] parking in
the campus drive loop. How much money would
that save?
" The result would be a decline in resident student
life at Stanford," Auer said. "But it would save a
lot of money."
Until two weeks ago, there had only been one
student member on the committee. The ASSU, how
ever, filled the two other available spots two weeks
ago.
Newly appointed committee member Kevin Lewis,
a freshman, said he intends to watch out for the
interests of students. "I would strongly object to
any changes that could jeopardize student safety
and convenience," Lewis said.
To avoid an anticipated parking shortfall, the
University has considered building parking garages,
which cost about $12,000 per parking space. Uni
versity officials say parking lots require too much
space to be feasible alternatives for central-campus
parking.
