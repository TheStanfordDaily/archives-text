### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
Science fiction author Ray
Bradbury and the sporting goods
company Nike have something in
common. Both have adopted the
same motto: "Just do it."
Bradbury, who has written 23
books, spoke last night to a packed
house of more than 500 people at
Kresge Auditorium. He told stu
dents, "In the instant of getting
an idea, do it. Don't talk to anyone
about it, 'cause they'll kill it."
"Never listen to your crazy
friends making fun of you. You
gotta have friends who believe in
you," he said.
Bradbury described how he and
a high-school friend ' ho liked to
build model dinosaurs dreamed
that one day Bradbury would
write a script and his friend would
build dinosaurs for the film.
In 1952, Bradbury fulfilled his
dream and wrote a short story
about dinosaurs that was turned
into a movie. "That's the way all

things begin — in the garage with !
nuts," Bradbury said.
"Do everything at the top of;
your lungs with an immense pas- •
sion, 'cause even then they might <
not hear you, and everyone out!
there is against you" because they !
aren't receptive to new ideas, |
Bradbury said.
Bradbury described science fic- i
tion as the predecessor to "science ■
fact." Science fiction goes back to !
the beginning of civilization, he !
said.
At one time, people thought
building and sustaining a fire was
science fiction, and people drew
pictures on cave walls to convey
their ideas. "I'm writing what has
always been written — fiction be
coming fact," Bradbury said.
Recently, Bradbury has
"become dissatisfied with Ameri
can cities," so he has written
many articles about how they can
be made "more humane again."
He has also been involved in sug
gesting designs for new shopping
malls, he said.
