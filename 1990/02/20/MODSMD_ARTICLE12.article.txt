# Secretary Cheney shunned by Aquino

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — De
fense Secretary Dick Cheney, shunned
by Philippine President Corazon
Aquino, told Filipino officials yester
day that the United States will aban
don its bases here if it finds that
keeping them is too expensive or that
Americans are unwelcome.
As violence was reported in several
clashes between leftist protesters and
police near U.S. installations, Cheney
met for nearly three hours with De
fense Minister Fidel Ramos in discus
sions that were described as "very cor
dial, very forthright."
Meeting reporters afterward with
Ramos, Cheney said the United States
"will stay only as long as the Philippine
people wish it to stay — and only if
the terms negotiated are acceptable to
both parties."
At issue in yesterday's discussions
was a $96 million cut Congress made
in the Bush administration's request
for $360 million to compensate the
Philippines for the six bases, which
include two of the United States' lar
gest overseas installations, Clark Air
Base and Subic Bay Naval Base.
"We recognize there is a shortfall of
$96 million over what we had antici
pated," Cheney said. "I also pointed
out that in East Asia, in this part of
the world, the United States provided
a little over $600 million, and about
$500 million of that comes specifically
to the Philippines."
Cheney has said his discussions with
Filipino officials did not amount to
the beginning of negotiations to extend
the base agreement, which expires next
year.
An influential Filipino minority is
pressuring Mrs. Aquino not to renew
the agreement. In addition, leading
Filipino congressmen have urged her
to postpone those discussions until this

year's cuts are restored.
There are some 18,000 U.S. military
personnel in the Philippines, plus
20,000 dependents.
For his part, Ramos acknowledged
that the Bush administration needs
congressional approval for aid commit
ments but said he had told Cheney
that "time is of the essence" in meeting
current U.S. obligations. The secretary
said Ramos had been "very direct and
very forthright" in presenting his gov

ernment's position.
Mrs. Aquino was so upset over the
congressional cut that she announced
before Cheney began his two-week
tour of Asian nations hosting U.S.
bases that she would not see him,
leaving that task to her defense min
ister.
The secretary pledged his "best ef
forts" to restoring the $96 million cut,
but U.S. diplomats have said that an
austerity-minded Congress is unlikely

to change its mind.
Despite the current differences,
Cheney said that ties between the two
nations are strong.
"I think that is a misreading of
events to suggest that somehow the
United States is trying to send signals
other than the one I have already given
publicly, which is our very strong com
mitment to our alliance with the
Philippines," the secretary said.
