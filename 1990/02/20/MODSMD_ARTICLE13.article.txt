TOKYO (AP) — Prime Minister Tos
hiki Kaifu said yesterday the voters
gave his party a vote of confidence in
its time of greatest crisis by keeping
the Liberal Democrats in control of
Parliament.
Some Japanese who voted Sunday
said they were angry with the Liberal
Democrats because of political scandal
and an unixjjjular sales tax but still

Business leaders called the result a
vote for the economic policies that
have brought unprecedented prosper

ity to Japan.
Liberal Democrats implicated in the
Recruit influence-buying scandal were
re-elected, including former prime
ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone, 72, and
Noboru Takeshita, 65. Nakasone ran
as an independent.
Kaifu said they were "absolved" by
the voters but added, "We must
proceed with political in the
party that has governed Jaf>an since
its founding in 1955. * ... J*
"We started when the party was said
to be in the greatest crisis since it was
formed," he told reporters. "The result

of the election is a vote of confidence
of the people under the constitution,
and our government has passed it."
Socialist Party leader Takako Doi
also claimed a victory on grounds that
"our purpose was to reduce the Liberal
Democrats' strength as much as pos
sible."
Her party campaigned on opposition
to the 3 percent sales tax introduced
last year and reminded voters of the
scandal, in which the Recruit Co. in
formation and publishing conglomer
ate made large contributions to poli
ticians and sold them stock at insider

prices.
The Liberal Democrats got 275 seats
in Parliament's powerful lower house,
a 512-seat body that chooses the prime
minister and sets the budget. Fourteen
more candidates who ran as indepen
dents are expected to join them. Before
the election, the party had 295 seats.
Liberal Democrats won 30.3 million
votes, or 46.1 percent of the total,
down from 49.4 percent in the last
lower house election in 1986. Socialists
took 16 million votes, or 24.4 percent,
a sharp increase from 17.2 percent in
1986.
