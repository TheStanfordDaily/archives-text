Shuttle countdown
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -
A clandestine countdown advanced
smoothly yesterday toward a fiery
pre-dawn liftoff Thursday of space
shuttle Atlantis with five military
astronauts and a spy satellite.
"You wouldn't believe how smooth
it is," said NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone. "The count picked up right
on time without a hitch Sunday
night, and we've had no problems."
Shuttle forecasters said the
weather outlook was 60 percent fa
vorable for a launch Thursday. They

said the main concern was an ad
vancing cold front that could bring
low clouds and rain into the area.
Malone could not reveal the exact
status of the countdown because of
the classified nature of the mission,
the sixth dedicated to the Defense
Department in 34 shuttle flights.
