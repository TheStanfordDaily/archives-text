## Individual strength 
### 
A LIVING PART of history
came to Stanford yesterday.
Rosa Parks, mother of the
civil rights movement, participated
in a program that recalled the
power of that movement.
Parks, the focus of the admira
tion of nearly 2,000 people who
filled Memorial Auditorium,
earned her place in history with a
quiet act of courage on a Mont
gomery, Ala., bus in 1955. By act
ing on her convictions, she
catalyzed a movement.
As History Prof. Kennell Jack
son said, Parks demonstrated that
"the little people of the world make
history." In an age of cynicism and
skepticism about the impact of one
individual, Parks' example
reminds us that great movements
do start with individual actions.
The power of the civil rights
movement is that it transcended
racial and class divisions and
united people from all backgrounds
in a common cause. Yesterday, a
similar phenomenon occurred in

Memorial Auditorium as people
from Palo Alto, East Palo Alto,
and Stanford stood in unison.
Perhaps the greatest testament
to the enduring power of the move
ment came when the Dyper Posse,
a group of child rap artists from
East Palo Alto, performed songs
with an anti-drug message and
lyrics such as, "We're gonna go to
college/rule the world."
Those youth, born nearly 30
years after the bus boycott, dedi
cated their songs to Parks and told
her that her "struggle was not in
vain." The ultimate message of the
day was that the children are the
future, and we must study history
in order to carry on the struggle.
As Parks said, "Never stop study
ing and learning what it means to
have our dignity."
Rosa Parks acted to attain her
dignity in 1955. Today, we must
act to both ensure that our cur
riculum preserves this important
historical record and to educate
ourselves about this important pe
riod in history.
