# Who's responsible?

SEE NO EVIL, hear no evil,
speak no evil.
The Stanford Golf Course's
Clubhouse Restaurant was raided
last week for selling alcohol with
out a license. After the investiga
tion, a University official admitted
that he had known about the illegal
activity as early as last spring.
Although the restaurant is not
owned by the University, it is lo
cated on land owned by Stanford,
a relationship similar to that be
tween the University and the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
Legal responsibility aside, Stan
ford has an obligation to students,
faculty and staff to maintain a good
reputation. That the University
knew of the illegal activities at the

Golf Course — which bears its
name — and did nothing to correct
them can only send negative sig
nals to the community.
The University should also take
responsibility for the safety of its
holdings, whether or not actual
buildings are owned by outside
sources. The Clubhouse Restau
rant is patronized by members of
the Stanford community, and an
illegal activity involving alcohol has
the potential for serious damage.
Putting these events into a his
torical perspective, which includes
allegations of wrongdoing at Webb
Ranch, one can only wonder if the
University is making a policy of
turning a blind eye and a deaf ear
to illegal activity.
