## Labels don't say enough 
### 
SOMETHING THERE is that
doesn't love a label.
And yet, we revel in them when
we see fit to talk politics. "Liberal" and
"conservative" seem to be the only terms
in which we are willing to think about
social, economic or political issues.
Although liberal/conservative labeling
is popular with most politically conscious
people, this rigid, two-sided way of think
ing is not particularly useful or sophis
ticated. It is as if we are choosing up
sides for a schoolyard game. The main
problem is that it is extremely difficult
to ascertain what these labels mean.
This split can be thought of in terms
of a liberal vs. conservative lifestyle.
Woodstock is the former, and Orange
County is the latter.
It can be thought of as support for, or
opposition to, change. Liberals are pro
gressive, that is, they want to makexon
stant, positive improvements to govern
ment and society. Conservatives are gofer
erally satisfied with how things are now.
They think it is better to stick with tra
dition.
The labels can also mean the recep
tiveness to new or differing ideas.
Liberals are open-minded, and conserva
tives are narrow-minded. Liberals are
willing to listen to somebody else's opin
ion. Conservatives are not. Their minds
are already made up.
This division can also be thought to
reflect the positions that people take on
the whole gamut of important contem
porary issues. In general if you find your
self agreeing with Sen. Ted Kennedy, you
are a liberal. If you agree with Sen. Jesse

Helms, you are a conservative.
I have not evaluated whether these
paradigms are accurate or not. For ex
ample, the very definition of modern con
servatism, Ronald Reagan, was interested
in profoundly transforming government
and society, and "liberals" opposed these
changes. The real conflict is actually the
perceived merit of the changes that are
proposed.
In addition, "liberals" can be very sure
of the correctness of their opinions and
may not be all that willing to seriously
consider other perspectives.
Finally, virtually everyone's beliefs in
clude a mix of so-called "liberal" and
"conservative" positions.
Whether you accept one set of criteria
or another is not important. The essential
problem is that the labels mean different
things to different people because they
use dissimilar witerter —*
These -of -their varying
usages, are too imprecise and therefore
are poor analytical tools. And yet, this
liberal/conservative labeling system is the
primary medium of debate at Stanford
and across the country.
Thinking of societal issues on these
terms is inimical to learning and under
standing. This framework degrades the
complexity of people's ideas by reducing
them to simple stereotypes.
To label is to make a prejudgment on
that person's whole range of values and
ideas. It is to make conclusions about
the person's whole world view.
The liberal/conservative mode of anal
ysis is also divisive. The act of labeling
is to create a sense of "us" and "them."

To label is to make
conclusions about a
person s whole world view

There is an inclusive and exclusive sidi
to it.
Many of those who accept and apph
labels claim all that is good and moral
to be their domain and find that every
thing which is wrong-headed and im
moral to be the property of the other
camp. The words "liberal" and "conserva
tive" take on positive or negative conno
tations depending upon who says them.
Childish name-calling is a frequent
result of these misguided notions.. One
esteemed opinion writer uses the term
"looney left" to describe his ideological
enemies.
Very little productive discussion can
result so long as we insist upon using
the L-word and the C-word. So long as
people with differing views attach labels
to their perceived opponents, there can
be no productive change of ideas, only
the mutual discharge of dogma.
I realize that it is inevitable to use
labels, but I just wish they weren't used
as substitutes for analytic thought.

person s whole world view

There is an inclusive and exclusive sidi
to it.
Many of those who accept and apph
labels claim all that is good and moral
to be their domain and find that every
thing which is wrong-headed and im
moral to be the property of the other
camp. The words "liberal" and "conserva
tive" take on positive or negative conno
tations depending upon who says them.
Childish name-calling is a frequent
result of these misguided notions.. One
esteemed opinion writer uses the term
"looney left" to describe his ideological
enemies.
Very little productive discussion can
result so long as we insist upon using
the L-word and the C-word. So long as
people with differing views attach labels
to their perceived opponents, there can
be no productive change of ideas, only
the mutual discharge of dogma.
I realize that it is inevitable to use
labels, but I just wish they weren't used
as substitutes for analytic thought.
