Wet and windy
A tree near Meyer Library falls victim to stormy weather Friday
morning. The storm will cost the University $30,000 to $40,000,
mostly to repair water damage to campus buildings and to
clean up debris and fallen trees. Eight broken windows, roof
leaks, drainage problems and fallen trees near Meyer, Green
Library and Encina Hall were reported as a result of the storm.
