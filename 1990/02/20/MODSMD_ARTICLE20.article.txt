## Phi Delt fraternity doesn't deserve campus housing 
### 
SOME DAYS the sheer spineless
ness of the University amazes
me. Once again the "powers that
be" have proven themselves impotent
in the face of a destructive and incor
rigible campus group. If you haven't
guessed already, I am of course speak
ing of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
I am not one to advocate reckless
disregard for fair play. Do I think that
the Phi Delts deserve a second chance?
Absolutely! They got a second chance
in 1986 after having been put on

probation for blatant alcohol abuse at
their infamous Kamikaze Party.
Do I think the Phi Delts deserve a
third chance? Sure, I'm a reasonable
guy. They got a third chance in 1988
after being put on probation for the
exact same offense â€” Kamikaze II:
The Phi Delts' Revenge.
Well, it is now 1990, and I am ask
ing myself the question, "Do I think
that the Phi Delts deserve a fourth
chance in four years?" This is the
question the University officials in

charge of the Phi Delts' latest proba
tion should be asking themselves.
Well, do they deserve a fourth
chance? Should the Phi Delts be let
loose on the campus again to perform
some other disgustingly irresponsible
act? Should the Phi Delts be allowed
to further poison this campus, both
chemically and socially?
Should the Phi Delts still exist on
this campus?
The answer is clearly NO! The Phi
Delts have proven themselves a disrup-

tive and negative force on Stanford's
campus for too many years. If this
University is indeed committed to
combating such things as sexism,
alcohol abuse and the like, the very
existence of Phi Delta Theta as a
Stanford residence is paradoxical.
The sooner the Phi Delt house be
comes "680 Lomita," the better off
this campus will be.
