# Columnists should write on other than their own pet causes
## 
### 
I am the author of the article in The
Stanford Review — which Carrie
Chang referred to in her Feb. 15
column — who erroneously called the
Asian-American theme house "Orien
tal." In addition, I mistakenly called
the Chicano and Mexican-American
theme house "Hispanic."
For these two errors I would like to
apologize; it was not my intent to of
fend anyone over the names of these
two dormitories. I have no excuse for
the errors.
However, because Chang has shared
with me what she was offended by in
my article, I would like to return this
favor by sharing what I am offended
by in her columns. First of all, I think
it would be "nifty" if she would talk
about something besides Asian-
American issues. I understand that
there actually are a few issues that
affect all students, not just Asian-
American ones.
Furthermore, in addressing all of the
columnists, I think that it would be a
good idea if you tackled issues that

were a tad less black and white than
drug abuse and nomenclature.
Why doesn't anyone talk about God
or a Supreme Being or even Truth?
What about the suicide or abortion
that affects even our idyllic campus?
It just seems to me that our colum
nists are being either innocuous or
they just push their own pet causes. In
this I do not apologize that I probed a
subject that affects all of us as stu
dents, that subject being the political
aspect of Residental Education.
However, I was asinine in not check
ing my information. Again, I am very
sorry.
