# Stanford students need to keep up on Edelman's cause
## 
### 
What? Stanford students no longer
watch the flagship of Sunday night
television? James Turo and Ziad Sarkis
must have missed the recent edition of
"Sixty Minutes" that featured Marian

Wright Edelman, president of the
Children's Defense Fund.
I was delighted to read that Stanford
had captured Edelman as a Commence
ment speaker. She is somebody I
greatly admire — she has been a com
mitted and inspiring advocate for
children (a truly disenfranchised group)
for many years.
So I was disappointed — but I sup
pose I should not have been surprised
— that the two seniors did not per
ceive her as worthy of being a Com
mencement speaker.
I believe that the message Ms. Edel
man conveys is critical at a time when
the United States is losing its interna
tional competitiveness. Our private
sector, as well as our public sector, is
becoming increasingly aware that "all"
citizens need to be productive if we are
going to reverse a persistent trade im
balance and federal deficit.
It follows that we need a mentally
and physically healthy and educated
workforce. It is important that Ameri
cans appreciate that one out of four
children live in poverty now and that
we must address this national problem.
