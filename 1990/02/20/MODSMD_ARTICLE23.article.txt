# Use of 'Oriental' not derogatory to Chinese-American
## 
### 
Pieces by Daily columnists over the
last year have dealt, ad nauseam, with
issues of racism. But Carrie Chang's
column on Feb. 15 has finally inspired
me to write.
Simply put, as a second-generation
Chinese-American born here and as a
two-time visitor to China, it is news to
me that the word "Oriental" has be
come derogatory.
Or perhaps your column was in
tended to be a ludicrous parody of
certain other "minority" contributors,
in which case I'm overreacting.
In other news, I applaud the actions
and ideas of former Asian-American
scholar candidate Victor Nee, whose
attitude is in line with the Asian-
Americans I have spoken to. He is not
alone in believing that Asian-American
studies belongs in the Sociology De
partment, and it was quite entertaining
to read the pathetic whining from stu
dents who were surprised by his posi
tion.
