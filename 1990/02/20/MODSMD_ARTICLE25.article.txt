## Henry Organ Support Jesse Jackson on District of Columbia statehood 
### 
STATEHOOD FOR the District of
Columbia can and should become
a decisive factor in future political
campaigns and platforms throughout
the country. Statehood for the district
is not a new issue. As a matter of fact,
it was adopted by th*i Democratic
National Committee at its last conven
tion, and its hope is being kept alive
by the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
It is important to know what
provoked Jackson to keep it alive.
Many so-called political pundits like
George Will and James Kilpatrick —
seeking any excuse to oppose Jackson's
bid for the presidency — have said
Jackson needed political experience
before seeking such an office. They
then suggested that the mayoral office
of the district would be an ideal place,
in their opinion, to begin.
What is troublesome to many critics
of Jackson is that he can evoke the
flimsiest of reasons for opposing his
positions or actions.
First, political experience is not a
constitutional requirement to run for

the presidency. Second, Jackson is free
to seek any office he wishes as long as
he satisfies the legal requirements.
Third, neither Will nor Kirkpatrick
sought to list the large number of
individuals who have acquired high
political office without prior elective
experience, among them Dwight Eisen
hower at the presidential level and
Ronald Reagan at the gubernatorial,
level.
Moreover, there are ample numbers
of individuals who obtained and con
tinue in public office as experienced —
and incompetent — incumbents. Count
George Bush and Dan Quayle among
them.
Jackson is very perceptive and not
one to avoid a challenge, particularly if
it can be leveraged to an advantage for
the people. It is very clear why these
pundits wanted Jackson to run for
mayor of the district; after all, they
did not suggest he acquire political
experience as mayor of Yonkers,
Beverly Hills, Des Moines or other safe
havens.

They wanted him to acquire an
office that is going to be at the mercy
of simple and militia-minded William
Ben net.
The Reverend Jackson took the
stakes to a higher plane by invoking
the issue of statehood. In responding
to the sycophants, Jackson offered a
bit of Biblical history. He stated, as I
recall, "Moses delivered the people to
the 'promised' land, not to an 'oc
cupied' land." Indeed, the district is an
occupied land, and the intensity of that
occupation is likely to increase.
Why statehood? Racists should try
for a moment (if they can) to disregard
the racial composition of that area and
consider some factual, political and
constitutional issues involved. Among
them are the following:
• The district's elected representative
to Congress is a non-voting member.
• Elected representatives of residents
in the 50 state capita! cities are not
prohibited from voting on matters
before their respective state legisla
tures.

• Few, if any capital cities through
out the world are so disenfranchised.
• The district has more citizens, and
pays more federal taxes, than several
states in the Union.
But to raise the subject of statehood
for the district (which is predominantly
African-American and Democratic) is to
call forth the reflective wrath of
racists.
To ask what the response would be
if the racial and political composition
were different would be quite predict
able: "Great!" Keep in mind that
Puerto Rico, largely Republican in
registration, is seeking statehood.
Jackson's position: Why not admit
both?
An article in the Jan. 16 issue of
The New York Times reported some
congressional legislators as having said
the district "should not be free to
govern itself totally, given its serious
drug, crime, housing, health and
money problems."
Constitutional rights should not be
given or denied on the basis of these

criteria, or where one resides in the
country. Given these criteria, if applied,
severed cities and states would be in
jeopardy.
When Jackson announced the pro
gram on statehood for the district last
November, he gave a litany of what it
would mean to its residents.
Jackson stated that two senators
from the district would play an impor
tant role in crucial agenda items.
Among them he listed the right to
abortion, confirmation of federal
judges, the environment and toxic
wastes, sane defense spending, educa
tion, human and civil rights.
If one supports any of the above
measures, then one should support
statehood for the district. The issue
should be put to every seeker of politi
cal office, at the state and federal
level, until it is achieved.
Pro-voice AND pro-choice, as a joint
political opinion, has a good ring to it.
