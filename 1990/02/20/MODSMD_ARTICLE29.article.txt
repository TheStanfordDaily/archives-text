Migrant Souls

Islas' second novel, "Migrant
Souls," is extremely rich.
From the first page, Islas draws
the reader into the lives of mem
bers of the Angel family. Most of
the scenes in the novel take place
in and around the fictional border
town, Del Sapo, modeled after El
Paso where Islas grew up.
Islas' third person narrative
brings up questions of class and
race. A central theme beneath the
surface in "Migrant Souls" is that
Mexican-Americans are not immi
grants and not aliens. Much of
the southwest United States used
to belong to them. Mexican-
Americans are migrant souls.
The novel is divided into two
books and the first book revolves
around the strong-willed
daughter of mixed parents, Josie.

Her mother's family traces its
origin back to the Spanish, and
therefore feels superior, while her
father is Indian.
Josie is a strong-willed, preco
cious child. She questions the im
portance of religion and the
sanctity of Catholicism. She
refuses to accept the gender roles
that were accepted by generations
of women in her family. She has
an affinity for her Indian father,
even though most other members
of the Angel family turn their
noses up at him.
Josie marries an American, or
"Anglo." They move away to Cal
ifornia and eventually get a
divorce. Islas is not afraid to relate
the complex circumstances that
face many people today. He
describes Josie's affair with one
of her husband's friends and
Josie's feelings after her husband
leaves her with two daughters,
but he does not pass judgment on
either character. The reader gains
an understanding and apprecia

tion of each character.
Josie and her cousin, Miguel
Chico, are very close. They stand
on the fringes of the family and
view its tradition with skepticism.
Miguel Chico is a young, homo
sexual fiction writer who has suf
fered many hardships in life.
Though Islas says that he is not
Miguel Chico, there are several
parallels between the life of the
author and the character.
A large section of the second
book of the novel lets the reader
into Miguel Chico's mind as he
wanders around
Though the novel abruptly
shifts back and forth in time at
points, there are gems of insight
literally on every other page.
The inside jacket of the book
cover depicts the Angel family
tree, and it is helpful because the
novel skips from character to
character quickly at times. But it
is well-written and engaging.
And, in the end, it is nothing
short of uplifting.
