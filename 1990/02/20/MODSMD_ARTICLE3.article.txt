# Webb violated income tax laws, records show
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
Webb Ranch appears to have violated
federal and state income tax laws by im
properly deducting taxes from workers' pay
sheets and failing to deduct other required
taxes, The Daily has found.
Worker pay sheets from 1983 to 1989
obtained by The Daily show a number of
irregularities. For example, more than 1
cent per dollar was regularly deducted for
unemployment tax, but law mandates that
state and federal unemployment taxes be
paid quarterly by the employer, not
workers.
In addition, Webb Ranch did not deduct
state disability insurance from any worker
pay sheets before April 1989, when ranch
workers voted to join the United Stanford
Workers. Disability insurance deductions
are required by state law.
Webb family attorney Terrence
O'Connor, who also works with the Western
Growers Association, said he was not aware
of any failures by the ranch to deduct these
taxes from worker pay sheets.
Handwritten worker pay sheets from
before 1983 have unspecified deductions
taken from them which were comparable
to the deductions made in later pay sheets
for social security and unemployment taxes.
Workers were undocumented
The apparent violations occurred at a
time when most of the Webb Ranch laborers
were illegally working in the United States.
About 90 percent of the workers were illegal
until the 1986 Immigration Reform and
Control Act granted amnesty to millions
of undocumented aliens in the United
States, according to former ranch worker
Manuel Chavez.

Although an Internal Revenue Service
spokesperson could not confirm because of
privacy regulations that an IRS investiga
tion of Webb Ranch is underway, she did
say it would be standard under such cir
cumstances to look into possible revenue
illegalities.
"In normal circumstances, when there
are large amounts of money involved, it
would be in the IRS' best interest to look
into the charges," said IRS spokesperson
Maria Inchauspe.
An IRS investigation could result in a
lien on Webb Ranch if the ranch owed a
sufficiently large amount of money to the
federal government. A lien would entitle
the IRS to auction Webb Ranch property
and other personal holdings of the Webb
family in order to reclaim missing revenues.
There is not currently a lien on any Webb
property by the IRS, indicating that the
IRS has not completed an investigation,
Inchauspe said.
But paycheck stubs show that Webb
Ranch deducted social security and unem
ployment taxes from worker paychecks even
though the workers were illegal.
Since most of the workers did not have
social security numbers, they would have
been ineligible after retirement to receive
the money withheld from their paychecks
by Webb Ranch for social security.
Debated deductions
Employers are required to deduct both
social security and state disability insur
ance taxes from workers' wages even if the
workers are illegal, according to Inchauspe.
Even so, the USW has alleged that the
social security deductions taken from ranch
workers were not given to the federal gov-
