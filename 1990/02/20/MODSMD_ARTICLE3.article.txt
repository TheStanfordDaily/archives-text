# Webb violated income tax laws, records show
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
Webb Ranch appears to have violated
federal and state income tax laws by im
properly deducting taxes from workers' pay
sheets and failing to deduct other required
taxes, The Daily has found.
Worker pay sheets from 1983 to 1989
obtained by The Daily show a number of
irregularities. For example, more than 1
cent per dollar was regularly deducted for
unemployment tax, but law mandates that
state and federal unemployment taxes be
paid quarterly by the employer, not
workers.
In addition, Webb Ranch did not deduct
state disability insurance from any worker
pay sheets before April 1989, when ranch
workers voted to join the United Stanford
Workers. Disability insurance deductions
are required by state law.
Webb family attorney Terrence
O'Connor, who also works with the Western
Growers Association, said he was not aware
of any failures by the ranch to deduct these
taxes from worker pay sheets.
Handwritten worker pay sheets from
before 1983 have unspecified deductions
taken from them which were comparable
to the deductions made in later pay sheets
for social security and unemployment taxes.
Workers were undocumented
The apparent violations occurred at a
time when most of the Webb Ranch laborers
were illegally working in the United States.
About 90 percent of the workers were illegal
until the 1986 Immigration Reform and
Control Act granted amnesty to millions
of undocumented aliens in the United
States, according to former ranch worker
Manuel Chavez.

Although an Internal Revenue Service
spokesperson could not confirm because of
privacy regulations that an IRS investiga
tion of Webb Ranch is underway, she did
say it would be standard under such cir
cumstances to look into possible revenue
illegalities.
"In normal circumstances, when there
are large amounts of money involved, it
would be in the IRS' best interest to look
into the charges," said IRS spokesperson
Maria Inchauspe.
An IRS investigation could result in a
lien on Webb Ranch if the ranch owed a
sufficiently large amount of money to the
federal government. A lien would entitle
the IRS to auction Webb Ranch property
and other personal holdings of the Webb
family in order to reclaim missing revenues.
There is not currently a lien on any Webb
property by the IRS, indicating that the
IRS has not completed an investigation,
Inchauspe said.
But paycheck stubs show that Webb
Ranch deducted social security and unem
ployment taxes from worker paychecks even
though the workers were illegal.
Since most of the workers did not have
social security numbers, they would have
been ineligible after retirement to receive
the money withheld from their paychecks
by Webb Ranch for social security.
Debated deductions
Employers are required to deduct both
social security and state disability insur
ance taxes from workers' wages even if the
workers are illegal, according to Inchauspe.
Even so, the USW has alleged that the
social security deductions taken from ranch
workers were not given to the federal gov-
ernment.
Webb Ranch workers "are being
cheated out of their wages,"
charged USW field representative
Mike Tatham last week.
O'Connor called these allega
tions a "bald-faced lie."
"I guarantee you that if there
were any hint of [withholding rev
enues], the government would
come right down on Webb Ranch,"
he said.
Before joining the USW last
April, the ranch workers received
handwritten pay sheets specifying
deductions for social security and
unemployment taxes. Further
deductions are taken from worker
paychecks for rent and utilities
charges.
Since joining the union,
workers have received computer
printed pay stubs with social se
curity and state disability
insurance deductions, in accord
ance with state and federal laws.
Most ranch workers are paid a
base salary of $4.25 per hour,
which is California's minimum
wage requirement. Webb Ranch
takes deductions of 75 cents per
hour for rent, so that the more
hours workers work, the more
they are charged for rent. Utilities
are charged on a per-person basis,
meaning that a worker with a
large family pays more than one
with no family.
But voluntary deductions for
rent and utilities can only be
charged with the written author
ization from the workers, accord
ing to Section 224 of the
California Labor Code.
The USW says Webb Ranch has
no such written authorization
from any workers, and the union
has asked the state labor commis
sioner to investigate the rent and
utility deductions.
Many agencies involved
Other government agencies
have also been investigating living
and working conditions at Webb
Ranch. Last August, the U.S. De
partment of Labor investigated
minimum wage violations and

Webb Ranch
workers 'are being
cheated out of
their wages.'
â€” Mike Tatham

ordered Webb Ranch to pay
$6,690 in back wages to nine
workers, according to a Labor De
partment order obtained by The
Daily.
"Without admitting guilt, we
settled those violations,"
O'Connor said.
The Labor Department has
denied a written Freedom of In
formation Act request filed by
The Daily for more information
about Webb Ranch investigations
because it would interfere with
"law enforcement purposes," ac
cording to Herbert Goldstein, a
Labor Department spokesperson.
The Daily is filing an appeal to
the denial.
The Labor Department also in
vestigated charges of housing vi
olations under the Migrant
Seasonal Protection Act,
O'Connor said.
In addition, the federal Occupa
tional Safety and Health Admin
istration investigated worker
living conditions last February
and cited Webb Ranch for 14 vi
olations of safety regulations.
Overcrowding, inadequate
heating and insufficient bathroom
facilities were among the viola
tions.
The San Mateo County Envi
ronmental Health Department
last spring found 75 violations of
regulations, including overcrowd
ing. Webb Ranch has since fixed
most of the violations.
O'Connor blamed media atten
tion last spring for the number
of government agencies that are
investigating the ranch. He said,
however, that most of the viola
tions were cited by more than one
agency, so that fixing a single
violation would bring the ranch
into compliance with several agen
cies.
