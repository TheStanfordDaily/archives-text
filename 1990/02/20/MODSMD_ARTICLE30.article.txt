# Second novel helps establish Stanford author in spite of the odds

"My birthday is the same as Bob
Dylan's and Queen Victoria's, and I've
always thought that they represented the
two sides of my personality," English
Prof. Arturo Islas joked.
Islas has been fighting an uphill battle
all his life. But with the recent release
of his second novel, "Migrant Souls," by
a major New York publisher, the progress
he has made is evident.
Islas, a second-generation Mexican-
American, was born in El Paso, Texas,
where he grew up and eventually won a
scholarship to Stanford.
After earning a bachelor's and a
master's here, he did the coursework for
his doctorate but decided to take some
time off from school before working on
his dissertation.
During this time, Islas decided to write
his dissertation on a Jewish New York
novelist named Hortense Calisher, who
was at Stanford when Islas was a student.
"Back then, you were only supposed
to do dissertations on people who had
been dead for a long time," Islas ex
plained. "But I didn't want to do that."
With Wallace Stegner as his director,
Islas finished his dissertation and, in
1969, accepted a full-time teaching posi
tion at San Jose State University.
But then, as he stated matter-of-factly,
"in the summer of 1969, I almost died."
Islas was struck down by intestinal
cancer and had to give up his full-time
job at San Jose State. He was offered a
part-time teaching position at Stanford
that fall and, in his weakened condition,
it was all he could handle.
But that part-time position was revolu
tionary. At the beginning of fall quarter
1969, Islas welcomed the first 24 Chicano
students to attend Stanford into his
Freshman English class.

"l still keep in touch with many of
those pioneering students," Islas said.
After more medical treatment, Islas
was offered a full-time teaching position
at Stanford in 1970. In 1976 he received
the Dinkelspiel Award, given to instruc
tors in honor of excellence in undergrad
uate teaching, and became the first
tenured Chicano professor at Stanford.
"Those first years, from 1970 to 1976,
were very happy years," Islas recalled.
Though it was unpublished, Islas' first
novel, "The Rain God," was complete in
1976. Faculty members used the un
published manuscript and several articles
Islas had written on Chicano literature
as the basis for their decision to offer
him tenure.
"Back in those days, even more so than
today, there was very little being pub
lished by Chicano authors," Islas said.
"Only one small press in Berkeley was
publishing Chicano literature."
It was at this point in his life that
Islas decided to become a writer.
"Instead of writing about the little Chi
cano literature that was available, I
decided to create the literature myself,"
Islas said. But he could not possibly have
foreseen the obstacles that lay before him.
"I tried to get 'The Rain God' published
32 times," Islas said. "Then I finally put
it away."
Islas had shelved "The Rain God" and
given up hope until, in 1983, English
Prof. Albert Girard asked to see the man
uscript again. Girard was then working
as the literary editor for the Alexandrian
Press in Palo Alto, which was started by
Philosophy Prof. Pat Suppes and his wife
Christine, an aspiring novelist.
Finally, after eight years of hope and
struggle, "The Rain God" was published
in 1984 by Alexandrian Press.
Though the press is no longer operat
ing, Suppes keeps faithfully printing
copies of "The Rain God" for people who

want them and, just two weeks ago, the
novel sold out of its 12th printing.
Islas said there is a great demand be
cause "a lot of people use 'The Rain God'
in Chicano literature classes around the
country."
With "The Rain God" finally published,
Islas began working on "Migrant Souls"
in fall 1985. The first chapter was pub
lished in a magazine in 1986, and the
novel was completed by June 1989.
But once again, Islas "almost died" in
January 1989. His illness became so
serious that doctors asked him if he
wanted them to use "any means neces
sary" to keep him alive. He underwent
treatment again, overcame the disease
and managed to finish "Migrant Souls."
But even after his second close call
with death, Islas continues to work as
hard as ever.
Islas said the writing of "Migrant
Souls" was different from that of "The
Rain God."
"Writing 'The Rain God,' I would wake
up early and work until noon," he ex
plained. "But for 'Migrant Souls,' some
times I would not get to it until after
dinner and then sometimes I would write
until it was very late.
"I trrite on a typewriter, and I write
in sceijes," he added. "I don't worry about
connecting scenes. Time is the hardest
thing for me to get right. I write in a
circular way and an inner coherence
develops and connects scenes.
"When I started writing 'The Rain
God,' I had the beginning and the end,"
Islas said. "I just needed to get the big
middle.
"With 'Migrant Souls,' I had no idea
how it would end," he continued. "I
started to worry about it a lot two weeks
before the deadline; then the ending came
to me, and I knew it was right.
"In the book, I wanted to look at the
border culture," Islas said. "It is fasci

nating — a treasure for a writer.
"I wanted to show the people there as
migrants, not immigrants," he continued.
"Much of this country was once Mexico.
Mexican-Americans feel at home in the
Southwest. They are not aliens, quite the
contrary. This is our country, our turf.
" 'Aliens,' every time that word is used,
I want to sere*m,".iTsUs dfcl&rec^' ff ls is£
dehumartizing.
"In 'Migrant Souls,' tne window I
wanted the reader to look through with
me is not common," Islas explained.
"Mexican-Americans are usually lumped
together with other Hispanics by Amer
icans.
"Every character in the book is a mi
grant soul," he added.
"In El Paso, people think I am overly
critical," Islas explained. Unlike "The
Rain God," which he said was "painful"
to write, Islas said writing "Migrant
Souls" was fun.
Islas said he views his work as a bridge
between Chicano and American litera

ture. He said he has been influenced by
the traditions of North American psycho
logical realism and Latin American magi
cal realism, and he cites a long list of
literary influences ranging from Marcel
Proust to Leo Tolstoy to E.M. Forster,
Henry James and Gabriel Garcia Mar
quez.
"Everyone I've read has been an in
fluence on me, even bad writers, because
from them I learned what not to do," he
explained.
Islas has written and published some
poetry in addition to his two novels but
has never published a collection of poems.
"Poems are like gifts," Islas remarked.
"Many of my poems sit in my drawer.
They are too depressing to publish."
In the future, Islas plans to finish a
collection of novels about the Angel fam
ily that appears in both "Migrant Souls"
and"The Rain God."
"The collection may go on for more
than three novels," he said. "I've had
scenes in my head for a while."
Despite his successes, Islas is still
struggling. "Migrant Souls" was the first
novel written by someone from the Chi
cano community about the Chicano com
munity to be printed by a major New
York publishing house.
And even then, the first printing of
"Migrant Souls" was only 6,000 copies.
But last week, "Migrant Souls" was
number 10 on the Bay Area bestsellers
list and, according to Islas, that is another
first for a Chicano fiction writer.
"It's a shame because there are a lot
of talented Chicano writers out there,"
Islas said.
Islas added that until New York
reviewers notice his book, he will not
have really made it.
But the 51-year-old author said he will
keep writing and trying "if health and
time permits.
