"Stay with us then, Dorothy. We all
love you — we don't want you to go."
The Cowardly Lion's plea has become
the seductive siren song of a motion
picture dreamland that dazzles us still
after 50 years. "The Wizard of Oz,"
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1939 classic, has
become a source for some of the most
compelling myths of American culture.
In their commemorative history of the
film, authors John Fricke, Jay Scarfone
and William Stillman reconstruct the
method behind the myth. Their book,
"The Wizard of Oz — The Official 50th
Anniversary Pictorial History" is the
most intellectually and aesthetically sat
isfying history of the film published to
date.
Beginning with an enlightened intro
duction by .lark Halpy, Jr — his father
played the Tin Man in "Oz" — Fricke
and his colleagues have combined exhaus
tive research with exhilarating illustra
tions of the film classic to chronicle the
journey of "Oz" from the literary dream

of one man to the
yearly pilgrimage
of millions.
Among the
volume's dazzling
collection of photos
are rare "stills"
from ousted direc
tor Richard
Thorpe's scenes,
makeup and cos
tume test shots,
pages of "candids"
taken between
scenes on the set
and photos which
document the
film's boisterously
ballyhooed debut.
In this smart
history, "Oz" en
thusiasts and
trivia buffs can

find detailed answers to nagging ques
tions: What really happened to Buddy
Ebsen, the original Tin Man? How much
did it cost the studio to create a cyclone?
Were "The Singer Midgets," who became
Munchkins, truly an infamous troupe of
destructive carousers and ne'er-do-wells?
Were Dorothy and the Tin Man supposed
to fall in love?
"The Pictorial History" sportingly ex
amines many of the myths that stand as

popular apocrypha
beside the sacred
text. Of course, in
its "official"
capacity the book is
a public relations
product — several
of the personality
conflicts high
lighted (perhaps
exaggerated) in
Aljean Harmetz's
history "The
Making of the
Wizard of Oz" are
ignored or
smoothed over in
Fricke's study.
But Fricke and
his colleagues
faithfully capture
the conflicts and
fl Iff ifll 11 ipe that

plagued the production of the film. After
Buddy Ebsen's untimely departure from
the project due to illness, director Richard
Thorpe was dismissed.
Thorpe's concept of the picture — in
cluding a blonde, frivolous Dorothy and
a slapstick, vaudevillian atmosphere
throughout the film — were discarded
in favor of the tempered vision of Victor
Fleming.
The co-authors chronicle Fleming's

heroic efforts to re-shape the film from
an eccentric lark into a focused odyssey
of heart and home.
Perhaps Fleming's greatest contribu
tion to the film was his success at con
vincing a young Judy Garland to "play
Dorothy straight" alongside the unlikely,
unimaginable vagaries of Oz. Dorothy's
steadfast simplicity is the film's strongest
tie to anything like emotional reaJity and
is perhaps the secret of its success.
In a refreshing examination of the
film's debut, Fricke, Scarfone and Stil
lman put to rest the unhappy myth that
"Oz" was a flop at its first release in
1939. Harmetz' history of the film had
romanticized the idea that "Oz" was an
unappreciated classic among theater
goers of the day.
But Fricke's history includes a wide
sampling of film reviews, printed in their
entirety, which indicate the aesthetic and
popular success of "Oz." While some
reviews panned the film, most critics
were more than enthusiastic.
Similarly, photos of the crushing
crowds waiting to see the film in cities
where it had been running for several
weeks attest to its immediate power over
the public.
Indeed, this visually enchanting volume
is a treasure-trove of memorable images
and unforgettable facts surrounding
America's best-known film. As you watch

the saga again this evening, keep an eye
on Judy Garland's braids during the scene
in which she meets the scarecrow — they
alternate between ponderously long and
pertly short.
Fricke and other bemused viewers can
only surmise that the scene was spliced
from several "takes" filmed at various
stages during the production of "Oz."
Other inconsistencies of the cult classic
are examined in"The Pictorial History."
For example, when Aunt Em chides
farmhand Hickory for "tinkering with
that contraption," she is referring to a
scene, cut from the final film, in which
actor Jack Haley "perfected" an invention
designed to prevent cyclones.
Several other scenes and some musical
numbers were cut from the film before
its release. But Fricke and his co-authors
assert that the streamlined story we
know today represents the very best work
of Hollywood's mythmakers.
"All analysis aside," Fricke writes, "Oz
is loved because the millions subject to
its magic can enjoy it in so many ways.
It offers a rare opportunity for involve
ment and participation, a joyous, restora
tive, warming entree to a place where —
however briefly — there isn't anv trou
ble."

unimaginable vagaries of Oz. Dorothy's
steadfast simplicity is the film's strongest
tie to anything like emotional reaJity and
is perhaps the secret of its success.
In a refreshing examination of the
film's debut, Fricke, Scarfone and Stil
lman put to rest the unhappy myth that
"Oz" was a flop at its first release in
1939. Harmetz' history of the film had
romanticized the idea that "Oz" was an
unappreciated classic among theater
goers of the day.
But Fricke's history includes a wide
sampling of film reviews, printed in their
entirety, which indicate the aesthetic and
popular success of "Oz." While some
reviews panned the film, most critics
were more than enthusiastic.
Similarly, photos of the crushing
crowds waiting to see the film in cities
where it had been running for several
weeks attest to its immediate power over
the public.
Indeed, this visually enchanting volume
is a treasure-trove of memorable images
and unforgettable facts surrounding
America's best-known film. As you watch

the saga again this evening, keep an eye
on Judy Garland's braids during the scene
in which she meets the scarecrow — they
alternate between ponderously long and
pertly short.
Fricke and other bemused viewers can
only surmise that the scene was spliced
from several "takes" filmed at various
stages during the production of "Oz."
Other inconsistencies of the cult classic
are examined in"The Pictorial History."
For example, when Aunt Em chides
farmhand Hickory for "tinkering with
that contraption," she is referring to a
scene, cut from the final film, in which
actor Jack Haley "perfected" an invention
designed to prevent cyclones.
Several other scenes and some musical
numbers were cut from the film before
its release. But Fricke and his co-authors
assert that the streamlined story we
know today represents the very best work
of Hollywood's mythmakers.
"All analysis aside," Fricke writes, "Oz
is loved because the millions subject to
its magic can enjoy it in so many ways.
It offers a rare opportunity for involve
ment and participation, a joyous, restora
tive, warming entree to a place where —
however briefly — there isn't anv trou
ble."

"Stay with us then, Dorothy. We all
love you — we don't want you to go."
The Cowardly Lion's plea has become
the seductive siren song of a motion
picture dreamland that dazzles us still
after 50 years. "The Wizard of Oz,"
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1939 classic, has
become a source for some of the most
compelling myths of American culture.
In their commemorative history of the
film, authors John Fricke, Jay Scarfone
and William Stillman reconstruct the
method behind the myth. Their book,
"The Wizard of Oz — The Official 50th
Anniversary Pictorial History" is the
most intellectually and aesthetically sat
isfying history of the film published to
date.
Beginning with an enlightened intro
duction by .lark Halpy, Jr — his father
played the Tin Man in "Oz" — Fricke
and his colleagues have combined exhaus
tive research with exhilarating illustra
tions of the film classic to chronicle the
journey of "Oz" from the literary dream

of one man to the
yearly pilgrimage
of millions.
Among the
volume's dazzling
collection of photos
are rare "stills"
from ousted direc
tor Richard
Thorpe's scenes,
makeup and cos
tume test shots,
pages of "candids"
taken between
scenes on the set
and photos which
document the
film's boisterously
ballyhooed debut.
In this smart
history, "Oz" en
thusiasts and
trivia buffs can

find detailed answers to nagging ques
tions: What really happened to Buddy
Ebsen, the original Tin Man? How much
did it cost the studio to create a cyclone?
Were "The Singer Midgets," who became
Munchkins, truly an infamous troupe of
destructive carousers and ne'er-do-wells?
Were Dorothy and the Tin Man supposed
to fall in love?
"The Pictorial History" sportingly ex
amines many of the myths that stand as

popular apocrypha
beside the sacred
text. Of course, in
its "official"
capacity the book is
a public relations
product — several
of the personality
conflicts high
lighted (perhaps
exaggerated) in
Aljean Harmetz's
history "The
Making of the
Wizard of Oz" are
ignored or
smoothed over in
Fricke's study.
But Fricke and
his colleagues
faithfully capture
the conflicts and
fl Iff ifll 11 ipe that

plagued the production of the film. After
Buddy Ebsen's untimely departure from
the project due to illness, director Richard
Thorpe was dismissed.
Thorpe's concept of the picture — in
cluding a blonde, frivolous Dorothy and
a slapstick, vaudevillian atmosphere
throughout the film — were discarded
in favor of the tempered vision of Victor
Fleming.
The co-authors chronicle Fleming's

heroic efforts to re-shape the film from
an eccentric lark into a focused odyssey
of heart and home.
