## Card brings down house that Wooden built 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - The last
time the Stanford men's basket
ball team swept the season series
against UCLA, the year was 1942
and the Cardinal was on its way
to winning the NCAA Champion
ship.
The last time, that is, until Sun
day afternoon. While a repeat per
formance in the NCAA Tourna
ment doesn't seem likely, the Car
dinal players looked like they had
won the national title after hold
ing on for a 70-69 victory over
the Bruins in Pauley Pavilion.

Cardinal 70
Bruins 69

The win, Stanford's first ever
in 25 tries at Pauley, upped the
Cardinal's record to 15-8 overall,
7-7 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The Bruins, who were swept at
home by Stanford and California
for the first time since 1948 this
past weekend, fall to 16-7 overall,
9-5 in the Pac-10.
"Wow," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said after the game.
"The first halfs about as well as
we could play. ... The second half
was rocky, but we hung in there.
I'm extremely proud, especially of
the young kids, who hung in there
against the adversity."
Before the game there were a
million reasons why Stanford
would lose and none why the Car
dinal could win. Stanford had lost
five straight road games, was
coming off a disappointing loss to
USC three days before and hadn't
defeated the Bruins on their home
court since 1952 (Stanford did
defeat UCLA in the Forum in In
glewood in the Pac-10 Tourna
ment last year, however).
Meanwhile, UCLA was still mad
about losing to Stanford at Maples
Pavilion last month, was even
more upset about losing to Cal in
Pauley Thursday night and had
a sellout crowd of 10,936 and 10
NCAA Championship banners in
the rafters to support them.
But the Cardinal was not in
timidated. "As a player it doesn't
mean much to me," Adam Keefe
said. "When they were winning
their titles, I was five or six years
old."
Behind the post play of Andrew
Vlahov, Stanford pulled out to a

37-26 halftime lead. Vlahov made
7-of-10 shots for 14 points in the
first half and added six rebounds.
The Bruins were keying on Keefe,
the Cardinal's leading scorer, in
the low post, and Vlahov was able
to go one-on-one on the other side
of the lane.
Vlahov would finish with a
career-high 20 points and eight
rebounds. Keefe added 17 points
and 10 boards.
The second half started with
Keefe and Don Mac Lean exchang
ing a pair of free throws, then
the Bruins began an 8-0 run that
would cut the lead to 39-37. With
14:57 to go in the game, Trevor
Wilson tried to go in for a
breakaway dunk but was fouled
by Stanford guard John Patrick.
Wilson made one free throw to
complete the run, and Patrick was
forced to leave the game with his
fourth foul.
Guard Kenny Ammann hit a
three-pointer to regain momen
tum for the Cardinal, but then
he too committed his fourth foul,
only 30 seconds after Patrick did.
With those two on the bench,
Montgomery thus went almost
the entire second half with a pair
of freshman guards: Marcus Lollie
and redshirt freshman Peter
Dukes.
But despite the fact that UCLA
pressed exclusively throughout
the second half, Lollie and Dukes
maintained their composure.
The frontline of Keefe, Vlahov
and Deshon Wingate scored the
Cardinal's next 17 points and
helped the Cardinal up the lead
to 59-50. Wingate, however,
picked up his fourth foul and left
with nine minutes remaining.
Bruin point guard Darrick Martin
scored twice off drives to the
bucket to narrow it to 59-54.
Derek Bruton made one free
throw to up the lead to six, but
Mitchell Butler hit a short
baseline shot to cut it to four.
Dukes responded by taking, and
making, his only shot of the game,
a pull-up jumper from 12 feet.
Bruton made another free throw,
and Keefe hit a pair from the line
to give Stanford a 65-56 lead.
Martin tried to drive again but
got called for running into Lollie
after he passed the ball. Lollie
then stepped to the line for a cri
tical one-and-one. His first shot
took a scenic tour of the rim and
backboard before rolling in; he
calmly swished the second one.
