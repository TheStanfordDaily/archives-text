# Frosh beats ghosts to end L.A. jinx

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - A list of the
longest futility streaks in sport
would be incomplete without an
entry that reads "Consecutive
years without a field goal: Charlie
Brown, 40." At this very moment,
the lovable loser is probably out
on a field somewhere still trying
to kick the football before Lucy
pulls it away.
Sunday in Pauley Pavilion, the
Stanford Cardinal, a blood
brother of the "Peanuts" protag
onist, bested the Bruins, who were
playing without the services of
Miss Van Pelt, and placekicked
their own personal pigskin out of
the record books after a 38-year
wait.
While the Chicago Cubs con
tinue their wait for a World Series
ring and the New York Rangers
keep praying for a Stanley Cup,
the Stanford's men's basketball
team can savor its first victory
on UCLA's home court since a
73-71 triumph in the days when
the President of the United States
signed his letters "Harry S
Truman."
The historical significance of
the victory was not lost on the
Cardinal when it was over, but
clearly played second fiddle to the
emotion. Coach Mike Mont
gomery's first word was "wow."
Forward Andrew Vlahov's was
"euphoria."
Who could fault them for ex
pressing their joy? The Cardinal
overcame its five-game road
losing streak, 10 Bruin champi
onship banners, 23 losses in the
House that John Wooden built,
24 turnovers and 10,936 UCLA
partisans as the team put new
life into its dying season with a
most improbable 70-69 victory.
When the Cardinal took a 7-5
lead two minutes into the game,
it seemed innocent enough. But
Stanford never relinquished its
advantage. With 3:51 left to play,
freshman Marcus Lollie hit two
free throws to put the Cardinal
56. As the officials sig
naled for the television timeout,
the lead appeared to be safe.
Losing streaks like Stanford's
do not end easily, though. The
Bruins came charging back with
a pressure defense that kept the
Cardinal from getting the ball
across halfcourt. trimmed
the lead to two, 68-66, before
Lollie once again went to the line
for a one-and-one.
He needed to make both foul
shots to seal the victory. The
Bruins knew that. His teammates
knew that. He knew that. It was
Marcus Lollie, all alone on the
free throw line, versus the ghosts
of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Wal
ton, Sidney Wicks, Jamaal Wilkes
(who was in attendance) and
Wooden himself (also in attend
ance, as always).
Undaunted, Lollie sunk both
shots to make the lead 70-66. A
basket by Gerald Madkins set up
an opportunity for Trevor Wilson
to tie the game with four seconds
remaining. The notorious 6-foot-8
UCLA senior, who is probably
headed for the NBA, was unable
to duplicate the feat of the 6-foot
Stanford freshman from Seattle,
and Stanford had its first win in
Pauley.

Once a little-used reserve, Lollie
has seen his playing time increase
greatly in recent weeks and is
progressing nicely. "Coach Mike
Montgomery has started to have
more confidence in me. That's
helped me a lot," Lollie said.
When starters John Patrick and
Kenny Ammann collected fouls in
the early going, Lollie knew he
would be called on again. "I saw
them get into foul trouble," he
said. "I was ready to come into
the game."
So there he stood, with the
game in his hands, courtesy of a
Wilson foul. "I wasn't nervous,"
Lollie said. "I just wanted to step
up to the line.
"I've visualized being in that
situation. It was no different from
what I practice for," he added.
"When you're a kid and you're
out shooting hoops with your
friend and you're counting down
3-2-1 ... It was kind of like that,"
Lollie explained.
He recalled the game at Oregon
two weeks ago, when he had an
opportunity to win the game for
the Cardinal. Lollie dribbled the
ball up court and had a chance
to take it to the hoop for a game
winning layup. Instead, he dished
off to Vlahov, who ended up miss

ing a jumper.
"I had a chance to make a play
(at Oregon), and I didn't," he said.
Vlahov also had a chance to make
that play — and didn't. Sunday,
though, Vlahov made all the plays.
The beleaguered junior forward
struggled early this season as a
perimeter player. When Deshon
Wingate was inserted into the
starting lineup, Vlahov was able
to move to the low post, and he
has thrived.
In Thursday's loss to USC,
Vlahov matched his career best
with 15 points. In the UCLA
game, he bettered that by five
and also grabbed eight rebounds.
While UCLA Coach Jim Harrick
designed a defense to key on Adam
Keefe, Vlahov posted 14 first-half
points as Stanford jumped ahead
37-26 at the intermission.
"I'm not trying as hard any
more. I'm just trying to let it
flow," Vlahov said of his recent
success.
Whatever the reason, Vlahov
has become the catalyst for the
resurgent Cardinal. The victory
Sunday will go a long way toward
earning Stanford its third straight
postseason appearance. For a
team that went 46 years without
one, that's certainly not peanuts.

Once a little-used reserve, Lollie
has seen his playing time increase
greatly in recent weeks and is
progressing nicely. "Coach Mike
Montgomery has started to have
more confidence in me. That's
helped me a lot," Lollie said.
When starters John Patrick and
Kenny Ammann collected fouls in
the early going, Lollie knew he
would be called on again. "I saw
them get into foul trouble," he
said. "I was ready to come into
the game."
So there he stood, with the
game in his hands, courtesy of a
Wilson foul. "I wasn't nervous,"
Lollie said. "I just wanted to step
up to the line.
"I've visualized being in that
situation. It was no different from
what I practice for," he added.
"When you're a kid and you're
out shooting hoops with your
friend and you're counting down
3-2-1 ... It was kind of like that,"
Lollie explained.
He recalled the game at Oregon
two weeks ago, when he had an
opportunity to win the game for
the Cardinal. Lollie dribbled the
ball up court and had a chance
to take it to the hoop for a game
winning layup. Instead, he dished
off to Vlahov, who ended up miss

ing a jumper.
"I had a chance to make a play
(at Oregon), and I didn't," he said.
Vlahov also had a chance to make
that play — and didn't. Sunday,
though, Vlahov made all the plays.
The beleaguered junior forward
struggled early this season as a
perimeter player. When Deshon
Wingate was inserted into the
starting lineup, Vlahov was able
to move to the low post, and he
has thrived.
In Thursday's loss to USC,
Vlahov matched his career best
with 15 points. In the UCLA
game, he bettered that by five
and also grabbed eight rebounds.
While UCLA Coach Jim Harrick
designed a defense to key on Adam
Keefe, Vlahov posted 14 first-half
points as Stanford jumped ahead
37-26 at the intermission.
"I'm not trying as hard any
more. I'm just trying to let it
flow," Vlahov said of his recent
success.
Whatever the reason, Vlahov
has become the catalyst for the
resurgent Cardinal. The victory
Sunday will go a long way toward
earning Stanford its third straight
postseason appearance. For a
team that went 46 years without
one, that's certainly not peanuts.
LOS ANGELES - A list of the
longest futility streaks in sport
would be incomplete without an
entry that reads "Consecutive
years without a field goal: Charlie
Brown, 40." At this very moment,
the lovable loser is probably out
on a field somewhere still trying
to kick the football before Lucy
pulls it away.
Sunday in Pauley Pavilion, the
Stanford Cardinal, a blood
brother of the "Peanuts" protag
onist, bested the Bruins, who were
playing without the services of
Miss Van Pelt, and placekicked
their own personal pigskin out of
the record books after a 38-year
wait.
While the Chicago Cubs con
tinue their wait for a World Series
ring and the New York Rangers
keep praying for a Stanley Cup,
the Stanford's men's basketball
team can savor its first victory
on UCLA's home court since a
73-71 triumph in the days when
the President of the United States
signed his letters "Harry S
Truman."
The historical significance of
the victory was not lost on the
Cardinal when it was over, but
clearly played second fiddle to the
emotion. Coach Mike Mont
gomery's first word was "wow."
Forward Andrew Vlahov's was
"euphoria."
Who could fault them for ex
pressing their joy? The Cardinal
overcame its five-game road
losing streak, 10 Bruin champi
onship banners, 23 losses in the
House that John Wooden built,
24 turnovers and 10,936 UCLA
partisans as the team put new
life into its dying season with a
most improbable 70-69 victory.
When the Cardinal took a 7-5
lead two minutes into the game,
it seemed innocent enough. But
Stanford never relinquished its
advantage. With 3:51 left to play,
freshman Marcus Lollie hit two
free throws to put the Cardinal
56. As the officials sig
naled for the television timeout,
the lead appeared to be safe.
Losing streaks like Stanford's
do not end easily, though. The
Bruins came charging back with
a pressure defense that kept the
Cardinal from getting the ball
across halfcourt. trimmed
the lead to two, 68-66, before
Lollie once again went to the line
for a one-and-one.
He needed to make both foul
shots to seal the victory. The
Bruins knew that. His teammates
knew that. He knew that. It was
Marcus Lollie, all alone on the
free throw line, versus the ghosts
of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Wal
ton, Sidney Wicks, Jamaal Wilkes
(who was in attendance) and
Wooden himself (also in attend
ance, as always).
Undaunted, Lollie sunk both
shots to make the lead 70-66. A
basket by Gerald Madkins set up
an opportunity for Trevor Wilson
to tie the game with four seconds
remaining. The notorious 6-foot-8
UCLA senior, who is probably
headed for the NBA, was unable
to duplicate the feat of the 6-foot
Stanford freshman from Seattle,
and Stanford had its first win in
Pauley.
