LOS ANGELES - A list of the
longest futility streaks in sport
would be incomplete without an
entry that reads "Consecutive
years without a field goal: Charlie
Brown, 40." At this very moment,
the lovable loser is probably out
on a field somewhere still trying
to kick the football before Lucy
pulls it away.
Sunday in Pauley Pavilion, the
Stanford Cardinal, a blood
brother of the "Peanuts" protag
onist, bested the Bruins, who were
playing without the services of
Miss Van Pelt, and placekicked
their own personal pigskin out of
the record books after a 38-year
wait.
While the Chicago Cubs con
tinue their wait for a World Series
ring and the New York Rangers
keep praying for a Stanley Cup,
the Stanford's men's basketball
team can savor its first victory
on UCLA's home court since a
73-71 triumph in the days when
the President of the United States
signed his letters "Harry S
Truman."
The historical significance of
the victory was not lost on the
Cardinal when it was over, but
clearly played second fiddle to the
emotion. Coach Mike Mont
gomery's first word was "wow."
Forward Andrew Vlahov's was
"euphoria."
Who could fault them for ex
pressing their joy? The Cardinal
overcame its five-game road
losing streak, 10 Bruin champi
onship banners, 23 losses in the
House that John Wooden built,
24 turnovers and 10,936 UCLA
partisans as the team put new
life into its dying season with a
most improbable 70-69 victory.
When the Cardinal took a 7-5
lead two minutes into the game,
it seemed innocent enough. But
Stanford never relinquished its
advantage. With 3:51 left to play,
freshman Marcus Lollie hit two
free throws to put the Cardinal
56. As the officials sig
naled for the television timeout,
the lead appeared to be safe.
Losing streaks like Stanford's
do not end easily, though. The
