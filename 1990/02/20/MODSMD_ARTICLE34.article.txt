# Fifty-point second half topples UCLA
## 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Dan Quayle is no John Kennedy, and the UCLA
Bruins certainly could not be confused with the
Boston Celtics Saturday night at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford's women's basketball team wore down
the injury-depleted Bruins, snaring a 91-65 victory
after trailing by three points at halftime. The Car
dinal beat the Bruins 40-12 during the final 13
minutes.

"If you have eight Celtics out there, it doesn't
matter how deep your bench is," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said, referring to UCLA's strong
first half.
But the Bruins, who dressed only eight players
for the game, were not worthy of comparison to
the Celtics and were clearly no match for the Car
dinal down the stretch.
Stanford, ranked No. 3 in the nation after a road
loss to Washington last weekend, stands at 22-1,
12-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference. The Bruins, who
beat California 80-66 Thursday to pull a Northern
California split, fall to 14-9, 9-4.
"It wasn't a lack of wanting to do the job," said
UCLA Coach Billie Moore. "We just got tired in the
second half."
"We physically ran down," Moore continued. "We
had to do the job on the boards, and they were
more physical, more aggressive in the second half."
Stanford, which handled the Bruins 98-80 in
Pauley Pavilion Jan. 18, trailed by as many as seven
points in the first half and limped into the break
down 44-41. The Bruins shot 65 percent in the first
half, sinking 17-of-26 field goal attempts. UCLA
also beat bigger Stanford on the boards, 17-15.
Bruin forward Rehema Stephens turned in a
Larry Bird-like performance in the first stanza,
tallying 16 points to lead all scorers.
Meanwhile, Trisha Stevens, Stanford's leading
scorer this season, picked up her third foul with
7:37 left in the first half and played only 10 minutes
for the game. Stevens finished with 13 points.
"Offensively we just never got into a flow in the
first half," said point guard Sonja Henning. "We
didn't take the initiative offensively."
UCLA stymied the Cardinal attack by mixing a
1-2-2 zone with a match-up zone and occasional
full-court pressure. With the exception of some
nimble internal passing from Val Whiting and Julie
Zeilstra, Stanford's attack against the zone was
often awkward.
It was only the third time this year and the first
time at home the Cardinal trailed at halftime. Thurs
day against USC Stanford led by only three at the
half before posting an 86-60 win.

overcame a first-half deficit to bury UCLA 91-65 at Maples Saturday night.
"We just came out flat," said
guard Jennifer Azzi, who led the
Cardinal with 19 points, 14 in the
second half. "Sometimes we just
do that. We need to start the game
like we played in the second half."
Those who visualized the par
quet floor and championship Cel
tic form in the Bruins were rudely
returned to reality in the second
half.
The Bruins' defensive strategy
backfired as Stanford found its
shooting range and picked apart
the UCLA zone. The Bruins
visibly tired as the game went on,
and their defensive energy sagged
just as the Maples Pavilion crowd
of 4,252 came to life. It was the
second largest home crowd in
school history.
"I think UCLA played a great
game," said VanDerveer, adding
that the Bruins were a legitimate
NCAA tournament team. "They
were very well prepared and very
well coached, and they did a really
good job. They got tired at the
end, and the crowd doesn't hurt."
Stanford attempted a school

record 23 three-point attempts
before the beleagured Bruins
broke out of their zone with four
minutes remaining. Azzi con
nected on 4 of 7 treys in the sec
ond half. After UCLA led 53-51,
Azzi drilled three three-pointers
in a six minute push that put the
Cardinal ahead 76-62.
"In the first half their defensive
gamble paid off," said VanDer
veer. "I just told them to go out
and bust 'em. Jennifer and Katy
(Steding) are among the best
three-point shooters in the coun
try."
With Azzi, Steding and Henning
zeroing in from long distance, the
Bruin zone weakened inside, al
lowing Whiting, Zeilstra and
Stevens to go to work in the paint.
Stanford out-rebounded UCLA
27-15 in the second half, as the
Cardinal, led by Zeilstra's game
high 12, grabbed 15 offensive and
12 defensive boards.
Six Stanford players scored in
double figures, while Stephens
was only 2-of-8 from the field in
the second half, finishing with 23
points for UCLA.
The Stanford win snapped
UCLA's four-game winning
streak.
