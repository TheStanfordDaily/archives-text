# Batsmen escape L.A. with two league wins
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - You know
it's going to be a long weekend
when it takes 49 hours and 55
minutes to play a baseball
game.
Game one of this weekend's
Stanford-UCLA series, which
began Friday night in a steady
rain, ended two days, two hours
and just about two inches of
rain later with the Cardinal on
top 16-5.
And, on a weekend in which
nothing came off as planned,
that was pretty much par for
the course.

Baseball

Cardinal takes two of
three from Bruins

Actually, the concept of
"plan" took a severe beating
over the course of the four days
in Westwood. Star pitchers
from both teams got shelled,
but a Bruin hurler with an
ERA almost as large as his shoe
size shut Stanford down for six
innings in the Bruins' 5-3 win
in the first game of yesterday's
doubleheader.
Things stayed weird in the
nightcap, until a heads-up play
by Stanford's Troy Paulsen
brought home the winning run
in the top of the ninth. Most
of the weekend's disruptions,
though, were caused by the
weather, which, as well as
making the two innings played
on Friday completely
miserable, forced the cancella
tion of play on Saturday, moved
Sunday's continuation to a 7
p.m. start and made the teams
play a noon doubleheader yes
terday.
The two-day interruption of
game one wasn't completely
painful for Stanford, though,
because when play was halted
on Friday the Cardinal was
leading 10-2. UCLA's John
Sutherland, who entered the

game 3-0, gave up six runs in
the wet one-third of an inning
he pitched, giving himself an
early pass home when Roger
Burnett — who would go 2-for
-5 with four RBI — cleared the
bases with a one-out double.
With the Bruins in an 8-0
hole before coming to bat, the
first game was basically over
almost two days before reliever
Aaron Dorlarque, who pitched
seven solid innings on Sunday
night, recorded the final out.
The wait wasn't exactly fun.
"It was tough," right fielder
Paul Carey said following the
seven-inning wind-bombarded
wrap-up. "You have to give us
credit — we've been just sitting
in the hotel for two days, doing
nothing."
The layoff didn't seem to
bother Carey — in the eighth
inning, he connected on a Mike
Lewis fastball, sending it
toward right center field. The
wind grabbed the shot and sent
it towards the foul pole, and
when it bounced off the pole,
Carey had his 43rd career home
run — breaking Rick
Lundblade's school record.
"It felt really good," Carey
said. "The past couple of years
there's been pressure to start
the season with home runs, and
it just feels good to get this
over with."
The homer — along with
UCLA's school-record seven er
rors and wind that came
straight from the polar regions
— provided most of the incred
ibly cold evening's entertain
ment.
"(Sunday) was the worst,"
Carey said. "I hit a couple balls
the best I ever have, but they
didn't go anywhere."
Conditions were, to say the
least, a little more pleasant yes
terday. The sun was out, the
temperature was warm .. . but,
at least in the early game, the
once-hot Cardinal bats were
cold.
After pounding 15 hits in Fri
day/Sunday's game, Stanford
could only manage four scattered
singles and a double off Bruin
starter Tim Lindsay, who before
the game had an 8.31 ERA.
For their part, the Bruins
reached Cardinal starter Mike
Mussina early, scoring five runs
in the first three innings before
Mussina — who might have been
showing the effects of not pitching
for nine days — settled down.
The second inning turned out
to be decisive. With two down and
a man on first, Mussina blew a
fastball by David Ravitz for an
apparent third strike. The entire
defense took off for the dugout,
but the pitch was called a ball.
Ravitz then pulled a walk, Shawn
Wills singled and Robbie Kat
zaroff tripled everyone home.
"(Mussina) got two bad calls,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "But then we couldn't get
the hits to help him."
When Chris Pritchett homered
to lead off the third, Stanford was
down 5-1, and despite another
Carey home run — this one a
monster to center — could not
come back.
For the game, Stanford left nine
men on base — five of them in
scoring position.
The series finale was a pitchers'
duel for the first five innings, de
spite a leadoff home run from
Stanford's Jeff Hammonds. Bruin
pitcher Scott Schanz made only
two more mistakes in the next
six innings — one of which be
came Tim Griffin's fifth homer of
the season — and exited in the
seventh with eight strikeouts and
only two walks.
Even with Schanz' perform
ance, UCLA was down 3-2 when
he left, thanks mainly to Cardinal

starter Stan Spencer. Spencer,
who pitched the two innings on
Friday, was spectacular in his first
five innings of work, keeping the
Bruins muzzled on just one infield
hit.
Things started to come un
raveled for Spencer in the sixth.
The Bruins turned three singles
into two runs, and when Paul Ellis
konged a two-run homer — his
eighth of the year — in the
seventh, UCLA had a 4-3 lead.
Stanford broke through in the
top of the ninth when pinch hitter
Mark Skeels drew a walk and Da
vid Holbrook singled. With pinch
runners Mike Eicher on second
and Ryan Turner on first, Bur
nett hit a sacrifice fly to center
to move up Eicher. Eicher scored
when Troy Tallman flew out to
the wall, and, after a steal by
Turner and a walk to Hammonds,
Turner scored on a single by Paul
sen, who finished the weekend 9-
for-16.
With two down, Paulsen was
picked off by Zancanaro but man
aged to avoid the tag long enough
for Hammonds to steal home. Ac
tually, "avoid the tag" doesn't
really do the play justice: Paulsen
kept the entire Bruin infield oc
cupied for almost 20 seconds in
a classic, catch-me-if-you-can run
down. Six-four Stanford.
"It was a good play, a head's-up
play by Troy," Marquess said.
Not quite over yet, though.
Brian Sackinsky, who had taken
over for Spencer an inning earlier,
gave up a leadoff homer to Ellis
in the bottom of the ninth. One
out later, David Tokheim doubled
to left — and then went to third
on a wild pitch.
That was it. With the tying run
on third, Sackinsky got Mike
Hankins to line out to Paulsen at
second, and Ravitz ended the
game by grounding out to short.

Carey had his 43rd career home
run — breaking Rick
Lundblade's school record.
"It felt really good," Carey
said. "The past couple of years
there's been pressure to start
the season with home runs, and
it just feels good to get this
over with."
The homer — along with
UCLA's school-record seven er
rors and wind that came
straight from the polar regions
— provided most of the incred
ibly cold evening's entertain
ment.
"(Sunday) was the worst,"
Carey said. "I hit a couple balls
the best I ever have, but they
didn't go anywhere."
Conditions were, to say the
least, a little more pleasant yes
terday. The sun was out, the
temperature was warm .. . but,
at least in the early game, the
once-hot Cardinal bats were
cold.
After pounding 15 hits in Fri
day/Sunday's game, Stanford
could only manage four scattered
singles and a double off Bruin
starter Tim Lindsay, who before
the game had an 8.31 ERA.
For their part, the Bruins
reached Cardinal starter Mike
Mussina early, scoring five runs
in the first three innings before
Mussina — who might have been
showing the effects of not pitching
for nine days — settled down.
The second inning turned out
to be decisive. With two down and
a man on first, Mussina blew a
fastball by David Ravitz for an
apparent third strike. The entire
defense took off for the dugout,
but the pitch was called a ball.
Ravitz then pulled a walk, Shawn
Wills singled and Robbie Kat
zaroff tripled everyone home.
"(Mussina) got two bad calls,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "But then we couldn't get
the hits to help him."
When Chris Pritchett homered
to lead off the third, Stanford was
down 5-1, and despite another
Carey home run — this one a
monster to center — could not
come back.
For the game, Stanford left nine
men on base — five of them in
scoring position.
The series finale was a pitchers'
duel for the first five innings, de
spite a leadoff home run from
Stanford's Jeff Hammonds. Bruin
pitcher Scott Schanz made only
two more mistakes in the next
six innings — one of which be
came Tim Griffin's fifth homer of
the season — and exited in the
seventh with eight strikeouts and
only two walks.
Even with Schanz' perform
ance, UCLA was down 3-2 when
he left, thanks mainly to Cardinal

starter Stan Spencer. Spencer,
who pitched the two innings on
Friday, was spectacular in his first
five innings of work, keeping the
Bruins muzzled on just one infield
hit.
Things started to come un
raveled for Spencer in the sixth.
The Bruins turned three singles
into two runs, and when Paul Ellis
konged a two-run homer — his
eighth of the year — in the
seventh, UCLA had a 4-3 lead.
Stanford broke through in the
top of the ninth when pinch hitter
Mark Skeels drew a walk and Da
vid Holbrook singled. With pinch
runners Mike Eicher on second
and Ryan Turner on first, Bur
nett hit a sacrifice fly to center
to move up Eicher. Eicher scored
when Troy Tallman flew out to
the wall, and, after a steal by
Turner and a walk to Hammonds,
Turner scored on a single by Paul
sen, who finished the weekend 9-
for-16.
With two down, Paulsen was
picked off by Zancanaro but man
aged to avoid the tag long enough
for Hammonds to steal home. Ac
tually, "avoid the tag" doesn't
really do the play justice: Paulsen
kept the entire Bruin infield oc
cupied for almost 20 seconds in
a classic, catch-me-if-you-can run
down. Six-four Stanford.
"It was a good play, a head's-up
play by Troy," Marquess said.
Not quite over yet, though.
Brian Sackinsky, who had taken
over for Spencer an inning earlier,
gave up a leadoff homer to Ellis
in the bottom of the ninth. One
out later, David Tokheim doubled
to left — and then went to third
on a wild pitch.
That was it. With the tying run
on third, Sackinsky got Mike
Hankins to line out to Paulsen at
second, and Ravitz ended the
game by grounding out to short.
LOS ANGELES - You know
it's going to be a long weekend
when it takes 49 hours and 55
minutes to play a baseball
game.
Game one of this weekend's
Stanford-UCLA series, which
began Friday night in a steady
rain, ended two days, two hours
and just about two inches of
rain later with the Cardinal on
top 16-5.
And, on a weekend in which
nothing came off as planned,
that was pretty much par for
the course.

Cardinal takes two of
three from Bruins

Actually, the concept of
"plan" took a severe beating
over the course of the four days
in Westwood. Star pitchers
from both teams got shelled,
but a Bruin hurler with an
ERA almost as large as his shoe
size shut Stanford down for six
innings in the Bruins' 5-3 win
in the first game of yesterday's
doubleheader.
Things stayed weird in the
nightcap, until a heads-up play
by Stanford's Troy Paulsen
brought home the winning run
in the top of the ninth. Most
of the weekend's disruptions,
though, were caused by the
weather, which, as well as
making the two innings played
on Friday completely
miserable, forced the cancella
tion of play on Saturday, moved
Sunday's continuation to a 7
p.m. start and made the teams
play a noon doubleheader yes
terday.
The two-day interruption of
game one wasn't completely
painful for Stanford, though,
because when play was halted
on Friday the Cardinal was
leading 10-2. UCLA's John
Sutherland, who entered the

game 3-0, gave up six runs in
the wet one-third of an inning
he pitched, giving himself an
early pass home when Roger
Burnett — who would go 2-for
-5 with four RBI — cleared the
bases with a one-out double.
With the Bruins in an 8-0
hole before coming to bat, the
first game was basically over
almost two days before reliever
Aaron Dorlarque, who pitched
seven solid innings on Sunday
night, recorded the final out.
The wait wasn't exactly fun.
"It was tough," right fielder
Paul Carey said following the
seven-inning wind-bombarded
wrap-up. "You have to give us
credit — we've been just sitting
in the hotel for two days, doing
nothing."
The layoff didn't seem to
bother Carey — in the eighth
inning, he connected on a Mike
Lewis fastball, sending it
toward right center field. The
wind grabbed the shot and sent
it towards the foul pole, and
when it bounced off the pole,
Carey had his 43rd career home
run — breaking Rick
Lundblade's school record.
"It felt really good," Carey
said. "The past couple of years
