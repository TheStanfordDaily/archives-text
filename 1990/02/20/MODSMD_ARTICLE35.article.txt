# Batsmen escape L.A. with two league wins

LOS ANGELES - You know
it's going to be a long weekend
when it takes 49 hours and 55
minutes to play a baseball
game.
Game one of this weekend's
Stanford-UCLA series, which
began Friday night in a steady
rain, ended two days, two hours
and just about two inches of
rain later with the Cardinal on
top 16-5.
And, on a weekend in which
nothing came off as planned,
that was pretty much par for
the course.

Cardinal takes two of
three from Bruins

Actually, the concept of
"plan" took a severe beating
over the course of the four days
in Westwood. Star pitchers
from both teams got shelled,
but a Bruin hurler with an
ERA almost as large as his shoe
size shut Stanford down for six
innings in the Bruins' 5-3 win
in the first game of yesterday's
doubleheader.
Things stayed weird in the
nightcap, until a heads-up play
by Stanford's Troy Paulsen
brought home the winning run
in the top of the ninth. Most
of the weekend's disruptions,
though, were caused by the
weather, which, as well as
making the two innings played
on Friday completely
miserable, forced the cancella
tion of play on Saturday, moved
Sunday's continuation to a 7
p.m. start and made the teams
play a noon doubleheader yes
terday.
The two-day interruption of
game one wasn't completely
painful for Stanford, though,
because when play was halted
on Friday the Cardinal was
leading 10-2. UCLA's John
Sutherland, who entered the

game 3-0, gave up six runs in
the wet one-third of an inning
he pitched, giving himself an
early pass home when Roger
Burnett — who would go 2-for
-5 with four RBI — cleared the
bases with a one-out double.
With the Bruins in an 8-0
hole before coming to bat, the
first game was basically over
almost two days before reliever
Aaron Dorlarque, who pitched
seven solid innings on Sunday
night, recorded the final out.
The wait wasn't exactly fun.
"It was tough," right fielder
Paul Carey said following the
seven-inning wind-bombarded
wrap-up. "You have to give us
credit — we've been just sitting
in the hotel for two days, doing
nothing."
The layoff didn't seem to
bother Carey — in the eighth
inning, he connected on a Mike
Lewis fastball, sending it
toward right center field. The
wind grabbed the shot and sent
it towards the foul pole, and
when it bounced off the pole,
Carey had his 43rd career home
run — breaking Rick
Lundblade's school record.
"It felt really good," Carey
said. "The past couple of years
there's been pressure to start
the season with home runs, and
it just feels good to get this
over with."
The homer — along with
UCLA's school-record seven er
rors and wind that came
straight from the polar regions
— provided most of the incred
ibly cold evening's entertain
ment.
"(Sunday) was the worst,"
Carey said. "I hit a couple balls
the best I ever have, but they
didn't go anywhere."
Conditions were, to say the
least, a little more pleasant yes
terday. The sun was out, the
temperature was warm .. . but,
at least in the early game, the
once-hot Cardinal bats were
cold.
