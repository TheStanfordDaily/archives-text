crawling home with a 74-68
defeat.
After California senior Roque
Santos pulled the Golden Bears
(8-5) ahead with a victory in the
200 breaststroke, the Cardinal
400 freestyle relay team needed
to win the final event to avoid
losing to the Bears for the second
year in a row. According to Cal
ifornia Coach Nort Thornton,
Stanford had not defeated his
Golden Bears in this event in a
dual meet since he began coaching
in 1975.
This fact, however, did not faze
the Cardinal.
"We have as solid of four guys
on our relay as any other team
in the country," freshman Erik
Maurer said. "We're real confident
that whenever the meet comes
down to the last event, we can
pull out a victory."
With that confidence, Maurer,
sophomore John deGroot and
senior Doug Lillydahl stayed even
with the Golden Bear team
through the first three legs of the
swim. In the final leg, senior
Byron Burson pulled ahead in the
final meters to finish in 2:58.69,
not only the fastest time of the
year for the Cardinal, but also a
NCAA qualifying time and a new
deGuerre Pool record. Both the

in 2:59.69, and the Stanford
swimmers recorded the first sub
three minute swims ever for the
400 relay in deGuerre, wiping out
the pool record of 3:00.67 that
Stanford had recorded about a
month ago against Arizona.
"Burson had a little extra in
centive, his last chance for a pool
record, that pushed him," Maurer
said. "None of us really likes
losing to Cal — or any other Pac
10 team for that matter — and
that added incentive paid off for
us."
In the fourth event, sophomore
Alex Kostich swam far ahead of
the other swimmers to take the
lead in the 1650 freestyle. Al
though his teammates encouraged
him to swim for the NCAA stand
ard throughout the mile race, Kos
tich came up short, just missing
the qualifying time of 15:22.24
and finishing second .
"At about the midpoint, I
realized that the meet was closer
than we thought," senior Rick
Gould said. "The team responded
well to the fine meet that Cal
swam."

Gould strengthened the team's
response with his performance in
the 200-backstroke, his final race
in a dual meet. With the meet
tied at 54, Gould finished in
1:51.33, just ahead of teammate
Jeff Rouse. The one-two finish
put the Cardinal up 62-55.
"I'm not really known for my
dual meet performances," Gould
said. "That was probably the first
time I've won an event in a big
dual meet. Yeah sure, I kind of
saved my best for last."
Stanford completed its 1989-90
dual meet season with a 6-3
record. The Cardinal will now
head into the pinnacle of the
swimming season, the Pacific 10
Championships and the NCAA
Championships. According to
Gould, the depth of the Cardinal
squad will become more evident
in these meets since the top 16,
not just the top two, times in each
event receive points.
"We're right on if not ahead of
where we expected to be," Gould
said. "Traditionally, Stanford al
ways seems to shine in the cham
pionship season."
