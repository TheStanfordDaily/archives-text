Setter Parker Blackman was so
appalled by his team's perform
ance Sunday night that afterward
he openly apologized to the fans
in attendance. But, regardless of
the arguably sub-par Cardinal ex
hibition, spectators at the week
end contest in Burnham Pavilion
could boast of witnessing a most
entertaining string of events.

Center stage that evening was
the No. 2 Stanford men's volley
ball team (5-1, 5-0 in the Western
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion) which was pushed to the
limit by No. 16 Loyola Mary
mount (1-6) before upending the
underrated Lions 15-13, 15-9, 15-
11. Yet, the final score is hardly
indicative of the events that
decorated the match.
First, there were the fans.
Having become a decided non
factor at recent volleyball con
tests, the crowd initially stayed
true to form — sparse and late
to-arrive.
Several ardent Cardinal die
hards strategically placed behind
the Loyola side and armed with
a team roster took it upon them
selves to change matters midway
through the first game. Playing
with the names of the LMU
players, the cheerers managed
noticeably to seize the attentions
of several Lions, and affecting
their concentration.
If that wasn't enough in the
way of diversions, one stray squir
rel managed to do the rest. As
Stanford attempted to extend a
9-3 advantage in the middle of
the second game, a squirrel that
had found its way into the pavil
ion scampered across the floor
halting play. Streaking into the
stands, it managed to evade pur
suit, find its way up to the bal
cony, and jump onto the scorer's
table a few minutes later.
Loyola Coach Mike Normand
provided the remainder of the en
tertainment, drawing a brisk
red-card warning at 4-2 of the
third game for a heated protest
of an official's call.
Meanwhile, an official NCAA
match was being played, often to
the heartache of many a Cardinal
rooter. "We were terrible," Parker
Blackman said. "We were real
tentative, and I was really disap
pointed. I apologize to the fans
for how poorly we played the
match."
"Parker's got a valid point,"
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm
added.
Making a number of uncharac
teristic mistakes throughout the
match, Stanford indeed had its
problems. Errant passing in the
first game led to a 13-10 Loyola
lead that required vintage siding
out efforts by senior Dan Hanan
to avoid a first game upset.
Powerful hitting by nationally
recognized Sio Saipaia catapulted
the Lions back into the second
game after a staunch 8-0 Cardinal
opening run. Similar play resulted
in a 9-4 Loyola advantage in the
third game as well.
The severity of the tone with

which both Blackmail and Sturm
spoke makes it easy to forget, how
ever, that the Cardinal did prevail.
Hanan, junior swing hitter
John Alstrom, sophomore Robert
Hillman and middle blocker Craig
Forsyth each contributed valuable
kills to side out during a seesaw
battle at 13-13 of the first game.
Sophomore Dave Goss, the team
leader in kills for much of the
season, entered the second game
off the bench for Stanford, ignit
ing a powerful charge. "Dave got
us a couple of quick kills and did
spark us," Sturm said.
Two Duncan Blackman blocks
initiated the second-game run
which was maintained by ft
searing Goss kill and two consecu
tive Goss jump serve aces. Duncan
Blackman rejoined the act, acing
twice at 12-7 to secure the out
come.
Falling behind early in the third
game, the Cardinal was forced to
battle back, anchored by eight kills
from Goss and four from Alstrom.
Alstrom also joined Hanan and
Duncan Blackman in stuffing
Saipaia for a crowd-pleasing block
at 12-7.
"John Alstrom played his best
match of the year," Sturm said.
Despite the self-deprecating
comments from the Cardinal,
Loyola Coach Normand was
nevertheless duly impressed.
"They played well," Normand
said. "I don't know if we could
play much better, but they were
in control. They're a good, strong
team."
Card notes
Stanford's match at UC-Davis,
scheduled for last night, was can
celled. The Davis players thought
Stanford was going to come up a week
ago Saturday, Feb. 9, but the Cardinal
schedule said Feb. 19. The match
could not be played last night because
most of the members of the Aggie
squad, and the coach, went skiing.
Although the Cardinal players may
not feel like they deserve it after Sun
day's match, Stanford will likely earn
the No. 1 ranking when the AVCA's
poll comes out this afternoon. Stan
ford was ranked in the top spot in
the preseason poll, but a loss to UCLA
in an early-season tournament gave
the Bruins the No. 1 spot in the first,
and every subsequent, poll.
UCLA fell to Long Beach State last
Wednesday, however, and that com
bined with the Cardinal's 3-0 week,
should give Stanford back the top
ranking. Interestingly enough, the
Cardinal's next match is against those
same upset-minded 49ers this Satur
day at Burnham Pavilion.
Hanan became the first Cardinal
player to be named the Molten-WIVA
Player of the Week yesterday. He won
the award for his performance in the
two wins over Hawaii Monday and
Tuesday and the win over Loyola
Marymount Sunday For the week he
had 71 kills and hit .484. He also
narrowly missed a triple-double in
each Hawaii match — he had 24 kills,
eight digs and 10 blocks the first night
and 29 kills, 23 digs and nine blocks
the second night.
Hillman earned the starting role in
the match after a fine performance
Tuesday night in Hawaii. In that
match Hillman made his debut in a
Stanford uniform, coming ofT the
bench to spark a Cardinal comeback
Stanford had lost the first two games
of the match but came back for a
five-game victory.
