# Stanford netters dominate at NorCal
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal spared only
three Bears and two Tigers this
past weekend as Stanford placed
three singles players and two
doubles teams in the semifinals
of the NorCal Intercollegiate
Tennis Championships at Cali
fornia's Hellman Tennis
Complex.
Junior Glenn Solomon scored
perhaps the most impressive win
en route to the semis, outlasting
San Jose State's No. 1 player,
Mike Chinchiolo, 7-5, 6-2, in the
quarterfinals.
In the round of 16, Chinchiolo
downed Stanford freshman
Jared Palmar, 6-1, 6-3. Solomon
was determined not to fall to
the same fate.

"[Chinchiolo] is the type of
competitor who plays well when
you try to play an up-tempo
game. Fortunately, my style of
playing consistently and picking
my times to attack kept him off
balance and didn't allow him to
play as well as he did against
Jared," Solomon said.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould
praised Solomon but played
down Palmer's loss, saying that
Palmer is not yet "match sharp"
following his knee surgery. "He
has only been playing matches
for a week and a half," Gould
said.
Solomon's opponent in the
semifinals will be teammate Alex
O'Brien, No. 2
seed. O'Brien waltzed through
the draw, beating California's
Bent-Ove Pedersen in yester

day's quarterfinals, 6-2, 6-4.
Cardinal freshman Johnathan
Stark, the tournament's No. 1
seed, also made it to the semi
finals and will face California's
No. 1 player, Doug Eisenman,
in what could be a preview of
the No. 1 singles match when
Stanford travels to California for
its last dual meet May 5.
Eisenman, the No. 4 seed,
reached the semifinals by dis
mantling another highly touted
Stanford freshman, Alexis
Hombrecher, 6-4, 6-1, in the
quarterfinals. According to
Gould, Hombrecher's serve,
usually the backbone of his
game, left him in key parts of
the match. Gould, however,
praised Hombrecher's return of
serve and said that the freshman

"gets better with each match."
Despite losing a close first
round match, Jason Yee refused
to let his teammates overshadow
him as the Cardinal sophomore
combined with Hombrecher to
reach the semifinals of the dou
bles competition. The Stanford
team will meet Igor Vuletic and
Mike Sandoz of the University
of the Pacific Tigers at 10 a.m.
In the other doubles semi
finals, Stark and Palmer will
square off against California's
Carl Chang and Barry Hancock.
The match will follow immedi
ately after Stark's singles match.
Stark and Palmer will have
the revenge factor on their side,
as the Bear duo downed the
Stanford tandem of Eric Peus
and Dan Turbow in straight sets
earlier in the tournament.
