# Injuries, judging hampers tired gymnasts
## Cardinal women let early scoring affect their performance in Cactus Classic 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
It just doesn't feel quite the same. . . .
Picture this — a few nights ago, you had
one of the greatest dates of your life. You
went to your favorite night spot, had a fan
tastic time and impressed your date. Now,
after a week filled with midterms in between
bouts with a cold, you're on another date,
this time at some unfamiliar place.
With a little embellishing, that could
describe what the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team has gone through in the last ten
days. After an outstanding and high-scoring
performance in Burnham Pavilion last Satur
day, the Cardinal tumblers traveled to Tucson,
Ariz, to compete in the Cactus Classic.
The physical and emotional letdowns of the
week, combined with lower-scoring judges,
took their toll as Stanford finished fourth

Cardinal fourth
at Cactus Classic

behind host Arizona, Michigan State and
Auburn.
Stanford started off with a strong perform
ance on floor exercise and scored well in the
event, highlighted by a 9.4 score for junior
Jennifer Bloom.
When the gymnasts proceeded to vault, their
performances remained strong at first. The
scores were lower, however, due to the high
level of difficulty in the vaults of Arizona,
the first team on the event. For example,
sophomore Nicki Kobrine earned a score of
8.95 for a handspring full vault which was
essentially the same as the one which earned

her a 9.4 at last Saturday's meet.
As the scores dropped, the team's spirits
seemed to drop with them.
"We paid more attention to the scores than
we should have, and that really brought us
down," Bloom said.
On bars, the squad's year-long personnel
problem made its presence felt once again.
Missing freshman Danielle Leone due to a
cold, Stanford's corps was weakened further
by a knee iryury which Erin McCann suffered
on floor exercise.
Perhaps the most impressive performance
of the evening for the Cardinal was by junior
Julie Dunhill on balance beam. Informed only
during the three-minute touch period just
prior to the event that she would be competing,
Dunhill avoided any falls and earned a score
of 8.95 for the Cardinal.
