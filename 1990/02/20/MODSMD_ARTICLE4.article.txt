# Ratliff calls Costa Rica a successful democracy

Amid the crowds marching in the
streets, horns blaring, green and white
flags of the National Liberation Party
and red and blue flags of the Social
Christian Unity Party fluttering, Hoo
ver Senior Research Fellow William
Ratliff witnessed Costa Rican democ
racy in action.
As a Latin America specialist at the
Hoover Institution, Ratliff spends
much of his time "looking at political
systems that don't work." However,
Ratliff said Costa Rica is an example
of "things that do work."
While there observing the demo
cratic election process two weeks ago,
he said he was impressed with the
Costa Ricans' dedication to democracy
in a country sandwiched between Nic
aragua and Panama.
Although Ratliff has visited Costa
Rica many times to collect documents
for the Hoover Librarv collection —

he estimates that he has been in every
medium- and large-sized town in the
country — his recent visit was the
first time he was there during an elec
tion.
According to Ratliff, Costfl Rica a
unique success story in Central
America because it is the only nation
with a legacy of democratic rule. Ci
vilian democracy has lasted almost a
century. Currently, Costa Rica has no
national army, a traditional instru
ment of totalitarian subjugation, Rat
liff said.
Ratliff calls Costa Rica is an
"inspiration" to the rest of Central
America. Opposition voices in Nicara
gua have pointed to Costa Rica's non
military police force as a model, and
the new Panamanian government is
also trying to follow Costa Rica's lead
as it reforms the Panamanian Defense
Forces.
While traveling in northern Costa
Rica, Ratliff saw many of the 200,000
Nicaraguan refugees who live along

the border. He said tensions exist be
tween these refugees, who make up
10 percent of the Costa Rican popula
tion, and the Costa Ricans living in
the area.
Ratliff also visited Panama during
his trip. He said almost all Panama
nians approve of the U.S. intervention
there in December. Many Panamani
ans were angry at Latin American
leaders for criticizing the United
States, believing Panama could not
have overthrown the regime of Gen.

Manuel Noriega without foreign assis
tance, Ratliff said.
Costa Rica is often overlooked in the
United States because "crisis points
are looked at more than well-settled
areas," according to RatlifT.
Negative U.S. press coverage causes
distorted stereotypes of Central
America, RatlifT said. The area is often
seen as an amorphous group of poor
totalitarian regimes, which he says is
"an insufferable caricature of Costa
Rica."
Americans have as much to learn
from Costa Rica's election system as
Central Americans do, according to
Ratliff.
Approximately 80 percent of Costa
Ricans vote in their national elections,
an "invigorating dedication to democ
racy that is lost in the United States,"
he said.
He noted that voting is required by
law in Costa Rica. However, this
statute is not enforced, Ratliff
added.
Ratliff saw civic participation
and education beginning at an
early age, with children through
out the country voting in mock
elections in their schools.
Costa Rican participation spans
"all groups, all ages, all over the
country," according to Ratliff. He
spent election eve in San Rafael,
"a small, northern border town
with barely a hotel."
And while the election took on
a festive atmosphere, the people
were also very serious about it.
In talking with the citizens of
San Rafael, as well other Costa
Ricans, Ratliff said he found them
well-informed about the candi
dates, their national political sys
tem and politics in general.
Ratliff is traveling south again
this week, this time to Venezuela,
in his role as Hoover curator of
the Americas Collection. He said
he looks forward to returning to
Costa Rica, his favorite political
system in Central America.
