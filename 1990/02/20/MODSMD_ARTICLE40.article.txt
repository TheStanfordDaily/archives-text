# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
With the miserable weather in the Bay
Area, who could blame a Stanford student
for heading south over the weekend in search
of sunny skies and warmer temperatures.
While Meredith McGrath and Andrew
Vlahov did not find great weather in Arizona
and Southern California, they did find time
to turn in performances worthy of recogni
tion and are thusly named The Daily's Ath
letes of the Week.

McGrath, a 5-foot-7 freshman from Mid
land, Mich., played No. 1 singles for the
women's tennis team in place of Sandra
Birch, who was suffering from the flu.
Thanks to McGrath's efforts, the Cardinal
did not skip a beat as the team won three
matches on the week.
Friday, the Cardinal opened its Pacific 10
Conference season at Arizona State.
McGrath bested Krista Amend 6-2, 6-3 as
Stanford won 5-3. A day later, McGrath
handled Arizona's Betsy Somerville 6-0, 7-6.
With the match still undecided heading into
doubles, McGrath and Teri Whitlinger knew
they needed a win there as well.
They got it, 6-3, 6-3 over Somerville and
Banni Redhair as Stanford triumphed 7-2
over the Wildcats.

Vlahov, a 6-7 junior from Perth, Australia,
matched his career high Thursday then bet
tered it by five Sunday as the men's bas
ketball team recorded its first ever win in
Pauley Pavilion.
When the Cardinal took on USC Thursday,
Vlahov's efforts could not prevent Stanford
from losing its fifth straight road game.
Still, his 15 points were a clear illustration
that Vlahov is becoming comfortable in his
role as the team's power forward.
Sunday, with UCLA doing everything it
could to contain super sophomore Adam
Keefe, Vlahov nearly matched his personal
scoring best in the first half as he tallied
14 points. Stanford jumped on top 37-26
and appeared to be on its way.
The Bruins mounted a strong charge in

the second stanza, but Vlahov and Co. were
ready. When the dust settled, Vlahov had a
game high 20 points and eight rebounds
He played the game's first 38 minutes before
fouling out and even added two assists for
good measure.
Over the last five games, Vlahov is averag
ing 14 points and eight rebounds per contest.
He also has 13 assists and seven steals.
Over the span, Vlahov is shooting .596
