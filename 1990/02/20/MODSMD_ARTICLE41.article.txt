# Card grapplers end 20-year jinx
## First victory over Cal-Poly in two decades ends home season 
### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team
did something Saturday night
that it has not done in over two
decades: beat Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. The Cardinal won six out
of 10 matches to score a 20-16
victory.
The match marked the last time
that four Stanford seniors would
ever compete on The Farm. So it
seemed appropriate that senior co
captain Ron Perry would win the
most important match of the eve
ning.
Perry went into his 190-pound
match against Aaron Cantrell
with Stanford leading 17-13. A vic
tory by Perry would guarantee a
team win for the Cardinal. "I
knew that if I won it would put
the dual meet on ice," said Perry.
Perry lead 1-0 most of the way
through the bout, until Cantrell
tied the score with an escape late
in the third period. Then with
seven seconds left in the match,

Perry scored a take down for a
4-1 win, bringing the home crowd
roaring to its feet.
"We both shot at the same time,
and we basically collided," Perry
said. "I was able to keep my wits
about me and do an arm spin
around him."
"I knew it was going to come
down to who was tougher at the
very end of the match," said Stan
ford Coach Chris Horpel. "I think
Ron was just a little tougher."
Another excellent outing was
turned in by senior Josh Lisle at
126 lbs. Because Stanford's Im
pounders were sick, he had to
open up the meet.
"I knew that we were starting
out with a six point deficit," said
Lisle. "Usually the first guy to
lead us off really has a big job.
That was kind of put on my
shoulders, and I didn't know if I
liked that or not."
The Mustangs' Joe Dansby cer
tainly did not like it, as Lisle com
pletely dominated the match,
13-0.

The other two Stanford seniors
wrestled well but lost. Geoff
Baum (150 lbs) lost a 9-3 decision
to Terry Watts, and heavyweight
Trent Smith was edged out by
Seth Woodill, 3-0.
How big was this win over Cal
Poly-SLO?
"It's great to win, especially for
Coach Horpel. It's the first time
he's ever beaten Cal Poly," Ron
Perry said.
Josh Lisle added, "It was a good
win for me, but it was a great
win for Coach."
"It's nice to come close to pro
grams like this," said Horpel. "To
actually beat them gives us a little
more credibility."
Will Horpel miss his graduating
seniors?
"That's one of the toughest
things about coaching for me," he
said. "We form pretty intense re
lationships because I see them go
through all kinds of things. They
will be truly missed, so I'm glad
that this final meet was so posi
tive for them."
