Still depleted, still undefeated.
The No. 1-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team took its star
studded act to Arizona over the
weekend and came away with two
easy victories. The Cardinal
bested both Arizona State and Ar
izona even though Sandra Birch
was not in the singles lineup
either day as she was still recover
ing from the flu.

1 Cardinal 5, Sun Devils 3
| Cardinal 7, Wildcats 2 .

Stanford is now 6-0 on the
season, 2-0 in Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division play. Ari
zona State suffered its first loss
of the season in the team's league
opener and is now 7-1, 0-1. Ari
zona is 3-2, 0-2.
Friday's match against the
eighth-ranked Sun Devils seemed
like it would be the tougher of

the two, but it ended up being an
easier win for the Cardinal.
With Birch out of the lineup,
all of Stanford's players moved up
a notch. Freshman Meredith
McGrath had no trouble in the
No. 1 singles position as she lost
just five games en route to a 6-2,
6-3 win over Krista Amend.
McGrath's performance was the
pacesetter as the Cardinal women
posted similar showings in the
next four singles matches down
the line. Debbie Graham
destroyed Laura Glitz 6-0, 6-1.
Teri Whitlinger dismantled Kristy
Jonkosky 6-0, 6-2. Lisa Green
decimated Jennifer Rojohn 6-3, 6-
0. And Heather Willens
dominated Barbara Thompson 6-
3, 6-1.
Kylie Johnson would normally
have appeared in the ratcheted
lineup but also battled the flu bug.
In her place, freshman Mario Car
ruth suffered her first dual-match
defeat at the hands of Karen Ber
gan 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 7-5.
With a 5-1 lead after singles,
the Cardinal had the match

clinched, rendering the doubles
moot. That allowed McGrath and
Whitlinger to skip their match at
No. 1. Birch attempted to join
Graham, her regular partner, at
No. 2 and the Cardinal tandem
won the first set 6-0.
Ironically, it was Graham's
physical problems that forced
them to default after they dropped
the second set 6-4. Graham had
a stiff shoulder, and Coach Frank
Brennan took a better-safe-than
sorry approach in having the pair
retire at that point.
Green and Willens, a new team
for Stanford, fell to Jonkosky and
Jill Hamilton in a tough three
setter, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.
The next day the No. 20 Wild
cats recorded a pair of singles wins
over Stanford freshmen to force
the Cardinal to doubles for the
first time this season. Danielle
Klurman gutted out a three-set
victory over Willens, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4
at No. 5. Like Carruth the day
before, losing a dual match was
a first for Willens.
For her own part, Carruth

battled Nancy Breen to a third
set at No. 6 before she fell 4-6,
6-4, 6-3.
But Stanford was not in much
trouble as its top four players all
recorded wins. McGrath won
handily in her match with Betsy
Somerville, 6-0, 7-6. Graham
overmatched Danielle Scott 6-1,
6-1. Green cruised past Jane Yates
6-3, 6-0. Whitlinger overcame a
slow start in her match with
Banni Redhair as she posted a
1-6, 6-2, 6-1 win.
Faced with a rare challenge to
the team's 41-match winning
streak, the Cardinal responded
with flying colors. In its first rel
evant doubles action of 1990, the
Cardinal recorded a sweep with
each of its teams winning in
straight sets.
McGrath and Whitlinger
showed why they are the nation's
top-ranked team in a 6-3, 6-3 tri
umph over Redhair and Some
rville. Both Birch-Graham and
Green-Willens teams rebounded
from defeats at Arizona State to
win handily.
