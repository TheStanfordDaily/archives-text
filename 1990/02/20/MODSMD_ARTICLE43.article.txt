# Injuries can't stop gymnasts
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
The third time around proved
to be no different from the first
two as the Stanford men's gym
nastics team disposed of San Jose
State Friday night by a score of
277.45 to 266.
The Cardinal looked impressive
in its third encounter with the
Spartans, accumulating a season
high all-around score despite
being plagued by injuries. In ad
dition to feeling the absence of
Tim Wang and Jair Lynch on
several events, Stanford lost soph
omore Tim Ryan when he injured
his back on his dismount from
the rings and did not compete in
the final two rounds of competi
tion.
"We were averaging over 46
points on each event until Ryan
had to be pulled out," Coach
Sadao Hamada said. "If he had
stayed in, I think we could have
gotten a 280, which is where we
should be right now to be com
petitive for NCAAs."

Despite this fact, Hamada is
confident that the team's last
three all-around scores are high
enough to guarantee the Cardinal
an invitation to the NCAA West
ern Regionals. "Right now our
scores are among the highest in
the division," he said.
Some outstanding individual
performances have compensated
for the injury setbacks. Freshman
Jeff Bender recorded personal
best scores on the floor, pommel
horse and parallel bars to end up
with an all-around score of 53.9.
"After a week of terrible work
outs, I had the best meet I've had
at Stanford," Bender said. "I was
shocked but ecstatic."
Senior Charles Loop took the
individual all-around honors with
a score of 56.8, the highest of the
season for the Cardinal. His 9.6
on the pommel horse and 9.45 on
rings were the meet's top marks
for those events.
Even some of the injured gym
nasts managed to contribute high
quality sets. Senior Conrad
Voorsanger, competing with

sprained knuckles, turned in a
near-perfect performance on the
high bar for the first 9.9 of the
season, and also took first place
on the vault and parallel bars.
"I was very happy that I was
able to come back and do well
because I didn't think I would be
completing in the all-arounds. A
couple of days ago, I couldn't even
do a handstand," Voorsanger said.
Lynch contributed a 9.55
routine for a first-place finish on
floor despite his wrist injury, and
Wang overcame his ankle injury
to take third place on the pommel
horse with a score of 9.35.
According to Loop, however,
these individual performances
need to be combined into a total
team effort as the Cardinal
prepares for its upcoming meeting
with California and defending
Pacific 10 Conference champion
UCLA.
"Friday's meet will be a good
way to gauge where we are in the
season," he said. "If we can stay
even with them, we'll be where
we want to be."
