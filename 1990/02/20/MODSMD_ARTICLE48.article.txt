# Webb of red tape snags USW
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers
tried to cut through government
bureaucracy in a protest Friday,
but wound up entangled in red
tape.
The USW brought Webb Ranch
workers, representatives of local
unions and students to the Cali
fornia labor commissioner's San
Mateo office to demand an inves
tigation by the labor board into
possible violations of state labor
regulations at Webb Ranch.
But after entering the labor
board office with picket signs in
hand, members of the group were
calmly asked to fill out the proper
complaint forms.
With a local Spanish television
station conducting interviews in
the background, USW field rep
resentative Rodney Barnette and
several ranch workers sat down
and completed the paperwork.
The USW originally filed a com
plaint to the state labor board in
December charging that Webb
Ranch had violated minimum
wage requirements, charged ex
cessive rent and failed to pay over
time compensation.
After receiving no reply to the
charges, USW attorney James Eg
gleston sent a letter directly to
the labor commissioner, James
Curry. The Jan. 25 letter re
quested an investigation into why
the original complaint had not
been processed.

The USW planned Friday's
protest to speed up the process
and demand an investigation after
Curry failed to respond to Eggles
ton's letter.
But Curry said an investigation
into the charges was already un
derway when the union protested
Friday, even though he did not
respond directly to the letter.
Curry said he had a meeting with
his regional director last Thurs
day to determine what had hap
pened to the original USW
complaint.
A state labor inspection was
scheduled at Webb Ranch last
Thursday, but the regional office
was unable to send anyone be
cause the investigator was ill.
Curry said an investigator would
be sent today to look into the
charges.
Curry agreed that "there are
undoubtedly violations" at Webb
Ranch. "We'll certainly look at
everything that is in our jurisdic
tion," he said.
The labor board is also launch
ing an investigation into the fail
ure to respond to the original
charges in December. "Somebody
didn't do what they were sup
posed to do," Curry said Friday.
He called the incident "a rare ex
ception."
But Eggleston blamed the fail
ure to respond on a "tone set by
[Gov. George] Deukmeijian"
which de-emphasizes labor issues.
"The violations of the law are
clear" at Webb Ranch, he said.
