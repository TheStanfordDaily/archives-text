# Parks recalls fight for freedom
## Civil rights movement founder shares her story with Stanford 
### Jenna Johnson 
Amid all the hurrahs and
hoopla, 77-year-old Rosa Parks sat
with her hands folded in her lap,
her hair neatly tucked into a bun,
patiently waiting for her chance
to give the audience her percep
tion of the freedom she risked her
life to gain.
Parks, known as a founding
mother of the modern civil rights
movement, spoke briefly at
Memorial Auditorium yesterday.
Parks and the capacity crowd
seemed to take delight in the pro
gram's energetic entertainment,
especially the tiny KS Rappers
from East Palo Alto, who danced
and sang to the beat of a freedom
rap.
Branner Hall Resident Fellow
Kennell Jackson introduced Parks
after praising the ability of the
"little people" of the world to
make history. "It's not often that
a historian gets to meet a living
part of history," he said.
Parks was one of these "little
people" until she made the deci
sion to keep her seat on the bus
in defiance of the segregation laws
in Montgomery, Ala. on Dec. 1,

1955. But to Parks, it was just
like any other day when she, along
with approximately 17,500 other
blacks, took the bus to and from
work.
In a press conference Sunday,
Parks shared her state of mind
when her otherwise ordinary day
turned extraordinary.
"I did not have any intention
of getting arrested," Parks admit
ted. "I had no idea I would not
get home. I'd be going to jail in
stead."
When a white passenger waited
for Parks to get up and she re
mained, the bus driver told her
she must move or he would have
her arrested.
Without hesitation, Parks said,
"1 agreed with him that that's
what he should do. I was willing
to face the consequences."
Little did Parks know that her
action and the consequences
would come to symbolize a move
ment that would shake the world.
Ironically, the program leading
up to Parks' speech was so packed
— with four masters of ceremo
nies, five speakers and six singing
performances — that the star at
traction barely had time to speak.

The program also started hedf an
hour late.
Once Parks finally got to the
podium, she stressed the contin
ued encouragement of young
people to excel and praised the
great potential of Stanford's pro
gram "in carrying out the quest
for freedom and equality the
world over."
Then, with regret, she informed
the audience that her flight was
leaving shortly and t hat she hoped
she could visit Stanford again.
In conclusion, she said, "I'm
glad that here or wherever we
are, we can spread the message
of love and fellowship, faith and
dedication for freedom. And as we
move into the '90s, we carry the
spirit of freedom and equality and
love."
"It's really a shame that she
hardly had the time to speak,"
said 1989 Stanford graduate
Carolyn Bell after the program,
"Its times like this when you
really see what an amazing op
portunity going to a school like
Stanford is."
The presentation was sponsored
by Arroyo House and the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, among others.
