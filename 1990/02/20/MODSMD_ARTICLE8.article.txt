# Stanford's Floricanto returns
## After 10 years of dormancy, the Chicano festival is revived 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
The poets and musicians came
from all across Aztl&n, the south
western heart of the Chicano
civilization.
One even came from lowa.
Stanford's Floricanto, a revival
of a poetry and music festival that
has lain dormant for 10 years,
attracted a diverse crowd of Chi
cano poetas y cantantes to Casa
Zapata's dining hall Saturday.
They brought with them a pot
pourri of ideas and emotions, as
well as a bilingual mixture of
stories and poems. The dining hall
was packed with color and
laughter, but the artistas also dis
played bitterness beneath many
of their smiles.

Sadness, poverty and hatred of
racism colored many of the works
at the Floricanto. One poet cried,
"They tell me assimilation is in
evitable."
Another sang of the plight of
Chicano farm workers: "I pick
it/The rich man, he eat it/And all
I got is the pits."
The artists had a wry social
sense as well. One cantante sang,
"They used to call us
greasers/Probably still do/But
they know there's a gold mine/In
tacos and enchiladas too."
Even amid the sadness, the
literature exuded optimism. "Life
beaten down is resurrected at eve
ning tide," one poet reassured the
crowd of about 100.
The Floricanto itself — the

word means literally "flower and
song" — has been resurrected
through the efforts of Zapata Res
ident Fellow Tony Burciaga and
coordinators Bel6n Rodriguez and
Ben Olguin. The first Floricanto,
held at USC in 1973 at the peak
of the Chicano movement, started
seven years of celebrations.
But 1980 saw the end of the
Floricanto. "The Reagan years
were upon us," Olguin said, ex
plaining the difficulty of getting
federal funding for the event.
Saturday's event, which ran
from 4 p.m. until 1:30 a.m., was
a triumphant return of the
Floricanto festival. The audience
was filled with veterans of the
first Floricanto as well as the tod
dlers of the new generation.
