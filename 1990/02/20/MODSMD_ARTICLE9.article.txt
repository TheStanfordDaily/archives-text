# Rios wins Watsonville election
## First Latino vice mayor claims victory over political racism 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Oscar Rios, the newly elected
vice mayor of Watsonville, said
he sees his victory as a step to
the "empowerment" of the La
tino voting electorate.
Rios, speaking on campus Sat
urday at a Northern California
MEChA meeting, said Chicanos
and Latinos will "show in his
tory that they will prevail" over
political racism.
Rios is the first Latino to win
office in Watsonville since a
court-mandated district elec
tions system was put into effect.
Rios said the old at-large elec
tion system discriminated

against equal representation for
the Latino-msyority population.
Rios, a native of El Salvador,
has lived in the United States
since he was 11 and has worked
since he was 15. In 1987 Rios
got a job with the non-profit
Cannery Workers Organizing
Project as an organizer for
union workers in Northern Cal
ifornia.
Rios said he went to Watson
ville to support the 18-month
cannery workers' strike and has
lived there since.
After the court decision man
dating district voting, Rios ran
against three other candidates
and won by a 2-to-l margin in
his district, which has 4,000

constituents. He said the new
district system is quite success
ful, even though he was the only
Latino elected of four who ran.
He said one Latino candidate
was too busy attacking him and
another "was thrown in by the
opposition to take votes away
from" him. "Just because you
are a color doesn't mean you're
going to win if you don't organ
ize your campaign," Rios said.
Rios said his district, which
is 80 percent Latino, also has
80 percent voter registration.
The significance of his "grass
roots" victory, he said, is par
ticipation. The number of votes
in his district tripled this year
over the past three years.
