Twofbrthe,
price of none
Now, you and a friend can
each enjoy California's most con
venient checking free of monthly
service charges* for a year.
Just come in and open any
new personal checking account,
then refer a friend who's new
to BofA. When your friend
opens an account, you'll each
get your checking free.
If you already have a BofA
checking account, you can still
check free. Just send us a new
customer, and we'll give you
each free personal checking for
a year. Plus all the convenience
of California's largest branch and
full-service ATM network.
Add it all up and you'll see
why now, more than ever, BofA
checking is checking worth
telling your friends about. For
more information, stop by any
Bank of America branch.
