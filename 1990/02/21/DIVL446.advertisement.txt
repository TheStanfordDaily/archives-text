HUMAN BIOLOGY: THE CHALLENGE FOR THE YEAR 2005"
The Program in Human Biology is holding an all-day symposium to celebrate
its 20th anniversary, pay tribute to its founders, and look to the future. The
symposium will highlight two interdisciplinary topics illustrative of issues Human
Biology must address.
The future is symbolized by the year 2005 - the target date for knowing the
human genetic code. The Human Genome Project raises issues and problems in
numerous areas ranging from funding of science to medical ethics.
The second topic will be tropical deforestation which presents complex,
interrelated issues including international economics, the rights of native peoples,
preservation of species diversity, and the greenhouse effect.
Guest speakers will include Dr. Donald Kennedy, President of Stanford
University; Dr. Joshua Lederberg, President of the Rockefeller University; and
Dr. William Durham, Associate Professor of Anthropology and Human Biology at
Stanford University. Panel discussants will include the founders, faculty, and
alumni of the Program in Human Biology.
