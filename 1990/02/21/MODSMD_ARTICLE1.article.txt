# Webb Ranch workers underpaid for University labor
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
For several years, Webb Ranch
paid its workers below the legal
minimum wage for work at the
University, The Daily has learned.
The University has publicly
denied having any involvement
with the Webb Ranch labor prac
tices that have come under the
attack of numerous government
agencies for legal violations. Webb
workers, however, are regularly
contracted to the University,
usually for work in the Athletics
Department.
Instead of paying ranch workers
directly, the University pays Webb
Ranch for the use of its workers.

Webb Ranch received about $8 per
hour for each worker leased to
the University, according to Uni
versity director of procurement
Jim Gallaher.
But Webb Ranch paid the
workers only $2.75 — and some
times less — for work at the Stan
ford Golf Course, according to
worker pay sheets dating from
1981 to 1985 obtained by The Dai
ly. Federal minimum wage has
been $3.35 per hour since 1981.
Webb family attorney Terrence
O'Connor could not be reached
for comment yesterday, but he has
previously denied any knowledge
of pay sheet irregularities con
cerning tax deductions.
Most ranch workers were ille

gaily living and working in the
United States when they were
employed at the University. These
workers were granted amnesty for
their illegal status under the 1986
Immigration Reform and Control
Act.
Manuel Chavez, a former Webb
Ranch laborer, worked at the golf
course for five years ending in
1987. Chavez said he was origi
nally paid $2.75 when he first
worked for Stanford, but this was
eventually raised to $3.35 per
hour.
In contrast, USW grounds
keepers in the Athletics Depart
ment are currently paid a starting
wage of $10.59, according to the
contract between the USW and
the University.
Webb Ranch worker pay sheets
show that workers were paid the
federal minimum wage of $3.35
in 1985 and years after, but deduc
tions of $.75 per hour for rent
and monthly utilities charges
were added to the pay sheets.
Such deductions without written
authorization from the workers
violate the California Labor Code.
So far, the University has re
mained resolute in its policy of
not interfering in the businesses
that lease land from Stanford.
"Stanford actually cannot de
termine the employment practices
of all those contractors and lessees
and then impose higher standards
than are required by law," Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
told the Stanford News Service
last April.
"It's a long-standing policy"
that applies to more properties
than just Webb Ranch, said Uni
versity public affairs officer
Steven Peeps. The Stanford Shop
ping Center and the Stanford Re
search Park are other examples
of where the University's nonin
terference policy applies.
Ranch workers were also
charged $30 per month by Webb
Ranch for University equipment
used on Stanford property, such
as gloves and fuel for
lawnmowers, Chavez said. Worker
paysheets show regular deduc
tions in this amount for gasoline.
According to Chavez, the Webb
Ranch manager would occasion

ally visit the golf course to super
vise the workers and note what
equipment they were using. He
would then charge the workers
for the use of the tools.
Chavez said that when he con
fronted golf course superintendent
Thomas Thatcher with the allega
tion that ranch workers were
being charged for University tools,
Thatcher laughed and called
Chavez a "dummy." He later
apologized, Chavez said.
Thatcher refused to comment
on whether he knew that ranch
workers were being charged for
University equipment.
Ranch workers were also asked
to do personal yard work at
Thatcher's house. Occasional
weekend work done by the ranch
workers was paid for by
Thatcher's wife. However, Chavez
said workers were also summoned
to Thatcher's house during regu
lar work hours, and this work was
charged to the University.
Ranch workers are also in
eligible for workers' benefits while
working at the University.
One Webb Ranch worker had
the tip of his finger cut off last
year while mowing a portion of
the football field for the Athletics
Department. Alejandro Soto sus
tained the injury when he appar
ently reached his hand
underneath the lawnmower he
was operating after it jammed,
according to supervisor Richard
Adolph.
Adolph immediately took Soto
to the Stanford Hospital, where
he was treated and released to
Webb Ranch. Soto was not entitled
to workers' compensation from
the University, because Stanford
is legally not the employer when

ranch laborers work at the Uni
versity.
Webb Ranch is not the only
agency that supplies labor to the
University. Other University de
partments often use labor from
Manpower Temporary Services
and Acme Building Maintenance,
two other such agencies.
The University has an agree
ment with the USW that outside
workers can be used under certain
circumstances.
The use of Webb Ranch workers
at the Stanford Golf Course has
decreased due to recent staff in
creases in the Athletics Depart
ment, according to associate
director Alan Cummings.
Ranch workers are still used at
the golf course for special projects,
such as the December construc
tion of a cement pad at the golf
course for earthquake protection,
Cummings said.
Ranch workers occasionally
were used in the Operations and
Maintenance Department, but
they have not been used for about
five years due to permanent staff
increases that reduced the need
for outside labor, according to
Herbert Fong, manager of
grounds and custodial services.
Webb Ranch workers were often
expected to perform duties "that
our own staff did not wish to do,"
Fong said. Pulling out weeds in
a wet ditch was one such duty,
he said.
Although controversy over the
treatment of Webb Ranch workers
was not a major consideration in
the decision to eliminate the use
of the ranch workers, Fong said
he would use agencies other than
Webb Ranch to provide labor in
the future in light of the political
sensitivity of Webb Ranch issues.


This handwritten monthly pay sheet from Webb Ranch shows that
Webb employees worked at Stanford for less than the legal minimum
wage. To the left is the gross wages of $403.00 which is a rate of
$2.60 per hour given 155 hours of work (tallied at bottom right).
Unspecified deductions of $24.70 and $4.03 are removed, most
likely for social security and unemployment taxes. Without prior
consent from the workers, the deductions are illegal. Other pay
sheets show $30 deductions for gasoline and tools used for busi
ness purposes.
