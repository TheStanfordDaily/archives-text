# Webb Ranch workers underpaid for University labor

paid its workers below the legal
minimum wage for work at the
University, The Daily has learned.
The University has publicly
denied having any involvement
with the Webb Ranch labor prac

attack of numerous government
agencies for legal violations. Webb
workers, however, are regularly
contracted to the University,
usually for work in the Athletics

worker pay sheets dating from

been $3.35 per hour since 1981.
Webb family attorney Terrence
O'Connor could not be reached
for comment yesterday, but he has
previously denied any knowledge
of pay sheet irregularities con
cerning tax deductions.

United States when they were
employed at the University. These
workers were granted amnesty for
their illegal status under the 1986
Immigration Reform and Control
Act.
Manuel Chavez, a former Webb
Ranch laborer, worked at the golf
course for five years ending in
1987. Chavez said he was origi
nally paid $2.75 when he first
worked for Stanford, but this was
eventually raised to $3.35 per
hour.
In contrast, USW grounds
