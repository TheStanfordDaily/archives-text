Drug session convened
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The General
Assembly convened its first special session on
narcotics yesterday as major drug-producing
nations and mcyor drug-consuming nations
sought to forge an international battle plan
for the 19905.
The four-day session is expected to shift the
previous emphasis on stopping drug produc
tion in poor countries to a more balanced
approach to also combating consumption in
wealthier nations. It is expected to consider
wider issues of distribution, marketing and
money laundering, the related arms trade and
sale of manufacturing chemicals.
Control on rallies urged
MOSCOW (AP) — The Soviet legislature
yesterday urged a crackdown on illegal dem
onstrations scheduled for Sunday and said au
thorities should exercise tight control on legal
rallies, the Tass news agency reported.
The legislators, saying they feared that ex
tremists and criminal elements will exploit the
demonstrations to destabilize the political sit
uation, adopted a resolution urging law en
forcement agencies to take special measures
to keep demonstrators in line.
The rallies were organized by various polit
ical groups in Moscow, Leningrad and other
cities "to express their attitude to
changes taking place in the country," Tass said.
The resolution, introduced in the Supreme
Soviet legislature by Deputy Nikolai Pivovarov,
said unsanctioned rallies should be curbed and
legal demonstrations should be held in specif
ically assigned places.
Nepal unrest mounts
BHAKTAPUR, Nepal (AP) — Lawyers
boycotted courts and demonstrators hurled
stones at police yesterday in mounting protests
against the government crackdown on a pro
democracy movement.
In Bhaktapur, seven miles east of the capital,
Katmandu, groups of young men threw stones
and shouted insults at policemen.
In the two-story red brick houses along the
alleys, women and children huddled behind
half-open windows. Policemen took shelter be
hind the pillars of the 17th century temples
that dot the town.
The protests began Sunday, the first day of
a campaign to demand an end to the 29-year
old ban on political parties. According to the
government, police have arrested 175 people
nationwide since then, but opposition sources
put the number at more than 400 in Katmandu
alone.
The government said three people were
killed and 16 were ir\jured Monday in Bhak
tapur when police fired on demonstrators. Wit
nesses said five people were killed.
Four die escaping
ISLAMORADA, Fla. (AP) — Four Cubans
died while trying to escape their homeland on
rafts, the Coast Guard said yesterday.
Two men died at sea and their bodies were
thrown overboard by companions, Coast Guard
officials said. A third disappeared overnight
and a teen-age boy was dead by the time he
reached a Florida Keys hospital.
Five people aboard the same rafts survived
the voyage.
The survivors were being interviewed by
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
officers. Cubans who arrive by sea are usually
freed after immigration processing.
The survivors brought to 67 the number of
Cubans who have successfully made the voyage
since Jan. 1. The deaths were the first known
fatalities this year.
Newly arriving Cubans say the island's eco
nomy and repression are worsening and that
many more Cubans would leave if they could
do so safely. Some 125,000 Cubans came to
the United States in 1980 when the Cuban
government temporarily opened the Port of
Mariel.
Guerrillas free hostage
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Guerrillas blew
up power lines and attacked police posts in
Cartagena while police seized 10 shoulder-fired
missiles from drug traffickers four days after
President Bush's visit, authorities said.
Also late Monday, leftist guerrillas freed an
American priest who was kidnapped Thursday
to protest Bush's visit to the the Caribbean
port city that day for an anti-drug summit
with three Andean presidents.
Francis Amico Ferrari, 43, of Rochester, N.Y.
said he was released unharmed in Cali.
Border fire exchanged
MUZZAFFARABUD, Pakistan (AP) -
Pakistani and Indian troops exchanged fire
for several hours yesterday after a Pakistani
soldier became the first military casualty on
the troubled Kashmir border, officers and a
western observer said.
The soldier was shot in the leg Sunday at
a ceasefire line, several miles from the village
of Chaukothi, officials said on condition of
anonymity
They said there were no reports of casualties
from yesterday's firefight at the line, which
divides Kashmir between Pakistan and India.
The nations have twice gone to war over
the Himalayan stat«, in 1948 and again in
1965. The former princely state was divided
between the two nations after British colonial
rule ended in 1947.
According to observers on the Pakistani side,
for the first time Indian soldiers appear to be
aiming specifically at the soldiers.
Pakistani soldiers reportedly are asking to
be allowed to fight the Indians.
