DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) - Britain
yesterday failed to persuade the Eu
ropean Community to ease sanctions
against South Africa and announced
that it would unilaterally lift an em
bargo on new investment.
"There was no consensus on a lifting
of sanctions," an Irish government
spokesman, requesting anonymity,
said at the end of a one-day meeting
of community foreign ministers.
British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd announced immediately after
ward that Britain would unilaterally
lift the embargo on new investment.
He said that Britain had tried to
avoid going it alone by offering to delay
lifting the embargo if all 12 community
nations pledged to lift it jointly when
the South African government ends
its state of emergency. But he said the
others refused to agree to this com
promise.
"I would greatly have preferred to
have reached an agreement," Hurd
said.
The Irish spokesman said the com
munity would consider the issue again
when the South African government
lifts its state of emergency and frees
all political prisoners.
The community decided to send a
three-member delegation from France,
Ireland and Italy — the past, present
and future presidents of the commu
nity — to South Africa.
Britain and Portugal argued
strongly for sanctions to be eased now
to encourage the white-run govern
ment to enact further reforms, officials
reported.
British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, the West's most outspoken
opponent of sanctions against South

Africa, wants to lift gradually the com
munity's relatively mild embargoes.
She argues that unless South Africa
President F.W. de Klerk can show
some positive international response
to his legalizing of the African Na
tional Congress and Nelson Mandela's
release, he could be toppled in a white
backlash.
The non-binding embargoes that
Mrs. Thatcher wants the community
to lift in stages, but quickly, are the
ban on the promotion of tourism, new
government loans to South African
agencies and state funding of trade
missions to South Africa.
Earlier, West Germany promised the
European Community that a united
Germany will be a stabilizing force in
Europe and will scrupulously honor
existing borders.
"Germany will make an important
contribution to the stability in Europe
because she will make it absolutely
clear what will be united, namely, the
two existing German states and Berlin,
which means a guarantee for the east
ern frontiers," said West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher.
Officials from Ireland, current pres
ident of the community, said Genscher
also stressed that West Germany won't
move on German unification "behind
the backs" of its European Community
partners or of the four World War II
Allies.
The German unification debate fol
lowed a decision last week to set up
a forum of the Allied powers-the
United States, the Soviet Union, Eng
land and France-and the two Ger
manies to agree on the external impact
of German unification.
