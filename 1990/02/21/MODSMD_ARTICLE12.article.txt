# German Unification: report from West Berlin
## 
### Matt Eldridge Special to The Stanford Daily 
"Die Einheit wird kommen, wenn
die Deutschen es wollen." (Unification
will come when the German people
want it.) — West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, November 1989.
WEST BERLIN — Every major
thoroughfare in this city sports at least
one billboard heralding these words of
Chancellor Kohl.
And, indeed, the truth of his state
ment is becoming more apparent with
every passing day. The sense of mo
mentum toward German reunification
— or, as the Germans insist upon call
ing it, "unification" — has reached a
breathtaking level of intensity in Ber
lin.
But is German reunification coming
quickly enough? Many say yes. Great
Britian and Poland continue to express
serious reservations about the pace of
events: Britain, because Margaret
Thatcher is Margaret Thatcher; and
Poland, because the Poles fear for the

News analysis

permanence of their western border
with East Germany.
Strategic planners face the enor
mous task of redefining the role that
a reunited Germany will play in an
entirely new European security
framework. Should a reunited Ger
many have membership in NATO,
both NATO and the Warsaw Pact or
neither? Should a reunited Germany
de-militarize?
A consensus over these issues be
tween the East German Social Demo
cratic Party, the likely victors in the
upcoming March 18 elections, and the
Bonn government appears a long way
off. And the situation becomes more
complex when one introduces the even
more dissimilar positions of the Soviet
Union and the United States.
However, many Germans feel that
reunification must take place more
rapidly. Between 1,000 and 2,000 East
Germans leave for the West every day.

Especially since the GDR virtually
eliminated its border restrictions a few
months ago, these people have seen
the material goods and political
freedoms that many in the West enjoy.
Although East Berlin has evolved
into less of the drab, dismal city it
once was, it still presents a striking
contrast to the other side of the Wall.
Many who emigrate are young and
lack the same emotional attachment
to their East German home that tends
to restrain older citizens. They see
their whole lives in front of them and
know that it will take years before
living conditions in the East reach
parity with those of the Federal Re
public.
In conjunction with the high level
of emigration, other factors represent
a widespread, growing pressxire on the
East German government to reunify.
One of these is the escalating crisis
in health care services.
The promise of a ten-fold increase
in salary and favored hiring of East
Germans has lured many many phy
sicians to the West.

Those health care professionals who
stay behind must carry the burden
caused by this skyrocketing rate of
attrition. One doctor tells the story of
working in the children's wing of an
East German hospital. Before the Wall
opened, she worked alongside four
other physicians. Now, she alone re
mains, wondering how much longer
she can endure the extra hours and
sleepless nights.
Why does she stay? She worries
about the children. If she leaves, no
one will be left to care for them.
The debate over the best solution
to The German Question has only just
begun. But even as the parties involved
prepare their arguments, the clock has
started.
As thousands continue to flee the
GDR, and as the health crisis contin
ues to worsen, one thing is certain:
the impatience of East Germans for
reunification will continue to increase.
The effect this factor will have on the
outcome of reunification talks remain
to be seen, but few doubt that the
impact will be significant.
