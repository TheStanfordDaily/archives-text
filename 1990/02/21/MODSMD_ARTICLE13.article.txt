# Arab group accuses Israel of violation of rights
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — A Palestinian
human rights group charged yesterday
that Israeli soldiers were carrying out
"deliberate, cold-blooded" killings of
Palestinian suspects instead of arrest
ing them.
Officials of A 1 Haq-Law in the Serv
ice of Man told a news conference that
its researchers documented three such
cases and were investigating 15 pos
sible other such killings in the past
year in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
An Israeli military spokesman
denied Israel had any policy of
deliberate killings, and the army
issued a five-sentence statement saying
it "categorically rejects the baseless
and unfounded accusations detailed"
in the 692-page report.
The report cited several changes in
Israeli policy in the past year that

have been acknowledged by the gov
ernment, but which A 1 Haq and other
human rights organizations see as vi
olations of international law.
Among these were:
— Increasing the initial time a
suspect in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip can be held without charges
or trial under "administrative deten
tion" from six months to one year.
— Allowing soldiers to open fire at
masked Palestinian suspects, even if
they are unarmed, when the suspects
ignore orders to halt. The army has
said soldiers first must fire warning
shots in the air and then shoot at the
suspect's legs. A 1 Haq noted that 17
of the 31 Palestinians killed by soldiers
in October wexe masked men.
— Sealing houses of people sus
pected of throwing stones. Previously,
sealings and demolition of houses were

used for those suspected of firebomb
ings or other, more serious attacks.
The U.S. State Department and Am
nesty International have complained
about administrative detentions and
house demolitions as violations of in
ternational law.
Fatah Azzarn, administrative direc
tor of A 1 Haq, said not enough inter
national pressure had been put on Is
rael, and the report itself complained
of unwillingness by Israeli authorities
to respond to criticism.
"While the use of illegal measures
to suppress the uprising has been in
tensified, attention has been deflected
. . . through the periodic issuance of
new regulations and policy statements
intended to reassure the international
community," it said.
As to the charges of deliberate kil
lings, AI Haq said all three of the

victims were shot at close range, and
that in two cases they were denied
needed medical attention.
Nidal Al-Habash, 21, was shot as he
raised his hands to surrender after
being surrounded following a chase by
soldiers in the West Bank city of
Nablus on Oct. 9, A 1 Haq said.
Atwa Harzallah, 27, was stopped
with four other Palestinians on Feb.
27, 1989, in the West Bank village of
Deir Ibzi and, while all five raised
their hands, soldiers shot Harzallah
twice in the head, the report said. It
said two of those with Harzallah were
later arrested.
A 1 Haq, which is affiliated with the
International Commission of Jurists
in Geneva, Switzerland, listed 379 kil
lings of Palestinians by soldiers, Israeli
settlers and collaborators with Israel
during the year.
