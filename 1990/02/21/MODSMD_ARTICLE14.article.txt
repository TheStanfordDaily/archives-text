Ruling to stand
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday refused to
block a state court libel lawsuit
against the NAACP by a Virginia
Beach, Va., white policeman who fa
tally shot a 22-year-old black man.
The justices, without comment, let
stand a ruling that the suit against
the National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People and one
of its officials must be tried in state,
rather than federal, court.
Eddie Upchurch shot and killed
Fred T. Gilchrist on June 20, 1987.
Upchurch said he fired unintention
ally when Gilchrist tried to grab his
gun.
Aaron Wheeler of the local NAACP
branch was quoted in the Virginia
Pilot as calling the shooting a murder.
"This is a senseless murder and
something has to be done about it,"
the newspaper quoted Wheeler as
saying.
In his libel suit, Upchurch said that
Wheeler's remarks were false and

that the civil rights official knew they
were false or spoke them with reck
less disregard for the truth.
Jail for silence
WASHINGTON (AP) - Parents
suspected of child abuse may be jailed
indefinitely for refusing to disclose
the whereabouts of their children,
the Supreme Court ruled yesterday.
The court said society's need to
protect children from harm generally
outweighs a parent's constitutional
right against self-incrimination.
Baltimore to divest
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday let stand Bal
timore, Md., ordinances requiring the
city's public employee pension plans
to withdraw all investments in com
panies doing business with South
Africa.
The justices, over one dissenting
vote, rejected a challenge that said

the divestment ordinances, among
other things, impermissibly intrude
on the federal government's power
to conduct foreign relations.
Justice Byron R. White voted to
hear arguments in the case, but four
votes are needed to grant such
review.
Conviction will stand
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday refused to
hear an appeal by a man convicted"
in the so-called pizza connection case
in which prosecutors said tons of im
ported heroin and cocaine were dis
tributed through a network of pizza
parlors
The court, without comment, let
stand the conviction and 30-year
prison sentence of Filippo Casamento,
who said he was only a peripheral
figure in the drug ring.
Federal prosecutors said the drug
ring brought narcotics valued at $1.6
billion into the country from Turkey,
Sicily and Brazil.

Securities rejected
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday refused to bar
national banks from selling
mortgages in the form of "pass
through certificates" â€” a practice
the securities industry says violates
federal banking law
The court, without comment, let
stand a ruling that such sales are
legal.
Federal law allows national banks
to sell the conventional real estate
mortgages they hold, but generally
prohibits banks from underwriting,
buying and selling securities.
Banks traditionally have sold
longterm mortgages for other reve
nue sources, and an increasingly
popular means of selling mortages is
the use of pass-through certificates,
which are securities.
The buyer of such certificates ob
tains an interest in a pool of the
bank's conventional mortgages rather
than in a single mortgage
