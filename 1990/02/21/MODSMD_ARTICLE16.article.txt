## Democracy at work 
### 
Alcohol policy debate
is success for ASSU,
students and University

THE NEW ASSU dorm poll
ing technique has just com
pleted its trial run, and it
seems to be a success.
ASSU dorm representatives
polled their dormmates on the new
University alcohol policy proposed
by Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger and Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington.
The responses were then consid
ered by the ASSU Alcohol Policy
Task Force in making its recom
mendations to the University —
democracy in action.
The ASSU has been criticized in
the past for not representing stu
dent opinion, but with the new
process, it provided a clear path
for student discussion and re
sponse.
The University also responded,
listening to student opinions and
reservations and integrating them
into decisions. It is encouraging to
see University administrators
seriously considering student opin
ion on an issue that directly affects
the students.
Equally encouraging is the speed
of the process. The proposal was
made public Jan. 11, and in less
than a month, the ASSU estab
lished a task force and conducted
a campus-wide poll to gauge stu
dent opinion.
The University response was
even quicker. Within a week of re
ceiving the ASSU's recommenda
tions, Lyons announced that he
had decided to drop his proposal
for banning alcohol purchases with
University-collected dorm funds —
the main point students opposed.
Yet, while the ASSU based three

of its four recommendations on the
results of its student poll, the
fourth suggestion, supporting a
ban on the promotion and adver
tising of alcohol at Athletics De
partment events, opposed the
majority student response.
The ASSU claimed that, after
the dorm poll, it discovered that
the main student concern about
this issue — decreased revenues
for the Athletics Department —
was not valid. But why didn't the
pollsters know this and explain it
to students before the poll was
taken? And what about the other
concerns, including value judg
ments and free speech issues, that
revolve around this point?
The ASSU went on to dismiss
the proposed advertising ban as
"not a student issue, but an issue
for the Department of Athletics."
If task force members don't think
the issue concerns students, why
did they bring it up in the first
place? Seeking student opinion on
an issue and then disregarding it
as "not a student issue" is a slap
in the face to the whole purported
democratic system of student poll
ing.
Nevertheless, the system was an
overall success.
The immediate and emotional
response to the original proposals
illustrated the potential volume of
the Stanford student voice when
students feel strongly about an
issue — and have access to an
avenue for voicing their opinions.
The University's rapid and positive
response proves the potential
power of that voice in shaping Uni
versity decisions and policies.
Now that we've seen that it can
work, the ASSU and the student
body should not let the process die.
Students should use the power and
influence accorded them by ASSU
polls and the University to help
determine the course of more far
reaching and consequential debates
than the University alcohol policy.
