Speaker used harmful racial stereotypes for humor

ON FEB. 19, I heard Ray Brad
bury talk at Kresge. After the
talk, most audience members
stood up in appreciation of his speech.
I gave a massive boo. I am writing to
you to explain why I did this, as
several persons in the audience must
have expressed surprise at my excep
tional reaction.
I did not only do it because I am
'black,' 'African American,' a member
of a minority group or whatever one
classifies me as. I did it because Brad
bury's sentiments hearken back to an
era in which little black Sandia Soda
girls with ebony complexions and huge
red lips evinced a common stereotype.
I admit that Bradbury spoke with
great humor, but very naively, of a
baseball with the notion of massive red

split lips.
If this confuses anyone, it certainly
confused me. In fact, I was also out
raged. Anyone else in the audience
must have at least fleetingly experi
enced a moment of discomfort. Multi
ply this fleeting sensation a thousand
times and, there you have it, yes, you
know just how I felt. I listened to
what, until that point, had been a

"these are my notions of futuristic
cities and lunches with Walt Disney,
but please treat it as just another
evening of light-hearted gaiety, you
nice kids" type of speech.
After the stab at racial humor, a
light mist formed over my eyes, I had
trouble breathing and I could not focus
on the rest of what he said. Finally, in

deference to my feelings, I felt obliged
to shout my disappoval. I felt such a
response to be justly proportionate to
and as legitiamate as the standing
encore I witnessed.
I have no beef with Bradbury as an
individual. I do object, however, to the
naive, sentimental, quasi-nostalgic and
even paternalistic stereotypes a man as
apparently worldly as he tended to
represent. Louis Armstrong was a
great musician and a divine spirit.
Isn't that enough, Bradbury? Isn't
mentioning his thick split red lips a
feeble attempt at humor? If it isn't,
then I guess I haven't yet caught up to
you and your 'futuristic' ideas about
good taste.
