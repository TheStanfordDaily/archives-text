# Adequate, efficient lighting is possible
## 
### 
The Daily has recently printed two
letters offering opposing views on
whether Stanford needs more outdoor
lighting. Since neither letter did justice
to the complexity of this issue, I think
a third letter is needed.
Outdoor lighting should be designed
with at least four factors in mind.
They are, in order of decreasing impor
tance: personal safety, energy conserva
tion, aesthetics and astronomical re
search. These needs are not mutually
incompatible. By following four simple
guidelines, it is easy to satisfy them
all.
First, aim the light where it's
needed: down. Many light fixtures
waste energy by directing light up
wards, where it only blocks out the
stars, or sideways, where it casts long
shadows and effectively blinds the

people it intends to protect.
Second, use the most efficient types
of lighting elements available. Incan
descent bulbs consume far more energy
than fluorescent, mercury or sodium
elements. Professional astronomers
prefer low-pressure sodium light, which
is very efficient and can be blocked by
filters for many types of research.
Third, turn off lights when they're
not needed. Purely ornamental lights
serve no purpose at 2 a.m.
Fourth, don't use more light than
necessary. The human eye can adapt to
amazingly low levels of light, if given
the chance. Areas that are over
illuminated spoil dark-adaptation and
make surrounding, moderately-lit areas
seem dark in comparison. The best
alternative is a uniform, moderate level
of outdoor lighting.
I live in Stanford's newest residence,
the Rains Houses. The outdoor lighting
here was obviously designed in re
sponse to requests from students
worried about safety, and I don't think

enough.
But I can easily argue that there is
too much. The lights in the courtyard
regularly come on within minutes after
sunset, half an hour before their il
lumination is noticeable. At night they
cast enough light for reading inside my
third-floor apartment. The stairways
and landings are brighter than the
living rooms. In the commons area
there are a dozen ornamental lights
aimed directly at the ceilings of the
arcades. All of these lights use energy
efficient elements, but that is the only
respect in which they are not wasteful.
There is no doubt that there are
many areas of campus that are inade
quately lit. There are many more that
would be safer if lights were modified
to direct the light down instead of into
people's eyes. Those who are concerned
with safety should compile a detailed
list of the improvements that are
needed rather than issuing a general
demand for more lighting.
