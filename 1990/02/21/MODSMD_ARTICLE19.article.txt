How college students lack temporal
perspective! Jon Sherman, in the Feb.
16 Daily, says he has "heard that Rice
University in Texas is trying hard to
become what Stanford once was."
Thirty years ago, Stanford was
trying hard to become what Rice was
— the preeminent intellectual center of
its region, famed fur both its scholar
ship independent of the tradition
strangled East Coast and for the out
standingly high abilities of its students.
With lots of money and a good deal of
energy, Stanford succeeded. Unfortu
nately, Rice hit hard economic times
like the rest of Texas and is now
trying to regain what it once was, not
what Stanford was. We'd be happy for
Stanford to aim for the same troal,
though.
