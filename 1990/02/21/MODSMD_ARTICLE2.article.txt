# Ranch lease now on a month-to-month basis
## 
### Michael Friedly Senior staff writer 
Webb Ranch's four-year lease
with Stanford expired last Au
gust, and the University has no
legal obligations to retain the
Webb family as lessees, according
to a copy of the lease obtained by
The Daily.
University public affairs officer
Steven Peeps said he could not
speculate on whether the Univer
sity would cancel the lease, which
is now being extended on a month
to-month basis. However, he said
he would be very surprised if the
University changes its policy for

bidding it from interfering at
Webb Ranch.
University director of real es
tate and lands management Zera
Murphy, who is in charge of the
lease, refused to comment on the
state of the lease because of con
fidentiality.
A "holding over" clause of the
expired lease mandates that Webb
Ranch pay 120 percent of the nor
ma] rent for the land for each
monthly extension of the lease.
The lease covers 238 acres of
University land off Alpine Road
near Interstate 280, farmed by
the Webbs since the 19205. Rent,
under the expired lease, was

$46,416 a year for 1989.
Peeps said it is "not uncom
mon" that a lease is extended after
the date of expiration. He said a
holdover on a lease is usually the
result of one party wanting to
renegotiate the terms of the lease.
Peeps also said the current dis
pute between Webb Ranch man
agement and the workers may
have caused the holdover. "It just
wouldn't seem right to renegotiate
[the lease] while collective bar
gaining is under way," he said.
One of the specifications of the
lease is that Webb Ranch must
obey all government regulations.
Section 15 of the lease states that
Webb Ranch shall comply with all
"regulations pertaining to the
leased premises, the improve
ments thereon and any activity or
condition on or in the premises."
Webb Ranch first violated sec
tion 15 of the lease last spring
when it was cited by the San
Mateo County Environmental
Health Department for 75 viola
tions of government regulations
in worker housing.
University lands manager
Paula Kakimoto, who was in

charge of University farm leases
last year, said that Webb Ranch
had corrected the problems.
Since last spring, Webb Ranch
has accumulated violations from
the Department of Labor, the
Federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration and the
California OSHA. In addition, the
Internal Revenue Service may be
investigating possible Webb
Ranch violations of federal income
tax laws.
The United Stanford Workers
is currently seeking investigations
from the California Labor Com
missioner and the state Depart
ment of Fair Housing and
Employment.
Several of the ranch workers
said the lack of a new lease may

because Stanford let

indicate that Stanford may evict
the Webb family because of the
controversy. "Our hope is growing
because Stanford let the lease run
out," said ranch worker Augustin
Gonzales
Ranch workers even expressed
a willingness to leave if the Uni
versity cancels the lease. "It's al
right if we have to leave, just as
long as [Webb Ranch owner Stan
ley Webb] has to go too," said
Manuel Chavez, a former Webb

Ranch worker who still lives at
the ranch with his parents.
The University is given a broad
range of powers under the lease.
One section allows the University
to withdraw a portion or all of
its land at any time for its own
purposes with 60 days notice.
The lease also declares the Uni
versity to be the owner of all
buildings at Webb Ranch. This
includes the housing facilities that
have been cited for violations by
at least four different county, state
and federal agencies.
But the lease specifies that the
University is not responsible for
the upkeep of the buildings. Stan
ford "shall have no duties or re
sponsibilities with regard to

making any repairs to insure (sic)
any improvements or buildings
are fit for human occupancy," it
states.
In addition, the lease forbids
the Webbs from selling or trans
ferring the land. Stanford "desires
to continue its relationship with
Lessee and enter into this Lease
solely because of its relationship
and reliance on the Webb family,"
the lease states.

have caused the holdover. "It just
wouldn't seem right to renegotiate
[the lease] while collective bar
gaining is under way," he said.
One of the specifications of the
lease is that Webb Ranch must
obey all government regulations.
Section 15 of the lease states that
Webb Ranch shall comply with all
"regulations pertaining to the
leased premises, the improve
ments thereon and any activity or
condition on or in the premises."
Webb Ranch first violated sec
tion 15 of the lease last spring
when it was cited by the San
Mateo County Environmental
Health Department for 75 viola
tions of government regulations
in worker housing.
University lands manager
Paula Kakimoto, who was in

charge of University farm leases
last year, said that Webb Ranch
had corrected the problems.
Since last spring, Webb Ranch
has accumulated violations from
the Department of Labor, the
Federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration and the
California OSHA. In addition, the
Internal Revenue Service may be
investigating possible Webb
Ranch violations of federal income
tax laws.
The United Stanford Workers
is currently seeking investigations
from the California Labor Com
missioner and the state Depart
ment of Fair Housing and
Employment.
Several of the ranch workers
said the lack of a new lease may

indicate that Stanford may evict
the Webb family because of the
controversy. "Our hope is growing
because Stanford let the lease run
out," said ranch worker Augustin
Gonzales
Ranch workers even expressed
a willingness to leave if the Uni
versity cancels the lease. "It's al
right if we have to leave, just as
long as [Webb Ranch owner Stan
ley Webb] has to go too," said
Manuel Chavez, a former Webb

Ranch worker who still lives at
the ranch with his parents.
The University is given a broad
range of powers under the lease.
One section allows the University
to withdraw a portion or all of
its land at any time for its own
purposes with 60 days notice.
The lease also declares the Uni
versity to be the owner of all
buildings at Webb Ranch. This
includes the housing facilities that
have been cited for violations by
at least four different county, state
and federal agencies.
But the lease specifies that the
University is not responsible for
the upkeep of the buildings. Stan
ford "shall have no duties or re
sponsibilities with regard to

making any repairs to insure (sic)
any improvements or buildings
are fit for human occupancy," it
states.
In addition, the lease forbids
the Webbs from selling or trans
ferring the land. Stanford "desires
to continue its relationship with
Lessee and enter into this Lease
solely because of its relationship
and reliance on the Webb family,"
the lease states.
