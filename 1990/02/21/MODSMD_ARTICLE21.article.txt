## A
						history ignored by most 
### 
DEAR ROSA Parks,
As you know, this is Black His
tory Month. This is the month
during which we get to eat, drink and
sleep black. Twenty-eight days of fried
chicken, cornbread, black-eyed peas, bid
whisk and Marvin Gaye. February is
ours, ours, ours!
Mrs. Parks, although this is Black His
tory Month, I'm afraid our children aren't
learning their history, and if we don't
know our history, we don't know our
selves. But it's no wonder black people
don't know their history — they don't
teach us much of our history in school.
We have to learn it on our own, or from
our parents, and a lot of them don't know
it.
But I think everbody knows you, Mrs.
Parks. You're one of the few black people
about which they taught in school, along
with Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman,.
Crispus Attucks, Frederick Douglass and
Martin Luther King Jr. They didn't teach
us about Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey or
Fanney Lou Hamer. I had to wait until
later to learn about them. But that's OK,
because I was happy to learn about any
black people, even if it was only four or
five.
I remember the first time I read about
you. I was in the third grade and it was
Black History Month. Our teacher put
your picture up on a bulletin board. There
you were, Rosa Parks, posted next to
Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman,
Crispus Attucks, Frederick Douglass and
Martin Luther King Jr. Under your pic
ture it said that you had sparked the
civil rights movement by refusing to give

up your seat to a white man. You said
"No" to a white man, and lived!
I had a smile on my face the whole
day. All I could think about was that
Rosa Parks had stood up to a white man.
I ran home that day and told my
momma that Rosa Parks had stood up
to a white man. She said she knew, and
that it was because of you that I could
go to a good school. She said that I had
to make something of myself so that I
wouldn't let your hard work go to waste.
Momma said you were a strong woman,
and that the world needed more strong
black women like you. "Corey," she used
to say, "marry you a strong woman, and
you won't go wrong."
Mrs. Parks, there were lots of strong
black women during the civil rights move
ment, but they don't get the recognition
they deserve. It seems as if the men have
gotten most of the credit. Momma always
said, behind every strong man is a strong
woman. I think that in our next civil
rights movement black women will be
the leaders. It seems as though they've
lost more rights than anybody else in
this country, and when they get truly fed
up, this country is gonna catch hell!
Mrs. Parks, were you there when Dr.
King made his "I Have A Dream" speech?
I'm sure you were. That's my favorite
speech. It brings chills to my spine every
time I hear it. Can you believe that we
still have people who think Dr. King was
against affirmative action? I guess that
goes to show you how much they teach
us in school.
Mrs. Parks, did you achieve all your
dreams? I must say these last eight years

It's no wonder black
people don't know their
history — they don't teach
us much of our history in
school.

under Reagan have been a nightmare for
black people. He practically destroyed
everything you and Dr. King worked so
hard for. Destroyed it, just like that! And
I don't see it getting any better under
President Bush. But it ain't just the white
man's fault we're losing our rights. Black
people have gotten too comfortable. Too
many of us have found freedom in BMWs,
beach-front condominiums and Wall
Street.
I have a dream, Mrs. Parks. I dream
that every day will be Black History
Month — that we won't have to wait
until February to learn who we are. But
it's going to take a thousand Rosa Parks
to achieve that dream. Until then, I want
to thank you, Mrs. Parks, for your ded
ication and love for black people.
Sincerely,
Corey L. Davis
