## Animals donate blood, too 
### Megan Beardsley Staff writer 
Q. A friend of mine says her
• dog had such terrible
neas that the vet had to give
it a transfusion. My question
is: do dogs have blood types
that have to be matched like
humans do? Are there doggy
blood banks?
A. I can imagine a dog blood
• drive with T-shirts and
dog tags reading "Scratch my
belly, I gave blood today." But
actually there are blood banks
for both dogs and cats, says
veterinarian Stan Carlin, who
runs the Animal Blood Bank
in Vacaville, Calif.
Carlin breeds the animals
and tests them for diseases and
blood type. Dog blood comes in
seven or eight different types,
depending on how they are
counted, he says.
The dogs donate blood as of
ten as twice a month, though
they don't have a whole lot of
choice in the matter. After a
few years, they "retire" and are
adopted as pets, Carlin says.
Meanwhile, the blood bank
sends the blood and blood prod
ucts to veterinarians all over
the U.S. to treat dogs that have
lost blood either in accidents
or to fleas and other parasites.
Before Carlin opened the
bank two years ago, most vets
treated these dogs with blood
from their own pets or from
dogs in shelters, often just
before the dogs were put to
sleep, Carlin says.
Many dogs survive transfu
sions of blood of the wrong
type, Carlin says, but if these
dogs receive a second transfu
sion, they almost always die.
Q. I swear I heard some
• where that there is
enough nicotine in a cigarette
to kill you if you eat two or
three, but my roommate
doesn't believe me. What's the
scoop?
A. I couldn't find the exact
• answer to your question.

The woman I talked to at
the Poison Control Center at
Santa Clara Medical Center
said she's not allowed to give
out detailed descriptions of
suicide methods and, therefore,
couldn't tell me exactly how
many cigarettes it takes to kill
the average college student.
I tried to explain that the
information was for a question
and answer column, but that
didn't convince her.
However, the woman, who
asked not to be named, did
make it clear that cigarettes
are no one's idea of health food.
Eating a whole cigarette or
more than three cigarette butts
would be a problem for a small
child, she said. Swallowing nic
otine chewing gum is bad, too.
The symptoms of nicotine
poisoning appear quickly. First
you become nauseated, then
you vomit, and then, if there's
still nicotine in your system,
you may have pains in your
abdomen or even seizures.
"Usually people throw up
before they experience the
really bad effects," she said.
