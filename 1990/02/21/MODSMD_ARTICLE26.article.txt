# Surgeon reuses heart to save another life
## 
### Ann Chan 
Scientists have now joined the
recycling movement. When they
transplant a new heart and lungs
into a patient, they can use the
old heart in a different patient.
When patients with advanced
lung disease, such as emphysema,
require lung transplantation they
usually receive a lung and a heart
from the same donor. When lung
transplantation is done without a
matching heart, the patient's trac
hea often does not heal properly,
blocking the air passages to the
lungs.
However, in many such
patients, the heart which is
removed along with the diseased
lungs is actually healthy and
strong. In fact, the hearts are ex
ceptionally muscular because they
have been pumping blood through
vessels narrowed by disease.
As an alternative to just throw
ing away the heart, in a procedure
called a domino-donor transplant,
surgeons can put the heart into
another patient with a diseased
heart.
The domino-donor heart proce
dure was introduced to the United
States in May 1987, and six op
erations had been performed in
the U.S. by last June. Three of
these operations took place at
Stanford.
Dr. Vaughn Starnes is head of
the heart-lung transplant team at
Stanford. He removes the dis
eased organs from the patient who
is to receive the transplanted
heart and lung. The replacement
organs are brought in after being
retrieved from a deceased donor
at a community hospital, and
Starnes sews them in.
Meanwhile, the heart Starnes
removes is taken to an adjacent
room where one of Stanford's
senior transplant surgeons heads
another team responsible for im
planting the heart in another pa
tient. The heart-lung transplant
and the heart transplant both
take approximately three to four
hours.
The one-year survival rate for
heart transplants is 82 percent,
while it is 65 percent for the heart -

lung transplant. Stanford
transplant recipients have been
known to live as long as seven
years after surgery, and the
quality of life is good.
Starnes said that the most sig
nificant obstacle in heart-lung op
erations is previous surgery. Scar
tissue from these operations
causes the heart and lung to stick
to the underside of the chest
cavity. This makes it difficult to
remove the diseased organs and
increases the risk of bleeding.
However, Stanford surgeons have
developed techniques for working
around this problem.
The most common complica
tions after surgery are secondary
infection and rejection of the
transplanted organs. There are
thorough weekly examinations for

the presence of infection, and
pieces of lung tissue are removed
and used to check for rejection.
Says Starnes, "By careful surveil
lance we have made the post
operative period for a lot of these
patients a much more straightfor
ward convalescent period."
Advances in the future of heart
lung transplantation are often
thought to hinge on the develop
ment of better ways of preventing
rejection. The rejection of donor
organs stems from the body's own
immune system recognizing the
foreign proteins of a transplanted
organ and trying to rid the body
of such proteins. Currently,
transplant patients receive drugs
called immunosuppressants,
which weaken the body's immune
response.

Dr. Starnes is examining helper
T-cells, which are part of the im
mune mechanism. The helper T
cell is thought to be responsible
for the recognition of foreign
proteins. Starnes uses a type of
antibody, known as a monoclonal
antibody, to attach to the helper
T-cells and consequently prevent
them from initiating rejection.
Working in collaboration with
the immunology department,
Starnes has succeeded in trans
planting organs in a rat without
rejection after treatment by using
monoclonal antibodies without
any further immunosuppressive
medications. Implantation in
monkeys using a monoclonal an
tibody treatment is the next step
before implantation in humans.
