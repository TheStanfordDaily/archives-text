# Sorry, orange juice won't cure your cold

### June Cohen Staff writer 
Health is not the top priority in life
for most college students, and the long
term benefits of nutrition, along with
sleep and mental serenity, are often
ignored by students as they deal with
the day-to-day pressures of college life.
Instead of making concerted efforts
to improve their diet, many students
who are concerned about their health
take multi-vitamin supplements,
believing these quick-fixes will
miraculously compensate for un
healthy eating habits.
Unfortunately for stressed students,
this is not the case. The benefits of
most dietary supplements have not
been demonstrated conclusively, while
excessive doses of many vitamins and
minerals have proven to be detrimen
tal, and even lethal.
Last March, the National Research
Council publicized an extensive report
on the American diet, in which dietary
supplements of calcium, fish oil, fiber
and vitamins were deemed useless.
The need for dietary supplements
has been overstated by the media. The
average adult derives most necessary
nutrients from a fairly well-balanced
diet. And despite what advertisements
claim, components lacking in the diet
can be incorporated with fairly minor
adjustments.
Some people claim that specific

nutrients help prevent disease. How
ever, this conclusion is drawn from
research on individuals whose diets are
rich in the nutrient — not those who
take supplements.
For instance, vitamin A is frequently
associated with cancer prevention and
improved eyesight, Since people whose
diets are rich in beta-carotene have a
low incidence of colon and lung cancer.
The studies were not based on indi
viduals taking vitamin A supplements.
Carotene, which occurs naturally in
plants, is converted to vitamin A in
the body. Excessive dosages of beta
carotene will just turn your skin or
ange, while similar amounts of vitamin
A can kill you.
Why take vitamin A supplements,
which, in megadoses, have been linked
to hair loss, liver disease, birth defects
and even death, when you can just eat
a few carrot sticks from the salad bar
instead?
Vitamin-B complex supplements are
used for fighting colds, achieving

healthy skin and a variety of other
reasons. The B complex vitamins do
indeed help with these tasks, but the
effectiveness of supplements in achiev
ing the same ends is questionable.
Vitamin B-6 particularly, is contro
versial, due to its toxicity at high
dosages. Although the U.S. Recom
mended Daily Allowance for vitamin
B-6 is only two milligrams a day, it
was believed to be non-toxic until 1983.
It was then discovered that daily
dosages of 50 milligrams could be le
thal and that excessive amounts below
the toxic level can cause extensive
nerve degeneration.
Calcium needs, especially in young
women, have also received extensive
media coverage. There is a connection
between calcium deficiency and os
teoporosis.
Common among post-menopausal
women, osteoporosis causes the
degeneration of the bones and
frequently results in repeated frac
tures.
Although dietary calcium is essential
for building strong bones to prevent
the onset of osteoporosis, the value of
supplements in effecting the same con
dition is not universally accepted.
Since calcium supplements can
cause constipation and interfere with
iron absorption, it is probably smarter
to avoid them and concentrate on in
corporating calcium-rich foods, such
as yogurt, broccoli or low-fat milk and

cottage cheese, into the diet.
Nobel laureate Linus Pauling claims
that vitamin C can cure and prevent
the common cold. Vitamin C has,
indeed, become an institution among
college students who swear by its
healing properties.
Although excess vitamin C passes
quickly out of the system and is not
known to cause any serious side
effects, the supplements have draw
backs. Overdoses have been known to
cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea
— the very cold symptoms one tries
to avoid.
Despite the drawbacks, there are
some people who should consider
taking dietary supplements.
Vegetarians who don't eat dairy prod
ucts or eggs or people who consume
less than 1,200 calories a day should
consider supplements, since they are
at a high risk for vitamin deficiencies.
Overall, the prevailing opinion
among the medical community is that
dietary supplements not exceeding 100
to 150 percent of the U.S. RDA prob
ably won't hurt you. However, good
health and nutrition is best achieved
by eating enough and eating properly,
thereby avoiding the need for supple
ments.
Besides, no one ever really gets used
to swallowing pills, and with the
money you save not purchasing bottles
of costly vitamins, you can buy your
self the new Neil Young CD instead.

term benefits of nutrition, along with
sleep and mental serenity, are often
ignored by students as they deal with
the day-to-day pressures of college life.
Instead of making concerted efforts
to improve their diet, many students
who are concerned about their health
take multi-vitamin supplements,
believing these quick-fixes will
miraculously compensate for un
healthy eating habits.
Unfortunately for stressed students,
this is not the case. The benefits of
most dietary supplements have not
been demonstrated conclusively, while
excessive doses of many vitamins and
minerals have proven to be detrimen
tal, and even lethal.
Last March, the National Research
Council publicized an extensive report
on the American diet, in which dietary
supplements of calcium, fish oil, fiber
and vitamins were deemed useless.
The need for dietary supplements
has been overstated by the media. The
average adult derives most necessary
nutrients from a fairly well-balanced
diet. And despite what advertisements
claim, components lacking in the diet
can be incorporated with fairly minor
adjustments.
Some people claim that specific

nutrients help prevent disease. How
ever, this conclusion is drawn from
research on individuals whose diets are
rich in the nutrient — not those who
take supplements.
For instance, vitamin A is frequently
associated with cancer prevention and
improved eyesight, Since people whose
diets are rich in beta-carotene have a
low incidence of colon and lung cancer.
The studies were not based on indi
viduals taking vitamin A supplements.
Carotene, which occurs naturally in
plants, is converted to vitamin A in
the body. Excessive dosages of beta
carotene will just turn your skin or
ange, while similar amounts of vitamin
A can kill you.
Why take vitamin A supplements,
which, in megadoses, have been linked
to hair loss, liver disease, birth defects
and even death, when you can just eat
a few carrot sticks from the salad bar
instead?
Vitamin-B complex supplements are
used for fighting colds, achieving

healthy skin and a variety of other
reasons. The B complex vitamins do
indeed help with these tasks, but the
effectiveness of supplements in achiev
ing the same ends is questionable.
Vitamin B-6 particularly, is contro
versial, due to its toxicity at high
dosages. Although the U.S. Recom
mended Daily Allowance for vitamin
B-6 is only two milligrams a day, it
was believed to be non-toxic until 1983.
It was then discovered that daily
dosages of 50 milligrams could be le
thal and that excessive amounts below
the toxic level can cause extensive
nerve degeneration.
Calcium needs, especially in young
women, have also received extensive
media coverage. There is a connection
between calcium deficiency and os
teoporosis.
Common among post-menopausal
women, osteoporosis causes the
degeneration of the bones and
frequently results in repeated frac
tures.
Although dietary calcium is essential
for building strong bones to prevent
the onset of osteoporosis, the value of
supplements in effecting the same con
dition is not universally accepted.
Since calcium supplements can
cause constipation and interfere with
iron absorption, it is probably smarter
to avoid them and concentrate on in
corporating calcium-rich foods, such
as yogurt, broccoli or low-fat milk and

cottage cheese, into the diet.
Nobel laureate Linus Pauling claims
that vitamin C can cure and prevent
the common cold. Vitamin C has,
indeed, become an institution among
college students who swear by its
healing properties.
Although excess vitamin C passes
quickly out of the system and is not
known to cause any serious side
effects, the supplements have draw
backs. Overdoses have been known to
cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea
— the very cold symptoms one tries
to avoid.
Despite the drawbacks, there are
some people who should consider
taking dietary supplements.
Vegetarians who don't eat dairy prod
ucts or eggs or people who consume
less than 1,200 calories a day should
consider supplements, since they are
at a high risk for vitamin deficiencies.
Overall, the prevailing opinion
among the medical community is that
dietary supplements not exceeding 100
to 150 percent of the U.S. RDA prob
ably won't hurt you. However, good
health and nutrition is best achieved
by eating enough and eating properly,
thereby avoiding the need for supple
ments.
Besides, no one ever really gets used
to swallowing pills, and with the
money you save not purchasing bottles
of costly vitamins, you can buy your
self the new Neil Young CD instead.
