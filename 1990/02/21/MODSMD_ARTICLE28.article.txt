Earliest life on earth
Only primitive bacteria could survive the
volcanic conditions of 3.5 billion years ago.
Geology Prof. Donald Lowe thinks that the
earth was covered with irregular rocky islands
similar to modern Hawaii. Just off the shores
of the islands, primitive photosynthetic bac
teria lived on submerged rocks.
Lowe has studied the oldest known rocks
— found in Western Australia and Southern
Africa — to find layers that were temporarily
free of volcanic activity. The material settled
out of these layers give an indication of life
on earth 3.5 billion years ago.
Lowe said that carbon remains and microfos
sils in the sediments indicate that the domi
nant organisms were bacteria that grew in
mats on the rocks. According to his studies,
the fact that bacterial communities have been
found largely in shallow waters and scarcely
in deeper waters suggests that they were pho
tosynthetic.
For the bacteria to use light, they must
have far more complex structures than previ
ously thought possible. They also would have
released oxygen into the air, long thought to
be absent from the earth's original atmosphere.
He describes the analysis of the geologic
record as the decipherment of an incomplete
and foreign bode. Lowe said, "Most of the the
rock record has been obliterated or destroyed,
so it would be like taking a book and burning
three-quarters of it, tearing it up and having
it written in a foreign language . . . and then
expecting someone to put together the story."
