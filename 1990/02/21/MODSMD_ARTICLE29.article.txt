## Parson thrives out of limelight Senior guard finds her niche coming off bench 
### Debbie Spander Editorial staff 
Not many basketball players relish
the role of spelling the team's top gun
— for four years.
But Stanford's Stacy Parson wouldn't
have it any other way. The 5-foot-7
senior guard has been a backup for Ail-
American Jennifer Azzi for the duration
of her stay on the Farm. In her four
years she has started just four games.
There is, however, no other place Parson
would rather be.
"The combination of the athletic and
academic opportunity at Stanford can
not be matched, especially considering
how well we're doing now athletically,"
Parson said. "Stanford is the best."
Coming out of Kennedy High School
in Southern California, Parson was a
hot recruit. Averaging 19.6 points, 10
rebounds, and 3.6 steals a contest her
senior year, the Converse All-America
was innundated with scholarship offers.
But it didn't take the Simi Valley
native long to make up her mind. With
out the promise of a starting spot, or
even the lure of a winning record, Stan
ford Coach Tara VanDerveer's offer was
still too good to pass up.
"I narrowed it down really quick,"
Parson said. "Academics was the big
thing; basketball was a close second.
And it was obvious that Tara could
make this program go somewhere. She
talked a lot about where she wanted
the team to evolve, and I kind of just
had confidence in her ability."
Not only did Parson judge the pro
gram, and the coach, correctly, but she
has also become an integral part of Stan
ford's No. 3-ranked squad as the third
guard in VanDerveer's rotation. While
she has rarely been an opening-buzzer
player, the reserve has definitely con

tributed to Stanford's rise into the ranks
of women's basketball elite.
As the sixth "man," she averaged 2.8
points and 1.2 rebounds her freshman
year and was fourth on the team in
assists, with 40. The lack of a starting
role didn't faze Parson at all.
"I wasn't thinking that I was going
to come in and star — it was a great
opportunity just to come here, whatever
happened," Parson said. "I figured if I
ended up playing a a lot, great. If I
came off the bench, it would be okay
because I was young and had a lot to
learn."
After three years, Parson is still com
ing off the bench, but her reseve position
does not change the analysis of her role
or of her decision. Looking back, she
has no qualms about her choice of
schools, even if she could have attained
the rank of starter with another pro
gram.
"I never looked back and said 'If I
had gone to that school I would be a
star,' " she said. "I don't know if being
in the spotlight is an important part of
me. Besides, it's not important playing
40 minutes at another school, because
it isn't the No. 3 [basketball] school in
the country."
With the arrival of other highly
touted guards — namely Sonja Henning,
Martha Richards, and Molly Gooden
bour — Parson's playing time has been
cut down even further. Nevertheless,
she is a vital member of the squad,
coming off the bench to contribute in
all areas, especially in defense — where
her fellow players call her "very quick."
After 23 games she is averaging three
points and 1.4 assists per game, while
playing over 12 minutes a contest. She
is also shooting .554 from the field —
tops on the team.
The social psychology major also fills

40 minutes at another
school, because it isn't
the No. 3 [basketball]
school in the country.'

in wherever needed, starting in place
of the irgured Henning in the Arizona
game, scoring eight points in 26 minutes
against No. 6 Long Beach State and
giving teammates advice wherever she
sees possibility of improvement.
She is also seen by courtmates as
being a great asset as a peer coach. The
guard routinely analyzes what each
player is or is not doing correctly and
gives out pointers. "She's a real positive
force for the younger players ," fellow
guard Martha Richards said. "She really
helps us out in practice."
But Parson is wary of putting a label
on her role. "I have a hard time answer
ing questions about my role," she stated.
"I come off the bench and contribute
whatever I can."
"I know we have tons of people who
can score, so I don't feel I need to come
in and put up points," she added.
Richards, however, has a definition.
"She's our silent leader — she leads by
example. It just happens naturally for
her."
Whatever the label, Parson's role is
obviously fitting well into the Cardinal's
game plan, as the squad's 22-1 record
attests.
Even without Parson in the starting
five, the Cardinal squad and Stanford
fans are happy she made the decision
that she did.

Stacy Parson has handled her role as Backup to the Stars dexterously in her tenure
at Stanford. A senior, Parson has seen few starts for the Cardinal, but has provided
the depth and stability from the bench.
