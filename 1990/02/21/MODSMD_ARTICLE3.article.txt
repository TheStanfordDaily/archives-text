# Stanford budget woes not unique
## Many Ivy League schools face similar problems on a smaller scale 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
Stanford's budget woes are apparently
representative of a larger trend of fi
nancial problems among a group of top
research institutions.
The University is joined in its budget
struggles by Yale University, MIT, Co
lumbia University, Harvard University
and the University of Pennsylvania,
among others.
Although not all of these schools have
budget problems of the magnitude of
Stanford's, their financial officers are
concerned about their financial futures.
In particular, many of these financial
problems center around research fund
ing from the federal government.
Federal funding for research projects
comes in two forms, direct costs and
indirect costs.
Direct costs refer to the cost of the
materials for an experiment and the
experimenter's time, while indirect costs
go to reimburse the universities ex
penses, such as building upkeep, reno
vation of research facilities and support
staff.

Each university determines its own
indirect cost rate. This year, Stanford's
indirect cost rate, which is 74 percent,
is the third highest among all mtyor
research universities.
Because of federal deficit reductions
mandated by the Gramm-Rudman Act,
the amount of money for federal re
search has been slowly declining over
the past few years. This decline has led
to the loss of income and the deficit
that Stanford and some other schools
now face.
Yale is confronting problems very
similar to Stanford's. According to as
sociate controller Phillip Turcotte, "Yale
will have a balanced budget, but it will
be a struggle."
Turcotte blamed the current problems
on a combination of factors, including
the relatively good economy of the
1980s.
"The '80s were a good period, but
now the situation has changed," Tur
cotte said. Increases in revenue from
research as well as other sources are
not as great as they have been in past
years.
Turcotte added that he is concerned

about future research grants, given the
state of the federal budget. While federal
funding has been increasing "a bit above
the inflation rate," he said he is unsure
about whether these increases will con
tinue.
Yale's indirect cost rate will remain
at its current level of 68 percent through
June 1991. Turcotte said he expects it
to increase after that.
Turcotte attributed the increases in
indirect costs to three significant areas.
One factor is increased construction and
renovation of facilities, as is also the
case at Stanford.
In addition, costs have risen for waste
disposal and for the care of animals
used in research, Turcotte said.
MIT has also suffered from reduced
research funds from the government,
much so that it has a deficit, according
to controller Philip Keohan.
As a result, MIT is being very con
servative in making budget decisions,
he said. "We are looking at programs
to see where they can be trimmed."
Keohan said he doesn't anticipate any
