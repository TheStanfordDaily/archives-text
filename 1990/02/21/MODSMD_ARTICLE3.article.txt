# Stanford budget woes not unique
## Many Ivy League schools face similar problems on a smaller scale 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
Stanford's budget woes are apparently
representative of a larger trend of fi
nancial problems among a group of top
research institutions.
The University is joined in its budget
struggles by Yale University, MIT, Co
lumbia University, Harvard University
and the University of Pennsylvania,
among others.
Although not all of these schools have
budget problems of the magnitude of
Stanford's, their financial officers are
concerned about their financial futures.
In particular, many of these financial
problems center around research fund
ing from the federal government.
Federal funding for research projects
comes in two forms, direct costs and
indirect costs.
Direct costs refer to the cost of the
materials for an experiment and the
experimenter's time, while indirect costs
go to reimburse the universities ex
penses, such as building upkeep, reno
vation of research facilities and support
staff.

Each university determines its own
indirect cost rate. This year, Stanford's
indirect cost rate, which is 74 percent,
is the third highest among all mtyor
research universities.
Because of federal deficit reductions
mandated by the Gramm-Rudman Act,
the amount of money for federal re
search has been slowly declining over
the past few years. This decline has led
to the loss of income and the deficit
that Stanford and some other schools
now face.
Yale is confronting problems very
similar to Stanford's. According to as
sociate controller Phillip Turcotte, "Yale
will have a balanced budget, but it will
be a struggle."
Turcotte blamed the current problems
on a combination of factors, including
the relatively good economy of the
1980s.
"The '80s were a good period, but
now the situation has changed," Tur
cotte said. Increases in revenue from
research as well as other sources are
not as great as they have been in past
years.
Turcotte added that he is concerned

about future research grants, given the
state of the federal budget. While federal
funding has been increasing "a bit above
the inflation rate," he said he is unsure
about whether these increases will con
tinue.
Yale's indirect cost rate will remain
at its current level of 68 percent through
June 1991. Turcotte said he expects it
to increase after that.
Turcotte attributed the increases in
indirect costs to three significant areas.
One factor is increased construction and
renovation of facilities, as is also the
case at Stanford.
In addition, costs have risen for waste
disposal and for the care of animals
used in research, Turcotte said.
MIT has also suffered from reduced
research funds from the government,
much so that it has a deficit, according
to controller Philip Keohan.
As a result, MIT is being very con
servative in making budget decisions,
he said. "We are looking at programs
to see where they can be trimmed."
Keohan said he doesn't anticipate any
substantial increases in federal
funding. "We have had a flatten
ing research growth over the past
few years," he said.
MlT's indirect cost rate is cur
rently 62 percent. Next year's rate
has not yet been determined, ac
cording to Keohan.
Columbia officials are also con
cerned about future federal
grants. Associate controller Rich
ard Ruttenberg said Columbia's
budget is under "tremendous
pressure. ... There will be a lot
of difficulty in balancing the
budget."
Ruttenberg said he hopes that

Congress will be "mindful of the
needs of universities."
Columbia's indirect cost rate is
currently 74.1 percent, slightly
higher than Stanford's. The rate
has stayed at this level for about
five years, and Ruttenberg does
not anticipate any immediate in
crease.
However, Ruttenberg did not
rule out the possibility of an even
tual increase. Given Columbia's
needs for renovation and moder
nization over the next few years,
"something will have to be done"
about the added indirect costs, he
said.
Not every research university
is facing a severe budget crunch.
According to Judy Warren, Har
vard's director of finance and ac-

At Harvard, there is
general concern
about the decline in
federal funds but no
overall budget deficit.

counting, there is general concern
about the decline in federal funds,
but there is no overall budget def
icit problem.
However, because Harvard is
very decentralized, with individ
ual schools and departments
having more control over their
budgets, officials have not called
for across-the-board cuts.
Harvard's indirect cost rate
varies among different depart

ments of the university. For most
on-campus projects, the rate is
currently 68 percent.
Peter Tiskus, manager of indi
rect cost accounting, said that fig
ures will likely increase to pay for
renovations.
The University of Pennsylvania
seems to be faring better than
many other universities in terms
of its finances.
While the university is spending
less money and is receiving less
from the federal government,
there has been little change in
total funding, according to Sandra
Houck, assistant director of re
search administration.
Penn's indirect cost rate will
remain at its current level of 65
percent through 1992, Houck said.
