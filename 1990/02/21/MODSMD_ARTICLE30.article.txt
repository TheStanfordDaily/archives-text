# VanDerveer, Stanford brewing up a national champion
## 
### 
Good afternoon, class. Welcome to
Chemistry 101. Today's lesson will
be on the Stanford women's bas
ketball team.
Ranked No. 3 in the country, one might
think the Cardinal has players sprinkled
all over the national statistics. In reality,
only three members of the team appear
anywhere on the leader board.
Sonja Henning is on the assist list,
Jennifer Azzi is one of the best free throw
shooters and Katy Steding is among the
best in three-point accuracy.
No top scorers. No top rebounders.
One top contender for a national cham
pionship.
What's the reason?
Azzi or Steding — in fact any of Stan
ford's top six scorers — could probably
ring up almost 25 points per game with
lesser teammates surrounding them. At
Stanford, everyone worries less about
their individual total than the team total.
In other words, if the Cardinal is winning,
everything's OK with everyone.
The result is apparent in the Pacific
10 Conference statistics. Stanford is first
in eight of the 12 team categories includ
ing scoring, shooting percentage, margin
of victory and rebounding differential.
Oregon is the conference's second high
est scoring team at 75.3 points per game.
The Cardinal averages 91.4.
Washington's field goal percentage of

.452 is second best in the Pac-10. Stanford
shoots .506.
The Huskies win by over 13 points on
the average. The Cardinal wins by 26.
From Azzi to Julie Zeilstra (A-to-Z, get
it?), Stanford's players realize that while
30-point scoring averages and double
figure rebounding totals can win Player
of the Year awards, they rarely capture
NCAA titles.
Talk to the Cardinal women and they
all use the expression "our team" in ref
erence to, well, their team. The unselfish
attitude extends onto the court where
you can find Stanford players giving up
shots if they see a teammate in a better
position to whom they can pass the ball.
While many believe Coach Tara Van-
Derveer's greatest strength is her ability
to recruit top talent, it seems that fos
tering a "we first" instead of "me first"
mentality is an even greater achievement.
Covering the team this season, I
have spoken at some length with
most of the players. Rarely, does
a conversation last more than a few
minutes before the person I'm talking to
starts in about someone else's achieve
ments.
Try to imagine Jose Canseco singing
the praises of Ron Hassey in a postgame
interview. Not bloody likely.
But talk to Azzi about the team and

she'll tell you how great Henning is. Ask
Trisha Stevens about why she's scoring
so well and she credits Steding for giving
her great passes. Merely a sampling of
what you can hear each and every day
from the Cardinal.
If it was just lip service, the words
would still be impressive in an era where
athlete and ego are often synonymous.
Watching the team play, though, it be
comes apparent the words are mirrors of
the team's actions.
When the legendary Pete Newell
watched Stanford play a few weeks ago,
he was impressed by the universal un
selfishness, He also liked the way the
team did the little things — setting
screens, boxing out — that separate the
great teams from the merely very good
ones.
When the Cardinal suffered its
first loss of the season at Wash
ington, it came as something of
a shock and disappointment. When all is
said and done, it may have been just
what the team needed.
Stanford learned what it needed to
work harder on, where it needed to be
better, how it could prevent another loss.
Practice is more intense than it was two
weeks ago. The team's focus is clearer
than ever.
The coaches have the attention of the

players and work is now centering on
what the Cardinal can do to hurt other
teams on the road to the Final Four. The
talk of the team is pressure defense and
transition offense. Stanford got where it
is by dictating tempo and running oppo
nents out of the gym.
Since the season began, it has been
OK to admit the goal is a national crown.
No one has been denying they want to
win it all. Right now, the Cardinal is
concentrating on doing the things they
will need to do in order to bring home
the championship trophy.
There are five games left on the
regular-season schedule. Last year at this
point, Stanford performed what VanDer
veer calls a "takeoff." The Cardinal's
game suddenly came together at a higher
level. In the team's final eight games,
they scored 100 or better five times.
It is takeoff time again and Stanford
knows it. The wakeup call in Washington

may very well be the fuel that makes
the takeoff a reality.
Random notes. The Cardinal is third
in the Associated Press poll for the
second straight week. This time,
though, they are much closer to second
place UNLV than to fourth-place Ten
nessee. USA Today gave Stanford back
the No. 2 spot after taking it away a
week earlier.
Given that UNLV did not lose over the
weekend, there does not seem to be any
logic to the changes. Unless, of course,
the pollsters realized Stanford never
should have slipped in the rankings in
the first place.
As you probably know, the Cardinal
will host the West Regional of the NCAA
Tournament in March. Tournament
pairings will not be announced for several
weeks, but. . . .
Probable No. 1 seeds in the four
regionals (barring any defeats among top
ranked teams): At Stanford — Stanford.
At Old Dominion — Tennessee. At lowa
— UNLV. At Texas — Louisiana Tech.
Visitors to the regional in Maples:
Georgia, Long Beach State and Hawaii.
Feel free to clip and save these. But
please, feel free to forget I ever brought
up the subject when these predictions
are proven to be worth less than the
paper they're printed on.

it?), Stanford's players realize that while
30-point scoring averages and double
figure rebounding totals can win Player
of the Year awards, they rarely capture
NCAA titles.
Talk to the Cardinal women and they
all use the expression "our team" in ref
erence to, well, their team. The unselfish
attitude extends onto the court where
you can find Stanford players giving up
shots if they see a teammate in a better
position to whom they can pass the ball.
While many believe Coach Tara Van-
Derveer's greatest strength is her ability
to recruit top talent, it seems that fos
tering a "we first" instead of "me first"
mentality is an even greater achievement.
Covering the team this season, I
have spoken at some length with
most of the players. Rarely, does
a conversation last more than a few
minutes before the person I'm talking to
starts in about someone else's achieve
ments.
Try to imagine Jose Canseco singing
the praises of Ron Hassey in a postgame
interview. Not bloody likely.
But talk to Azzi about the team and

she'll tell you how great Henning is. Ask
Trisha Stevens about why she's scoring
so well and she credits Steding for giving
her great passes. Merely a sampling of
what you can hear each and every day
from the Cardinal.
If it was just lip service, the words
would still be impressive in an era where
athlete and ego are often synonymous.
Watching the team play, though, it be
comes apparent the words are mirrors of
the team's actions.
When the legendary Pete Newell
watched Stanford play a few weeks ago,
he was impressed by the universal un
selfishness, He also liked the way the
team did the little things — setting
screens, boxing out — that separate the
great teams from the merely very good
ones.
When the Cardinal suffered its
first loss of the season at Wash
ington, it came as something of
a shock and disappointment. When all is
said and done, it may have been just
what the team needed.
Stanford learned what it needed to
work harder on, where it needed to be
better, how it could prevent another loss.
Practice is more intense than it was two
weeks ago. The team's focus is clearer
than ever.
The coaches have the attention of the

players and work is now centering on
what the Cardinal can do to hurt other
teams on the road to the Final Four. The
talk of the team is pressure defense and
transition offense. Stanford got where it
is by dictating tempo and running oppo
nents out of the gym.
Since the season began, it has been
OK to admit the goal is a national crown.
No one has been denying they want to
win it all. Right now, the Cardinal is
concentrating on doing the things they
will need to do in order to bring home
the championship trophy.
There are five games left on the
regular-season schedule. Last year at this
point, Stanford performed what VanDer
veer calls a "takeoff." The Cardinal's
game suddenly came together at a higher
level. In the team's final eight games,
they scored 100 or better five times.
It is takeoff time again and Stanford
knows it. The wakeup call in Washington

may very well be the fuel that makes
the takeoff a reality.
Random notes. The Cardinal is third
in the Associated Press poll for the
second straight week. This time,
though, they are much closer to second
place UNLV than to fourth-place Ten
nessee. USA Today gave Stanford back
the No. 2 spot after taking it away a
week earlier.
Given that UNLV did not lose over the
weekend, there does not seem to be any
logic to the changes. Unless, of course,
the pollsters realized Stanford never
should have slipped in the rankings in
the first place.
As you probably know, the Cardinal
will host the West Regional of the NCAA
Tournament in March. Tournament
pairings will not be announced for several
weeks, but. . . .
Probable No. 1 seeds in the four
regionals (barring any defeats among top
ranked teams): At Stanford — Stanford.
At Old Dominion — Tennessee. At lowa
— UNLV. At Texas — Louisiana Tech.
Visitors to the regional in Maples:
Georgia, Long Beach State and Hawaii.
Feel free to clip and save these. But
please, feel free to forget I ever brought
up the subject when these predictions
are proven to be worth less than the
paper they're printed on.

Good afternoon, class. Welcome to
Chemistry 101. Today's lesson will
be on the Stanford women's bas
ketball team.
Ranked No. 3 in the country, one might
think the Cardinal has players sprinkled
all over the national statistics. In reality,
only three members of the team appear
anywhere on the leader board.
Sonja Henning is on the assist list,
Jennifer Azzi is one of the best free throw
shooters and Katy Steding is among the
best in three-point accuracy.
No top scorers. No top rebounders.
One top contender for a national cham
pionship.
What's the reason?
Azzi or Steding — in fact any of Stan
ford's top six scorers — could probably
ring up almost 25 points per game with
lesser teammates surrounding them. At
Stanford, everyone worries less about
their individual total than the team total.
In other words, if the Cardinal is winning,
everything's OK with everyone.
The result is apparent in the Pacific
10 Conference statistics. Stanford is first
in eight of the 12 team categories includ
ing scoring, shooting percentage, margin
of victory and rebounding differential.
Oregon is the conference's second high
est scoring team at 75.3 points per game.
The Cardinal averages 91.4.
Washington's field goal percentage of

.452 is second best in the Pac-10. Stanford
shoots .506.
The Huskies win by over 13 points on
the average. The Cardinal wins by 26.
From Azzi to Julie Zeilstra (A-to-Z, get
it?), Stanford's players realize that while
30-point scoring averages and double
figure rebounding totals can win Player
of the Year awards, they rarely capture
NCAA titles.
Talk to the Cardinal women and they

erence to, well, their team. The unselfish
