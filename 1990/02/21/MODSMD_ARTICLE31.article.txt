# Top-ranked Cardinal too tired
## Fourth game in last three days ends in loss 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Sunken Diamond yesterday
looked like a battlefield from the
American Revolution.
Stanford and St. Mary's lined
up their columns of pitchers and
fired away. When the smoke had
cleared from the 3 hour and 40
minute melee, each team had used
six pitchers and the Gaels escaped
with a 6-5 non-conference victory
over the top-ranked Cardinal.

Gaels 6
Cardinal 5

St. Mary's improved to 5-4 on
the year, while the Cardinal,
losers of two of their last three,
dropped to 12-3. Stanford is 2-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference's
Southern Division after an ex
tended weekend visit to UCLA.
The Gaels celebrated the upset
as though they had just won the
national championship, but Stan
ford could do little more than let
out a long yawn. With the com
pletion of yesterday's game, Stan
ford has played 34 innings of
baseball in a 48-hour, bus-ride in
terrupted period.
While the Gaels were preparing
for battle, Stanford was force
marching from Southern Califor
nia, where the Cardinal Monday
completed a rain-delayed series
with UCLA. Stanford split Mon
day's doubleheader with the

Bruins after winning Sunday's
rain-continued match, 16-5. The
team returned to Stanford at 1:30
a.m. Tuesday morning and was
back on the field 12 hours later.
But Coach and field general
Mark Marquess, a veteran of
many baseball wars, would not
let fatigue be used as an excuse
for the loss to St. Mary's. "That's
not an excuse. We left a lot of
men on base and they simply out
played us," he said.
Stanford left 14 men on base,
to be exact — 12 in the first six
innings — while St. Mary's took
advantage of several key Cardinal
errors and never trailed.
But six Stanford pitchers kept
the Gaels within striking distance,
and in the ninth inning Stanford
had the tying run in scoring po
sition with Troy Paulsen — the
team's leading hitter — at bat.
Troy Tallman, who was pinch
running for Mark Skeels at sec
ond, broke for third on a pitch in
the dirt and was easily thrown
out by St. Mary's catcher Ryan
Haley to end the game. Paulsen,
hitting .528 in his last seven
games, was left standing at the
plate, bat in hand.
St. Mary's tagged Cardinal
starter John Reid for three runs,
all earned, on seven hits in his
three innings of work, while Stan
ford didn't manage a hit off St.
Mary's left-hander Toby Foreman
until Paul Carey's single in the
third.
St. Mary's scored a solo run in
the first on a bunt single by left-

and an RBI single by cleanup hit
ter Mike Zanski.
The Gaels added two more runs
in the third on a run-scoring
single by Cooper and a solo home
run by Zanski. Zanski led the
Gaels with two hits and two RBI.
Stanford awoke from its early
slumber in the fourth inning, as
left-fielder Ryan Turner scored on
Paulsen's sacrifice fly to center.
Roger Burnett led off the inning
with a double but was gunned
down at third base on a grounder
into the hole between shortstop

and third by Turner. David
McCarty struck out with two men
on to end the Cardinal threat.
Stanford tied the game in the
sixth inning at 3-3 off right
hander Mark Chiarucci, who
pitched two innings. With one out,
freshman Jeff Hammonds
chopped a double over third base
and was singled to third by Paul
sen.
McCarty scored Hammonds
with a fly ball to right field, and
after an intentional pass to Carey,
senior Tim Griffin singled to
right, scoring Paulsen.
While Stanford struggled to

come alive offensively, defensively
the Cardinal was cruising. Senior
Rob Kamerschen, freshman Tim
Moore and freshman Greg Mix
each hurled one inning of no-hit,
shutout baseball.
"Moore, Mix and Kamerschen
got to pitch — that was really
good," said Marquess, who has the
good fortune of having a pitching
staff that may be too deep at
times. Kamerschen was 6-0 in
1988 as a sophomore, but pitched
for only the first time in 1990
yesterday after recovering from a
strained elbow tendon in 1989.
The Gaels broke open the game

in the seventh inning, scoring
three runs off freshman John
Lynch and junior Scott Weiss.
Lynch, who threw seven pitches -
six of them out of the strike zone
— picked up the loss in his first
collegiate outing. He faced only
two batters before being yanked.
All six Stanford pitchers com
bined struck out eight and walked
two, allowing five earned runs.
The Gaels scored twice more in
the seventh with the help of a
passed ball, another wild pitch
and a double by center-fielder
James Mouton.


Damlan Marhefka - Dally
Troy Paulsen didn't miss the tag on this Gael runner, but the Cardinal missed their chance to improve
on their 12-2 record with a 6-5 loss yesterday at Sunken Diamond. Paulsen went 1-for-4 at the plate
with an RBI on the afternoon.
