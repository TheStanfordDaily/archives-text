# NorCal final is all Stanford
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
For lack of a better euphemism, the Stanford
men's tennis team was the finals of the NorCal
Intercollegiate Tennis Championships at California's
Hellman Tennis Complex yesterday.
In a tournament that featured the best college
tennis players in Northern California, Stanford net
ters captured all six spots in the singles and doubles
finals, proving that the Cardinal team certainly has
more depth than any team in Northern California,
if not in the country.
Freshman Johnathan Stark's never-say-die play
in the semifinals highlighted yesterday's perform
ance as Stark came back to beat California's Doug
Eisenman, 1-6, 6-3, 7-6.
After breaking Eisenman in the first game, Stark
lost the next six. The Cardinal freshman, who was
the No. 1 seed in the tournament, went on to win
the second set but was still struggling to hold serve.
In fact, he only held serve three times in the first
two sets — a problem considering that Stark's
serve is one of his mfyor weapons.
In the third set, Stark continued to struggle,
especially with his serve. He went down 5-0 before
things started to click. "I wasn't going to give up
[even though I was down 5-0 in the third set],"
Stark said. "I just wanted to win one game. I was
serving, and he actually had a match point. But I
won that game. I broke him, and one thing led to
another. The next thing I knew I was back in the
match."
"It was a classic example of it's never over until
it's over," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "He just
hung in there, hung in there and hung in there
until the end. I wish more of the guys on the team
could have been there to see it."
In the other singles semifinals, sophomore Alex
O'Brien, who was seeded second, downed teammate
Glenn Solomon, 6-3, 6-3. The match was played at
Stanford Tennis Stadium instead of at California's
Hellman Complex so that both players could attend
classes. O'Brien won the NorCal championship last
year.
The all-Stanford final between Stark and O'Brien
will not be held until after the squad returns from
the National Team Indoors in Louisville, Ky.
As in the singles, Stanford dominated the doubles
competition. In the finals, the freshmen tandem of
Stark and Jared Palmer overcame a "slow" first
set to top the Stanford team of freshman Alexis
Hombrecher and sophomore Jason Yee, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2.
