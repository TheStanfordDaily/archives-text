# Women netters to take on No. 7 Cal
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Though baseball camps are
closed, Arizona still did a nice job
of serving as spring training for
the Stanford women's tennis
team.
The Cardinal escaped from the
Bay Area's version of winter to
take on Arizona State and Arizona
over the weekend. In their first
action against ranked opponents,
the team came away with a pair
of victories.
"It's always a good test," said
Coach Frank Brennan of the Ar
izona trip. "Arizona is
(particularly) tough on us."
Tough, indeed. Stanford has
rarely been forced to doubles over
the past two seasons, yet the Wild
cats did it once last year and again
last weekend. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, its doubles tandems
came through with flying colors.
One of those duos, the No. 3
team of Lisa Green and Heather
Willens, had not played together
before the weekend. At Arizona
State Friday, the two were paired
up on something of a lark. Kylie
Johnson, who was paired with
Willens at third doubles, was sick
with the flu and unable to play.
Mario Carruth was Green's
partner. She could have teamed
with Green and filled in at No.
3, but she was still busy playing
No. 6 singles. Brennan put Willens
and Green together, liked what
he saw and deemed them Stan
ford's No. 3 doubles team "per
manently, temporarily."
"I feel pretty good about the
team at this point," Brennan said.
"We're playing very well."
He said he was more secure
than he was after the trip to Min
neapolis for the Rolex tourna
ment, especially because the team
performed at such a high level
without the services of Sandra
Birch.
Birch, the nation's top-ranked
player, has fully recovered from
the flu and will be back in action
for today's match. Her return also
brings stability back to No. 2 dou
bles, where the Birch-Graham
tandem is the equal of any second
doubles in the country.
Brennan said he is also thrilled
with the return to form of senior
captain Lisa Green. The three
time NCAA singles semifinalist
has put her early-season troubles
long behind her. "Lisa is playing
great tennis again," Brennan said.
"She's ready to move on and move
up."
All the good news could not

come at a better time for Stan
ford. Beginning with today's
showdown against cross-Bay rival
California, the Cardinal is enter
ing the point in the season where
there are no more gimmes.
The Golden Bears are ranked
seventh in college women's tennis.
Friday, No. 17 San Diego State
visits the Stanford Tennis Stadi
um. The next day, fifth-rated Pep
perdine brings its impressive
singles lineup to the Cardinal's
home turf.
While these upcoming matches
will test Stanford, the team's 42-
match winning streak should sur
vive unscathed — especially since
all three will be played here.
Brennan said he hopes some
people will come out to see the
consensus No. 1 team in action.
Meredith McGrath, who filled
in admirably for Birch over the
weekend, has used her dazzling
serve-and-volley game to con
found her collegiate opponents.
She has yet to drop a dual match.
Heather Willens, Stanford's No. 6
player, has also impressed so far.
The coach said before the
season he may have his strongest
singles lineup. So far, nothing has
happened to change that opinion.
From one through six, the Car
dinal has players who are among
the top handful in their respective
spots — if not the best overall.
In doubles as well, Stanford has
strength and more strength.
McGrath and Teri Whitlinger had
not played together in some time.
When they were needed at Arizo
na, they came up big. That
McGrath-Whitlinger plays ahead
of Birch-Graham, finalists in last
years NCAA Doubles Champion
ship, speaks volumes about the
Cardinal's depth.
