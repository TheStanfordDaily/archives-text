Ruggers remain undefeated
Despite extremely adverse weather
conditions, the Stanford rugby team
dominated UC-Davis on Saturday,
beating the Aggies 19-0 to bring their
league record to 6-0.
While the thermometer only reached
39 degrees, the ruggers fought their bat
tle on a water-soaked field under a
downpour. Both teams, mud-coated and
shivering, were forced to play sloppy
rugby as handling the ball became al
most impossible.
Coach Franck Boivert was pleased
with the win, since such weather con
ditions tend to neutralize a dominant

team's advantage. "Although the rain
did not allow us to play the type of
rugby that I would have liked, the
players adapted well to the conditions,
played tough defense, and capitilized on
all opportunities," Boivert said.
"With the field so covered in mud
and water," he continued, "it's very dif
ficult to move the ball offensively, which
has been our strength in weeks past;
As a result, we had to rely on both the
team and individuals to take advantage
of any chance to score — this we did."
Outstanding individual efforts by i
senior Rob Englehardt and junior Simon
Fleming-Wood demoralized the Aggies.
Englehardt single-handedly blocked a
kick, recovered the ball and scored a
try. Fleming-Wood, scoring 11 of the
Cardinal's 19 points, was instrumental
in creating an opportunity for Jason

Bucha to score his second try of the
season.
Despite its membership in perhaps
the toughest league in the nation, the
Cardinal remains undefeated, having
outscored its opponents 151-27 in its
first six matches. The ruggers will host
St. Mary's College this Sunday at 11
a.m. in the soccer stadium.
Frisbee wins six straight
In the first tournament of the
season, best characterized by shifting
winds and torrential rains, the Stanford
men's ultimate frisbee team defeated six
straight opponents — including defend
ing national champion UC-Santa Bar
bara — en route to a first place finish
at the UC-San Diego Winter Collegiate

Ultimate Invitational.
The Cardinal is now 17-1 and arguably
the top team in the nation, having
beaten all the top schools in the western
region, which usually boasts the na
tional champion.
The two-day tournament began with
a round robin, the results determining
the seedings for the next day's single
elimination competition.
The Cardinal went 3-0 on Saturday,
with their toughest match against Cal
ifornia, who was seeded ahead of Stan
ford before the weekend began. On
Sunday, Stanford defeated two more
teams to meet the Bears again in the
finals, where the Cardinal won easily
13- 11.
With such strong gusts, the team
going with the wind had a distinct ad
vantage in scoring. To equalize this fac-

tor, the teams switched ends of the field
after every score.
The victory against the Banana Slugs
was especially encouraging because the
Cardinal came back from a 11-9 deficit
to win 13-11 against a team that they
feel will give them the toughest compe
tition for the national title.
Junior Josh Hon and fifth-year senior
Mike Novotny, co-captains for the team,
commented on the weekend.
"At first we thought the bad weather
would inhibit our play, but after the
first couple games, we realized the poor
conditions were inspiring us to play even
harder," Novotny said.
"Before we went down to San Diego,
we knew we had the makings of a good
team," Hon summarized, "but we had
yet to face the likes of a national power
house such as UC-Santa Cruz.
