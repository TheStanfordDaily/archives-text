SWOPSI class calls
for safer campus
In an attempt to reduce
sexual assault on campus, 24
women in the SWOPSI 173
class "Self Defense for Women"
have called on the University
for immediate preventative ac
tion.
The women are currently cir
culating a petition that de
mands that the University
adopt and publicize a written
policy defining and condemn
ing rape, offers free self-defense
classes and creates a safer
campus environment through
increased outdoor lighting and
dorm security.
More specific proposals have
yet to be formulated, but the
students hope to meet with
University President Donald
Kennedy to discuss their de
mands.
According to class member
Susan Epstein, a junior, the
group is focusing on rape pre
vention and not rape prosecu
tion because rape prevention is
their area of expertise.
The group commended the
action of the University Task
Force on Sexual Assault, which
will meet through November,
as a "good start" but said more
student input and quicker
results are necessary.
Tasha Castaneda — a stu
dent representative to the Fac
ulty Senate whose request that
all women have the opportu

nity to take self defense classes
yielded the creation of another
section of the SWOPSI class
— is also involved with the
group.

Role in Nicaraguan
elections debated
Amid barbs concerning the
Hoover Institiution and per
sonal friendships with
Nicaraguan Uno leader Arturo
Cruz, scholars debated the role
of the United States in the up
coming Nicaraguan election.
Scott Littlehale of the Coun
cil on Hemispheric Affairs in
Washington, D.C., Mary Trew
of the local Nicaragua
Solidarity Coalition and
William Ratliff of Hoover dis
cussed perspectives on democ
racy, the Contra connection
and U.S. aid to the opposition
party, among other issues, in
a debate last night in Kresge
Auditorium. The debate was
moderated by Political Science
Prof. John Manley.
The forum, entitled
"Stabilizing or Destabilizing
Democracy: U.S. Policy and the
Nicaraguan Elections" was
sponsored by SWOPSI and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau,
among others. It was the action
project of a fall SWOPSI
course.
