## Students who skipped court dates in 1989 given a second chance to appear

Wanted: Procrastinating Stan
ford students who have missed
their day in court.
Last year, an unusually high
percentage of students failed to
appear in court for such mis
demeanors as shoplifting and pos
session of alcohol, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. The police, however,
have decided to give them one
more chance.
Although 17 shoplifters were
apprehended in 1989, most at the
Bookstore, 14 did not keep their
court appointments, a non
compliance rate of 82 percent.

Among 91 other misdemeanors,
including possession of alcohol by
a minor, 22 bench warrants were
assigned, a rate of 24 percent.
A judge issues a bench warrant
demanding a second appearance
in court when a defendant is not
present. A bench warrant can only
be cleared if the defendant is
booked.
"I was very surprised to see
such a high degree of non
compliance, especially on the
shoplifting cases. It is very unus
ual," said Niemeyer.
The usual rate of non
compliance for misdemeanors at
Stanford is about 10 to 15 percent,
Niemeyer estimated. A San Jose

police sergeant estimated a 20 per
cent non-compliance rate for mis
demeanors in his city.
The Stanford Police have
decided to give offenders one more
chance to turn themselves in, ac
cording to Niemeyer. Rather than
serving warrants, the department
will soon call students who missed
their court dates in order to advise
them to book themselves and ar
range for a second date for trial.
If a student fails to comply or
misses the second court date, the
San Jose sheriffs office will enter
the name in a police computer.
The police will then have the au
thority to arrest and incarcerate
the offender.
"We believe we'll have more

compliance if we have more
awareness," said Niemeyer about
the plan to give students another
chance.
"My gut feeling is that
[students] have other priorites
and forget about it. They make a
few phone calls too late, and some
decide to lay low until school is
out," said Niemeyer.
Students with outstanding war
rants are often arrested when
stopped for other violations, said
Niemeyer. And since an unat
tended warrant stays in the state's
computer forever, for out-of-state
students "it is something which
could ruin a nice vacation 20 years
from now."
