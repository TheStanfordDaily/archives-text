# Multicultural grad dorm proposed

The United Graduate Student Alli
ance will present a proposal for a mul
ticultural theme house to the Graduate
Housing Advisory Committee today for
approval.
The proposed house, which the alli
ance would like to see open next year,
would be organized along the lines of
undergraduate ethnic theme houses but
would feature programs and support
for a variety of ethnic groups.
"We hope that the house will help
graduate students of color feel grounded
in their community and will alleviate
feelings of alienation that might arise
from being an underrepresented group
in the classroom as well as in a housing
situation," said Lisa Richardson, a
member of the alliance.

Senior David Rimer, an ASSU senator
who has been working with the graduate
students on this issue, noted that "the
[enrollment] retention rate for graduate
students of color is much lower than
the [enrollment] retention rate for white
graduate students." A house concerned
with multicultural issues would help
address this problem, he said.
Richardson said, "We're hoping it will
attract more students of color to Stan
ford's graduate program. If it gets
passed, it will be a real feather in Stan
ford's cap, showing that it's really con
cerned about the needs of minority grad
uate students."
Rimer said that as far as he knows,
no other university has this type of
proposed housing alternative for grad
uate students.
However, Rimer fears that if approval
for the multicultural graduate theme

house does not come soon, it will be
too late for arrangements to he made
for the house to become a reality next
year, and another class of students will
have to do without its services.
The United Graduate Student Alli
ance, composed of members of the Asian
American, Black, Chicano and Native
American Graduate Student Associa
tions, has been working for two years
to create this house.
The Alliance has just sent out a ques
tionnaire to an equal number of white
students and students of color to deter
mine the need for the multicultural
theme house.
Director of graduate residences Jean
Kim, who must approve the plan, said
she felt the multicultural house was "a
good idea," but the house would have
to be organized so that "it's useful and
supportive and fair to all."
