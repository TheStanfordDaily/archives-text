Outside, the rain poured down.
Why, pray tell, would these people
subject themselves to this abuse?
Money? Fame? Sex?
As far as the money and fame
goes, probably not. The sex? Well,
you had better talk to Robert Tul
lis about that. Why Robert? Be
cause it was for his graduate
thesis film, "A Family Outing To
Jesusland," that these hardy souls
endured the wilds of Idaho.
Established in 1960, the De
partment of Communication's
documentary production program
focuses on training students to
become independent filmmakers.
During the course of the master's
program, the students explore the
technical aspects of documen
taries in addition to writing and

directing.
Only a dozen applicants are ad
mitted into the program each year.
The reason for keeping the num
ber of students small lies in the
fact chat there is not an "enor
mous need" for large numbers of
new filmmakers, according to pro
gram head Prof. Henry Breitrose.
Breitrose prefers to emphasize
quality over quantity, and this at
titude has paid a healthy dividend
to the program over the past few
years. The films produced in the
program have won a multitude of
prizes, including the Nissan Focus
Award for Best Student Documen
tary and several Student Academy
Achievement Awards for Docu
mentary from the Academy of Mo
tion Picture Arts and Sciences.
This year, Ellen Bruno will receive
an Academy of Television Arts
and Sciences Student Emmy
Award for Best Documentary.
Within the elite group of stu
dents that comprise the program
there are a breadth of projects.

"What this place has got," says
Breitrose, "is ideas."
The variety of subjects the stu
dents put to film confirms
Breitrose's statement. Bruno's
"Samsara" deals with the search
for inner peace by the people of
war-torn Cambodia. On the other
end of the spectrum is Tullis's
fictional "A Family Outing To
Jesusland." Somewhere in be
tween sits Sue Marcoux's
self-reflexive documentary on
twins.
Set at the 13th annual twins
convention in Twinsburg, Ohio,
Marcoux's film investigates the
special relationships between
twins, from dressing alike to
feeling sad after the death of one
of the pair. Herself a twin, Mar
coux's film grew out of her efforts
to reestablish a close relationship
with her sister

film "Roger and Me," Marcoux
frequently appears in front of the
camera.
The twins convention attracted
her because of its Midwest setting
and sense of Americana. In addi
tion to being about twins, the film
is also about the "American desire
to be apart of a group."
Stanford provides no direct
financing for the thesis films. The
positive side to this policy,
Breitrose points out, is that the
students own the copyrights to
their films, and each have the
opportunity to write and direct a
thesis film of their own.
In contrast, the USC film school
finances between six to eight films
per 60 students and retains the
copyright. Generally, the films
produced at Stanford cost between
$15,000 and $30,000. The stu
dents finance their projects by
either seeking foundation grants
or by coming up with the money
themselves.
Tullis's "A Family Outing To
Jesusland" relied upon self
financing. What makes the film
unique is that it is one of the last
fiction films that will be produced
under the auspices of the pro
gram. Shot over a 16-day period
in Idaho last August, it is episodic
in structure and concerns a fish
ing trip a family takes after the
mother dies. The film will run
between 20 and 25 minutes and
is peppered with numerous
literary and religious references.
He chose to do a fiction film
after realizing at the end of his
first year in the program that he
was more "interested in combin
ing documentary-like things into
fiction films."
Now in the final stages of his
involvement with the program,
Tullis believes one of its strongest
features is the closeness among
the students. Grades are not em
phasized and everyone acts as
crew members for other projects.
"I think that it's the beauty of
the program," reflects Tullis,
"that it's cooperative and not com
petitive."

The twins convention attracted
her because of its Midwest setting
and sense of Americana. In addi
tion to being about twins, the film
is also about the "American desire

Stanford provides no direct
financing for the thesis films. The
positive side to this policy,
Breitrose points out, is that the
students own the copyrights to
their films, and each have the
opportunity to write and direct a
thesis film of their own.
In contrast, the USC film school
finances between six to eight films
per 60 students and retains the
copyright. Generally, the films
produced at Stanford cost between
$15,000 and $30,000. The stu
dents finance their projects by
either seeking foundation grants
or by coming up with the money
themselves.
Tullis's "A Family Outing To
Jesusland" relied upon self
financing. What makes the film
unique is that it is one of the last
fiction films that will be produced
under the auspices of the pro
gram. Shot over a 16-day period
in Idaho last August, it is episodic
in structure and concerns a fish
ing trip a family takes after the
mother dies. The film will run
between 20 and 25 minutes and
is peppered with numerous
literary and religious references.
He chose to do a fiction film
after realizing at the end of his
first year in the program that he
was more "interested in combin
ing documentary-like things into
fiction films."
Now in the final stages of his
involvement with the program,
Tullis believes one of its strongest
features is the closeness among
the students. Grades are not em
phasized and everyone acts as
crew members for other projects.
"I think that it's the beauty of
the program," reflects Tullis,
"that it's cooperative and not com
petitive."
Inside the ice cave, the cast and

Outside, the rain poured down.
Why, pray tell, would these people
subject themselves to this abuse?
Money? Fame? Sex?
As far as the money and fame
goes, probably not. The sex? Well,
you had better talk to Robert Tul
lis about that. Why Robert? Be
cause it was for his graduate
thesis film, "A Family Outing To
Jesusland," that these hardy souls
endured the wilds of Idaho.
Established in 1960, the De
partment of Communication's
documentary production program
focuses on training students to
become independent filmmakers.
During the course of the master's
program, the students explore the
technical aspects of documen
taries in addition to writing and

directing.
Only a dozen applicants are ad
mitted into the program each year.
The reason for keeping the num
ber of students small lies in the
fact chat there is not an "enor
mous need" for large numbers of
new filmmakers, according to pro
gram head Prof. Henry Breitrose.
Breitrose prefers to emphasize
quality over quantity, and this at
titude has paid a healthy dividend
to the program over the past few
years. The films produced in the
program have won a multitude of
prizes, including the Nissan Focus
Award for Best Student Documen
tary and several Student Academy
Achievement Awards for Docu
mentary from the Academy of Mo
tion Picture Arts and Sciences.
This year, Ellen Bruno will receive
an Academy of Television Arts
and Sciences Student Emmy
Award for Best Documentary.
Within the elite group of stu
dents that comprise the program
there are a breadth of projects.

"What this place has got," says
Breitrose, "is ideas."
The variety of subjects the stu
dents put to film confirms
Breitrose's statement. Bruno's
"Samsara" deals with the search
for inner peace by the people of
war-torn Cambodia. On the other
end of the spectrum is Tullis's
fictional "A Family Outing To
Jesusland." Somewhere in be
tween sits Sue Marcoux's
self-reflexive documentary on
twins.
Set at the 13th annual twins
convention in Twinsburg, Ohio,
Marcoux's film investigates the
special relationships between
twins, from dressing alike to
feeling sad after the death of one
of the pair. Herself a twin, Mar
