Inside the ice cave, the cast and
crew shivered. The temperature
hovered around 28 degrees Cel
sius.
Outside, the rain poured down.
Why, pray tell, would these people
subject themselves to this abuse?
Money? Fame? Sex?
As far as the money and fame
goes, probably not. The sex? Well,
you had better talk to Robert Tul
lis about that. Why Robert? Be
cause it was for his graduate
thesis film, "A Family Outing To
Jesusland," that these hardy souls
endured the wilds of Idaho.
Established in 1960, the De
partment of Communication's
documentary production program
focuses on training students to
become independent filmmakers.
During the course of the master's
program, the students explore the
technical aspects of documen
taries in addition to writing and

directing.
Only a dozen applicants are ad
mitted into the program each year.
The reason for keeping the num
ber of students small lies in the
fact chat there is not an "enor
mous need" for large numbers of
new filmmakers, according to pro
gram head Prof. Henry Breitrose.
Breitrose prefers to emphasize
quality over quantity, and this at
titude has paid a healthy dividend
to the program over the past few
years. The films produced in the
program have won a multitude of
prizes, including the Nissan Focus
Award for Best Student Documen
tary and several Student Academy
Achievement Awards for Docu
mentary from the Academy of Mo
tion Picture Arts and Sciences.
This year, Ellen Bruno will receive
an Academy of Television Arts
and Sciences Student Emmy
Award for Best Documentary.
Within the elite group of stu
dents that comprise the program
there are a breadth of projects.

"What this place has got," says
Breitrose, "is ideas."
The variety of subjects the stu
dents put to film confirms
Breitrose's statement. Bruno's
"Samsara" deals with the search
for inner peace by the people of
war-torn Cambodia. On the other
end of the spectrum is Tullis's
fictional "A Family Outing To
Jesusland." Somewhere in be
tween sits Sue Marcoux's
self-reflexive documentary on
twins.
Set at the 13th annual twins
convention in Twinsburg, Ohio,
Marcoux's film investigates the
special relationships between
twins, from dressing alike to
feeling sad after the death of one
of the pair. Herself a twin, Mar
coux's film grew out of her efforts
to reestablish a close relationship
with her sister

Robert Tulhs is one of the few students In the Communication Department's documentary production
program. His thesis film, A Family Outing to Jesusland," is one of the last works of fiction that will
be produced under the auspices of the program.
