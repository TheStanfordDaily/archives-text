# Local volunteers hard at work to give the Earth its Day
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
In a small office building in
downtown Palo Alto, flanked by
the Good Earth and Burger King,
staffers and volunteers are work
ing around the clock to make
Earth Day 1990 a reality.
On April 22, people all over the
globe will join together to cele
brate the Earth, focusing inter
national attention on
environmental problems and pos
sible solutions. And the world
headquarters in Palo Alto is the
lifeblood of that effort.
What is Earth Day? What is it
all about? Earth Day is about
building coalitions between
groups who are working to solve
environmental problems. It is ,
about getting people involved,
is about action.
"The whole point of Earth Day
is to get to people who are hard
to get to and shake them up,"

explained. "We are* mobilizing
people around a focal poMt; Earth
Day is just the focal poiW\Ouj|/'

Earth Day 1990 traces its rootS||
back to 1969, when Denis Hayes
dropped out of Harvard Law
School to organize the first Earth
Day held in 1970.
That event helped to launch the
modern environmental movement
and led directly to such changes
as passage of the Clean Air Act,
passage of the Clean Water Act
and creation of the Environmental
Protection Agency. On that one
day in 1970, as many as 20 million
people joined together to raise
awareness about the environment.
After the first Earth Day, Hayes
founded Environmental Action
and became one of the nation's
foremost environmental lobbyists.
"But this Earth Day is not
about founding a new organiza
tion," Kos said. "It is about
coalition-building and working
with existing groups."
In late 1987, Hayes began
talking with leaders of meyor en

vironmental organizations and
testing the water to see if they
would be interested in having an
other Earth Day. They were. And,
in April 1988, the Palo Alto office
was set up to coordinate efforts

because, according to McGlashah\
with English, French and'

But, in many Third World coun
tries, it is hard to find money to
support an Earth Day event. In
Eastern Europe, it is hard to find
paper to advertise events. But
McGlashan said the Earth Day
office does not offer any money

to people who want to put on
events.
"We offer moral support and
advice," McGlashan said. "But we
won't be able to give them money
afterwards, so we don't offer

Mark Mobley and Licia Dorosin, i
two of the three national coordi- '
nators, are each responsible for 1
about 17 states. They stay in con- \
tact with people who are planning j
Earth Day events around the na
tion. c
Mobley also coordinates the c

merchandizing of Earth Day 1990
products.
"The products help to get the
word out," Mobley said. "People
can get T-shirts and pins at
wholesale prices and sell them to
raise funds for Earth Day events."
"Many people across the coun
try are putting on eco-fairs," he
said. "In Louisiana, people will
march to the Mississippi River
and pour buckets of clean water
into the polluted river to symboli
cally 'cleanse' it. Afterwards,
there will be an eco-fair and a
concert."
"I hope that unfathomable
changes will follow Earth Day
1990," Mobley said.
He envisions several changes:
•A complete ban on
. chlorofluorocarbons in five years;
legislation on
action on global
overpopulation;
renewable energy
all aspects of life;
to protect endangered
things can happen
/<yTien people demonstrate,"
/'Mobley said. "Politicians will
stand up and take notice."
According to Mobley, about 250
communities, including many
msyor cities, are planning Earth
Day events.
Morosin, who graduated from
Stanford in 1987, said she enjoys
getting to know the people in local
communities who are planning
Earth Day events.
"Craig Grabow in Hammond,
Ind., is one of my favorite people,"
Dorosin said. "He is planning a
weekend conference for high
school students so they can go
teach elementary school students
about environmental issues.
That's planning for the future,
because they will be the ones who
will be dealing with most of the
problems."
Although on Earth Day itself
organizers hope that all members
of local communities will band to

gether to participate in events, co
ordinators in the Palo Alto office
are currently targeting univer
sities around the nation sepa
rately.
So far, Earth Day organizers
have reached out to about 1,000
of the 3,300 colleges in the United
States. Over the next month, stu
dents at these colleges will be hold
ing conferences where they will
focus on environmental issues in
their communities and plan Earth
Day events.
Beth Delson, Earth Day campus
coordinator, said the office is
focusing on students in hopes of
strengthening the environmental
movement beyond Earth Day it
self.
"Students are a very large,
potent force whose efforts should
be integrated with the efforts of
the rest of the community," Del
son explained.
To stir up student involvement,
Delson and her co-workers are
asking students around the coun
try to fill out Campus
Environmental Audits and send
them back into the Palo Alto of
fice. These audits assess the
damage that universities do to the
environment. The data will be col
lected and released as soon as it

is available with a recommenda
tion for action.
Delson has been working to help
different student groups form
coalitions. In this area, there will
be a meeting tonight at 6 p.m. at
UC-Berkeley for interested stu
dents.
Another part of the push to
make Earth Day more than just
a one-day event is the Green
Pledge. Coordinators are encour
aging everyone to take a pledge
to treat the environment more
responsibly.
For example, Kos pointed to the
15-watt fluorescent lightbulb he
learned about in a book called "50
Simple Things You Can Do to
Save the Earth" and said: "That
lightbulb gives out the same
amount of illumination as a 60-
watt incandescent bulb. It costs a
little bit more but, by using it,
I'm stopping half a ton of carbon
dioxide from going into the at
mosphere. That's something con
crete and something everyone can
do."
An essay by Denis Hayes in the
first Earth Day newsletter is en
titled "Who Says You Can't
Change the World?" and you can
feel it when you go into the Earth
Day 1990 office. Everyone there
believes they can.

Mobley also coordinates the c

products.
"The products help to get the

can get T-shirts and pins at

raise funds for Earth Day events."
"Many people across the coun
try are putting on eco-fairs," he
said. "In Louisiana, people will
march to the Mississippi River
and pour buckets of clean water
into the polluted river to symboli
cally 'cleanse' it. Afterwards,
there will be an eco-fair and a
concert."
"I hope that unfathomable

1990," Mobley said.
He envisions several changes:

According to Mobley, about 250
communities, including many
msyor cities, are planning Earth
Day events.
Morosin, who graduated from
Stanford in 1987, said she enjoys
getting to know the people in local
communities who are planning
Earth Day events.
"Craig Grabow in Hammond,
Ind., is one of my favorite people,"
Dorosin said. "He is planning a
weekend conference for high
school students so they can go
teach elementary school students
about environmental issues.
That's planning for the future,
because they will be the ones who
will be dealing with most of the
problems."
Although on Earth Day itself
organizers hope that all members
of local communities will band to

gether to participate in events, co
ordinators in the Palo Alto office
are currently targeting univer
sities around the nation sepa
rately.
So far, Earth Day organizers
have reached out to about 1,000
of the 3,300 colleges in the United
States. Over the next month, stu
dents at these colleges will be hold
ing conferences where they will
focus on environmental issues in
their communities and plan Earth
Day events.
Beth Delson, Earth Day campus
coordinator, said the office is
focusing on students in hopes of
strengthening the environmental
movement beyond Earth Day it
self.
"Students are a very large,
potent force whose efforts should
be integrated with the efforts of
the rest of the community," Del
son explained.
To stir up student involvement,
Delson and her co-workers are
asking students around the coun
try to fill out Campus
Environmental Audits and send
them back into the Palo Alto of
fice. These audits assess the
damage that universities do to the
environment. The data will be col
lected and released as soon as it

is available with a recommenda
tion for action.
Delson has been working to help
different student groups form
coalitions. In this area, there will
be a meeting tonight at 6 p.m. at
UC-Berkeley for interested stu
dents.
Another part of the push to
make Earth Day more than just
a one-day event is the Green
Pledge. Coordinators are encour
aging everyone to take a pledge
to treat the environment more
responsibly.
For example, Kos pointed to the
15-watt fluorescent lightbulb he
learned about in a book called "50
Simple Things You Can Do to
Save the Earth" and said: "That
lightbulb gives out the same
amount of illumination as a 60-
watt incandescent bulb. It costs a
little bit more but, by using it,
I'm stopping half a ton of carbon
dioxide from going into the at
mosphere. That's something con
crete and something everyone can
do."
An essay by Denis Hayes in the
first Earth Day newsletter is en
titled "Who Says You Can't
Change the World?" and you can
feel it when you go into the Earth
Day 1990 office. Everyone there
believes they can.

In a small office building in
downtown Palo Alto, flanked by
the Good Earth and Burger King,
staffers and volunteers are work
ing around the clock to make
Earth Day 1990 a reality.
On April 22, people all over the
globe will join together to cele
brate the Earth, focusing inter
national attention on
environmental problems and pos
sible solutions. And the world
headquarters in Palo Alto is the
lifeblood of that effort.
What is Earth Day? What is it
all about? Earth Day is about
building coalitions between
groups who are working to solve
environmental problems. It is ,
about getting people involved,
is about action.

is to get to people who are hard
to get to and shake them up,"

Earth Day 1990 traces its rootS||
back to 1969, when Denis Hayes
dropped out of Harvard Law
School to organize the first Earth
Day held in 1970.
That event helped to launch the
modern environmental movement
and led directly to such changes
as passage of the Clean Air Act,
passage of the Clean Water Act
and creation of the Environmental
Protection Agency. On that one
day in 1970, as many as 20 million
people joined together to raise
awareness about the environment.
After the first Earth Day, Hayes
founded Environmental Action
and became one of the nation's
foremost environmental lobbyists.
"But this Earth Day is not
about founding a new organiza
tion," Kos said. "It is about
coalition-building and working
with existing groups."
In late 1987, Hayes began
talking with leaders of meyor en

vironmental organizations and

Mobley also coordinates the c

products.
"The products help to get the

can get T-shirts and pins at

"Many people across the coun

said. "In Louisiana, people will
march to the Mississippi River
and pour buckets of clean water
into the polluted river to symboli
cally 'cleanse' it. Afterwards,
there will be an eco-fair and a
concert."
"I hope that unfathomable
changes will follow Earth Day
1990," Mobley said.
He envisions several changes:

legislation on
action on global

According to Mobley, about 250
communities, including many
msyor cities, are planning Earth
Day events.
Morosin, who graduated from
Stanford in 1987, said she enjoys
getting to know the people in local
communities who are planning
Earth Day events.
"Craig Grabow in Hammond,
Ind., is one of my favorite people,"
Dorosin said. "He is planning a
weekend conference for high
school students so they can go
teach elementary school students
about environmental issues.
That's planning for the future,
because they will be the ones who
will be dealing with most of the
problems."
Although on Earth Day itself
organizers hope that all members
of local communities will band to

gether to participate in events, co
ordinators in the Palo Alto office
are currently targeting univer
sities around the nation sepa
rately.
So far, Earth Day organizers
have reached out to about 1,000
of the 3,300 colleges in the United
States. Over the next month, stu
dents at these colleges will be hold
ing conferences where they will
focus on environmental issues in
their communities and plan Earth
Day events.
Beth Delson, Earth Day campus
coordinator, said the office is
focusing on students in hopes of
strengthening the environmental
movement beyond Earth Day it
self.
"Students are a very large,
potent force whose efforts should
be integrated with the efforts of
the rest of the community," Del
son explained.
To stir up student involvement,
Delson and her co-workers are
asking students around the coun
try to fill out Campus
Environmental Audits and send
them back into the Palo Alto of
fice. These audits assess the
damage that universities do to the
environment. The data will be col
lected and released as soon as it

is available with a recommenda
tion for action.
Delson has been working to help
different student groups form
coalitions. In this area, there will
be a meeting tonight at 6 p.m. at
UC-Berkeley for interested stu
dents.
Another part of the push to
make Earth Day more than just
a one-day event is the Green
Pledge. Coordinators are encour
aging everyone to take a pledge
to treat the environment more
responsibly.
For example, Kos pointed to the
15-watt fluorescent lightbulb he
learned about in a book called "50
Simple Things You Can Do to
Save the Earth" and said: "That
lightbulb gives out the same
amount of illumination as a 60-
watt incandescent bulb. It costs a
little bit more but, by using it,
I'm stopping half a ton of carbon
dioxide from going into the at
mosphere. That's something con
crete and something everyone can
do."
An essay by Denis Hayes in the
first Earth Day newsletter is en
titled "Who Says You Can't
Change the World?" and you can
feel it when you go into the Earth
Day 1990 office. Everyone there
believes they can.

In a small office building in
downtown Palo Alto, flanked by
the Good Earth and Burger King,
staffers and volunteers are work
ing around the clock to make
Earth Day 1990 a reality.
On April 22, people all over the
globe will join together to cele
brate the Earth, focusing inter
national attention on
environmental problems and pos
sible solutions. And the world
headquarters in Palo Alto is the
lifeblood of that effort.
What is Earth Day? What is it
all about? Earth Day is about
building coalitions between
groups who are working to solve
environmental problems. It is ,
about getting people involved,
is about action.
"The whole point of Earth Day
is to get to people who are hard
to get to and shake them up,"
volunteer coordinate <3i"eg Kos
explained. "We are* mobilizing
people around a focal poMt; Earth
Day is just the focal poiW\Ouj|/'
real goal is to make the 1990b £P
green decade."
Earth Day 1990 traces its rootS||
back to 1969, when Denis Hayes
dropped out of Harvard Law
School to organize the first Earth
Day held in 1970.
That event helped to launch the
modern environmental movement
and led directly to such changes
as passage of the Clean Air Act,
passage of the Clean Water Act
and creation of the Environmental
Protection Agency. On that one
day in 1970, as many as 20 million
people joined together to raise
awareness about the environment.
After the first Earth Day, Hayes
founded Environmental Action
and became one of the nation's
foremost environmental lobbyists.
"But this Earth Day is not
about founding a new organiza
tion," Kos said. "It is about
coalition-building and working
with existing groups."
In late 1987, Hayes began
talking with leaders of meyor en

vironmental organizations and
testing the water to see if they
would be interested in having an
other Earth Day. They were. And,
in April 1988, the Palo Alto office
was set up to coordinate efforts
for Earth Day 1990, which
time would be a worldwide even*

In reaching out to dlffersrit na
tions, McGlashan and her co
workers have faced seyeral
obstacles. The language
has not been much of a problem
because, according to McGlashah\
with English, French and'
Spanish, you can go a long way.
But, in many Third World coun
tries, it is hard to find money to
support an Earth Day event. In
Eastern Europe, it is hard to find
paper to advertise events. But
McGlashan said the Earth Day
office does not offer any money

to people who want to put on
events.
"We offer moral support and
advice," McGlashan said. "But we
won't be able to give them money
afterwards, so we don't offer
money now."
