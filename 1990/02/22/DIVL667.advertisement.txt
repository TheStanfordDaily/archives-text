Super people,
Super market.
"Palo Alto had been without
a downtown supermarket
for a long time, so I was very
pleased when Whole Foods
Market decided to open here
last year. I think the store has
filled a real need in our
community. The quality of
the food is excellent, and the
environment is attractive
and inviting. My wife and I
really like going in there. It's
an exciting place to be."
-Larry Klein
Attorney at Law
