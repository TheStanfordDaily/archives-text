# Committee pushing for ethnic, gender courses
## New distribution requirements may result 
### Edward Mun 
Undergraduates now face the possibility
of new distribution requirements focusing
on ethnicity, gender and non-Western cul
tures, as a University committee is cur
rently wrestling with alternative routes for
change.
The Subcommittee on Distribution Re
quirements submitted a report to the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies in the
fall presenting reasons for making courses
on ethnicity, gender and non-Western cul
tures mandatory. The report also suggested
two approaches to changing the distribu
tion requirements.
The committee is now working on writ
ing a recommendation based on the report
and hopes the Faculty Senate will vote on
the proposal in the spring. If adopted,

changes in the system of distribution re
quirements could take several years to im
plement.
In response to the growing number of
people of color in the United States and
the changing roles of gender, the Subcom
mittee on Distribution Requirements stated
in its report that "a substantial effort needs
to be undertaken to include more attention
to race, ethnicity and gender in the under
graduate curriculum."
The subcommittee is made up of nine
professors, three administrators and one
student.
Their report defined ethnic studies as
the study of "the American ethnic experi
ence as a whole." The experiences of Irish-
Americans and Jewish-Americans, for
example, would qualify as well as
those of blacks, Asian-Americans,
Latinos and Native Americans.
According to the report, gender
studies would focus on issues of
gender definition, gender roles,
sexual relations and sexual iden
tity. It would not be limited to
"women's studies" courses.
The report recommended the
number of distribution require
ments remain at eight and that
Area One (Cultures, Ideas and
Values), Area Six (Mathematical
Sciences), Area Seven (Natural
Sciences) and Area Eight
(Technology and Applied Science)
remain essentially unchanged.
It also suggested that the non-
Western requirement be elevated
from its current "asterisked"
status — where it can be satisfied
by a course that is simultaneously
satsifying a distribution require
ment — and become its own dis
tribution requirement called
"World Cultures."
The main problem, according
to the report and members of the
Faculty Senate, is how to bring
these changes into the undergrad

uate program while keeping the
number of requirements the
same. According to Education
Professor Denis Phillips, a mem
ber of the senate, many members
of the senate are "for the princi
ple, but it's how they do it that
is the main problem."
The report offered two options
for the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies to consider.
The first option suggests that
the eight distribution require
ments remain unchanged and the
"World Cultures" requirement be
added to the list. The CIV re
quirement would simultaneously
fulfill one of Areas Two through
Six, as well as Area One.
As for the ethnic and gender
issues, the first option suggested
that all courses satisfying a dis
tribution requirement would be
required to include material on
race, ethnicity and/or gender
"where appropriate."
The second option has two
phases: an interim phase for ob
taining funds and faculty for eth
nic studies courses and a final
phase in which an ethnic studies
distribution requirment could
"stand on its own."
During the interim phase, the
"World Cultures" requirement

and a requirement on ethnic
and/or gender issues would be
added. Areas Two (Literature and
Fine Arts) and Three
(Philosophical, Social and Reli
gious Thought) would be com
bined into one area, as would
Areas Four (Human Development,
Behavior and Language) and Five
(Social Processes and Institu
tions).
In the final phase, gender
studies would become a require
ment that could be fulfilled within
the other areas, much like the
non-Western requirement is ful
filled now. Ethnic studies would
remain its own requirement.
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies came up with an out
line of yet another option during
its meeting last Friday. Because
the committee members are still
working on the new option, His
tory Prof. Peter Duus, chair of
the committee, was unable to
comment on the new option.
Outside the Faculty Senate, the
ASSU Committee on Democracy
in Education is working to bring
information about the ethnic
studies requirement to student
residences and find out what stu
dents think about having such a
requirement.

gender definition, gender roles,
sexual relations and sexual iden
tity. It would not be limited to
"women's studies" courses.
The report recommended the
number of distribution require
ments remain at eight and that
Area One (Cultures, Ideas and
Values), Area Six (Mathematical
Sciences), Area Seven (Natural
Sciences) and Area Eight
(Technology and Applied Science)
remain essentially unchanged.
It also suggested that the non-
Western requirement be elevated
from its current "asterisked"
status — where it can be satisfied
by a course that is simultaneously
satsifying a distribution require
ment — and become its own dis
tribution requirement called
"World Cultures."
The main problem, according
to the report and members of the
Faculty Senate, is how to bring
these changes into the undergrad

uate program while keeping the
number of requirements the
same. According to Education
Professor Denis Phillips, a mem
ber of the senate, many members
of the senate are "for the princi
ple, but it's how they do it that
is the main problem."
The report offered two options
for the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies to consider.
The first option suggests that
the eight distribution require
ments remain unchanged and the
"World Cultures" requirement be
added to the list. The CIV re
quirement would simultaneously
fulfill one of Areas Two through
Six, as well as Area One.
As for the ethnic and gender
issues, the first option suggested
that all courses satisfying a dis
tribution requirement would be
required to include material on
race, ethnicity and/or gender
"where appropriate."
The second option has two
phases: an interim phase for ob
taining funds and faculty for eth
nic studies courses and a final
phase in which an ethnic studies
distribution requirment could
"stand on its own."
During the interim phase, the
"World Cultures" requirement

and a requirement on ethnic
and/or gender issues would be
added. Areas Two (Literature and
Fine Arts) and Three
(Philosophical, Social and Reli
gious Thought) would be com
bined into one area, as would
Areas Four (Human Development,
Behavior and Language) and Five
(Social Processes and Institu
tions).
In the final phase, gender
studies would become a require
ment that could be fulfilled within
the other areas, much like the
non-Western requirement is ful
filled now. Ethnic studies would
remain its own requirement.
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies came up with an out
line of yet another option during
its meeting last Friday. Because
the committee members are still
working on the new option, His
tory Prof. Peter Duus, chair of
the committee, was unable to
comment on the new option.
Outside the Faculty Senate, the
ASSU Committee on Democracy
in Education is working to bring
information about the ethnic
studies requirement to student
residences and find out what stu
dents think about having such a
requirement.
