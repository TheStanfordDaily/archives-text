# Agency helps disabled find work
## 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Affirmative action at Stan
ford received a boost this year
through the use of a temporary
employment agency that hires
only individuals with dis
abilities.
The agency, Hire Temps, is a
division of Project Hired, a non
profit organization which at
tempts to find employment for
disabled individuals. Approxi
mately two-thirds of disabled
people in the United States want
to work but cannot find jobs,
according to Mary Eicher, an
employment specialist at
Hire Temps.
Stanford's use of Hire Temps
began when Patrick Burns,
procurement operations mana
ger for the University, learned
about the agency last spring. He
visited the agency's offices in
Sunnyvale and was "very im
pressed." Stanford consequently
offered a contract to Hire Temps
this fall.
Burns said that "a few" dis
abled employees have come to
Stanford through Hire Temps
this year and that "every one
has turned out to be great. [The

Stanford for temporary jobs, giving the
employees work experience and increasing
the diversity of Stanford's workforce.

employees arel very dedicated,
skilled, talented and eager," he
said.
Affirmative action officer
Cecilia Burciaga said she
believes Stanford's use of
Hire Temps is one way "to erad
icate prejudgments we make
about the disabled." She added
that having Hire Temps employ
ees aids in "bringing all kinds
of diversity" to Stanford.
Jan Cohen, executive director
of Project Hired, called Stan
ford's use of Hire Temps "a win
win situation. Everybody comes
out ahead." Stanford gets en
thusiastic temporary help, and
the employees get work experi
ence, she said.
Eicher said that the individ
uals who work with Hire Temps
have a wide range of disabilities
including visual impairment,
deafness, learning disabilities
and medical disabilities.

The jobs performed by the in
dividuals working for
Hire Temps vary widely. Individ
uals from Hire Temps have filled
positions covering a wide range,
including financial analyst, sec
retary and envelope stuffer, ac
cording to Eicher.
Cohen explained that employ
ers are often "scared off" by the
prospect of hiring disabled indi
viduals, but with temporary
help most companies are not as
intimidated.
About 15 companies in the
area currently use Hire Temps,
according to Cohen. These in
clude such large corporations as
Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equip
ment Corp. and General
Electric. Hire Temps now has ap
proximately 28 disabled individ
uals available for temporary
work but, Cohen said, "we hope
to grow."
