# Selling donated boats helps keep wind in the sailing team's sails

### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
For just $579,000, you can be the
owner of arguably the nicest sailboat on
San Francisco Bay.
Surprisingly, the seller of the boat is
not a millionaire but the Stanford sailing
program.
Over the past eight years, the sailing
program has sold about 125 donated
boats, according to Joe Petrucci, the pro
gram's director.
The business of boat sales has been a
boon to the program over the past few
years, but a gradual decrease in donations
may be leading to the end of the donation
program.
Both alumni and non-alumni have
donated the boats to the University, ac
cording to Petrucci, who founded the pro
gram and is currently in charge of the
sales and upkeep of the boats. Several
donors have given more than one boat,
and previous donors often refer other

boat owners to the Stanford program.
However, since the passage of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986, which restricted tax
deductions for charitable contributions,
there is less incentive for boat owners to
give their boats to Stanford, Petrucci
said.
"People can't afford to donate any
more" without the tax benefits, Petrucci
added.
All of the proceeds from the sales sup
port the sailing program, Petrucci said.
When enough money has been raised,
Petrucci hopes to build a permanent sail
ing center for Stanford in Redwood City.
Once the center is built, the sailing
program should be able to support itself
on income from membership dues,
Petrucci noted.
Most of the boats are located in various
parts of California, and Petrucci is re
sponsible for showing them to potential
buyers.
The flagship of the sailing program's
fleet is the $579,000 Victoria, a 72-foot

ketch, which Petrucci calls "one of a
kind."
Petrucci described the boat as having
"possibly the nicest interior of any boat
in the country." Among its many
amenities, the boat has a jacuzzi.
Petrucci said the boat, which will be
sold this spring, has sailed all over the
world, accumulating some 200,000 miles.
As of Feb. 1, nine boats were up for
sale. Besides the Victoria, Stanford is
selling a 1973 47-foot Garden ketch for
$99,000, a 1978 27-foot Sun for $19,000,
a 1978 20-foot Wilderness for $3,900 and
a variety of other boats in the 20- to
30-foot range.
Until the boats are sold, the sailing
program uses them for their weekly ex
cursions and for instruction, according
to Petrucci. A corps of volunteers helps
with the upkeep and maintenance of the
boats.
Petrucci said most of the boats are
sold directly to buyers, though some are
sold to yacht brokers. In many cases,

advertisements for boats are placed in
yachting magazines.
Not all of the buyers have been happy
with their purchases. Mary Scherer, 61,
filed suit against the University last sum
mer because she claimed she was never
informed about the rusty hull of a boat
she bought from the sailing program two
years ago.
In May 1987, Scherer, a resident of
Palo Alto, bought a 75-foot steel-hulled
Dutch river ferryboat for her retirement
for $90,000, according to Petrucci. Al
though the boat was built in 1923, it had
been rebuilt recently, he said.
A year later, when she went to inspect
the boat again, the boat's steel hull had
developed severe rusting problems, re
ducing its value, her lawsuit alleges. She
claims Stanford misrepresented the con
dition of the boat when she bought it.
University counsel Bob Fourr, who is
handling the case for the University,
denies that Stanford misrepresented the
condition of the boat. He said the boat

was sold "as-is" as part of the condition
of the sale, and Scherer was told of this
stipulation.
In general, all boat sales by the Uni
versity are made on an "as-is basis,"
Petrucci said.
"Scherer had every opportunity to in
spect the boat before she bought it,"he
added. In fact, Scherer went to France,
where the boat was docked, saw the boat
and even took a trip on it before she
bought it, Fourr noted.
Scherer refused to comment on her
case.
No trial date has been set for the case,
and Fourr said he predicts that, at the
earliest, it could come to trial some time
next year.
Fourr said he was not aware of any
previous lawsuits against Stanford over
boat sales.
Stanford alum Joan McNabb donated
the boat to Stanford after her husband
William died.
