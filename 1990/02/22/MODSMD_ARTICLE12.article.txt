IRA claims responsibility
LEICESTER, England (AP) — The Irish
Republican Army claimed responsibility yes
terday for a bombing near an army van in
the center of Leicester that shook buildings,
knocked down pedestrians and slightly injured
three people.
In a separate incident, a stone-throwing
crowd forced police officers to release five
people suspected of planning to attack an army
helicopter, authorities said yesterday. Three
suspects were recaptured later, however.
A forensic examination had established
"similarities" between Tuesday's bomb in
Leicester, 100 miles northwest of London, and
a device found after an unsuccessful attempt
to assassinate Lt. Gen. Sir David Ramsbotham
in London's fashionable Kensington district
on Nov. 14, said Assistant Chief Constable
Tony Butler.
Two killed in Romanian violence
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Two oppo
sition party activists were beaten to death and
the tongue of one victim was cut out by party
opponents, the traditionally anti-Communist
National Peasants Party alleged yesterday.
Peasants Party spokesman Valentin
Gabrielescu declined to make specific accusa
tions about who was behind the reported kil
lings, but suggested they were politically
motivated.
Three suspects have been arrested in the
Feb. 11 death and mutilation ofVasile Velescu,
Gabrielescu said, refusing to identify them or
their possible motives.
He said only that Velescu, 60, "was killed
because he was the chief of our organization"
in Bacau, 180 miles northeast of Bucharest.
Another party activist, from Calarasi County
in southern Romania, also was murdered,
Gabrielescu said. He refused to name the vic
tim or give further details, saying he was
following the wishes of the victim's family.
Poland requests postwar treaty
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki said yesterday a "peace
treaty" securing Poland's postwar western bor
der should precede German reunification and
Soviet troops should stay in Poland as insur
ance.
"We believe that a new stage of history
created by the reunification of Germany . . .
must not be entered with any ambiguity con
cerning Poland's western border," Mazowiecki
said at a rare news conference to emphasize
his demand that decisions affecting Poland's
security never again be made without its par
ticipation.
"We are demanding that before the
reunification, the total removal of these am
biguities must take place," he said.
Mazowiecki proposed that after East Ger
man elections in March, the two Germanys
and Poland initial a treaty, "corresponding
with a peace treaty," recognizing the post-
World War II borders, and that it be signed
finally by the government of a unified Ger
many.
France lifts nuclear ban
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) — France on
yesterday ended a 14-year ban on sales of
nuclear energy to Pakistan, announcing a com
mercial venture that would set up a nuclear
power plant in the country.
"France pledges to authorize French indus
trial enterprises ... to make rapidly a technical
and commercial offer for the sale of a nuclear
power plant to Pakistan," President Francois
Mitterrand told a news conference during a
four-day visit.
Mitterrand did not say how big the plant
would be.
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said a
French-supplied plant would be "open to all
international safeguards and monitoring
teams."
ANC calls boycott of talks
LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — The African Na
tional Congress said Tuesday it has lobbied
African governments to boycott proposed talks
with South African President F.W. de Klerk
scheduled for this weekend in Zaire.
The organization also urged European gov
ernments to ignore British calls to ease eco
nomic sanctions against South Africa.
Britain Tuesday failed to persuade the Eu
ropean Community to ease sanctions and said
it would act alone to remove a British embargo
on new investment.
De Klerk, in an effort to ease friction with
black states, is to meet Saturday in Zaire with
the leaders of that country, Rwanda, Burundi,
Chad and the African Central Republic to dis
cuss regional issues and political developments
in South Africa.
