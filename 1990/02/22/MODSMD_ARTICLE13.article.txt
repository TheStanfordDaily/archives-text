The last days
Younger supporters of the ruling Sandinista party in Nicaragua sit on a billboard bearing the likeness of
President Daniel Ortega. The clock is winding down toward national elections that are now four days away.
The official newspaper of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, Barricada, bore a large headline reading,
"Let's celebrate now!" and the Sandinistas yesterday conducted a huge campaign-closing rally which attracted
thousands of supporters.
