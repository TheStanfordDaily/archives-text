# Nepalese move toward pluralism

KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) - A
movement to restore political
pluralism has gripped this Himalayan
kingdom, pitting its Harvard-educated
monarch against two banned political
parties inspired by the changes sweep
ing Eastern Europe.
Clashes between police and demon
strators who demand an end to a 29-
year-old ban on political parties have
killed at least 11 people this week in
usually tranquil Nepal, where crime
is rare and murders make front-page
news.
Activists claim the government has
arrested more than 1,000 people in its

crackdown on the movement for res
toration of multiparty democracy. The
government says 175 people have been
arrested since the campaign was
launched Sunday â€” for the third time
in 11 years.
"I think this time the government
is shaken," said a Western diplomat
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"They have realized that bullets and
tough talk won't make the problem
disappear."
Leading the agitation are the banned
coalition of left-wing parties and the
Nepali Congress Party, which
governed Nepal during its only two

years in history as a Western-style
democracy.
Analysts say one reason the people
voted for a partyless democracy was
the assurance by King Birendra,
Mahendra's son, of greater political
freedom and genuine representation in
the assembly.
According to government figures,
life expectancy has risen from 38 years
in 1960 to 47 at present. About 70,000
Nepalese receive a university educa
tion.
Still, half the population lives in
poverty, with a per capita annual in
come of $150.
