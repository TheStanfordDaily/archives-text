# Soviet presidency reforms proposed

### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Soviet legislators
were given copies yesterday of pro
posed constitutional changes that
would make the presidency, now held
by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, much more
powerful.
Gorbachev has urged the Supreme
Soviet to approve the plan for a
Western-style presidential system of
government.
Vladimir Tumanov of the Institute
of State and Law in Moscow, who
helped draft the proposal, said copies
were distributed yesterday and the Su
preme Soviet held closed committee
meetings. Tumanov said he had not
seen the final version and could not
give details.
News reports said the changes would
provide for the president to be elected
to terms of either five or six years
and give him the power to veto legis
lation, which could be overriden.
According to the published accounts:
Sergei Stankevich, a member of a
parliamentary commission that con
siders draft laws submitted to the Su
preme Soviet, said the Soviet president
would have most of the powers of his
French and American counterparts
with few of the constitutional limita
tions.
Deputies from the Baltic states are
alarmed about provisions that would
impose severe restrictions on the
rights of republics to secede and permit
authorities to crack down on
"nationalist" organizations.
Stankevich said: "I don't think this
new legislation will be acceptable to
anyone who believes in a constitutional
system of checks and balances."
Alexander Yakovlev, an aide to Gor
bachev, said the presidential system
was necessary to ensure stable devel
opment of democracy in the Soviet
Union.
