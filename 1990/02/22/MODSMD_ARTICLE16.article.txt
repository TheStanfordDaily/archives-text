# Czech President Havel speaks to packed House
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - George
Volak had to dodge communist bullets
when he escaped from Czechoslovakia
to Austria. More than two decades lat
er, he drove all night to witness a
moment he'd thought could never hap
pen: Vaclav Havel's speech yesterday
to Congress.
"I think he's a great man. I hope
he runs for re-election," said Volak,
of Murfreesboro, Tenn. He and his
wife spent 11 hours on the road with
out even knowing if they would be
able to see Havel once they got to
Washington. Their risk paid off when
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn, was able
to get them tickets.
Havel, the shy playwright who
moved from prison to Czechoslovakia's
presidential castle in a matter of
months, demonstrated to the Volaks
and hundreds of others in the packed
House chamber why he has become
his country's beacon of democracy and

hope.
In a speech unusual for its modesty,
metaphors and metaphysics, Havel
noted that he had barely two months'
experience as president and felt more
comfortable in the realm of philosophy.
But he went on to advise America's
highest office-holders how to do their
jobs.
"We still don't know how to put
morality ahead of politics, science and
economics," Havel told his audience of
senators, representatives, Cabinet
members and diplomats. He urged
them to follow their consciences rather
than act on behalf of "my family, my
country, my firm, my success."
Havel, a small blond man dressed
in a dark suit and blue-striped tie,
read his speech in Czech from a written
text, eschewing the TelePrompTers
that American politicians favor for the
best television appearance.
He flashed the victory sign during

a long, vociferous welcome and was
interrupted two dozen times for cheers
and ovations, most often during his
calls for peace, morality and a return
to the ideals of Lincoln and Jefferson.
Some House traditions were broken
for the occasion. Czechoslovak officials
accompanying Havel brandished
cameras and tape recorders, usually
forbidden on the House floor. Czech
born film director Milos Forman, now
a U.S. citizen, sat with them wearing
a red turtleneck instead of the cus
tomary dress shirt and tie under his
sport jacket.
Seated in the last row of the gallery
was tennis star Martina Navratilova,
now a U.S. citizen. As soon as Havel
spoke her native language, she began
wiping her eyes and nose with a hand
kerchief. "I started crying right away,"
she said later. "I wish I could make
speeches that good."
Havel, author of numerous plays and

books, punctuated his address with po
etic images and metaphors. His coun
try, he said, had been "pinned under
a boulder" by communism. He said
Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary
were Europe's "wayward children." He
called the world's governing systems
"anonymous megamachinery." And de
mocracy, he said, is like the horizon
— "one may approach it ... but it can
never be fully attained."
Volak, 44, was among those who took
to the streets during the "Prague
Spring" of 1968 to protest the Soviet
presence in his country. He escaped
to Austria soon after, moving to
Canada and then the United States.
"When I was crossing the border,
they were shooting at me," he recalled
while waiting for Havel's speech to
begin. Volak worked as a construction
architect and now owns a campground.
He said he and his wife visited Czech
oslovakia in December.
