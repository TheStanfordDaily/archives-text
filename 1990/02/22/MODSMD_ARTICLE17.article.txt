Launch postponed
CAPE CANAVKRAL, Fla. (AP) -
Atlantis' commander got a sore
throat yesterday, forcing NASA to
postpone for at least 24 hours the
launch of the shuttle on a secret,
all-military mission to put a spy satel
lite in orbit.
A space agency statement said a
bad weather forecast also was a factor
in the postponement, but officials
said that if not for the illness they
would have continued the
countdown, hoping for clear skies by
launch time early today.
Navy Capt. John O. Creighton has
"basically a sore throat with a little
head congestion," said agency spokes
man Kyle Herring. "He does not have
a fever. It could be an indication of
a cold coming on."
Herring said Creighton would not

be replaced on the flight because his
illness is not serious. NASA said
Creighton's health and the weather
will be evaluated today in deciding
whether to attempt a launch tomor
row morning.
Skinheads prosecuted
DALLAS (AP) — Prosecutors
opened their case yesterday against
five white supremacist "skinheads,"
accusing them of beating up blacks
and Hispanics and plotting to gas
Jews by putting cyanide in an
synagogue's air conditioning.
The defendants are on trial on
federal civil rights charges alleging
they vandalized a synagogue. Three
also are accused of chasing blacks
and Hispanics out of a park, named
for a Confederate general, that they

claimed for themselves.
A prosecutor told jurors that the
defendants' plans included a plot to
put cyanide gas into the air condi
tioning system at Temple Shalom in
a reminder of the Holocaust, in which
millions of Jews were gassed in Nazi
concentration camps.
"The terror caused by that and
other attacks is the purpose of this
trial," Suzanne Drouet, an attorney
with the U.S. Justice Department,
said in her opening statement to an
all-white jury.
Execution stayed
HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) - The
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
issued a stay yesterday to halt the
scheduled execution of a man con
victed in the slaying of a convenience

store clerk whose body was tossed
over a cliff.
The high court granted the stay
of today's execution pending the out
come of a federal case challenging
the use of the death sentence against
retarded inmates, a spokesperson in
Austin said.
Attorneys for Carl Kelly, 30, of
Waco contended psychological
evidence that could have swayed the
jurors was not introduced at his trial.
Ruling goes against law
SEATTLE (AP) — The law against
desecration of the American flag
passed by Congress last fall is un
constitutional, a federal judge ruled
yesterday in finding that four people
who burned flags were exercising
their First Amendment rights.
