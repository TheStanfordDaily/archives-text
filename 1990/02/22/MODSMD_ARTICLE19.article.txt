## Need-based aid 
### 
THE WELL is running dry.
Across the country, uni
versities are awarding fewer
grants and contracting more loans
in their financial aid packages as
a result of the federal government's
lack of funds for scholarships.
So while the government and the
University sort out their budgets,
what's a Stanford student to do?
To continue attending this insti
tution, all one can do is accept
loans and hope more money ap
pears in the grant budgets. But
the pressing question is, what is
Stanford doing to change this sit
uation?
Although the University strives
to admit a diverse student body,
its aid process may exclude certain
groups of students.
The financial aid application
process is based on the assumption
that every student comes from a
nuclear family with few uncom
mon expenses. For students from

larger or lower-income families,
taking out loans is not always
feasible.
The type of package a student
receives greatly affects his or her
experience at Stanford. If a student
must work 20 hours a week as
part of a financial aid package, that
student may be excluded from
other campus activities that make
the difference between a positive
experience and a mediocre one.
As one of the nation's leading
universities, Stanford needs to set
the pace by increased lobbying in
Washington for an increase in
federal grants. Also, the University
should be more aggressive in
searching for private grants.
Creating a system that allows
any person admitted to Stanford
to attend is a long and difficult
process. To realize this goal, Stan
ford needs to keep the revision of
the financial aid process a top pri
ority on its agenda.
