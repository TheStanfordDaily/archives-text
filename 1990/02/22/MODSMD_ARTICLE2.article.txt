# Films cancellation prompts ASSU Constitution review
## 
### Holly Hacker 
The coordinator of Tuesday Films has
canceled the film series until next winter,
alleging that the ASSU is maliciously at
tempting to deny the program funding.
The allegation has prompted ASSU of
ficers to re-examine the wording of an ar
ticle in the ASSU Constitution concerning
fee requests of student groups.
Tuesday Films coordinator Eric Diesel
said the graduate student-run group has
been "denied its constitutional rights" be
cause the ASSU is misinterpreting the Con
stitution to keep Tuesday Films off the
spring ballot.
The controversy began last year when
Tuesday Films received only 54 percent of
the student vote in the spring election,
according to Senate Chair Ed Sasaki. The
group received its funding for this year,
but because it did not receive 60 percent
of the student vote, it is required to obtain
signatures from 10 percent of the student
body to be placed on the ballot this spring.
Diesel contends that the "group did wot
get the required vote because of mistakes
made by the ASSU Elections Commission.
"Last year the elections commission lost
our statement of purpose which was sup
plied with the budget, so only our unex
plained budget appeared on the ballot,"
Diesel said in a letter to Sasaki. "Then the
elections commission forgot to put us on
the sample ballot" which appeared as an
insert in The Daily before elections.
As a result of this failure, the ASSU's

error placed Tuesday Films at a disadvan
tage that resulted in an unusually low show
of student support, he said. "We had been
getting 70 to 75 percent of the vote every
year before last," Diesel said.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss said he is "not entirely sure what
happened" concerning the omission of
Tuesday Films from the elections handbook
and from the sample ballot.
However, Krauss added that all groups
in the election have the opportunity to
review proofs of the handbook before they
go to press. Krauss said that Diesel "didn't
mention to us that anything was wrong
until the handbook had gone to press and
15,000 copies had been distributed around
campus."
Now Diesel claims that Tuesday Films
should appear on this spring's ballot with
out having to obtain student signatures.
A group that received 60 percent of the
student vote in the previous spring election
is placed on the ballot if it receives senate
approval.
A group that did not get 60 percent of
the vote, however, may get placed on the
ballot in one of two ways. The group can
obtain the signatures of 20 percent of the
student body or a three-fifths vote of the
ASSU Senate and signatures from 10 per
cent of the student body.
A three-fifths majority of the senate has
already approved Tuesday Films' budget.
Senate chair Ed Sasaki said the Films are
