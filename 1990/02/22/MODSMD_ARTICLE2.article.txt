# Films cancellation prompts ASSU Constitution review
## 
### Holly Hacker 
The coordinator of Tuesday Films has
canceled the film series until next winter,
alleging that the ASSU is maliciously at
tempting to deny the program funding.
The allegation has prompted ASSU of
ficers to re-examine the wording of an ar
ticle in the ASSU Constitution concerning
fee requests of student groups.
Tuesday Films coordinator Eric Diesel
said the graduate student-run group has
been "denied its constitutional rights" be
cause the ASSU is misinterpreting the Con
stitution to keep Tuesday Films off the
spring ballot.
The controversy began last year when
Tuesday Films received only 54 percent of
the student vote in the spring election,
according to Senate Chair Ed Sasaki. The
group received its funding for this year,
but because it did not receive 60 percent
of the student vote, it is required to obtain
signatures from 10 percent of the student
body to be placed on the ballot this spring.
Diesel contends that the "group did wot
get the required vote because of mistakes
made by the ASSU Elections Commission.
"Last year the elections commission lost
our statement of purpose which was sup
plied with the budget, so only our unex
plained budget appeared on the ballot,"
Diesel said in a letter to Sasaki. "Then the
elections commission forgot to put us on
the sample ballot" which appeared as an
insert in The Daily before elections.
As a result of this failure, the ASSU's

error placed Tuesday Films at a disadvan
tage that resulted in an unusually low show
of student support, he said. "We had been
getting 70 to 75 percent of the vote every
year before last," Diesel said.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss said he is "not entirely sure what
happened" concerning the omission of
Tuesday Films from the elections handbook
and from the sample ballot.
However, Krauss added that all groups
in the election have the opportunity to
review proofs of the handbook before they
go to press. Krauss said that Diesel "didn't
mention to us that anything was wrong
until the handbook had gone to press and
15,000 copies had been distributed around
campus."
Now Diesel claims that Tuesday Films
should appear on this spring's ballot with
out having to obtain student signatures.
A group that received 60 percent of the
student vote in the previous spring election
is placed on the ballot if it receives senate
approval.
A group that did not get 60 percent of
the vote, however, may get placed on the
ballot in one of two ways. The group can
obtain the signatures of 20 percent of the
student body or a three-fifths vote of the
ASSU Senate and signatures from 10 per
cent of the student body.
A three-fifths majority of the senate has
already approved Tuesday Films' budget.
Senate chair Ed Sasaki said the Films are
"very popular" and he would
"hate to see them fold."
Council of Presidents member
David Brown said, "We want to
make sure Tuesday Films is on
the ballot."
Diesel, however, has no inten
tion of obtaining student signa
tures. "There's no reason to. . . .
They can't just make us collect
signatures," he said. According to
Diesel, the only reason Tuesday
Films has been told it must collect
signatures is out of "pure ASSU
bureaucracy to make trouble."
Diesel primarily objects to the
ASSU's reading of Article V,
Clause 3 of the ASSU Constitu
tion, which says a group can ap
pear on the ballot without
collecting student signatures if it
receives approval of three-fifths
of the senate, "provided that the
last time this student organization
appeared on the ballot for a spe
cial fee, of at least substantially
the same amount (of money) pres
ently sought, those in favor con
stituted at least 60 percent."
Diesel contends that the
$12,800 Tuesday Films is request
ing — which is based on the 1988
budget when the group received
at least 60 percent of the vote —
is much less than the $17,135 it

requested last year. Thus the
lower figure is far less than
"substantially the same amount"
of the figure which appeared in
the previous election.
But Krauss said the ASSU
"does not give out bonuses to
groups for cutting their budgets."
"[Diesel's] interpretation of the
Constitution is harmful," Sasaki
said. If Tuesday Films could ap
pear on this year's ballot because
it received enough support two
years earlier, "any group could go
back five or ten years to get on
the ballot," he explained.
In a letter to Sasaki, Diesel said,
"Please don't take away our con
stitutional rights and do nothing
but cause unnecessary extra work
for already overworked volunteers
and put in jeopardy a program
which is one of the few places
ASSU dollars get back to graduate
students."
"Now we're saving all of our
remaining money for next year,"
Diesel said. He said he plans to
resume the program next winter
after "removing everyone from
the ASSU this spring" and
"replacing the ASSU power struc
ture with those more sympathetic
to student organizations."
Diesel's question about inter
pretation of this clause of the Con
stitution has led to discussion in
the ASSU. Krauss said he and
some ASSU senators have agreed
that "this part of the Constitution

'Please don't take
away our constitu
tional rights..

is not written particularly clear
ly."
The debate has brought to the
ASSU's attention the need to pos
sibly rewrite and clarify some ar
ticles of the Constitution. "A lot
of it's been a big mystery," said
Brown. "In the future there need
to be some changes in the bylaws
to make it clearer and more ac
cessible to students."
Diesel's protests have left
several ASSU officers frustrated.
Even though Krauss admitted
that the bylaws need "a lot of
clarification," he added that
"there's a perfectly legal and con
stitutional means for Tuesday
Films to get on the ballot."
Sasaki added, "[Diesel has]
done everything from lying to my
face to distorting the truth. I
refuse to be intimidated into ig
noring the Constitution."
He continued, "I can't waive
the Constitution, but if [Diesel]
is willing to work together, I could
help him." However, Sasaki
"If he's so dedicated to
Tuesday Films, then why did he
cancel this week's showing? It's
completely irrational."

Brown. "In the future there need

Diesel's protests have left
several ASSU officers frustrated.
Even though Krauss admitted
that the bylaws need "a lot of

"there's a perfectly legal and con

Sasaki added, "[Diesel has]

He continued, "I can't waive

help him." However, Sasaki
"If he's so dedicated to
Tuesday Films, then why did he
cancel this week's showing? It's
completely irrational."
The coordinator of Tuesday Films has
canceled the film series until next winter,
alleging that the ASSU is maliciously at
tempting to deny the program funding.
The allegation has prompted ASSU of
ficers to re-examine the wording of an ar
ticle in the ASSU Constitution concerning
fee requests of student groups.
Tuesday Films coordinator Eric Diesel
said the graduate student-run group has
been "denied its constitutional rights" be
cause the ASSU is misinterpreting the Con
stitution to keep Tuesday Films off the
spring ballot.
The controversy began last year when
Tuesday Films received only 54 percent of
the student vote in the spring election,
according to Senate Chair Ed Sasaki. The
group received its funding for this year,
but because it did not receive 60 percent
of the student vote, it is required to obtain
signatures from 10 percent of the student
body to be placed on the ballot this spring.
Diesel contends that the "group did wot
get the required vote because of mistakes
made by the ASSU Elections Commission.
"Last year the elections commission lost
our statement of purpose which was sup
plied with the budget, so only our unex
plained budget appeared on the ballot,"
Diesel said in a letter to Sasaki. "Then the
elections commission forgot to put us on
the sample ballot" which appeared as an
insert in The Daily before elections.
As a result of this failure, the ASSU's

error placed Tuesday Films at a disadvan
tage that resulted in an unusually low show
of student support, he said. "We had been
getting 70 to 75 percent of the vote every
year before last," Diesel said.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss said he is "not entirely sure what
happened" concerning the omission of
Tuesday Films from the elections handbook
and from the sample ballot.
However, Krauss added that all groups
in the election have the opportunity to
review proofs of the handbook before they
go to press. Krauss said that Diesel "didn't
mention to us that anything was wrong
until the handbook had gone to press and
15,000 copies had been distributed around
campus."
Now Diesel claims that Tuesday Films
should appear on this spring's ballot with
out having to obtain student signatures.
A group that received 60 percent of the
student vote in the previous spring election
is placed on the ballot if it receives senate
approval.
A group that did not get 60 percent of
the vote, however, may get placed on the
ballot in one of two ways. The group can
obtain the signatures of 20 percent of the
student body or a three-fifths vote of the
ASSU Senate and signatures from 10 per
cent of the student body.
A three-fifths majority of the senate has
already approved Tuesday Films' budget.
Senate chair Ed Sasaki said the Films are
"very popular" and he would
"hate to see them fold."
Council of Presidents member
David Brown said, "We want to
make sure Tuesday Films is on
the ballot."
Diesel, however, has no inten
tion of obtaining student signa
tures. "There's no reason to. . . .
They can't just make us collect
signatures," he said. According to
Diesel, the only reason Tuesday
Films has been told it must collect
signatures is out of "pure ASSU
bureaucracy to make trouble."
Diesel primarily objects to the
ASSU's reading of Article V,
Clause 3 of the ASSU Constitu
tion, which says a group can ap
pear on the ballot without
collecting student signatures if it
receives approval of three-fifths
of the senate, "provided that the
last time this student organization
appeared on the ballot for a spe
cial fee, of at least substantially
the same amount (of money) pres
ently sought, those in favor con
stituted at least 60 percent."
Diesel contends that the
$12,800 Tuesday Films is request
ing — which is based on the 1988
budget when the group received
at least 60 percent of the vote —
is much less than the $17,135 it

requested last year. Thus the
lower figure is far less than
"substantially the same amount"
of the figure which appeared in
the previous election.
But Krauss said the ASSU
"does not give out bonuses to
groups for cutting their budgets."
"[Diesel's] interpretation of the
Constitution is harmful," Sasaki
said. If Tuesday Films could ap
pear on this year's ballot because
it received enough support two
years earlier, "any group could go
back five or ten years to get on
the ballot," he explained.
In a letter to Sasaki, Diesel said,
"Please don't take away our con
stitutional rights and do nothing
but cause unnecessary extra work
for already overworked volunteers
and put in jeopardy a program
which is one of the few places
ASSU dollars get back to graduate
students."
"Now we're saving all of our
remaining money for next year,"
Diesel said. He said he plans to
resume the program next winter
after "removing everyone from
the ASSU this spring" and
"replacing the ASSU power struc
ture with those more sympathetic
to student organizations."
Diesel's question about inter
pretation of this clause of the Con
stitution has led to discussion in
the ASSU. Krauss said he and
some ASSU senators have agreed
that "this part of the Constitution

'Please don't take
away our constitu
tional rights..

is not written particularly clear
ly."
The debate has brought to the
ASSU's attention the need to pos
sibly rewrite and clarify some ar
ticles of the Constitution. "A lot
of it's been a big mystery," said
Brown. "In the future there need
to be some changes in the bylaws
to make it clearer and more ac
cessible to students."
