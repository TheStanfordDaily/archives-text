THE THIRD time's a charm,
or so they say.
However, the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity has a lot of charm
ing to do to erase the irresponsible
image it has earned with three
suspensions in the past four years.
Last week, the University ended
the Phi Delts' four-month social
suspension for an October incident
where an intoxicated freshman was
Hit by a car on his way home from
their "Hurricane Party." The fra
ternity was required to submit a
plan to shift their focus away from
alcohol.
For starters, the guidelines
promise an entirely dry Rush, un
like past Phi Delt rushes. All
parties will be limited to 350 pre
invited guests. Outside vendors
will be hired to serve alcohol and
ensure security.

Ideally, these guidelines will put
the floundering Phi Delts back on
a more responsible path. They
overwhelmingly favored a dry
Rush, an indication of their com
mitment to entertain responsibly.
Yet guidelines may not be
enough for a group that has reck
lessly and repeatedly disregarded
the Residential Education alcohol
policy. Furthermore, the Phi Delts'
invitation-only policy may worsen
the elitism that often goes hand
in-hand with the fraternal system.
We applaud the fraternity's ef
forts to turn over a new leaf; how
ever, it remains to be seen whether
their irresponsible history will be
repeated.
Clearly, the tie that connects the
Phi Delts to the Stanford commu
nity can only be as strong as its
members' commitment to change.
