Bush's sincerity about human rights questionable

AS ONE REASON for the inva
sion of Panama, President Bush
named his concern for the
human rights of the people of that
country.
Noriega was indeed an abusive dic
tator, but in light of Bush's foreign
policy stances toward a number of
other countries, his claim of a sincere
concern for the Panamanians' human
rights loses its credibility.
What about human rights in China?
After the leadership in Beijing demon
strated its stance on human rights last
spring, Bush backed up his strong
words of condemnation by sending
Brent Scowcroft off to maintain sup
portive relations with the Chinese
government.
Chinese students in the United
States who actively and visibly sup
ported the movement for democracy
had (and have) a genuine fear of perse
cution upon return to China.
Bush, however, granted their need
for human rights protection no support

by insisting that they receive no as
surance of the right to stay in the
United States after their visas expire.
What about El Salvador? President
Bush continues Reagan's policy by
sending nearly $1.5 million per day to
a military-political land-ownership
oligarchy which can boast one of the
most impressive histories of systematic
torture, disappearances, and killings of
both guerillas and noncombatants.
One might argue, "President Chris
tiani's recent efforts to prosecute those
in the military responsible for the
murder of the Jesuit priests, the cook
and her daughter show that the mili
tary and not the government is respon
sible for the human rights abuses. The
United States should therefore support
the Salvadoran government vis-a-vis
the military."
First, a large part of American aid is
used for explicitly military purposes,
doing nothing to support the autonomy
of the government.
Second, Christiani's rounding up a

few people to point his finger at
(before the lenses of the United States
press) demonstrates no serious effort
to cleanse the army of its human
rights abusers.
Non-partisan organizations such as
Amnesty International have shown that
the numbers of human rights abusers
in the Salvadoran military run far in
excess of those figures whom Christiani
has singled out.
Torture, killings, and disappearances
have comprised such a great and sys
tematic strategy of repression that a
few officers could not be the root of
the problem.
Third, if one examines the Arena
party's (Christiani's party) history of
-death squad collusion, one has little
reason to believe he really wants to
increase his government's autonomy
from the military.
Finally, any claims of democratic
legitimization of this government are
questionable at best given the voter
intimidation that marked the elections

(clear vote-collection bags making
secret ballots a sham, combined with
the military's presence at many polling
stations).
Turkey is a NATO ally which main
tains very close relations with the
United States. The NATO treaty
makes stipulations for the respect of
human rights in its member states,
but President Bush says noting about
the lack of freedom of expression,
torture in police stations, repression of
political dissent and abuse of Kurds.
President Bush invaded Panama
because he did not like the head of
state, not out of any concern for
human rights.
If Panamanian human rights were
such an issue in the invasion, why did
all the fine generals in the press con
ferences say essentially nothing about
how many Panamanians were injured
or killed?
