# Stanford committed to financial aid
## 
### 
I WANT TO commend the organi
zers of this year's Financial Aid
Awareness Week: the ASSU
(through its Committee on Democracy
in Education), the Financial Aids
Office and the Public Service Center
have joined forces to raise awareness
and further Stanford's commitment to
improving access to higher education
for everyone.
Awareness Week should become an
annual endeavor, because these issues
grow in importance each year. Despite
the dramatic shrinkage in direct
federal support over the past decade,

financial aid has not received the
attention it deserved.
It has become increasingly difficult
to provide adequate aid to our stu
dents; but despite the budget con
straints, we will continue our commit
ment to hold tuition increases to rea
sonable levels while meeting the dem
onstrated financial need of our stu
dents.
Tonight's final event ("Bush's
Budget: Closing the Door to Higher
Education?") should provide a great
opportunity to learn about the underly
ing issues and possible routes to policy
change.
The speakers include Assemblyman
Rusty Areias, member of the Assembly
Sub-Committee on Higher Education;

Julianne Marley, president of the
United States Student Association, who
represents students' interests in Wash
ington, D.C.; and Robert Huff, director
of Stanford's Financial Aids Office.
I invite you to join them tonight at
7 p.m. in the Casa Zapata dining room
in Stern Hall.
Donald Kennedy
University president
