## More to life than Joneses 
### 
HEY, LOOK WHAT I got," yells
Mr. Jones as he pulls into his
driveway in his new BMW. Pretty
nifty, huh?
Neighbor Larry Lunchbox seethes
within, nods indifferently, and vows to
buy a bigger and better car the next day.
Keeping up with the Joneses, a timeless
suburban pastime, has been transformed
into an international metaphor. This
time, Mr. Jones not only sports a BMW,
but hefty economic and technological
powers that Larry Lunchbox intends to
reckon with. Indeed, ever since Japan
became an economic superpower, Amer
icans have been playing "keep-up" with
the Japanese.
Thus it came as no surprise when Pres
ident Bush promised, in his televised
State of the Union address last month,
to channel much of the peace dividends
from defense cuts into education, adding
that American students would be able to
surpass Japanese students in mathemat
ics within the next three decades.
His promise comes at a time when
educators throughout the country are
decrying American students' shoddy
math and science skills as a stumbling
block in the technological race.
While it's heartening to see attention
being paid to the state of public educa
tion, it's also disturbing to note the tech
nological trend that is surfacing in
education. Rather than deeming
academia as worthy in itself, many now
tout education as a means of increasing
economic and technological might.
Notice that Bush does not emphasize
raising the level of literacy in the hu

manities despite the dire need for im
provement in that area. Numerous
studies have shown that a substantial
number of public high school students
think that Columbus arrived in North
America sometime after 1700 and that
Karl Marx wrote "Leaves of Grass." Yet
such studies are often pooh-poohed.
After all, a firm grasp of literature and
history does not bolster one's speed in
the race to technological progress.
Even at Stanford, a liberal-arts school,
it isn't uncommon to hear phrases such
as "fuzzies don't know anything" or
"fuzzies have their heads in the clouds."
When asked what I'm planning on msyor
ing in, I frequently receive the following
reactions:
"Well, I was thinking about computer
science or. .."
Beam of admiration. Look of respect.
"English."
Controlled disdain. The you'll-starve
for-sure look.
As practical majors are touted, as col
lege is increasingly viewed as a
springboard for economic security, a new
kind of vocational mindset emerges that
is antithetical to the purpose of educa
tion.
The idea that we can affix a price tag
to an academic discipline is as ludicrous
as the notion that the ability to solve
(x-2)2y + 6(x-2)y +4y = 0 is somehow
worth more than a firm grasp of "The
Canterbury Tales." Each discipline
should be viewed as knowledge in itself
rather than some useful information to
achieve some pragmatic ends.
This is not to say that academia should

stantial number of high
school students think that
Columbus arrived some
time after 1700 and Marx
wrote 'Leaves of Grass.'

be blind to technology; advances in the
pure math and sciences are strongly cou
pled with technological innovation. It is
only when those disciplines become solely
technologically geared, when economic in
terests cloud academic interests, that the
purpose of education becomes distorted.
By defining beating the Japanese at
math as an educational goal, Bush implies
that we should emulate Japan's strongly
technologically-based education system,
an implication which ignores the dedica
tion to learning for learning's sake which
has made America the Joneses of aca
demics for such a long time.
It is only when the technological race
causes us to mix academics with prag
matics that learning has been reduced to
the level of dollars and cents.
