Nicaraguans will likely support Sandinistas in free, fair election

AS THE long-awaited elections
rapidly approach, Nicaragua is a
country on edge. Conversations
inevitably turn to politics. The outcome
of the elections has become increas
ingly clear and can be summarized in
a couple of sentences.
The largest percentage of Nicara
guans support the Sandinista National
Liberation Front (FSLN), while the
National Opposition (UNO) will receive
a significant percentage of the votes
and will probably win in a few towns.
The other eight parties continue to
wage full-fledged campaigns.
However, the key question has be-

come whether or not UNO and the
United States government will accept
an FSLN victory. The Nicaraguan
government increasingly is fearing that
the opposition may take drastic meas
ures to disrupt the electoral process. In
light of this situation I write to clarify
some important facts about the elec
toral process and politics in Nicaragua
in general.
First, Nicaragua is a country of
three and a half million people. Twice
this amount of people live in New York
City alone. In short, the outcome of
this election will not upset the balance
of power in the world.

Second, if any country can claim to
be a democracy, Nicaragua is a democ
racy. Approximately 93 percent of the
people are registered to vote in this
election and 75 percent voted in the
last presidential election although it
was mandated by law. Less than half
the eligible voters in the United States
participated in the last presidential
election.
Third, Nicaraguans are informed
about all political parties. However,
"informed" is not the correct word.
"Inundated" better describes the situa
tion. Each weeknight since Dec. 4
there have been televised political

debates in which each party has the
opportunity to participate. Nothing is
censored.
Fourth, the elections will be free of
fraud. Currently there are thousands of
journalists, and 3,000 invited and
official observers in the country, the
majority of whom have highly com
mended the Supreme Electoral Council,
the committee in charge of overseeing
the elections.
Fifth, the Sandinistas do not want
Nicaragua to become a Soviet satellite
country. Nicaraguans want to improve
their relations with the United States
government. The biggest issue in this

election is who can negotiate peace.
There are few signs of the military
anywhere in the country. The factor
that currently is hurting Nicaragua at
least as much as defense spending is
the United States embargo. Most of
the machines in Nicaragua came from
the United States and it is impossible
to obtain parts. The Sandinista govern
ment would like nothing more than to
normalize relations with the United
States.
