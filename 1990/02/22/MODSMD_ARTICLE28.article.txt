# New parking policy unfair to students
## 
### 
This letter is in reference to the
article that appeared in the Feb. 20
Daily on the proposed University
Parking Policy.
If the University plans to "reclaim"
all student parking places from the
central campus (within the Campus
Drive loop), where are the students
currently using these spaces to park
their cars?
I see the following possibilities:

• Students mysteriously get rid of
the cars they own.
• Students are made to park at loca
tions far away from their residences.
Being forced to park hundreds of
yards away from one's residence is not
only a severe inconvenience, it is down
right unsafe.
For female students in particular,
this simply precludes their using their
cars after nightfall. Is the University
going to provide a free escort service
from all the "outside" parking lots to
all residences on campus at all times of
the night?
Even if there is a bus or shuttle

service, can you imagine yourself
standing in a deserted parking lot in
the middle of the night, waiting for a
bus to arrive?
And all this is so that someone who
works on campus, presumably coming
and going where there is daylight, can
park within the central campus.
Maybe the University will not sum
marily eject the students from their
parking spaces. There are subtler ways
of achieving the same goals, like
raising the parking permit rates to
ludicrous amounts.
