We would like to take this opportu
nity to express our appreciation for the
wholehearted support and sponsorship
of Casa Zapata's "Floricanto" festival
of poetry and music.
During the nine-hour non-stop
poetry and music festival, over 1,000
people atttended, many from outside
this community. There were so many
poets and musicians that we had to

cancel intermissions. Yet the spirit
never let up.
The diversity was tremendous. Just
about every Latin American country
was represented. A contingent of poets
drove up from Los Angeles. Poets
ranged from Stanford students to
Keith Archuleta, Prof. Fernando
Alegria and Edgar List who on his own
flew in from Mexico just for this event.
We would like to thank our col
leagues and friends who sent us their
support for Floricanto and Luis Val
dez's upcoming visit on Mar. 3 at 7
p.m. in Cubblerley Auditorium.
