# Rock 'n' roll Express
## Tresidder's mainstay plays 'extreme metal' 
### Leina Johansson 
Sept. 23, 1988.
That day remains clear in the
mind of Erik Moggridge: his
band changed drummers, he re
ceived his driver's license, and
he secured a job at Stanford's
own convenience market.
Moggridge, who says he "was
not in a learning state of mind"
after his 1988 graduation from
Palo Alto High School, worked
at a 7-11 and then spent three
weeks in Europe before respond
ing to the "Help Wanted" sign
at Tresidder Union.
"They just snatched me up,"
Moggridge said. "They totally
needed people."
Moggridge's motivation to ap
ply at Tresidder was to save
money for his rock band,
Epidemic. "We play aggressive
speed metal, on the more ex
treme end of the genre," he said.
Epidemic plays at shows in
such places as San Francisco,
rather than the Stanford dorm
party scene, he explained.
"People around here would
probably say, 'What's that huge,
horrendous noise?', check us out
and leave very quickly. We're not
really party music."

Since the time when the store
was simply called "The Store,"
Tresidder Express has been
remodeled and new technology
introduced in the form of a com
puterized check-out system.
Moggridge has had three dif
ferent bosses, and Stanford stu
dents working at Tresidder
Express come and go.
"Just about everything has
changed, except for me," Mog
gridge said. Luckily, Moggridge
gets along with new people easily
and likes the variety.
In fact, because of the inter
action with customers, cash reg
ister work is Moggridge's
favorite task. Many shoppers are
regulars that Moggridge knows
by name or recognizes by face.
"I know hundreds of people in
a very shallow sort of way," he
said.
Working at Tresidder has
eliminated the stereotype Mog
gridge once had of Stanford
students. Before, he had the
vague impression that they were
very intellectual and slightly
class-conscious.
Moggridge laughed and said,
"I realize now that Stanford stu
dents are just like people."

Erik Moggridge, the friendly check-out person at Tresidder Ex
press, has become a familiar face to hundreds of students. When
not working the Tresidder cash register Moggridge plays in an
"extreme metal" rock band.
