Something scared me during last weekend's road
trip to Los Angeles.
No, it wasn't the weather, even though it
was miserable for three solid days and the rain
turned Sunset Boulevard into a river.
It wasn't the traffic, either; I guess I've become
used to watching L.A. drivers violate just about
every common-sense rule of driving that exists.
(Lights? Who needs lights at 2 o'clock in the morn
ing?)

Even playing taxi driver and making four trips
to a section of Hollywood that was, to put it lightly,
seedy, wasn't really scary.
Watching the Stanford-USC basketball game,
though, frightened me more than I can say.
The fear I felt last Thursday had nothing to do
with the game itself, even though watching Stanford
lose to a team like the Trojans didn't exactly make
me feel comfortable about the Cardinal. The problem
was the L.A. Sports Arena. Or, to be more specific,
the emptiness of the L.A. Sports Arena.
Now, I'd heard that this stadium was a hole —
it is — but the ugliness of it, as well as the complete
and utter lack of any spring in the floor (I jumped
on it twice and felt my shins start to snap) aren't
really what's wrong.
The problem is, well, that nobody from USC gives
a flying you-know-what about their basketball team.
Okay, "nobody" is kind of harsh. According to USC,
2,257 people showed up for the game. Odds are
that total included the band, cheerleaders, reporters
and a few (other) assorted rats, but still, 2,000 fans
is not a really frightening number.
Two thousand silent fans in a building built for
15,000 is, however, somewhat disquieting. Especially
when I think about what the crowds at Maples
Pavilion were probably like before I came to Stanford
— and how they could conceivably end up if the
basketball team doesn't continue the success of the
past few seasons.
Now, before anyone gets ticked off, I'm not
trying to suggest that Stanford fans are any
thing remotely like USC's, because there's
no comparison.
The USC fans, who obviously didn't notice that
their team was pounding on the Cardinal, stood up
exactly four times during the entire game: Once to
give Chrjs Munk a hand when he fouled out (with
zero points), once to see if a Trojan player was
hurt, once to cheer a ridiculous reverse layup that
sealed the win and finally, with 15 seconds left, to
cheer for the team, which was a winner for the
third time in its last four games.
Other than that, they were quiet. How quiet?
Well, in the second half — about the time Stanford
started to fall behind — I went up to the very top
row of the Arena. Section 10, Row 26, Seat 17. I
stayed there for almost 10 minutes, and I kept
hearing something that annoyed me. Even when
the Trojan fans were pseudo-cheering, I could hear
— clearly — every single time a Stanford player
on the bench clapped his hands.
Don't tell me the acoustics are that good.
Of course, you'll tell me that there's no way fans
here could ever end up like that. USC has been so
bad for so long they don't deserve to have fans,
you say.
True enough. So why, when I showed up at last
week's game at Maples against Washington two
minutes before tipoff, did I get a decent seat? Well,
it was a Sunday afternoon, you say. We had work
to do. Washington isn't a good team. And — though
I doubt anyone would admit this — Stanford had
lost four of its previous five games. Why watch?
Good question. I wanted to ask UCLA's fans
the same thing before the game on Sunday.
You remember UCLA. They're the team
that's fallen apart in the last two weeks. Before
Sunday's game, the Bruins had lost three of their

previous five and looked like last
week's garbage when they lost to
Cal (ending another 25-year home
winning streak).
For the Stanford game, it was
a Sunday afternoon in L.A., the
Bruins were playing a team that
was, well, not great, and UCLA
had been playing terribly. Logic
would therefore dictate that the
average student could walk into
Pauley Pavilion at 2:58 and get
a good seat, right?
Not. The students were lined
up two hours before game time,
waiting to be let in. Yes, I said
two hours. And no, this is not a
rivalry along the lines of
Stanford-Cal. This was just an
other game, played in front of
12,000 people — 11,950 of whom
didn't like the Cardinal very
much.

court from the students with a
friend — between the two of us

much noise as USC's fans had the
other night — and the cheering
at the end of the game, as the
Bruins almost came back from 11
points down, was unbelievable.
Now, it couldn't always be like
that, of course. And it isn't.
UCLA is usually winning. What
a coincidence, huh?
So what's the point of all this?
Well, there seem to be three
levels of college hoops fans:
USC's who-really-cares zombies,
UCLA's we're-gonna-show-up
early-no-matter-what fans, and —
somewhere in between — Stan
ford fans. We're obviously much
closer to UCLA than USC, but
there's a ways to go.
The Arizona game tomorrow is

sold out, which isn't surprising.
Everyone will be going crazy,
which also isn't surprising. It's
easy to get up for the big games.
Ask yourself something. Sup
pose Derek Bruton had missed
that free throw four days ago.
Suppose Andrew Vlahov hadn't
shut Don Mac Lean down. Sup
pose Trevor had made one more
free throw (all right, so that's ri
diculous. Forget it). What if, in
stead of coming off a sweet vic
tory, the Cardinal were heading
into tomorrow's game on the heels
of two more road losses, with a
2-6 record in its last eight games.
Would you have shown up any
way?
If the answer is yes, that's
great. That means there's only
one more question. If the Cardinal
loses, how many of you will be
back the next night to watch the
Arizona State game?
It's something to think about.

Cameron Macky, The Daily's base
ball writer, almost got himself
killed on Sunday by a bunch of
fans who kept telling him
to shut up.
