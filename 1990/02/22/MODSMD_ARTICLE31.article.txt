Something scared me during last weekend's road
trip to Los Angeles.
No, it wasn't the weather, even though it
was miserable for three solid days and the rain
turned Sunset Boulevard into a river.
It wasn't the traffic, either; I guess I've become
used to watching L.A. drivers violate just about
every common-sense rule of driving that exists.
(Lights? Who needs lights at 2 o'clock in the morn
ing?)

Even playing taxi driver and making four trips
to a section of Hollywood that was, to put it lightly,
seedy, wasn't really scary.
Watching the Stanford-USC basketball game,
though, frightened me more than I can say.
The fear I felt last Thursday had nothing to do
with the game itself, even though watching Stanford
lose to a team like the Trojans didn't exactly make
me feel comfortable about the Cardinal. The problem
was the L.A. Sports Arena. Or, to be more specific,
the emptiness of the L.A. Sports Arena.
Now, I'd heard that this stadium was a hole —
it is — but the ugliness of it, as well as the complete
and utter lack of any spring in the floor (I jumped
on it twice and felt my shins start to snap) aren't
really what's wrong.
The problem is, well, that nobody from USC gives
a flying you-know-what about their basketball team.
Okay, "nobody" is kind of harsh. According to USC,
2,257 people showed up for the game. Odds are
that total included the band, cheerleaders, reporters
and a few (other) assorted rats, but still, 2,000 fans
is not a really frightening number.
Two thousand silent fans in a building built for
15,000 is, however, somewhat disquieting. Especially
when I think about what the crowds at Maples
Pavilion were probably like before I came to Stanford
— and how they could conceivably end up if the
basketball team doesn't continue the success of the
past few seasons.
Now, before anyone gets ticked off, I'm not
trying to suggest that Stanford fans are any
thing remotely like USC's, because there's
no comparison.
The USC fans, who obviously didn't notice that
their team was pounding on the Cardinal, stood up
exactly four times during the entire game: Once to
give Chrjs Munk a hand when he fouled out (with
zero points), once to see if a Trojan player was
hurt, once to cheer a ridiculous reverse layup that
sealed the win and finally, with 15 seconds left, to
cheer for the team, which was a winner for the
third time in its last four games.
Other than that, they were quiet. How quiet?
Well, in the second half — about the time Stanford
started to fall behind — I went up to the very top
row of the Arena. Section 10, Row 26, Seat 17. I
stayed there for almost 10 minutes, and I kept
hearing something that annoyed me. Even when
the Trojan fans were pseudo-cheering, I could hear
— clearly — every single time a Stanford player
on the bench clapped his hands.
Don't tell me the acoustics are that good.
Of course, you'll tell me that there's no way fans
here could ever end up like that. USC has been so
bad for so long they don't deserve to have fans,
you say.
True enough. So why, when I showed up at last
week's game at Maples against Washington two
minutes before tipoff, did I get a decent seat? Well,
it was a Sunday afternoon, you say. We had work
to do. Washington isn't a good team. And — though
I doubt anyone would admit this — Stanford had
lost four of its previous five games. Why watch?
Good question. I wanted to ask UCLA's fans
the same thing before the game on Sunday.
You remember UCLA. They're the team
that's fallen apart in the last two weeks. Before
Sunday's game, the Bruins had lost three of their
