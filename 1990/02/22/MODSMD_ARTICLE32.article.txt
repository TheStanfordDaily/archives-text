# Not Just A Passing Fancy
## Versatile Zeilstra stars as a starter 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
At the start of the year, Julie
Zeilstra was the only ques
tion mark in Stanford's
starting five. Today, one might
say she's the exclamation point.
Over the previous two seasons,
the Cardinal's "Fab Four" of Jen
nifer Azzi, Sonja Henning, Katy
Steding and Trisha Stevens had
started 58 of the team's last 61
games. The quartet combined for
an average of 55 points, 18
rebounds and 16 assists in 1988-
89.
Coach Tara VanDerveer was
more than confident in those four,
but was still in need of a fifth
starter. In selecting Zeilstra, a 6-
foot-3 sophomore from Vernal,
Utah, the coach knew she was
making a good choice.
Zeilstra scored 7.1 points and
pulled down 3.9 rebounds per
game in a reserve role her fresh
man year. As a senior in high
school, the versatile frontcourt
player averaged 29.5 points, 17
rebounds and 10.5 assists â€” an
average of a triple-double for
those of you keeping score.
Still, things were uncertain.
Zeilstra has a chronic Achilles
problem and was not even playing
full-court basketball in the
preseason. "The main reason
there was a question mark (about
my starting) was because of my
Achilles," she says. "No one really
knew if I was going to play or if
I was going to redshirt."
With countless hours of treat
ment from trainer Patti Millson,
Zeilstra has been able to play and
her performance on the court
speaks for itself. Zeilstra is fourth
on the team in scoring (14.1
points per game), third in
rebounding (6.1) and fourth in
field goal percentage (.542).
Like other members of the No.
3-ranked Cardinal, she will not
grab headlines with those statis
tics. "I probably don't do one or
two things great," Zeilstra says.
"I think I do all the little things

that don't get written up in the
paper, but that a team needs to
be successful."
Including in the little things are
"screening, boxing out, taking
good shots, running the offense
the way Tara wants it run and
passing the ball," Zeilstra says.
"Her passing is kind of like Bill
Walton's or Larry Bird's," says
VanDerveer, likening her to a cou
ple of the greatest frontcourt pas
sers in NBA history.
"Julie does a lot of things very,
very well," VanDerveer adds.
"She really understands things
and pays attention to details. Julie
runs the floor well and handles
the ball, too. I've seen her dribble
behind her back.
"I'm most pleased with her of
fensive rebounding," the coach
says. "She's getting great position.
That's her biggest improvement
from last year." With 65 offensive
boards, Zeilstra is only two behind
super frosh Val Whiting for tops
on the team.
While it might seem like bas
ketball has always come easily for
Zeilstra, nothing could be farther
from the truth. Located in
remote, northeastern Utah,
Zeilstra's Uintah High team did
not have many neighboring
schools to compete against.
That meant a lot of traveling
to and from Vernal. Zeilstra
describes a typical game day like
this: "We'd go to our first class
(in the morning). After that, we
would get on a bus and drive four
hours to Salt Lake City or Provo,
get off the bus, put on our uni
forms, play a game, get back on
the bus and drive. Usually, we'd
get back at 2 or 3 o'clock in the
morning and then go to class the
next day.
"1 missed about 40 days of
school each year for volleyball,
basketball and track," the three
sport high school star adds. In her
sophomore year, Zeilstra began to
focus her attention on basketball.
"I decided to become the best
