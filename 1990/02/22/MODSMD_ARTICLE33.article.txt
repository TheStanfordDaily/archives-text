# Long process yields highly touted football class

Visits are over, cross-country tele
phone calls are finished, and letters
have been signed. The football class
of 1994 is complete.
Cardinal Coach Denny Green and
his assistants have brought in what
is considered the 15th best gridiron
class in the nation.
This year's team, along with the
coaching staff, is satisfied with the
new recruits. "All of them have good
character," said freshman football
player Ron Redell. "As a whole, we
feel the 1990 class is very solid.
"All the guys have outstanding lead
ership and winning abilities on the
field," added Green. The addition of
this class to our program will put us
in the right direction for the future.
"Following the success of the 1989
recruiting season, this class of 1990
gives us two talented groups of student
athletes back-to-back."
The process took almost a year. Be
ginning last May the recruiting staff

went on the road to check out out
standing sophomores and juniors and
to promote the Stanford Summer
Camp for high school players. Green
and his staff used this as an early
opportunity to get acquainted with
promising athletes and decide what
they could offer the Cardinal football
team.
The staff next spent countless hours
watching videos of summer football
camps and high school games that
highlight the best athletes and teams
of the country.
From the thousands of candidates
that were originally considered, paid
recruiting trips were offered to 85 pro
spective players.
It was these trips that gave the
coaching staff and the players a chance
to get to know the athletes better and
see how well they interacted with the
team. Most trips consist of a weekend
visit which enable the recruit to see
the academic and the social aspects of
Stanford while being hosted by a
player.

"We really value our players'
opinions. They are literally the eyes
and ears of the recruiting staff,"
Recruiting Coordinator David Ken
nedy said. "They really know who
would be able to contribute and fit in
with our team."
Since the team's assessments of po
tential players are seriously consid
ered, they have a very important and
sometimes difficult job to do. They
must convince the recruits that Stan
ford is the place for them.
"They (the recruiting staff) really
set up a full schedule, the entire time
was filled," Redell said of his visit a
year ago. "I was picked up at the air
port, given tours of the campus and
taken out to dinner and to parties. My
recruiting trip was during Super Bowl
weekend, and so we went up to the
City after the 49ers won."
For some players, the choice to play
for Stanford is an easy one and the
recruiting job is simple. "I was hosted
by John Carpenter, a guy from my
high school, and 1 knew that I wanted

to play for Stanford before even com
ing out," Redell, who this year hosted
star prep quarterback Steve
Stenstrom, said.
For other players, however, more
thought was needed before committing
to play on the Farm. Freshman Jimmy
Klein had recruiting trips at Stanford,
UCLA and USC but didn't want to
make any choices until he saw all three
schools. After getting acquainted with
the three head coaches and knowing
how much his sister, volleyball player
Kristin Klein, liked Stanford, he was
able to make his decision in favor of
the Cardinal.
Klein hosted Hartwell Brown, a
standout defensive linebacker and per
haps Stanford's top recruit for 1990.
"I knew that he (Brown) was inter
ested in weightlifting so I gave him
tours of the gyms and weight rooms,"
Klein said
While Klein feels there is much more
stress felt by the prospective athletes,
