# Stanford netters drop only one set
## Women look almost flawless en route to 9-0 crushing of Golden Bears 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's Stanford-California ten
nis match was a typical case of good
news, bad news.
First, the good news. The Cardinal
was able to play its complete lineup for
the first time this season. Despite the
fact that Sandra Birch and Debbie
Graham were both less than healthy,
Stanford swept the meet 9-0.
Which, for the rest of the country, is
the bad news. In those matches, the
Cardinal lost but one set to the No. 7
Bears, who are not a bad team.

Birch is still suffering from the effects
of the flu but you could hardly tell from
the way she played. In her match with
Lisa Albano, Stanford's No. 1 player
recorded service breaks in the first and
seventh games before Albano got one
back to pull to within 5-3.
The California sophomore saved three
set points in the next game before
double faulting to lose the set 6-3. The
second set opened with four consecutive
service breaks before Birch took control
and scored another 6-3 win.
Albano looked sharp until she injured

her knee midway through the second
set. She was simply not as strong as
Birch who did not look at all rusty.
"I was in control of a lot of the
points," Alhano said afterward. "I did
what I wanted to do . . . but I ended
up missing a volley or overhead. I didn't
make the final shots."
While Birch was busy at No. 1, senior
Lisa Green continued her excellent play
at No. 5. Green moved ahead 6-3, 5-0
before she hit a rocky stretch and
dropped the next three games. Green
closed out the match 6-3 in the second
to become the first finisher.
On Court 2, Meredith McGrath was
matched up with Cal's much- improved
Jean Marie Lozano. An exciting battle
of serve-and-volley players was decided
in McGrath's favor by a 6-2, 6-4 score.
The Cardinal freshman is still perfect
in dual-match play.
At No. 4 singles, Teri Whitlinger han
dled Ellen Walliser 6-4, 6-1. Freshman
Heather Willens bested Lisa Parks 6-4,
6-3 at No. 6. Willens' win was Stanford's
fifth and therefore clinched the match,
but did not end the excitement.
Graham was locked in a battle with
Emilie Viqueira at No. 3 singles that
seemed like it might go either way. After
a strong first set in which Graham
scored a 6-2 victory, her ill health
seemed to catch up with her.
Viqueira capitalized on Graham's
trouble and recorded four service breaks

in a 6-1 second set. When Graham fell
behind 0-1 in the third, her 31-0 career
record in team competition appeared to
be in jeopardy.
Then suddenly, Graham got aggres
sive. She began to come in behind every
serve and attack the net when Viqueira
was serving. Graham also started to hit
the ball with the kind of power hardly
anyone in the college game can come
anywhere close to.
"She knows when to settle down. She
knows how far she can go," Coach Frank
Brennan said of Graham. "She becomes
a genius when the pressure's on." The
result was a dominant 6-1 win in the
third set and a sweep of the singles for
Stanford.
With the doubles rendered irrelevant,
one could hardly fault the Cardinal had
theyed turned in a lackadaisical effort.
Instead, the team turned in a superior
one.
McGrath and Whitlinger, the nation's
top tandem, bested Lozano and Viqueira
6-3, 6-3 at No. 1. Birch and Graham
looked perfectly healthy in a dominant
6-0, 6-4 victory against Silveria and Wal
liser. Finally, Stanford's new No. 3 team
of Green and Willens continued to look
sharp with a 6-3, 7-5 besting of Parks
and Veena Prahbaker.
