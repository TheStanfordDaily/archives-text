# Card set for first test of season
## Men's tennis faces tenacious Wildcats at National Indoors 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
After capturing all six spots in
the singles and doubles finals of
the NorCal Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships this past week,
the Stanford men's tennis team
will face its first mtyor test of the
season as it preps for a dual match
today against No. 14 Kentucky in
the second round of the
USTA/ITCA National Indoor
Team Championships in Louis
ville, Ky.
Kentucky beat Wisconsin 5-4 in
the first round yesterday. Stan
ford, the No. 1 seed in the tour
nament, received a bye into the
second round.
"This is our first big test,"
Stanford Asst. Coach John Whit
linger said. "Other teams love
beating Stanford. We are going to
try to make sure that doesn't hap
pen.
Staying alive will not be easy,
however, as the top 16 teams in
the country will be represented.
Still, Stanford Coach Dick Gould

could not have picked a better
time for the highly competitive
event. Freshmen Jared Palmer
and Alexis Hombrecher are al
most fully recovered from their
knee surgeries, and the rest of
the team is healthy.
"We are going in reasonably
healthy, and we have a very
strong team with some good
depth," Coach Dick Gould said.
"But we will find out fast whether
other teams are as strong as us."
According to Whitlinger, Stan
ford's game plan will be pretty
standard: attack and then attack
some more. "The courts in Louis

ville are fast, so that is going to
encourage us to get to net even
more," Whitlinger said. "But we
always like forcing the issue. We
like our guys to be very aggres
sive. ... You have to be on those
courts."
Whitlinger also said that the
faster courts probably will play to
Stanford's advantage against
some of the foreign competitors,
who are usually more accustomed
to slower courts.
Kentucky, which is hosting the
event, comes into the today's
match ranked No. 14 by the Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate Rankings.
