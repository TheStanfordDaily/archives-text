# U.S. soccer team takes on Soviets in preview to World Cup
## 
### Jeremy Klein 
Editor's note: This is the first in a
two-part series on Saturday's U.S.-
U.S.S.R. soccer match at Stanford.

What sporting event attracts far more
television viewers than any other? If you
answered the Super Bowl, the World Se
ries, or even the Olympics you you are
wrong.
It is soccer's World Cup which outdis
tances all other sporting spectacles in
terms of fan support. Billions of people
will turn on their televison sets starting
June 8 of this year and watch a series
of 52 games, all in Italy, over a month
long period to determine the world cham
pion.
Although the kickoff to the World Cup
is over three months away, residents of
the Bay Area can get a taste of the Cup's
pageantry and excitement this Saturday

as the United States' national team
squares off against the Soviet Union's
national team at Stanford Stadium.
The match has hardly gone unnoticed
by soccer fans in the area, as 50,000
tickets have already been sold. Promoters
of the event are expecting a final attend
ance figure of 60,000. Over 140 nations
began qualifying matches two years ago
for the twenty-four slots in the World
Cup. The first two qualifying spots were
predetermined: host Italy and defending
champion Argentina were given auto
matic bids.
The other twenty-two spots were de
termined by hundreds of qualifying
matches ending this past November. Each
world region receives an allotted amount
of teams that can qualify.
For the first time in forty years, The
United States survived the preliminary
rounds to become one of the final twenty
four teams. Going into the final match

of an five-team round robin Nov. 19,
they needed a win to qualify. When
midfielder Paul Caligiuri scored his first
goal of the series against Trinidad and
Tobago, he gave each member of the U.S.
squad a plane ticket to Italy.
Through the "luck" of the tourna
ment's draw, the Americans will meet
Cup favorite Italy, as well as Czechoslo
vakia and Austria in the first round of
the tournament. To advance further it
must finish second, or possibly third in
this group of four.
Many soccer experts doubt the team
will progress further than the first round
as they see the young Americans as the
weakest of the twenty-four teams.
Because World Cup finalists like the
U.S. and the U.S.S R. want as much prep
aration for the tournament as possible,
soccer exhibitions between national
teams leading up to the World Cup are
common. The United States has already

played matches this month against Costa
Rica (a 2-0 loss), Colombia (a penalty
shootout loss), and Bermuda (a 1-0 win).
Only 25,000 and 15,000 fans appeared,
respectively, at the Costa Rica and Colom
bia matches, both in Miami. So what is
the force that is drawing 60,000 specta
tors to Stanford Stadium on Saturday?
First, the U.S.S.R. national squad has
not played a match against the U.S. na
tional team in the United States for over
ten years. Secondly, the Soviet squad is
not Costa Rica or Bermuda.
The U.S.S.R. has peaked as a team
over the past few years. Finishing second
to the Netherlands in the 1988 European
Championships, the Soviets are consid
ered one of the favorites to win it all in
Italy. The Soviet Olympic team also won
the gold medal in Seoul in 1988. And
with their youth teams being consistently
among the top, the future for Soviet soc
cer is bright indeed.

Although not showing some of the
sparkle displayed in the European Cham
pionships, the U.S.S.R. qualified for Italy
relatively easily. Placed in a group with
Cup Holder Argentina, Romania, and
Cameroon, the Soviets should advance
pass the first round. Because of a stingy
defense and goalkeeper Rinat Dasayev,
arguably the best player in the world at
his position, the team will not surrender
many goals.
The attack is led by rising star Alexei
Mikhailichenko, who led the Soviet run
for the gold medal in Seoul. Contrary to
most Eastern European teams, Team
U.S.S.R. plays an exciting attacking game
of soccer.
Tickets for the match, taking place Sat
urday at Stanford Stadium, range from
$7 for students (general admission) to
$18 for premium reserved and are still
available.

ries, or even the Olympics you you are
wrong.
It is soccer's World Cup which outdis
tances all other sporting spectacles in
terms of fan support. Billions of people
will turn on their televison sets starting
June 8 of this year and watch a series
of 52 games, all in Italy, over a month
long period to determine the world cham
pion.
Although the kickoff to the World Cup
is over three months away, residents of
the Bay Area can get a taste of the Cup's
pageantry and excitement this Saturday

as the United States' national team
squares off against the Soviet Union's
national team at Stanford Stadium.
The match has hardly gone unnoticed
by soccer fans in the area, as 50,000
tickets have already been sold. Promoters
of the event are expecting a final attend
ance figure of 60,000. Over 140 nations
began qualifying matches two years ago
for the twenty-four slots in the World
Cup. The first two qualifying spots were
predetermined: host Italy and defending
champion Argentina were given auto
matic bids.
The other twenty-two spots were de
termined by hundreds of qualifying
matches ending this past November. Each
world region receives an allotted amount
of teams that can qualify.
For the first time in forty years, The
United States survived the preliminary
rounds to become one of the final twenty
four teams. Going into the final match

of an five-team round robin Nov. 19,
they needed a win to qualify. When
midfielder Paul Caligiuri scored his first
goal of the series against Trinidad and
Tobago, he gave each member of the U.S.
squad a plane ticket to Italy.
Through the "luck" of the tourna
ment's draw, the Americans will meet
Cup favorite Italy, as well as Czechoslo
vakia and Austria in the first round of
the tournament. To advance further it
must finish second, or possibly third in
this group of four.
Many soccer experts doubt the team
will progress further than the first round
as they see the young Americans as the
weakest of the twenty-four teams.
Because World Cup finalists like the
U.S. and the U.S.S R. want as much prep
aration for the tournament as possible,
soccer exhibitions between national
teams leading up to the World Cup are
common. The United States has already

played matches this month against Costa
Rica (a 2-0 loss), Colombia (a penalty
shootout loss), and Bermuda (a 1-0 win).
Only 25,000 and 15,000 fans appeared,
respectively, at the Costa Rica and Colom
bia matches, both in Miami. So what is
the force that is drawing 60,000 specta
tors to Stanford Stadium on Saturday?
First, the U.S.S.R. national squad has
not played a match against the U.S. na
tional team in the United States for over
ten years. Secondly, the Soviet squad is
not Costa Rica or Bermuda.
The U.S.S.R. has peaked as a team
over the past few years. Finishing second
to the Netherlands in the 1988 European
Championships, the Soviets are consid
ered one of the favorites to win it all in
Italy. The Soviet Olympic team also won
the gold medal in Seoul in 1988. And
with their youth teams being consistently
among the top, the future for Soviet soc
cer is bright indeed.

Although not showing some of the
sparkle displayed in the European Cham
pionships, the U.S.S.R. qualified for Italy
relatively easily. Placed in a group with
Cup Holder Argentina, Romania, and
Cameroon, the Soviets should advance
pass the first round. Because of a stingy
defense and goalkeeper Rinat Dasayev,
arguably the best player in the world at
his position, the team will not surrender
many goals.
The attack is led by rising star Alexei
Mikhailichenko, who led the Soviet run
for the gold medal in Seoul. Contrary to
most Eastern European teams, Team
U.S.S.R. plays an exciting attacking game
of soccer.
Tickets for the match, taking place Sat
urday at Stanford Stadium, range from
$7 for students (general admission) to
$18 for premium reserved and are still
available.
