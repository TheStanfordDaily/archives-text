# Program expansion would allow chances to serve in South Africa

Responding to recent changes
in South Africa, a Stanford public
service fellowship program may
expand to allow students to work
in that country.
The University Committee on
Community Education Initiatives
on South Africa currently spon
sors undergraduates to spend the
summer at Stanford for an intense
study of South Africa, with the
stipulation that they later share
their information with the Stan
ford community.
Through the program, now in
its third year, students have the
opportunity to work with experts
on South African issues, said
Catherine Milton, director of the
Haas Center for Public Service
and a member of the committee.
And now, students may have a
chance to work with the most in
formed experts on South Africa
â€” the South African people them
selves.
In the past, the University was
wary that students might be
detained by the South African
police.

In addition, black South African
students opposed the University
sending students to South Africa
because Stanford had not com
pletely divested, said Milton.
But "the country's recent
changes present more opportuni
ties," said History Prof. Kennell
Jackson, chair of the committee.
"The idea that anti-apartheid ac
tions are subversive is gone."
The committee would like to
have students help teach in inte
grated South African schools.
Georgetown University has
already started a similar type of
program, Milton said.
Milton hopes the fellowship pro
gram will attract more applicants.
"I'm disappointed that there
aren't more students interested,"
she said.
However, sophomore Ashok Rai,
the program's student coordina
tor, estimated that between 30
and 40 students have picked up
applications in the past week.
Much of the interest in the pro
gram is due to South Africa's
recent changes, he said.
"This year will be a great year
for a fellowship, and I think
people are realizing this," Rai
said.

In past years, students have
participated in a variety of fellow
ships. Rai returned to his home
in New Delhi, India, to give pre
sentations on South Africa in
many high schools.
Senior Camlesh Nirmul, a na
tive of South Africa, received a
fellowship to work last summer
for the United Nations in its Cen
ter Against Apartheid. The center
assigned Nirmul to an indepen
dent study on the black youth
movement in South Africa.
The center then used the results
of Nirmul's research to make rec
ommendations to the interna
tional community on what it could
do as a whole in the battle against
apartheid.
"The situation in South Africa
is 10 times worse than what the
international media is present
ing," she said.
The public is too optimistic
about the recent freeing of Nelson
Mandela, she said.
"In my opinion, he was freed
to make the international com
munity believe changes are taking
place," Nirmul added. "Nothing
has really changed in South Africa
because [blacks] still do not have
basic rights,"
