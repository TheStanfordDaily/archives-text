## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Clive Barker: 'The future of horror' 
### Kelly Parsons 
"I have seen the future of horror, and its name
is Clive Barker." — Stephen King.
The next time you glance at a New York Times
bestseller list, be sure to look over the fiction sec
tion. Nestled in between the latest Tom Clancy
techno-thriller and Danielle Steele tear-jerker, you
just might find a book by an author whose name
you vaguely recognize, but just can't quite place —
Clive Barker.
Although not as widely known as Stephen King,

many critics are now heralding Barker as the

new crown prince of horror. For the
past six years, Barker has been quietly

wrote and directed. "Hellraiser" became a
box-office hit, and was cited by many critics
as a truly innovative, original honor movie. His
latest movie, "Nightbreed" (based on "Cabal"),
opened in wide release last week.
Intermission had an opportunity to talk to
Barker on the phone earlier this week while he
was in L.A. promoting "Nightbreed".
Intermission: Why horror stories? What first got
you interested in that particular genre?
Clive Barker: First off, I think we should
analyze the term "horror." I mean, do I always
write "horror?" I don't think "Weaveworld" was
horror. I mean, I write horror stuff, but I do a
whole bunch of other things as well.

I think I write a sort of "fiction of the imagina
tion," and some of that stuff aims to horrify. One
of the interesting aspects of horror fiction to me is
how it is limited by its own terminology. What
I'm personally interested in is the imagination and
how that works. And my imagination does all
