## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Clive Barker: 'The future of horror' 
### Kelly Parsons 
"I have seen the future of horror, and its name
is Clive Barker." — Stephen King.
The next time you glance at a New York Times
bestseller list, be sure to look over the fiction sec
tion. Nestled in between the latest Tom Clancy
techno-thriller and Danielle Steele tear-jerker, you
just might find a book by an author whose name
you vaguely recognize, but just can't quite place —
Clive Barker.
Although not as widely known as Stephen King,

many critics are now heralding Barker as the

new crown prince of horror. For the
past six years, Barker has been quietly

churning out works whose
dark, brooding imagery is of
ten as revolting as it is com-

pelling, much to the
macabre delight of his
readers.

"Books of Blood," a
compilation of short
stories originally pub
lished in 1984, was
quickly followed by
several more volumes
of short stories and two

more novels, "The
Damnation Game" and
"Weaveworld." Both
novels enjoyed lengthy
stints on the bestseller
list. Barker's most

recent book, "Cabal,"
appeared on bookstore
shelves last year.
Critics have consistently
praised Barker's books for
introducing introspective,
quality literature into a genre
that is usually not taken very
seriously.

In 1987, Barker made the leap to the
movie screen with "Hellraiser," a film he
wrote and directed. "Hellraiser" became a
box-office hit, and was cited by many critics
as a truly innovative, original honor movie. His
latest movie, "Nightbreed" (based on "Cabal"),
opened in wide release last week.
Intermission had an opportunity to talk to
Barker on the phone earlier this week while he
was in L.A. promoting "Nightbreed".
Intermission: Why horror stories? What first got
you interested in that particular genre?
Clive Barker: First off, I think we should
analyze the term "horror." I mean, do I always
write "horror?" I don't think "Weaveworld" was
horror. I mean, I write horror stuff, but I do a
whole bunch of other things as well.

I think I write a sort of "fiction of the imagina
tion," and some of that stuff aims to horrify. One
of the interesting aspects of horror fiction to me is
how it is limited by its own terminology. What
I'm personally interested in is the imagination and
how that works. And my imagination does all

kinds of weird shit, and always
has. I think it's probably genetic.
I: How would 'you respond to
Stephen King's quote calling you
"the future of horror?"
CB: Steve made that remark
shortly after my early stuff had
come out, when my work to that
date very much fell under the cat
egory of horror. I think the only
thing I'm really the future of is
the future of Clive Barker. My im
agination has taken all kinds of
directions since, and I enioy that
sort of spread of adventures.
I: Most of your works deal with
the concept of evil. What is your
perception of evil, and how does
that affect the way you portray it?
CB: In my books, evil often has
a human face, and evil takes place
within people who seem to be able
to put on a show of humanity,
but in actual fact are corrupt un
derneath, like Shadwell in
"Weaveworld," for example, or
Decker in "Nightbreed."
I: A lot of times, though, these
corrupt individuals, the real
"monsters" in your stories, turn
out to be authority figures. What
kind of message are you sending
here regarding representatives of
the forces of order?
CB: I'm certainly casting doubt
over the people who set the rules,

because they're probably setting
them with agendas that are not to
everyone's advantage. If somebody
says not to do something, then
you naturally question why you
can't, right?
People say "don't." Why? What
does it mean when people say don't
look or don't question? It usually
means that they want power over
you in some way. And that power
can be over your imagination, your
sexuality, your lifestyle, your
nationality . . . we're always being
told not to question things, and I
like to point out how easy it is
become passive under this system.
I: Why did you first decide to
do films?
CB: For the fun of it. The fact
that I like to work with other
people and have a good time had
a lot to do with it. I sincerely enjoy
making movies. I take a lot of
criticism for it, but I get a lot of
criticism no matter what I do. A
lot of people take a hatchet to my
books simply because they don't
do what people conventionally ex
pect books to do. The same goes
for my movies.
I: So which do you enjoy more,
writing books or making movies?
CB: Writing, without a doubt.
I'll continue to make movies, but
I'll probably end up doing two
more books before I do another
movie. Toward the end of my life,
I'm sure that there will be a lot
more books of mine floating
around than movies.

more books before I do another
movie. Toward the end of my life,
I'm sure that there will be a lot
more books of mine floating
around than movies.
"I have seen the future of horror, and its name
is Clive Barker." — Stephen King.
The next time you glance at a New York Times
bestseller list, be sure to look over the fiction sec
tion. Nestled in between the latest Tom Clancy
techno-thriller and Danielle Steele tear-jerker, you
just might find a book by an author whose name
you vaguely recognize, but just can't quite place —
Clive Barker.
Although not as widely known as Stephen King,

many critics are now heralding Barker as the

new crown prince of horror. For the
past six years, Barker has been quietly

churning out works whose
dark, brooding imagery is of
ten as revolting as it is com-

pelling, much to the
macabre delight of his
readers.

more novels, "The
Damnation Game" and
"Weaveworld." Both
novels enjoyed lengthy
stints on the bestseller
list. Barker's most

recent book, "Cabal,"
appeared on bookstore
shelves last year.
Critics have consistently
praised Barker's books for
introducing introspective,
quality literature into a genre
that is usually not taken very
seriously.

In 1987, Barker made the leap to the
movie screen with "Hellraiser," a film he
wrote and directed. "Hellraiser" became a
box-office hit, and was cited by many critics
as a truly innovative, original honor movie. His
latest movie, "Nightbreed" (based on "Cabal"),
opened in wide release last week.
Intermission had an opportunity to talk to
Barker on the phone earlier this week while he
was in L.A. promoting "Nightbreed".
Intermission: Why horror stories? What first got
you interested in that particular genre?
Clive Barker: First off, I think we should
analyze the term "horror." I mean, do I always
write "horror?" I don't think "Weaveworld" was
horror. I mean, I write horror stuff, but I do a
whole bunch of other things as well.

I think I write a sort of "fiction of the imagina
tion," and some of that stuff aims to horrify. One
of the interesting aspects of horror fiction to me is
how it is limited by its own terminology. What
I'm personally interested in is the imagination and
how that works. And my imagination does all

kinds of weird shit, and always
has. I think it's probably genetic.
I: How would 'you respond to
Stephen King's quote calling you
"the future of horror?"
CB: Steve made that remark
shortly after my early stuff had
come out, when my work to that
date very much fell under the cat
egory of horror. I think the only
thing I'm really the future of is
the future of Clive Barker. My im
agination has taken all kinds of
directions since, and I enioy that
sort of spread of adventures.
I: Most of your works deal with
the concept of evil. What is your
perception of evil, and how does
that affect the way you portray it?
CB: In my books, evil often has
a human face, and evil takes place
within people who seem to be able
to put on a show of humanity,
but in actual fact are corrupt un
derneath, like Shadwell in
"Weaveworld," for example, or
Decker in "Nightbreed."
I: A lot of times, though, these
corrupt individuals, the real
"monsters" in your stories, turn
out to be authority figures. What
kind of message are you sending
here regarding representatives of
the forces of order?
CB: I'm certainly casting doubt
over the people who set the rules,

because they're probably setting
them with agendas that are not to
everyone's advantage. If somebody
says not to do something, then
you naturally question why you
can't, right?
People say "don't." Why? What
does it mean when people say don't
look or don't question? It usually
means that they want power over
you in some way. And that power
can be over your imagination, your
sexuality, your lifestyle, your
nationality . . . we're always being
told not to question things, and I
like to point out how easy it is
become passive under this system.
I: Why did you first decide to
do films?
CB: For the fun of it. The fact
that I like to work with other
people and have a good time had
a lot to do with it. I sincerely enjoy
making movies. I take a lot of
criticism for it, but I get a lot of
criticism no matter what I do. A
lot of people take a hatchet to my
books simply because they don't
do what people conventionally ex
pect books to do. The same goes
for my movies.
I: So which do you enjoy more,
writing books or making movies?
CB: Writing, without a doubt.
I'll continue to make movies, but
I'll probably end up doing two
more books before I do another
movie. Toward the end of my life,
I'm sure that there will be a lot
more books of mine floating
around than movies.
