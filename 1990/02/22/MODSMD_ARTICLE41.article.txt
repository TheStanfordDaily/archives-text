# 'Vinegar Tom' director plays up contemporary feminist issues
## 
### Anita Schneider Staff writer 
Growing up in a fundamentalist
Christian home in Atlanta, Ga.,
Denise Boling was taught that
"women are to be seen and not
heard, just as children are." Now
a Stanford graduate student, Boling
is directing "Vinegar Tom," an ag
gressively feminist drama.
"It's amazing how passionate I
feel about directing and how much
energy that gives me," she says.
"The play confronts issues that are
close to home for me right now,
as a budding young feminist."
"Vinegar Tom," by British
playwnght Carol Churchill, ad
dresses the brutal witch hunts in
mid-17th-century England What's
unusual about "Vinegar Tom" is
the way it relates the persecution
of witches to contemporary
feminist issues.
Throughout the show, bonneted,
corseted characters step out of their
roles to don stylish contemporary
outfits and sing songs laced with
emotion, anger, and hard-hitting
truths. The original music has
been adapted for the stage by Stan
ford music maior Debbie Wicks.
The lyncs of "Nobody Sings"
touch on women losing their

beauty and value
to society. "Evil
Women," one of
the more verbally
aggressive songs,
blasts the deeply
rooted view of
woman as temp
tress, seductress,
and instrument of
the devil.

"If Everybody Worked as Hard
as Me" descnbcs the expectations
which society imposes on women
Nobody loves a scold/nobody loves
a slut/nobody loves you when
you re old/unless you 're someone's
gran.
Boling recalls her initial expo
sure to feminist issues at Stanford:
"At first, I was very leery of
feminism. As 1 began to read crit
ically, though, I discovered the per
spective of the class structure.
Women, as a class, are still being
discriminated against in many
ways."
"In the 17th-century world,"
Boling adds, "feminism is viewed
from a very political point of view.
The town citizens accuse, per
secute, and finally murder mem
bers of its community — the
undesirable females. In the songs
we have a very different thing going

on, and that's where the juxtaposi
tion happens. The songs in
'Vinegar Tom' are about our lives
today."
Most of the characters in
"Vinegar Tom" are tenant farmers.
Women who conform with the
rules of society are safe from the
witch hunters, but all other
females are suspect. "It's my con
tention in the play that the witch
hunts were motivated by a variety
of factors," says Boling, "including
a common fear of strangely inde
pendent women."
The accusations of lack (lan
McCrudden), a villager who
blames his impotence on the spell
of a witch, originally catalyze the
witch hunts.
Boling says her own feelings
about society's inequities toward
women compel her to speak out.
"Directing 'Vinegar Tom' is a big
way ot doing something about it,"
she says.

"Vinegar Tom" will be performed
in the Uttle Theater at Memorial
Hall. Wednesday through Saturday
nights at 8 p.m., Feb. 21-24 and
Feh. 28 March 3. Tickets are avail
able m advance at Tresidder Ticket
