# Intermission clarification
## 
### 
Some of Intermission's less-intelligent, unthinking readers have
commented that the section's new l-to-10 rating system is unclear
and difficult to understand. For them, this chart should eliminate
any confusion:
O Very bad
0 A little bit better than 1; not as good as 3
© A little bit better than 2; not as good as 4
O A little bit better than 3; not as good as 5
© Fair to middlin'
© Better than 5; not quite as good as 7
O Better than 6; not quite as good as 8
© Better than 7; not quite as good as 9
© Better than 8; not quite as good as 10
© Incredibly brilliant.
For most of you this chart will be completely unnecessary,
since Intermission readers are generally 10s and probably under
stood the ratings at first glance. But we must accomodate some
of our slower readers, as it may take them a couple weeks to
catch on.
Please bear with them.
