## Basta Pasta charms with elegant cuisine 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
The two biggest problems facing
a typical college student are often
homesickness and Food Service
sickness.
But nestled on the side streets
of San Francisco lies Basta Pasta,
a paragon of Italian cuisine. Basta
Pasta is a delight for the stomach
as well as a treat for the spirit;
owner Peter Petroni treats each
customer like a member of his own
family, with sincerity, friendliness,
and warmth.
Petroni's charm matches the res
taurant's atmosphere, which looks
like a cozy house. The first level
of dining boasts an expansive bar
and Basta Pasta's famous wood
burning oven, where its pizzas are
carefully cooked. Upstairs, the el
egant dining area offers a more
intimate, romantic atmosphere.
But both levels allow enjoyment
of perhaps the finest Italian dishes
in all of San Francisco. Even the
salads are arranged with care, from
the lone carrot strand to the tangy
house dressing. All of Basta Pasta's
dishes look like works of art. How
ever, don't let the delicate arrang
ments fool you ; although the pasta
dishes are not overwhelming
mounds, the entrees are as aes
thetically appealing as they are
satiating.
All of the pasta is homemade,

and many of the dishes are crea
tions of Petroni's own family. The
Tortellini Porcini includes mush
rooms which are handpicked by
Petroni himself, then frozen while
wet to retain the flavor.
Basta Pasta's menu also boasts
equally fabulous seafood dishes, of
ten uncommon for a pasta restau
rant. The rex sole, the restaurant's
"catch of the day," was served on
a large, fish-shaped platter,
adorned with lightly-seasoned veg
etables.
The wide variety of specialties
and romantic atmosphere make
Basta Pasta a perfect spot for a
formal affair as well as a casual
dinner. Additionally, Basta Pasta
remains open until 1:45 a.m. each
night, late enough for one to catch
one of their incredible desserts,
such as the sinfully-rich chocolate
cheesecake.
Basta Pasta is the ideal refuge
for the Bay Area student. With
such warmth, friendliness, and in
credible cuisine, it feels almost bet
ter than home.

Basta Pasta is located at 1268
Grant Avenue in San Francisco,
at the corner of Grant and Vallejo.
For reservations, call 434-2248.
