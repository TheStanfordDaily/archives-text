# Traditional Gatehouse a way to special dining

"Hey, fancy place," noted Mike
as we walked to our seats. He
glanced down at the napkins folded
into neat designs on the table.
"Look! Hats!" he yelled, placing
one on top of his head.
Fortunately, the food, service,
and atmosphere at the Gatehouse
more than compensated for my
company.
One is first struck by the aura
of "casual elegance" at Gatehouse,-
although the soft candlelight, an
tique decor, and grandiose napkin
formations contribute to a stiff,
quiet formality, the cozy fire and
upbeat music also invite a more
relaxed sensation.
After taking our seats and pass
ing on the comprehensive wine list,
we began with sauteed mush
rooms. These were possibly some
of the tastiest little doo-dads I've
enjoyed in a while — and 1 don't
even like mushrooms. The house
salad was simple and unpreten
tious.

The entrees themselves consist
of a traditional selection — pasta,
fish, chicken, steak, and veal —
in a variety of styles. Served with
rice and cooked vegetables, por
tions are appropriately designed to
satiate, not to overwhelm.
Gatehouse provides a fantastic
dinner that should meet anyone's
expectations. Prices are probably a
bit steep for the average student;
entrees range from $9 for some
pasta dishes to over $20 for the
Veal Oscar. The subdued atmos
phere on off-nights may also not
lend itself well to the average group
of loud-mouthed collegiates. How
ever, for special occasions, formal
dates, and a night out with the
parents, Gatehouse is ideal.

Gatehouse is located at 265 Lytton
Ave. in Palo Alto. Call 326-1330
for reservations.
