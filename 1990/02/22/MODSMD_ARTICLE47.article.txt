# One-Junebug show jabs the status quo

### Martha Brockenbrough Editorial staff 
just like there's more than one
way to skin a cat, there's more
than one way to change the
world. John O'Neal, who plays
Junebug Jabbo Jones, will show
how he has worked for the past
25 years to change the unhealthy
"diet of society."
Playing in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium tonight through Saturday
night, "Sayings from the Life and
Writings of Junebug Jabbo Jones"
is a three-part dramatic series
chronicling the hardships faced
by black Americans from the
Civil War through the Civil
Rights movement of the '50s and
'60s. O'Neal doesn't describe his
work as "high art." Rather, he
calls it a collection of stories that
stand for the "wisdom of the
common people."
The Junebug character that
O'Neal created more than 25
years ago when he took part in
the Civil Rights movement rep
resents that homespun wisdom.
As Jones explains on stage, he is
"a storyteller, not a liar. A liar
covers things over, but a storytel
ler uncovers things so everybody
can get something good out of it."
The revelations begin at 8 p.m.
tonight with Volume I, "Don't

start me to talking or I'll tell
everything I know." This first seg
ment paints a picture of the wis
dom that flourished among black
Americans during the 19th cen
tury, despite the oppression they
endured.
The series continues tomorrow
with "You can't judge a book by
looking at the cover/' where Jones
travels from the backwoods Mis
sissippi of his youth to Chicago
in the racially traumatic '50s and
'60s.
Volume 111 introduces
Grammy Award-winner Michael
Keck as a singer, actor and com
poser. In "Ain't no use in going
home, lodie's got your gal and
gone," Keck and O 'Neal portray
the ironic struggle that blacks
have endured during this cen
tury's wars: the fight to join the
military, and the battle against
racism that had to be fought once
in the armed forces.
Although each volume focuses
primarily on black history, Keck
and O'Neal explained that their
work deals with facets of human
rights and oppression that affect
all human beings.
Political content is crucial to
the power of art, O'Neal ex
plained, "The only art that isn't
political is that which sides with
the ruling power."
