# Jacques explores philosophy, sex and revenge
## 
### Alison Gerson 
Add sex and revenge to the work of an 18th
century French philosophe and an exiled Czech
oslovakian writer, and the result is "lacques
and his Master," now playing at the Magic
Theatre.
Milan Kundera's variation on Denis Diderot's
novel, "Jacques the Fatalist," combines
philosphical musing with raunchy good humor
in an exploration of human relationships. The
story centers around the aimless travels of
Jacques and his master through 18th-century
France. Jacques comments, "Everything that
happens down here is written on high."
Kundera's comment on the question of free
will is particularly interesting when juxtaposed
with his personal experiences. He wrote the
play while living under the totalitarian regime
in Czechoslovakia, and never honestly believed
that the play would ever be produced.

Kundera's drama, though, is far from a
depressing meditation on predestination.
Jacques and his master distract themselves
from the painful truths "written on high" by
recounting bawdy stories of their past loves.
Lewd tales such as Jacques' deflowering appear
before us on an 18th-century stage complete
with ropes, cranks, and pulleys.
The characters move back and forth between
their positions in front of the stage, acting out
their tales and then stepping down to comment
on them. Slowly, the atmosphere becomes
raucous and festive, as the two anxiously in
terrupt each other's tales.
All of the stones in "Jacques and his Master"
involve love and betrayal between intimate
friends. However, the principal relationship of
the play goes beyond these petty concerns.
Unlike a typical master/apprentice relationship,
the two cannot live apart.
Although the master has status and power,

Jacques retains his substance and indepen
dence, and even chooses which orders to obey.
In the Magic Theatre's production, Jacques is
black while the master is white, further ques
tioning traditional assumptions about subordi
nation and superiority.
The Magic Theatre's production of "Jacques
and his Master" is pure enjoyment. As the
master, Bruce Williams portrays true tender
ness toward Jacques (Hansford Prince). Prince
is good-natured and gently mocking of his weak
master. Sometimes, however, Prince swallowes
his words, making it difficult to understand
him. Larry Henderson, also gives a hysterical
performance as the Marquis des Arcis, whose
libido takes control of his life.

"Jacques and his Master" runs through March
25 at the Magic Theatre at Fort Mason in San
Francisco. $11 student discount tickets are
