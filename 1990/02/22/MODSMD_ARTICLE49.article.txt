## Mission possible: Innocence found in romantic musical imagery 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Innocence, once lost, can never be
regained.
But after listening to the earthy, roman
tic music of the Innocence Mission, the
childhood images of naivete, simplicity,
and wonder are so strikingly vivid that it
seems like purity is actually attainable.
Credit the band's incredible lyrics on
their self-titled debut album, filled with
powerful allegories and imagery. Many of
the songs depict issues of faith and family,
with influences that can be traced back
to the band's hometown, the Amish farm
town of Lancaster, Pa.
Or perhaps one could praise the band's
musical talent, stretching from the crisp
drums of Steve Brown to the soothing
guitars of Don Peris and Mike Bitts to
the ethereal voice of Karen Peris. With a
style that resembles Kate Bush, Peris' im
pressive vocal range easily handles the
band's interlocking melodies and har
monies.
Whatever the reason, the Innocence
Mission is definitely a band to which credit
is due. "Black Sheep Wall," one of the
album's finest tracks, exemplifies the
group's ability to combine eloquent lyrics
with ethereal music. Recent critical ac
claim of the Innocence Mission includes
praise from Rolling Stone, People, The
New Yorker, The Los Angeles Times, and
The Village Voice, which called Peris' voice
"one of the prettiest things to happen to
American pop."
And with their upcoming date at the
Coffee House on Saturday, Stanford may
be yet another big break for the Innocence
Mission (remember what happened to the
Indigo Girls after last year?). Intermission
caught up with guitarist and songwriter

Don Peris in Chicago earlier this month.
Intermission: Where did the name of
the band come from?
Don Peris: "The Innocence Mission" is
a name that Karen thought up. We all
wanted a name with a visual image. 1
think of an Inncence Mission as a place
everyone can go to for personal refuge.
I: How did the four of you come to
gether?
DP: All four of us met at Lancaster
Catholic High School. After we graduated
in 1982, we decided that we wanted to
keep playing togther, even though we all
went to different colleges for a while. But
all four of us share a common passion
for music.
We had no idea how to start other than
just playing in garages. We started doing
clubs in Philadelphia and Washington,
D.C. until we had written a lot of songs
and taped some of them. Finally, we signed
with A&M Records in 1988.
I: It seems like a lot of the reviews
make allusions of the band to Kate Bush.
DP: Yeah, and I like her, but I really
don't see or hear the parallel. I'm flattered,
because I like her a lot, but I think of my
influences as Peter Gabriel, Cocteau
Twins, U2, the Waterboys, and the
Beatles.
We have many literary influences, too,
because we all like to read a lot. Karen
likes Virgina Woolf. I like C.S. Lewis,
Dickens, and Tolstoy. Reading really puts
me in a creative frame of mind. I like
writing lyrics right after I finish reading,
because my mind is still working.
I: The Village Voice claimed that the
Innocence Mission would derive a lot of
appeal from the "Thirtysomething crowd."
Do you agree?
DP: I found that article really ridiculous

and disgusting. I've never even seen the
show, and neither has Karen. I see our
appeal coming from college audiences,
mostly younger people. We aren't aiming
for mainstream music or commercial
fame, and we don't think about targeting
our songs to a certain audience. But on
this tour, we have received a warm re
sponse from the college crowds.
I: Rolling Stone said that "Black Sheep
Wall" was a "brother and sister song."
DP: Yeah, Karen wrote this for her
younger brother, from the point of view
of an overprotective sister watching her
younger brother go through the trials of
growing up. "Black Sheep Wall" represents
the distance between the siblings.
I: But sometimes, the imagery of the
lyrics is perhaps too cryptic to be recog
nized or interpreted.
DP: That's true. "I Remember Me" is
about a woman named Anna Anderson
who claimed to be Anastasia Romanov,
the daughter of Czar Nicholas II of Russia.
The whole royal family was supposedly
executed in 1918. Years after that, this
girl turned up claiming her identity, and
her whole life became a struggle to prove
her claim.

I had one guy come up to me and say,
"Hooray for you. With all these bands
writing about social issues and political
commentaries, it's nice to see somebody
writing about remembering themselves."
I just thanked him.
I: What's it like to receive such wide
spread critical acclaim?
DP: I don't even think that we are aware
of the fame yet. We're still busy from

touring and writing songs for our next
album. We have a lot of songs which we
will introduce on this tour. I'm just anx
ious to go back to Lancaster in April.
The English poet W.B. Yeats said, "The
innocent and the beautiful have no enemy
but time." For the Innocence Mission,
success is almost assured. It truly is just
a matter of time.


Innocence Mission, which just released its self-titled debut album, will play at

for mainstream music or commercial
fame, and we don't think about targeting
our songs to a certain audience. But on
this tour, we have received a warm re
sponse from the college crowds.
I: Rolling Stone said that "Black Sheep
Wall" was a "brother and sister song."
DP: Yeah, Karen wrote this for her
younger brother, from the point of view
of an overprotective sister watching her
younger brother go through the trials of
growing up. "Black Sheep Wall" represents
the distance between the siblings.
I: But sometimes, the imagery of the
lyrics is perhaps too cryptic to be recog
nized or interpreted.
DP: That's true. "I Remember Me" is
about a woman named Anna Anderson
who claimed to be Anastasia Romanov,
the daughter of Czar Nicholas II of Russia.
The whole royal family was supposedly
executed in 1918. Years after that, this
girl turned up claiming her identity, and
her whole life became a struggle to prove
her claim.

I had one guy come up to me and say,
"Hooray for you. With all these bands
writing about social issues and political
commentaries, it's nice to see somebody
writing about remembering themselves."
I just thanked him.
I: What's it like to receive such wide
spread critical acclaim?
DP: I don't even think that we are aware
of the fame yet. We're still busy from

touring and writing songs for our next
album. We have a lot of songs which we
will introduce on this tour. I'm just anx
ious to go back to Lancaster in April.
The English poet W.B. Yeats said, "The
innocent and the beautiful have no enemy
but time." For the Innocence Mission,
success is almost assured. It truly is just
a matter of time.


Innocence Mission, which just released its self-titled debut album, will play at
the Coffee House Feb. 24. The band members are: drummer Steve Brown, lead
singer Karen Peris, guitarist Don Peris and bass guitarist Mike Bitts.
Innocence, once lost, can never be
regained.
But after listening to the earthy, roman
tic music of the Innocence Mission, the
childhood images of naivete, simplicity,
and wonder are so strikingly vivid that it
seems like purity is actually attainable.
Credit the band's incredible lyrics on
their self-titled debut album, filled with
powerful allegories and imagery. Many of
the songs depict issues of faith and family,
with influences that can be traced back
to the band's hometown, the Amish farm
town of Lancaster, Pa.
Or perhaps one could praise the band's
musical talent, stretching from the crisp
drums of Steve Brown to the soothing
guitars of Don Peris and Mike Bitts to
the ethereal voice of Karen Peris. With a
style that resembles Kate Bush, Peris' im
pressive vocal range easily handles the
band's interlocking melodies and har
monies.
Whatever the reason, the Innocence
Mission is definitely a band to which credit
is due. "Black Sheep Wall," one of the
album's finest tracks, exemplifies the
group's ability to combine eloquent lyrics
with ethereal music. Recent critical ac
claim of the Innocence Mission includes
praise from Rolling Stone, People, The
New Yorker, The Los Angeles Times, and
The Village Voice, which called Peris' voice
"one of the prettiest things to happen to
American pop."
And with their upcoming date at the
Coffee House on Saturday, Stanford may
be yet another big break for the Innocence
Mission (remember what happened to the
Indigo Girls after last year?). Intermission
caught up with guitarist and songwriter

Don Peris in Chicago earlier this month.
Intermission: Where did the name of
the band come from?
Don Peris: "The Innocence Mission" is
a name that Karen thought up. We all
wanted a name with a visual image. 1
think of an Inncence Mission as a place
everyone can go to for personal refuge.
I: How did the four of you come to
gether?
DP: All four of us met at Lancaster
Catholic High School. After we graduated
in 1982, we decided that we wanted to
keep playing togther, even though we all
went to different colleges for a while. But
all four of us share a common passion
for music.
We had no idea how to start other than
just playing in garages. We started doing
clubs in Philadelphia and Washington,
D.C. until we had written a lot of songs
and taped some of them. Finally, we signed
with A&M Records in 1988.
I: It seems like a lot of the reviews
make allusions of the band to Kate Bush.
DP: Yeah, and I like her, but I really
don't see or hear the parallel. I'm flattered,
because I like her a lot, but I think of my
influences as Peter Gabriel, Cocteau
Twins, U2, the Waterboys, and the
Beatles.
We have many literary influences, too,
because we all like to read a lot. Karen
likes Virgina Woolf. I like C.S. Lewis,
Dickens, and Tolstoy. Reading really puts
me in a creative frame of mind. I like
writing lyrics right after I finish reading,
because my mind is still working.
I: The Village Voice claimed that the
Innocence Mission would derive a lot of
appeal from the "Thirtysomething crowd."
Do you agree?
DP: I found that article really ridiculous
