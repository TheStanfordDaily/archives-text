# Webb Ranch workers lack benefits
## Medical insurance not covered by membership in USW

Webb Ranch worker Cointa Mendoza
was having trouble breathing and was
suffering from pains all over her body
when she walked into the emergency
room of Stanford Hospital yesterday.
Despite her illness, the 68-year-old
woman worried about being turned
away from the hospital. Without any
medical insurance or medical benefits
program from her employer, Mendoza
could not afford to pay for her treat
ment.
Mendoza does agricultural work at
Webb Ranch with her husband, Tiburcio
Cabrera Mejias. Despite union represen
tation for the past ten months, ranch
workers still do not have guaranteed
benefits of any kind from their employ
er, including medical coverage and re

tirement pension.
The United Stanford Workers' agree
ment with the University provides for
full medical coverage for all workers
employed more than three-quarters
time. The contract also specifies full
dental coverage and retirement pension.
Webb Ranch workers, however, are not
covered under the agreement.
Despite her concerns, Mendoza did
not actually face the prospect of being
rejected from the hospital. Because she
is over 65 years old, Mendoza is eligible
for state funds to pay for her treatment.
If patients without medical coverage
request medical attention, there are a
number of alternative means of financ
ing the treatment, according to Paul
Kuerth, a financial counselor at Stan
ford Hospital.
Medi-Cal, a form of state health in
surance. will provide full coverage on a

need basis for those patients without
insurance who fit the qualifications of
being under 21 years old or over 65,
having dependent children or having a
long-term disability, Kuerth said.
Those patients not covered by Medi-
Cal can usually be covered by medical
programs at the county level, provided
they are residents of the county and
have incomes below the poverty level.
Workers who are even slightly over
the poverty level, however, would have
to pay the full bill for their medical
treatment, Kuerth said. The USW has
been seeking Webb Ranch coverage to
protect these workers from escalating
medical costs, USW field representative
Rodney Barnette said.
Four years ago, many Webb Ranch
workers were ineligible for medical cov-
