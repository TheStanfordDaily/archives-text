# 'Velvet' suits silky smooth Myles

Move over Nancy and Ann Wil
son. A new siren has come from
Canada to take your places on the
female pop rock scene.
On her self-titled debut album,
Alannah Myles proves her vocal
versatility with the silky smooth
feel of "Black Velvet," the scratchy
straight-ahead bite of "Still Got
This Thing" and the infectious pop
hooks of "If You Want To."
In a business that often
prioritizes a woman's mini-skirt fit
to the sound of her voice — wit
ness the examples of Vixen and
others — it is refreshing to find a
smart album by a talented
musician get through.
The album's first single and
most alluring song, "Black Velvet,"

is receiving ample airplay and may
bring Myles the attention she
deserves with her strong first effort.
The praise should not end there,
however, as Myles is no one-hit
wonder.
With its well-moderated guitar
hooks, catchy bass beat and Myles
smooth vocals, "Love Is" will prob
ably the next single.
An even better choice would be
"If You Want To," a well-directed
critique of male impatience in new
relationships. "Every man I meet
is in a hurry/ To find a new
romance/ Always want to leave the
party early/ Maybe I like to dance."
Lyrically, Myles avoids the de
pendence on clichds that has per
vaded much of today's "hard" rock
music, thanks to lon Bon Jovi's
sorry example. Although she is no
spokesperson about the social, po-

litical and environmental state of
the world, she brings a fresh per
spective with lyrics from the heart
— not the thesaurus.
Occasionally, Myles vears away
from her strengths; "Kick Start My
Heart" is an example of what she
should avoid in future ventures,
as her seductive voice gets drowned
out by synchronized backing vocals
and gratuitous guitar solos.
On the whole, though, Myles
brings a renewed sophistication to
the world of female rock, some
thing which an emphasis on looks
rather than talent often prevents.
As Myles sings in "Black Velvet,"
she offers "a new religion that'll
bring you to your knees."
