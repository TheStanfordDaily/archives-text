## House-guest story fails in 'Badhouse' 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
If you even think of seeing the
film "Madhouse," resist the desire
as you would the urge to get herpes;
films like this are the sexually
transmitted diseases of Hollywood.
The constipated animation that
is the title sequence serves as a
warning sign for the rest of the
movie. The film opens with
lovebirds Mark (John Larroquette)
and Jessie (Kirstie Alley) Bannister
rolling around in bed. Their scenes
appear more incestuous than
amorous. Believing that Larro
quette and Alley would ever marry
stretches the limits of even science
fiction.
A bouillabaisse of bad ideas, the
rest of the film attempts to portray
a comic worst-case scenario for
having houseguests. There is not
that much to the plot besides the
fact that Mark and Jessie lose con
trol of their house. Stupid sub-plots
account for most of the film's dis
mal 90 minutes.
Both Mark and Jessie are in the
midst of promotions in their repul
sively chic careers. Amazingly
enough, even though their job
performances probably could not
keep them on the payroll of a
McDonald's, everything ends hap
pily, with both yuppies getting even

bigger promotions.
As a "rising young financial
planner," Larroquette does a
reprise of his role as Dan Fielding
on "Night Court." Dennis Miller
of "Saturday Night Live" makes a
couple of uninspired cameos. And
once again, Alley proves her best
work thus far has been as Rebecca
Howe on "Cheers."
A substantial amount of time is
expended on a cat that nobody can
seem to kill. During the course of
the film, the pussy drowns, is run
over by a car, gets blown up, and
even overdoses on .cocaine. Even
for a sadist, the cat scenes are not
funny.
"Madhouse" is essentially a
deluded version of one of NBC's
"movies of the week," in which
television's lesser known "stars"
are sprinkled together along with
a storyline aimed at fourth-graders.
The press kit states that
writer/director Tom Ropelewski
graduated from Dartmouth. I knew
that winters were rough up there,
but they must have really done a
number on Ropelewski. Anyone
who thinks that "Madhouse" is
even mildly entertaining has really
come unhinged.

John Larroquette and Kirstie Alley star as Mark and Jessie Bannister
in the poorly put-together comedy about houseguests that turn the
Bannister residence Into a "Madhouse."
