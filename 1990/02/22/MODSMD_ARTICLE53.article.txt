# Haphazard 'Nightbreed' not Barker's best

They just don't make horror movies like
they used to.
These days, Hollywood tends to favor bank
able, low-budget slasher films along the lines
of a "Friday the 13th" or "A Nightmare on
Elm Street" sequel, the type of movie which
relies on high body-counts and campy dialogue
to keep movie-goers entertained.
Still, one would expect more than a run-of
the-mill blood orgy from the likes of au
thor/filmmaker Clive Barker, a highly acclaimed
writer whom Stephen King has personally
praised as "the future of horror."
Barker's novels have earned him rave reviews
and a reputation as a composer of "serious"
horror. His first cincmatic effort, the 1987 film
"Hellraiser" (which Barker wrote and directed),
was both a critical and financial success. Un
fortunately, Barker's latest outing as a director,
"Nightbreed," is an incomprehensible mess.
"Nightbreed," based on Barker's 1988 novel
"Cabal," relates the story of Boone (Craig Schef
fer), a young man who believes he has com
mitted a series of brutal murders. Boone
searches for a legendary city known as Midian,
a sanctuary where "all sins are forgiven."

'Nightbreed' is rife with
aimless scenes that serve
no discernible purpose, bla
tant plot inconsistencies,
and uninspired dialogue.

Soon, Boone discovers Midian, hidden far
beneath a remote cemetery, and learns that it
is inhabited by the Nightbreed, an ancient race
of creatures driven underground by mankind's
relentless persecution. Complicating matters
are Boone's ever-inquisitive girlfriend Lori
(Anne Bobby), a psychopathic psychiatrist
(maniacally portrayed by "The Fly" director
David Cronenbcrg), and a sadistic cop named
Eigerman (Charles Haid), all of whom become
obsessed with discovering the secret of Midian.
Yet, the story unfolds in such a haphazard
way that it soon becomes impossible to follow.

to character with little rhyme or reason, blindly
groping its way along to an inconclusive finale.
Whatever message Barker seeks to convey in
this film becomes lost in a hopeless tangle of
confusing religious symbolism, climaxing with
a perverse and apparently meaningless imita
tion of the Crucifixion and Resurrection. Fur
thermore, "Nightbreed" is rife with aimless
scenes that serve no discernible purpose, bla
tant plot inconsistencies, and uninspired
dialogue.
The technical aspects of the film are as
poorly executed as the writing and direction.
The makeup effects are, at best, mediocre; the
appearances of the various Nightbreed monsters
are dull and unimaginative. Even the special
effects prove unconvincing and often comical.
And Danny Elfman's laclduster musical score
contains none of the frantic energy that char
acterized his soundtracks for "Beetlejuice" and
"Batman."
But the biggest problem of "Nightbreed" is
that it is simply not scary. After this outing,
Barker should consider sticking to books.
