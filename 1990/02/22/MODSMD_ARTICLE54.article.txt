Glory
Nominated for five Academy Awards, including Denzel Wash
ington for Best Supporting Actor, this film says more about the
Civil War itself than "Gone With The Wind" ever did.
Driving Miss Daisy
No sex, no violence, no moronic humor, just nine Academy
Award nominations. However, don't mistake "Driving Miss Daisy"
for the cinematic equivalent of Dramamine. The film showcases
two outstanding performances by Jessica Tandy and Morgan
Freeman, and holds one's attention for the entire length of the film.
Born On The Fourth Of July
Tom Cruise gives a performance full of rage and heart. The
film itself is like having a tooth drilled with no anesthetic: every
frame commands your attention, yet you would not want to go
through the experience again.
Roger & Me
Snubbed by the folks at the Academy, filmmaker Michael Moore
now has to console himself with the $3 million Warner Brothers
paid him for the rights to his film. More of a propaganda film
than a documentary, "Roger & Me" is a hilarious hatchet job on
General Motors' CEO Roger Smith.
Henry V
Called the new Laurence Olivier, Kenneth Branagh follows his
predecessor's lead and turns in an Academy Award-nominated
performance. Branagh also received a nomination for directing
this re-adaptation of Shakespeare's play.
