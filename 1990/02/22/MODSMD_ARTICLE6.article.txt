# Administration:
## Budget slashing" won't slow UCMI's progress 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
Despite an impending $22 mil
lion slash from the University's
operating budget, implementation
of UCMI report recommendations
will not be significantly affected,
administrators said.
More than half of the recom
mendations of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
were implemented by the end of
last year, and the rest are cur
rently underway, according to
Cecilia Burciaga, the University's
affirmative action officer.
"Since many of the recommen
dations entail changes that are to
take place over several years,
many of them are not completed
at this point, but the changes are
still going on schedule," Burciaga
said.
When he announced the budget
cuts two weeks ago, Provost
James Rosse said that although
Stanford will not sacrifice its com
mitment to creating a pluralistic
community, progress on UCMI
report recommendations may be
slower than originally expected.
However, University President
Donald Kennedy held a meeting
last Friday with the Council of
Presidents to allay any fears that
UCMI recommendations would be

significantly affected by financial
changes.
"Kennedy said that although
the budget cuts will affect every
thing the University does, the im
plementation of the UCMI
recommendations remains a top
priority," said COP member In
grid Nava.
Yesterday, however, Kennedy
said in an interview, "The real
question is whether we have the
resources to match our ambi
tions."
Although the upcoming budget
cuts will have University-wide
repercussions, much of the fund
ing necessary for the imple
mentation of UCMI recommenda
tions has already been set aside
and will not be touched, Burciaga
said.
