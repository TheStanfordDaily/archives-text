# Curtain falls on theater seating
## Fifteen classrooms now have seminar-style decor 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
The show is over in many class
rooms throughout the Quad.
Theater seating has been ripped
out of nearly 15 rooms — mainly
in English, Symbolic Systems,
Asian Languages and German
Studies buildings — and has been
replaced with the seminar-style
arrangement of a central table
surrounded by chairs.
At a cost of about $175,000 per
room, work crews last summer
installed new chalkboards, floor
ing, carpeting and audiovisual
equipment along with the new
seating arrangements.
The change was a response to
complaints in past years from fac
ulty who disliked holding small
classes and sections in theater
like rooms, according to Asst.
Registrar Jack Farrell. He added
that the registrar's room schedul
ing office has consistently had dif
ficulty scraping together enough
seminar rooms before this year.
Farrell said, however, that the
new style of rooms does not reflect
a new style of teaching or an em
phasis on smaller classes at Stan
ford.
The complaints started years

ago, and they came from the top,
said Lee Morgan of Facilities Proj
ect Management. One of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's
first directives when he assumed
his current post in 1980 was to
improve the classroom environ
ment.
Since then, a fund has been set
up in the Provost's Office to al
locate money for classroom
renewal, with some funding com
ing from individual departments.
While the choices for new tables
and colors for repainted walls pre
sented no difficulties, the
Registrar's Office was stymied in
selecting new seating. After the
office held "The Great Sit-off,"
however, the clear winner was a
durable, black plastic variety
made by Krueger Company of
Green Bay, Wis.
Price, durability and low main
tenance, as well as the blessing
of the Registrar's Office, were im
portant in the selection, but the
key criterion was that the furni
ture be "comfortable for a two
hour seminar at the longest," said
Morgan.
The most salient seat feature
is the rubber hinges just below
the back rest, which allow sitters
to lean back without tipping the

whole chair.
The new arrangement won high
praise from a Religious Studies
class meeting in Building 60. "I
think these chairs are great be
cause you can do this," said senior
Rick Mikkelson, letting out a
hearty groan as he stretched out
his arms and back.
"It sabotages the lecture format
and cuts down on my authority,"
said Religious Studies Prof. Mark
Cladis, with tongue firmly in
cheek. "There's a sense we might
learn something from each other
here."
Seminar seating appears espe
cially popular to foreign language
instructors, who found theater
seating a barrier for effective con
versation among students.
"The new way is more natural,"
said Chinese instructor Youqin
Wang.
Completion of the project did
hit a few snags, however. Ben
Asaro of the Facilities Project
Management office spent much of
last summer tearing out theater
seats and installing new seats and
carpets in classrooms in the Ge
ology Corner and engineering
buildings — only to have his work
sealed off a month after comple
tion by the Oct. 17 earthquake.
