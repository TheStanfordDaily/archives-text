WISDOM
New grads eager to break out of
the ordinary are breaking into success
at Conner Peripherals. As an aggressive
competitor in the disk drive industry,
being different not only sets us apart
from the crowd, but ahead of it. Today,
we've attained the industry's most am
bitious milestone ever We've boldly cap
tured the number one spot as America's
fastest growing start-up manufacturer.
In 1989, our third year in operation, our
annual revenues increased 175% to
$705 million, breaking the previous third
year US manufacturing sales record of
$503 million. All because of one simple—
albeit unconventional—strategy: "sell,
design, build."
Traditional disk drive manufacturers
design and build products—then try to
sell them. In contrast, we sell before we
invest. So we know we have a buyer
who will benefit from a product that
meets their needs precisely. As a result,
we have expanded both our customer
base and our product portfolio—and
now attract leading computer manufac
turers from the notebook, laptop, porta
ble, desktop, and workstation markets.
We're looking for the newest
class of achievers. Those with the wisdom
and drive to seek out the uncommon. In
return, we offer involvement at the fore
front of new technologies and tremendous
growth potential to those individuals with
a bachelor's or master's degree in Engi
neering, Business and/or Computer
Science.
