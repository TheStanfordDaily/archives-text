# 20 years later, Afro-Am continues struggle to stand tall
## 
### Caitlin Liu Staff writer 
It was born of a dream.
On April 8, 1968, four days
after Martin Luther King's as
sassination, Stanford held a
campus-wide convocation
addressing racism. In the middle
of a speech by then-Provost Rich
ard Lyman, 70 members of the
Black Student Union walked
onto the Memorial Auditorium
stage and took the microphone
away from him.
With the mike in their hands,
the students read off a list of 10
demands, including that "neces
sary and sufficient steps be taken
to introduce curriculum relevant
for minority group members."

That demand eventually gave
rise to Stanford's African and
Afro-American Studies program,
the first ever offered by a private
university in the nation.
As a pioneer in the field, Afro-
American Studies wobbled to its
feet in 1969 with a few private
foundation grants and a small
University endowment, recalls
St. Clair Drake, the program's
director for its first seven years
and now professor emeritus of
anthropology.
Now in its 20th year, Afro-
American Studies continually
struggles to stand tall. Many say
the program still battles to over
come the same problems that
have recurrently plagued it over
its 20-year history: a lack of fac

ulty and a shortage of funds.
'Benign neglect'
"The biggest problem we face
is inadequate faculty in specific
interests of Afro-American
Studies," says assistant director
Faye McNair-Knox.
The program was much
stronger in the earlier years, she
says."The curriculum had a lot
more courses to offer that were
relevant to the Afro-American
experience."
McNair-Knox, a Stanford stu
dent during the 19705, remem
bers taking Afro-American
Studies courses in sociology, his
tory and political science.
But over the years the admin
istration practiced "a policy of

benign neglect," says Sylvia
Wynter, the program's interim
director. "Not just for Afro-
American Studies, but all the
ethnic studies."
No new faculty have joined
Afro-American Studies since the
early 1980s, despite the past two
program review committees
reporting that the the program
urgently needs more faculty,
Wynter says. These committees
assess each University program
every five years to see if it should
be continued.
At the same time, the Univer
sity lost some faculty members
and still has trouble retaining
them.
"Once you put a major in place,
it has to be viable," Wynter says.

She points out that the program
currently has no faculty in sociol
ogy nor in political science.
Afro-American Studies suffers
from a structural problem,
Wynter explains.
As an interdepartmental pro
gram, Afro-American Studies
cannot hire the faculty it wants
unless another department, such
as English or sociology, decides
that it also needs the same fac
ulty member. Often this crossing
of interests takes many years to
develop and can frustrate a pro
gram's attempts to expand and
grow, she says.
In a similar situation, the lack
of faculty appointments to


Kennell Jackson
centers and programs led to the
resignation of physicist Sidney
Drell from Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms
Control last year.
Wynter expresses hope, how
ever, that the faculty shortage will
soon be amended.
"Recently we've been getting far
more collaboration from the social
sciences. We haven't had that in
the last decade," she says. Both
the Political Science and Sociology
Departments have expressed in
terest in hiring faculty that would
be relevant to Afro-American
Studies, she says.
Director quit
Right now, the program is also
searching for a new director.
Wynter was asked last year to
temporarily fill the gap left by
History Assoc. Prof. Kennell Jack
son after he unexpectedly
resigned as director last year.
Jackson resigned June 1 after
nine years at the helm of the pro
gram. He was too physically tired
out by the program to go on any
longer, he says.
"I was doing an awful lot of
work," Jackson says."I received
a lot of praise but no real support.
The University never really
learned to pay its way for a pro
gram."
"In the early '80s, the possibil
ity of [Afro-American Studies]
closing down was great," Jackson
says.
What was left of his budget
after paying for salaries and office
equipment was inadequate for
running a program, he says. The
discretionary budget was hardly
enough to cover expenses such as
program-sponsored films,
luncheons and receptions, he
adds.
To keep the program going, he
often had to go to outside sources.
Jackson recalls how he begged
people to give money to the pro
gram so that it could sponsor
speakers.
Despite the budgetary con
straints, two significant additions
to the program occurred under
Jackson's guidance.
First came Afro-American
Studies 105: "Introduction to
African and Afro- American
Studies," which Jackson says is
one of the best introductory

courses of this type in the nation.
Also, Jackson created the Un
dergraduate Scholars Program, a
fund to enable students to pursue
independent research projects.
To Jackson, however, his real
achievement was simply "holding
it together."
Student enthusiasm
Student interest in Afro-
American Studies has gone
through ups and downs over the
years, with an initial burst of en
thusiasm in the earlier years and
a wane in the late 1970s due to
a shift to career-oriented thinking,
says Drake.
This general apathy continued
into the 1980s, which Wynter calls
"a lost decade."
Currently, however, student en
thusiasm seems to be on the rise
again. Last May students took
over University President Donald
Kennedy's office to demand an in
crease in multicultural courses
and qualified faculty to teach
them.
This year, classes have more
than enough students, says
Valerie Minor, co-chair of the
BSU's Education Rights Commit
tee. "It's just a matter of finding
profs."
The notion of Afro-American
Studies has strong student sup
port that needs to be mobilized,
Minor adds.
"African-American people are
such a presence in America that
their history cannot be over
looked," says junior Shairi
Turner.
Right now, Minor's committee
is working to increase emphasis
on faculty recruitment, support
staff and student awareness about
the major.
Currently, Afro-American
Studies is just "trying to live
within its means," says McNair-
Knox.
"Before you even start to plan
something you know you don't
have the money to do it," she
says.
In spite of these limitations,
McNair-Knox says, Afro-
American Studies continues to
"keep the faith."
"Afro-American Studies is
gradually becoming a genuine in
tellectual addition to knowledge,"
says Wynter. "Its evolution is
toward a program that is less po
litical and more intellectual."

grow, she says.
In a similar situation, the lack
of faculty appointments to


Kennell Jackson
centers and programs led to the
resignation of physicist Sidney
Drell from Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms
Control last year.
Wynter expresses hope, how
ever, that the faculty shortage will
soon be amended.
"Recently we've been getting far
more collaboration from the social
sciences. We haven't had that in
the last decade," she says. Both
the Political Science and Sociology
Departments have expressed in
terest in hiring faculty that would
be relevant to Afro-American
Studies, she says.
Director quit
Right now, the program is also
searching for a new director.
Wynter was asked last year to
temporarily fill the gap left by
History Assoc. Prof. Kennell Jack
son after he unexpectedly
resigned as director last year.
Jackson resigned June 1 after
nine years at the helm of the pro
gram. He was too physically tired
out by the program to go on any
longer, he says.
"I was doing an awful lot of
work," Jackson says."I received
a lot of praise but no real support.
The University never really
learned to pay its way for a pro
gram."
"In the early '80s, the possibil
ity of [Afro-American Studies]
closing down was great," Jackson
says.
What was left of his budget
after paying for salaries and office
equipment was inadequate for
running a program, he says. The
discretionary budget was hardly
enough to cover expenses such as
program-sponsored films,
luncheons and receptions, he
adds.
To keep the program going, he
often had to go to outside sources.
Jackson recalls how he begged
people to give money to the pro
gram so that it could sponsor
speakers.
Despite the budgetary con
straints, two significant additions
to the program occurred under
Jackson's guidance.
First came Afro-American
Studies 105: "Introduction to
African and Afro- American
Studies," which Jackson says is
one of the best introductory

courses of this type in the nation.
Also, Jackson created the Un
dergraduate Scholars Program, a
fund to enable students to pursue
independent research projects.
To Jackson, however, his real
achievement was simply "holding
it together."
Student enthusiasm
Student interest in Afro-
American Studies has gone
through ups and downs over the
years, with an initial burst of en
thusiasm in the earlier years and
a wane in the late 1970s due to
a shift to career-oriented thinking,
says Drake.
This general apathy continued
into the 1980s, which Wynter calls
"a lost decade."
Currently, however, student en
thusiasm seems to be on the rise
again. Last May students took
over University President Donald
Kennedy's office to demand an in
crease in multicultural courses
and qualified faculty to teach
them.
This year, classes have more
than enough students, says
Valerie Minor, co-chair of the
BSU's Education Rights Commit
tee. "It's just a matter of finding
profs."
The notion of Afro-American
Studies has strong student sup
port that needs to be mobilized,
Minor adds.
"African-American people are
such a presence in America that
their history cannot be over
looked," says junior Shairi
Turner.
Right now, Minor's committee
is working to increase emphasis
on faculty recruitment, support
staff and student awareness about
the major.
Currently, Afro-American
Studies is just "trying to live
within its means," says McNair-
Knox.
"Before you even start to plan
something you know you don't
have the money to do it," she
says.
In spite of these limitations,
McNair-Knox says, Afro-
American Studies continues to
"keep the faith."
"Afro-American Studies is
gradually becoming a genuine in
tellectual addition to knowledge,"
says Wynter. "Its evolution is
toward a program that is less po
litical and more intellectual."
It was born of a dream.
On April 8, 1968, four days
after Martin Luther King's as
sassination, Stanford held a
campus-wide convocation
addressing racism. In the middle
of a speech by then-Provost Rich
ard Lyman, 70 members of the
Black Student Union walked
onto the Memorial Auditorium
stage and took the microphone
away from him.
With the mike in their hands,
the students read off a list of 10
demands, including that "neces
sary and sufficient steps be taken
to introduce curriculum relevant
for minority group members."

That demand eventually gave
rise to Stanford's African and
Afro-American Studies program,
the first ever offered by a private
university in the nation.
As a pioneer in the field, Afro-
American Studies wobbled to its
feet in 1969 with a few private
foundation grants and a small
University endowment, recalls
St. Clair Drake, the program's
director for its first seven years
and now professor emeritus of
anthropology.
Now in its 20th year, Afro-
American Studies continually
struggles to stand tall. Many say
the program still battles to over
come the same problems that
have recurrently plagued it over
its 20-year history: a lack of fac

ulty and a shortage of funds.
'Benign neglect'
"The biggest problem we face
is inadequate faculty in specific
interests of Afro-American
Studies," says assistant director
Faye McNair-Knox.
The program was much
stronger in the earlier years, she
says."The curriculum had a lot
more courses to offer that were
relevant to the Afro-American
experience."
McNair-Knox, a Stanford stu
dent during the 19705, remem
bers taking Afro-American
Studies courses in sociology, his
tory and political science.
But over the years the admin
istration practiced "a policy of

benign neglect," says Sylvia
Wynter, the program's interim
director. "Not just for Afro-
American Studies, but all the
ethnic studies."
No new faculty have joined
Afro-American Studies since the
early 1980s, despite the past two
program review committees
reporting that the the program
urgently needs more faculty,
Wynter says. These committees
assess each University program
every five years to see if it should
be continued.
At the same time, the Univer
sity lost some faculty members
and still has trouble retaining
them.
"Once you put a major in place,
it has to be viable," Wynter says.

She points out that the program
currently has no faculty in sociol
ogy nor in political science.
Afro-American Studies suffers
from a structural problem,
Wynter explains.
As an interdepartmental pro
gram, Afro-American Studies
cannot hire the faculty it wants
unless another department, such
as English or sociology, decides
that it also needs the same fac
ulty member. Often this crossing
of interests takes many years to
develop and can frustrate a pro
gram's attempts to expand and
grow, she says.
In a similar situation, the lack
of faculty appointments to


Kennell Jackson
centers and programs led to the
resignation of physicist Sidney
Drell from Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms
Control last year.
