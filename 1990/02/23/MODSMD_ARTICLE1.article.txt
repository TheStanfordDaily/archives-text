# 20 years later, Afro-Am continues struggle to stand tall

It was born of a dream.
On April 8, 1968, four days
after Martin Luther King's as
sassination, Stanford held a
campus-wide convocation
addressing racism. In the middle
of a speech by then-Provost Rich
ard Lyman, 70 members of the
Black Student Union walked
onto the Memorial Auditorium
stage and took the microphone
away from him.
With the mike in their hands,
the students read off a list of 10
demands, including that "neces
sary and sufficient steps be taken
to introduce curriculum relevant
for minority group members."

That demand eventually gave
rise to Stanford's African and
Afro-American Studies program,
the first ever offered by a private
university in the nation.
As a pioneer in the field, Afro-
American Studies wobbled to its
feet in 1969 with a few private
foundation grants and a small
University endowment, recalls
St. Clair Drake, the program's
director for its first seven years
and now professor emeritus of
anthropology.
Now in its 20th year, Afro-
American Studies continually
struggles to stand tall. Many say
the program still battles to over
come the same problems that
have recurrently plagued it over
its 20-year history: a lack of fac

ulty and a shortage of funds.
'Benign neglect'
"The biggest problem we face
is inadequate faculty in specific
interests of Afro-American
Studies," says assistant director
Faye McNair-Knox.
The program was much
stronger in the earlier years, she
says."The curriculum had a lot
more courses to offer that were
relevant to the Afro-American
experience."
McNair-Knox, a Stanford stu
dent during the 19705, remem
bers taking Afro-American
Studies courses in sociology, his
tory and political science.
But over the years the admin
istration practiced "a policy of

benign neglect," says Sylvia
Wynter, the program's interim
director. "Not just for Afro-
American Studies, but all the
ethnic studies."
No new faculty have joined
Afro-American Studies since the
early 1980s, despite the past two
program review committees
reporting that the the program
urgently needs more faculty,
Wynter says. These committees
assess each University program
every five years to see if it should
be continued.
At the same time, the Univer
sity lost some faculty members
and still has trouble retaining
them.
"Once you put a major in place,
it has to be viable," Wynter says.

She points out that the program
currently has no faculty in sociol
ogy nor in political science.
Afro-American Studies suffers
from a structural problem,
Wynter explains.
As an interdepartmental pro
gram, Afro-American Studies
cannot hire the faculty it wants
unless another department, such
as English or sociology, decides
that it also needs the same fac
ulty member. Often this crossing
of interests takes many years to
develop and can frustrate a pro
gram's attempts to expand and
grow, she says.
In a similar situation, the lack
of faculty appointments to
