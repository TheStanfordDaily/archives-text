Ariane failure
KOUROU, French Guiana (AP) — An Ariane
44-L rocket with two Japanese telecommuni
cations satellites aboard exploded yesterday
shortly after blasting off from the launch pad
at the Ariane space center.
Arianespace President Frederic d'Allest said
the four-engine rocket blew apart because of
what appeared to be a problem with its propul
sion system.
Military reductions
EAST BERLIN (AP) — The two Germanys
should reduce their combined military by two
thirds when they unite, and some U.S. and
Soviet soldiers should remain during the uni
fication process, the East German defense min
ister said yesterday.
Adm. Theodor Hoffmann said the armed
forces should be purely defensive and both
states should remain in their respective al
liances until they are reunited under a new
European security system.
Hoffmann said a joint German military
should be reduced to about 300,000 men ini
tially, and later to 150,000-200,000.
Tanker explodes
MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — A U.S.-flag
Kuwaiti tanker loaded with naphtha and diesel

one, abandoned the burning ship and were
rescued by a U.S. Navy frigate.
U.S. sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said remains had been found in
the water but it was not clear whether they
were of one or two people. A U.S. military
spokesman said he could not confirm the
report.
Stalin toppled
Ulj\N BATOR, Mongolia (AP) — The last
statue of Josef Stalin in the Mongolian capital
was toppled yesterday to the cheers of

fall from grace in this long-time Soviet satel

Revolutionary Party bowed to public pressure
and removed a smaller statue of Stalin from

ocratic reform. The movement organized itself
this week as the Mongolian Democratic Party.

to impoverished nations elsewhere which have
traditionally borrowed from the international
development bank.
