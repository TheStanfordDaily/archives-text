WASHINGTON (AP) - Former
President Reagan testified in a
videotaped deposition released yester
day that he never "had any inkling"
his aides were secretly arming the
Nicaraguan Contras during a congres
sional ban on military aid.
In testimony for the upcoming trial
of John Poindexter, the former pres
ident also said he remained uncon
vinced there had been a diversion of
Iran arms sale money to the rebels —
until prosecutors confronted him with
the report of the Tower Commission
he appointed.
Reagan said he would have expected
Poindexter, his former national secu
rity adviser, to inform him of any di
version of funds to the Contras "unless
maybe he thought he was protecting
me from something."
Reagan's testimony was taken in Los
Angeles last week and made available
in Washington. The former president
was jovial and testy by turns during
eight hours — winking at Poindexter
as he took the stand and talking
amiably with the judge but also
answering in abrupt fashion when
Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb said
he wasn't addressing a question.
He said at numerous points that he
couldn't recall a date, a name, whether
someone had told him something or
not.
Reagan said decisively that he
agreed with a letter Poindexter sent
Congress saying the White House was
complying with the ban on help for
the Contras.
