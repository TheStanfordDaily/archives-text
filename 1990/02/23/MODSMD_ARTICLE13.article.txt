inal charges over last year's massive
Alaska oil spill, several sources said
yesterday.

Durenberger hearings
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Sen
ate Ethics Committee said yesterday
it would begin a trial-like hearing on
Sen. David Durenberger because of
"substantial credible evidence" that
he violated Senate rules and federal
law.
Most of the allegations concern a

book-promotion arrangement under
which the Minnesota Republican
made speeches and accepted fees to
promote two books he wrote.
Durenberger said in a statement
that the investigation so far has been
a "painful experience" and contended
"It was never my intent to circumvent
Senate rules for my own benefit."
He called for the committee to reach
a conclusion quickly.
No new sanctions
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush
administration opposes placing more
economic sanctions on South Africa
because, "When someone is starting
to do the right thing, you don't kick
them," an official said yesterday.
Herman Cohen, the assistant sec
retary of state for African affairs,
predicted South Africa's white-ruled
government might be able to satisfy
conditions that could lead to the
removal of U.S. economic sanctions
"in the next three months."

"In my opinion, the end of officially
sanctioned racial oppression in South
Africa is on the horizon," he said
during an appearance before two
House subcommittees.

$70 billion pricetag, an investigative
agency said yesterday.
The General Accounting Office,
however, emphasized that such a step
must be accompanied by an analysis
by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
and the plane's contractor, Northrop
Corp., to determine the cost of a
delay in production.
Interest rate report
WASHINGTON (AP) - Chairman

Alan Greenspan of the Federal
Reserve Board said yesterday that a
recent rise in long-term interest rates
is caused by prospects for the devel
opment of Eastern Europe and prob
ably will not continue.
Greenspan, presenting the central
bank's semi-annual report to Con
gress, said investors are rushing to
take advantage of tremendous oppor
tunities as Eastern European nations
emerge from four decades of commu
nist rule.
"This is an extraordinary change
in the nature of world savings and
investment and I don't think it has
any exact historical precedent," he
said.
