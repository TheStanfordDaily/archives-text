## Equal access for all 
### 
New fraternity house
would create problems
in residential system

WE NEED MORE under
graduate housing — but
not this way.
Preliminary plans by the Inter
fraternity Council to seek an on
campus house for one of three cur
rently unhoused fraternities will
exacerbate an already dangerous
problem: unequal access to Uni
versity housing.
The IFC believes that it can pro
vide a service to the University at
little to no cost. The house would
be heavily if not completely sub
sidized by a national fraternity,
and the additional housing may
open up slots in other University
housing.
But there is another price that
we would all pay.
Fraternity housing is still Uni
versity housing. It is a part of Res
idential Education, and a new fra
ternity house would be built on
University land.
We already have enough housing
that is closed to a large segment
of the campus community — cur
rently, there are 11 housed frater
nities.
Any new housing should be di
rected toward the entire student
population.
Yet, by definition, fraternity
housing excludes women. Immedi

ately, more than 40 percent of this
campus is excluded from ever
living in this house.
Because of University policy,
they are also barred from ever cre
ating an alternative for women,
since there are no housed sorori
ties.
In addition, the house is not
truly open to all males who wish
to reside there.
The first requirement for males
is that they want to live in the
fraternity environment. For many
students, that is not an attractive
option.
Even if a man does want to live
there, however, he must be ac
cepted by the fraternity before he
is allowed to move in. Thus Uni
versity housing is transformed
from the random chance of the
Draw to the unequal whims of the
fraternity members.
That's not the proper role of Uni
versity housing.
|In 1988 the University Task
Force on Fraternities and Sorori
ties recommended that "assign
ment of student housing may not
be denied based on the subjective
judgments of current or former res
idents."
Since that time, the University
has kept a quiet moratorium on
expanding fraternity housing.
Student housing is an important
issue, and we need to continue to
look for creative ways to tackle it.
But let's do so in a way that
keeps all housing accessible to all
students. New fraternity houses
are not the answer.
