Affirmative action programs do not lower standards

BOTH ATTACKS AND defenses of
affirmative action seem to agree
that affirmative action lowers
the criteria for disadvantaged popula
tions. This is false. Affirmative action
does not lower anything; instead it
changes the criteria, adapting them to
differing populations.
On a more demonstrative level, if a
female with a doctorate in physics is
competing with a male whose resume
shows that he is equally qualified, we
must realize that to get to this point
the woman has had to face and over
come greater pressures. The persever
ance and self-confidence she has
probably developed should not only be
appreciated, but indeed on a practical
level make her a more qualified appli
cant.

Once we accept the premise that
different people face different pres
sures, it is essential that we recognize
what these different pressures are, and
in which populations they occur.
An example I hope everyone will
agree with is the experience of lower
income populations. Many of the pres
sures lower-income people face are
tangible handicaps that must be recog
nized and appreciated.
A recruiter must understand and
reward the child who grows up in an
environment where he must watch over
his siblings once school gets out and
does not have time for homework, or
the inner city student in a class of 35
who must share her textbooks with
two others and whose teachers are

drained by scarce resources and exces
sive responsibilities. By recognizing
these pressures we gain a more com
plete understanding of the applicant's
experience and reality and in this way
evaluate the person more accurately.
The final issue which we must un
derstand, and hopefully accept, is the
touchy issue of affirmative action and
race. Affirmative action not only at
tempts to redress the inequalities
which are due to socio-economic status
but also attempts to counteract the
distorting effects of racial prejudice.
Affirmative action focuses on race
because it realizes that the day-to-day
racial experience transcends income
brackets and geography. A Chicano or
an African-American, by virtue of

being visually so, has endured racism.
In order to overcome these overt at
tacks and institutionalized barriers,
people of color have had to develop
certain valuable qualities.
To recognize the diverse qualities
these differing experiences produce, we
must broaden the criteria by which we
evaluate people.
If we accept that sex, socio-economic
status and race affect the way per
formance and achievement are ex
pressed, then to exclude an applicant
with no regard to his or her experience
is an inadequate, verging on immoral,
evaluation.
