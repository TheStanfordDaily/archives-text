# ASSU should work to help students
## 
### 
I would like to propose that the
following be immediately enacted as an
ASSU Bylaw:
â€¢ The ASSU should help students,
not hurt them.
Elected and appointed officials shall
interpret ambiguities in the Bylaws or
Constitution in a way which helps
students, organizations and programs,
and shall not interpret ambiguites in
such a way as to hinder them.
Students, organizations and programs
shall be the judges of what helps or
hinders them and not the ASSU or
their appointees.
This helpful interpretation shall
remain in effect until the ambiguity is
removed from the constitution or
bylaws.
Because of the nature of the English
language, ambiguities exist. In these

cases reasonable people can disagree
over the meaning of an expression and
neither one is right or wrong.
This has caused problems for organi
zations such as the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, the Stanford Progressive Alli
ance, the Black Student Union and
Tuesday Films.
For example, the Speakers Bureau
was eliminated from the ballot com
pletely in 1984 because of a malicious
reading of the Bylaws by the ASSU
Elections Commissioner.
In 1984, the ASSU insisted that
"Tuesday Films" be placed on the bal
lot as "SMARTOR, Tue. Flm" because
that is the way their name was origi
nally logged by the ASSU, and they
lost the election that year by 1 per
cent.
These bylaws should help remedy
these kinds of problems from ever
occurring again, and get Tuesday Films
on the ballot in a constitutional and
uncontroversial way, which is not un
necessarily burdensome and which does
not put Tuesday Films at risk of not

appearing on the ballot.
