# Phi Delt criticisms unfounded, extreme
## 
### 
I am writing to argue against David
Hornik's position on the Phi Delta
Theta controversy. As serious as the
sanctions imposed against the frater
nity are, I would imagine that even the
extremists would be happy. But Hornik
calls for even further action — the loss
of their home. Why?
He cites problems in the past, such
as a 1986 Kamikaze Party. But no
members from that long ago live there
any more — the last would have grad
uated in 1989. Why should current
members be held accountable for a
past they did not create?
He cites the incident this year, where
an intoxicated freshman was hit by a

truck. This is unfortunate, but the Phi
Delts followed all of Residential Educa
tion's party guidelines and took meas
ures to prevent such troubles. It was
just bad luck for them that the indi
vidual that night left their party in
stead of someone else's. The person
could have just as easily become drunk
and had a similar accident after leaving
a dorm party. This situation is a case
of personally irresponsible drinking,
not of the Phi Delts lacking responsi
bility.
Hornik claims the Phi Delts "poison
this campus, both chemically and so
cially." The Phi Delts' parties are a
fine social opportunity, as anyone in
attendance would agree. For those who
do not go, who are they to pass judge
ment on what constitutes a social as
set?
The Phi Delts' errors, if any, cer
tainly do not warrant the loss of their
house. This would be a loss to the
whole campus and is undeserved.
