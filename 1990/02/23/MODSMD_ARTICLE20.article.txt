FREE JAMES BROWN! Ladies and
gentlemen hear my cry: I call for
the immediate and unconditional
release from prison of the hardest work
ing man in show business.
And no, this isn't a follow-up to Nelson
Mandela's release; the last thing I want
is for this to be seen as an off-the-cuff
"while we're on the subject of releasing
people" sort of deal. That would be com
mitting quite a faux pas, as I would ap
pear culturally retarded, politically
unconscious and ethnically repressed.
And after three and a half years of careful
Residential Education programming, 1
feel safe in saying I'm well on my way
to appearing otherwise.
That's not our focus today, though.
Today I call into question the hypocrisy
of a society which holds entertainers to
the same legal standards as ordinary
people.
Now, it's been said that James did some
bad things — like PCP. He also allegedly
hit his wife, grabbed a gun, hopped in
his car and led the authorities on a high
speed interstate car chase. I hear at one
point he tried to run down a law enforce
ment officer, thereby forcing the author
ities to shoot out his two front tires. Six
miles later he pulled over. While singing
"Georgia" and doing his "Good Foot"
dance, James was taken into custody.
It's not that James' actions weren't
morally and ethically reprehensible; they
were. Any normal person caught com
mitting such atrocities should be pun
ished. So if I, for example, were to follow
James' lead, I'd be a scofflaw and a sin
ner. First a cell, then on to hell, as it

were. But James? No. James just needs
professional help.
This is because James is what is known
in legal circles as a "public figure." This
means that he surrenders, among other
things, certain rights and privileges. He
relinquishes any claim to a "normal" life;
he has no privacy, no protection from
the media, and an enormous amount of
disposable income unencumbered by a
workaday employment schedule. And we
the American laity, are hypocrites to
revere and deify men like James and then
pass judgement on them for their im
petuous behavior.
But let us not err in who is and isn't
an entertainer; James Brown is — but
is Todd Bridges? Todd (Willis on
"DifTrent Strokes") is currently serving
time for his involvement in a shooting.
Todd was a member of the entertainment
field, to be sure — but I think questioning
his status as a true entertainer is valid.
See, I'm more for narrowing the cat
egory down to entertainers who are either
long-standing contributors and/or con
tributors of work of significant merit.
This would, I think, keep Todd safely
behind bars, despite the inevitable cacop
hony of "Free Todd Bridges!" wafting up
from fans and legal scholars.
We should also be sure to exclude pol
iticians who, though often entertaining,
are not entertainers.
And then there's Zsa Zsa. This is a
toughie, as she obviously qualifies in the
"long standing contributors" category.
She's even appeared in a movie that won
an Academy Award. But then again, she
also appeared in "Picture Mommy Dead."

Still, at first glance she appears immune;
based solely on duration she would n&t
have been prosecuted for hitting a cop;
But wait! According to the 1990 World
Almanac, the well-preserved Hungarispi
has no birthday. This implies one of two
things: she does not exist, or she is a
liar. Given that she is an entertainer of
merit, Zsa Zsa is incapable of flawed ac;-
tion and thus could not possibly lie. This
leaves us with only one other option: Zsa
Zsa Gabor does not exist. And there's
our solution.
Perhaps you think I'm going a tad bit
overboard here. Consider, though, that
my point remains the same: by carefully
tailoring our laws to protect the genuine
gods of our stages, screens and
we will be working for a less hypocritical
society.
In conclusion, free James Brown! You
may think I'm being facetious, but I'n)
not the first person I know to have called
for such action. The first person I know
to have called for James' release is doc*
umented in the March 13, 1989 issue of
Jet magazine — and that person is Jess£
Jackson.

release from prison of the hardest work
ing man in show business.
And no, this isn't a follow-up to Nelson
Mandela's release; the last thing I want
is for this to be seen as an off-the-cuff
"while we're on the subject of releasing
people" sort of deal. That would be com
mitting quite a faux pas, as I would ap
pear culturally retarded, politically
unconscious and ethnically repressed.
And after three and a half years of careful
Residential Education programming, 1
feel safe in saying I'm well on my way
to appearing otherwise.
That's not our focus today, though.
Today I call into question the hypocrisy
of a society which holds entertainers to
the same legal standards as ordinary
people.
Now, it's been said that James did some
bad things — like PCP. He also allegedly
hit his wife, grabbed a gun, hopped in
his car and led the authorities on a high
speed interstate car chase. I hear at one
point he tried to run down a law enforce
ment officer, thereby forcing the author
ities to shoot out his two front tires. Six
miles later he pulled over. While singing
"Georgia" and doing his "Good Foot"
dance, James was taken into custody.
It's not that James' actions weren't
morally and ethically reprehensible; they
were. Any normal person caught com
mitting such atrocities should be pun
ished. So if I, for example, were to follow
James' lead, I'd be a scofflaw and a sin
ner. First a cell, then on to hell, as it

were. But James? No. James just needs
professional help.
This is because James is what is known
in legal circles as a "public figure." This
means that he surrenders, among other
things, certain rights and privileges. He
relinquishes any claim to a "normal" life;
he has no privacy, no protection from
the media, and an enormous amount of
disposable income unencumbered by a
workaday employment schedule. And we
the American laity, are hypocrites to
revere and deify men like James and then
pass judgement on them for their im
petuous behavior.
But let us not err in who is and isn't
an entertainer; James Brown is — but
is Todd Bridges? Todd (Willis on
"DifTrent Strokes") is currently serving
time for his involvement in a shooting.
Todd was a member of the entertainment
field, to be sure — but I think questioning
his status as a true entertainer is valid.
See, I'm more for narrowing the cat
egory down to entertainers who are either
long-standing contributors and/or con
tributors of work of significant merit.
This would, I think, keep Todd safely
behind bars, despite the inevitable cacop
hony of "Free Todd Bridges!" wafting up
from fans and legal scholars.
We should also be sure to exclude pol
iticians who, though often entertaining,
are not entertainers.
And then there's Zsa Zsa. This is a
toughie, as she obviously qualifies in the
"long standing contributors" category.
She's even appeared in a movie that won
an Academy Award. But then again, she
also appeared in "Picture Mommy Dead."

Still, at first glance she appears immune;
based solely on duration she would n&t
have been prosecuted for hitting a cop;
But wait! According to the 1990 World
Almanac, the well-preserved Hungarispi
has no birthday. This implies one of two
things: she does not exist, or she is a
liar. Given that she is an entertainer of
merit, Zsa Zsa is incapable of flawed ac;-
tion and thus could not possibly lie. This
leaves us with only one other option: Zsa
Zsa Gabor does not exist. And there's
our solution.
Perhaps you think I'm going a tad bit
overboard here. Consider, though, that
my point remains the same: by carefully
tailoring our laws to protect the genuine
gods of our stages, screens and
we will be working for a less hypocritical
society.
In conclusion, free James Brown! You
may think I'm being facetious, but I'n)
not the first person I know to have called
for such action. The first person I know
to have called for James' release is doc*
umented in the March 13, 1989 issue of
Jet magazine — and that person is Jess£
Jackson.
