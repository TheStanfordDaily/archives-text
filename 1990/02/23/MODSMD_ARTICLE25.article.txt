# Student missing in East Germany
## Sophomore disappears on day trip

A member of the Kappa Sigma
fraternity was fined for taking his
date for a late night drive on the
Stanford campus. Proof that the
Stanford administration actively
conspires to prevent dating here?
Not exactly, since the student
drove his car across several holes
of the rain-soaked Stanford golf
course, until his car became mired
in mud. At that point, the student
and his date left the car and
walked home, taking the oppor
tunity to practice javelin throwing
with several hole flags.
Stanford groundskeepers
decided to wait until the ground
dried and hardened before calling
a tow truck to remove the
stranded vehicle to avoid further
tire damage to the course.
This was Stanford's big chance
to have one of the finest miniature
golf courses in the country, and
they blew it. They should have
left the car where it was, brought
in one of those rotating windmills
for the next hole, and maybe
added a dragon with a mouth
that opens and shuts.

A group of Roble resident as
sistants convinced a number of
their residents that the "Roble
Frog Hunt" was an important an
nual Stanford tradition, despite
the fact that no such frog hunt
had ever occurred before. A group
of 50 to 60 freshman women from
Roble spent the better part of a
rainy Wednesday evening hunting
for frogs in Lake Lagunita. The
women from hall 2A won the hunt
with a total catch of 12 frogs.
I wonder if any of them fell for
the story about "Moonlight on the

Lake," a Stanford tradition in
which freshman women are sup
posed to kiss a senior frog in Lake
Lag during the first full moon of
the quarter.

Stanford administrators and
State Department officials feared
that a missing Stanford student
studying overseas in Berlin was
being held in an East German
prison.
The student, a 19-year-old soph
omore, never returned from a one
day trip to East Berlin on Jan.
27. While his friends and relatives
had heard nothing from him or
from East German authorities
since his disappearance, an inves
tigation conducted by the U.S.
State Depatment concluded that
he was probably being held behind
bars in East Germany ana called
for negotiations "to determine
methods to bring the youth (backl
from behind the wall."
Why didn't we send the elite
forces of the Band in to rescue
him? A group that can challenge
the repressive, totalitarian forces
of the USC marching band would
have had no trouble dealing with
East German prison guards at the
height of the Cold War. It would
have been a piece of cake.
