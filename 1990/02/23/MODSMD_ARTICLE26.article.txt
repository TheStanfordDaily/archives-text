# Stanford's multicultural attitude doesn't reach all groups
## 
### Aram Irwin Staff writer 
Dear Bug,
Have you ever considered writing a
column for the "Opinions" section of the
paper?
— Opinionated
Indeed I have. It's all too apparent that
the majority of the minority communities
here at Stanford are highly under
represented, a condition that is very
much in conflict with Stanford's efforts
to create a diverse, multicultural envi
ronment.
In an effort to foster multiculturalism,
and at your suggestion, "Opinionated",
I have prepared an Opinions column from
the perspective of one of the least heard
from communities on the Stanford
campus — the Heavy Metal community.

About six months ago I joined the MGB
Record Club — I'd get seven free albums
if I bought one at "regular club prices"
within a year. After choosing about four

selections — their "most unusual" ones,
like the Talking Heads and the Euryth
mics — I had exhausted their selection
of music that was interesting to me. So
I ordered two U2 tapes and an Iggy Pop
album.
Iggy never made it. Iggy happened to
be selection #1311416. Instead I received
selection #1311476 — Metallica's
"Master of Puppets."

I winced. Heavy Metal. Frizzy-haired
guys on drugs in leather underwear
screaming about the devil and smashing
guitars. Yet I popped "Master of Puppets"
into the tape deck, perhaps expecting to
grimace and laugh at the resulting cacap
hony.
Instead, I was shocked to hear a taut
and tightly interwoven pattern of expertly
rendered percussion, guitar, and . . . syn
thesizer? The lead singer was actually
singing (not shrieking) political (not
satanic) lyrics. I liked it. I loved it. It
was better than the U2 or the Talking
Heads tapes.
At first I tried to justify my reaction.
"It's just fast rock. It's a punk band that
actually knows how to play. It's Credence
Clearwater Revival on speed. Nothing
worked. "Master of Puppets" was still
very, very heavy metal.
So, if I couldn't change my definition
of "Master of Puppets," maybe I could
change others' definitions of "heavy
metal." I set out on my crusade.
The reaction of one of my fellow Daily
staffers was typical. I played a slow song
(yes, a slow song) from the album on the
Daily's tape player. "That's kind of nice,"
she said. "What is it?"

It's all too apparent that the majority of the minority
communities here at Stanford are highly un
represented, a condition that is very much in conflict
with Stanford's efforts to create a diverse, multicultural
environment.

"Guess," I responded.
"What ... Iron Maiden or Metallica?"
she queried jokingly.
"It's actually Metallica," I replied. Her
face fell. I knew I had her now. She now
faced the "contradiction" that the music
was heavy metal and good at the same
time. I grinned in victory.
"Turn that crap off! Yuck!" she ex
claimed.
"Master of Puppets" had no chance
from the start. It was doomed to the
heavy metal categorization.
Now categorization is not a bad thing.
It's a necessary thing. We begin to
categorize from Day One. The stove coil
is red — I touch, I hurt. It doesn't take
too many touches to categorize Mr. Stove

Coil as one of "The Things I Sure Ain't
Touching."
Word definitions are also categoriza
tions. We hear the word "pomegranate"
in association with a red, seed-filled fruit,
and we have a categorization for the def
inition of that word.
But absolute categorizations should not
go beyond pomegranates and stove coils.
We trap ourselves by categorizing the
abstract; we limit ourselves unnecessari
ly. We should leave our definitions open
ended, open to change or even
redefinition, or we will find ourselves
unpleasantly surprised. Who would so
quickly define and limit "love" or "jus
tice"? Being black? Being a woman?
Shakespeare's writing? Da Vinci's
painting? "Heavy Metal"?

Daily's tape player. "That's kind of nice,"
she said. "What is it?"

It's all too apparent that the majority of the minority
communities here at Stanford are highly un
represented, a condition that is very much in conflict
with Stanford's efforts to create a diverse, multicultural
environment.

"Guess," I responded.
"What ... Iron Maiden or Metallica?"
she queried jokingly.
"It's actually Metallica," I replied. Her
face fell. I knew I had her now. She now
faced the "contradiction" that the music
was heavy metal and good at the same
time. I grinned in victory.
"Turn that crap off! Yuck!" she ex
claimed.
"Master of Puppets" had no chance
from the start. It was doomed to the
heavy metal categorization.
Now categorization is not a bad thing.
It's a necessary thing. We begin to
categorize from Day One. The stove coil
is red — I touch, I hurt. It doesn't take
too many touches to categorize Mr. Stove

Coil as one of "The Things I Sure Ain't
Touching."
Word definitions are also categoriza
tions. We hear the word "pomegranate"
in association with a red, seed-filled fruit,
and we have a categorization for the def
inition of that word.
But absolute categorizations should not
go beyond pomegranates and stove coils.
We trap ourselves by categorizing the
abstract; we limit ourselves unnecessari
ly. We should leave our definitions open
ended, open to change or even
redefinition, or we will find ourselves
unpleasantly surprised. Who would so
quickly define and limit "love" or "jus
tice"? Being black? Being a woman?
Shakespeare's writing? Da Vinci's
painting? "Heavy Metal"?
