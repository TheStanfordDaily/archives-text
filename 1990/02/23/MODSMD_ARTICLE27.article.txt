## GETTING TO THE POINT Freshman guard Lollie learns to run the offense in a hurry 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
The setting is Pauley Pavilion. The
nationally-ranked UCLA men's basket
ball team has been behind most of the
game, but is staging a comeback. Ten
thousand, nine hundred thirty-six Bruin
fans are screaming as their team trails
by only two points with 43 seconds left.
Prospects look good. The Bruins are
on a 10-1 run and the visitors have a
58-percent free throw shooter on the
line, preparing for a one-and-one. Better
still, he's a freshman.
As the volume increases, the fresh
man steps up to the line and calmly
sinks the first free throw. And then the
second. Minutes later, the Bruins walk
off the court, heads hung in defeat. Ten
thousand people are the quietest they've
been all afternoon. And Marcus Lollie
and his Stanford teammates celebrate
their first-ever victory in 25 tries at
Pauley Pavilion.
With Stanford's starting guards in
foul trouble, Lollie played the last 15
minutes of the game at point guard.
Despite the fact that the Bruins pressed
the freshman on every possession, he
held up and Stanford held on for the
win. Lollie played a big part, making a
pair of free throws with 3:51 remaining
and another pair with the game on the
line. While most people would probably
be gleeful about such a performance,
however, Lollie wasn't.
"I played OK," he said. "I think if
we'd have lost I would've been pretty
mad at my performance. ... I had six
turnovers in the game and six turnovers
is way too many, I don't care what kind

of game it was. I had six turnovers and
two assists. When you play that long
the ratio has to be reversed. I had an
OK game but I could have played a lot
better."
Clearly Lollie is his own worst critic.
But while it doesn't always show up in
the box score, he is becoming a bigger
and bigger contributor to the team's
success as the season goes on. He has
played in all but two games this year
and played 24 and 22 minutes in the
Cardinal's last two games. And even
though he doesn't think the season has
gone as well as he hoped, he feels he
has improved greatly
"It's progressed kind of slowly in my
mind," he said. "I haven't done every
thing I want to do. I think the hardest
part of it is that playing college basket
ball is a lot different from playing high
school. .. . Coming in I had a lot of
expectations for myself and I've accom

plished some of them but every time
out there I've learned something. As
long as I learn something and help the
team win, I'm happy. Every game out
I'm playing a lot better."
When Lollie came to Stanford in Sep
tember, his status was uncertain. The
three guards who played almost all of
the minutes at that position last year
had all graduated. With only one guard
on the roster with any Division I expe
rience, Lollie knew he would have a
chance to play immediately.
And while in some situations it almost
seems like he's been thrown to the
wolves, Lollie enjoys the trial by fire.
"A lot of the things about college
basketball are things that you can't go
to the gym and work on," he said. "You
can go and practice your shot and prac
tice your dribbling in the gym, and I
