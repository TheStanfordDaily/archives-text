## GETTING TO THE POINT Freshman guard Lollie learns to run the offense in a hurry 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
The setting is Pauley Pavilion. The
nationally-ranked UCLA men's basket
ball team has been behind most of the
game, but is staging a comeback. Ten
thousand, nine hundred thirty-six Bruin
fans are screaming as their team trails
by only two points with 43 seconds left.
Prospects look good. The Bruins are
on a 10-1 run and the visitors have a
58-percent free throw shooter on the
line, preparing for a one-and-one. Better
still, he's a freshman.
As the volume increases, the fresh
man steps up to the line and calmly
sinks the first free throw. And then the
second. Minutes later, the Bruins walk
off the court, heads hung in defeat. Ten
thousand people are the quietest they've
been all afternoon. And Marcus Lollie
and his Stanford teammates celebrate
their first-ever victory in 25 tries at
Pauley Pavilion.
With Stanford's starting guards in
foul trouble, Lollie played the last 15
minutes of the game at point guard.
Despite the fact that the Bruins pressed
the freshman on every possession, he
held up and Stanford held on for the
win. Lollie played a big part, making a
pair of free throws with 3:51 remaining
and another pair with the game on the
line. While most people would probably
be gleeful about such a performance,
however, Lollie wasn't.
"I played OK," he said. "I think if
we'd have lost I would've been pretty
mad at my performance. ... I had six
turnovers in the game and six turnovers
is way too many, I don't care what kind

of game it was. I had six turnovers and
two assists. When you play that long
the ratio has to be reversed. I had an
OK game but I could have played a lot
better."
Clearly Lollie is his own worst critic.
But while it doesn't always show up in
the box score, he is becoming a bigger
and bigger contributor to the team's
success as the season goes on. He has
played in all but two games this year
and played 24 and 22 minutes in the
Cardinal's last two games. And even
though he doesn't think the season has
gone as well as he hoped, he feels he
has improved greatly
"It's progressed kind of slowly in my
mind," he said. "I haven't done every
thing I want to do. I think the hardest
part of it is that playing college basket
ball is a lot different from playing high
school. .. . Coming in I had a lot of
expectations for myself and I've accom

plished some of them but every time
out there I've learned something. As
long as I learn something and help the
team win, I'm happy. Every game out
I'm playing a lot better."
When Lollie came to Stanford in Sep
tember, his status was uncertain. The
three guards who played almost all of
the minutes at that position last year
had all graduated. With only one guard
on the roster with any Division I expe
rience, Lollie knew he would have a
chance to play immediately.
And while in some situations it almost
seems like he's been thrown to the
wolves, Lollie enjoys the trial by fire.
"A lot of the things about college
basketball are things that you can't go
to the gym and work on," he said. "You
can go and practice your shot and prac
tice your dribbling in the gym, and I

do that, but that's not the big
thing. A lot of things that happen
in games — you have to think,
be smart, to make the right play.
In addition to simple learning
by experience, Lollie feels Coach
Mike Montgomery has also helped
him a great deal. "I think he's a
really great coach," Lollie said.
"He's helped me understand the
way I've made bad decisions and
that's helped me when the situa
tion comes up again. He'll say,
'In this situation you did this, but
if you do this, then this will hap
pen.' So the next time I'm in that
situation I do that and it works."
Montgomery has also helped
Lollie's confidence, which in turn
has helped his play. "UCLA's play
ing a tough pressure defense the
whole game," Lollie said. "To put
a freshman in that point in the
game — that says a lot. And then
to leave him in there the rest of
the game, even when things aren't
always going well ... is a good
indication of his confidence in me.
"All the coaches now realize
they can depend on me to do the
job at any time. . . . They know
'We can put Marcus in and he'll
help us at any time.' "
Lollie has also learned a lot
from playing against the guards
in the Pacific 10 Conference. With
Oregon State's Gary Payton a
contender for national player-of
the-year honors and UCLA's Der
rick Martin, California's Keith
Smith and Washington's Eldridge
Recasner establishing themselves
among the nation's elite, there is
never an easy night.
"There's a lot of competition in
the Pac-10 because we have a lot
of great guards," Lollie said.
"Each night out you're playing
against a top-notch player. That's
one of the things that's made me
a lot better. I can't see how you

can't get any better playing
against Payton and the other
guards. You have to get better. If
you don't you're going to get eaten
alive."
Martin tried to do just that to
Lollie in the second half of the
UCLA game. Many times down
the floor, Martin would try to
drive on Lollie one-on-one. "It was
a challenge coming right at me
and I'll accept any challenge,"
Lollie said. "I was ready tc do the
best job I could to stop him. . . .
I think I did an OK job.
"At first, when he tried to drive
on me I was reaching. That's why
I was getting called for fouls. Fi
nally I got mad at myself for
reaching. I started to do what was
right — get in front of him and
square him up and stop him from
getting in the paint. . . i"
With only three more regular
season games left after tonight's
showdown with Arizona in Maples
Pavilion, Lollie and his team
mates are turning their thoughts
to postseason competition. Al
though no one expected the Car
dinal to compete for an NCAA or
NIT Tournament berth after the
graduation of four starters, Stan
ford is currently 15-8 and has no
desire for a moral victory in a
"rebuilding" year.
"If you don't want to make the
NCAA Tournament, you shouldn't
be playing basketball," Lollie said.
"I think we have a great chance
of making the tournament if we
play hard and win the games we
should win. . . . Even if we don't
make the NCAA we have a great
shot of making the NIT. I know
we're going to play somewhere;
it's just a matter of which one.
"My ultimate goal is to win an
NCAA Championship and I think
it's possible. . . . I'm used to win
ning and I hate losing. I want to
help build a strong basketball pro
gram here where losing is ob
solete."
