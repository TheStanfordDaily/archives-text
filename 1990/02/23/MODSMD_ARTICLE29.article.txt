# Just another day at the office for dominating Cardinal
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Stanford track and field Coach
Brocks Johnson knows running
when he sees it. So, when he told
Tara VanDerveer her team wasn't
running, it caught her attention.
She relayed the news in practice
and the Cardinal obviously took

it to heart as they ran Arizona
State out of the building, 106-64
in Tempe last night.
"We ran as well or better than
we have all year," VanDerveer
said. "That was something we've
really worked hard on."
The win upped the No. 3 Car
dinal's record to 23-1, 13-1 in
Pacific 10 Conference play. Ari

zona State dropped to 12-11, 4-9
before just 358 fans at the Uni
versity Activity Center.
The high-powered Cardinal,
which had been troubled recently
by some slow starts, came out of
the gate at a pace that might have
given Loyola Marymount Coach
Paul Westhead goosebumps.
Stanford scored 40 points in the
first 10 minutes as Jennifer Azzi
and Katy Steding began lighting
it up from three-point territory.
Five treys, three by Steding and
two by Azzi, helped Stanford
move ahead 44-15 with 9:29 to
play in the half.
"Our perimeter people really
carried the load," VanDerveer
said. "Jennifer and Katy really
shot well."
Steding finished with 18 points

and Azzi added 16, but neither
was the Cardinal's high scorer.
That honor belonged to Trisha
Stevens, who tallied a game-high
22 points on 6-of-l 1 shooting from
the field and a perfect 10-of-10
mark at the free throw line.
The Sun Devils used an 8-0 run
to trim the Cardinal lead to 21.
Arizona State also began clamping
down defensively, slowing the
Stanford machine in the process.
Fran Ciak scored six points in
the final 10 minutes of the half
and also pulled down eight

rebounds as Arizona State man
aged to keep the game reasonable
heading into the intermission. At
halftime, Stanford led 57-39.
The Cardinal dashed any hopes
the Sun Devils were clinging to
early in the second half. Steding,
who matched Ciak with 12
rebounds, made four shots includ
ing a three-pointer as Stanford
blitzkrieged Arizona State with a
26-4 run a minute into the second
stanza.
With the lead at 87-48, the Car
dinal was comfortably in control.
Martha Richards, who played her
best game in some time, had the
honor of breaking the century
mark for Stanford when she
scored with 3:30 remaining. The
Cardinal last scored 100 against
Long Beach State on Jan. 23.

"Martha really played under
control," VanDerveer said. "She
took good shots and passed up a
couple, too." Richards finished
with 10 points.
The Sun Devils' Crystal Cobb
lit up Stanford for 17 points the
last time the teams met but was
0-of-ll this time out. Teammate
Carolyn DeHoff was almost as
miserable as she went 0-of-10.
Card notes
With her sixth point last night,
Steding passed Virginia Sourlis for
third place on the all-time Stanford
scoring list. Steding now has 1,462
points â€” 49 fewer than the second
place Azzi.
With 19 points tomorrow, Stevens
