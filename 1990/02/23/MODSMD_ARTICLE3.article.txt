# Raisian defends Hoover's past
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Donning a dusty World War I fighting helmet,
the Hoover Institution's acting director, John
Raisian, came prepared to defend himself and his
institution at yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting.
Despite his militant headgear, however, he
delivered a peaceful message calling for a new era
of "productive dialogue" between Hoover and the
University, while Hoover critics called for a renewed
effort to bring the think tank under "normal aca
demic governance."
Raisian, who replaced W. Glenn Campbell as di
rector in September, smoothly deflected criticisms
from opponents and yet appeared to show little of
his predecessor's thirst for controversy in his con
genial address.
Campbell's 25 years of tenure were marred by a
bitter relationship with the Faculty Senate culminat
ing in a dispute over his plans for the Reagan
Library, once planned for the Stanford campus.
Members of the senate were not as quick as
Raisian to forget their spotty history with Hoover,
and some took up the motion, tabled in the fall of
1988, to place Hoover's appointment process under
tighter University control.
Political Science Prof. John Manley, longtime Hoo
ver critic, read from the 1988 petition signed by 18
Stanford faculty members, headed by Political Sci
ence Pforf. Alexander George. The petition sought
to bring Hoover under "normal academic gover
nance" by giving the University more control over
the institution'B academic appointments and publi
cations.
The senate at that time delayed discussion of the
matter because Campbell was about to retire, and
a new director had not yet been appointed.
Yesterday, Manley raised the
issue again. He asked Raisian to
allow the Faculty Senate to study
Hoover's proper relationship to
the University and the question
of "normal academic governance,"
and in the process to "close the
gap that has plagued relations"
between the two bodies.
Raisian deflected Manley's re
quest, saying, "We can accomplish
the same goal without moving in
the the way you're suggesting."
Raisian was backed vigorously
by University President Donald
Kennedy, who asked the chair to
dismiss Manley's line of question
ing and move forward with the
discussion, but a few others in
the senate shared Manley's skep
ticism.
"There seems to be a basic in
compatibility between increasing
dialogue and resistance to nor
malizing appointment proce
dures," said English Prof. Albert
Gelpi.
Manley also raised questions
about Hoover's conservativism
and its vow to "expose the evils
of the doctrine of Karl Marx."
Raisan played down accusations
that Hoover scholarship leans to
the right, and instead focused on
the institution's abundant ar
chives.
"The richness of Hoover's li

brary and archival collections is
often overlooked when matters
pertaining to Hoover-Stanford re
lations arise," Raisian said.
Together the library and ar
chives occupy 25 miles of shelving,
he said. Current acquisitions fill
up a mile of new shelving each
year.
Hoover's archives are open to
all members of the University
community, including students.
Raisian said he wants to include
students in his vision of a more
integrated Hoover, and said he is
exploring a program to involve
students in Hoover's research.
Raisian is also working with
University schools and depart
ments in "facilitating an
integration of Hoover scholars
into the teaching and research ac
tivities ongoing outside of Hoo
ver."
He cited Hoover's current rela
tionship with the Graduate School
of Business as a prime example,
involving courtesy appointments
and financial support for fellows
teaching Business School courses.
Raisian said greater interaction
between Hoover and the Univer
sity does not need to focus on
joint appointments. "I believe
Hoover should retain its own
fabric and unique identity," he
said.
"But," he acknowledged, "I do
subscribe to a 'gains from trade'
principle that should always be
kept in the forefront of our
thoughts."
