# Raisian defends Hoover's past
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Donning a dusty World War I fighting helmet,
the Hoover Institution's acting director, John
Raisian, came prepared to defend himself and his
institution at yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting.
Despite his militant headgear, however, he
delivered a peaceful message calling for a new era
of "productive dialogue" between Hoover and the
University, while Hoover critics called for a renewed
effort to bring the think tank under "normal aca
demic governance."
Raisian, who replaced W. Glenn Campbell as di
rector in September, smoothly deflected criticisms
from opponents and yet appeared to show little of
his predecessor's thirst for controversy in his con
genial address.
Campbell's 25 years of tenure were marred by a
bitter relationship with the Faculty Senate culminat
ing in a dispute over his plans for the Reagan
Library, once planned for the Stanford campus.
Members of the senate were not as quick as
Raisian to forget their spotty history with Hoover,
and some took up the motion, tabled in the fall of
1988, to place Hoover's appointment process under
tighter University control.
Political Science Prof. John Manley, longtime Hoo
ver critic, read from the 1988 petition signed by 18
Stanford faculty members, headed by Political Sci
ence Pforf. Alexander George. The petition sought
to bring Hoover under "normal academic gover
nance" by giving the University more control over
the institution'B academic appointments and publi
cations.
The senate at that time delayed discussion of the
matter because Campbell was about to retire, and
a new director had not yet been appointed.
