# Playing in the shadow of greatness
## Bret Boone ('Bob's son') makes name for himself 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Someday, people may stop
reminding USC's Bret Boone
that his father happens to be
one of the greatest catchers in
major league history. But don't
bet on it.
Boone, who entered the 1990
season as a consensus presea
son All-America second base
man for the Trojans, has been
living in the baseball shadow
of his father for his entire life.
And that's not surprising when
you consider that Bob Boone
— a four-time letterman for
the Stanford baseball team —
is a multi-Gold Glove winner
and recently set the major
league record for most games
caught in a career.
Nothing like a little pressure
on a kid, huh?
Actually, the younger Boone
says, when he first started
playing, the fact that his father
was the Angels' catcher (he's
now with the Kansas City
Royals) didn't make much of a
difference to him — mainly be
cause he just didn't listen to
people talk about it.
"I don't remember it going
on, but it must have," Bret
says."I didn't really notice it,
but I'm sure it happened. I'm
sure people said 'Oh, he's so
and-so's son,' but it really
didn't affect me."
It's easy to ignore the talk
when you're a great player in
your own right. Boone, who has
started all but one game for
the Trojans in his two years
with the team, is already USC's
all-time doubles leader with 43.
In 1989, he led the team in
games played, runs, RBI, dou
bles, triples, homers, walks and

sacrifice flies while becoming
one of only two sophomores
named to the All-Six-Pac team.
And, with even an average
campaign this season, Boone
will become the school's career
leader in runs (he needs 17 to
break the record of 138), in
RBI (where he's 32 away from
the 150 tallied by Mark
McGwire) and in triples. Add
in his skills in the field — "Bret
is a genuine major league
prospect, especially defensive
ly," says USC Coach Mike Gil
lespie — and you've got one
fantastic player. If only there
wasn't that shadow.
Boone isn't exactly worrying
about it."I think I've proven
myself as a player," he says.
"They can label me whatever
they want and it won't bother
me. Some people are always
gonna say 'He's Bob Boone's
son.' If I keep playing well, and
maybe make it to the pros, I'll
finally get to the point where
people stop saying that. If I
don't, no big deal."
Besides, the benefits of com
ing from a baseball family
(Bret's grandfather, Ray, was a
major-league infielder for 12
years) have far outweighed the
disadvantages. Not every boy
gets the chance to hang out
with pro baseball players — or
to learn from them.
"I don't think it hurt me,"
Boone says. "Actually, I don't
think I appreciated it as much
(as I do now) because I was
young. I kind of took it for
granted.
"I think I picked up a lot,
hanging out around the ball
park with the players," Boone
says."It was definitely a ben

and a playing legend in the Major Leagues.
efit. It really helped me, probably
in a lot of ways I don't even know
about."
You'd think that living under
the same roof as a former Stan
ford player (Bob Boone was the
Indians' MVP in 1969 as an All-
Conference third baseman) would
turn into a recruiting coup for
the Cardinal. No dice, though.
"Until my junior and senior
years I wanted to go to Arizona,"
Bret says. "Then we weighed the

schools and decided USC was the
best place for me." Why? "We
liked Coach Gillespie and the pro
gram, but it was the power of the
degree, really. It was also close to
home."
But did Dad make a pitch for
Stanford? "He told me how he
felt, but said 'You do what you
want,"' Bret says.
As the Trojans prepare to face
the Cardinal this weekend, Boone
says there's not really any extra
incentive for him when playing
Dad's alma mater. "It's just an
other series — in this league,
they're all tough," Boone says.

You'd think that living under
the same roof as a former Stan
ford player (Bob Boone was the
Indians' MVP in 1969 as an All-
Conference third baseman) would
turn into a recruiting coup for
the Cardinal. No dice, though.
"Until my junior and senior
years I wanted to go to Arizona,"
Bret says. "Then we weighed the

schools and decided USC was the
best place for me." Why? "We
liked Coach Gillespie and the pro
gram, but it was the power of the
degree, really. It was also close to
home."
But did Dad make a pitch for
Stanford? "He told me how he
felt, but said 'You do what you
want,"' Bret says.
As the Trojans prepare to face
the Cardinal this weekend, Boone
says there's not really any extra
incentive for him when playing
Dad's alma mater. "It's just an
other series — in this league,
they're all tough," Boone says.
Someday, people may stop
reminding USC's Bret Boone
that his father happens to be
one of the greatest catchers in
major league history. But don't
bet on it.
Boone, who entered the 1990
season as a consensus presea
son All-America second base
man for the Trojans, has been
living in the baseball shadow
of his father for his entire life.
And that's not surprising when
you consider that Bob Boone
— a four-time letterman for
the Stanford baseball team —
is a multi-Gold Glove winner
and recently set the major
league record for most games
caught in a career.
Nothing like a little pressure
on a kid, huh?
Actually, the younger Boone
says, when he first started
playing, the fact that his father
was the Angels' catcher (he's
now with the Kansas City
Royals) didn't make much of a
difference to him — mainly be
cause he just didn't listen to
people talk about it.
"I don't remember it going
on, but it must have," Bret
says."I didn't really notice it,
but I'm sure it happened. I'm
sure people said 'Oh, he's so
and-so's son,' but it really
didn't affect me."
It's easy to ignore the talk
when you're a great player in
your own right. Boone, who has
started all but one game for
the Trojans in his two years
with the team, is already USC's
all-time doubles leader with 43.
In 1989, he led the team in
games played, runs, RBI, dou
bles, triples, homers, walks and

sacrifice flies while becoming
one of only two sophomores
named to the All-Six-Pac team.
And, with even an average
campaign this season, Boone
will become the school's career
leader in runs (he needs 17 to
break the record of 138), in
RBI (where he's 32 away from
the 150 tallied by Mark
McGwire) and in triples. Add
in his skills in the field — "Bret
is a genuine major league
prospect, especially defensive
ly," says USC Coach Mike Gil
lespie — and you've got one
fantastic player. If only there
wasn't that shadow.
Boone isn't exactly worrying
about it."I think I've proven
myself as a player," he says.
"They can label me whatever
they want and it won't bother
me. Some people are always
gonna say 'He's Bob Boone's
son.' If I keep playing well, and
maybe make it to the pros, I'll
finally get to the point where
people stop saying that. If I
don't, no big deal."
Besides, the benefits of com
ing from a baseball family
(Bret's grandfather, Ray, was a
major-league infielder for 12
years) have far outweighed the
disadvantages. Not every boy
gets the chance to hang out
with pro baseball players — or
to learn from them.
"I don't think it hurt me,"
Boone says. "Actually, I don't
think I appreciated it as much
(as I do now) because I was
young. I kind of took it for
