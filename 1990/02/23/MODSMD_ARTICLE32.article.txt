# Birch gets a chance to reclaim top ranking
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Nine months ago, Sandra Birch
stepped up from the ranks of the
Ail-Americans and established
herself as the top player in col
legiate tennis.
Given Birch's immense talent,
it was almost expected. The ques
tion was not really whether she
would reach the top, but when.
The epiphany came on May 16,
1989 during the NCAA individual
singles tournament.
Despite holding a top-10 ranking
throughout the season, Birch was
not really considered one of the
favorites to capture the champi
onship. During the team compe
tition a few days early, she lost a
6-3, 6-3 decision to Oklahoma
State's Monika Waniek. The loss
to the relatively unheralded
Waniek did not do much for her
confidence.
Combine her less-than-ideal
mental state with a pulled
stomach muscle and you hardly
seem to have the recipe for an
NCAA title. Yet, there she was,
locked in a quarterfinal battle
with Pepperdine's Ginger Hel
geson.
The Waves' star came out and
played a flawless first set. Hel
geson scored a 6-3 decision over
Birch and did not make a single
unforced error â€” at least not with
her racket. Ahead 3-2, Helgeson
made a obscene remark to the
umpire and earned herself a warn
ing.
It seemed irrelevant at the time,
but, after breaking Birch to open

the second set, Helgeson was slow
coming off the changeover. Chair
umpire Fred Tausig assessed a
game penalty on Helgeson (the
standard for two-time rule
breakers) for a violation he called
"too significant to ignore."
With the momentum suddenly
shifted, Birch won the second and
third sets and then later went on
to win the NCAA Championship.
Helgeson could only think of what
might have been.
Birch held onto the No. 1
ranking she earned last season up
until two weeks ago. At the Rolex
Indoor Championships in Minne
apolis, Birch had to default her
semifinal match due to illness.
Her opponent would have been
none other than Ginger Helgeson.
Helgeson won the tournament
and, in so doing, took over the
top spot in the latest Volvo
rankings.
Tomorrow, Birch will get an
other chance at Helgeson as the
fifth-ranked Waves visit the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium hoping to
knock off the Cardinal.
Due to the weight the rankings
place on mqjor events such as the
Rolex, a Birch win will not guar
antee her return to No. 1. Still,
the anticipated showdown prom
ises not to disappoint.
Card notes
Meredith Mc(>rath is not feeling
well and will not play singles in today's
match. She may be able to play in
the Pepperdine match Saturday. If she
can go, her opponent will be the crafty
Janna Kovacevich
