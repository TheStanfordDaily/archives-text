# Fifth-year senior Lambert still has NCAA goals, dreams
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Adversity and athletics have al
ways gone hand in hand. Not only
is it the nature of sport that for
every winner there are tens of
losers, but athletes always face
the possibility of injury.
Despite facing both forms of ad
versity — being unable to compete
as well as competing and losing
— swimmer Bethanne Lambert
is back in the pool this year and
swimming faster than she ever
has before.
The No. 1 Cardinal women's
swim team is competing at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships today, tomorrow and Sun
day in East Los Angeles.
The fifth-year senior originally
came to Stanford as a three-time
All-American in the breaststroke,
but a neck ir\jury forced her to
miss the entire season. "It was
kind of a gradual thing and it just
kept getting worse," she said. "I
made a decision to stop swimming
for a couple of months. After that
it was fine."
After redshirting that year, she
began competition the following
season. Stanford went to the
NCAA Championships as a
decided underdog, but came
within a mere 17 points of win
ning the whole thing. That win
ning margin by Texas is the small
est in NCAA history. But despite
coming so close, Lambert and her
teammates were encouraged by
their success instead of being dis
couraged by coming so close.
"That was tough, but it was

very exciting because people
didn't think we could win," she
said. "It was exciting and helped
us. Even my junior year I think
we were more confident. We just
didn't have a good meet that
year. ... By last year, certainly,
the girls who were still here were
maybe anticipating we could win."
They were right. After the
somewhat disappointing third

place finish in 1988, the Cardinal
won the NCAA title last season.
Unfortunately for Lambert, how
ever, she was not in Indianapolis
to celebrate the victory. She in
jured her back earlier in the
season and missed the rest of the
year.
"I only swam in one meet," she
said. "It was hard, but at the same
time I was really happy for them,

especially my class, the seniors. I
knew I had another year."
After missing nearly two full
seasons to injuries, Lambert was
hoping she could return to the
form that brought her to a ninth
place finish in the 200-yard
breaststroke in the 1987 NCAA
Championships and an llth-place
finish the following year.
"At the start of the year I was

just thinking in terms of
(personal) best times and to be
healthy," she said. "Now that I've
done that, I'm looking forward to
goals I used to have. ... I'd cer
tainly like to final in both my
events (the 100 and 200
breaststrokes)."
During preseason training,
however, even the simplest of
those goals was in question. "I
was sick this fall and I was lucky
to make five workouts a week,"
she said.
So much so that she has already
swum a lifetime best in the 100
breaststroke this season. Consid
ering that swimmers train in
tensely during the regular season
to prepare them for the NCAA
Championships, and that they
don't rest that much for dual
meets, swimming a personal best
during the regular season is un
common. While she hasn't been
quite as fast in the 200 breast
stroke, her stronger event, she

feels she is right on pace to swim
a persona] best in that event as
well at the NCAA meet in three
weeks.
"It's certainly the best season
I've had," she said. "I feel good
about it. I feel real strong."
Lambert has benefitted from
swimming with some of the na
tion's best breaststrokers while
she's been on the Farm. Team
mates Jill Johnson and Lori
Heisick are top contenders for in
dividual titles in both breaststroke
events, and Susan Johnson and
J.T. Toton are each returning All-
Americans.
"It's also helped having the
great group we have," Lambert
said. "It's challenging to train
with them. I also think we have
a good camaraderie. It's some
thing I look forward to for
NCAAs."
Lambert and her teammates
also have the goal of repeating as
NCAA champions. "We feel we
have something to defend."

Breaststroker Bethanne Lambert will leave five years of adversity behind her In the blocks when she
swims this weekend at the Pacific 10 Conference Championships in Los Angeles.
Adversity and athletics have al
ways gone hand in hand. Not only
is it the nature of sport that for
every winner there are tens of
losers, but athletes always face
the possibility of injury.
Despite facing both forms of ad
versity — being unable to compete
as well as competing and losing
— swimmer Bethanne Lambert
is back in the pool this year and
swimming faster than she ever
has before.
The No. 1 Cardinal women's
swim team is competing at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships today, tomorrow and Sun
day in East Los Angeles.
The fifth-year senior originally
came to Stanford as a three-time
All-American in the breaststroke,
but a neck ir\jury forced her to
miss the entire season. "It was
kind of a gradual thing and it just
kept getting worse," she said. "I
made a decision to stop swimming
for a couple of months. After that
it was fine."
After redshirting that year, she
began competition the following
season. Stanford went to the
NCAA Championships as a
decided underdog, but came
within a mere 17 points of win
ning the whole thing. That win
ning margin by Texas is the small
est in NCAA history. But despite
coming so close, Lambert and her
teammates were encouraged by
their success instead of being dis
couraged by coming so close.
"That was tough, but it was

very exciting because people
didn't think we could win," she
said. "It was exciting and helped
us. Even my junior year I think
we were more confident. We just
didn't have a good meet that
year. ... By last year, certainly,
the girls who were still here were
maybe anticipating we could win."
They were right. After the
somewhat disappointing third

place finish in 1988, the Cardinal
won the NCAA title last season.
Unfortunately for Lambert, how
ever, she was not in Indianapolis
to celebrate the victory. She in
jured her back earlier in the
season and missed the rest of the
year.
"I only swam in one meet," she
said. "It was hard, but at the same
time I was really happy for them,

especially my class, the seniors. I
knew I had another year."
After missing nearly two full
seasons to injuries, Lambert was
hoping she could return to the
form that brought her to a ninth
place finish in the 200-yard
breaststroke in the 1987 NCAA
Championships and an llth-place
finish the following year.
"At the start of the year I was

just thinking in terms of
(personal) best times and to be
healthy," she said. "Now that I've
done that, I'm looking forward to
goals I used to have. ... I'd cer
tainly like to final in both my
events (the 100 and 200
breaststrokes)."
During preseason training,
however, even the simplest of
those goals was in question. "I
was sick this fall and I was lucky
to make five workouts a week,"
she said.
So much so that she has already
swum a lifetime best in the 100
breaststroke this season. Consid
ering that swimmers train in
tensely during the regular season
to prepare them for the NCAA
Championships, and that they
don't rest that much for dual
meets, swimming a personal best
during the regular season is un
common. While she hasn't been
quite as fast in the 200 breast
stroke, her stronger event, she

feels she is right on pace to swim
a persona] best in that event as
well at the NCAA meet in three
weeks.
"It's certainly the best season
I've had," she said. "I feel good
about it. I feel real strong."
