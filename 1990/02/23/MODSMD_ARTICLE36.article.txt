# Frosh Bender is a self-made gymnast

One year ago, freshman Jeff
Bender looked more like a main
tenance worker than a gymnast.
Hauling in various pieces of equip
ment before practice and disman
tling them afterwards, he got
more of a workout setting up his
gym than many people get from
a training session.
Bender's hometown of Lan
caster, Calif, is situated in the
Mojave Desert and is not what
would typically be considered
gymnastics country. Nonetheless,
his interest in the sport began at
an early age and he began training
by the time he was seven years
old.
Eventually, the dearth of gym
nastics clubs in the area began to
take its toll. After switching back
and forth between three gyms
over a span of several years,
Bender and three other gymnasts
were able to rent the gym of a
local school to use for their work
outs.
The conditions were far from
luxurious, however. Through the
manual labor of Bender and his
teammates, a makeshift gymnas
tics training center would spring
up on the hardwood floors of the
school's basketball court three
times a week. At the end of prac
tice, all of the equipment had to
be folded up and stored away to
make room for the next day's
school activites.
Luckily, Bender did not let this
discourage him from working out.
"I always did it for fun and not
for becoming the best," he said.
"I consider it a great accomplish
ment to have made it this far."
Indeed, Bender's background
makes his achievements that
much more impressive. Despite
his less-than-desirable workout

conditions, he was able to compete
in the Junior Olympic National
Championships for three years in
a row.
During the recruiting season of
his senior year, Bender decided to
write coach Sadao Hamada and
express his desire to be on the
Stanford team. An accompanying
videotape earned him a chance to
meet with Hamada, who was im
pressed by his level of skill and
unusual build — Bender is 5-foot
-9 — for a gymnast.
"Jeffs height makes him a
physically unique gymnast. In
many ways he is built more like
a basketball player than a gym

nast," Hamada said. "His height
gives him an advantage on the
high bar and pommel horse, but
it makes rings more difficult.
Now that he is here at Stanford,
Bender is struck by how much his
gymnastics career has changed.
"Now I have a real gym and I'm
working out more than twice as
much as I used to. I finally have
the possibility to realize my po
tential," he said.
As the team's depth has been
hampered by ir\juries, his role has
become increasingly important.
"Right now I'm just concentrating
on staying healthy," he said.

Lanky 5-foot-9 freshman gymnast Jeff Bender has added needed depth — and height — to Coach
Hamada's Stanford squad. Despite injuries, Stanford's 1990 team is one of the top in the nation.
