World Cup soccer
in Stanford Stadium
It may be the best-kept secret
on campus, but one of the big
gest U.S. sporting events of 1990
is happening on the Stanford
campus tomorrow. For the first
time in more than a decade on
North American soil, the U.S.
and U.S.S.R. national soccer
teams will battle each other at
1:30 p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
A crowd of nearly 60,000 is
expected for the match between
the two World Cup-bound
squads. While the Soviets are
one of the favorites to win the
Cup, played this summer in
Italy, the U.S. team is an un
derdog that has qualified for the
first time since 1950.
This game will be the last time
the U.S. team will play in this
country before the World Cup.
Spikers take on 49ers
In a year when the Long Beach
State 49ers claimed the women's
NCAA volleyball championship
and the San Francisco 49ers
claimed everything else, Long
Beach's male volleyball counter
parts will attempt to maintain
49er fortunes as the team comes
to Burnham Pavilion tomorrow
for a 7:00 p.m. WIVA conference
match against the Cardinal.
Stanford (5-1, 5-0 in WTVA),
who this week seized the No.l
ranking in the Tachikara
Coaches' Poll after an string of

undefeated matches, may face its
most challenging opponent of the
season in the No. 4 Long Beach
squad (10-2, 4-0).
"The 49er8 are one of the defi
nite contenders for a playoff
spot," Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. "The first time we
saw them, we knew they would
be a very strong team.

Golfers to tackle grass
As play commences in today's
opening round of the Miami
(Fla.) Intercollegiate, the Stan
ford men's golf team faces
several unknown commodities: a
new lineup, tke strength of a
fine 18-team field, and the play
ing conditions in southern Flor
ida.
However, the Cardinal
linksters seem primarily preoc
cupied with grass. The squad
will seek to overcome the chal
lenge presented by the renowned
Bermuda grass of the Doral Park
Resort in Miami. Bermuda grass
courses possess a more signifi
cant grain than links composed
of more common bent grasses,
like the Stanford Golf Course.
Stanford Coach Wally Good
win was concerned about the im
pact of this botanical nightmare
on his team. "Not only does this
course require pinpoint accuracy
from the tees, we've got to face
greens on which putting can of
ten be a guess," he said.
Joining returning starters

Christian Cevaer, Don Christian
sen, Marc Funseth and Brad
Geer will be freshman David
Rutkowski.

Gymnasts head south
The Cardinal women gym
nasts will look to add a few more
wins to the team's record when
they compete at the Cal Poly-
SLO Invite tomorrow night in
southern California.
Stanford — favored to win the
meet — will compete against
Seattle Pacific, UC-San Diego,
San Jose State and Texas Wom
en's University, with SPU and
the host Mustangs expected to
pose the greatest challenges.
"If practice reflects what we're
going to do in the meet, we'll
do very well," Asst. Coach Penny
Hauschild said.

Diving into Pac-lOs
Although the Pacific 10 Men's
Swimming Championship does
not start until next Thursday,
the Stanford men's diving team
will attempt to give the Cardinal
a head start on their ninth
straight Pac-10 Championship
this weekend with their perform
ance at the conference diving
meet.
Three freshmen, Richard
Endriss, Mark Kraus and Brad
Wightman, will spin into the
USC McDonald's Olympic Swim

Complex starting this morning
and continuing throughout the
weekend.

Running down Bears
Just weeks after the Athletic
Department announced cuts in
the track and field program's
scholarship budget, the team's
morale is ironically quite high
as it heads into the Bay Area
Relays tomorrow. The outdoor
season-opener for Stanford, the
meet will be run at California
and will feature various col
legiate teams from around the
Bay Area.
"If practice is any indication,
we should turn in some pretty
decent performances," Stanford
Coach Brooks Johnson said.

Slav poloers visit
As the United States and the
U.S.S.R soccer teams prepare to
fight it out in Stanford Stadium,
the Yugoslavs will be attempting
to stake their own claim of the
West on Saturday morning. The
Yugoslavian Partizan Belgrade,
one of the premier clubs in the
world, will face off against a
Stanford all-star squad in
deGuerre Pool at 11:30 a.m.
Partizan Belgrade, coached by
1984 and 1988 Yugoslavian
Olympic Coach Ratkok Rudic,
has dominated European water
polo in recent years.

Spikers take on 49ers
In a year when the Long Beach
State 49ers claimed the women's
NCAA volleyball championship
and the San Francisco 49ers
claimed everything else, Long
Beach's male volleyball counter
parts will attempt to maintain
49er fortunes as the team comes
to Burnham Pavilion tomorrow
for a 7:00 p.m. WIVA conference
match against the Cardinal.
Stanford (5-1, 5-0 in WTVA),
who this week seized the No.l
ranking in the Tachikara
Coaches' Poll after an string of

undefeated matches, may face its
most challenging opponent of the
season in the No. 4 Long Beach
squad (10-2, 4-0).
"The 49er8 are one of the defi
nite contenders for a playoff
spot," Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. "The first time we
saw them, we knew they would
be a very strong team.

Golfers to tackle grass
As play commences in today's
opening round of the Miami
(Fla.) Intercollegiate, the Stan
ford men's golf team faces
several unknown commodities: a
new lineup, tke strength of a
fine 18-team field, and the play
ing conditions in southern Flor
ida.
However, the Cardinal
linksters seem primarily preoc
cupied with grass. The squad
will seek to overcome the chal
lenge presented by the renowned
Bermuda grass of the Doral Park
Resort in Miami. Bermuda grass
courses possess a more signifi
cant grain than links composed
of more common bent grasses,
like the Stanford Golf Course.
Stanford Coach Wally Good
win was concerned about the im
pact of this botanical nightmare
on his team. "Not only does this
course require pinpoint accuracy
from the tees, we've got to face
greens on which putting can of
ten be a guess," he said.

Christian Cevaer, Don Christian
sen, Marc Funseth and Brad
Geer will be freshman David
Rutkowski.
