# Faculty Senate gets streamlining update
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
The more than 100 faculty members who
met with a University committee last quarter
were generally frustrated with Stanford's bu
reaucracy, the committee chair told the Faculty
Senate yesterday.
Vice President for Information Resources
Robert Street, who chairs the Action Plans
for Change committee, said many faculty felt
that the bureaucracy is used as an excuse for
inaction on important issues.
The committee, formed last October, seeks
to restructure the University's organization
by streamlining its operations. The committee
last week was merged into a committee headed
by Provost James Rosse that is overseeing
Stanford's effort to reduce its operating budget
by $22 million in 18 months.
"[Action Plans for Change] is part of the
larger effort to reposition the University for
the future," Rosse toid the senate yesterday.
Street said increasing budget constraints
and inefficient bureaucracy facing the Univer
sity have changed the financial environment
in which it operates.
"If we do not respond vigorously and manage
our resources wisely, this changing environ
ment will impose serious limits on our ability
to grow and innovate in the future
as we have done in the past,"
Street said.
In addition to conducting the
faculty survey, the committee has
set up five "action teams" focus
ing on various parts of the Uni
versity that have been targeted
for streamlining. The areas in
clude payroll, University libraries,
human resources and others.
Street said work is going for
ward in all five areas, but some
faculty at the meeting remained

wary of the committee's work.
"I'm somewhat skeptical be
cause all faculty involved had been
involved in administrative posi
tions," said Education Prof. Denis
Phillips, reiterating a previous
concern of the Faculty Senate,
In October, when the commit
tee's proposal to revamp the Uni
versity's bureaucracy was first
presented to the senate, some fac
ulty expressed worry that the
committee did not accurately
reflect faculty sentiment.
The committee consists of 10
professors, administrators and lo
cal business executives appointed
by Rosse.
