# Wynter: University must explore intellectual wonderland
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Editorial staff 
Sylvia Wynter may be Allan
Bloom's worst nightmare.
His ideological opposite, she is
intimately familiar with the
Western tradition. To talk with
her is to embark on a philosophi
cal and historical odyssey, touch
ing on such prominent figures

as Fanon, Foucalt, Shakespeare
and Levi-Strauss.
But unlike Bloom, Wynter
draws a radical message from
those thinkers — she sees a des
perate need to revolutionize
traditional academic disciplines
to account for issues of race.
The interim chair of Stan
ford's program in African and
Afro-American Studies, Wynter

sees the 20th anniversary of the
program as a new opportunity
to raise many of the questions
that the 1960s left unanswered.
"Racism actually appeared in
the world when the West [was]
the first group in human history
to introduce a classification sys
tem that was not anchored in
the gods," she says.
After Columbus' voyages to
the New World, European
humanists created the concept
of natural law, which took prec
edence over religion, Wynter ex
plains.
Without a spiritual guarantee
of legitimacy, Europeans used
race to facilitate their coloniza
tion of America, she says.
The peoples of Africa and the
Americas were perceived as
"raw," "putrid" and "dan
gerous," Wynter says, whereas
the Europeans saw themselves
as representing "purity, safety,
culture."
"Whiteness could take the
place of being French or being
Slavic," she says. "Whiteness be
comes a cohering principle, and
it can only become a cohering
principle if you exclude non
whites."
Much of Western literature
and philosophy stigmatizes
blacks, Wynter says. Hegel, for
instance, depicts "Africa as the
pre-history of human conscious
ness. Human consciousness
would then begin in the East,
be an adolescent in Greece, and
where do you think it was going
to rise to full flower? Where else,
but in Hegel's own Germany,"
she says.
Gender and class are also stig
matized in Western thinking,
she says. "We have to see that
they are a system and they func
tion to reinforce each other."
Race remains the focal point,
however. When isolated, gender
and class concerns provide in
choate worldviews, she says.
"Why has Marxism failed?"
she asks. "It's not that it wasn't
true, but it was incomplete. It
was only looking from the per

spective of class. What you
needed ... was other perspec
tives."
Similarly, feminism is inade
quate when taken by itself,
Wynter says.
Feminism in its present form
has "clearly been to the advan
tage of upwardly mobile Euro-
American women."
White feminists and their hus
bands have become "the New
Rich, because they now have big
paychecks together," she adds.
Wynter contends that Ameri
can society is primarily ordered
by race, with white and black at
the extremes.
"The real distinction is be
tween black and white. All the
other differences are effects of
this basic difference, [which]
functions for our order as the
difference between the celestial
and terrestial functioned for the
feudal order," Wynter says.
"That's why you would find
Chicanos, for example, who
would be as racist as any white
toward blacks.
When people attack the West
on issues like ethnic studies,
mu 11 icu 11 ural is m and
Afrocentrism, they view the
debates from a western perspec
tive, according to Wynter.
"What we are calling multi
culturalism is really the term
for an enormous problem: How
can we invent a culture which
no longer coincides with a spe
cific genotype?"
In the 19605, people began to
see that the perspectives of
blacks, Native Americans and
Chicanos had been excluded
from American reality, she says.
"The problem that confronts us
is integrating all Americans —
and doing it consciously."
"In multiculturalism, you do
something even more dangerous.
You equate the non-white groups
with the white ethnic groups
who are now bidding for cultural
hegemony and trying to displace
the WASPs.
' If we get sidetracked on that
smaller issue. . . she says.

her is to embark on a philosophi
cal and historical odyssey, touch
ing on such prominent figures

as Fanon, Foucalt, Shakespeare
and Levi-Strauss.
But unlike Bloom, Wynter
draws a radical message from
those thinkers — she sees a des
perate need to revolutionize
traditional academic disciplines
to account for issues of race.
The interim chair of Stan
ford's program in African and
Afro-American Studies, Wynter

sees the 20th anniversary of the
program as a new opportunity
to raise many of the questions
that the 1960s left unanswered.
"Racism actually appeared in
the world when the West [was]
the first group in human history
to introduce a classification sys
tem that was not anchored in
the gods," she says.
After Columbus' voyages to
the New World, European
humanists created the concept
of natural law, which took prec
edence over religion, Wynter ex
plains.
Without a spiritual guarantee
of legitimacy, Europeans used
race to facilitate their coloniza
tion of America, she says.
The peoples of Africa and the
Americas were perceived as
"raw," "putrid" and "dan
gerous," Wynter says, whereas
the Europeans saw themselves
as representing "purity, safety,
culture."
"Whiteness could take the
place of being French or being
Slavic," she says. "Whiteness be
comes a cohering principle, and
it can only become a cohering
principle if you exclude non
whites."
Much of Western literature
and philosophy stigmatizes
blacks, Wynter says. Hegel, for
instance, depicts "Africa as the
pre-history of human conscious
ness. Human consciousness
would then begin in the East,
be an adolescent in Greece, and
where do you think it was going
to rise to full flower? Where else,
but in Hegel's own Germany,"
she says.
Gender and class are also stig
matized in Western thinking,
she says. "We have to see that
they are a system and they func
tion to reinforce each other."
Race remains the focal point,
however. When isolated, gender
and class concerns provide in
choate worldviews, she says.
"Why has Marxism failed?"
she asks. "It's not that it wasn't
true, but it was incomplete. It
was only looking from the per

spective of class. What you
needed ... was other perspec
tives."
Similarly, feminism is inade
quate when taken by itself,
Wynter says.
Feminism in its present form
has "clearly been to the advan
tage of upwardly mobile Euro-
American women."
White feminists and their hus
bands have become "the New
Rich, because they now have big
paychecks together," she adds.
Wynter contends that Ameri
can society is primarily ordered
by race, with white and black at
the extremes.
"The real distinction is be
tween black and white. All the
other differences are effects of
this basic difference, [which]
functions for our order as the
difference between the celestial
and terrestial functioned for the
feudal order," Wynter says.
"That's why you would find
Chicanos, for example, who
would be as racist as any white
toward blacks.
When people attack the West
on issues like ethnic studies,
mu 11 icu 11 ural is m and
Afrocentrism, they view the
debates from a western perspec
tive, according to Wynter.
"What we are calling multi
culturalism is really the term
for an enormous problem: How
can we invent a culture which
no longer coincides with a spe
cific genotype?"
In the 19605, people began to
see that the perspectives of
blacks, Native Americans and
Chicanos had been excluded
from American reality, she says.
"The problem that confronts us
is integrating all Americans —
and doing it consciously."
"In multiculturalism, you do
something even more dangerous.
You equate the non-white groups
with the white ethnic groups
who are now bidding for cultural
hegemony and trying to displace
the WASPs.
' If we get sidetracked on that
smaller issue. . . she says.

Sylvia Winter, the interim chair of African and Afro-American
Studies, wants the program to revolutionize traditional academic
disciplines to account for issues of race.
