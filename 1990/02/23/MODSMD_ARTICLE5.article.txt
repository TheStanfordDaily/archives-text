# Grad students discuss theme dorm
## Proposal calls for new multicultural focus house 
### Bernadine Chee Staff writer 
The first meeting to dis
cuss development of a graduate
student multicultural theme
house left many questions un
answered but attested to the need
for a multicultural residence pro
gram for graduate students.
At the Wednesday meeting, the
United Graduate Student Alliance
presented its proposal for a mul
ticultural theme house to the
Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee.
Although the advisory commit
tee recognized the need to develop
some kind of multicultural resi
dence program, the form of such
a program will be decided after
more extensive discussion. The
committee will meet again next
month.

The advisory committee is a
graduate student group that
serves as a liaison between grad
uate students and the Office of
Residential Affairs and the
Housing Center.
Rodger Whitney, director of
housing, suggested that the mul
ticultural residence program be
developed in all graduate
residences through a system of
multicultural cluster communi
ties.
Clusters of students interested
in exploring multicultural issues
could be placed together in
various community arrangements
throughout graduate student res
idences. Focused programming on
multicultural issues would also be
arranged, he said.
Whitney suggested that five
students in charge of multicul
tural programming could live in

the Rains
Houses, which
would be the hub
of the multicul
tural program
ming.
Jean Kim, di
rector of graduate
residences, sup
ported Whitney's
proposal. She said

the benefit of a cluster system is
that multicultural communities
would be accessible to all graduate
students on campus, not just those
in the theme house.
However, Lisa Richardson, a
graduate student member of the
alliance, said she sees a substan
tial difference between Whitney's
cluster system and the alliance's
version of the theme house.

The theme house would consist
of students highly committed to
participating in multicultural pro
gramming and who are drawn
from a pool of the entire graduate
student population, she said. Also,
the only difference between the
clusters and the situation in grad
uate residences now is that the
students interested in multicul
tural issues will be next door, not
down the hall, said Richardson.
"We want a theme house where
[the house] is a priority in their
time commitments and not just a
place to live," said David Rimer,
an ASSU undergraduate senator
working with the alliance.
Although the creation of a
theme house and the development
of multicultural community
clusters may not be mutually ex
clusive, members of the alliance
want to concentrate their efforts
on the establishment of a theme
house for next year.
However, because the informa
tion booklets for next year's grad
uate housing will soon be mailed

There may be a theme
house next year, but
its structure is yet to
be determined.

around the world to students, it
is unlikely that arrangements can
be made to inform students about
the theme house option before the
May housing lottery.
Although Whitney said he
thinks there will definitely be a
theme house next year, its organ
ization may differ from that pro
posed by the alliance.
Maria Balderrama, who has
been working for more than a year
on the theme house proposal, ex
pressed frustration that the
theme house as proposed by the
alliance may not be in place next
year.
"I feel let down because we've
been good students, doing what
we're told [to create the theme
house,] and then we don't get our
reward," she said.
However, she said she appreci
ated the graduate residence of
fice's help this year.
