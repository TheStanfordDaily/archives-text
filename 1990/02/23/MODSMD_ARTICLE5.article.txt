# Grad students discuss theme dorm
## Proposal calls for new multicultural focus house 
### Bernadine Chee Staff writer 
The first meeting to dis
cuss development of a graduate
student multicultural theme
house left many questions un
answered but attested to the need
for a multicultural residence pro
gram for graduate students.
At the Wednesday meeting, the
United Graduate Student Alliance
presented its proposal for a mul
ticultural theme house to the
Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee.
Although the advisory commit
tee recognized the need to develop
some kind of multicultural resi
dence program, the form of such
a program will be decided after
more extensive discussion. The
committee will meet again next
month.

The advisory committee is a
graduate student group that
serves as a liaison between grad
uate students and the Office of
Residential Affairs and the
Housing Center.
Rodger Whitney, director of
housing, suggested that the mul
ticultural residence program be
developed in all graduate
residences through a system of
multicultural cluster communi
ties.
Clusters of students interested
in exploring multicultural issues
could be placed together in
various community arrangements
throughout graduate student res
idences. Focused programming on
multicultural issues would also be
arranged, he said.
Whitney suggested that five
students in charge of multicul
tural programming could live in

the Rains
Houses, which
would be the hub
of the multicul
tural program
ming.
Jean Kim, di
rector of graduate
residences, sup
ported Whitney's
proposal. She said

the benefit of a cluster system is
that multicultural communities
would be accessible to all graduate
students on campus, not just those
in the theme house.
However, Lisa Richardson, a
graduate student member of the
alliance, said she sees a substan
tial difference between Whitney's
cluster system and the alliance's
version of the theme house.
