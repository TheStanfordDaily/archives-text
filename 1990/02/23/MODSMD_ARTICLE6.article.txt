# Tight-lipped Gibbons once again in the running for MIT presidency
## 
### Michelle Campos 
Just when Stanford engineering buffs
thought they could sleep easy because
their dean was not heading East, they
found out their relief might have been
premature.
Weeks ago, Engineering Dean James
Gibbons was feared lost to MIT, and this
week, those fears have resurfaced.
Gibbons was considered a leading can
didate for the presidency of MIT until
last week, when Phillip Sharp, an MIT
biology professor, was officially
nominated.
Sharp withdrew his nomination Tues

day, however, citing a desire to continue
his research and teaching.
The presidency is once again up for
grabs, and Gibbons may still be consid
ered for the presidency. However, nobody,
including the tight-lipped dean, is willing
to say much about the search.
Walter Milne — assistant chairman of
the MIT Corp., who is not involved with
the search directly but is familiar with
the process — refused to comment on
individual candidates.
"The search process will be resumed
in some mode determined by the trustees
next Friday," Milne said in a telephone
interview.

The resumed presiden
tial search may draw
from the original list of
candidates or begin fresh
with a new list, according
to Milne.
Gibbons' administra
tive assistant, Mary
Cloutier, insists Gibbons
hasn't heard from the
MIT search committees
since Sharp's withdrawal

According to Cloutier, the dean "isn't
interested in (the presidency! anymore.
He has a lot he still wants to do at
Stanford." Last month Gibbons told The

Daily he was not looking for a new job.
An MIT faculty member saw Gibbons
on the MIT campus one-and-a-half weeks
ago — just before the announcement of
Sharp's nomination — the MIT student
newspaper, The Tech, reported. Gibbons'
assistant, however, said Gibbons has not
been to Boston since December.
Gibbons was reportedly pleased by
Sharp's nomination and wrote a letter
congratulating the nominee.
MIT is not the only university to woo
Gibbons recently. He has also been a can
didate for the Carnegie Mellon University
presidency. However, a source close to
Gibbons said, "If he doesn't take [the

position] at MIT he's certainly not going
to at Carnegie Mellon."
Another source close to Gibbons said
Gibbons had been somewhat interested
in the MIT job, at least until Sharp's
nomination was announced.
Gibbons has not responded to several
phone messages left this week.
Paul Joskow, an MIT economics pro
fessor, is also currently considered a
leading candidate for the presidency. A
source told The Tech that Joskow spoke
to the selection committees as late as
Feb. 9, and the source referred to him
as a "dark horse" candidate.
