## Rape victims face a judicial system in need of repair 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
When "Nina" saw a male acquaintance
at a fraternity party one Friday night
last spring, she began talking with him.
He asked her to go to another fraternity
party, where they drank and danced.
When Nina woke up later that night,
she could feel the semen running down
her leg. But she was drunk and couldn't
believe what was happening.
When she realized she was naked in
bed with a man on top of her, she was
too drunk and confused to respond to
the male, a student she had met a few
times before.
"I remember gasping a little in pain,"
Nina recalls, but she then passed out
again.
Nina remembers little else from that
night.
She does, however, remember the days
following the incident very clearly.
The next day, she woke up around 8
a.m., got dressed and walked home to
her dormitory across campus.
Later that day, Nina started to realize
that she may have been raped — not
by a strange man, but by a student she
knew. "It started to hit me and really
bother me," Nina says, her voice
shaking. "I started to cry."
"By mid-afternoon, I was sure that I
was raped," says Nina, now a junior.

Nina's case was reported to the Uni
versity's Judicial Affairs Office, but the
office never filed charges against the
alleged assailant. The office's handling
of the case raises a crucial question: Is
Judicial Affairs set up in a way that
allows it to competently handle cases of
sexual assault?
People who have survived rapes, some
administrators, and others who work
with the issue say the answer is no.
And if the University intends to punish
rapists, they say, it must adopt a more
sensitive and effective process.
According to the California Penal
Code, rape is defined as forced sexual
intercourse that is perpetrated against
the will of the victim. Title 9, section
261 says rape has occurred "where a
person is prevented from resisting by
any intoxication or anesthetic substance,
or any controlled substance, adminis

tered by or with the privity of the ac
cused."
Acquaintance rape, the most prevalent
form of rape on college campuses, may
be perpetrated by a date or boyfriend
of the victim, or by someone the victim
knows only casually — from a dormitory,
a class, or through mutual friends, ac
cording to the Santa Monica Rape Treat
ment Center's handbook "Sexual Assault
on Campus: What Colleges Can Do."
The book states, "Regardless of the
relationship between them, if one person
uses force to coerce another into sub
mitting to sexual intercourse, the act is
defined as rape."
Nina says: "It's very difficult to trust
any of your friends once one of your
friends — someone everyone trusted —
turns on you. I didn't even know him
that well. He knew all of my friends,
though."
Senior Suzanna Mak, founder and ad
ministrative director of Heightened Ed
ucation on Acquaintance Rape, says,"I
can't stress enough, it's probably going
to be someone on your floor, someone
you meet at a party, someone you go
on a date with.
"I know that's where it happens, and
unfortunately the survivors know that.
It's going to be someone you know," she
says.
Nina says many people doubted that
she was raped because she and the male
student were drunk at the time.
But junior Suzanne O'Brien, a mem
ber of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, says, "People don't know
that if a woman is drunk (when she is
raped), that is assault, that is rape be
cause she did not consent."
Alcohol "impairs a person's ability to
say no and it makes a person raping
you less responsive to your needs," she
