# Reporting The Reality
## Rape victims face a judicial system in need of repair 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
When "Nina" saw a male acquaintance
at a fraternity party one Friday night
last spring, she began talking with him.
He asked her to go to another fraternity
party, where they drank and danced.
When Nina woke up later that night,
she could feel the semen running down
her leg. But she was drunk and couldn't
believe what was happening.
When she realized she was naked in
bed with a man on top of her, she was
too drunk and confused to respond to
the male, a student she had met a few
times before.
"I remember gasping a little in pain,"
Nina recalls, but she then passed out
again.
Nina remembers little else from that
night.
She does, however, remember the days
following the incident very clearly.
The next day, she woke up around 8
a.m., got dressed and walked home to
her dormitory across campus.
Later that day, Nina started to realize
that she may have been raped — not
by a strange man, but by a student she
knew. "It started to hit me and really
bother me," Nina says, her voice
shaking. "I started to cry."
"By mid-afternoon, I was sure that I
was raped," says Nina, now a junior.

Nina's case was reported to the Uni
versity's Judicial Affairs Office, but the
office never filed charges against the
alleged assailant. The office's handling
of the case raises a crucial question: Is
Judicial Affairs set up in a way that
allows it to competently handle cases of
sexual assault?
People who have survived rapes, some
administrators, and others who work
with the issue say the answer is no.
And if the University intends to punish
rapists, they say, it must adopt a more
sensitive and effective process.
According to the California Penal
Code, rape is defined as forced sexual
intercourse that is perpetrated against
the will of the victim. Title 9, section
261 says rape has occurred "where a
person is prevented from resisting by
any intoxication or anesthetic substance,
or any controlled substance, adminis

tered by or with the privity of the ac
cused."
Acquaintance rape, the most prevalent
form of rape on college campuses, may
be perpetrated by a date or boyfriend
of the victim, or by someone the victim
knows only casually — from a dormitory,
a class, or through mutual friends, ac
cording to the Santa Monica Rape Treat
ment Center's handbook "Sexual Assault
on Campus: What Colleges Can Do."
The book states, "Regardless of the
relationship between them, if one person
uses force to coerce another into sub
mitting to sexual intercourse, the act is
defined as rape."
Nina says: "It's very difficult to trust
any of your friends once one of your
friends — someone everyone trusted —
turns on you. I didn't even know him
that well. He knew all of my friends,
though."
Senior Suzanna Mak, founder and ad
ministrative director of Heightened Ed
ucation on Acquaintance Rape, says,"I
can't stress enough, it's probably going
to be someone on your floor, someone
you meet at a party, someone you go
on a date with.
"I know that's where it happens, and
unfortunately the survivors know that.
It's going to be someone you know," she
says.
Nina says many people doubted that
she was raped because she and the male
student were drunk at the time.
But junior Suzanne O'Brien, a mem
ber of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, says, "People don't know
that if a woman is drunk (when she is
raped), that is assault, that is rape be
cause she did not consent."
Alcohol "impairs a person's ability to
say no and it makes a person raping
you less responsive to your needs," she

explains. "Because of alcohol,
many victims are unable to
protest or fend someone off."
"People don't understand that
having sex with a girlfriend when
she doesn't want to is rape. And
I would guess that only one in
100 knows that it's rape if a
woman is drunk," O'Brien adds.
"Somewhere people don't make
the distinction that unwanted,
forced sex is rape," Mak says.
Deciding to report
When Nina realized she may
have been raped by another stu
dent, she was "in total shock and
very frightened," she says."I had
no idea what else might have hap
pened that night."
So Nina told a friend and her
roommate. When she repeated the
story a third time, this time to a
close male friend, he told her that
she had been raped.
"I told him, 'So what, I don't
know what to do.' " Neither she
nor her friends knew what to do
or who to call.
When they called her residence
dean, he was very supportive and
suggested she report it to Judicial
Affairs. "I was scared about what
was going to happen," Nina re
members. "I was afraid [the al
leged rapist] and his friends were
going to come and hunt me
down."
Despite her fears, Nina wanted
action taken against the alleged
rapist.
"I wanted some form ofjustice,"
she says."I thought it was so
unfair that I couldn't walk around
on campus or that I couldn't go
to campus parties and he could."
More than these personal
feelings, Nina says she was afraid
for other female students. "I
wanted to make sure this didn't
happen to anyone else," she says.
In describing her decision to
report the incident to Judicial Af
fairs, she says, "You feel so help
less, but you feel you have an
obligation to help every woman
who will have to report this."
Nina believed the male student
violated the Fundamental Stand
ard and should take responsibility
for his actions. "This goes not
only against the Fundamental
Standard, but it is also morally
wrong," she says.
The Monday following the rape,
Nina met with Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole for the first time.
According to Nina, Cole said she
did not know what to do in this
case because she did not have a
formal definition of rape.
Cole, who files all formal disci
plinary charges against students,
says there is no formal definition
of sexual assault in the "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," the University's guidelines
for applying the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
These guidelines include exam
ples of past cases of behavior code
violations, a policy on campus dis
ruption, a prohibition of the pos
session of "dangerous weapons"
and a list of possible penalties for
violations.
The guidelines do not mention
sexual assault. This does not
mean, however, that sexual as
sault does not violate the Funda
mental Standard; rather, it means
that there is no precedent for such
cases.
Cole said she could not com
ment on Nina's case because Nina
has filed a formal grievance
against Cole, and officials from
the Office of Student Affairs are
currently investigating whether
Cole handled the case properly.

However, Cole wrote a letter
published in the Jan. 19 Daily in
response to an editorial. In the
letter, she wrote about Nina's
case: "The evidence .. . was in
complete because of an alcohol
induced memory lapse by the
alleged victim. There was an ap
parently complete account (from
the male student), one partial ac
count (from the female student),
no witnesses and no additional
evidence."
Case not opened
The day after Nina went to Jud
icial Affairs, Cole called the al
leged assailant into her office for
an interview.
During this time, Nina was de-

Whether or not a woman has been raped
according to the legal definition, she should
be treated with sensitivity and as if she has
been raped, says junior Suzanne O'Brien, a
member of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault. If a woman feels she's been
raped, then for her, she's been raped.'

pressed and afraid. "I would eat
alone in my room because I didn't
want to see people, to eat dinner
and pretend to be happy. It's not
something you can explain why
you're bummed," Nina recalls.
She contacted the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA Rape Crisis Center for
counseling and advice.
On Friday, a week after the al
leged rape, Cole called Nina into
her office and told her the case
was closed due to a lack of
evidence.
According to Nina, Cole told her
that she was not raped.
Nina says that, at the meeting,
Cole told her that the male stu
dent was not a rapist but a "very
nice young man." According to
Nina, Cole then told her to tell
all of her friends that she had not
been raped. Cole said Nina owed
this to the man because he felt
betrayed.
"I felt as if she was trying to
make me see his position, as if
what he felt was much more im
portant than what I felt," Nina
recalls.
Cole then told Nina to meet
with the male student on Monday
"to work things out together,"
Nina recalls.
Nina felt intimidated into set
ting up the meeting with the male

student. "This
J was an author
ity, a Univers
ity official, tel
jZ ling me I wasn't
raped," she says.
1 In a Sept. 26
112 letter obtained by
~ The Daily, Cole told
Nina, "I do not accept

as accurate your ac
count of what I said to
you last May — though
I am sure that it reflects

V what you remember hear
) ing."
L Nina says the night after
* meeting with Cole, three
days before the meeting with
the alleged rapist, "was the
worst night of my life. I felt
so humiliated. I sat there

counting reasons to live,"
says Nina, holding back tears.
"It was the loneliest night of

my life."
Nina felt that the University
was telling her she was wrong.
"It feels like this big force was
against me," she says. She cried
that whole night.
Before the meeting, however,
Nina realized she could not come
face to face with her alleged rap
ist. She canceled the appointment
and informed Cole that she would
not meet the male student.
Infrequent reporting
Nina was the second person to
report an alleged case of rape be
tween students to Cole, who is
serving her eighth year as the
judicial affairs officer. Cole came
to Stanford in 1977 as a director
of research in Student Affairs.
According to Mak, the two re
ported cases are a mere fraction
of the acquaintance rapes that oc
cur on campus. Through her ad
vising of students who have been

raped, Mak says,"I know the
number of acquaintance rapes
this quarter is quite large."
Mak says she receives many
anonymous phone calls from rape
victims, most saying they do not
want to report it to the University.
According to the FBI, a rape is
reported about once every six
minutes in the United States.
About half of all reported rapes
are acquaintance rapes, according
to the Santa Monica Rape Crisis
Center.
According to last spring's Rape
Education Project survey, 29 per
cent of female undergraduates at
Stanford and 10 percent of the
male undergraduates have been
coerced or forced into sexual ac
tivity against their will. Of those,
98 percent said they knew their
assailant.
However, Judicial Affairs rarely
hears about these incidents.
"There is knowledge of it out
there. People are discussing inci
dents, but those discussions stop
short of the victim seeking an in
vestigation," Cole says.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons says he was shocked by the
results of the survey. "That said
to me, boy, I'm out-of-touch," he
says. "Behavior that's going on
and what I understand (to be hap

pening) are out-of-sync."
He adds that he is familiar with
very few recent acquaintance rape
cases. "Why people don't report
(to the University) is a mystery
to me."
Cole also says she does not
know why the numbers of for
mally reported rapes are so low.
Mak, however, believes "the
lack of reported rapes is shouting
that there is something wrong"
with the University's handling of
the issue.
According to O'Brien, "If there
were any other crime happening
to that extent, we would be
dealing with it."
Unfairly judged?
Nina's foremost objection to the
process of reporting rape to the
University is the treatment she
feels she received in reporting the
incident. She believes the Univer
sity "judged" her unfairly in the
situation.
Cole explains that her position
as Judicial Affairs officer requires
her to judge the evidence.
"If the first person someone
turns to with an account of ac
quaintance rape is a person
charged with evaluating evidence,
it could be the case that the stu
dent comes away with a sense of
having been evaluated," she says.
"To the extent that that's a
problem and the student feels
poorly supported, I guess it's a
criticism of me, but what I think
needs to be done is to have that
student talk to someone whose
role is different first, where what
you really need is someone hug
ging you and listening to you and
not asking detailed questions and
looking for evidence.
"But [evaluating evidence is]
my job. It's not surprising that a
student that talks to me about
alleged misconduct of another stu
dent is going to feel that they are
being scrutinized," Cole adds.
Cole explains that it is very dif
ficult for the person evaluating
both sides of the situation to
remain both unbiased and provide
counseling.
But Nina says she did not object
to the scrutiny. Instead, she feels
that Cole's conclusion that she
was not raped was premature and
inappropriately delivered.
Cole's comments "minimized
what to me was, and still is, a
very terrifying experience and ex
onerated the male student's ac
tions," Nina says.
Nina believes the process she
went through exacerbated her
feelings of guilt about the inci
dent. "I felt as if I were the one
who had committed a great
wrong."
Mak says: "For a survivor to
deal with someone who is not em
pathetic or sensitive, well, that
could throw her off. She could be

hurt for years."
According to O'Brien, "It
makes a big difference in
how one recovers if one
can feel a sense of just- *
ice" that the case was

handled fairly.
Whether or not a wo
man has been raped ac
cording to the legal de
finition, she should be
treated with sensitivity
and as if she has been
raped, O'Brien says. "If

a woman feels she's
been raped, then for
her, she's been raped.'
The University has
resources to deal i
with the trauma of J
rape. Besides coun- £
seling resources at *
Residential Affairs Mt

and Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell Student Health
Center, there is an on-campus
group of trained Stanford staff
and students to help survivors of
sexual assault. Christine Griffith,
director of the Stanford Rape Re
sponse Group, says the group
hopes to be an advocate for the
victim immediately after the as
sault and later in the process of
recovering from the incident.
"We try to make the survivor
aware of the range of options
there are" within the University
and outside, she says. Counselors
would let the victim know that
reporting the incident to Judicial
Affairs would be one of the avail
able options. "You need to em
power [the victims! as much as
possible, and a good way is to let
them make the decisions."
Despite the group's efforts to
publicize its services, few students
have used its resources.
Nina suggests that all Univer
sity officials dealing with people
who have survived rape should
have formal training similar to
training for members of Griffith's
group. The Mid-Peninsula YWCA,
for example, offers sensitivity
training to the public.
Cole says she does not have a
problem with training, adding
that all people dealing with "dicey
issues" could use such education.
The right place to go?
But Cole says that "as an im
mediate response to a victim's
need for help, the judicial process
is not appropriate." Instead, "the
emergency counselors can lead to
. . . and set groundwork to eval

uate whether the judicial process
is appropriate" for the particular
case.
Lyons also questions whether
all acquaintance rapes should be
reported through Judicial Affairs.
"There is a problem because the
initial need to report may not be
a need to report or redress the
issue judicially but to get advice,"
Lyons says.
He said that in working with
students he has seen a wide range
of reactions, from"I just need to
talk about it with someone" to
"By God, I was sexually assaulted
and I want that person punished."
These are two different questions,
and they need to be addressed
differently, Lyons explains.
Mak says there are many prob
lems with the current set-up of
Judicial Affairs and the way it is
used.
Cole explains that prosecution
is only one of many possible re
sponses to acquaintance rape.
"Prosecutions will follow from
complaints and compelling
evidence. The basic solution to the
problem of sexual assault, how
ever, will not be found through
University or external judicial ac
tions," she says.
University ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan suggests that victims
report sexual assault to the police
before reporting it to Judicial Af
fairs. "That's something that
comes later, and only if it's be
tween students," and only if the
women have accepted that they
have been raped, she says."It
would be wrong to report it first
to [Judicial Affairsl."
Lyons explains: "The area of
date rape is three to four years
old" as a prominent public issue.
Cases of acquaintance rape may
test the judicial system "in ways
it may not be geared to respond
in because what constitutes date
rape may not be clear."
In cases of acquaintance rape
Lyons says, "We are probably
dealing with the fact that a person
genuinely feels used, hurt, abused.
But does that in and of itself con
stitute date rape?"
Lyons adds: "I suspect those are
emotions we are dealing with. The
sense of betrayal is the worst of
all human conditions to go
through. The victim can identify
who is responsible, but that
doesn't necessarily make it a
crime. It doesn't make it right
either."
Lyons says that in a case of
date rape, "there are a whole lot
of emotions that have to do with
betrayal. But I'm not sure the
judicial process is the place to deal
with it."

and the victim's lack of rights.


When "Nina" saw a male acquaintance
at a fraternity party one Friday night
last spring, she began talking with him.
He asked her to go to another fraternity
party, where they drank and danced.
When Nina woke up later that night,
she could feel the semen running down
her leg. But she was drunk and couldn't
believe what was happening.
When she realized she was naked in
bed with a man on top of her, she was
too drunk and confused to respond to
the male, a student she had met a few
times before.
"I remember gasping a little in pain,"
Nina recalls, but she then passed out
again.
Nina remembers little else from that
night.
She does, however, remember the days
following the incident very clearly.
The next day, she woke up around 8
a.m., got dressed and walked home to
her dormitory across campus.
Later that day, Nina started to realize
that she may have been raped — not
by a strange man, but by a student she
knew. "It started to hit me and really
bother me," Nina says, her voice
shaking. "I started to cry."
"By mid-afternoon, I was sure that I
was raped," says Nina, now a junior.

Nina's case was reported to the Uni
versity's Judicial Affairs Office, but the
office never filed charges against the
alleged assailant. The office's handling
of the case raises a crucial question: Is
Judicial Affairs set up in a way that
allows it to competently handle cases of
sexual assault?
People who have survived rapes, some
administrators, and others who work
with the issue say the answer is no.
And if the University intends to punish
rapists, they say, it must adopt a more
sensitive and effective process.
According to the California Penal
Code, rape is defined as forced sexual
intercourse that is perpetrated against
the will of the victim. Title 9, section
261 says rape has occurred "where a
person is prevented from resisting by
any intoxication or anesthetic substance,
or any controlled substance, adminis

tered by or with the privity of the ac
cused."
Acquaintance rape, the most prevalent
form of rape on college campuses, may
be perpetrated by a date or boyfriend
of the victim, or by someone the victim
knows only casually — from a dormitory,
a class, or through mutual friends, ac
cording to the Santa Monica Rape Treat
ment Center's handbook "Sexual Assault
on Campus: What Colleges Can Do."
The book states, "Regardless of the
relationship between them, if one person
uses force to coerce another into sub
mitting to sexual intercourse, the act is
defined as rape."
Nina says: "It's very difficult to trust
any of your friends once one of your
friends — someone everyone trusted —
turns on you. I didn't even know him
that well. He knew all of my friends,
though."
Senior Suzanna Mak, founder and ad
ministrative director of Heightened Ed
ucation on Acquaintance Rape, says,"I
can't stress enough, it's probably going
to be someone on your floor, someone
you meet at a party, someone you go
on a date with.
"I know that's where it happens, and
unfortunately the survivors know that.
It's going to be someone you know," she
says.
Nina says many people doubted that
she was raped because she and the male
student were drunk at the time.
But junior Suzanne O'Brien, a mem
ber of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, says, "People don't know
that if a woman is drunk (when she is
raped), that is assault, that is rape be
cause she did not consent."
Alcohol "impairs a person's ability to
say no and it makes a person raping
you less responsive to your needs," she

explains. "Because of alcohol,
many victims are unable to
protest or fend someone off."
"People don't understand that
having sex with a girlfriend when
she doesn't want to is rape. And
I would guess that only one in
100 knows that it's rape if a
woman is drunk," O'Brien adds.
"Somewhere people don't make
the distinction that unwanted,
forced sex is rape," Mak says.
Deciding to report
When Nina realized she may
have been raped by another stu
dent, she was "in total shock and
very frightened," she says."I had
no idea what else might have hap
pened that night."
So Nina told a friend and her
roommate. When she repeated the
story a third time, this time to a
close male friend, he told her that
she had been raped.
"I told him, 'So what, I don't
know what to do.' " Neither she
nor her friends knew what to do
or who to call.
When they called her residence
dean, he was very supportive and
suggested she report it to Judicial
Affairs. "I was scared about what
was going to happen," Nina re
members. "I was afraid [the al
leged rapist] and his friends were
going to come and hunt me
down."
Despite her fears, Nina wanted
action taken against the alleged
rapist.
"I wanted some form ofjustice,"
she says."I thought it was so
unfair that I couldn't walk around
on campus or that I couldn't go
to campus parties and he could."
More than these personal
feelings, Nina says she was afraid
for other female students. "I
wanted to make sure this didn't
happen to anyone else," she says.
In describing her decision to
report the incident to Judicial Af
fairs, she says, "You feel so help
less, but you feel you have an
obligation to help every woman
who will have to report this."
Nina believed the male student
violated the Fundamental Stand
ard and should take responsibility
for his actions. "This goes not
only against the Fundamental
Standard, but it is also morally
wrong," she says.
The Monday following the rape,
Nina met with Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole for the first time.
According to Nina, Cole said she
did not know what to do in this
case because she did not have a
formal definition of rape.
Cole, who files all formal disci
plinary charges against students,
says there is no formal definition
of sexual assault in the "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," the University's guidelines
for applying the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
These guidelines include exam
ples of past cases of behavior code
violations, a policy on campus dis
ruption, a prohibition of the pos
session of "dangerous weapons"
and a list of possible penalties for
violations.
The guidelines do not mention
sexual assault. This does not
mean, however, that sexual as
sault does not violate the Funda
mental Standard; rather, it means
that there is no precedent for such
cases.
Cole said she could not com
ment on Nina's case because Nina
has filed a formal grievance
against Cole, and officials from
the Office of Student Affairs are
currently investigating whether
Cole handled the case properly.

However, Cole wrote a letter
published in the Jan. 19 Daily in
response to an editorial. In the
letter, she wrote about Nina's
case: "The evidence .. . was in
complete because of an alcohol
induced memory lapse by the
alleged victim. There was an ap
parently complete account (from

Case not opened
The day after Nina went to Jud
icial Affairs, Cole called the al
leged assailant into her office for
an interview.
During this time, Nina was de-

pressed and afraid. "I would eat
alone in my room because I didn't
want to see people, to eat dinner
and pretend to be happy. It's not
something you can explain why
you're bummed," Nina recalls.
She contacted the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA Rape Crisis Center for
counseling and advice.
On Friday, a week after the al
leged rape, Cole called Nina into
her office and told her the case
was closed due to a lack of
evidence.
According to Nina, Cole told her
that she was not raped.
Nina says that, at the meeting,
Cole told her that the male stu
dent was not a rapist but a "very
nice young man." According to
Nina, Cole then told her to tell
all of her friends that she had not
been raped. Cole said Nina owed
this to the man because he felt
betrayed.
"I felt as if she was trying to
make me see his position, as if
what he felt was much more im
portant than what I felt," Nina
recalls.
Cole then told Nina to meet
with the male student on Monday
"to work things out together,"
Nina recalls.
Nina felt intimidated into set
ting up the meeting with the male

student. "This
J was an author
ity, a Univers
ity official, tel
jZ ling me I wasn't
raped," she says.
1 In a Sept. 26
112 letter obtained by
~ The Daily, Cole told
Nina, "I do not accept

as accurate your ac
count of what I said to
you last May — though
I am sure that it reflects

V what you remember hear
) ing."
L Nina says the night after
* meeting with Cole, three
days before the meeting with
the alleged rapist, "was the
worst night of my life. I felt
so humiliated. I sat there

counting reasons to live,"
says Nina, holding back tears.
"It was the loneliest night of

my life."
Nina felt that the University
was telling her she was wrong.
"It feels like this big force was
against me," she says. She cried
that whole night.
Before the meeting, however,
Nina realized she could not come
face to face with her alleged rap
ist. She canceled the appointment
and informed Cole that she would
not meet the male student.
Infrequent reporting
Nina was the second person to
report an alleged case of rape be
tween students to Cole, who is
serving her eighth year as the
judicial affairs officer. Cole came
to Stanford in 1977 as a director
of research in Student Affairs.
According to Mak, the two re
ported cases are a mere fraction
of the acquaintance rapes that oc
cur on campus. Through her ad
vising of students who have been

raped, Mak says,"I know the
number of acquaintance rapes
this quarter is quite large."
Mak says she receives many
anonymous phone calls from rape
victims, most saying they do not
want to report it to the University.
According to the FBI, a rape is
reported about once every six
minutes in the United States.
About half of all reported rapes
are acquaintance rapes, according
to the Santa Monica Rape Crisis
Center.
According to last spring's Rape
Education Project survey, 29 per
cent of female undergraduates at
Stanford and 10 percent of the
male undergraduates have been
coerced or forced into sexual ac
tivity against their will. Of those,
98 percent said they knew their
assailant.
However, Judicial Affairs rarely
hears about these incidents.
"There is knowledge of it out
there. People are discussing inci

Dean of Student Affairs James

results of the survey. "That said

says. "Behavior that's going on
and what I understand (to be hap

He adds that he is familiar with
very few recent acquaintance rape
cases. "Why people don't report

to me."
Cole also says she does not
know why the numbers of for
mally reported rapes are so low.
Mak, however, believes "the
lack of reported rapes is shouting
that there is something wrong"
with the University's handling of
the issue.
According to O'Brien, "If there
were any other crime happening
to that extent, we would be
dealing with it."
Unfairly judged?
Nina's foremost objection to the
process of reporting rape to the
University is the treatment she
feels she received in reporting the
incident. She believes the Univer
sity "judged" her unfairly in the
situation.
Cole explains that her position
as Judicial Affairs officer requires
her to judge the evidence.
"If the first person someone
turns to with an account of ac
quaintance rape is a person
charged with evaluating evidence,
it could be the case that the stu
dent comes away with a sense of
having been evaluated," she says.
"To the extent that that's a
problem and the student feels
poorly supported, I guess it's a
criticism of me, but what I think
needs to be done is to have that
student talk to someone whose
role is different first, where what
you really need is someone hug
ging you and listening to you and
not asking detailed questions and
looking for evidence.
"But [evaluating evidence is]
my job. It's not surprising that a
student that talks to me about
alleged misconduct of another stu
dent is going to feel that they are
being scrutinized," Cole adds.
Cole explains that it is very dif
ficult for the person evaluating
both sides of the situation to
remain both unbiased and provide
counseling.
But Nina says she did not object
to the scrutiny. Instead, she feels
that Cole's conclusion that she
was not raped was premature and
inappropriately delivered.
Cole's comments "minimized
what to me was, and still is, a
very terrifying experience and ex
onerated the male student's ac
tions," Nina says.
Nina believes the process she
went through exacerbated her
feelings of guilt about the inci
dent. "I felt as if I were the one
who had committed a great
wrong."
Mak says: "For a survivor to
deal with someone who is not em
pathetic or sensitive, well, that
could throw her off. She could be

hurt for years."
According to O'Brien, "It
makes a big difference in
how one recovers if one
can feel a sense of just- *
ice" that the case was

handled fairly.
Whether or not a wo
man has been raped ac
cording to the legal de
finition, she should be
treated with sensitivity
and as if she has been
raped, O'Brien says. "If

a woman feels she's
been raped, then for
her, she's been raped.'
The University has
resources to deal i
with the trauma of J
rape. Besides coun- £
seling resources at *
Residential Affairs Mt

and Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell Student Health
Center, there is an on-campus
group of trained Stanford staff
and students to help survivors of
sexual assault. Christine Griffith,
director of the Stanford Rape Re
sponse Group, says the group
hopes to be an advocate for the
victim immediately after the as
sault and later in the process of
recovering from the incident.
"We try to make the survivor
aware of the range of options
there are" within the University
and outside, she says. Counselors
would let the victim know that
reporting the incident to Judicial
Affairs would be one of the avail
able options. "You need to em
power [the victims! as much as
possible, and a good way is to let
them make the decisions."
Despite the group's efforts to
publicize its services, few students
have used its resources.
Nina suggests that all Univer
sity officials dealing with people
who have survived rape should
have formal training similar to
training for members of Griffith's
group. The Mid-Peninsula YWCA,
for example, offers sensitivity
training to the public.
Cole says she does not have a
problem with training, adding
that all people dealing with "dicey
issues" could use such education.
The right place to go?
But Cole says that "as an im
mediate response to a victim's
need for help, the judicial process
is not appropriate." Instead, "the
emergency counselors can lead to
. . . and set groundwork to eval

uate whether the judicial process
is appropriate" for the particular
case.
Lyons also questions whether
all acquaintance rapes should be
reported through Judicial Affairs.
"There is a problem because the
initial need to report may not be
a need to report or redress the
issue judicially but to get advice,"
Lyons says.
He said that in working with
students he has seen a wide range
of reactions, from"I just need to
talk about it with someone" to
"By God, I was sexually assaulted
and I want that person punished."
These are two different questions,
and they need to be addressed
differently, Lyons explains.
Mak says there are many prob
lems with the current set-up of
Judicial Affairs and the way it is
used.
Cole explains that prosecution
is only one of many possible re
sponses to acquaintance rape.
"Prosecutions will follow from
complaints and compelling
evidence. The basic solution to the
problem of sexual assault, how
ever, will not be found through
University or external judicial ac
tions," she says.
University ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan suggests that victims
report sexual assault to the police
before reporting it to Judicial Af
fairs. "That's something that
comes later, and only if it's be
tween students," and only if the
women have accepted that they
have been raped, she says."It
would be wrong to report it first
to [Judicial Affairsl."
Lyons explains: "The area of
date rape is three to four years
old" as a prominent public issue.
Cases of acquaintance rape may
test the judicial system "in ways
it may not be geared to respond
in because what constitutes date
rape may not be clear."
In cases of acquaintance rape
Lyons says, "We are probably
dealing with the fact that a person
genuinely feels used, hurt, abused.
But does that in and of itself con
stitute date rape?"
Lyons adds: "I suspect those are
emotions we are dealing with. The
sense of betrayal is the worst of
all human conditions to go
through. The victim can identify
who is responsible, but that
doesn't necessarily make it a
crime. It doesn't make it right
either."
Lyons says that in a case of
date rape, "there are a whole lot
of emotions that have to do with
betrayal. But I'm not sure the
judicial process is the place to deal
with it."

Tomorrow: Questions of evidence
and the victim's lack of rights.


When "Nina" saw a male acquaintance
at a fraternity party one Friday night
last spring, she began talking with him.
He asked her to go to another fraternity
party, where they drank and danced.
When Nina woke up later that night,
she could feel the semen running down
her leg. But she was drunk and couldn't
believe what was happening.
When she realized she was naked in
bed with a man on top of her, she was
too drunk and confused to respond to
the male, a student she had met a few
times before.
"I remember gasping a little in pain,"
Nina recalls, but she then passed out
again.
Nina remembers little else from that
night.
She does, however, remember the days
following the incident very clearly.
The next day, she woke up around 8
a.m., got dressed and walked home to
her dormitory across campus.
Later that day, Nina started to realize
that she may have been raped — not
by a strange man, but by a student she
knew. "It started to hit me and really
bother me," Nina says, her voice
shaking. "I started to cry."
"By mid-afternoon, I was sure that I
was raped," says Nina, now a junior.

Nina's case was reported to the Uni
versity's Judicial Affairs Office, but the
office never filed charges against the
alleged assailant. The office's handling
of the case raises a crucial question: Is
Judicial Affairs set up in a way that
allows it to competently handle cases of
sexual assault?
People who have survived rapes, some
administrators, and others who work
with the issue say the answer is no.
And if the University intends to punish
rapists, they say, it must adopt a more
sensitive and effective process.
According to the California Penal
Code, rape is defined as forced sexual
intercourse that is perpetrated against
the will of the victim. Title 9, section
261 says rape has occurred "where a
person is prevented from resisting by
any intoxication or anesthetic substance,
or any controlled substance, adminis

tered by or with the privity of the ac
cused."
Acquaintance rape, the most prevalent
form of rape on college campuses, may
be perpetrated by a date or boyfriend
of the victim, or by someone the victim
knows only casually — from a dormitory,
a class, or through mutual friends, ac
cording to the Santa Monica Rape Treat
ment Center's handbook "Sexual Assault
on Campus: What Colleges Can Do."
The book states, "Regardless of the
relationship between them, if one person
uses force to coerce another into sub
mitting to sexual intercourse, the act is
defined as rape."
Nina says: "It's very difficult to trust
any of your friends once one of your
friends — someone everyone trusted —
turns on you. I didn't even know him
that well. He knew all of my friends,
though."
Senior Suzanna Mak, founder and ad
ministrative director of Heightened Ed
ucation on Acquaintance Rape, says,"I
can't stress enough, it's probably going
to be someone on your floor, someone
you meet at a party, someone you go
on a date with.
"I know that's where it happens, and
unfortunately the survivors know that.
It's going to be someone you know," she
says.
Nina says many people doubted that
she was raped because she and the male
student were drunk at the time.
But junior Suzanne O'Brien, a mem
ber of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, says, "People don't know
that if a woman is drunk (when she is
raped), that is assault, that is rape be
cause she did not consent."
Alcohol "impairs a person's ability to
say no and it makes a person raping
you less responsive to your needs," she

explains. "Because of alcohol,
many victims are unable to
protest or fend someone off."
"People don't understand that
having sex with a girlfriend when
she doesn't want to is rape. And
I would guess that only one in
100 knows that it's rape if a
woman is drunk," O'Brien adds.
"Somewhere people don't make
the distinction that unwanted,
forced sex is rape," Mak says.
Deciding to report
When Nina realized she may
have been raped by another stu
dent, she was "in total shock and
very frightened," she says."I had
no idea what else might have hap
pened that night."
So Nina told a friend and her
roommate. When she repeated the
story a third time, this time to a
close male friend, he told her that
she had been raped.
"I told him, 'So what, I don't
know what to do.' " Neither she
nor her friends knew what to do
or who to call.
When they called her residence
dean, he was very supportive and
suggested she report it to Judicial
Affairs. "I was scared about what
was going to happen," Nina re
members. "I was afraid [the al
leged rapist] and his friends were
going to come and hunt me
down."
Despite her fears, Nina wanted
action taken against the alleged
rapist.
"I wanted some form ofjustice,"
she says."I thought it was so
unfair that I couldn't walk around
on campus or that I couldn't go
to campus parties and he could."
More than these personal
feelings, Nina says she was afraid
for other female students. "I
wanted to make sure this didn't
happen to anyone else," she says.
In describing her decision to
report the incident to Judicial Af
fairs, she says, "You feel so help
less, but you feel you have an
obligation to help every woman
who will have to report this."
Nina believed the male student
violated the Fundamental Stand
ard and should take responsibility
for his actions. "This goes not
only against the Fundamental
Standard, but it is also morally
wrong," she says.
The Monday following the rape,
Nina met with Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole for the first time.
According to Nina, Cole said she
did not know what to do in this
case because she did not have a
formal definition of rape.
Cole, who files all formal disci
plinary charges against students,
says there is no formal definition
of sexual assault in the "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," the University's guidelines
for applying the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
These guidelines include exam
ples of past cases of behavior code
violations, a policy on campus dis
ruption, a prohibition of the pos
session of "dangerous weapons"
and a list of possible penalties for
violations.
The guidelines do not mention
sexual assault. This does not
mean, however, that sexual as
sault does not violate the Funda
mental Standard; rather, it means
that there is no precedent for such
cases.
Cole said she could not com
ment on Nina's case because Nina
has filed a formal grievance
against Cole, and officials from
the Office of Student Affairs are
currently investigating whether
Cole handled the case properly.

However, Cole wrote a letter
published in the Jan. 19 Daily in
response to an editorial. In the
letter, she wrote about Nina's
case: "The evidence .. . was in
complete because of an alcohol
induced memory lapse by the
alleged victim. There was an ap
parently complete account (from
the male student), one partial ac
count (from the female student),
no witnesses and no additional
evidence."
Case not opened
The day after Nina went to Jud
icial Affairs, Cole called the al
leged assailant into her office for
an interview.
During this time, Nina was de-

Whether or not a woman has been raped
according to the legal definition, she should
be treated with sensitivity and as if she has
been raped, says junior Suzanne O'Brien, a
member of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault. If a woman feels she's been
raped, then for her, she's been raped.'

pressed and afraid. "I would eat
alone in my room because I didn't
want to see people, to eat dinner
and pretend to be happy. It's not
something you can explain why
you're bummed," Nina recalls.
She contacted the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA Rape Crisis Center for
counseling and advice.
On Friday, a week after the al
leged rape, Cole called Nina into
her office and told her the case
was closed due to a lack of
evidence.
According to Nina, Cole told her
that she was not raped.
Nina says that, at the meeting,
Cole told her that the male stu
dent was not a rapist but a "very
nice young man." According to
Nina, Cole then told her to tell
all of her friends that she had not
been raped. Cole said Nina owed
this to the man because he felt
betrayed.
"I felt as if she was trying to
make me see his position, as if
what he felt was much more im
portant than what I felt," Nina
recalls.
Cole then told Nina to meet
with the male student on Monday
"to work things out together,"
Nina recalls.
Nina felt intimidated into set
ting up the meeting with the male

student. "This
J was an author
ity, a Univers
ity official, tel
jZ ling me I wasn't
raped," she says.
1 In a Sept. 26
112 letter obtained by
~ The Daily, Cole told
Nina, "I do not accept

as accurate your ac
count of what I said to
you last May — though
I am sure that it reflects

V what you remember hear
) ing."
L Nina says the night after
* meeting with Cole, three
days before the meeting with
the alleged rapist, "was the
worst night of my life. I felt
so humiliated. I sat there

counting reasons to live,"
says Nina, holding back tears.
"It was the loneliest night of

my life."
Nina felt that the University
was telling her she was wrong.
"It feels like this big force was
against me," she says. She cried
that whole night.
Before the meeting, however,
Nina realized she could not come
face to face with her alleged rap
ist. She canceled the appointment
and informed Cole that she would
not meet the male student.
Infrequent reporting
Nina was the second person to
report an alleged case of rape be
tween students to Cole, who is
serving her eighth year as the
judicial affairs officer. Cole came
to Stanford in 1977 as a director
of research in Student Affairs.
According to Mak, the two re
ported cases are a mere fraction
of the acquaintance rapes that oc
cur on campus. Through her ad
vising of students who have been

raped, Mak says,"I know the
number of acquaintance rapes
this quarter is quite large."
Mak says she receives many
anonymous phone calls from rape
victims, most saying they do not
want to report it to the University.
According to the FBI, a rape is
reported about once every six
minutes in the United States.
About half of all reported rapes
are acquaintance rapes, according
to the Santa Monica Rape Crisis
Center.
According to last spring's Rape
Education Project survey, 29 per
cent of female undergraduates at
Stanford and 10 percent of the
male undergraduates have been
coerced or forced into sexual ac
tivity against their will. Of those,
98 percent said they knew their
assailant.
However, Judicial Affairs rarely
hears about these incidents.
"There is knowledge of it out
there. People are discussing inci
dents, but those discussions stop
short of the victim seeking an in
vestigation," Cole says.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons says he was shocked by the
results of the survey. "That said
to me, boy, I'm out-of-touch," he
says. "Behavior that's going on
and what I understand (to be hap

pening) are out-of-sync."
He adds that he is familiar with
very few recent acquaintance rape
cases. "Why people don't report
(to the University) is a mystery
to me."
Cole also says she does not
know why the numbers of for
mally reported rapes are so low.
Mak, however, believes "the
lack of reported rapes is shouting
that there is something wrong"
with the University's handling of
the issue.
According to O'Brien, "If there
were any other crime happening
to that extent, we would be
dealing with it."
Unfairly judged?
Nina's foremost objection to the
process of reporting rape to the
University is the treatment she
feels she received in reporting the
incident. She believes the Univer
sity "judged" her unfairly in the
situation.
Cole explains that her position
as Judicial Affairs officer requires
her to judge the evidence.
"If the first person someone
turns to with an account of ac
quaintance rape is a person
charged with evaluating evidence,
it could be the case that the stu
dent comes away with a sense of
having been evaluated," she says.
"To the extent that that's a
problem and the student feels
poorly supported, I guess it's a
criticism of me, but what I think
needs to be done is to have that
student talk to someone whose
role is different first, where what
you really need is someone hug
ging you and listening to you and
not asking detailed questions and
looking for evidence.
"But [evaluating evidence is]
my job. It's not surprising that a
student that talks to me about
alleged misconduct of another stu
dent is going to feel that they are
being scrutinized," Cole adds.
Cole explains that it is very dif
ficult for the person evaluating
both sides of the situation to
remain both unbiased and provide
counseling.
But Nina says she did not object
to the scrutiny. Instead, she feels
that Cole's conclusion that she
was not raped was premature and
inappropriately delivered.
Cole's comments "minimized
what to me was, and still is, a
very terrifying experience and ex
onerated the male student's ac
tions," Nina says.
Nina believes the process she
went through exacerbated her
feelings of guilt about the inci
dent. "I felt as if I were the one
who had committed a great
wrong."
Mak says: "For a survivor to
deal with someone who is not em
pathetic or sensitive, well, that
could throw her off. She could be

hurt for years."
According to O'Brien, "It
makes a big difference in
how one recovers if one
can feel a sense of just- *
ice" that the case was

handled fairly.
Whether or not a wo
man has been raped ac
cording to the legal de
finition, she should be
treated with sensitivity
and as if she has been
raped, O'Brien says. "If

a woman feels she's
been raped, then for
her, she's been raped.'
The University has
resources to deal i
with the trauma of J
rape. Besides coun- £
seling resources at *
Residential Affairs Mt

and Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell Student Health
Center, there is an on-campus
group of trained Stanford staff
and students to help survivors of
sexual assault. Christine Griffith,
director of the Stanford Rape Re
sponse Group, says the group
hopes to be an advocate for the
victim immediately after the as
sault and later in the process of
recovering from the incident.
"We try to make the survivor
aware of the range of options
there are" within the University
and outside, she says. Counselors
would let the victim know that
reporting the incident to Judicial
Affairs would be one of the avail
able options. "You need to em
power [the victims! as much as
possible, and a good way is to let
them make the decisions."
Despite the group's efforts to
publicize its services, few students
have used its resources.
Nina suggests that all Univer
sity officials dealing with people
who have survived rape should
have formal training similar to
training for members of Griffith's
group. The Mid-Peninsula YWCA,
for example, offers sensitivity
training to the public.
Cole says she does not have a
problem with training, adding
that all people dealing with "dicey
issues" could use such education.
The right place to go?
But Cole says that "as an im
mediate response to a victim's
need for help, the judicial process
is not appropriate." Instead, "the
emergency counselors can lead to
. . . and set groundwork to eval

uate whether the judicial process
is appropriate" for the particular
case.
Lyons also questions whether
all acquaintance rapes should be
reported through Judicial Affairs.
"There is a problem because the
initial need to report may not be
a need to report or redress the
issue judicially but to get advice,"
Lyons says.
He said that in working with
students he has seen a wide range
of reactions, from"I just need to
talk about it with someone" to
"By God, I was sexually assaulted
and I want that person punished."
These are two different questions,
and they need to be addressed
differently, Lyons explains.
Mak says there are many prob
lems with the current set-up of
Judicial Affairs and the way it is
used.
Cole explains that prosecution
is only one of many possible re
sponses to acquaintance rape.
"Prosecutions will follow from
complaints and compelling
evidence. The basic solution to the
problem of sexual assault, how
ever, will not be found through
University or external judicial ac
tions," she says.
University ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan suggests that victims
report sexual assault to the police
before reporting it to Judicial Af
fairs. "That's something that
comes later, and only if it's be
tween students," and only if the
women have accepted that they
have been raped, she says."It
would be wrong to report it first
to [Judicial Affairsl."
Lyons explains: "The area of
date rape is three to four years
old" as a prominent public issue.
Cases of acquaintance rape may
test the judicial system "in ways
it may not be geared to respond
in because what constitutes date
rape may not be clear."
In cases of acquaintance rape
Lyons says, "We are probably
dealing with the fact that a person
genuinely feels used, hurt, abused.
But does that in and of itself con
stitute date rape?"
Lyons adds: "I suspect those are
emotions we are dealing with. The
sense of betrayal is the worst of
all human conditions to go
through. The victim can identify
who is responsible, but that
doesn't necessarily make it a
crime. It doesn't make it right
either."
Lyons says that in a case of
date rape, "there are a whole lot
of emotions that have to do with
betrayal. But I'm not sure the
judicial process is the place to deal
with it."

When "Nina" saw a male acquaintance
at a fraternity party one Friday night
last spring, she began talking with him.
He asked her to go to another fraternity
party, where they drank and danced.
When Nina woke up later that night,
she could feel the semen running down
her leg. But she was drunk and couldn't
believe what was happening.
When she realized she was naked in
bed with a man on top of her, she was
too drunk and confused to respond to
the male, a student she had met a few
times before.
"I remember gasping a little in pain,"
Nina recalls, but she then passed out

Nina remembers little else from that
night.
She does, however, remember the days
following the incident very clearly.
The next day, she woke up around 8
a.m., got dressed and walked home to
her dormitory across campus.
Later that day, Nina started to realize
that she may have been raped — not
by a strange man, but by a student she
knew. "It started to hit me and really
bother me," Nina says, her voice
shaking. "I started to cry."
"By mid-afternoon, I was sure that I
was raped," says Nina, now a junior.

Nina's case was reported to the Uni
versity's Judicial Affairs Office, but the
office never filed charges against the
alleged assailant. The office's handling
of the case raises a crucial question: Is
Judicial Affairs set up in a way that
allows it to competently handle cases of
sexual assault?
People who have survived rapes, some
administrators, and others who work
with the issue say the answer is no.
And if the University intends to punish
rapists, they say, it must adopt a more
sensitive and effective process.
According to the California Penal
Code, rape is defined as forced sexual
intercourse that is perpetrated against
the will of the victim. Title 9, section
261 says rape has occurred "where a
person is prevented from resisting by
any intoxication or anesthetic substance,
or any controlled substance, adminis

tered by or with the privity of the ac
cused."
Acquaintance rape, the most prevalent
form of rape on college campuses, may
be perpetrated by a date or boyfriend
of the victim, or by someone the victim
knows only casually — from a dormitory,
a class, or through mutual friends, ac
cording to the Santa Monica Rape Treat
ment Center's handbook "Sexual Assault
on Campus: What Colleges Can Do."
The book states, "Regardless of the
relationship between them, if one person
uses force to coerce another into sub
mitting to sexual intercourse, the act is
defined as rape."
Nina says: "It's very difficult to trust
any of your friends once one of your
friends — someone everyone trusted —
turns on you. I didn't even know him
that well. He knew all of my friends,
though."
Senior Suzanna Mak, founder and ad
ministrative director of Heightened Ed
ucation on Acquaintance Rape, says,"I
can't stress enough, it's probably going
to be someone on your floor, someone
you meet at a party, someone you go
on a date with.
"I know that's where it happens, and
unfortunately the survivors know that.
It's going to be someone you know," she
says.
Nina says many people doubted that
she was raped because she and the male
student were drunk at the time.
But junior Suzanne O'Brien, a mem
ber of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, says, "People don't know
that if a woman is drunk (when she is
raped), that is assault, that is rape be
cause she did not consent."
Alcohol "impairs a person's ability to
say no and it makes a person raping
you less responsive to your needs," she

explains. "Because of alcohol,
many victims are unable to
protest or fend someone off."
"People don't understand that
having sex with a girlfriend when
she doesn't want to is rape. And
I would guess that only one in
100 knows that it's rape if a
woman is drunk," O'Brien adds.
"Somewhere people don't make
the distinction that unwanted,
forced sex is rape," Mak says.
Deciding to report
When Nina realized she may
have been raped by another stu
dent, she was "in total shock and
very frightened," she says."I had
no idea what else might have hap
pened that night."
So Nina told a friend and her
roommate. When she repeated the
story a third time, this time to a
close male friend, he told her that
she had been raped.
"I told him, 'So what, I don't
know what to do.' " Neither she
nor her friends knew what to do
or who to call.
When they called her residence
dean, he was very supportive and
suggested she report it to Judicial
Affairs. "I was scared about what
was going to happen," Nina re
members. "I was afraid [the al
leged rapist] and his friends were
going to come and hunt me
down."
Despite her fears, Nina wanted
action taken against the alleged
rapist.
"I wanted some form ofjustice,"
she says."I thought it was so
unfair that I couldn't walk around
on campus or that I couldn't go
to campus parties and he could."
More than these personal
feelings, Nina says she was afraid
for other female students. "I
wanted to make sure this didn't
happen to anyone else," she says.
In describing her decision to
report the incident to Judicial Af
fairs, she says, "You feel so help
less, but you feel you have an
obligation to help every woman
who will have to report this."
Nina believed the male student
violated the Fundamental Stand
ard and should take responsibility
for his actions. "This goes not
only against the Fundamental
Standard, but it is also morally
wrong," she says.
The Monday following the rape,
Nina met with Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole for the first time.
According to Nina, Cole said she
did not know what to do in this
case because she did not have a
formal definition of rape.
Cole, who files all formal disci
plinary charges against students,
says there is no formal definition
of sexual assault in the "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," the University's guidelines
for applying the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
These guidelines include exam
ples of past cases of behavior code
violations, a policy on campus dis
ruption, a prohibition of the pos
session of "dangerous weapons"
and a list of possible penalties for
violations.
The guidelines do not mention
sexual assault. This does not
mean, however, that sexual as
sault does not violate the Funda
mental Standard; rather, it means
that there is no precedent for such
cases.
Cole said she could not com
ment on Nina's case because Nina
has filed a formal grievance
against Cole, and officials from
the Office of Student Affairs are
currently investigating whether
Cole handled the case properly.

However, Cole wrote a letter
published in the Jan. 19 Daily in
response to an editorial. In the
letter, she wrote about Nina's
case: "The evidence .. . was in
complete because of an alcohol
induced memory lapse by the
alleged victim. There was an ap
parently complete account (from
the male student), one partial ac
count (from the female student),
no witnesses and no additional
evidence."
Case not opened
The day after Nina went to Jud
icial Affairs, Cole called the al
leged assailant into her office for
an interview.
During this time, Nina was de-

Whether or not a woman has been raped
according to the legal definition, she should
be treated with sensitivity and as if she has
been raped, says junior Suzanne O'Brien, a
member of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault. If a woman feels she's been
raped, then for her, she's been raped.'

pressed and afraid. "I would eat
alone in my room because I didn't
want to see people, to eat dinner
and pretend to be happy. It's not
something you can explain why
you're bummed," Nina recalls.
She contacted the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA Rape Crisis Center for
counseling and advice.
On Friday, a week after the al
leged rape, Cole called Nina into
her office and told her the case
was closed due to a lack of
evidence.
According to Nina, Cole told her
that she was not raped.
Nina says that, at the meeting,
Cole told her that the male stu
dent was not a rapist but a "very
nice young man." According to
Nina, Cole then told her to tell
all of her friends that she had not
been raped. Cole said Nina owed
this to the man because he felt
betrayed.
"I felt as if she was trying to
make me see his position, as if
what he felt was much more im
portant than what I felt," Nina
recalls.
Cole then told Nina to meet
with the male student on Monday
"to work things out together,"
Nina recalls.
Nina felt intimidated into set
ting up the meeting with the male

student. "This
J was an author
ity, a Univers
ity official, tel
jZ ling me I wasn't
raped," she says.
1 In a Sept. 26
112 letter obtained by
~ The Daily, Cole told
Nina, "I do not accept

as accurate your ac
count of what I said to
you last May — though
I am sure that it reflects

V what you remember hear
) ing."
L Nina says the night after
* meeting with Cole, three
days before the meeting with
the alleged rapist, "was the
worst night of my life. I felt
so humiliated. I sat there

counting reasons to live,"
says Nina, holding back tears.
"It was the loneliest night of

my life."
Nina felt that the University
was telling her she was wrong.
"It feels like this big force was
against me," she says. She cried
that whole night.
Before the meeting, however,
Nina realized she could not come
face to face with her alleged rap
ist. She canceled the appointment
and informed Cole that she would
not meet the male student.
Infrequent reporting
Nina was the second person to
report an alleged case of rape be
tween students to Cole, who is
serving her eighth year as the
judicial affairs officer. Cole came
to Stanford in 1977 as a director
of research in Student Affairs.
According to Mak, the two re
ported cases are a mere fraction
of the acquaintance rapes that oc
cur on campus. Through her ad
vising of students who have been

raped, Mak says,"I know the
number of acquaintance rapes
this quarter is quite large."
Mak says she receives many
anonymous phone calls from rape
victims, most saying they do not
want to report it to the University.
According to the FBI, a rape is
reported about once every six
minutes in the United States.
About half of all reported rapes
are acquaintance rapes, according
to the Santa Monica Rape Crisis
Center.
According to last spring's Rape
Education Project survey, 29 per
cent of female undergraduates at
Stanford and 10 percent of the
male undergraduates have been
coerced or forced into sexual ac
tivity against their will. Of those,
98 percent said they knew their
assailant.
However, Judicial Affairs rarely
hears about these incidents.
"There is knowledge of it out
there. People are discussing inci
dents, but those discussions stop
short of the victim seeking an in
vestigation," Cole says.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons says he was shocked by the
results of the survey. "That said
to me, boy, I'm out-of-touch," he
says. "Behavior that's going on
and what I understand (to be hap

pening) are out-of-sync."
He adds that he is familiar with
very few recent acquaintance rape
cases. "Why people don't report
(to the University) is a mystery
to me."
Cole also says she does not
know why the numbers of for
mally reported rapes are so low.
Mak, however, believes "the
lack of reported rapes is shouting
that there is something wrong"
with the University's handling of
the issue.
According to O'Brien, "If there
were any other crime happening
to that extent, we would be
dealing with it."
Unfairly judged?
Nina's foremost objection to the
process of reporting rape to the
University is the treatment she
feels she received in reporting the
incident. She believes the Univer
sity "judged" her unfairly in the
situation.
Cole explains that her position
as Judicial Affairs officer requires
her to judge the evidence.
"If the first person someone
turns to with an account of ac
quaintance rape is a person
charged with evaluating evidence,
it could be the case that the stu
dent comes away with a sense of
having been evaluated," she says.
"To the extent that that's a
problem and the student feels
poorly supported, I guess it's a
criticism of me, but what I think
needs to be done is to have that
student talk to someone whose
role is different first, where what
you really need is someone hug
ging you and listening to you and
not asking detailed questions and
looking for evidence.
"But [evaluating evidence is]
my job. It's not surprising that a
student that talks to me about
alleged misconduct of another stu
dent is going to feel that they are
being scrutinized," Cole adds.
Cole explains that it is very dif
ficult for the person evaluating
both sides of the situation to
remain both unbiased and provide
counseling.
But Nina says she did not object
to the scrutiny. Instead, she feels
that Cole's conclusion that she
was not raped was premature and
inappropriately delivered.
Cole's comments "minimized
what to me was, and still is, a
very terrifying experience and ex
onerated the male student's ac
tions," Nina says.
Nina believes the process she
went through exacerbated her
feelings of guilt about the inci
dent. "I felt as if I were the one
who had committed a great
wrong."
Mak says: "For a survivor to
deal with someone who is not em
pathetic or sensitive, well, that
could throw her off. She could be

hurt for years."
According to O'Brien, "It
makes a big difference in
how one recovers if one
can feel a sense of just- *
ice" that the case was

handled fairly.
Whether or not a wo
man has been raped ac
cording to the legal de
finition, she should be
treated with sensitivity
and as if she has been
raped, O'Brien says. "If

a woman feels she's
been raped, then for
her, she's been raped.'
The University has
resources to deal i
with the trauma of J
rape. Besides coun- £
seling resources at *
Residential Affairs Mt

and Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell Student Health
Center, there is an on-campus
group of trained Stanford staff
and students to help survivors of
sexual assault. Christine Griffith,
director of the Stanford Rape Re
sponse Group, says the group
hopes to be an advocate for the
victim immediately after the as
sault and later in the process of
recovering from the incident.
"We try to make the survivor
aware of the range of options
there are" within the University
and outside, she says. Counselors
would let the victim know that
reporting the incident to Judicial
Affairs would be one of the avail
able options. "You need to em
power [the victims! as much as
possible, and a good way is to let
them make the decisions."
Despite the group's efforts to
publicize its services, few students
have used its resources.
Nina suggests that all Univer
sity officials dealing with people
who have survived rape should
have formal training similar to
training for members of Griffith's
group. The Mid-Peninsula YWCA,
for example, offers sensitivity
training to the public.
Cole says she does not have a
problem with training, adding
that all people dealing with "dicey
issues" could use such education.
The right place to go?
But Cole says that "as an im
mediate response to a victim's
need for help, the judicial process
is not appropriate." Instead, "the
emergency counselors can lead to
. . . and set groundwork to eval

uate whether the judicial process
is appropriate" for the particular
case.
Lyons also questions whether
all acquaintance rapes should be
reported through Judicial Affairs.
"There is a problem because the
initial need to report may not be
a need to report or redress the
issue judicially but to get advice,"
Lyons says.
He said that in working with
students he has seen a wide range
of reactions, from"I just need to
talk about it with someone" to
"By God, I was sexually assaulted
and I want that person punished."
These are two different questions,
and they need to be addressed
differently, Lyons explains.
Mak says there are many prob
lems with the current set-up of
Judicial Affairs and the way it is
used.
Cole explains that prosecution
is only one of many possible re
sponses to acquaintance rape.
"Prosecutions will follow from
complaints and compelling
evidence. The basic solution to the
problem of sexual assault, how
ever, will not be found through
University or external judicial ac
tions," she says.
University ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan suggests that victims
report sexual assault to the police
before reporting it to Judicial Af
fairs. "That's something that
comes later, and only if it's be
tween students," and only if the
women have accepted that they
have been raped, she says."It
would be wrong to report it first
to [Judicial Affairsl."
Lyons explains: "The area of
date rape is three to four years
old" as a prominent public issue.
Cases of acquaintance rape may
test the judicial system "in ways
it may not be geared to respond
in because what constitutes date
rape may not be clear."
In cases of acquaintance rape
Lyons says, "We are probably
dealing with the fact that a person
genuinely feels used, hurt, abused.
But does that in and of itself con
stitute date rape?"
Lyons adds: "I suspect those are
emotions we are dealing with. The
sense of betrayal is the worst of
all human conditions to go
through. The victim can identify
who is responsible, but that
doesn't necessarily make it a
crime. It doesn't make it right
either."
Lyons says that in a case of
date rape, "there are a whole lot
of emotions that have to do with
betrayal. But I'm not sure the
judicial process is the place to deal
with it."

Tomorrow: Questions of evidence
and the victim's lack of rights.


When "Nina" saw a male acquaintance
at a fraternity party one Friday night
last spring, she began talking with him.
He asked her to go to another fraternity
party, where they drank and danced.
When Nina woke up later that night,
she could feel the semen running down
her leg. But she was drunk and couldn't
believe what was happening.
When she realized she was naked in
bed with a man on top of her, she was
too drunk and confused to respond to
the male, a student she had met a few
times before.
"I remember gasping a little in pain,"
Nina recalls, but she then passed out
again.
Nina remembers little else from that
night.
She does, however, remember the days
following the incident very clearly.
The next day, she woke up around 8
a.m., got dressed and walked home to
her dormitory across campus.
Later that day, Nina started to realize
that she may have been raped — not
by a strange man, but by a student she
knew. "It started to hit me and really
bother me," Nina says, her voice
shaking. "I started to cry."
"By mid-afternoon, I was sure that I
was raped," says Nina, now a junior.

Nina's case was reported to the Uni
versity's Judicial Affairs Office, but the
office never filed charges against the
alleged assailant. The office's handling
of the case raises a crucial question: Is
Judicial Affairs set up in a way that
allows it to competently handle cases of
sexual assault?
People who have survived rapes, some
administrators, and others who work
with the issue say the answer is no.
And if the University intends to punish
rapists, they say, it must adopt a more
sensitive and effective process.
According to the California Penal
Code, rape is defined as forced sexual
intercourse that is perpetrated against
the will of the victim. Title 9, section
261 says rape has occurred "where a
person is prevented from resisting by
any intoxication or anesthetic substance,
or any controlled substance, adminis

tered by or with the privity of the ac
cused."
Acquaintance rape, the most prevalent
form of rape on college campuses, may
be perpetrated by a date or boyfriend
of the victim, or by someone the victim
knows only casually — from a dormitory,
a class, or through mutual friends, ac
cording to the Santa Monica Rape Treat
ment Center's handbook "Sexual Assault
on Campus: What Colleges Can Do."
The book states, "Regardless of the
relationship between them, if one person
uses force to coerce another into sub
mitting to sexual intercourse, the act is
defined as rape."
Nina says: "It's very difficult to trust
any of your friends once one of your
friends — someone everyone trusted —
turns on you. I didn't even know him
that well. He knew all of my friends,
though."
Senior Suzanna Mak, founder and ad
ministrative director of Heightened Ed
ucation on Acquaintance Rape, says,"I
can't stress enough, it's probably going
to be someone on your floor, someone
you meet at a party, someone you go
on a date with.
"I know that's where it happens, and
unfortunately the survivors know that.
It's going to be someone you know," she
says.
Nina says many people doubted that
she was raped because she and the male
student were drunk at the time.
But junior Suzanne O'Brien, a mem
ber of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, says, "People don't know
that if a woman is drunk (when she is
raped), that is assault, that is rape be
cause she did not consent."
Alcohol "impairs a person's ability to
say no and it makes a person raping
you less responsive to your needs," she

explains. "Because of alcohol,
many victims are unable to
protest or fend someone off."
"People don't understand that
having sex with a girlfriend when
she doesn't want to is rape. And
I would guess that only one in
100 knows that it's rape if a
woman is drunk," O'Brien adds.
"Somewhere people don't make
the distinction that unwanted,
forced sex is rape," Mak says.
Deciding to report
When Nina realized she may
have been raped by another stu
dent, she was "in total shock and
very frightened," she says."I had
no idea what else might have hap
pened that night."
So Nina told a friend and her
roommate. When she repeated the
story a third time, this time to a
close male friend, he told her that
she had been raped.
"I told him, 'So what, I don't
know what to do.' " Neither she
nor her friends knew what to do
or who to call.
When they called her residence
dean, he was very supportive and
suggested she report it to Judicial
Affairs. "I was scared about what
was going to happen," Nina re
members. "I was afraid [the al
leged rapist] and his friends were
going to come and hunt me
down."
Despite her fears, Nina wanted
action taken against the alleged
rapist.
"I wanted some form ofjustice,"
she says."I thought it was so
unfair that I couldn't walk around
on campus or that I couldn't go
to campus parties and he could."
More than these personal
feelings, Nina says she was afraid
for other female students. "I
wanted to make sure this didn't
happen to anyone else," she says.
In describing her decision to
report the incident to Judicial Af
fairs, she says, "You feel so help
less, but you feel you have an
obligation to help every woman
who will have to report this."
Nina believed the male student
violated the Fundamental Stand
ard and should take responsibility
for his actions. "This goes not
only against the Fundamental
Standard, but it is also morally
wrong," she says.
The Monday following the rape,
Nina met with Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole for the first time.
According to Nina, Cole said she
did not know what to do in this
case because she did not have a
formal definition of rape.
Cole, who files all formal disci
plinary charges against students,
says there is no formal definition
of sexual assault in the "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," the University's guidelines
for applying the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
These guidelines include exam
ples of past cases of behavior code
violations, a policy on campus dis
ruption, a prohibition of the pos
session of "dangerous weapons"
and a list of possible penalties for
violations.
The guidelines do not mention
sexual assault. This does not
mean, however, that sexual as
sault does not violate the Funda
mental Standard; rather, it means
that there is no precedent for such
cases.
Cole said she could not com
ment on Nina's case because Nina
has filed a formal grievance
against Cole, and officials from
the Office of Student Affairs are
currently investigating whether
Cole handled the case properly.

However, Cole wrote a letter
published in the Jan. 19 Daily in
response to an editorial. In the
letter, she wrote about Nina's
case: "The evidence .. . was in
complete because of an alcohol
induced memory lapse by the
alleged victim. There was an ap
parently complete account (from
the male student), one partial ac
count (from the female student),

Case not opened
The day after Nina went to Jud
icial Affairs, Cole called the al
leged assailant into her office for
an interview.
During this time, Nina was de-

pressed and afraid. "I would eat
alone in my room because I didn't
want to see people, to eat dinner
and pretend to be happy. It's not
something you can explain why
you're bummed," Nina recalls.
She contacted the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA Rape Crisis Center for
counseling and advice.
On Friday, a week after the al
leged rape, Cole called Nina into
her office and told her the case
was closed due to a lack of
evidence.
According to Nina, Cole told her
that she was not raped.
Nina says that, at the meeting,
Cole told her that the male stu
dent was not a rapist but a "very
nice young man." According to
Nina, Cole then told her to tell
all of her friends that she had not
been raped. Cole said Nina owed
this to the man because he felt
betrayed.
"I felt as if she was trying to
make me see his position, as if
what he felt was much more im
portant than what I felt," Nina
recalls.
Cole then told Nina to meet
with the male student on Monday
"to work things out together,"
Nina recalls.
Nina felt intimidated into set
ting up the meeting with the male

student. "This
J was an author
ity, a Univers
ity official, tel
jZ ling me I wasn't
raped," she says.
1 In a Sept. 26
112 letter obtained by
~ The Daily, Cole told
Nina, "I do not accept

as accurate your ac
count of what I said to
you last May — though
I am sure that it reflects

V what you remember hear
) ing."
L Nina says the night after
* meeting with Cole, three
days before the meeting with
the alleged rapist, "was the
worst night of my life. I felt
so humiliated. I sat there

counting reasons to live,"
says Nina, holding back tears.
"It was the loneliest night of

my life."
Nina felt that the University
was telling her she was wrong.
"It feels like this big force was
against me," she says. She cried
that whole night.
Before the meeting, however,
Nina realized she could not come
face to face with her alleged rap
ist. She canceled the appointment
and informed Cole that she would
not meet the male student.
Infrequent reporting
Nina was the second person to
report an alleged case of rape be
tween students to Cole, who is
serving her eighth year as the
judicial affairs officer. Cole came
to Stanford in 1977 as a director
of research in Student Affairs.
According to Mak, the two re
ported cases are a mere fraction
of the acquaintance rapes that oc
cur on campus. Through her ad
vising of students who have been

raped, Mak says,"I know the
number of acquaintance rapes
this quarter is quite large."
Mak says she receives many
anonymous phone calls from rape
victims, most saying they do not
want to report it to the University.
According to the FBI, a rape is
reported about once every six
minutes in the United States.
About half of all reported rapes
are acquaintance rapes, according
to the Santa Monica Rape Crisis
Center.
According to last spring's Rape
Education Project survey, 29 per
cent of female undergraduates at
Stanford and 10 percent of the
male undergraduates have been
coerced or forced into sexual ac
tivity against their will. Of those,
98 percent said they knew their
assailant.
However, Judicial Affairs rarely
hears about these incidents.
"There is knowledge of it out

He adds that he is familiar with
very few recent acquaintance rape

Cole also says she does not
know why the numbers of for
mally reported rapes are so low.
Mak, however, believes "the
lack of reported rapes is shouting
that there is something wrong"
with the University's handling of
the issue.
According to O'Brien, "If there
were any other crime happening
to that extent, we would be
dealing with it."
Unfairly judged?
Nina's foremost objection to the
process of reporting rape to the
University is the treatment she
feels she received in reporting the
incident. She believes the Univer
sity "judged" her unfairly in the
situation.
Cole explains that her position
as Judicial Affairs officer requires
her to judge the evidence.
"If the first person someone
turns to with an account of ac
quaintance rape is a person
charged with evaluating evidence,
it could be the case that the stu
dent comes away with a sense of
having been evaluated," she says.
"To the extent that that's a
problem and the student feels
poorly supported, I guess it's a
criticism of me, but what I think
needs to be done is to have that
student talk to someone whose
role is different first, where what
you really need is someone hug
ging you and listening to you and
not asking detailed questions and
looking for evidence.
"But [evaluating evidence is]
my job. It's not surprising that a
student that talks to me about
alleged misconduct of another stu
dent is going to feel that they are
being scrutinized," Cole adds.
Cole explains that it is very dif
ficult for the person evaluating
both sides of the situation to
remain both unbiased and provide
counseling.
But Nina says she did not object
to the scrutiny. Instead, she feels
that Cole's conclusion that she
was not raped was premature and
inappropriately delivered.
Cole's comments "minimized
what to me was, and still is, a
very terrifying experience and ex
onerated the male student's ac
tions," Nina says.
Nina believes the process she
went through exacerbated her
feelings of guilt about the inci
dent. "I felt as if I were the one
who had committed a great
wrong."
Mak says: "For a survivor to
deal with someone who is not em
pathetic or sensitive, well, that
could throw her off. She could be

hurt for years."
According to O'Brien, "It
makes a big difference in
how one recovers if one
can feel a sense of just- *
ice" that the case was

handled fairly.
Whether or not a wo
man has been raped ac
cording to the legal de
finition, she should be
treated with sensitivity
and as if she has been
raped, O'Brien says. "If

a woman feels she's
been raped, then for
her, she's been raped.'
The University has
resources to deal i
with the trauma of J
rape. Besides coun- £
seling resources at *
Residential Affairs Mt

and Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell Student Health
Center, there is an on-campus
group of trained Stanford staff
and students to help survivors of
sexual assault. Christine Griffith,
director of the Stanford Rape Re
sponse Group, says the group
hopes to be an advocate for the
victim immediately after the as
sault and later in the process of
recovering from the incident.
"We try to make the survivor
aware of the range of options
there are" within the University
and outside, she says. Counselors
would let the victim know that
reporting the incident to Judicial
Affairs would be one of the avail
able options. "You need to em
power [the victims! as much as
possible, and a good way is to let
them make the decisions."
Despite the group's efforts to
publicize its services, few students
have used its resources.
Nina suggests that all Univer
sity officials dealing with people
who have survived rape should
have formal training similar to
training for members of Griffith's
group. The Mid-Peninsula YWCA,
for example, offers sensitivity
training to the public.
Cole says she does not have a
problem with training, adding
that all people dealing with "dicey
issues" could use such education.
The right place to go?
But Cole says that "as an im
mediate response to a victim's
need for help, the judicial process
is not appropriate." Instead, "the
emergency counselors can lead to
. . . and set groundwork to eval

uate whether the judicial process
is appropriate" for the particular
case.
Lyons also questions whether
all acquaintance rapes should be
reported through Judicial Affairs.
"There is a problem because the
initial need to report may not be
a need to report or redress the
issue judicially but to get advice,"
Lyons says.
He said that in working with
students he has seen a wide range
of reactions, from"I just need to
talk about it with someone" to
"By God, I was sexually assaulted
and I want that person punished."
These are two different questions,
and they need to be addressed
differently, Lyons explains.
Mak says there are many prob
lems with the current set-up of
Judicial Affairs and the way it is
used.
Cole explains that prosecution
is only one of many possible re
sponses to acquaintance rape.
"Prosecutions will follow from
complaints and compelling
evidence. The basic solution to the
problem of sexual assault, how
ever, will not be found through
University or external judicial ac
tions," she says.
University ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan suggests that victims
report sexual assault to the police
before reporting it to Judicial Af
fairs. "That's something that
comes later, and only if it's be
tween students," and only if the
women have accepted that they
have been raped, she says."It
would be wrong to report it first
to [Judicial Affairsl."
Lyons explains: "The area of
date rape is three to four years
old" as a prominent public issue.
Cases of acquaintance rape may
test the judicial system "in ways
it may not be geared to respond
in because what constitutes date
rape may not be clear."
In cases of acquaintance rape
Lyons says, "We are probably
dealing with the fact that a person
genuinely feels used, hurt, abused.
But does that in and of itself con
stitute date rape?"
Lyons adds: "I suspect those are
emotions we are dealing with. The
sense of betrayal is the worst of
all human conditions to go
through. The victim can identify
who is responsible, but that
doesn't necessarily make it a
crime. It doesn't make it right
either."
Lyons says that in a case of
date rape, "there are a whole lot
of emotions that have to do with
betrayal. But I'm not sure the
judicial process is the place to deal
with it."

Tomorrow: Questions of evidence
and the victim's lack of rights.


When "Nina" saw a male acquaintance
at a fraternity party one Friday night
last spring, she began talking with him.
He asked her to go to another fraternity
party, where they drank and danced.
When Nina woke up later that night,
she could feel the semen running down
her leg. But she was drunk and couldn't
believe what was happening.
When she realized she was naked in
bed with a man on top of her, she was
too drunk and confused to respond to
the male, a student she had met a few
times before.
"I remember gasping a little in pain,"
Nina recalls, but she then passed out
again.
Nina remembers little else from that
night.
She does, however, remember the days
following the incident very clearly.
The next day, she woke up around 8
a.m., got dressed and walked home to
her dormitory across campus.
Later that day, Nina started to realize
that she may have been raped — not
by a strange man, but by a student she
knew. "It started to hit me and really
bother me," Nina says, her voice
shaking. "I started to cry."
"By mid-afternoon, I was sure that I
was raped," says Nina, now a junior.

Nina's case was reported to the Uni
versity's Judicial Affairs Office, but the
office never filed charges against the
alleged assailant. The office's handling
of the case raises a crucial question: Is
Judicial Affairs set up in a way that
allows it to competently handle cases of
sexual assault?
People who have survived rapes, some
administrators, and others who work
with the issue say the answer is no.
And if the University intends to punish
rapists, they say, it must adopt a more
sensitive and effective process.
According to the California Penal
Code, rape is defined as forced sexual
intercourse that is perpetrated against
the will of the victim. Title 9, section
261 says rape has occurred "where a
person is prevented from resisting by
any intoxication or anesthetic substance,
or any controlled substance, adminis

tered by or with the privity of the ac
cused."
Acquaintance rape, the most prevalent
form of rape on college campuses, may
be perpetrated by a date or boyfriend
of the victim, or by someone the victim
knows only casually — from a dormitory,
a class, or through mutual friends, ac
cording to the Santa Monica Rape Treat
ment Center's handbook "Sexual Assault
on Campus: What Colleges Can Do."
The book states, "Regardless of the
relationship between them, if one person
uses force to coerce another into sub
mitting to sexual intercourse, the act is
defined as rape."
Nina says: "It's very difficult to trust
any of your friends once one of your
friends — someone everyone trusted —
turns on you. I didn't even know him
that well. He knew all of my friends,
though."
Senior Suzanna Mak, founder and ad
ministrative director of Heightened Ed
ucation on Acquaintance Rape, says,"I
can't stress enough, it's probably going
to be someone on your floor, someone
you meet at a party, someone you go
on a date with.
"I know that's where it happens, and
unfortunately the survivors know that.
It's going to be someone you know," she
says.
Nina says many people doubted that
she was raped because she and the male
student were drunk at the time.
But junior Suzanne O'Brien, a mem
ber of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, says, "People don't know
that if a woman is drunk (when she is
raped), that is assault, that is rape be
cause she did not consent."
Alcohol "impairs a person's ability to
say no and it makes a person raping
you less responsive to your needs," she

explains. "Because of alcohol,
many victims are unable to
protest or fend someone off."
"People don't understand that
having sex with a girlfriend when
she doesn't want to is rape. And
I would guess that only one in
100 knows that it's rape if a
woman is drunk," O'Brien adds.
"Somewhere people don't make
the distinction that unwanted,
forced sex is rape," Mak says.
Deciding to report
When Nina realized she may
have been raped by another stu
dent, she was "in total shock and
very frightened," she says."I had
no idea what else might have hap
pened that night."
So Nina told a friend and her
roommate. When she repeated the
story a third time, this time to a
close male friend, he told her that
she had been raped.
"I told him, 'So what, I don't
know what to do.' " Neither she
nor her friends knew what to do
or who to call.
When they called her residence
dean, he was very supportive and
suggested she report it to Judicial
Affairs. "I was scared about what
was going to happen," Nina re
members. "I was afraid [the al
leged rapist] and his friends were
going to come and hunt me
down."
Despite her fears, Nina wanted
action taken against the alleged
rapist.
"I wanted some form ofjustice,"
she says."I thought it was so
unfair that I couldn't walk around
on campus or that I couldn't go
to campus parties and he could."
More than these personal
feelings, Nina says she was afraid
for other female students. "I
wanted to make sure this didn't
happen to anyone else," she says.
In describing her decision to
report the incident to Judicial Af
fairs, she says, "You feel so help
less, but you feel you have an
obligation to help every woman
who will have to report this."
Nina believed the male student
violated the Fundamental Stand
ard and should take responsibility
for his actions. "This goes not
only against the Fundamental
Standard, but it is also morally
wrong," she says.
The Monday following the rape,
Nina met with Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole for the first time.
According to Nina, Cole said she
did not know what to do in this
case because she did not have a
formal definition of rape.
Cole, who files all formal disci
plinary charges against students,
says there is no formal definition
of sexual assault in the "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," the University's guidelines
for applying the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
These guidelines include exam
ples of past cases of behavior code
violations, a policy on campus dis
ruption, a prohibition of the pos
session of "dangerous weapons"
and a list of possible penalties for
violations.
The guidelines do not mention
sexual assault. This does not
mean, however, that sexual as
sault does not violate the Funda
mental Standard; rather, it means
that there is no precedent for such
cases.
Cole said she could not com
ment on Nina's case because Nina
has filed a formal grievance
against Cole, and officials from
the Office of Student Affairs are
currently investigating whether
Cole handled the case properly.

However, Cole wrote a letter
published in the Jan. 19 Daily in
response to an editorial. In the
letter, she wrote about Nina's
case: "The evidence .. . was in
complete because of an alcohol
induced memory lapse by the
alleged victim. There was an ap
parently complete account (from
the male student), one partial ac
count (from the female student),
no witnesses and no additional
evidence."
Case not opened
The day after Nina went to Jud
icial Affairs, Cole called the al
leged assailant into her office for
an interview.
During this time, Nina was de-

Whether or not a woman has been raped
according to the legal definition, she should
be treated with sensitivity and as if she has
been raped, says junior Suzanne O'Brien, a
member of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault. If a woman feels she's been
raped, then for her, she's been raped.'

pressed and afraid. "I would eat
alone in my room because I didn't
want to see people, to eat dinner
and pretend to be happy. It's not
something you can explain why
you're bummed," Nina recalls.
She contacted the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA Rape Crisis Center for
counseling and advice.
On Friday, a week after the al
leged rape, Cole called Nina into
her office and told her the case
was closed due to a lack of
evidence.
According to Nina, Cole told her
that she was not raped.
Nina says that, at the meeting,
Cole told her that the male stu
dent was not a rapist but a "very
nice young man." According to
Nina, Cole then told her to tell
all of her friends that she had not
been raped. Cole said Nina owed
this to the man because he felt
betrayed.
"I felt as if she was trying to
make me see his position, as if
what he felt was much more im
portant than what I felt," Nina
recalls.
Cole then told Nina to meet
with the male student on Monday
"to work things out together,"
Nina recalls.
Nina felt intimidated into set
ting up the meeting with the male

student. "This
J was an author
ity, a Univers
ity official, tel
jZ ling me I wasn't
raped," she says.
1 In a Sept. 26
112 letter obtained by
~ The Daily, Cole told
Nina, "I do not accept

as accurate your ac
count of what I said to
you last May — though
I am sure that it reflects

V what you remember hear
) ing."
L Nina says the night after
* meeting with Cole, three
days before the meeting with
the alleged rapist, "was the
worst night of my life. I felt
so humiliated. I sat there

counting reasons to live,"
says Nina, holding back tears.
"It was the loneliest night of

my life."
Nina felt that the University
was telling her she was wrong.
"It feels like this big force was
against me," she says. She cried
that whole night.
Before the meeting, however,
Nina realized she could not come
face to face with her alleged rap
ist. She canceled the appointment
and informed Cole that she would
not meet the male student.
Infrequent reporting
Nina was the second person to
report an alleged case of rape be
tween students to Cole, who is
serving her eighth year as the
judicial affairs officer. Cole came
to Stanford in 1977 as a director
of research in Student Affairs.
According to Mak, the two re
ported cases are a mere fraction
of the acquaintance rapes that oc
cur on campus. Through her ad
vising of students who have been

raped, Mak says,"I know the
number of acquaintance rapes
this quarter is quite large."
Mak says she receives many
anonymous phone calls from rape
victims, most saying they do not
want to report it to the University.
According to the FBI, a rape is
reported about once every six
minutes in the United States.
About half of all reported rapes
are acquaintance rapes, according
to the Santa Monica Rape Crisis
Center.
According to last spring's Rape
Education Project survey, 29 per
cent of female undergraduates at
Stanford and 10 percent of the
male undergraduates have been
coerced or forced into sexual ac
tivity against their will. Of those,
98 percent said they knew their
assailant.
However, Judicial Affairs rarely
hears about these incidents.
"There is knowledge of it out
there. People are discussing inci
dents, but those discussions stop
short of the victim seeking an in
vestigation," Cole says.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons says he was shocked by the
results of the survey. "That said
to me, boy, I'm out-of-touch," he
says. "Behavior that's going on
and what I understand (to be hap

pening) are out-of-sync."
He adds that he is familiar with
very few recent acquaintance rape
cases. "Why people don't report
(to the University) is a mystery
to me."
Cole also says she does not
know why the numbers of for
mally reported rapes are so low.
Mak, however, believes "the
lack of reported rapes is shouting
that there is something wrong"
with the University's handling of
the issue.
According to O'Brien, "If there
were any other crime happening
to that extent, we would be
dealing with it."
Unfairly judged?
Nina's foremost objection to the
process of reporting rape to the
University is the treatment she
feels she received in reporting the
incident. She believes the Univer
sity "judged" her unfairly in the
situation.
Cole explains that her position
as Judicial Affairs officer requires
her to judge the evidence.
"If the first person someone
turns to with an account of ac
quaintance rape is a person
charged with evaluating evidence,
it could be the case that the stu
dent comes away with a sense of
having been evaluated," she says.
"To the extent that that's a
problem and the student feels
poorly supported, I guess it's a
criticism of me, but what I think
needs to be done is to have that
student talk to someone whose
role is different first, where what
you really need is someone hug
ging you and listening to you and
not asking detailed questions and
looking for evidence.
"But [evaluating evidence is]
my job. It's not surprising that a
student that talks to me about
alleged misconduct of another stu
dent is going to feel that they are
being scrutinized," Cole adds.
Cole explains that it is very dif
ficult for the person evaluating
both sides of the situation to
remain both unbiased and provide
counseling.
But Nina says she did not object
to the scrutiny. Instead, she feels
that Cole's conclusion that she
was not raped was premature and
inappropriately delivered.
Cole's comments "minimized
what to me was, and still is, a
very terrifying experience and ex
onerated the male student's ac
tions," Nina says.
Nina believes the process she
went through exacerbated her
feelings of guilt about the inci
dent. "I felt as if I were the one
who had committed a great
wrong."
Mak says: "For a survivor to
deal with someone who is not em
pathetic or sensitive, well, that
could throw her off. She could be

hurt for years."
According to O'Brien, "It
makes a big difference in
how one recovers if one
can feel a sense of just- *
ice" that the case was

handled fairly.
Whether or not a wo
man has been raped ac
cording to the legal de
finition, she should be
treated with sensitivity
and as if she has been
raped, O'Brien says. "If

a woman feels she's
been raped, then for
her, she's been raped.'
The University has
resources to deal i
with the trauma of J
rape. Besides coun- £
seling resources at *
Residential Affairs Mt

and Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell Student Health
Center, there is an on-campus
group of trained Stanford staff
and students to help survivors of
sexual assault. Christine Griffith,
director of the Stanford Rape Re
sponse Group, says the group
hopes to be an advocate for the
victim immediately after the as
sault and later in the process of
recovering from the incident.
"We try to make the survivor
aware of the range of options
there are" within the University
and outside, she says. Counselors
would let the victim know that
reporting the incident to Judicial
Affairs would be one of the avail
able options. "You need to em
power [the victims! as much as
possible, and a good way is to let
them make the decisions."
Despite the group's efforts to
publicize its services, few students
have used its resources.
Nina suggests that all Univer
sity officials dealing with people
who have survived rape should
have formal training similar to
training for members of Griffith's
group. The Mid-Peninsula YWCA,
for example, offers sensitivity
training to the public.
Cole says she does not have a
problem with training, adding
that all people dealing with "dicey
issues" could use such education.
The right place to go?
But Cole says that "as an im
mediate response to a victim's
need for help, the judicial process
is not appropriate." Instead, "the
emergency counselors can lead to
. . . and set groundwork to eval

uate whether the judicial process
is appropriate" for the particular
case.
Lyons also questions whether
all acquaintance rapes should be
reported through Judicial Affairs.
"There is a problem because the
initial need to report may not be
a need to report or redress the
issue judicially but to get advice,"
Lyons says.
He said that in working with
students he has seen a wide range
of reactions, from"I just need to
talk about it with someone" to
"By God, I was sexually assaulted
and I want that person punished."
These are two different questions,
and they need to be addressed
differently, Lyons explains.
Mak says there are many prob
lems with the current set-up of
Judicial Affairs and the way it is
used.
Cole explains that prosecution
is only one of many possible re
sponses to acquaintance rape.
"Prosecutions will follow from
complaints and compelling
evidence. The basic solution to the
problem of sexual assault, how
ever, will not be found through
University or external judicial ac
tions," she says.
University ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan suggests that victims
report sexual assault to the police
before reporting it to Judicial Af
fairs. "That's something that
comes later, and only if it's be
tween students," and only if the
women have accepted that they
have been raped, she says."It
would be wrong to report it first
to [Judicial Affairsl."
Lyons explains: "The area of
date rape is three to four years
old" as a prominent public issue.
Cases of acquaintance rape may
test the judicial system "in ways
it may not be geared to respond
in because what constitutes date
rape may not be clear."
In cases of acquaintance rape
Lyons says, "We are probably
dealing with the fact that a person
genuinely feels used, hurt, abused.
But does that in and of itself con
stitute date rape?"
Lyons adds: "I suspect those are
emotions we are dealing with. The
sense of betrayal is the worst of
all human conditions to go
through. The victim can identify
who is responsible, but that
doesn't necessarily make it a
crime. It doesn't make it right
either."
Lyons says that in a case of
date rape, "there are a whole lot
of emotions that have to do with
betrayal. But I'm not sure the
judicial process is the place to deal
with it."

and the victim's lack of rights.


When "Nina" saw a male acquaintance
at a fraternity party one Friday night
last spring, she began talking with him.
He asked her to go to another fraternity
party, where they drank and danced.
When Nina woke up later that night,
she could feel the semen running down
her leg. But she was drunk and couldn't
believe what was happening.
When she realized she was naked in
bed with a man on top of her, she was
too drunk and confused to respond to
the male, a student she had met a few
times before.
"I remember gasping a little in pain,"
Nina recalls, but she then passed out
again.
Nina remembers little else from that
night.
She does, however, remember the days
following the incident very clearly.
The next day, she woke up around 8
a.m., got dressed and walked home to
her dormitory across campus.
Later that day, Nina started to realize
that she may have been raped — not
by a strange man, but by a student she
knew. "It started to hit me and really
bother me," Nina says, her voice
shaking. "I started to cry."
"By mid-afternoon, I was sure that I
was raped," says Nina, now a junior.

Nina's case was reported to the Uni
versity's Judicial Affairs Office, but the
office never filed charges against the
alleged assailant. The office's handling
of the case raises a crucial question: Is
Judicial Affairs set up in a way that
allows it to competently handle cases of
sexual assault?
People who have survived rapes, some
administrators, and others who work
with the issue say the answer is no.
And if the University intends to punish
rapists, they say, it must adopt a more
sensitive and effective process.
According to the California Penal
Code, rape is defined as forced sexual
intercourse that is perpetrated against
the will of the victim. Title 9, section
261 says rape has occurred "where a
person is prevented from resisting by
any intoxication or anesthetic substance,
or any controlled substance, adminis

tered by or with the privity of the ac
cused."
Acquaintance rape, the most prevalent
form of rape on college campuses, may
be perpetrated by a date or boyfriend
of the victim, or by someone the victim
knows only casually — from a dormitory,
a class, or through mutual friends, ac
cording to the Santa Monica Rape Treat
ment Center's handbook "Sexual Assault
on Campus: What Colleges Can Do."
The book states, "Regardless of the
relationship between them, if one person
uses force to coerce another into sub
mitting to sexual intercourse, the act is
defined as rape."
Nina says: "It's very difficult to trust
any of your friends once one of your
friends — someone everyone trusted —
turns on you. I didn't even know him
that well. He knew all of my friends,
though."
Senior Suzanna Mak, founder and ad
ministrative director of Heightened Ed
ucation on Acquaintance Rape, says,"I
can't stress enough, it's probably going
to be someone on your floor, someone
you meet at a party, someone you go
on a date with.
"I know that's where it happens, and
unfortunately the survivors know that.
It's going to be someone you know," she
says.
Nina says many people doubted that
she was raped because she and the male
student were drunk at the time.
But junior Suzanne O'Brien, a mem
ber of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, says, "People don't know
that if a woman is drunk (when she is
raped), that is assault, that is rape be
cause she did not consent."
Alcohol "impairs a person's ability to
say no and it makes a person raping
you less responsive to your needs," she

explains. "Because of alcohol,
many victims are unable to
protest or fend someone off."
"People don't understand that
having sex with a girlfriend when
she doesn't want to is rape. And
I would guess that only one in
100 knows that it's rape if a
woman is drunk," O'Brien adds.
"Somewhere people don't make
the distinction that unwanted,
forced sex is rape," Mak says.
Deciding to report
When Nina realized she may
have been raped by another stu
dent, she was "in total shock and
very frightened," she says."I had
no idea what else might have hap
pened that night."
So Nina told a friend and her
roommate. When she repeated the
story a third time, this time to a
close male friend, he told her that
she had been raped.
"I told him, 'So what, I don't
know what to do.' " Neither she
nor her friends knew what to do
or who to call.
When they called her residence
dean, he was very supportive and
suggested she report it to Judicial
Affairs. "I was scared about what
was going to happen," Nina re
members. "I was afraid [the al
leged rapist] and his friends were
going to come and hunt me
down."
Despite her fears, Nina wanted
action taken against the alleged
rapist.
"I wanted some form ofjustice,"
she says."I thought it was so
unfair that I couldn't walk around
on campus or that I couldn't go
to campus parties and he could."
More than these personal
feelings, Nina says she was afraid
for other female students. "I
wanted to make sure this didn't
happen to anyone else," she says.
In describing her decision to
report the incident to Judicial Af
fairs, she says, "You feel so help
less, but you feel you have an
obligation to help every woman
who will have to report this."
Nina believed the male student
violated the Fundamental Stand
ard and should take responsibility
for his actions. "This goes not
only against the Fundamental
Standard, but it is also morally
wrong," she says.
The Monday following the rape,
Nina met with Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole for the first time.
According to Nina, Cole said she
did not know what to do in this
case because she did not have a
formal definition of rape.
Cole, who files all formal disci
plinary charges against students,
says there is no formal definition
of sexual assault in the "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," the University's guidelines
for applying the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
These guidelines include exam
ples of past cases of behavior code
violations, a policy on campus dis
ruption, a prohibition of the pos
session of "dangerous weapons"
and a list of possible penalties for
violations.
The guidelines do not mention
sexual assault. This does not
mean, however, that sexual as
sault does not violate the Funda
mental Standard; rather, it means
that there is no precedent for such
cases.
Cole said she could not com
ment on Nina's case because Nina
has filed a formal grievance
against Cole, and officials from
the Office of Student Affairs are
currently investigating whether
Cole handled the case properly.

However, Cole wrote a letter
published in the Jan. 19 Daily in
response to an editorial. In the
letter, she wrote about Nina's
case: "The evidence .. . was in
complete because of an alcohol
induced memory lapse by the
alleged victim. There was an ap
parently complete account (from
the male student), one partial ac

Case not opened
The day after Nina went to Jud
icial Affairs, Cole called the al
leged assailant into her office for
an interview.
During this time, Nina was de-

pressed and afraid. "I would eat
alone in my room because I didn't
want to see people, to eat dinner
and pretend to be happy. It's not
something you can explain why
you're bummed," Nina recalls.
She contacted the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA Rape Crisis Center for
counseling and advice.
On Friday, a week after the al
leged rape, Cole called Nina into
her office and told her the case
was closed due to a lack of
evidence.
According to Nina, Cole told her
that she was not raped.
Nina says that, at the meeting,
Cole told her that the male stu
dent was not a rapist but a "very
nice young man." According to
Nina, Cole then told her to tell
all of her friends that she had not
been raped. Cole said Nina owed
this to the man because he felt
betrayed.
"I felt as if she was trying to
make me see his position, as if
what he felt was much more im
portant than what I felt," Nina
recalls.
Cole then told Nina to meet
with the male student on Monday
"to work things out together,"
Nina recalls.
Nina felt intimidated into set
ting up the meeting with the male

student. "This
J was an author
ity, a Univers
ity official, tel
jZ ling me I wasn't
raped," she says.
1 In a Sept. 26
112 letter obtained by
~ The Daily, Cole told
Nina, "I do not accept

as accurate your ac
count of what I said to
you last May — though
I am sure that it reflects

V what you remember hear
) ing."
L Nina says the night after
* meeting with Cole, three
days before the meeting with
the alleged rapist, "was the
worst night of my life. I felt
so humiliated. I sat there

counting reasons to live,"
says Nina, holding back tears.
"It was the loneliest night of

my life."
Nina felt that the University
was telling her she was wrong.
"It feels like this big force was
against me," she says. She cried
that whole night.
Before the meeting, however,
Nina realized she could not come
face to face with her alleged rap
ist. She canceled the appointment
and informed Cole that she would
not meet the male student.
Infrequent reporting
Nina was the second person to
report an alleged case of rape be
tween students to Cole, who is
serving her eighth year as the
judicial affairs officer. Cole came
to Stanford in 1977 as a director
of research in Student Affairs.
According to Mak, the two re
ported cases are a mere fraction
of the acquaintance rapes that oc
cur on campus. Through her ad
vising of students who have been

raped, Mak says,"I know the
number of acquaintance rapes
this quarter is quite large."
Mak says she receives many
anonymous phone calls from rape
victims, most saying they do not
want to report it to the University.
According to the FBI, a rape is
reported about once every six
minutes in the United States.
About half of all reported rapes
are acquaintance rapes, according
to the Santa Monica Rape Crisis
Center.
According to last spring's Rape
Education Project survey, 29 per
cent of female undergraduates at
Stanford and 10 percent of the
male undergraduates have been
coerced or forced into sexual ac
tivity against their will. Of those,
98 percent said they knew their
assailant.
However, Judicial Affairs rarely
hears about these incidents.
"There is knowledge of it out
there. People are discussing inci
dents, but those discussions stop
short of the victim seeking an in
vestigation," Cole says.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons says he was shocked by the
results of the survey. "That said
to me, boy, I'm out-of-touch," he
says. "Behavior that's going on
and what I understand (to be hap

pening) are out-of-sync."
He adds that he is familiar with
very few recent acquaintance rape
cases. "Why people don't report
(to the University) is a mystery
to me."
Cole also says she does not
know why the numbers of for
mally reported rapes are so low.
Mak, however, believes "the
lack of reported rapes is shouting
that there is something wrong"
with the University's handling of
the issue.
According to O'Brien, "If there
were any other crime happening
to that extent, we would be
dealing with it."
Unfairly judged?
Nina's foremost objection to the
process of reporting rape to the
University is the treatment she
feels she received in reporting the
incident. She believes the Univer
sity "judged" her unfairly in the
situation.
Cole explains that her position
as Judicial Affairs officer requires
her to judge the evidence.
"If the first person someone
turns to with an account of ac
quaintance rape is a person
charged with evaluating evidence,
it could be the case that the stu
dent comes away with a sense of
having been evaluated," she says.
"To the extent that that's a
problem and the student feels
poorly supported, I guess it's a
criticism of me, but what I think
needs to be done is to have that
student talk to someone whose
role is different first, where what
you really need is someone hug
ging you and listening to you and
not asking detailed questions and
looking for evidence.
"But [evaluating evidence is]
my job. It's not surprising that a
student that talks to me about
alleged misconduct of another stu
dent is going to feel that they are
being scrutinized," Cole adds.
Cole explains that it is very dif
ficult for the person evaluating
both sides of the situation to
remain both unbiased and provide
counseling.
But Nina says she did not object
to the scrutiny. Instead, she feels
that Cole's conclusion that she
was not raped was premature and
inappropriately delivered.
Cole's comments "minimized
what to me was, and still is, a
very terrifying experience and ex
onerated the male student's ac
tions," Nina says.
Nina believes the process she
went through exacerbated her
feelings of guilt about the inci
dent. "I felt as if I were the one
who had committed a great
wrong."
Mak says: "For a survivor to
deal with someone who is not em
pathetic or sensitive, well, that
could throw her off. She could be

hurt for years."
According to O'Brien, "It
makes a big difference in
how one recovers if one
can feel a sense of just- *
ice" that the case was

handled fairly.
Whether or not a wo
man has been raped ac
cording to the legal de
finition, she should be
treated with sensitivity
and as if she has been
raped, O'Brien says. "If

a woman feels she's
been raped, then for
her, she's been raped.'
The University has
resources to deal i
with the trauma of J
rape. Besides coun- £
seling resources at *
Residential Affairs Mt

and Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell Student Health
Center, there is an on-campus
group of trained Stanford staff
and students to help survivors of
sexual assault. Christine Griffith,
director of the Stanford Rape Re
sponse Group, says the group
hopes to be an advocate for the
victim immediately after the as
sault and later in the process of
recovering from the incident.
"We try to make the survivor
aware of the range of options
there are" within the University
and outside, she says. Counselors
would let the victim know that
reporting the incident to Judicial
Affairs would be one of the avail
able options. "You need to em
power [the victims! as much as
possible, and a good way is to let
them make the decisions."
Despite the group's efforts to
publicize its services, few students
have used its resources.
Nina suggests that all Univer
sity officials dealing with people
who have survived rape should
have formal training similar to
training for members of Griffith's
group. The Mid-Peninsula YWCA,
for example, offers sensitivity
training to the public.
Cole says she does not have a
problem with training, adding
that all people dealing with "dicey
issues" could use such education.
The right place to go?
But Cole says that "as an im
mediate response to a victim's
need for help, the judicial process
is not appropriate." Instead, "the
emergency counselors can lead to
. . . and set groundwork to eval

uate whether the judicial process
is appropriate" for the particular
case.
Lyons also questions whether
all acquaintance rapes should be
reported through Judicial Affairs.
"There is a problem because the
initial need to report may not be
a need to report or redress the
issue judicially but to get advice,"
Lyons says.
He said that in working with
students he has seen a wide range
of reactions, from"I just need to
talk about it with someone" to
"By God, I was sexually assaulted
and I want that person punished."
These are two different questions,
and they need to be addressed
differently, Lyons explains.
Mak says there are many prob
lems with the current set-up of
Judicial Affairs and the way it is
used.
Cole explains that prosecution
is only one of many possible re
sponses to acquaintance rape.
"Prosecutions will follow from
complaints and compelling
evidence. The basic solution to the
problem of sexual assault, how
ever, will not be found through
University or external judicial ac
tions," she says.
University ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan suggests that victims
report sexual assault to the police
before reporting it to Judicial Af
fairs. "That's something that
comes later, and only if it's be
tween students," and only if the
women have accepted that they
have been raped, she says."It
would be wrong to report it first
to [Judicial Affairsl."
Lyons explains: "The area of
date rape is three to four years
old" as a prominent public issue.
Cases of acquaintance rape may
test the judicial system "in ways
it may not be geared to respond
in because what constitutes date
rape may not be clear."
In cases of acquaintance rape
Lyons says, "We are probably
dealing with the fact that a person
genuinely feels used, hurt, abused.
But does that in and of itself con
stitute date rape?"
Lyons adds: "I suspect those are
emotions we are dealing with. The
sense of betrayal is the worst of
all human conditions to go
through. The victim can identify
who is responsible, but that
doesn't necessarily make it a
crime. It doesn't make it right
either."
Lyons says that in a case of
date rape, "there are a whole lot
of emotions that have to do with
betrayal. But I'm not sure the
judicial process is the place to deal
with it."

and the victim's lack of rights.


When "Nina" saw a male acquaintance
at a fraternity party one Friday night
last spring, she began talking with him.
He asked her to go to another fraternity
party, where they drank and danced.
When Nina woke up later that night,
she could feel the semen running down
her leg. But she was drunk and couldn't
believe what was happening.
When she realized she was naked in
bed with a man on top of her, she was
too drunk and confused to respond to
the male, a student she had met a few
times before.
"I remember gasping a little in pain,"
Nina recalls, but she then passed out
again.
Nina remembers little else from that
night.
She does, however, remember the days
following the incident very clearly.
The next day, she woke up around 8
a.m., got dressed and walked home to
her dormitory across campus.
Later that day, Nina started to realize
that she may have been raped — not
by a strange man, but by a student she
knew. "It started to hit me and really
bother me," Nina says, her voice
shaking. "I started to cry."
"By mid-afternoon, I was sure that I
was raped," says Nina, now a junior.

Nina's case was reported to the Uni
versity's Judicial Affairs Office, but the
office never filed charges against the
alleged assailant. The office's handling
of the case raises a crucial question: Is
Judicial Affairs set up in a way that
allows it to competently handle cases of
sexual assault?
People who have survived rapes, some
administrators, and others who work
with the issue say the answer is no.
And if the University intends to punish
rapists, they say, it must adopt a more
sensitive and effective process.
According to the California Penal
Code, rape is defined as forced sexual
intercourse that is perpetrated against
the will of the victim. Title 9, section
261 says rape has occurred "where a
person is prevented from resisting by
any intoxication or anesthetic substance,
or any controlled substance, adminis

tered by or with the privity of the ac
cused."
Acquaintance rape, the most prevalent
form of rape on college campuses, may
be perpetrated by a date or boyfriend
of the victim, or by someone the victim
knows only casually — from a dormitory,
a class, or through mutual friends, ac
cording to the Santa Monica Rape Treat
ment Center's handbook "Sexual Assault
on Campus: What Colleges Can Do."
The book states, "Regardless of the
relationship between them, if one person
uses force to coerce another into sub
mitting to sexual intercourse, the act is
defined as rape."
Nina says: "It's very difficult to trust
any of your friends once one of your
friends — someone everyone trusted —
turns on you. I didn't even know him
that well. He knew all of my friends,
though."
Senior Suzanna Mak, founder and ad
ministrative director of Heightened Ed
ucation on Acquaintance Rape, says,"I
can't stress enough, it's probably going
to be someone on your floor, someone
you meet at a party, someone you go
on a date with.
"I know that's where it happens, and
unfortunately the survivors know that.
It's going to be someone you know," she
says.
Nina says many people doubted that
she was raped because she and the male
student were drunk at the time.
But junior Suzanne O'Brien, a mem
ber of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault, says, "People don't know
that if a woman is drunk (when she is
raped), that is assault, that is rape be
cause she did not consent."
Alcohol "impairs a person's ability to
say no and it makes a person raping
you less responsive to your needs," she

explains. "Because of alcohol,
many victims are unable to
protest or fend someone off."
"People don't understand that
having sex with a girlfriend when
she doesn't want to is rape. And
I would guess that only one in
100 knows that it's rape if a
woman is drunk," O'Brien adds.
"Somewhere people don't make
the distinction that unwanted,
forced sex is rape," Mak says.
Deciding to report
When Nina realized she may
have been raped by another stu
dent, she was "in total shock and
very frightened," she says."I had
no idea what else might have hap
pened that night."
So Nina told a friend and her
roommate. When she repeated the
story a third time, this time to a
close male friend, he told her that
she had been raped.
"I told him, 'So what, I don't
know what to do.' " Neither she
nor her friends knew what to do
or who to call.
When they called her residence
dean, he was very supportive and
suggested she report it to Judicial
Affairs. "I was scared about what
was going to happen," Nina re
members. "I was afraid [the al
leged rapist] and his friends were
going to come and hunt me
down."
Despite her fears, Nina wanted
action taken against the alleged
rapist.
"I wanted some form ofjustice,"
she says."I thought it was so
unfair that I couldn't walk around
on campus or that I couldn't go
to campus parties and he could."
More than these personal
feelings, Nina says she was afraid
for other female students. "I
wanted to make sure this didn't
happen to anyone else," she says.
In describing her decision to
report the incident to Judicial Af
fairs, she says, "You feel so help
less, but you feel you have an
obligation to help every woman
who will have to report this."
Nina believed the male student
violated the Fundamental Stand
ard and should take responsibility
for his actions. "This goes not
only against the Fundamental
Standard, but it is also morally
wrong," she says.
The Monday following the rape,
Nina met with Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole for the first time.
According to Nina, Cole said she
did not know what to do in this
case because she did not have a
formal definition of rape.
Cole, who files all formal disci
plinary charges against students,
says there is no formal definition
of sexual assault in the "Regula
tions Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforce
ment," the University's guidelines
for applying the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code.
These guidelines include exam
ples of past cases of behavior code
violations, a policy on campus dis
ruption, a prohibition of the pos
session of "dangerous weapons"
and a list of possible penalties for
violations.
The guidelines do not mention
sexual assault. This does not
mean, however, that sexual as
sault does not violate the Funda
mental Standard; rather, it means
that there is no precedent for such
cases.
Cole said she could not com
ment on Nina's case because Nina
has filed a formal grievance
against Cole, and officials from
the Office of Student Affairs are
currently investigating whether
Cole handled the case properly.

However, Cole wrote a letter
published in the Jan. 19 Daily in
response to an editorial. In the
letter, she wrote about Nina's
case: "The evidence .. . was in
complete because of an alcohol
induced memory lapse by the
alleged victim. There was an ap
parently complete account (from
the male student), one partial ac
count (from the female student),
no witnesses and no additional
evidence."
Case not opened
The day after Nina went to Jud
icial Affairs, Cole called the al
leged assailant into her office for
an interview.
During this time, Nina was de-

Whether or not a woman has been raped
according to the legal definition, she should
be treated with sensitivity and as if she has
been raped, says junior Suzanne O'Brien, a
member of the University Task Force on
Sexual Assault. If a woman feels she's been
raped, then for her, she's been raped.'

pressed and afraid. "I would eat
alone in my room because I didn't
want to see people, to eat dinner
and pretend to be happy. It's not
something you can explain why
you're bummed," Nina recalls.
She contacted the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA Rape Crisis Center for
counseling and advice.
On Friday, a week after the al
leged rape, Cole called Nina into
her office and told her the case
was closed due to a lack of
evidence.
According to Nina, Cole told her
that she was not raped.
Nina says that, at the meeting,
Cole told her that the male stu
dent was not a rapist but a "very
nice young man." According to
Nina, Cole then told her to tell
all of her friends that she had not
been raped. Cole said Nina owed
this to the man because he felt
betrayed.
"I felt as if she was trying to
make me see his position, as if
what he felt was much more im
portant than what I felt," Nina
recalls.
Cole then told Nina to meet
with the male student on Monday
"to work things out together,"
Nina recalls.
Nina felt intimidated into set
ting up the meeting with the male

student. "This
J was an author
ity, a Univers
ity official, tel
jZ ling me I wasn't
raped," she says.
1 In a Sept. 26
112 letter obtained by
~ The Daily, Cole told
Nina, "I do not accept

as accurate your ac
count of what I said to
you last May — though
I am sure that it reflects

V what you remember hear
) ing."
L Nina says the night after
* meeting with Cole, three
days before the meeting with
the alleged rapist, "was the
worst night of my life. I felt
so humiliated. I sat there

counting reasons to live,"
says Nina, holding back tears.
"It was the loneliest night of

my life."
Nina felt that the University
was telling her she was wrong.
"It feels like this big force was
against me," she says. She cried
that whole night.
Before the meeting, however,
Nina realized she could not come
face to face with her alleged rap
ist. She canceled the appointment
and informed Cole that she would
not meet the male student.
Infrequent reporting
Nina was the second person to
report an alleged case of rape be
tween students to Cole, who is
serving her eighth year as the
judicial affairs officer. Cole came
to Stanford in 1977 as a director
of research in Student Affairs.
According to Mak, the two re
ported cases are a mere fraction
of the acquaintance rapes that oc
cur on campus. Through her ad
vising of students who have been

raped, Mak says,"I know the
number of acquaintance rapes
this quarter is quite large."
Mak says she receives many
anonymous phone calls from rape
victims, most saying they do not
want to report it to the University.
According to the FBI, a rape is
reported about once every six
minutes in the United States.
About half of all reported rapes
are acquaintance rapes, according
to the Santa Monica Rape Crisis
Center.
According to last spring's Rape
Education Project survey, 29 per
cent of female undergraduates at
Stanford and 10 percent of the
male undergraduates have been
coerced or forced into sexual ac
tivity against their will. Of those,
98 percent said they knew their
assailant.
However, Judicial Affairs rarely
hears about these incidents.
"There is knowledge of it out
there. People are discussing inci
dents, but those discussions stop
short of the victim seeking an in
vestigation," Cole says.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons says he was shocked by the
results of the survey. "That said
to me, boy, I'm out-of-touch," he
says. "Behavior that's going on
and what I understand (to be hap

pening) are out-of-sync."
He adds that he is familiar with
very few recent acquaintance rape
cases. "Why people don't report
(to the University) is a mystery
to me."
Cole also says she does not
know why the numbers of for
mally reported rapes are so low.
Mak, however, believes "the
lack of reported rapes is shouting
that there is something wrong"
with the University's handling of
the issue.
According to O'Brien, "If there
were any other crime happening
to that extent, we would be
dealing with it."
Unfairly judged?
Nina's foremost objection to the
process of reporting rape to the
University is the treatment she
feels she received in reporting the
incident. She believes the Univer
sity "judged" her unfairly in the
situation.
Cole explains that her position
as Judicial Affairs officer requires
her to judge the evidence.
"If the first person someone
turns to with an account of ac
quaintance rape is a person
charged with evaluating evidence,
it could be the case that the stu
dent comes away with a sense of
having been evaluated," she says.
"To the extent that that's a
problem and the student feels
poorly supported, I guess it's a
criticism of me, but what I think
needs to be done is to have that
student talk to someone whose
role is different first, where what
you really need is someone hug
ging you and listening to you and
not asking detailed questions and
looking for evidence.
"But [evaluating evidence is]
my job. It's not surprising that a
student that talks to me about
alleged misconduct of another stu
dent is going to feel that they are
being scrutinized," Cole adds.
Cole explains that it is very dif
ficult for the person evaluating
both sides of the situation to
remain both unbiased and provide
counseling.
But Nina says she did not object
to the scrutiny. Instead, she feels
that Cole's conclusion that she
was not raped was premature and
inappropriately delivered.
Cole's comments "minimized
what to me was, and still is, a
very terrifying experience and ex
onerated the male student's ac
tions," Nina says.
Nina believes the process she
went through exacerbated her
feelings of guilt about the inci
dent. "I felt as if I were the one
who had committed a great
wrong."
Mak says: "For a survivor to
deal with someone who is not em
pathetic or sensitive, well, that
could throw her off. She could be

hurt for years."
According to O'Brien, "It
makes a big difference in
how one recovers if one
can feel a sense of just- *
ice" that the case was

handled fairly.
Whether or not a wo
man has been raped ac
cording to the legal de
finition, she should be
treated with sensitivity
and as if she has been
raped, O'Brien says. "If

a woman feels she's
been raped, then for
her, she's been raped.'
The University has
resources to deal i
with the trauma of J
rape. Besides coun- £
seling resources at *
Residential Affairs Mt

and Counseling and Psychological
Services at Cowell Student Health
Center, there is an on-campus
group of trained Stanford staff
and students to help survivors of
sexual assault. Christine Griffith,
director of the Stanford Rape Re
sponse Group, says the group
hopes to be an advocate for the
victim immediately after the as
sault and later in the process of
recovering from the incident.
"We try to make the survivor
aware of the range of options
there are" within the University
and outside, she says. Counselors
would let the victim know that
reporting the incident to Judicial
Affairs would be one of the avail
able options. "You need to em
power [the victims! as much as
possible, and a good way is to let
them make the decisions."
Despite the group's efforts to
publicize its services, few students
have used its resources.
Nina suggests that all Univer
sity officials dealing with people
who have survived rape should
have formal training similar to
training for members of Griffith's
group. The Mid-Peninsula YWCA,
for example, offers sensitivity
training to the public.
Cole says she does not have a
problem with training, adding
that all people dealing with "dicey
issues" could use such education.
The right place to go?
But Cole says that "as an im
mediate response to a victim's
need for help, the judicial process
is not appropriate." Instead, "the
emergency counselors can lead to
. . . and set groundwork to eval

uate whether the judicial process
is appropriate" for the particular
case.
Lyons also questions whether
all acquaintance rapes should be
reported through Judicial Affairs.
"There is a problem because the
initial need to report may not be
a need to report or redress the
issue judicially but to get advice,"
Lyons says.
He said that in working with
students he has seen a wide range
of reactions, from"I just need to
talk about it with someone" to
"By God, I was sexually assaulted
and I want that person punished."
These are two different questions,
and they need to be addressed
differently, Lyons explains.
Mak says there are many prob
lems with the current set-up of
Judicial Affairs and the way it is
used.
Cole explains that prosecution
is only one of many possible re
sponses to acquaintance rape.
"Prosecutions will follow from
complaints and compelling
evidence. The basic solution to the
problem of sexual assault, how
ever, will not be found through
University or external judicial ac
tions," she says.
University ombudsperson Leah

fairs. "That's something that
comes later, and only if it's be
tween students," and only if the
women have accepted that they
have been raped, she says."It
would be wrong to report it first
to [Judicial Affairsl."
Lyons explains: "The area of
date rape is three to four years
old" as a prominent public issue.
Cases of acquaintance rape may
test the judicial system "in ways
it may not be geared to respond
in because what constitutes date
rape may not be clear."
In cases of acquaintance rape
Lyons says, "We are probably
dealing with the fact that a person
genuinely feels used, hurt, abused.
But does that in and of itself con
stitute date rape?"
Lyons adds: "I suspect those are
emotions we are dealing with. The
