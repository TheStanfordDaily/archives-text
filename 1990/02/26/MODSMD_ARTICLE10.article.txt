# Making a stink about the garbage problem
## Students show not enough waste is being recycled here 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
White Plaza smelled even worse
than usual Friday.
Students stood in the sun for
hours and sorted garbage from
nine different campus locations to
get some idea of just how much
solid waste the University leaves
in its wake â€” and the results
were sobering.
Of 17 pounds of solid waste re
covered from the dumpster be
tween Burbank and Casa Zapata,
15 pounds were recyclable. Of 22
pounds from the Beta Theta Pi
dumpster, 15 were recyclable. Of
33 pounds from Theta Chi, 14
pounds were recyclable. Of 17
pounds from the dumpster be
tween University President
Donald Kennedy's office and the
Political Science Department, two
and a half pounds were recyclable.
The students were sorting the
garbage to gather information for
an environmental audit of Stan
ford. All over the nation, college
students are gathering informa
tion and filling out audits as part
of Earth Day 1990's effort to raise
environmental awareness.
For sophomore Scott Veirs, one
of the garbage sorters, keeping
track of solid waste is nothing
new. He and a friend, freshman
Alex Cronin, have been carrying
on their backs everything they

have not been able to recycle since
the beginning of the quarter.
Veirs' nonrecyclable waste from
the beginning of the quarter
weighs only half a pound. "It is
(so light) because I consume
knowing that whatever I can't
recycle I will have to carry on my
back," Veirs said.
He and Cronin decided to be
come solid waste Atlases when
they were flying back to Stanford

from winter break. They both live
in Colorado and were friends in
high school.
"We had a long debate about
whether we should eat dinner on
the plane that day," Veirs recalled.
"But we did and that's when we
started. We still have the little
plastic cups and containers from
that meal in our bags."
Veirs said he and Cronin com
post leftover food and pay careful

attention to the packaging of prod
ucts they use, making sure they
are recyclable.
Though Veirs' garbage weighs
only a half pound, Cronin is
bearing more weight on his
shoulders. Earlier in the quarter,
Cronin wrecked his bike and was
unable to unbend the metal fork.
He bought a new one, but he ha(s
been carrying a five-pound bike
fork on his back ever since.
