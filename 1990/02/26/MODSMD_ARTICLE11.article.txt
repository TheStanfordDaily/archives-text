Marchers protest one-party rule
MOSCOW (AP) — Despite ominous govern
ment warnings and a high police profile, pro
democracy activists marched by the hundreds
of thousands in more than 30 Soviet cities to
demand an end to one-party Communist rule.
The rallies yesterday, unprecedented in scope
in the Communists' 72-year rule, came a day
after voters in the independence-minded re
public of Lithuania apparently stripped the
Communists of their parliamentary majority.
The day also saw republic-wide elections in
another restive republic — Moldavia.
A series of official warnings last week that
extremists would provoke violence kept the
turnout low in some cities yesterday and
prevented some protests altogether. Riot police
dragged away people who tried to hold an
unsanctioned demonstration in Leningrad, but
there were no reports of major unrest.
"We heard about tanks, about police waiting
with gas and shovels," said a middle-aged
woman who was not deterred from
demonstrating in Moscow along with more
than 100,000 people.
Tokyo stocks take big tumble
TOKYO (AP) — The key index on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange took its second-largest tumble
ever today, representing to many dealers the
beginning of an anticipated collapse of artifi
cially high stock values here.
The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average shed
1,569.10 points, or 4.5 percent, to fall to
33,321.87 at the close of the trading day. This
was the index's second largest decline in points
and the lowest it has fallen since July 5, 1989,
when it closed at 33,309.71 points.
Volume was light at 400 million shares on
the first section.
The market's main index dropped 2,569.35
points, or 6.86 percent, last week, and 4,024.9
points, or 10.34 percent, since the beginning
of the year until today.
In Washington, a U.S. official said last night
that the Treasury Department and Federal
Reserve were monitoring the situation on the
Tokyo stock exchange but that no special ac
tions had been taken by U.S. authorities.
Thousands honor Duarte
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -
Thousands of people chanting "Duarte!
Duarte!" lined the streets yesterday for former
president Jose Napoleon Duarte, who was
buried with honors and eulogized as "the
father of Central American democracy."
Vice President Dan Quayle, Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias, Guatemalan President
Vinicio Cerezo and former Honduran President
Jose Azcona Hoyos attended a Roman Catholic
funeral Mass for Duarte, who died Friday. He
was 64.
Arias and Cerezo were among the pallbearers
for the founder of the Christian Democratic
Party. Party leaders criticized the rightist gov
ernment of President Alfredo Cristiani as "nig
gardly" for not declaring a national day of
mourning.
At least 100,000 people paid their last
respects to the departed former president,
party leaders said.
North Korea scolds U.S.
TOKYO (AP) — North Korea said yesterday
that a U.S. State Department report accusing
it of violating human rights is full of slander
and "whopping lies."
"The U.S. means and method make it pos
sible to impair the high international prestige
of (North Korea) and block worldwide support
and sympathy for its unique socialist system."
said a commentary in he official Communist
Party newspaper Rodong Shinmun.
The commentary, broadcast in part by Pyon
gyang's Korean Central News Agency, moni
tored in Tokyo, followed a U.S. State Depart
ment report last week on human rights around
the world.
