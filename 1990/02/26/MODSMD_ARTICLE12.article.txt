# Chamorro leads in Nicaraguan election

MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) â€”
Early returns in yesterday's elections
showed U.S.-backed opposition candi
date Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
taking a surprising lead over President
Daniel Ortega, and the Sandinistas
canceled a celebration.
The ruling leftists and opposition
had both predicted victory in the heav
ily scrutinized balloting, considered a
referendum on Nicaragua's battered
economy under the Sandinistas and
the U.S.-supported Contra insurgency.
Turnout was heavy in what was con
sidered Nicaragua's freest vote ever,
with people lining up for as much as
four hours to cast ballots and more
3,000 international observers monitor
ing the peaceful election.
The Supreme Electoral Council was
extremely late in reporting votes, and
opposition officials said they believed
the council hadn't expected a Sandi
nista loss and was withholding an
nouncement because it didn't know
what to do. The council had expected
to announce 15 percent of the returns
by 11 p.m. yesterday, but was only
able to announce 5 percent at 2 a.m.
today.
With 244 of 4,394 precincts report
ing, Chamorro was leading by 26,671,
or 51 percent of the votes, to Ortega's
23,016, or 44 percent of the vote, said
council head Mariano Fiallos. It was
unclear from what districts or how
representative the early tallies were.
Neither Chamorro nor Ortega
emerged to declare victory at mid
night, as they had said they would.
A festive mood prevailed at United
National Opposition (UNO) headquar
ters, while at the Sandinista party
headquarters the mood was funereal,
with long faces and few smiles.
UNO officials, on conditions of
anonymity, showed The Associated
Press party tally sheets showing the
coalition with 58 per cent of the vote,
but with only 3 percent counted.
Fiallos attributed the slow count to
local election officials cautiously fol
lowing rules developed to ensure se
curity.
After the polls closed at 6 p.m. (4
p.m. PST), former President Jimmy
Carter, head of one observer group,
called the ballot "very fair." About
1.75 million of Nicaragua's 3.5 million
people were registered to vote.
A "quick poll" showed surprising
strength for Chamorro gave credence
to the possibility of an upset, said I.A.
Lewis, a polling expert for the Los

Angeles Times.
Most pre-election polls said she was
trailing Ortega, but many Nicaraguans
were afraid to reveal their true feelings
outside a truly secret ballot box.
Lewis refused to release any details
or figures of the representative sample
of precincts nationwide.
Voters also selected 90 National As
sembly members and representatives
to 146 regional, city and town councils.
In Washington, President Bush said
whoever won the election would "find
a better climate" with the United
States, as long as the vote was certified
as fair and the government maintained
a democratic system. Fair elections
would be "very, very helpful," Bush
said.
Voters started lining up hours before
the 7 a.m. opening of the polling places,
with hundreds in line at some voting
tables. By mid-afternoon, many voting

stations in Managua were empty and
it looked as if they would not have to
stay open waiting for latecomers.
"We only have 5 percent to go," said
Carla Rodriguez, president of voting
station No. 324, where 465 citizens of
a lower-class Managua neighborhood
cast their ballots.
The lines appeared clearly drawn
for voters: a weak economy was the
Sandinistas' Achilles' heel, and resent
ment of U.S.-supported Contra guer
rillas was hurting UNO.
"If I voted for the Front
(Sandinistas), I'd be voting for things
to be more expensive every day. I'd be
voting to send my kids to military
service," said Ramon Mendoza, a truck
driver from Managua
He credited the Sandinistas for hold
ing a clean election.
"If UNO wins I'll be glad. If the

Front wins I'll go to Costa Rica," said
lan Allen, a resident of the Atlantic
Coast town of Bluefields.
In a poor barrio of western
Managua, Socorro Neira Padilla said
she was definitely for the Sandinistas.
Her daughter had been wounded in
the Contra war.
"I don't want any more war. Imagine
if your beautiful, intelligent, educated
19-year-old daughter was a cripple,"
Padilla said.
Ortega, seeking another six-year
term, cast his ballot early to applause
from fellow voters.
"I expect that the government of
the United States will recognize the
results of the elections and work for
peace with Nicaragua," said the 44-
year-old incumbent, who waged a cam
paign aimed at attracting the substan
tial youth vote.
