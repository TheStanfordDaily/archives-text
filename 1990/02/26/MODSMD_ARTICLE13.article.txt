shuttle weather officer, said wind
gusts at the launch pad reached 30

Cold weather hits East
BOSTON (AP) — Arctic air yes
terday brought an abrupt end to
weeks of unseasonably mild weather
in the Northeast, and roads slippery
with snow created numerous chain
reaction pileups and forced cancella
tion of church services.
"We didn't get January in January,
so we're getting it in late February,"
said Mel Goldstein, director of the
Weather Center at Western Connec
ticut State University in Danbury.
Two days after highs reached the
mid-60s in New York City, Philadel
phia and Boston, yesterday's after

noon readings were only in the low
to mid-20s, with wind gusting to 30
mph in New York.
The National Weather Service said
Boston would chill to zero overnight
with wind making it feel like 35
below.
By last night, 4 inches of snow had
fallen in Boston, the weather service
said. Across Massachusetts, snowfalls
ranged from 4 to 10 inches.
Education goals set
WASHINGTON (AP) - The na

nancial help from a "peace dividend."
"Our aim is excellence in educa

Arkansas, as he offered the goals to
the National Governors' Association
for approval.
