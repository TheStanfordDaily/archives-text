## Break the silence 
### 
University inaction
contributes to many
Webb Ranch problems

Q; UI TACIT CONSENTIT.
I Through silence, consent.
For years, the University
has voiced its silent consent to the
exploitation of Webb Ranch
workers. Nothing has been done
to improve workers' living condi
tions or sub-minimum wages;
nothing has been done to provide
medical coverage for ranch employ
ees.
According to Public Affairs Of
ficer Steven Peeps, the University
has a "non-interference policy"
towards its lessees.
This policy of consent through
silence is both cowardly and des
picable.
What's worse, in sub-contracting
Webb Ranch employees, the Uni
versity has directly perpetuated
the exploitation. Not only were
workers paid only $2.75 out of the
$8 per hour that the University
paid Webb Ranch, employees who
were injured while working at
Stanford received no compensation
because the University is not
legally obligated to provide it.
Additionally, sub-contracted
Webb Ranch employees were used
to do jobs that United Stanford
Workers members "did not wish
to do," such as pulling weeds from
a wet ditch.
It is unacceptable for the Uni
versity to use Webb Ranch workers
for their dirty work.
As a major peninsula landowner,
and as a nationally influential in
stitution that purports to embrace
progressive ideals, the University
has a moral obligation to ensure
that human rights are not ex
ploited — especially on Stanford's

own property.
Tha Daily reported Webb
Ranch's minimum wage violations
over a year ago. Yet the University
continues its "see no evil, hear no
evil" policy.
It's time to look the human
rights violations in the face.
The four-year Webb Ranch lease
ran out last August, and the Uni
versity is leasing its property to
the Webb family on a month-by
month basis.
Presently, the ranch owners are
renting their 238 acres during a
"holding-over" period while their
lease is renegotiated. This period
represents a good opportunity for
the University to make a stand on
the issue of human rights and to
"interfere" when those rights have
been disregarded for so long.
That interference doesn't neces
sarily mean shutting down the
Webb Ranch. While such a drastic
step might end exploitation, it
would also put these same workers
out of their jobs, compounding
their problems.
A more immediate first step
would be for the University to ad
mit that the current situation is
intolerable.
The University, specifically the
Athletic Department, can also stop
hiring ranch workers.
Aside from speaking out against
practices that violate human
rights, the University can set up
sanctions against ranch owners if
the exploitation continues.
University President Kennedy
missed the point when he said
"Stanford actually cannot deter
mine the employment practices of
all those contractors and lessees
and then impose higher standards
than are required by law."
It's time for the University to
insist that workers are treated
with the dignity and respect that
all human beings deserve.
It's time to end the silence.
