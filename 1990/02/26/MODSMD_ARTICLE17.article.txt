Allegations prey on stereotypes of Asian-Americans

WHAT DOES IT take to build
multiculturalism at Stanford?
We in the Stanford commu
nity seek to build a community where
all people can be understood and
respected. As members of the Asian-
American community, we are commit
ted to this vision and sickened by the
attempts of The Stanford Review and
some of its writers to thwart the
process of the entire Stanford commu
nity.
The efforts to establish Asian-
American studies exemplify the diffi
culties encountered by those who strive
for progressive change. First, there was
the 19-year-long struggle that took
place before Ewart Thomas, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, created an
Asian-American studies faculty billet.
The first "candidate," Victor Nee,
appeared for interviews and then with
drew himself at the beginning of the

first open presentation.
Then John Bunzel of the Hoover
Institution raised sensationalist
speculations, implying a "cover-up" of
Nee's views on Asian-American studies,
even though all presentations were
open to the public and covered by
several Daily articles.
On the very same day, Daryl Josef
fer and the editiors of The Stanford
Review played upon the infamous
stereotype of Asians as sneaky, secre
tive subversives attempting to overrun
the country. The Review featured a
story accompanied by the Enquirer
type headline: "Gordan (sic) Chang
Connected to Maoist Cult." This was
followed by another article on Chang
in the Feb. 20 issue of The Review,
arguing that a faculty member's politi
cal and "religious" views are a direct
indication of the competency to teach
and research.
We want to call on the entire Stan-

ford community to review its support
for Asian-American studies, not letting
illegitimate attacks deter us from our
goals of building multiculturalism. We
are in desperate need of Asian-
American studies. In fact, The Review
is the clearest example of why Asian-
American studies and ethnic studies in
general are needed.
If Daryl JosefTer, the author of the
Enquirer-esque article about Gordon
Chang, enrolled in any Asian-American
studies courses or attended any of the
presentations by the candidates, he
would learn how, historically, paranoid
accusations of treachery justified racist
attacks on Asian-Americans.
The United States government ra
tionalized the internment of 120,000
Japanese-Americans during World War
II by portraying all of them, regardless
of citizenship or age, as members of
the "Fifth Column." No evidence ex
isted for such claims.

Dangerously paralleling the historical
attacks on Asians, JosefTer exploits
anti-Asian stereotypes to discredit a
nationally-renowned China expert. The
Review typecasts Chang as a sneaky,
secretive cult figure, a "subversive,"
and therefore incompetent to be a
professor at Stanford. They completely
disregard his prestigious academic
career and teaching experience.
The journalism of The Review fails
to contribute constructively to the
discussion concerning the development
of Asian-American studies. In fact, it
obstructs rational, constructive debate,
which will and should continue.
