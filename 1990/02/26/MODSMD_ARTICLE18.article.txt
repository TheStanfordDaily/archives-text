# University needs moral leadership on Webb Ranch lease
## 
### 
The time has arrived for the Univer
sity to terminate Webb Ranch's lease.
For far too long the University has
ignored the exploitation Webb Ranch
workers have experienced, as reported
in the Feb. 21 Daily.
The University has maintained that
it does not have a legal obligation to
ensure that the employees of lessees
are not being exploited. The University
contends that it should not interfere
with labor negotiations between lessees
and their employees, such as Macy's
and Webb Ranch. However, Macy's
employees do not make $2.75 per hour,
nor do they sleep in dilapidated shacks.

Webb Ranch workers do.
As reported in The Daily, the
Federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration and the San
Mateo County Environmental Health
Department found 89 violations of
safety regulations at Webb Ranch in
the past year. Most recently, Webb
Ranch has violated rent and utility
deduction laws and failed to provide
medical and health benefits.
Webb Ranch has remained dead
locked with the United Stanford
Workers in reaching an agreement that
would give Webb workers equal access
to the salaries and benefits that
University-employed workers currently
receive.
Essentially, the University has tried
to maintain a legal position with Webb
Ranch when it should be taking a
moral position. The University policy
regarding its lessees essentially says

family to grant their workers the
salaries and benefits they deserve.
that employers can do anything they
want on Stanford land so long as the
rent is paid on time. Such a position
only perpetuates the problems at Webb
Ranch and fails to move the Webb
