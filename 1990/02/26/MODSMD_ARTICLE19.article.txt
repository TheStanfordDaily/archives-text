# Lecturer's efforts and contributions will be missed
## 
### 
We, the undersigned, wish to express
our admiration and appreciation for
Senior Lecturer in Biological Sciences
Ellen Porzig's outstanding contribution
to undergraduate education. We regret

that she will leave the Department of
Biological Sciences at the end of this
quarter and will be unable to teach
Vertebrate Biology (Biology 110) this
spring quarter. We stand by her every
decision in this situation and wish her
the very best in all her future en
deavors. We thank Porzig for her un
failing dedication to helping all her
students achieve their goals while at
Stanford and beyond. Her irreplaceable
efforts and presence will be greatly
missed by Stanford.
