DESPITE THE PACKED house at
Memorial Auditorium Feb. 19, ap
parently not everyone on Stan
ford's campus was eager to hear Rosa
Parks speak — or appreciative of her
refusal to move to the back of the bus
in Montgomery, Ala., a quarter century
ago.
"She sat on her ass when politely asked
to obey a rule."
Not exactly the traditional interpreta
tion for Parks' weary protest of segre
gation and racism in the United States,
but someone had nad enough of Black
History Month or Parks to scrawl these
words on a poster promoting Parks'
speech. I saw this particular poster —
otherwise no different from the many
others sprinkled throughout campus —
plastered on one of the cement supports
for the covered walkway between the post
office and the Bookstore when I walked
by Wednesday morning.
The racist implications of the words
and their context are hard to miss. I even
checked this one with a friend I would
have labeled a conservative before I read
Alex Grant's last column.
We at Stanford — particularly we at
Stanford who are not black — must take
the responsibility for creating or main
taining an atmosphere in which someone
feels safe enough to deface a poster in a
well-traveled campus thoroughfare.
Somehow, I doubt that this local racist
crept in under a cover of darkness, flash
light in hand, to scrawl his message in
ballpoint pen on one of many posters in
the area. Besides, anyone who was around
during Gay and Lesbian Awareness Week

last year knows that some Stanford folks
are perfectly capable of widespread cam
paigns of terror against oppressed groups
when they have that in mind.
And I must take tha responsibility for
my hesitancy in responding to the poster.
I read it, shook my head and kept walking.
Letters to mail. My own sense of decorum
kept me from tearing it down. When I
returned later in the day, all the Rosa
Parks posters were gone.
I can't help wondering why someone
didn't see the poster being defaced. And
if someone did see him, why didn't they
stop him? Letters to mail? I guess it
would have been rude to intrude.
Which reminds me that our anonymous
racist is displeased by Rosa Parks' aban
doning her manners. Hey, as long as the
bus driver didn't yell.
Well, it's not exactly like Emily Post
has a set of rules for discrimination.
When someone at the dinner table politely
asks you to pass the salt, you pass the
salt. When someone in the library politely
asks you to keep quiet, you shut up. But
there's nothing polite about racism, even
if you say please.
"Polite" is not a self-defining word.
Behavior must be evaluated in context.
Politeness can be just as coercive as
rudeness — or violence. After all, in the
context of the stigmatic injury caused by
racism, would it really have made a dif
ference whether the bus driver asked
Rosa Parks to move, yelled for her to
move or threw her to the back of the
bus?
Politeness can be calculated to pre

empt dissent. After all, it's hard to chal
lenge the policies at an institution that
has let you in, that has let you sup at
its table.
Politeness can be part of a strategy for
systemic oppression. After all, what has
men opening doors for women done for
sexism?
Politeness can co-opt. To loosely para
phrase Law Prof. Mari Matsuda, you
don't want to be going for afternoon tea
with someone if you end up accompanying
him to Auschwitz.
Of course, it is an appealing quality of
humanity, of the potential for human
connection, that we ought to be able to
go for afternoon tea and explain why
Auschwitz isn't such a prime destination.
We even ought to be able to go for tea
with those with whom we have funda
mental disagreements over issues more
important than who's most at fault in
the Trump divorce. (It's Donald, by the
way).
So, if you see someone playing with
Rosa Parks posters — or Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week posters — introduce
yourself, have a chat.
Please.
