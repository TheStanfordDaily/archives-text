## All must work together on progressive agenda 
### 
THE LAST TWO segments of
"Eyes on the Prize" (airing
tonight and next Monday) should
make all viewers pause and reflect on
the past, present and future place of
African-Americans in this country.
What those two hours of footage will
show is that the children of Africa on
this continent have redefined the word
American.
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Taylor
Branch remarked in his speech here
that race "issues have been at the
heart of American history from the
very beginning." From the debate over
the drafting of the Declaration of
Independence through the Civil War to
the modern Civil Rights movement, the
African-American current has been at
the center of America's river of history.
The final segment of "Eyes" will
show highlights from the entire 14-part
series. What comes through most
clearly in this visual walk through
history is that the African-American
freedom struggle has propelled the
nation forward, often against its will,
toward true democracy, justice and
equality.
When Rosa Parks refused to go to
the back of the bus, she opened up
public transportation to everybody, not
just blacks. Albert Turner and John
Lewis led the Selma-to-Montgomery

march not just to demand the right to
vote for blacks, but for democratic
participation for Americans of all colors
and every background.
Tonight's program, "Keys to the
Kingdom" looks at busing in Boston
and the Allen Bakke "reverse discrimi
nation" case in California and shows
the fear, insecurity, and hostility that
produced a vicious white backlash to
the African-American agenda. While a
certain amount of insecurity about an
unknown future is justified, white
Americans really have nothing to fear
from the black freedom struggle.
African-American mobs have never
lynched whites. We have never chased
whites to their deaths on the freeways
of Howard Beach, and we don't shoot
white youths who ask us for $5 on a
New York subway.
If we are to survive as "one nation
under God" into the 21st century, then
the entire country must embrace the
vision and goals of the African-
American freedom struggle and ir
revocably redefine what we mean when
we say, "America." The new America
must make room in the pantheon of
heroes for such people as Frederick
Douglass, Ida B. Wells, W.E.B. Dußois,
and Fannie Lou Hamer.
The America of the future will give
Oscars to movies such as "The Color

Purple" and "Do The Right Thing."
George Michael, Madonna, and New
Kids on the Block are proof that
America already understands the
vitality of black music.
Colleges and universities in the new
America will insist that their students
study the African origins of world
civilization. Reconstruction and the
Civil Rights movement will be required
courses of study, and no one will be
considered "educated" until they have
studied the Black Panther Party.
To make this new nation a reality,
African-Americans face a significant
historical challenge. We must redefine
African-American and develop a mature
political strategy to make America
what it must become.
Many of us, myself included, are
sometimes guilty of adopting a
"blacker-than-thou" attitude. We tend
to judge our brothers and sisters by
how they talk and how they walk
instead of what they say and where
they're going.
The fact of the matter is that
African-Americans have developed in
America, and it would be foolish to
deny that influence on us. I am confi
dent that the thesis of black freedom
and the antithesis of ruling-class white
oppression can yet yield a creative

synthesis of rainbow democracy and
equality.
With that synthesis, we can bring
together classical music and jazz (as
Wynton Marsalis has done). We can
read Henry David Thoreau's "Civil
Disobedience" and David Walker's
"Appeal." We can honor John Brown
and Nat Turner. With the strength of
this new synthesis, we will do away
with English departments (after all,
George Washington won the war) and
create departments of American Litera
ture.
To bring these changes about will
require a higher level of political
maturity on all sides. Whites must
shed their fear of change and actively
support the black freedom struggle,
and African-Americans must act with a
maturity commensurate with our his
torical mission.
Political maturity means reaching
out to everyone who has the desire to
contribute to the movement. We are
not doing so well that we can afford to
do without the talents and energy of
our brothers and sisters who are down
for black liberation but might happen
to listen to classical music or read
19th-century literature.
Neither can we afford to do without
allies. Even in South Africa, where
blacks outnumber whites 5-to-l, Nelson

Mandela is reaching out to the white
citizens and government leaders be
cause it is both strategically sound and
morally right. Surely, here at Stanford,
we can work with President Kennedy,
white students, and other students of
color who share our vision of democra
cy, justice and equality.
I am confident that an inclusive,
mature movement will produce a new
society. Once we redefine our nation,
perhaps we can reassign the national
anthem. I vote for the theme to "Eyes
On the Prize" — "I know one thing I
did right was the day I started to
fight. Keep your eyes on the prize.
Hold on."
The prize is nearer than you think.
Hold on.

together classical music and jazz (as
Wynton Marsalis has done). We can
read Henry David Thoreau's "Civil
Disobedience" and David Walker's
"Appeal." We can honor John Brown
and Nat Turner. With the strength of
this new synthesis, we will do away
with English departments (after all,
George Washington won the war) and
create departments of American Litera
ture.
To bring these changes about will
require a higher level of political
maturity on all sides. Whites must
shed their fear of change and actively
support the black freedom struggle,
and African-Americans must act with a
maturity commensurate with our his
torical mission.
Political maturity means reaching
out to everyone who has the desire to
contribute to the movement. We are
not doing so well that we can afford to
do without the talents and energy of
our brothers and sisters who are down
for black liberation but might happen
to listen to classical music or read
19th-century literature.
Neither can we afford to do without
allies. Even in South Africa, where
blacks outnumber whites 5-to-l, Nelson

Mandela is reaching out to the white
citizens and government leaders be
cause it is both strategically sound and
morally right. Surely, here at Stanford,
we can work with President Kennedy,
white students, and other students of
color who share our vision of democra
cy, justice and equality.
I am confident that an inclusive,
mature movement will produce a new
society. Once we redefine our nation,
perhaps we can reassign the national
anthem. I vote for the theme to "Eyes
On the Prize" — "I know one thing I
did right was the day I started to
fight. Keep your eyes on the prize.
Hold on."
The prize is nearer than you think.
Hold on.

Black History
THE LAST TWO segments of
"Eyes on the Prize" (airing
tonight and next Monday) should
make all viewers pause and reflect on
the past, present and future place of
African-Americans in this country.
What those two hours of footage will
show is that the children of Africa on
this continent have redefined the word
American.
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Taylor
Branch remarked in his speech here
that race "issues have been at the
heart of American history from the
very beginning." From the debate over
the drafting of the Declaration of
Independence through the Civil War to
the modern Civil Rights movement, the
African-American current has been at
the center of America's river of history.
The final segment of "Eyes" will
show highlights from the entire 14-part
series. What comes through most
clearly in this visual walk through
history is that the African-American
freedom struggle has propelled the
nation forward, often against its will,
toward true democracy, justice and
equality.
When Rosa Parks refused to go to
the back of the bus, she opened up
public transportation to everybody, not
just blacks. Albert Turner and John
Lewis led the Selma-to-Montgomery

march not just to demand the right to
vote for blacks, but for democratic
participation for Americans of all colors
and every background.
Tonight's program, "Keys to the
Kingdom" looks at busing in Boston
and the Allen Bakke "reverse discrimi
nation" case in California and shows
the fear, insecurity, and hostility that
produced a vicious white backlash to
the African-American agenda. While a
certain amount of insecurity about an
unknown future is justified, white
Americans really have nothing to fear
from the black freedom struggle.
African-American mobs have never
lynched whites. We have never chased
whites to their deaths on the freeways
of Howard Beach, and we don't shoot
white youths who ask us for $5 on a
New York subway.
If we are to survive as "one nation
under God" into the 21st century, then
the entire country must embrace the
vision and goals of the African-
American freedom struggle and ir
revocably redefine what we mean when
we say, "America." The new America
must make room in the pantheon of
heroes for such people as Frederick
Douglass, Ida B. Wells, W.E.B. Dußois,
and Fannie Lou Hamer.
The America of the future will give
Oscars to movies such as "The Color

Purple" and "Do The Right Thing."
George Michael, Madonna, and New
Kids on the Block are proof that
America already understands the
vitality of black music.
Colleges and universities in the new
America will insist that their students
study the African origins of world
civilization. Reconstruction and the
Civil Rights movement will be required
courses of study, and no one will be
considered "educated" until they have
studied the Black Panther Party.
To make this new nation a reality,
African-Americans face a significant
historical challenge. We must redefine
African-American and develop a mature
political strategy to make America
what it must become.
Many of us, myself included, are
sometimes guilty of adopting a
"blacker-than-thou" attitude. We tend
to judge our brothers and sisters by
how they talk and how they walk
instead of what they say and where
they're going.
The fact of the matter is that
African-Americans have developed in
America, and it would be foolish to
deny that influence on us. I am confi
dent that the thesis of black freedom
and the antithesis of ruling-class white
oppression can yet yield a creative

synthesis of rainbow democracy and
equality.
With that synthesis, we can bring
together classical music and jazz (as
Wynton Marsalis has done). We can
read Henry David Thoreau's "Civil
Disobedience" and David Walker's
"Appeal." We can honor John Brown
and Nat Turner. With the strength of
