## No looking back: Women cruise to Pac-10 title 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
MONTEREY PARK, Calif. - After
watching Stanford win the first three
Pacific 10 Conference Women's Swim
ming Championships, the other schools
in the league expected Stanford wouid
be tough to beat this year.
Now, after watching three Cardinal
freshmen combine to win eight events at
this year's meet, the other schools' ex
pectations for the next three years are
probably pretty low too.
Led by freshmen triple winners Janet
Evans and Janel Jorgensen, Stanford
scored 1717 points to handily defeat
runner-up California. The fourth-ranked
Golden Bears were second with 1238
points and No. 7 UCLA was third with
1143. The meet ran Friday through yes
terday at the East Los Angeles College
pool.
"We didn't swim exceptionally well,"

Conference Championships

Stanford Coach Richard Quick said,
"(but) we're good enough to use this meet
as a place to know where we are for our
final preparation for NCAAs. For the
most part we need a good deal of rest
and some quality work to sharpen up."
In addition to bringing home a trophy
and getting ready for the NCAA Cham
pionships, which are March 15-17, Quick
wanted to get three more swimmers qual
ified for the NCAA meet. A team can
bring only 17 swimmers to the meet, and
after three people qualified this weekend,
the Cardinal is up to that maximum.
Yesterday morning freshman Anne Ma
honey posted a qualifying time in the
100-yard backstroke in the preliminaries.
That night sophomore Susan Johnson

met the qualifying time in the 100 breast
stroke.
Sunday morning Jody Smith also qual
ified. After coming very close to qualify
ing many times over the weekend, Smith
was timed a full second under the stand
ard in the 200 backstroke.
Senior diver Katie Connors also qual
ified for the NCAA meet by winning both
the one-meter and the three-meter diving
competitions. She also placed third in the
platform. Sophomore Melisa Kuller
finished fourth in the one-meter, third
in the three-meter and fourth in the plat
form while sophomore Kristin Jensen
placed ninth in the one-meter, fourth in
the three-meter and second in the plat
form.
"I'm extremely pleased about that,"
Quick said. "I'm very excited for Jody
Smith, Susan Johnson and Anne Ma
honey and I'm very pleased with our
divers — Katie qualified on both boards."
Stanford got out to a big lead the first

day as Evans won the 500 freestyle, with
Karen Kraemer third and Smith fourth.
Jorgensen won the next event, the 200
individual medley, as eight Stanford
swimmers placed in the top 13.
Stanford opened the second day by win
ning the 200 medley relay in meet-record
time. Evans then set a meet record herself
in winning the 400 IM, and Jorgensen
won the 100 butterfly.
Another freshman, Lori Heisick, won
the 100 breaststroke next after setting a
meet record in the morning's qualifying
session and the Cardinal also won the
800 freestyle relay.
Evans opened yesterday's session by
winning the 1650 freestyle. Evans
finished in 15 minutes, 53.77 seconds,
setting a new meet, Pac-10 and Stanford
school record. She lapped the entire field
in the 25-yard pool and missed the NCAA
record by less than three seconds.
"I'm happy with my swimming," she
said. "I think it got better as the meet

went 0n.... I think we're in good standing
for NCAAs."
Senior Susannah Miller ended her final
Pac-10 meet by winning the 200 back
stroke and teammates Smith and Dede
Trimble took second and third.
Twenty minutes later the Cardinal
went one-two-three in the 200 breast
stroke. Heisick won the event and senior
Jill Johnson and senior Bethanne Lam
bert were right behind her.
"It was hard," Heisick said of the meet.
"We were really excited going in but I
think all of us struggled a little bit be
cause we're still working hard."
Unlike the other teams, who rested
most of their swimmers, the 14 Stanford
swimmers who had already qualified for
the NCAA meet are still in the middle
of training for NCAAs.
Jorgensen then won the 200 butterfly
by nearly three seconds and Stanford
closed out the meet with a second-place
finish in the 400 freestyle relay.

"It was hard," Heisick said of the meet.
"We were really excited going in but I
think all of us struggled a little bit be
cause we're still working hard."

most of their swimmers, the 14 Stanford

the NCAA meet are still in the middle

MONTEREY PARK, Calif. - After
watching Stanford win the first three
Pacific 10 Conference Women's Swim
ming Championships, the other schools
in the league expected Stanford wouid
be tough to beat this year.
Now, after watching three Cardinal
freshmen combine to win eight events at
this year's meet, the other schools' ex
pectations for the next three years are
probably pretty low too.
Led by freshmen triple winners Janet
Evans and Janel Jorgensen, Stanford
scored 1717 points to handily defeat
runner-up California. The fourth-ranked
Golden Bears were second with 1238
points and No. 7 UCLA was third with
1143. The meet ran Friday through yes
terday at the East Los Angeles College
pool.
"We didn't swim exceptionally well,"

Cardinal wins Pacific 10

Conference Championships

Stanford Coach Richard Quick said,
"(but) we're good enough to use this meet
as a place to know where we are for our
final preparation for NCAAs. For the
most part we need a good deal of rest
and some quality work to sharpen up."
In addition to bringing home a trophy
and getting ready for the NCAA Cham
pionships, which are March 15-17, Quick
wanted to get three more swimmers qual
ified for the NCAA meet. A team can
bring only 17 swimmers to the meet, and
after three people qualified this weekend,
the Cardinal is up to that maximum.
Yesterday morning freshman Anne Ma
honey posted a qualifying time in the
100-yard backstroke in the preliminaries.
That night sophomore Susan Johnson

met the qualifying time in the 100 breast
stroke.
Sunday morning Jody Smith also qual
ified. After coming very close to qualify
ing many times over the weekend, Smith
was timed a full second under the stand
ard in the 200 backstroke.
Senior diver Katie Connors also qual
ified for the NCAA meet by winning both
the one-meter and the three-meter diving
competitions. She also placed third in the
platform. Sophomore Melisa Kuller
finished fourth in the one-meter, third
in the three-meter and fourth in the plat
form while sophomore Kristin Jensen
placed ninth in the one-meter, fourth in
the three-meter and second in the plat
form.
"I'm extremely pleased about that,"
Quick said. "I'm very excited for Jody
Smith, Susan Johnson and Anne Ma
honey and I'm very pleased with our
divers — Katie qualified on both boards."
Stanford got out to a big lead the first

day as Evans won the 500 freestyle, with
Karen Kraemer third and Smith fourth.
Jorgensen won the next event, the 200
individual medley, as eight Stanford
swimmers placed in the top 13.
Stanford opened the second day by win
ning the 200 medley relay in meet-record
time. Evans then set a meet record herself
in winning the 400 IM, and Jorgensen
won the 100 butterfly.
Another freshman, Lori Heisick, won
the 100 breaststroke next after setting a
meet record in the morning's qualifying
session and the Cardinal also won the
800 freestyle relay.
Evans opened yesterday's session by
winning the 1650 freestyle. Evans
finished in 15 minutes, 53.77 seconds,
setting a new meet, Pac-10 and Stanford
school record. She lapped the entire field
in the 25-yard pool and missed the NCAA
record by less than three seconds.
"I'm happy with my swimming," she
said. "I think it got better as the meet

went 0n.... I think we're in good standing
for NCAAs."
Senior Susannah Miller ended her final
Pac-10 meet by winning the 200 back
stroke and teammates Smith and Dede
Trimble took second and third.
Twenty minutes later the Cardinal
went one-two-three in the 200 breast
stroke. Heisick won the event and senior
Jill Johnson and senior Bethanne Lam
bert were right behind her.
"It was hard," Heisick said of the meet.
"We were really excited going in but I
think all of us struggled a little bit be
