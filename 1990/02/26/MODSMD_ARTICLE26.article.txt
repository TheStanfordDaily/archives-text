# Hoopsters rebound with ASU win
## Men don't let loss to Wildcats at home get them down 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
For five years, they came into
Maples with more talent and left
without a win. Until Friday night,
though, the Arizona Wildcats
never brought with them as many
mighty oak trees to a campus
known for its gentle palms.

The end result was a physical
battle in which the Arizona big
men used 12 of their allotted 15
fouls and routed the Cardinal 80-
61 before a sellout crowd of 7,500
in Maples Pavilion.
It was Stanford's worst home
loss since a 93-62 pasting by
UCLA on Feb. 6, 1987. But the
Cardinal rebounded yesterday to

score a 57-44 decision over Ari
zona State and is now 16-9 on
the season, 8-8 in Pacific 10 Con
ference play.
The Wildcats are 18-6 (after
losing at Duke Sunday), 12-3 in
the Pac-10. The Sun Devils fell to
12-13, 6-11.
"There's no mystery. We got
beat by a better basketball team,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said after the Arizona
game. "They're the best team in
the league right now. I'm not sure
they're not better now than they
were the last couple of years."
Maybe so, but Arizona forward
Jud Buechler offered his own ex
planation of why this Wildcat
team accomplished something
previous ones have failed to do.
"Last year and the year before,
we gave the crowd a reason to
cheer early on. This time from
the get go,, we got after 'em."
Though the Wildcats played
strong in the early going, Stanford
did manage to keep things close
early on. When Andrew Vlahov
and Deshon Wingate connected on
one of their patented alley-oop
plays 12 minutes, 29 seconds into
the game, the Cardinal tied Ari
zona at 21-21.
Stanford's possession of the mo
mentum was ephemeral. Arizona
went on a 13-0 run keyed by three
pointers from Beuchler and Matt
Meuhlebach. The Wildcats' 6-foot
-2 guard played 38 minutes of
nearly flawless basketball as he
connected on 8 of 10 shots for a
career-high 22 points and did not
commit a turnover.
"We tried very hard to recruit
Muehlebach," Montgomery said.
"But I had no idea he'd be this
good."
With Muehlebach holding down
the fort on the perimeter, the
Wildcats troika of 6-11 post
players — Brian Williams, Ed
Stokes and Sean Rooks — wore
out the Cardinal down low. "They
killed us inside. We weren't big
enough," said Vlahov, who at 6-7,
225 pounds isn't exactly Tiny
Tim.
"They can keep bringing people
and bringing people," said Adam
Keefe, whose 23 points led the
Cardinal. "You can see for your

self: Williams, Rooks, Stokes and
(Wayne) Womack; four, four, four
and two fouls."
"I'm overmatched," added the
6-9 Keefe. "Vlahov, he's shorter
than I am. He's overmatched. We
were beaten ... flogged."
At halftime, Arizona led 38-28
and could have become a bit com
placent. Muehlebach said the team
realized that and made sure it did
not happen. "The last two years,
we've gone into the locker room
with 10 point leads (and lost)."
Muehlebach did more than his
part in guaranteeing the Maples
losing streak did not reach six.
He made two free throws to open
the half, got out on the break for
two layups, hit a jumper and com
pleted a three-point play all within
the first five minutes of the sec
ond stanza.
Arizona outscored Stanford 16-
2 over that stretch with Mueh
lebach accounting for 10 of the
Wildcats' points. The Cardinal

trailed 54-31 at that point and
the game was essentially over.
"I hardly know how to react. . .
to come in here and talk about a
win," Arizona Coach Lute Olson
said. "Our play was good and con
sistent throughout.
"We've been shooting the bas
ketball well," Olson added. On the
night, the Wildcats hit on 57 per
cent of their attempts while hold
ing the Cardinal to just 41 per
cent.
"Our players were telling the
seniors this was one they were
going to get for them," Olson said.
Foremost among those seniors is
Buechler, who has a chance at
making the NBA next year. The
6-6 do-everything forward scored
16 points on 7-of-10 shooting. He
hit a pair of threes and led the
team in rebounds (8) and assists
(6).
Yesterday's game with the Sun
Devils might have made the 4,500
in attendance forget there was a

shot clock. Montgomery called it
"good ol' slug-em-out basketball."
In the first half, though, it was
just pretty boring. Both teams
shot under 40 percent as Stanford
took a 22-16 lead into the locker
room. Keefe hit on only 1 of 6
shots from the field in the opening
20 minutes.
"I just tried to keep a good at
titude about it,"he said. "Days
like that happen. I'm glad it hap
pened against Arizona State here
at home when we still had a
chance to win."
Keefe said fatigue from Friday's
physical battle affected him. He
said he was "not able to get up
off the ground" as well as he is
normally
Still, Keefe came back with a
strong second half and the Car
dinal frontcourt eventually proved
to be too much for Arizona State.

side of an 80-61 final.
