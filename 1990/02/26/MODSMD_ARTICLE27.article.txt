# Smoking Wildcat guns control Maples contest

### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
The Arizona basketball team
has a lot of talent. That much
was certain before the season
began. Over the last few weeks,
the Wildcats have shown that
when several of their talents
assert themselves at once,
games can change very quickly.
Friday night, the game with
Stanford changed very quickly
— as in eight unanswered
points by Arizona in under a
minute. That explosion was
part of a 13-0 Wildcat run late
in the first half.
Arizona then came out of
halftime with a 6-0 burst on
fastbreak buckets and went on
to score 15 of the first 18 points
of the second half. The game
was effectively out of reach for
the Cardinal.
The rest of the game — the
part when the Wildcats weren't
on a rampage, shooting the
lights out and scoring every
few seconds — was fairly even.
But for those two stretches,
Arizona was just on fire. For
the game, the Wildcats shot
56.8 percent from the field.
"We're shooting the basket
ball very well over the last
three weeks," Arizona Coach
Lute Olson said. "We're prob
ably shooting near or over 60
percent in our last eight to ten
games."
Arizona won here for the
first time in five years. Wildcat
forward Jud Buechler, who is
leading the team in scoring and
rebounding, saw a new inten
sity from his squad this year.
"From the get-go, we just got
after 'em," he said.

Buechler is just one of the
weapons that the balanced
Wildcats have been going to in
the last couple of weeks. With
so much talent and depth,
someone is going to have the
hot hand on any given night.
Muehlebach had been
averaging 10.1 points before
the games at California and
Stanford. Against the Golden
Bears, Muehlebach hit for 20
points on 7-for-ll shooting,- in
cluding 6 out of 8 on three
pointers.
Muehlebach riddled the Car
dinal for 22 points, with 8-of-10
marksmanship overall, going 2-
for-4 from behind the three
point stripe.
After the game, Olson called
Muehlebach the second best
guard in the conference.
"I dare you to look at the
stats, and look at defense, and
assists-to-turnovers ratio," Ol
son said, "and other than
[Oregon State's! Gary Payton,
I don't think you'll find a more
efficient guard in the league."
Muehlebach, like the whole
Wildcat team, has found his
rhythm lately. "Once you get
that rhythm," Muehlebach
said, "... you feel good, every
thing's going right."
Muehlebach hails from the
Bay area, and was recruited by
Stanford. Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery now regrets not
pursuing him more fervently.
"I had no idea he'd be this
good," Montgomery said. "He's
a great, confident, all-around
player.
But now Muehlebach is just
one horse in the Arizona stable
of talent. Friday, it was his
night to run the court.
