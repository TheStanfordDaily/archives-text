# Card takes play to another level
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Coach Tara VanDerveer was
worried a few weeks ago. She was
not certain whether her team
would "take off' and bring its
game to a higher level for the
stretch run.
She need not worry any longer.
Saturday night, the Cardinal
women blasted into orbit as they
broke the century mark for the
second straight game in a 113-70
thrashing of Arizona in Tucson.

Cardinal 113

Wildcats 70

In matching their highest scor
ing output of the season (set
against Ohio University in De
cember), Stanford moved to 24-1,
14-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play.
The Wildcats dropped to 10-15,
3-11.
"I'm always going to find some
things (to complain about)," Van-
Derveer said after a nearly flaw
less performance by the Cardinal.
Asked about the takeoff, VanDer
veer replied: "We're going down

the runway."
Arizona jumped ahead 10-4
before the Cardinal came to life.
Trisha Stevens scored 13 of Stan
ford's first 20 points during a 27-6
run. A Val Whiting turnaround
jumper capped the scoring binge
and made it 31-16 Cardinal.
Julie Zeilstra scored eight
points with under four minutes
remaining in the first half to help
Stanford move out to a 23-point
halftime lead. Zeilstra scored on
three consecutive possessions for
the Cardinal as the team moved
ahead 42-25. Stanford then got a
Whiting jumper, a Jennifer Azzi
free throw and another hoop from
Zeilstra to complete a 7-0 run that
pushed the lead to 22.
Brenda Frese ended the Wildcat
drought with a basket, pulling her
team with 47-27. But Katy
Steding hit a three-pointer as time
expired. Stanford took a 50-27 ad
vantage into the locker room and
never looked back.
Stevens, who finished with a
game-high 21 points, paced a
balanced Cardinal attack. "Trisha
has 20 points and she's barely
playing half the game," VanDer
veer said. "When she gets the ball

she just goes and scores. She's a
machine."
Stanford shot 56 percent from
the field in the half while holding
Arizona to 30 percent. But, the
Cardinal's domination of the game
was not just in the field goal per
centage department.
Sorya Henning had six steals in
the game, including two she took
coast-to-coast for layups. Whiting
finished with 19 points on 8-of-ll
shooting and also recorded three
blocks. Steding (16 points on 6 of
8 from the field) and Stevens (10-
of-15) also shot exceptionally well.
"Soi\ja had a really good week
end," VanDerveer said. "She was
pushing the tempo. I like the fact
[the score] reflects that we're run
ning .. . we're not content to play
slowdown."
Despite being held to eight
points, Azzi helped key the Car
dinal attack with 11 assists. Frese
led the Wildcats with 15. Team
mate Timi Brown was Arizona's
only other double-figure scorer at
10 points.
The Wildcats showed full-court
pressure throughout the opening
20 minutes and stuck with it in

the second half despite getting
burned by the Stanford offense.
As a result, an up-tempo game
shifted into a higher gear and the
Cardinal quickly buried any no
tions of an Arizona comeback in
the second stanza.
Stanford opened the half with
a 13-2 run over a four-minute
stretch, pushing the Cardinal's
edge to 63-29. Several possessions
later, the scoring began lighting
up like a pinall machine as Ari
zona matched Stanford basket for
basket.
When things finally calmed
down at the 10:22 mark, though,
Arizona found itself trailing 86-50
— no closer than when the scoring
barrage began.

The only remaining drama was
waiting for Stanford to score its
100 th point. Whiting provided the
climax with a spin move in the
low block at the 5:15 mark. Stan
ford led 100-62 and outscored the
Wildcats 13-8 the rest of the way.
VanDerveer was especially
pleased with the play of reserves
Stacy Parson, Martha Richards
and Molly Goodenbour. "We got
a lot of help coming off the bench,"
she said. "Stacy has been playing
great."
Card notes
Hardly a day goes by without a
milestone for the Cardinal, and Sat

points gave her a total of 1,146 for
her career. During the game, she

Anderson (1,143) to move into eighth
place on the all-time Stanford scoring
