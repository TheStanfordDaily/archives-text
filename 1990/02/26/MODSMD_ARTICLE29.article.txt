# Weather outshines Card's play

LOS ANGELES - On a
picture-postcard weekend in
Southern California, life turned
out to be less than sunny for the
Stanford baseball team.
The weather for this weekend's
Stanford-USC clash of top-ranked
teams was infinitely better than
the mess that screwed up last
week's series at UCLA, but other
than that and strong perform
ances by pitcher Stan Spencer and
designated hitter David Holbrook
in Saturday's win, the Cardinal
didn't have much to write home
about.

Cardinal drops two of

three to Trojans

Stanford is now 13-5 (3-3 in
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division play) and has lost four
of its last six games. For their
part, USC is sitting alone at the
top of the Six-Pac at 4-1, 12-3
overall. But, according to USC
Coach Mike Gillespie, this series
meant much more than a battle
for first place.
"Stanford is the one team we've
not matched up with in the past
three years," Gillespie said.
"We've done all right against
everyone else, but they've just
worked us over. That's why this
is big not just in terms of wins,

but in that now we know we can
beat them."
"Worked over" may actually be
too kind. Before this series, the
Cardinal had won 15 of its last
18 games against USC, including
an 11-1 stretch in 1987-88. And
a good portion of those wins had
come at the expense of USC
pitcher Randy Powers, who went
into Friday's opener sporting an
0-6 lifetime record and an 8.13
ERA against Stanford.
Powers promptly spat in the
face of history by going the whole
way — tossing 137 pitches — in
a 5-3 win. The Cardinal tagged
him for 11 hits (five in the last
two innings), but all but one of
them were singles.
"That was probably one of the
biggest games I've ever pitched,"
Powers said after his five
strikeout, no-walk surgery, which
raised his record to 4-0. "I proved
something to myself."
"That's a serious monkey off
his back," Gillespie agreed.
The Cardinal proved something
right back with a 5-2 win the next
afternoon in a game televised na
tionally by ESPN. This time it
was Spencer's turn to play vir
tuoso, as he tied his career high
with eight strikeouts {five in the
first two innings) in running his
record also to 4-0.
"Coming out of the pen I felt
I had every pitch working," Spen
cer said. "In the middle innings
I felt like I lost my slider and
wasn't locating my fastball as

well, and it took me a while to
get it back. I picked up some
velocity on the fastball toward the
end, though."
Even with Spencer not at his
best for several innings, the
Trojans could only manage two
runs — which was almost half as
many as Holbrook produced.
Holbrook, who had been hitting
.237 before Saturday with only
five RBI, accounted for all the
Cardinal runs on the day. He sin
gled in Paul Carey in the third,
hit into a fielder's choice to score
Carey again in the sixth, drove in
two more with a single in the
eighth and scored the final run
on an error.
Both of Holbrook's hits were
straight up the middle, which is
a good sign for Stanford. "I've
been trying to pull the ball, swing
ing too much," Holbrook said.
"I've been getting away from what
I do best, which is hit the ball up
the middle, go the other way,
make contact. I've been working
on it the last few days."
In Sunday's wrap-up, the Car
dinal wasted another good
showing from its pitching staff by
managing only six singles off
USC's John Cummings and Jackie
Nickell.
Stanford starter Mike Mussina
tossed a seven-hitter, but with
Cummings turning the Cardinal
bats into so much cheese whiz,
the Trojans walked away with a
3-1 win.
Even the Cardinal's lone run

came without a hit. Cummings
walked with the bases loaded
(thanks in part to a strike zone
with an identity crisis) with one
out in the seventh, but Nickell
came on to get him out of the
jam by getting Troy Paulsen to
fly out to the wall (scoring one

run) and inducing a grounder to
third from David McCarty.
The series' significance wasn't
lost on Gillespie. "For us, it's a
sensational weekend," he said.
"(Stanford's) just an outstanding
team — show me someone who
has two better starters than Mus

sina and Spencer. You can't.
"As far as the rest of the season
goes, we know there's 25 games
left, but I do think to avoid getting
beaten on by Arizona State (the
Trojans swept two from the Sun
Devils last week) and Stanford is
very significant."


Al Green — Dally file
Second baseman Troy Paulsen and the top-ranked Cardinal nine could not weather the battle of the
polls, dropping two of three to USC this past weekend.
