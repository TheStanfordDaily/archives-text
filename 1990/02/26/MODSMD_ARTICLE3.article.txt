# First black to head Law Review
## Shauna Jackson to take over prestigious post at end of March 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
In a milestone event, the prestigious
Stanford Law Review elected its first
black president Friday.
Second-year law student Shauna
Jackson, 22, will take the helm of the
Law Review for its next volume, begin
ning at the end of March. The first
issue will be published in the fall.
Jackson is also one of the first women
to head the journal.
Law School Dean Paul Brest de
scribed Jackson as a "very bright, en
ergetic person who is involved in many
activities. I think she will be a won
derful president."
As president, Jackson will be respon
sible for overseeing all of the financial,
editorial and administrative functions
of the Law Review, which is run entirely

by law students.
Jackson said, "I was
ecstatic that I won."
She sees the job as a
challenge that she is ex
cited to undertake.
"I am priviliged to
serve as president and
grateful that [my
peersi selected me,"
she said.

In the past, relatively few students
of color have been on the Law Review
staff, she said. "I want to extend a
personal invitation" to students of color
to join the Law Review, she added.
Brest agreed with Jackson's senti
ments. He said he hopes her election
will "encourage other minority group
members to be on the Review and show
them that they can be a part of it."
Jackson has planned several goals for

her volume of the Law Review. In par
ticular, she wants to use more "notes,"
articles written by law students, in the
publication.
The Law Review generally contains
articles by law professors, practicing
lawyers, judges and other experts, in
addition to student notes.
Jackson was selected by the members
of the Law Review's next volume, over
which she will preside.
Jackson received her bachelor's
degree in English and political science
from Stanford in 1988. She has worked
at KZSU, serving as station manager
in 1988-89, and is an ASSU senator
this year. She also has been a resident
assistant for four consecutive years, in
Madera House, the American Studies
House, and in the Suites this year and
last year. She received the Dean's
Award for Service last year.
