# Gymnasts upset Bruins despite rash of injuries
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Going into Friday night's meet, the
Cardinal's chances for remaining unde
feated looked slim. Very few people
believed that an injured Stanford team
could keep up with gymnastics power
house UCLA.
Before the night was over, however, the
skeptics would be proved wrong. The
Cardinal emerged looking stronger than
ever.
The first rotation of the meet, the
still rings, put Stanford at an early .80
disadvantage. But the next event, floor,
was highlighted by a season record 9.65
performance by senior Conrad
Voorsanger. Despite the fact that only
five gymnasts were healthy enough to
compete in this rotation, the Cardinal
managed to edge UCLA out of its leading
position. As Cal fell further behind, it
became clear that the struggle for first
place would be between Stanford and
the Bruins.
Despite good efforts on the pommel
horse by Voorsanger and injured Wang,
Stanford's lead was cut to a meager .05
after three events. According to coach
Sadao Hamada, this served as the turn
ing point of the competition.
"I called a short team meeting and
told everyone that it was their job to
hit the next three events. I knew that

Cardinal 276.65

UCLA 274.95

if we could do that, we could win," he
said.
The squad took his words to heart
and performed with renewed vigor on
high bar. David Neithardt, the first gym
nast to compete in the event, came away
with a 9.45 and set the stage for out
standing performances by senior Charles
Loop (9.65) and freshmen Jeff Bender
(9.65) and Jair Lynch (9.50).
The gained momentum did not abate
as the team tackled the vault and par
allel bars. The overall score on the latter
was the highest of the season, and sealed
what had only hours before seemed to
be an unattainable victory.
Individually, Voorsanger took the all
around honors with a 56.75 and was
followed closely by Loop at 56.7. In the
end, however, it was the team effort that
made the difference. "This was the
first meet that I felt we really pulled
together as a team," Neithardt said.
On the other hand, the Bruins'
showing was far from their best of the
season and may not be indicative of
their full talent. Just three weeks ago,
for example, their all-around score was
279.2.
