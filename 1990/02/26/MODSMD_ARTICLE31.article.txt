The Stanford men's tennis team
solidified its hold on the No. 1 national
ranking yesterday as the Cardinal
crushed Pacific 10 Conference rival Cal
ifornia, 5-2, in the finals of the
USTA/ITCA National Team Indoors in
Louisville, Ky.
Stanford, which moved to 8-0 on the
season, advanced to the finals of the
prestigious tournament with seeming
ease, blasting host-school Kentucky 6-0,
No. 7-ranked Miami 5-1 and top-20 UC-
Irvine 6-0. The top 16 teams in the
country competed for the title.
In the finals, freshman Jonathan

Stark overpowered California's No. 1,
Doug Eisenman, 6-4, 6-3. The win was
significant because Stark had needed to
rally from a third-set 5-0 deficit the
last time the two met, in the semifinals
of the NorCal Intercollegiates held early
last week.
Sophomore Alex O'Brien showed his
usual mental toughness as he came back
from a tight second set to beat the
Bears' No. 2-player Bent-Ove Pedersen,
6-3, 6-7, 6-2.
At No. 4, freshman Jared Palmer lost
a close first set but triumphed over
California's Carl Chang, 6-7, 6-4, 6-3.
Meanwhile, junior Glenn Solomon dis
pelled quickly of Matt Stroyman, 6-3,
6-3.

The highlight of the match, however,
came at No. 3 doubles when Jason Yee
and Alex O'Brien clinched the title with
a 6-1, 6-2 win over Chang and
Fitzpatrick. Stanford Coach Dick Gould
praised the No. 3 doubles team, partic
ularly Yee, who had not played earlier
in the day.
Matt Lucena and Pete Fitzpatrick
provided the Bears with their only high
lights, downing the Cardinal's No. 3
Jeff Cathrall and No. 6 Alexis Hombrec
her, respectively.
The No. 1 and No. 2 doubles matches
were not completed.
With the win, Stanford will remain
atop the ITCA/Volvo Tennis Rankings.
