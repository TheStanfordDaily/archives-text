## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
The last time these two squads met
on American soil over 10 years ago, the
"amateur" Soviet National Team ran
past the United States' National Team
4-1. Saturday at Stanford Stadium in
front of 61,000 fans, the recently
dubbed, "professional" Soviet team,

with a dominant 3-1 victory, made their
young American opponents look like
amateurs.
"Dependence on the government [of
the U.S.SR] that existed previoU.S.ly is
no longer true. Every player mU.S.t
know he is a professional," Soviet Coach
Valery Lobanovsky said. "We were al
ways petrified of this word [profes
sional!; now we're not afraid to say it."

The Soviet players on the Stanford
field were also not afraid to perform at
a professional level. After 30 minutes
of cautious play on both sides of the
ball, streaking Soviet defender Vladimir
Bessonov caught a soft pass on the right
side of the goal from midfielder Fedor
Cherenkov. Without hesitation, Bes-
sonov slammed the ball past diving goalie Tony
Meola to give the Soviets a 1-0 lead.
"Things definitely broke down after the first
goal," U.S. midfielder Bruce Murray said. "We
panicked a little bit."
Although the Americans were never able to regain
their original composure, they did even the score
at 41:56. Following a debatable tripping call on
Soviet defender Oleg Luzny, U.S. midfielder John
Harkes aimed the penalty kick at the midpoint
between the goalposts and snuck the ball under
goalie Victor Chanov make the score 1-1.
The score, however, did not reflect the Soviet
dominance of the midfield, even without the services
of injured superstar Alexei Mikhailichenko. On
numeroU.S. occasions, midfielder Oleg Kuznetsov
carried the ball uncontested from the half line to
the penalty box and enabled the Soviets to establish
creative offensive attacks.
"We just messed up our marking," Murray said.
"We didn't pick up that space and we got burned
by it."
Just before the end of the half, as the Stanford
crowd thundered out unified "U-S-A" cheers, the
Soviets lit up the scoreboard with their second goal.
Cherenkov picked up a ball that had ricocheted off
of a seven-man American wall and slammed the
ball past the surprised Meola.
The Soviets rode this momentum into the second
half. Displaying their superior discipline, the Soviet
defense allowed only one open shot on goal. The
threat of U.S. attacks was continually minimized
when Soviet defenders cornered isolated American
offenders on the sides of the field. At the other
end, the confused American defenders scrambled to
slow down the bevy of shots the Soviet attackers
released.
