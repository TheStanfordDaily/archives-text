Golf finishes eighth in Miami
"More than any other sport, golf requires
mental toughness."
After completing the University of Miami
(Fla.) Intercollegiate tied for eighth, the in
sightful words of Stanford men's golf coach
Wally Goodwin reveal what appears to be his
squad's only deficiency: mentfd stamina.
The team's three-day team total of 915 tied
the Cardinal with Fresno State for eighth
place, and was 49 shots off the scorching pace
set by victorious Florida.
Despite the team's fine recovery from an
opening round which placed it tied for 15th
in an 18 team field, the squad's performance
demonstrated a disturbing and potentially
problematic tendency.
Throughout the Miami event, the Cardinal
negated excellent early round showings with
poor play on its final holes.
Goodwin cited the Cardinal's performance
on the closing holes of Friday's opening round
as indicative of the lapses in concentration
that plagued the team all weekend.
"With five holes left, we were in second
place. We finished the day tied for 15th. Ob
viously, we're not finishing strongly and that
can be a neutralizing factor," he said.
Stanford's inability to maintain momentum
at the end of a round surfaced again Saturday,
as the Cardinal linksters were twelve shots
over par on the final three holes.
The squad was led by Christian Cevaer,
whose 223 total tied him or tenth individually.
The skillful sophomore tamed the demanding
Bermuda grass "Silver Course" of the vaunted
Doral Park resort with a fine even par 72 in
yesterday's final round.
Seniors Marc Funseth and Brad Geer both
overcame disappointing opening rounds to
finish strongly. Bolstered by Funseth's 75 and
Geer's 73 yesterday , the Cardinal cut its team
total by 10 strokes from Saturday's round.
Freshman David Rutkowski posted a 231
total in his debut appearance on the collegiate
circuit. Goodwin was "very pleased" with Rut
kowski's premiere performance for Stanford.
Having isolated the team's only remaining
weakness, Goodwin has turned his attention
to discovering its source. The veteran coach
discounted questions of his team's physical
conditioning.
"It's not physical. We hit the ball as hard
at the end of a day as we do at the beginning.
It could be something in our minds that let's
up, and we need to work on that," he said.

Gymnasts best field of six
The Stanford women's gymnastics team gave
new meaning to the term "bounce back" this
weekend.
After a lackluster performance last week at
Arizona in which the squad had its lowest
team total this year, the Cardinal made an
abrupt about-face and set a new season plateau
Saturday.
Stanford earned the score of 186.8 — over
seven points better than last week's total —
on its way to winning the six-team Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo Invitational. The host Mus
tangs were second with a score of 185.7, fol
lowed by Seattle-Pacific (183.6), Texas Wom
en's University (180.2), San Jose State (179.3),
and UC-Santa Barbara (177.65).
Senior co-captain Dina Amoroso was once
again the standout of the meet. She won the
all-around title with a 38.05 — .05 away from
a career best — and also took top honors on
floor exercise with a 9.55 and on bars with a
team season-high 9.6.
Amoroso's chief competitor in the all-around
was Stanford freshman Erin McCann, who
recovered from last week's knee injury to score
a season-high 37.35 and take the silver. Junior
Jennifer Bloom took fifth in the event with a
37.15.
Junior Julie Dunhill turned in a fine per
formance on vault as she took second place
by earning a 9.4 out of a possible 9.5 for her
handspring full vault.
On balance beam, senior Marietta Frey had
another rock-solid routine, earning a team
season-high 9.6 to tie for first place. The score
was a career best for Frey, and the award was
the first in her three-year Stanford career.
The best event of the evening for the Car
dinal was balance beam, as the team finished
with a total of 47.25. In addition to Frey's
performance, Amoroso scored a 9.55 to take
third, and McCann recorded a season-high 9.5.

Track teams surprise Hears
The track and field team returned from
Berkeley Saturday evening having scared the
wits out of the Golden Bears. Both the men's
and women's teams turned in impressive
performances at the annual Bay Area Relays.
The event had been moved from its usual
site at the Stanford track to allow for the
United States-Soviet Union soccer game.
While California expected to be challenged
in selected events, Stanford ended up showing
great strength in nearly every event, forebod
ing trouble for the Bears at Big Meet in April.
"We're showing the balance and depth it
takes (to beat Call," Coach Brooks Johnson
said. "This is the most depth across the board
that we've ever had."
The individual highlight of the meet, which
is not scored, was the performance of Jen
Jauquet, who achieved three lifetime bests.
She placed second in two events — the long
jump at over 19 feet and the 100-meter hurdles
at 14.7 seconds. She also leapt for a 5-foot-6
in the high jump.
There were other impressive performances
on the women's side. Among them, the 400-
meter relay team captured first place with a
school-record 46.1 seconds. The 800-meter
relay team also garnered a first place finish,
as super sophomore sprinter Chryste Gaines
passed both Cal runners in the last leg of the
race to break the tape at 1:40.7,
James Kostohryz performed a similar feat,
passing two Califrrnia throwers on his last
hurl to take first in the discus with a distance
of 168-foot-5. Kostohryz also placed first in
the javelin, with a throw of 187-foot-7.
