## Stanford spikers taken to sudden death in five-set squeeker over Long Beach 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
Two hours and 32 minutes of
some of the most thrilling volley
ball ever played on the Stanford
campus came down to one point.
Minutes before, the men's vol
leyball team had been down 14-11
in the fifth game, one point away
from being Long Beach State's
third upset victim in a row. Afler
hours of cheering their hearts out,
only a few of the Cardinal faithful
had the hope and the strength to
stand in support of their team.
But it was clutch time and a gut
check was in order.
The spikers won a point and
gained service, and suddenly the
crowd came to life. Loud life.

49ers 2

Bolstered by the fans, the Car
dinal rallied to tie the game at
14. The 49ers sided-out for a 15-14
advantage and their second match
point. Stanford came right back
with two points. 16-15, match
point for the men in cardinal and
white.
But Long Beach State sided-out
to make it 16-16. Because of the
new 17-point ceiling in NCAA
men's volleyball, whoever won the
next point would claim the match,
sole possession of first place in
the WIVA and probably the na
tion's No. 1 ranking.
To say it was a big point is an
understatement.
Had this not been the fifth
game, Stanford would have been
in deep trouble, since ordinarily
only the serving team can score
points. But as a result of the
NCAA rules enacted this year, in
the fifth game every kill counts
as a point, side-outs included.

Thus, since side-outs are generally
easier to achieve, Stanford actu
ally had the advantage.
The Cardinal returned serve
with a Bob Hillman spike. The
49ers came up with the dig, but
confusion seized them as more
than 2,000 eyes watched the well
passed ball lazily arc through the
air and fall upon the hardwood.
The team exploded as the crowd
came flowing down from the
bleachers to congratulate their be
leaguered heroes.
The final point was appropriate.
The man credited with the kill,
Hillman, had been one of the keys
to Stanford's performance
throughout the match.
An exhausted Stanford coach
Fred Sturm praised Hillman.
"Bob Hillman really gave us a
huge lift." He described his team's
performance as "a gutty come
back. We played our best when it
was needed, and that's a great
quality for a team to have."
Setter Parker Blackman said of
the contest, "It was the most
draining match I've played, emo
tionally and physically."
But Parker had more than his
own energy to draw upon during
the match, and this was perhaps
the key for the Cardinal. Had it
not been for 1,013 screaming,
stomping fans, the Stanford
spikers might not have held up
to the determined 49ers, who in
vaded Burnham Pavilion snorting
fire after having upset both No.
2 USC and then-No. 1 UCLA.
"I thought the crowd was ex
cellent," said Sturm. "They were
our seventh man tonight. They
gave us a big boost. They really
kept our players inspired.
Home crowds don't guarantee
wins, but as Sturm says, in"the
kind of match where it's tough
for either team to lose," they can
help win points. Especially those
big points.
