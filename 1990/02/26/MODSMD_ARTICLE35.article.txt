# Card adds two more W's to tally
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
It was a bit of a strange match
Saturday, but for the Pepperdine
Waves the result was all too
familiar.
Pepperdine's Ginger Helgeson
suffered a foot injury and was
unable to play her scheduled No.
1 singles match against Sandra
Birch. The Waves, however, did
not have another player on the
trip with them to put in the
lineup. So, instead of the normal
total of nine matches only seven
were played, Birch took the day
off and Stanford scored a crushing
6-1 victory.

Cardinal 6, Waves 1

Cardinal 9, Aztecs 0

Combine that with a shellack
ing of San Diego State Friday,
and the Cardinal finished off the
weekend at 9-0, ready to take its
perfect record to the National
Team Indoors later this week.
San Diego State, ranked 20th
in the country, fell to 3-3 while
fifth-rated Pepperdine is now 7-4.
With the Birch-Helgeson show
down for the nation's top ranking
canceled, it was up to Pepper
dine's other top players to provide
the drama. Unfortunately for
those in attendance, they did not.
The Waves' Janna Kovacevich
often gives opponents fits with her
deceptive game. Saturday, after
Meredith McGrath overpowered
her 6-1, 6-1, Kovacevich was left
looking for answers.

The results were similar at No.
2 singles, where Debbie Graham
howitzered Camilla Ohrman 6-1,
6-0. Graham's serve was not bro
ken once in the match.
Displaying an improved serve,
Teri Whitlinger wiped out Anna
Brunstron 6-1, 6-0. Stanford led
the match 3-0 at that point. In
the meantime, Heather Willens
was pulling out a 6-4, 6-2 victory
over Kristin Smith. That left only
the Lisa Green-Carrie Crissel
match for determining whether
the Cardinal would clinch in
singles.
Green lost the first set to Cris
ael 6-4. Then the Cardinal's cap
tain lifted herself out of the
doldrums to win 12 of the next
14 games and capture the final
sets 6-2, 6-0.
"I would've liked to have seen
them play their full lineup," Bren
nan said. "But we have no control
over that. What we do have con
trol over is McGrath one and one,
Graham one and love and Whit
linger one and love," he added,
reeling off the scores of the day's
three blowouts.
In doubles action, McGrath and
Whitlinger lost the first set 6-3
before rebounding to win the last
two 6-2, 6-4. "I'm pleased with
Teri and Meredith," Brennan said.
"They're going to have to realize
that life isn't all straight-set vic
tories."
Green and Willens dropped the
No. 2 doubles match to
Kovacevich and Smith, 6-4, 6-3.
"They did not play too bad a
match," Brennan said. "They
were returning very well and the
net player was doing what they
were supposed to do."

Friday's visitor was the Aztecs
and the Cardinal was more than
willing to play conquistador.
Birch was in action against
Dorey Brandt and scored a dom
inant 6-2, 6-2 win at No. 1 singles.
With McGrath resting, Graham
slid up to No. 2 and picked apart
Michelle Apra 6-2, 6-2. The parade
of blowouts continued at No. 3
singles where Whitlinger dusted
Eva Olivarez 6-1, 6-2.
Green nearly shut out Susan
Hawke at No. 4. The Cardinal's
captain gave up just one game in
a crushing 6-0, 6-1 victory.
At fifth and sixth singles, Wil
lens and Mario Carruth threat
ened to make the match interest
ing by dropping first set tiebreak
ers to Paige Hammond and Nicole
Storto. Both responded strongly,
however, by posting identical 6-4,
6-2 scores in the their second and
third sets.
With the singles sweep com
plete, the Cardinal could not have
been blamed had they turned in
a lackluster doubles showing. In
stead. they turned in an inspired
one.
McGrath and Whitlinger al
lowed Brandt and Storto just
three games in a 6-0, 6-3 victory.
Birch and Graham hammered
Hammond and Olivarez. 6-3, 6-3.
Finally, Green and Willens
crushed Hawke and Apra 6-2, 6-0.

Mario Carruth downed her Aztec opponent to add to Stanford's first of two team victories this
weekend, a 9-0 win over San Diego State. The Cardinal also embarrassed Pepperdine 6-1 Saturday.

and the Cardinal finished off the
weekend at 9-0, ready to take its
perfect record to the National
Team Indoors later this week.
San Diego State, ranked 20th
in the country, fell to 3-3 while
fifth-rated Pepperdine is now 7-4.
With the Birch-Helgeson show
down for the nation's top ranking
canceled, it was up to Pepper
dine's other top players to provide
the drama. Unfortunately for
those in attendance, they did not.
The Waves' Janna Kovacevich
often gives opponents fits with her
deceptive game. Saturday, after
Meredith McGrath overpowered
her 6-1, 6-1, Kovacevich was left
looking for answers.

The results were similar at No.
2 singles, where Debbie Graham
howitzered Camilla Ohrman 6-1,
6-0. Graham's serve was not bro
ken once in the match.
Displaying an improved serve,
Teri Whitlinger wiped out Anna
Brunstron 6-1, 6-0. Stanford led
the match 3-0 at that point. In
the meantime, Heather Willens
was pulling out a 6-4, 6-2 victory
over Kristin Smith. That left only
the Lisa Green-Carrie Crissel
match for determining whether
the Cardinal would clinch in
singles.
Green lost the first set to Cris
ael 6-4. Then the Cardinal's cap
tain lifted herself out of the
doldrums to win 12 of the next
14 games and capture the final
sets 6-2, 6-0.
"I would've liked to have seen
them play their full lineup," Bren
nan said. "But we have no control
over that. What we do have con
trol over is McGrath one and one,
Graham one and love and Whit
linger one and love," he added,
reeling off the scores of the day's
three blowouts.
In doubles action, McGrath and
Whitlinger lost the first set 6-3
before rebounding to win the last
two 6-2, 6-4. "I'm pleased with
Teri and Meredith," Brennan said.
"They're going to have to realize
that life isn't all straight-set vic
tories."
Green and Willens dropped the
No. 2 doubles match to
Kovacevich and Smith, 6-4, 6-3.
"They did not play too bad a
match," Brennan said. "They
were returning very well and the
net player was doing what they
were supposed to do."

Friday's visitor was the Aztecs
and the Cardinal was more than
willing to play conquistador.
Birch was in action against
Dorey Brandt and scored a dom
inant 6-2, 6-2 win at No. 1 singles.
With McGrath resting, Graham
slid up to No. 2 and picked apart
Michelle Apra 6-2, 6-2. The parade
of blowouts continued at No. 3
singles where Whitlinger dusted
Eva Olivarez 6-1, 6-2.
Green nearly shut out Susan
Hawke at No. 4. The Cardinal's
captain gave up just one game in
a crushing 6-0, 6-1 victory.
At fifth and sixth singles, Wil
lens and Mario Carruth threat
ened to make the match interest
ing by dropping first set tiebreak
ers to Paige Hammond and Nicole
Storto. Both responded strongly,
however, by posting identical 6-4,
6-2 scores in the their second and
third sets.
With the singles sweep com
plete, the Cardinal could not have
been blamed had they turned in
a lackluster doubles showing. In
stead. they turned in an inspired
one.
McGrath and Whitlinger al
lowed Brandt and Storto just
three games in a 6-0, 6-3 victory.
Birch and Graham hammered
Hammond and Olivarez. 6-3, 6-3.
Finally, Green and Willens
crushed Hawke and Apra 6-2, 6-0.
Card notes
The National Indoors in Madison,
Wis. is played in a format similar to
the NCAA tournament Stanford, the
defending Indoor and NCAA cham
pion, opens Thursday with a match
against host school Wisconsin.


Mario Carruth downed her Aztec opponent to add to Stanford's first of two team victories this
weekend, a 9-0 win over San Diego State. The Cardinal also embarrassed Pepperdine 6-1 Saturday.
It was a bit of a strange match
Saturday, but for the Pepperdine
Waves the result was all too
familiar.
Pepperdine's Ginger Helgeson
suffered a foot injury and was
unable to play her scheduled No.
1 singles match against Sandra
Birch. The Waves, however, did
not have another player on the
trip with them to put in the
lineup. So, instead of the normal
total of nine matches only seven
were played, Birch took the day
off and Stanford scored a crushing
6-1 victory.
