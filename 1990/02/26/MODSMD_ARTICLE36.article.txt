# Soccer star's goal makes dream reality
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
On Nov. 19 on the island city Port of Spain, Paul
Caligiuri indelibly scratched his name into the his
tory books of United States soccer.
That afternoon, Caligiuri caught a Trinidad and
Tobago goalie off guard and slammed a 25-yard
volley into the back of the net to score the goal
that would secure the United States a spot in the
World Cup for the first time in 40 years.
"The highlight wasn't scoring the goal," Caligiuri
said. "When that final whistle blew in the qualifying
match, we realized that our dreams were finally
becoming reality. At that moment, it was hard to
believe it was happening."
Previous to reaching the pinnacle of American
soccer, Caligiuri had garnered a list of accomplish
ments that would have more than fulfilled the
dreams of most young players.
After graduating from Los Angeles' Walnut High
School, Caligiuri led his UCLA squad to the NCAA
Championship. Following college, he played for a
couple of months with a first-division professional
team in Hamburg before moving to his present
second-division German squad, SV Meppen
A few months ago, after scoring the goal, Caligiuri
returned to Meppen To his amazement, he received
a standing ovation from the 10,000 fans in the
stadium.
"I never have had quite that feeling before," he
said. "After winning NCAAs, a crowd at Pauley
Pavilion gave our whole team a standing ovation,
but this was incredible."
Without receiving quite the same adoring atten
tion in the United States, Caligiuri and the rest of
the American squad have been training intensely
and traveling for about 20 days each month since
January 1. Many of the members
have families and children, and
all of the players have made great
sacrifices to participate on the
team.
Most of the players, including
Caligiuri, will attempt to cash in
on the sacrifice by using the ex
posure from the World Cup to
push along their professional
careers in Europe.
"I do have dreams and aspira
tions to go back to the career I
put on hold in Europe," Caligiuri
said. "But the bottom line is that
I want to do my best for the team.
It is the ultimate compliment and
greatest honor for any soccer
player to play for his country in
the World Cup."

Caligiuri claims that this "first
generation of true American soc
cer players" will surprise some
doubters in Italy.
Before attempting to shock the
disbelievers, Caligiuri finally got
his chance yesterday to compete
in front of a "real home crowd,"
the 61,000 fans who made up the
largest non-Olympic crowd ever
to watch a U.S. National Team
game. The World Cup squad has
played in front of large crowds in
Los Angeles, New York, Miami,
and Chicago, but each time the
support of the ethnic groups
favored the visiting nation.
"Those were basically away
games on home soil," Caligiuri
said. "But this is the start of a
new beginning for American soc
cer. It is the chance of a lifetime
for us — if we had to buy our
shoes to compete, we'd do it."
