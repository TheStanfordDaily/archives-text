### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
On Nov. 19 on the island city Port of Spain, Paul
Caligiuri indelibly scratched his name into the his
tory books of United States soccer.
That afternoon, Caligiuri caught a Trinidad and
Tobago goalie off guard and slammed a 25-yard
volley into the back of the net to score the goal
that would secure the United States a spot in the
World Cup for the first time in 40 years.
"The highlight wasn't scoring the goal," Caligiuri
said. "When that final whistle blew in the qualifying
match, we realized that our dreams were finally
becoming reality. At that moment, it was hard to
believe it was happening."
Previous to reaching the pinnacle of American
soccer, Caligiuri had garnered a list of accomplish
ments that would have more than fulfilled the
dreams of most young players.
After graduating from Los Angeles' Walnut High
School, Caligiuri led his UCLA squad to the NCAA
Championship. Following college, he played for a
couple of months with a first-division professional
team in Hamburg before moving to his present
second-division German squad, SV Meppen
A few months ago, after scoring the goal, Caligiuri
returned to Meppen To his amazement, he received
a standing ovation from the 10,000 fans in the
stadium.
"I never have had quite that feeling before," he
said. "After winning NCAAs, a crowd at Pauley
Pavilion gave our whole team a standing ovation,
but this was incredible."
Without receiving quite the same adoring atten
tion in the United States, Caligiuri and the rest of
the American squad have been training intensely
and traveling for about 20 days each month since
