## Certain humanities students once again eligible for summer assistantships 
### Paul Owens Staff writer 
In a reversal of an unpopular decision
it made last September, the Office of
Graduate Studies has announced that
first- and second-year graduate students
in 10 humanities departments will be
eligible to apply for summer research
assistantships under revised guidelines.
An assistantship will be worth $1,840

this summer, $730 more than the reg
ular summer fellowship of $1,110.
The announcement pleased members
of the ASSU's Graduate Concerns Com
mittee, who had worked to get eligibility
for the assistantships restored.
"This is a good example of what hap
pens when students, faculty and the ad
ministration work together," said com
mittee member Joe Ward. "You can
work out an arrangement that benefits

everybody "
Last September, Graduate Studies an
nounced that summer research assis
tantships would no longer be offered to
first- and second-year graduate students
on full fellowship in the 10 departments.
At the time, Assoc. Dean of Graduate
Studies Karlene Dickey said the change
had been made after three or four past
recipients of assistantships admit
ted they had not spent their sum
mers conducting research.
Members of the Graduate Con
cerns Committee complained that
students in the departments af
fected had not been consulted
about the change in policy. They
also pointed out that students in
eligible for the larger research as
sistantships would have to work
more and study less over the sum
mer to meet their expenses. The
committee expressed these con
cerns in a series of meetings with
Graduate Studies.
As a result of those meetings
and discussions with faculty in
the 10 departments, Dean of
Graduate Studies Elizabeth
Traugott announced in a recent
memorandum that research assis
tantships would again be offered
to first- and second-year students,
but under new guidelines.
According to those guidelines,
students seeking research assis
tantships will have to submit a
faculty-endorsed proposal for
summer research no later than
May 1. In addition, they will have
to account for the research they
conduct over the summer by filing
a written review in the fall.
The new guidelines will for the
first time allow students in the
affected departments who are
planning research off-campus
during the summer to apply for
assistantships. Ward hailed this
as "a really important change."
Many students, he said, conduct
legitimate summer research in
places far from Stanford.

The new guidelines
add up to 'a very dif
ferent plan.'

Dickey said the new guidelines
add up to "a very different plan
that makes the [summer] re
search fellowship a genuine re
search fellowship."
Traugott stressed in her memo
that Graduate Studies would be
reviewing the results of the
changes next fall before deciding
whether to offer the program
again the following summer. "En
tering students should not be
given an expectation that this type
of support is automatically avail
able," she added.
Dickey said Graduate Studies
is concerned about the $730 dif
ference between the money of
fered under the research assis
tantship versus that available un
der the regular summer fellow
ship. "We may be looking at ways
to narrow the gap in the future,"
she said.
Among the departments af
fected by the change are History
and English, the two humanities
departments with the largest
numbers of graduate students.
