## Automobile pushed through front of post office early Friday morning 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
The Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity hoped
that by holding its second "Car Bash"
fund-raising event of the year in White
Plaza, the student response would be
overwhelmingly enthusiastic. Friday
morning, however, the festivities began
earlier and more violently than sched
uled.
At 5:05 a.m., a post office employee
found the 1979 Toyota Tercel — which
the Sammies had planned to smash for
charity — crashed through the glass
doors of the post office. Apparently, the
hatchback had been pushed from the
edge of the lawn in White Plaza down

the incline and stairs to the post office
doors sometime between 2 and 6 a.m.
Friday.
The damage proved to be part of a
series of vandalism incidents around
White Plaza Friday morning. A recy
cling barrel was smashed against the
other set of post office doors, a lamppost
was broken and numerous bicycles out
side Tresidder Union were damaged.
"At this time we have not named any
suspects," said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. "However, we are cur
rently investigating some clues and
physical evidence left at the scene of
the crime."
Because the car damaged a federal
building, the crime is classified as a

federal offense and is simultaneously
being investigated by U.S. Postal Serv
ice inspectors.
Although window service at the post
office was interrupted by the vandalism,
outside mailboxes and package retrieval
services were not restricted Friday, ac
cording to general manager Ray Chun.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Ramsey-Perez met with Sigma Alpha
Mu President Todd Feldman Friday af
ternoon to assess the damages. The Uni
versity has offered to pay for the post
office glass, which was insured.
The Car Bash event was to be held
in White Plaza on Friday afternoon,
with all proceeds going to benefit Earth
Day 1990.
