The University is expected to give of
ficial sanction to a Women's Needs As
sessment Group that would do for
women what the University Committee
on Minority Issues did for people of color.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Michael
Jackson, whose office will issue the
charge, described the group as "an ex
tension of the spirit of UCMI, in the
sense that we are looking at a specific
population" of the campus community.
The group will focus on "how graduate
and undergraduate women are faring in
the community [andl make sure there
are no institutional stumbling blocks for
women to receive a fulfilling education,"
Jackson said. Although the study is in
tended to be similar in nature to UCMI,
University officials do not intend it to
be as comprehensive.
Since early fall quarter, the committee
has existed in a loosely constituted form,
according to Women's Center coordinator
Teri Hopper.
"There are ways we can improve how
we are reaching women on this campus,"
said Hopper, explaining the project's im
petus. Among the questions the com
mittee will consider is the possibility of

a full-time dean for
women's issues.
Faculty and staff
members, as well as a
few students, constitute
the group. "As we are
better able to define
what we are going to do,
there will be more op
portunity for student in
volvement," Jackson

said. "The charge will help us define
what we are going to do and what we
are not going to do."
The committee plans to issue a pre
liminary report using recent surveys
compiled by Cowell Student Health
Center and groups such as the Rape
Education Project, according to Hopper.
Issues of funding will be considered
after the charge is formulated. "We are
still in the concept stage," said Jackson,
adding that funding should not be a
problem because many sectors of the
University, such as Residential Educa
tion and the Undergraduate Advising
Center, are involved.
Hopper emphasized the importance of
the project for campus women "We ex
pect to get appropriate funding," she
said. "This needs to be done, and it
needs to be done thoroughly."
