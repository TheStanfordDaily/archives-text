## Judicial process increases trauma for rape victims 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
When "Pamela" was a freshman here,
a male medical student often hung
around her dormitory and ate meals in
the dorm dining hall. When she and a
female friend went on a double date with
him and a friend of his, Pamela had no
idea the medical student would rape her.
Later that evening, he made sexual
advances toward her, despite her at
tempts to push him away. Finally, he
pushed her to the ground violently and
got on top of her. Pamela says she was
shocked and felt afraid for her life.
She repeatedly told him, "No, don't
do this."
She froze, and he raped her. At first
she did not know what to do, she says.
For the rest of the academic year,
Pamela tried to deny that she was raped.
"I hadn't thought through what hap
pened to me," she says in retrospect.
After the rape, Pamela became de
pressed and with drew from others. "I
was afraid of being alone, but I was
afraid of meeting new people," she
recalls. "I lost confidence in my ability
to judge people, so I became really de
pendent on one or two people."
Frightened and confused, she decided
to stop out for a year to get away from
the campus where she was raped. During
her year away, she had nightmares about
her sisters being raped by the same stu
dent who raped her, and she had fears
of being gang raped. She then went to
a rape treatment center.

Pamela decided to report her rape to
the University's .Judicial Affairs Office.
Her experience with the office reveals
that the system is plagued by blind spots
that ignore the unique nature of rape
and ultimately harm the victim.
These shortcomings include a lack of
sensitivity for the victim and a neglect
of the victim's rights, absence of an of
ficial University condemnation of rape,
and a standard of evidence for prosecu

tion that is more stringent than that of
most universities.
When she returned to Stanford after
a year, Pamela had no intention of
reporting the incident to Judicial Affairs
â€” until she learned that the alleged
rapist had plans to become a
gynecologist. Pamela then called several
groups, including Counseling and Psy
chological Services, the Bridge, the
School of Medicine, the ombudsperson
and Residential Education. She says
everyone she talked to told her to call
someone else.
"No one had any knowledge of any
sort of protocol," Pamela recalls.
According to Pamela, the dean of the
Medical School set up a meeting with
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole. At
the meeting, Pamela related the incident
to a representative of the Medical School,
Cole and Susan Hoerger, senior counsel
for the University.
Although each person other than
Pamela at the meeting was accompanied
by legal counsel, Pamela says no one
ever raised the issue of her legal rights
or her right to have an advocate at the
meeting.
Most of the questions during the meet
ing focused on irrelevant details of the
evening rather than the details of the
rape, according to Pamela.
"They asked me, 'Why are you report
ing this now?' and 'Why did you wait
so long before reporting it?' They
weren't educated or trained to under
stand acquaintance rape."
