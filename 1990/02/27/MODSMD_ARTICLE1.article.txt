# Battling Bureaucracy
## Judicial process increases trauma for rape victims 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
When "Pamela" was a freshman here,
a male medical student often hung
around her dormitory and ate meals in
the dorm dining hall. When she and a
female friend went on a double date with
him and a friend of his, Pamela had no
idea the medical student would rape her.
Later that evening, he made sexual
advances toward her, despite her at
tempts to push him away. Finally, he
pushed her to the ground violently and
got on top of her. Pamela says she was
shocked and felt afraid for her life.
She repeatedly told him, "No, don't
do this."
She froze, and he raped her. At first
she did not know what to do, she says.
For the rest of the academic year,
Pamela tried to deny that she was raped.
"I hadn't thought through what hap
pened to me," she says in retrospect.
After the rape, Pamela became de
pressed and with drew from others. "I
was afraid of being alone, but I was
afraid of meeting new people," she
recalls. "I lost confidence in my ability
to judge people, so I became really de
pendent on one or two people."
Frightened and confused, she decided
to stop out for a year to get away from
the campus where she was raped. During
her year away, she had nightmares about
her sisters being raped by the same stu
dent who raped her, and she had fears
of being gang raped. She then went to
a rape treatment center.

Pamela decided to report her rape to
the University's .Judicial Affairs Office.
Her experience with the office reveals
that the system is plagued by blind spots
that ignore the unique nature of rape
and ultimately harm the victim.
These shortcomings include a lack of
sensitivity for the victim and a neglect
of the victim's rights, absence of an of
ficial University condemnation of rape,
and a standard of evidence for prosecu

tion that is more stringent than that of
most universities.
When she returned to Stanford after
a year, Pamela had no intention of
reporting the incident to Judicial Affairs
— until she learned that the alleged
rapist had plans to become a
gynecologist. Pamela then called several
groups, including Counseling and Psy
chological Services, the Bridge, the
School of Medicine, the ombudsperson
and Residential Education. She says
everyone she talked to told her to call
someone else.
"No one had any knowledge of any
sort of protocol," Pamela recalls.
According to Pamela, the dean of the
Medical School set up a meeting with
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole. At
the meeting, Pamela related the incident
to a representative of the Medical School,
Cole and Susan Hoerger, senior counsel
for the University.
Although each person other than
Pamela at the meeting was accompanied
by legal counsel, Pamela says no one
ever raised the issue of her legal rights
or her right to have an advocate at the
meeting.
Most of the questions during the meet
ing focused on irrelevant details of the
evening rather than the details of the
rape, according to Pamela.
"They asked me, 'Why are you report
ing this now?' and 'Why did you wait
so long before reporting it?' They
weren't educated or trained to under
stand acquaintance rape."

At the end of the meeting, Pamela
asked what her rights were and what
would happen next. "They just looked at
me blankly," she says. Pamela says she
had gone into the meeting hoping to
prevent the man from raping other
women and future patients. But when
she left the meeting she felt "judged and
disappointed."
A right to protection?
More than a week passed, and Pamela
heard nothing from Judicial Affairs. On
her own initiative, she called Cole's office
and left a message.
About a week later, the male student
called her, immediately after Cole had
informed him of Pamela's allegations.
Pamela told him not to call her again
and hung up.
"They didn't tell me when my alleged
assailant would be notified," Pamela says.
"I was afraid for my life," she remem
bers.
She then called the police, Res Ed and
Cole. "I wanted [Cole) to make it clear
to him not to call me," Pamela recalls.
In most cases, residence deans can
prohibit contact between the victim and
the alleged assailant immediately after
reporting the incident. "We often take
very fast administrative action to protect
the student in a variety of ways," Cole
explains.
These actions are outside of the judicial
process. But this action was not taken
in Pamela's case, and Cole did not suggest
that she talk to a residence dean.
Over the summer, Cole contacted
Pamela at her home and told her she
had given Pamela's phone number to the
alleged assailant's attorney, Pamela says.
Pamela was frightened that the attorney
would call. "[Cole] should have gotten
my consent before giving out my num
ber."
However, Cole says she did not and
would not give out the phone number of
a victim, but she also cannot prevent
contact.
The waiting game
After the initial encounter with Judicial
Affairs, the quarter went by, and Pamela
heard nothing from Judicial Affairs. "I
was just waiting — I think that was the
hardest part [of the reporting process]
for me," Pamela says.
Pamela was never informed of the
status of her case. Every step of the
process, Pamela says, she had to take
the initiative and find out what should
be done next. During this waiting period,
Pamela thought about dropping the case.
Pamela says that during this time she
feared for her life because the alleged
assailant was still at Stanford. "This proc
ess was unfair. Long periods of time had
passed without any contact. I cooperated
in every way and yet [Cole] said it was
not enough," Pamela says.
Cole handled this case as if it were
only a case of plagiarism rather than a
felony, Pamela says. Pamela also feared
for the safety of others.
According to Cole, the judicial process
in the case took time because of the large
number of people involved, including the
attorney of the accused. Cole says she
explained this fact to Pamela at the initial
meeting.
Cole, however, says she is "not com
fortable" commenting on this case be
cause of a grievance that has been filed
against her by another student, alleging
that Cole violated the right to privacy of
a complainant in a rape case.
At the end of summer, Cole unexpec
tedly called Pamela to tell her that she
had decided to close the case without
filing a charge and that Pamela had three
hours to provide evidence to convince her
otherwise, Pamela says.
This was only the second time Cole

had contacted Pamela during the five
month process.
A phone conference between the Uni
versity, Pamela and her legal advisers
was set up. But Cole had already made
up her mind and she closed the case that
day, Pamela says.
"In essence I was victimized twice: first
by the rapist and then by Stanford's lack
of action," she says.
Last month, Cole brought the case to
the public. In a Jan. 19 letter to The
Daily that Cole wrote in response to an
editorial, Cole said the "complaint was
submitted over two years after the alleged
offense; accounts from other students
that might have supported that of the
woman involved were inconsistent in im
portant respects and could not be used
against the alleged rapist."
Pamela says these details enabled
people to identify her and violated her
rights of confidentiality. Most of all,
Pamela does not consider Cole's letter
factual.
Lack of victim's rights
Throughout the process of reporting,
Pamela discovered that she had no rights
spelled out in the "Regulations Governing
Student Conduct and Procedures for
Their Enforcement," the University's
guidelines for student behavior.
The guidelines make no mention of the
rights of a student reporting an alleged
crime.
However, Cole says she now sees the
need for a statement of the rights of
victims. "Sexual Assault on Campus:
What Colleges Can Do" outlines possible
rights of victims, and Cole says she ac
cepts these.
Rights in this book, published by the
Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center,
include the right of victims to have a
person or persons accompany them
throughout the disciplinary hearing, the
right not to have irrelevant past sexual
history discussed during the hearing, and
the right to suggest an appropriate
penalty if the accused is found guilty.
In preparing to testify for the Univer
sity Task Force on Sexual Assault, Cole
learned of three more rights that could
be defined: the right to be present at the
hearing, the right not to answer direct
questions from the accused, and the right
to be immune from punishment of "les
ser" crimes such as underage drinking.
While the University guidelines include
no rights for the victim, they do list 12
specific rights of the accused, including
the right "to confront any witnesses

before the Hearing Officer."
The guidelines are "outdated" and spe
cific changes to them should be made,
Cole says. The document was written in
1968, when the University was in the
midst of anti-war protests and campus
disruptions that violated the Fundamen
tal Standard. "In that era there was no
specific attention to sexual assault," Cole
explains.
Official condemnation needed
Among Pamela's objections to the jud
icial process, she feels the system lacks
the education it needs to handle rape
cases. "The office and Sally Cole are not
capable of dealing with rape," Pamela
says. "They are insensitive to the issue
and undereducated."
Because some University officials lack
education about the nature of acquaint
ance rape, there is a "myth that the only
real rapes are stranger-rapes," Pamela
says. This view makes acquaintance rape
seem like "regrettable sex" instead of a
felony rape, she says.
Among some University officials,
"there is definitely an idea that rape
doesn't happen here," says junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the Uni
versity Task Force on Sexual Assault.
This lack of understanding may lie in
the fact that the University has no official
policy condemning sexual assault.
Cole says there are many ways of sol
ving this problem within the judicial sys
tem, some of which she took from the
booklet "Sexual Assault on Campus."
One option could be "a presidential
statement condemning this kind of con
duct and clarifying institutional re
sponses to it," Cole says. As a matter of
"expediency," this may be the best option,
she says. Another change short of a new
policy could be a statement from the Uni
versity Task Force on Sexual Assault with
a preamble from Kennedy "so it would
have the authority of a presidential doc
ument."
The statement, however, "would have
to be used for a great deal more than
the judicial process," Cole says."I don't
think prosecution is going to be the an
swer to these problems any more than
they are the answer to discriminatory
harassment problems.
"But that doesn't mean you don't have
a policy on the books. I think that's im
portant symbolically and that's important
in an educational setting. That's different
from saying that's going to be the solu
tion," Cole explains.
According to Gail Abarbanel, co-author

of "Sexual Assault on Campus," prose
cution is a crucial element in solving the
problem of sexual assault. "The single
biggest problem is that women remain
silent. They do that because they don't
feel they get the support and action"
from the University, she says.
Other than a presidential statement
condemning rape, the University could
write an interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard that applies specifically to
sexual assault. Or it could create a sep
arate policy for such cases.
Beyond a reasonable doubt
Pamela's experience with the judicial
process highlights the problem of
evidence — such as witnesses, physical
injury and an initial police report — in
cases of acquaintance rape.
According to University regulations, a
student accused of violating the Funda
mental Standard has the right "to be
considered innocent until proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt."
According to O'Brien, however, this
standard of evidence in rape cases is dif
ficult to obtain. "Acquaintance rape is a
crime by its very nature that is one-on
one," O'Brien says.
Cole says acquaintance rape poses a
unique problem if there are conflicting
accounts from two students and no ad
ditional evidence. "We don't have a rule
prohibiting sexual intercourse," Cole
says."It seems to me that if what you
are talking about is whether there was
consent, if the disagreement about that
is primarily psychological, if it was what
was in people's heads — I can't imagine
there would be evidence that would de
termine this one way or the other," she
says.

In a case of sexual assault
where it is one person's
word against another's, I
don't think you can reach a
beyond-a-reasonable
doubt proof.'
— Sally Cole

"If what you were talking about is rape
— physical assault that is violent — then
there would have to be physical evidence
if there is nothing else. That's where the
medical profession and police come in to
record it so it can be used in prosecution,"
Cole explains.
O'Brien disagrees, explaining there is
often no physical evidence in cases of
rape. "There are no bruises, and often
the vagina isn't ripped. It's a question
of consent." Most victims of acquaintance
rapes do not fight back; they often freeze
because they trust their assailant.
Because of the combination of physical
and psychological factors involved, Cole
says,"In a case of sexual assault where
it is one person's word against another's,
I don't think you can reach a beyond-a
reasonable-doubt proof."
She adds, "I don't see that you're going
to be able under any judicial system,
whatever the standard of proof, to make
a determination of guilt."
Rape "is an extraordinarily serious al
legation that has to be provable," Cole
says, explaining that students being
charged with the crime have certain
rights that must be upheld whether or
not they are guilty.
Hoerger adds that this standard is ap
propriate, "especially when you heve a
very serious allegation. Both people's
rights and interests are important. I
wouldn't want to see someone disciplined
with the penalties you can receive in a
Fundamental Standard violation with a
lesser standard" of evidence than beyond

a reasonable doubt.
But O'Brien says this view places the
burden on the victim. "It ends up being
a woman proving she did not consent,
not the man proving he" did not rap her,
O'Brien explains.
She adds that a beyond-a-reasonable
doubt standard for evidence "is overly
stringent for everything in a university
setting, including rape."
Preponderance of evidence
Almost all universities in the country
have standards of proof less stringent
than Stanford's, including "clear-and
convincing" and "preponderance-of
evidence" standards. According to
Abarbanel, "Stanford is the only college
that we found in California and across
the country that has such a high standard
of proof."
A preponderance of evidence requires
that more than 50 percent of the evidence
be on one side, according to Hoerger. "If
the balance tips ever so slightly in favor
of one side," a preponderance of evidence
has been achieved.
O'Brien says that a preponderance-of
evidence standard should "definitely" be
looked into. For example, in some cases,
proof of rape trauma syndrome has been
admissible as evidence of assault, she ex
plains.
Most administrative proceedings —
such as those at universities and in in
ternal investigations at police depart
ments — use a preponderance-of-evidence
standard, Abarbanel adds.
But Cole says this standard of proof
is problematic. "I would be really uncom
fortable prosecuting something under
that situation — especially when the
charges you're looking at are quite se
vere," she explains.
One of the main problems, according
to University Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan, is the difficult position that the
Judicial Affairs officer is placed in when
deciding whether there is enough
evidence for a case.
"It's very hard to give someone in that
position enough evidence," Kaplan ex
plains. "Why should [one person] be the
one deciding there is not enough
evidence?"
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
says he fears what he believes could hap
pen to an accused student if the standard
of evidence were not so stringent. "I don't
take lightly people's pretty fundamental
rights of being a student," Lyons says.
"I don't think I'd ever want Stanford to
take away a student's rights."
Because of this problem of evidence in
sexual assault cases, Lyons says,"It may
be that the judicial process cannot be the
only response."
He adds, however, that he does not
know where that leaves the victim. "One
of the ingredients is that sense of per
sonally having been violated or betrayed,"
Lyons explains. "That's an emotion that
isn't well-satisfied in the judicial proc
ess."
The lasting effect
Pamela's alleged assailant is now in
the process of becoming a licensed
gynecologist, and his record remains un
stained. According to Pamela, two stu
dents have filed charges of sexual
harassment against him with the Uni
versity. She also says she knows of one
woman who says the same man has at
tempted to rape her.
Pamela explains: "The difference be
tween Cole's statement and her actions
send a clear message to me and the Stan
ford community: Rape survivors cannot
expect action from the Judicial Affairs
Office, and those who rape can expect to
get away with it."

very serious allegation. Both people's
rights and interests are important. I
wouldn't want to see someone disciplined
with the penalties you can receive in a
Fundamental Standard violation with a
lesser standard" of evidence than beyond

a reasonable doubt.
But O'Brien says this view places the
burden on the victim. "It ends up being
a woman proving she did not consent,
not the man proving he" did not rap her,
O'Brien explains.
She adds that a beyond-a-reasonable
doubt standard for evidence "is overly
stringent for everything in a university
setting, including rape."
Preponderance of evidence
Almost all universities in the country
have standards of proof less stringent
than Stanford's, including "clear-and
convincing" and "preponderance-of
evidence" standards. According to
Abarbanel, "Stanford is the only college
that we found in California and across
the country that has such a high standard
of proof."
A preponderance of evidence requires
that more than 50 percent of the evidence
be on one side, according to Hoerger. "If
the balance tips ever so slightly in favor
of one side," a preponderance of evidence
has been achieved.
O'Brien says that a preponderance-of
evidence standard should "definitely" be
looked into. For example, in some cases,
proof of rape trauma syndrome has been
admissible as evidence of assault, she ex
plains.
Most administrative proceedings —
such as those at universities and in in
ternal investigations at police depart
ments — use a preponderance-of-evidence
standard, Abarbanel adds.
But Cole says this standard of proof
is problematic. "I would be really uncom
fortable prosecuting something under
that situation — especially when the
charges you're looking at are quite se
vere," she explains.
One of the main problems, according
to University Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan, is the difficult position that the
Judicial Affairs officer is placed in when
deciding whether there is enough
evidence for a case.
"It's very hard to give someone in that
position enough evidence," Kaplan ex
plains. "Why should [one person] be the
one deciding there is not enough
evidence?"
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
says he fears what he believes could hap
pen to an accused student if the standard
of evidence were not so stringent. "I don't
take lightly people's pretty fundamental
rights of being a student," Lyons says.
"I don't think I'd ever want Stanford to
take away a student's rights."
Because of this problem of evidence in
sexual assault cases, Lyons says,"It may
be that the judicial process cannot be the
only response."
He adds, however, that he does not
know where that leaves the victim. "One
of the ingredients is that sense of per
sonally having been violated or betrayed,"
Lyons explains. "That's an emotion that
isn't well-satisfied in the judicial proc
ess."
The lasting effect
Pamela's alleged assailant is now in
the process of becoming a licensed
gynecologist, and his record remains un
stained. According to Pamela, two stu
dents have filed charges of sexual
harassment against him with the Uni
versity. She also says she knows of one
woman who says the same man has at
tempted to rape her.
Pamela explains: "The difference be
tween Cole's statement and her actions
send a clear message to me and the Stan
ford community: Rape survivors cannot
expect action from the Judicial Affairs
Office, and those who rape can expect to
get away with it."

Tomorrow: Why some victims don't report
rape.

When "Pamela" was a freshman here,
a male medical student often hung
around her dormitory and ate meals in
the dorm dining hall. When she and a
female friend went on a double date with
him and a friend of his, Pamela had no
idea the medical student would rape her.
Later that evening, he made sexual
advances toward her, despite her at
tempts to push him away. Finally, he
pushed her to the ground violently and
got on top of her. Pamela says she was
shocked and felt afraid for her life.
She repeatedly told him, "No, don't
do this."
She froze, and he raped her. At first
she did not know what to do, she says.
For the rest of the academic year,
Pamela tried to deny that she was raped.
"I hadn't thought through what hap
pened to me," she says in retrospect.
After the rape, Pamela became de
pressed and with drew from others. "I
was afraid of being alone, but I was
afraid of meeting new people," she
recalls. "I lost confidence in my ability
to judge people, so I became really de
pendent on one or two people."
Frightened and confused, she decided
to stop out for a year to get away from
the campus where she was raped. During
her year away, she had nightmares about
her sisters being raped by the same stu
dent who raped her, and she had fears
of being gang raped. She then went to
a rape treatment center.

Pamela decided to report her rape to
the University's .Judicial Affairs Office.
Her experience with the office reveals
that the system is plagued by blind spots
that ignore the unique nature of rape
and ultimately harm the victim.
These shortcomings include a lack of
sensitivity for the victim and a neglect
of the victim's rights, absence of an of
ficial University condemnation of rape,
and a standard of evidence for prosecu

tion that is more stringent than that of
most universities.
When she returned to Stanford after
a year, Pamela had no intention of
reporting the incident to Judicial Affairs
— until she learned that the alleged
rapist had plans to become a
gynecologist. Pamela then called several
groups, including Counseling and Psy
chological Services, the Bridge, the
School of Medicine, the ombudsperson
and Residential Education. She says
everyone she talked to told her to call
someone else.
"No one had any knowledge of any
sort of protocol," Pamela recalls.
According to Pamela, the dean of the
Medical School set up a meeting with
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole. At
the meeting, Pamela related the incident
to a representative of the Medical School,
Cole and Susan Hoerger, senior counsel
for the University.
Although each person other than
Pamela at the meeting was accompanied
by legal counsel, Pamela says no one
ever raised the issue of her legal rights
or her right to have an advocate at the
meeting.
Most of the questions during the meet
ing focused on irrelevant details of the
evening rather than the details of the
rape, according to Pamela.
"They asked me, 'Why are you report
ing this now?' and 'Why did you wait
so long before reporting it?' They
weren't educated or trained to under
stand acquaintance rape."

At the end of the meeting, Pamela
asked what her rights were and what
would happen next. "They just looked at
me blankly," she says. Pamela says she
had gone into the meeting hoping to
prevent the man from raping other
women and future patients. But when
she left the meeting she felt "judged and
disappointed."
A right to protection?
More than a week passed, and Pamela
heard nothing from Judicial Affairs. On
her own initiative, she called Cole's office
and left a message.
About a week later, the male student
called her, immediately after Cole had
informed him of Pamela's allegations.
Pamela told him not to call her again
and hung up.
"They didn't tell me when my alleged
assailant would be notified," Pamela says.
"I was afraid for my life," she remem
bers.
She then called the police, Res Ed and
Cole. "I wanted [Cole) to make it clear
to him not to call me," Pamela recalls.
In most cases, residence deans can
prohibit contact between the victim and
the alleged assailant immediately after
reporting the incident. "We often take
very fast administrative action to protect
the student in a variety of ways," Cole
explains.
These actions are outside of the judicial
process. But this action was not taken
in Pamela's case, and Cole did not suggest
that she talk to a residence dean.
Over the summer, Cole contacted
Pamela at her home and told her she
had given Pamela's phone number to the
alleged assailant's attorney, Pamela says.
Pamela was frightened that the attorney
would call. "[Cole] should have gotten
my consent before giving out my num
ber."
However, Cole says she did not and
would not give out the phone number of
a victim, but she also cannot prevent
contact.
The waiting game
After the initial encounter with Judicial
Affairs, the quarter went by, and Pamela
heard nothing from Judicial Affairs. "I
was just waiting — I think that was the
hardest part [of the reporting process]
for me," Pamela says.
Pamela was never informed of the
status of her case. Every step of the
process, Pamela says, she had to take
the initiative and find out what should
be done next. During this waiting period,
Pamela thought about dropping the case.
Pamela says that during this time she
feared for her life because the alleged
assailant was still at Stanford. "This proc
ess was unfair. Long periods of time had
passed without any contact. I cooperated
in every way and yet [Cole] said it was
not enough," Pamela says.
Cole handled this case as if it were
only a case of plagiarism rather than a
felony, Pamela says. Pamela also feared
for the safety of others.
According to Cole, the judicial process
in the case took time because of the large
number of people involved, including the
attorney of the accused. Cole says she
explained this fact to Pamela at the initial
meeting.
Cole, however, says she is "not com
fortable" commenting on this case be
cause of a grievance that has been filed
against her by another student, alleging
that Cole violated the right to privacy of
a complainant in a rape case.
At the end of summer, Cole unexpec
tedly called Pamela to tell her that she
had decided to close the case without
filing a charge and that Pamela had three
hours to provide evidence to convince her
otherwise, Pamela says.
This was only the second time Cole

had contacted Pamela during the five
month process.
A phone conference between the Uni
versity, Pamela and her legal advisers
was set up. But Cole had already made
up her mind and she closed the case that
day, Pamela says.
"In essence I was victimized twice: first
by the rapist and then by Stanford's lack
of action," she says.
Last month, Cole brought the case to
the public. In a Jan. 19 letter to The
Daily that Cole wrote in response to an
editorial, Cole said the "complaint was
submitted over two years after the alleged
offense; accounts from other students
that might have supported that of the
woman involved were inconsistent in im
portant respects and could not be used
against the alleged rapist."
Pamela says these details enabled
people to identify her and violated her
rights of confidentiality. Most of all,
Pamela does not consider Cole's letter
factual.
Lack of victim's rights
Throughout the process of reporting,
Pamela discovered that she had no rights
spelled out in the "Regulations Governing
Student Conduct and Procedures for
Their Enforcement," the University's
guidelines for student behavior.
The guidelines make no mention of the
rights of a student reporting an alleged
crime.
However, Cole says she now sees the
need for a statement of the rights of
victims. "Sexual Assault on Campus:
What Colleges Can Do" outlines possible
rights of victims, and Cole says she ac
cepts these.
Rights in this book, published by the
Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center,
include the right of victims to have a
person or persons accompany them
throughout the disciplinary hearing, the
right not to have irrelevant past sexual
history discussed during the hearing, and
the right to suggest an appropriate
penalty if the accused is found guilty.
In preparing to testify for the Univer
sity Task Force on Sexual Assault, Cole
learned of three more rights that could
be defined: the right to be present at the
hearing, the right not to answer direct
questions from the accused, and the right
to be immune from punishment of "les
ser" crimes such as underage drinking.
While the University guidelines include
no rights for the victim, they do list 12
specific rights of the accused, including
the right "to confront any witnesses

before the Hearing Officer."
The guidelines are "outdated" and spe
cific changes to them should be made,
Cole says. The document was written in
1968, when the University was in the
midst of anti-war protests and campus
disruptions that violated the Fundamen
tal Standard. "In that era there was no
specific attention to sexual assault," Cole
explains.
Official condemnation needed
Among Pamela's objections to the jud
icial process, she feels the system lacks
the education it needs to handle rape
cases. "The office and Sally Cole are not
capable of dealing with rape," Pamela
says. "They are insensitive to the issue
and undereducated."
Because some University officials lack
education about the nature of acquaint
ance rape, there is a "myth that the only
real rapes are stranger-rapes," Pamela
says. This view makes acquaintance rape
seem like "regrettable sex" instead of a
felony rape, she says.
Among some University officials,
"there is definitely an idea that rape
doesn't happen here," says junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the Uni
versity Task Force on Sexual Assault.
This lack of understanding may lie in
the fact that the University has no official
policy condemning sexual assault.
Cole says there are many ways of sol
ving this problem within the judicial sys
tem, some of which she took from the
booklet "Sexual Assault on Campus."
One option could be "a presidential
statement condemning this kind of con
duct and clarifying institutional re
sponses to it," Cole says. As a matter of
"expediency," this may be the best option,
she says. Another change short of a new
policy could be a statement from the Uni
versity Task Force on Sexual Assault with
a preamble from Kennedy "so it would
have the authority of a presidential doc
ument."
The statement, however, "would have
to be used for a great deal more than
the judicial process," Cole says."I don't
think prosecution is going to be the an
swer to these problems any more than
they are the answer to discriminatory
harassment problems.
"But that doesn't mean you don't have
a policy on the books. I think that's im
portant symbolically and that's important
in an educational setting. That's different
from saying that's going to be the solu
tion," Cole explains.
According to Gail Abarbanel, co-author

of "Sexual Assault on Campus," prose
cution is a crucial element in solving the
problem of sexual assault. "The single
biggest problem is that women remain
silent. They do that because they don't
feel they get the support and action"
from the University, she says.
Other than a presidential statement
condemning rape, the University could
write an interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard that applies specifically to
sexual assault. Or it could create a sep
arate policy for such cases.
Beyond a reasonable doubt
Pamela's experience with the judicial
process highlights the problem of
evidence — such as witnesses, physical
injury and an initial police report — in
cases of acquaintance rape.
According to University regulations, a
student accused of violating the Funda
mental Standard has the right "to be
considered innocent until proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt."
According to O'Brien, however, this
standard of evidence in rape cases is dif
ficult to obtain. "Acquaintance rape is a
crime by its very nature that is one-on
one," O'Brien says.
Cole says acquaintance rape poses a
unique problem if there are conflicting
accounts from two students and no ad
ditional evidence. "We don't have a rule
prohibiting sexual intercourse," Cole
says."It seems to me that if what you
are talking about is whether there was
consent, if the disagreement about that
is primarily psychological, if it was what
was in people's heads — I can't imagine
there would be evidence that would de
termine this one way or the other," she
says.

In a case of sexual assault
where it is one person's
word against another's, I
don't think you can reach a
beyond-a-reasonable
doubt proof.'
— Sally Cole

"If what you were talking about is rape
— physical assault that is violent — then
there would have to be physical evidence
if there is nothing else. That's where the
medical profession and police come in to
record it so it can be used in prosecution,"
Cole explains.
O'Brien disagrees, explaining there is
often no physical evidence in cases of
rape. "There are no bruises, and often
the vagina isn't ripped. It's a question
of consent." Most victims of acquaintance
rapes do not fight back; they often freeze
because they trust their assailant.
Because of the combination of physical
and psychological factors involved, Cole
says,"In a case of sexual assault where
it is one person's word against another's,
I don't think you can reach a beyond-a
reasonable-doubt proof."
She adds, "I don't see that you're going
to be able under any judicial system,
whatever the standard of proof, to make
a determination of guilt."
Rape "is an extraordinarily serious al
legation that has to be provable," Cole
says, explaining that students being
charged with the crime have certain
rights that must be upheld whether or
not they are guilty.
Hoerger adds that this standard is ap
propriate, "especially when you heve a
very serious allegation. Both people's
rights and interests are important. I
wouldn't want to see someone disciplined
with the penalties you can receive in a
Fundamental Standard violation with a
lesser standard" of evidence than beyond

a reasonable doubt.
But O'Brien says this view places the
burden on the victim. "It ends up being
a woman proving she did not consent,
not the man proving he" did not rap her,
O'Brien explains.
She adds that a beyond-a-reasonable
doubt standard for evidence "is overly
stringent for everything in a university
setting, including rape."
Preponderance of evidence
Almost all universities in the country
have standards of proof less stringent
than Stanford's, including "clear-and
convincing" and "preponderance-of
evidence" standards. According to
Abarbanel, "Stanford is the only college
that we found in California and across
the country that has such a high standard
of proof."
A preponderance of evidence requires
that more than 50 percent of the evidence
be on one side, according to Hoerger. "If
the balance tips ever so slightly in favor
of one side," a preponderance of evidence
has been achieved.
O'Brien says that a preponderance-of
evidence standard should "definitely" be
looked into. For example, in some cases,
proof of rape trauma syndrome has been
admissible as evidence of assault, she ex
plains.
Most administrative proceedings —
such as those at universities and in in
ternal investigations at police depart
ments — use a preponderance-of-evidence
standard, Abarbanel adds.
But Cole says this standard of proof
is problematic. "I would be really uncom
fortable prosecuting something under
that situation — especially when the
charges you're looking at are quite se
vere," she explains.
One of the main problems, according
to University Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan, is the difficult position that the
Judicial Affairs officer is placed in when
deciding whether there is enough
evidence for a case.
"It's very hard to give someone in that
position enough evidence," Kaplan ex
plains. "Why should [one person] be the

to be used for a great deal more than
the judicial process," Cole says."I don't
think prosecution is going to be the an
swer to these problems any more than
they are the answer to discriminatory
harassment problems.
"But that doesn't mean you don't have
a policy on the books. I think that's im
portant symbolically and that's important
in an educational setting. That's different
from saying that's going to be the solu
tion," Cole explains.
According to Gail Abarbanel, co-author

of "Sexual Assault on Campus," prose
cution is a crucial element in solving the
problem of sexual assault. "The single
biggest problem is that women remain
silent. They do that because they don't
feel they get the support and action"
from the University, she says.
Other than a presidential statement
condemning rape, the University could
write an interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard that applies specifically to
sexual assault. Or it could create a sep
arate policy for such cases.
Beyond a reasonable doubt
Pamela's experience with the judicial
process highlights the problem of
evidence — such as witnesses, physical
injury and an initial police report — in
cases of acquaintance rape.
According to University regulations, a
student accused of violating the Funda
mental Standard has the right "to be
considered innocent until proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt."
According to O'Brien, however, this
standard of evidence in rape cases is dif
ficult to obtain. "Acquaintance rape is a
crime by its very nature that is one-on
one," O'Brien says.
Cole says acquaintance rape poses a
unique problem if there are conflicting
accounts from two students and no ad
ditional evidence. "We don't have a rule
prohibiting sexual intercourse," Cole
says."It seems to me that if what you
are talking about is whether there was
consent, if the disagreement about that
is primarily psychological, if it was what
was in people's heads — I can't imagine
there would be evidence that would de
termine this one way or the other," she
says.

In a case of sexual assault
where it is one person's
word against another's, I
don't think you can reach a
beyond-a-reasonable
doubt proof.'
— Sally Cole

"If what you were talking about is rape
— physical assault that is violent — then
there would have to be physical evidence
if there is nothing else. That's where the
medical profession and police come in to
record it so it can be used in prosecution,"
Cole explains.
O'Brien disagrees, explaining there is
often no physical evidence in cases of
rape. "There are no bruises, and often
the vagina isn't ripped. It's a question
of consent." Most victims of acquaintance
rapes do not fight back; they often freeze
because they trust their assailant.
Because of the combination of physical
and psychological factors involved, Cole
says,"In a case of sexual assault where
it is one person's word against another's,
I don't think you can reach a beyond-a
reasonable-doubt proof."
She adds, "I don't see that you're going
to be able under any judicial system,
whatever the standard of proof, to make
a determination of guilt."
Rape "is an extraordinarily serious al
legation that has to be provable," Cole
says, explaining that students being
charged with the crime have certain
rights that must be upheld whether or
not they are guilty.
Hoerger adds that this standard is ap
propriate, "especially when you heve a
very serious allegation. Both people's
rights and interests are important. I
wouldn't want to see someone disciplined
with the penalties you can receive in a
Fundamental Standard violation with a
lesser standard" of evidence than beyond

a reasonable doubt.
But O'Brien says this view places the
burden on the victim. "It ends up being
a woman proving she did not consent,
not the man proving he" did not rap her,
O'Brien explains.
She adds that a beyond-a-reasonable
doubt standard for evidence "is overly
stringent for everything in a university
setting, including rape."
Preponderance of evidence
Almost all universities in the country
have standards of proof less stringent
than Stanford's, including "clear-and
convincing" and "preponderance-of
evidence" standards. According to
Abarbanel, "Stanford is the only college
that we found in California and across
the country that has such a high standard
of proof."
A preponderance of evidence requires
that more than 50 percent of the evidence
be on one side, according to Hoerger. "If
the balance tips ever so slightly in favor
of one side," a preponderance of evidence
has been achieved.
O'Brien says that a preponderance-of
evidence standard should "definitely" be
looked into. For example, in some cases,
proof of rape trauma syndrome has been
admissible as evidence of assault, she ex
plains.
Most administrative proceedings —
such as those at universities and in in
ternal investigations at police depart
ments — use a preponderance-of-evidence
standard, Abarbanel adds.
But Cole says this standard of proof
is problematic. "I would be really uncom
fortable prosecuting something under
that situation — especially when the
charges you're looking at are quite se
vere," she explains.
One of the main problems, according
to University Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan, is the difficult position that the
Judicial Affairs officer is placed in when
deciding whether there is enough
evidence for a case.
"It's very hard to give someone in that
position enough evidence," Kaplan ex
plains. "Why should [one person] be the
one deciding there is not enough
evidence?"
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
says he fears what he believes could hap
pen to an accused student if the standard
of evidence were not so stringent. "I don't
take lightly people's pretty fundamental
rights of being a student," Lyons says.
"I don't think I'd ever want Stanford to
take away a student's rights."
Because of this problem of evidence in
sexual assault cases, Lyons says,"It may
be that the judicial process cannot be the
only response."
He adds, however, that he does not
know where that leaves the victim. "One
of the ingredients is that sense of per
sonally having been violated or betrayed,"
Lyons explains. "That's an emotion that
isn't well-satisfied in the judicial proc
ess."
The lasting effect
Pamela's alleged assailant is now in
the process of becoming a licensed
gynecologist, and his record remains un
stained. According to Pamela, two stu
dents have filed charges of sexual
harassment against him with the Uni
versity. She also says she knows of one
woman who says the same man has at
tempted to rape her.
Pamela explains: "The difference be
tween Cole's statement and her actions
send a clear message to me and the Stan
ford community: Rape survivors cannot
expect action from the Judicial Affairs
Office, and those who rape can expect to
get away with it."

Tomorrow: Why some victims don't report
rape.

When "Pamela" was a freshman here,
a male medical student often hung
around her dormitory and ate meals in
the dorm dining hall. When she and a
female friend went on a double date with
him and a friend of his, Pamela had no
idea the medical student would rape her.
Later that evening, he made sexual
advances toward her, despite her at
tempts to push him away. Finally, he
pushed her to the ground violently and
got on top of her. Pamela says she was
shocked and felt afraid for her life.
She repeatedly told him, "No, don't
do this."
She froze, and he raped her. At first
she did not know what to do, she says.
For the rest of the academic year,
Pamela tried to deny that she was raped.
"I hadn't thought through what hap
pened to me," she says in retrospect.
After the rape, Pamela became de
pressed and with drew from others. "I
was afraid of being alone, but I was
afraid of meeting new people," she
recalls. "I lost confidence in my ability
to judge people, so I became really de
pendent on one or two people."
Frightened and confused, she decided
to stop out for a year to get away from
the campus where she was raped. During
her year away, she had nightmares about
her sisters being raped by the same stu
dent who raped her, and she had fears
of being gang raped. She then went to
a rape treatment center.

Pamela decided to report her rape to
the University's .Judicial Affairs Office.
Her experience with the office reveals
that the system is plagued by blind spots
that ignore the unique nature of rape
and ultimately harm the victim.
These shortcomings include a lack of
sensitivity for the victim and a neglect
of the victim's rights, absence of an of
ficial University condemnation of rape,
and a standard of evidence for prosecu

tion that is more stringent than that of
most universities.
When she returned to Stanford after
a year, Pamela had no intention of
reporting the incident to Judicial Affairs
— until she learned that the alleged
rapist had plans to become a
gynecologist. Pamela then called several
groups, including Counseling and Psy
chological Services, the Bridge, the
School of Medicine, the ombudsperson
and Residential Education. She says
everyone she talked to told her to call
someone else.
"No one had any knowledge of any
sort of protocol," Pamela recalls.
According to Pamela, the dean of the
Medical School set up a meeting with
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole. At
the meeting, Pamela related the incident
to a representative of the Medical School,
Cole and Susan Hoerger, senior counsel
for the University.
Although each person other than
Pamela at the meeting was accompanied
by legal counsel, Pamela says no one
ever raised the issue of her legal rights
or her right to have an advocate at the
meeting.
Most of the questions during the meet
ing focused on irrelevant details of the
evening rather than the details of the
rape, according to Pamela.
"They asked me, 'Why are you report
ing this now?' and 'Why did you wait
so long before reporting it?' They
weren't educated or trained to under
stand acquaintance rape."

At the end of the meeting, Pamela
asked what her rights were and what
would happen next. "They just looked at
me blankly," she says. Pamela says she
had gone into the meeting hoping to
prevent the man from raping other
women and future patients. But when
she left the meeting she felt "judged and
disappointed."
A right to protection?
More than a week passed, and Pamela
heard nothing from Judicial Affairs. On
her own initiative, she called Cole's office
and left a message.
About a week later, the male student
called her, immediately after Cole had
informed him of Pamela's allegations.
Pamela told him not to call her again
and hung up.
"They didn't tell me when my alleged
assailant would be notified," Pamela says.
"I was afraid for my life," she remem
bers.
She then called the police, Res Ed and
Cole. "I wanted [Cole) to make it clear
to him not to call me," Pamela recalls.
In most cases, residence deans can
prohibit contact between the victim and
the alleged assailant immediately after
reporting the incident. "We often take
very fast administrative action to protect
the student in a variety of ways," Cole
explains.
These actions are outside of the judicial
process. But this action was not taken
in Pamela's case, and Cole did not suggest
that she talk to a residence dean.
Over the summer, Cole contacted
Pamela at her home and told her she
had given Pamela's phone number to the
alleged assailant's attorney, Pamela says.
Pamela was frightened that the attorney
would call. "[Cole] should have gotten
my consent before giving out my num
ber."
However, Cole says she did not and
would not give out the phone number of
a victim, but she also cannot prevent
contact.
The waiting game
After the initial encounter with Judicial
Affairs, the quarter went by, and Pamela
heard nothing from Judicial Affairs. "I
was just waiting — I think that was the
hardest part [of the reporting process]
for me," Pamela says.
Pamela was never informed of the
status of her case. Every step of the
process, Pamela says, she had to take
the initiative and find out what should
be done next. During this waiting period,
Pamela thought about dropping the case.
Pamela says that during this time she
feared for her life because the alleged
assailant was still at Stanford. "This proc
ess was unfair. Long periods of time had
passed without any contact. I cooperated
in every way and yet [Cole] said it was
not enough," Pamela says.
Cole handled this case as if it were
only a case of plagiarism rather than a
felony, Pamela says. Pamela also feared
for the safety of others.
According to Cole, the judicial process
in the case took time because of the large
number of people involved, including the
attorney of the accused. Cole says she
explained this fact to Pamela at the initial
meeting.
Cole, however, says she is "not com
fortable" commenting on this case be
cause of a grievance that has been filed
against her by another student, alleging
that Cole violated the right to privacy of
a complainant in a rape case.
At the end of summer, Cole unexpec
tedly called Pamela to tell her that she
had decided to close the case without
filing a charge and that Pamela had three
hours to provide evidence to convince her
otherwise, Pamela says.
This was only the second time Cole

had contacted Pamela during the five
month process.
A phone conference between the Uni
versity, Pamela and her legal advisers
was set up. But Cole had already made
up her mind and she closed the case that
day, Pamela says.
"In essence I was victimized twice: first
by the rapist and then by Stanford's lack
of action," she says.
Last month, Cole brought the case to
the public. In a Jan. 19 letter to The
Daily that Cole wrote in response to an
editorial, Cole said the "complaint was
submitted over two years after the alleged
offense; accounts from other students
that might have supported that of the
woman involved were inconsistent in im
portant respects and could not be used
against the alleged rapist."
Pamela says these details enabled
people to identify her and violated her
rights of confidentiality. Most of all,
Pamela does not consider Cole's letter
factual.
Lack of victim's rights
Throughout the process of reporting,
Pamela discovered that she had no rights
spelled out in the "Regulations Governing
Student Conduct and Procedures for
Their Enforcement," the University's
guidelines for student behavior.
The guidelines make no mention of the
rights of a student reporting an alleged
crime.
However, Cole says she now sees the
need for a statement of the rights of
victims. "Sexual Assault on Campus:
What Colleges Can Do" outlines possible
rights of victims, and Cole says she ac
cepts these.
Rights in this book, published by the
Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center,
include the right of victims to have a
person or persons accompany them
throughout the disciplinary hearing, the
right not to have irrelevant past sexual
history discussed during the hearing, and
the right to suggest an appropriate
penalty if the accused is found guilty.
In preparing to testify for the Univer
sity Task Force on Sexual Assault, Cole
learned of three more rights that could
be defined: the right to be present at the
hearing, the right not to answer direct
questions from the accused, and the right
to be immune from punishment of "les
ser" crimes such as underage drinking.
While the University guidelines include
no rights for the victim, they do list 12
specific rights of the accused, including
the right "to confront any witnesses

before the Hearing Officer."
The guidelines are "outdated" and spe
cific changes to them should be made,
Cole says. The document was written in
1968, when the University was in the
midst of anti-war protests and campus
disruptions that violated the Fundamen
tal Standard. "In that era there was no
specific attention to sexual assault," Cole
explains.
Official condemnation needed
Among Pamela's objections to the jud
icial process, she feels the system lacks
the education it needs to handle rape
cases. "The office and Sally Cole are not
capable of dealing with rape," Pamela
says. "They are insensitive to the issue
and undereducated."
Because some University officials lack
education about the nature of acquaint
ance rape, there is a "myth that the only
real rapes are stranger-rapes," Pamela
says. This view makes acquaintance rape
seem like "regrettable sex" instead of a
felony rape, she says.
Among some University officials,
"there is definitely an idea that rape
doesn't happen here," says junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the Uni
versity Task Force on Sexual Assault.
This lack of understanding may lie in
the fact that the University has no official
policy condemning sexual assault.
Cole says there are many ways of sol
ving this problem within the judicial sys
tem, some of which she took from the
booklet "Sexual Assault on Campus."
One option could be "a presidential
statement condemning this kind of con
duct and clarifying institutional re
sponses to it," Cole says. As a matter of
"expediency," this may be the best option,
she says. Another change short of a new
policy could be a statement from the Uni
versity Task Force on Sexual Assault with
a preamble from Kennedy "so it would
have the authority of a presidential doc
ument."
The statement, however, "would have
to be used for a great deal more than
the judicial process," Cole says."I don't
think prosecution is going to be the an
swer to these problems any more than
they are the answer to discriminatory
harassment problems.
"But that doesn't mean you don't have
a policy on the books. I think that's im
portant symbolically and that's important
in an educational setting. That's different
from saying that's going to be the solu
tion," Cole explains.
According to Gail Abarbanel, co-author

of "Sexual Assault on Campus," prose
cution is a crucial element in solving the
problem of sexual assault. "The single
biggest problem is that women remain
silent. They do that because they don't
feel they get the support and action"
from the University, she says.
Other than a presidential statement
condemning rape, the University could
write an interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard that applies specifically to
sexual assault. Or it could create a sep
arate policy for such cases.
Beyond a reasonable doubt
Pamela's experience with the judicial
process highlights the problem of
evidence — such as witnesses, physical
injury and an initial police report — in
cases of acquaintance rape.
According to University regulations, a
student accused of violating the Funda
mental Standard has the right "to be
considered innocent until proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt."
According to O'Brien, however, this
standard of evidence in rape cases is dif
ficult to obtain. "Acquaintance rape is a
crime by its very nature that is one-on

Cole says acquaintance rape poses a
unique problem if there are conflicting
accounts from two students and no ad
ditional evidence. "We don't have a rule
prohibiting sexual intercourse," Cole
says."It seems to me that if what you

says.

"If what you were talking about is rape
— physical assault that is violent — then
there would have to be physical evidence
if there is nothing else. That's where the

Cole explains.
O'Brien disagrees, explaining there is

have standards of proof less stringent

Abarbanel, "Stanford is the only college

A preponderance of evidence requires

submitted over two years after the alleged
offense; accounts from other students
that might have supported that of the
woman involved were inconsistent in im
portant respects and could not be used
against the alleged rapist."
Pamela says these details enabled
people to identify her and violated her
rights of confidentiality. Most of all,
Pamela does not consider Cole's letter
factual.
Lack of victim's rights
Throughout the process of reporting,
Pamela discovered that she had no rights
spelled out in the "Regulations Governing
Student Conduct and Procedures for
Their Enforcement," the University's
guidelines for student behavior.
The guidelines make no mention of the
rights of a student reporting an alleged
crime.
However, Cole says she now sees the
need for a statement of the rights of
victims. "Sexual Assault on Campus:
What Colleges Can Do" outlines possible
rights of victims, and Cole says she ac
cepts these.
Rights in this book, published by the
Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center,
include the right of victims to have a
person or persons accompany them
throughout the disciplinary hearing, the
right not to have irrelevant past sexual
history discussed during the hearing, and
the right to suggest an appropriate
penalty if the accused is found guilty.
In preparing to testify for the Univer
sity Task Force on Sexual Assault, Cole
learned of three more rights that could
be defined: the right to be present at the
hearing, the right not to answer direct
questions from the accused, and the right
to be immune from punishment of "les
ser" crimes such as underage drinking.
While the University guidelines include
no rights for the victim, they do list 12
specific rights of the accused, including
the right "to confront any witnesses

before the Hearing Officer."
The guidelines are "outdated" and spe
cific changes to them should be made,
Cole says. The document was written in
1968, when the University was in the
midst of anti-war protests and campus
disruptions that violated the Fundamen
tal Standard. "In that era there was no
specific attention to sexual assault," Cole
explains.
Official condemnation needed
Among Pamela's objections to the jud
icial process, she feels the system lacks
the education it needs to handle rape
cases. "The office and Sally Cole are not
capable of dealing with rape," Pamela
says. "They are insensitive to the issue
and undereducated."
Because some University officials lack
education about the nature of acquaint
ance rape, there is a "myth that the only
real rapes are stranger-rapes," Pamela
says. This view makes acquaintance rape
seem like "regrettable sex" instead of a
felony rape, she says.
Among some University officials,
"there is definitely an idea that rape
doesn't happen here," says junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the Uni
versity Task Force on Sexual Assault.
This lack of understanding may lie in
the fact that the University has no official
policy condemning sexual assault.
Cole says there are many ways of sol
ving this problem within the judicial sys
tem, some of which she took from the
booklet "Sexual Assault on Campus."
One option could be "a presidential
statement condemning this kind of con
duct and clarifying institutional re
sponses to it," Cole says. As a matter of
"expediency," this may be the best option,
she says. Another change short of a new
policy could be a statement from the Uni
versity Task Force on Sexual Assault with
a preamble from Kennedy "so it would
have the authority of a presidential doc
ument."
The statement, however, "would have
to be used for a great deal more than
the judicial process," Cole says."I don't
think prosecution is going to be the an
swer to these problems any more than
they are the answer to discriminatory
harassment problems.
"But that doesn't mean you don't have
a policy on the books. I think that's im
portant symbolically and that's important
in an educational setting. That's different
from saying that's going to be the solu
tion," Cole explains.
According to Gail Abarbanel, co-author

of "Sexual Assault on Campus," prose
cution is a crucial element in solving the
problem of sexual assault. "The single
biggest problem is that women remain
silent. They do that because they don't
feel they get the support and action"
from the University, she says.
Other than a presidential statement
condemning rape, the University could
write an interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard that applies specifically to
sexual assault. Or it could create a sep
arate policy for such cases.
Beyond a reasonable doubt
Pamela's experience with the judicial
process highlights the problem of
evidence — such as witnesses, physical
injury and an initial police report — in
cases of acquaintance rape.
According to University regulations, a
student accused of violating the Funda
mental Standard has the right "to be
considered innocent until proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt."
According to O'Brien, however, this
standard of evidence in rape cases is dif
ficult to obtain. "Acquaintance rape is a
crime by its very nature that is one-on
one," O'Brien says.
Cole says acquaintance rape poses a
unique problem if there are conflicting
accounts from two students and no ad
ditional evidence. "We don't have a rule
prohibiting sexual intercourse," Cole
says."It seems to me that if what you
are talking about is whether there was
consent, if the disagreement about that
is primarily psychological, if it was what
was in people's heads — I can't imagine
there would be evidence that would de
termine this one way or the other," she
says.

In a case of sexual assault
where it is one person's
word against another's, I
don't think you can reach a
beyond-a-reasonable
doubt proof.'
— Sally Cole

"If what you were talking about is rape
— physical assault that is violent — then
there would have to be physical evidence
if there is nothing else. That's where the
medical profession and police come in to
record it so it can be used in prosecution,"
Cole explains.
O'Brien disagrees, explaining there is
often no physical evidence in cases of
rape. "There are no bruises, and often
the vagina isn't ripped. It's a question
of consent." Most victims of acquaintance
rapes do not fight back; they often freeze
because they trust their assailant.
Because of the combination of physical
and psychological factors involved, Cole
says,"In a case of sexual assault where
it is one person's word against another's,
I don't think you can reach a beyond-a
reasonable-doubt proof."
She adds, "I don't see that you're going
to be able under any judicial system,
whatever the standard of proof, to make
a determination of guilt."
Rape "is an extraordinarily serious al
legation that has to be provable," Cole
says, explaining that students being
charged with the crime have certain
rights that must be upheld whether or
not they are guilty.
Hoerger adds that this standard is ap
propriate, "especially when you heve a
very serious allegation. Both people's
rights and interests are important. I
wouldn't want to see someone disciplined
with the penalties you can receive in a
Fundamental Standard violation with a
lesser standard" of evidence than beyond

a reasonable doubt.
But O'Brien says this view places the
burden on the victim. "It ends up being
a woman proving she did not consent,
not the man proving he" did not rap her,
O'Brien explains.
She adds that a beyond-a-reasonable
doubt standard for evidence "is overly
stringent for everything in a university
setting, including rape."
Preponderance of evidence
Almost all universities in the country
have standards of proof less stringent
than Stanford's, including "clear-and
convincing" and "preponderance-of
evidence" standards. According to
Abarbanel, "Stanford is the only college
that we found in California and across
the country that has such a high standard
of proof."
A preponderance of evidence requires
that more than 50 percent of the evidence
be on one side, according to Hoerger. "If
the balance tips ever so slightly in favor
of one side," a preponderance of evidence
has been achieved.
O'Brien says that a preponderance-of
evidence standard should "definitely" be
looked into. For example, in some cases,
proof of rape trauma syndrome has been
admissible as evidence of assault, she ex
plains.
Most administrative proceedings —
such as those at universities and in in
ternal investigations at police depart
ments — use a preponderance-of-evidence
standard, Abarbanel adds.
But Cole says this standard of proof
is problematic. "I would be really uncom
fortable prosecuting something under
that situation — especially when the
charges you're looking at are quite se
vere," she explains.
One of the main problems, according
to University Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan, is the difficult position that the
Judicial Affairs officer is placed in when
deciding whether there is enough
evidence for a case.
"It's very hard to give someone in that
position enough evidence," Kaplan ex
plains. "Why should [one person] be the
one deciding there is not enough
evidence?"
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
says he fears what he believes could hap
pen to an accused student if the standard
of evidence were not so stringent. "I don't
take lightly people's pretty fundamental
rights of being a student," Lyons says.
"I don't think I'd ever want Stanford to
take away a student's rights."
Because of this problem of evidence in
sexual assault cases, Lyons says,"It may
be that the judicial process cannot be the
only response."
He adds, however, that he does not
know where that leaves the victim. "One
of the ingredients is that sense of per
sonally having been violated or betrayed,"
Lyons explains. "That's an emotion that
isn't well-satisfied in the judicial proc
ess."
The lasting effect
Pamela's alleged assailant is now in
the process of becoming a licensed
gynecologist, and his record remains un
stained. According to Pamela, two stu
dents have filed charges of sexual
harassment against him with the Uni
versity. She also says she knows of one
woman who says the same man has at
tempted to rape her.
Pamela explains: "The difference be
tween Cole's statement and her actions
send a clear message to me and the Stan
ford community: Rape survivors cannot
expect action from the Judicial Affairs
Office, and those who rape can expect to
get away with it."

Tomorrow: Why some victims don't report
rape.

When "Pamela" was a freshman here,
a male medical student often hung
around her dormitory and ate meals in
the dorm dining hall. When she and a
female friend went on a double date with
him and a friend of his, Pamela had no
idea the medical student would rape her.
Later that evening, he made sexual
advances toward her, despite her at
tempts to push him away. Finally, he
pushed her to the ground violently and
got on top of her. Pamela says she was
shocked and felt afraid for her life.
She repeatedly told him, "No, don't
do this."
She froze, and he raped her. At first
she did not know what to do, she says.
For the rest of the academic year,
Pamela tried to deny that she was raped.
"I hadn't thought through what hap
pened to me," she says in retrospect.
After the rape, Pamela became de
pressed and with drew from others. "I
was afraid of being alone, but I was
afraid of meeting new people," she
recalls. "I lost confidence in my ability
to judge people, so I became really de
pendent on one or two people."
Frightened and confused, she decided
to stop out for a year to get away from
the campus where she was raped. During
her year away, she had nightmares about
her sisters being raped by the same stu
dent who raped her, and she had fears
of being gang raped. She then went to
a rape treatment center.

Pamela decided to report her rape to
the University's .Judicial Affairs Office.
Her experience with the office reveals
that the system is plagued by blind spots
that ignore the unique nature of rape
and ultimately harm the victim.
These shortcomings include a lack of
sensitivity for the victim and a neglect
of the victim's rights, absence of an of
ficial University condemnation of rape,
and a standard of evidence for prosecu

tion that is more stringent than that of
most universities.
When she returned to Stanford after
a year, Pamela had no intention of
reporting the incident to Judicial Affairs
— until she learned that the alleged
rapist had plans to become a
gynecologist. Pamela then called several
groups, including Counseling and Psy
chological Services, the Bridge, the
School of Medicine, the ombudsperson
and Residential Education. She says
everyone she talked to told her to call
someone else.
"No one had any knowledge of any
sort of protocol," Pamela recalls.
According to Pamela, the dean of the
Medical School set up a meeting with
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole. At
the meeting, Pamela related the incident
to a representative of the Medical School,
Cole and Susan Hoerger, senior counsel
for the University.
Although each person other than
Pamela at the meeting was accompanied
by legal counsel, Pamela says no one
ever raised the issue of her legal rights
or her right to have an advocate at the
meeting.
Most of the questions during the meet
ing focused on irrelevant details of the
evening rather than the details of the
rape, according to Pamela.
"They asked me, 'Why are you report
ing this now?' and 'Why did you wait
so long before reporting it?' They
weren't educated or trained to under
stand acquaintance rape."

At the end of the meeting, Pamela
asked what her rights were and what
would happen next. "They just looked at
me blankly," she says. Pamela says she
had gone into the meeting hoping to
prevent the man from raping other
women and future patients. But when
she left the meeting she felt "judged and
disappointed."
A right to protection?
More than a week passed, and Pamela
heard nothing from Judicial Affairs. On
her own initiative, she called Cole's office
and left a message.
About a week later, the male student
called her, immediately after Cole had
informed him of Pamela's allegations.
Pamela told him not to call her again
and hung up.
"They didn't tell me when my alleged
assailant would be notified," Pamela says.
"I was afraid for my life," she remem
bers.
She then called the police, Res Ed and
Cole. "I wanted [Cole) to make it clear
to him not to call me," Pamela recalls.
In most cases, residence deans can
prohibit contact between the victim and
the alleged assailant immediately after
reporting the incident. "We often take
very fast administrative action to protect
the student in a variety of ways," Cole
explains.
These actions are outside of the judicial
process. But this action was not taken
in Pamela's case, and Cole did not suggest
that she talk to a residence dean.
Over the summer, Cole contacted
Pamela at her home and told her she
had given Pamela's phone number to the
alleged assailant's attorney, Pamela says.
Pamela was frightened that the attorney
would call. "[Cole] should have gotten
my consent before giving out my num
ber."
However, Cole says she did not and
would not give out the phone number of
a victim, but she also cannot prevent
contact.
The waiting game
After the initial encounter with Judicial
Affairs, the quarter went by, and Pamela
heard nothing from Judicial Affairs. "I
was just waiting — I think that was the
hardest part [of the reporting process]
for me," Pamela says.
Pamela was never informed of the
status of her case. Every step of the
process, Pamela says, she had to take
the initiative and find out what should
be done next. During this waiting period,
Pamela thought about dropping the case.
Pamela says that during this time she
feared for her life because the alleged
assailant was still at Stanford. "This proc
ess was unfair. Long periods of time had
passed without any contact. I cooperated
in every way and yet [Cole] said it was
not enough," Pamela says.
Cole handled this case as if it were
only a case of plagiarism rather than a
felony, Pamela says. Pamela also feared
for the safety of others.
According to Cole, the judicial process
in the case took time because of the large
number of people involved, including the
attorney of the accused. Cole says she
explained this fact to Pamela at the initial
meeting.
Cole, however, says she is "not com
fortable" commenting on this case be
cause of a grievance that has been filed
against her by another student, alleging
that Cole violated the right to privacy of
a complainant in a rape case.
At the end of summer, Cole unexpec
tedly called Pamela to tell her that she
had decided to close the case without
filing a charge and that Pamela had three
hours to provide evidence to convince her
otherwise, Pamela says.
This was only the second time Cole

had contacted Pamela during the five
month process.
A phone conference between the Uni
versity, Pamela and her legal advisers
was set up. But Cole had already made
up her mind and she closed the case that
day, Pamela says.
"In essence I was victimized twice: first
by the rapist and then by Stanford's lack
of action," she says.
Last month, Cole brought the case to
the public. In a Jan. 19 letter to The
Daily that Cole wrote in response to an
editorial, Cole said the "complaint was
submitted over two years after the alleged
offense; accounts from other students
that might have supported that of the
woman involved were inconsistent in im
portant respects and could not be used
against the alleged rapist."
Pamela says these details enabled
people to identify her and violated her
rights of confidentiality. Most of all,
Pamela does not consider Cole's letter
factual.
Lack of victim's rights
Throughout the process of reporting,
Pamela discovered that she had no rights
spelled out in the "Regulations Governing
Student Conduct and Procedures for
Their Enforcement," the University's
guidelines for student behavior.
The guidelines make no mention of the
rights of a student reporting an alleged
crime.
However, Cole says she now sees the
need for a statement of the rights of
victims. "Sexual Assault on Campus:
What Colleges Can Do" outlines possible
rights of victims, and Cole says she ac
cepts these.
Rights in this book, published by the
Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center,
include the right of victims to have a
person or persons accompany them
throughout the disciplinary hearing, the
right not to have irrelevant past sexual
history discussed during the hearing, and
the right to suggest an appropriate
penalty if the accused is found guilty.

her own initiative, she called Cole's office
and left a message.
About a week later, the male student
called her, immediately after Cole had
informed him of Pamela's allegations.
Pamela told him not to call her again
and hung up.
"They didn't tell me when my alleged
assailant would be notified," Pamela says.
"I was afraid for my life," she remem
bers.
She then called the police, Res Ed and
Cole. "I wanted [Cole) to make it clear
to him not to call me," Pamela recalls.
In most cases, residence deans can
prohibit contact between the victim and
the alleged assailant immediately after
reporting the incident. "We often take
very fast administrative action to protect
the student in a variety of ways," Cole
explains.
These actions are outside of the judicial
process. But this action was not taken
in Pamela's case, and Cole did not suggest
that she talk to a residence dean.
Over the summer, Cole contacted
Pamela at her home and told her she
had given Pamela's phone number to the
alleged assailant's attorney, Pamela says.
Pamela was frightened that the attorney
would call. "[Cole] should have gotten
my consent before giving out my num
ber."
However, Cole says she did not and
would not give out the phone number of
a victim, but she also cannot prevent
contact.
The waiting game
After the initial encounter with Judicial
Affairs, the quarter went by, and Pamela
heard nothing from Judicial Affairs. "I
was just waiting — I think that was the
hardest part [of the reporting process]
for me," Pamela says.
Pamela was never informed of the
status of her case. Every step of the
process, Pamela says, she had to take
the initiative and find out what should
be done next. During this waiting period,
Pamela thought about dropping the case.
Pamela says that during this time she
feared for her life because the alleged
assailant was still at Stanford. "This proc
ess was unfair. Long periods of time had
passed without any contact. I cooperated
in every way and yet [Cole] said it was
not enough," Pamela says.
Cole handled this case as if it were
only a case of plagiarism rather than a
felony, Pamela says. Pamela also feared
for the safety of others.
According to Cole, the judicial process
in the case took time because of the large
number of people involved, including the
attorney of the accused. Cole says she
explained this fact to Pamela at the initial
meeting.
Cole, however, says she is "not com
fortable" commenting on this case be
cause of a grievance that has been filed
against her by another student, alleging
that Cole violated the right to privacy of
a complainant in a rape case.
At the end of summer, Cole unexpec
tedly called Pamela to tell her that she
had decided to close the case without
filing a charge and that Pamela had three
hours to provide evidence to convince her
otherwise, Pamela says.
This was only the second time Cole

had contacted Pamela during the five
month process.
A phone conference between the Uni
versity, Pamela and her legal advisers
was set up. But Cole had already made
up her mind and she closed the case that
day, Pamela says.
"In essence I was victimized twice: first
by the rapist and then by Stanford's lack
of action," she says.
Last month, Cole brought the case to
the public. In a Jan. 19 letter to The
Daily that Cole wrote in response to an
editorial, Cole said the "complaint was
submitted over two years after the alleged
offense; accounts from other students
that might have supported that of the
woman involved were inconsistent in im
portant respects and could not be used
against the alleged rapist."
Pamela says these details enabled
people to identify her and violated her
rights of confidentiality. Most of all,
Pamela does not consider Cole's letter
factual.
Lack of victim's rights
Throughout the process of reporting,
Pamela discovered that she had no rights
spelled out in the "Regulations Governing
Student Conduct and Procedures for
Their Enforcement," the University's
guidelines for student behavior.
The guidelines make no mention of the
rights of a student reporting an alleged
crime.
However, Cole says she now sees the
need for a statement of the rights of
victims. "Sexual Assault on Campus:
What Colleges Can Do" outlines possible
rights of victims, and Cole says she ac
cepts these.
Rights in this book, published by the
Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center,
include the right of victims to have a
person or persons accompany them
throughout the disciplinary hearing, the
right not to have irrelevant past sexual
history discussed during the hearing, and
the right to suggest an appropriate
penalty if the accused is found guilty.
In preparing to testify for the Univer
sity Task Force on Sexual Assault, Cole
learned of three more rights that could
be defined: the right to be present at the
hearing, the right not to answer direct
questions from the accused, and the right
to be immune from punishment of "les
ser" crimes such as underage drinking.
While the University guidelines include
no rights for the victim, they do list 12
specific rights of the accused, including
the right "to confront any witnesses

before the Hearing Officer."
The guidelines are "outdated" and spe
cific changes to them should be made,
Cole says. The document was written in
1968, when the University was in the
midst of anti-war protests and campus
disruptions that violated the Fundamen
tal Standard. "In that era there was no
specific attention to sexual assault," Cole
explains.
Official condemnation needed
Among Pamela's objections to the jud
icial process, she feels the system lacks
the education it needs to handle rape
cases. "The office and Sally Cole are not
capable of dealing with rape," Pamela
says. "They are insensitive to the issue
and undereducated."
Because some University officials lack
education about the nature of acquaint
ance rape, there is a "myth that the only
real rapes are stranger-rapes," Pamela
says. This view makes acquaintance rape
seem like "regrettable sex" instead of a
felony rape, she says.
Among some University officials,
"there is definitely an idea that rape
doesn't happen here," says junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the Uni
versity Task Force on Sexual Assault.
This lack of understanding may lie in
the fact that the University has no official
policy condemning sexual assault.
Cole says there are many ways of sol
ving this problem within the judicial sys
tem, some of which she took from the
booklet "Sexual Assault on Campus."
One option could be "a presidential
statement condemning this kind of con
duct and clarifying institutional re
sponses to it," Cole says. As a matter of
"expediency," this may be the best option,
she says. Another change short of a new
policy could be a statement from the Uni
versity Task Force on Sexual Assault with
a preamble from Kennedy "so it would
have the authority of a presidential doc
ument."
The statement, however, "would have
to be used for a great deal more than
the judicial process," Cole says."I don't
think prosecution is going to be the an
swer to these problems any more than
they are the answer to discriminatory
harassment problems.
"But that doesn't mean you don't have
a policy on the books. I think that's im
portant symbolically and that's important
in an educational setting. That's different
from saying that's going to be the solu
tion," Cole explains.
According to Gail Abarbanel, co-author

of "Sexual Assault on Campus," prose
cution is a crucial element in solving the
problem of sexual assault. "The single
biggest problem is that women remain
silent. They do that because they don't
feel they get the support and action"
from the University, she says.
Other than a presidential statement
condemning rape, the University could
write an interpretation of the Fundamen
tal Standard that applies specifically to
sexual assault. Or it could create a sep
arate policy for such cases.
Beyond a reasonable doubt
Pamela's experience with the judicial
process highlights the problem of
evidence — such as witnesses, physical
injury and an initial police report — in
cases of acquaintance rape.
According to University regulations, a
student accused of violating the Funda
mental Standard has the right "to be
considered innocent until proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt."
According to O'Brien, however, this
standard of evidence in rape cases is dif
ficult to obtain. "Acquaintance rape is a
crime by its very nature that is one-on
one," O'Brien says.
Cole says acquaintance rape poses a
unique problem if there are conflicting
accounts from two students and no ad
ditional evidence. "We don't have a rule
prohibiting sexual intercourse," Cole
says."It seems to me that if what you
are talking about is whether there was
consent, if the disagreement about that
is primarily psychological, if it was what
was in people's heads — I can't imagine
there would be evidence that would de
termine this one way or the other," she
says.

In a case of sexual assault
where it is one person's
word against another's, I
don't think you can reach a
beyond-a-reasonable
doubt proof.'
— Sally Cole

"If what you were talking about is rape
— physical assault that is violent — then
there would have to be physical evidence
if there is nothing else. That's where the
medical profession and police come in to
record it so it can be used in prosecution,"
Cole explains.
O'Brien disagrees, explaining there is
often no physical evidence in cases of
rape. "There are no bruises, and often
the vagina isn't ripped. It's a question
of consent." Most victims of acquaintance
rapes do not fight back; they often freeze
because they trust their assailant.
Because of the combination of physical
and psychological factors involved, Cole
says,"In a case of sexual assault where
it is one person's word against another's,
I don't think you can reach a beyond-a
reasonable-doubt proof."
She adds, "I don't see that you're going
to be able under any judicial system,
whatever the standard of proof, to make
a determination of guilt."
Rape "is an extraordinarily serious al
legation that has to be provable," Cole
says, explaining that students being
charged with the crime have certain
rights that must be upheld whether or
not they are guilty.
Hoerger adds that this standard is ap
propriate, "especially when you heve a
very serious allegation. Both people's
rights and interests are important. I
wouldn't want to see someone disciplined
with the penalties you can receive in a
Fundamental Standard violation with a
lesser standard" of evidence than beyond

a reasonable doubt.
But O'Brien says this view places the
burden on the victim. "It ends up being
a woman proving she did not consent,
not the man proving he" did not rap her,
O'Brien explains.
She adds that a beyond-a-reasonable
doubt standard for evidence "is overly
stringent for everything in a university
setting, including rape."
Preponderance of evidence
Almost all universities in the country
have standards of proof less stringent
than Stanford's, including "clear-and
convincing" and "preponderance-of
evidence" standards. According to
Abarbanel, "Stanford is the only college
that we found in California and across
the country that has such a high standard
of proof."
A preponderance of evidence requires
that more than 50 percent of the evidence
be on one side, according to Hoerger. "If
the balance tips ever so slightly in favor
of one side," a preponderance of evidence
has been achieved.
O'Brien says that a preponderance-of
evidence standard should "definitely" be
looked into. For example, in some cases,
proof of rape trauma syndrome has been
admissible as evidence of assault, she ex
plains.
Most administrative proceedings —
such as those at universities and in in
ternal investigations at police depart
ments — use a preponderance-of-evidence
standard, Abarbanel adds.
But Cole says this standard of proof
is problematic. "I would be really uncom
fortable prosecuting something under
that situation — especially when the
charges you're looking at are quite se
vere," she explains.
One of the main problems, according
to University Ombudsperson Leah
Kaplan, is the difficult position that the
Judicial Affairs officer is placed in when
deciding whether there is enough
evidence for a case.
"It's very hard to give someone in that
position enough evidence," Kaplan ex
plains. "Why should [one person] be the
one deciding there is not enough
evidence?"
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
says he fears what he believes could hap
pen to an accused student if the standard
of evidence were not so stringent. "I don't
take lightly people's pretty fundamental
rights of being a student," Lyons says.
"I don't think I'd ever want Stanford to
take away a student's rights."
Because of this problem of evidence in
sexual assault cases, Lyons says,"It may
be that the judicial process cannot be the
only response."
He adds, however, that he does not
know where that leaves the victim. "One
of the ingredients is that sense of per
sonally having been violated or betrayed,"
Lyons explains. "That's an emotion that
isn't well-satisfied in the judicial proc
ess."
The lasting effect
Pamela's alleged assailant is now in
the process of becoming a licensed
gynecologist, and his record remains un
stained. According to Pamela, two stu
dents have filed charges of sexual
harassment against him with the Uni
versity. She also says she knows of one
woman who says the same man has at
tempted to rape her.
Pamela explains: "The difference be
tween Cole's statement and her actions
send a clear message to me and the Stan
ford community: Rape survivors cannot
expect action from the Judicial Affairs
Office, and those who rape can expect to
get away with it."
