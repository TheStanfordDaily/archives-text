Judge stops student
aid mail order fraud
A judge has issued a tempo
rary restraining order to detain
mail addressed to the Academic
Council on Financial Assis
tance in San Diego because of
fraudulent promotion involving
financial aid to college stu
dents.
The order follows the filing
of a complaint in San Diego.
The Academic Council on Fi
nancial Assistance is a trade
name for National Scholastic
Resource Administration Inc.
The complaint alleged that
the company, operated by Mi
chael Pousti and Ramn
Niakiani, both of San Diego,
was conducting a scheme for
obtaining money or property
through the mail by means of
false representatives at two
Washington, D.C. addresses.
The promotion offered by the
company alleged that it was af
filiated with the federal gov
ernment and that a college stu
dent who submitted an appli
cation with a $60 fee was
thereby applying for financial
aid from various sources
sought out and obtained by the
company.
For submitting money, the
student receives a list of finan
cial aid sources which he or
she must then contact to obtain
applications. A money-back
guarantee is valid only if a stu
dent applies to, and is turned
down by, every source on the
list.
Anyone who wishes to file a
complaint regarding the
promotion is asked to write to
the Regional Chief Inspector,
Fraud Desk, 850 Cherry Ave.,

sth floor, San Bruno, Calif.
94098-9998.
Law Review elects
second black
Only three days after elect
ing Shauna Jackson as its first
black president, the Stanford
Law Review set yet another
precedent yesterday in electing
a black managing editor.
Kevin Haynes, a second-year
law student, will assume his
position on March 17. As
managing editor, he will as
sume responsibility for over
seeing production.
According to Mathew
Nosanchuk, a senior note
editor for the Law Review, "It's
unprecedented that two people
of color will be occupying the
two main leadership positions"
of the student-run journal.
Haynes said winning the
election is "pretty exciting." He
added that "it says a lot for
Stanford" that law students
would elect two minority stu
dents to the top two positions
of the Law Review.
The senior staff of the Law
Review is elected by second
year members and associate
members of the journal.
"Traditionally, law reviews
in general don't seem to be as
open or admitting" to people
of color, Haynes said. While he
credits Stanford law students
for electing two blacks to the
top leadership positions,
Haynes stressed that those
voting look primarily at the
candidates' qualifications.
"Anyone who is in law school
is fully capable of doing the
work required of the Law
Review," Haynes said.
