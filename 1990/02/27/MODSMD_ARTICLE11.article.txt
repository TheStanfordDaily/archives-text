Journalists under surveillance
BEIJING (AP) — Police have sharply in
creased surveillance of foreign journalists since
lifting martial law in Beijing last month,
reporters said yesterday.
Correspondents from nearly a dozen news
organizations, including those from the United
States, the Soviet Union and Europe, said they
have been tailed at least once by plainclothes
police in recent weeks, some even while jogging
or shopping.
"Several (Chinese) contacts have been
hauled before the leaders in their (work) units
and told, 'We know you had contact with a
foreign journalist and this must stop,' " said
a British reporter.
Virus could affect military
WASHINGTON (AP) - The deadly AIDS
virus has had a minimal effect on the U.S.
military but could stretch the limits of the
armed service's health care system in the next
decade, a congressional report said yesterday.
The General Accounting Office found after
an 18-month investigation that the Defense
Department has done a commendable job in
screening its personnel for human im
munodeficiency virus or HIV, the infection
researchers believe causes AIDS.
As of August 1989, the Defense Department
had tested about 2.1 million of its almost 2.3
million active duty members for HIV, said the
agency, Congress' investigative arm.
Airlines to be smoke-free
NEW YORK (AP) — Smokers puffed away
in airport terminals as they tried to figure
out how to cope with a new ban on smoking
on virtually all domestic airline flights. Non
smokers breathed a bit easier.
Dave Noeth, a traveler at La Guardia Airport
in New York City, said that under certain
circumstances, he was prepared to violate the
ban that took effect Sunday.
"If the plane starts to go down, I'm lighting
one up," he said.
USAir flight attendant Kelly Brown in At
lanta said a colleague told her "she had one
man nearly miss his plane because he was
just standing by the gate trying to finish his
cigarette."
Low-quality food delivered
FORT YATES, N.D. (AP) — Many govern
ment food products are unfit for needy Indians
who rely on them to survive, a congressional
committee was told yesterday as it examined
smelly, unappetizing cans of meat.
"I'm not sure that I'd give this to a dog,"
Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, said after examining
the cans of beef and pork stamped "USDA
approved" from food packages the government
distributes through Indian tribes.
Charles "Red" Gates, the food distribution
program director for the Standing Rock Sioux
Tribe, told the U.S. House Select Committee
on Hunger that the meats not only contain
lard and animal veins, but they also are loaded
with fat and sodium.
That compounds the unusually high rates
of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and
infant mortality rates on North Dakota Indian
reservations, Gates, tribal officials and reser
vation residents said.
