MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -
President Daniel Ortega assured the
world yesterday that the Sandinistas
will accept the voters' verdict and sur
render power, after more than a dec
ade, to an opposition alliance formed
only six months ago.
"We leave victorious because the
Sandinistas have sacrificed, spilled
blood and sweat, not to cling to gov
ernment posts, but to bring Nicaragua
something denied since 1821," he said
in a dramatic dawn speech broadcast
nationwide.
Ortega spoke hours after it was clear
the electoral tide was against him and
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, pub
lisher of the opposition newspaper La
Prensa, would be the next president
of this battle-scarred nation, which has
in the past decade become one of the
poorest in the Western Hemisphere.
"People wanted a change," she said
as she headed for a victory celebration
at her campaign headquarters.
With 82 percent of the precincts
counted, Chamorro had 633,357 votes,
or 55.2 percent, to 468,040, or 40.8
percent for Ortega, the Supreme Elec
toral Council said. The coalition also
won a majority in the National As
sembly.
Chamorro is to take office April 25,
and the transition could be difficult,
given the bad blood between winners
and losers.
"It's going to be a bit harder than
the normal transition," said Alfredo
Cesar, one of Chamorro's closest ad
visers and a former leader of the Con
tra rebels. "That means the two sides
. . . will sit down and make sure the
transition is accomplished in a peace
ful manner."
Under the Sandinistas, Nicaragua
became a self-proclaimed revolution
ary state and adopted portions of
Marxist and Leninist ideology to
remake its economic and social struc
tures. It won strong support from the
Soviet Union and Cuba and was ac
cused by the United States of trying
to foment a Communist revolution in
neighboring El Salvador.

Both Ortega and Chamorro pre
sented themselves as candidates of na
tional reconciliation and economic
recovery, Ortega because he believed
the United States would recognize his
victory and Chamorro because she had
Washington's support.
She promised economic recovery to
a nation that suffered from a decade
of war, U.S. economic embargo and
poor management.
Ortega and the Sandinistas mounted
a carefully orchestrated campaign that
ended with a rally attended by an es

timated 300,000 people. The man who
marched into Managua as a victorious
young revolutionary in July 1979 had
not expected to lose, and the first
hours of the stunning upset were
tense.
Former President Jimmy Carter was
among thousands of international elec
tion observers who monitored the
voting.
Defense Minister Humberto Ortega,
the president's brother, and Interior
Minister Tomas Borge, who controls
the police, had suggested they might

not give an opposition government con
trol of those forces.
Daniel Ortega said he spoke for his
party and government, however, in
promising to honor the results of Sun
day's election.
"I want to tell all Nicaraguans and
all the nations of the world that the
president of Nicaragua and the gov
ernment will respect and submit itself
to the popular mandate," he said.
In opposition, the Sandinistas will
be the largest and best-organized party
in Nicaragua.
