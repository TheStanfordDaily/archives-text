Securitate vestiges axed
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -
Military officers showed yesterday
how they had begun dismantling the
telephone-tapping centers of Nicolae
Ceausescu's secret police and said
their work was proof the widespread
eavesdropping was ended.
"Observe please that all the power
boxes have been removed," said Maj.
Gen. Nicolae Cerbu, deputy of the
army Signal Corps, gesturing at a
bank of cassette players in a listening
center in Bucharest.
Ceausescu's dreaded secret police,
the Securitate, tapped tens of thou
sands of telephones as part of its vast
domestic spying apparatus. The
Securitate was officially disbanded

after the December revolution that
ended the Communist dictator's 24-
year reign and led to his execution.
Soviets begin pull-out
FRENSTAT, Czechoslovakia (AP)
— A brass band struck up the "In
ternationale" on yesterday as the Red
Army began leaving Czechoslovakia
22 years after it arrived to crush a
reform movement.
Karel Micek of the Civic Forum
said the presence of Soviet troops
had meant "empty shelves in stores,
polluted water, an occasional fight in
the pub and a reminder that we are
not a free country."
"Their main problem was that they
were here," said Micek, whose group

played a central role in the peaceful
revolution that ousted the Commu
nist Party from exclusive power in
November.
Twenty-two Soviet T-62 tanks
loaded on flatcars left the northern
town of Frenstat, beginning a
negotiated, three-stage pullout of the
73,500 Soviet military personnel,
scheduled for completion next year.
Law condemned
MOSCOW (AP) — Legislators from
the Baltics and other independence
minded republics yesterday con
demned a draft law that would allow
the Kremlin to take over their gov
ernments by declaring a state of
emergency.

Several deputies said the proposal
is even more dangerous because a
separate bill on strengthening the
presidency would permit the nation's
leader to declare a state of emergency
on his own.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
seeking a law that would give him
more power to push through his pro
gram.
Party assailed in rally
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — More
than 20,000 people chanting
"Democracy!" and "Liberty!" massed
in the capital yesterday in a rally
against the ruling Communist Party.
The peaceful demonstration was
the second in two straight days.
