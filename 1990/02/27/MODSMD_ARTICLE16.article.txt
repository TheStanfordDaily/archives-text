## Show responsibility 
### 
Tuesday Films fiasco
lacked information and
responsible leadership.

CERTAIN responsibilities
come with ASSU funding.
Adviser-lecturer Eric Diesel
of Tuesday Films failed to meet
many of them last week by can
celing the film series in a dispute
over the upcoming elections.
His misguided temper tantrum
deprives the student body of a serv
ice it pays for and puts the future
of the series in jeopardy.
While the ASSU made the first
mistake by accidentally omitting
the Tuesday Films budget from
last year's election guide, Diesel
could have corrected the situation
when he had the opportunity to
check the proofs of the guide before
it was printed.
But he neglected this responsi
bility, and 15,000 copies of the
guide went out without mention of
Tuesday Films.
Despite this faux pas, the fee
request was approved by the stu
dent body, and the film series re
ceived funding for this year.
However, less than 60 percent of
the student body voted for it, so
the 1990-91 budget requires peti
tions signed by 10 percent of the
student body, along with ASSU
Senate approval, to go on the bal
lot.
The senate has already given the
film series its approval. But rather

than bite the bullet and collect
signatures, Diesel has instead
decided to cancel the series for the
rest of the year, declaring that the
ASSU is really to blame.
This fit of immaturity is doubly
threatening to the student body;
the series is gone for the indefinite
future, just at the time that its
organizer should be ensuring fund
ing for next year.
Diesel calls attention to an ASSU
bylaw codicil, understood by virtu
ally no one, that suggests that or
ganizations with essentially similar
budgets over a period of several
years may get special consideration
if previous voter support is appar
ent.
If the ASSU deserves any blame
for the current fiasco, it is for
having ill-understood and unen
forceable rules on the books such
as this one.
Still, Diesel's conduct in holding
Tuesday Films hostage is abso
lutely inexcusable. Problems with
ASSU elections should be handled
by going to the elections commis
sioner and then, if that course of
action is unsatisfactory, to the sen
ate.
Discontinuing the series helps
neither Tuesday Films nor the
public. The ASSU will move no
faster as a result, and the viewers
must now wonder if someone who
would cancel the films like this is
fit to run the organization in the
future.
To deprive the student body of
services that it still pays for and
still wants to attend is a betrayal
of trust and shows a lack of re
sponsibility on Diesel's part.
