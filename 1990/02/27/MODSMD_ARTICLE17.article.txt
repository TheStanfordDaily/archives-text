Budget cuts need to show sensitivity to secretaries

I HAVE READ with some anxiety of
the proposed plans to cut jobs at
Stanford, either by eliminating the
job, cutting salaries, or raising benefit
costs.
None of these solutions to Stanford's
budgetary problems would be accepta
ble to me.
I am a secretary 11-Sin the Depart
ment of Economics and have so far
been content with my job. I enjoy
working for the professors (currently I
work for eight of them) and have been
pleased to be rewarded with good
raises and — despite some increase in
payments — an adequate health plan.
I came to Stanford three and a half
years ago from a job with the federal
government where money was tight,
health care expensive and raises almost
nonexistent. Stanford seemed very

Secretaries are second-class citizens in the
opinion of those who run Stanford if they are cut
from the budget and professors and students
are not.

secure by comparison and had a repu
tation for treating employees fairly
with good benefits and a salary almost
competitive with industry.
I figured any shortcomings in my
salary would be made up by being part
of academia; it would be rewarding to
relate to intelligent people and do my
small part in furthering education, and
it would be pleasant to be on the
campus during working hours and

partake of its atmosphere.
I am not at all anxious to change
the advantages I now enjoy. I believe I
can say with confidence that the
people I work for would not like any
changes, either. I feel I am a valued
employee here in Economics, doing
good work for my salary.
I would not "starve" if I did not
receive a good raise every year or if
my benefits rose in price, but I would

be angry. I would feel insulted.
I would feel like secretaries are
second class citizens in the opinion of
those who run Stanford if they were
cut and the professors and students
not cut. I would not be happy to leave,
but I would feel the need to do so to
remain true to myself.
I hope that Provost James Rosse will
consider my feelings when making
decisions about trimming the budget. 1
am sure many other secretaries share
my feelings.
I hope my fears are groundless, but
without any reassurance from the
University or my supervisor, I thought
it was important to express my con
cerns just in case it would help.
