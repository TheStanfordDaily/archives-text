# District of Columbia statehood proposal shows selfish motive
## 
### 
While I am rarely surprised by any
of the articles printed in your View
point section, the Feb. 20 edition is
perhaps the most irresponsible piece of
"journalism" I have ever read. Henry
Organ's case for Washington, D.C.
statehood is absolutely filled with in
sults, half-truths and wild accusations.
In particular, I take offense at Or
gan's use of the term "racist" to
describe his opponents. There are a
number of reasons to oppose the Dis
trict of Columbia's statehood which
have nothing to do with the city's ra
cial composition. Here's one:
Essentially, what Organ proposes is
that an area less than one-tenth the
size of Rhode Island be given an equal

footing in the Senate with such mega
states as California, New York and
Texas.
The system of representation in the
Senate is already undemocratic. Why is
it that the city of Chicago, with 3 mil
lion inhabitants, has less influence
than the sparsely-populated state of
Wyoming? There is only one logical
argument for this system.
The vast mtyority of members of the
House of Representatives (like most of
the American populace) come from the
area east of the Mississippi River and
are concentrated on the East Coast
and the Great Lakes area. In addition,
almost all of these representatives
come from urban areas. Hence, the
typical congressman represents an
Eastern or Midwestern city.
If the House of Representatives alone
determined national policy, the largely
rural areas west of the Mississippi
would be consistently ignored. So the
whole purpose of the Senate is to en
sure that geographical regions have

some influence in national government.
Clearly, giving full statehood to an
area smaller than most cities would
defeat the purpose of the Senate. Be
sides, the East is already heavily repre
sented in Congress. Here is a non
"racist" reason why the District of
Columbia shouldn't become a state.
I suspect that Organ's real motives
have more to do with partisan politics
than with democratic and constitu
tional ideals. As he and his political
hero Jesse Jackson state, "Two
senators from the district would play
an important role in crucial agenda
items ... the right to abortion, confir
mation of federal judges, the environ
ment and toxic wastes, sane defense
spending, education, human and civil
rights."
In other words, Washington, D.C.
would become a pocket borough for
two very liberal Democrats. I would
advise anyone who supports the Con
stitution and democracy over partisan

ideology to oppose full statehood for
the district.
