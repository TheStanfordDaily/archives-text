## ASSU officials acknowledge rule ambiguity, propose amendment 
### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
ASSU officials have placed Tuesday
Films on the spring election ballot,
clearing the way for the film series to
continue and settling a brief controversy
over an ambiguous election rule.
Realizing that there is "room for con
fusion" in the ASSU Constitution, Elec
tions Commissioner Steve Krauss,
Senate Chair Ed Sasaki and the Council
of Presidents drew up a resolution Fri
day to grant the group's request for
inclusion on the ballot without gather
ing signatures from 10 percent of the
student body.
They also resolved to clarify a con
stitutional clause dealing with the need
for student groups wanting to be on the
ballot to collect signatures if they fail

to receive 60 percent of the student vote
in the previous election.
"We decided it was reasonable to call
(the clause] ambiguous, and that Tues
day Films was in a pretty unique situ

A week ago, Tuesday Films organizers
canceled the remainder of this year's
films when they discovered that the
group was not on the ballot for the
spring elections.
The group had not received the nec
essary 60 percent student vote last year
and was informed that it had to gather
signatures of 10 percent of the student
body to appear on the spring ballot.
This year, however, the program cut its
budget by almost $500, asking for funds
similar to those requested in 1988, when
it received more than 60 percent of the
vote.

Shortly after the cancellation of last
Tuesday's film, Student Organization
Services Director Michael Ramsey-Perez
suspended the group over a leadership
question.
"It wasn't clear that [Tuesday Films]
was being led by students," said
Ramsey-Perez. It appeared that Eric
Diesel, an alumnus, may have been
running the films. According to Uni
versity policy, student groups must be
managed by registered students.
Ramsey-Perez decided he was
satisfied with the group's organization
and retracted the suspension after a
meeting with a Tuesday Films repre
sentative on Thursday.
According to Diesel, the group's ad
viser, last week's cancellation of Fellini's
