## On German reunification 
### 
AMIDST THE TRIALS and tribula
tions in our little garden of Eden,
European issues are shaping the
world of tomorrow, and this, unhappily,
is happening whether we choose to be
Eurocentric or not.
In a time where what once was un
thinkable is now inevitable, Germany will
again will be one nation under one state.
Regardless of the debate over semantics
— to unify or to reunify — the United
German state is virtually a fait accompli.
The sovereignty and legitimacy of East
Germany is so battered that not even an
eleventh-hour conversion to Western
style social democracy will revive this
bankrupt regime.
Now that the German Question is
going to have an answer, there are cur
rents of uneasiness circulating about the
wisdom of allowing Germany with its
checkered past to re-emerge as the
hegemon of Europe. This fear, however,
is unfounded, because the power relations
within Europe and the state of the Ger
man national character both suggest that
peace can reign in the presence of a united
Germany.
First of all, rather than upsetting the
balance of power, the unification of Ger
many will re-establish it. The true threat
of hegemony since 1945 has been the
Soviet Union, and a stronger Germany
will counteract this huge presence
(although the Gorbachev foreign policy
has made the Soviet preponderance of
forces less threatening).
However, the memory of Hitler's Ger
many casts a long shadow on any talk

of a united Germany. The issue which
no politician dares mention is the fear
that within the German national char
acter lies a dark, megalomanic trait that
makes this ancient people a unique threat
to its neighbors.
This fear is not only unfounded, but
it also reeks of prejudice. I must squarely
object to the notion that the Germans
of our era are responsible for crimes
which they had no hand in committing.
The vast majority of Germans were born
long after Hitler's reign or are too young
to remember.
The behavior of West Germany in the
postwar era has been nothing short of
first-class. The West Germans have de
veloped stable democratic institutions
and a level of political culture to indicate
that they have broken completely with
the Nazi militarism of 1933-1945.
The likelihood of renewed German ex
pansionism in Europe is about as slim
as an attack by the United States on
Canada. The integration of the German
economy into the European Economic
Community makes any sort of aggression
uncommonly inimical to German national
interests — West Germany is the world's
largest exporter.
More than the enormous disincentives
for a new European war is the profound
rapprochement that has taken place be
tween Germany and its former enemies.
The age-old French/German conflict has
vanished, and relations are closer than
any American could imagine. The weight
of the wartime carnages, which literally
wiped out entire families, makes another

Verdun impossible.
As I mentioned before, German
reunification will happen with or without
us. The Bush administration is, however,
trying to insist that the new Germany
be part of NATO, and this is the one
condition that the Soviet Union, which
holds the trump card in this game (some
350,000 troops in East Germany), cannot
accept.
If there is NATO, there will be no
unified Germany, but paradoxically, there
will be no NATO if there is a unified
Germany. West Germany is currently t|je
largest supplier of troops to NATO, and
its defection would be the death knell
for an organization which has lost its
raison d'etre.
This should not, however, dissuade us
from supporting German unification, be
cause the break-up of NATO will happen
sooner or later, as well it should, since
the United States has neither the need
nor the resources to be a mcyor European
power. A united Germany will ensure
that Western Europe is able to provide
for its own security, and our mission will
have been accomplished.
