"Justice and Gender," by
Deborah Rhode, Stanford law pro
fessor and director of the Institute
for Research on Women and
Gender, provides an historical and
sociological analysis of the wom
en's movement that clearly lays
out feminist issues.
Rhode emphasizes the relation
between law and culture while
being sensitive to the complexities
of social change. "Justice and
Gender" succeeds in conveying
various strategies that have been
utilized and their usefulness,
while outlining major areas of
women's rights.
The reader is lead through
major areas of feminist concerns,
such as family policy, women and
work, reproductive freedom and
sex and violence, while examining
the theories that revolve around
these issues. The various voices
of feminism, liberal-feminism,

Marxist-feminism, radical
feminism and relational-feminism
are included.
In addition to being a resource
for information on the women's
movement, "Justice and Gender"
provides insightful criticism of
different approaches and proposes
a direction that the women's
movement should follow. An
agenda for the women's movement
is set out that requires greater
attention to the way that women
are impacted by legal, social and
political agencies.
Rhode criticizes the way liberal
feminists focus on similarities be
tween the sexes, because this in
dividualistic approach ignores
existing sex disparities. However,
a focus on differences serves to
reinforce the disparity between
the sexes.
There are areas of agreement
with the more radical views of
Catharine MacKinnon. Like Mac-
Kinnon, Rhode feels that current
efforts to incorporate feminism
with Marxism are unsuccessful
because women as a group become
subsumed by the category of

"worker." Rhode feels it is impor
tant to focus on the way women
are subordinated because this
may serve to form a common bond
which will motivate women to ac
tion.
Although Rhode appreciates the
insights that MacKinnon has pro
vided, she is opposed to a single
vision of feminist reality. The top
down approach of MacKinnon's
dominance-oriented framework
narrows the view of women and
of women's relationships with
men. Women's experiences are
very complex and fail to be en
compassed within MacKinnon's
theory.
Rhode strongly advocates that
we learn from the history of the
women's movement in order to
connect theory with practice. A
shift from gender differences to
gender disadvantage is proposed,
which would base analysis on the
effect of the laws on sex-based
disparities.
Rhode gives a thorough presen
tation of feminist history and
raises some interesting sugges
tions for the women's movement.
