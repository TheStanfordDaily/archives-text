A Feminist Theory of the State

Most people have a vague and unde
fined conception of feminism. There does
exist among them a general understand
ing that feminism seeks to deal with the
subordination of women. Often, hostility
directed toward feminism seems to arise
from the very generality of people's per
ceptions precisely because the more
subtle aspects of feminist thought are
not explored or are deliberately ignored.
Catharine MacKinnon, a fellow at the
Institute for Research on Women and
Gender at Stanford and professor of law
at York University in Toronto, has re
cently written "Toward a Feminist The
ory of the State." In it she confronts
misconceptions and the intricacies of
feminist thought by beginning with a
comparative analysis of feminism and
Marxism.
MacKinnon is a controversial figure
because of the relentlessness of her the
ory and the strength of her words. As a
reader, one should keep in mind that
within the feminist movement there are
some that are threatened by her view
points and others that embrace them
completely.
The book begins with a comparison of
Marxism and feminism that may seem
obtuse and lengthy if you are not inter
ested in Marxism already. MacKinnon
asserts that Marxism and feminism are
analogous in that they both challenge the
singular authority of the dominant view
point, but she concludes that the two
movements are fundamentally incompat-
People accuse MacKinnon of failing to
address the needs of women of color. This
is not surprising since historically sepa
rate movements of social change have
had difficulty working together against
oppression. The women's movement in
particular has had a checkered past in
terms of addressing the issues that con
cern black women, who were at one time
openly excluded from the suffragist cam
paign in this country.
There do seem to be problems with
MacKinnon's theory from the perspective
of race. However, MacKinnon's theory of
oppression shares with critical race
theorists a discontent with the myth of
objectivity, a myth which further perpet
uates the subordination of all oppressed
groups.
There is a shared belief that an un
derstanding of the structural forces of

domination in our society should be
derived from the point of view of the
group oppressed. From this starting
point, both movements, feminist and cri
tical race, seek to expose the essential
features of the dominant hierarchy which
are inadequate to describe the reality of
the group's experience.
The way that the state is free to refuse
to address social inequality, even under
a constitutional equal protection princi
ple, is what creates the strongest disso
nance between the concept of objectivity.
What is rational must be determined by
a neutrality of perspective.
"Judicial neutrality" ensures that
groups that are systematically excluded
from the political process will not be af
forded constitutional relief. Anything
that challenges existing allocations of
power is termed substantive and is
strongly suppressed.
This means that whatever can be done
without appearing to change anything is
what is defined as reasonable and ra
tional. Lacking the capacity to incor
porate points of view contrary to reality
objectively defined, the existing hierarchy
is left to continue the subordination of
women.
Maleness defines the dominant point
of view and acts as a systemic and
hegemonic political construct. By failing
to question objectivity as an epistemology,
male-defined rationality is left to create
reality from the way knowledge is ob
tained. Objectification becomes the social
process in which knowledge is gathered,
and from this "neutral" viewpoint a man
is conceptualized as subject. Everything
else is deemed object.
Within this framework, a male can only
have knowledge of the world once he has
defined its use to him. The impact on
women is staggering. As an object that
is defined by its use, "woman" is limited
to an object of sexual desirability and is
understood by a man once he has used
her.
It is the social basis of subordination
that must be questioned. Women as a
group called "women" are dominated by
men. Only through an understanding of
social relations and women's experiences
as a collective social being can gender be
understood. Feminism, which to Mac-
Kinnon is radical feminism, or feminism
unmodified, aims to change the socially
constructed gender hierarchy of oppres
sion.
Within MacKinnon's theory, domina
tion of those with less power is directly
linked to sexuality. Sexuality is an im
pulse expressed as a need that is satisified
by whatever cultural version of fulfill

ment is chosen. In our society there is
an assumption that whatever is consid
ered sexual is positive and should be ex
pressed. Any restraint on male sexual
freedom is discussed, it means that
women are permitted to have sex as often
as men do, rather than meaning that one
is free to have or not to have sex.
By understanding women's experience
of sexual events, the abuses of women
are revealed to be sexualized — domi
nance and submission are eroticized and
this is what creates the distinction be
tween male and female. What is consid
ered sexy seems to revolve around power
and triumph over any restriction of that
power.
MacKinnon contends that under a sys
tem of male dominance, rape and sex
stem from similar motivations. For black
women the connection between rape and
domination is particularly direct. Star
tling connections between the raping of
black women and the lynching and
beating of black men as a form of control
and subversion have been drawn that
exemplify the use of sex as violence.
Pornography is used to eroticize dom
ination and submission and works to
define a woman by her erotic potential.
Sexuality is presented in a way which
results in the objectification of sexuality
itself.
MacKinnon views pornography as a po
litical practice that oppresses women's
bodies and minds. However, the courts
appear to be concerned with protecting
the interests of men, and the battle really
is about how much control one male can
have over another male's bedroom.
MacKinnon advocates a redefinition of
the role of women in society that is
grounded in a woman's experience. She
is not asking that women be men; in fact,
she is ardently opposed to men being the
standard of what is valued. MacKinnon
connects the existing patriarchy in our
society to the way the sex is defined. Her
central idea is that there is a sexualized
hierarchy that is enforced through
gender. Through the experiences of wom
en, she seeks to expose the hierarchy as
a social construct and in that way chal
lenge what has always been accepted as
truth: male superiority
The treatment of rape shows the extent
of the law's male-dominated perspective.
The legal definition of rape is non
consentual, forced or coerced intercourse,
which means that forced intercourse is
acceptable as a form of "sex." Force is
measured by what is more force than
the reasonable man would use, and the
woman's perception of the violation of
her body is not a factor in the analysis.

A woman's consent is determined by
what a reasonable man would consider
consent, which is to ignore that there is
any discrepancy between a male and
female understanding of consent.
Within sex discrimination law, social
inequities become legal sex classifications
— discrimination is thus codified. Any
distinction between the treatment of men
and women becomes acceptable if traced
to physical characteristics. Women are
told that they can only achieve what men
have if they are similarly situated; the
catch is that society prevents women from
ever becoming similarly situated.
To MacKinnon, there are irreconcilable
differences between radical and liberal
feminists. She objects to the way that
liberal thought is primarily concerned
with the individuals' ability to develop
and thus treats reason and logic inde
pendently. This type of thinking leaves
in the myth that a woman is free to act
as an individual, and the social definition
of "woman" is ignored.
To remain in the liberal tradition and
affirm the differences in the social
realities of women and men without ex
plaining why these differences exist is to
accept the inevitability of patriarchy. This
forms the basis for justifying the subor
dination of women. As she puts it, "dif
ference is the velvet glove on the iron
fist of domination. The problem is not
that differences are not valued, the prob
lem is that they are defined by power."
Consciousness-raising is the method

that feminism uses to reveal the myth
of an objective reality and to develop a
more sympathetic truth. Through the
sharing of experiences, the separation of
"thought" and "think" is broken down.
MacKinnon presents this as a necessary
step for any oppressed group to make in
order to become visible to itself.
This methodology is valuable because
it relates to women's lived experiences,
rather than merely stating that women
are dominated by men. Each woman is
allowed to experience the way that she
has individually been socialized into op
pression and also to discover that their
subordination is not inevitable.
Externally created barriers that in
doctrinate women to think they are less
than men are made visible for what they
are — social constructions.
MacKinnon has done a remarkable job
of identifying some general structural
forces that operate to objectify and
oppress women. However, the danger in
embracing her theory is twofold: Her
analysis seems to reinforce the domi
nance of men over women, and it turns
a blind eye to the differences between
women's individual experiences.
The bright promise that the subjective
experiences of women were to be explored
and believed does not seem to have been
met.
MacKinnon's theory of dominance
strikes an essentialist tone by claiming
to describe the totality of women's op
pression. By searching for the essence of
what is woman, MacKinnon provides an
artificial definition of woman that does
not encompass all women's experience.
MacKinnon seems to leave the defini
tion of women in terms of how men con
tinue to dominate women. In this way,
the perpetrator's perspective once again
is seen as the perspective. By viewing
women through the perpetrator's lens,
we continue to accept not only men as
the standard, but white men.
This is not to say that MacKinnon's
theory of oppression is not useful. On
the contrary, it is a powerful analysis
that all oppressed people can learn from.
We must search for ways in which we
can expand the current realm of possi
bilities in order to eliminate the incon
sistencies between peoples' experiences of
reality and existing theories.
An incorporation of MacKinnon's in
sights with the particularities of different
experiences and a move beyond a theory
of shared victimization is necessary. The
differences between women (and of all
oppressed people) need to accompany a
structural analysis of domination.
