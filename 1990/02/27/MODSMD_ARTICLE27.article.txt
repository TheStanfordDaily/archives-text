## How the West wasn't won Card nine just keep swinging in 19-3 rout of Pioneers 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
If the real Lewis and Clark had
been this bad, we'd all be living
east of the Mississippi.
All right, so that's not entirely
fair. Lewis and Clark College, lo
cated in Portland, has only 1870
students and is an NAIA school.
And let's face it, that doesn't quite
cut it when you're facing a team
like Stanford.
But jeez . ..

Baseball

Cardinal 19
Pioneers 3

With the two-touchdown, two
two-point-conversion (that's cor
rect, darnit!) win, the Cardinal is
14-5. The lost Pioneers, who
played most of the game like they
wished they'd taken the left turn
at Albuquerque, are now 0-4.
There were actually several
turning points in the game. No,
really. The first was back in 1989,
when it was scheduled. The sec
ond was yesterday morning, when
Mother Nature decided not to
rain.
The third was in the bottom of
the first, when Pioneer pitcher
Doug Nichols decided to throw the
ball instead of trying to run out
the clock.
Had Nichols had that option,
he probably would have taken it,
because he (and the rest of the
Pioneer staff) only ended up
throwing batting practice anyway.
The Stanford lineup got 20 hits
— 13 (with four homers) in the
first three innings — by feasting
on curveballs that didn't and
fastballs that weren't.
Nichols' ERA was the first vic
tim of the game, and its time of
death was the bottom of the first.
Jeff Hammonds led off with a
single and stole second on a less
than-cannon-like throw from
catcher Dan Wilkins. An out later,
David McCarty hit a monster
blast down the left-field
line .. .just foul.
No big deal. The next pitch was
konged deeeeep to right-center,
giving McCarty his fourth homer
of the year and Stanford a 2-0
lead.

There were actually several turning points
in the game. The first was back in 1989, when
it was scheduled. The second was yesterday
morning, when Mother Nature decided not to
rain.

The game probably should have
been called then and there, but
the rest of the Stanford lineup
wouldn't have been too happy
about it. Paul Carey followed up
with his fifth homer (he needs 10
more to break Mark McGwire's
Pac-10 record), and after a single,
steal, walk, double steal (it wasn't
Wilkins' day) and another walk,
senior catcher Todd French was
at the plate with the bases full.
French promptly brought
everyone in with his first career
homer, which crashed through the
trees and made the score seven
zip. Not bad for a guy whose
career hit total before yesterday
included all of three singles, a
double and a triple.
"I was looking for a pitch inside,
and it went out," French said. "I
just got a pitch I was looking for."
I think that was a pretty pivotal
point in the game." Needless to
say.
Carey, tongue wedged in his
cheek, disagreed. "I think it
(French's homer) was tainted a
little because it came in a 19-3
game," Carey said. "I mean, if
we're playing Arizona State, it's
Sunday and the score is tied, then
that's clutch. But hey, today we're
up 3-0, we've hit two dongs al
ready and he's the ninth batter
up in the inning. If he doesn't do
that, he should quit the game."
While the Cardinal batters con
tinued to go crazy with seven

more runs in the next two innings
(including Tim Griffin's seventh
homer, a three-run shot in the
third), freshmen Brian Sackinsky,
Jamie Sepeda and Tim Moore
were combining to hold the
Pioneers to four (count'em) hit§.
Sackinsky went the first five
innings for his second win, with
Sepeda — pitching for the first
time in two weeks because of an
injury — and Moore tossing two
shutout innings apiece.

Card notes
Junior Rob Robbins played two in
nings — along with just about every
one else on the team — and, thanks
to a generous official scorer, didn't
have a single error. That keeps his
team-record career fielding percent
age at I.OOG, &o he'll be happy to tell
you.
