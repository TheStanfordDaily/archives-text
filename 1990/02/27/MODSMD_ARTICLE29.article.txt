# What you see in print isn't what really matters in sports

Anyone reading about this weekend's
Pacific 10 Conference Women's
Swimming Championships proba
bly found almost everything they wanted
to know in one of many papers yesterday.
A simple glance at The Daily would tell
them that four Stanford swimmers won
nine events between them, a diver won
two events herself, the Cardinal won
three relays and a bunch of other people
had assorted high finishes.
The article also mentioned that three
Stanford swimmers qualified for the
NCAA Championships. With more than
100 heats of swimming and hours of
diving occurring over a three-day period,
obviously nothing approaching the com
plete picture could be presented without
taking up most of the sports section.
Thus, that was about all that was in the
article.
As the person who wrote it, 1 did my
best to include the things people would
want to hear about: the winners, mostly.

But that is nowhere near the entire story.
In fact, the biggest problem with writ
ing, for me, is saying as much of what
you have to in a lot less space than you
want to use. During sporting events, ex
citing thing after exciting thing happens,
but only a very few of those things ac
tually find their way to print.
Recently I've covered a lot of bas
ketball games. I guess that's what
happens when you're the paper's
basketball writer. But anyway, basketball
games provide a prime example of this
problem.
I can't remember how many times I
wrote down in my notebook about how
so-and-so took a key charge or some guy
hit a clutch three-pointer, and I put a
star by the notation. Then, after the lead
went back and forth a bunch of times
and so on, that charge or long-range bomb
loses its relative significance.
At the Washington State game up in

Pullman, guard Peter Dukes got a fair
amount of playing time. His numbers in
the box score were not that impressive
— I think he had maybe two or three
assists and didn't score a point — but
he dove on the floor for loose balls three
or four times that game and came up
with a couple of them that would have
otherwise gone over to the Cougars.
I had the same problem covering foot
ball. Somebody would make a big third
down play that became less important
based on the way the game unfolded.
There was one other game that I remem
ber, although I can't recall which one it
was.
After spending most of the year par
tially injured, linebacker Eric Pierce fi
nally got a chance to play for a while in
that late-season contest. He had some
thing like 11 tackles in the game and
basically had a heck of a showing for a
guy who'd been hurt most of the season.
Unfortunately, I don't think his name

made the sports page the following Mon
day.
Going back to last weekend, a
similar thing happened. The big
news was that Janet Evans and
Janel Jorgensen each won three events,
and Evans nearly broke the NCAA record
in one of them. Katie Connors and Lori
Heisick won a pair of events each, and
senior Susannah Miller won her last race
at the final Pac-10 meet of her career.
But that's not the whole story. If you

ask any swimmer what the weekend's big
deal was, I bet they would answer that
getting three more swimmers qualified
for NCAAs was what was important.
As Coach Richard Quick said after the
meet, you need ammunition to win an
NCAA title. Now, with three more bullets
loaded, the Cardinal has that much of a
better chance to defend the national title.
But even the fact that Susan Johnson,
Anne Mahoney and Jody Smith found
success at the meet isn't the only news.
Perhaps the best story for those in car
dinal and white was that of freshman
Katherine Comanor.
Unlike her four freshman teammates,
Comanor hasn't won three gold medals,
didn't win a silver medal, didn't set a
national high school record and hasn't
swum the 100-yard backstroke faster
than any other swimmer in school historv.

What she did do, however, is
swim five events at the meet. In
each she surpassed her previous
personal best by a significant mar
gin, and she scored 61 points for
Stanford in the meet.
Hearing about people plac
ing seventh, however, is
not what most readers are
looking for, so that's not the stuff
that gets printed. But that's a
shame because college athletics
are for the athletes, not for every
one else.

Too often in this world, an ath
lete will come off the field hanging
his head. He may have just had
the game of his life, but his team
lost, so he doesn't want to be
happy.
What athletes should realize is
that first and foremost, they are
competing against themselves.
Only by successfully competing
that way can they become able to
compete against others, ~ my m
While winning and losing pro
vides an indication of progress,
putting what one does today
against what one did yesterday
provides a better benchmark.
It's just doesn't make for good
reading.
