Twisting the day away
Sorority and fraternity members wrap themselves around each other in White Plaza. This game of Twister is just
one of the events in Stanford's first Greek Week, a festival promoting AIDS awareness. The festivities began last
Saturday and will end next week with the Greek Games, an Olympic-like competition. See story, page 2.
