# Doubles play clinches title for men's tennis
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
It was only fitting that the
Stanford men's tennis team
clinched the ITCA/USTA National
Indoor Team Championships with
a doubles victory.
Coming into the high-powered
tournament, Stanford Coach Dick
Gould was worried about his dou
bles combinations, two of which
had not played together during
the year.

Bears 2

To Gould's liking, the road to
the finals was paved with nothing
but singles, as the Cardinal
clinched every early-round match
by winning five or more of the
singles contests. More specifically,
Stanford lost only one singles
match en route to the finals
against California, an amazing
feat considering the squad went
up against three top-20 teams in
Kentucky, Miami and UC-Irvine.
But against the Golden Bears,
the Cardinal won only four of six
singles matches, forcing the
match into doubles. And it was

then that a most unlikely star
emerged.
Sophomore Jason Yee, who had
watched his team cruise to the
finals from the bench, now was
called on to play No. 3 doubles
with Stanford's No. 2 singles
player, Alex O'Brien.
According to Asst. Coach John
Whitlinger, Yee played a "simply
incredible match" in a 6-1, 6-2
trouncing of California's Carl
Chang and Pete Fitzpatrick. That
win gave Stanford a 5-2 triumph
over California and the National
Indoor title.
"After not having played for
three days, Yee had just a great
match," Whitlinger said. "Coming
off the bench, the guy out-and-out
stole the show."
Of course, Yee was not the only
hero for the Cardinal. Stanford
freshman Johnathan Stark, who
was undefeated at the No. 1 po
sition throughout the week,
avenged an earlier loss to Miami's
Conny Falk in the semifinals of
the dual-meet tournament. Falk
had beaten Stark 6-3, 6-2 in the
finals of the National Collegiate
Classic in Palm Springs on Jan.
14. But on the fast courts in
Louisville, Ky., this weekend,
Stark returned the favor, pound
ing Falk 6-2, 6-1.
Sophomore Alex O'Brien had
his revenge as well, downing
Miami's No. 2 player Johan
Donar, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3. After being
up 5-0 in a third-set tiebreaker,
O'Brien had lost to Donar at the
Volvo Ail-American Tournament
in Athens, Ga., early in the
season.
Gould praised O'Brien for his
consistent play throughout the

week, noting that O'Brien had
won all four matches at No. 2.
Ironically, O'Brien lost all three
of his matches last year in the
same tournament, playing in the
same slot.
Jared Palmer, coming off knee
surgery, also went undefeated. In
the finals, Palmer rallied from a
first set loss and gave the Cardi
nal an important win against Cal
ifornia's No. 4 singles player, Carl
Chang, 6-7, 6-4, 6-3.
"I was most impressed with our
competitiveness and our concen
tration this week," Gould said.
