# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Stand one on the other's head, and they're
barely tall enough to dunk a basketball. But,
over the weekend Janet Evans and Conrad
Voorsanger both came up big, and, for their
efforts, the two have been named The Daily's
Athletes of the Week.
Evans, a 5-foot-6 freshman from Placen
tia, Calif., was only a stone's throw from
home when she was competing at the Pacific
10 Conference Swimming and Diving Cham

pionships in Monterey Park.
Led by Evans and fellow freshman Janel
Jorgensen, the Cardinal handily defeated
runner-up California 1,717 to 1,238 in the
final tuneup before NCAAs.
Evans swam brilliantly in three events —
most notably the 1650-yard freestyle Sun
day Lapping the entire field in the 25-yard
pool, she recorded a time of 15 minutes,
53.77 seconds. She erased the Stanford and
Pac-10 marks in the process and came up
just three seconds short of the NCAA mark.
In the 400 individual medley Saturday,
Evans recorded a time of 4:15.26 — a meet
record — and bested her nearest competitor
by over five seconds.
Friday, Evans was a big winner in the
500 freestyle. Finally, she swam on the Car
dinal's victorious 800 freestyle relay team.

Voorsanger, a 5-5 senior from Larkspur,
Calif., had the unenviable task of leading
an ii\jury-plagued men's gymnastics team
into a meet with California and perennial
power UCLA.
Stanford fell behind early with a less
than-spectacular performance in the still
rings. In the next event, the floor exercise,
Voorsanger recorded a season-best 9.65 to
lead the team's charge back.
After the pommel horse, the Cardinal led
by just .05. A strong team effort in the high
bar, however, put Stanford ahead to stay.
The Cardinal was strong on the vault and
also the parallel bars — an event Voorsanger
won with a score of 9.70.
Wh*"n ml) said and done, Voorsanger

had captured the all-around with a total of
56.75, and the Cardinal had defeated the
Bruins 276.65 to 274.95.
It was a season best for Stanford and
raised the team's record to 11-0 on the year.
Voorsanger is currently ranked No. 2 in the
nation.
The men's gymnastics team's next meet
is Sunday against Arizona State and Western
Michigan in Burnham Pavilion.
