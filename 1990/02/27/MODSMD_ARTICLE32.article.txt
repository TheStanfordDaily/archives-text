# Years on Farm highlight of tennis star Fendick's career
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
Editor's note: this is the first in a
two-part series on former Stanford ten
nis star Patty Fendick.

Women's tennis Coach Frank Brennan
has seen his share of champions in his
11 years at Stanford. His teams have
won six NCAA championships and nu
merous singles titles, and he has estab
lished a seemingly unstoppable machine
in the world of collegiate tennis.
That's why you can understand his
hesitation when he is asked, "Who was
the greatest tennis player you've ever
coached?"
However, he does come up with an
answer: "Patty Fendick."
To many, this may come as no real
surprise. When today's seniors were
writing their last Western Culture
papers in 1987, Fendick had just won
her second NCAA singles title in as
many years, bringing her win streak to
57 consecutive matches.
The same year, she was also a finalist
in the NCAA doubles competition. She
became the only player to come within
a victory of winning the "triple crown"
of collegiate tennis — the team, singles,
and doubles titles — until Sandra Birch
duplicated her performance last year.
After these collegiate accomplish
ments, Fendick's achievements on the
professional circuit have been equally
impressive.
Just as Fendick had began her Stan
ford tennis career with a bang by playing
No. 1 singles as a freshman, she made
an immediate impact on the pro tour,
rising to No. 19 in the world within
two years of her debut. Currently, she
is in the top 30 after an injury last
year kept her out of action for some
time.
Fendick's hectic life in her four years
on The Farm no doubt prepared her
for the rigors of the pro tennis circuit.
"I got up early in the morning and
finished all my studying for the day at
warp speed," she says."I got everything
done that I had to do.

"I'd go to class, come practice for like
five hours, then go work out. Then I'd
go back and try to get a little more
studying done. Then go out with my
friends, stuff like that. I don't remember
ever sleeping when I was here."
She possessed, then and now, a
profound zest for life which expressed
itself in the intensity of her experience.
"There was a love affair between Stan
ford and Patty," says Brennan.
Indeed, even today her blood runs
Cardinal red. An injury to her eye in
her younger days requires Fendick to
wear a cap or visor when she plays in
the sun, and almost invariably the one
she wears is her Cardinal baseball cap.
Fendick gushes about her Stanford
experience. "I had a great time," she
says."It was the best four years of my
life. Nothing I ever do after that or
before that can ever compare to it."
" 'The Stanford Family' is not a
myth," she continues. "It's a very real
thing. I never really realized that until
I was in Taipei, in the middle of
nowhere, and these two guys came up
to me and they're like, 'Yeah, we went
to Stanford. I graduated in '63, and he
graduated in '65. Some of our friends
back in school wrote us and said you
were going to be in Taipei, so we thought
we'd come down.' "
"I mean, they drove like 80 miles to
come see me. You know, stuff like that,
that's just not normal. It's an incredible
thing to gain from here. What the hell
else in your life is ever going to compare
with that? Nothing."
One can understand then, why Fen
dick completed four years of college and
a degree in psychology when many
advised her to turn pro after high school.
She has strong feelings about players
going pro early. Although many people
argue that turning pro allows a player
to develop her shots more quickly and
fully by playing with better players, Fen
dick feels that for a budding professional
tennis player, developing shots is sec
ondary to developing a strong sense of
confidence.
Besides, college was where Fendick
developed her game. Brennan recalls

how Fendick would come back to Stan
ford in the fall after playing the summer
on the pro circuit and would identify a
weakness in her game. He would work
with her on that weakness "until by
the end of the year, it was a strength.
The difference with Patty was that she
would immediately use (my advicel in
matches," Brennan says.
But Fendick gives additional reasons
for why she is "not a real big advocate
of turning pro early."
"I don't understand why you would
throw away — not only would you throw
away your Stanford experience,- but
you're going to throw away being part
of the best team in the country
"You could win Wimbledon, and it's
not going to compare to a team title.
It doesn't. My singles titles certainly
didn't compare to the team titles that
we won. I mean, you've got eight other
people that are just as happy as you
are, for the same reason. That's an in
credible thing. It's so fun."
These are words that are relevant for
Stanford tennis players every year, and
Fendick is quick to give her suggestions
for two current Cardinal players who
are on the verge of a professional career,
Meredith McGrath and Birch.
"I would just hope that Meredith
would stay here, maybe take the ap
proach I took," says Fendick. "I mean,
that approach isn't for everyone, but
work on your weaknesses, work on your
confidence. Meredith has so much po
tential she could make everything that
I did here look silly. That's how good
she is.
"Same with Sandra Birch. But you
know, she's smart, she's sticking it out.
I don't know how long she's staying,
but it's the same thing; she's trying to
take the same basic approach. I really
think that that works. I think that's
the way to do it."
In many respects, Fendick represents
the ultimate Stanford tennis player. Her
career on The Farm reads almost like
a fairy tale. "I did everything," she
says."I studied hard played tennis hard,
and partied hard."

think that that works. I think that's
the way to do it."

Stanford's "greatest women's tennis player," Patty Fendick, now serves for success
on the pro circuit, where she is currently ranked in the top 30.
Editor's note: this is the first in a
two-part series on former Stanford ten
nis star Patty Fendick.

Women's tennis Coach Frank Brennan
has seen his share of champions in his
11 years at Stanford. His teams have
won six NCAA championships and nu
merous singles titles, and he has estab
lished a seemingly unstoppable machine
in the world of collegiate tennis.
That's why you can understand his
hesitation when he is asked, "Who was
the greatest tennis player you've ever
coached?"
However, he does come up with an
answer: "Patty Fendick."
To many, this may come as no real
surprise. When today's seniors were
writing their last Western Culture
papers in 1987, Fendick had just won
her second NCAA singles title in as
many years, bringing her win streak to
57 consecutive matches.
The same year, she was also a finalist
in the NCAA doubles competition. She
became the only player to come within
a victory of winning the "triple crown"
of collegiate tennis — the team, singles,
and doubles titles — until Sandra Birch
duplicated her performance last year.
After these collegiate accomplish
ments, Fendick's achievements on the
professional circuit have been equally
impressive.
Just as Fendick had began her Stan
ford tennis career with a bang by playing
No. 1 singles as a freshman, she made
an immediate impact on the pro tour,
rising to No. 19 in the world within
two years of her debut. Currently, she
is in the top 30 after an injury last
year kept her out of action for some
time.
Fendick's hectic life in her four years
on The Farm no doubt prepared her
for the rigors of the pro tennis circuit.
"I got up early in the morning and
finished all my studying for the day at
warp speed," she says."I got everything
done that I had to do.

"I'd go to class, come practice for like
five hours, then go work out. Then I'd
go back and try to get a little more
studying done. Then go out with my
friends, stuff like that. I don't remember
ever sleeping when I was here."
She possessed, then and now, a
profound zest for life which expressed
itself in the intensity of her experience.
"There was a love affair between Stan
ford and Patty," says Brennan.
Indeed, even today her blood runs
Cardinal red. An injury to her eye in
her younger days requires Fendick to
wear a cap or visor when she plays in
the sun, and almost invariably the one
she wears is her Cardinal baseball cap.
Fendick gushes about her Stanford
experience. "I had a great time," she
says."It was the best four years of my
life. Nothing I ever do after that or
before that can ever compare to it."
" 'The Stanford Family' is not a
myth," she continues. "It's a very real
thing. I never really realized that until
I was in Taipei, in the middle of
nowhere, and these two guys came up
to me and they're like, 'Yeah, we went
to Stanford. I graduated in '63, and he
graduated in '65. Some of our friends
back in school wrote us and said you
were going to be in Taipei, so we thought
we'd come down.' "
"I mean, they drove like 80 miles to
come see me. You know, stuff like that,
that's just not normal. It's an incredible
thing to gain from here. What the hell
else in your life is ever going to compare
with that? Nothing."
One can understand then, why Fen
dick completed four years of college and
a degree in psychology when many
advised her to turn pro after high school.
She has strong feelings about players
going pro early. Although many people
argue that turning pro allows a player
to develop her shots more quickly and
fully by playing with better players, Fen
dick feels that for a budding professional
tennis player, developing shots is sec
ondary to developing a strong sense of
confidence.
Besides, college was where Fendick
developed her game. Brennan recalls

how Fendick would come back to Stan
ford in the fall after playing the summer
on the pro circuit and would identify a
weakness in her game. He would work
with her on that weakness "until by
the end of the year, it was a strength.
The difference with Patty was that she
would immediately use (my advicel in
matches," Brennan says.
But Fendick gives additional reasons
for why she is "not a real big advocate
of turning pro early."
"I don't understand why you would
throw away — not only would you throw
away your Stanford experience,- but
you're going to throw away being part
of the best team in the country
"You could win Wimbledon, and it's
not going to compare to a team title.
It doesn't. My singles titles certainly
didn't compare to the team titles that
we won. I mean, you've got eight other
people that are just as happy as you
are, for the same reason. That's an in
credible thing. It's so fun."
These are words that are relevant for
Stanford tennis players every year, and
Fendick is quick to give her suggestions
for two current Cardinal players who
are on the verge of a professional career,
Meredith McGrath and Birch.
"I would just hope that Meredith
would stay here, maybe take the ap
proach I took," says Fendick. "I mean,
that approach isn't for everyone, but
work on your weaknesses, work on your
confidence. Meredith has so much po
tential she could make everything that
I did here look silly. That's how good
she is.
"Same with Sandra Birch. But you
know, she's smart, she's sticking it out.
I don't know how long she's staying,
but it's the same thing; she's trying to
take the same basic approach. I really
think that that works. I think that's
the way to do it."
In many respects, Fendick represents
