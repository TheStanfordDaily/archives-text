# Hoopsters reclaim No. 2
## 
### 
They're No. 2 — again. In the
latest Associated Press poll, the
Cardinal women's basketball team
recaptured the second spot it lost
after being defeated by Washing
ton two weeks ago.
Coach Tara VanDerveer was
not displeased with the news, but
she was not overwhelmed either.
"How we're playing is so much
more important to me than the
rankings," she said. "I think we're
better now than when we lost to
Washington."
Unbeaten Louisiana Tech held
the top spot and received 60 of
62 first-place votes. But Tech
sters Coach Leon Barmore gave
his vote to Stanford.
"I've been voting for Stanford
most of the season because I don't
think we've been playing like a
No. 1 team," Barmore said. "We
went through a two-week period
recently where we stunk out the
place. But I will say . . . we've
been coming closer to what a No.
1 team should be."
Chris Gobrecht of fourth
ranked Washington — the only
team to defeat the Cardinal — is
the other voter who cast a first
place ballot in favor of Stanford.
"Stanford's a scoring machine,"
she said. "As one who preaches
defense, I have to concede that
Stanford can get the job done with
offense alone. The only difference
between them and Tech is that
Tech is more experienced at being
ranked so high. Also, I think I
owe Stanford a little loyalty from
the league."
"We are improving," VanDer
veer said. "That's the most im
portant thing this time of year.
Our goal is to be No. 1 when it's
all said and done." She once again
gave credit to track Coach Brooks
Johnson for getting her team to

play the fast-paced style that
produced two 100-point perform
ances over the weekend.
"Brooks said, 'You're not run
ning,' and it scared me," VanDer
veer said. After scoring 113 points
and coming within six of the
school scoring record at Arizona
Saturday, VanDerveer said she is
feeling leas concerned.
