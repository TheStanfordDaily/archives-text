# Card divers begin drive for another team title

### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
While the rest of the men's
swimming team paddled
through practice during their
last off-weekend in the Pacific
10 season, three members of
the Stanford diving team put
the Cardinal swimming team's
first points on the scoreboard
in their drive for their ninth
consecutive conference swim
ming and diving title.
Although the three freshmen
did not garner the high points
for first or second place in any
event at USC's McDonald Swim
Complex, the Cardinal men did
secure the next two available
spots in each competition. In
both the one-meter spring
board and the 10-meter plat
form, Brad Wightman dove just
ahead of Mark Kraus into third
place. Then, in the three-meter
springboard, the two Stanford
divers traded positions, with
Kraus taking third and
Wightman fourth.

"They could not have done
any better," diving Coach Rick
Schavone said. "Not only did
they dive well, which really
made me happy, but they also
scored as high as they possibly
could."
According to Schavone, the
two divers who placed in front
of the Cardinal competitors,
Southern California's Brian
Earley and UCLA's Chris
Pudka, are, at this stage, a step
ahead of Wightman and Kraus
in their careers.
"It was almost impossible for
us to beat Earley and Pudka,"
Schavone said. "On the other
hand, we could have done
worse."
The Cardinal aquatic
acrobats will now prepare for
the Western Zones.
"The boys' best shot is to
beat him [Griffith] and get into
the third spot," Schavone said.
"I don't think we have a shot
at getting one or two, but we'll
go for that third spot."
