# COP pamphlet distribution halted for violating campaign laws

With the ASSU spring elections seven
weeks off, friction has already sparked
between the campus' two recognized po
litical parties over election regulations.
Kevin Warsh, an ASSU senator who is
a member of the Students First party,
successfully filed a complaint Friday with
ASSU Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss. The complaint contends that the
current Council of Presidents violated

ASSU Bylaws by distributing last week
a pamphlet about the ASSU mentioning
the People's Platform party on several
pages.
The Bylaws bar students from cam
paigning until one week prior to the
spring elections.
Yesterday, Krauss issued a ruling hal
ting further distribution of the handbook.
Krauss' ruling explained that "litera
ture not strictly defined as 'campaign
material' can still influence the outcome
of an election if the material is distributed

during the election process."
The pamphlet, entitled "ASSU Re
sources: A Guide to the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University," has already
been distributed to some parts of campus.
In response to the ruling, COP member
David Brown said, "If it is a problem,
then we won't do it. All we want to do
is inform people."
Brown indicated that there was some
confusion in the COP over exactly when
the election process begins.
He cited a similar booklet that the COP

distributed last year after this time with
out incident. Brown said the COP thought
the election process began after the ap
plications deadline for declaring can
didacy, which will be the end of this week.
But Krauss contends in his ruling that
the process began when the election pack
ets became available to candidates and
slates. He also said that his ruling was
consistent with an agreement struck be
tween the elections commissioner and the
COP last year when the COP was
prevented from distributing a flier labeled

"People's Platform COP."
Krauss was quick to point out that
ASSU Bylaws do not restrict elected
slates from advertising or publicizing
their services or accomplishments. But
in the interests of keeping the campaign
ing "low-cost and low-key," the ASSU
restricts this freedom during election
time.
Krauss said, "It is not fair to have
people simultaneously putting out this
kind of advertisement while others are
barred from advertising."
