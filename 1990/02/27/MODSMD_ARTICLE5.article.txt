The plan to trim $22 million
from the University's operating
budget is not a sign of "desperate
economic straits" but of good
management, according to Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy.
In interviews with The Daily
last week, Kennedy lauded the
University's foresight in anticipat
ing future budget strains and
planning to make the cuts over
the next 18 months. Kennedy said
the plan will allow Stanford to
preserve the current quality of its
programs.
Moreover, he said the cuts add
a strong incentive to streamline
the administration, which he crit
icized for its wasteful habit of del
egation.
"We process the same things

too many times," said Kennedy.
"I get something and start to
work on it but then have to go
do something else," he said. "I
pass it on to somebody else" for
further work and approval, and
it gets passed from meeting to
meeting, he explained.
And by the time it circulates
back to the Office of the President
a few weeks later, "I've forgotten
about the thing," Kennedy said.
He said he would like to see
administrators accept more indi
vidual authority and accountabil
ity for decisions and see less of
"the strong academic tradition of
consensus" in the current
decision-making process.
Acknowledging that the stream
lining process will probably lead
to more errors in judgment, Ken
nedy said he still expects admin
