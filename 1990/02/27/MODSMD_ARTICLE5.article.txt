# Kennedy endorses budget cuts
## President supports alcohol policy, four-year guaranteed housing 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
The plan to trim $22 million
from the University's operating
budget is not a sign of "desperate
economic straits" but of good
management, according to Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy.
In interviews with The Daily
last week, Kennedy lauded the
University's foresight in anticipat
ing future budget strains and
planning to make the cuts over
the next 18 months. Kennedy said
the plan will allow Stanford to
preserve the current quality of its
programs.
Moreover, he said the cuts add
a strong incentive to streamline
the administration, which he crit
icized for its wasteful habit of del
egation.
"We process the same things

too many times," said Kennedy.
"I get something and start to
work on it but then have to go
do something else," he said. "I
pass it on to somebody else" for
further work and approval, and
it gets passed from meeting to
meeting, he explained.
And by the time it circulates
back to the Office of the President
a few weeks later, "I've forgotten
about the thing," Kennedy said.
He said he would like to see
administrators accept more indi
vidual authority and accountabil
ity for decisions and see less of
"the strong academic tradition of
consensus" in the current
decision-making process.
Acknowledging that the stream
lining process will probably lead
to more errors in judgment, Ken
nedy said he still expects admin


Donald Kennedy
istrators will make the right
decisions most of the time. Never
theless, Kennedy said he is more
concerned about "late and slow"
decisions than "wrong and time
ly" ones.
Furthermore, a streamlined ad
ministrative process will leave
fewer problems for Kennedy to
dispatch himself.
"I wish I were hooked in less,"
said Kennedy, "because other
people don't get to do their jobs."
Along these lines, he said he
would like to see more adminis
trators take the lead on issues in
their own domain.
Asked if he was concerned
about making budget cuts around
the time of the highly-publicized
Centennial Celebration, Kennedy
said, "I don't look on it as a tar
nish. . . . People will respect us
for doing it."
In the interviews, Kennedy also
offered his reflections on other
current campus issues, including
the proposed alcohol policy, the
campus housing shortage and the
search for an Asian-American
studies professor.
Concerning the proposed alco
hol policy, which will be submitted

by March 1 to Kennedy for ap
proval, he indicated support for
the three proposed regulations: a
ban on alcohol at all athletic ac
tivities, an end to alcohol adver
tising at athletic events and
parking restrictions for those who
have been convicted of drunk
driving.
"You can have fun without fall
ing down on your face," he said,
emphasizing that the Stanford
community should practice
moderation in alcohol
consumption.
With a hearty "I swear it," Ken
nedy asserted the University will
soon guarantee four years of on
campus housing to all students,
though he offered few details
about the timeline of his promise.
While discussing other topics,
Kennedy said he was confused
about the circumstances sur
rounding Victor Nee, the Cornell
University sociology professor
who recently interviewed for the
post of Asian-American studies
professor. During his Stanford
visit, Nee criticized the selection
process for the position along with
the discipline of Asian-American
Studies itself.
Kennedy said, "1 don't think
he's obliged to defend anything he
said. ... He just didn't want an
ethnic studies label for (himself)."
