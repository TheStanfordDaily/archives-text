### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
The University committee
charged with making a $22 mil
lion budget slash and grappling
with how best to go about
streamlining Stanford's admin
istrative operations is slowly
getting to its feet.
The nameless committee, in
formally called the Rosse Com
mittee, was created by Provost
James Rosse just more than two
weeks ago when he announced
that the University will make
the cut from its operating
budget over the next 18 months.
The nine-member committee
includes administrators, profes
sors and corporate leaders from
outside the University. The
group will set dollar-amount

budget reduc
tion targets for
vice presidents
and deans, who
will create
departmental
task forces to
identify the spe
cific budget
cuts.
Committee

members met once last week
and are holding two meetings
this week. They are just begin
ning to define general goals and
procedures and have not
reached any major decisions,
Rosse said.
The committee's first
objective is to determine goals
for each of the University's
operational units: "budget re
duction goals, operation

redesign goals and culture
change goals," according to Vice
Provost Ray Bacchetti, a mem
ber of the committee.
An operational unit is an area
of the University supervised by
a vice president or dean.
The smaller task forces should
be appointed within 10 days to
two weeks, Rosse said. An
average task force will probably
consist of three to four members
selected from the organizational
unit, according to Su SchafTer,
vice president for administrative
resources and another commit
tee member.
Rosse told the Faculty Senate
Feb. 8 that staff layoffs mav be
required to complete the $22
million cut, though facultv and
