# Rosse Committee defining goals
## Group charged with making budget slash starts to formulate plans 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
The University committee
charged with making a $22 mil
lion budget slash and grappling
with how best to go about
streamlining Stanford's admin
istrative operations is slowly
getting to its feet.
The nameless committee, in
formally called the Rosse Com
mittee, was created by Provost
James Rosse just more than two
weeks ago when he announced
that the University will make
the cut from its operating
budget over the next 18 months.
The nine-member committee
includes administrators, profes
sors and corporate leaders from
outside the University. The
group will set dollar-amount

budget reduc
tion targets for
vice presidents
and deans, who
will create
departmental
task forces to
identify the spe
cific budget
cuts.
Committee

members met once last week
and are holding two meetings
this week. They are just begin
ning to define general goals and
procedures and have not
reached any major decisions,
Rosse said.
The committee's first
objective is to determine goals
for each of the University's
operational units: "budget re
duction goals, operation

redesign goals and culture
change goals," according to Vice
Provost Ray Bacchetti, a mem
ber of the committee.
An operational unit is an area
of the University supervised by
a vice president or dean.
The smaller task forces should
be appointed within 10 days to
two weeks, Rosse said. An
average task force will probably
consist of three to four members
selected from the organizational
unit, according to Su SchafTer,
vice president for administrative
resources and another commit
tee member.
Rosse told the Faculty Senate
Feb. 8 that staff layoffs mav be
required to complete the $22
million cut, though facultv and


Rosse
teaching positions will not be af
fected.
Schaffer said there is no guar
antee that staff will serve on the
task forces, though they will be
heavily consulted. Task force
members will be selected by the
appropriate vice president or
dean, with whom Rosse will be
working closely, she said.
Bacchetti said student involve
ment in the process has not been
discussed in committee meetings.
Another University committee,
Action Plans for Change, has been
absorbed into the Rosse Commit
tee and is continuing its work.

The goal of Action Plans has
been to examine the University's
organization and decision-making
processes and to recommend
changes to increase efficiency in
University bureaucracy. That goal
is nearly identical to that of the
Rosse Committee, though Action
Plans was not charged with re
ducing budgets by specific dollar
amounts.
"I don't think [Action Plans|
loses anything [by being absorbed
into the Rosse Committee].
Budgeting done in the context of
Action Plans principles is a much
better thing," said Vice President
for Information Resources Robert
Street, who chaired Action Plans
and now sits on the Rosse Com
mittee.
