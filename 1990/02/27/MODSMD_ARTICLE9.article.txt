# Wilbur Field to pose as Mount Olympus
## Farm's first Greek Week promotes AIDS awareness, ends with Greek Games 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
Wilbur Field is a poor substitute
for Mount Olympus, but it will
serve the purpose for torch
bearing fraternity and sorority
members as they compete in the
Greek Games this weekend.
Saturday's festivities will con
clude the first Stanford Greek
Week. The festival, which kicked
off last Saturday, has been
modeled loosely after Greek
Weeks at other colleges but in
volves an emphasis on public serv
ice absent at other schools.
The festival, co-sponsored by
the Interfraternity Council and
the Intersorority Council, will
center this year on the theme of
AIDS awareness.
Plans for Greek Week have been
in the works since last year. "Over
the summer, we researched what

other campuses do for Greek
Week," said IFC President Todd
Ortega, "and we found that there
isn't usually a theme." The IFC,
however, wanted to focus on some
thing "very timely," according to
Ortega.
"We chose the AIDS issue be
cause it's one which is becoming
more and more relevant to the
campus community," Ortega said.
An all-campus educational pre
sentation entitled, "Understand
ing AIDS: Using Our Heads and
Our Hearts," will be delivered
tonight in the Political Science De
partment, room 161 J. The pro
gram will be delivered by Pat
Fabiano, the director of Stanford's
Health Promotion Program, and
will explore the impact of AIDS
on college campuses.
Although many of its events are
open to the entire campus, the
festival's main purpose is to foster
a sense of community among

members of the Greek system.
The plans for the week include
an ongoing competition between
representatives of different frater
nal and sororal groups, several
public presentations and next
weekend's Greek Games, a full day
of competitive games between rep
resentatives of campus residences
as well as different Greek organ
izations.
The Greek Week festivities
began on Saturday with "Kids'
Day." A carnival atmosphere over
took Wilbur Field as activities
such as face-painting, field games
and juggling were offered to
children from Escondido Village
Elementary School.
The children also participated
in the creation of a get-well card
for AIDS patients at Stanford
Hospital.
Greek Week events continued
Sunday with an ISC candle
lighting in front of Memorial Au

ditorium, and a competitive game
of Twister was held in White
Plaza yesterday. A blood drive was
also held yesterday.
Other Greek Week events in
clude an all-campus Letters Day,
when fraternity and sorority
members will wear their Greek
letters; a talk by William Keim,
a motivational speaker, entitled
"Demythologizing the Animal
House: The Real Meaning of
Greek Life"; a free-throw contest
at Friday's women's basketball
game against UC-Berkeley; and a
toga party Saturday night.
In planning the week, the IFC
and ISC "wanted to get each of
the fraternities and sororities in
volved as an entire Greek com
munity," said Ortega.
"We have been working to
gether to put this on," said Or
tega, "and so far each organi
zation has really gotten involved.
It seems to be a success."
