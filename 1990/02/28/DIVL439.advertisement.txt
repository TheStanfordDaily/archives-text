90% of campus rapes start here.
Whenever there's drinking or drugs, things can get out of hand.
So its no surprise that most campus rapes involve alcohol.
But men should know that under any circumstances, sex without
the other person's consent is considered rape. A felony, punishable
by prison. And drinking is no excuse.
That's why, when you party, it's good to know what your limits are.
You see, a little sobering thought now can save you from a big
problem later.
