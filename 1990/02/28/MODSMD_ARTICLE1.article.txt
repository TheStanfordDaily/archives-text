# The
						Silence Of Survivors
## Hazy definition, lack of protocol impede reporting 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
"Michelle," a freshman, went to a
party in November with a friend in her
dorm and his male friend.
She didn't know his friend, but when
they walked to the party they talked a
lot. Throughout the night they talked
and began to get to know each other.
"I thought he was a nice guy," Michelle
remembers.
They spent all day Sunday together
and then decided to go on a walk. At
Lake Lagunita, Michelle and the man
started to kiss.
"1 didn't think anything was bad
about that," Michelle recalls. "I felt that
was OK. I didn't feel I was putting
myself in jeopardy."
But then he went further. "It wasn't
violent or anything," she explains. "But
there was so much pressure that I
froze."
Michelle says she was afraid to do
anything. "I kept saying no, but 1
couldn't scream," she remembers. "If I
screamed he would have done something
even more angry than if I hadn't
screamed," she explains.
Then he raped her, she says.
"It was real quick, but that was the
way it happened," she says.
When they walked back, Michelle
didn't want to say anything. "1 think
he knew something was wrong, and he
knew what he did wasn't right," she
says. "But I just froze."
Michelle didn't tell anyone for three
weeks that she had been raped. "I didn't
want to make a big scandal, and I didn't
want him to get the satisfaction" of
making her feel bo ashamed.
"I felt it was my fault. I felt so guilty
that it didn't enter my mind to report
it," Michelle remembers. "I feel it was
my fault for not screaming even though
I said no."
It wasn't until Dead Week, three
weeks after the incident, that the friend
with whom she went to the party —
not the man who raped her — realized
something was wrong. When she told
him what had happened, he realized she
had been raped.
"He was really supportive. Now I'm
pretty much OK, but it was because of
my friend's help," she says.
Michelle says she wrote the alleged
assailant a letter explaining her view of
the incident. He wrote back, saying he

hadn't realized she felt raped. "It made
me feel good that he won't do it again,"
she says.
Michelle never reported the incident.
"I would have never thought of reporting
it," she says."I didn't want to cause a
public scandal that would hurt me."
"I still feel guilty about it. I wouldn't
want to call a hotline; it's so impersonal,"
she explains. "I felt guilty, like they
wouldn't believe me."
Michelle knew there was counseling
available through Cowell Student Health
Center but could not make herself call.
"There were places you could call, but
I was afraid to pick up the phone. You
feel like a number."

Like Michelle, many people decide not
to report acquaintance rape, and those
who work with the issue say a main
reason is that the University has no
formal protocol for reporting highly
sensitive cases like rape.
According to senior Suzanna Mak,
founder and administrative director of
Heightened Education on Acquaintance
Rape, "Stanford lags behind the nation
in (not) having a protocol . . . and that
bothers me."
When researching for the University
Task Force on Sexual Assault, junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the task
force, realized "there was nowhere in
writing that tells one where to report
(a sexual assault)."
For a victim of sexual assault, this
absence of a policy could discourage
reporting. If victims "don't see it
anywhere and . . . don't know what to
do," they will be less likely to report
the incident, O'Brien says.
Because of the nature of rape, in which
a victim feels "guilt, shame and fear,"
and because of a strong cultural attitude
that women bring rape on themselves,
