# The 						Silence Of Survivors
## Hazy definition, lack of protocol impede reporting 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
"Michelle," a freshman, went to a
party in November with a friend in her
dorm and his male friend.
She didn't know his friend, but when
they walked to the party they talked a
lot. Throughout the night they talked
and began to get to know each other.
"I thought he was a nice guy," Michelle
remembers.
They spent all day Sunday together
and then decided to go on a walk. At
Lake Lagunita, Michelle and the man
started to kiss.
"1 didn't think anything was bad
about that," Michelle recalls. "I felt that
was OK. I didn't feel I was putting
myself in jeopardy."
But then he went further. "It wasn't
violent or anything," she explains. "But
there was so much pressure that I
froze."
Michelle says she was afraid to do
anything. "I kept saying no, but 1
couldn't scream," she remembers. "If I
screamed he would have done something
even more angry than if I hadn't
screamed," she explains.
Then he raped her, she says.
"It was real quick, but that was the
way it happened," she says.
When they walked back, Michelle
didn't want to say anything. "1 think
he knew something was wrong, and he
knew what he did wasn't right," she
says. "But I just froze."
Michelle didn't tell anyone for three
weeks that she had been raped. "I didn't
want to make a big scandal, and I didn't
want him to get the satisfaction" of
making her feel bo ashamed.
"I felt it was my fault. I felt so guilty
that it didn't enter my mind to report
it," Michelle remembers. "I feel it was
my fault for not screaming even though
I said no."
It wasn't until Dead Week, three
weeks after the incident, that the friend
with whom she went to the party —
not the man who raped her — realized
something was wrong. When she told
him what had happened, he realized she
had been raped.
"He was really supportive. Now I'm
pretty much OK, but it was because of
my friend's help," she says.
Michelle says she wrote the alleged
assailant a letter explaining her view of
the incident. He wrote back, saying he

hadn't realized she felt raped. "It made
me feel good that he won't do it again,"
she says.
Michelle never reported the incident.
"I would have never thought of reporting
it," she says."I didn't want to cause a
public scandal that would hurt me."
"I still feel guilty about it. I wouldn't
want to call a hotline; it's so impersonal,"
she explains. "I felt guilty, like they
wouldn't believe me."
Michelle knew there was counseling
available through Cowell Student Health
Center but could not make herself call.
"There were places you could call, but
I was afraid to pick up the phone. You
feel like a number."

Like Michelle, many people decide not
to report acquaintance rape, and those
who work with the issue say a main
reason is that the University has no
formal protocol for reporting highly
sensitive cases like rape.
According to senior Suzanna Mak,
founder and administrative director of
Heightened Education on Acquaintance
Rape, "Stanford lags behind the nation
in (not) having a protocol . . . and that
bothers me."
When researching for the University
Task Force on Sexual Assault, junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the task
force, realized "there was nowhere in
writing that tells one where to report
(a sexual assault)."
For a victim of sexual assault, this
absence of a policy could discourage
reporting. If victims "don't see it
anywhere and . . . don't know what to
do," they will be less likely to report
the incident, O'Brien says.
Because of the nature of rape, in which
a victim feels "guilt, shame and fear,"
and because of a strong cultural attitude
that women bring rape on themselves,

"not knowing what to do or to whom to
report the rape is a serious problem,"
she adds.
Currently, the task force is developing
a written protocol. An interim report has
been released, listing reasons and options
for reporting rape. The full report, with
more complete recommendations for
changing University policy on sexual as
sault, is set for publication in November.
But for some people, not reporting a
rape has less to do with the absence of
a protocol and more to do with their own
doubt that the experience was a rape.

During her sophomore year, "Brittany"
was involved with a male student. While
they had been intimate before, they had
never had sexual intercourse.
One evening they were sitting together
on a bed, kissing.
Brittany, now a senior, says she told
him she didn't want to "fool around"
that night.
He then tried to pull down her under
pants. "It started becoming a tug-of-war
with my underpants," Brittany says. The
male student started to coerce her into
having sexual intercourse, and she said
she did not want to.
"Then, all of a sudden when he realized
I wasn't going to have sex, he let go of
my underpants and rolled over, and his
tone changed."
The male kept trying to talk her into
having sex, and his words turned "nasty,"
Brittany says."It just kept going on and
on," Brittany says. He got frustrated and
said he didn't know why he was attracted
to her at all, she explains.
Finally, she says he told her, "You know
what your problem is?"
Brittany says, at that point she should
have said, " 'Yeah, I'm in bed with you'
and gotten up and left."
But she didn't. Instead, she asked him,
"What?"
He said, "You're just way too serious.
You don't know how to have a good time."
Something triggered inside Brittany.
She had a flashback to another painful
experience and felt she had to prove him
and herself wrong by showing him she
could "have a good time."
He wouldn't talk to her.
"I felt extremely lonely and extremely
rejected," she recalls. "I was so confused."
She says,"The only way I felt I could
make things better was to have sex. I
just didn't feel like I had any options."
Brittany says she finally said she would
have sex with him. While he was on top
of her, she lay on the bed crying and
undemonstrative, she says."I have never
in my life had painful sex except for
then."
"There was a part of me that was
sitting up on the shelf condemning what
was going on and hating myself and
hating him. And then there was the part
of me that was present in the bed and
that was crying. Those two parts were
cut off from one another," she explains.
"I just wanted it to be over," she says.
Because she had consented to have sex,
she felt like she had given up her right
to say no. In her mind, it couldn't be
rape because she had agreed, she ex
plains.
Now she says she realizes, "I was emo
tionally and verbally coerced into having
sex. That's not consenting."
Though the male student refused to
talk with Brittany the next day, they
eventually talked about that night. "I
basically just started screaming at him
and telling him how incredibly painful it
was for me and saying how I couldn't
understand that if he said he cared about
me how this could happen.
"I told him that he had coerced me
into having sex," she explains.
"What was so strange was that he was
shocked. He was completely unaware that
this was what I was experiencing," she
says.
"And to me that was one of the most
terrifying parts, was that this could be
going on, and I could be lying there crying
on the bed, and he could be so completely
in his own world that he didn't even
notice it."
After their conversation, Brittany says,
the male student told her he was very
sorry.
Brittany decided not to report the in
cident to the University. "I didn't think

of pressing charges. I was trying to sort
out my own feelings of responsibility and
guilt for what happened," she says. Like
Michelle, Brittany still feels guilt and
shame about what happened. "There is
a part of me that negates what happened
and how I feel about it."
Defining the incident as rape, Brittany
says, is extremely painful. "It's almost
scarier to say that it's rape than not to
admit it, because it's really terrifying."
And there is still a part of her that
feels it was as much her fault as it was
his, she says.

Sexual assault does not happen only
to women. In last spring's Rape Educa
tion Project survey, 16 percent of male
graduate students and 10 percent of male
undergraduates indicated that they had
been coerced into sexual activity against
their will.
Three years ago, when "Jeff' was a
junior, he gradually got to know a male
teaching assistant in one of his classes.
They became friends, and Jeff respected
and trusted the graduate student.
One evening the TA, who was in his
mid-thirties, invited Jeff to his apart
ment. After an hour of talking, the TA
offered Jeff a back rub to help him relax.
Jeff agreed, not thinking twice about it.
Then the TA asked him to take off his
clothes, and he did.
The TA began massaging him, but then
he moved down to Jeffs genitals. The
TA, who was fully clothed, began to mas
turbate Jeff.
"At the time I was sort of trying to
distance myself from the situation. I was
trying to make myself think of something
else and pretend that I wasn't there. At
some point it just snapped and I said,
'Get a hold of yourself, you don't like it,
and you shouldn't like it. Leave.' "
He told the TA to stop. As he was
putting his clothes on, the TA tried to
convince him not to leave. "He kept say
ing that he didn't want me to spend the
night alone," Jeff recalls.
Jeff tried to deny what happened to
him. "I put so much trust in him that
I was trying to convince myself that he
wouldn't really do this."
Jeff didn't tell anyone about his expe
rience for two years. "I didn't identify it
as a sexual assault. I mean, I didn't know
what to call it."
Largely because most literature and
fliers that he saw about sexual assault
discussed issues about men raping wom
en, Jeff says he never made the connec
tion that he — as a man — was sexually
assaulted.
The TA called Jeff several times and
Jeff saw him in class, but Jeff never
talked with him about the experience. "I
was really scared of him, and I just didn't
know what to do about it."
Jeff thought constantly about the as
sault and had nightmares of being pinned
up against a wall by the TA. In the
dreams, Jeff always felt the incident was
his own fault. His grades suffered because
he couldn't concentrate on his work, and
he dropped many of his classes.
After stopping out for a year — which
he had planned to do before the incident

— he came back to campus, still not
identifying the incident as sexual assault.
"I made a very concerted effort to forget
it."
Finally, Jeff told a male friend of his
who was a member of the Rape Education
Project.
He explains that what really bothered
him about the experience "was not that
he was a man, but rather it was the
sense of powerlessness, that I lost control
of what was going on and that he was
using me."
In recent months, Jeff has met with
two women — featured earlier in this
series — who survived rape and helped
him label his experience as sexual assault.
"By having a word for it, it gave me a
lot more justification to understand what
it had put me through."
Jeff says:"I don't call what happened
to me rape. It was a sexual assault. We
didn't have intercourse. We very well
might have, but I stopped it before then."
Jeff has since begun meeting regularly
with a psychiatrist at Counseling and
Psychological Services.

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole spec
ulates that because victims like Michelle,
Brittany and Jeff have difficulty defining
their experiences as sexual assault, they
do not want to press official charges.
"Not understanding what it means
clears a path to alternatives to formal
reporting," Cole says. "If you can't clas
sify the experience as a crime, you may
be less likely to report it" to authorities.
Brittany says: "Defining it is the most
ambiguous. To me, it is not clear when
it is coercion and when it is date rape
— and when coercion and date rape are
the same thing."
Jeff says,"I think there is a misiden
tification of rape as an expression of
sexuality. It's violence; it's power."
Mak says that because there is no for
mal definition of what constitutes rape,
"people don't know what can be pun
ished. There is so much ambiguity and
so much contradiction there that it
prevents people from reporting."
According to University Ombudsperson
Leah Kaplan, creating a clear under
standing of what rape is helps both the
victim and the assailant. "There's some
thing in labeling it and demystifying it,"
she says, "that helps people understand
when they have done something wrong."
Due to the lack of awareness, the Uni
versity needs to publicize a formal defi
nition and condemnation of rape,
according to Mak and O'Brien.
"I'm not lumping everything on Jud
icial Affairs," Mak says."The University
is wholly responsible, and they make zero
— no acknowledgment — that the crime
occurs. They won't define what it is, they
won't say whether they are for or against
it, they won't take a stand," Mak says.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
says: "You don't take advantage of some
one or create a situation where someone
is not consciously able to make a decision.
That seems to me clearly wrong." But
in most cases, the social norm is not
clear, he adds.
For Brittany, a definition "was really

empowering. I was claiming back my
right to say no and that it's not OK for
me to be coerced," she says.
Having a University definition of
sexual assault would have been "crucial"
for Jeff in coming to terms with his
experience, he says.
Kaplan, who handled 12 student griev
ances of sexual harassment against stu
dents, staff and faculty last year, points
out that the University has an official
"Policy on Combating Sexual Harass
ment." A similar policy about sexual as
sault could be written, she says.
The policy against sexual harassment,
which was developed in the late 19705,
both defines and condemns harassing be
havior and warns possible violators of
the consequences. It also encourages stu
dents who believe they have been
harassed to report complaints to the Uni
versity, either through formal or informal
channels.
According to Kaplan, the policy com
bating sexual harassment is a par
ticularization of the Fundamental
Standard.
Lyons says a clear definition would be
"terrific," but he hopes it would not be
come a rule. A statement condemning
rape would be helpful but won't prevent
rapes from occurring, he says. "State
ments don't alter behavior, but they cause
people to stop and think about their be
havior," Lyons says.
Cole adds that when prosecuting sexual
assault cases, she looks for evidence —
not definitions. "The definition isn't at
issue. Frequently it's the evidence that's
at issue. If someone describes behavior
that to me sounds like rape, I don't need
to look up the definition, I look to see if
the allegation can be proved," she ex
plains.
Cole says that before going to the Jud
icial Affairs Office, students need to un
derstand why they are reporting sexual
assault and to determine what they want
in doing so.
She says that it would be unfair to
"have people coming here with expecta
tions that don't make sense."
Reasons to report
For the rape victim, however, reporting
may be one of the steps in the healing
process.
Both "Pamela" and "Nina" — whose
experiences were described earlier in this
series — did report their rape experi
ences. Despite their objections to the jud
icial process, they both stress the
importance of reporting rape and other
sexual assaults.
"Experience has shown that for sur
vivors, that can be the beginning of
healing," said Christine Griffith, director
of the Stanford Rape Response Group.
In addition, reporting "may have an im
pact on educating students on how we
treat each other."
O'Brien outlines several reasons for
reporting rape to the University. "If you

go through the judicial process, [the as
sailant] will understand that what they
did is wrong."
In addition, reporting and subsequent
punishment may prevent the assailant
from doing it again, O'Brien says.
"The only way to stop the crime is to
encourage reporting and to take action,"
Pamela says. "Otherwise ithe rapist 1 al
most gets rewarded by raping."
Reporting rape also makes it "more
conducive for other women to report,"
according to O'Brien.
Further, Mak says that it is important
for a rape victim to be able to report the
incident and see punitive action taken
against the assailant. "It's the Universi
ty's obligation to create avenues for
reporting. Even if there is only one person
who wants to report in the next 10 years,
she or he has got to have the option."
'It's not going to end'
The lives of these students who have
been sexually assaulted have been forever
changed by their experiences. Both
Pamela and Nina began working at rape
crisis centers and have become very in
volved in campus rape education.
"This was one little night of my life,
and it's not going to end," Nina says."It
has affected every aspect of my life. I
can't go running, it affected my summer
job, there are parties I can't go to."
Pamela says she has had to accept that
she, and not someone she knows or heard
about, has been raped. "I've had to in
tegrate being a rape victim into my iden
tity," she explains. "A lot of people say
(to me), 'OK, it's over.' But I go to bed
with it every night. Not a day goes by
that I don't think about it."
Michelle, Jeff and Brittany are still
working through their feelings of guilt.
Brittany says,"I am still sort of sifting
out my own baggage, and I feel like
(reporting) wouldn't have worked for
me."
Jeff says: "Like it or not, I know it's
a part of me. I can never leave it behind,
and I don't want to leave it behind. I
don't want to forget it."
Time has helped both Brittany and
Michelle accept the fact that they were
raped.
Michelle says:"I feel like I can talk
about it now. This is an amazing step.
Back in November and December I didn't
even want to think about it."
For Brittany, taking SWOPSI 173, Is
sues in Self-Defense for Women, has
helped her to realize what happened and
to deal with her emotions.
Although Nina's case is officially closed,
she filed a grievance against Cole in No
vember, including charges that Cole mis
handled her case and that her rights to
confidentiality had been violated. This
grievance is still being investigated by
two University officials.
"I've told my story so many times and
I feel that I've gotten a lot of empty
promises," Nina says. "I'm still waiting
for something to be done."

"Michelle," a freshman, went to a
party in November with a friend in her
dorm and his male friend.
She didn't know his friend, but when
they walked to the party they talked a
lot. Throughout the night they talked
and began to get to know each other.
"I thought he was a nice guy," Michelle
remembers.
They spent all day Sunday together
and then decided to go on a walk. At
Lake Lagunita, Michelle and the man
started to kiss.
"1 didn't think anything was bad

even more angry than if I hadn't

Then he raped her, she says.
"It was real quick, but that was the

When they walked back, Michelle
didn't want to say anything. "1 think
he knew something was wrong, and he
knew what he did wasn't right," she
says. "But I just froze."

that it didn't enter my mind to report

It wasn't until Dead Week, three

with whom she went to the party —
not the man who raped her — realized
something was wrong. When she told
him what had happened, he realized she
had been raped.
"He was really supportive. Now I'm
pretty much OK, but it was because of
my friend's help," she says.
Michelle says she wrote the alleged
assailant a letter explaining her view of
the incident. He wrote back, saying he

hadn't realized she felt raped. "It made
me feel good that he won't do it again,"
she says.
Michelle never reported the incident.
"I would have never thought of reporting

he was a man, but rather it was the
sense of powerlessness, that I lost control
of what was going on and that he was
using me."
In recent months, Jeff has met with
two women — featured earlier in this
series — who survived rape and helped
him label his experience as sexual assault.
"By having a word for it, it gave me a
lot more justification to understand what
it had put me through."
Jeff says:"I don't call what happened
to me rape. It was a sexual assault. We
didn't have intercourse. We very well
might have, but I stopped it before then."
Jeff has since begun meeting regularly
with a psychiatrist at Counseling and
Psychological Services.

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole spec
ulates that because victims like Michelle,
Brittany and Jeff have difficulty defining
their experiences as sexual assault, they
do not want to press official charges.
"Not understanding what it means
clears a path to alternatives to formal
reporting," Cole says. "If you can't clas
sify the experience as a crime, you may
be less likely to report it" to authorities.
Brittany says: "Defining it is the most
ambiguous. To me, it is not clear when
it is coercion and when it is date rape
— and when coercion and date rape are
the same thing."
Jeff says,"I think there is a misiden
tification of rape as an expression of
sexuality. It's violence; it's power."
Mak says that because there is no for
mal definition of what constitutes rape,
"people don't know what can be pun
ished. There is so much ambiguity and
so much contradiction there that it
prevents people from reporting."
According to University Ombudsperson
Leah Kaplan, creating a clear under
standing of what rape is helps both the
victim and the assailant. "There's some
thing in labeling it and demystifying it,"
she says, "that helps people understand
when they have done something wrong."
Due to the lack of awareness, the Uni
versity needs to publicize a formal defi
nition and condemnation of rape,
according to Mak and O'Brien.
"I'm not lumping everything on Jud
icial Affairs," Mak says."The University
is wholly responsible, and they make zero
— no acknowledgment — that the crime
occurs. They won't define what it is, they
won't say whether they are for or against
it, they won't take a stand," Mak says.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
says: "You don't take advantage of some
one or create a situation where someone
is not consciously able to make a decision.
That seems to me clearly wrong." But
in most cases, the social norm is not
clear, he adds.
For Brittany, a definition "was really

empowering. I was claiming back my
right to say no and that it's not OK for
me to be coerced," she says.
Having a University definition of
sexual assault would have been "crucial"
for Jeff in coming to terms with his
experience, he says.
Kaplan, who handled 12 student griev
ances of sexual harassment against stu
dents, staff and faculty last year, points
out that the University has an official
"Policy on Combating Sexual Harass
ment." A similar policy about sexual as
sault could be written, she says.
The policy against sexual harassment,
which was developed in the late 19705,
both defines and condemns harassing be
havior and warns possible violators of
the consequences. It also encourages stu
dents who believe they have been
harassed to report complaints to the Uni
versity, either through formal or informal
channels.
According to Kaplan, the policy com
bating sexual harassment is a par
ticularization of the Fundamental
Standard.
Lyons says a clear definition would be
"terrific," but he hopes it would not be
come a rule. A statement condemning
rape would be helpful but won't prevent
rapes from occurring, he says. "State
ments don't alter behavior, but they cause
people to stop and think about their be
havior," Lyons says.
Cole adds that when prosecuting sexual
assault cases, she looks for evidence —
not definitions. "The definition isn't at
issue. Frequently it's the evidence that's
at issue. If someone describes behavior
that to me sounds like rape, I don't need
to look up the definition, I look to see if
the allegation can be proved," she ex
plains.
Cole says that before going to the Jud
icial Affairs Office, students need to un
derstand why they are reporting sexual
assault and to determine what they want
in doing so.
She says that it would be unfair to
"have people coming here with expecta
tions that don't make sense."
Reasons to report
For the rape victim, however, reporting
may be one of the steps in the healing
process.
Both "Pamela" and "Nina" — whose
experiences were described earlier in this
series — did report their rape experi
ences. Despite their objections to the jud
icial process, they both stress the
importance of reporting rape and other
sexual assaults.
"Experience has shown that for sur
vivors, that can be the beginning of
healing," said Christine Griffith, director
of the Stanford Rape Response Group.
In addition, reporting "may have an im
pact on educating students on how we
treat each other."
O'Brien outlines several reasons for
reporting rape to the University. "If you

go through the judicial process, [the as
sailant] will understand that what they
did is wrong."
In addition, reporting and subsequent
punishment may prevent the assailant
from doing it again, O'Brien says.
"The only way to stop the crime is to
encourage reporting and to take action,"
Pamela says. "Otherwise ithe rapist 1 al
most gets rewarded by raping."
Reporting rape also makes it "more
conducive for other women to report,"
according to O'Brien.
Further, Mak says that it is important
for a rape victim to be able to report the
incident and see punitive action taken
against the assailant. "It's the Universi
ty's obligation to create avenues for
reporting. Even if there is only one person
who wants to report in the next 10 years,
she or he has got to have the option."
'It's not going to end'
The lives of these students who have
been sexually assaulted have been forever
changed by their experiences. Both
Pamela and Nina began working at rape
crisis centers and have become very in
volved in campus rape education.
"This was one little night of my life,
and it's not going to end," Nina says."It
has affected every aspect of my life. I
can't go running, it affected my summer
job, there are parties I can't go to."
Pamela says she has had to accept that
she, and not someone she knows or heard
about, has been raped. "I've had to in
tegrate being a rape victim into my iden
tity," she explains. "A lot of people say
(to me), 'OK, it's over.' But I go to bed
with it every night. Not a day goes by
that I don't think about it."
Michelle, Jeff and Brittany are still
working through their feelings of guilt.
Brittany says,"I am still sort of sifting
out my own baggage, and I feel like
(reporting) wouldn't have worked for
me."
Jeff says: "Like it or not, I know it's
a part of me. I can never leave it behind,
and I don't want to leave it behind. I
don't want to forget it."
Time has helped both Brittany and
Michelle accept the fact that they were
raped.
Michelle says:"I feel like I can talk
about it now. This is an amazing step.
Back in November and December I didn't
even want to think about it."
For Brittany, taking SWOPSI 173, Is
sues in Self-Defense for Women, has
helped her to realize what happened and
to deal with her emotions.
Although Nina's case is officially closed,
she filed a grievance against Cole in No
vember, including charges that Cole mis
handled her case and that her rights to
confidentiality had been violated. This
grievance is still being investigated by
two University officials.
"I've told my story so many times and
I feel that I've gotten a lot of empty
promises," Nina says. "I'm still waiting
for something to be done."

"Michelle," a freshman, went to a
party in November with a friend in her
dorm and his male friend.
She didn't know his friend, but when
they walked to the party they talked a
lot. Throughout the night they talked
and began to get to know each other.
"I thought he was a nice guy," Michelle
remembers.
They spent all day Sunday together
and then decided to go on a walk. At
Lake Lagunita, Michelle and the man
started to kiss.
"1 didn't think anything was bad
about that," Michelle recalls. "I felt that
was OK. I didn't feel I was putting
myself in jeopardy."
But then he went further. "It wasn't
violent or anything," she explains. "But
there was so much pressure that I
froze."
Michelle says she was afraid to do
anything. "I kept saying no, but 1
couldn't scream," she remembers. "If I
screamed he would have done something
even more angry than if I hadn't
screamed," she explains.
Then he raped her, she says.
"It was real quick, but that was the
way it happened," she says.
When they walked back, Michelle
didn't want to say anything. "1 think
he knew something was wrong, and he
knew what he did wasn't right," she
says. "But I just froze."
Michelle didn't tell anyone for three
weeks that she had been raped. "I didn't
want to make a big scandal, and I didn't
want him to get the satisfaction" of
making her feel bo ashamed.
"I felt it was my fault. I felt so guilty
that it didn't enter my mind to report
it," Michelle remembers. "I feel it was
my fault for not screaming even though
I said no."
It wasn't until Dead Week, three
weeks after the incident, that the friend
with whom she went to the party —
not the man who raped her — realized
something was wrong. When she told
him what had happened, he realized she
had been raped.
"He was really supportive. Now I'm
pretty much OK, but it was because of
my friend's help," she says.
Michelle says she wrote the alleged
assailant a letter explaining her view of
the incident. He wrote back, saying he

hadn't realized she felt raped. "It made
me feel good that he won't do it again,"
she says.
Michelle never reported the incident.
"I would have never thought of reporting
it," she says."I didn't want to cause a
public scandal that would hurt me."
"I still feel guilty about it. I wouldn't
want to call a hotline; it's so impersonal,"
she explains. "I felt guilty, like they
wouldn't believe me."
Michelle knew there was counseling
available through Cowell Student Health
Center but could not make herself call.
"There were places you could call, but
I was afraid to pick up the phone. You
feel like a number."

Like Michelle, many people decide not
to report acquaintance rape, and those
who work with the issue say a main
reason is that the University has no
formal protocol for reporting highly
sensitive cases like rape.
According to senior Suzanna Mak,
founder and administrative director of
Heightened Education on Acquaintance
Rape, "Stanford lags behind the nation
in (not) having a protocol . . . and that
bothers me."
When researching for the University
Task Force on Sexual Assault, junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the task
force, realized "there was nowhere in
writing that tells one where to report
(a sexual assault)."
For a victim of sexual assault, this
absence of a policy could discourage
reporting. If victims "don't see it
anywhere and . . . don't know what to
do," they will be less likely to report
the incident, O'Brien says.
Because of the nature of rape, in which
a victim feels "guilt, shame and fear,"
and because of a strong cultural attitude
that women bring rape on themselves,

"not knowing what to do or to whom to
report the rape is a serious problem,"
she adds.
Currently, the task force is developing
a written protocol. An interim report has
been released, listing reasons and options
for reporting rape. The full report, with
more complete recommendations for
changing University policy on sexual as
sault, is set for publication in November.
But for some people, not reporting a
rape has less to do with the absence of
a protocol and more to do with their own
doubt that the experience was a rape.

During her sophomore year, "Brittany"
was involved with a male student. While
they had been intimate before, they had
never had sexual intercourse.
One evening they were sitting together
on a bed, kissing.
Brittany, now a senior, says she told
him she didn't want to "fool around"
that night.
He then tried to pull down her under
pants. "It started becoming a tug-of-war
with my underpants," Brittany says. The
male student started to coerce her into
having sexual intercourse, and she said
she did not want to.
"Then, all of a sudden when he realized
I wasn't going to have sex, he let go of
my underpants and rolled over, and his
tone changed."
The male kept trying to talk her into
having sex, and his words turned "nasty,"
Brittany says."It just kept going on and
on," Brittany says. He got frustrated and
said he didn't know why he was attracted
to her at all, she explains.
Finally, she says he told her, "You know
what your problem is?"
Brittany says, at that point she should
have said, " 'Yeah, I'm in bed with you'
and gotten up and left."
But she didn't. Instead, she asked him,
"What?"
He said, "You're just way too serious.
You don't know how to have a good time."
Something triggered inside Brittany.
She had a flashback to another painful
experience and felt she had to prove him
and herself wrong by showing him she
could "have a good time."
He wouldn't talk to her.
"I felt extremely lonely and extremely
rejected," she recalls. "I was so confused."
She says,"The only way I felt I could
make things better was to have sex. I
just didn't feel like I had any options."
Brittany says she finally said she would
have sex with him. While he was on top
of her, she lay on the bed crying and
undemonstrative, she says."I have never
in my life had painful sex except for
then."
"There was a part of me that was
sitting up on the shelf condemning what
was going on and hating myself and
hating him. And then there was the part
of me that was present in the bed and
that was crying. Those two parts were
cut off from one another," she explains.
"I just wanted it to be over," she says.
Because she had consented to have sex,
she felt like she had given up her right
to say no. In her mind, it couldn't be
rape because she had agreed, she ex
plains.
Now she says she realizes, "I was emo
tionally and verbally coerced into having
sex. That's not consenting."
Though the male student refused to
talk with Brittany the next day, they
eventually talked about that night. "I
basically just started screaming at him
and telling him how incredibly painful it
was for me and saying how I couldn't
understand that if he said he cared about
me how this could happen.
"I told him that he had coerced me
into having sex," she explains.
"What was so strange was that he was
shocked. He was completely unaware that
this was what I was experiencing," she
says.
"And to me that was one of the most
terrifying parts, was that this could be
going on, and I could be lying there crying
on the bed, and he could be so completely
in his own world that he didn't even
notice it."
After their conversation, Brittany says,
the male student told her he was very
sorry.
Brittany decided not to report the in
cident to the University. "I didn't think

of pressing charges. I was trying to sort
out my own feelings of responsibility and
guilt for what happened," she says. Like
Michelle, Brittany still feels guilt and
shame about what happened. "There is
a part of me that negates what happened
and how I feel about it."
Defining the incident as rape, Brittany
says, is extremely painful. "It's almost
scarier to say that it's rape than not to
admit it, because it's really terrifying."
And there is still a part of her that
feels it was as much her fault as it was
his, she says.

Sexual assault does not happen only
to women. In last spring's Rape Educa
tion Project survey, 16 percent of male
graduate students and 10 percent of male
undergraduates indicated that they had
been coerced into sexual activity against
their will.
Three years ago, when "Jeff' was a
junior, he gradually got to know a male
teaching assistant in one of his classes.
They became friends, and Jeff respected
and trusted the graduate student.
One evening the TA, who was in his
mid-thirties, invited Jeff to his apart
ment. After an hour of talking, the TA
offered Jeff a back rub to help him relax.
Jeff agreed, not thinking twice about it.
Then the TA asked him to take off his
clothes, and he did.
The TA began massaging him, but then
he moved down to Jeffs genitals. The
TA, who was fully clothed, began to mas
turbate Jeff.
"At the time I was sort of trying to
distance myself from the situation. I was
trying to make myself think of something
else and pretend that I wasn't there. At
some point it just snapped and I said,
'Get a hold of yourself, you don't like it,
and you shouldn't like it. Leave.' "
He told the TA to stop. As he was
putting his clothes on, the TA tried to
convince him not to leave. "He kept say
ing that he didn't want me to spend the
night alone," Jeff recalls.
Jeff tried to deny what happened to
him. "I put so much trust in him that
I was trying to convince myself that he
wouldn't really do this."
Jeff didn't tell anyone about his expe
rience for two years. "I didn't identify it
as a sexual assault. I mean, I didn't know
what to call it."
Largely because most literature and
fliers that he saw about sexual assault
discussed issues about men raping wom
en, Jeff says he never made the connec
tion that he — as a man — was sexually
assaulted.
The TA called Jeff several times and
Jeff saw him in class, but Jeff never
talked with him about the experience. "I
was really scared of him, and I just didn't
know what to do about it."
Jeff thought constantly about the as
sault and had nightmares of being pinned
up against a wall by the TA. In the
dreams, Jeff always felt the incident was
his own fault. His grades suffered because
he couldn't concentrate on his work, and
he dropped many of his classes.
After stopping out for a year — which
he had planned to do before the incident

— he came back to campus, still not
identifying the incident as sexual assault.
"I made a very concerted effort to forget
it."
Finally, Jeff told a male friend of his
who was a member of the Rape Education
Project.
He explains that what really bothered
him about the experience "was not that
he was a man, but rather it was the
sense of powerlessness, that I lost control
of what was going on and that he was
using me."
In recent months, Jeff has met with
two women — featured earlier in this
series — who survived rape and helped
him label his experience as sexual assault.
"By having a word for it, it gave me a
lot more justification to understand what
it had put me through."
Jeff says:"I don't call what happened
to me rape. It was a sexual assault. We
didn't have intercourse. We very well
might have, but I stopped it before then."
Jeff has since begun meeting regularly
with a psychiatrist at Counseling and

in (not) having a protocol . . . and that
bothers me."
When researching for the University
Task Force on Sexual Assault, junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the task
force, realized "there was nowhere in
writing that tells one where to report
(a sexual assault)."
For a victim of sexual assault, this
absence of a policy could discourage
reporting. If victims "don't see it
anywhere and . . . don't know what to
do," they will be less likely to report
the incident, O'Brien says.
Because of the nature of rape, in which
a victim feels "guilt, shame and fear,"
and because of a strong cultural attitude
that women bring rape on themselves,

"not knowing what to do or to whom to
report the rape is a serious problem,"
she adds.
Currently, the task force is developing
a written protocol. An interim report has
been released, listing reasons and options
for reporting rape. The full report, with
more complete recommendations for
changing University policy on sexual as
sault, is set for publication in November.
But for some people, not reporting a
rape has less to do with the absence of
a protocol and more to do with their own
doubt that the experience was a rape.

During her sophomore year, "Brittany"
was involved with a male student. While
they had been intimate before, they had
never had sexual intercourse.
One evening they were sitting together
on a bed, kissing.
Brittany, now a senior, says she told
him she didn't want to "fool around"
that night.
He then tried to pull down her under
pants. "It started becoming a tug-of-war
with my underpants," Brittany says. The
male student started to coerce her into
having sexual intercourse, and she said
she did not want to.
"Then, all of a sudden when he realized
I wasn't going to have sex, he let go of
my underpants and rolled over, and his
tone changed."
The male kept trying to talk her into
having sex, and his words turned "nasty,"
Brittany says."It just kept going on and
on," Brittany says. He got frustrated and
said he didn't know why he was attracted
to her at all, she explains.
Finally, she says he told her, "You know
what your problem is?"
Brittany says, at that point she should
have said, " 'Yeah, I'm in bed with you'
and gotten up and left."
But she didn't. Instead, she asked him,
"What?"
He said, "You're just way too serious.
You don't know how to have a good time."
Something triggered inside Brittany.
She had a flashback to another painful
experience and felt she had to prove him
and herself wrong by showing him she
could "have a good time."
He wouldn't talk to her.
"I felt extremely lonely and extremely
rejected," she recalls. "I was so confused."
She says,"The only way I felt I could
make things better was to have sex. I
just didn't feel like I had any options."
Brittany says she finally said she would
have sex with him. While he was on top
of her, she lay on the bed crying and
undemonstrative, she says."I have never
in my life had painful sex except for
then."
"There was a part of me that was
sitting up on the shelf condemning what
was going on and hating myself and
hating him. And then there was the part
of me that was present in the bed and
that was crying. Those two parts were
cut off from one another," she explains.
"I just wanted it to be over," she says.
Because she had consented to have sex,
she felt like she had given up her right
to say no. In her mind, it couldn't be
rape because she had agreed, she ex
plains.
Now she says she realizes, "I was emo
tionally and verbally coerced into having
sex. That's not consenting."
Though the male student refused to
talk with Brittany the next day, they
eventually talked about that night. "I
basically just started screaming at him
and telling him how incredibly painful it
was for me and saying how I couldn't
understand that if he said he cared about
me how this could happen.
"I told him that he had coerced me
into having sex," she explains.
"What was so strange was that he was
shocked. He was completely unaware that
this was what I was experiencing," she
says.
"And to me that was one of the most
terrifying parts, was that this could be
going on, and I could be lying there crying
on the bed, and he could be so completely
in his own world that he didn't even
notice it."
After their conversation, Brittany says,
the male student told her he was very
sorry.
Brittany decided not to report the in
cident to the University. "I didn't think

of pressing charges. I was trying to sort
out my own feelings of responsibility and
guilt for what happened," she says. Like
Michelle, Brittany still feels guilt and
shame about what happened. "There is
a part of me that negates what happened
and how I feel about it."
Defining the incident as rape, Brittany
says, is extremely painful. "It's almost
scarier to say that it's rape than not to
admit it, because it's really terrifying."
And there is still a part of her that
feels it was as much her fault as it was
his, she says.

Sexual assault does not happen only
to women. In last spring's Rape Educa
tion Project survey, 16 percent of male
graduate students and 10 percent of male
undergraduates indicated that they had
been coerced into sexual activity against
their will.
Three years ago, when "Jeff' was a
junior, he gradually got to know a male
teaching assistant in one of his classes.
They became friends, and Jeff respected
and trusted the graduate student.
One evening the TA, who was in his
mid-thirties, invited Jeff to his apart
ment. After an hour of talking, the TA
offered Jeff a back rub to help him relax.
Jeff agreed, not thinking twice about it.
Then the TA asked him to take off his
clothes, and he did.
The TA began massaging him, but then
he moved down to Jeffs genitals. The
TA, who was fully clothed, began to mas
turbate Jeff.
"At the time I was sort of trying to
distance myself from the situation. I was
trying to make myself think of something
else and pretend that I wasn't there. At
some point it just snapped and I said,
'Get a hold of yourself, you don't like it,
and you shouldn't like it. Leave.' "
He told the TA to stop. As he was
putting his clothes on, the TA tried to
convince him not to leave. "He kept say
ing that he didn't want me to spend the
night alone," Jeff recalls.
Jeff tried to deny what happened to
him. "I put so much trust in him that
I was trying to convince myself that he
wouldn't really do this."
Jeff didn't tell anyone about his expe
rience for two years. "I didn't identify it
as a sexual assault. I mean, I didn't know
what to call it."
Largely because most literature and
fliers that he saw about sexual assault
discussed issues about men raping wom
en, Jeff says he never made the connec
tion that he — as a man — was sexually
assaulted.
The TA called Jeff several times and
Jeff saw him in class, but Jeff never
talked with him about the experience. "I
was really scared of him, and I just didn't
know what to do about it."
Jeff thought constantly about the as
sault and had nightmares of being pinned
up against a wall by the TA. In the
dreams, Jeff always felt the incident was
his own fault. His grades suffered because
he couldn't concentrate on his work, and
he dropped many of his classes.
After stopping out for a year — which
he had planned to do before the incident

— he came back to campus, still not
identifying the incident as sexual assault.
"I made a very concerted effort to forget
it."
Finally, Jeff told a male friend of his
who was a member of the Rape Education
Project.
He explains that what really bothered
him about the experience "was not that
he was a man, but rather it was the
sense of powerlessness, that I lost control
of what was going on and that he was
using me."
In recent months, Jeff has met with
two women — featured earlier in this
series — who survived rape and helped
him label his experience as sexual assault.
"By having a word for it, it gave me a
lot more justification to understand what
it had put me through."
Jeff says:"I don't call what happened
to me rape. It was a sexual assault. We
didn't have intercourse. We very well
might have, but I stopped it before then."
Jeff has since begun meeting regularly
with a psychiatrist at Counseling and
Psychological Services.

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole spec
ulates that because victims like Michelle,
Brittany and Jeff have difficulty defining
their experiences as sexual assault, they
do not want to press official charges.
"Not understanding what it means
clears a path to alternatives to formal
reporting," Cole says. "If you can't clas
sify the experience as a crime, you may
be less likely to report it" to authorities.
Brittany says: "Defining it is the most
ambiguous. To me, it is not clear when
it is coercion and when it is date rape
— and when coercion and date rape are
the same thing."
Jeff says,"I think there is a misiden
tification of rape as an expression of
sexuality. It's violence; it's power."
Mak says that because there is no for
mal definition of what constitutes rape,
"people don't know what can be pun
ished. There is so much ambiguity and
so much contradiction there that it
prevents people from reporting."
According to University Ombudsperson
Leah Kaplan, creating a clear under
standing of what rape is helps both the
victim and the assailant. "There's some
thing in labeling it and demystifying it,"
she says, "that helps people understand
when they have done something wrong."
Due to the lack of awareness, the Uni
versity needs to publicize a formal defi
nition and condemnation of rape,
according to Mak and O'Brien.
"I'm not lumping everything on Jud
icial Affairs," Mak says."The University
is wholly responsible, and they make zero
— no acknowledgment — that the crime
occurs. They won't define what it is, they
won't say whether they are for or against
it, they won't take a stand," Mak says.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
says: "You don't take advantage of some
one or create a situation where someone
is not consciously able to make a decision.
That seems to me clearly wrong." But
in most cases, the social norm is not
clear, he adds.
For Brittany, a definition "was really

empowering. I was claiming back my
right to say no and that it's not OK for
me to be coerced," she says.
Having a University definition of
sexual assault would have been "crucial"
for Jeff in coming to terms with his
experience, he says.
Kaplan, who handled 12 student griev
ances of sexual harassment against stu
dents, staff and faculty last year, points
out that the University has an official
"Policy on Combating Sexual Harass
ment." A similar policy about sexual as
sault could be written, she says.
The policy against sexual harassment,
which was developed in the late 19705,
both defines and condemns harassing be
havior and warns possible violators of
the consequences. It also encourages stu
dents who believe they have been
harassed to report complaints to the Uni
versity, either through formal or informal
channels.
According to Kaplan, the policy com
bating sexual harassment is a par
ticularization of the Fundamental
Standard.
Lyons says a clear definition would be
"terrific," but he hopes it would not be
come a rule. A statement condemning
rape would be helpful but won't prevent
rapes from occurring, he says. "State
ments don't alter behavior, but they cause
people to stop and think about their be
havior," Lyons says.
Cole adds that when prosecuting sexual
assault cases, she looks for evidence —
not definitions. "The definition isn't at
issue. Frequently it's the evidence that's
at issue. If someone describes behavior
that to me sounds like rape, I don't need
to look up the definition, I look to see if
the allegation can be proved," she ex
plains.
Cole says that before going to the Jud
icial Affairs Office, students need to un
derstand why they are reporting sexual
assault and to determine what they want
in doing so.
She says that it would be unfair to
"have people coming here with expecta
tions that don't make sense."
Reasons to report
For the rape victim, however, reporting
may be one of the steps in the healing
process.
Both "Pamela" and "Nina" — whose
experiences were described earlier in this
series — did report their rape experi
ences. Despite their objections to the jud
icial process, they both stress the
importance of reporting rape and other
sexual assaults.
"Experience has shown that for sur
vivors, that can be the beginning of
healing," said Christine Griffith, director
of the Stanford Rape Response Group.
In addition, reporting "may have an im
pact on educating students on how we
treat each other."
O'Brien outlines several reasons for
reporting rape to the University. "If you

go through the judicial process, [the as
sailant] will understand that what they
did is wrong."
In addition, reporting and subsequent
punishment may prevent the assailant
from doing it again, O'Brien says.
"The only way to stop the crime is to
encourage reporting and to take action,"
Pamela says. "Otherwise ithe rapist 1 al
most gets rewarded by raping."
Reporting rape also makes it "more
conducive for other women to report,"
according to O'Brien.
Further, Mak says that it is important
for a rape victim to be able to report the
incident and see punitive action taken
against the assailant. "It's the Universi
ty's obligation to create avenues for
reporting. Even if there is only one person
who wants to report in the next 10 years,
she or he has got to have the option."
'It's not going to end'
The lives of these students who have
been sexually assaulted have been forever
changed by their experiences. Both
Pamela and Nina began working at rape
crisis centers and have become very in
volved in campus rape education.
"This was one little night of my life,
and it's not going to end," Nina says."It
has affected every aspect of my life. I
can't go running, it affected my summer
job, there are parties I can't go to."
Pamela says she has had to accept that
she, and not someone she knows or heard
about, has been raped. "I've had to in
tegrate being a rape victim into my iden
tity," she explains. "A lot of people say
(to me), 'OK, it's over.' But I go to bed
with it every night. Not a day goes by
that I don't think about it."
Michelle, Jeff and Brittany are still
working through their feelings of guilt.
Brittany says,"I am still sort of sifting
out my own baggage, and I feel like
(reporting) wouldn't have worked for
me."
Jeff says: "Like it or not, I know it's
a part of me. I can never leave it behind,
and I don't want to leave it behind. I
don't want to forget it."
Time has helped both Brittany and
Michelle accept the fact that they were
raped.
Michelle says:"I feel like I can talk
about it now. This is an amazing step.
Back in November and December I didn't
even want to think about it."
For Brittany, taking SWOPSI 173, Is
sues in Self-Defense for Women, has
helped her to realize what happened and
to deal with her emotions.
Although Nina's case is officially closed,
she filed a grievance against Cole in No
vember, including charges that Cole mis
handled her case and that her rights to
confidentiality had been violated. This
grievance is still being investigated by
two University officials.
"I've told my story so many times and
I feel that I've gotten a lot of empty
promises," Nina says. "I'm still waiting
for something to be done."

"Michelle," a freshman, went to a
party in November with a friend in her
dorm and his male friend.
She didn't know his friend, but when
they walked to the party they talked a
lot. Throughout the night they talked
and began to get to know each other.
"I thought he was a nice guy," Michelle
remembers.
They spent all day Sunday together
and then decided to go on a walk. At
Lake Lagunita, Michelle and the man
started to kiss.
"1 didn't think anything was bad
about that," Michelle recalls. "I felt that
was OK. I didn't feel I was putting
myself in jeopardy."
But then he went further. "It wasn't
violent or anything," she explains. "But
there was so much pressure that I
froze."
Michelle says she was afraid to do
anything. "I kept saying no, but 1
couldn't scream," she remembers. "If I
screamed he would have done something
even more angry than if I hadn't
screamed," she explains.
Then he raped her, she says.
"It was real quick, but that was the
way it happened," she says.
When they walked back, Michelle
didn't want to say anything. "1 think
he knew something was wrong, and he
knew what he did wasn't right," she
says. "But I just froze."
Michelle didn't tell anyone for three
weeks that she had been raped. "I didn't
want to make a big scandal, and I didn't
want him to get the satisfaction" of
making her feel bo ashamed.
"I felt it was my fault. I felt so guilty
that it didn't enter my mind to report
it," Michelle remembers. "I feel it was
my fault for not screaming even though
I said no."
It wasn't until Dead Week, three
weeks after the incident, that the friend
with whom she went to the party —
not the man who raped her — realized
something was wrong. When she told
him what had happened, he realized she
had been raped.
"He was really supportive. Now I'm
pretty much OK, but it was because of
my friend's help," she says.
Michelle says she wrote the alleged
assailant a letter explaining her view of
the incident. He wrote back, saying he

hadn't realized she felt raped. "It made
me feel good that he won't do it again,"
she says.
Michelle never reported the incident.
"I would have never thought of reporting
it," she says."I didn't want to cause a
public scandal that would hurt me."
"I still feel guilty about it. I wouldn't
want to call a hotline; it's so impersonal,"
she explains. "I felt guilty, like they
wouldn't believe me."
Michelle knew there was counseling
available through Cowell Student Health
Center but could not make herself call.
"There were places you could call, but
I was afraid to pick up the phone. You
feel like a number."

Like Michelle, many people decide not
to report acquaintance rape, and those
who work with the issue say a main
reason is that the University has no
formal protocol for reporting highly
sensitive cases like rape.
According to senior Suzanna Mak,
founder and administrative director of
Heightened Education on Acquaintance
Rape, "Stanford lags behind the nation
in (not) having a protocol . . . and that
bothers me."
When researching for the University
Task Force on Sexual Assault, junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the task
force, realized "there was nowhere in
writing that tells one where to report
(a sexual assault)."
For a victim of sexual assault, this
absence of a policy could discourage
reporting. If victims "don't see it
anywhere and . . . don't know what to
do," they will be less likely to report
the incident, O'Brien says.
Because of the nature of rape, in which
a victim feels "guilt, shame and fear,"
and because of a strong cultural attitude
that women bring rape on themselves,

"not knowing what to do or to whom to
report the rape is a serious problem,"
she adds.
Currently, the task force is developing
a written protocol. An interim report has
been released, listing reasons and options
for reporting rape. The full report, with
more complete recommendations for
changing University policy on sexual as
sault, is set for publication in November.
But for some people, not reporting a
rape has less to do with the absence of
a protocol and more to do with their own
doubt that the experience was a rape.

both defines and condemns harassing be
havior and warns possible violators of
the consequences. It also encourages stu
dents who believe they have been
harassed to report complaints to the Uni
versity, either through formal or informal
channels.
According to Kaplan, the policy com
bating sexual harassment is a par
ticularization of the Fundamental
Standard.
Lyons says a clear definition would be
"terrific," but he hopes it would not be
come a rule. A statement condemning
rape would be helpful but won't prevent
rapes from occurring, he says. "State
ments don't alter behavior, but they cause
people to stop and think about their be
havior," Lyons says.
Cole adds that when prosecuting sexual
assault cases, she looks for evidence —
not definitions. "The definition isn't at
issue. Frequently it's the evidence that's
at issue. If someone describes behavior
that to me sounds like rape, I don't need
to look up the definition, I look to see if
the allegation can be proved," she ex
plains.
Cole says that before going to the Jud
icial Affairs Office, students need to un
derstand why they are reporting sexual
assault and to determine what they want
in doing so.
She says that it would be unfair to
"have people coming here with expecta
tions that don't make sense."
Reasons to report
For the rape victim, however, reporting
may be one of the steps in the healing
process.
Both "Pamela" and "Nina" — whose
experiences were described earlier in this
series — did report their rape experi
ences. Despite their objections to the jud
icial process, they both stress the
importance of reporting rape and other
sexual assaults.
"Experience has shown that for sur
vivors, that can be the beginning of
healing," said Christine Griffith, director
of the Stanford Rape Response Group.
In addition, reporting "may have an im
pact on educating students on how we
treat each other."
O'Brien outlines several reasons for
reporting rape to the University. "If you

go through the judicial process, [the as
sailant] will understand that what they
did is wrong."
In addition, reporting and subsequent
punishment may prevent the assailant
from doing it again, O'Brien says.
"The only way to stop the crime is to
encourage reporting and to take action,"
Pamela says. "Otherwise ithe rapist 1 al
most gets rewarded by raping."
Reporting rape also makes it "more
conducive for other women to report,"
according to O'Brien.
Further, Mak says that it is important
for a rape victim to be able to report the
incident and see punitive action taken
against the assailant. "It's the Universi
ty's obligation to create avenues for
reporting. Even if there is only one person
who wants to report in the next 10 years,
she or he has got to have the option."
'It's not going to end'
The lives of these students who have
been sexually assaulted have been forever
changed by their experiences. Both
Pamela and Nina began working at rape
crisis centers and have become very in
volved in campus rape education.
"This was one little night of my life,
and it's not going to end," Nina says."It
has affected every aspect of my life. I
can't go running, it affected my summer
job, there are parties I can't go to."
Pamela says she has had to accept that
she, and not someone she knows or heard
about, has been raped. "I've had to in
tegrate being a rape victim into my iden
tity," she explains. "A lot of people say
(to me), 'OK, it's over.' But I go to bed
with it every night. Not a day goes by
that I don't think about it."
Michelle, Jeff and Brittany are still
working through their feelings of guilt.
Brittany says,"I am still sort of sifting
out my own baggage, and I feel like
(reporting) wouldn't have worked for
me."
Jeff says: "Like it or not, I know it's
a part of me. I can never leave it behind,
and I don't want to leave it behind. I
don't want to forget it."
Time has helped both Brittany and
Michelle accept the fact that they were
raped.
Michelle says:"I feel like I can talk
about it now. This is an amazing step.
Back in November and December I didn't
even want to think about it."
For Brittany, taking SWOPSI 173, Is
sues in Self-Defense for Women, has
helped her to realize what happened and
to deal with her emotions.
Although Nina's case is officially closed,
she filed a grievance against Cole in No
vember, including charges that Cole mis
handled her case and that her rights to
confidentiality had been violated. This
grievance is still being investigated by
two University officials.
"I've told my story so many times and
I feel that I've gotten a lot of empty
promises," Nina says. "I'm still waiting
for something to be done."

"Michelle," a freshman, went to a
party in November with a friend in her
dorm and his male friend.
She didn't know his friend, but when
they walked to the party they talked a
lot. Throughout the night they talked
and began to get to know each other.
"I thought he was a nice guy," Michelle
remembers.
They spent all day Sunday together
and then decided to go on a walk. At
Lake Lagunita, Michelle and the man
started to kiss.
"1 didn't think anything was bad
about that," Michelle recalls. "I felt that
was OK. I didn't feel I was putting
myself in jeopardy."
But then he went further. "It wasn't
violent or anything," she explains. "But
there was so much pressure that I
froze."
Michelle says she was afraid to do
anything. "I kept saying no, but 1
couldn't scream," she remembers. "If I
screamed he would have done something
even more angry than if I hadn't
screamed," she explains.
Then he raped her, she says.
"It was real quick, but that was the
way it happened," she says.
When they walked back, Michelle
didn't want to say anything. "1 think
he knew something was wrong, and he
knew what he did wasn't right," she
says. "But I just froze."
Michelle didn't tell anyone for three
weeks that she had been raped. "I didn't
want to make a big scandal, and I didn't
want him to get the satisfaction" of
making her feel bo ashamed.
"I felt it was my fault. I felt so guilty
that it didn't enter my mind to report
it," Michelle remembers. "I feel it was
my fault for not screaming even though
I said no."
It wasn't until Dead Week, three
weeks after the incident, that the friend
with whom she went to the party —
not the man who raped her — realized
something was wrong. When she told
him what had happened, he realized she
had been raped.
"He was really supportive. Now I'm
pretty much OK, but it was because of
my friend's help," she says.
Michelle says she wrote the alleged
assailant a letter explaining her view of
the incident. He wrote back, saying he

hadn't realized she felt raped. "It made
me feel good that he won't do it again,"
she says.
Michelle never reported the incident.
"I would have never thought of reporting
it," she says."I didn't want to cause a
public scandal that would hurt me."
"I still feel guilty about it. I wouldn't
want to call a hotline; it's so impersonal,"
she explains. "I felt guilty, like they
wouldn't believe me."
Michelle knew there was counseling
available through Cowell Student Health
Center but could not make herself call.
"There were places you could call, but
I was afraid to pick up the phone. You
feel like a number."

Like Michelle, many people decide not
to report acquaintance rape, and those
who work with the issue say a main
reason is that the University has no
formal protocol for reporting highly
sensitive cases like rape.
According to senior Suzanna Mak,
founder and administrative director of
Heightened Education on Acquaintance
Rape, "Stanford lags behind the nation
in (not) having a protocol . . . and that
bothers me."
When researching for the University
Task Force on Sexual Assault, junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the task
force, realized "there was nowhere in
writing that tells one where to report
(a sexual assault)."
For a victim of sexual assault, this
absence of a policy could discourage
reporting. If victims "don't see it
anywhere and . . . don't know what to
do," they will be less likely to report
the incident, O'Brien says.
Because of the nature of rape, in which
a victim feels "guilt, shame and fear,"
and because of a strong cultural attitude
that women bring rape on themselves,

"not knowing what to do or to whom to
report the rape is a serious problem,"
she adds.
Currently, the task force is developing
a written protocol. An interim report has
been released, listing reasons and options
for reporting rape. The full report, with
more complete recommendations for
changing University policy on sexual as
sault, is set for publication in November.
But for some people, not reporting a
rape has less to do with the absence of
a protocol and more to do with their own
doubt that the experience was a rape.

During her sophomore year, "Brittany"
was involved with a male student. While
they had been intimate before, they had
never had sexual intercourse.
One evening they were sitting together
on a bed, kissing.
Brittany, now a senior, says she told
him she didn't want to "fool around"
that night.
He then tried to pull down her under
pants. "It started becoming a tug-of-war
with my underpants," Brittany says. The
male student started to coerce her into
having sexual intercourse, and she said
she did not want to.
"Then, all of a sudden when he realized
I wasn't going to have sex, he let go of
my underpants and rolled over, and his
tone changed."
The male kept trying to talk her into
having sex, and his words turned "nasty,"
Brittany says."It just kept going on and
on," Brittany says. He got frustrated and
said he didn't know why he was attracted
to her at all, she explains.
Finally, she says he told her, "You know
what your problem is?"
Brittany says, at that point she should
have said, " 'Yeah, I'm in bed with you'
and gotten up and left."
But she didn't. Instead, she asked him,
"What?"
He said, "You're just way too serious.
You don't know how to have a good time."
Something triggered inside Brittany.
She had a flashback to another painful
experience and felt she had to prove him
and herself wrong by showing him she
could "have a good time."
He wouldn't talk to her.
"I felt extremely lonely and extremely
rejected," she recalls. "I was so confused."
She says,"The only way I felt I could
make things better was to have sex. I
just didn't feel like I had any options."
Brittany says she finally said she would
have sex with him. While he was on top
of her, she lay on the bed crying and
undemonstrative, she says."I have never
in my life had painful sex except for
then."
"There was a part of me that was
sitting up on the shelf condemning what
was going on and hating myself and
hating him. And then there was the part
of me that was present in the bed and
that was crying. Those two parts were
cut off from one another," she explains.
"I just wanted it to be over," she says.
Because she had consented to have sex,
she felt like she had given up her right
to say no. In her mind, it couldn't be
rape because she had agreed, she ex
plains.
Now she says she realizes, "I was emo
tionally and verbally coerced into having
sex. That's not consenting."
Though the male student refused to
talk with Brittany the next day, they
eventually talked about that night. "I
basically just started screaming at him
and telling him how incredibly painful it
was for me and saying how I couldn't
understand that if he said he cared about
me how this could happen.
"I told him that he had coerced me
into having sex," she explains.
"What was so strange was that he was
shocked. He was completely unaware that
this was what I was experiencing," she
says.
"And to me that was one of the most
terrifying parts, was that this could be
going on, and I could be lying there crying
on the bed, and he could be so completely
in his own world that he didn't even
notice it."
After their conversation, Brittany says,
the male student told her he was very
sorry.
Brittany decided not to report the in
cident to the University. "I didn't think

of pressing charges. I was trying to sort
out my own feelings of responsibility and
guilt for what happened," she says. Like
Michelle, Brittany still feels guilt and
shame about what happened. "There is
a part of me that negates what happened
and how I feel about it."
Defining the incident as rape, Brittany
says, is extremely painful. "It's almost
scarier to say that it's rape than not to
admit it, because it's really terrifying."
And there is still a part of her that
feels it was as much her fault as it was
his, she says.

Sexual assault does not happen only
to women. In last spring's Rape Educa
tion Project survey, 16 percent of male
graduate students and 10 percent of male
undergraduates indicated that they had
been coerced into sexual activity against
their will.
Three years ago, when "Jeff' was a
junior, he gradually got to know a male
teaching assistant in one of his classes.
They became friends, and Jeff respected
and trusted the graduate student.
One evening the TA, who was in his
mid-thirties, invited Jeff to his apart
ment. After an hour of talking, the TA
offered Jeff a back rub to help him relax.
Jeff agreed, not thinking twice about it.
Then the TA asked him to take off his
clothes, and he did.
The TA began massaging him, but then
he moved down to Jeffs genitals. The
TA, who was fully clothed, began to mas
turbate Jeff.
"At the time I was sort of trying to
distance myself from the situation. I was
trying to make myself think of something
else and pretend that I wasn't there. At
some point it just snapped and I said,
'Get a hold of yourself, you don't like it,
and you shouldn't like it. Leave.' "
He told the TA to stop. As he was
putting his clothes on, the TA tried to
convince him not to leave. "He kept say
ing that he didn't want me to spend the
night alone," Jeff recalls.
Jeff tried to deny what happened to
him. "I put so much trust in him that
I was trying to convince myself that he
wouldn't really do this."
Jeff didn't tell anyone about his expe
rience for two years. "I didn't identify it
as a sexual assault. I mean, I didn't know
what to call it."
Largely because most literature and
fliers that he saw about sexual assault
discussed issues about men raping wom
en, Jeff says he never made the connec
tion that he — as a man — was sexually
assaulted.
The TA called Jeff several times and
Jeff saw him in class, but Jeff never
talked with him about the experience. "I
was really scared of him, and I just didn't
know what to do about it."
Jeff thought constantly about the as
sault and had nightmares of being pinned
up against a wall by the TA. In the
dreams, Jeff always felt the incident was
his own fault. His grades suffered because
he couldn't concentrate on his work, and
he dropped many of his classes.
After stopping out for a year — which
he had planned to do before the incident

— he came back to campus, still not
identifying the incident as sexual assault.
"I made a very concerted effort to forget
it."
Finally, Jeff told a male friend of his
who was a member of the Rape Education
Project.
He explains that what really bothered
him about the experience "was not that
he was a man, but rather it was the
sense of powerlessness, that I lost control
of what was going on and that he was
using me."
In recent months, Jeff has met with
two women — featured earlier in this
series — who survived rape and helped
him label his experience as sexual assault.
"By having a word for it, it gave me a
lot more justification to understand what
it had put me through."
Jeff says:"I don't call what happened
to me rape. It was a sexual assault. We
didn't have intercourse. We very well
might have, but I stopped it before then."
Jeff has since begun meeting regularly
with a psychiatrist at Counseling and
Psychological Services.

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole spec
ulates that because victims like Michelle,
Brittany and Jeff have difficulty defining
their experiences as sexual assault, they
do not want to press official charges.
"Not understanding what it means
clears a path to alternatives to formal
reporting," Cole says. "If you can't clas
sify the experience as a crime, you may
be less likely to report it" to authorities.
Brittany says: "Defining it is the most
ambiguous. To me, it is not clear when
it is coercion and when it is date rape
— and when coercion and date rape are
the same thing."
Jeff says,"I think there is a misiden
tification of rape as an expression of
sexuality. It's violence; it's power."
Mak says that because there is no for
mal definition of what constitutes rape,
"people don't know what can be pun
ished. There is so much ambiguity and
so much contradiction there that it
prevents people from reporting."
According to University Ombudsperson
Leah Kaplan, creating a clear under
standing of what rape is helps both the
victim and the assailant. "There's some
thing in labeling it and demystifying it,"
she says, "that helps people understand
when they have done something wrong."
Due to the lack of awareness, the Uni
versity needs to publicize a formal defi
nition and condemnation of rape,
according to Mak and O'Brien.
"I'm not lumping everything on Jud
icial Affairs," Mak says."The University
is wholly responsible, and they make zero
— no acknowledgment — that the crime
occurs. They won't define what it is, they
won't say whether they are for or against
it, they won't take a stand," Mak says.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
says: "You don't take advantage of some
one or create a situation where someone
is not consciously able to make a decision.
That seems to me clearly wrong." But
in most cases, the social norm is not
clear, he adds.
For Brittany, a definition "was really

empowering. I was claiming back my
right to say no and that it's not OK for
me to be coerced," she says.
Having a University definition of
sexual assault would have been "crucial"
for Jeff in coming to terms with his
experience, he says.
Kaplan, who handled 12 student griev
ances of sexual harassment against stu
dents, staff and faculty last year, points
out that the University has an official
"Policy on Combating Sexual Harass
ment." A similar policy about sexual as
sault could be written, she says.
The policy against sexual harassment,
which was developed in the late 19705,
both defines and condemns harassing be
havior and warns possible violators of
the consequences. It also encourages stu
dents who believe they have been
harassed to report complaints to the Uni
versity, either through formal or informal
channels.
According to Kaplan, the policy com
bating sexual harassment is a par
ticularization of the Fundamental
Standard.
Lyons says a clear definition would be
"terrific," but he hopes it would not be
come a rule. A statement condemning
rape would be helpful but won't prevent
rapes from occurring, he says. "State
ments don't alter behavior, but they cause
people to stop and think about their be
havior," Lyons says.
Cole adds that when prosecuting sexual
assault cases, she looks for evidence —
not definitions. "The definition isn't at
issue. Frequently it's the evidence that's
at issue. If someone describes behavior
that to me sounds like rape, I don't need
to look up the definition, I look to see if
the allegation can be proved," she ex
plains.
Cole says that before going to the Jud
icial Affairs Office, students need to un
derstand why they are reporting sexual
assault and to determine what they want
in doing so.
She says that it would be unfair to
"have people coming here with expecta
tions that don't make sense."
Reasons to report
For the rape victim, however, reporting
may be one of the steps in the healing
process.
Both "Pamela" and "Nina" — whose
experiences were described earlier in this
series — did report their rape experi
ences. Despite their objections to the jud
icial process, they both stress the
importance of reporting rape and other
sexual assaults.
"Experience has shown that for sur
vivors, that can be the beginning of
healing," said Christine Griffith, director
of the Stanford Rape Response Group.
In addition, reporting "may have an im
pact on educating students on how we

O'Brien outlines several reasons for
reporting rape to the University. "If you

go through the judicial process, [the as
sailant] will understand that what they
did is wrong."
In addition, reporting and subsequent
punishment may prevent the assailant
from doing it again, O'Brien says.
"The only way to stop the crime is to
encourage reporting and to take action,"
Pamela says. "Otherwise ithe rapist 1 al
most gets rewarded by raping."
Reporting rape also makes it "more
conducive for other women to report,"
according to O'Brien.

been sexually assaulted have been forever

Pamela and Nina began working at rape

"This was one little night of my life,
and it's not going to end," Nina says."It

Pamela says she has had to accept that
she, and not someone she knows or heard
about, has been raped. "I've had to in
tegrate being a rape victim into my iden
tity," she explains. "A lot of people say
(to me), 'OK, it's over.' But I go to bed
with it every night. Not a day goes by
that I don't think about it."
Michelle, Jeff and Brittany are still
working through their feelings of guilt.
Brittany says,"I am still sort of sifting
out my own baggage, and I feel like

Jeff says: "Like it or not, I know it's

was going on and hating myself and
hating him. And then there was the part
of me that was present in the bed and
that was crying. Those two parts were
cut off from one another," she explains.
"I just wanted it to be over," she says.
Because she had consented to have sex,
she felt like she had given up her right
to say no. In her mind, it couldn't be
rape because she had agreed, she ex
plains.
Now she says she realizes, "I was emo
tionally and verbally coerced into having
sex. That's not consenting."
Though the male student refused to
talk with Brittany the next day, they
eventually talked about that night. "I
basically just started screaming at him
and telling him how incredibly painful it
was for me and saying how I couldn't
understand that if he said he cared about
me how this could happen.
"I told him that he had coerced me
into having sex," she explains.
"What was so strange was that he was
shocked. He was completely unaware that
this was what I was experiencing," she
says.
"And to me that was one of the most
terrifying parts, was that this could be
going on, and I could be lying there crying
on the bed, and he could be so completely
in his own world that he didn't even
notice it."
After their conversation, Brittany says,
the male student told her he was very
sorry.
Brittany decided not to report the in
cident to the University. "I didn't think

of pressing charges. I was trying to sort
out my own feelings of responsibility and
guilt for what happened," she says. Like
Michelle, Brittany still feels guilt and
shame about what happened. "There is
a part of me that negates what happened
and how I feel about it."
Defining the incident as rape, Brittany
says, is extremely painful. "It's almost
scarier to say that it's rape than not to
admit it, because it's really terrifying."
And there is still a part of her that
feels it was as much her fault as it was
his, she says.

Sexual assault does not happen only
to women. In last spring's Rape Educa
tion Project survey, 16 percent of male
graduate students and 10 percent of male
undergraduates indicated that they had
been coerced into sexual activity against
their will.
Three years ago, when "Jeff' was a
junior, he gradually got to know a male
teaching assistant in one of his classes.
They became friends, and Jeff respected
and trusted the graduate student.
One evening the TA, who was in his
mid-thirties, invited Jeff to his apart
ment. After an hour of talking, the TA
offered Jeff a back rub to help him relax.
Jeff agreed, not thinking twice about it.
Then the TA asked him to take off his
clothes, and he did.
The TA began massaging him, but then
he moved down to Jeffs genitals. The
TA, who was fully clothed, began to mas
turbate Jeff.
"At the time I was sort of trying to
distance myself from the situation. I was
trying to make myself think of something
else and pretend that I wasn't there. At
some point it just snapped and I said,
'Get a hold of yourself, you don't like it,
and you shouldn't like it. Leave.' "
He told the TA to stop. As he was
putting his clothes on, the TA tried to
convince him not to leave. "He kept say
ing that he didn't want me to spend the
night alone," Jeff recalls.
Jeff tried to deny what happened to
him. "I put so much trust in him that
I was trying to convince myself that he
wouldn't really do this."
Jeff didn't tell anyone about his expe
rience for two years. "I didn't identify it
as a sexual assault. I mean, I didn't know
what to call it."
Largely because most literature and
fliers that he saw about sexual assault
discussed issues about men raping wom
en, Jeff says he never made the connec
tion that he — as a man — was sexually
assaulted.
The TA called Jeff several times and
Jeff saw him in class, but Jeff never
talked with him about the experience. "I
was really scared of him, and I just didn't
know what to do about it."
Jeff thought constantly about the as
sault and had nightmares of being pinned
up against a wall by the TA. In the
dreams, Jeff always felt the incident was
his own fault. His grades suffered because
he couldn't concentrate on his work, and
he dropped many of his classes.
After stopping out for a year — which
he had planned to do before the incident

— he came back to campus, still not
identifying the incident as sexual assault.
"I made a very concerted effort to forget
it."
Finally, Jeff told a male friend of his
who was a member of the Rape Education
Project.
He explains that what really bothered
him about the experience "was not that
he was a man, but rather it was the
sense of powerlessness, that I lost control
of what was going on and that he was
using me."
In recent months, Jeff has met with
two women — featured earlier in this
series — who survived rape and helped
him label his experience as sexual assault.
"By having a word for it, it gave me a
lot more justification to understand what
it had put me through."
Jeff says:"I don't call what happened
to me rape. It was a sexual assault. We
didn't have intercourse. We very well
might have, but I stopped it before then."
Jeff has since begun meeting regularly
with a psychiatrist at Counseling and
Psychological Services.

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole spec
ulates that because victims like Michelle,
Brittany and Jeff have difficulty defining
their experiences as sexual assault, they
do not want to press official charges.
"Not understanding what it means
clears a path to alternatives to formal
reporting," Cole says. "If you can't clas
sify the experience as a crime, you may
be less likely to report it" to authorities.
Brittany says: "Defining it is the most
ambiguous. To me, it is not clear when
it is coercion and when it is date rape
— and when coercion and date rape are
the same thing."
Jeff says,"I think there is a misiden
tification of rape as an expression of
sexuality. It's violence; it's power."
Mak says that because there is no for
mal definition of what constitutes rape,
"people don't know what can be pun
ished. There is so much ambiguity and
so much contradiction there that it
prevents people from reporting."
According to University Ombudsperson
Leah Kaplan, creating a clear under
standing of what rape is helps both the
victim and the assailant. "There's some
thing in labeling it and demystifying it,"
she says, "that helps people understand
when they have done something wrong."
Due to the lack of awareness, the Uni
versity needs to publicize a formal defi
nition and condemnation of rape,
according to Mak and O'Brien.
"I'm not lumping everything on Jud
icial Affairs," Mak says."The University
is wholly responsible, and they make zero
— no acknowledgment — that the crime
occurs. They won't define what it is, they
won't say whether they are for or against
it, they won't take a stand," Mak says.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
says: "You don't take advantage of some
one or create a situation where someone
is not consciously able to make a decision.
That seems to me clearly wrong." But
in most cases, the social norm is not
clear, he adds.
For Brittany, a definition "was really

empowering. I was claiming back my
right to say no and that it's not OK for
me to be coerced," she says.
Having a University definition of
sexual assault would have been "crucial"
for Jeff in coming to terms with his
experience, he says.
Kaplan, who handled 12 student griev
ances of sexual harassment against stu
dents, staff and faculty last year, points
out that the University has an official
"Policy on Combating Sexual Harass
ment." A similar policy about sexual as
sault could be written, she says.
The policy against sexual harassment,
which was developed in the late 19705,
both defines and condemns harassing be
havior and warns possible violators of
the consequences. It also encourages stu
dents who believe they have been
harassed to report complaints to the Uni
versity, either through formal or informal
channels.
According to Kaplan, the policy com
bating sexual harassment is a par
ticularization of the Fundamental
Standard.
Lyons says a clear definition would be
"terrific," but he hopes it would not be
come a rule. A statement condemning
rape would be helpful but won't prevent
rapes from occurring, he says. "State
ments don't alter behavior, but they cause
people to stop and think about their be
havior," Lyons says.
Cole adds that when prosecuting sexual
assault cases, she looks for evidence —
not definitions. "The definition isn't at
issue. Frequently it's the evidence that's
at issue. If someone describes behavior
that to me sounds like rape, I don't need
to look up the definition, I look to see if
the allegation can be proved," she ex
plains.
Cole says that before going to the Jud
icial Affairs Office, students need to un
derstand why they are reporting sexual
assault and to determine what they want
in doing so.
She says that it would be unfair to
"have people coming here with expecta
tions that don't make sense."
Reasons to report
For the rape victim, however, reporting
may be one of the steps in the healing
process.
Both "Pamela" and "Nina" — whose
experiences were described earlier in this
series — did report their rape experi
ences. Despite their objections to the jud
icial process, they both stress the
importance of reporting rape and other
sexual assaults.
"Experience has shown that for sur
vivors, that can be the beginning of
healing," said Christine Griffith, director
of the Stanford Rape Response Group.
In addition, reporting "may have an im
pact on educating students on how we
treat each other."
O'Brien outlines several reasons for
reporting rape to the University. "If you

go through the judicial process, [the as
sailant] will understand that what they
did is wrong."
In addition, reporting and subsequent
punishment may prevent the assailant
from doing it again, O'Brien says.
"The only way to stop the crime is to
encourage reporting and to take action,"
Pamela says. "Otherwise ithe rapist 1 al
most gets rewarded by raping."
Reporting rape also makes it "more
conducive for other women to report,"
according to O'Brien.
Further, Mak says that it is important
for a rape victim to be able to report the
incident and see punitive action taken
against the assailant. "It's the Universi
ty's obligation to create avenues for
reporting. Even if there is only one person
who wants to report in the next 10 years,
she or he has got to have the option."
'It's not going to end'
The lives of these students who have
been sexually assaulted have been forever
changed by their experiences. Both
Pamela and Nina began working at rape
crisis centers and have become very in
volved in campus rape education.
"This was one little night of my life,
and it's not going to end," Nina says."It
has affected every aspect of my life. I
can't go running, it affected my summer
job, there are parties I can't go to."
Pamela says she has had to accept that
she, and not someone she knows or heard
about, has been raped. "I've had to in
tegrate being a rape victim into my iden
tity," she explains. "A lot of people say
(to me), 'OK, it's over.' But I go to bed
with it every night. Not a day goes by
that I don't think about it."
Michelle, Jeff and Brittany are still
working through their feelings of guilt.
Brittany says,"I am still sort of sifting
out my own baggage, and I feel like
(reporting) wouldn't have worked for
me."
Jeff says: "Like it or not, I know it's
a part of me. I can never leave it behind,
and I don't want to leave it behind. I
don't want to forget it."
Time has helped both Brittany and
Michelle accept the fact that they were
raped.
Michelle says:"I feel like I can talk
about it now. This is an amazing step.
Back in November and December I didn't
even want to think about it."
For Brittany, taking SWOPSI 173, Is
sues in Self-Defense for Women, has
helped her to realize what happened and
to deal with her emotions.
Although Nina's case is officially closed,
she filed a grievance against Cole in No
vember, including charges that Cole mis
handled her case and that her rights to
confidentiality had been violated. This
grievance is still being investigated by
two University officials.
"I've told my story so many times and
I feel that I've gotten a lot of empty
promises," Nina says. "I'm still waiting
for something to be done."

"Michelle," a freshman, went to a
party in November with a friend in her
dorm and his male friend.
She didn't know his friend, but when
they walked to the party they talked a
lot. Throughout the night they talked
and began to get to know each other.
"I thought he was a nice guy," Michelle
remembers.
They spent all day Sunday together
and then decided to go on a walk. At
Lake Lagunita, Michelle and the man
started to kiss.
"1 didn't think anything was bad
about that," Michelle recalls. "I felt that
was OK. I didn't feel I was putting
myself in jeopardy."
But then he went further. "It wasn't
violent or anything," she explains. "But
there was so much pressure that I
froze."
Michelle says she was afraid to do
anything. "I kept saying no, but 1
couldn't scream," she remembers. "If I
screamed he would have done something
even more angry than if I hadn't
screamed," she explains.
Then he raped her, she says.
"It was real quick, but that was the
way it happened," she says.
When they walked back, Michelle
didn't want to say anything. "1 think
he knew something was wrong, and he
knew what he did wasn't right," she
says. "But I just froze."
Michelle didn't tell anyone for three
weeks that she had been raped. "I didn't
want to make a big scandal, and I didn't
want him to get the satisfaction" of
making her feel bo ashamed.
"I felt it was my fault. I felt so guilty
that it didn't enter my mind to report
it," Michelle remembers. "I feel it was
my fault for not screaming even though
I said no."
It wasn't until Dead Week, three
weeks after the incident, that the friend
with whom she went to the party —
not the man who raped her — realized
something was wrong. When she told
him what had happened, he realized she
had been raped.
"He was really supportive. Now I'm
pretty much OK, but it was because of
my friend's help," she says.
Michelle says she wrote the alleged
assailant a letter explaining her view of
the incident. He wrote back, saying he

hadn't realized she felt raped. "It made
me feel good that he won't do it again,"
she says.
Michelle never reported the incident.
"I would have never thought of reporting
it," she says."I didn't want to cause a
public scandal that would hurt me."
"I still feel guilty about it. I wouldn't
want to call a hotline; it's so impersonal,"
she explains. "I felt guilty, like they
wouldn't believe me."
Michelle knew there was counseling
available through Cowell Student Health
Center but could not make herself call.
"There were places you could call, but
I was afraid to pick up the phone. You
feel like a number."

Like Michelle, many people decide not
to report acquaintance rape, and those
who work with the issue say a main
reason is that the University has no
formal protocol for reporting highly
sensitive cases like rape.
According to senior Suzanna Mak,
founder and administrative director of
Heightened Education on Acquaintance
Rape, "Stanford lags behind the nation
in (not) having a protocol . . . and that
bothers me."
When researching for the University
Task Force on Sexual Assault, junior
Suzanne O'Brien, a member of the task
force, realized "there was nowhere in
writing that tells one where to report
(a sexual assault)."
For a victim of sexual assault, this
absence of a policy could discourage
reporting. If victims "don't see it
anywhere and . . . don't know what to
do," they will be less likely to report
the incident, O'Brien says.
Because of the nature of rape, in which
a victim feels "guilt, shame and fear,"
and because of a strong cultural attitude
that women bring rape on themselves,

"not knowing what to do or to whom to
report the rape is a serious problem,"
she adds.
Currently, the task force is developing
a written protocol. An interim report has
been released, listing reasons and options
for reporting rape. The full report, with
more complete recommendations for
changing University policy on sexual as
sault, is set for publication in November.
But for some people, not reporting a
rape has less to do with the absence of
a protocol and more to do with their own
doubt that the experience was a rape.

During her sophomore year, "Brittany"
was involved with a male student. While
they had been intimate before, they had
never had sexual intercourse.
One evening they were sitting together
on a bed, kissing.
Brittany, now a senior, says she told
him she didn't want to "fool around"
that night.
He then tried to pull down her under
pants. "It started becoming a tug-of-war
with my underpants," Brittany says. The
male student started to coerce her into
having sexual intercourse, and she said
she did not want to.
"Then, all of a sudden when he realized
I wasn't going to have sex, he let go of
my underpants and rolled over, and his
tone changed."
The male kept trying to talk her into
having sex, and his words turned "nasty,"
Brittany says."It just kept going on and
on," Brittany says. He got frustrated and
said he didn't know why he was attracted
to her at all, she explains.
Finally, she says he told her, "You know
what your problem is?"
Brittany says, at that point she should
have said, " 'Yeah, I'm in bed with you'
and gotten up and left."
But she didn't. Instead, she asked him,
"What?"
He said, "You're just way too serious.
You don't know how to have a good time."
Something triggered inside Brittany.
She had a flashback to another painful
experience and felt she had to prove him
and herself wrong by showing him she
could "have a good time."
He wouldn't talk to her.
"I felt extremely lonely and extremely
rejected," she recalls. "I was so confused."
She says,"The only way I felt I could
make things better was to have sex. I
just didn't feel like I had any options."
Brittany says she finally said she would
have sex with him. While he was on top
of her, she lay on the bed crying and
undemonstrative, she says."I have never
in my life had painful sex except for
then."
"There was a part of me that was
sitting up on the shelf condemning what
was going on and hating myself and
hating him. And then there was the part
of me that was present in the bed and
that was crying. Those two parts were
cut off from one another," she explains.
"I just wanted it to be over," she says.
Because she had consented to have sex,
she felt like she had given up her right
to say no. In her mind, it couldn't be
rape because she had agreed, she ex
plains.
Now she says she realizes, "I was emo
tionally and verbally coerced into having
sex. That's not consenting."
Though the male student refused to
talk with Brittany the next day, they
eventually talked about that night. "I
basically just started screaming at him
and telling him how incredibly painful it
was for me and saying how I couldn't
understand that if he said he cared about
me how this could happen.
"I told him that he had coerced me
into having sex," she explains.
"What was so strange was that he was
shocked. He was completely unaware that
this was what I was experiencing," she
says.
"And to me that was one of the most
terrifying parts, was that this could be
going on, and I could be lying there crying
on the bed, and he could be so completely
in his own world that he didn't even
notice it."
After their conversation, Brittany says,
the male student told her he was very
sorry.
Brittany decided not to report the in
cident to the University. "I didn't think

of pressing charges. I was trying to sort
out my own feelings of responsibility and
guilt for what happened," she says. Like
Michelle, Brittany still feels guilt and
shame about what happened. "There is
a part of me that negates what happened
and how I feel about it."
Defining the incident as rape, Brittany
says, is extremely painful. "It's almost
scarier to say that it's rape than not to
admit it, because it's really terrifying."
And there is still a part of her that
feels it was as much her fault as it was
his, she says.

she, and not someone she knows or heard
about, has been raped. "I've had to in
tegrate being a rape victim into my iden
tity," she explains. "A lot of people say
(to me), 'OK, it's over.' But I go to bed
with it every night. Not a day goes by
that I don't think about it."
Michelle, Jeff and Brittany are still
working through their feelings of guilt.
Brittany says,"I am still sort of sifting
out my own baggage, and I feel like
(reporting) wouldn't have worked for
me."
Jeff says: "Like it or not, I know it's
a part of me. I can never leave it behind,
and I don't want to leave it behind. I
don't want to forget it."
Time has helped both Brittany and
Michelle accept the fact that they were
raped.
Michelle says:"I feel like I can talk
about it now. This is an amazing step.
Back in November and December I didn't
even want to think about it."
For Brittany, taking SWOPSI 173, Is
sues in Self-Defense for Women, has
helped her to realize what happened and
to deal with her emotions.
Although Nina's case is officially closed,
she filed a grievance against Cole in No
vember, including charges that Cole mis
handled her case and that her rights to
confidentiality had been violated. This
grievance is still being investigated by
two University officials.
"I've told my story so many times and
I feel that I've gotten a lot of empty
promises," Nina says. "I'm still waiting
for something to be done."
