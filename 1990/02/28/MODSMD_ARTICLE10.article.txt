# Soviets to elect a president
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — A determined and
at times angry Mikhail Gorbachev yes
terday rammed through the Supreme
Soviet's final and overwhelming ap
proval of his proposal as a "a great
political event." But lawmaker Leonid
Sukhov, a Ukrainian taxi driver,
warned: "The way the voting went
today is the same way presidential
power will be."
After only two days of discussion,
spread over two weeks, the Supreme
Soviet voted 347-24 with 43 absten
tions to approve creation in principle
of a national presidency with a five
year term, to replace the government
post now held by Gorbachev, whose
formal title is Supreme Soviet chair
man.
Subject to final approval by the
legislature's parent body, the Congress
of People's Deputies, the president will
be granted powers to veto laws, uni
laterally declare states of emergency,
and name the prime minister, accord
ing to a copy of the bill shown to
Western reporters.
Gorbachev, who chaired the legisla
ture's proceedings, emphasized he has
not yet been elected president and said
he has even considered refusing the
office, but few expect the 58-year-old
Communist Party chief not to be cho
sen.
Progressive lawmakers strongly ob
jected to concentrating so much power
in one leader's hands and what they
called Gorbachev's undue haste in
pressing the issue.
The bill shown to reporters em
powers the president:
• To unilaterally declare a state of
emergency anywhere in the country,
and to declare war if the Soviet Union
is invaded.
• To appoint the prime minister,
subject to confirmation by he Supreme
Soviet.
• To be commander-in-chief of the
armed forces.
• To veto legislation. If the Supreme
Soviet overrides the veto by a majority
vote, the president can appeal to the
Congress or go over the heads of the
lawmakers by scheduling a natfOtWMe
referendum.
