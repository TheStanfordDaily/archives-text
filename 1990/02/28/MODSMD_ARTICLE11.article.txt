MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) —
President Daniel Ortega demanded the
immediate disbanding of U.S.-backed
Contra rebels and set tough conditions
yesterday for a peaceful transfer of
power to the coalition that won the
elections.
"A change of government does not
mean the end of the revolution," he
told thousands of cheering supporters
after a meeting of Sandinista party
leaders.
Ortega said the party would relin
quish power because of the election
loss Sunday, but would defend the
gains of the revolution.
"The Sandinista National Liberation
Front demands the immediate
demobilization and disarming of the
Contras so there can be a peaceful
transition," he read from a statement
by the party leadership.
It said the Sandinistas would
"defend the integrity and profes
sionalism of the army and the police
forces."
President-elect Violeta Barrios de

Chamorro and her United National
Opposition alliance have promised to
eliminate the military draft and reduce
the size of the armed forces.
Control of the military and police is
considered the most delicate issue in
a power transfer. They are closely iden
tified with the Sandinista party and
the army is known as the Sandinista
People's Army, not the Nicaraguan
army.
Rafael Solis, a military commander,
said earlier yesterday that the Sandi
nistas would not give up control of
the armed forces and police unless the
Contras were disbanded.
Rank-and-file Sandinistas held dem
onstrations and some denounced the
election results, while grudgingly say
ing they would accept the party's loss.
Others urged Ortega not to give up
power.
Solis said of the Contras: "They have
to come back without arms. This is a
necessity in Nicaragua. We need this
in order to continue discussions about
our army."

He urged Chamorro's coalition to
press for disbanding the Contras, who
have been fighting, particularly with
the backing of the former Reagan ad
ministration, to overthrow the leftist
Sandinistas since 1981.
Chamorro, publisher of La Prensa
newspaper, is scheduled to take office
for a six-year term April 15.
Solis also said during a break in the
Sandinista meeting that "if UNO
decides to privatize the banking sys
tem it could be an irresponsible act
that starts a war."
"We Will Defend the Conquests of
the Revolution," read a front-page
headline in Barricada, the Sandinista
party newspaper.
Meanwhile, Ortega's defeat began to
sink in among his stunned supporters.
Voice of Nicaragua, the state radio,
broadcast hours of anguished calls
from Sandinista militants, many of
whom accused UNO of cheating its
way to victory and urged Ortega not
to concede defeat.
