Court defies Bush
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Boeing Co. did not violate a federal
conflict-of-interest law when the de
fense contractor paid $485,000 in
severance to five employees who left
to take government jobs, the Su
preme Court ruled yesterday.
By a 9-0 vote, the justices over
turned a ruling, supported by the
Bush administration, that the money
must be turned over to the govern
ment.
Justice John Paul Stevens, writing
for the court, said the payments "give
rise to a possible appearance of im
propriety."

But he said the conflict-of-interest
law also permits "corporations to en
courage qualified employees to make
their special skills available to the
government."
Court supports prisons
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday gave prison
officials sweeping power to force in
mates to take anti-psychotic drugs.
The 6-3 ruling in a Washington
state case is a victory for prison of
ficials and doctors who say they, and
not judges, should decide when such
powerful, behavior-modifying drugs
are administered.

The justices said prisoners are not
entitled to court hearings or other
due-process safeguards before they
must take the medication.
"Given the requirements of the
prison environment," Justice An
thony Kennedy wrote for the court,
the state may "treat a prison inmate
who has a serious mental illness with
anti-psychotic drugs against his will
if the inmate is dangerous to himself
or others and the treatment is in the
inmate's medical interest."
Patient's rights defined
WASHINGTON (AP) - People
held against their will at state mental

hospitals without receiving legally re
quired hearings may sue officials in
federal court for monetary damages,
the Supreme Court ruled by a 5-4
vote yesterday.
Ruling on homosexuals
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Gay rights
activists say a Supreme Court rebuff
will not deter their continuing fight
to overturn a general ban on homo
sexuals in the armed forces.
"There are other remedies for us
to take care of this deeply irrational
policy," said Peri Jude Radecic of the
National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force.
