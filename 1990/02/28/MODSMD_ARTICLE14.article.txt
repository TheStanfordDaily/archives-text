## A 						full distribution 
### 
AN UNDERSTANDING of is
sues of race, ethnicity and
gender is essential to a com
plete education.
Stanford is taking steps toward
recognizing this with a recent
report by the Subcommittee on
Distribution Requirements sub
mitted to the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. The
report presents reasons for making
courses on ethnicity, gender and
non-Western cultures mandatory.
The committee has not yet
decided how it will incorporate the
new requirements into present cur
riculum, and the proposal shows
imperfections. But the general
theme of the report points the Uni
versity in the right direction
toward making the Stanford edu
cation a complete education.
The report realizes that Stanford
must move forward with the
changing tides of the country.
There is a rising number of people
of color in the United States, and

the roles of gender have come to
the forefront of political debate.
It also recognizes that women
and people of color have played an
important role in the history of
the United States â€” a role that
can no longer be ignored.
The committee is right to con
sider consolidating current distri
bution requirements since the
structures of many majors, such
as engineering, make it impossible
for a student to fit more than eight
distribution requirements into his
or her schedule.
In this whole process of change,
we, as a community, are challenged
to define multiculturalism, to es
tablish clearly what the goal of a
University is and what we are
trying to accomplish through these
changes.
And in the end, Stanford stu
dents will graduate with an edu
cation that goes beyond one
perspective.
