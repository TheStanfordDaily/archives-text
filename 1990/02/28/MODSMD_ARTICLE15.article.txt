# Supportive theme

### 
A MULTICULTURAL theme
dorm for graduate students
is a proposal that makes very
good sense.
Such a residence would provide
a much-desired opportunity for
graduate students to study issues
of multiculturalism in a comfort
able setting and provide support
for graduate students of color at
Stanford.
Undergraduates have several
avenues through which they can
explore issues of pluralism, and
several ethnic theme dorms are of
fered as residential options. A grad
uate theme dorm would open up
similar opportunities for the often
neglected population of graduate
students here at Stanford.
The proposal is the brainchild of
the United Graduate Students' Al

liance, and several members of the
alliance have been advocating the
theme dorm's creation for the past
year.
Rodger Whitney, director of
housing, has suggested that the
multicultural residence program be
developed in all graduate residen
ces in the form of multicultural
cluster communities. Under Whit
ney's proposal, clusters of students
interested in exploring multicul
tural issues could be placed togther
and engage in focused program
ming on multicultural issues.
Cluster communities would not
provide the same supportive envi
ronment for students of color as
would a theme dorm, nor would
they provide a central gathering
place for graduate students on
campus.
