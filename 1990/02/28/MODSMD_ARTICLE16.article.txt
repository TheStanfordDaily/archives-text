Criticisms of article based on false charges, not facts

A FEB. 26 LETTER to The Daily,
co-signed by four Asian-American
students, criticizes my articles in
the Feb. 12 edition of The Stanford
Review. Those articles revealed that
Gordon Chang, a finalist for the Asian-
American studies professorship, has
been involved in the League of Revolu
tionary Struggle, a Marxist-Leninist
group.
The allegations expressed in the
letter about myself and The Review
are entirely false, with one exception.
Our headline, "Gordon Chang Con
nected to Maoist Cult," was indeed
worthy of the Enquirer. The difference
is that I can prove my claim.
The League is dedicated to infiltrat
ing and co-opting student groups and
lists "the Chicano, Asian, and Black
movements" among those it has
worked to infiltrate. League leaders
have explained that organizations are
best infiltrated by "winning over the
most advanced elements from those
groups," so that the groups' agendas

can be manipulated without the knowl
edge or consent of the majority of the
members.
These and all other facts and quota
tions can be found in the July 1979
issue of the Forward Journal of
Socialist Thought. Hoover Library has
a copy.
Unfortunately, the writers of the
Daily letter disregard the facts. Their
allegations ignore the content of my
articles, claiming only that "Daryl
Joseffer and the editors of The Stan
ford Review played upon the infamous
stereotype of Asians as sneaky, secre
tive subversives attempting to overrun
the country." I have never before
heard of such an absurd stereotype,
nor would I ever play upon it.
The letter further alleges that an
article in the Feb. 20 edition of The
Review argued "that a faculty mem
ber's political and 'religious' views are
a direct indication of the competency of
the professor to teach and research."
The placement of "religious" in quota
tion marks is puzzling. In that article,

written by myself, the word "religious"
never appeared, nor did a discussion of
religious issues.
I have never concluded that Chang
is "incompetent to be a professor,"
either. I quote myself from the Feb. 20
Review: "To assess Chang's qualifica
tions for the professorship it is impor
tant to determine the extent of
Chang's involvement with the League.
Like ASSU Senator Peter Thiel, I
'would like Professor Chang to clarify
his position as soon as possible.' "
I have made no "illegitimate at
tacks," as the letter also asserted. I
have merely brought certain facts into
the light that proponents of Gordon
Chang want hidden. They do not dis
pute the facts but try to discredit me
by phony charges of racism.
These charges, however, do not
change the fact that Gordon Chang
has been and may still be involved in
an organization which attempts to
infiltrate student movements in fur
thering its goal to "carry out a revolu
tion to overthrow the capitalist state,

seize political power and establish its
own dictatorship."
The letter's authors conclude by
accusing not only me, but all those
associated with The Stanford Review,
of hindering Asian-American studies:
"The Review fails to contribute con
structively to the discussion concerning
the development of Asian-American
studies. In fact, it obstructs rational,
constructive debate."
The writers of the letter apparently
believe that throwing around senseless
(and perhaps libelous) charges of rac
ism falls within the realm of rational
and constructive thought. I believe that
raising real concerns about the
qualifications of a candidate for the
Asian-American studies professorship
will help the best candidate get the
job. Critics of the truth, not revealers
of it, "defer us from our goals of
building multiculturalism."
