# Needless contact is bad development for college basketball

Coach Mike Montgomery called it
"good ol' slug-em-out basketball," but
Sunday's men's game against Arizona
State University looked like another
step in the evolution of a once tacti
cally alluring game into something
akin to a blood sport.
The Cardinal coach is not to blame
for this. Stanford's style tries to strike
a balance between power around the
basket and scoring from afar.
But the watchword in the NCAA
these days seems to call for the under

dog — in this case Arizona State — to
stop at almost nothing, under the
benign eye of the referees, to knock
the favored team off its stride. The
favorite then retaliates with glee.
This reminds me of my old days on
city playgrounds back East: no fouls
are called unless an autopsy is in or
der. In fact, this new trend seems to
have started in the Big East —
launched by Georgetown University —
and migrated westward. It also may be
abetted by the idea that international
competition is rougher than the tradi
tional American style of play, and so
the officials call a loose game to get
our side tough enough to handle the
foreigners.
Whatever the origins of this develop
ment, it is not good for basketball and
not welcomed be the fans, at least

those seated in my section at Maples
Pavilion.
