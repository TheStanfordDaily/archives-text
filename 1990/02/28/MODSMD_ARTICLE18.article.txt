# University has long neglected the needs of rape victims
## 
### 
I would like to applaud The Daily's
coverage in publishing its articles this
week on the administration's ineffec
tiveness in dealing with rape incidents
on campus. The Daily has boldly
publicized an issue which has been on
students' minds for many years but

which, evidently, was not on the minds
of people in the Office of Judicial
Affairs.
I know why students who have been
raped do not report the crimes to the
University The talk in student circles
has long been that Judicial Affairs does
not care to pursue such cases and
would rather smooth things over.
With such a reputation, it is no
wonder that victims would choose to
stay silent.
I hope that, with the publicity
brought to this issue by your articles,
changes within the administration
would be made to better support rape
victims in their needs.
