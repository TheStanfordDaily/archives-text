# Near West Campus faces cuts
## Earthquake, soaring indirect costs will result in scaling back of plans 
### Doug Lillydahl Staff writer 
Facing a 28 percent cut in funding
for construction of the Near West
Campus, the University is considering
several options to modify the $250 mil
lion project.
The University's decision to cap its
ever-increasing indirect cost rate, along
with earthquake repair costs and other
factors, have resulted in a $70 million
budget cut for the science and engineer
ing campus.
Researchers, who have the most to

gain from the Near West facility, have
told University officials that they are
willing to see its construction timetable
pushed back if it helps lure federal re
search dollars.
Funds from indirect cost recovery
help to finance the long-term debt the
University has incurred in building
Near West, a center designed to relieve
Stanford researchers from overcrowding
and give them state-of-the-art facilities.
But a higher indirect cost rate makes
Stanford less attractive as it competes
for federal research grants.
Indirect costs are added to research

grants to cover overhead expenses such
as building maintenance and utilities.
The Oct. 17 earthquake and the ad
ministration's recent decision to freeze
the indirect cost rate at 78 percent —
after it increases to that level from the
current 74 percent rate — have reduced
funding for Near West.
The freezing of the indirect cost rate
is part of the process reducing the ac
ademic impact of a $22 million budget
cut that will be made over the next 17
months.
