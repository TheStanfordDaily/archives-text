# Near West Campus faces cuts
## Earthquake, soaring indirect costs will result in scaling back of plans 
### Doug Lillydahl Staff writer 
Facing a 28 percent cut in funding
for construction of the Near West
Campus, the University is considering
several options to modify the $250 mil
lion project.
The University's decision to cap its
ever-increasing indirect cost rate, along
with earthquake repair costs and other
factors, have resulted in a $70 million
budget cut for the science and engineer
ing campus.
Researchers, who have the most to

gain from the Near West facility, have
told University officials that they are
willing to see its construction timetable
pushed back if it helps lure federal re
search dollars.
Funds from indirect cost recovery
help to finance the long-term debt the
University has incurred in building
Near West, a center designed to relieve
Stanford researchers from overcrowding
and give them state-of-the-art facilities.
But a higher indirect cost rate makes
Stanford less attractive as it competes
for federal research grants.
Indirect costs are added to research

grants to cover overhead expenses such
as building maintenance and utilities.
The Oct. 17 earthquake and the ad
ministration's recent decision to freeze
the indirect cost rate at 78 percent —
after it increases to that level from the
current 74 percent rate — have reduced
funding for Near West.
The freezing of the indirect cost rate
is part of the process reducing the ac
ademic impact of a $22 million budget
cut that will be made over the next 17
months.
Earthquake relief funds have
two sources of Near West
-funding. The University will
Mivert $14 million of an original
$20 million fund for Near West
• construction to earthquake repair.
In addition, the Centennial Cam
paign will contribute $40 million
*of its $180 million in Near West
vfunds to campus repair coffers.
• The biggest effect of capping
*the indirect cost rate is the lim
itation on the amount of long
term debt the University can
• afford to carry.
3 John Hughes, associate provost
•for facilities planning, explained
*that the reduction in income due
to the frozen indirect cost rate
would reduce the amount of long
term debt that the University can
afford to carry for Near West from
$50 million to $37 million.
In response to the $70 million
funding reduction, Hughes said
the University is considering four
ways to reduce the costs of Near
West and to complete as much of
the project as possible.
The first response is to review
design plans to try to redesign
the buildings more efficiently
while still meeting program re
quirements.
The second method is to alter
the "phase planning" of the proj
, ect, perhaps planning only for the
research needs of a department
for the next 10 years, leaving
room to expand, instead of for the
next 20 years.
The third response is to attempt
to modify existing facilities for ex
tended use. As Hughes put it,

"When push comes to shove, you
can always drive your old clunker
another year."
Finally, the University will con
sider simply scaling down the size
of some of the buildings, while
again leaving room for future ex
pansion.
Professors in affected depart
ments expressed support for the
University's actions.
Prof. Joseph Goodman, chair of
the Electrical Engineering De
partment, said, "The building of
Near West is an issue of long-term
competitiveness in electrical engi
neering, but the stability of rates
is both long- and short-term. I'm
not saying that we wouldn't wel
come the space, but there are
needs in attracting external fund
ing. The immediate problem was
the overhead rate."
Goodman's views were echoed
by George Wheaton, associate
chair of the Computer Science De
partment. He said his department
was "universally upset" by high
proposed indirect cost rates even
though delaying the Near West
Campus means the department
must continue being divided
among eight locations, a condition
he said is "desperately" in need
of correction.
Even members of departments
with the most pressing needs for
improved facilities said they were
willing to accept the tradeoff. The
Statistics Department, operating
out of Sequoia Hall, cannot install
the newest computer systems due
to wiring problems in the century
old building. But Statistics Chair
Jerome Friedman said, "We would
be willing to trade [a delay for a
lower indirect cost rate], although
we are looking forward to our new
facilities."

Ambitious Expansion
The Near West Campus, originally a $250-million project to moder
nize Stanford's science and engineering facilities, is facing cutbacks
and possible delays.
