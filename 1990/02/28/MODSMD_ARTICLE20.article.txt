## Prayer for understanding 
### 
IT'S 11:45 p.m. Time for bed. But
first I have to say my prayers.
Lord, tonight I saw "Tongues
Untied," the movie by Marlon Riggs
about black gay life. It was shown in
Ujamaa as part of the Black History
Month celebration. Lord, thank you for
that movie. It is so rewarding to see our
story told in all of its magnificence and
complexity.
Lord, tonight you allowed my black
brothers and sisters to see a part of their
community that many of them have
denied existed. I remember a time when
I thought being black and being gay was
a contradiction, that somehow I had to
choose. But Lord, you showed me that I
could be both, that I was black and gay,
and that I was loved by you. And tonight
you showed them, Lord. You showed my
black brothers and sisters that we are
just as black and proud as they are.
Lord, so many gay people have turned
away from you. We live in a society that
has taught us that gay people are not
allowed to worship you, that to be gay
is to be un-Christian. It pains me to see
so many gay people reject you because
the church has rejected them. Lord, let
my gay brothers and sisters know, as
you have let me know, that we too are
your chosen.
Lord, I have always believed in you.
When I was a little boy, before I went to
sleep, I would ask you to bring me sweet
dreams of other little boys. I would say,
"Lord, please let me kiss a boy in my
dreams tonight." You would answer my
dreams, Lord, and sometimes you even
let me do more than kiss. It got so that

I didn't have to ask, you would just pro
vide them for me, as you have always
provided for me.
Lord, I know many people look on these
dreams as expressions of carnal sin. But
Lord, I thank you for those dreams be
cause for me they were affirmations that
I too was human. My dreams were often
the only place where I could love and be
loved.
Lord, thank you for making me gay.
Although it has not been easy, I would
not want to be anyone else. Lord, I wish
that I could have shared my gayness with
my relatives who have passsed on. So
many of our kin die before we get a
chance to share our whole lives — and
our special secret — with them. I re
member when Granny died. I was sad to
lose one of my best friends, but I was
also happy because I knew you would
show her the part of me that I was afraid
to tell her. Lord, I take pleasure in
knowing that you and Granny love me.
Lord, help all those who are still in
the closet to come out. Allow them to
throw open those doors and to start truly
living. Make it so they no longer have
to find love and acceptance in the
bathrooms of Meyer and Green Libraries.
Lord, let that little boy or girl in Boise,
Idaho know that he or she isn't alone in
this world, that there are millions just
like him or her.
Lord, thank you for bringing me to
Stanford. I must say this is a pretty
supportive environment for gay people.
Thank you for letting the Gay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford be there when
I was ready to come out. And Lord, allow

But Lord, you showed
me that I could be
both, that I was black
and gay, and that I was
loved by you.

them to continue to work your magic
with other gay people.
Lord, because of you I lead a peaceful
and joyous life. But it's getting harder
to do. Each day one of my brothers or
sisters dies from AIDS or by the hands
of some vicious and heartless gay-basher.
Lord, I ask you, find a cure for my dying
brothers and sisters and for the sick gay
bashers.
Lord, I look forward to the day when
I can sit at your feet and bathe in all
your shining light and glory. I look for
ward to when I can see Granny and my
other relatives again. I look forward to
when I can tell James Baldwin, Alvin
Ailey, Patrick Kelley, Pat Parker, Joseph
Beam, Ma' Rainey, Sylvester and Bayard
Rustin "Thank you" for being black and
gay. Amen.

When I was a little boy, before I went to
sleep, I would ask you to bring me sweet
dreams of other little boys. I would say,
"Lord, please let me kiss a boy in my
dreams tonight." You would answer my
dreams, Lord, and sometimes you even
let me do more than kiss. It got so that

I didn't have to ask, you would just pro
vide them for me, as you have always
provided for me.
Lord, I know many people look on these
dreams as expressions of carnal sin. But
Lord, I thank you for those dreams be
cause for me they were affirmations that
I too was human. My dreams were often
the only place where I could love and be
loved.
Lord, thank you for making me gay.
Although it has not been easy, I would
not want to be anyone else. Lord, I wish
that I could have shared my gayness with
my relatives who have passsed on. So

Lord, I look forward to the day when
I can sit at your feet and bathe in all
your shining light and glory. I look for

other relatives again. I look forward to
when I can tell James Baldwin, Alvin

Beam, Ma' Rainey, Sylvester and Bayard
Rustin "Thank you" for being black and
gay. Amen.
