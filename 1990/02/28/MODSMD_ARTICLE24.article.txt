## Bug gets tanked 
### Megan Beardsley Staff writer 
(~\.How does a gas pump
vy > know when the tank is
full?
A. The gasoline pump shuts
• off when the fuel reaches
the nozzle, says Charlie Bourke
of Bay Area Pump and Meter.
There is a sensor at the nozzle's
tip that detects the gas and
sends a message to the pump.
I decided this was something
I had to see for myself, so I
hopped on my bike and rode
down to the campus gas sta
tion. When I got there, I hopped
off, grabbed the nearest gas
hose and peered into the
nozzle. The attendant looked at
me kind of funny, but that's
the price you pay for scientific
research.
Sure enough, there was a
little hole on the outside of the
nozzle connected to a thin tube
inside the hose. Bourke says
this tube goes up to a computer
inside the pump. When gasoline
reaches the hole, no more air
enters the tube, and the com
puter knows to shut off.
Pretty nifty, huh?
According to popular
W . belief, the simulated fog
thai envelops rock bands at con
certs is carbon dioxide vapor
created by adding water to dry
ice. However, if this were true,
wouldn't many of our beloved
rock idols simply be food for
worms by now? Carbon dioxide
vapor is rather hard to breathe
— in fact, a mouse can die
when exposed to heavy carbon
dioxide vapor for more than 30
minutes.
So, do explain this enigma.
A. There are two types of
• fog makers, according to
Hugh Robertson of Mundy and
Collins Inc., a company that
rents the machines. A newer
type "looks like an underwater

spear gun," Robertson says,
and creates a dark smoke by
heating up a mixture of chemi
cals.
The more standard fog ma
chine, the type Robertson
recommends, is a 55-gallon oil
drum attached to a tube and
a fan. A grating inside the
drum holds a block of dry ice,
and when you push a lever, the
grating drops the ice into the
water below. The ice quickly
turns into a cold gas, and the
fan blows the resulting fog
where it's needed.
But the fog you see is not
clouds of carbon dioxide. It's
water vapor. The cold carbon
dioxide gas cools the water that
is already in the air until it
condenses into clouds of fog.
Carbon dioxide itself is invis
ible as a gas.
