# Biologists study plants for future
## 
### Joanna Sosinska Staff writer 
Hidden behind the trees across
from Forsythe Hall, the Carnegie
Institution's Department of Plant
Biology is a center for study of
plant adaptation in a long-term
quest to find practical applica
tions for plant biology to benefit
all people.
As cropland dwindles, the pop
ulation soars and the climate
deteriorates, scientists have be
come increasingly concerned
about the future of the earth.
Human survival may ultimately
depend on plants, and the
biologists at the Carnegie Institu
tion have responded to this need
for plant research by studying
photosynthesis and the adapta
tion of plants to environmental
stresses.
The primary biological process
in nature is photosynthesis, the
conversion of sunlight into chemi
cal energy by plants. Through
photosynthesis, plants are
responsible for the oxygen we
breathe, organic fuels and fibers,
and the major part of our food
supply.
Despite advances in knowledge
about photosynthesis, there is still
much to learn.
One important line of research
in photosynthesis and plant adap
tation is conducted at the depart
ment by Olle Bjorkman. His group
studies the genetic, biochemical
and physiological mechanisms un
derlying the evolution and adap

tation of plants to varying
environments.
Research takes place not only
at the institution but also at field
sites around the world, including
the tropical rain forests in Central
America, salt marshes in
Australia and the desert in Death
Valley.
The aim of one part of the study
is "to determine, on the molecular
level, the plants' ability to cope
with excessive light," Bjorkman
says. "When the amount of light
energy captured by a plant far
exceeds the rate at which it can
be processed by photosynthesis, it
can cause harm to the system."
The molecular mechanism by
which plants are able to safely
dissipate this excess energy as
heat is of prime concern.
Identical species of plants may
have different levels of excess en
ergy, depending on the plant's nat
ural environment. A plant
growing in bright sunlight will
have a higher tolerance for exces
sive light than the same species
of plant growing in a shaded en
vironment that is suddenly ex
posed to more light by gaps in
the forest canopy or by a fallen
tree, explains Bjorkman.
In laboratory experiments,
leaves of a plant grown in weak
light were found to be much more
susceptible to photosynthetic sys
tem damage than leaves of the
identical species grown under
bright light.
"And its not just that the (high
light) plants have a higher

capacity for processing energy,"
explains Bjorkman. Further tests
showed that the photosynthetic
systems of the plants grown in
high-light conditions were in
trinsically more resistant to
damage than were those of the
plants grown in low light.
Presumably the plants fre
quently exposed to high light have
a more powerful photoprotective
mechanism for dissipating exces
sive energy as heat. Currently,
Bjorkman's group is studying the
possible mechanisms for this non
destructive dissipation of exces
sive light energy.
Bjorkman's research is just one
of several topics of study at the
Department of Plant Biology.
"There is also a lot of research
going on that is concerned with
global carbon dioxide change,"
says Winslow Briggs, director of
the department. "Many research
ers are concerned with climate
change. Meteorologists and phys
icists, for example, are engaged in
an atmospheric modeling, but
none of them puts plants into the
equations. They regard them as
a great buffer."
The institution is totally inde
pendent from Stanford, although
a few of the Carnegie researchers
are also professors in the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences.
Several graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows from the de
partment are involved in the
research as well.
The plant biology laboratory is
one of five research departments

that compose the Carnegie Insti
tution of Washington. Two other
departments, the Department of
Terrestrial Magnetism and the
Geophysical Laboratory, are lo
cated in Washington, D.C. The
central financial and administra
tive offices are based there, too.
The Department of Embryology
is in Baltimore, and the fifth
branch, the Las Campanas Obser
vatory, is in Chile.
The Carnegie Institution was
founded in 1902 by Andrew Car
negie with an endowment of $10
million. Today, the institution's
activities are financed primarily
by income from the original en
dowment and by federal grants
and private contributions.
In the words of Andrew Car
negie, the institution was meant
to "encourage, in the broadest and
most liberal manner, investiga
tion, research and discovery and
the application of knowledge to
the improvement of mankind."
From the earliest years, the in
stitution's five departments have
been devoted to fields of research
that its trustees and staff consider
among the most significant for
the advancement of science.
The department has its contri
bution to agriculture, as well. "We
have discovered that with highly
sensitive equipment, you can
detect subtle changes in the color
of the plants from remote dis
tances. Soon we will be able to
determine the relative health of
a crop by satellite photos," says
Briggs.

responsible for the oxygen we
breathe, organic fuels and fibers,
and the major part of our food
supply.
Despite advances in knowledge
about photosynthesis, there is still
much to learn.
One important line of research
in photosynthesis and plant adap
tation is conducted at the depart
ment by Olle Bjorkman. His group
studies the genetic, biochemical
and physiological mechanisms un
derlying the evolution and adap

tation of plants to varying
environments.
Research takes place not only
at the institution but also at field
sites around the world, including
the tropical rain forests in Central
America, salt marshes in
Australia and the desert in Death
Valley.
The aim of one part of the study
is "to determine, on the molecular
level, the plants' ability to cope
with excessive light," Bjorkman
says. "When the amount of light
energy captured by a plant far
exceeds the rate at which it can
be processed by photosynthesis, it
can cause harm to the system."
The molecular mechanism by
which plants are able to safely
dissipate this excess energy as
heat is of prime concern.
Identical species of plants may
have different levels of excess en
ergy, depending on the plant's nat
ural environment. A plant
growing in bright sunlight will
have a higher tolerance for exces
sive light than the same species
of plant growing in a shaded en
vironment that is suddenly ex
posed to more light by gaps in
the forest canopy or by a fallen
tree, explains Bjorkman.
In laboratory experiments,
leaves of a plant grown in weak
light were found to be much more
susceptible to photosynthetic sys
tem damage than leaves of the
identical species grown under
bright light.
"And its not just that the (high
light) plants have a higher

capacity for processing energy,"
explains Bjorkman. Further tests
showed that the photosynthetic
systems of the plants grown in
high-light conditions were in
trinsically more resistant to
damage than were those of the
plants grown in low light.
Presumably the plants fre
quently exposed to high light have
a more powerful photoprotective
mechanism for dissipating exces
sive energy as heat. Currently,
Bjorkman's group is studying the
possible mechanisms for this non
destructive dissipation of exces
sive light energy.
Bjorkman's research is just one
of several topics of study at the
Department of Plant Biology.
"There is also a lot of research
going on that is concerned with
global carbon dioxide change,"
says Winslow Briggs, director of
the department. "Many research
ers are concerned with climate
change. Meteorologists and phys
icists, for example, are engaged in
an atmospheric modeling, but
none of them puts plants into the
equations. They regard them as
a great buffer."
The institution is totally inde
pendent from Stanford, although
a few of the Carnegie researchers
are also professors in the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences.
Several graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows from the de
partment are involved in the
research as well.
The plant biology laboratory is
one of five research departments

that compose the Carnegie Insti
tution of Washington. Two other
departments, the Department of
Terrestrial Magnetism and the
Geophysical Laboratory, are lo
cated in Washington, D.C. The
central financial and administra
tive offices are based there, too.
The Department of Embryology
is in Baltimore, and the fifth
branch, the Las Campanas Obser
vatory, is in Chile.
The Carnegie Institution was
founded in 1902 by Andrew Car
negie with an endowment of $10
million. Today, the institution's
activities are financed primarily
by income from the original en
dowment and by federal grants
and private contributions.
In the words of Andrew Car
negie, the institution was meant
to "encourage, in the broadest and
most liberal manner, investiga
tion, research and discovery and
the application of knowledge to
the improvement of mankind."
From the earliest years, the in
stitution's five departments have
been devoted to fields of research
that its trustees and staff consider
among the most significant for
the advancement of science.
The department has its contri
bution to agriculture, as well. "We
have discovered that with highly
sensitive equipment, you can
detect subtle changes in the color
of the plants from remote dis
tances. Soon we will be able to
determine the relative health of
a crop by satellite photos," says
Briggs.
Hidden behind the trees across
from Forsythe Hall, the Carnegie
Institution's Department of Plant
Biology is a center for study of
plant adaptation in a long-term
quest to find practical applica
tions for plant biology to benefit
all people.
As cropland dwindles, the pop
ulation soars and the climate
deteriorates, scientists have be
come increasingly concerned
about the future of the earth.
Human survival may ultimately
depend on plants, and the
biologists at the Carnegie Institu
tion have responded to this need
for plant research by studying
photosynthesis and the adapta
tion of plants to environmental
stresses.
The primary biological process
in nature is photosynthesis, the
conversion of sunlight into chemi
cal energy by plants. Through
photosynthesis, plants are
responsible for the oxygen we
breathe, organic fuels and fibers,
and the major part of our food
supply.
