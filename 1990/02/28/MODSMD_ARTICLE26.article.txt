Chemical may help
atherosclerosis
Stanford researchers have isolated a
chemical that may be the key to the cure
for atherosclerosis.
The chemical, called heparan sulfate, in
hibits the growth of smooth muscle cells.
Smooth muscle cells in the arteries provide

the attachment points for the cholesterol
that blocks blood flow. Dr. William Benitz
of the department of pediatrics said, "We
think one application of the growth inhibitor
we identified might be to prevent the mi
gration and proliferation of smooth muscle
cells so they don't get the process of at
herosclerosis started."
A similar molecule, called heparin, has
long been known to inhibit smooth muscle

growth. But the Stanford researchers have
isolated the natural version of this molecule.
The researchers also hope to use the
chemical in other cases of excessive smooth
muscle growth, including a rare lung disease
in newborns and complications after vas
cular surgery.
The group received a patent on the
molecule last October and has licensed it to
a pharmaceutical company in Alameda.
