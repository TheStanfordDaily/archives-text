# Clean Air Act hasn't fixed smoggy skies
## 
### Jessica Hirst Staff writer 
In 1970 the Clean Air Act
promised to clean up the nation's
air, yet in 1988 more than 150
million Americans — over half the
population — were breathing con
centrations of ozone or carbon
monoxide considered unsafe by
the Environmental Protection
Agency.
What happened?
The act aimed to reduce auto
emissions by 90 percent in five
years, create standards to protect
even the most sensitive citizens
from the ill effects of air pollution
by 1971, and have all 50 states
design programs to meet these
standards by 1972.
The main target was smog, the
brownish mix of photochemical
pollutants that had enshrouded
many of the nation's cities — in
cluding Washington, D.C. — in
particularly acute attacks in the
years just prior to 1970. Pollut
ants included ozone, carbon
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur
dioxide, hydrocarbons and small
airborne particles.
Automobiles, the source
of most of these pollutants, were
singled out for improvement. Leg
islators demanded that the car in
dustry produce clean cars that
emit 10 times less pollution by
1975. Arming the newly-created
EPA with the Clean Air Act stand
ards, legislators declared that the
act would set the nation on the
fast track to clean, healthy air.
Unfortunately, the elimination

of air pollution has suffered severe
setbacks in the 20 years since the
act was passed. The regulatory
mechanisms it created have not
been able to bring air pollution
under control. The act has clearly
slowed the pace of the deteriora
tion of air quality, but has fallen
far short of its goal of clean air.
Although 1977 was set as the
final date by which every state in
the nation was to meet the clean
air standards, a long series of ex
tensions granted by the EPA and
Congress delayed this day of reck
oning all the way to 1987. The
results were dismal.
Los Angeles, bathed in auto ex
haust, was in violation of the
ozone standard 150 days in 1987.
Sixty-one other air quality
regions, including New York,
Houston, Chicago, Denver and
San Diego, each violated the
standard more than 30 days that
year. Los Angeles and Denver
were so polluted that they both
would have needed an immediate
70 percent reduction in pollution
to meet the act's 1987 deadline.
The press, perhaps in anticipa
tion of a sensational fiasco,
printed maps of the United States
showing all the cities in violation
of air pollution standards and
waited to see how much improve

ment the next year might bring.
In 1988, however, the number of
cities unable to meet the federal
ozone standards rose to more than
100.
The act's failure to reduce pol
lution from automobiles, the
source of smog, was the
most salient factor behind the
deteriorating conditions. Simply
put, the act banked its strategy
for eliminating smog on draconian
laws demanding that the auto in
dustry put non-polluting cars —
vehicles that produced 10 times
less pollution — on the market
by 1975.
Despite Detroit's repeated
warnings that few such reductions
would be forthcoming, legislators
failed to see that they simply
could not have clean air in cities
still bustling with millions of cars.
Indeed, EPA reports show that by
1977 auto emissions of hydrocar
bons and carbon monoxide had
gone down by only 14 percent and
16 percent respectively, while total
auto emissions of nitrogen oxides
actually increased, though at a
much slower pace. Part of the
problem stems from the fact that
engines run to decrease carbon
monoxide emissions usually raise
nitrogen oxides.
Thus, the act's central strategy
for reducing pollution failed,
largely because it paid no serious
attention to the two most impor
tant means of controlling vehicle
emissions — improving gas
mileage and reducing total

mileage driven.
The single greatest obstacle to
clean air has been the continuous
growth of the number of cars, and
the number of vehicle-miles
driven. This year, Americans will
drive 25 billion more vehicle-miles
than in 1989.
Providing rail and subway serv
ice to commuters fed up with car
exhaust and traffic is a good way
to cut down the numbers of cars
on the road. Sadly, mass transit
was seen as a threat to the auto
and oil industries, and provisions
for it were not included in the
Clean Air Act.
Instead, the act recommended
that states discourage driving by
instituting car-pool lanes, higher
bridge tolls and parking restric
tions. Such gestures have had
little effect, and vehicle-miles
driven have increased by an
alarming 50 percent since the act's
passage.
This growth has overwhelmed
the act's strategy of controlling
auto pollution and has prevented
the achievement of clean air. In
order to make future improve
ments, the Clean Air Act will have
to make effective plans to reduce
the number of cars on the road,
cut down the number of miles
driven, deal with the pollution
from older cars still on the road,
and improve the efficiency and
cleanliness of new cars. Sylvia
Dugre of the EPA describes cur
rent efforts, "It's a losing battle,
it seems."
