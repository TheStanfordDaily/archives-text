# Apple has trouble
##

Once upon a time, the words
Apple Computer were chanted
like some sort of Silicon Valley
mantra. The company was the
holy grail of high technology
— a start-up that became a
giant killer by popularizing the
personal computer with the
Apple 11.

Then, things
went sour. The
Apple 111 was a
commercial and
technological dis
aster that cost
the company mil
lions. Apple's
next offering, the
Lisa, was a
similar failure.

Steve Wozniak, one of the com
pany's co-founders, was already
just a memory.
Layoffs came, and employee
morale was low. Steve Jobs,
Apple's other founding father,
was stripped of his power and
forced to leave the firm he had
nurtured from its birth to a
billion-dollar enterprise.
John Sculley became Apple's
leader and turned things
around. He brought unprece
dented growth to the firm,
made the Macintosh into a
sensational success and has set
the stage for a quintupling of
Apple's revenue.
Everything seemed to be in
place for the upward spiral to
continue through the end of
the century. Apple already has
videos that demonstrate their
computer of the year 2000 —
the Knowledge Navigator. But
all is not well on the Cupertino
campus of Apple.

Sales of the Macintosh are
slipping as a result of an
industry-wide slump and the
high cost of the computer. Two
months from now, 400 employ
ees will be laid off. This is a
much smaller percentage of the
work force than the one-fifth
trimmed a few years ago, but
is significant nonetheless. Wall
Street has soured on the stock

and the firm's
share has not
risen in some
time.
In late 1989,
Del Yocam, who
had been with
Apple from its
earliest days,
resigned under
heavy pressure

from his post as
president of one of the firm's
four divisions. No one knew it
at the time, but it was just the
first of many changes.
Allen Loren, a financial hot
shot from the insurance indus
try, arrived with much fanfare
at Apple a year and a half ago.
He was one of the company's
new darlings. Just weeks ago,
he was forced out of the com
pany.
Today, Apple suffers from a
lack of direction — much the
way it did five years ago. Ex
ecutives might be able to tell
you what their computers will
look like in 10 years but have
no idea what they'll be like in
two.
Once upon a time, Apple lost
its magic and recaptured it. As
the 1990s begin, the mystical
aura surrounding the firm has
faded again. How it can be
recaptured will be the subject
of the next Computer Corner.
