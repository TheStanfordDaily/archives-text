## Six-run first (barely) enough as Card downs Aggies 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
For eight innings of yesterday's
game at Sunken Diamond, the
Stanford and UC-Davis baseball
teams put on a performance tlfat
had all the suspense, drama and
excitement of your average knit
ting show.
That was probably just fine
with the Cardinal nine, who were
ahead for that entire span thanks
to a six-run first. When things
finally got interesting in the ninth
inning, though, Stanford almost
hung itself before escaping with
the win.
The start of the game looked a
lot like the previous day's laugher
against Lewis and Clark, as the
Cardinal scored six runs on a
double, four singles and three
walks given up by Aggie starter
John Nelson. The walks came
courtesy of some lousy control
and, according to the Aggies, not
a little creative umpiring.
So, Davis Coach Phil Swinley,
any comment about the calls?
"Not for publication."
One of the Aggie assistants had
more than a few things to say,

however, and his complaints
earned him an ejection in the
seventh inning. By then the game
had become a tad slow: Stanford
had only four lonely hits in the
last seven innings, while Davis
scraped back in the game with
three runs off John Reid (who
picked up the win to go 2-1) and
Aaron Dorlarque.
Then came the ninth. Scott
Weiss had come on to nail down
the win, but instead finally made
the game interesting — which was
the last thing he wanted to do.
Weiss walked the first batter he
faced, then gave up a one-out
double to Jim Reiley and a walk
to Jason Wright. Bases loaded,
one out.
"I just had bad mechanics,"
Weiss said. "I couldn't get my fast
ball over the plate."
Warren Buck was up next. First
pitch: called strike one. Next: a
swing and a miss on a curve, oh
and-two. The next curve looped

in, and Buck was rung up. And
was less than pleased.
"You're the worst!" Buck yelled
at the ump. "That's such bulls—!"
Coach? "Not for publication."

After jumping on Lewis and Clark for seven runs in the first on Monday, Stanford enjoyed a six-run
bulge after the first stanza yesterday. The Cardinal could not manage another tally, but hung on to
win 6-5.
number four and a subsequent
single by Spencer Skeen brought
the Aggies within one. S win ley
held Wright at third on the play,
which turned out to be a wise
move as rightfielder Paul Carey
threw a bullet to the plate.
With the tying run 90 feet away,
Bert Greene stepped in the box
— and watched the first pitch sail
way high. The next two were
called strikes, and after another
ball, Weiss ended the game by tos

the outside corner.
