# Reserve judgment — Richards' talent awaits unveiling
## 
### 
Watch Martha Richards on the bas
ketball court for a while and
you'll see flashes of brilliance.
One minute she throws a perfect no-look
pass from the top of the key that finds
an open teammate on the baseline.
A moment goes by and she sinks a
three-pointer with a defender's hand in
her face. Later, she dribbles into the paint
and lets fly her patented shot — a long
distance layup known simply as "the run
ner" — which finds nothing but net.
Richards has that rare ability to make
her teammates better. As a senior at Hud
son High School in Wisconsin, she led
the team to a 22-3 record and its first
appearance in the state tournament in
56 years. Richards put up big numbers
that season, averaging 26.6 points, 7.4
rebounds, 7.5 assists and 3.9 steals.
All the major organizations that follow
women's basketball named the 5-foot-ll
guard a first-team Ail-American — USA
Today and Parade Magazine among them.
The Women's Basketball News Sevice
named her its 1987-88 National Player
of the Year.
With such impressive press clippings,

Richards' arrival at Stanford was greeted
with much anticipation. Though the Car
dinal already had two of the nation's best
guards in Jennifer Azzi and Sonja Hen
ning, it seemed there would surely be
room for a player like Richards to make
a major contribution.
At times last season, she had the op
portunity to do just that despite finding
playing time hard to come by. Richards
averaged just 10 minutes and scored
slightly over four points per game. She
shot a stellar 45 percent from three-point
range.
To the outside observer it might have
been a case of failing to meet expecta
tions, but not to Richards. "Deep down,
I wanted to play more," she says. "But
I don't think I actually felt that I would.
All everybody said to me (before last
season) was high school to college is such
a big jump.
"I really came in less confident than I
should have. I came in a little scared the
first few weeks. This year, when I came
back, I was determined the only thing 1
ever would say to myself is, 'You know
how to play basketball, so just play.' "

Despite some tough times, she does
not see her freshman campaign as a
wasted experience. "Last year was hard
on me and yet it was really good because
I learned a lot. I learned to play a reserve
role which is good because it makes you
appreciate your time on the floor that
much more.
"You're used to being on the floor the
whole game and leading your team (in
high school)," she says. Sitting on the
bench last year she thought, "You know
you're important and yet you don't feel
as though you're contributing because
you're not on the floor."
With the learning experience of fresh
man year behind her, expectations among
Cardinal followers again ran at a fever
pitch. The women's basketball media
guide for 1989-90 reads as follows:
"Martha is considered the time bomb of
the Stanford team ... A most talented
guard just ready to explode."
As of now, she's still waiting for detona
tion. She has taken on a new position:
backing up superstar Katy Steding at
small forward. Richards' has seen her
playing time increase by about two

minutes per game, but her scoring is
down from last year. Her career high
remains 13 points — set in her very first
game at Stanford.
The most noticeable number among
her statistics is a .307 field goal percent
age. "Sometimes when I look at my shoot
ing percentage, I think, 'Gosh, I didn't
think I was shooting that poorly,' " she
says."I really believe that this year had
been a much better year for me.
"Granted, looking at the stats, it hasn't
been. But 1 think I've done a lot more
for the team this year. When I'm around
I my teammatesl sometimes I feel things
aren't falling my way today. Then I say,
'Well, you know, we have a great thing

going.' " Great, indeed. The Cardinal is
24-1 and a top contender to win a national
crown.
"I think that's the one thing that's
really helped me is that I can look at the
big picture," she adds. "I know I have
to go out there every day in practice and
push our starters. I have to be ready to
come in, like at Arizona (where she scored
10 points), and do the things that are
necessary to pick the team up."
It would have been easy for Richards
to brood about her troubles and be
come a negative influence on the
team. But this is a dream season for the
Cardinal, a fact that has not escaped
Richards' notice.
"I think 1 realize that college basketball
is all about winning an NCAA champi
onship," she says. All the statistics and
talk about starting is unimportant to her.
"I just want to be part of a good team.
I still have a lot of confidence that I've
come in and made a difference, even if
the difference I make isn't necessarily

seen on the court."
With that, perhaps Richards
recognizes her greatest gift. Even
if she is not out there to make
that no-look pass, she is the con
summate team player. In practice,
she gives that extra effort that
pushes an Azzi or a Steding to
be a better player.
Off the court, she is always

smiling and telling jokes. When
you are around Martha Richards
you cannot help but feel good
about her. She is the one about
whom people use the phrase
"great person."
Someday soon, she will also
probably become a great player
because, through it all, she has
not lost her desire.
"I'd like to be on the floor, but
we have so many good players,"
she says. Three of those players
— Azzi, Steding and Stacy Parson

— will be gone next year, though.
Richards knows she will have the
chance to see significant playing
time and win a starting spot at
small forward or shooting guard.
"For me, it's a little easier this
year because there's a little bit of
light at the end of the tunnel,"
Richards says, looking to the fu
ture. "The best of Martha Ric
hards, I think, is yet to come."
