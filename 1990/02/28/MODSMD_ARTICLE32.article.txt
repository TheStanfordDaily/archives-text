# NCAA-bound Bears hit Maples hardwood
## More than just cross-Bay rivalry at stake in national TV contest 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Before the start of the year,
some guy at ESPN decided they
should televise a basketball game
between Stanford and California.
At the time, it probably seemed
like a dumb idea: both teams were
expected to be in rebuilding years,
and while the game would prob
ably be close, it figured to be be
tween two teams with little chance
of having to forfeit spring break
for a postseason tournament.
Now, however, that guy looks
like a genius.
At Maples Pavilion tonight a
national television audience will
get a peek at two of the West's
most surprising teams. The
Golden Bears, after Leonard
Taylor and his school single
season record 649 points gradu
ated, have bounced back for their
third 20-win season in the last
four years. After going to the NIT
Tournament in 1986, '87 and '89,
the Bears look like NCAA tourney
material.
Meanwhile the host Cardinal
has had its share of ups and
downs this season, as would be
expected of a very young team.
But after six prominent players
graduated, scattering almost any
amount of ups amid the downs

seemed like it would be an ac
complishment. Stanford has cer
tainly managed that, bring a 16-9
record and hopes of an NIT berth
into tonight's contest.
With both teams looking to get
themselves noticed by the various
tournament selection committees,
and with national exposure pres
ent to help that cause, the long
time rivals will be even more in
tense tonight.
"It's an important game for us
as far as postseason goes," Stan
ford forward Andrew Vlahov said.
"They're going to look at what
happened at the end of the season.
We're on the bubble now and we
need a couple more wins to push
us over the edge."
While Cardinal Coach Mike
Montgomery has done a fine job
in getting his players to perform
at a higher-than-expected level,
Cal Coach Lou Campanelli has
done the same thing. After losing
Taylor and forward Matt Beeuw
saert to graduation, the Golden
Bears seemed pretty thin in the
front court.
But with junior forward Roy
Fisher continuing to improve,
with center Brian Hendrick
making a strong run at Pac-10
Freshman-of-the-Year honors and

position to get some kind of postseason bid, especially with a good showing tonight.
with a three-guard lineup, Cam
panelli solved that problem.
While earlier in the season
Hendrick was making waves by
making shots, he has cooled off a
bit. He is still second in the Pac-10
in field goal percentage, but hasn't
been scoring as much the past
month. So while he hasn't been
as effective, both Fisher and
senior point guard Keith Smith
have raised their games to new
levels.
Fisher has been scoring both
inside and outside lately and has
upped his rebounding numbers

'It's an important
game for us as far as
postseason goes.'

while Smith has been doing it all.
He leads the team in scoring and
assists and leads the league in
three-point accuracy at 48.7 per
cent. He earned Pac-10 Player-of
the-Week honors two weeks ago
after leading the Bears to victories
over both UCLA and USC in Los
Angeles.
"Keith Smith is a very good
player who makes everyone else
better," Montgomery said. "He
gets the ball to the three-point

shooters, penetrates well. . . .
They've got some real good
players but Smith's the guy who
makes everyone better. He's the
guy we have to contain."
Stanford will probably try to
work the ball inside to the team's
top two scorers, Adam Keefe and
Vlahov. Vlahov has been especially
hot of late after adjusting to his
new role as primarily a post-up
player.
This game should provide a
great glimpse of things to come
as these two teams will meet again
Sunday afternoon. The two will
likely also have a date a week
from Friday in the opening round
of the Pacific 10 Conference Tour
nament.

ent to help that cause, the long
time rivals will be even more in
tense tonight.
"It's an important game for us
as far as postseason goes," Stan
ford forward Andrew Vlahov said.
"They're going to look at what
happened at the end of the season.
We're on the bubble now and we
need a couple more wins to push
us over the edge."
While Cardinal Coach Mike
Montgomery has done a fine job
in getting his players to perform
at a higher-than-expected level,
Cal Coach Lou Campanelli has
done the same thing. After losing

with a three-guard lineup, Cam
panelli solved that problem.
While earlier in the season
Hendrick was making waves by
making shots, he has cooled off a
bit. He is still second in the Pac-10
in field goal percentage, but hasn't
been scoring as much the past
month. So while he hasn't been
as effective, both Fisher and
senior point guard Keith Smith
have raised their games to new
levels.
Fisher has been scoring both
inside and outside lately and has

while Smith has been doing it all.
He leads the team in scoring and
assists and leads the league in
three-point accuracy at 48.7 per
cent. He earned Pac-10 Player-of
the-Week honors two weeks ago
after leading the Bears to victories
over both UCLA and USC in Los
Angeles.
"Keith Smith is a very good
player who makes everyone else
better," Montgomery said. "He
gets the ball to the three-point

shooters, penetrates well. . . .
They've got some real good
players but Smith's the guy who
makes everyone better. He's the
guy we have to contain."
Stanford will probably try to
work the ball inside to the team's
top two scorers, Adam Keefe and
Vlahov. Vlahov has been especially
hot of late after adjusting to his
new role as primarily a post-up
player.
This game should provide a
great glimpse of things to come
as these two teams will meet again
Sunday afternoon. The two will
likely also have a date a week
from Friday in the opening round
of the Pacific 10 Conference Tour
nament.
