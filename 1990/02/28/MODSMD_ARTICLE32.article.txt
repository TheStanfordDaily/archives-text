# NCAA-bound Bears hit Maples hardwood
## More than just cross-Bay rivalry at stake in national TV contest 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Before the start of the year,
some guy at ESPN decided they
should televise a basketball game
between Stanford and California.
At the time, it probably seemed
like a dumb idea: both teams were
expected to be in rebuilding years,
and while the game would prob
ably be close, it figured to be be
tween two teams with little chance
of having to forfeit spring break
for a postseason tournament.
Now, however, that guy looks
like a genius.
At Maples Pavilion tonight a
national television audience will
get a peek at two of the West's
most surprising teams. The
Golden Bears, after Leonard
Taylor and his school single
season record 649 points gradu
ated, have bounced back for their
third 20-win season in the last
four years. After going to the NIT
Tournament in 1986, '87 and '89,
the Bears look like NCAA tourney
material.
Meanwhile the host Cardinal
has had its share of ups and
downs this season, as would be
expected of a very young team.
But after six prominent players
graduated, scattering almost any
amount of ups amid the downs

seemed like it would be an ac
complishment. Stanford has cer
tainly managed that, bring a 16-9
record and hopes of an NIT berth
into tonight's contest.
With both teams looking to get
themselves noticed by the various
tournament selection committees,
and with national exposure pres
ent to help that cause, the long
time rivals will be even more in
tense tonight.
"It's an important game for us
as far as postseason goes," Stan
ford forward Andrew Vlahov said.
"They're going to look at what
happened at the end of the season.
We're on the bubble now and we
need a couple more wins to push
us over the edge."
While Cardinal Coach Mike
Montgomery has done a fine job
in getting his players to perform
at a higher-than-expected level,
Cal Coach Lou Campanelli has
done the same thing. After losing
Taylor and forward Matt Beeuw
saert to graduation, the Golden
Bears seemed pretty thin in the
front court.
But with junior forward Roy
Fisher continuing to improve,
with center Brian Hendrick
making a strong run at Pac-10
Freshman-of-the-Year honors and
