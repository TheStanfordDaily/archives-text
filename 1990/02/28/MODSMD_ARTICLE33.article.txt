### 
TONIGHT — Live on ESPN and channel 2 with an 8:30 p.m. tipoff in
Maples Pavilion. KZSU (90.1 FM) and KCBS (740 AM) will also broadcast
the game. The game is sold out.
RECORDS - Stanford (16-9, 8-8 in Pac-10 play), California (20-7, 11-5,
ranked No. 41 with one vote in the AP poll).
SERIES — California leads the series, which dates back to 1912, 128-84.
Last year the Cardinal handled the Bears in Maples Pavilion by a 97-71
score but fell in Berkeley for one of the squad's three Pac-10 losses.
GOLDEN BEAR UPDATE — Behind a three-guard lineup the Bears have
exceeded all expectations and appear to be a lock for their first NCAA
tournament berth since the team went all the way to the championship
game in 1960. They are led by senior guard Keith Smith, who has
emerged as one of the league's top players this year He is shooting 55
percent from the floor and averages 16.8 points
CARDINAt UPDATE — The Cardinal is assured of finishing no worse than
sixth in the Pac-10, meaning the team will not have to play on the first
day of the conference tournament. Tonight's game will be the final Maples
appearence for senior center Derek Bruton, unless the Cardinal plays
host to an NIT game The Gilroy, Calif., native is shooting .594 this
season and his career percentage of .534 is sixth all-time, 004 behind
No 5 Todd Llchtl
KEYS TO VICTORY — The Golden Bears love to launch the three, so
Stanford's perimeter players will be very important. If they can get in the
collective faces of the Bears' guards, Stanford has a good chance to
come out on top
