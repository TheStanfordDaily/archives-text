Ruggers roll over Gaels
Sending shock waves through its league, the
Stanford rugby team decimated St Mary's on
Sunday, handily beating the Gaels 32-6 to
raise its league record to 7-0,
The Cardinal set the pace from the begin
ning, scoring in the opening minutes of each
half. The Cardinal recorded three of its six
tries on outstanding individual efforts by Jason
Bucha, Simon Fleming-Wood and Ed Stevens.
In addition, Mark Davies, Rob Englehardt and
J.C. Schmeil each scored a try of their own.
In seven weeks of league play, Stanford has
outscored its opponents 183-33. In accomplish
ing this feat, the ruggers have scored 30 tries
while giving up only five.
Success is not the sole property of Stanford's
first team, however. According to John
McPherson, president of the rugby club,"The
younger, more inexperienced players of the
second and third teams have also played ex
tremely well. The club's future depends upon
these players, and they seem to play better
and better each week — they've been laying
a whoopin' on their opponents." The develop
mental squads also beat St. Mary's 15-11 and
38-0, respectively, and boast a combined record
of 9-1-1.
This weekend the Cardinal travels to
Berkeley.
Skiers make nationals
The Stanford women's ski team qualified
for nationals this weekend for the second year
in a row. The men's team narrowly missed
qualifying, falling short in a tie-breaker with
the University of Nevada at Reno by a deficit
of only eight seconds when time trials were
compiled from the entire weekend.
Of the ten teams competing, only the top
two make it to the 16 team national compe
tition. In addition, however, the top overall
skier whose team does not qualify is also in
vited to compete. Stanford senior Bill Derwin,
placing sth in the slalom and 10th in the
Giant Slalom, took sth overall, earning him
an invitation to nationals.
In the women's slalom, Pam Smul placed
4th, Cathy Petzold 11th and Courtney Hayes
15th, despite having fallen during her run.
These times resulted in a team finish of 3rd
place for the slalom.
In the G.S., Courtney Hayes finished 3rd
Pam Smul sth and Sarah Pike Bth to give
the Cardinal a team placing of 2nd, just good
enough to qualify the squad for nationals over
U.C. Davis.
In the men's slalom, Jake Doilney took 2nd
Bill Derwin sth and Chris Smith 17th to give
Stanford an auspicious 2nd place team finish.
However, the Cardinal's 3rd place team finish
in the G.S. allowed UNR to narrowly edge
them out of a national competition spot.
