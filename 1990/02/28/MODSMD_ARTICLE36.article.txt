# VonAppen leaves for job at Pitt
## 
### 
Although he thought he was
done for the year, Stanford foot
ball Coach Denny Green has to
go recruiting again.
After signing what was widely
considered one of the nation's top
classes of recruits two weeks ago,
Green now has to find an assis
tant coach. Defensive coordinator
and defensive line Coach Fred
vonAppen accepted the same po
sition at the University of Pitts
burgh earlier this week and will
leave Stanford.
He will work under Paul Hack

ett, who was named head coach
at Pitt prior to the Panthers' bowl
game two months ago. Hackett,
coincidentally, also boasts ties to
Stanford — he was a Cardinal
assistant coach in the eary 19705.
"Our Stanford football program
and staff will miss Fred vonAppen
but at the same time we want to
wish him the very best," Green
said. "We are all career coaches
in a professional sense and Fred
did what he felt was best for him
and his family. We have an excel
lent coaching staff right now at

Stanford University and as a
result of that I'm a believer on
promoting from within."
VonAppen was the man most
responsible for Stanford's defense
in 1989. The Cardinal played a
more aggressive defense last year
than in seasons past, which kept
the Cardinal in most games this
season even when the offense
struggled.
Green set no timetable for
naming a replacement for vonAp
pen.
