# Pounds of sweat
## Grapplers lose weight with unusual methods, zeal 
### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
Imagine losing 10 pounds in a
week. Now imagine losing that
same weight in eight hours. What
appears to be a drastic measure
for most people is called "making
weight" for Stanford wrestlers.
"The thing is you just have to
get mentally into it," Stanford
142-pounder James Dinette said.
"It's like the match before the
match. You just slap on about
three pairs of sweats, hop on the
bike, ride like hell, sweat, change
clothes and do it again."
The philosophy behind making
weight is simple. A wrestler wants
to be as light as possible, and
pound for pound as strong as he
can be. In order to do this a
wrestler relies on dehydrating his
body to reach the weight at which
he wants to compete. After weigh
ing in, he replenishes his body
with fluids, boosting himself back
to his normal weight.
"We have weigh-ins the day
before the meet," junior Steve
Yarbrough said. "Generally you
will be seven or eight pounds over

weight within an hour or two after
you weigh in. The whole idea is
you just want to touch that weight
and then gain up. You don't want
to maintain that low weight for
a long time."
For instance, a wrestler who
will compete in the 150-pound di
vision on a Friday meet will weigh
160 pounds the day before. After
a weight loss practice, he will lose
about eight pounds.
"We have weight loss practices
where we have two heaters in the
wrestling room, and we close all
the windows and we turn the
heaters on full blast," Yarbrough
said.
A wrestler will sweat off the
other two pounds by riding an
exercise bike, while wearing a
sweat suit made out of plastic.
After weighing in and making
weight, he immediately begins to
rehydrate his body in preparation
for the match on the following
day.
Sometimes wrestlers get crea
tive in the way they choose to
dehydrate themselves. When
junior Mark Constant was in high
school, he used a technique called

"the burrito treatment." He
would jump rope in the steam of
the pool balcony until could not
jump anymore. Then he would lay
down on a gymnastics mat, while
one of his teammates rolled him
up inside of it.
"Once you got used to a little
claustrophobia it wasn't too bad,"
he said.
Other wrestlers have tried to
take diarrhetics and anti-water
retention pills to reduce their body
weight. Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel does not allow his
wrestlers to use this and other
unsafe techniques to lose weight.
"The problem is that you
deplete your system of nutrients
that you need and it ends up af
fecting you performance," he said.
"It ends up showing up in how
you wrestle. You just don't wrestle
well."
In fact, Horpel only lets his
wrestlers wear plastic sweat suits
during practices on days in which
the wrestler will have to weigh in.
"Plastics is something we avoid
until the very last day because

a meet may involve extreme measures, as some competitors must lose multiple pounds in hours.
plastics can be unhealthy. You can
get too hot. If you overheat your
self too much then it crosses what
I consider to be this line of un
healthy weight loss."
Senior Ron Perry has mastered
weight loss. His teammates have
called Perry "The Sponge" be
cause of his unique ability to lose
over 10 pounds in a practice.
"I'm able to do it because I
keep everything in the right mind
set," he said. "I don't feel you
should alter you diet. You
shouldn't miss a meal."

Perry went on to say that losing
weight fits into the normal
routine of his life, and he does
not make any special allowances
of time to make weight.
The wrestlers who are not con
cerned with making weight are
the heavyweights. They can eat
and drink as much as they want
as long as their body weight does
not exceed 275 pounds.
"It's the only way to be," said
heavyweight Scott Palmbush.
When asked if he ever taunted
the wrestlers who were suffering
through a weight loss practice, he
replied, "Sometimes I'll go and
drink a glass of water right in
front of them, but that's pretty
cruel."
