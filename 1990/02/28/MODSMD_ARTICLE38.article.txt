Environmentalists
march on Capitol
Joining a nationwide student
campaign for forestry reform,
five Stanford students traveled
to Sacramento Monday to rally
at the state capital.
After a short march, approx
imately 60 California high
school and college students
gathered on the Capitol steps
for speeches, songs and skits.
Speakers included 21st District
Assemblyman Byron Sher and
environmental activists from
Earth First and Forests
Forever.
Monday's rallies in 48 states
represented the debut of the
national Student Environmen
tal Action Coalition, which sup
ports long-term planning for
ecologically responsible, "sus
tainable forestry," said Stan
ford freshman Flora Lu, the
Northern California coordina
tor for the Sacramento gather
ing.
The coalition formed last Oc
tober during "Threshold," an
environmental conference at
the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Two specific goals addressed
at the Sacramento rally were
the purchase and preservation

of Northern Californian old
grove timber forests and a
legislative ban on clearcutting
more than two acres of land.

Whizzes win big
A four-member team of Stan
ford computer wizards placed
third last week in an interna
tional computing competition.
Joining students from
around the globe, Alan Hu, Lei
Zhu, Carl Witty and Sean
Quinlan used their wits and
computer progamming skills in
a five-hour problem-solving
contest. The team had eight
problems to solve, ranging
from calculating the fastest
and least expensive air travel
across the country to divvying
up the winnings in a pro golf
tournament by using a complex
set of rules.
The top six teams all solved
five problems, so ranks were
determined by the time it took
to create the programs.
First and second place were
awarded to The University of
Otago, New Zealand and the
University of Maryland,
respectively. Harvard Univer
sity placed fourth.
