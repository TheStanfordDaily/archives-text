# Feeling at home at the helm
## New Law Review president has long history of leadership 
### Sherromba Barbee Staff writer 
She is the first black woman
elected president of the Stanford
Law Review. She served as station
manager of KZSU and as a resi
dent assistant for four consecutive
years.
Accomplishments seem to come
naturally to Shauna Jackson.
"I'm the type of person who
gets involved in organizations,"
explains Jackson, a second-year
law student who was also a Stan
ford undergraduate.
"Usually, once I get involved, I
see lots of ways the organization
can be improved," she add 9.
For Jackson, who describes her
self as a "dynamic, confident, cre
ative leader," leading the Law
Review is a natural outgrowth of
her other leadership activities.
Jackson has served as an RA
in Madera House, the American
Studies House, and in the Suites
this year and last year.
"I initially decided to be an RA
because I had the great benefit
of having an older sibling come
to Stanford as an undergraduate
and also as a law student," she
says.

One of her goals in being an
RA ha 9 "always been to be that
older sibling to students at Stan
ford. It's a benefit I had that I
want others to enjoy."
Jackson says her resident fel
lows in the American Studies
House, Law Prof. Miguel Mendez
and his wife Victoria, inspired her.
"They brought energy and intro
spection to the American Studies
House. They seemed to me very
ethical people. They cared about
how they treated other people."
As a first-year law student Jack
son worked as station manager at
KZSU, and last year she received
the Dean's Award for Service for
her contributions to the station.
Heading KZSU helped Jackson
develop her leadership skills.
"KZSU was a tremendous chal
lenge because it serves as an al
ternative avenue for music and
ideas. Because of that, it's always
a struggle to bring together stu
dents with a lot of different in
terests to work together for a
common station goal.
"That was the real attraction
for me, getting people to shift
from the 'I' focus to the 'us' focus.
Being an RA taught me how to
do that, and KZSl T gave me the

opportunity to apply that to a
business setting. KZSU is the best
experience I've had at Stanford
so far," Jackson says.
With her extensive experience
at KZSU, Jackson initially
thought of going directly into a
career in the media after gradu
ation. However, she decided to go
to law school because she regarded
it as "a very specialized education
that had a lot of power. And after
working in media, 1 saw that
knowledge was power. As trite as
that may sound, 1 believe that.
"I thought a legal education
would teach me a way of thinking
and a way of approaching tasks
that no other education would
teach me. I don't really conceive
of myself as only a lawyer. 1 see
myself as bringing my talents and
abilities to the field of law, and
using that profession to ac
complish substantive goals," she
says.
Jackson defines her goals as
"providing more opportunities for
people to make use of their own
skills and abilities. And, more spe
cifically, helping to clear the path
for more women and minorities

who want to practice the legal
profession and want to pursue
other professional careers.
"I had much career guidance
from many women in the profes
sion, and that's been tremen
dously helpful to me. I want to
be in the position one day to pro
vide that assistance to others."
For that reason, Jackson says
the attention given her appoint
ment is beneficial.
Jackson's main legal interests
are feminist theory, critical race
theory and constitutional theory
with an emphasis on the First
Amendment.
She has definite ideas about
how she would like to change the
Law Review. "I would like to see
the review get more aggressive
about obtaining the articles it
would like to publish. I think that
means being more effective at cul
tivating relationships with schol
ars," she says.
The Law Review staff's biggest
project is the symposium issue,
in which students and scholars
submit writings on a particular
topic selected by the review's
membership.
Jackson would prefer an issue
dealing with women of color and
the law, but she emphasizes that
the topic is chosen by the review
as a group, not simply by the
president.
Jackson admits that with all of
her activities, she does not have
much time for leisure. "But it
doesn't bother me, because I love
everything I'm involved with. I
wanted to learn, I wanted to ex
periment, I wanted to meet other
people, I wanted to grow. ... I
don't see everything I'm involved
with as work." .
