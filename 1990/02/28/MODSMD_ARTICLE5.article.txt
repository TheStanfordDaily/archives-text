# Sayonara, refunds?
## Senate proposes an end to givebacks 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
When ASSU Senate chair Ed
Sasaki promised on Feb. 7 several
constitutional amendments
drastically reforming special fees,
he was serious.
At last night's senate meeting,
Sasaki and Elections Commis
sioner Steve Krauss presented
four separate amendments, one of
them calling for the total elimi
nation of special fee refunds.
In other action, the senate ap
proved $7,500 for the Speakers
Bureau to bring Batman star Jack
Nicholson to campus. It also al
located $7,000 for an honorarium
to Abigail Van Buren, better
known as advice columnist Dear
Abby.
The senate took no action on
the proposed amendments be
cause ASSU Bylaws require that
amendments be submitted to the
senate at least one meeting in ad
vance of the vote. However, if ap
proved at the next senate meeting,
the amendments will go before the
student body in this spring's elec
tions.
While one amendment axes spe
cial fee refunds, it provides a 25
percent reduction in special fees
as well as an option for conscien
tious objectors to reallocate their
money.
Currently, freshmen and stu
dents who voted in the spring elec
tions can reclaim their special fees
each quarter.
Student groups are allowed to
factor into their budgets a 25 per
cent buffer to account for funds
lost to fee refunds. Last quarter,
however, students took away an
average of 30 percent of special
fees, leaving many groups wan
ting for cash.
The increase in students claim
ing their fee refunds prompted
the amendment.
Graduate senator Douglas Bone
said in an interview that the
amendment would be controver
sial but would most likely pass
the senate.
A second amendment calls for
general fees to be indexed to in
flation. Currently, students vote
each year to increase, maintain
or decrease general fees, which
fund the Program Board and the
Publications Board. In recent
years, because students have not
voted for an increase in general
fees, the senate has called upon
its "emergency reserves" to make
up the difference.
The third amendment asks that
groups seeking to be placed on
the special fee ballot not be re
quired to collect signatures, pro
vided that the group received
support from 50 percent of the
student body in the previous elec
tion and that the new budget is
no different from the old by a
factor of inflation plus 10 percent.
Currently, groups must collect
signatures from 10 percent of the
student body if they receive less
than a 60 percent student ap
proval in the previous election.
The fourth amendment de
mands a clarification of the spe
cial fee application process.
Bone thought the last three
would "likely pass."
