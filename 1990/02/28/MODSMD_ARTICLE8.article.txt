# Bridging the gap
## Peer service to offer minorities counselors of similar ethnicities 
### Edward Mun 
After a year of planning, the
Bridge is now offering peer coun
seling services that specialize in
helping blacks and Asian-
Americans.
Jackie Chang, who heads the
Asian-American counseling serv
ice, and Cory Booker, who is in
charge of the black counseling
service, created the program be
cause they both felt a counselor
would be able to relate better to
a counselee of the same ethnicity.
"The Bridge has been viewed
as a primarily white organiza
tion," said Booker.
According to Chang, former
Bridge peer counselors had some
difficulties relating to counselees
of different ethnic backgrounds.
For example, said Chang, a non-
Asian-American counselor would
find it hard to understand why
an Asian-American counselee
would be afraid to tell his parents
that "he didn't want to be pre
med."
Some of the topics which will
be covered in the black and Asian-
American counseling services are
interracial dating, academic stress
and stress resulting from trying
to live up to high expectations.
Currently, 13 people make up
the Asian-American peer counsel
ing staff, and seven people are on
the black peer counseling staff.
In the past, there was a peer
counseling group for black stu-

dents that was based at Ujamaa
House. But the program died out
for several reasons, including lack
of confidentiality and loss of mem
bers to graduation. Besides that
service, said Chang, there have
been no other peer counseling
groups that focused on students
of color.
The project began last winter
quarter after Booker attended
Chang's Bridge community peer
counseling class and asked if
anyone was interested in creating
a program to provide peer coun
seling for minority students.

of starting an Asian-American
peer counseling group earlier,
