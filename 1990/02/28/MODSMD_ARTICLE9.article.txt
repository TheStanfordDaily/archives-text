Storms hit Europe
TOWYN, Wales (AP) — Raging seas,
whipped up by a storm that has killed 52
people in Europe, surged through a shattered
sea wall and swamped homes in this coastal
village yesterday.
Rescue workers wearing rubber wet suits
and traveling in flat-bottom boats helped
evacuate 2,000 residents stranded by water
five feet deep.
Twenty-five people were hospitalized for
treatment of hypothermia, and some people
who ventured out to retrieve belongings from
their homes had to be rescued by helicopter
as the tide rose along the north coast of Wales.
The storm knocked a hole 2,000 feet long
in the century-old sea wall.
Mandela arrives in Zambia
LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) — Nelson Mandela
embraced exiled African National Congress
leaders and seven African presidents yesterday
and thanked Zambia "from the bottom of my
heart" for providing the ANC a headquarters
in exile.
Tens of thousands of Zambians thronged
the streets to welcome the 71-year-old South
African black leader, who was released Feb.
11 after 27 years in prison.
At a state banquet given by President Ken
neth Kaunda for 380 guests, Mandela praised
black African leaders for supporting the ANC,
and singled out Kaunda as "one of the greatest
heroes, not only of Africa, but of humankind."
Exxon suit filed
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice De
partment announced a five-count criminal in
dictment against Exxon Corp. and its shipping
subsidiary last night in the Exxon Valdez oil
spill that fouled Alaska's coast nearly a year
ago.
Officials said that if the giant oil company
is convicted on all counts brought by a federal
grand jury in Anchorage it could face criminal
fines of as much as $1.6 million.
In addition, the government could seek as
much as $700 million more in penalties under
a separate federal statute that allows recovery
of twice the amount of proven losses caused
by the spill, the worst in the nation's history,
the officials said.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told a
news conference that the indictment was pre
sented to the grand jury after a proposed plea
deal fell through. State officials had
strenuously objected to one proposed agree
ment.
Havel visits Moscow
MOSCOW (AP) — Czechoslovakia's presi
dent suggested yesterday a visit to Moscow
by Alexander Dubcek, the Communist Party
chief whose liberal "Prague Spring" was
crushed by the Red Army a generation before
Gorbachev's reforms.
In a meeting with Soviet lawmakers, Pres
ident Vaclav Havel said it could be part of an
exchange of parliamentary delegations, with
the Czechoslovak group led by Dubcek, who
now is president of Parliament.
As Communist Party chief in 1968, Dubcek
introduced reforms offensive to the Kremlin,
which opposed liberalization until Mikhail
Gorbachev became its leader in 1985. Soviet
tanks rolled into Prague in August.
