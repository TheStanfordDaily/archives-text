When does
a date
become a
crime?
It happens when a man forces a woman to have sex against her will.
And even when it involves college students, it's still considered a
criminal offense. A felony. Punishable by prison.
So if you want to keep a good time from turning into a bad one, try
to keep this in mind.
When does a date become a crime?
When she says "No." And he refuses to listen.
Against her will is against the law.
