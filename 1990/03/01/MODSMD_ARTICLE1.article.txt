## Black gays and lesbians celebrate their dual identity 
### Elizabeth Howton Senior staff writer 
When Corey Davis came to
Stanford, he chose to live in
Ujamaa House because he
didn't want to come out.
Davis' perception of the black
community as homophobic
made him think the black theme
house would be such a hostile
environment that he wouldn't
be able to express his gay
feelings openly.

But instead, Davis found the
black community here to be
"very supportive." Pretty soon,
he recalls, "I started coming out
all over the place," and this year
he is back in Ujamaa as an
openly gay resident assistant.
Davis, a junior, is one of a
growing number of black gay,
lesbian and bisexual students at
Stanford who are choosing to
be open about their sexual iden
tities. Many are active leaders
in both the black and gay com

munities.
While these students say it
remains problematic for others
to accept them as both black
and gay, they also speak of the
pride they feel in their dual cul
ture and history "You have two
communities to lean on, belong
to and be proud of," says Cedric
Brown, a graduate student in
education,

"Gay Liberation" meets black gay and lesbian liberation. Standing from left, Kevin Richardson,
Larry Shorter and Karl Knapper, and sitting from left, Jamal Morris, Toni Long, Corey Davis and
Cedric Douglas.
Strengthened connections
Last Thursday, as part of Black
Liberation Month, Ujamaa resi
dent Jamal Morris, a junior, held
a showing of a new film about
black gay men, "Tongues Untied,"
and a discussion with the film's
maker, Marlon Riggs.
The screening was unusual be
cause both the gay and black com
munities have traditionally paid
scant attention to the black gay
experience — yet this event was
cosponsored by Black Liberation
Month, Ujamaa and the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center.
With Morris and sophomore
Toni Long, a black lesbian, serv
ing as two of the five officers of
the gay community center,
cooperation between the two com
munities may increase.
Both Morris and Long have also
been active in the black commu
nity. Last year both lived in
Ujamaa and worked on The Real
News, the black community's
newspaper. Morris also belongs to
the Kuumba Dance Ensemble.
Long, Morris and Davis are
cited by other black gays and les
bians as heartening proof that the
black community is becoming
more open to homosexuality.
"Susan," a bisexual black grad
uate student who also was a Stan
ford undergraduate in the early
1980s, says she can only remem
ber one black person who was
both "out" — openly gay — and
active in the black community. "I
think things have changed," she
says.
Susan was active in the black
community as an undergraduate,
leading one of the smaller black
student organizations and "hang
ing out at Ujamaa." She remem
bers that to her, "it didn't seem
like it was OK to be gay."
One explanation for the in
creased acceptance may be the
amount of energy some gay stu
dents are devoting to the black
community, says 1983 graduate
Karl Knapper, a black gay man
who now works for the Martin

Luther King Papers Project.
Morris agrees: "If [black people]
just see you as gay and nothing
else," their reaction is more nega
tive than "if they see you being
active (in the black community).
There's a greater connection to
people, they get to know you bet
ter."
Unsegmented lives
Besides being a rare joint black
gay event, "Tongues Untied" was
a ground-breaking experience for
many Stanford black gay men. "I
was so amazed to see my experi
ence on the screen," says Knapper.
Brown says that during parts
of the movie, "I thought, 'Yeah,
that's me exactly.' " Like Riggs,
the film's narrator, Brown says
that he has become increasingly
disturbed by the scarcity and seg
regation of blacks in the gay com
munity.
One of the themes of "Tongues
Untied" is that, as Riggs puts it,
"Our lives are not segmented into
black and gay." Yet black gays say
that too often they do not find
their lives reflected in their com
munities — all the blacks seem
to be heterosexual and all the gays
white.
For "Samantha," a member of
a black sorority who has "thought
about possibly being lesbian but
never done anything about it,"
the separation of the two commu
nities is a barrier to exploring her
sexuality.
"The gay community is predom
inantly white, and if I were going
to identify with that I would lose
my niche, my home in the black
community," she says.
"Being black seems like a more
integral part of my being. Maybe
that's why I haven't explored the
possibility of my being a lesbian
... I don't know if I have the
courage."
But Morris says,"I don't feel
split or divided. Some people say
you have to make a choice, but
there's no black or white about it."
For Brown, bringing the iden
tities together has taken time.
"I'm going through a phase where
I'm merging the African-
American and gay identities," he
says. "They were separate en
tities. Now they're coming to

gether, and I'm trying to make
contact with other black gay men
because we have a lot in com
mon."
A relative bonanza
Trying to find other black gays
and lesbians at Stanford can be
frustrating, though. Low numbers
are a pressing and perennial prob
lem for black gay people here, but
this year, as Davis puts it, "there
seems to have been a bonanza of
black gay people — many more
than when I was a frosh" two
years ago.
The "bonanza" consists of a
larger population than at any time
in the past four years, but it is
still very small, especially for les
bians. Those interviewed say that
at Stanford, there are only about

20 gay and bisexual black men
and about five lesbian and bisex
ual black women who are at all
open about their sexuality.
For that reason, blacks who
want to date other blacks find it
close to impossible. Most say they
do not particularly prefer to do
so, but that it would be nice to
have the option.
There are "so few women out
in general, and they're all white
— if there are more black lesbians
out there, they can give me a
call!" jokes Long. She says that
right now, "race is not that big

an issue" in whom she dates, but
that "the woman I settle down
with will be a black woman."
Many black gays and lesbians
also feel a need for support and
role models — a need that re
mains unmet because of their
small numbers.
Long has had to look beyond
Stanford to find that kind of sup
port. In November, she attended
a gathering for black lesbians
sponsored by an off-campus or
ganization.
"It was a really positive expe
rience," she recalls. "I had never
been around so many black les
bians." From that group, Long
says she has gained "role models,
mentors and friends — mostly
older professionals, not students."

'I wouldn't feel
right turning my
back on a member
of my own race
just because we
disagreed [about
homosexuality], as
long as it's not im
pairing our rela
tionship.'
— Toni Long

Such mentor relationships are
also common in the gay commu
nity at large, sometimes because
people are rejected by their
families when they come out and
must seek to create alternative
"family" structures.
But without exception, black
gays and lesbians here said their
families had been supportive and
had come to accept them. "A black
family isn't going to disown you
— family is so important," says
Torrance Boone, a black gay
junior.

Unity and solidarity?
To some extent, the same ideal
of family solidarity prevails in the
black community here, despite
widespread feelings that the com
munity is homophobic.
Experience with the black com
munity varies by individual —
some find it more hostile to gays
than the mainstream culture,
while others vehemently deny that
it is.
And that comparison may itself
not be of much use; Riggs com
mented during his presentation
that "I expect more from the black
community. I don't necessarily ex
pect to be accepted by the main
stream white community."
As Larry Shorter, a black gay
fifth-year senior, puts it, "there
was more at stake" for him in
coming out to the black commu
nity. "I was afraid of losing a fun
damental source of support."
Knapper, who lived in Ujamaa
and was openly gay during his
years here, found that "coming
out to the black community was
difficult. They know you're gay,
but if you're quiet about it, you're
fine. If you 'flaunt it,' it's frowned
upon."
But for some, like Davis, Long
and Morris, being extremely open
with the black community about
their sexuality has proven to be
the best solution.
"I don't go around screaming,
'I'm gay,' but I express my opinion
on certain subjects," Morris ex
plains. "That gives people an op
portunity to talk about it . . . and
ask me 'stupid' questions."
For Long, race is a powerful
uniting factor. "There are [blackl
people who don't agree with me
[about homosexuality! . . . and we
speak to each other. I wouldn't
feel right turning my back on a
member of my own race just be
cause we disagreed, as long as it's
not impairing our relationship."
Others, like Susan, choose not
to let members of the black com
munity know about their sexual
identities. "It wouldn't be ac
cepted — the people who know
think it's kind of weird," she says.
Still others pick and choose the
situations in which they will be
out. Brown says,"I don't come
out in certain all-black situations
. . . just because I don't think cer
tain people would be comforta
ble. . . . Sometimes sexual tension
is assumed by some men."
Brown and others agree that
heterosexual black men generally
are more hostile toward homo

sexuality than heterosexual black
women. But they differ in how
homophobic they think black men
are — and whether they actually
are more hostile than men in gen
eral.
Gay 'obliviousness'
In the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community, the problem seems to
be less with overt racism than
with a lack of awareness of the
significance of different ethnic
cultures within the gay culture.
Black gays and lesbians say the
gay community at Stanford is
overwhelmingly white and male
in the attendance of most of its
events, and that in itself is part
of the problem.
It's a problem of "discrimina
tion based on obliviousness," says
black gay junior Kevin Richard
son, who has been involved in or
ganizing gay events. "There is
little to no recognition of the fact
that there are few ethnic minority
gays at socials and dances . . .
[and] no realization that students
of color might have different in
terests or perspectives.
"One of the excuses is " 'We've
got to please our audience,' which
just reinforces the racism," Rich
ardson says. In addition, he says,
"University administrators think
every gay person is white."
But Knapper says he does see
"a lot more black people at the
dances and involved in the gay
community" ihan when he was a
student.
Boone says,"I don't have the
feeling I could connect" with
Stanford's gay community, and
"I'm apprehensive about confid
ing in them. I don't think people
could relate to the subtleties of
my experience."
Many black gays find more con
genial gay communities in San
Francisco and Oakland. "In
general if you're gay at Stanford,
but especially if you're black and
gay," Richardson says, "you need
to have a car so you can have a
decent social life."
Morris says, "One of the
reasons I'm so open about fboth
black and gay issues] is that I
want to make it easier for people
who come afterward to be them
selves."
And indeed, Richardson says
that for him, coming out to the
black community last year was
easier "because Corey [Davis] took
the heat his freshman year. ... A
lot of [black] people had already
dealt with it."

When Corey Davis came to
Stanford, he chose to live in
Ujamaa House because he
didn't want to come out.
Davis' perception of the black
community as homophobic
made him think the black theme
house would be such a hostile
environment that he wouldn't

still very small, especially for les
bians. Those interviewed say that
at Stanford, there are only about

20 gay and bisexual black men
and about five lesbian and bisex
ual black women who are at all
open about their sexuality.
For that reason, blacks who
want to date other blacks find it
close to impossible. Most say they
do not particularly prefer to do
so, but that it would be nice to
have the option.
There are "so few women out
in general, and they're all white
— if there are more black lesbians
out there, they can give me a
call!" jokes Long. She says that
right now, "race is not that big

an issue" in whom she dates, but
that "the woman I settle down
with will be a black woman."
Many black gays and lesbians
also feel a need for support and
role models — a need that re
mains unmet because of their
small numbers.
Long has had to look beyond
Stanford to find that kind of sup
port. In November, she attended
a gathering for black lesbians
sponsored by an off-campus or
ganization.
"It was a really positive expe
rience," she recalls. "I had never
been around so many black les
bians." From that group, Long
says she has gained "role models,
mentors and friends — mostly
older professionals, not students."

'I wouldn't feel
right turning my
back on a member
of my own race
just because we
disagreed [about
homosexuality], as
long as it's not im
pairing our rela
tionship.'
— Toni Long

Such mentor relationships are
also common in the gay commu
nity at large, sometimes because
people are rejected by their
families when they come out and
must seek to create alternative
"family" structures.
But without exception, black
gays and lesbians here said their
families had been supportive and
had come to accept them. "A black
family isn't going to disown you
— family is so important," says
Torrance Boone, a black gay
junior.

Unity and solidarity?
To some extent, the same ideal
of family solidarity prevails in the
black community here, despite
widespread feelings that the com
munity is homophobic.
Experience with the black com
munity varies by individual —
some find it more hostile to gays
than the mainstream culture,
while others vehemently deny that
it is.
And that comparison may itself
not be of much use; Riggs com
mented during his presentation
that "I expect more from the black
community. I don't necessarily ex
pect to be accepted by the main
stream white community."
As Larry Shorter, a black gay
fifth-year senior, puts it, "there
was more at stake" for him in
coming out to the black commu
nity. "I was afraid of losing a fun
damental source of support."
Knapper, who lived in Ujamaa
and was openly gay during his
years here, found that "coming
out to the black community was
difficult. They know you're gay,
but if you're quiet about it, you're
fine. If you 'flaunt it,' it's frowned
upon."
But for some, like Davis, Long
and Morris, being extremely open
with the black community about
their sexuality has proven to be
the best solution.
"I don't go around screaming,
'I'm gay,' but I express my opinion
on certain subjects," Morris ex
plains. "That gives people an op
portunity to talk about it . . . and
ask me 'stupid' questions."
For Long, race is a powerful
uniting factor. "There are [blackl
people who don't agree with me
[about homosexuality! . . . and we
speak to each other. I wouldn't
feel right turning my back on a
member of my own race just be
cause we disagreed, as long as it's
not impairing our relationship."
Others, like Susan, choose not
to let members of the black com
munity know about their sexual
identities. "It wouldn't be ac
cepted — the people who know
think it's kind of weird," she says.
Still others pick and choose the
situations in which they will be
out. Brown says,"I don't come
out in certain all-black situations
. . . just because I don't think cer
tain people would be comforta
ble. . . . Sometimes sexual tension
is assumed by some men."
Brown and others agree that
heterosexual black men generally
are more hostile toward homo

sexuality than heterosexual black
women. But they differ in how
homophobic they think black men
are — and whether they actually
are more hostile than men in gen
eral.
Gay 'obliviousness'
In the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community, the problem seems to
be less with overt racism than
with a lack of awareness of the
significance of different ethnic
cultures within the gay culture.
Black gays and lesbians say the
gay community at Stanford is
overwhelmingly white and male
in the attendance of most of its
events, and that in itself is part
of the problem.
It's a problem of "discrimina
tion based on obliviousness," says
black gay junior Kevin Richard
son, who has been involved in or
ganizing gay events. "There is
little to no recognition of the fact
that there are few ethnic minority
gays at socials and dances . . .
[and] no realization that students
of color might have different in
terests or perspectives.
"One of the excuses is " 'We've
got to please our audience,' which
just reinforces the racism," Rich
ardson says. In addition, he says,
"University administrators think
every gay person is white."
But Knapper says he does see
"a lot more black people at the
dances and involved in the gay
community" ihan when he was a
student.
Boone says,"I don't have the
feeling I could connect" with
Stanford's gay community, and
"I'm apprehensive about confid
ing in them. I don't think people
could relate to the subtleties of
my experience."
Many black gays find more con
genial gay communities in San
Francisco and Oakland. "In
general if you're gay at Stanford,
but especially if you're black and
gay," Richardson says, "you need
to have a car so you can have a
decent social life."
Morris says, "One of the
reasons I'm so open about fboth
black and gay issues] is that I
want to make it easier for people
who come afterward to be them
selves."
And indeed, Richardson says
that for him, coming out to the
black community last year was
easier "because Corey [Davis] took
the heat his freshman year. ... A
lot of [black] people had already
dealt with it."

When Corey Davis came to
Stanford, he chose to live in
Ujamaa House because he
didn't want to come out.
Davis' perception of the black
community as homophobic
made him think the black theme
house would be such a hostile
environment that he wouldn't
be able to express his gay
feelings openly.

But instead, Davis found the
black community here to be
"very supportive." Pretty soon,
he recalls, "I started coming out
all over the place," and this year
he is back in Ujamaa as an
openly gay resident assistant.
Davis, a junior, is one of a
growing number of black gay,
lesbian and bisexual students at
Stanford who are choosing to
be open about their sexual iden
tities. Many are active leaders
in both the black and gay com

munities.
While these students say it
remains problematic for others
to accept them as both black
and gay, they also speak of the
pride they feel in their dual cul
ture and history "You have two
communities to lean on, belong
to and be proud of," says Cedric
Brown, a graduate student in
education,

"Gay Liberation" meets black gay and lesbian liberation. Standing from left, Kevin Richardson,
Larry Shorter and Karl Knapper, and sitting from left, Jamal Morris, Toni Long, Corey Davis and
Cedric Douglas.
Strengthened connections
Last Thursday, as part of Black
Liberation Month, Ujamaa resi
dent Jamal Morris, a junior, held
a showing of a new film about
black gay men, "Tongues Untied,"
and a discussion with the film's
maker, Marlon Riggs.
The screening was unusual be
cause both the gay and black com
munities have traditionally paid
scant attention to the black gay
experience — yet this event was
cosponsored by Black Liberation
Month, Ujamaa and the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center.
With Morris and sophomore
Toni Long, a black lesbian, serv
ing as two of the five officers of
the gay community center,
cooperation between the two com
munities may increase.
Both Morris and Long have also
been active in the black commu
nity. Last year both lived in
Ujamaa and worked on The Real
News, the black community's
newspaper. Morris also belongs to
the Kuumba Dance Ensemble.
Long, Morris and Davis are
cited by other black gays and les
bians as heartening proof that the
black community is becoming
more open to homosexuality.
"Susan," a bisexual black grad
uate student who also was a Stan
ford undergraduate in the early
1980s, says she can only remem
ber one black person who was
both "out" — openly gay — and
active in the black community. "I
think things have changed," she
says.
Susan was active in the black
community as an undergraduate,
leading one of the smaller black
student organizations and "hang
ing out at Ujamaa." She remem
bers that to her, "it didn't seem
like it was OK to be gay."
One explanation for the in
creased acceptance may be the
amount of energy some gay stu
dents are devoting to the black
community, says 1983 graduate
Karl Knapper, a black gay man
who now works for the Martin

Luther King Papers Project.
Morris agrees: "If [black people]
just see you as gay and nothing
else," their reaction is more nega
tive than "if they see you being
active (in the black community).
There's a greater connection to
people, they get to know you bet
ter."
Unsegmented lives
Besides being a rare joint black
gay event, "Tongues Untied" was
a ground-breaking experience for
many Stanford black gay men. "I
was so amazed to see my experi
ence on the screen," says Knapper.
Brown says that during parts
of the movie, "I thought, 'Yeah,
that's me exactly.' " Like Riggs,
the film's narrator, Brown says
that he has become increasingly
disturbed by the scarcity and seg
regation of blacks in the gay com
munity.
One of the themes of "Tongues
Untied" is that, as Riggs puts it,
"Our lives are not segmented into
black and gay." Yet black gays say
that too often they do not find
their lives reflected in their com
munities — all the blacks seem
to be heterosexual and all the gays
white.
For "Samantha," a member of
a black sorority who has "thought
about possibly being lesbian but
never done anything about it,"
the separation of the two commu
nities is a barrier to exploring her
sexuality.
"The gay community is predom
inantly white, and if I were going
to identify with that I would lose
my niche, my home in the black
community," she says.
"Being black seems like a more
integral part of my being. Maybe
that's why I haven't explored the
possibility of my being a lesbian
... I don't know if I have the
courage."
But Morris says,"I don't feel
split or divided. Some people say
you have to make a choice, but
there's no black or white about it."
For Brown, bringing the iden
tities together has taken time.
"I'm going through a phase where
I'm merging the African-
American and gay identities," he
says. "They were separate en
tities. Now they're coming to

gether, and I'm trying to make
contact with other black gay men
because we have a lot in com
mon."
A relative bonanza
Trying to find other black gays
and lesbians at Stanford can be
frustrating, though. Low numbers
are a pressing and perennial prob
lem for black gay people here, but
this year, as Davis puts it, "there
seems to have been a bonanza of
black gay people — many more
than when I was a frosh" two
years ago.
The "bonanza" consists of a
larger population than at any time
in the past four years, but it is
still very small, especially for les
bians. Those interviewed say that
at Stanford, there are only about

20 gay and bisexual black men
and about five lesbian and bisex

could relate to the subtleties of
my experience."
Many black gays find more con
genial gay communities in San
Francisco and Oakland. "In
general if you're gay at Stanford,
but especially if you're black and
gay," Richardson says, "you need
to have a car so you can have a
decent social life."
Morris says, "One of the
reasons I'm so open about fboth
black and gay issues] is that I
want to make it easier for people
who come afterward to be them
selves."
And indeed, Richardson says
that for him, coming out to the
black community last year was
easier "because Corey [Davis] took
the heat his freshman year. ... A
lot of [black] people had already
dealt with it."

When Corey Davis came to
Stanford, he chose to live in
Ujamaa House because he
didn't want to come out.
Davis' perception of the black
community as homophobic
made him think the black theme
house would be such a hostile
environment that he wouldn't
be able to express his gay
feelings openly.

But instead, Davis found the
black community here to be
"very supportive." Pretty soon,
he recalls, "I started coming out
all over the place," and this year
he is back in Ujamaa as an
openly gay resident assistant.
Davis, a junior, is one of a
growing number of black gay,
lesbian and bisexual students at
Stanford who are choosing to
be open about their sexual iden
tities. Many are active leaders
in both the black and gay com

munities.
While these students say it
remains problematic for others
to accept them as both black
and gay, they also speak of the
pride they feel in their dual cul
ture and history "You have two
communities to lean on, belong
to and be proud of," says Cedric
Brown, a graduate student in

Al Green — Daily
"Gay Liberation" meets black gay and lesbian liberation. Standing from left, Kevin Richardson,
Larry Shorter and Karl Knapper, and sitting from left, Jamal Morris, Toni Long, Corey Davis and
Cedric Douglas.
Strengthened connections
Last Thursday, as part of Black
Liberation Month, Ujamaa resi
dent Jamal Morris, a junior, held
a showing of a new film about
black gay men, "Tongues Untied,"
and a discussion with the film's
maker, Marlon Riggs.
The screening was unusual be
cause both the gay and black com
munities have traditionally paid
scant attention to the black gay
experience — yet this event was
cosponsored by Black Liberation
Month, Ujamaa and the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community
Center.
With Morris and sophomore
Toni Long, a black lesbian, serv
ing as two of the five officers of
the gay community center,
cooperation between the two com
munities may increase.
Both Morris and Long have also
been active in the black commu
nity. Last year both lived in
Ujamaa and worked on The Real
News, the black community's
newspaper. Morris also belongs to
the Kuumba Dance Ensemble.
Long, Morris and Davis are
cited by other black gays and les
bians as heartening proof that the
black community is becoming
more open to homosexuality.
"Susan," a bisexual black grad
uate student who also was a Stan
ford undergraduate in the early
1980s, says she can only remem
ber one black person who was
both "out" — openly gay — and
active in the black community. "I
think things have changed," she
says.
Susan was active in the black
community as an undergraduate,
leading one of the smaller black
student organizations and "hang
ing out at Ujamaa." She remem
bers that to her, "it didn't seem
like it was OK to be gay."
One explanation for the in
creased acceptance may be the
amount of energy some gay stu
dents are devoting to the black
community, says 1983 graduate
Karl Knapper, a black gay man
who now works for the Martin

Luther King Papers Project.
Morris agrees: "If [black people]
just see you as gay and nothing
else," their reaction is more nega
tive than "if they see you being
active (in the black community).
There's a greater connection to
people, they get to know you bet
ter."
Unsegmented lives
Besides being a rare joint black
gay event, "Tongues Untied" was
a ground-breaking experience for
many Stanford black gay men. "I
was so amazed to see my experi
ence on the screen," says Knapper.
Brown says that during parts
of the movie, "I thought, 'Yeah,
that's me exactly.' " Like Riggs,
the film's narrator, Brown says
that he has become increasingly
disturbed by the scarcity and seg
regation of blacks in the gay com
munity.
One of the themes of "Tongues
Untied" is that, as Riggs puts it,
"Our lives are not segmented into
black and gay." Yet black gays say
that too often they do not find
their lives reflected in their com
munities — all the blacks seem
to be heterosexual and all the gays
white.
For "Samantha," a member of
a black sorority who has "thought
about possibly being lesbian but
never done anything about it,"
the separation of the two commu
nities is a barrier to exploring her
sexuality.
"The gay community is predom
inantly white, and if I were going
to identify with that I would lose
my niche, my home in the black
community," she says.
"Being black seems like a more
integral part of my being. Maybe
that's why I haven't explored the
possibility of my being a lesbian
... I don't know if I have the
courage."
But Morris says,"I don't feel
split or divided. Some people say
you have to make a choice, but
there's no black or white about it."
For Brown, bringing the iden
tities together has taken time.
"I'm going through a phase where
I'm merging the African-
American and gay identities," he
says. "They were separate en
tities. Now they're coming to

gether, and I'm trying to make
contact with other black gay men
because we have a lot in com
mon."
A relative bonanza
Trying to find other black gays
and lesbians at Stanford can be
frustrating, though. Low numbers
are a pressing and perennial prob
lem for black gay people here, but
this year, as Davis puts it, "there
seems to have been a bonanza of
black gay people — many more
than when I was a frosh" two
years ago.
The "bonanza" consists of a
larger population than at any time
in the past four years, but it is
still very small, especially for les
bians. Those interviewed say that
at Stanford, there are only about

20 gay and bisexual black men
and about five lesbian and bisex
ual black women who are at all
open about their sexuality.
For that reason, blacks who
want to date other blacks find it
close to impossible. Most say they
do not particularly prefer to do
so, but that it would be nice to
have the option.
There are "so few women out
in general, and they're all white
— if there are more black lesbians
out there, they can give me a
call!" jokes Long. She says that
right now, "race is not that big

an issue" in whom she dates, but
that "the woman I settle down
with will be a black woman."
Many black gays and lesbians
also feel a need for support and
role models — a need that re
mains unmet because of their
small numbers.
Long has had to look beyond
Stanford to find that kind of sup
port. In November, she attended
a gathering for black lesbians
sponsored by an off-campus or
ganization.
"It was a really positive expe
rience," she recalls. "I had never
been around so many black les
bians." From that group, Long
says she has gained "role models,
mentors and friends — mostly
older professionals, not students."

'I wouldn't feel
right turning my
back on a member
of my own race
just because we
disagreed [about
homosexuality], as
long as it's not im
pairing our rela
tionship.'
— Toni Long

Such mentor relationships are
also common in the gay commu
nity at large, sometimes because
people are rejected by their
families when they come out and
must seek to create alternative
"family" structures.
But without exception, black
gays and lesbians here said their
families had been supportive and
had come to accept them. "A black
family isn't going to disown you
— family is so important," says
Torrance Boone, a black gay
junior.

Unity and solidarity?
To some extent, the same ideal
of family solidarity prevails in the
black community here, despite
widespread feelings that the com
munity is homophobic.
Experience with the black com
munity varies by individual —
some find it more hostile to gays
than the mainstream culture,
while others vehemently deny that
it is.
And that comparison may itself
not be of much use; Riggs com
mented during his presentation
that "I expect more from the black
community. I don't necessarily ex
pect to be accepted by the main
stream white community."
As Larry Shorter, a black gay
fifth-year senior, puts it, "there
was more at stake" for him in
coming out to the black commu
nity. "I was afraid of losing a fun
damental source of support."
Knapper, who lived in Ujamaa
and was openly gay during his
years here, found that "coming
out to the black community was
difficult. They know you're gay,
but if you're quiet about it, you're
fine. If you 'flaunt it,' it's frowned
upon."
But for some, like Davis, Long
and Morris, being extremely open
with the black community about
their sexuality has proven to be
the best solution.
"I don't go around screaming,
'I'm gay,' but I express my opinion
on certain subjects," Morris ex
plains. "That gives people an op
portunity to talk about it . . . and
ask me 'stupid' questions."
For Long, race is a powerful
uniting factor. "There are [blackl
people who don't agree with me
[about homosexuality! . . . and we
speak to each other. I wouldn't
feel right turning my back on a
member of my own race just be
cause we disagreed, as long as it's
not impairing our relationship."
Others, like Susan, choose not
to let members of the black com
munity know about their sexual
identities. "It wouldn't be ac
cepted — the people who know
think it's kind of weird," she says.
Still others pick and choose the
situations in which they will be
out. Brown says,"I don't come
out in certain all-black situations
. . . just because I don't think cer
tain people would be comforta
ble. . . . Sometimes sexual tension
is assumed by some men."
Brown and others agree that
heterosexual black men generally
are more hostile toward homo

sexuality than heterosexual black
women. But they differ in how
homophobic they think black men
are — and whether they actually
are more hostile than men in gen
eral.
Gay 'obliviousness'
In the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community, the problem seems to
be less with overt racism than
with a lack of awareness of the
significance of different ethnic
cultures within the gay culture.
Black gays and lesbians say the
gay community at Stanford is
overwhelmingly white and male
in the attendance of most of its
events, and that in itself is part
of the problem.
It's a problem of "discrimina
tion based on obliviousness," says
black gay junior Kevin Richard
son, who has been involved in or
ganizing gay events. "There is
little to no recognition of the fact
that there are few ethnic minority
gays at socials and dances . . .
[and] no realization that students
of color might have different in
terests or perspectives.
"One of the excuses is " 'We've
got to please our audience,' which
just reinforces the racism," Rich
ardson says. In addition, he says,
"University administrators think
every gay person is white."
But Knapper says he does see
"a lot more black people at the
dances and involved in the gay
community" ihan when he was a
student.
Boone says,"I don't have the
feeling I could connect" with
Stanford's gay community, and
"I'm apprehensive about confid
ing in them. I don't think people
could relate to the subtleties of
my experience."
Many black gays find more con
genial gay communities in San
Francisco and Oakland. "In
general if you're gay at Stanford,
but especially if you're black and
gay," Richardson says, "you need
to have a car so you can have a
decent social life."
Morris says, "One of the
reasons I'm so open about fboth
black and gay issues] is that I
want to make it easier for people
who come afterward to be them
selves."
And indeed, Richardson says
that for him, coming out to the

I'm merging the African-
American and gay identities," he
says. "They were separate en
tities. Now they're coming to

gether, and I'm trying to make
contact with other black gay men
because we have a lot in com
mon."
A relative bonanza
Trying to find other black gays
and lesbians at Stanford can be
frustrating, though. Low numbers
are a pressing and perennial prob
lem for black gay people here, but
this year, as Davis puts it, "there
seems to have been a bonanza of
black gay people — many more
than when I was a frosh" two
years ago.
The "bonanza" consists of a
larger population than at any time
in the past four years, but it is
still very small, especially for les
bians. Those interviewed say that
at Stanford, there are only about

20 gay and bisexual black men
and about five lesbian and bisex
ual black women who are at all
open about their sexuality.
For that reason, blacks who
want to date other blacks find it
close to impossible. Most say they
do not particularly prefer to do
so, but that it would be nice to
have the option.
There are "so few women out
in general, and they're all white
— if there are more black lesbians
out there, they can give me a
call!" jokes Long. She says that
right now, "race is not that big

an issue" in whom she dates, but
that "the woman I settle down
with will be a black woman."
Many black gays and lesbians
also feel a need for support and
role models — a need that re
mains unmet because of their
small numbers.
Long has had to look beyond
Stanford to find that kind of sup
port. In November, she attended
a gathering for black lesbians
sponsored by an off-campus or
ganization.
"It was a really positive expe
rience," she recalls. "I had never
been around so many black les
bians." From that group, Long
says she has gained "role models,
mentors and friends — mostly
older professionals, not students."

'I wouldn't feel
right turning my
back on a member
of my own race
just because we
disagreed [about
homosexuality], as
long as it's not im
pairing our rela
tionship.'
— Toni Long

Such mentor relationships are
also common in the gay commu
nity at large, sometimes because
people are rejected by their
families when they come out and
must seek to create alternative
"family" structures.
But without exception, black
gays and lesbians here said their
families had been supportive and
had come to accept them. "A black
family isn't going to disown you
— family is so important," says
Torrance Boone, a black gay
junior.

Unity and solidarity?
To some extent, the same ideal
of family solidarity prevails in the
black community here, despite
widespread feelings that the com
munity is homophobic.
Experience with the black com
munity varies by individual —
some find it more hostile to gays
than the mainstream culture,
while others vehemently deny that
it is.
And that comparison may itself
not be of much use; Riggs com
mented during his presentation
that "I expect more from the black
community. I don't necessarily ex
pect to be accepted by the main
stream white community."
As Larry Shorter, a black gay
fifth-year senior, puts it, "there
was more at stake" for him in
coming out to the black commu
nity. "I was afraid of losing a fun
damental source of support."
Knapper, who lived in Ujamaa
and was openly gay during his
years here, found that "coming
out to the black community was
difficult. They know you're gay,
but if you're quiet about it, you're
fine. If you 'flaunt it,' it's frowned
upon."
But for some, like Davis, Long
and Morris, being extremely open
with the black community about
their sexuality has proven to be
the best solution.
"I don't go around screaming,
'I'm gay,' but I express my opinion
on certain subjects," Morris ex
plains. "That gives people an op
portunity to talk about it . . . and
ask me 'stupid' questions."
For Long, race is a powerful
uniting factor. "There are [blackl
people who don't agree with me
[about homosexuality! . . . and we
speak to each other. I wouldn't
feel right turning my back on a
member of my own race just be
cause we disagreed, as long as it's
not impairing our relationship."
Others, like Susan, choose not
to let members of the black com
munity know about their sexual
identities. "It wouldn't be ac
cepted — the people who know
think it's kind of weird," she says.
Still others pick and choose the
situations in which they will be
out. Brown says,"I don't come
out in certain all-black situations
. . . just because I don't think cer
tain people would be comforta
ble. . . . Sometimes sexual tension
is assumed by some men."
Brown and others agree that
heterosexual black men generally
are more hostile toward homo

sexuality than heterosexual black
women. But they differ in how
homophobic they think black men
are — and whether they actually
are more hostile than men in gen
eral.
Gay 'obliviousness'
In the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community, the problem seems to
be less with overt racism than
with a lack of awareness of the
significance of different ethnic
cultures within the gay culture.
Black gays and lesbians say the
gay community at Stanford is
overwhelmingly white and male
in the attendance of most of its
events, and that in itself is part
of the problem.
It's a problem of "discrimina
tion based on obliviousness," says
black gay junior Kevin Richard
son, who has been involved in or
ganizing gay events. "There is
little to no recognition of the fact
that there are few ethnic minority
gays at socials and dances . . .
[and] no realization that students
of color might have different in
terests or perspectives.
"One of the excuses is " 'We've
got to please our audience,' which
just reinforces the racism," Rich
ardson says. In addition, he says,
"University administrators think
every gay person is white."
But Knapper says he does see
"a lot more black people at the
dances and involved in the gay
community" ihan when he was a
student.
Boone says,"I don't have the
feeling I could connect" with
Stanford's gay community, and
"I'm apprehensive about confid
ing in them. I don't think people
could relate to the subtleties of
my experience."
Many black gays find more con
genial gay communities in San
Francisco and Oakland. "In
general if you're gay at Stanford,
but especially if you're black and
gay," Richardson says, "you need
to have a car so you can have a
decent social life."
Morris says, "One of the
reasons I'm so open about fboth
black and gay issues] is that I
want to make it easier for people
who come afterward to be them
selves."
And indeed, Richardson says
that for him, coming out to the
black community last year was
easier "because Corey [Davis] took
the heat his freshman year. ... A
lot of [black] people had already
dealt with it."
