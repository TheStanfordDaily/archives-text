## Black gays and lesbians celebrate their dual identity

When Corey Davis came to
Stanford, he chose to live in
Ujamaa House because he
didn't want to come out.
Davis' perception of the black
community as homophobic
made him think the black theme
house would be such a hostile
environment that he wouldn't
be able to express his gay
feelings openly.

But instead, Davis found the
black community here to be
"very supportive." Pretty soon,
he recalls, "I started coming out
all over the place," and this year
he is back in Ujamaa as an
openly gay resident assistant.
Davis, a junior, is one of a
growing number of black gay,
lesbian and bisexual students at
Stanford who are choosing to
be open about their sexual iden
tities. Many are active leaders
in both the black and gay com

munities.
While these students say it
remains problematic for others
to accept them as both black
and gay, they also speak of the
pride they feel in their dual cul
ture and history "You have two
communities to lean on, belong
to and be proud of," says Cedric
Brown, a graduate student in
education,
