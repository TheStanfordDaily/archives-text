Soviets adopt land law
MOSCOW (AP) — Legislators overwhelm
ingly approved a bill yesterday that allows
Soviets to acquire land and bequeath it to
their children, a major modification of decades
of state control of land.
The law, however, stops short of legalizing
full private ownership of property by strictly
forbidding the sale of land. Under the new
law, plots only can be leased, and the lease
prices will be set by the state.
Shuttle in orbit
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - Space
shuttle Atlantis, aloft at last on a secret mil
itary mission after five launch delays, orbited
the globe yesterday in a public silence that
NASA officials said meant all was well.
Atlantis blasted off with five military
astronauts and a cargo believed to be a $500
million spy satellite aLJ-L5l a.m., its 700-foot
column of fire visible for hundreds of miles.
It was NASA's sixth attempt at launching the
100-ton spaceship for the mission, one short
a record for the most shuttle postponements.
End to attacks
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — President
Daniel Ortega declared a halt to attacks on
the Contras yesterday and called again on the
United States to help dismantle the rebel force.
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
who joined Ortega on Tuesday in asking the
U.S.-backed Contras to put down their arms,
praised his move as a step forward.
"The causes of civil war in Nicaragua have
disappeared," Mrs. Chamorro told a news con
ference. "There is no reason for war."
Battling abortion ban
ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Hundreds of
abortion-rights activists yesterday exchanged
taunts with a small group of anti-abortionists
outside the Capitol amid intense lobbying over
a bill that would ban most abortions in the
state.
The bill, which would prohibit abortions for
"birth-control reasons," was drafted as model
legislation by the National Right-To-Life Com
mittee in the wake of last summer's U.S. Su
preme Court decision that gave states more
leeway to restrict abortions.
Kaifu gains power
TOKYO (AP) — Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu, a "clean" but junior member who led
his governing party to a crucial election victory,
is showing new assertiveness at home.
With powerful party elders watching him
for any misstep, he also is looking to a suc
cessful summit with President Bush this week
end to further strengthen his position.
Promising to do more to ease trade frictions,
Kaifu said Wednesday, "I think Japan-U.S.
relations are extremely important and I will
work to keep them from worsening economi
cally."
