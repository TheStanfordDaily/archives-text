SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Presi
dent Bush telephoned Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday for a
"very constructive" discussion on the
political shakeup in Nicaragua. Later,
Bush praised Gorbachev as a bold
leader advocating daring reforms.
In what was believed to be only their
third telephone conversation, the two
leaders also discussed issues of Euro
pean security, including German
reunification, and preparations for a
superpower summit this summer, ac
cording to U.S. accounts and the Soviet
news agency Tass.
Bush called the Soviet president
before setting out on a cross-country
campaign trip, with stops at New
York's Staten Island and San Fran
cisco, and a weekend meeting in Palm
Springs, Calif., with Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
Bush was in San Francisco to help
raise $750,000 at a fund-raising dinner
for Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, who
is running for governor. It was Bush's
second trip to California in less than
a month.
"From Moscow to Managua, change
is in the air," Bush said in a speech
at the Wilson fund-raiser.
Bush said, "The world has under
gone another upheaval, but this time
there is no war."
"We have seen a bold Soviet leader
initiate daring reforms. We have seen

a playwright . . . Vaclav Havel move
from prison to the presidential palace
in Czechoslovakia. We have seen both
the Berlin Wall and a Romanian dic
tatorship tumble into ruins," Bush
said.
"And I think it's fair to say the day
of the dictator is over."
"The mood of the day back then —
confrontation, rhetorical overkill, ten
sions bordering on hostility. Today's
talk was so different — no polemics."
"In the Revolution of '89, an idea
overcame armies and tanks, and that
idea is democracy," Bush said.
"This has been true in the East.
Now it is becoming true throughout
the Western Hemisphere, first in
Panama after Operation Just Cause
(the U.S. invasion to topple Manuel
Antonio Noriega) and now, at long
last, for the brave people of Nicara
gua," Bush said.
"And how could we ask for more?"
Bush discussed his conversation
with Gorbachev as he flew to New
York to campaign for Republican
Susan Molinari, who is hoping to
succeed her father, former Rep. Guy
Molinari, in Congress.
Bush said he assured Gorbachev he
was committed to moving ahead on
arms control negotiations under a
timetable set up by Secretary of State
James Baker and Soviet Foreign Min
ister Eduard Shevardnadze.
