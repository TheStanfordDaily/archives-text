# Los Angeles area rocked by 5.5 earthquake

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A strong
earthquake rocked a wide area of
Southern California from San Diego
to Santa Barbara yesterday, breaking
windows, toppling books from shelves
and causing minor structural damage.
There were no immediate reports of
injuries from the quake, which swayed
a high-rise building in Las Vegas, 230
miles northeast of Los Angeles.
It measured 5.5 on the Richter scale
and was centered three miles north
west of Upland, a city about 40 miles

east of Los Angeles, said Hall Daily
of the California Institute of Technol
ogy in Pasadena.
The U.S. Geological Survey gave the
same magnitude, but a preliminary
reading by University of California
Seismographic Stations at Berkeley
put the magnitude at 6.0. Such mea
suring differences are common. A
quake of magnitude 5.5 is capable of
causing considerable damage.
"It was felt over a very large area
and it was quite sharp," said Chuck

Young of the state Office of Emergency
Services.
At Harvey Mudd College in Pomona,
about five miles from the epicenter,
the quake broke a window and toppled
wall-mounted bookcases in the presi
dent's office, said Burt Tashman, at
the school.
"I'm on the second story and boy,
I tell you, things started shaking,"
Tashman said. "Glass fell from the
wall of the president's office and fell

ail over the place. Pictures fell. The
pane broke. That sort of thing."
It was the strongest earthquake in
California since the 7.1-magnitude
quake struck the San Francisco Bay
region Oct. 17, reawakening fears
throughout the state of a massive
quake scientists predict in coming
years. The Oct. 17 earthquake, which
hit as the first game of the World
Series was about to begin, killed 67
people, injured about 3,000 and did
$7 billion in damage.
