## In need of protocol 
### 
The University must
clearly define and
condemn acts of rape

IN THE PAST eight years, there
have been only two cases of
sexual assault reported to the
Judicial Affairs Office. Yet, accord
ing to last spring's Rape Education
Project survey, 29 percent of
female undergraduates and 10 per
cent of male undergraduates at
Stanford have been coerced into
sexual activity against their will.
The tiny percentage of reported
rapes says something about Stan
ford's ability to handle and prose
cute sexual assault cases. And that
something is not good.
Stanford lacks a formal defini
tion of rape, a formal protocol for
reporting and prosecution of rape
cases and a properly trained staff
to handle the sensitive issue of
sexual assault. Since victims do not
know where to go or to whom to
talk, most remain silent.
A formal University statement
condemning sexual assault should
be issued from the Office of the
President. Rape should be specified
as a violation of the Fundamental
Standard and treated as such.
Freshman Orientation Week
should include a program on sexual
assault, and the University must
give its full support to student
groups that provide campuswide
programs and information on rape.
In some areas, groups such as Rape
Education Project, Heightened Ed
ucation on Acquaintance Rape and
Students Against Sexism are al
ready far ahead of the University
in providing services.
In addition to raising the level
of awareness in the community,
the University should establish a
clear and accessible avenue for vie-

Tims of sexual assault.
In their booklet "Sexual Assault
on Campus: What Colleges Can
Do," Aileen Adams and Gail Abar
banel outline a series of recom
mendations for a comprehensive
victim assistance program, includ
ing:
• A formal, written protocol for
responding to sexual assault cases,
• Availability of a victim advo
cate to act as a liaison between the
victim and Judicial Affairs,
• Sensitivity training for officials
who will be working with victims,
and
• Coordination with the Stan
ford Police Department.
Finally, the judicial process
should be re-examined and restruc
tured to enable it to respond to
sexual assault cases effectively and
sensitively.
The University's Task Force on
Sexual Assault last month released
an interim report outlining three
options for rape victims: the Stan
ford Police Department, the Mid-
Peninsula YWCA Rape Crisis Cen
ter and the Stanford Rape Re
sponse Group.
When the Task Force's final
report is finished, the University
must seriously consider the recom
mendations that are made and
should work closely with already
established student groups.
A formal protocol for reporting
and prosecuting cases of sexual as
sault cannot be established imme
diately. Unfortunately, acts of rape
continue.
Victims should be encouraged by
the University and the Stanford
community to come forward with
their experiences. Although many
flaws still exist in the system, they
have been made public and efforts
have begun to eradicate them.
If no cases are tried, the Uni
versity will not be able to deter
mine the best possible protocol and
this violent crime will continue to
go unnoticed and unpunished.
