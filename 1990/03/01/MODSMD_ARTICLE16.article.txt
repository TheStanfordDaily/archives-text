Fundamental Standard a paradox in official policy

STANFORD'S OFFICIAL policy on
sexual harassment says that "the
University is concerned and
prepared to take action to prevent and
correct such behavior, and that individ
uals who engage in such behavior are
subject to discipline."
This appears to be a fairly straight
forward statement. It would appear to
instill some confidence in a person
that, were she or he to be sexually
assaulted, the University would at least
take sufficient action after the fact to
punish the offender.
However, the very next line of the
policy reads as follows: "Conduct be
tween students is governed by the
Fundamental Standard." The Funda
mental Standard does not even define
sexual assault, and most certainly
proposes no policy to deal with it.

To entertain such a paradox in offi
cial policy is not only ludicrous but
dangerous to those persons whom it
affects, namely all students who are
sexually assaulted by other students.
An extensive article in The Daily on
Feb. 26 documented an actual and
terrifying scenario that was the direct
result of the irresponsible and un
professional nature of the University's
sexual harassment policy.
A woman was raped and she re
ported the incident to Judicial Affairs,
rightfully expecting that some action
against her assailant be taken. Instead,
she was told that she had not been
raped and that there would be no
further investigation into the matter.
What qualifies University officials to
judge whether or not an individual has
been raped?

The California Penal Code, Title 9,
section 261, defines rape as an act of
sexual intercourse "where a person is
prevented from resisting by any in
toxicating or anesthetic substance, or
any controlled substance, administered
by or with the privity of the accused."
The language is plain.
Yet, Sally Cole, the Judicial Affairs
officer to whom the assailed woman
reported her case, had the audacity to
dismiss the incident as not a rape
"because of an alcohol-induced memory
lapse by the alleged victim." This most
assuredly indicates a lack of common
sense.
The gravity of the situation, how
ever, derives from the fact that it
legitimately questions any University
official's ability to make a judgement
call in the case of a rape.

Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
speaks of acquaintance rape by saying,
"We are probably dealing with the fact
that a person genuinely feels used,
hurt, abused." Then he poses the inane
question: "But does that in and of
itself constitute rape?"
Lyons is scrutinizing the emotions of
the victim and ignoring the act itself.
No, feeling hurt and abused does not
in and of itself constitute rape, but
how can anyone rationalize such emo
tions when a person is feeling them
because she has been raped?
We must address the act of rape,
justly, responsibly and empathetically.
Then, just maybe, the emotions result
ing from it can begin to take care of
themselves.
