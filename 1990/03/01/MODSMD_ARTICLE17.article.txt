# Anti-Semitic threat in Soviet Union must be addressed
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Moscow Writers'
Union one month ago, according to an
article in the Feb. 2 New York Times,
"a man who identified himself as Smir
nov shouted: 'Comrade Jews leave the
hall! We're the masters of the country!
The pogrom will come in a few
months!' M
Anti-Semitism is not new in the
Soviet Union. Indeed the covertly anti-
Semitic government policies of the
Brezhnev era may soon give way to
overtly racist violence. Ominous state
ments like Smirnov's threaten a return
to the days of the Czars.
The article also stated: "In
Leningrad, members of Pamyat and
other nationalist groups have been

reported openly picketing a subway
station, shouting anti-Semitic slogans
and threatening to harm Jews. Some
Jewish residents contend the activates
are quietly sanctioned by local Commu
nist leaders they say are interested in
expoiting anti-Semitism and the
nationalist issue as a way to shore up
the local party's eroding popular sup
port."
The members of Stanford Hillel's
World Jewry committee hope everyone
in the Stanford community shares our
deep concern about anti-Semitic activi
ties. A pogrom has been threat
ened for May 5. Everyone is welcome
to join our efforts to prevent this
threat from coming to fruition. Please
contact us through the offices of Stan
ford Hillel.
