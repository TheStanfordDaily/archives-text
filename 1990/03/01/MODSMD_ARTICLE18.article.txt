# Chamorro's victory and 30,000 deaths result of U.S. effort
## 
### 
Jimmy Carter and 2,000 other
foreign observers spent the weekend
tramping up and down the streets of
Managua.
If they had been genuinely interested
in fair and democratic elections they
would have gone to Washington, D.C.
Sunday's elections were indeed a
great victory, but a victory not for
Nicaragua but for the CIA and the
Marines and for Ronald Reagan,
George Bush, George Shultz, Oliver
North, John Poindexter, Robert Mac
farlane and other other members of
"the team" whose hands are stained
with the blood of 30,000 dead Nicara
guans.
For 10 years, two American adminis
trations have pumped hundreds of

millions of dollars into an effort to
subvert the government.
Since 1985, an economic embargo
has attempted to strangle Nicaragua
into submission. The actions of the
United States have been condemned
before the World Court and by most
Latin American nations. When even
Congress had enough, the Reagan-Bush
administration went underground and
precipitated the most notorious scandal
in modern American history.
It is the great tragedy of our time
that as one Eastern European nation
after another shakes free of the im
perial domination of the Soviet Union,
the United States continues to add
client states.
Let us wish Chamorro well, but let
us not forget that no less than Manuel
Noriega, she is a product of the White
House and the CIA — bought and paid
for, signed, sealed and delivered.
