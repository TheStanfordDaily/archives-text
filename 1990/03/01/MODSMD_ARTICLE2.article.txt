# Nurses threaten strike
## 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
After more than a month of
unsuccessful contract negotia
tions, the union representing
nurses at Stanford Hospital filed
a 12-day strike notice yesterday,
just hours before the nurses' con
tract expired at midnight.
Hospital President Kenneth
Bloem confirmed that the hospital
received the strike notice from the
the Committee for Recognition of
Nursing Achievement, which rep
resents about 1,400 nurses.
Bloem, however, had no further
comment.
The nurses will vote Monday
on whether to strike, according
to union spokesperson Donalda
Dunnett.
Two years ago, the union
threatened to strike when its con
tract expired but then reached a
settlement with the hospital eight
days before the strike deadline.
The main points of the current
disagreement between the hospi
tal and the union focus on the
amount of a salary increase and
potential cuts that would lower
the nurse-patient ratio, Dunnett
said.
Talks on the contract began
Jan. 18, but the two sides failed
to come to agreement on several
issues. As a result, Dorothy Chris
tensen, a federal mediator, joined
the negotiations last Thursday at
the hospital's request "in an at
tempt to move things along," ac
cording to Priscilla Wheeler, staff
counsel and chief negotiator for
the hospital.
Christensen is from the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Serv
ice, a federal agency which has
legal authority in health care bar
gaining.
On Tuesday, the union an
nounced that it would not meet
with the hospital anymore, but
would negotiate through the
mediator, according to Wheeler.

"Our feeling is that [the
hospital] is unwilling to talk to
us," Dunnett said.
"We didn't seem to be making
progress," Wheeler said. She de
scribed the current difficulties as
"all economics."
The union initially demanded a
15 percent salary increase the
first year of the two-year contract
and 13 percent the second year,
but it has since lowered the pro
posal to 13 percent the first year
and 12 percent the second.
Wheeler said the original
demand would amount to almost
a 40 percent increase in the hospi
tal's current nursing costs. The
newer proposal is not a significant
reduction, Wheeler said.
She added that the union's ap
proach ignores the actual salary
dollar amounts that the hospital
is proposing.
The hospital'B latest offer for
wage increases for the first year
ranges from approximately 4 per
cent at the very top of the current
scale to 9 and 10 percent at other
levels. It proposes a 4 percent
across-the-board increase for all
levels the second year.
According to Wheeler, although
Stanford has been a leader in
nurses' wages, the salary struc
ture has eroded over time and the
lower end of the wage scale needs
some attention.
Dunnett said the hospital is
trying to compress the current
scale and allow the newest nurses
to get the highest wage increase.
"The percentage of wage raise is
smallest for the most experienced.
None of the nurses feels that it
is fair," she said. The union wants
the same rate for everybody, she
added.
"We want to be competitive in
recruitment and retention at the
entry and mid-point levels,"
Wheeler explained.
A second major point of conten
tion is the issue of nurse-patient
ratio. Dunnett said the union

The hospital and
the union disagree
over salaries and
potential staff cuts
that would lower
the nurse-patient
ratio.

wants a contract that will keep
the ratio at a reasonable level.
"The hospital will be using
more nursing assistants and tech
nicians in the future. Our basic
fear here is that patient care is
being compromised," Dunnett
said.
"We need to continue to attract
nurses to the hospital. It is to the
hospital's and patients' benefit to
maintain the nurses here, because
the nurses are becoming more
specialized and need a lot of
money to train," she added.
In addition, "a good percentage
of proposals are still on the table
and are not being discussed,"
Dunnett said. For example, the
union asked for a formal proce
dure for nurses to file objections
against assignments which com
promise patient safety. "They said
we can take it to the (monthly)
nursing conference. We did that
for two years and it hasn't been
effective," she said.
Today, union president Sue
Weinstein will inform the
mediator about the strike notice.
Because an agreement has not
been reached, contractual obliga
tions such as paid time for union
officers ended with the expired
contracts, but staff and relief
nurses will continue to receive
wages and benefits and there will
be no change in day-to-day work
procedures, said Wheeler.
