## Abortion is a social reality 
### 
EVEN WITHOUT the benefit of sci
entific confirmation, I would ven
ture to say that if one cup of sugar
were to be measured for every mistake
humankind has ever made, it would be
possible to create a colossal meringue
that would stretch from San Francisco
to Pluto.
Since the consequences of humankind's
mistakes are not quite as pleasing as a
meringue may be, we should be particu
larly grateful for the existence of
"remedies." Although a remedy may not
always eradicate the mistake completely,
it often serves to alleviate the conse
quences. Therein lies the beauty of Band-
Aids, erasers and White-out.
But unequivocally more important
than the existence of such products is
the individual's right to use them to cor
rect the mistake in question.
And here is really where the heart of
the abortion issue lies. Eighteen years
after Roe v. Wade, a woman's right to
an abortion, while still barely intact, has
become significantly eroded.
As a result of the Supreme Court's
ruling on Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services, states have already imposed nu
merous restrictions which make obtain
ing an abortion nearly impossible for
many women. The anti-abortion rhetoric
of angry picketers and sentiments such
as "Abortion is an issue between a man
and his god" (Sen. Steven Symms, R-
Idaho) abound. A woman's right to cor
rect her mistake remains tenuous at best.
It may seem harsh to use the word
"mistake." But in a nation in which 1
million teens get pregnant every year, in
which 23 percent of all children are born

illegitimate, there can be no dispute that
many pregnancies certainly weren't
planned.
Even most anti-abortion activists agree
that abortion should be allowed in cases
of rape. In this case, the woman was
wronged; the resulting pregnancy can be
nothing but a horrible mistake.
Yet, what of the individual who wasn't
raped, who consciously engaged in sexual
activity and later realized she'd made a
mistake? It seems illogical and even cruel
that a woman should have to "bear the
consequences of her actions" to an extent
to which her life is ruined and society is
burdened.
For abortion is an issue that affects
not only the individual in question, but
the society as well. We have a social ob
ligation to prevent the proliferation of
unwanted births, an increase in high
school-dropout mothers and back-alley
abortions.
Our conscience also cannot ignore the
fact that the bulk of the negative social
effects are hurled upon the lower-class
single woman who cannot afford to fly
to another state in which abortion is not
restricted. For the affluent, a safe abor
tion will always be an option; for the
poor, restrictions on abortion will mean
two dubious "options": carrying a preg
nancy to term or resorting to the "home
remedy."
The horrors of the pre-Roe days — the
coat hangers, bleach and knitting needles,
back-alley abortions — only illustrate the
fact that abortion exists, legal or illegal.
Its dangerous, latter form can only be
detrimental to the pregnant woman.
The reality of abortion mocks the idea

of legislation as a deterrent to unwanted
pregnancies, revealing the all-too-wishful
thinking of Dr. John Willke, President of
the National Right to Life Committee,
when he foolishly claims, "Once the law
tells us that abortion is illegal, there will
be far fewer pregnancies to abort."
Perhaps the ineffectiveness of the
"law" stems from the fact that the
morality being legislated attempts to an
swer absolutely a question with no uni
versal answer: when does life begin? Does
it begin at the moment of conception? Is
it the moment a zygote becomes a fetus?
When the fetus' heart starts to beat?
When the fetus takes on the semblance
of a human being? When a doctor says
so? When a priest says so?
The question of life is clearly a question
with no universal answer. It certainly
isn t a question for the law to answer
absolutely. Answers, if any, will be on a
varied individual level, which is precisely
why abortion should be an individual
choice.
To supplant or even curb that choice
with a dubious moral dictum, to outlaw
what has become social reality, is to close
our eyes to that colossal meringue of
human fallibility.

It may seem harsh to use the word
"mistake." But in a nation in which 1
million teens get pregnant every year, in
which 23 percent of all children are born

illegitimate, there can be no dispute that
many pregnancies certainly weren't
planned.
Even most anti-abortion activists agree
that abortion should be allowed in cases
of rape. In this case, the woman was
wronged; the resulting pregnancy can be
nothing but a horrible mistake.
Yet, what of the individual who wasn't
raped, who consciously engaged in sexual
activity and later realized she'd made a
mistake? It seems illogical and even cruel
that a woman should have to "bear the
consequences of her actions" to an extent
to which her life is ruined and society is
burdened.
For abortion is an issue that affects
not only the individual in question, but
the society as well. We have a social ob
ligation to prevent the proliferation of
unwanted births, an increase in high
school-dropout mothers and back-alley
abortions.
Our conscience also cannot ignore the
fact that the bulk of the negative social
effects are hurled upon the lower-class
single woman who cannot afford to fly
to another state in which abortion is not
restricted. For the affluent, a safe abor
tion will always be an option; for the
poor, restrictions on abortion will mean
two dubious "options": carrying a preg
nancy to term or resorting to the "home
remedy."
The horrors of the pre-Roe days — the
coat hangers, bleach and knitting needles,
back-alley abortions — only illustrate the
fact that abortion exists, legal or illegal.
Its dangerous, latter form can only be
detrimental to the pregnant woman.
The reality of abortion mocks the idea

of legislation as a deterrent to unwanted
pregnancies, revealing the all-too-wishful
thinking of Dr. John Willke, President of
the National Right to Life Committee,
when he foolishly claims, "Once the law
tells us that abortion is illegal, there will
be far fewer pregnancies to abort."
Perhaps the ineffectiveness of the
"law" stems from the fact that the
morality being legislated attempts to an
swer absolutely a question with no uni
versal answer: when does life begin? Does
it begin at the moment of conception? Is
it the moment a zygote becomes a fetus?
When the fetus' heart starts to beat?
When the fetus takes on the semblance
of a human being? When a doctor says
so? When a priest says so?
The question of life is clearly a question
with no universal answer. It certainly
isn t a question for the law to answer
absolutely. Answers, if any, will be on a
varied individual level, which is precisely
why abortion should be an individual
choice.
To supplant or even curb that choice
with a dubious moral dictum, to outlaw
what has become social reality, is to close
our eyes to that colossal meringue of
human fallibility.
