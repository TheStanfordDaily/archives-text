## J. Charles Ferraro University reporting process is insensitive to rape victims 
### 
IT IS WITH great concern that I
write this letter. If the facts it is
based on are true, there is a great
insensitivity on campus toward the
rape victim. I am basing this letter on
the facts as I read them in the article
"Reporting the Reality."
The article states that Sally Cole
"says she does not know why the
numbers of formally reported rapes are
so low." Let me try to explain. A rape
victim is under enormous pressure not
to report the rape. She faces an in
sensitive law enforcement/judicial sys
tem — "they will never find him and
if they do they will let him go."
All her prior sex life, totally irrele
vant to the incident, will be paraded
for all to see. There is also societal
pressure — "She asked for it."
She faces peer pressure — "he is
really a nice guy." She has a lot of
self-doubt — "did I do something to
cause this?"
She'll fear retaliation from the rapist
and his friends — it is a fear for her
life. And in acquaintance/date rape,

especially when he was a good friend,
she will hesitate because she does not
want to ruin his life. To put this in
the context of the college campus, she
will be told, and may sometimes feel,
that by reporting the rape she will
ruin his future by getting him kicked
out of school and will make him lose
his investment.
To this, I respond with the same
phrase that is so often used on the
victim, "HE asked for it."
With all due respect, Sally Cole, if
you do not fully understand why the
number of reported rapes is so low,
you should resign immediately before
others have to face an insensitive
Judicial Affairs Officer who does not
understand what they are going
through. Resign, before another rape
victim gets raped by Judicial Affairs.
Sally Cole also seems to question the
validity of reporting the rape in the
first place. She states that "the basic
solution to the problem of sexual
assault . . . will not be found through
University or external judicial actions."

While I agree with this, I see great
value in University and external judi
cial actions for both educational and
deterrent purposes. We need to know
that a rapist will be treated like any
other criminal.
There is only one word that can
describe Cole's setting up the meeting
between the rape victim and her as
sailant "to work things out together"
— callous. Would she also suggest that
a burglary victim meet with the bur
glar to work things out? Or better yet,
that the loved ones of a murder victim
meet with the murderer to work
things out?
Next in line is Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. He states that
the victim of acquaintance rape is
feeling "used, hurt, abused .. . land]
can identify who is responsible, but
that doesn't necessarily make it a
crime."
If she was raped, it IS a crime.
Lyons also questions the validity of
reporting the rape "because the initial
need to report may not be a need to

Rape is the one crime in
which the victim is further
victimized by society.

report or redress the issue judicially
but to get advice." The victim should
not be forced to report the rape, but
there is no reason why she should not
report the rape and seek advice con
currently.
Rape is the one crime in which the
victim is further victimized by society.
It is the one crime where the victim is
expected to physically resist the as
sailant. And that is ridiculous. Anyone
who has experienced the fear of being
the victim of a crime that could end in
death, knows that fear paralyzes.
I know. I was mugged at knifepoint,
and the only thing I could think of
was not to make him angry. There was
no desire to resist. I did not report it
either. Why? I did not get a good look

at him and did not believe he would
be found. For months afterward, I
lived in fear. Fear would sweep
through me whenever I heard steps
behind me.
Rape is worse, much worse, than a
simple mugging. Rape destroys the
victim's self-confidence. In many cases,
it destroys her relationships, her love
life. She lives in fear and does not
know if she can trust the men around
her.
Suzanne O'Brien said it right: "whet
her or not a woman has been raped
according to the legal definition, she
should be treated with sensitivity and
as if she has been raped." She adds,
"If a woman feels she's been raped,
then for her, she's been raped."
Everyone, especially men, need to
learn that when a woman says "no,"
she means NO. Men, if she says "no,"
STOP. If she wants it, she will say
yes.

I know. I was mugged at knifepoint,
and the only thing I could think of
was not to make him angry. There was
no desire to resist. I did not report it
either. Why? I did not get a good look

at him and did not believe he would
be found. For months afterward, I
lived in fear. Fear would sweep
through me whenever I heard steps
behind me.
Rape is worse, much worse, than a
simple mugging. Rape destroys the
victim's self-confidence. In many cases,
it destroys her relationships, her love
life. She lives in fear and does not
know if she can trust the men around
her.
Suzanne O'Brien said it right: "whet
her or not a woman has been raped
according to the legal definition, she
should be treated with sensitivity and
as if she has been raped." She adds,
"If a woman feels she's been raped,
then for her, she's been raped."
Everyone, especially men, need to
learn that when a woman says "no,"
she means NO. Men, if she says "no,"
STOP. If she wants it, she will say
yes.

IT IS WITH great concern that I
write this letter. If the facts it is
based on are true, there is a great
insensitivity on campus toward the
rape victim. I am basing this letter on
the facts as I read them in the article
"Reporting the Reality."
The article states that Sally Cole
"says she does not know why the
numbers of formally reported rapes are
so low." Let me try to explain. A rape
victim is under enormous pressure not
to report the rape. She faces an in
sensitive law enforcement/judicial sys
tem — "they will never find him and
if they do they will let him go."
All her prior sex life, totally irrele
vant to the incident, will be paraded
for all to see. There is also societal
pressure — "She asked for it."
She faces peer pressure — "he is
really a nice guy." She has a lot of
self-doubt — "did I do something to
cause this?"
She'll fear retaliation from the rapist
and his friends — it is a fear for her
life. And in acquaintance/date rape,

especially when he was a good friend,
she will hesitate because she does not
want to ruin his life. To put this in
the context of the college campus, she
will be told, and may sometimes feel,
that by reporting the rape she will
ruin his future by getting him kicked
out of school and will make him lose
his investment.
To this, I respond with the same
phrase that is so often used on the
victim, "HE asked for it."
With all due respect, Sally Cole, if
you do not fully understand why the
number of reported rapes is so low,
you should resign immediately before
others have to face an insensitive
Judicial Affairs Officer who does not
understand what they are going
through. Resign, before another rape
victim gets raped by Judicial Affairs.
Sally Cole also seems to question the
validity of reporting the rape in the
first place. She states that "the basic
solution to the problem of sexual
assault . . . will not be found through
University or external judicial actions."

While I agree with this, I see great
value in University and external judi
cial actions for both educational and
deterrent purposes. We need to know
that a rapist will be treated like any
other criminal.
There is only one word that can
describe Cole's setting up the meeting
between the rape victim and her as
sailant "to work things out together"
— callous. Would she also suggest that
a burglary victim meet with the bur
glar to work things out? Or better yet,
that the loved ones of a murder victim
meet with the murderer to work
things out?
Next in line is Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. He states that
the victim of acquaintance rape is
feeling "used, hurt, abused .. . land]
can identify who is responsible, but
that doesn't necessarily make it a
crime."
If she was raped, it IS a crime.
Lyons also questions the validity of
reporting the rape "because the initial
