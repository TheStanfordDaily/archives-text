## Cardinal lets 16-point lead slip away, falls to Bears 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Last night was supposed to be
a chance for the Cardinal basket
ball team to all-but-clinch a post
season berth with a nationally
televised victory over California.
Unfortunately for most of the
7,500 fans in attendance, however,
it was the Golden Bears that did
the clinching. Cal effectively en
sured themselves of their first
NCAA tournament appearence
since 1960 with a 66-63 victory
over the Cardinal last night in
Maples Pavilion. The loss puts a
serious damper on Stanford's NIT
hopes.

| Cardinal 63

Stanford appeared to be in con
trol with a 16-point lead early in
the second half. But the Bears
outscored the Cardinal 34-15 in
the last 14:19, making 13 of their
final 18 shots — 72.2 percent.
With the score tied, Bear fresh
man Brian Hendrick hit a one
handed turn-around jumper from
12 feet out and was fouled with
nine seconds left. He hit the free
throw to put the Bears up 66-63
and Marcus Lollie hurried the ball
upcourt. Lollie took a desperation
shot from inside the three-point
line that hit nothing but air, but
Roy Fisher landed out of bounds
with the defensive rebound.
The Cardinal thus had another
chance with one second remain
ing, but Lollie's inbounds pass was
deflected by Hendrick and time
expired.
Going into the regular-season
finale at Cal Sunday, the Cardinal
is now 16-10 overall, 8-9 in the
Pacific 10 Confernce. The Golden
Bears are 21-7 overall, 12-5 in
the Pac-10.
"That game was ours to be won
and we did a miserable job of
doing it when it was there to be
won," Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "I'm pretty disap
pointed. They were there to be

buried and they just hung around
long enough and we let them back
in there. .. . We made absolutely
no plays in the last 10 minutes."
Adam Keefe, who had 20 points
and eight rebounds for the Car
dinal, hit two free throws to give
Stanford a 48-32 lead with 14:19
to play. But the Cardinal would
go nearly four minutes before
scoring again. After an 11-0 run,
momentum seemed to be com
pletely in Cal's court, but Bear
Coach Lou Campanelli got himself
called for a technical.
The two technical free throws
and an 18-footer from Lollie got
the Cardinal going, but a few mo
ments later the Golden Bears
heated up again. Cal is second in
the Pacific 10 Conference in three
point field goal percentage and
Keith Smith proved why, hitting
a trey to cut it the Stanford ad
vantage to seven.
John Patrick countered with a
three-pointer for the Cardinal,
but Ryan Drew had a pair of
threes to win the pot and make
it 57-53.
Cal forward Roy Fisher and
Smith sandwiched a Keefe layin
with buckets of their own to make
it 59-57. Andrew Vlahov missed
a pair of free throws and a Fisher
two-footer tied the game. Keefe
then missed two free throws and
Smith made two to put the Bears
ahead for the first time since the
score was 19-17 in the first half.
Deshon Wingate hit a layup off
a spin move to tie it but Smith
hit another pair of free throws.
Wingate again answered, this
time with a fast break layup but
Vlahov missed the front end of a
one-and-one with 47 seconds left.
Cal then ran down the clock and
Hendrick hit his shot.
"That was a gut check for us,"
Smith said. "That was really
tough for us. We didn't know if
we could make it (back) or not."
While Cal passed its gut check,
the Cardinal certainly didn't, es
pecially from the free throw line.
The team hit 8 of 18 (.444) for
the game, and only made 4 of 11
(.364) in the second half. The Car

Deshon Wingate peeks around California point guard Keith Smith last night at Maples.
Wingate and a sellout crowd didn't like what they saw, as the Bears snuck away
with the win 66-63.
dinal frontline of Keefe, Vlahov
and Wingate were a combined 4
of 14, for a whopping 28.6 percent.
"That's our seventh conference
road win," Campanelli said, "and
I think that's our seventh time
we've had to come back in the
second half. . . . We felt we could
come back at halftime. We got in
a bit of a rut there but the press
took its toll and we were able to
come back "

Last night was supposed to be
a chance for the Cardinal basket
ball team to all-but-clinch a post
season berth with a nationally
televised victory over California.
Unfortunately for most of the
7,500 fans in attendance, however,
it was the Golden Bears that did
the clinching. Cal effectively en
sured themselves of their first
NCAA tournament appearence
since 1960 with a 66-63 victory
over the Cardinal last night in
Maples Pavilion. The loss puts a
serious damper on Stanford's NIT
hopes.

Stanford appeared to be in con
trol with a 16-point lead early in
the second half. But the Bears
outscored the Cardinal 34-15 in
the last 14:19, making 13 of their
final 18 shots — 72.2 percent.
With the score tied, Bear fresh
man Brian Hendrick hit a one
handed turn-around jumper from
12 feet out and was fouled with
nine seconds left. He hit the free
throw to put the Bears up 66-63
and Marcus Lollie hurried the ball
upcourt. Lollie took a desperation
shot from inside the three-point
line that hit nothing but air, but
Roy Fisher landed out of bounds
with the defensive rebound.
The Cardinal thus had another
chance with one second remain
ing, but Lollie's inbounds pass was
deflected by Hendrick and time
expired.
Going into the regular-season
finale at Cal Sunday, the Cardinal
is now 16-10 overall, 8-9 in the
Pacific 10 Confernce. The Golden
Bears are 21-7 overall, 12-5 in
the Pac-10.
"That game was ours to be won
and we did a miserable job of
doing it when it was there to be
won," Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "I'm pretty disap
pointed. They were there to be

buried and they just hung around
long enough and we let them back
in there. .. . We made absolutely
no plays in the last 10 minutes."
Adam Keefe, who had 20 points
and eight rebounds for the Car
dinal, hit two free throws to give
Stanford a 48-32 lead with 14:19
to play. But the Cardinal would
go nearly four minutes before
scoring again. After an 11-0 run,
momentum seemed to be com
pletely in Cal's court, but Bear
Coach Lou Campanelli got himself
called for a technical.
The two technical free throws
and an 18-footer from Lollie got
the Cardinal going, but a few mo
ments later the Golden Bears
heated up again. Cal is second in
the Pacific 10 Conference in three
point field goal percentage and
Keith Smith proved why, hitting
a trey to cut it the Stanford ad
vantage to seven.
John Patrick countered with a
three-pointer for the Cardinal,
but Ryan Drew had a pair of
threes to win the pot and make
it 57-53.
Cal forward Roy Fisher and
Smith sandwiched a Keefe layin
with buckets of their own to make
it 59-57. Andrew Vlahov missed
a pair of free throws and a Fisher
two-footer tied the game. Keefe
then missed two free throws and
Smith made two to put the Bears
ahead for the first time since the
score was 19-17 in the first half.
Deshon Wingate hit a layup off
a spin move to tie it but Smith
hit another pair of free throws.
Wingate again answered, this
time with a fast break layup but
Vlahov missed the front end of a
one-and-one with 47 seconds left.
Cal then ran down the clock and
Hendrick hit his shot.
"That was a gut check for us,"
Smith said. "That was really
tough for us. We didn't know if
we could make it (back) or not."
While Cal passed its gut check,
the Cardinal certainly didn't, es
pecially from the free throw line.
The team hit 8 of 18 (.444) for
the game, and only made 4 of 11
(.364) in the second half. The Car
