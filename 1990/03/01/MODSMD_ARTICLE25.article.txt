# Hendrick shot with :09 left wins game
## 
### Robert Pardington Senior staff writer 
Stanford center Adam Keefe and California
forward Brian Hendrick are two of the bright
est young big men of the Pacific 10 Conference.
Last night in Maples Pavilion, Keefe, a soph
omore, outplayed Hendrick, a freshman, for
most of the game.
But the 6-foot-8 Hendrick made the play of
the game, and possibly CNN's Play of the Day,
to provide the final margin of victory for the
Golden Bears. Hendrick's 13-foot running
double-pump jump hook over Keefe went down
with nine seconds remaining (one second ac
cording to the Stanford student section) and
Hendrick, fouled by Keefe, converted the free
throw.
Hendrick's heroics put pressure on the Car
dinal to tie with a three-pointer. Stanford failed
on two last-second attempts to score and Cal
had pulled off "the best come-back we've ever
had," as California Coach Lou Campanelli put
it.
Campanelli was full of praise for his sleek
and sinewy forward. "Brian's a money man,"
Campanelli said. "He's good to have there in
the clutch."
From Hendrick's perspective, he was just
trying to make the best of a "broken-down
play," a position he has been in before.
"It seems like I always get the ball in that
situation," Hendrick said. "Basically, I was
thinking I had to create the shot. Keefe played
great defense. I shot it with a really high
arc. . . he tipped it, then I shot it when I came
down. I think I was almost on the ground
when I shot it."
"He double-clutched, and then he just made
a great shot," Keefe said matter of factly. "It
was a great move by Brian. I didn't notice if
I got a piece of it. I just went up straight and
tried to interfere with the shot."
Hendrick scored nine of his 11 points in the
second half. Tough defense by Keefe and early
foul trouble (three in the span of eight
minutes) made Hendrick hesitant offensively
in the first half.
"Keefe is a really strong player inside,"
Hendrick said. "It took a while (in the second
half) to get it going."
In that second half, Hendrick
came alive, scoring inside on of
fensive rebound putbacks. He
went 5-for-10 overall from the
field and gathered 6 rebounds.
Keefe had the stronger game
statistically, however. He finished
with 20 points, on 8-of-16 shoot
ing, and eight rebounds in a full
40 minutes of action. A 4-for-9
performance at the line marred
an otherwise productive game.
Actually, both players' numbers
in last night's contest were
slightly subpar. Hendrick and
Keefe play a similar style of bas
ketball, banging inside, and their

season averages reflect that.
Keefe leads the Pac-10 in field
goal percentage, shooting 62.8
percent. Hendrick is second with
60.5. Keefe also leads the confer
ence in rebounding, with 9.3 per
contest, and Hendrick averages
7.6, seventh in the Pac-10.
As time goes on, Hendrick's
level of play is approaching
Keefe's. The same trend was ap
parent in last night's game.
Keefe schooled his cross-Bay
counterpart for a couple of dunks
in the first half, and effectively
neutralized Hendrick on defense.
After halftime, Hendrick be
came more active at both ends of
the court and asserted himself in
the scoring column. Keefe was
still matching up well with
Hendrick, but he was starting to
show some signs of fatigue.
