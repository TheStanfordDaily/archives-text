# Stanford's superior sports standards don't merit arrogance
## 
### 
I wasn't in the greatest mood during
Monday's baseball (ahem) contest,
which, in case you hadn't heard, Stan
ford won 19-3 against Lewis & Clark
College.
The way I felt was mostly due to having
gotten home from Los Ai geles at 5 o'clock
that morning, and the lack of sleep had
made me even more sarcastic than usual.
I wasn't going to complain, though, be
cause anyone who gripes about having
to spend a cloudless afternoon at Sunken
Diamond would probably whine about
winning the lottery.
Anyway, I was all set for a great game.
It was a perfect day for baseball, and
there really wasn't anywhere else I'd have
rather been. Until I watched the Pioneers
start to play.
It was ridiculous. Their starting pitcher

gave up four homers in the first, but
that wasn't what was funny. On an ex
tremely good day, Stanford can crush just
about anyone. Maybe not so quickly, but
it could still happen. Pioneer hurler Doug
Nichols probably couldn't pitch in Divi
sion I, but at least he wasn't a joke.
His catcher was another story. The
Cardinal stole four bases in the first in

ning, and the throws from Dan Wilkens
to try to catch the runners were,
well . . .horrendous. Once, on a double
steal, Tim Griffin beat the throw (a one
hopper, of course) to third base by about
two feet.
Wilkens wasn't exactly dazzling behind
the plate, either. I actually laughed out
loud during Jeff Hammonds' second time
up in the inning, when he popped up in
foul territory and Wilkens tripped trying
to catch the ball. A friend and I started
to sing the theme from the Bad News
Bears. It was gonna be a looooong game.
Now, as a fan, I thought all this
was great and I really wouldn't
have felt too bad if Stanford had
stolen 10 more bases, scored 15 more
runs and given the Pioneer pitcher an

ERA twice as large as his weight. After
watching the team drop two of three to
USC, I had no problem watching a farce.
The part of me that pretends to be a
writer, though, had somewhat mixed
feelings about the whole thing.
After the first inning turned into a
bloodbath, my first I-got-four-hours-of
sleep-last-night reaction was to think that
I really wanted to get the heck out of
there, write my story (which I could have
done after the first inning) and go to
bed. I decided to stay, but I wasn't sure
why.
My second inkling, after watching
Wilkens drop the pop foul, was to write
the harshest story imaginable, giving
every gruesome detail: Dropped fly balls,
40-mph curves, 65-mph fastballs, missed
cutoff men, bases stolen at will, inept

hitting, the works. Some of that got into
the story (which was still brutal), but
not nearly as much as I could have put
in.
My final reaction, which also happened
to be the only semi-mature one, didn't
come until the next day, long after I'd
written my story, gotten some sleep â€”
and found out the Pioneers are an NAIA
school.
Who the hell was I to laugh?
Sure, the Pioneers weren't a good
team, even by NAIA standards. But
does that justify my sarcastically
ridiculing them in my story? No way. I
think 1 know why I did it, though, and
it's something that every Stanford fan
