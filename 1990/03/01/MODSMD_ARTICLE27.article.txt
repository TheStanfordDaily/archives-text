# Kostich enjoys competition on the Farm
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
At most schools, a swimmer
who had established the Pan-
American Games' record in the
1500-meter freestyle and who had
competed in the finals of two
events in the U.S. Olympic Trials
before ever dozing off in a college
lecture would stand out high
above fellow classmates. At Stan
ford, however, sophomore Alex
Kostich enjoys being just one of
the many tall members in the
crowd.
"With so many diverse individ
uals here, there are no big fish
in a small pond," Kostich says.
"Everyone is amazing in some
way — from concert violinists to
top-ranked comedians. We have
big fish in a big pond; that's really
incredible."
Kostich chose to dive into Stan
ford's invigorating pond after a
recruiting trip in the spring of
1988. He applied only to Harvard,
where his high school swimming
instructor coached, and Stanford,
and had determined that if he got
rejected by both colleges he would
not go to school. After Dean Jean's
acceptance letter came in the
mail, Kostich decided it was time
to escape the cold New England
winters he had become so accus
tomed to in his hometown of Bel
mont, Mass.
"When I came out here, I was
blown away by Stanford," he says.
"There was nothing I encountered
on the two-day trip that I didn't
like."
For the Cardinal coaches, Kos
tich's high school swimming
credentials certainly did not
displease them. In 1985, he broke
into the national aquatic scene by

winning a gold medal in the 1500
at the National Sports Festival.
The summer after receiving his
fourth consecutive selection as a
High School Ail-American in the
1500, Kostich recorded the fastest
qualifying time in his strongest
event at the 1988 Olympic Trials.
In his freshman year at Stan
ford, Kostich swam into the
NCAA finals in the 1650-yard
freestyle. Still, Kostich felt un
comfortable with his final taper
and wanted to find a way to lower
his times.
"My times didn't drop as far as
I wanted in 1989," Kostich claims.
This season, Kostich has

worked out with Stanford fresh
man and three-time Olympic gold
medalist Janet Evans and has in
creased his morning training
schedule to four days each week.
He has also emphasized stroke
practice to a greater extent.
"Each workout is like a plate,"
Kostich says."The more plates,
the better taper in the long run.
I should be exactly where I want
to be [in the next few weeks)."
Although he does not yet feel
he is at his peak, Kostich com
mented that the continuous hard
training for the past few months
has begun to pay off for many of
the Cardinal swimmers in the last

couple days.
"We kept up our intensity
throughout the season," Kostich
says. "It's now beginning to show
— like a wave effect with us click
ing into tapers and starting to
swim great."
Maintaining his admiration of
his Stanford classmates, Kostich
points away from himself toward
the younger swimmers whom, he
believes, will catch the Pac-10 off
guard in a couple of days.
"I am psyched about our fresh
men," he enthuses. "They've
trained hard, and they're going
to surprise themselves. It's poten
tial ready to bust loose."
