### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Capitalizing on several key
points in the third set, Stanford
sophomore Alex O'Brien suc
cessfully defended his NorCal
Intercollegiate tennis title
against teammate Jonathan
Stark, 6-2, 2-6, 6-2, yesterday
at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The final match between
O'Brien, Stanford's No. 2-
ranked player, and Stark, Stan
ford's No. 1-ranked player, had
been postponed because of the
team's trip to the ITCA/USTA
National Team Indoor Cham
pionships in Louisville, Ky.

Alex O'Brien 6 2 6
Jonathan Stark 2 6 2

In a match of ups and downs
for both players, O'Brien took
the upper hand early, moving
to a 5-0 lead before winning
the first set 6-2.
Stark, however, soon recov
ered and overpowered O'Brien
in the second set with an array
of aces and penetrating volleys.
"John started off a little slow
in the first set, and I took ad
vantage of that," O'Brien said.
"In the third set, it was just a
matter of who broke who first."
O'Brien, who had been re
turning serve well throughout
the match, came up with the
crucial break at 2-2 in the third
set. "IThat service break 1 really

swung the momentum in my
favor," O'Brien said. "After
that, 1 was just thinking that
1 needed to get my first serve
in and that I needed to take it
to him. I wasn't going to let
him take control of the match."
Stanford Coach Dick Gould
praised both players, saying the
match came down to a few
points. "John played a few
loose points in the third set.
You can't do that against a
player like Alex O'Brien."
O'Brien, who usually beats
opponents from the baseline,
came to net often in the three
set match. "Alex did a great
job of mixing it up," Gould said.
"He probably served and vol
leyed more in this match than
in any other [he has played in
Stanford Stadium 1."
With the win, O'Brien be
came the first person to suc
cessfully defend the title since
1978. Stanford Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger won back-to
back NorCal titles in 1973 and
1974.
When asked if O'Brien was
following in his footsteps,
Whitlinger replied, "In 1974, I
went on to win the NCAA
(singles) Championships. So, if
he'B going to follow in my foot
steps, I hope it's like 1974."
"It's not easy to defend cham
pionships," Gould added.
For Stark, the No. 1 seed in
the tournament, yesterday's
loss marked the third straight
time he has fallen in the final
round.
