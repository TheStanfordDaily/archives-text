It just goes to show what the addition of new
blood can do for a team.
One chance to sail a women's regatta this year
was all that the Stanford sailing team's three
freshman women's team skippers needed to win
the Women's West Coast Winter Championships
in Newport Beach last Sunday, sponsored by UC-
Irvine and Orange Coast College.

With an impressive 17-boat fleet, the sailors
had more than enough competition at the line
and through out the entire regatta.
Saturday's racing gave the team just enough
time to get used to the light conditions. Katherine
Ivey and crew Lisa Forssell placed third overall,

including a first-place finish. Haley King and
Marina Kimball fared a respectable seventh.
Stacey Misakian, in her third time at the helm
this year, placed tenth with crew Midge Ette.
Her races were highlighted with a second-place
finish, where she beat top-ranked teams from
Irvine and OCC.
Saturday's efforts gave the team a second place
overall, preparing them to show off their skills
on Sundav. The combined efforts of the three
boats in the single division regatta earned them
a first place.
Although the water was at times near-glass,
local resident Ivey felt right at home in to sail
to a stunning second place with Forssell on Sun
day. King and Kimball also moved up in the
ranks, placing fifth, while Misakian and Ette
placed eighth.
According to Coach Blake Middleton, the sailors
"have come a long way since their first regatta
in the fall. The women's team is developing at
a rate we haven't seen in years."
The women's teams will be traveling to Boston
in late April to compete in intersectionals.
