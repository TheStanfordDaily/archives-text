# Students to re-enact historic Alabama voting rights march
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Aiming to re-enact a moment in history
while also advancing civil rights, nine
Stanford students will fly to Alabama
today to participate in a march from
Selma to Montgomery.
The group of students, known as
"Project Democracy II," will join mar
chers from throughout the nation, fol

lowing the same path that civil rights
activists did in the 1965 "Bloody Sunday"
march. Among the marchers will be the
organizer of the original march, U.S. Rep.
John Lewis of Atlanta, and other partic
ipants from that demonstration.
The students will attend a Sunday
church service led by the Rev. Jesse Jack
son and then go to a pre-march rally
before beginning their five-day, 50-mile
trek, according to junior Jay Tucker, who

organized the group. Students will stay
in homes along the route of the march.
The march will culminate in the cross
ing of the Edmund Pettus bridge, where
protesters in the march 25 years ago
were brutally beaten or killed by police,
according to senior Lyzette Settle, an
other project member.
The original march was organized to
support the passing of the Voting Rights
Acts of 1965. That march, which was not

federally protected, was marred by vio
lence.
A few days after the violence, Martin
Luther King Jr. organized a successful,
federally protected march from Selma to
Montgomery.
The first Project Democracy, sponsored
by the Black Student Union and the
Public Service Center in January 1988,
was a black voter registration drive in
Georgia and Alabama.

According to Tucker, the new project
members will focus on bringing "the
spirit and history" of this year's event
back to Stanford. He said Project Democ
racy II members will organize dorm pre
sentations to educate the Stanford
community about the march and what
it symbolizes.
Christine Brady, resident assistant at
Roble Hall, said she wants to "give
other people a sense of what we
can all do." The project members
said they want to compile an oral
history from some of those who
marched in 1965.
Tucker said he "was personally
touched" by the current education
problems in Selma schools. Stu
dents there have boycotted the
schools and have conducted sit-ins
and protests against the tracking
system. Many charge that this
system discriminates against
black students, who comprise 70
percent of the population, Settle
said.
The black students are "left out
of upper-division classes even if
they have high test scores," she
said.
When the superintendent tried
to "dismantle" the tracking sys
tem recently, the school board, on
a 6-5 vote "split along racial
lines," decided not to renew the
superintendent's contract. Selma
mayor Joe Smitherman, who was
also in office in 1965, has been

targeted as a racist by protesters.
The Stanford students will par
ticipate in a short march to the
City Hall tomorrow to protest the
school board's decision.
Tucker said Project Democracy
II has raised money through the
Office of Residential Education,
the Haas Center for Public Service
and the Black Community Serv
ices Center. The group has a
budget of $4,000 to $6,000 but
has only been promised $3,000,
so each project member will have
to contribute $100 for the trip.
