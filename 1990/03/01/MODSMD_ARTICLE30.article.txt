If you were scheduling the sec
ond biggest women's tennis event
of the year, you probably would
not schedule it in Wisconsin, in
the middle of winter.
But then, you're not the Inter
collegiate Tennis Coaches Associ
ation, either. Beginning today at
the Madison, Wis. Nielsen Tennis
Center, all of the nation's top
teams begin competition in the

National Team Indoor Champion
ships.
Stanford is the defending cham
pion of the tournament, which is
played in a similar format to
NCAAs. The only major difference
is that when a team loses a first
round match, it gets placed in the
consolation bracket. And, teams
losing second-round matches in
either the winner's or consolation
bracket are still guaranteed a
third-round match.
It is that guarantee that en

courages the best teams to make
the trek to Madison. The top
ranked Cardinal is seeded No. 1
and is followed by Florida, UCLA
and Georgia in the seedings.
The Cardinal brings its 45-
match dual meet winning streak
into the tournament. If Stanford
gets by host Wisconsin — the only
unranked team in the field — in
the opening round, the Cardinal
will face No. 11 Indiana or No.
13 Arizona tomorrow.
A win over the Hoosiers or
Wildcats would set up a probable
semifinal with the Bulldogs Sat
urday. Georgia is led by sopho
more Shannan McCarthy, a
talented serve-and-volleyer who
considered attending Stanford.
Behind McCarthy, the Bulldogs
have another top-ranked player
in Stacey Schefflin.
McCarthy and Schefflin com
bine to form one of the top dou
bles teams in the nation, but were
beaten 6-0, 6-1 by Stanford's Ten
Whitlinger and Meredith
McGrath at the Riviera All-
American Championships in Oc
tober.
The biggest question facing the
Cardinal right now is when will
McGrath arrive in Madison. She
is currently playing at the Virginia
Slims event in Indian Wells, Calif.,
where she won a first-round
match Monday over Belinda
Cordwell. Yesterday, McGrath
beat Amanda Coetzer 6-2, 7-6 (7-
3). Her next match is tomorrow.
If the Cardinal should reach the
finals, its opponent will likely be
Florida or UCLA. Outside of
McGrath, the Gators' Andrea Far
ley has to be the nation's top
freshman.
The Bruins, on the other hand,
have the distinction of being the
last team to beat Stanford.
