# INTERMISSION
## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Hunting season Spy novel now big-screen thriller 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
Some military-inspired films open with
the finesse and energy of a nuclear bomb,
but not "The Hunt For Red October." In
stead, it carefully positions the characters
and subplots required for the grand assault.
Then, under the command of director John
McTiernan, the film attacks.
Well, in this era of orgasm-length atten
tion spans, "The Hunt for Red October"
requires a little bit of patience to begin
with, but truly explodes in the end.
Inspired by a 1976 mutiny on a Soviet
frigate, the film depicts the attempted defec
tion of the Soviet Union's most elite sub
marine commander, Captain Marko
Ramius (Sean Connery).
As he races toward America in the dead
liest, most silent submarine ever built, the
"Red October," the U.S. military believes
he is a madman bent on nuking the East
Coast. However, C.I.A. analyst Jack Ryan
(Alec Baldwin), claiming to know how
Ramius thinks, believes that he is trying
to defect. With only 72 hours to prove his
theory, Ryan races across the north Atlantic
from ship to sub.

closing in on him, Ramius must also con
tend with the shaky support of his officers,
KGB informants, sabotage, and the possi
bility of a pro-Motherland mutiny by the
crew.
The challenge for the makers of "The
Hunt for Red October" was to take the epic
scope of the novel and hone it down into
a two-hour film. Virtually every scene that
appears in the film is taken directly from
the novel.
Yet, though faithful to the basic story,
the film version of "The Hunt For Red
October" unfortunately lacks the total scope
of the hunt and the Soviet perspective as
depicted in the novel. Another weakness is
the all-too-brief explanation of Ramius' mo
tivations for turning against his country.
For some people, the fairly detailed set-up
of the story that is the first hour of the
film may lack suspense. Once the actual
"hunt" begins, however, all of these faults
are quickly forgotten.
Coming off his blockbuster successes
"Predator" and "Die Hard," director John
McTiernan successfully marshals together
the elements necessary to create a logistical
wonder. He adeptly establishes two distinct
atmospheres in the Soviet and American
subs.
The interior of the "Red October" itself
is dark and metallic and its officers are
hesitant. Mistrust and fear are juxtaposed
with the blind patriotism of the anthem
singing crew. Everything about the milieu
of the "Red October" suggests war.
Aboard the American surfacecraft and

subs, there is more light and garish
decor. The bridge of the submarine
U.S.S. Dallas appears to have more
in common with video games and
audio equipment than with mac
hines of war. In contrast to their
Soviet counterparts, the Amencan
crew members act more relaxed,
exuding confidence.
Blessed with many talented ac
tors, "The Hunt For Red October"
simply does not have enough time
for most of its cast to fully exhibit
their skills. Only Baldwin is given
the chance to turn in a virtuoso
performance. Succeeding admirab
ly, he conveys a feeling of exhilarat
ing confusion as he portrays a
common man sucked into the eye
of a political storm.
For Connery as Ramius and
Scott Glenn as U.S.S. Dallas Cap
tain Bart Mancuso, the range of
performance is much more limited
due to their characters' strict mil
itary demeanor. Within those nar
row limits, Connery imbues
Ramius with an aura of arrogance
and melancholy. He protects him
self with an aloofness that only
the warmth of Sam Neill, as Cap
tain Vasily Borodin, can overcome.
Rivaling "Batman" in terms of
sheer visual impressiveness, "The
Hunt For Red October" treats the
viewer intelligently, paying off with
a spectacular climax. Perhaps the
unexpected demise of the Cold War
may have taken some of the edge
off of the film. Still, "The Hunt
for Red October" is a razor-sharp
thriller.

"The Hunt for Red October" opens
nationally tomorrow.
