# Director McTiernan brings suspenseful style to 'October'
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Imagine that your job requires you to
tell Sean Conncry how to act, Alec Baldwin
how to appear, and James Earl Jones how
deep to speak. Not easy tasks.
For John McTiernan, director of "The
Hunt for Red October," these responsibil
ities came with the position. McTiernan
literally stood at the helm of this season's
biggest motion picture.
Although McTiernan himself is not
quite a household name, his movies speak
for themselves. Alter breaking into the
movie industry in 1985 with "Nomads,"
a little-known Pierce Brosnan flick,
McTiernan directed "Predator," an ex
tremely successful action/adventure film
starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.
McTiernan went on to direct "Die
Hard," the 1988 thriller starring Bruce
Willis. The "non-stop suspense" style of
McTiernan received such commercial suc
cess ($BO million in theaters alone), that
McTiernan was labeled a master of
suspense Now, with "The Hunt for Red
October," McTiernan again utilizes his
talents to keep audiences on the edge of
their seats.
Intermission spoke with John McTier
nan on the phone shortly after the Wash
ington, DC. premiere of "The Hunt for

Red October."
Intermission: How did you originally
become involved in the project;
John McTiernan: I wanted to do the
movie version of "The Hunt for Red Oc
tober" right after I'd read the book, which
was well before I directed "Predator" and
"Die Hard." Luckily, by the time the film
was ready, my career had moved along
enough.
I: The pace of "The Hunt for Red Oc
tober" is markedly different from your pre
vious two works. Was this more difficult
for you to direct?
JMcT: This movie was based a lot more
on dialogue. Because it wasn't a "shoot
'em-up film," I did have to make some
changes, but it wasn't that difficult After
all, it's still a suspense story.
I: Since Tom Clancy wrote his book,
events around the world have signaled an
apparent end to the Cold War. Do you
think that these changes affect the recep
tion of your film'
JMcT: "The Hunt for Red October" is
a film about how the Cold War might
have ended. In drafting the screenplay, we
didn't want to be too literal, because such
matters of the state arc too important.
But we tried to make the film realistic.
I think it's dangerous to prescribe too
much political realism into it. But I do

I think it's dangerous to prescribe too much
political realism into it. But I do think that we
portrayed the Russians in the film realistically. . .
guess you could make the metaphor between the
crew and the Russian people themselves, for both
are now sailing into uncharted waters.

think that we portrayed the Russians in
the film realistically. We tried to capture
the emotion of the Russian crew in the
scene where they sing their national an
them. I guess you could make the meta
phor between the crew and the Russian
people themselves, for both are now sailing
into uncharted waters. Hopefully, Ameri
cans will get a little choked up by this
scene.
I: Do you think that you remained faith
ful to the book?
JMcT: 1 tried to be extremely faithful
to the original book, but the primary dif
ficulty in translating any book to the
screen is that something is left out. When
you boil the screenplay down to plot alone,
you tend to lose a lot of the nuances.
When I joined the project, they had

already gone through four screenplays, but
I wasn't happy with the result. I went
hack to the hook and found the missing
piece, which I think was Tom Clancy
himself; in every paragraph of the book,
it's implicit that he is involved with the
story. We cast Alec Baldwin for the role
of Jack Ryan because he represents a
younger, more athletic Clancy, not a
fames Bond-type individual
I: Then what was the biggest difficulty
for you on this film?
JMcT: The biggest difficulty was trying
to finish writing the screenplay by predict
ing upcoming events. The preamble of the
movie and the lines at the end were wntten
one and a half years ago, not at the end.
We had to make moral guesses to where
the world was going And I think we did

a pretty good job at prophesizing; the
changes in the world came faster than we
expected, but in the same direction.
I: What was it like to work with Connery
and Baldwin?
JMcT: Sean provided a lot of guidance
on the set. He's so professional about his
work, and always does his homework
before each day of filming. Alec was the
same way, but in a different sense. Alec
was constantly watching Sean and learn
ing things.
I see it kind of like a "passing-of-the
torch" relationship; while Sean represented
the American hero of the 19605, Alec
represents the American hero of the 19905:
less confident, less cocky, and perhaps a
bit more sensitive Alec did insist upon
doing the hehcopter-to-sub scene in the
movie, which we filmed in the Puget
Sound up by Washington We had to set
up special safety precautions (including
divers to check the waters for great white
sharks) so that Alec could take the 20-foot
fall himself.
I: What's your next project?
JMcT: I am just starting work on "Road
show," starring Sean Connery and Cher,
a movie about a weird marnage and a
contemporary cattle drive Sure, it's dif
ferent from my past movies, but I like
doing different things. It keeps me
growing
