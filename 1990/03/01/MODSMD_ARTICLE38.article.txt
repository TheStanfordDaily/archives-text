## 'Cinema' an Italian paradise 
### Brad Bruner Staff writer 
Sometime in the near future,
Francis Ford Coppola will finish
Eroduction on the newest "Godfat
er" epic, destined to once again
persuade America that Italy is a
slovenly network of mafia hitmen.
Fortunately, "Cinema Paradiso,"
an affirming and consistently
delightful look into an Italian's life
and dreams, shatters those
stereotypes before they are
reiterated.

Salvatore Cascio

won last year's Cannes Film Fes
tival Special Jury Award. Now, the
movie seems to be reaching the
wide audience it has deserved since
its Italian release two years ago.
By wisely infusing his film with
many universally nostalgic ele
ments, director Giuseppe Tor
natore has made it easy for
audiences everywhere to forget the
extra effort required to read subti
tles. Instead, one is immediately
swept up by this film's boundless

energy and heart.
In the rural Sicilian town of
Giancaldo, young Toto (played by
the exuberant Italian newcomer
Salvatore Cascio) is already dis
satisfied with the mundane reality
of church, work and school forced
upon him. Like hordes of others
in the quiet little town, he seizes
every opportunity to escape to the
town's only theater and the great
adventures it holds.
His fascination with films leads
him to befriend the theater's
projectionist, Alfredo (Phillippe
Noiret). Although the elderly man
initially has mixed feelings about
allowing the young boy's entangle
ment with the theater, the two
learn to work together to calm the
fiesty crowds at the John Wayne
films and quiet the protests of the
town priest, who shuns all scenes

depicting bodily affection in the
films.
Toto matures in the projection
booth, seemingly content with his
bewitching fantasy-film life. Even
though his adolescence eventually
catches up with him and leads him
away from the theater, he cannot
resist adding all the trappings of
high Hollywood romance to his
first relationship, and soon re
quires Alfredo's guidance to resist

emotional overindulgence.
In bringing his vision to the
screen, director Tornatore has
imbued "Cinema Paradiso" with
an acute marking of every action,
like little Sicilian boys making In
dian noises during the matinee
westerns. The sense of nostalgia
of Salvatore (the grown-up Toto),
remembering his own childhood,
is amazingly sharp and tantalizing.
