Intermission Recommends
The Hunt For Red October
A faithful rendering of Tom Clancy's best seller,
"The Hunt For Red October" has it all: Sean
Connery in the lead role, an awe-inspiring visual
design, and a solid plot. This movie is clearly
the best film released since the Oscar crop.
Bom On The Fourth Of July
Tom Cruise gives a performance full of rage
and heart. The film Itself is like having a tooth
drilled with no anesthetic: every frame commands
your attention, yet you would not want to go
through the experience again. "Born On The
Fourth Of July" Is nominated for eight Academy
Awards.
Driving Miss Daisy
Based upon Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize
winning play, "Driving Miss Daisy" offers Oscar
nominated performances by Morgan Freeman,
Jessica Tandy and, believe or not, Dan Aykroyd.
The film Is extremely engaging and is one of the
very best of 1989.
