# Phi Delts relieved
## Suspension is lifted 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
After five months of uncer
tainty the University, has lifted
the social suspension of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity, but offi
cials will closely monitor the fra
ternity's future actions.
The University released the
final report on the Phi Delt in
vestigation yesterday after Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons
accepted it Monday.
The report includes an investi
gation of the incident leading to
the Phi Delts' suspension at the
start of the year, a synopsis of
the chapter's recent history and
the proposal submitted by the Phi
Delts for their new social guide
lines.
The Phi Delts were on social
suspension pending investigation
since Sept. 28, when an intox
icated freshman was hit by a truck
after attending the fraternity's
Hurricane Party.
Lyons partially attributed the
five-month delay to the complex
historical context of the case.
The Phi Delts have been placed
on social suspension three times
in the last four years for violations
of Interfraternity Council party
guidelines. The University has
also reprimanded the fraternity
several times for unacceptable be
havior of individual fraternity

members.
In light of past problems with
the fraternity, Lyon's "initial re
sponse was to revoke the recogni
tion and housing privileges of [the
fraternity)," according to his ac
ceptance letter for the investiga
tion report.
However, the leadership shown
by present and former Phi Delt
officers impressed Lyons and
"was a critical factor in [his] de
cision" to accept their proposals,
according to the letter.
Although the social suspension
is over, the fraternity will remain
on probation until winter quarter
1991, when the University will
finally determine if it will con
tinue to recognize the Phi Delts.
The fraternity's proposals in
clude holding a completely dry
Rush, emphasizing closed parties,
eliminating all alcohol from open
parties and employing an outside
agency to serve beer and monitor
the door at house parties.
"Obviously I'm very pleased
that the proposals were accepted,
and I'm glad that the whole in
vestigation has finally come to an
end," said Phi Delt president
Chris Helling.
"However," Helling continued,
"Now it's time for (the Phi Delts)
to move on and demonstrate our
commitment to the University
and to the community."
