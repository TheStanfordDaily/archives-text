# 'Courage' shows very little Sheen

Most actors start out playing lowly roles in lowly
movies with conspicuously low budgets. Charlie
Sheen is no exception.
Although Sheen has had other small parts, such
as the druggie in the police station in "Ferris Bueller's
Day Off," nis role in "Courage Mountain" typifies
the inevitable exploitation of a widely-recognized
name.

"Courage Mountain" is a tale about a Swiss girl,
Heidi, and her growth into womanhood. The movie
is initially set in the Swiss Alps in 1915. The story
opens with Heidi's decision to attend school in Italy
with the money her grandmother bequeathed to her.
She goes to the Brookings Institute, an all-girls school
in Northern Italy.
At school, Heidi soon discovers that she is the
least-educated of all the other teenage girls, and many
of her peers begin to ridicule her. At this point, it
seems that the movie is going to be another "new
kid gets accepted" flick. However, before anything
significant can be made of this theme, Austria
declares war on Italy, and the Ital
ian army requisitions the school
as a headquarters.
Now the movie shifts into a sort
of "Oliver" story, as the girls are
reluctantly moved to a dismal or
phanage, where two villains utilize
the kids they trap there as slave
labor. The villains are fairly stereo
typical, with a shady moustached
man and a fat, sadistic lady
domineering over everyone. It fol
lows that they are also
stereotypically stupid, as they
eventually allow the children to

escape.
This leads into the next major
movie-within-a-movie, the sur
vival in the wilderness/five female
teenagers crossing the Alps in win
ter/escape from the bad guy
scenario. The girls persevere
through the mountain pass with
the evil man in hot pursuit.
One might ask, "But where is
Charlie Sheen in all of this? Didn't
he get the top billing?" And the
wilderness scenes spotlight
Sheen's acting performance for
most of his fifteen-minute appear
ance.
Sheen, as Peter, plays a "valiant"
Swiss Army member in the midst
of World War I. In addition to the
fact that the Swiss remained

neutral throughout the war, Sheen
doesn't cut much of a dashing fig
ure with his semi-spiked hair and
Southern California accent.
Also, the love between Peter and
Heidi, who is possibly six or more
years younger than Sheen (a big
age difference, between 13 and 19),
makes him look like some sort of
pedophile.
Needless to say, Sheen is not
very convincing, and neither is this
movie. Both Sheen's acting and the
movie in general push the bounds
of mediocrity to a new low. Per
haps this film has appeal tor 12-
year-old school girls, but even they
would complain about Sheen's ep
hemeral performance.
