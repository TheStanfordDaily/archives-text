# Weak 'Heart' fails Coleman, cast
## 
### Chris McKenna 
Every once in a while, amidst
the mire of mediocre movies that
Hollywood perpetually feeds the
public, a small gem of a film rises
above the muck and takes us com
pletely by surprise. "Where the
Heart Is" is definitely not one of
these films.
Fancying itself as a sort of
modern fairy tale, "Where the
Heart Is" traces the riches-to-rags
back-to-riches course of the
Mcßain family. Stewart Mcßain
(Dabney Coleman) is an irritable
New York City demolition king
who, fed up with supporting his
spoiled, "artsy" children, (Uma
Thurmon, Suzy Amis, and David
Hewlett), decides to give them a
lesson in self-sufficiency.

Forced to live in a dilapidated
Brooklyn tenement, the children,
together with their offbeat friends
and tenants, are taught to rely on
their own creative talents to sur
vive. All the while, the kids learn
that important lesson: home is
where the heart is. Had enough?
Sorry, there's more. Mcßain's
company is then attacked by cor
porate raiders, causing him to file
for bankruptcy. Suddenly on the
streets, Mcßain finds refuge with
his children, and learns that same
lesson for himself. Ugh.
During one of the "deeper" mo
ments in the movie, Mcßain says
to his daughter Daphne
(Thurmon), "You know, some
times I feel like all of this is one
big rehearsal." Though this
profound statement is meant as a

reference to life, it aptly describes
the quality of the acting.
Throughout the movie, lines are
recited, not delivered. The only
redeeming quality of "Where the
Heart Is" is that Coleman ("9 to
5," "Dragnet") demonstrates that
he has not forgotten how to play
the gruff and surly character that
he has been portraying for the last
10 years.
This film has been described as
"a comedy-farce with underlying,
thought-provoking questions about
the state of the modern family."
Instead, "Where the Heart Is" is
devoid of humor.
