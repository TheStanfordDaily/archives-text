# Bombaywala serves up fine cuisine of India
## 
### Sarah Laurence Staff writer 
The boundary between city and
"country club" is often a fine line —
sometimes no wider than a pair of
Caltrain tracks. That little spasm where
Palm Drive swells over El Camino then
slithers beneath Alma Street and the
tracks marks Stanford's limit.
But Palo Alto, waiting coyly at the
other side, can provide rapture when Stan
ford fails. Though hardly a multi-ethnic
metropolis itself, Palo Alto has managed
to bear the offspring of a truly variegated
city, Bombay.
Bombaywala, an Indian restaurant and
deli located off University Avenue, will
both fill and fulfill you. The restaurant's
name is a colloquial word indicating the
flavor and sophistication, of Bombay. And
lacking neither flavor nor sophistication,
Bombaywala definitely lives up to its
name.
T-shirts sold at the restaurant claim
that Bombaywala serves "the hottest food
in Palo Alto." That may not be saying
much, but the food's flavor, delicious as
it is authentic, does depend on masterly,
unrestrained seasoning. Spice lovers will
relish this fiery escape from normal fare.
If you haven't had much experience with
hot food, don't be dismayed: unlimited,
self-serve water should extinguish any
excessive internal flames.
Besides the seasoning, food at Bom
baywala features variety with reasonable
prices. Dishes in the formidable buffet

are prepared differently each day, but the
main ingredients remain the same. At
dinner, one will always find dishes con
taining chicken, beef, pork, lamb, potato,
legume and green vegetable, as well as
rice and two Indian salads. Nowhere else
will $7 go so far. The lunch buffet costs
about $5, and both meals are "all-you
can-eat."
Bombaywala's fruit drinks are well
worth the extra couple of dollars. One
can order a blend of seasonal fresh fruit
and mineral water, or the denser, more
strongly flavored mango lassai.
As the weather improves, you will able
to enjoy Bombaywala's cuisine at one of
the restaurant's outdoor tables, while
watching the sublime red sunset over the
train station. And perhaps in the distance,
you can see Stanford University,
seemingly an entire world away.

Bombaywala is located at 421 Alma St
in Palo Alto.
