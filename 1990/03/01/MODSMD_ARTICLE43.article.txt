A standing-room-only crowd enthusi
astically received performers in last week
end's "Moving Together" World Dance
Festival, held at Roble Dance Studio.
The reappearance of the festival after an
absence of eight years suggests a renewed
interest in specific ethnic dance forms.
Over a dozen cultures were represent
ed, with styles ranging from the intricate
steps and hand movements of the Chi
nese Folk Dancers to the demanding
bends and leaps of the dueling suitors
in Khadra Folk Ballet's "Russian Suite."
Other memorable performances included
the introspective spirituality of the Sri
Lankan Abi-Sugan brothers and the
gregariousness of the Kuumba Dance En

semble's "Thnidadian Suite."
The festival brought world-renowned
dance professionals and Stanford stu
dents together on the same stage.
"Moving Together" revealed the talent
and diversity of Stanford's cultural dance
groups. Groups such as Dunai Interna
tional Folk Dance Ensemble, Hula Halau
O Hooikaika, and El Ballet Folklorico de
Stanford all perform regularly at campus
cultural events and dorm functions.
Each dance form had its own special
techniques, best demonstrated in sepa
rate free classes held on Saturday after
noon. Tanya Leake and Melissa Miller
held an African dance class, followed by
Debra Gomez teaching Hula.
"We wanted to stress the technique of
various types of African dance, to show

the logic behind what we do," Miller
said. "Too often, people mistak";iiy think
of various types of ethnic dance as an
expression of a mysterious passion, in
stead of a socially and intellectually de
veloped art form."
Despite the distinct qualities of each
dance form, the audience left with a
feeling of community — there were pow
erful similarities between dances.
Commonality between people seems
to have been the most important message
of the Festival. As noted in the program,
"It is well known that our community
is home to a rich variety of cultures, but
what is less often acknowledged is the
great common bond all of these world's
peoples share when they lift their feet
to dance."
