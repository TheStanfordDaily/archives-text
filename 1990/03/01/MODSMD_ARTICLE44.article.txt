# Carpaccio fuses tastes of two worlds
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Nestled on a side street just off the
beaten path, Menlo Park's Carpaccio
brings California-style dining and decor
and old-world Italian cuisine together.
And the combination works.
Wrapped in soft lighting, Carpaccio is
surrounded by soft colors and wall
decorations that range from ceramic pigs
to paintings of personified farm animals
recalling George Orwell's "Animal
Farm."
Carpaccio offers a wide range of pasta,
veal, chicken and fish dishes. There is
also an excellent selection of appetizers,
soups, salads and desserts as well as a
long wine list.
The minestrone soup was well

seasoned and an excellent way to warm
up on a chilly evening. The salad was
fresh and topped with a tangy house
dressing.
Meals at Carpaccio are moderately
priced with entrees ranging in price from
$8 to $17.
The Petto di Polio Paillard, a flattened,
seasoned chicken breast, was light and
tasty at $10.25. On the other hand, for
only $8.75, 1 received a huge portion of
Fettucine Alfredo. The fettucine was not
quite seasoned properly, but it was far
better than most Italian restaurants this
side of the country could produce. And,

except for a few places in Boston (such
as my grandmother's kitchen), it was
some of the best pasta I've ever tasted.
For dessert, the fresh Strawberries in
Grand Marnier was incredible. If the res
taurant did not have a $7 minimum
charge, I'd stop by every night just for
dessert.
To cap off the meal, the espresso was
also excellent.
The atmosphere at Carpaccio was bus
tling on a Friday night, but the restaurant
which also has a bar can scat 130 people.
It is open for dinner six nights a week
and for lunch on Monday through Friday.

Carpaccio is located at 1120 Crane
Street in Menlo Park. Call 322-1211 for
reservations.
