# Murphy reaches 'Deep' new meanings
## 
### Tim Marklein 
Sheer emotion is an overwhelming musical
element, but few musicians can take advantage
of the feelings within them and genuinely
portray them in their music.
Peter Murphy's second album since Bauhaus
dissolved proves his hold on that unique talent.
Though he has adopted a more mainstream
approach in his solo career, Murphy has
definitely not "sold out."
Incorporating several different musical styles
on the album — some songs even have subdued
elements of rap — "Deep" often sounds like

a refined and expanded version of The Church's
best music.
Murphy's lyrics, which often employ an in
verted sentence technique, have a poetic feel
and take on deeper meaning when combined
with the deliberate emotion in the music. The
lyrics do not usually reveal their meaning im
mediately, but the music's context and
Murphy's vocals develop the songs' messages.
Extremely powerful is the sense of automated
conformity Murphy sees in the constant desire
to "go out night after night," as depicted in
"Roll Call": "Wake up with a preset mind/With
no self control/And you decide to call the Roll

Deep

Call/Of the socialites who mortified/Can't see
as far as their next surprise."
The music is not content with a simple
anti-capitalistic, pro-identity orientation, how
ever, and Murphy's insight into life's com
plexities only serves to show a person's
struggles to find his own meaning in life.
Enriching as well as enjoyable, Murphy's
"Deep" lives up to its name.
