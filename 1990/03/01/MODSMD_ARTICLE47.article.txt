# Michael tries to make his own Penn-name
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
You can't really blame Michael Penn for
trying.
After all, when your older brother is less
than role-model material, it's hard to set your
self apart from your sibling's tarnished image.
So, instead of spending time attacking media
photographers, Michael Penn recorded an al
bum, "March."
Propelled by the steadily increasing success
of its first single, "No Myth," Penn's debut
album is quickly gaining popularity. Both crit
ically and commercially, Penn is beginning to
make quite a name for himself.
Most of the attention is directed toward "No
Myth," an infectious, musically simplistic song

March

about lost love. Penn's vocal range, though
limited, is surprisingly high, and his own back
ground vocals are strikingly similar to old
Beatles tunes. This obscurely named song is
incredibly catchy, and the acclaim is quite
deserved.
Yet, this single proves to be the brightest
spot on an otherwise fair album. The skeletal
musical style, which usually utilizes only
guitars, keyboards, and synthesized drums, is
not quite strong enough to support an entire
album, and eclipses Penn's lyrical strengths.
Penn's thoughtful comments on love and re

lationships are insightful and even profound,
but find difficulty in overcoming the weak
nesses of his music.
Perhaps part of the musical problem lies in
Penn's partner throughout the album, Patrick
Warren, whose meager keyboard responsibilities
parallel those of Wham's Andrew Ridgeley.
Penn's music also seems to rely too heavily
upon synthesized instruments. In "Evenfall,"
which contains real drums and horns, the
music is again as strong as the powerful lyrics,
which are loaded with imagery.
Michael Penn is making a name for himself
in music with his debut album. And though
"March" is far from flawless, his lyrical and
vocal talent signals the potential for future
success.
