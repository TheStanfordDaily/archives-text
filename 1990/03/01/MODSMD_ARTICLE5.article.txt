Greg Ricks wants to spark the
"Fire Within" inside Stanford
students of all races.
"I see myself not as a leader,
but as a coach who sits on the
sidelines and provides ideas,"
said Residential Education's
multicultural programmer, de
scribing his newly created
position. Ricks' face beamed, op
timism filled his voice and he
laughed amiably as he talked
about his favorite subject — stu
dents.
"Stanford students have a
deep passion and concern for
people and the human experi
ence. I think the 'Fire Within'
is within all students here," he
said, referring to a multicultural
program held every fall during
Freshman Orientation Week.
Ricks, who became multicul
tural programmer in January,
grew up in a "working-class"
town south of Boston. "Growing
up as a kid I was really athletic,"
Ricks said. He swam and played
basketball, baseball, tennis and
football.
In his predominantly white
town, Ricks was the first black
Eagle Scout — the highest honor

in the Boy Scouts of America.
Ricks, who said he grew up
with "middle-class values,"
credited his mother with much
of his success. "You'll know
when you're successful," his
mother told him.
Ricks, who said he had a very
"fun" childhood, went to the
1963 March on Washington as a
teenager and "hated it " He was
missing a baseball series to at
tend the massive civil rights ral
ly.
"My mother said, 'This will
be important to you one day.'
Now I love the idea that I went,
but then I was a sulking teen
ager," he chuckled.
Ricks first encountered racism
in ninth grade, when he and his
white girlfriend were separated
by her father. The father said
that at that age, "the races sep
arate."
"After that I was very angry,"
Ricks said. "I started looking for
racism everywhere, and I found
it everywhere."
Ricks was accepted to
Dartmouth College but chose to
attend Hampton University, a
predominantly black college. "I
felt good about me for the first
