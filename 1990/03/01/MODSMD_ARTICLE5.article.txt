# Greg Ricks provides new spark for Res Ed
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Greg Ricks wants to spark the
"Fire Within" inside Stanford
students of all races.
"I see myself not as a leader,
but as a coach who sits on the
sidelines and provides ideas,"
said Residential Education's
multicultural programmer, de
scribing his newly created
position. Ricks' face beamed, op
timism filled his voice and he
laughed amiably as he talked
about his favorite subject — stu
dents.
"Stanford students have a
deep passion and concern for
people and the human experi
ence. I think the 'Fire Within'
is within all students here," he
said, referring to a multicultural
program held every fall during
Freshman Orientation Week.
Ricks, who became multicul
tural programmer in January,
grew up in a "working-class"
town south of Boston. "Growing
up as a kid I was really athletic,"
Ricks said. He swam and played
basketball, baseball, tennis and
football.
In his predominantly white
town, Ricks was the first black
Eagle Scout — the highest honor

in the Boy Scouts of America.
Ricks, who said he grew up
with "middle-class values,"
credited his mother with much
of his success. "You'll know
when you're successful," his
mother told him.
Ricks, who said he had a very
"fun" childhood, went to the
1963 March on Washington as a
teenager and "hated it " He was
missing a baseball series to at
tend the massive civil rights ral
ly.
"My mother said, 'This will
be important to you one day.'
Now I love the idea that I went,
but then I was a sulking teen
ager," he chuckled.
Ricks first encountered racism
in ninth grade, when he and his
white girlfriend were separated
by her father. The father said
that at that age, "the races sep
arate."
"After that I was very angry,"
Ricks said. "I started looking for
racism everywhere, and I found
it everywhere."
Ricks was accepted to
Dartmouth College but chose to
attend Hampton University, a
predominantly black college. "I
felt good about me for the first

time," he said. "It was the edu
cation I needed at that time; I
needed a sense of myself."
Ricks later went on to receive
a master's degree in city planning
from MIT. He then became dean
and director of the Afro-American
Institute at Northeastern Univer
sity. At 24, he was the youngest
dean in the school's history.
During his 10 years at North
eastern, Ricks received a master's
in educational administration
from Harvard and coordinated a
massive community development
project in the area surrounding
his campus.
After leaving Northeastern, he
spent time at Dartmouth, at the
African-American Institute in the
United Nations, and in Africa,
Jamaica and England. "I think I
lived my 30s in my 20s and my
20s in my 305," Ricks said, laugh
ing.
During the past 20 years Ricks
has become a firm believer in
public service. "You don't have to
go all the way to Delhi and work

with Mother Teresa," he said.
"You can go right over here to
East Palo Alto and find conditions
almost as tough.
"There is nothing exotic about
poverty, homelessness or hunger."
As multicultural programmer,
it is Ricks' job to promote and
help coordinate ethnic events in
the dorms.
Ricks outlined six points that
he said are crucial for all Stanford
students to understand about
pluralism:
• Activities should be student
led and student-driven;
• "Everybody represents a solu
tion for multicultural education";
• There are "no easy rides.
Every community on this campus
has a lot of work to do when it
comes to multicultural educa
tion";
• "It is scary for all of us, but
we should not run away";
• The Stanford community
must foster an environment
where students can "debate the
issues and not be labelled"; and
• White students must recog
nize their individual European
backgrounds and realize they
have their own unique cultures
as well.

ence. I think the 'Fire Within'
is within all students here," he
said, referring to a multicultural
program held every fall during
Freshman Orientation Week.
Ricks, who became multicul
tural programmer in January,
grew up in a "working-class"
town south of Boston. "Growing
up as a kid I was really athletic,"
Ricks said. He swam and played
basketball, baseball, tennis and
football.
In his predominantly white
town, Ricks was the first black
Eagle Scout — the highest honor

in the Boy Scouts of America.
Ricks, who said he grew up
with "middle-class values,"
credited his mother with much
of his success. "You'll know
when you're successful," his
mother told him.
Ricks, who said he had a very
"fun" childhood, went to the
1963 March on Washington as a
teenager and "hated it " He was
missing a baseball series to at
tend the massive civil rights ral
ly.
"My mother said, 'This will
be important to you one day.'
Now I love the idea that I went,
but then I was a sulking teen
ager," he chuckled.
Ricks first encountered racism
in ninth grade, when he and his
white girlfriend were separated
by her father. The father said
that at that age, "the races sep
arate."
"After that I was very angry,"
Ricks said. "I started looking for
racism everywhere, and I found
it everywhere."
Ricks was accepted to
Dartmouth College but chose to
attend Hampton University, a
predominantly black college. "I

time," he said. "It was the edu
cation I needed at that time; I
needed a sense of myself."
Ricks later went on to receive
a master's degree in city planning
from MIT. He then became dean
and director of the Afro-American
Institute at Northeastern Univer
sity. At 24, he was the youngest
dean in the school's history.
During his 10 years at North
eastern, Ricks received a master's
in educational administration
from Harvard and coordinated a
massive community development
project in the area surrounding
his campus.
After leaving Northeastern, he
spent time at Dartmouth, at the
African-American Institute in the
United Nations, and in Africa,
Jamaica and England. "I think I
lived my 30s in my 20s and my
20s in my 305," Ricks said, laugh
ing.
During the past 20 years Ricks
has become a firm believer in
public service. "You don't have to
go all the way to Delhi and work

with Mother Teresa," he said.
"You can go right over here to
East Palo Alto and find conditions
almost as tough.
"There is nothing exotic about
poverty, homelessness or hunger."
As multicultural programmer,
it is Ricks' job to promote and
help coordinate ethnic events in
the dorms.
Ricks outlined six points that
he said are crucial for all Stanford
students to understand about
pluralism:
• Activities should be student
led and student-driven;
• "Everybody represents a solu
tion for multicultural education";
• There are "no easy rides.
Every community on this campus
has a lot of work to do when it
comes to multicultural educa
tion";
• "It is scary for all of us, but
we should not run away";
• The Stanford community
must foster an environment
where students can "debate the
issues and not be labelled"; and
• White students must recog
nize their individual European
backgrounds and realize they
have their own unique cultures
as well.
