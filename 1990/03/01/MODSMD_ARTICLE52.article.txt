# Lange, Cusack shine in 'Men'

### Kelly Parsons 
Comedy and drama are two dis
parate cinematic elements which
filmakers often have a difficult
time reconciling with one another.
While the two aren't necessarily
mutually exclusive, the careless
use of both in the same movie can
lead to immense problems in both
the mood and storyline of the film,
resulting in an incoherent jumble
of conflicting emotions that leaves
audiences hopelessly confused.
"Men Don't Leave" is one of
those rare examples of a movie
which successfully fuses comedy
and drama into a smooth
flowing, emotionally charged
movie.
The movie relates the story of
Beth (Jessica Lange), a typical sub
urban housewife who is forced to
deal with her husband's sudden,
untimely death. Economic circum
stances compel Beth and her two
sons to relocate to downtown Bal
timore where the three react in
various ways to the unexpected
turns that their lives have taken.

'Men Don't Leave' is
one of those rare ex
amples of a movie
which successfully
fuses comedy and
drama into a smooth
flowing, emotionally
charged movie.

with just enough comedy to
prevent the overall tone of the
movie from becoming too
melodramatic.
Although "Men Don't Leave"
drags a little in the middle of the
movie and leaves some important
plot implications unresolved, it is
a well-made film that deserves at
tention.

Unquestionably, the best quality
of "Men Don't Leave" is its superb
acting performances. Jessica Lange
turns in a particularly impressive,
sensitive portrayal of Beth, while
Joan Cusack (who received an Os
car nomination for her supporting
role in "Working Girl") is equally
enchanting as a spaced-out neigh
bor who becomes romantically in
volved with Beth's teenage son.
The two young actors who portray
the fatherless sons also deserve
credit for their solid performances.
Writer/director Paul Brickman
("Risky Business") wisely keeps to
a simple and direct story, concen
trating instead on the development
of the characters, and allows the
performers the opportunities to
shine in their respective roles. His
direction expresses a conscious
desire to keep the movie from turn
ing into a heavy-handed morality
play about family loyalty in the
face of tragedy.
Dramatic scenes, for example,
are often followed by scenes that
are played strictly for laughs. Brick
