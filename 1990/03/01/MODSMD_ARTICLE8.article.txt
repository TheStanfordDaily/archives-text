An article in Tuesday's Daily
inaccurately reported that, follow
ing a report of a rape, Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole con
tacted a student only twice during
a five-month period. In fact, Cole
interviewed the student twice but
contacted her more often.
An article in Monday's Daily
stated that Shauna Jackson is the
first black elected president of the
Stanford Law Review. She is not
the first black president but the
first black woman president.
