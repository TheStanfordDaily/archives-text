# Death penalty debated

Calling the death penalty a
"compassionate response to the
most evil crimes," John Luft, a
San Mateo County deputy district
attorney, opened a lively debate
in the Roble Hall lounge last
night.
Arguing in favor of the death
penalty, Luft said the punishment
has a specific deterrent effect. "If
[the death penalty] deters even
one, it is of infinite worth," he
said.
In sharp contrast, Camille Bell,
a representative of Amnesty In
ternational and the mother of a
murder victim, said the death
penalty is not a compassionate re
sponse to a terrible crime â€” it is
a moral wrong.
She explained that involving the
death penalty prolongs a trial. It
"doesn't allow [wounds] to heal
and brings the victim's family
back to the crime again and
again."
Bell argued that the death
penalty is nothing less than a
mandate for the state "to kill

someone for me."
In rebuttal, Joyce Allegro, su
pervising deputy district attorney
of Santa Clara County, said, "If
the death penalty is truly state
murder, then prison must be state
kidnapping, and fines are state
thievery."
Furthermore, Allegro stated,
"To see murder and state execu
tions as the same because death
is involved is just as morally per
verse as seeing rape and love
making as similar because they
both involve sexual intercourse."
A difference between the
death penalty and other punish
ments is the finality of it, accord
ing to Gerald Uelman, dean of
Santa Clara University Law
School. "The potential for error
is [in the criminal justice system],
and we shouldn't tolerate these
errors when it concerns a human
life," he said.
Uelman added that subjective
factors such as wealth, race and
politics often determine how the
small minority of defendants who
are given the death penalty are
selected.
