"Carte Moore has achieved an unusual and unqualified
success. He has written a scholarly, political treatise
which is at the same time personal and readable
literature. His brave analysis of racism in Cuba throws
light on the condition of racism everywhere in the world.
This is a book to read, to study, quote from and to
share."
Maya Angelou
Author
"Carlos Moore is uniquely qualified to provide this
unprecedented insight into the little known racial facets
of Cuban politics."
Alex Haley
Author
"To understand how Cuba became involved in the
independence movement of Tanzania and the Congo, as
well as the struggle against neo-colonialism in Ethiopia
and .Angola, Carlos Moore's succinct, insightful, and
candid account is indispensable. The section on Che
Guevera in Africa is fascinating."
