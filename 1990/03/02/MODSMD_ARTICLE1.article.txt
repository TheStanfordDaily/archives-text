# Varsity sailing facing cut as athletics slashing continues
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
The varsity sailing team became the
latest victim of the budget ax this week
when the Department of Athletics told
coaches that the team will be reduced to
a club sport next year.
In addition to the change in status,
sailing program director Joe Petrucci and
team coach Blake Middleton will lose
their jobs next year.
The decision follows closely on the
heels of decisions to cut the field hockey

and track programs. The cut is another
step the University is taking to save an
ailing athletics progam that has a $1
million shortfall in student-athlete finan
cial aid this year.
And sailing may not be the last pro
gram cut, according to Alan Cummings,
associate athletic director. He indicated
that the recent cuts were by no means
the last.
The cuts may also eliminate the sailing
association, which provides non
competitive sailing on larger boats. Sail
ing and windsurfing classes in future

years may also be affected, but no deci
sions have been made and coaches could
only speculate on what the cuts might be.
Cummings said his "expectation is that
the sailing team will continue to be suc
cessful." The team will continue to com
pete at its current level, he said.
However, members of the team are
unsure of the future of the program,
according to co-captain Matt Dunbar, a
junior. The cut in Athletics Department
funding will force the team to hire a
coach with its own funds next season.
Coaches and members of the team,

which is currently ranked 15th in the
nation, expressed surprise at the move
to cut the program, particularly because
the sailing program receives very little
funding from the Athletics Department.
Cummings said the cut will save the
department about $50,000.
The team members were notified at
practice on Wednesday, according to Da
vid Dowd, a member of the varsity team.
Sailing team co-captain Robert Brown
called the cut a "big surprise." He said
the team is disappointed and concerned
for its director and coach.

Middleton noted that he had heard
rumors about a possible cut for weeks
but did not expect that it would happen
Petrucci declined comment.
Middleton said he was called into Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger's office on
Tuesday morning and told that the team,
and his position, would be cut.
Geiger has made no public announce
ments about any of the cuts, and he was
out of town yesterday He has not re
turned numerous phone messages left at
