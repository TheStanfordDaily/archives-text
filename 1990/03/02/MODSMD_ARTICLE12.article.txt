# Senate compromises on new clean air bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
leaders and the Bush administration
reached agreement yesterday on a com
promise clean air bill providing tighter
controls on emissions from
automobiles, electric power plants and
factories.
Republican and Democratic leaders
as well as the White House promised
to work for passage of the agreement
when the measure comes up for debate
on the Senate floor next week.
The agreement, the product of three
weeks of closed-door negotiations,
reflects a middle ground between air
pollution controls required by a sweep
ing bill that cleared a Senate commit
tee last November and the more cau
tious and less expensive approach ad
vocated by the administration.
One aim of the compromise was to
defuse the prospect of a filibuster
which had been threatened by a group
of Midwest senators concerned about
the cost of complying with the acid
rain provision.
Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, called it a "sound
and comprehensive" proposal and said
he hoped it would avoid any filibuster.
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority
leader, said he would work to advance
the compromise legislation, but urged
Mitchell "not to handcuff anyone" dur
ing the upcoming floor action by rush
ing to impose a petition to cut off
debate on the matter.
Among the provisions of the com
promise:
• Industrial plants would have to
use the best available technology to

curb releases of 192 toxic chemicals,
including carcinogens, and early in the
next decade comply with a specific
"health standard" to limit risks to
people closest to industrial plants.
• Under the acid rain provision,
electric utility plants will have to
reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions
by 10 million tons. Some provisions
were included to ease Midwest con
cerns about high cost of emission con
trols and concerns from the West that
the curbs might inhibit growth.
• Tougher tailpipe emission controls
on automobiles would reduce smog
causing pollutants by 22 to 60 percent,
depending on the pollutant. A second
round of emission curbs would go into
effect if at least a dozen of 27 com
munities with "serious" pollution
problems failed to achieve federal air
quality standards.
• A broad range of industries and
businesses would have to comply with
tougher controls on smog-causing
emissions. The compromise, however,
would exempt thousands of smaller
polluters, which would have been cov
ered by the original Senate bill.
"This agreement is environmentally
sound and strong," said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
He said the provisions "will achieve
significant and permanent reductions
in pollutants that cause acid rain, will
ensure annual improvements to bring
our nation's cities into compliance with
standards relating to urban smog and
carbon monoxide, and will greatly
reduce the risk to the public's health
from toxic emissions."
