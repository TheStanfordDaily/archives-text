Twenty years later,
Afro-Am still needs
University support

THEY HAD TO struggle to
get it; why must they
struggle to keep it alive?
For the last 20 years the African
and Afro-American Studies pro
gram has opened the eyes of the
Stanford community to issues that
have faced and continue to face
blacks. The program provides
Stanford with a wide variety of
services that go far beyond the
classes it offers.
Afro-American Studies is a prod
uct of the struggle of many stu
dents to create an atmosphere at
Stanford that is supportive of all
people, regardless of their color.
The efforts of these students and
the support of the ideals that in
spired them to take action have
paved the way for the development
of Stanford as a multicultural com
munity.
Why, then, is this program,
which has contributed so much to
the growth of the Stanford com
munity as a whole, deprived of the
support necessary for it to develop
to its fullest potential?
Throughout its history, the pro
gram has been forced to operate
with a shortage of faculty and
funds. Despite urgent requests to
hire more faculty, the University
has not hired any new professors
since the early 1980s.
Furthermore, the lack of re
sources and University support
makes it difficult to attract new
faculty who are interested in mov
ing forward in this field.
Without professors to teach the
substantial range of classes neces

sary to constitute the Afro-
American Studies major, the
program is unable to fulfill the
needs of students who want to
learn about different aspects of this
field. Currently, there is only one
Afro-American Studies professor
in the History Department and
none in either the Political Science
or Sociology Departments.
This neglect on the part of the
University has hurt the program
in substantial ways.
The last director of Afro-
American Studies, Assoc. History
Prof. Kennell Jackson, decided to
resign because he was not receiving
the necessary administrative or
budgetary support to adequately
run the program.
It is somewhat contradictory of
the University to say that it is
striving to integrate multicul
turalism into the curriculum, while
offering so little commitment to
developing ethnic studies? It is im
possible to integrate something if
it does not already exist.
Stanford needs to make support
for ethnic studies a priority on its
agenda. The creation of a program
is only the first step in a process
that requires continuous commit
ment from the University.
For multiculturalism in the cur
riculum to become a reality, the
University must be more attentive
to the needs of the existing ethnic
studies programs by hiring more
faculty designated to teach ethnic
studies classes and allocating more
funds to the program budgets for
programming.
The students who stood up and
fought for their right to be ed
ucated about their history and cul
ture in 1968 believed that their
struggle was won when Afro-
American Studies was instituted.
The struggle had only just
begun.
