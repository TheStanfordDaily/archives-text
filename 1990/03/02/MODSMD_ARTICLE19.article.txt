## Keep a mature skepticism 
### 
IN HIS LETTER of Feb. 20, Matthew
Bogumill suggested that columnists
tackle issues that are "a tad less black
and white" and proposed such topics as
"suicide or abortion." Well, I don't know
about you, but it's my feeling that if, in
your mind, suicide falls in that 'grey
area,' it's probably time to head over to
Counseling and Psychological Services or
the Bridge.
On the other hand, Bogumill posed
this fine question: "Why doesn't anyone
talk about God or a Supreme Being or
even Truth?" And it is in this spirit that
I bring you the first — and probably last
— installment of Philosophy Corner.
Hopefully, someone out there will attain
nirvana in the next 650 words.
I first began questioning my religion
when I was 13 and my best friend
declared himself an agnostic right in the
middle of pre-calculus class. That macle
quite a scene, I tell you. And, as soon as
I went and looked up its definition, I too
became an agnostic. I guess it seemed
pretty cool to me that the inability to
know anything about God was both an
official position and had its own $10 vo
cabulary word. (A warped conception of
"cool," I concede, but I was only 13).
Anyway, converted, I biked home from
school and later, over dinner, proclaimed
my agnosticism. I'd been ruminating
about this indecision I'd come to and had
rationalized that it was going to be a
very useful lack of knowledge. Indeed, it
seemed to me to be the perfect excuse
for getting out of all those boring reli
gious services, ignoring the minor rituals
and celebrations and (most of all) avoid

ing, like the plagues they were, those
nightmarish holiday dinners with family
and "friends."
My dad, a quick guy, pulled the obvious
trump card: "Guess you won't be getting
any presents come December then, will
you?" I'd planned for this, though, and
unveiled my next proposal: "Sure 1 will.
I figure we add the starting dates of
Christmas and Hanukkah together,
divide by two and on that occasion we
celebrate 'Greed Day.' "
As I remember, my dad whacked me
on the head and my mother made an
appointment for me to talk to the Rabbi
after school the next day.
About a year later, I went on a ski trip
with a Christian youth group called
"Young Life" — but not U> get that old
time religion just to ski. One evening
during the trip we to the"'jus
tification stage' — i.e., we did something
more Christian than ski. We gathered
together and took turns saying what
Jesus had done for us. It came to me,
and I considered lying — everyone had
been so darn nice to me. But I couldn't
go through with it. I had to tell the truth.
"Jesus hasn't done anything for me,"
I said. "And so far so good." Well, needless
to say, in their eyes I saw reflected a
flashing 'heathen' sign above my head
— and I believe I skied alone the following
day.
As you can see, I've never been at ease
with religion. Take the Holy Trinity con
cept, for example. Three-in-one is okay
as a brand name for oil — but for the
Almighty? I'm just plain skeptical.
I'm not condemning belief in a deity.

I'm just trying to illustrate a history of
discomfort with it and attempting to fig
ure out what it is that takes a person
from youthful skepticism to, well, mature
skepticism.
The case may have been closed for good
after a year in Western Culture (CIV plus
or minus a couple of books), when I found
out you just can't prove the existence of
God — and I know, because we tried in
section.
So what it comes down to is faith —
either you have it or you don't. And if
faith in a "Supreme Being" works ./or
you on an ethical plane, then great. As
a source of culture, hope and standards,
I can see the virtue. But when religion
goes from ethic to object — when the
institution and the people in it are raised
above principles — that's when I'm glad
I'm a skeptic, because that's where TV
evangelists and real-life superiority
dances come from. It's also where you
get a lot of your wars, censorship and
other such injustices.
So keep your skepticism high. Whether
it's a God or gods, the Supreme Being
or the Prime Mover, I don't think you
need faith in any of it to be sane, rea
sonable and a wholly decent person. I do,
however, think blind faith is a pretty
scary thing.
