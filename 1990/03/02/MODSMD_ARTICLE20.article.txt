University was prudent in date rape investigation

WE ARE SURE that the recent
press given to the problem of
date and acquaintance rape
will stimulate discussion and, we hope,
greater understanding of the complex
issues involved. The article on ac
quaintance rape, "Battling Bureaucra
cy," published Feb. 27, contains certain
factual errors, however, which should
be corrected for the benefit of Daily
readers.
• The article adopts as fact the
account set forth in the introductory
paragraphs describing "Pamela's"
sexual experience with the man she
has accused of rape. It does not note
that the facts of the evening in ques
tion are disputed, and does not report
that the man has denied that there
was a rape or any other improper
conduct.
Apparently based only upon the
account reported, the article concludes
that Pamela was in fact raped —
indeed, that conclusion is stated some
five times in the first seven
paragraphs of the article. While there
has been an allegation of rape by
Pamela, we think it is important that
readers know that there has been no

finding by Stanford, or by any court,
that a rape in fact occurred.
• Readers should also be aware that
the story reported in The Daily differs
from both of two somewhat different
accounts which Pamela provided to the
University in connection with her
complaint. These accounts in turn
differ from, and to some extent are
inconsistent with, statements made by
other witnesses.
• The writer reports that Pamela
says she was not told what steps
would follow her complaint, was not
advised of any rights she might have
with respect to obtaining her own
counsel, and was given only three
hours to attempt to persuade Sally
Cole to reconsider a decision not to
charge the accused. The article further
reports Pamela's claim that her home
number was given to the lawyer of the
accused. All these statements are inac
curate.
Pamela was told that her accusation
would be investigated, a process which
would involve talking with the accused
and with other people she identified as
having information concerning the
events in question.

She was also expressly told that the
process might take some time, but that
she should feel free to call at any time
to be brought up to date on its prog
ress. Indeed, Pamela did call the Judi
cial Affairs Office several times, and in
such calls was informed of the progress
of the investigation.
Pamela was also told that although
she did not need a lawyer in connec
tion with her Fundamental Standard
complaint, she might want to consult a
lawyer concerning what civil or crimi
nal remedies might be available to her.
She was also reminded that she might
want to make a police report.
Further, recognizing the continued
emotional impact on Pamela of the
evening in question, it was suggested
to Pamela that she might want to see
a counselor. After the investigation was
completed, Pamela was informed of
Cole's decision not to charge a violation
of the Fundamental Standard, was told
the reasons for that decision and was
given a reasonable opportunity to
identify any additional witnesses or
evidence supporting her complaint. In
the absence of such witnesses or
evidence, Cole's decision stood.

• The concluding paragraphs of the
article contain Pamela's allegation that
"two students have filed charges of
sexual harassment against him (the
man she accused] with the University."
No such charges have been filed with
the Judicial Affairs Office, nor, to our
knowledge, with any other office likely
to receive such a complaint, including
offices responsible for enforcing the
University's policy prohibiting sexual
harassment.
We acknowledge and appreciate that
this was a distressing and emotional
situation for Pamela and for the ac
cused student. In our view, however,
the more serious the accusation, the
greater is its potential to injure, and
the more carefully we must restrain
any impluse to prpjudge the situation
without first obtaining and evaluating
all of the facts which tend to support
— or refute — the allegation.
