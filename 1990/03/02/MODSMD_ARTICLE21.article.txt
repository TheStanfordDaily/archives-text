# New mechanism needed to respond to rape on campus
## 
### 
Imagine the following scenario. It's
early in the morning and a freshman
comes into your room to tell you that
she had been date raped the night
before. The only advice that you — the
resident assistant — can offer is to
point the woman to a counselor or to
the police because the University lacks

a formal response to acquaintance
rape.
You wish you could tell the woman
to report the incident to the Judicial
Affairs Office and assure her that the
University will hold the rapist account
able for the felony and protect her
from the rapist. But you hesitate —
because the precedent the University
has set is that of putting the woman
on hold and disconnecting her.
In Tuesday's Daily, Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole stated that rape "is
an extraordinarily serious allegation
that has to be provable." But by her
own admission, "In a case of sexual
assault where it is one person's word

against another's, I don't think that
you can reach beyond-a-reasonable
doubt proof." Essentially, rape must be
proven, but to the University, it is
unprovable.
Such thinking leads to problematic
implications for the raped woman be
cause, according to Cole, a woman who
has been date raped cannot ever expect
the University to find the rapist guilty.
The statistics have been bandied
about — we ail know that date rape is
not foreign to our campus. For the
University officials to acknowledge this
(they even sanctioned the Rape Educa
tion Project's study of acquaintance
rape at Stanford!) and still not set any

guidelines is a quiet acquiescence.
So what can be done about this
problem? We don't profess to be
trained experts on this issue. However
as concerned students and RAs, we do
expect the University to consult the
experts, to educate themselves about
this problem and to find an appropri
ate mechanism to deal with rape as a
felony on campus.
