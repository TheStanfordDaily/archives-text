Howard Frost gave $65,000 to
Stanford University to construct
an amphitheater as a memorial
to his son, Laurence, who died
during the summer after his
junior year at Stanford.
Frost, the sole donor of the proj
ect, pledged his gift for the con
struction of an open-air
amphitheater with extensive
landscaping both within the bowl
and in the surrounding area.
Poor Howard could never have
expected that his beautiful
memorial to his son would one
day become an annual pilgrimage
site for hundreds of enthusiastic
Dead Heads. I'd just like to take
this opportunity to ask Jerry Gar
cia and the other members of the
band to play one for Laurence.
I'm sure he'd be "grateful."

The Stanford Daily sternly crit
icized an epidemic of canoe tipping
on Lake Lag in its main editorial,
which deplored the "current row
dyism." The editorial cited possi
ble health and safety hazards
which could result from the prac
tice of tipping unsuspecting
canoers and also reported that
such incidents had already
resulted in "damaged cashmeres,
watches and lighters."
Anyone who goes canoeing in a
cashmere deserves a dunking or
two. Still, the editorial makes an
important point that's still rele
vant today. If someone today
tipped over a canoe in Lake Lag,
(alias Lagunita Meadow), the un
lucky boaters might get some mud
on their shoes or step on a really
prickly plant.

Miss Elva Brown, the chief

counselor for women students,
said, "It has never been the ac
ceptable practice or good taste for
college women to appear in
playclothes on the Quad or down
town." "Playclothes" for women
in 1950 included shorts, jeans and
bathing suits.
What would Elva and the Uni
versity do to women who violated
these rules? Throw a fashion-flag
on the play? Require them to pres
ent public service community out
reach programs on accessorizing
for disadvantaged youth in the
surrounding areas? They could
just send them to the Physics
Tank, where no one seems to care
how they dress anyway.

A group of Stanford students
calling themselves Students
United for Rape Elimination
(SURE) organized the first escort
service on campus to ensure stu
dent safety after dark.
The service began with about
20 students who rode their bikes
from a dispatching point at the
Bridge to meet students calling
for escorts.
Now of course, the job of SURE
escorts is more complex. Not only
do they work to ensure the safety
of Stanford students on campus
after dark, but also they are re
sponsible for using electric golf
carts to chase down any students
they can find and almost perma
nently crippling them.
