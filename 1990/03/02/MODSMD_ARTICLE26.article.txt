# The 						Bug bids a fond farewell to his readers

### Aram Irwin Staff writer 
Considering that your average fruit fly
has a life span of 12 to 14 days, this
Bug's mighty happy to have had a lifespan
of nearly half a year.
Yes, for five plus months I've written
a Bug Me column nearly every week,
answering scores of questions covering
topics ranging from glow-in-the-dark
prophylactics to the shag carpeting of the
Tty Mahal. I've challenged some of the
most elusive mysteries humankind has
faced over the past few centuries, mys
teries like "How much wood would a
woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
chuck wood?" or "What causes 'cheek
dents' [dimples] and how can I get some?"
I've exposed a Stanford/CIA/KKK/ Japa
nese Mafia plot to laser-sterilize students
failing to pay back educational loans, an
operation disguised as a simple zipper
manufacturing company.
While searching for the humor behind
the scenes of The Daily's own "Strip
Search" comic strip, I inadvertently con
tributed to the most unfortunate prema
ture death of Stanford's beloved Evil
Squirrel and Company (and, much to Cal

vin's dismay, the equally unfortunate
decapitation of Hobbes).
I've invoked the ire of the righteously
righteous by pointing out the glamour of
multiple drug use — what could be more
glamorous than that wickedly wonderful
combination of freon gas and speed —
"The veins just under your skull swell
and explode, leaving a rather unsightly
mess on the rug. Unless, of course, you
were wearing swim goggles." Hey, now
that's glamorous.
I've lived a long and productive life as
The Bug and I feel that I've reached the
end of my useful lifespan. It's time for
me to reproduce and die — not too bad
a way to go, actually.
But before my surviving offspring
begin writing next week, I've saved up
some of the deepest questions readers
have asked . . .
Dear Bug,
The other day, I referred to this girl
in my class as a "girl" and she actually
got pretty upset at me, insisting that it
is derogatory calling a female friend a
"girl" while you would not call a male
friend a "boy." Several of my friends,
male and female alike, have supported

her argument, and it makes sense to me
too. But I would feel pretty stupid saying
to someone, "Oh yeah, I talked to this
woman in my class." What can I do to
be comfortable and still be fair?
— Mister
I suspect, Mister, that you would feel
just as stupid saying that you talked to
"this man" in your class. "Man" and
"woman" are just too formal to use
casually. You would probably say that
you talked to "this guy" instead, or even
"this dude" if you were up to it. But
what would you say instead of "this wom
an" if not "this girl?"
The dilemma is obvious. "Guy" is an
acceptable term for "man," — it is casual,
without negative connotations, monosyl
labic and easy to say. But "woman" has
no corresponding term except "girl,"
which implies immaturity (other equally
crappy choices: "babe," "chick," "broad,"
etc.). The solution is as obvious as the
dilemma: we must find a word which is
to "woman" as "guy" is to "man" (think
back to your SATs here).
Let's take a look at how the word "guy"
probably came into use. Some guy named
Guy was probably out to lunch where he

came across another guy named Guy.
They sat down to eat and just then a
mutual acquaintance strolled by and
cleverly realized she had the opportunity
to say "Hi Guys!" And voila! two Guys
sitting in a cafe are suddenly just two
guys.
So let's pick a slightly unusual but
definitely female monosyllabic name to
match up with Guy. How about Jan?
Let's try it:"I met this really cool
(guy/jan) in the Quad yesterday." Works
for me. Maybe now we can finally kill
Dick and Jane, that negatively-named
duo of kindergarden fame and replace
them with the more hip and happenin'
gender-aware duo of Guy and Jan. How
does it sound to you guys? How does it
sound to you jans?
I have yet to figure out where to stop
with the recent "man" to "person" con
versions. It's easy to say "chairperson"
instead of "chairman," but on the other
hand, quite a mouthful to say
"cameraperson."
Another difficulty is presented by the
fact that so many words have the word
"man" or "men" in them. Like "mental"
— after all, women can think just as well
as men — how about "womental"? Or

"manual transmissions" — why not
"womanual" transmission — women can
drive stick, too. And for that matter, how
about words which obviously involve
mainly women, like "menstruate" or
"menopause" or "hymen" for that matter.
Think about that, Mister.
Dear Bug That Thou Art,
Do you believe there is a God?
— Thinker
(Forgive me Joseph Campbell) Only in
the sense that God is a metaphor for a
mystery so vast it defies all human com
prehension and categorization.
