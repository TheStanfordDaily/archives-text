## STEDING AS SHE GOES Senior sharpshooter has made quite a name for herself 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Women's basketball Coach
Tara VanDerveer trusts
assistant Amy Tucker
when it comes to evaluating tal
ent. So VanDerveer was under
standably concerned four years
ago when Tucker said, "I can't
believe we signed Katy Steding
(to a letter of intent)."
Normally, Tucker sees pro
spective high schoolers play and,
if she likes what she sees, Van-
Derveer gets to the business of
enticing them to play for Stan
ford. Steding's case was a bit dif
ferent. It was VanDerveer's first
recruiting campaign as the Car
dinal's head coach and she went
up to evaluate Steding, a 6-footer
from Lake Oswego, Ore.
"All I remember was her
making one great move on the
baseline and that was enough for
me," VanDerveer says. "We
signed her without Amy seeing
her play. I was kind of nervous
about it."
Later, Tucker got a chance to
watch Steding in action and she
brought back the bad news. Van-
Derveer says Tucker told her:
"Katy looked terrible. Tara, she
did nothing in the game."
"I was panic stricken," Van-
Derveer recalls. In reality, she
had nothing to worry about.
Tucker's "evaluation" was noth
ing more than an elaborate hoax.
"Amy was just fooling me," Van-
Derveer said, laughing about the
incident. "Actually, Katy had 20
points and 15 rebounds in the
game Amy was at."
From the day she arrived at
Stanford, Steding has put up
similar numbers. Now a senior,
Steding is third on the school's
all-time scoring list with 1,478
points and second among
rebounders at 809. Currently,
she is third in the nation in

three-point accuracy at .491.
Considering that the Cardi
nal's small forward has started
in 112 of Stanford's last 116
games, one might think it's been
smooth sailing for Steding. Noth
ing could be further from the
truth.
Steding played center for her
team at Lake Oswego High
School, a position she was not
big enough to play in college.
"When I got here, I was a lot
smaller than most [centers],"
Steding says. "So I played strong
forward when I was a freshman.
"Then Trisha Stevens arrived
and Tara told me I needed to
work on the three (small for
ward) spot," she adds. Stevens
is a nearly unstoppable force on
the low block and Steding, some
what undersized among power
forwards, was about to make the
move from the post to the
perimeter.
"The transition at first was
very rocky indeed," Steding says
"I had never played without my
back to the basket. Handling the
ball was a whole new thing to
me. It's a whole different game
on the outside and making that
big a jump was really difficult
for me.
"I wasn't really confident in
my ability in the first place.
Having to move outside like that
just made it worse."
As expected, she struggled
some during her sophomore year.
Steding's scoring average slipped
from 11.1 her freshman season
to 10.0 and she shot just 40 per
cent from the field. She did, how
ever, lead Stanford in rebounding
for the second straight year,
averaging 6.9 boards, and was
named to the All-Pacific 10 Con
ference team.
Steding was not completely
satisfied and decided to do some
thing about it."I stayed down
here the whole summer after my

sophomore year to work on im
proving," she says, noting that
senior Jennifer Azzi and 1989
graduate Jill Yanke were around
as well. "I was in the gym at
least six days a week — most of
that was twice a day.
"I'd come in and shoot for an
hour in the morning before going
to work. Then we would play at
night for two or three hours,"
Steding adds. "It was a fun sum
mer, I really enjoyed it."
The Cardinal also traveled to
China that summer to play
several exhibitions and VanDer
veer says the trip was a real boon
for Steding. "WTiere Katy really
came into her own was in China.
Jennifer was not on that trip and
Katy had to score a lot," Van-
Derveer says. "[After one of the
games], the Polish team came up
to me and said, 'Oh, 23, she's
the best player on your team.' "
The fruits of her labor became
apparent last season. Her scoring
average jumped to 14.8 and her
field goal percentage shot up to
45 percent. She was fifth in the
Pac-10 in three-point accuracy at
.445 and sixth in steals at 2.0
per game. Again, Steding earned
all- conference honors.
Finally, she began to believe
in herself. "The biggest thing I've
gained from last year to this year
is confidence in what I can do
— in my ability," Steding says.
"I know my limitations but I
have confidence I can get the job
done."
VanDerveer thinks she should
have had that self-assuredness
all along. "As a coach, I think
Katy was the most frustrating
person I've coached when she
was a freshman and sophomore
— and even the beginning of her
junior year," VanDerveer says.
"I saw so much ... I hate to use
the word potential, but I saw how
good she could be.
"I don't know if she saw the

same things I did. Katy has
taught me as much as anybody
about coaching. If I got frus
trated or upset with her, she just
said, 'You're not helping me to
get better.' She wanted to im
prove and she's just really ma
tured as a person and as a
player."
"Like I said, I wasn't real con
fident in my ability," Steding
notes. "Everything she said I
took pretty negatively. I never
really understood the reasons
why she did things. I think we
have a better working relation
ship now. It's just a lot easier
for me to be receptive because
I've grown up a lot and I'm a
lot more confident."
Somewhere in the back of her
mind, Steding has always known
she could get the job done — if
she worked hard enough. "Every
year, I could see the team was
going up another level," Steding
says.

"I was fine at the level we
were at, but then I needed to
take my game up another level.
That's always been a real big
motivator because I always
wanted to be in the thick of it.
I never wanted to be on the side,
just watching. I couldn't do
that."
VanDerveer would rather talk
about what Steding can do. "It
used to be the only thing holding
Katy back was Katy. I don't think
she does that anymore. She is
playing with tremendous confi
dence. She knows she can play
with anybody. She's flat out won
some games for us," VanDerveer
says.
Teammate Martha Richards,
who backs Steding up at small
forward, speaks of her in almost
reverential tones. Says Richards:
"I've seen games where she's on,
like Arizona State (last weekend),
where she could've drop kicked
the ball and it would have gone

in. She's just a really good
shooter.
"Katy is without a doubt the
most underrated player in the
country. I don't think there's a
player at the three position that
can outplay her. There are people
who can play with her, but
there's no one who can clean up
on her.
"You have to go out every day
and give as much as you can.
Some days players only have 85
percent just because of other
things. Katy always gives as
much as she can every day.
That's the biggest thing I've
learned from her.
"In my mind, she's an All-
American. The thing is we prob
ably have four of them and you
can only have so many from one
team," Richards adds.
But even among members of
the Cardinal, Steding stands out,


Damian Marhefka — Daity
Katy Steding has her head in the right place this season, as she's helped the Cardinal to a 24-1
mark so far. Steding will play her last regular-season game in Maples Pavilion tonight.
