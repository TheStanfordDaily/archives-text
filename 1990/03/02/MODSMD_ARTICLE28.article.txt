# McCarty debunks soph slump myth

### Aden Fine 
Sophomore David McCarty has
emerged as one of the Stanford
baseball team's leading hitters,
but that hasn't surprised anyone.
What did surprise everyone is
that the Houston native even
decided to come to Stanford in
the first place. After all, the Car
dinal hadn't been able to success
fully recruit a player from the
backyard of college baseball
dynasty University of Texas for
longer than anyone cares to re
member.
"Getting him to come from
Texas was a pretty big deal for
us," Marquess said.
The reason he came, according
to McCarty, was that "what Stan
ford could offer me was better
than what the other schools could
offer me, educationally and

sports-wise."
Regardless of why he came
here, Stanford coaches, players
and fans alike are all glad he did.
After being named first team all
state his junior and senior years
in high school and playing on the
U.S. Junior National Team in the
summer of 1988, the Cardinal ex
pected great things from the 6-
foot-5, 210-pound first baseman.
However, sickness slowed him
down at the beginning of last year,
and it was not until the middle
of the season that he took over
the starting spot at first base and
began to play as had been ad
vertised. He quickly made up for
lost time and ended up the year
with a .297 batting average, five
home runs (third on the team)
and 20 RBI.
This year McCarty has started
out even stronger, in keeping with

the rest of his Stanford team
mates. He is currently batting
.306 with 4 home runs and has
already matched his 1989 RBI
total.
As a result, he is pretty happy
with how the season has gone
thus far. "I'm getting to the point
where I want to be up at the
plate," he said. "My confidence is
really high right now, and I'm
swinging just how I want.
Marquess also has a lot of con
fidence in his young power hitter:
"Right now, I'd say he's the
toughest out on the team, because
he's making good contact and is
doing really well with two strikes
on him."
Although McCarty is considered
to have the most power on the
team next to All-American Carey,
the key to McCarty's success may
very well be that he is not solely
a power hitter. As Marquess said,
"He is not your typical power hit
ter. He's very athletic, is a battler
up there, and can hit for average."
McCarty also recognized this
fact. "At the beginning of this
year, I was trying to hit home
runs, and I was striking out a
lot," he said. "The last couple of
weeks I've cut my swing down
and am really concentrating on
trying to just get on base, and
this has really helped me."
Last year, one of the problems
McCarty had was that opposing
pitchers could find one pitch that
he couldn't seem to hit. But that's
no longer the case, according to
Marquess. "Now, they can't just
throw him one pitch, because he
has learned to hit them all."
Over the summer, McCarty
played in the Cape Cod League
(which annually hosts many of
the nation's best collegiate
players) and had to use a wood
bat because of a league rule.
McCarty feels it really helped his
swing. "Using a wood bat, your

swing has to be mechanically cor
rect, or else the bat will break,"
he said. "(That) forced me to con
centrate extra hard on the me
chanics of my swing."
After starting the year in the
clean-up spot in the batting order
behind Carey and coming through
with some memorable blasts
(most notably a towering grand
slam against Fullerton State),
McCarty has been switched to the
number three spot in the line-up,
which is just fine with him.
"I like batting third," McCarty
said. "With Paul Carey behind
me, I know that my role is now
just to get on base for him, and
this has made me wait for my
pitch and be more patient at the
plate."
Despite the fact that he is most
known for his devastating power
at bat, McCarty is also quite a
good defensive player. After play
ing mostly outfield in high school,
McCarty was switched to first
base by the Cardinal, and he ad
justed extremely well, making
only 1 error in 350 chances last
year.
In fact, although McCarty may
not look it at first glance, Mar
quess says that he is a very good
athlete — which helps explain
why he is a good fielder. McCarty
was recruited by some schools as
a basketball player out of
Sharpstown High School, where
he averaged 17 points a game and
was named all-district his senior
year.
Although McCarty is currently
second on the team in RBI and
third in home runs, Marquess
feels the best is still to come. "The
key is that he will get better with
experience," Marquess said. "He's
really got no flaws, and it's just
a matter of experience. As he gets
stronger physically and mentally,
we'll see some more dramatic
things this year and especially
next year."
