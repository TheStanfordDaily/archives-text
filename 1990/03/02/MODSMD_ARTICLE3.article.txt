# Stage almost set for ASSU election season
## 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
By this evening, the 1990 ASSU
election races will have taken
shape — and this year's election
season could provide a few
surprises for campus political ob
servers.
A third student party has joined
the fray with the People's Plat
form and Students First parties.
The newly formed Stanford Unity
Party — which is campaigning un
der the name SUP — will sponsor
student bids for ASSU Senate po-

sitions but will
not run a slate
for the Council
of Presidents.
In another
surprise, the
Chaparral
humor maga-

zine is not expected to be running
its traditional Hammer and Cof
fin slate, according to first-year
graduate student Perry Fried
man, a long-time Chaparral
jokester.
The People's Platform slate for
the COP will include seniors

Jamie Green, Goodwin Liu and
Ingrid Nava and junior Jay Tuck
er. Nava is a member of the cur
rent COP.
Members of the Students First
COP slate will be juniors Lora
Abe, Michael Canul and Tim
Marklein and freshman Cecilia
Tom.
Today is the deadline for pro
spective candidates for the COP
and senate to submit their letters
of intent. The elections will be
held in mid-April.
