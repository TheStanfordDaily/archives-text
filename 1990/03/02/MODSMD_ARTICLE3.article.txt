# Stage almost set for ASSU election season
## 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
By this evening, the 1990 ASSU
election races will have taken
shape — and this year's election
season could provide a few
surprises for campus political ob
servers.
A third student party has joined
the fray with the People's Plat
form and Students First parties.
The newly formed Stanford Unity
Party — which is campaigning un
der the name SUP — will sponsor
student bids for ASSU Senate po-

sitions but will
not run a slate
for the Council
of Presidents.
In another
surprise, the
Chaparral
humor maga-

zine is not expected to be running
its traditional Hammer and Cof
fin slate, according to first-year
graduate student Perry Fried
man, a long-time Chaparral
jokester.
The People's Platform slate for
the COP will include seniors

Jamie Green, Goodwin Liu and
Ingrid Nava and junior Jay Tuck
er. Nava is a member of the cur
rent COP.
Members of the Students First
COP slate will be juniors Lora
Abe, Michael Canul and Tim
Marklein and freshman Cecilia
Tom.
Today is the deadline for pro
spective candidates for the COP
and senate to submit their letters
of intent. The elections will be
held in mid-April.

"It's pretty easy for someone to
get on the ballot," said elections
commissioner Steve Krauss. Stu
dents interested in running for
the senate or COP need only sub
mit a declaration of intent by the
proscribed deadline and garner
student signatures for their peti
tion to run for office. Prospective
senators are required to find 100
students who are willing to sup
port them, while a COP slate is
required to find 200.
Although the Unity party is not
offering a slate for the COP, it
hopes to have at least 10 candi

dates for senatorial positions.
"Since it's a new party, we didn't
want to spread ourselves too thin
by devoting four people to the
COP race," said freshman Kevin
Lewis, one of the founders.
The Unity party is comprised
predominantly of freshmen who
view the activities of the other
two parties as "misdirected," ac
cording to Lewis.
"The Stanford Unity party will
provide a common-ground posi
tion between the two extremes of
People's Platform and Students
First," said freshman Alison Al
ter, another Unity party sup
porter.
Liu of the People's Platform
slate feels that "our slate will fill

in the perceived voids that the
Stanford Unity Party has a prob
lem with."
Multiculturalism has been, and
will continue to be, one of the
principal issues for the People's
Platform. "This party was created
by students of color, and it derives
much of its support from this di
verse group," said Nava.
"There has never to my knowl
edge been as broad a representa
tion as exists on our slate," said
Liu.
The Students First party claims
it will be "working with the Uni
versity instead of against the Uni
versity," according to Marklein.
In the past, Students First has
urged that the ASSU focus more
on student services and less on
political bickering.
Marklein said the slate will also
emphasize mulitcultural reforms.
"The main difference," he said,
"is the way to achieve this
reform."
