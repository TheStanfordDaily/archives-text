# Vlahov does the job for Cardinal
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It seems people everywhere
have been having a field day
distributing credit for the Car
dinal basketball team's season.
While even the Stanford faith
ful had hopes for merely a .500
season, the Cardinal is cur
rently 16-10 going into the
regular-season finale at Cali
fornia Sunday.
Fans have been quick to tout
the coaching of Mike Mont
gomery, or the rebounding of
forward Adam Keefe, or the
outside shooting of the guards.
But somehow overlooked is the
team's third-leading scorer and
second-leading rebounder.
He also leads the team in
steals and is second in assists.
But despite the statistics, and
his 6-foot-7, 225-pound frame,
Andrew Vlahov has been al
most the forgotten man of
Stanford's season.
But after spending much of
the season switching back and
forth from small forward to
power forward, Vlahov has
upped his level of play the last
month as he has played the
power forward spot for more
and more time.
Vlahov is averaging 10.9
points and 7.5 rebounds a game
over the last eight contests and
is shooting .529 from the floor
in that time span. A big part
of the reason is he has been

more of a post-up player of late,
meaning he has taken better
percentage shots and has been
closer to the hoop for rebound
ing purposes.
"Except for the Arizona
game I've been playing a lot
more consistent, scoring and
rebounding," he said prior to
Wednesday night's game with
Cal. "I think my defense has
picked up a little too. I'm sure
[the position change] has had
something to do with it.. .. I
guess I can use my physical
attributes to my advantage. I'm
probably stronger than quick
er."
Vlahov is up to ninth in the
Pacific 10 Conference in
rebounding average for league
games and he's tied for fourth
in assists. After being a power
forward, or 4-man, almost ex
clusively while growing up in
Australia, Vlahov started the
season at small forward. But
he struggled with his outside
shot and Montgomery eventu
ally moved Vlahov to the blocks
and put Deshon Wingate on the
perimeter. With Wingate's
jumpshot improving dramati
cally this year and Vlahov being
a force on the glass, the results
have been all good for Stanford.
"We've done surprisingly
well for everybody 8 expecta
tions," Vlahov said. "I think
we've exceeded them some
what. Dick Vitale picked us 7-
