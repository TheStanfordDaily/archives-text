# Vlahov does the job for Cardinal
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It seems people everywhere
have been having a field day
distributing credit for the Car
dinal basketball team's season.
While even the Stanford faith
ful had hopes for merely a .500
season, the Cardinal is cur
rently 16-10 going into the
regular-season finale at Cali
fornia Sunday.
Fans have been quick to tout
the coaching of Mike Mont
gomery, or the rebounding of
forward Adam Keefe, or the
outside shooting of the guards.
But somehow overlooked is the
team's third-leading scorer and
second-leading rebounder.
He also leads the team in
steals and is second in assists.
But despite the statistics, and
his 6-foot-7, 225-pound frame,
Andrew Vlahov has been al
most the forgotten man of
Stanford's season.
But after spending much of
the season switching back and
forth from small forward to
power forward, Vlahov has
upped his level of play the last
month as he has played the
power forward spot for more
and more time.
Vlahov is averaging 10.9
points and 7.5 rebounds a game
over the last eight contests and
is shooting .529 from the floor
in that time span. A big part
of the reason is he has been

more of a post-up player of late,
meaning he has taken better
percentage shots and has been
closer to the hoop for rebound
ing purposes.
"Except for the Arizona
game I've been playing a lot
more consistent, scoring and
rebounding," he said prior to
Wednesday night's game with
Cal. "I think my defense has
picked up a little too. I'm sure
[the position change] has had
something to do with it.. .. I
guess I can use my physical
attributes to my advantage. I'm
probably stronger than quick
er."
Vlahov is up to ninth in the
Pacific 10 Conference in
rebounding average for league
games and he's tied for fourth
in assists. After being a power
forward, or 4-man, almost ex
clusively while growing up in
Australia, Vlahov started the
season at small forward. But
he struggled with his outside
shot and Montgomery eventu
ally moved Vlahov to the blocks
and put Deshon Wingate on the
perimeter. With Wingate's
jumpshot improving dramati
cally this year and Vlahov being
a force on the glass, the results
have been all good for Stanford.
"We've done surprisingly
well for everybody 8 expecta
tions," Vlahov said. "I think
we've exceeded them some
what. Dick Vitale picked us 7-
20. A lot of people picked us to
finish ninth or tenth in the Pac
-10. ... We've done an excellent
job.
"1 think this team gels together
well and we played defense well.
Our lack of offensive power has
been made up for by our ability
to shut them down as we 11.... I
guess we get kind of a kick out
of it when we shut a team down.
"Keefe and I liked the USC
game (two weeks ago) when we
shut down (Ronnie) Coleman and
(Chris Munk). Coleman had one
layup on a broken play and a free
throw and Munk didn't score at
all."
But while the Cardinal has
played excellent defensively — the
team leads the league in scoring
defense — the offense has
struggled.
The team is still trying to see
how good it can be, but with four
juniors and a sophomore in the
starting lineup, inexperience has
been a problem.
"We got a look at our potential
when we played the first half at
UCLA," Vlahov said. "At times
we tend to go into mental lapses
and that's what beats us. If we
did things, executed better, we
probably would have had more
wins.
"We could have had at least 20
wins easy. We weren't that far
away this year."
With the very young team,
Vlahov has found the position he
plays isn't the only adjustment he
makes. "As co-captain I felt
there's a lot of leadership I have
to display," he said.
"I guess I've had to take this
season more seriously. . . . On the
court I've tried to work hard and
play the best I can. . . . I've just
got to try to lead by example."


Damian MarhefVa — Daily
Stanford forward Andrew Vlahov has been the "Invisible Man" this season, quietly
having his best year ever. The junior from Australia has reestablished himself
as a powerful post player for the Cardinal.
