# Men's Basketball at California
## 
### 
OEJA VU - Sunday, live on Raycom channel 5 with a 3 p.m. tipoff
at Harmon Gym The ebullient and eloquent Pat Rollins will close
out the regular season for your listening pleasure on KZSU (90 1
FM) with help coming from the affable and amiable Brian W
Webber
RECORDS - Stanford (16-10, 8 9 in Pac-10 play), California (21-7,
12-5, ranked No 41 with one vote in the AP poll).
GOLDEN BEAR UPDATE â€” Keith Smith, the all-time career assist
leader on the other side of the Bay (he passed some guy named
Kevin Johnson last week), had a nightmarish first half Wednesday,
making 1-of-6 shots and committing five turnovers In the second
half, however, he was 6 of 7 and was the leader of the comeback
pack for the Bears
CARDINAL UPDATE - After the loss to Cal here, the Stanford players
are looking like they'll have plenty of time to study for finals unless
they do something Quick A win Sunday would definitely restore
hopes for an NIT bid, but falling to 16-11 would be quite the damper
NOTES - UCLA's win over Washington State tonight locked Stanford
into sixth place in the final Pac-10 standings Meanwhile, the Bears
win Wednesday clinched third place for them. Thus, the two teams
will meet a third time at 10 p.m. (MST) in the second round of the
Pac-10 Tournament, one week from today.
