# Hungry Cougars prowling for upset of Card spikers
## Streaking Stanford looks to stay No. 1 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
They're 3-5, playing in their first year of
NCAA competition, and coming to the home
turf of the No. 1-ranked Cardinal, unde
feated in the WFVA conference. But, despite
these factors, the last word one would use
to describe the Brigham Young Cougars is
" u nderesti mated."
"BYU is a young team, they are tall at
all positions, and they are a very good block
ing team," Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben
Nieves said. "They are an excellent team
and we have just got to be ready to play."
Judging from the recent performances of
the Cardinal, "ready to play" might be a
slightly mild description of the squad's ca
pability. Having won six straight conference
matches against ranked competition, Stan
ford will seek to tighten its grip of the na
tion's top ranking against BYU tonight at
7:30 in Burnham Pavilion.
Charged by a pivotal five-game triumph
over No. 3 Long Beach State on Saturday,
the Cardinal (now in sole possession of first
place in the Harry Wilson division) is on a
much-anticipated collision course with No.
2-ranked UCLA next week at Pauley Pavil
ion.

Stanford is doing its
best to make geniuses
of Volleyball Monthly,
which slated the Cardi
nal as this year's NCAA
champions.

But the Stanford squad has made it clear
that their minds are completely focused on
its immediate task. "I think the team
realizes," Nieves explained, "that we have
to be ready to play every night. I don't think
people pay enough attention to the lesser
known teams in our conference like LMU
and BYU who are excellent."
The Cougars have certainly justified such
comments this season. Depsite a losing
record, BYU can boast of a convincing
straight-game win over No. 8 San Diego
State. In that match, four of BYU's hitters
impressively hit over .350.
Stanford, meanwhile, is doing its best to

champions. After a disappointing season
opening loss to UCLA, the Cardinal has run
off six straight victories, beating Long Beach,
No. 5 Hawaii, No. 6 Northridge and No. 10
UC-Santa Barbara in the process.
Much of the credit for this success can be
directed in Ail-American middle blocker Dan
Hanan's direction. The 6-foot-5 senior pres
ently leads the team in kills (130) and blocks
(44) and is second to Duncan Blackman in
digs with 51.
Tonight, Coach Fred Sturm will have the
full services of both the Ryans. Setter Ryan
0' Hara and swing hitter Ryan Moos have
been practicing since their respective injuries
and are fully able to suit up.
