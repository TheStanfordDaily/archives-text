# Men's Volleyball vs. BYU
## 
### 
TONIGHT — 7:30 p.m. start at Burnham Pa
vilion.
RECORDS - Stanford (6-1, 6-0 in WIVA,
ranked No. 1), BYU (3-5, 1-3, ranked No. 13).
NOTES — Stanford comes off a critical five
game victory over No. 3 Long Beach State
and will look to continue its unbeaten con
ference streak against the No. 13 Cougars
BYU possesses a strong offensive attack
which hit at will against No 8 San Diego
State recently. A key to the game may be
the defensive chores of primary passers
Duncan Blackman and John Alstrom
