Sophomore tennis player Jason Yee spent
most of last weekend waiting.
But when his chance came, Y«e did more
than take advantage of it."He out and out
stole the show," Stanford Asst. Coach John
Whitlinger said.
After sitting on the bench for the first
three team matches at the ITCA/USTA
National Team Indoor Championships, Yee
keyed a convincing 6-1, 6-2 win at No. 3
doubles, which clinched the Indoor title for
the Cardinal.
Until the tournament finals against Cal
ifornia, Stanford had won at least five of
its singles matches, making doubles play
unnecessary. The Bears, however, won two
singles contests, forcing the match into
doubles play. That's when Yee stepped in
and, with Stanford's No. 2-ranked player,
Alex O'Brien, clinched the 5-2 win.
"It was great to see everyone playing so
well [during the Indoors]," Yee said. "Still,
I was pretty excited to get out there and
play. I was mentally pumped up for that
match. I concentrated well and was very
aggressive."
But winning big matches is nothing new
to Yee, who beat UCLA's No. 1-ranked
player, Jason Netter, 7-5, 7-6, at the Na
tional Collegiate Classic in Palm Dessert
earlier this year.
"That win really helped my confidence.
It showed me that I could play with the
top guys," said Yee, who was ranked No.
33 in the country his final year in the
18-and-under junior division.
For the top-ranked, talent-laden Cardi
nal, however, much of Yee's worth lies in

his versatility. "Jason is an extremely ver
satile player, which makes him so valuable
in doubles," Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said.
"He can stay back and play defense, but
he also can come in and play offensively.
The other guys like to play with him be
cause he is so quick at the net. He does
a great job of scraping and staying in the
points as well," Gould added.
Yee agreed, saying that doubles suits his
style of game. "When I was in the juniors,
I didn't play much doubles, but I liked it
a lot," Yee said. "Doubles suits my game
really well. I like to be aggressive and be
on the net."
Despite his success this year, Yee is not
satisfied with certain aspects of his game.
"Overall, I'm hoping I can develop my serve
a lot more. I also would like to start serving
and volleying more," Y'ee said. "Developing
consistency all around is important, too."
In the meantime, Yee, who Gould calls
"one of the most improved players on the
team," looks forward to contributing as
much as he can to the Cardinal. "I would
like to play a lot more college tennis and
help Stanford as much as I can," said Yee.
