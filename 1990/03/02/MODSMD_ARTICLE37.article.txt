# Injured Ryan is nation's best gymnast
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Until last week, one only needed
to travel as far as Stanford's own
Burnham Pavilion to see the top
gymnast in the nation perform.
That was before defending U.S.
champion Tim Ryan became the
latest victim of the Cardinal's
most menacing enemy this season:
injury.
After suffering from what he
believed to be chronic tendonitis
since September, the sophomore
recently discovered that he has
been practicing and competing
with a broken wrist. If surgery is
prescribed, the team all-around
leader may be put out of commis
sion until next fall.
"This was definitely not on my
list of things to have happen," he
commented wryly "I would rather
deal with it now, though, than
have it crop up again later."
In the meantime, the Cardinal's
chances for retaining its unde
feated record seem to be diminish
ing. The team's depth has already
been hampered by injuries to
junior Tim Wang, freshman
Shawn Adamek and junior Adam
For man.
"This weekend I only have four
guys healthy enough to compete
on floor and vault, so I've had to
bring in two people to fill in,"
Coach Sadao Hamada said.
On the other hand, the Cardinal
was able to defeat top Pacific 10
Conference rival UCLA last week
without Ryan's contributions. It
remains unclear whether his loss
will put a halt to the momentum
the team has been building up
since January.
While there is little doubt that
his injury will overshadow this
season, Ryan's past has been
studded with outstanding
performances. Since his begin

nings in the sport at age 10, he
has always competed at a level
one step ahead of his age group.
As a freshman in high school,
Ryan became a member of the
prestigious Junior National Team.
He repeated the feat as a junior
and subsequently earned a spot
on the Senior Developmental na
tional team. By the time he was
a junior in high school, for exam
ple, he had moved up to the Elite
level, which is normally achieved
by high school seniors or collegiate
gymnasts.
Faced with a myriad of colleges
eager to recruit him, Ryan chose
Stanford because he had always
been interested in the school, and
the gymnastics club seemed to be
competitive with perennial pow
erhouses UCLA and Nebraska.
Now that he is here, he feels that
both the atmosphere and the gym
facilities are superior.
"I definitely made the optimum
choice," he said.
According to Hamada, Ryan has
contributed a lot to the team. "He
is a very determined individual.
He has an idea of what he needs
to do to achieve his goals, and he
gets the job done," he said.
Indeed, last year he got the job
done exceptionally well. He came
away from his third U.S. Cham
pionship with the national all
around title. True to form, at age
18 he was the youngest gymnast
to do so in 14 years.
Ryan considers this to be the
highlight of his career. It was
complemented by a trip to Stutt
gart, West Germany to compete
in the World Championships,
where he finished 31st overall.
"Representing the U.S., Stan
ford, and myself and competing
on the same level as people I had
read about in magazines was quite
a thrill," he said.
