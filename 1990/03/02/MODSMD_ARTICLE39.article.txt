The way to the San Jose
State/Patty Sheehan Invita
tional actually leads to Mon
terey, as the Stanford women's
golf team travels to the pictur
esque coastal village for today's
opening round of competition.
In hosting their annual tour
nament, San Jose State pays
homage to alumna Sheehan,
who is one of the finest players
ever to grace the LPGA tour.
The event sports the
strongest competition the Car
dinal will face prior to the
NCAA Championships in June.
The 15-team field boats nine
of the top ten teams in the
nation and includes such per
ennial powers as No.l-ranked

San Jose, the defending na
tional champion, the Golden
Hurricane of Tulsa, and
Arizona.
The Cardinal is currently
ranked seventh in the country
and seeks to improve in this
54-hole event. Stanford coach
Tim Baldwin was candid in as
sessing the importance of this
weekend's tournament.
"It's obviously crucial for the
team because we are playing
against the very best," he said.
The Cardinal linksters seek
to tame the demanding
Bayonet Course at Fort Ord.
In terms of United States Golf
Association course ratings, this
is the most difficult 18 holes
the team will face this year.
