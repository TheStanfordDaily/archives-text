# Hospital expresses disappointment
## Contract negotiations stalled 
### Cecilia Tom Staff writer 
Stanford Hospital's contract ne
gotiations with the nurses' union
came to a standstill yesterday as
the two sides traded accusations.
The parties did not agree to
meet again before Monday, the
day union members will vote on
whether to strike.
The Committee for Recognition
of Nursing Achievement, the
union representing 1,400 nurses,
gave formal notice Wednesday of
an intent to strike March 12. In
a letter sent yesterday to all hospi
tal employees, Hospital President
Kenneth Bloem expressed "deep
disappointment" at the issuance
of the strike notice.
A new federal mediator, Ruth
Carpenter, was brought in to help
the negotiations. According to
Priscilla Wheeler, staff counsel
and chief negotiator for the hospi
tal, a mediator's presence is man
dated by law because a strike
notice has been issued.
Union spokesperson Donalda

Dunnett said the union wants a
contract that will keep the nurse
patient ratio at a reasonable level
so as not to compromise patient
safety.
However, Wheeler said the
union did not cite staffing as a
safety issue before yesterday. The
union "has never mentioned that
on the bargaining table before,"
she said.
Dunnett said the issue of safety
was definitely on the table. "The
proposal is that they would not
reduce the nursing staff below a
certain level," she said. "That was
what the proposal was for."
Malinda Mitchell, acting chief
operating officer, said the hospi
tal's nurse-patient ratio is well
above that of other area hospitals
and is in fact higher than that of
many hospitals at academic insti
tutions.
Wheeler said the union's strike
notice failed to mention the hospi
tal's intent to streamline opera
tions. The hospital announced in
January that it will cut its $320

million budget by $27 million this
year.
"I simply do not agree with I the
union's] characterization. It's very
troubling," Wheeler added.
Dunnett said the hospital's
wage proposals allowed a smaller
percentage increase for the most
experienced nurses, which has
been deemed unfair by the nurses.
According to Wheeler, the current
wage offer would pay senior staff
nurses $24.70 an hour, a rate
which exceeds the current maxi
mum rate for all other Bay Area
hospitals.
Wheeler said a strike would be
disastrous. The union's "unwill
ingness to meet given the the sub
sequent strike notice is a
disservice to Stanford, particu
larly since [its] attorney, Ken Ab
salom, indicated on Feb. 22 that
he would be unavailable for meet
ings on March 1 and 2."
Wheeler added that the hospital
is going to be working hard to
get a reasonable settlement, but
that it cannot be a one-sided ef
fort.
