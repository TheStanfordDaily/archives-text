Cardinal, Bears to
try for NCAA times
In an effort to make the rich
just a little bit richer, two Stan
ford swimmers will compete in
the Stanford Invitational this
weekend. The meet, which
serves as a last chance for
swimmers to record qualifying
times for the NCAA Champi
onships, begins at 1 p.m. to
morrow at deGuerre Pool.
In addition to Stanford soph
omore J.T. Toton and fresh
man Anne Mahoney, several
California swimmers will jour
ney across the Bay to compete
in the meet, which will basi
cally be a series of time trials.
Each team can take 18 swim
mers to the NCAA meet, and
since a diver only counts as
half a swimmer (no one knows
why), teams generally take one
or two divers and 17 swimmers.
To qualify for the NCAA meet,
a swimmer has to swim faster
than a specific time in an event.
Once a swimmer qualifies in
one event, she can qualify to
swim in up to two more, by
beating a somewhat slower
time in the other events she
wishes to swim. The Cardinal
has already qualified a full
complement of 17 swimmers
for the meet, but Toton has
only met the standards in two
events and Mahoney has qual
ified in one event.
Toton will swim the 200-yard
individual medley in an effort
to add that event to the 100
and 200 breaststrokes, events
she has already qualified in.
Mahoney qualified in the 100
backstroke at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships
last weekend but is looking to
add two more events. She will
swim the 50 freestyle and
either the 200 backstroke or
the 100 freestyle.
Stanford, the nation's top
ranked team, won last year's
NCAA title, the Cardinal's first
since 1982. The Golden Bears
are ranked fourth nationally
and were the runners-up to the
Cardinal at the Pac-10 meet
last weekend. They finished
fifth at NCAAs last year.

Women's gymnastics
to battle top teams
When the Stanford women's
gymnastics team competes in
the Cal State-Fullerton Invita
tional tonight, it will be a
homecoming of sorts for
several members of the squad.
Freshman Danielle Leone
will be competing in southern
California for the first time as
a collegian. Leone, from nearby
Rancho Palos Verdes, will be
returning to the area in which
she won the CIF Southern Cal
ifornia High School Champion
ship in 1988.
For senior Dina Amoroso, the
tie to Fullerton is even closer.
Amoroso is from Placentia, a
neighbor of Fullerton, and she
was highly recruited by the
state university there.
Stanford will have its hands
full in this meet as the Cardinal
faces three teams ranked ahead
of it in the NCAA computer
rankings. The host Titans,
ranked 11th, are the meet
favorites, followed by Penn
State (16th), Boise State (21st),
and Stanford (30th). Stanford
can even the regular season se

ries with Boise State at two
victories each with a win over
the Broncos.

Track races to Irvine
While track and field director
Brooks Johnson has lately re
ceived a good deal of press for
his contributions to the wom
en's basketball team, also been
preparing his own squad for
the long seaaon ahead. That
season begins tomorrow in Ir
vine with a "double dual meet"
against Cal State-Northridge
and UC-Irvine.
For the new reduced-budget
track and field program, to
morrow's meet is a significant
one. Johnson said that, partly
due to the new cuts, the team
will be "segueing out of the
situation" where the emphasis
has been on individual NCAA
performances and into a more
team, dual meet-oriented
season.
He cited efforts to recruit for
more depth, as opposed to the
old philosophy of concentrating
recruiting energy on a few
stars.
But on the more immediate
horizon, the Cardinal should
have a chance to test their abil
ities against some decent com
petition this weekend, as nei
ther Irvine nor Northridge are
exactly pushover teams. How
ever, Johnson says, "if we do
like we did last weekend (at
the Bay Area Relays)," Stan
ford should take home the
highest scores.

Fencers in regional
The Cardinal men's and
women's fencing teams will be
looking to cut through the com
petition as they defend their
Western Regional Champion
ship titles this weekend at
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
women are favored to take
their seventh consecutive
championship and set a new
Sports Illustrated record in the
process.
Both Stanford squads are
coming off their most impres
sive road trip of the year as
they went undefeated to
retained the Pac-10 Invita
tional Championship at.
two weeks ago.
"All of our young fencers
gained a lot of confidence in
the past two weeks," said Zoran
Tulum, men's coach. "We
should do extremely well."
The toughest competition for
the women's team will be the
squad from UC-Santa Cruz. Al
though the Cardinal has al
ready defeated the Banana
Slugs twice this season, the last
meet was decided in Stanford's
favor based on indicators after
an 8-8 final bout tally.
"As for individuals, any one
of our girls could win it, " said
women's Coach Sherry Pos
thumus.
Tulum said that the men
have an excellent chance of
defending their title. "Our
team was very young this year
and I expected to have a rough
season," said Tulum. "They've
worked hard and a new spirit
of team unity has prepared
them for this weekend."
"If we do well, we should be
the best represented university
at NCAA's," he added.
