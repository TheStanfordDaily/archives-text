# Flaws and virtues
## Greek advocate dispels 'Animal House' image 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
From crushing beer cans to
raising millions of dollars for can
cer research, the various aspects
of Greek life were touched on by
Greek advocate Will Keim in a
speech at Kresge Auditorium last
night.
Keim, a former professor at
Oregon State University, has
amused and motivated audiences
at more than 500 college cam
puses. Last night he made his
first Stanford appearance as part
of Greek Week.
A fraternity man himself, Keim
exchanged knowing glances with
the predominantly Greek audi

ence as he discussed the virtues
and flaws of the Greek system.
Keim said the popular film
"Animal House" has regrettably
become "a kind of a training film
for Greeks," by glorifying
reprehensible behavior.
Providing a strong contrast to
the image portrayed in the movie,
Keim's idea of a strong Greek or
ganization combines six crucial
components: leadership,
brotherhood, sisterhood, commu
nity service, scholarship and a re
sponsible social life.
Several aspects of the social life
at Stanford concerned Keim.
"The fact that Stanford still has
a 'wet Rush' baffles my imagina
tion," said Keim. "It's a dinosaur

in the Greek world."
Keim also regretted the preva
lence of open parties at Stanford
and offered a solution to the
charges of elitism that accompany
closed party practices here.
"How do you get rid of elitism?"
Keim asked. "Diversify your guest
list and make sure Rush is open
to everyone."
Keim lauded Stanford as one of
the most ethnically diverse Greek
audiences he has addressed. How
ever, he emphasized that minor
ities are vastly underrepresented
in the Greek system and that
diversification is necessary for the
survival and enrichment of the
system.
