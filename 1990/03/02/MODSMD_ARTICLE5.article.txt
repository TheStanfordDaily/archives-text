# Quake-damaged houses to receive temporary homes
## 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
Three unspecified campus
houses will become the temporary
replacement homes next fall for
three earthquake-damaged
houses which will remain closed
for at least another year.
The University has pledged to
re-establish the displaced commu
nities of the Synergy and Phi Psi
co-ops and the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity within existing campus
residences while the original
houses are being rebuilt. Rumors
about the choice of replacement
houses have sparked concern
among current residents of Row
houses and Cowell Cluster houses,
which are the primary candidates.
Although she would not name
specific residences, Row director
Diana Conklin said the void would
most likely be filled with "Row
type houses." The final choices
will be announced late next week.
The displaced co-op and frater
nal programs "will be operational
next fall in 9ome house," assured
Rodger Whitney, director of
housing. "We are planning to have
the same program options — the
same nurrfber of co-ops — opera
tional next fall as we did last fall,"
he said.
To accommodate these plans,
the three houses will be chosen
based upon both their physical
facilities and their traditional
dorm programming.
First, the size and occupancy
of the chosen buildings must be
consistent with the sizes of the
closed houses. The buildings must
also be equipped with kitchen fa
cilities compatible with co-op and
fraternity systems, Conklin said.
This means that the non
fraternity Row houses and Cowell
Cluster houses are prime choices
because their facilities best meet
these requirements.
The second consideration will

be to "spread the
burden of the
earthquake's af
termath across
different kinds of
houses," Conklin
said. Because of
the earthquake's
disproportionate
on the co-op
community, the

remaining campus co-ops are not
considered as likely to be chosen
as the replacement houses.
Existing theme houses would
not be candidates for replacement
houses either, Whitney said. "It
isn't likely that we would put a
house into a house where there
is a thriving program already in
place."
Allen Symonds, resident assis
tant in 553 Mayfield, said he
heard the rumor that his resi
dence is a possible replacement
house because it is located on the
Row and, most importantly, it is
not a theme house and has "no
heavy traditions." However, he
said that he has heard no official
word from the University on this
matter.
Conklin said the RAs in the
chosen dorms have not yet been
approached by anyone making the
decision. This will be done some
time next week, she said.
The relocation of the three dis
placed communities "would be for
just a year — not beyond that,"
said Conklin, since the original
houses are scheduled to re-open
in the fall of 1991.
The changes are not expected
to cause problems in the Draw
this spring, according to Whitney,
because 125 spaces added afler
the earthquake will be designated
as real student rooms and will be
assigned in the annual housing
lottery. "Our goal is to try to have
as many spaces for undergradu
ates this fall as we do now," he
said.
