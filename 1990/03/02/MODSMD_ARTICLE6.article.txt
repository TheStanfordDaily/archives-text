# Pledging process under review
## Black frats, sororities may have to abandon traditions 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
Much to their dismay, Stan
ford's five black fraternities and
sororities could be forced to do
away with their pledge process
es.
Motivated by concerns over
hazing, the National Pan-
Hellenic Council, an organiza
tion of representatives from
black fraternities and sororities,
has created a resolution to elim
inate pledging. The issue will
be voted on by each national
fraternity and sorority at its
next annual or biennial conven
tion.
Fraternal affairs adviser Mi
chael Hughes said that frater
nities and sororities that adopt
the measure will have to find
other means of incorporating
the "learning and accultura
tion" that usually take place
during pledging.
John Meigs, president of

'Without pledging,
our groups are just
another organiza
tion.'

Kappa Alpha Psi, called the idea
"ridiculous." According to
Meigs, the idea stems mainly
from financial concerns because
black fraternities have recently
had a lot of problems with law
suits over hazing incidents.
The Pan-Hellenic Council has
therefore decided to "abandon
the pledge process, rather than
to reform it," Meigs said. He is
upset because the council has
"given up a time-tested way for
initiating quality members
without coming up with an al
ternate plan."
Sharisse Kimbro, president of
Alpha Kappa Alpha, agreed that
the pledge process is valuable.

On the other hand, she ac
knowledged, "Lots of people feel
hazing has been something
which is a problem."
Duru Ahanotu, president of
the Stanford African-American
Fraternal and Sororal Associa
tion, said concerns about hazing
are valid. But, he said, elimi
nating pledging would be "flirt
ing with disaster."
"Without pledging, our
groups are just another organ
ization where you come to a
meeting and sign up," Ahanotu
said.
William Faucette, president of
Omega Psi Phi, said the idea of
eliminating pledging has "posi
tives and negatives." Putting
emphasis on membership,
rather than the pledge process,
is good, but in many cases the
pledge process is necessary, lie
said. The process prepares
people to be members and al
lows members to get to know
the pledges, he said.
