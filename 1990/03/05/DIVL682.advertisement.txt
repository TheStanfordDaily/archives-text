Advance praise for Valuation
"Shareholder value will be die name of the game for managers in
the 1990s —and for that game, this will be the rule book. Valua
tion is die single best guide to economic value analysis I've seen.
Nobody who is evaluating a potential acquisition, corporate re
structuring, or corporate strategic plan should be without diis
book."
-Charles D. Miller
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Avery
"Books on difficult subjects rarely achieve their goals completely.
Tliis one does. Valuation takes the reader over difficult terrain in
an easy-to-read, comprehensive and instructive manner. Practi
tioners of all sorts will find Part Three in particular extremely
useful."
— Arthur Zeikel, President,
Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.
"PepsiCo has been using the shareholder value approach for stra
tegic, capital, acquisition, financing, and even operating decisions
for a number of years. This bixik will clearly be useful for quickly
training new managers in die theory and practice of valuation."
