Professor of Romance Languages and Comparative Literature at
Duke University, will deliver a public lecture on
AFRICAN INTELLECTUALS AND AFRICAN
CULTURES: PRESENCE AFRICAINE 1947-1987
"Until now Western interpreters as well as African analysts (of Africa) have been using . . conceptual
systems which depend on a Western epistemological order. Even in the most "AfYrxrentric"
descriptions, . . models of analysis explicitly or implicity . refer to the same order. Does this
necessarily imply another epistemological shift?"
The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge, 1988. Co-recipient of
the 1989 African Studies Association's Herskovitc Award as the
Most Distinguished Scholarly Work on Africa.
