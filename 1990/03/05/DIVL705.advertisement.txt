The greater the diversity of the RA staff, the greater the likelihood that issues of
race, ethnicity, and cross-cultural interaction will be discussed in the
residences. If you wish to discuss RA responsibilities, compensation, or the
time commitment, call Alice Supton or Clare Dolan at 725-2800.
Interested applicants are invited to attend an optional informational meeting

address specific concerns and issues.
