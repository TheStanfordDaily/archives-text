# Rush violations could be costly
## Breaking rules will result in fine 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council
made several changes to its Rush
regulations last week, violations
of which could cost a fraternity
up to $1,000.
The revised guidelines require
rushee registration, parties with
door monitors and less time to
serve alcohol, and a new bid dis
tribution system. They also pro
vide for an enforcement
mechanism for fraternities that
violate Rush regulations.
For the first time, all men who
intend to rush will be required to
attend an informational meeting
where they will register as rus
hees.
"1 strongly feel that there's a
spot in the fraternity system for
everyone," said Erik Jorgensen,
IFC vice president and Rush chair.
"We're really trying to get that
message out."
Prospective pledges may find
the Rush process easier this year,
due to alterations in the bid dis
tribution process.
In past years, a specific day and
time were designated when fra
ternities could begin "picking up"
their pledges.
Under this system, men who
were receiving two or even three

bids were at a disadvantage be
cause they were frequently
coerced into pledging the first fra
ternity which visited them, un
aware of other bids they might
have received, according to IFC
President Todd Ortega.
The amended process requires
fraternities to contact each rushee
during the afternoon on the des
ignated day to tell him if he is
being offered a bid. It is then up
to each individual rushee to re
spond to the fraternity he intends
to pledge.
Fraternities can "pick up" a
pledge only after they have been
contacted by him. This system is
expected to eliminate the problem
of fraternities "jumping the gun"
in picking up their pledges, ac
cording to Ortega.
According to Jorgensen, the bid
distribution system has caused
significant problems in the past.
For instance, last year members
of one fraternity entered the
pledge party of another, seized a
rushee and carried him out over
their heads, claiming he was plan
ning to pledge their fraternity.
Several party practices which
violated IFC guidelines have also
been prohibited in the new Rush
guidelines.
Although IFC guidelines re
quire door monitors to check
Stanford IDs at all fraternity
parties, Rush parties have tradi
tionally been viewed as the excep
tion to this rule.
Because they are held on week
days and are generally smaller
than other parties, the need for
fraternities to monitor admission
during Rush has been under
played, according to Jorgensen.
However, this policy has caused
conflicts with University officials.
Since Rush coincides with Pro
spective Freshman Week, many
rushees have brought "pro fros"
with them to the parties.
The new guidelines address this
conflict by requiring stricter mon
itoring at parties, with special at
tention paid to the exclusion of
"pro fros."
According to IFC Rush guide
lines, alcohol cannot be served in
the last hour of a party, but again,
Rush parties have historically

Rush parties will end
earlier, exclusion of
pro fros will be
closely monitored
and IDs will be
checked.

been viewed as the exception to
the rule. Since they must end at
midnight, several hours earlier
than most other parties, the IFC
traditionally set 11:30 as the
cutoff time for serving alcohol at
Rush parties.
On a recommendation from
fraternal affairs adviser Michael
Hughes, however, the IFC will
now require fraternities to stop
serving alcohol half an hour ear
lier, at 11 p.m.
Fraternities who violate any of
the guidelines will face fines up
to $1,000. In the past, no organ
ized system was arranged by
which these penalties could be
decided, but judgment on such
cases will now be deferred to the
IFC judicial board.
