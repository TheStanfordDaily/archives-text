# Rush violations could be costly
## Breaking rules will result in fine 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council
made several changes to its Rush
regulations last week, violations
of which could cost a fraternity
up to $1,000.
The revised guidelines require
rushee registration, parties with
door monitors and less time to
serve alcohol, and a new bid dis
tribution system. They also pro
vide for an enforcement
mechanism for fraternities that
violate Rush regulations.
For the first time, all men who
intend to rush will be required to
attend an informational meeting
where they will register as rus
hees.
"1 strongly feel that there's a
spot in the fraternity system for
everyone," said Erik Jorgensen,
IFC vice president and Rush chair.
"We're really trying to get that
message out."
Prospective pledges may find
the Rush process easier this year,
due to alterations in the bid dis
tribution process.
In past years, a specific day and
time were designated when fra
ternities could begin "picking up"
their pledges.
Under this system, men who
were receiving two or even three

bids were at a disadvantage be
cause they were frequently
coerced into pledging the first fra
ternity which visited them, un
aware of other bids they might
have received, according to IFC
President Todd Ortega.
The amended process requires
fraternities to contact each rushee
during the afternoon on the des
ignated day to tell him if he is
being offered a bid. It is then up
to each individual rushee to re
spond to the fraternity he intends
to pledge.
Fraternities can "pick up" a
pledge only after they have been
contacted by him. This system is
expected to eliminate the problem
of fraternities "jumping the gun"
in picking up their pledges, ac
cording to Ortega.
According to Jorgensen, the bid
distribution system has caused
significant problems in the past.
For instance, last year members
of one fraternity entered the
pledge party of another, seized a
rushee and carried him out over
their heads, claiming he was plan
ning to pledge their fraternity.
Several party practices which
violated IFC guidelines have also
been prohibited in the new Rush
guidelines.
