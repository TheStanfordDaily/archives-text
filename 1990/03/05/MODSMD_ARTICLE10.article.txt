Few graduate in four years
Only 15 percent of students at four-year
colleges examined in a recent survey grad
uated in four years, and less than half had
received a bachelor's degree after six years.
Minorities fared worse, with only 24 per
cent of blacks and 20 percent of Hispanics
completing a bachelor's in six years.
Within six years of entering, 63 percent
of black students and 54 percent of Hispanic
students enrolled in four-year colleges had
dropped out for good.
The study was conducted by The National
Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities, using U.S. Department of Ed
ucation data on 28,000 1980 high school
graduates.
The report stated that graduating from
college in four years is no longer the norm.
Many students take fewer classes in order
to work to pay their bills or to earn better
grades and improve their chances of grad
uate school admittance, the report said.
It also stated that those enrolled in private
institutions were more likely to graduate

than those in public universities, with 54
and 43 percent, respectively, earning a
degree in six years.
Group explores health options
The Alternative Health Collective, a new
medical student group dedicated to broaden
ing student knowledge on non-traditional
healing techniques, will be launching the
first of a lecture series titled "Laughter,
Herbs and Mantras" this Thursday.
The group was created by Deirdre Pearl,
Karen Seed and some other first-year med
ical students who feel that the standard
medical curriculum is not adequate in ex
posing students to alternative health meth
ods such as herbal remedies, acupuncture
and acupressure, meditation, and yoga.
The purpose of the group is to make people
realize "that it's not just the body that gets
sick, but the whole person," said Seal. "We
believe that many of these techniques help
empower us to prevent disease and promote
health by encouraging lifestyle changes that
enhance the quality of our spiritual, mental
and physical lives."

"The most revolutionary act one can com
mit in our world is to be happy," said Dr.
Patch Adams, who will speak Thursday at
noon in Fairchild Auditorium. Adams is the
founder and director of the Gesundheit In
stitute in Virginia, whose mandate is the
provision of free medical care.
The lecture series is not just for medical
students. "We're expecting to find a general
interest among Stanford students and fac
ulty on issues about health care and alter
natives," said Seal.

Three engineers honored
Three Stanford professors have been
named to the prestigious National Academy
of Engineering. They are Gene Golub, pro
fessor of computer science; Alan Manne,
professor of operations research; and Brad
ford Parkinson, research professor in aero
nautics and astronautics and at the Hansen
Laboratories.
They bring to 62 the number of Stanford
professors who are members of the academy.
