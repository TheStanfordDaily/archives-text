Mine explodes in tunnel
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A mine ex
ploded yesterday while soldiers were exploring
a tunnel allegedly dug under the border by
North Korea, killing a sentry dog but causing
no other casualties, officials said.
The army temporarily halted the search,
which began Saturday after engineers drilled
into the newly discovered tunnel in the
Demilitarized Zone. It was the fourth under
ground passageway found in the DMZ, and
military officials said they thought there were
about 20 more.
"North Korea intends to break through our
front line on the strength of their superior
mobility and fire power, advance speedily be
hind our forward areas and occupy Seoul
quickly," an official statement said.
The statement said tunnels were an "integral
component of its (North Korea's) military
strategy for quick action and quick victory"
and were intended to "quickly neutralize our
major front-line units."
