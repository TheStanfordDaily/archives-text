## Soviets elect parliaments in the republics 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) Millions of Soviets
from the Polish border to the Bering
Struit voted yesterday in what Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev said was a
struggle between reform and bureau
cracy for the country's Slavic
heartland.
"I think it is a battle," Gorbachev
told reporters after voting in the Lenin
Hills area of Moscow, "but I am con
vinced that perestroika will win."
Almost 150 million voters were reg
istered to choose among more than
11,000 candidates for 1,800 seats in
the legislatures of the Russian, Uk
rainian and Byelorussian republics.
Thousands of seats in local governing
councils also were being contested.
In the Baltic republic of Lithuania,
meanwhile, pro-independence activists
said results in runofT elections yester
day assured them of the quorum they
need to convene the republic's parlia
ment, where activists are expected to
push for creating a mechanism to
secede from the Soviet Union.
Officials reported a strong turnout
in the Far East region and the Uk
raine, where more than half of regis
tered voters had been to polling sta
tions before noon. Polls were open
from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
There was increased political tension
over Gorbachev's reforms in the weeks
leading to the elections.
In the Slavic republics, reforms ,
where they have managed to get
started , have proceeded more slowly
and quietly than in other areas. There
have been neither the concerted drives
of the Baltic republics nor the violence
of the Caucasus and Central Asia.
"Our elections involve a new type
of people, people who have been given
new impetus from perestroika," a
relaxed, confident Gorbachev said.
"The essence of it is that it is a people's
referendum on perestroika."
Responding to reporters' questions
as he left the polling station at the
Institute of Chemical Physics, the So
viet leader said it was not particularly
important whether the victors were
Communist Party members.
In Russia alone, the ballot contained

25 heads of regional Communist Party
organizations and 36 chairmen or dep
uty chairmen of autonomous regions
within the giant republic.
Voters in the Ukraine selected a 450-
member Supreme Soviet legislature,
Byelorussia chose a 310-member
legislature and Russia elected a 1,068-
member congress that will choose a
legislature and leadership from among
its members.
Voters on the Kamchatka Peninsula
of the Soviet Far East, who were
among the first to go to the polls, had
as many as 12 candidates to choose
from for each seat. In Leningrad, 280
candidates were seeking 34 seats.
About 3,000 candidates in the Uk
raine were vying for 450 seats in the
republic's Supreme Soviet, and in
Byelorussia there was an average of
five candidates for each seat.
Vitaly Boiko, chairman of the Uk
rainian election commission, said from
Kiev that as of 6 p.m. more than 80
percent of the 37 million voters had
gone to the polls.
"In my opinion, it's explained by the
fact that people want perestroika to
go faster, they want the formation of
the new organs of Soviet power to be
completed," he said.
Ivan Likhach, official of Byelorus
sian election commission, said from
Minsk that about half the eligible
voters had been to the polls by noon,
and turnout was running ahead of last
March's elections.
Balloting in the Slavic republics fol
lowed an election in the Baltic republic
of Lithuania swept by candidates en
dorsed by the pro-independence
Sajudis movement, and several other
republics.
Observers have speculated that
Sajudis wants a quick parliament ses
sion so Lithuania can vote to secede
from the Soviet Union before Gorba
chev gains his expected broad new
powers, which include the right to
suspend republic parliaments and send
in troops.
The Soviet Congress meets next
Monday to consider Gorbachev's pro
posal.


Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev casts his vote yesterday at a polling
station. The Soviets are voting for local councils and republic parliaments
in Russia, the Ukraine and Byelorussia.
