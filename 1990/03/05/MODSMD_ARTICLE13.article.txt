# Kohl hedges on Polish issue, will not commit

WEST BERLIN (AP) - Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of West Germany is
embroiled in controversy over his
refusal to categorically accept the
Polish-German border set at the end
of World War 11.
It has become a political issue;
recognition of the boundary could cost
Kohl votes in the December West Ger
man election. But his failure to
renounce any future attempt to regain
former territories lost in the war could
delay German reunification.
Kohl has come under attack from

Poland, from the World War II Allies
and from the opposition in West Ger
many and even in his own Cabinet for
failing to give an unequivocal promise
on the border.
There have been demonstrations in
Poland in support of Polish demands
to take part in talks on reunification.
But the chancellor faces consider
able political risk if he declares the
current border inviolable.
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union
is running only a couple of percentage
points ahead of the opposition Social

Democrats in public opinion polls.
The CDU traditionally has enjoyed
the backing of conservative West Ger
mans, including millions of exiles from
territories now governed by Poland
and the Soviet Union.
More than 12 million ethnic Ger
mans were driven from Silesia and
East Prussia after the Third Reich
was vanquished. The lands east of the
Oder and Neisse rivers that were Ger
man before the war are now Polish
territory, comprising about one-third
of modern day Poland.

If Kohl agrees to give up the lands,
he could alienate those voters who pro
vide his party's narrow lead over the
Social Democrats.
However, Kohl's equivocating has
cost the CDU support in East Ger
many, where the Social Democrats are
expected to win a majority in March
18 elections.
Recognition of the current German-
Polish boundary is likely to be one of
the prices of unification demanded by
the World War II Allies, who will have
a say in the shape of a united Germany.
