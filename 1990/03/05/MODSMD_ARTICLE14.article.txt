Rooney reinstated
NEW YORK (AP) — Andy Rooney
returned yesterday to "60 Minutes"
after a three-week suspension, saying
he was worried he'd be wrongly
remembered as a racist for remarks
he says he didn't make.
Rooney was suspended by CBS
without pay on February 8 but
reinstated three weeks later.
Back at his usual show-ending slot,
Rooney said it was demeaning to
defend himself because he had a long
history of supporting civil rights. He

said he didn't know how to apologize
to homosexuals for a comment he
made last year that he hadn't realized
would be offensive.
