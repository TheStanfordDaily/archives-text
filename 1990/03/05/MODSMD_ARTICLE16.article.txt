## A 						shaky solution 
### 
TWO WRONGS DON'T make
a right, but some in Resi
dential Affairs seem to think
they do.
Officials said last week that
three student residences — most
likely Row or Cowell Cluster
houses — will serve as temporary
replacements for the earthquake
damaged houses that will remain
closed next year.
Two co-ops, Synergy and Phi Psi,
and the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
will be operational in some house
next fall, officials have said. And
the situation will last only for a
year, until the quake-damaged
houses are repaired.
The University's commitment to
maintaining co-op and housed fra
ternity communities is to be ap
plauded. Members of those com
munities had feared that the quake
would provide a convenient excuse
for the University to cut down on
the number of non-University
operated residences, and this latest
decision should allay those fears.

But turning other houses into
temporary co-ops or fraternities is
a dubious solution to the housing
problem.
The houses targeted as possible
replacements are mostly self-ops,
many of which have established
strong traditions themselves.
Given the number of students
who seek the self-op living situa
tion, why are these students' con
cerns considered second to those
of co-op and fraternity members?
By effectively displacing another
group of students from their
desired living situation, housing of
ficials are just creating a second
headache for themselves as well as
for the students.
Co-op residents still displaced
next year have the option of find
ing housing in any of the five other
co-ops that will be open. And the
displaced fraternity members can
find housing through normal Draw
procedures.
As the housing officials them
selves say, it's only for a year.
