# Recycle this paper
## 
### 
THE BURDEN OF saving the
environment falls squarely
on the shoulders of everyone
at this university.
Sophomore Scott Veirs under
stands this. For eight weeks Veirs
has been carrying the garbage he
produces around with him.
Although the average Stanford
student throws away about 3.8
pounds of trash each and every
day, Veirs has accumulated only
half a pound after six weeks.
He — and freshman Alex
Cronin, who is doing the same
thing — has learned how to
manage carefully how much gar
bage he produces. He has learned
to use only recyclable materials
when possible.

More students should take their
lead, and University staff should
follow by looking hard at ways to
encourage more recycling.
The Office of the President
might just be the perfect model to
cut waste. Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford pulled
trash from dumpsters around
campus to see how much could be
recycled, and the president's office
came up with little recyclable ma
terial.
Of 17 pounds of garbage thrown
into the dumpster, only two-and
a-half pounds were recyclable. Of
17 pounds taken from Casa Zapata
and Burbank House, 15 pounds
were recyclable. Quite a difference.
