Homosexual behavior goes against Christian ethics

LORD, TODAY WE read Corey
Davis' Feb. 28 column and our
hearts ached.
We thank you, Lord, that you came
for the entire world, for all people, no
matter what their race or color is
(John 3:16, Matthew 28:19). We know
it pains you to see the oppression and
hurt we unnecessarily inflict upon one
another in both blatant and subtle
ways.
We are totally imperfect and sinful
persons in need of your forgiveness,
but we cannot allow people to think
that what Davis has stated is correct.
It is very wrong.
Lord, we pray you will show Davis
and other Christian homosexuals that
homosexuality is not part of your plan.
If they are Christians, Lord, we pray
their belief lies in the validity of your
word, the Bible. In the Bible you
explicity say in both the Old and New
Testaments that homosexuality is
wrong (Leviticus 18:22, 20:13; 1 Corin
thians 6:9-11).
"Do you not know that the wicked
will not inherit the kingdom of God?
Do not be deceived: Neither the

sexually immoral nor idolaters nor
adulterers nor male prostitutes nor
homosexual offenders nor thieves nor
the greedy nor drunkards nor slan
derers nor swindlers will inherit the

kingdom of God." (1 Corinthians 6:9-
11)
Lord, your apostle Paul here iden
tifies kinds of sexually immoral per
sons: adulterers, male prostitutes and
males who practice homosexuality. In
Romans 1:26, your word adds the
category of females who practice homo
sexuality. People who engage in such
practices, as well as the other offenders
listed in verses 9-10, are explicitly
people excluded from your kingdom.
Thank you, Lord, for saving and
sanctifying people like those described:
"And that is what some of you were.
But you were washed, you were
sanctified, you were justified in the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by
the Spirit of our God." (1 Corinthians
6:11)
Lord, we are thankful that you
forgive homosexuality as well as all
other sins. Homosexuality is a sin
along with cheating and stealing. You
do not condone sins. You command us
to ask forgiveness and not to commit
the same sins over and over.
Lord, you created Adam and Eve,
not Adam and Steve. We know from

your word that you created men and
women to eventually leave their par
ents, to become one in marriage and
also to be fruitful and mulitiply.
Lord, you forewarned us here on
Earth not to judge others (Romans
14:9-13) but to point out to our broth
ers and sisters where they deviate
from your teachings (II Timothy 4:2).
You say, Lord, that the entire Bible is
your word, that we are not allowed to
pick and choose what we wish to apply
to our lives and reject the rest. Your
warning is clear on that issue
(Revelations 22:18-19; II Timothy
3:16-17).
Lord, it is such a fine line between
tolerance and forbearance. Please let
Davis and other homosexuals not feel
condemned but, instead, loved by
Christians and help them understand
that although we love them, we can
nont support their stand because it is
in opposition of your word.
