# 'Graduate student' label is offensive
## 
### 
We are appalled that The Daily con
tinues to use the term "graduate stu
dent" to describe students who are
working on graduate degrees.
This term is offensive to many such
students even though students in many
graduate departments describe them
selves as "graduate students." The
term originated at a time when the
University catered to undergraduates,
for whom the term "student" was
reserved. Undergraduates saw students

working toward graduate degrees as
nerds who worked too hard and had
no social life.
Similarly, professors saw these stu
dents as a cheap source of plentiful
labor. "Graduate student" therefore has
derogatory connotations that are con
jured up every time the phrase is
used. We prefer the term "students of
graduate school," which is more
neutral and less undergraduate-centric.
To move toward a more multicul
tural and less undergraduate-centric
understanding among Stanford stu
dents, the leaders of tomorrow, we
further propose that the University
initate a requirement that all under-

graduates must take a certain
graduate-level class, such as Quantum
Field Theory. The mere introduction of
graduate-level material in an under
graduate course is not sufficient to let
undergraduates experience the graduate
lifestyle in its full grandeur (just ask
anyone who has taken QFT).
It would not have been difficult for
The Daily to look into how students of
graduate school prefer to describe
themselves. If The Daily wants to be
taken seriously, it should be more care
ful about letting sloppy journalism go
to print. And if it is truly committed
to multiculturalism, it will immediately
throw its full support behind the above

suggestions.
