## Moving past simple labels

OK, SO VAUGHN C. Williams was
really the first black president of
the Stanford Law Review, not
Shauna Jackson. Williams was in charge
of the Review (as those in the know know
it) way back in 1968-69 when 22-year-old
Jackson was cutting teeth and conquer
ing her first solid food.
OK, so although Jackson is among the
few women to head the Law Review (not
to be confused with The Stanford
Review), she is the third woman in the
past four years to do so. Lois Weithorn
and Shelley Wessels were in charge while
Jackson was finishing up her undergrad
uate career at Stanford.
OK, so Jackson is the first black
woman to head the Law Review (not sold
on your local newsstand). She's also
among the youngest to do so and perhaps
the first from Olathe, Kan.
So?
So Shauna Jackson, as a woman of
color, has just expanded the range of the
possible. Certainly, all people of color can
take pride in Jackson's accomplishment,
as they can take pride in the accomplish
ments of Kevin Haynes, a black man
elected to the Law Review's number-two
spot, managing editor (slightly below the
president on the masthead). Certainly, all
women can take pride in Jackson's ac
complishment, as they have taken pride
in the women who have preceded Jack
son.
But being a woman of color is not just
being a woman and being of color. The
indignities, experiences and understand
ings of women of color aren't just double
those suffered by women and people of

color; they are qualitatively different. And
they are different in a way that neither
civil rights movements nor women's
movements have fully recognized.
It is fitting, then, that at about the
same time Jackson occupies the presi
dent's office in the Law School basement
— mid-March for those of you marking
it on your calendar — a second woman
of color, Maria Tai Wolff, will join Jack
son's senior editing staff, and an article
entitled "Race and Essentialisim in
Feminist Legal Theory," which calls into
question the notion of a unitary women's
experience, will be published by Jackson's
predecessors at the Law Review (see Vol.
42, no. 3). In her article, Boalt Hall Law
Prof. Angela Harris takes on Catharine
MacKinnon and Robin West, two top
feminist legal scholars, for espousing
theories that ignore or minimalize the
experiences of black women.
Like much of contemporary feminism
and critical race theory, legal statutes
and institutional nondiscrimination pol
icies focus on singular forms of oppres
sion. They forbid discrimination on the
basis of race, gender, national origin or
sexual orientation. What about discrimi
nation based on the totality of race/gender
(or race/sexual orientation)? In the law,
and in how what is written in the law
interacts with what goes on in society,
the synergistic experience of being a
woman of color gets swallowed up in a
little dot of punctuation.
That's not much ink to obliterate so
many people.
For women of color, making decisions
about how best to fight oppression and

succeed in a world not meant for them
often means choosing on which side of
the comma to exist. Most of the women
I know have chosen color; for someone
like me, whose fair skin and Swedish
surname veil her mother's Hispanic her
itage, the choice was to deal with oppres
sion as a woman.
It's having to make this choice that we
should fight. On Oct. 6-7, 1990, the Stan
ford Law School will host the Third Na
tional Conference on Women of Color and
the Law. Right now more than 40 stu
dents here — men, women of color and
white women — are scrapping to put the
whole thing together. Asian-American
women, Hispanic-American women,
African-American women and Native
American women are looking for the com
mon links in their experiences and the
common strengths they can develop to
make the legal system reflect those ex
periences. Many others have joined them
in the endeavor.
Oct. 6-7 will provide the entire Stanford
community, as well as participants from
throughout the nation, with a chance to
follow Shauna Jackson in expanding the
range of the possible.
And you don't even have to join the
Law Review (or go to law school).
