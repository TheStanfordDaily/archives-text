## Writing rape stories requires extreme sensitivity 
### 
HOW MANY TIMES have I
heard a friend say she met a
"nice" guy at a party or
through a friend and say they
scammed — never thinking that
making out could lead to more than
she wanted?
How many times have I heard guys
brag about how far they got with a
woman or ask how much they got
from her the night before?
How many times have I had
nightmares of being raped?
I know two women who have been
raped, and I knew there were many
more out there. But in my four years
at Stanford, there was only one story
in The Daily about acquaintance rape.
As the sexual assault/sexual harass
ment beat writer for The Daily, I knew
the issue had to be covered, but I
didn't know where to begin.
Knowing that 1 was interested in
writing a story about acquaintance
rape, "Nina" — the woman in the first
story who woke up in the middle of
being raped — approached me in Octo
ber, willing to go on the record with
her experience.
When I first interviewed Nina, her
story shocked me. I realized that
although she thought she had been
raped, many of the people she told her
story to didn't.

Nina, who worked as a counselor at
a rape crisis center, taught me a lot
about how to interview a rape survivor.
I realized that these interviews were
going to be unlike any I had done
before.
I would have to ask details about an
intensely emotional, personal and
painful experience, and I would have to
accept the fact that I couldn't under
stand all the emotions the survivors
were going through.
Most of all, I realized that each word
and each question I asked had to be
carefully worded so that I didn't fur
ther hurt these survivors.
I knew that if I oversimplified their
experiences, implied that they were to
blame or could have prevented the
rape, or underestimated their trauma,
then I could further their victimiza
tion.
Through word-of-mouth, I heard
about the people in my stories — or
they heard about me. As I interviewed
survivors and people who work with
the issue of rape, I felt undone and
helpless.
These students never asked to be
raped, and they never asked to have
their whole lives changed because of
one night or one man.
Each survivor I talked to told me
how much they blamed themselves for

not fighting back and how much they
hated themselves as a result of the
rape. Some told me they were so hurt
by the rape that they almost commit
ted suicide.
My mind kept fighting against
believing that someone could actually
make another person hate herself. But
rapists do that.
Gradually, I learned how to strike a
shaky balance between impartiality and
sensitivity in the interviews. But I
never learned how to stop my own
sadness and anger that I inevitably felt
after each interview with a survivor.
Then came my interviews with Uni
versity officials. I interviewed many
people off the record. Those whom I
interviewed on the record, 1 talked to
for at least an hour, often more.
In essence, for every quotation I
used in my stories, I had three or four
other quotations that could have been
used. Based on that, I felt that what
went into the series was true to the
officials' beliefs.
I met with Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole at least three times for over
an hour and interviewed her both on
and off the record. I tried to under
stand her views about the judicial
system and her motivations in deciding
when to prosecute, and I tried to
express to her my goals and assump-

tions in writing this series.
I kept trying to discover where the
gaps were between what these sur
vivors went through and what the
University's official responses were.
And I kept trying to understand why
so many victims do not report their
experiences.
I don't have the answers now, but I
have some ideas. What finally appeared
in The Daily, which was a product of
four months of effort, points out the
problems that all institutions face
when trying to address the issue of
acquaintance rape.
But more importantly, my series
highlights the particular problems that
this University has in encouraging
reporting and prosecuting offenders.
If Stanford students who are charged
with rape are intelligent, good-looking
"nice young men," then they couldn't
possibly take advantage of a woman
and rape her.
But as the Rape Education Project
survey and my series revealed, rape
occurs in alarming numbers, and all
too often the rapist does not know
that what he did was wrong.
The day my first story appeared in
print, I couldn't eat or think or con
centrate on my classes. I was so ner
vous about the response people would
have, and I was so afraid that my

hard work was in vain. But as I saw
people reading, discussing, even debat
ing the issues raised in my story, I
realized that the silent voices of sur
vivors were being heard.
In a way, writing the series has
helped me discharge some of the anx
iety about rape.
But I'm still paranoid about walking
alone.
I'm still afraid to be alone in a room
with a man I do not know well.
I'm still angry at the men who raped
the students in the series.
I'm still overwhelmed with the sense
of responsibility that I have for the
survivors who have called me at home
since the series ran.
I'm still afraid that I or a friend of
mine will be raped.
And most of all, I know that the
men who raped the students in my
series will never suffer the way their
victims did.

I met with Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole at least three times for over
an hour and interviewed her both on
and off the record. I tried to under
stand her views about the judicial
system and her motivations in deciding
when to prosecute, and I tried to
express to her my goals and assump-

tions in writing this series.
I kept trying to discover where the
gaps were between what these sur
vivors went through and what the
University's official responses were.
And I kept trying to understand why
so many victims do not report their
experiences.
I don't have the answers now, but I
have some ideas. What finally appeared
in The Daily, which was a product of
four months of effort, points out the
problems that all institutions face
when trying to address the issue of
acquaintance rape.
But more importantly, my series
highlights the particular problems that
this University has in encouraging
reporting and prosecuting offenders.
If Stanford students who are charged
with rape are intelligent, good-looking
"nice young men," then they couldn't
possibly take advantage of a woman
and rape her.
But as the Rape Education Project
survey and my series revealed, rape
occurs in alarming numbers, and all
too often the rapist does not know
that what he did was wrong.
The day my first story appeared in
print, I couldn't eat or think or con
centrate on my classes. I was so ner
vous about the response people would
have, and I was so afraid that my

hard work was in vain. But as I saw
people reading, discussing, even debat
ing the issues raised in my story, I
realized that the silent voices of sur
vivors were being heard.
In a way, writing the series has
helped me discharge some of the anx
iety about rape.
But I'm still paranoid about walking
alone.
I'm still afraid to be alone in a room
with a man I do not know well.
I'm still angry at the men who raped
the students in the series.
I'm still overwhelmed with the sense
of responsibility that I have for the
survivors who have called me at home
since the series ran.
I'm still afraid that I or a friend of
mine will be raped.
And most of all, I know that the
men who raped the students in my
series will never suffer the way their
victims did.

HOW MANY TIMES have I
heard a friend say she met a
"nice" guy at a party or
through a friend and say they
scammed — never thinking that
making out could lead to more than
she wanted?
How many times have I heard guys
brag about how far they got with a
woman or ask how much they got
from her the night before?
How many times have I had
nightmares of being raped?
I know two women who have been
raped, and I knew there were many
more out there. But in my four years
at Stanford, there was only one story
in The Daily about acquaintance rape.
As the sexual assault/sexual harass
ment beat writer for The Daily, I knew
the issue had to be covered, but I
didn't know where to begin.
Knowing that 1 was interested in
writing a story about acquaintance
rape, "Nina" — the woman in the first
story who woke up in the middle of
being raped — approached me in Octo
ber, willing to go on the record with
her experience.
When I first interviewed Nina, her
story shocked me. I realized that
although she thought she had been
raped, many of the people she told her
story to didn't.

Nina, who worked as a counselor at
a rape crisis center, taught me a lot
about how to interview a rape survivor.
I realized that these interviews were
going to be unlike any I had done
before.
I would have to ask details about an
intensely emotional, personal and
painful experience, and I would have to
accept the fact that I couldn't under
stand all the emotions the survivors
were going through.
Most of all, I realized that each word
and each question I asked had to be
carefully worded so that I didn't fur
ther hurt these survivors.
I knew that if I oversimplified their
experiences, implied that they were to
blame or could have prevented the
rape, or underestimated their trauma,
then I could further their victimiza
tion.
Through word-of-mouth, I heard
about the people in my stories — or
they heard about me. As I interviewed
survivors and people who work with
the issue of rape, I felt undone and
helpless.
These students never asked to be
raped, and they never asked to have
their whole lives changed because of
one night or one man.
Each survivor I talked to told me
how much they blamed themselves for

not fighting back and how much they
hated themselves as a result of the
rape. Some told me they were so hurt
by the rape that they almost commit
ted suicide.
My mind kept fighting against
believing that someone could actually
make another person hate herself. But
rapists do that.
Gradually, I learned how to strike a
shaky balance between impartiality and
sensitivity in the interviews. But I
never learned how to stop my own
sadness and anger that I inevitably felt
after each interview with a survivor.
Then came my interviews with Uni
versity officials. I interviewed many
people off the record. Those whom I
interviewed on the record, 1 talked to
for at least an hour, often more.
In essence, for every quotation I
used in my stories, I had three or four
other quotations that could have been
used. Based on that, I felt that what
went into the series was true to the
officials' beliefs.
