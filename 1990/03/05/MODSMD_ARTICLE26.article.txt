## Revenge: Card crashes Golden Bears' party Win, season prove men beat the labels 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — Just when you thought you had
figured out the Stanford Cardinal . . .
Leading by 16 points against California Wednes
day night in Maples, Stanford fritters away the lead
and loses the game. The team sits at 16-10, and,
with two more games against the Bears up next,
looks like it's through for 1990. Instead, the Cardinal
enters the unfriendly confines of Harmon Arena
and bulldozes the Bears 79-58 . . .
Stanford completed the Pacific 10 Conference at
the .500 mark. That's four straight seasons of no
worse than break even in an improving league.
Hardly seems like the formula for a program every
one assumed was on the downswing about the time
Todd Lichti took his jump shot skyward to the Mile
High City .. .
Mike Montgomery showed he can indeed coach
in 1990. For the sideline wizards who think they
could do it better, ask whether you could go 17-10
after losing six of your top seven players and have
just one returning guard (he having played just 86
minutes the previous season) . . .
Add Montgomery and his returning guard, John
Patrick: "I thought Patrick played real well
(yesterday). I'm real pleased with John." No one
asked Montgomery a question about Patrick, the
coach just made sure he got that in during the
press conference.
Remember, in 1988-89 Stanford needed a fourth
guard to give additional rest to Lichti and Terry
Taylor. Patrick was on the roster, yet played just
86 minutes. He was so deep in the dog house, it
would've taken a team of spelunkers to find him.
Now, he's one of the better shooters in the league
Last add Montgomery: Raise your hand if you
foresaw the development of Deshon Wingate from
a 2.7 points per game garbage timer to a solid scorer
(10.2 point average on .523 shooting) and excellent
rebounder (5.8 per game). Montgomery-coached
players seem to have a tendency to improve. See
Butler, Greg; Meinert, Scott; Reveno, Eric . . .
There's nothing strange about Stanford's new
"How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb"
attitude about the three-pointer. The Cardinal has
dialed long distance 17 times in the past two games
(nine Wednesday, eight yesterday).
Adam Keefe is still foremost on the minds of
opposing coaches who continue to collapse on Stan
ford's big man. Patrick and Kenny Ammann are
doing their part to render that strategy ineffective.
Still, Keefe continues to face gimmick defenses.
Says Patrick: "Adam is still the focus of the other

BERKELEY — This season has
definitely been a learning experi
ence for the Stanford basketball
team. They have learned to give
the ball to Adam Keefe as often
as possible. They have learned to
play hard-nosed defense. And they
have learned that when you have
a 16-point lead over California,
you keep sticking it to them.
They learned that last lesson
Wednesday night when the Bears
came back from a 48-32 deficit to
post a victory in Maples Pavilion.
Yesterday the Cardinal imple
mented that lesson, handing the
Golden Bears a 79-58 pasting in
Harmon Gym.
With the victory Stanford ends
the regular season at 17-10 over
all, 9-9 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence while Cal fell to 21-8 overall,
12-6. The two teams will play
again Friday night in the second
round of the Pac-10 Tournament
at Arizona State. The win also
gave the Cardinal's hopes for an
NIT Tournament bid a boost. The
tournament field will be an
nounced this Sunday.
"That was extremely pleasing
for us," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "It was proba
bly the best 40 minutes of con
sistent basketball on both ends of
the court that we've played all
year."
Stanford took a 45-40 lead into
half time but the game was
decided when the Cardinal held
Cal without a field goal for 11
minutes, 44 seconds. After the
Bears closed to 48-44, Stanford
outscored the Bears 23-6 before
guard Ryan Drew converted a
back-door layup for two points
with 5:17 left in the game.
The teams were pretty even the
first half with Stanford grabbing
the lead for good on a Kenny Am
mann three-pointer with 7:58 left.
That shot, the Cardinal's fifth
trey of the game, made it 29-27.
Cal got within one on a Roy Fisher
shot at 37-36 but Marcus Lollie
hit another three-pointer for
Stanford to make it a four-point
game.
For the half, Ammann had
three three-pointers and Lollie,

John Patrick and Kenny Hicks
had one each as the Cardinal
made 6-of-8 long-range bombs.
After finishing 8 of 13 for the
game, Stanford has now hit on
17 treys in 30 tries in two games
against the Bears.
"Obviously Stanford came in
and played a really fine game,"
Cal Coach Lou Campanelli said.
"They come out and they hit
threes and scored inside, so they
have both barrels going. .. . Ob
viously now we have to make
some serious adjustments be
tween now and Friday."
Deshon Wingate opened the sec
ond half with a three-point play
but Keith Smith countered with
a leaner from eight feet. Hendrick
hit a shot from the low post to
cut it to 48-44 but then the Bears
went silent. Ammann nailed a
three-pointer, and after a Smith
miss, Keefe got a dunk on a nice
pass from Patrick.
Campanelli called timeout with
his team down 53-44, and on the
Bears' next possession, Smith
tried to post up Patrick. Patrcik
slipped and fell, Smith turned to
go to the hoop and tripped over
Patrick. Smith got called for
travelling and an irate Campanelli
picked up his second technical in
two games. Ammann hit both free
throws, Wingate hit an 18-footer
and Keefe made a great play to
tip in a Wingate miss to make it
59-44.
Bill Elleby nearly stopped the
bleeding for Cal but his three
point attempt rolled around the
rim for a long time before falling
out. Hendrick and Fisher each had
a two free throws to more than
offset a jumper from Lollie but
the Cardinal scored seven more
unanswered points.
Keefe finished with an typical
20 points and nine rebounds —
he's averaging 19.1 and 9.2 on the
season — and his 517 points this
year place him 13th on the all
time Stanford list, one behind


A 1 Green — Dally file
Adam Keefe helped the Cardlpftl avenge its loss to the Bears last Wednesday by
driving for 20 points and 9 boards at Cal's Harmon Gym yesterday.
