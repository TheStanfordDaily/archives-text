The mighty freight train
known as the Stanford wom
en's tennis team just keeps
a rollin' down the track.
It cruised into Madison,
Wis. for the National Team
Indoors late last week and
hammered both the nation's
fourth- and second-ranked
teams en route to capturing
collegiate tennis's most pres
tigious event outside of the
NCAA tournament. Stan
ford is now 13-0 on the
season.

Stanford wins National In
door title

Yesterday's final between
No. 1 Stanford and No. 2
UCLA was expected to be
an exciting showdown and a
possible preview of the na
tional championship final.
The Bruins have a deeper
lineup than they did last
year when they finished as
NCAA runners-up.
Even though UCLA did
force Stanford into doubles
for only the second time this
season, the Bruins showed
they are not yet ready to
threaten the Cardinal's dom
ination of the sport.
From No. 1 through No.
4 singles, Stanford players
recorded straight-set wins
over their UCLA opponents.
Sandra Birch lost to Jessica
Emmons 6-3 6-4 in a dual
match last April. Yesterday,
she beat her 6-4, 6-1 to lead
the charge.
Meredith McGrath was in
Indians Wells, Calif., Friday
where she was defeated in
the quarterfinals of the Vir
gina Slims event by Katerina
Maleeva 6-2, 6-1. Yesterday,
she nearly double-bageled
Mamie Ceniza 6-0, 6-1.
Debbie Graham moved up
a spot in the lineup from
her position last year. With her
6-1, 6-3 pasting of Iwalani
McCalla yesterday, she is a perfect
38-0 in dual matches over her two
year career.
Like Graham, Teri Whitlinger
is playing a notch higher. In her
four matches at Indoors, Whit
linger dropped a total of eight
games in eight sets. Yesterday, she
hammered the Bruins highly
touted freshman Kimberly Po 6-1,
6-1.
All told, the Cardinal's top four
are 38-0 in duals this season.
The Bruins did gain a measure
of hope in winning the five and
six singles matches. Captain Lisa
Green dropped her first decision
in team competition this season
yesterday. She was beaten by
Kirsten Dreyer 7-6 (7-4), 6-4. At
No. 6, Heather Willens lost a
three-setter to Cammie Foley.
The Bruins might have gotten

a notion they could win with a
sweep of the doubles. The Cardi
nal had no trouble quashing the
notion.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team
earned a national No. 1 ranking
when, in their first tournament
together, McGrath and Whitlinger
beat Georgia's Shannan McCarthy
and Stacey Schefflin 6-0, 6-1 at
the Ail-American Championships.
McCarthy and Schefflin were
ranked No. 2 at the time.
In the Indoors final, McGrath
and Whitlinger had a chance to
show the performance was no
fluke as they were facing No. 3-
rated Mamie Ceniza and Stella
Sampras.
Again the Cardinal came up big,
allowing just one game to the
Bruin pair in a 6-0, 6-1 triumph.
That win obviated the need for
No. 2 and 3 doubles to be played.
UCLA is now 12-1 on the season.
With a trio of weekend victories,
Stanford's winning streak is at 49
matches. Next Sp urday, March
10, the Cardinal will play Arizona
State with a chance to break the

all-time consecutive victories
record for any team in any sport.
The 1985-87 water polo teams
hold the mark of 51.
In Saturday's semifinal with
Georgia, Stanford dropped just
one set in a 6-0 victory over No.
4 Georgia. The Bulldogs one-two
punch of McCarthy and Schefflin
did not take a set off Birch and
McGrath.
Similarly, Caryn Moss and Jill
Waldman — both of whom re
corded 20-plus match winning
streaks last season — dropped in
straight sets to Graham and Whit
linger. Waldman, ranked No. 30,
did not take a single game from
Whitlinger in a 6-0, 6-0 shutout.
Shawn McCarthy, Shannan's
twin sister (does this sound
familiar, Stanford fans?), won the
first set of her match with Green.
The Cardinal captain dropped just
four games the rest of the way.
Willens also won handily in her
match with Maria Salsgard.
