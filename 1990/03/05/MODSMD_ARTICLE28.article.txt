# Women hoopsters prepare for March Madness
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
It's that time of year again. The
February page of the calendar has
been crumpled up and thrown in
the trash. Winter is slowly giving
up its grip to spring.
If you're a basketball fan, you
might be wiping a hand across
your forehead and thinkingyou're
a bit feverish.
Worry not. It's just a simple
case of March Madness. And, if
it were life threatening, the 4,038
who watched the Cardinal blow
out California 112-84 in Maples
Friday night would have over
loaded Cowell, the Stanford
Hospital and the Palo Alto Med
ical Clinic combined.
The No. 2 Cardinal, which has
all but clinched the top seed in
the NCAA Tournament West Re
gional, is now 25-1 on the season,
15-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play.
The Bears slipped to 15-11, 7-9.
Julie Zeilstra keyed the Cardi
nal early on with five field goals
in the opening seven minutes. But
the Bears stayed close and trailed
just 22-20 when Teresa Pal
misano, who matched Zeilstra for
game-high honors with 25 points,
hit a pair of free throws to bring
Cal within two at 22-20.
There were 11 minutes, 19
seconds remaining on the clock
at that point — about the time
Stanford usually goes on its run.
Friday was no different. Trisha
Stevens started things innocently
enough when she converted on a
pass from Val Whiting.
Soi\ja Henning then stole the
ball, went in for a layup and was
fouled. She converted the three
point play and the Cardinal was
off to the races. By the time Cal
called timeout, it was 40-22,
Zeilstra had buried two more
jumpers and, if you were watching
on television, you could have
turned it off right there.
Henning keyed another Stan
ford run with an 18-foot jump
shot at the 3:51 mark that made
it 51-31. She followed that with
another steal and fed Stevens for
a layin. Stacy Parson hit a jumper
and Henning scored on a fast
break to complete an 8-0 run over
90 seconds.
"We had wanted to keep it
close," Bears Coach Gooch Foster
said. "But after their loss to Wash
ington, it was no secret they
wanted to speed up their game."
Cal put it on fast forward as
well, eschewing the slow down op-

tion. "We thought about it,"
Foster said. "But after a while,
what difference does it make?
Slow it down and lose by 15 or
let the players run and have some
fun and lose by 28?"
Or perhaps lose by 50. After 20
minutes of play, Stanford led 60-
37 — setting a school scoring
record for points in the first half.
The Cardinal shot a blistering 63
percent, led by Zeilstra's 7-of-8
performance. "I just had excellent
passes tonight," Zeilstra said. "It's
not hard to turn around and shoot
it when you get passes like that.
The Bears shot a solid 52 per
cent but were being hammered
nonetheless as Stanford ran them
out of the building. Henning had
eight first-half assists, and Jenni
fer Azzi added six as the Cardinal
backcourt set up most of the
frontcourt's 41 points.
"Most of all we wanted to run,"
Henning said. "Second of all, we
wanted to get the ball inside . . .
for a sure two."
Any hopes Cal had of finding
its way to the comeback trail were
dashed early in the second stanza.
The Bears made just two field
goals in the first eight and a half
minutes as the Cardinal extended
the lead to 85-47.
As Stanford began pulling its
starters, only two elements of
suspense remained: 1) Who would
score the 100 th point? 2) Would
the Cardinal break its single-game
record of 119?
The first question was an
swered by Martha Richards —
who has made a career of putting
Stanford over the century mark.
Richards knocked down one of her
three treys with 5:45 to go, push
ing the lead to 100-67. On the
evening, she finished with a
season-high 11 points.
For those attendance who had
hoped to see the Cardinal rewrite
the record book, the ensuing three
minutes were a disappointment.
Cal scored 13 unanswered points
over that span.

The third largest home crowd in
Stanford history saw the Cardinal

Lester Raskin - Dally
Redshirt freshman Chris MacMurdo came off the bench to contribute five points and six rebounds
to the Cardinal's crushing defeat of Cal Friday night at Maples. Stanford's 112-84 win put them at
25-1 for the year with just two regular-season contests remaining before March Madness begins.
