# Card nine interrupts rain to down ASU
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Someone somewhere really
doesn't want the Stanford base
ball team to play a series uninter
rupted by lousy weather.
The Cardinal, which was at
home this weekend for the first
time in a month to take on Ari
zona State, instead found itself
fighting the elements more often
than the Sun Devils. For the
record, the score now stands Na
ture 2, Cardinal 1, Sun Devils 0,
as Stanford managed a come
from-behind win on Saturday in
between two rainouts.

Cardinal 3

Sun Devils 2

The games scheduled for Friday
and Sunday will be made up
(maybe) today in a doubleheader
starting at 11 a.m., marking the
second time in three Six-Pac se
ries that the Cardinal has been
forced to play two games on a
single day.
The Sun Devils began Satur
day's game (which was played un
der perfect conditions, of course)
just like almost every Stanford-
ASU game of the last three years
— by taking the early lead. ASU,
which had won 11 of its previous
12 regular-season games against
the Cardinal, tagged starter Stan
Spencer for two runs in the second
on a single by Anthony Manahan
and a homer by third baseman
Jim Austin that barely cleared the
center-field wall, just out of Jeff
Hammonds' reach.
"I don't think it was a bad
pitch," Spencer said, "It just got
up in the air and kept going. I
was real surprised — I didn't
think he got all of it."
That was actually all the Sun
Devils would get — exactly two
of them got on base in the next
seven innings. Spencer put on,
well, an average show (for him),
striking out nine, walking none,
and retiring 14 in a row at one
point.
"Sometimes it takes me a cou
ple of innings to get going," said
Spencer, who is now 5-0. Which
isn't bad for someone who didn't
have his best stuff.
"That's a typical day for Stan,"

Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "Seventy-five to 80 percent
of the time he'll pitch like that.
He just doesn't beat himself."
He did have a little help,
though. After getting only two
hits off the Devils' Sean Rees
through five innings, the Cardinal
bats came alive in the sixth, scor
ing a run on singles by Paul Carey
and Tim Griffin and a double
from Roger Burnett.
That was it for Rees, who gave
way to Kip Yaughn. Yaughn got
Ryan Turner to line out, walked
Steve Solomon, and struck out
Troy Tallman to end the inning.
Having removed himself from
a jam, Yaughn proceeded to jump
right back into a mess in the
seventh. Hammonds led off with
a single and stole second an out
later. David McCarty then
grounded to Austin, who muffed
the ball and tried to catch Ham
monds going back to second. Safe.
Then the fun began. Second
baseman Fernando Vina threw
the ball back to Yaughn, and then
asked Hammonds to step off sec
ond so he could clean the bag.
Yes, clean the bag. Any guesses
what happened next?
"After I was called safe, he
[Vina] said 'Yo man, let me brush
off the bag,"' Hammonds said. "1
said, 'Why do you wanna brush
off the bag?' The ump had his
hands spread out like there was
time out, so I stepped off to look
at Nine [Marquess] to get the sig
nal, and [Vina] tagged me with
the ball. I said to myself 'Damn,
I'm out!'"
That would be Ye Olde Hidden
Ball Trick, thank you very much.
The Devils were yelling that Ham
monds was out, but it took the
umpires a five-minute conference
to figure out what the heck was
going on. ASU Coach Jim Brock
helped them out, and after the
umps finally called Hammonds
out, Marquess put in his two
cents.
"I asked 'Why didn't you call
him out initially?'" Marquess
said, "and they said they didn't
know the rule. If you're gonna
make the call, make the call. I
didn't see what the problem was."
"I got mad because they
reversed the call, but I was out,
no argument," Hammonds said.
"It happens. Every day I learn
something new, and unfortunate

ly, today I learned the hidden ball
trick."
Not that it mattered. Carey was
waiting patiently at the plate dur
ing the entire fiasco and wasn't
exactly thrilled with what was
going on. "It kind of motivated
me," Carey said. "Actually, it
pissed me off. I just felt someone
had to take control."
The lesson for the day, boys
and girls, is to not aggravate Mr.
Carey. Yaughn threw his first
pitch down and,in — and turned
to watch it 'crash through the

trees beyond the fence in right
center. Three-two Stanford.
"It was a great pitch," Yaughn
said. "He had a pretty good idea
of what he was gonna get, and
he was right."
"Paul really bailed me out,"
Hammonds said. "I just sat back
and said 'Wow.'"
"Paul's homer was huge," Spen
cer said. "After that I got a rush
of adrenaline." And that was that.

Ken Beer — Dally
While umpires discussed the implications of Fernando Vina's Ye
Oide Hidden Ball Trick on the Cardinal's Jeff Hammonds, Paul
Carey just got even, slamming a two-run home run to give Stanford
a 3-2 victory over the Sun Devils Saturday.
