# Cold War conclusion rekindles Hoover curators' collection
## 
### Baldwin Lee Editorial staff 
Joseph Dwyer has seen plenty of war,
revolution and peace during his years as
deputy curator of the Hoover Institution.
But the recent democratic revolutions oc
curring throughout Eastern Europe to
gether rank as one of the three most
important "flowerings of information" for
the Hoover collection, he said in an in
terview last week.
Dwyer said the other two most impor
tant events were the endings of World
Wars I and 11. The recent democratic
movements, he argued, can also be seen
as the end of a major war — the Cold War.

Hoover archivist Anne Van Camp at
tributed part of the "flood of informa
tion" to a relaxation of censorship and
an "opening up" by East European gov
ernments.
The curators for Eastern Europe began
slowly stepping up collection efforts a
few years ago, moving more financial
support into obtaining underground ma
terials, Dwyer said. However, the Eastern
Europe staff just got the financial go
ahead in January for the "big move" in
collecting materials. Dwyer attributed in
creased funding to the revolutions occur
ring at the end of December, particularly
in Romania.
The three curators involved in Eastern

Europe are all planning to travel to Eu
rope soon, both to cultivate contacts and
to pick up material. Assistant curator
Maciej Siekierski is presently in the So
viet Union, Dwyer will be leaving for five
weeks in Eastern Europe on March 28,
and Eastern European curator Robert
Conquest will be traveling to the Soviet
Union in April.
Dwyer said he "fdidn't] know where
to start" in naming the most significant
recent acquisition. He did highlight a
Romanian newspaper from Dec. 22, the
day that dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu was
ousted from power. Dwyer said he
believes Hoover has the only copy of that
newspaper in the United States.

Nationalism
has become
more significant
than ideology in
the Baltic states.'

While democratic newspapers are sur
facing in many countries due to the
legalization of opposition movements, the
Soviet Union is still in a "limbo situa
tion," according to Dwyer.
Possession of Soviet opposition news

papers, or "samzidat," is still illegal in
the Soviet Union, but no one has been
arrested for months, Dwyer said.
Dwyer said party newspapers in the
Baltic states are also particularly inter
esting. These official party publications
are becoming increasingly nationalistic
and opposed to the central Soviet gov
ernment.
He noted a Latvian Communist Party
newspaper with a caricature of Mikhail
Gorbachev — "something that never
could have happened a few years ago."
The papers show "how far things have
gone . . . and that nationalism has become
more significant than ideology in the Bal
tic states," Dwyer said.
