Freshmen Jonathan Stark
and Jared Palmer overpowered
a talented field to capture the
Pacific Coast Men's Doubles
title at the La Jolla Beach and
Tennis Club yesterday.
In the finals, Stark and Pal
mer, the third seed in the tour
nament, downed Matt Lucena
and Bent-Ove Pederson of Cal
ifornia, 6-4, 7-5.
"I feel like we are getting
much better," Stark said. "We
tried to work on getting our
returns down, and I think we
did that well.
"lln the finals] we really
tried to put pressure on them
to come up with the big shots.
That was the difference," Stark
added.
The semifinal match proved
more of a problem for the
Stark-Palmer tandem. Up a set
and 3-1, 30-love in the second,
the Cardinal duo allowed USC's
second-seeded team of Byron
Black and Kent Seaton back
into the match.

"We really had the match in
hand, but then we got broken
twice. So, it came down to the
third set rather unexpectedly,"
Palmer said.
After winning the second set,
Black and Seaton actually went
up 4-1 in the third-set tie
breaker before Stark and Pal
mer started to roll. Two crush
ing service returns — one by
Palmer and one by Stark —
put the tiebreaker back on
serve. The Stanford team went
on to win the tiebreaker 7-5
and the match 6-2, 4-6, 7-6.
"We played a little spotty at
times, and our concentration
kept us out of closing out a
few matches," Palmer said.
Sophomore Alex O'Brien and
junior Dan Turbow also played
well, reaching the the quarter
finals before bowing out to
Lucena and Pederson, 6-4, 6-1.
"They were returning really
well, and we were a step or
two off," Turbow said. "We
have to give them credit, but
we could have played a better
match."
