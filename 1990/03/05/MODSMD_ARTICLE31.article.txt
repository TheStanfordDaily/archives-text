The rest of the nation might
not be glad to hear it, but the
Cardinal women's swim team just
got a little stronger.
Stanford, the defending NCAA
champion and the nation's top
ranked team, made its hopes for
repeating a bit more likely at the
Stanford Invitational Saturday
when sophomore J.T. Toton qual
ified to swim the 200-yard indi
vidual medley at the NCAA meet.
Toton is one of 17 Cardinal
swimmers who had qualified for
the NCAA Championships al
ready. She qualified in the 100
and 200 breaststrokes earlier in
the season, and Saturday she
swam the 200 IM in two minutes,

5.16 seconds, well under the qual
ifying time of 2:06.29.
Toton also surpassed her pre
vious lifetime best in the 200 IM
by .71 seconds but feels the best
is yet to come. "I'm excited. I
know when I'm tapered and
shaved I can swim a lot faster in
that event because I haven't really
swum the 200 IM, ' she said.
"That race I definitely think I'll
drop a lot [of time]."
California brought several
swimmers to compete at the non
scoring meet as well, but none
were successful in their efforts to
qualify. Despite this, however, the
Golden Bears will be sending 11
swimmers to the NCAA Champi
onships, their largest squad ever.
The NCAA meet is March 15-17
at Texas.
