# Spikers have no trouble handling Cougars

### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Just as the Stanford-BYU
match began last Friday night, a
BYU player looked across the net,
noticed the absence of All -
American Dan Hanan from the
starting lineup, and questioned as
to how it would affect the out
come. Cougar Coach Carl
McGown somewhat sagaciously
quipped in response, "we'll find
out soon enough."
That, indeed, they did. BYU
found out in a hurry that the
Cardinal is anything but a five
man spectator show riding the
Hanan express to the NCAA
championship.
Led by a punishing offensive
display by outside hitter Dave
Goss and an inspired effort from
junior swing hitter John Alstrom,
the healthy starting five joined
middle blocker John Hribar in
handily undoing the No. 13 BYU
Cougars 15-12, 15-11, 15-2.

Hribar, in his first official start
for the Cardinal, filled in for
senior Hanan who was recovering
from the flu. The substitution
hardly slowed No.l Stanford as it
dismantled another WIVA confer
ence team to improve its record
to 7-1, 7-0 in WIVA.
"This was a great opportunity
to give Hribar some time," Coach
Fred Sturm said. "We started
slow, but John finished really
strong. Without Hanan, 1 still
think that we are capable of play
ing some very good volleyball."
Early indications were not so
positive, however. The Cardinal
immediately fell behind in the
first game, looking quite unlike a
team in the midst of a six match
win streak.
"We didn't concentrate well,"
senior middle blocker Craig For
syth said. "We came out really
flat, and we didn't execute. We
were without our top player and

we were out of it in the begin
ning."
Two Parker Blackman kills dur
ing broken plays stunted the
Cougar surge, however, and en
abled Stanford to edge back at
3-3. Brother Duncan Blackman
proceeded to provide a serving ex
hibition as he smashed several
jump serves, resulting in an 8-5
game score.
Dave Goss, who hit a match
high 23 kills for a .386 hitting
percentage, then delivered three
consecutive kills to prop Stanford
to a 13-9 advantage. After BYU
closed to 12-13, Goss and Forsyth
clamped the game door shut with
additional kills.
"It took us a while to get into
our rhythm," Hribar said. "But
we ended up playing pretty well."
With almost mechanical effi
ciency, Stanford exploited the er
rant passing of BYU at the start
of the second game. John Alstrom,
who connected on 13 kills for the
night to go with a match high 9
digs, initiated the early onslaught
with a kill at 1-0. Goss then of
fered a kill and a thundering block
straight down followed by another
kill to extend the lead to 4-0.
Parker Blackman and Forsyth
combined to repel another hit for
5-0.
After this 6-0 streak, BYU
resurfaced by capitalizing on Car
dinal siding out difficulties.
Despite a four-point run, Stanford
was able to initiate yet another
streak to take an 11-4 lead. Six
kills by Goss toward the end of
the game sealed the outcome.
"Dave gave us a lot of help with
his hitting tonight," Sturm said.
The third game was essentially
a formality, and BYU certainly
played it like one. Committing a
rotation error to lose a point at
2-0 and making a blatant back
row attack when down 4-0, the
Cougars, who committed an abys
mal 23 attack errors on the night,
came undone before relentless
Cardinal play.
Setter Parker Blackman again
registered two early kills to spark
the third game run.
