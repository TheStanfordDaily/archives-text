Showing no adverse effects
from an eight-hour motorhome
ride to southern California,
Stanford's women's gymnastics
team turned in a strong per
formance at the California State
University-Fullerton Invita
tional Friday night.
The 30th-ranked Cardinal
posted a score of 185.1 to upset
21st- ranked Boise State
(182.75) and give 16th-ranked
Penn State (186.75) a bit of a
scare. The host Titans, ranked
number 10, were untouchable,
however, as they scored a
season-high 189.15 to take top
honors.
Stanford's score, in addition
to raising the Cardinal's na
tional ranking, also brightens
the post-season picture. Stan

regular-season scores — will go
up a full point to 184.17.
The squad's best event was
once again balance beam, where
a season-high total of 47.35 left
the other teams in the dust.
Stanford was so solid in the
event that the lowest score,
which is dropped from the team
tally, was a 9.4.
Also outstanding was the
team spirit Stanford showed on
floor exercise.
"Even though only one person
competes at a time, the whole
team was involved," junior Jen
nifer Bloom said. "We had a lot
of energy."
Bars and vault did not go
quite so well. One of the scores
that was counted on bars in

eluded a fall, and the scores
were generally low on vault.
A new face on the vault team
made an impression, however.
Senior Becky Ashton, perform
ing a vault that she just learned
this year, scored a 9.2, second
highest among the Stanford
competitors.
"Becky earned herself a spot
in the vaulting lineup," coach
Breck Greenwood said.
It was also a banner day for
the Cardinal all-arounders, as
each of the three topped 37
points. Senior Dina Amoroso
scored a 37.55 to place fifth in
the event. Freshman Erin
McCann and Bloom each tied
season highs with scores of 37.2
and 37.15, respectively.
As far aa the ride to Fullerton
was concerned, it may have had
a positive effect on the team.
"I think it sort of helped with
team bonding," Bloom said.
