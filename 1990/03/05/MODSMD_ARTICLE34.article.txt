# Gymnasts win despite injuries

Stanford men's gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada did not think his team had much
chance to beat Arizona State. With national
champion Tim Ryan out with a broken bone
and Conrad Voorsanger in Virginia competing
in an international meet, Hamada went to his
bench and hoped for the best. The result,
however, was another Stanford victory.
"I'm very pleased," Hamada said. "I thought
it would be tough to beat them. They had the
depth and the guys."

Cardinal first place

in three-way meet

With Ryan and Voorsanger gone, Hamada
had cause to be worried, but it is hard to be
14-0 without having some depth of your own.
Seldom-used Marcus Quek and Peter Wayne
put in solid performances as the team scored
275.15 to go up 12-0 in Pacific 10 Conference
competition. Arizona State dropped to 10-9,
and the third member of the tri-meet, Western
Michigan, remained winless on the season at
0-11.
"Peter Wayne and Marcus Quek did a great
job," Hamada said. "275.15 is the best I could
expect."
Charles Loop won the all-around title by
narrowly beating out teammate Jair Lynch
57.2 to 57.05, who, even with his second place
finish, provided the excitement of the meet.
The freshman from Washington D.C. came up
with the high bar performance of his life*
winning the event with a 9.85.
"Jair Lynch on the high bar, that was the
highlight of the meet," Hamada said. "It was
a flawless routine with some original parts."
After the meet, Hamada called the compe
tition "a big win, defiantly an upset," but his
depleted squad did not even make it look close.
The Cardinal lost only one event, the still
rings 46.00 to 45.80, and dominated the other
five. Hamada was especially pleased with the
parallel and high bars.
"Event by event we did a great job on the
parallel bars and the high bars," said Hamada.
The high bar was the team's event of the
day as four of the five competitors scored
above 9.0.
