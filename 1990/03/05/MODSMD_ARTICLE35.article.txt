## Competitors exceed all expectations in first scored dual meet 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
On Saturday, Stanford's track and field team com
peted in its first scored dual meet in five years,
with the exception of the annual Big Meet. How
did they do after all this time?
"Basically, we won," said coach Brooks Johnson,
in an incredible understatement.
The meet, which was held at UC-Irvine, pitted
the Cardinal against runners, jumpers, and throwers
from California State University-Northridge and Ir
vine. It was scored for each team as a "double dual
meet" and as a three-way meet.
In dual meet scoring, Stanford's men beat Irvine
90-63 and Northridge 84-65. The Cardinal women
won by scores of 95-49 and 78-66, respectively In
tri-meet scoring, Stanford won by appropriately
large margins.
The Cardinal's opposition should have known
what was coming when in the long jump, junior
Marcus Hickerson leapt over a foot beyond every
other jumper's lifetime best on the first jump of
the day. When the measurer called out the distance
of 24-ft 6-in, one of the Irvine jumpers was heard
uttering expletives.
Hickerson passed on the rest of his jumps and
had his tennis shoes back on with first place secure

before anyone else lifted a foot.
He then went on to win the triple jump and the
open 400-meters. But he wasn't quite finished as
he later anchored the first-place 1600-meter relav
team.
Just .11 seconds and one place behind Hickerson
in the 400-meters was Jim Cramton, who crossed
the line at 48.11 seconds. The two combined for
one of many one-two finishes for the Cardinal.
"We won maybe 80 percent of the events, most
of them quite handily," assistant coach Scott Chisam
said. "Many of them we took one-two," he added.
Another one-two event for the Cardinal was the
women's 200-meter race. D'Layne Kerr turned in
a respectable 26.1-second time, good for second
place. But teammate Chryste Gaines took the race,
finishing in a sizzling 24.29 seconds.
Kerr and Gaines continued their blistering pace
in other events. Kerr finished just behind Cardinal
comrade Rhonda Oliver in the open 400-meters to
gamer yet another one-two finish for Stanford.
Gaines ignited the track in an 11.65-second flight
to first place in the 100-meter dash.
Both Debbie Malueg and Brian Boggess won the
shotput and discus events. Susan Hefter ran her
first 400-meter hurdle competition and promptly
took first place.
