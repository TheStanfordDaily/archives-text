# Pacific 10 Championships commence
## Swimmers begin quest for ninth consecutive conference crown 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
After barely having time to inhale even
a breath of air during its intense training
period over the past few months, the Stan
ford men's swimming team will finally have
the chance to release some extra rested
puffs while skimming along the top of the
water at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long
Beach.
Starting today and continuing until Wed
nesday, the Cardinal squad will compete
in the Pacific 10 Championships. For the
first time this season, the majority of Car
dinal swimmers will be rested and shaved
for a meet, and, instead of fighting for the
points of the top three spots, they will be
racing for the top 16. These two changes
should allow the Stanford swimmers to
glide to their ninth consecutive conference
title, which would tie Southern California's
record streak from 1961 to 1969.
"Traditionally, Stanford always seems to
shine in the championship season," co-
Captain Rick Gould commented a few
weeks ago. "I think we'll win Pac-lOs fairly
easily."
Last season, the performance of the
slower finishers pushed the Cardinal far
ahead of any other school at Pac-lOs. De
spite only garnering four first-place
finishes in the swimming events, Stanford
dominated the scoring, finishing almost
300 points ahead of second- place UCLA.
In 11 of the 13 individual swimming events,
four Cardinal swimmers finished in the
top 12 positions.
Stanford expects similar results this year.
Despite posting a 6-3 dual record this
season, and entering the meet as the "slight

underdog" due to late-season losses to
UCLA and USC, the Cardinal looks for its
superior depth to rack up high points in
Los Angeles. According to Gould, Stanford
will have three or four swimmers challeng
ing for points in each event.
Only four Cardinal swimmers, Gould,
senior John Witchel, sophomore Jeff Rouse,
and freshman Chas Morton, have already
qualified for NCAAs and will not be shaved
for the competition.
In comparison to their northern coun
terparts, many of UCLA's and USC's swim
mers already attained NCAA standard
times after shaving for a meet in early
December.
"Since USC and UCLA already have a
lot of guys qualified, they may not even
shave," defending NCAA 200 yard back
stroke Champion Rouse said. "If that hap
pens, the meet will probably be less
competitive for us."
Along with the other Pac-10 teams, Stan
ford does not want to reach their pinnacle
at this point. Instead, the Cardinal needs
to put themselves in a position to shine
at the NCAA Championships, starting
March 22, by qualifying the maximum 17
swimmers this week.
"Swimming is different than most
sports," Rouse said. "We don't know who
will peak when. . . we're looking to peak
more at NCAAs."
The Cardinal's quest to qualify begins
at 11 a.m. The preliminaries for the 200
free and 400 medley relays, the 50 and the
500 free, and the 200 individual medley
will be swum this morning The first start
ing gun for the finals of these events will
be fired tonight at 6 p.m.
