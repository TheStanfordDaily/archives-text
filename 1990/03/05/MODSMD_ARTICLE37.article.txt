### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
The steady drizzle which buffeted Monterey all
weekend could not rain on Stanford's parade, as
the women's golf team posted an impressive fifth
place finish at the San Jose State Invitational.
The Cardinal overcame a talented field and chal
lenging course en route to their sixth consecutive
top-ten showing in as many tournaments this year.
Stanford's 950 team total was 17 strokes behind
victorious Arizona State. The Sun Devils edged the
Golden Hurricane of Tulsa by seven shots to claim
the team title.
A "thrilled" coach Tim Baldwin felt the team's
performance may mark the advent of an important
transition for the squad.
"This tournament shows we have a chance to win
everything this year. I think this team definitely
has the ability and will continue to show it in the
future," he said.
Stanford bested such perennial powers as No. 1
ranked and defending national champion San Jose
and Arizona, ranked third nationally. The strong
15-team field in Monterey boasted nine of the top
ten squads.

The Cardinal entered this event ranked seventh
in the country and will likely improve on the
strength of this successful weekend.
The fine finish is all the more impressive in light
of the difficulty of the venue. Stanford skillfully
navigated Fort Ord's Bayonet Course, which is the
most demanding 18 holes the squad will face this
year.
The team was led by Jodi Figley, whose solid 229
total and closing round 74 placed her seventh in
dividually.
Figley finished seven stroked behind Arizona
State's sensational freshman Brandie Burton, who
has won every collegiate event she has entered and
was described by Baldwin as "unquestionably the
best amateur in the world." After suffering
early season woes, sophomore Stephanie Davis pro
vided her finest tournament play this year and
earned a 10th individual finish with her steady 230
total.
Baldwin was impressed by the showings of Figley
and Davis in Monterey.
"Jodi and Stephanie both had a tremendous week
end. They proved exactly what they're capable of
in a field that had the majority of the finest players
in the world." he said.
