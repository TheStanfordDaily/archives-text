LOS ANGELES (AP) - Hank
Gathers, one of only two Division
I players to lead the nation in
scoring and rebounding in the
same season, died Sunday night
after collapsing during Loyola
Marymount's West Coast Confer
ence tournament game against
Portland. He was 23.
Gathers, a senior, was pronoun
ced dead at Daniel Freeman
Marina Hospital, where he yas
taken by ambulance after collaps
ing with 13:34 left in the first
half. He died at 6:55 p.m. PST,
a school spokesman said.
Cardiologist Mason Weiss said
cause of death was unknown and
an autopsy would be performed.

As a junior last season, Gathers
averaged 32.7 points and 13.7
rebounds, joining Xavier
McDaniel of Wichita State in
1984-85 as the only NCAA player
to lead the nation in both
categories.
A 6-foot-7, 210-pound center
from Philadelphia, Gathers was
forecast as a first-round selection
in this year's NBA draft. He
passed up the draft following his
junior season.
It was the second time this
season that Gathers has collapsed
on his home court during a game.
Gathers had given the 22nd
ranked Lions a 25-13 lead with a
thunderous slam dunk moments

before collapsing near midcourt
during a stoppage in play with
13:34 left in the first half of the
WCC semifinal game.
He appeared to be suffering
convulsions for a few seconds
while his mother and sister
rushed out of the stands in front
of a hushed crowd at Gersten Pa
vilion.
Gathers tried to get to his
knees, but slumped over again.
Gathers, who collapsed without
any kind of a warning, was carried
off the court about five minutes
after he went down. Three doc
tors, two from Loyola Mary
mount, began working over him
almost immediately.
