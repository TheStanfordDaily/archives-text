# A 						marriage of music and photos
## Seniors producing $36,000 multi-image Stanford show

It will cost $36,000 and take
two years to make. Six hundred
rolls of film will be shot, from
which more than 400 images
will be selected. The result? A
15-minute multi-image show
produced entirely by students,

primarily seniors Michael
Topolovac and Ken Beer.
The as-yet unnamed show will
debut next fall during the
opening weekend of the Centen
nial Celebration. It will be
shown by admissions represen
tatives at high schools around
the country, as well as at Cen
tennial fund-raising events.

The goal of the show, accord
ing to Topolovac, is to "try to
capture what it's like to be a
student." This means including
pictures of students doing every
thing from cramming for mid
terms to playing volleyball, to
gambling at Club Uj, to giving

blood, to exploring San Francisco.
"Whatever students do, we're
there," says Topolovac.
Topolovac first began to think
about producing such a show
while working on multi-image
shows using underwater photog
raphy. A multi-image show,
Topolovac explains, is "not film
and not still photography" but
rather "an intimate marriage of
music and photos" which involves
a soundtrack and multiple slide
projectors run by a computer.
Topolovac said he had always
found it difficult to tell people
what Stanford is like because you
"need to experience it." He
thought a multi-image show
might be the "next-best thing"
for conveying to people outside
the University what it's like to be
a student here. He approached
Beer with the idea, and the two
began to work on their first show,
which was entitled "Stanford
Snapshots."
That show, which was funded
solely by Topolovac, was put to
gether during the summer of
1988. It was in black and white
and consisted primarily of photos
from the archives of The Stanford
Daily, where both Beer and
Topolovac are longtime staffers.
The show debuted during Fresh
man Orientation Week in 1988
and provided freshmen with a
nine-minute look at Stanford life.
In a private screening in the
fall of 1988, "Stanford Snapshots"
was viewed by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, Dean of
Undergrdaute Admissions Jean

Fetter and Stephen Peeps of the
Centennial Campaign, among
others. One year later, Under
graduate Admissions and the Cen
tennial Campaign Operating
Committee had agreed to split the
cost of a bigger color show.
Peeps recalled being "so im
pressed" by "Stanford Snapshots"
that he knew that something big
ger "would be spectacular." He
said he found exciting the idea of
a visual presentation which shows
"what Stanford students see." He
was also impressed by the fact
that the show was student
initiated.
Fetter plans to use the show at
the 15 to 20 regional meetings
for prospective freshmen which
she and her staff arrange each
year. She explained that an im
portant goal of these meetings is
to give a visual impression of
Stanford to prospective students,
many of whom have never been
to California.
The admissions staff currently
use a video entitled "Stanford
Today," which was created four
years ago by a graduate student
in the Communication Depart
ment. The video is out-of-date
now, Fetter explained, because it
includes references to Western
Culture (now renamed Cultures,
Ideas and Values) and appear
ances by professors who are no
longer at Stanford.
While photos in "Stanford
Snapshots" were taken from The
Daily archives and went back as
far as 10 years, the photos in the
new show will not be more than
four years old and are being taken
specifically for the show. Beer and
Topolovac estimate that they will
take about 70 percent of the
photos, with other student pho

tographers contributing the
remainder.
Topolovac explained that be
cause it relied on photos from The
Daily archives, "Stanford Snap
shots" "wasn't diverse enough."
There were no photos of classes,
for example, because The Daily
would have little use for such pic
tures.
Beer emphasized that the
show's creators are "trying to be
as objective as possible." This
means that the show will include
"shots of teams losing, shots of
rainy days."
In keeping with the idea of a
total student effort, the show's
soundtrack will consist of songs
performed by Stanford a capella
groups like Fleet Street and the
Mendicants. There will also be
"ambiance sounds," such as the
noise of the crowd at Big Game,
and possibly recorded segments of
a speech by Kennedy.
Topolovac and Beer say they are
trying to incorporate Stanford's
multicultural aspects, but that
this is "certainly one of the more
difficult things to do."
They fear that a special section
devoted to the different ethnic
communities might give the im
pression that Stanford is
segregated. Instead, they are
trying to photograph people of dif
ferent backgrounds interacting
and to include photos of special
cultural events.
Beer and Topolovac both say
that they are devoting "a lot" of
time to working on the show —
between 10 and 20 hours a week.
The "big crunch" will be this sum
mer, however, when they will ac
tually put the show together in
time for its fall debut.
