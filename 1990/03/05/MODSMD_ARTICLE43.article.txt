# 'No longer isolated'
## 'Zoot Suit' creator urges Chicanos to celebrate their culture 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
The film industry must end the
"pablum and mindless violence"
in its movies and "face the world
as it is," said Luis Valdez, speak
ing before a screening of his film
"Zoot Suit" at Cubberley Audito
rium Saturday.
"We're no longer isolated into
little corners and continents," said
the critically acclaimed director of
such films as "La Bamba," urging
filmmakers to "live in the world."
"Young filmmakers should start
thinking in a global sense," he
said.
The screening was the highlight
of "Zoot Suit Week," a series of
programs sponsored by Casa
Zapata which celebrated the "pac
huco" culture, a Chicano subcul
ture which flourished in the
19405.
Describing the pachuco move
ment, Valdez said, "It went hand
in-hand with the big band sound,
the jitterbug . . . and it allowed
for easy movement, enthusiasm,
and the exuberance of youth."
"Zoot suiters," as the pachucos
were also called, wore high
waisted baggy pants, long-tailed
black coats, large-collared shirts
and wide-brimmed hats. The
"zooters" spoke a highly distinc
tive dialect called "cal6" which de
veloped in "barrios" around the
country.
The zooters were "a symbol of
resistance," said Valdez, who
wrote the Broadway play "Zoot
Suit" and also wrote and directed

the film. "[The
zoot suit move
ment] was a cul
tural manifesta
tion that repre
sented new free
dom," he said.
The play and
the movie are
loosely based on
events surround-

ing the 1942 Sleepy Lagoon mass
trial, in which 22 pachucos were
tried for the murder of a Chicano
teenager, and the 1943 Los An
geles zoot suit riots, which caused
a national stir.
Valdez said, "The racism
against zoot suiters was really a
symptomatic response to the rac
ism that existed in the core of
the nation as a whole."
The film, which was shown in
theaters in 1981, has not been
released on videocassette. Valdez
said he and others are pressuring
Universal Studios to release the
film.
About the delay in releasing his
film, Valdez explained, "The pac
huco essentially is doing his time
for being a bad boy, for standing
up and taking his proud steps on
Broadway and later on the
screen."
Valdez took his first steps in
Delano, Calif., and was raised in
the Santa Clara Valley in a mi
grant worker family. "I got hooked
on the theater when I was six,
and I started writing plays in
school," he said in an interview
after the screening. "When I was
19 I decided seriously I was going

to be a playwright."
After college, Valdez joined the
San Francisco Mime Troop for a
year, then joined the farm
workers' movement in 1964. He
then organized a farm workers'
theater in Delano which per
formed on flatbed trucks through
out the country. "It was very
direct, very political street
theater," Valdez said.
The theater group, known as
"El Teatro Campesino," still
produces plays in San Juan
Bautista, Calif. Recently the
Teatro produced the Valdez play
"We Don't Need No Stinking
Badges."
"I am a playwright by choice,"
he said. "I eryoy the writing proc
ess, as lonely as it can get."
Valdez said he is proud other
Chicanos have followed his lead.
"I've seen certain doors open —
they've got to be forced open —
but they open nevertheless," he
said. "I'm looking forward to the
future when there can be new
opportunities for filmmakers to
come along and reflect the reality
of America today."
Valdez has worked in theater,
video and film and said he enjoys
the "creative crossfeeding" that
takes place among the three. "I
like taking a play, developing char
acters, dialogue and moments and
then seeing where that can go on
video or film," he said.
With a number of projects un
derway in all three media, Valdez
emphasized the importance of
street theater as a "place to learn
the basics."
