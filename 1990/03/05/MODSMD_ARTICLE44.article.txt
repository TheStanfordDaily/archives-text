When you think about dangers to women's health, what factors come to mind? Breast
cancer? Strokes? Automobile accidents? Though all of these factors pose serious risks
to women's health, there is one danger that, though it seldom appears on this type of list,
outranks all these other factors in the number of women it affects: sexual assault.*
The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that one in three women in America
will be the victim of rape or attempted rape in her lifetime. The 1988 Stanford Rape
Project Survey on Sexual Assault revealed that one in three women at Stanford report
surviving at least one instance of sexual coercion.
The impact of sexual assault on the survivor's health, both physical and mental, is
devastating. It is only in the last decade that the full repercussions of sexual assault have
come to be recognized. Researchers have termed the aftermath of an assault as Rape
Trauma Syndrome, which has been likened to other forms of post-traumatic stress disor
ders, such as those suffered by returning veterans of the Vietnam War.
The primary symptoms of Rape Trauma Syndrome included anxiety, fear, severe
depression, and withdrawal from activity. These symptoms may be compounded by cuts,
bruises, or internal injuries suffered during the assault. Furthermore, sexual assault brings
with it the risk of contracting AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as the
possibility of unplanned pregnancy.
Why is it then, considering the frequency of sexual assaults and their severe conse
quences, that sexual assault is not thought of in the context of health risks? The answer
to this question is to be found in the attitudes surrounding sexual assault in our culture.
Sexual assault is the most underreported violent crime in America. The FBI
estimates that for every reported rape, approximately nine others have occurred. In the
last ten years, revelations about the frequency of "date rape" or "acquaintance rape"
suggest that the FBl's figures vastly underestimate the problem. This hesitancy to report
a sexual assault, particularly one in which the victim and the assailant were acquainted,
is rooted in the attitudes of both men and women toward sexual assault.
These attitudes include the acceptance of a number of myths that tend to place the re
sponsibility for the assault on the victim. The belief that only "bad girls" get raped, for
instance, implies that a sexual assault is brought on by the victim. This is often accom
panied by the sentiment that the victim "got just what she deserved." Another common
belief is that if the victim "led on" the assailant, then the victim was "asking for it." This
is particularly damaging to survivors of assaults perpetrated by an acquaintance (by far
the most prevalent form of rape).
These attitudes create a climate in which the survivor of a sexual assault is blamed
for the assault, and as a result few survivors arc willing to tell anyone at all of their assault,
much less report it to the police. The shame, guilt, and fear that accompany an assault,
contribute to the lack of reporting. Consequently, there is a general failure to recognize
the severity of the problem of sexual assault as a health risk to women and as an urgent
societal concern.
Until men and women and our institutions recognize the severity of the problem of
sexual assault and reexamine their attitudes and feelings towards it, victims will continue
to suffer quietly without the medical and psychological attention they need. Until we
work together to create an environment in which survivors of sexual assault feel that they
will be taken seriously, treated sensitively, and, most of all, not be held responsible for
their victimization, we will never understand the full impact of this problem or be able to
provide the care and support that survivors deserve.
*NOTE: Men arc also victims of sexual assault, and male survivors suffer many of the
same symptoms as female survivors. Sexual assault is by no means a "women's issue."
