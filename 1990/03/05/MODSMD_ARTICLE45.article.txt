## Our Sexual Health 
### 
Over the last decade, messages about human sexuality and sexual expression
have become increasingly negative and charged with fear. Genital chlamydia,
condyloma, herpes, and HIV infection/AIDS are words often used when describ
ing the sexual environment of college campuses as well as when discussing sexual
assault, incest, and unwanted pregnancy. In our effort to prevent lifelong suffering
and to promote reduction of risky sexual behavior, it seems that, as New York
Times columnist Susan Jacoby commented, "hardly anyone has a good word to say
about sex any more."
In this issue, we would like to send out the messages that the"it can't happen
to me" mentality is a dangerous illusion of invulnerability; that there arc no magic
bullets nor technological miracles for sexually transmitted diseases; that the
consequences of sexual decision making can often be lifelong. The danger with
these messages, however, is that students may become even more uncomfortable
with and afraid of sex in an era that is challenging us to communicate and to be open
about our most intimate selves.
So with the hope that these articles help you accept the reality of personal risk
and become more aware of the personal and cultural obstacles interfering with
adoption of safer sex behavior, we send out another message — a message that you
and those you care about have
•the right to choose whether to be sexually abstinent or sexually active,
•the right to choose when to become sexually active, and
•the right to choose with whom to become sexually active.
Our aim is neither to reassure you nor to alarm you. It is rather to remind you
that the human environment of sexual health is a complex one. We want you to
recognize that HIV infection, STDs, sexual assault, and unwanted pregnancy are
present on our campus and that you are the ultimate beneficiary of safer sex
decisions. We want you to remember that sexuality is as much of a lifelong learning
process as any part of development and that college is a time and a place to construct
and to practice sexual health habits that will enhance the quality of your life today
and throughout your lifetime.
