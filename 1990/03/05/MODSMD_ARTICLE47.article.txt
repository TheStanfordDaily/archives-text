Excerpt from Reforging Relationships:
Intimacy Without Violence, by David
Frazee and Suzanne O'Brien ofthe Stan
ford Rape Education Project.
Through metaphors, common English
phrases contribute to and perpetuate at
titudes that condone rape. The meta
phors which we commonly use to talk
about sex often create or legitimize atti
tudes which connect sex with violence,
sex with degradation, and sex with domi
nance. The following list is adapted
from Timothy Beneke's 1982workA/e/i
on Rape.
Status/objectification
Many expressions express the belief
that sexuality reflects social status. In
the process of making sex a status
based act, the opposite gender is often
reduced to objects.
SEX IS ACHIEVEMENT: I'd like to
make it with her. He's successful with
women. I went all the way with her. I
didn't get anywhere with her.
SEX IS PERFORMANCE: You were
great last night. I got rave reviews in
bed. He's good in bed. She's a good
screw.
WOMEN ARE OBJECTS: She's a
cute thing. Take off your clothes and
show me your stuff. How would you
like a little bit of that? She likes to
flaunt it. He played her like a violin.
WOMEN ARE ANIMALS: She works
like a Playboy bunny. She's real foxy.
Let's see if we can shoot some squirrel
(or beaver). She's really a dog. What a
bitch!
WOMEN ARE CHILDREN: Do you
like the girls at the office? Janice is our
playmate of the month. Hey, baby!
SEX IS FOOD: She was the best piece
of ass I ever had. What a dish!
WOMEN ARE THEIR GENITALS:
She's a cunt.
MEN ARE THEIR GENITALS: He's
been a real dick lately. What a cock.
A PENIS' LENGTH IS MANLINESS:
He's hung like a bear. He couldn't
please anyone with that thing. He's
more man than she can handle. She's
not ready for my hot beef insertion.
A SEXUALLY ACTIVE WOMAN IS
BAD: What a slut. She's a little tramp.
She'll spread for the bread.
A SEXUALLY ACTIVE MAN IS
GOOD: What a stud! He's a player.
He's a master of the bedroom.
Dominance/power
Sexuality may be tied to control or power.
It thus expresses an insecurity about
sexuality and the belief that power ine
qualities arc present.
SEX IS A HUNT, A CONQUEST: I'm
going to go out and get a piece of ass
tonight. They're going cock hunting.
He's looking for a good fuck. He tamed
her.
SEX IS BEING SERVICED BY A
WOMAN: She wouldn't put out for me.
She did it for him but she wouldn't do it
for me. Last night she gave me a blow job.
She knows how to please me.
SEX IS INSTRUCTION: I know how to
show a woman a good time. You could
learn a lot from me, baby. I could teach
her a thing or two.
SEX IS TRIUMPH: I really put it to her!
I really stuck it to her!
SEX IS TRIUMPH THROUGH IN
FLICTING PLEASURE: Boy, did I make
her moan! I got her so hot she could
hardly stand it! She was in such heat she
was begging for it.
SEX IS MADNESS: I'm wild with de
sire. Every time I look at a woman /go
crazy.
SEXUAL FEELING IS ELECTRICITY/
FLUIDS CONTROLLED BY A
WOMAN: She turns me on. She really
got my juices flowing.
FLIRTING/FOREPLAY IS ASKING
FOR INTERCOURSE: She really wants
it. She' shotfor you. She's just asking for
it.
SEX IS A POWER WOMEN HAVE
OVERMEN: She's just a cocifc teaser. If
she wouldn't give it to him, why did she
lead him on? Women can have it any
time they want it.
Possess ion/con t r ol
Also reflecting insecurity about sexual
ity, these expressions indicate that sex is
a discrete quantity that must be guarded
and possessed.
SEX IS A COMMODITY: I've never
had to pay for pussy. Why should a man
rape if he can get it for free? She wouldn't
give me any. He's not one to let an
opportunity pass him by. You got her
used. She owed it to me.
VIRGINITY IS A COMMODITY: She
lost it to him. She's damaged goods. I'm
saving it for my husband.
SEX IS POSSESSION: I'd like to have
her for a night. I bet I could get her if I
tried. I want him to have me.
Hostility/aggression
Sexuality often becomes adversarial,
which assumes a high level of game play

ing and a low level of trust. Thus, frustra
tions may develop.
SEX IS A SPORT: I hope I score tonight.
I struck out with her. I reached second
base with her. He made a pass at her.
He's playing the field.
SEX IS A GAMBLING GAME: If you
play your cards right, you'll score. Your
best bet is not to come on too strong.
SEX IS WAR: I tried to get her into bed
but got shot down. If I can wear down her
resistance, I'll score. He's always/um>ig
on women. She ignored his sexual ad
vances.
SEX IS THEFT: If she won't give it, I'm
going to take it. He's robbing the cradle.

This language and the degradation, hos

Reflections
This language and the degradation, hos

milieu that actively condones rape. Arc
the attitudes contained in these meta

language is your language?
Excerpt from Reforging Relationships:
Intimacy Without Violence, by David
Frazee and Suzanne O'Brien ofthe Stan
ford Rape Education Project.
Through metaphors, common English
phrases contribute to and perpetuate at
titudes that condone rape. The meta
phors which we commonly use to talk
about sex often create or legitimize atti
tudes which connect sex with violence,
sex with degradation, and sex with domi
nance. The following list is adapted
from Timothy Beneke's 1982workA/e/i
on Rape.
Status/objectification
Many expressions express the belief
that sexuality reflects social status. In
the process of making sex a status
based act, the opposite gender is often
reduced to objects.
SEX IS ACHIEVEMENT: I'd like to
make it with her. He's successful with
women. I went all the way with her. I
didn't get anywhere with her.
SEX IS PERFORMANCE: You were
great last night. I got rave reviews in
bed. He's good in bed. She's a good
screw.
WOMEN ARE OBJECTS: She's a
cute thing. Take off your clothes and
show me your stuff. How would you
like a little bit of that? She likes to
flaunt it. He played her like a violin.
WOMEN ARE ANIMALS: She works
like a Playboy bunny. She's real foxy.
Let's see if we can shoot some squirrel
(or beaver). She's really a dog. What a
bitch!
WOMEN ARE CHILDREN: Do you
like the girls at the office? Janice is our
playmate of the month. Hey, baby!
SEX IS FOOD: She was the best piece
of ass I ever had. What a dish!
WOMEN ARE THEIR GENITALS:
She's a cunt.
MEN ARE THEIR GENITALS: He's
been a real dick lately. What a cock.
A PENIS' LENGTH IS MANLINESS:
He's hung like a bear. He couldn't
please anyone with that thing. He's
more man than she can handle. She's
not ready for my hot beef insertion.
A SEXUALLY ACTIVE WOMAN IS
BAD: What a slut. She's a little tramp.
She'll spread for the bread.
A SEXUALLY ACTIVE MAN IS
GOOD: What a stud! He's a player.
He's a master of the bedroom.
