Excerpt from Reforging Relationships:
Intimacy Without Violence, by David
Frazee and Suzanne O'Brien ofthe Stan
ford Rape Education Project.
Through metaphors, common English
phrases contribute to and perpetuate at
titudes that condone rape. The meta
phors which we commonly use to talk
about sex often create or legitimize atti
tudes which connect sex with violence,
sex with degradation, and sex with domi
nance. The following list is adapted
from Timothy Beneke's 1982workA/e/i
on Rape.
Status/objectification
Many expressions express the belief
that sexuality reflects social status. In
the process of making sex a status
based act, the opposite gender is often
reduced to objects.
SEX IS ACHIEVEMENT: I'd like to
make it with her. He's successful with
women. I went all the way with her. I
didn't get anywhere with her.
SEX IS PERFORMANCE: You were
great last night. I got rave reviews in
bed. He's good in bed. She's a good
screw.
WOMEN ARE OBJECTS: She's a
cute thing. Take off your clothes and
show me your stuff. How would you
like a little bit of that? She likes to
flaunt it. He played her like a violin.
WOMEN ARE ANIMALS: She works
like a Playboy bunny. She's real foxy.
Let's see if we can shoot some squirrel
(or beaver). She's really a dog. What a
bitch!
WOMEN ARE CHILDREN: Do you
like the girls at the office? Janice is our
playmate of the month. Hey, baby!
SEX IS FOOD: She was the best piece
of ass I ever had. What a dish!
WOMEN ARE THEIR GENITALS:
She's a cunt.
MEN ARE THEIR GENITALS: He's
been a real dick lately. What a cock.
A PENIS' LENGTH IS MANLINESS:
He's hung like a bear. He couldn't
please anyone with that thing. He's
more man than she can handle. She's
not ready for my hot beef insertion.
A SEXUALLY ACTIVE WOMAN IS
BAD: What a slut. She's a little tramp.
She'll spread for the bread.
A SEXUALLY ACTIVE MAN IS
GOOD: What a stud! He's a player.
He's a master of the bedroom.
