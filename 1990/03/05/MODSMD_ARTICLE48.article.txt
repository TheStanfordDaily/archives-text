# Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places

Go to any bookstore shelf of self
help books and you can see our culture's
deep interest in relationships: We want
to improve our relationships, so we read
books on "How To Talk To Get Him/Hcr
To Listen" or on "How To Listen to Get
Her/Him To Talk."
There are books on

negotiating within re
lationships, asserting
oneself in a relation
ship, and problem
solving so everyone
wins. There are also
ample artifacts of our
preoccupation with
what goes wrong in re
lationships: books

about women who care too much, about
men who hate women who care too much,
about addiction played out in its many
forms within relationships. Title after
title adds testimony to our longing for the
possibility of having relationships and
the "skills" or "techniques" that will
facilitate intimacy. Yet I walk away from
all these "how to" books with a feeling
that something is missing.
What is missing from the books on
these shelves, and, I think, from our cul
tural notions on relationships, is the criti
cal importance of the relationship that we
have with ourselves. I am concerned that
current books and, more importantly,
current thinking do not adequately reflect
the centrality of intimacy with ourselves
as a first prerequisite for intimacy with

another human being.
It seems so simple and true that rela
tionships with others need time and atten
tion to grow and to flourish. Yet, are we
taught or encouraged to take as much
time in nurturing the relationship we have
with ourselves as we do with others? Are
we provided ample models of people
who give their relationship with them-

I think it is time to start talking about finding
intimacy within ourselves before turning
outward toward finding relationships, sexual or
otherwise, with other people.

selves the same time and nurturing they
give to their external relationships? How
do we view people who take their com
mitments to themselves for self-care, ex
ercise, quiet time, bc-ing as seriously as
they take their commitments to others?
A relationship with the self takes
time. It takes work and responsibility;
i.e., the "ability to respond" and to know
one's own' thoughts, feelings, values,
wants. If we do not stop to leam these
things about ourselves, we can never share
them with another person. Can we be in
timate with another person if we are cut
off from our own internal information
systems — from truly knowing what we
feel and think and who we really arc?
Having given many talks in Stanford
residence halls this year where I shared

my views on intimacy as a process with
the self and others that includes, but goes
far beyond, "sexual intimacy," I came to
learn that for many students, the word
"intimacy" equates with "sex." And not
just cuddling or physical closeness, but
genital sex. Are the concepts of "sexual"
and "intimate" inevitably linked in our
culture? Although the alcohol or ciga

rcttc industries
might like us to buy
that message,
deeper conversa
tions with young
people on this cam
pus and others
quickly show that
the real issues of the
day are "connect
ing" with other
iwinlft anH hrpnk

ing down "isolation." Will sexual activ
ity in and of itself satisfy this kind of emo
tional hunger for human intimacy?
I think it is time to start talking about
finding intimacy within ourselves before
turning outward toward finding relation
ships, sexual or otherwise, with other
people. Like so many other areas of life
in our fast-paced society, we are taught to
look first outside ourselves for intimacy
— that intimacy automatically means
"with another person." We are taught
that sex can be a short cut to instant
intimacy. I think we arc lonely for our
selves. If intimacy and healthy relation
ships depend upon each one of us first
forming a primary, loving, accepting
relationship with ourselves, perhaps we
are what is missing.
