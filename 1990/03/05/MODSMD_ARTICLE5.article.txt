# Coed by bed
## Burbank residents try rooming with the opposite sex 
### Jill Sporleder 
Coeducation took on a new
meaning last week on the third
floor of Barbank. The floor, which
is normally coed by room, became
coed by bed when six males and
six females switched rooms.
It started when senior Mark
Warren wrote a note on his resi
dent assistant's message board,
asking if people would want to
have coed roommates.
"I was so surprised. I didn't
expect anyone to respond, but a
whole bunch of people did," said
Warren.
Lara Salamacha, the third-floor
RA, wa» intrigued by the idea.
She sent around a survey, asking
the residents if they really wanted
to do a room switch.
After clearing it with the resi
dent fellows, the room switch
began last Sunday and Monday
and ended Thursday and Friday.
Each pair of coed roommates
shared a one-room double.
The students got to choose their
prospective roommates. Sal
amacha made it clear that only
platonic friends should partici
pate.
The biggest problem that the
participants noticed was logistical:
how would they change their
clothes?
Junior John Reid observed, "It
takes some adjusting, attitude
wise. You can't come walking in
in your underwear"
Most of the participants solved
this problem by changing in the
bathroom.
Overall, though, the fact that
their roommate was of a different
sex didn't seem to make that

much difference.
"It wasn't that different at all.
The main difference was that it
was somebody I didn't know that
well," sophomore Alison McCaf
free said of her coed roommate,
senior Tantek Celik.
Most of the participants cited
interesting late-night discussions
as one of the chief benefits of the
experiment.
"We are both seeing other
people, and we talked about it and
analyzed it each night before we
went to bed, and got the other
[gender's] perspective," junior
Melinda Carroll said of Reid, her
coed roommate.
Though they felt that they
learned a lot about each other,
many participants said they were
too busy talking to get much
school work done. In fact, many
noticed that the entire hall be
came much more social as a result
of the experiment.
"It really built community on
our hall," Salamacha said. "Doors
were open and people were in and
out of each other's rooms."
Warren speculated, "Maybe
people felt a little uncomfortable
at first, so they would go out into
the hall to get away from their
new roommate."
Most participants were skepti
cal about the possibility of a Uni
versity policy allowing coed

roommates.
"If you opened it up as a wide
spread policy, the first people to
[request coed rooms! would be
boyfriends and girlfriends. Two
friends who wanted to [live to
gether] would feel intimidated be
cause that stereotype would be
placed on them," McCafTree said.
However, at least one partici
pant thought the benefits would
outweigh the problems.
"I would favor it. If males and
females wanted to live in the same
room together they should be able
to do that, but by choice, not by
being put there," Reid said.
The participants interviewed
agreed the swap was a positive
experience and advocated trying
it as an experiment in other
dorms.
"I think that in a case where
you're really good friends and can
share a lot of insights with each
other, it's a really good experi
ence," Reid said. "If it were up
to me now, [Carroll] could be my
roommate for the rest of the
year."
The coed roommates are being
studied by a group of students
from Anthropology 11, "Sex Roles
and Society" Members of the class
interviewed the roommates and
will examine their perceptions in
discussion section.
