In the thirties and forties, a terrified
Hollywood imposed on itself a censor
ship strategy, known officially as the
Production Code and popularly as the
Hays Code (after Will B. Hays, who
framed it), by which it kept American
movies repressed. Bathroom sets were
built without toilets, married couples slept
in twin beds, homosexuality was never
mentioned, and adulteresses were always
either punished or killed off in the final
reel. Hollywood moviemakers subverted
these rules as best they could — the sexy
screwball comedies of the Depression
were perhaps the most creative and en
joyable of these subversions — or else
fashioned shrines to them. Some of the
shrines are pretty famous. At the end of
the 1941 Now. Vovager. Bctte Davis
chooses to preserve the sanctity of her
lover Paul Henreid's miserable marriage
and conveys her passion for him indi
rectly — through his daughter, whom
she's ensconced in her home and restored
to self-worth and happiness. "Don't let's
ask for the moon," she counsels the
impatient, impetuous Henreid,"when we
have the stars."
It's not clear what would have hap
pened if Hollywood had abandoned the
Production Code rather than allowing the
changing times to erode it. By the mid
sixties, it was no longer taken seriously.
But now, amazingly enough, Hollywood
history seems to be repeating itself —
Puritanism is once again rampant in our
movies.
Hollywood has always been the
repository of our greatest fears, as well as
the constant reflection of our latest self
image. So it's not difficult to see where
the current Puritanism derives from: a
combination of the "return-to-homespun
values" pronouncements of the Reagan
regime, which struck a chord in millions
of Americans, and the AIDS crisis, which
has caused many to wholly embrace those
traditional values. If you're heterosexual
and monogamous, goes the still-conven
tional thinking, then you're safe. The
notion of AIDS as a scourge against the
sexually unfaithful (read also "deviant"),
which can only be combattcd by a big
dose of home and family, reaches its most
hysterical height in the 1987 thriller Fatal
Attraction, where the sexual monster (a
kind of Venus mantrap) who corrupted
Michael Douglas's family — through his
genitals — is neatly eliminated in the last

minutes by his faithful, gun-wielding
spouse.
The message promulgated in some
of our most popular movies from the end
of the *80's is that sexuality itself is
dangerous, unless it's for the purposes of
propagation (Parenthood) or leads di-

rccily to the marital bed (When Harrv
Met Sallv). The weirdest example of this
new moralization is 1989's hands-down
art-house favorite, SEX. I'gS, and vide
otape. In this movie, neither of the two
characters we're intended to find appeal
ing —radiant,delicately flaky Ann (Andic
McDowell) and the damaged Christ-fig
ure Graham (James Sapder) — has sex:
he can't and she doesn't like to. The
villain of the piece is Ann's attorney
husband John (Peter Gallagher), whom
the film condemns for being sexually
dishonest — he has a raucous affair with
Ann's sister Cynthia (Laura San Gi
acomo); at the fade-out, he's left sans
wife, sans girlfriend, sans clients, sans
everything. Though the movie portrays
Ann as frigid — until she participates in
some vague, spiritual, off-camera kind of
sexual union with Graham — it takes
pains not to let that frigidity serve as
justification for John's behavior. But
John's expectant satyr smile as he lies
nude on his bed, a birthday gift for his
lover resting squarely on his crotch, is the
only sign of life in sex, lies, and vide
otape. Steven Sodcrbcrgh, the writer
director, is doing unconsciously what
shrewd Hays Code-era filmmakers did
deliberately and out of very different
motives: giving us a sexy "bad" charac
ter to revel in and then piously doling out
the consequences of his lust at the end.
When audiences go for such cau
tionary drivel, there seems to be little
hope of expressing a healthy sexuality in
our movies, or getting people to respond
in significant numbers to filmmakers who
try to. The explicit sexual content of
Philip Kaufman's Thg Upfrftlfdbltf l-ittht
ncssof Being — one of the great movies
of the eighties — put a lot of filmgoers
off. I know intelligent people who re
fused to accept the protagonist Tomas's
happy resignation, in the final scenes, to
being in love with his wife: they were so
enraged at his earlier infidelities that they
couldn't forgive him. Of course, it was
Kaufman they couldn't forgive — for

refusing to pass judgment on Tomas or
punish him, the way adulterers used to be
punished in the Hays Code days.
Faced with the less rigorous sexual
codes of other cultures' movies, movie
goers may be as confused now as many
Americans were when the first wave of

English and French imports hit this coun
try in the early sixties. I can't tell you
how many times I've heard the teenage
daughter (Sammi Davis) of John
Boorman's wonderfully fresh How and
Glorv (1987) referred to as "slutty," when
all she does is to satisfy her incipient
sexual longings by becoming romanti
cally involved with a soldier, whom she
ends up marrying after he gets her preg
nant —behavior that, a decade ago, might
well have been viewed as a rather con

ventional playing out of adolescent sexu
ality. And American filmgoers are so
repulsed by the unsentimental erotic di
rectness of the older man (Tom Bell) who
carries on an affair with the teenage hero
ine (Emily Lloyd) of Wish You Were
Here (19871 that almost no one I've spo
ken to who saw the picture was willing to
acknowledge his clumsy attempts at sen
sitivity or affection, or her refusal to
accept his efforts — even though the
writer-director, David Leland, carefully
includes scenes that frustrate a moralistic
reading of the movie.
This situation won't change, I'm
afraid, until the times themselves change.
In the meantime, we can enjoy the few
movies that are neither Utopian nor judg
mental about sex — like the new Ene
mies. A Love Storv. We can still rent the
vivifying films of the British director
Stephen Frears: Mv Beautiful Laun
drette (where the lovers are both interra
cial and gay) and Dangerous Liaisons.
And we can always resist when a movie
preaches to us (a common factor in al
most every successful American release
in the past year, from Dead Poets Society
to Crimes and Misdemeanors, though the
topic of the sermon isn't always sex).
Whenever a filmmaker presents us with
characters whose sexual proclivities leave
a distinct odor of moral decrepitude, the
best response to the movie is probably
wary skepticism.
