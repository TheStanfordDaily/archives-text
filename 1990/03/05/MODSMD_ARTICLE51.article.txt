# The
						Kiss
## 
### 
Just friends we were
exploring the morning air
openness abound
Vulnerability growing
fear fades to grey
closer and closer
two hearts together
reaching to touch
Head cradled in hands
Heart touched, held
Body caressed by heaven's hands
Edges fade to the bright light of openness
Sun and Moon are as one
Barriers melted, labels dissolved
Lips reach to touch and celebrate
if only in the mind
Everyone knows
Boys don't kiss Boys
Even in living dreams
