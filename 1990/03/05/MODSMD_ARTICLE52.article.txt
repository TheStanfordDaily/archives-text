### Dennis J. McShane, M.D. Associate Professor of Immunology 
Dr. McShane, who has been in private
practice with the URSUS Medical Group
in Redwood City since 1983, has a long
history of service to the gay community
as a primary care physician and of treat
ing persons with the full spectrum of HIV
disease. Dr. McShane has been actively
involved with treatment study protocols
through Stanford University and the
Clinical Consortium of the Peninsula.
As we enter into the second decade
of the AIDS epidemic, the clinical man
agement of Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) infection, AIDS Related
Complex (ARC), and AIDS, with its as
sociated opportunistic infections and
diseases, has been strengthened by im
portant continuing basic and clinical
research. With the introduction of azido
thymidine (AZT) in 1987 to inhibit viral
replication in infected cells, the first real
breakthrough in combating the underly
ing infectious cause of AIDS was
achieved. Recent clinical studies have
further substantiated the use of AZT in
AIDS treatment and have strengthened
the rationale for its use earlier in the
clinical course of Human Immunodefi
ciency Virus (HIV) infection. This ar
ticle will briefly outline the direction of
investigation in developing effcctiveclini
cal treatments for HIV infection (ARC,
AIDS) and the immune deficiency.
Prevention
The best treatment for HIV is pre
vention, i.e., not to acquire the infection
in the first place. Educational efforts
directed at reducing those behaviors con
sidered to be high risk for the transmis
sion or acquisition need to be continuous.
Since the virus is primarily transmitted
via sexual intercourse and intravenous
routes, any individual engaging in inter
course or using intravenous drugs should
consider himself or herself to be "at risk"
for exposure to HIV and should take the
time to become informed about "high
risk behaviors" and the appropriate pre
cautions needed to block transmission of
HIV virus. While immunization against
the HIV virus is the ultimate goal of
current investigation, the development of
practical strategies to achieving this goal
is many years away. Thus, the responsi
bility for avoiding exposure to HIV in
fection rests ultimately with individual
behavior.
Research into development of vac
cines capable of preventing the infection
with HIV is active and ongoing. Much of
this investigation is occurring with the
SIV virus (a virus similar to HIV that
xcurs in monkeys). Dr. Jonas Salk (of

polio vaccine fame) is working with a
vaccine made from whole killed HIV in
chimpanzees.
Many investigators consider the
use of whole virus vaccines to be a less
optimal approach and much effort is being
devoted to developing antibodies to the
HIV virus coat protein, antibodies which
would cause loss of ability to infect the
host cell. This will continue to be an
active area of research for the foreseeable
future.
Some of the more difficult as
pects of developing and proving that a
particular vaccine will prevent infection

The rapidity of advancement of our understanding of
HIV biology and development of substances capable of
modulating the effects of this infection in the fight against
AIDS over the past several years has been impressive.

in humans are the relatively low trans
mission rate of HIV infection and the
long incubation period. Thus, to prove
that a vaccine is effective, many years of
postvaccination study will have to be
built into clinical trials.
Anti-HIV Treatment
Therapeutic strategies directed at
HIV take the form of developing agents
capableof interrupting viral development
at key points in its life cycle. These
points include: (1) binding to the cell sur
face receptor, (2) cell entry, (3) produc
tion of viral DN A from the viral RNA, (4)
integration of viral DNA into host chro
mosomes, (5) interference with viral
accelerator genes, (6) transcription, trans
lation, and protein production of viral
genome, (7) viral assembly, and (8) viral
shedding.
The HIV virus employs a cell sur
face receptor protein as an entry point for
its surface protein. Once attached to this
receptor the virus is capable of gaining
entry into the cell. One therapeutic ap
proach employs artificially manufactured
receptor proteins that serve as "decoys"
to attract free HIV virus, thereby "mop
ping up" free virus before it can contact
an uninfected cell. Clinical trials are
underway at the AIDS Clinical Treat
ment Center at Stanford under the direc
tion of Dr. Thomas Merigan and his col
laborating investigators to study this ap
proach. Antibodies directed at portions
of the HIV surface proteins are being
examined for their ability to block the
viral receptor thereby neutralizing the

ability of the virus to attach to the cell
surface.
Peptide-T and Dextran sulfate have
been studied as substances which might
block viral attachment. Castanospcrminc
from Australian chestnut tree seeds is
also being examined in the lab for its
effects at interfering with viral cell entry
after binding.
Therapeutic efforts at preventing
viral replication after the virus gains entry
into the cell have been directed at devel
oping agents that interfere with the en
zyme which is required by the virus to
create a DN A copy of the HIV viral RNA.

Azidothymidinc (AZT) was the first drug
shown lo be clinically effective in this
regard and has resulted in improved sur
vival in individuals infected with HIV.
AZT achieves its effect by causing pre
mature DNA chain termination resulting
in incomplete viral replication.
Didcoxycytidine (DDC) and Dide
oxyinosinc (DDI) are currently under
active investigation at Stanford by Dr.
Mcrigan's group and across the country
as potential additional agents in this class

of drugs. It is too early yet to determine
if these agents are belter or as effective as
AZT in this action but preliminary clini
cal studies have been encouraging.
The HIV virus has a gene termed
"tat" which acts to accelerate viral mes
senger RNA production. This gene when
activated produces a protein product that
causes viral replication to accelerate
dramatically. Agents are being tested in
the lab for their ability to interfere with
the action of this gene product. Imuthiol
(DTC) has been studied in 250 individu
als for its effects on inhibiting this protein
and the results of clinical trial are pend-

ing.
Compounds to interrupt viral pro
tein production prior to viral particle
assembly in the cytoplasm of the infected
cell have also been examined. Interfer
ons are substances produced by virally
infected cells that play a role in contain
ing the infection by interfering with in
fection of uninfected cells and with viral
assembly. Study of these compounds for
