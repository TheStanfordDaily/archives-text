# "Check Me For Everything"

### John Dorman, M. D Irene Plattner Cannon, M.D. Cowell Student Health Center Physicians 
Tcn years ago when sexually active
students came to Cowcll requesting a
" VD check," that usually meant a request
to be checked for gonorrhea (gc) and
syphilis. In those days, there were two or
three cases of gc a month, and perhaps
one or two cases of syphilis in a year. In
order to make a diagnosis, the doctor
would order a blood lest for syphilis and
either do a urinalysis (in men) or a swab
and culture of the possibly infected area
(urethra, cervix, throat, or rectum) for gc.
Today the situation is different. "VD"
or venereal disease is now referred to as
"STD," or sexually transmitted disease.
While gc and syphilis are still potential
threats, they are now relatively uncom
mon in the student population. In 1989
there were only two cases of gc and no
cases of syphilis diagnosed at Cowcll.
The most common types of STD on
campus today are chlamydia and genital
warts.
Chlamydia is a bacterium which
lives only inside cells and thus does not
grow on regular cultures. Ten years ago
there was no good test for this bacterium,
and the symptoms that were caused by
chlamydia were known as "non-gono
coccal urethritis" in men or "pelvic in
flammatory disease" in women. Today
there is an easily performed lest for ch
lamydia. In the past year there have been
70 positive chlamydia screens at Cowcll,
most of them in women without any
symptoms. Women under the age of 25
who do not use barrier contraceptives
(condom, diaphragm) and who have had
a new sexual partner arc statistically most
likely to have a silent chlamydia infec
tion. The symptoms in men arc similar to
those of gc, although usually milder:
burning during urination and discharge
from the penis. And although the major
ity of chlamydia infections in men cause
symptoms, most of the men who transmit
the infection to women arc probably those
who don't have symptoms. Women, as a
rule, will have no clear symptoms at all;
they may eventually get lower abdominal
pain from an infection of the tubes, which
can become a significant contributing
factor in possible future fertility prob
lems. Testing for chlamydia in women
involves collecting a few cells with a
swab from the urethra or the cervix. Test
ing in men is done with a urethral swab;
screening for evidence of inflammation
can often be done using a urine specimen.
Genital warts (condylomata) arc
caused by the human papilloma virus, or
HPV. They were formerly thought to be
just benign annoyances; however, today

we know that certain strains may play a
significant role in causing abnormal Pap
tests and perhaps even cervical cancer in
women. Unfortunately, the diagnostic
techniques for HPV are still in the primi
tive stages. Unless the warts are large
enough to be seen, there is no easy way to
diagnose them. Sometimes soaking the
genital area in acetic acid (vinegar) may
make the warts more apparent; magnifi
cation also is helpful. This type of evalu
ation is often recommended for asympto
matic partners of persons with a definite
HPV infection. In general, routine an
nual Pap smears in women offer the best
diagnostic screen to detect early abnor
malities in women caused by the pres
ence of HPV. Colposcopy, a special
magnification technique for examining
the cervix, is also helpful in selected
cases. Of note also is the consideration
that condoms may not reliably protect
against HPV, as the base of the penis is
uncovered.
Herpes simplex (genital herpes) is
a viral infection that seems less serious
a threat today than was previously be
lieved. Whereas doctors formerly were
concerned that herpes caused cervical
cancer and birth problems, it now ap

pears that the cervical changes thought to
be due to herpes were probably caused by
HPV; furthermore, we now believe that
herpes at the time of delivery is relatively
innocuous unless it is primary (first time)
herpes. In the latter case the infection
may be transmitted to the baby at the time
of delivery, but this can be avoided by
performance of a Caesarian section.
Herpes may also cause cold sores around
the mouth, which can be transmitted to
the partner's genitalia if oral sex is prac
ticed at this time. However, although
herpes can be cultured from cold sores or
genital lesions, it is generally not useful
to try to culture herpes from individuals
without symptoms. As with HPV, con
doms may not always protect against
herpes infections.
Infection with the HIV virus which
causes AIDS is obviously the STD about
which there is the most concern, as there
is at present no curative treatment. Al
though the virus is not particularly conta
gious, it is potentially transmitted by body
fluids, particularly blood, semen, and
vaginal secretions. Early diagnosis en
ables early treatment with zidovudine
(AZT), which appears to prolong the
asymptomatic period and delay the onset

of AIDS. However, even after infection
with the HIV virus, the blood test for the
HIV antibody does not generally become
positive for three to six months, and thus
testing is generally not recommended
until six months after the potential expo
sure. Testing for the HIV antibody is
anonymous at Cowell, except that the
physician knows your identity; no infor
mation about the test is recorded in your
medical chart.
In summary, "checking for every
thing" has a very different meaning today
than it did ten years ago. For a man with
no genital sores or warts, "checking me
for everything" means a urine test for gc,
a urethral swab for chlamydia, and blood
tests for syphilis and the HIV antibody at
the appropriate times. For a woman with
no genital sores or warts, it means having
cervical swabs for gc and chlamydia, as
well as the two blood tests. In either sex,
throat and rectum are inspected for HPV
and cultured for gonorrhea as indicated.
Obviously, being sexually active in
the 1990's carries some potential risk if
not done in a responsible manner. If you
choose to be sexually active, communi-
cation with your partner about any his
tory of previous STDs and about the use
of safe sex practices is a responsibility
which belongs to both of you. Such
communication should go a long way in
decreasing fear and anxiety about the
possibility of contracting a sexually trans
mitted disease.
