### Michael Ramsey-Perez Assistant Dean, Student Affairs 
One Sunday in early November, I
was reading an article in the Examiner
about scientific and political develop
ments surrounding AIDS. A regular
feature of the Examiner, it included a
listing of people who had died of AIDS
the previous week. (It is a sad commen
tary on our times that people my age are
now regularly reading obituaries — an
activity I had associated with my grand
parents' generation.) That morning I
read that Leonard, the last man with whom
I'd been sexually intimate, had died.
I was stunned. About three dozen
friends and colleagues have died in the
last several years, but this was the first
time a sexual partner had suffered from
AIDS. I hadn't spoken to Leonard in
three years or heard anything about him.
I was sad that I learned of his death
through the newspaper. Sad that he didn't
think he could or ought to call me. I felt
anger that he died, and wondered how he

had been exposed to the virus. And, yes,
I was frightened for myself.
Leonard shouldn't have had to die.
He had access to information (indeed, the
last time we saw each other, he described
to me a research project he was designing
with a friend about AIDS and health care
providers). He was on the faculty at
Berkeley and was active in the gay com
munity. But somehow the information
about how to protect himself got to him
too late.
I think a lot about Leonard and my
friends. We need to care about ourselves
and each other. In our intimate relation
ships we need to honor our lives and take
care for each other. I fear for my friends'
safety when I hear stories of them not
consistently practicing safer sex. One
friend spent most of last winter trying to
shake off a parasitic infection he con
tracted after practicing unsafe sex. I love
him too dearly not to worry about him. It
pained me to see this normally athletic
young man lose weight, suffer from
debilitating malaise and fatigue, and be

unable to do the things that bring him joy.
In our conversations I now routinely rein
force with him the necessity of taking
care of himself and his partner, of trans
lating the knowledge he has to life-saving
actions.
Leonard's obituary noted that he had
written four college texts. It didn't
mention his cats, his vast collection of

orchids and cymbidia, his wizardry in the
kitchcn, or his pcnchant for taking the
long walk from his home to his campus
office.
I shall always wonder what he was
thinking and feeling his last few months,
and hope he was surrounded by loving
friends.
