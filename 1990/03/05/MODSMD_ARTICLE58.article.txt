# Commonly Held Myths About Rape
## 
### 
Excerpt from Reforging Relationships:
Intimacy Without Violence, by David
Frazee and Suzanne O'Brien of the Stan
ford Rape Education Project.
Myth: Most rapes are committed by
strangers.
Reality: The vast majority of all rapes are
committed by acquaintances. In national
studies, up to 87% of survivors knew
their assailants. At Stanford, 98% of
survivors of sexual coercion knew their
assailant. Though rape laws make no dis
tinction between rapists who know their
victims and rapists who are strangers to
their victims, a person who is raped by an
acquaintance is more likely to blame her
or himself for the rape and less likely to
receive sympathy and support from oth
ers than a person who is raped by a
stranger.
Myth: Rape does not happen at Stan
ford or to Stanford students.
Reality: Forced sexual activity does
happen at Stanford as it does at every
university and college. 32% of women
and 12% of men at Stanford reported that
they had engaged in vaginal, oral, or anal
intercourse because they were coerced
into it.
Myth: Some people deserve to be raped.

Reality: No matter how a person is
dressed, whether she or he goes back to a
date's room, has had sex with that date
before, or has agreed to some degree of
sexual activity, no person deserves to be
raped. Rape is a traumatic experience for
all those who survive it.
Myth: Survivors lie about rape to get
back at others or to cover their own
guilt feelings about having sex.
Reality: Of rapes that are reported, the
false report rate is about 2%, lower than
most other crimes. Most survivors meet
with skepticism and often experience har
assment and trauma after reporting. The
result of this skepticism is that only 3-5%
of all rapes are reported at all.
Myth: Men need to have sex to avoid
"blue balls." Once a man is sexually
aroused, he can't help it if he forces sex
on a woman.
Reality: Men don't need to have sex any
more than women do. Men are able to
control themselves when aroused and
any suggestion otherwise reduces men to
animalistic subservience, helpless and
unable to control their own urges.
Myth: If a person is drunk or stoned,
that person can't be held responsible
for raping.

Reality: Rape is rape regardless of the
menial impairment of the assailant (or the
survivor). The law holds people respon
sible for their behavior at al 1 states of self
induced impairment. Rape under the
influence of alcohol or drugs is not ex
cusable.
Myth: Men can't be raped.
Reality: Men are raped. Men can feel
overly pressured to engage in intercourse,
or they can be overpowered or threatened
by force. Sexual violence against men is
real. Rape happens to men far less often
than to women. Contrary to popular
myths, the majority of men who rape men
are not homosexual.
Myth: I don't have to worry about
rape because it won't happen to me.
Reality: Rape happens to people from all
classes, races, and sexual orientations.
No one is immune from the threat of rape.
Even if you are never raped, it affects the
way you are able to relate intimately to
others and it is likely that people close to
you will be raped. For all these reasons,
rape is of concern to everyone and only
when everyone feels a responsibility to
work against rape will real change take
place.
