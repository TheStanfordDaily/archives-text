# It's What You Do, Not Who You Are: Behavior, Risks, and Protection
## 
### 
It's what you do, not who you are that matters in HIV infection. "Risk behaviors" are much more important than "risk groups." Anyone
who engages in unsafe sexual behavior or shares needles for any reason can become infected with HIV. HIV can be transmitted during
sexual intercourse between people who define themselves as gay, straight, or bisexual. HIV can be transmitted during needle sharing
by people who may or may not be "addicted" to drugs. And "risk behaviors" means the past as well as the present. Unsafe sex or
needle-sharing a few years ago still matters now, even if someone no longer has unsafe sex or shares needles.

Behaviors and Risks
A number of factors contribute to the spread of AIDS:
•Illusions of Invulnerability
Some people know a great deal about HIV and AIDS. But
people who know these things still acquire HIV infection. A
lot of people think "it can't happen to me." They see HIV
infection as a problem for "other" kinds of people in "other"
places; they feel invulnerable. But behaviors, not groups,
transmit HIV. More and more people who fit into none of the
original "high risk" categories have acquired HIV infection.
•Lack of Skills
Many people are unskilled in discussing sexual matters or
activities or in managing relationships. Talking about sex can
seem embarrassing and uncomfortable. Communicating as
sertively about your desires in a sexual relationship is a real
challenge.
•Sex without Consent
Acquaintance rape ("date rape") is quite common. When men
or women are coerced into sexual activity, or are unable to give
consent (often because they arc intoxicated), there are usually
no precautions taken to prevent transmitting HIV.
•Alcohol and Drugs
Alcohol and other recreational drugs play a big part in sexual
activity. Alcohol and drugs may make sexual activity seem
easier; they may remove uncertainty, ambivalence, and deci
sion-making too. Alcohol and drugs can make communication
difficult — and they can blur the issue of consent. Drunk sex
is rarely safer sex.
•Social Pressures
We may all feel pressure to conform to our perceptions of
society's expectations. As a result, a lot of people have sex
unsafely. Men may feel expected to be aggressive about sex.
Women may feel reluctant to be assertive in sexual relation
ships and may fear rejection if they refuse sex.

Protecting Yourself
You can reduce your risk of acquiring HIV by:
•Making careful choices about sexual activity.
Not having anal, vaginal, or oral sexual intercourse provides
100% protection against the sexual transmission of HIV. If
you do have intercourse, your specific sexual practices arc just
as important as the number of partners you have. Unsafe inter
course without a condom with one or two partners may be
more likely to result in HIV infection than safer sex with
several partners.
•Communicating assertively with your sexual partner.
Develop skills to express your feelings and concerns; consider
in advance what you would say and do in particular situations.
For example, what would you say to someone who wanted to
have intercourse without a condom? Asking a partner about
past sexual experiences may be helpful too, but, in general,
you cannot depend on that information. Communication alone
is not enough to protect you.
•Removing alcohol and drugs from sexual activity.
Know your limits when you drink, and learn skills for keeping
yourself safe. Remember, SUI (Sex Under the Influence) is
just as dangerous as DUI (Driving Under the Influence). Don't
let alcohol become a way to avoid taking responsibility for
your own health.
•Using latex condoms for intercourse.
Whenever you engage in anal or vaginal intercourse, use a
latex condom. Condoms are not perfect, and they do not
provide "safe sex." Nonetheless, a condom, if used properly,
provides high levels of protection against the transmission of
HIV. Latex (rubber) condoms provide predictable protection.
Animal membrane (skin) condoms cannot be counted on.
Learn to use condoms correctly.
•Refusing to share needles.
Whether you use a needle to inject drugs or steroids, never
share a needle used by someone else. If you are using needles
to inject drugs, consider seeking help; also, learn how to clean
needles to reduce the likelihood of acquiring HIV.
