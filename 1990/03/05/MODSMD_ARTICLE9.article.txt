# SLE frosh broaden horizons
## Living with upperclassmen has opened new doors 
### Cecilia Tom 
Freshmen in the Structured
Liberal Education program are
finding this year that living with
upperclassmen can be a more
horizon-broadening — and some
times more divisive — experience
than living only with other fresh
men.
This year, Cardenal and Faisan,
four-class dorms in Florence
Moore Hall, have opened their
doors to students in the selective
Cultures, Ideas and Values track.
Suzanne Greenberg, SLE pro
gram coordinator, said the change
was made to allow SLE students
more interaction with upperclass
men. All freshmen in Cardenal
and Faisan are in SLE.
SLE freshmen who want to live
in an all-frosh dorm still have the
opportunity, however. "We try to
honor what students choose,"
Greenberg said. These students
can live in Alondra, an all
freshman dorm in which SLE stu
dents are paired with freshmen in
other CIV tracks.
Attitudes have been generally

positive about the change. Step
hen Fuller, a SLE tutor and Flo
Mo resident fellow, remarked that
"the camaraderie is excellent" in
the four-class dorms.
SLE students in the past have
sometimes suffered from
stereotypes that portray them as
being an exclusive group that
studies intensely all the time.
Jenny Tseng, a resident assis
tant in Cardenal, was skeptical
about the change when she first
heard about it. "A lot of upper
classmen have stereotypes of SLE
people, but things actually worked
out very well," she said. "In an
all-frosh dorm, non-SLE frosh
may feel excluded, but upperclass
men don't really care about CIV
because they're done with it."
But Faisan RA Carol Fred en
said she thinks "upperclassmen
don't in general like SLE." They
think SLE is "monopolizing" be
cause it creates difficulties in pro
gramming dorm activities, she
said.
"Some [upperclassmenl can't
handle the intellectualism," added
Faisan freshman Chris Stanek.

"They tend to leave dinner tables"
when discussions start, he said,
However, intellectual conversa
tions are not the only focus in
SLE dorms. As Tseng said, it is
"the sense of community and the
feeling as a cohesive unit" that
matters. "The students talk about
Plato mostly when they have a
paper due. They don't talk about
Plato during parties," she said.
"Socially, I think Alondra is bet
ter because there is tons of fresh
man enthusiasm," Freden said.
"It is necessary that SLE frosh
live together in some capacity for
moral support. However, an all-
SLE dorm will drive them crazy
with stress."
For some, though, the stress of
the SLE experience brings people
together rather than driving them
apart.
"I like it here because when we
have papers due, we can bounce
ideas off each other. We don't have
to go halfway across campus to
find someone to talk to," said
Alondra SLE freshman Rachel
Fouche. "SLE is our binding fac
tor," she added.
