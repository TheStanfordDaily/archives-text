Due to increasing liability, the Sigma Chi Fraternity's Risk
Management Program has required all chapters nationwide
to close their parties. 1 lie Alpha Omega Chapter here at
Stanford must comply or lose insurance coverage. In the past,
our parties have been completely open to the entire campus.
Although we do not want to change this relaxed system, it is
becoming increasingly difficult, to monitor the activities of all
guests at a large social function. The members of our
fraternity can be held personally liable for the activities of our
guests, sometimes even after they have left our party. Our
goal then, is to reduce our liability while excluding as few
people as possible from our parties.
We have come up with a solution which is a compromise
between hosting open parties and adopting a completely
exclusive party policy, while still staying within the bounds of
our insurance policy. Effective immediately, anyone entering
any of our parties must either be on our master guest list or
present a party invitation at the door. Each member of our
fraternity will help to formulate a temporary master list of
students they know who may attend one of our parties. So as
not to exclude students whom we haven't yet had the
opportunity to meet, Sigma Chi members will be extending
temporary invitations to interested party-goers and will make
visits to campus residences to briefly explain the new policy.
We will continue our efforts to make these invitations
available to freshmen and other members of the Stanford
community with whom we become acquainted.
No party-goer should feel excluded from our parties, but
please make sure you are on the guest list or have an
invitation before making the walk to our house. Also, don't
forget to bring your Stanford 1.1). For more information,
please contact any member of Sigma Chi at 853-8834 or stop
by our house.
