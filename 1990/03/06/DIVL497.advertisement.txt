What is the meaning ot Africa and of being African'' What is and what is not
African philosophy l Is philosophy part of Africanism "> These are the kinds of
fundamental questions that this book addresses
VY Mudimbe argues that the various discourses themselves establish the
worlds of thought in which people conceive their identity Western anthropoto
gists and missionaries have introduced distortions not only for outsiders but also
for Africans trying to understand them serves
Mudimbe goes beyond the classic issues of African anthropology or history
He says that the book attempts an archaeology of African gnosis as a system
of knowledge in which ma|or philosophical questions recently have arisen first,
concerning the form the content, and the style of Africanizing knowledge sec
ond concerning the status erf traditional systems of thought He is dlrectty con
cerned with the processes of transformation of different types of knowledge
Mudimbe s historical anthropology achieves the decolonization of aca
demic knowledge of Africa This highly sophisticated, innovative, and
provocative study should command the attention of every scholar"
