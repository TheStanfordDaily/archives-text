# Hospital nurses vote to strike next week
## 1,400-member union endorses Monday walkout 
### Lena Slachmuijlder Staff writer 
The nurses' union at Stanford
Hospital last night voted over
whelmingly to strike next week if
its dispute with the hospital is
not resolved before Monday.
The final count, announced at
10 p.m., was 1,166 in favor and
76 against.
Negotiations will continue
throughout this week, but if no
agreement is reached, the 1,400-
person nurses' union will go on
strike at 6:45 a.m. March 12. A
federal negotiator was brought in
to mediate the dispute last week,
but no progess has been made.
"The hospital hasn't taken us
seriously," said Donalda Dunnett,
spokesperson for the Committee
for Recognition of Nursing
Achievement. She said she hopes
the negotiations will improve
after the hospital administration
hears of the strike vote results.
If a strike occurs, the union
will supply the hospital "safe pa
tient care" nurses, who will be

available to serve patients who are
unable to be transferred, are in
critical condition or are in need
of services only available at Stan
ford Hospital.
The rest of the nurses, exclud
ing nursing managers, who con
stitute about 5 percent of the
nursing staff, will participate in
the strike.
Dunnett said that if the strike
begins Monday, she thinks the
hospital probably will bring in
other nurses to assume the
strikers' duties.
The negotiations are currently
at a standstill on all three issues
on the table. First, the nurses
want the hospital's current wage
policy changed so newer nurses
will no longer receive larger per
centage wage increases than more
experienced nurses.
Second, the nurses oppose a
hospital proposal that would
decrease the nurse-to-patient
ratio.
Third, the union wants to in
troduce a mechanism by which
nurses could petition for consulta

tion with a nursing manager when
requested to perform a procedure
they feel is unsafe for the patient.
According to Dunnett, such a pro
cedure is common at many other
hospitals.
A nurse's decision of whether
to strike is "a difficult, emotional
issue," Dunnett said, but the
union members feel very strongly
about the demands.


Nurses from Stanford Hospital cast votes yesterday afternoon on whether or not to go on strike. The voting
took place in Fairchild Auditorium.
