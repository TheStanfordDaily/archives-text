# Library shuttle may be canned
## Service runs between Stanford and UC-Berkeley 
### Jill Daniels Staff writer 
The Gutenberg Express bus
service between Stanford and UC-
Berkeley may be discontinued
July 1, according to a knowledge
able source in the University li
brary system.
The decision has not yet been
finalized but should be completed
sometime next week, the source
said.
Projections indicate 7,000
riders will use the shuttle this
year, a significant decline from
past yearly totals of 11,000 to
12,000 people. Only 15 percent of
riders are expected to use the
shuttle for its intended purpose:

to go to the other campus' library.
The shuttle costs $80,000 a year
to operate, with user fees provid
ing about $25,000, according to
the source. The balance is sub
sidized by the Stanford and
Berkeley library systems.
Most use the shuttle, which
runs twice a day Monday through
Friday, to commute to jobs or to
attend classes, making library
funding of the bus service inap
propriate, according to the source.
Chris Doyle, one of the two
Gutenberg drivers, said he has
heard that Stanford "is trying to
pull their money out."
However, the Stanford library
employee said Berkeley recently
withdrew a portion of its funding

for the bus, which meant Stanford
would be responsible for subsidiz
ing $30,000, up from the approx
imately $27,500 it has been paying
annually.
In addition, Stanford libraries
are facing significant budget
reductions.
According to David Weber, di
rector of University libraries, "the
University is considering msyor
programmatic repositioning" with
budget cuts forcing programs to
be reduced.
Weber added that alternatives
to the Gutenberg Express are un
der consideration, and a final de
cision about the shuttle's fate
should be released in the next two
weeks.
