# 'Unparalleled' or 'bad'?
## Merit of fraternities' existence debated last night 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
The "unparalleled" social and
leadership opportunities afforded
by the Greek system justify its
existence on campus, Interfrater
nity Council President Todd Or
tega argued in an Oxford-style
debate last night.
However, Twain resident fellow
Denis Phillips, arguing for the op
position, called fraternities "bad"
organizations which are not in ac
cordance with the University's ed
ucational goals.
The issue of whether fraterni
ties are a positive influence at
Stanford was debated before a
predominantly male audience of
about 50 people in the Florence
Moore Hall main lounge last
night.
The debate, moderated by Flo
Mo resident fellow John Pearson,
included statements from four
panelists and incorporated audi
ence views as well.
Ortega opened the debate, de

scribing fraternities as providing
a "supportive environment that's
difficult to find anywhere, even
at Stanford." Older fraternity
members, according to Ortega,
can provide personal, social and
academic guidance-
Ortega pointed to the over
whelming representation of fra
ternity men among U.S. leaders,
including Supreme Court justices,
presidents and Fortune 500 busi
nessmen as evidence of the lead
ership qualities fostered in
fraternal organizations.
Greek organizations, according
to Ortega, also serve the commu
nity in levels unequaled by any
other residential or social organ
ization on campus. He pointed to
Kappa Alpha's $10,000 contribu
tion to the Muscular Dystrophy
Association as an example.
However, senior Daphne Ed
mundson, a former member of the
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority,
argued that social life, not com
munity service, is the main pur
pose of sororities.

Edmundson described the selec
tive process of Rush as causing
homogenization of members — a
situation which often leads to so
cial prejudice, she argued.
This prejudice, Edmundson
said, extends along gender lines
as well. Citing the figure that nine
out of 10 gang rapes in the coun
try occur during or after frater
nity parties, she described the
atmosphere in fraternities as in
herently leading to a "volatile sit
uation" for women.
For fraternal affairs adviser Mi
chael Hughes, the Greek system
"provides a means by which I, as
an educator, can educate and in
teract with students."
However, Phillips said the
"criteria for admission [into
Greek organizations! aren't aca
demic and have nothing to do with
the purpose of the University."
Once individuals are admitted
to a Greek organization, they tend
to behave in accordance with the
social expectations placed on
them, Phillips said.
