Radicals lead in election
MOSCOW (AP) - Candidates who want
faster reform won elections across the nation's
Slavic heartland and Boris N. Yeltsin easily
gained a legislative seat in the Russian repub
lic, unofficial returns indicated yesterday.
Yeltsin has said he will seek the presidency
of the republic, which traditionally means a
place on the Communist Party's ruling Polit
buro. That could return the Communist
maverick to the membership he lost in Feb
ruary 1988 for advocating speedier change.
Leaders of popular movements in the
Ukraine and Byelorussia, an outspoken tele
vision commentator in Leningrad and a defiant
editor in Moscow also appeared to have won
in Sunday's local and republic elections.
Activists said strong showings in this round
nearly guaranteed victories in runoff elections
for candidates who want to step up the pace
of reforms begun by President Mikhail Gor
bachev. The runoffs are expected in two weeks.
Kohl defends stand
BONN, West Germany (AP) - Chancellor
Helmut Kohl yesterday defended his demand
that a guarantee of Poland's border be linked
to Warsaw's renunciation of war reparations,
saying Poland has been demanding compensa
tion for forced laborers used in the Third
Reich.
In East Berlin, meanwhile, Communists and
opposition parties agreed to submit a broad
social charter to lawmakers in both Germanys
designed to protect East Germans against so
cial hardships once the countries merge under
a capitalist system.
Kohl's refusal to give Poland guarantees
about its border has led to a widening split
with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
and the two met privately yesterday to discuss
the issue. Results of the meeting were not
made public.
Genscher has been saying that West Ger
many must make clear to its neighbors that
a unified Germany would not be a threat.
"This not only concerns Poland's trust, but
that of all Europeans," he told the ZDF tele
vision network.
PLO defies Jerusalem
JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestinians from the
occupied lands will serve on a delegation to
talks with Israel only if the PLO chooses it,
leaders in the territories said yesterday.
Israel insists the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization have no role in peace negotiations.
Hawks in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
conservative Likud bloc oppose U.S. efforts to
arrange talks with the Palestinians.
Shamir called a of Likud Cabinet
ministers yesterday night to try to break a
deadlock over compromises, proposed by the
United States, aimed at choosing a Palestinian
delegation acceptable to Israel.
A statement issued yesterday and signed by
34 leaders in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
said: "No Palestinian from the Israeli-occupied
territories will participate in any delegation
that is not formed or announced by the PLO."
Soviet unrest escalates
MOSCOW (AP) - A Soviet official said yes
terday that four people were killed in ethnic
rioting in an Uzbekistan city but activists said
30 people had died from violence sparked by
an election dispute.
Interior Ministry spokesman Dmitri Selez
nev said in a telephone interview that about
5,000 people gathered Saturday in Parkent, a
city 30 miles from the Uzbekistan capital Tash
kent, to demand the removal of Meshketian
Turkish refugees.
The crowd attacked the district police head
quarters and burned it down after authorities
stopped them from attacking refugees' homes,
he said.
One soldier and three civilians were killed
in the fighting, and 92 people were injured,
including 60 police and Interior Ministry sol
diers, he said.
Cease-fire may end
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) - A week before
elections, Colombia's cocaine barons have
declared a "state of alert" in a message that
suggests they intend to end a 6-week-old cease
fire in their war against the government.
The announcement Sunday by the Ex
traditables, the name adopted by the Medellin
drug cartel, came a day after President Virgilio
Barco announced he will keep extraditing sus
pected drug traffickers instead of trying them
in Colombia as they have requested.
