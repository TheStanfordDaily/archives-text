# Military takes over in black homeland
## 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — South Africa sent troops into
the black homeland of Ciskei yesterday
to quell widespread looting and arson
following a military coup that ousted
the territory's authoritarian president.
Brig. Gen. Oupa Gqozo of the Ciskei
army, who seized power Sunday, told
cheering supporters the African Na
tional Congress and other anti
apartheid groups would be allowed to
operate freely under his new govern
ment.
South African Foreign Minister Pik
Botha said his government intervened
at the request of Gqozo, who led the
bloodless coup in the nominally inde
pendent homeland on the Indian Ocean
coast.
More than 50 factories, many owned
by Israelis and Taiwanese, were set
afire in a second day of rioting and
looting in several parts of Ciskei, wit
nesses said. Two hotels and dozens of
vehicles also were burned, they said.
There were no deaths reported in
Sunday's coup, but doctors at Cecilia
Makilwane Hospital said three people
were fatally stabbed and dozens more
injured in the subsequent rioting.
Rioters, many of them drunk, broke
into shops, removed goods and then
set buildings ablaze with firebombs,
the witnesses said. Looters used wheel
barrows to haul away stoves, refriger
ators and other items, officials said.
Witnesses said the looting spread
yesterday evening to the black and
mixed-race townships outside the
South African port city of East Lon
don, about 40 miles from Ciskei's cap
ital of Bisho.
Botha said yesterday that his gov
ernment would not "entertain any re
quest" to intervene in the homeland,
but the troops were sent in shortly
afterward when the looting began
again.
Gqozo received a rousing cheer yes
terday when he told thousands of
people at a stadium in Bisho that the
African National Congress and other
anti-apartheid groups would be free
to engage in political activity in Ciskei.
Gqozo made the announcement fol
lowing meetings yesterday with the
ANC-aligned United Democratic
Front.
"We have extended the hand of
friendship" to the Front, Gqozo said.
He said he believed Ciskei residents
would back his government if it had
the support of the Front and other
anti-apartheid organizations.
In contrast, deposed President Len

nox Sebe suppressed anti-apartheid ac
tivism in the homeland and detained
hundreds of opponents.
Ciskei, a 3,600-square-mile territory
of about 1 million people, is one of 10
black homelands in South Africa. None
is recognized as sovereign by any coun
try other than South Africa.
South Africa established the
homelands in the 1960s to try to create
separate, tribal-based states for blacks,
while whites would retain control of
national politics and the economy.
Neither Botha nor Gqozo, the coup
leader, said how many South African
troops were sent to Ciskei.
Botha declined to say if South Africa
would recognize the military govern
ment, although Pretoria has recog

nized the military rulers that came to
power in a coup two years ago in the
neighboring Transkei homeland.
Gqozo, 36, said he was encouraged
that South Africa sent troops to help
control the unrest and that South
Africa had given no indication it op
posed the new government.
Foreign investors, mostly Israelis
and Taiwanese, own most of the in
dustries in Ciskei. The previous gov
ernment attracted foreign capital with
generous subsidies that paid all the
wages of workers making about $50
a month.
Residents said the factories were a
symbol of Sebe's oppressive rule and
people were burning them because of
the poor pay and working conditions.

But many of the people who looted
shops were simply taking advantage
of the lawlessness, others said.
Gqozo said he and three other offi
cers in the Ciskei Defense Force had
formed a Council of State to run the
government.
He also said he would like to see
Ciskei relinquish its nominal indepen
dence and return to South Africa. The
Transkei homeland is considering a
similar plan. The South African gov
ernment has not taken a position on
homelands that want to return to
South Africa.
Sebe was in Hong Kong on a trade
mission when the military struck. He
remained at a Hong Kong hotel yes
terday.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) — South Africa sent troops into
the black homeland of Ciskei yesterday
to quell widespread looting and arson
following a military coup that ousted
the territory's authoritarian president.
Brig. Gen. Oupa Gqozo of the Ciskei
army, who seized power Sunday, told
cheering supporters the African Na
tional Congress and other anti
apartheid groups would be allowed to
operate freely under his new govern
ment.
South African Foreign Minister Pik
Botha said his government intervened
at the request of Gqozo, who led the
bloodless coup in the nominally inde
pendent homeland on the Indian Ocean
coast.
More than 50 factories, many owned
by Israelis and Taiwanese, were set
afire in a second day of rioting and
looting in several parts of Ciskei, wit
nesses said. Two hotels and dozens of
vehicles also were burned, they said.
There were no deaths reported in
Sunday's coup, but doctors at Cecilia
Makilwane Hospital said three people
were fatally stabbed and dozens more
injured in the subsequent rioting.
Rioters, many of them drunk, broke
into shops, removed goods and then
set buildings ablaze with firebombs,
the witnesses said. Looters used wheel
barrows to haul away stoves, refriger
ators and other items, officials said.
Witnesses said the looting spread
yesterday evening to the black and
mixed-race townships outside the
South African port city of East Lon
don, about 40 miles from Ciskei's cap
ital of Bisho.
Botha said yesterday that his gov
ernment would not "entertain any re
quest" to intervene in the homeland,
but the troops were sent in shortly
afterward when the looting began
again.
Gqozo received a rousing cheer yes
terday when he told thousands of
people at a stadium in Bisho that the
African National Congress and other
anti-apartheid groups would be free
to engage in political activity in Ciskei.
Gqozo made the announcement fol
lowing meetings yesterday with the
ANC-aligned United Democratic
Front.
"We have extended the hand of
friendship" to the Front, Gqozo said.
He said he believed Ciskei residents
would back his government if it had
the support of the Front and other
anti-apartheid organizations.
In contrast, deposed President Len

nox Sebe suppressed anti-apartheid ac
tivism in the homeland and detained
hundreds of opponents.
Ciskei, a 3,600-square-mile territory
of about 1 million people, is one of 10
black homelands in South Africa. None
is recognized as sovereign by any coun
try other than South Africa.
South Africa established the
homelands in the 1960s to try to create
separate, tribal-based states for blacks,
while whites would retain control of
national politics and the economy.
Neither Botha nor Gqozo, the coup
leader, said how many South African
troops were sent to Ciskei.
Botha declined to say if South Africa
would recognize the military govern
ment, although Pretoria has recog

nized the military rulers that came to
power in a coup two years ago in the
neighboring Transkei homeland.
Gqozo, 36, said he was encouraged
that South Africa sent troops to help
control the unrest and that South
Africa had given no indication it op
posed the new government.
Foreign investors, mostly Israelis
and Taiwanese, own most of the in
dustries in Ciskei. The previous gov
ernment attracted foreign capital with
generous subsidies that paid all the
wages of workers making about $50
a month.
Residents said the factories were a
symbol of Sebe's oppressive rule and
people were burning them because of
the poor pay and working conditions.

But many of the people who looted
shops were simply taking advantage
of the lawlessness, others said.
Gqozo said he and three other offi
cers in the Ciskei Defense Force had
formed a Council of State to run the
government.
He also said he would like to see
Ciskei relinquish its nominal indepen
dence and return to South Africa. The
Transkei homeland is considering a
similar plan. The South African gov
ernment has not taken a position on
homelands that want to return to
South Africa.
Sebe was in Hong Kong on a trade
mission when the military struck. He
remained at a Hong Kong hotel yes
terday.
