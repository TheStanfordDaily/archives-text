# Mongolians begin to resent Soviet influence

ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) -
Mongolians are showing resentment of
the generations of domination by Mos
cow that began when their country
followed the Soviet Union to commu
nism in the early 19205.
Growing anti-Soviet feeling is ex
pressed in many ways, from heated
exchanges between Mongolian jour
nalists and Soviet diplomats to a hissed
"Russkie!" when a Mongolian driver
mistook an American for a Russian.
Soviet influence has been strong
since the founding of the Mongolian
People's Republic. When its two neigh
bors, China and the Soviet Union,
parted over ideology in the 1950'5,

Mongolia sided with Moscow.
A foreign reporter who had spent
five years in the Soviet Union de
scribed Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital,
as "a typical Russian town."
The Mongolian language is written
in Cyrillic, the same script as Russian.
Nearly all educated Mongolians speak
Russian and almost till intellectuals
studied in the Soviet Union, which
has put a great deal of money into
the vast pastoral nation of only 2 mil
lion people.
Ulan Bator's debt to Moscow has
been estimated by Western economists
at the equivalent of nearly $6 billion.
In recent years, Mongolians have

begun emerging from the Soviet
shadow. Nationalism, which some
times takes the form of anti-Sovietism,
is growing.
Mongolia revised the words to its
national anthem last week, returning
to original lyrics that do not mention
the Soviet Union, according to the
Communist Party newspaper Unen.
Primary schools began teaching
traditional Mongolian script two years
ago, and Mongolian adults who never
were taught to read or write their own
language are learning.
Among the demands of new political
groups are withdrawal of the esti
mated 60,000 Soviet troops stationed

along Mongolia's border with China
and removal of the approximately
50,000 Soviet specialists and their
families.
On Friday, the Kremlin said all
troops would be out by 1992.
Resentment was obvious last week
in the conduct of Mongolian jour
nalists during a news conference at
the Soviet Embassy on economic
cooperation.
They bombarded Ambassador Vasily
Sitnikov with questions on topics rang
ing from how Mongolia's debt to the
Soviet Union would be calculated to
why Soviet specialists in Ulan Bator
built a wall around their living area.
