Death law revised
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday overturned a
key portion of North Carolina's death
penalty law in a decision that might
invalidate the sentences of the state's
85 death row inmates.
By a 6-3 vote, the justices set aside
a North Carolina murderer's death
sentence, reaffirming a decision that
makes it easier for capital case jurors
to consider all "mitigating evidence."
"Essentially, the system that was
condemned is the system we've been
using since 1977 for sentencing

people to death," said Raleigh lawyer
Malcolm R. Hunter Jr., who repre
sented the death row inmate involved
in yesterday's decision.
"It could have a very broad im
pact," Hunter said of yesterday's de
cision.
Court closes door
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court slammed shut the
federal courthouse door yesterday to
fresh appeals by many convicted
criminals, including death row in
mates.

Dispute termed irrelevant
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday ruled that a
dispute between Florida and an
Illinois-based bank holding company
blocked by Florida from setting up
an industrial savings bank has be
come legally irrelevant.
The court unanimously ruled that
a 1987 federal law giving states spe
cific authority to block such moves
by out-of-state bank holding compan
ies has rendered the dispute moot.
The decision is a victory for Flor
ida, but a setback for Continental

Bank Corp.
The court last June agreed to
review the case even though Bush
administration lawyers told the jus
tices the 1987 change in federal
banking law had made the case moot.
Appeal rejected
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court, in a case stemming
from the 1981 settlement of the Iran
hostage crisis, yesterday rejected an
appeal by a Cleveland, Ohio, company
seeking to avoid paying $3.6 million
to Iran.
