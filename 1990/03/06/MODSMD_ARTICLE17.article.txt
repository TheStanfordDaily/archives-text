## Women's turn now 
### 
STANFORD'S LARGEST mi
nority group was excluded
from the report of the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Is
sues, but it is now scheduled to
receive a report of its own.
The University has been contem
plating funding a Women's Needs
Assessment Group that would ac
complish for gender what the
UCMI did for race.
The group will determine "how
undergraduate and graduate
women are faring in the commu
nity [andl make sure there are no
institutional stumbling blocks for
women to receive a fulfilling edu
cation," according to Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Michael Jack
son.
Women comprise 43.5 percent of
the student body. Yet, daily they
are confronted by a community
and curriculum which regularly ig

nores their needs.
Stanford is seriously lacking in
female role models for students;
only 11.7 percent of the faculty are
women. Ajid, aside from Feminist
Studies classes, basic courses often
ignore the contributions and expe
riences of women.
In addition, the group should ex
amine the prevalence of sexist acts
in student residences. While racist
language and acts are largely con
demned and students are encour
aged to report them, there is no
protocol or precedent for combat
ting sexism in dormitories.
Officials will be meeting next
week to further consider the study,
and with the Office of Student Af
fairs, Residential Education and
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter all interested in developing
such a report, the University
should authorize the group.
