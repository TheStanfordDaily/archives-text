# Eliminate refunds
## 
### 
IT'S ABOUT TIME the ASSU
puts its money where its mouth
is and corrects the inefficient
and unfair fee refund system.
To date, fee refunds have done
little more than provide "pizza
money" for unthinking students
and leave some deserving student
groups underfunded and strug
gling. A recently proposed system
would abolish refunds, but cut stu
dent fees by $25, allow conscious
objectors to redirect their money
and save the ASSU $1,500.
For the ASSU to truly support
student groups, as it claims it does,
the new special fee proposal must
be adopted. The first step will be
taken tonight when the senate
votes whether to place the pro
posed constitutional amendment
on the spring election ballot.
Clearly, this issue must be
brought to a student vote. But the
ASSU's responsibility does not end
with placing the proposal on the

ballot.
It must undertake an educa
tional campaign to explain to stu
dents the value of the new system
and make a commitment to proving
that the old way — although it
provided individuals with a little
extra pocket money — succeeded
mostly in hurting student groups.
Unfortunately, the abolition of
fee refunds will probably lower
voting turnout, because many stu
dents vote for the sole purpose of
being able to claim their money
the following year.
This creates another complica
tion because the ASSU Bylaws
state that a student group must
receive the approval of 15 percent
of the student body to be funded.
A drop in voter turnout could
leave some groups still in jeopardy.
This means the ASSU faces the
additional task of creating a new
voting incentive.
