Roble play contained homophobic and sexist slurs

WE ARE WRITING to express
our utter disappointment with
the Roble Hall play "Sexual
Perversity in Chicago." The play was
sexist, homophobic and generally offen
sive, and we are disappointed that
Stanford students actually produced
and presented this and that the audi
ence responded favorably to such a
production.
First, we would like to acknowledge
that much time and effort must have
been devoted to this production. Every
thing from the acting to the technical
aspects of the play was excellent.
Our gripe is not with those involved
with the production; as far as the crew
is concerned, we are only disappointed
that they produced a play such as this
for entertainment purposes, with no
apparent thought to its implications.
Most disappointing of all was the
audience's reaction — cheering on a
clearly sexist character and approving
the constant harassment of the women
in the play. Bernie, whose vocabulary
consists of "fuck," "cock-teaser" and

the like, whom many would agree is
rude, obnoxious and vulgar, has man
aged to capture the limelight of this
play.
The audience cheers him on when he
harasses Joan at the bar. When she
throws her drink in his face, the audi
ence boos as if Bernie is the victim of
her harassment. Violence and conflict
between genders are just now begin
ning to come to the forefront, yet not
only do we see a dorm putting on a
production of this nature, but an
audience that is clearly relishing it.
Take, for example, Bernie's story of
King Feruk who during sex with a
woman orders the construction of a
railroad "right past her headboard." At
the point of climax, the king orders a
locomotive to pass through the house.
The woman responds to the collapse of
her house with "What's that?" and the
king replies, "That, my dear, was a
choo-choo." Then he beats her.
The message here is that women are
dumb and are objects to be used,
beaten and discarded. This is the type

of "humor" at which the audience
laughed! As we perceived it, the
laughter was not nervous laughter, but
a genuine sign of having been enter
tained.
Moreover, we found that Roble's
production of the play left the female
characters undeveloped. Deb, who at
first refuses to go out with Dan, is
next found in bed with him. This
scenario could be interpreted as "what
women really mean when they say 'no'
is 'yes'. "
We also found the play to foster
homophobic remarks. An example of
this is Danny's question to Debbie
when she tells him that she is a les
bian: "Is this a political issue or a
personal preference?" The remark
seems to imply that gay people are not
"really so," that they are gay because
of their political beliefs and are "bound
to get over it."
Given all this, we have pondered the
question: "Why was this particular
play chosen to be produced?" Was it
meant to be an educational tool? One

intended to be a vehicle for discussions
on gender issues? We think not.
If it was produced for entertainment
purposes, as it clearly seems to have
been, Roble's production of "Sexual
Perversity" is an example of exactly
why issues of gender need to be
brought to prominence on this campus.
We are not by any means claiming to
be on our moral high horse; what we
assert is that the members of this
community must learn to think twice
— three or four times if needed —
about the effects of what we say, do
and laugh at.
What was said and done cannot now
be changed. However, we urge those
who participated in the production and
those who were in the audience to
reflect on their reactions to this pro
duction.
