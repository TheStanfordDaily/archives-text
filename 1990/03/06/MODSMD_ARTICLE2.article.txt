# Kennedy to Webb:
## Settle labor dispute or forfeit lease 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy said
Stanford's month-to-month rental arrange
ment with Webb Ranch may be terminated if
the ranch and the United Stanford Workers
do not settle their ongoing labor dispute.

In a statement released yes
terday, Kennedy said, "Let me
state the University's interest
as plainly as I can. The land
in question . . . may be put to
academic use. . . . Moreover,
we do not believe that agricul
tural use in the future is likely
to be the 'optimal' use."
As long as the Webbs con
tinue to lease the land for

agricultural use, however, Kennedy said the
University will require the ranch's compliance
with "commonly accepted standards for fair
and lawful agricultural employment," which a
collective bargaining agreement ordinarily pro
vides.
Urging the two parties to reach an agree
ment, Kennedy renewed the University's Jan
uary offer to serve as a neutral mediator in
the negotiations, which have dragged on for
almost 10 months.
In an interview, Kennedy said the University
"chose not to put a specific time line" on its
request but indicated its desire to see con
structive bargaining "in terms of weeks, not
months."
The 237-acre ranch is located on Stanford's
academic reserve, and according to the terms
of the lease, the University may withdraw a
portion or all of its land to use for academic
programs.
Since a four-year lease expired at the end
of August, the University has been renting
the land on a month-to-month basis to the
Webbs, who have occupied it since 1922. Ac
cording to Kennedy's statement, this lease ex
tension is a "temporary arrangement, which
accommodated the needs of the parties for the
time necessary to complete a successful nego
tiation."
In the statement, Kennedy reiterated the
University's previous statements of concern
over allegations of unfair employment and
housing practices against ranch workers by
the Webbs.
Kennedy recognized that "even 'good faith'
labor-management negotiations often appear
contentious and hostile, and that final agree
ment is not always easy.
"(liven the relatively small number of ranch
employees, limited size and complexity of the
farm, the University hoped (when negotiations
began) that such an agreement would be
promptly achieved," he said.
Kennedy said the University met with rep
resentatives of the ranch and the USW last
week, who both expressed the intent to resume
negotiations with a commitment to reach a
settlement.
