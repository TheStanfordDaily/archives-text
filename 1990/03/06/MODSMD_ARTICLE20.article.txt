# Need to bring back Dead Week primal scream tradition
## 
### 
There u&ed to be a time, not so long
ago, when late every evening during
Dead Week (at midnight) one could
hear great shrieks of agony rising up
from the innards of hundreds of un
dergraduates.
For years, this tradition of "letting it
all hang out" through a collective bel
low was one of the highlights of the
week preceding finals. And I think it
did a world of good for all who partici

pated in it. People could yell out their
anxieties and fears, let the universe
know that students suffer too, and just
generally decompress. John Rickford,
the resident fellow at Arroyo House,
tells me that he knew students who
would not miss "the scream" or "the
primal scream" for anything.
Then, two years ago, the dorm
bashers took over the scream. They
yelled nasty and mean things about
other dorms, sometimes even using
microphones and speakers.
At the beginning of Dead Week,
Brannerites (as I understand it)
started by hurling water balloons and
a lot of "Trancos sucks" across the
street. Naturally this was followed by
retaliations, especially a lot of "Bran-

ner sucks."
By Wednesday night at the appointed
hour in which there used to be "the
scream," some people from both houses
came out on their lawns for more
mutual verbal abuse. Added to the
verbal missile were food service
oranges and apples.
Plus, by mid-week, fragments of
other dorms had joined in, and the
nightly chorus had swelled to include
"Toyon sucks" and "Stern, eat me"
and even "SoCal bites it."
Now, there were some comic mo
ments in all of this (like the Trancos
student Nir\ja who fouled a Branner
attack) and some of it was just dorm
spirit. But, beyond this, it looked like a
case of dorm spirit deteriorating into

dorm tribalism.
So, I appeal to the xenophobes — to
the dorm people who like degrading
other dorms — to give us back "the
scream." Let's go back to the good ol'
ritual of heaping abuse on injustices of
the quarter. The quarter is a hard
race. Near the end, when all mercy
appears to have run out, when there
are no more extensions possible on
research papers, etc., people need to
"scream."
We should be lifting our tortured
guts into our throats and — that's
right - SCREAMING. TOGETHER!
We deserve a nightly global Wagnerian
yell, not some puny dorm-centric
taunts. Bring back the pure scream!
