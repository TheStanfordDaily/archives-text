## Collapse of communism 
### 
THE "COLLAPSE of communism"
in what once was known as the
East Bloc has, curiously enough,
spurred talk in this country about the
death of anti-communism. The recent
shifts in Eastern Europe and the develop
ments in the Gorbachev foreign policy
have indeed made vigilant anti
communism, in the military sense, an
outdated policy. However, the collapse of
communism should not be mistaken for
anything less than the triumph of our
ideas and values.
The sweeping away of the Eastern Eu
ropean communist parties born out of
Stalinist expansionism represents the re
jection of Marxist-Leninist ideas about
the ordering of society, polity and econ
omy. The changes in the nature of East-
West relations have been the result of
the Soviet Union responding to our
longstanding agenda.
Since 1945, it has been the United
States' conviction that the Red Army is
far too large for defensive purposes. It
has been our conviction that the Iron
Curtain has been an unnatural and harm
ful division of Europe. It has been our
conviction that the communist parties'
claim to a monopoly on power has stifled
intellectual freedom, impeded the right
to worship freely, trampled on the free
dom of expression and deprived the
people of the ability to choose the kind
of government and policies they want by
denying them free and fair elections.
The past year has seen at least the
partial vindication of these beliefs. The
Soviet Union has begun to reduce the
size and scope of its military presence.

Eastern Europe has ceased to be a bar
ricaded region, and will at last resume
the normal and essential economic and
political relations with the West. And fi
nally, pluralism has started to take hold.
Dissent is being tolerated, and in some
cases, it is protected.
The past year has also exposed the
farce of legitimacy which Marxist regimes
have traditionally claimed. By calling mil
itary victories "people's revolutions," and
by calling the force of arms the will of
the people, communist regimes, from the
Bolsheviks in 1917 to the Sandinistas in
1979, have based their legitimacy on an
ideology that sanctifies authoritarianism
as the proper outcome of historical pro
gression.
This kind of right to rule has been
shown to be devoid of any real support
from the people. When presented with
the opportunity to vote against their
rulers, everyone, from the Poles to the
Nicaraguans, has solidly rejected them.
The Nicaraguan people obviously felt
intimidated by the Sandinistas (an accu
rate poll could not be taken as the people
were afraid to speak honestly with poll
takers because they were thought to be
government officials). In spite of this,
and in spite of the periodic closings of
Chamorro's newspaper La Prensa, Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro beat the Sandinis
tas at the ballot box.
And yet, for some people on this
campus, that the U.S. government sup
ports a non-communist government is
enough for them to oppose it. And if a
self-styled Marxist opposes the United
States and finds it to be the greatest

source of racism, imperialism and oppres
sion, then this leader is the recipient of
their most passionate support.
The collapse of communism is just that,
and certainly should not be construed as
discrediting the opposition to Marxist-
Leninist thought.
John F. Kennedy said it best in 1963
while in Berlin: "There are many people
in the world who really don't understand
— or say they don't — what is the great
issue between the free world and the
communist world. Let them come to Ber
lin. There are some who say that com
munism is the wave of the future. Let
them come to Berlin."
Yes, let them come to Berlin today.
