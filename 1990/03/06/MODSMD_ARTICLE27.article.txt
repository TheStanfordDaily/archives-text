"In fiction. . .excellence resides
in divergence," asserts Margaret
Atwood in her introduction to The
Best American Short Stories
1989. The variety of tones, set
tings and subjects of this year's
20 distinct, absorbing stories
reflects this belief.
Atwood chose the stories while
"reading blind" — that is, without
knowing the authors' names.
What are her criteria for decid
ing if a story deserves the classi
fication "best" (a superlative that
is relative and, Atwood notes,
which should be used cautiously)?
Atwood's standards are sound, il
luminating and generously uni
versal: a story must captivate the
reader's attention with its "voice"
— its subject matter and style
synthesized in such a way as to
absorb the reader's attention
through narrative buildup and
fulfill the promise that such de
velopment will ultimately be
resolved in a satisfying sense of
imaginative closure.
The writer must, of course, ex
ecute this denouement skillfully,
with a turning point that "must
be at one and the same time com
pletely unexpected and inevita
ble." Finally, Atwood suggests
that the writer must tell his or
her story with "a sense of urgency
.. . with as much intentness as if
the teller's life depended on it."
In this last criterion, Atwood is
astutely on target. Fiction is, by
definition, distanced from reality.
But the attraction and pleasure
one finds in literature comes ex
actly from the sense that this
story matters significantly to
someone (the author, of course,
and to different degrees, the au
dience), that high art organizes
extremely real, universal conflicts

and creates evocative implica
tions. Good fiction invites the
reader to interpret and participate
in art.
The 20 short stories in this an
thology ask enthusiastically to be
interpreted and enjoyed. I would
like to describe briefly three of
the stories that I think were the
"best of the best."
"The Flowers of Boredom"
strikes me as critically apropos
for a technology-oriented univer
sity like Stanford: it chronicles
the banality and mindlessness
which often plague military bu
reaucracy and engineering organ
izations, climaxing finally in the
disturbing suggestion that, de
spite all of humankind's efforts
to control the world via technol
ogy, "a great dark .. . consensus
.. . [nevertheless] sweeps things
along to their inevitable conclu
sion."
The merit of Rick DeMarinis'
"The Flowers of Boredom"
doesn't rest in its subject — every
one is aware of the horrors of
nuclear war and the inefficiency
of military bureaucracy — but in
the author's quiet, haunting
depiction of each moment moving
prosaically to reveal the cosmic
implications of living in the nu
clear age.
Robert Boswell's "Living to Be
a Hundred" is one of several
stories in the anthology that ex
plore the unhappy conflicts be
tween husband and wife. What
this story does so well is to convey
an unbearable sense of tortured,
psychological tension through the
symbol of heat. Married seven
years and having endured "a lot
of lousy jobs and bad apartments,"
the narrator Castellani, an ar
chaeologist wanna-be turned dis
illusioned construction worker,
and his wife Linda have just
moved into a house and are work
ing strenuously to piece together
carpet scraps to cover their living
room floor during a heat wave.
Linda, exhausted and disap

pointed by unfulfilled dreams,
wants to leave Castellani and have
an affair with Harvis, Castellani's
best friend: the intense summer
heat comes to symbolize Linda's
passion, Harvis' anxiety about
betraying his friend and all the
emotional strain experienced by
the three main characters.
Intermixed with these erotic
scenes are the ghastly electrocu
tion of a cat that supercharges
the story's already tense, hot at
mosphere, the jeering sessions
that Harvis must endure from a
fellow construction worker and
Castellani's nostalgic musings
about the life he could have led
as an archaeologist.
As pessimistic and turbulent as
these scenes may be, the story
nevertheless ends with tentative
hope — "a thing of wonder" —
for the couple, but only after one
final act of explosive, passionate
violence that dispells the un
bearable heat of trapped bodies.
People struggling with parental
authoritarianism (i.e. your par
ents insist you become either a
doctor, engineer or lawyer) will
enjoy "The Boy on the Train," a
hilarious, illuminating portrayal
of two generations of sons and
fathers who fail to empathize with
each other.
One additional feature that
makes this collection a pleasure
to read is the section,
"Contributors' Notes," in which
the 20 contributing authors relate
the inspirations and histories of
their tales. This section gives
readers the opportunity to judge
the stories by comparing their re
sponses to the stories with the
authors' expressed intentions for
their individual pieces.

cal realism in contemporary
literature.
