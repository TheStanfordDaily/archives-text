"People in Trouble" is the story
of Molly, Kate and Peter, set on
the lower East Side of Manhattan
at the decaying end of the 20th
century Molly and Kate are in
love, or at least deeply in lust
with each other. Kate and Peter
are married, maybe in love, but
definitely tied together by the
bonds of habit and a fear of being
alone. Woven through the account
of Molly and Kate's affair, and
Kate and Peter's marriage, is the
empowering story of an AIDS po
litical action group called "Jus
tice" (read: ACT-UP).
Molly, Kate and Peter make an
awkward threesome: Molly is the
younger woman, the lesbian, who
works in a movie theater. Molly
doesn't have much money, but she
doesn't need much either. She
mostly needs to be loved. Kate is
the older woman, just past 40, a
successful artist who sports a
buzz cut of bright orange hair
and believes that her art is her
politics. She remains insistent
throughout the book that she is
not "a man-hating lesbian."
Kate's husband, Peter, is an art
ist as well but not as successful;
he makes a living staging theater
productions and complaining that
his work is not appreciated. He's
afraid of losing his wife, and now
that she is having a lesbian affair
he doesn't understand why he has
to be "slapped in the face by
homosexuality practically every
day."
"People in Trouble" tells the
story of love and politics in a
world where people are dying and
there is too much hate. Molly and
Kate become involved in the clan
destine activities of Justice; the
loving, angry and witty people in
this group do battle against an
intolerant and greedy society that
refuses to respond to the crisis in
health care exposed by the AIDS
epidemic.
Evil is personified in the char
acter of one Ronald Horne, a real
estate mogul who owns far too
much of New York City and even
decides to run for mayor.
The book's most moving scenes
revolve around Justice, and its
members who are organizing and
active and dying, all at the same
time. One of the group's actions
involves collecting credit card
numbers from the unsuspecting
wealthy, Visas and Mastercards
from people with AIDS and the
recent dead.
The idea is to have the corpo
rations pay for food for the sick
and homeless, clothing for bat
tered women and construction
materials for the Lower East Side
Squatters. Cardinal Spellman
("That's Miss Spellman to you")
delivers a report on the wildly
successful action to the following
Justice meeting, blessing the
crowd with holy seltzer and end
ing her account with the following
statement:

teenagers appeared in loincloths,
hoisted her excellency up on a
huge Plexiglass cross and hauled
her away in a sea of kisses.
'Oh Father,' cooed Miss Spel

Ghost.' "
This is the best of camp, and
the writing is sharp and funny.
It is also among the members of
Justice that our heroine, Molly,
feels at home and begins to
recover a sense of herself as a
whole person, someone who
deserves to be loved.
To date, "People in Trouble"
has received mixed reviews in the
gay press. I found the first half
of the book uneven, in large part
because the narrative voice has
to account for widely divergent
views: straight stereotypes of gay
life (as articulated by Peter and
Kate), Molly's view of the world
as a lesbian and the sharp political
vision associated with Justice.
This problem is resolved in the
second half of the book, which
focuses less on introducing the
characters, and becomes more
unified around their involvement
in Justice.
The book is difficult to read
precisely because it articulates the
complexities of gay and lesbian
life. These complexities involve
the struggle to love amidst the
hate of homophobia and the terror

of death and AIDS.
The real estate magnate,
Home, is quite explicit about put
ting all those people with AIDS
in internment camps, and Kate's
nagging insistence that she's not
a "man-hater" reminds us that
loving women is mistaken for
hating men. Molly's quiet battle
with Kate and Peter's homopho
bia makes for particularly hard
reading; it raises the unpleasant
specter of the fear and hate we
live with in our own lives and all
too often discover in ourselves.
"People in Trouble" is an im
portant book that raises difficult
issues for the gay community. It
is eloquent in its portrayal of the
suffering we have to endure, even
if it does get boring at points
reading about a bad straight re
lationship. But there are moments
of hope (like the mysterious Sam,
a cowgirl right out of the '50s,
who rides to Molly's rescue at just
the right moment) and certainly
anger and laughter. Even if the
ending isn't entirely happy, it's
real, and there's a lot to be said
for that these davs.

is eloquent in its portrayal of the

of hope (like the mysterious Sam,
a cowgirl right out of the '50s,

People in Trouble
By Sarah Schulman
E.P. Dutton, $17.95, 228 pages
Reviewed by Deb Amory
"People in Trouble" is the story
of Molly, Kate and Peter, set on
the lower East Side of Manhattan
at the decaying end of the 20th
century Molly and Kate are in
love, or at least deeply in lust
with each other. Kate and Peter
are married, maybe in love, but
definitely tied together by the
bonds of habit and a fear of being
alone. Woven through the account
of Molly and Kate's affair, and
Kate and Peter's marriage, is the
empowering story of an AIDS po
litical action group called "Jus
tice" (read: ACT-UP).
Molly, Kate and Peter make an
awkward threesome: Molly is the
younger woman, the lesbian, who
works in a movie theater. Molly
doesn't have much money, but she
doesn't need much either. She
mostly needs to be loved. Kate is
the older woman, just past 40, a
successful artist who sports a
buzz cut of bright orange hair
and believes that her art is her
politics. She remains insistent
throughout the book that she is
not "a man-hating lesbian."
Kate's husband, Peter, is an art
ist as well but not as successful;
he makes a living staging theater
productions and complaining that
his work is not appreciated. He's
afraid of losing his wife, and now
that she is having a lesbian affair
he doesn't understand why he has
to be "slapped in the face by
homosexuality practically every
day."
"People in Trouble" tells the
story of love and politics in a
world where people are dying and
there is too much hate. Molly and
Kate become involved in the clan
destine activities of Justice; the
loving, angry and witty people in
this group do battle against an
intolerant and greedy society that
refuses to respond to the crisis in
health care exposed by the AIDS
epidemic.
Evil is personified in the char
acter of one Ronald Horne, a real
estate mogul who owns far too
much of New York City and even
decides to run for mayor.
The book's most moving scenes
revolve around Justice, and its
members who are organizing and
active and dying, all at the same
