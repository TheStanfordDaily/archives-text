## Yer outta here! Card sends ASU home with loss; second game called 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Earlier this year, Arizona
State's 18 inning, 6-5 victory over
UCLA on Feb. 23 was dubbed
"the longest game" by the Sun
Devils. However, yesterday's epic
doubleheader at Sunken Diamond
relegated the five hour and 36
minute battle at Packard Stadium
to mere warm-up status.

Cardinal 7, Sun Devils 7

Stanford unleashed the heavy
artillery in game one, scoring 12
runs in the first five innings en
route to a 14-8 victory. In the
nightcap, the Cardinal rallied for
six runs in the final two innings
to steal victory away from the
Sun Devils.

However, after rain had washed
away two games on the weekend,
the second game yesterday was
postponed again because of dark
ness. Stanford forced postpone

ment with three runs in the ninth,
locking the game at 7-7. Piay is
scheduled to resume on Monday,
April 9 at Sunken Diamond, with
the Sun Devils batting in the top
of the 10th inning.
After dropping two of three to
Southern California last weekend,
Stanford, ranked third in the na
tion, improves to 17-5, 5-3 in the
Pacific 10 Conference's Southern
Division. Arizona State, fifth
ranked in the Baseball America
preseason poll and 10th currently,
falls to 16-9, 2-5 in the Six-Pac.
Play began yesterday at Sunken
Diamond at 11 a.m., and seven
hours later it was Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess who was beaming
about his club's performance as
the Cardinal emotionally
dominated and all but swept the
three-game series from Arizona
State.
"We're swinging the bats much
better," Marquess said. "I was
really pleased to see the way we
battled in this series."
Sun Devil left-hander Todd
Douma (6-1) no-hit the Cardinal
through the first seven innings of
the second game, throwing a com

bination of tailing fastballs, off
speed pitches and screwballs.
Pinch-hitter John Lynch broke a
string of 18 consecutive outs in
the eighth inning by being hit by
a pitch, before Hammonds broke
up Douma's no-hitter with a
single. Then Troy Paulsen blasted
a changeup from Douma off the
scoreboard in left for a three-run
home run, his first four-bagger
of the year, to cut ASU's lead to
5-4.
"Douma kept us off balance, but
we have to be happy with the way
things ended," said Paulsen. "We
know we can hit, but so far we
have been a little inconsistent.
Now we just have some un
finished business."

the top of the ninth to take a 7-4
lead, Paul Carey led off the bot
tom half for Stanford with a walk.
Tim Griffin and Roger Burnett
singled to cut the lead to 7-5,
chasing reliever Kip Yaughn. Left
fielder Ryan Turner then popped
a bunt to the first baseman and
Steve Solomon flew out to center
field.
Marquess pinch-hit Skeels — a
.167 hitter — for catcher Todd
French, and he responded by roll
ing a single into left, scoring Grif
fin and cutting the score to 7-6.
Then Hammonds — who tallied
five hits, four runs, two stolen
bases and a run driven in for the
day while extending his hitting
streak to 16 games — copied
Skeels' hit, dribbling an 0-1 slider
into left, tying the score.
Second baseman Troy Paulsen's
flare into right-center field was
caught by a diving Mike Kelly to
end the ninth-inning rally. The
umpires then decided to end the
seven-hour marathon.

Junior Mike Mussina's spot in
the rotation is in no danger, as
he proved in the first game by
hurling his third straight com
plete game, striking out 12 and
securing his fourth win of the
season.
Griffin added his team-leading
eighth home run and doubled
twice as Stanford raced to a 14-5
lead and coasted to the win.
"They're a very good club," said
Brock.

umpires then decided to end the
seven-hour marathon.

Junior Mike Mussina's spot in
the rotation is in no danger, as
he proved in the first game by
hurling his third straight com
plete game, striking out 12 and
securing his fourth win of the
season.
Griffin added his team-leading
eighth home run and doubled
twice as Stanford raced to a 14-5
lead and coasted to the win.
"They're a very good club," said
Brock.

Earlier this year, Arizona
State's 18 inning, 6-5 victory over
UCLA on Feb. 23 was dubbed
"the longest game" by the Sun
Devils. However, yesterday's epic
doubleheader at Sunken Diamond
relegated the five hour and 36
minute battle at Packard Stadium
to mere warm-up status.

Cardinal 7, Sun Devils 7

Stanford unleashed the heavy
artillery in game one, scoring 12
runs in the first five innings en
route to a 14-8 victory. In the
nightcap, the Cardinal rallied for
six runs in the final two innings
to steal victory away from the
Sun Devils.

However, after rain had washed
away two games on the weekend,
the second game yesterday was
postponed again because of dark
ness. Stanford forced postpone

ment with three runs in the ninth,
locking the game at 7-7. Piay is
scheduled to resume on Monday,
April 9 at Sunken Diamond, with
the Sun Devils batting in the top
of the 10th inning.
After dropping two of three to
Southern California last weekend,
Stanford, ranked third in the na
tion, improves to 17-5, 5-3 in the
Pacific 10 Conference's Southern
Division. Arizona State, fifth
ranked in the Baseball America
preseason poll and 10th currently,
falls to 16-9, 2-5 in the Six-Pac.
Play began yesterday at Sunken
Diamond at 11 a.m., and seven
hours later it was Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess who was beaming
about his club's performance as
the Cardinal emotionally
dominated and all but swept the
three-game series from Arizona
State.
"We're swinging the bats much
better," Marquess said. "I was
really pleased to see the way we
battled in this series."
Sun Devil left-hander Todd
Douma (6-1) no-hit the Cardinal
through the first seven innings of
the second game, throwing a com

bination of tailing fastballs, off
speed pitches and screwballs.
Pinch-hitter John Lynch broke a
string of 18 consecutive outs in
the eighth inning by being hit by
a pitch, before Hammonds broke
up Douma's no-hitter with a
single. Then Troy Paulsen blasted
a changeup from Douma off the
scoreboard in left for a three-run
home run, his first four-bagger
of the year, to cut ASU's lead to
5-4.
"Douma kept us off balance, but
we have to be happy with the way
things ended," said Paulsen. "We
know we can hit, but so far we
have been a little inconsistent.
Now we just have some un
finished business."

the top of the ninth to take a 7-4
lead, Paul Carey led off the bot
tom half for Stanford with a walk.
Tim Griffin and Roger Burnett
singled to cut the lead to 7-5,
chasing reliever Kip Yaughn. Left
fielder Ryan Turner then popped
a bunt to the first baseman and
Steve Solomon flew out to center
field.
Marquess pinch-hit Skeels — a
.167 hitter — for catcher Todd
French, and he responded by roll
ing a single into left, scoring Grif
fin and cutting the score to 7-6.
Then Hammonds — who tallied
five hits, four runs, two stolen
bases and a run driven in for the
day while extending his hitting
streak to 16 games — copied
Skeels' hit, dribbling an 0-1 slider
into left, tying the score.
Second baseman Troy Paulsen's
flare into right-center field was
caught by a diving Mike Kelly to
end the ninth-inning rally. The
umpires then decided to end the
seven-hour marathon.

Earlier this year, Arizona
State's 18 inning, 6-5 victory over
UCLA on Feb. 23 was dubbed
"the longest game" by the Sun
Devils. However, yesterday's epic
doubleheader at Sunken Diamond
relegated the five hour and 36
minute battle at Packard Stadium
to mere warm-up status.

Stanford unleashed the heavy
artillery in game one, scoring 12
runs in the first five innings en
route to a 14-8 victory. In the
nightcap, the Cardinal rallied for
six runs in the final two innings
to steal victory away from the
Sun Devils.

However, after rain had washed
away two games on the weekend,
the second game yesterday was
postponed again because of dark
ness. Stanford forced postpone

ment with three runs in the ninth,
locking the game at 7-7. Piay is
scheduled to resume on Monday,
April 9 at Sunken Diamond, with
the Sun Devils batting in the top
of the 10th inning.
After dropping two of three to
Southern California last weekend,
Stanford, ranked third in the na
tion, improves to 17-5, 5-3 in the
Pacific 10 Conference's Southern
Division. Arizona State, fifth
ranked in the Baseball America
preseason poll and 10th currently,
falls to 16-9, 2-5 in the Six-Pac.
Play began yesterday at Sunken
Diamond at 11 a.m., and seven
hours later it was Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess who was beaming
about his club's performance as
the Cardinal emotionally
dominated and all but swept the
three-game series from Arizona
State.
"We're swinging the bats much
better," Marquess said. "I was
really pleased to see the way we
battled in this series."
Sun Devil left-hander Todd
Douma (6-1) no-hit the Cardinal
through the first seven innings of
the second game, throwing a com

bination of tailing fastballs, off
speed pitches and screwballs.
Pinch-hitter John Lynch broke a
string of 18 consecutive outs in
the eighth inning by being hit by
a pitch, before Hammonds broke
up Douma's no-hitter with a
single. Then Troy Paulsen blasted
a changeup from Douma off the
scoreboard in left for a three-run
home run, his first four-bagger
of the year, to cut ASU's lead to
5-4.
"Douma kept us off balance, but
we have to be happy with the way
things ended," said Paulsen. "We
know we can hit, but so far we
have been a little inconsistent.
Now we just have some un
finished business."

the top of the ninth to take a 7-4
lead, Paul Carey led off the bot
tom half for Stanford with a walk.
Tim Griffin and Roger Burnett
singled to cut the lead to 7-5,
chasing reliever Kip Yaughn. Left
fielder Ryan Turner then popped
a bunt to the first baseman and
Steve Solomon flew out to center
field.
Marquess pinch-hit Skeels — a
.167 hitter — for catcher Todd
French, and he responded by roll
ing a single into left, scoring Grif
fin and cutting the score to 7-6.
Then Hammonds — who tallied
five hits, four runs, two stolen
bases and a run driven in for the
day while extending his hitting
streak to 16 games — copied
Skeels' hit, dribbling an 0-1 slider
into left, tying the score.
Second baseman Troy Paulsen's
flare into right-center field was
caught by a diving Mike Kelly to
end the ninth-inning rally. The
umpires then decided to end the
seven-hour marathon.

Junior Mike Mussina's spot in
the rotation is in no danger, as
he proved in the first game by
hurling his third straight com
plete game, striking out 12 and
securing his fourth win of the
season.
Griffin added his team-leading
eighth home run and doubled
twice as Stanford raced to a 14-5
lead and coasted to the win.
"They're a very good club," said
Brock.
