# COP slapped on wrist again for pamphlets
## 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
Less than a week after ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Steve Krauss
ruled that the People's Platform Coun
cil of Presidents violated election rules,
he has once again slapped their hands
for another violation.
On Feb. 26, Krauss ruled that the
current People's Platform COP's ASSU
Resource Guide is campaign literature
and that distribution of the guide to
many students violated election rules.
On Friday, only a few days after the
ruling, more resource guides were dis
tributed in Cardenal House by an
ASSU dorm representative.
Krauss issued a statement yesterday
saying that the People's Platform
should be held responsible for distri
bution of the guide after Krauss ruled
that it was campaign literature.
In response, Michael Canul of the
Students First COP slate submitted a
letter to Krauss on Sunday asking for
the disqualification of the People's
Platform COP slate on the grounds
that the party violated ASSU bylaws
and wrongfully distributed informa
tion.
Canul called the resource guide "a
blatant piece of propaganda." More-

over, Canul noted that
the distribution in
Cardenal clearly vio
lated Krauss' ruling
on the distribution of
the guides.
Krauss put the
blame for the violation
on the shoulders of
the People's Platform
COP. But in his state-

ment, Krauss called Canul's request
for a disqualification of the People's
Platform slate "clearly ridiculous."
"It is clearly probable that this in
fraction was an honest mistake caused
by a miscommunication," said Krauss.
However, he went on to note, "it is
also true that the COP did not hold
up its responsibility of informing dorm
reps not to distribute ASSU Resource
Guides."
Senior David Brown, one of the cur
rent People's Platform COP members,
said his slate accepts responsibility for
the mix-up. He said the slate will en
sure that no more resource guides get
distributed until the references to the
People's Platform are marked over.
The COP attempted to halt distri
bution of the resource guides by dis-


Canul
cussing the matter with dorm rep
resentatives at a meeting last
week. However, the Cardenal
dorm representative, who is not
a People's Platform member,
missed the meeting and did not
read The Daily's article about the
ruling. She said she distributed
the restricted resource handbook
on Friday or Saturday.
If the People's Platform is pun
ished for the violation, the exact
form of punishment is still up in
the air. Before the People's Plat
form can be penalized, a formal
investigation must be initiated.
This investigation cannot be
undertaken until after the elec
tions, according to the ASSU
Bylaws. Moreover, the ASSU
Hearing Committee is responsible
for undertaking the investigation
and levying any penalties — but
the committee has not existed for

two years.
Canul disagreed with Krauss'
decision, saying that an investi
gation should begin immediately,
"in lieu of recent events."
The bylaws do not discuss the
punishment of political parties,
and according to Krauss, "the
only penalties which the bylaws
discuss that make any sense in
this case are censure or repri
mand."
Krauss will confer with the
ASSU hearing officer today and
will suggest that a formal inves
tigation be initiated on April 20,
after the elections. Krauss further
suggested that the People's Plat
form "be censured for their failure
to communicate."
Canul said he still wants
stronger action from Krauss. "We
continue to press for disqualifica
tion of the Platform's 1990 slate
on the grounds that responsibility
lies within the Platform's COP,
ASSU Bylaws have been violated
and the commissioner's recent
ruling has been violated," Canul

wrote in his reply to Krauss'
statement.
"Although I definitely think
someone is at fault here, I think
it is important to note that the
candidates on the People's Plat
form COP slate are not in any
way implicated by this event," said
Goodwin Liu, a member of the
slate.
"Although the whole incident
was an honest accident, I think
that a censure is a fair punish
ment," said Liu. However, Liu ex
pressed concern that the entire
issue was being blown out of pro
portion. "The focus of the elec
tions should not be on petty issues
like this, and I think the only
thing that this issue is doing is
to skirt the more important issues
that we should be discussing," he
said.
It is the policy of the elections
commissioner that "political par
ties should not advertise at this
stage of the elections process."
Campaigning is restricted to the
week before the elections.

after the elections. Krauss further
suggested that the People's Plat
form "be censured for their failure
to communicate."
Canul said he still wants
stronger action from Krauss. "We
continue to press for disqualifica
tion of the Platform's 1990 slate
on the grounds that responsibility
lies within the Platform's COP,
ASSU Bylaws have been violated
and the commissioner's recent
ruling has been violated," Canul

wrote in his reply to Krauss'
statement.
"Although I definitely think
someone is at fault here, I think
it is important to note that the
candidates on the People's Plat
form COP slate are not in any
way implicated by this event," said
Goodwin Liu, a member of the
slate.
"Although the whole incident
was an honest accident, I think
that a censure is a fair punish
ment," said Liu. However, Liu ex
pressed concern that the entire
issue was being blown out of pro
portion. "The focus of the elec
tions should not be on petty issues
like this, and I think the only
thing that this issue is doing is
to skirt the more important issues
that we should be discussing," he
said.
It is the policy of the elections
commissioner that "political par
ties should not advertise at this
stage of the elections process."
Campaigning is restricted to the
week before the elections.
Less than a week after ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Steve Krauss
ruled that the People's Platform Coun
cil of Presidents violated election rules,
he has once again slapped their hands
for another violation.
On Feb. 26, Krauss ruled that the
current People's Platform COP's ASSU
Resource Guide is campaign literature
and that distribution of the guide to
many students violated election rules.
On Friday, only a few days after the
ruling, more resource guides were dis
tributed in Cardenal House by an
ASSU dorm representative.
Krauss issued a statement yesterday
saying that the People's Platform
should be held responsible for distri
bution of the guide after Krauss ruled
that it was campaign literature.
In response, Michael Canul of the
Students First COP slate submitted a
letter to Krauss on Sunday asking for
the disqualification of the People's
Platform COP slate on the grounds
that the party violated ASSU bylaws
and wrongfully distributed informa
tion.
Canul called the resource guide "a
blatant piece of propaganda." More-

over, Canul noted that
the distribution in
Cardenal clearly vio
lated Krauss' ruling
on the distribution of
the guides.
Krauss put the
blame for the violation
on the shoulders of
the People's Platform
COP. But in his state-

ment, Krauss called Canul's request
for a disqualification of the People's
Platform slate "clearly ridiculous."
"It is clearly probable that this in
fraction was an honest mistake caused
by a miscommunication," said Krauss.
However, he went on to note, "it is
also true that the COP did not hold
up its responsibility of informing dorm
reps not to distribute ASSU Resource
Guides."
Senior David Brown, one of the cur
rent People's Platform COP members,
said his slate accepts responsibility for
the mix-up. He said the slate will en
sure that no more resource guides get
distributed until the references to the
People's Platform are marked over.
The COP attempted to halt distri
bution of the resource guides by dis-


Canul
cussing the matter with dorm rep
resentatives at a meeting last
week. However, the Cardenal
dorm representative, who is not
a People's Platform member,
missed the meeting and did not
read The Daily's article about the
ruling. She said she distributed
the restricted resource handbook
on Friday or Saturday.
If the People's Platform is pun
ished for the violation, the exact
form of punishment is still up in
the air. Before the People's Plat
form can be penalized, a formal
investigation must be initiated.
This investigation cannot be
undertaken until after the elec
tions, according to the ASSU
Bylaws. Moreover, the ASSU
Hearing Committee is responsible
for undertaking the investigation
and levying any penalties — but
the committee has not existed for

two years.
Canul disagreed with Krauss'
decision, saying that an investi
gation should begin immediately,
"in lieu of recent events."
The bylaws do not discuss the
punishment of political parties,
and according to Krauss, "the
only penalties which the bylaws
discuss that make any sense in
this case are censure or repri
mand."
Krauss will confer with the
ASSU hearing officer today and
will suggest that a formal inves
tigation be initiated on April 20,
after the elections. Krauss further
suggested that the People's Plat
form "be censured for their failure
to communicate."
Canul said he still wants
stronger action from Krauss. "We
