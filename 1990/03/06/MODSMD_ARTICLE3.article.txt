# COP slapped on wrist again for pamphlets

### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
Less than a week after ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Steve Krauss
ruled that the People's Platform Coun
cil of Presidents violated election rules,
he has once again slapped their hands
for another violation.
On Feb. 26, Krauss ruled that the
current People's Platform COP's ASSU
Resource Guide is campaign literature
and that distribution of the guide to
many students violated election rules.
On Friday, only a few days after the
ruling, more resource guides were dis
tributed in Cardenal House by an
ASSU dorm representative.
Krauss issued a statement yesterday
saying that the People's Platform
should be held responsible for distri
bution of the guide after Krauss ruled
that it was campaign literature.
In response, Michael Canul of the
Students First COP slate submitted a
letter to Krauss on Sunday asking for
the disqualification of the People's
Platform COP slate on the grounds
that the party violated ASSU bylaws
and wrongfully distributed informa
tion.
Canul called the resource guide "a
blatant piece of propaganda." More-

over, Canul noted that
the distribution in
Cardenal clearly vio
lated Krauss' ruling
on the distribution of
the guides.
Krauss put the
blame for the violation
on the shoulders of
the People's Platform
COP. But in his state-

ment, Krauss called Canul's request
for a disqualification of the People's
Platform slate "clearly ridiculous."
"It is clearly probable that this in
fraction was an honest mistake caused
by a miscommunication," said Krauss.
However, he went on to note, "it is
also true that the COP did not hold
up its responsibility of informing dorm
reps not to distribute ASSU Resource
Guides."
Senior David Brown, one of the cur
rent People's Platform COP members,
said his slate accepts responsibility for
the mix-up. He said the slate will en
sure that no more resource guides get
distributed until the references to the
People's Platform are marked over.
The COP attempted to halt distri
bution of the resource guides by dis-
