# It's time for those hotly contested all-Pac-10 hoops picks
## 
### 
Hey everybody, guess what time it
is. Yep, that's right, it's time to
pick the best men's basketball
players in the Pacific 10 Conference —
the greats, the almost greats and the
pretty darn goods.
The Pac-10 has definitely had its share
of ups (Arizona's season-opening thump
ing of defending national champion Mich
igan) and downs (the cover of The Na
tional read "Lose, Lose, Lose, Lose,
Lose!" after UCLA lost five straight).
Through it all, however, some players,
and coaches, have maintained a consis
tently high level of achievement. Here,
then, are my selections for Pac-10 honors
after having watched 14 league games
live and seven more on television.
Player of the Year: Guess.
OK, time's up; pencils down. If you
said Gary Payton, you're right. The
senior is the best point guard in the
nation, no questions asked. No other
player in the league can match his scoring
ability, or his passing ability, or his cocki
ness.
Well, maybe some UCLA players are
as cocky as he is. But he's so good he
can afford to be cocky.
All-Pac-10, first team: The league
will announce a 10-player team
Thursday, but that's a hokey way
to do it. The real way should be to have
a five-man first team and a five-man

second team.
My first team is comprised of guards
Payton and Keith Smith of California,
center Adam Keefe of Stanford and for
wards Don Mac Lean of UCLA and Jud
Buechler of Arizona.
Payton is an obvious choice and needs
no supporting argument. In favor of
Smith, I say only one thing: the Golden
Bears are going to the NCAA tourney
for the first time since 1960 and Smith
is the biggest reason.
Keefe has scored 19 points and pulled
down nine rebounds a game this year
despite the fact that every team that he
plays knows he is the go-to guy. Mac Lean
may well be the most disliked player in
the Pac-10, but he's good. He is averaging
over 10 rebounds a game in league con
tests and is second in scoring.
Buechler, meanwhile, is the type of guy
you either love (if he's on your favorite
team) or hate (if he's not). He has the
lovable/detestable ability to acquire every
loose ball, and he scores, gets rebounds,
gets assists, plays good defense, etc. He
is the type of guy that doesn't seem to
do much but makes his team a lot better.
All-Pac-10, second team: Since Cal has
found a great deal of success with a three
guard lineup this season, the second team
will have the same look. The lucky selec
tees are guards Matt Muehlebach of Ar
izona, Harold Miner of USC and Terrell
Brandon of Oregon, and forwards Trevor

Wilson of UCLA and Alex Austin of Ar
izona State.
Muehlebach has been on fire of late,
hitting three-pointers while seemingly
never missing and scoring 20 or 22 a
game over the past three weeks. He also
has a fine 2.8 to 1 assists-to-turnover
ratio. Miner is an obvious choice for
anyone who was in the Sports Arena the
night USC beat the Cardinal. When he's
on, anything inside of 24 feet is a good
shot. Brandon, like Miner, has adapted
well to his first year in the Pac-10. He
can beat you with the drive or with a
pass and will serve as a fine building
block for Oregon in the future.
Wilson, the league's best scowler, is
only seven boards behind Keefe in the
race for the rebounding title and, despite
an utter inability to make a free throw,
is still seventh in the league in scoring.
Austin, meanwhile, has been a one-man
wrecking crew for the Sun Devils, scoring
from all points on the court.
All-Pac-10, honorable mention: What
the heck — I'll go 15 deep: Guards Dar
rick Martin of UCLA and Mike Redhair
of ASU, center Sean Rooks of Arizona
and forwards Brian Hendrick of Cal and
Ronnie Coleman of USC.
Newcomer of the Year: Miner, the
Trojans's super frosh and the man
who will keep Coach George
Raveling around for another year.

All-Newcomer team: The guards are
Miner and Brandon.
In the front court my winners are
Hendrick, Brian Williams of Arizona and
Isaac Austin of ASU. Williams reported
injured and out of shape after redshirting
following transferring from Maryland.
But he has incredible talent and will prob
ably turn out to be quite a player. Austin
has made an impact as the Sun Devils'
starting center and second-leading scorer
and rebounder behind his brother, Alex.
The last category, that of Coach of the
Year, is a little more difficult. The reasons
for picking someone are so varied and
could include things like recruiting, im
proving players, game-situation decisions
and so on.
Keeping all these things in mind, I
have to vote for Oregon State's
Jim Anderson. In his first year of
head coaching after spending 24 years as
Ralph Miller's assistant, he took a Beaver

team with Payton and marginal talent
and led them to the regular-season con
ference title. The big question is if he
can keep it up after Gary graduates.
Several other coaches deserve com
mendations, however. From North to
South, they are Don Monson of Oregon,
Mike Montgomery of Stanford, Bill
Frieder of ASU and Lute Olson of Ari
zona.
On the other side of the coin, Wash
ington's Lynn Nance wins the booby
prize, with UCLA's Jim Harrick coming
in a close second. Nance took a fairly
talented team, stifled their quickness and
athletic ability, forced them to play a
half-court game and put them in ninth
place. Harrick took an incredibly talented
bunch and, by implementing a five-way,
one-on-one offensive scheme, allowed the
whole to be much less than the sum of
its parts.
For those of you keeping track at home,
the league will announce their selections
at a luncheon in Tempe Thursday in
conjunction with the Pac-10 tourney. Feel
free to make your own selections and see
if you do better than 1 do.
But if you do, I don't want to hear
about it.

head coaching after spending 24 years as
Ralph Miller's assistant, he took a Beaver

team with Payton and marginal talent
and led them to the regular-season con
ference title. The big question is if he
can keep it up after Gary graduates.
Several other coaches deserve com
mendations, however. From North to
South, they are Don Monson of Oregon,
Mike Montgomery of Stanford, Bill
Frieder of ASU and Lute Olson of Ari
zona.
On the other side of the coin, Wash
ington's Lynn Nance wins the booby
prize, with UCLA's Jim Harrick coming
in a close second. Nance took a fairly
talented team, stifled their quickness and
athletic ability, forced them to play a
half-court game and put them in ninth
place. Harrick took an incredibly talented
bunch and, by implementing a five-way,
one-on-one offensive scheme, allowed the
whole to be much less than the sum of
its parts.
For those of you keeping track at home,
the league will announce their selections
at a luncheon in Tempe Thursday in
conjunction with the Pac-10 tourney. Feel
free to make your own selections and see
if you do better than 1 do.
But if you do, I don't want to hear
about it.

Hey everybody, guess what time it
is. Yep, that's right, it's time to
pick the best men's basketball
players in the Pacific 10 Conference —
the greats, the almost greats and the
pretty darn goods.
The Pac-10 has definitely had its share
of ups (Arizona's season-opening thump
ing of defending national champion Mich
igan) and downs (the cover of The Na
tional read "Lose, Lose, Lose, Lose,
Lose!" after UCLA lost five straight).
Through it all, however, some players,
and coaches, have maintained a consis
tently high level of achievement. Here,
then, are my selections for Pac-10 honors
after having watched 14 league games
live and seven more on television.
Player of the Year: Guess.
OK, time's up; pencils down. If you
said Gary Payton, you're right. The
senior is the best point guard in the
nation, no questions asked. No other
player in the league can match his scoring
ability, or his passing ability, or his cocki
ness.
Well, maybe some UCLA players are
as cocky as he is. But he's so good he
can afford to be cocky.
All-Pac-10, first team: The league
will announce a 10-player team
Thursday, but that's a hokey way
to do it. The real way should be to have
a five-man first team and a five-man

second team.
My first team is comprised of guards
Payton and Keith Smith of California,
center Adam Keefe of Stanford and for
wards Don Mac Lean of UCLA and Jud
Buechler of Arizona.
Payton is an obvious choice and needs
no supporting argument. In favor of
Smith, I say only one thing: the Golden
Bears are going to the NCAA tourney
for the first time since 1960 and Smith
is the biggest reason.
Keefe has scored 19 points and pulled
down nine rebounds a game this year
despite the fact that every team that he
plays knows he is the go-to guy. Mac Lean
may well be the most disliked player in
the Pac-10, but he's good. He is averaging
over 10 rebounds a game in league con
tests and is second in scoring.
Buechler, meanwhile, is the type of guy
you either love (if he's on your favorite
team) or hate (if he's not). He has the
lovable/detestable ability to acquire every
loose ball, and he scores, gets rebounds,
gets assists, plays good defense, etc. He
is the type of guy that doesn't seem to
do much but makes his team a lot better.
All-Pac-10, second team: Since Cal has
found a great deal of success with a three
guard lineup this season, the second team
will have the same look. The lucky selec
tees are guards Matt Muehlebach of Ar
izona, Harold Miner of USC and Terrell
Brandon of Oregon, and forwards Trevor

Wilson of UCLA and Alex Austin of Ar
izona State.
Muehlebach has been on fire of late,
hitting three-pointers while seemingly
never missing and scoring 20 or 22 a
game over the past three weeks. He also
has a fine 2.8 to 1 assists-to-turnover
ratio. Miner is an obvious choice for
anyone who was in the Sports Arena the
night USC beat the Cardinal. When he's
on, anything inside of 24 feet is a good
shot. Brandon, like Miner, has adapted
well to his first year in the Pac-10. He
can beat you with the drive or with a
pass and will serve as a fine building
block for Oregon in the future.
Wilson, the league's best scowler, is
only seven boards behind Keefe in the
race for the rebounding title and, despite
an utter inability to make a free throw,
is still seventh in the league in scoring.
Austin, meanwhile, has been a one-man
wrecking crew for the Sun Devils, scoring
from all points on the court.
All-Pac-10, honorable mention: What
the heck — I'll go 15 deep: Guards Dar
rick Martin of UCLA and Mike Redhair
of ASU, center Sean Rooks of Arizona
and forwards Brian Hendrick of Cal and
Ronnie Coleman of USC.
Newcomer of the Year: Miner, the
Trojans's super frosh and the man
who will keep Coach George
Raveling around for another year.

All-Newcomer team: The guards are
Miner and Brandon.
In the front court my winners are
Hendrick, Brian Williams of Arizona and
Isaac Austin of ASU. Williams reported
injured and out of shape after redshirting
following transferring from Maryland.
But he has incredible talent and will prob
ably turn out to be quite a player. Austin
has made an impact as the Sun Devils'
starting center and second-leading scorer
and rebounder behind his brother, Alex.
The last category, that of Coach of the
Year, is a little more difficult. The reasons
for picking someone are so varied and
could include things like recruiting, im
proving players, game-situation decisions
and so on.
Keeping all these things in mind, I
have to vote for Oregon State's
Jim Anderson. In his first year of
head coaching after spending 24 years as
Ralph Miller's assistant, he took a Beaver

team with Payton and marginal talent
and led them to the regular-season con
ference title. The big question is if he
