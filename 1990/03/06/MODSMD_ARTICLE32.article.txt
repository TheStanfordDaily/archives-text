# Frosh Dukes and Hicks get quality time for young Cardinal
## 
### Michaela Sanchez 
When observers looked at Stanford's
men's basketball team this season, most
saw 1990 as a year of rebuilding. No
one expected the Cardinal to sweep a
program like UCLA or to do as well in
the Pacific 10 Conference as it has sim
ply due to the youth of the squad.
Surprisingly, it has been the consis
tent play of freshmen off the bench dur
ing pressure situations that has given
Stanford a shot at postseason play going
into the Pac-10 tournament this Friday.
Two young guards that have both had
considerable amounts of playing time
are redshirt Peter Dukes and true fresh
man Kenny Hicks.
Although both players are listed on
the roster as freshmen, Dukes was able
to do everything but play last year as
a redshirt. Hicks, on the other hand,
came into a depleted Cardinal backcourt
this year and has been able to contribute
from the start.
For Dukes, the opportunity to red
shirt has been invaluable. "I now know
the rigors of a Division I basketball
season and what it takes to do well in
practice," said Dukes.
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery
also feels that Dukes has contributed
in his own right and mentions the UCI.A
game at Pauley Pavilion as an example.
"He knows what needs to be done and
where the ball should be," Montgomery
said. "His work in the weightroom has
helped increase his strength."
Dukes' experience as a redshirt helped
make the difficult transition from high
school to college basketball much easier.
"Practicing with the team but not com
peting in games for a year helped me
adjust academically and .socially to col
lege life."
While getting used to the academic
stress of Stanford, Dukes was also able
to experience the pressures and com
mitments that go along with making
numerous roadtrips throughout the
season. "Last year I went on the trip
during Christmas break and to the Pac
-10 Championship and the NCAA Tour
nament. I was able to get a feel for
living out of a hotel room."
Since Hicks began playing immedi
ately as a freshman, the transition from
high school to college athletics and ac
ademics has at times been difficult, but
it definitely hasn't been all bad.

Its hard to balance academics when you're taking 15
units and gone from Wednesday to Sunday, five
weeks out of the quarter. It can be very hard studying
on the road — the hotel is definitely not the same as
the library.'

"It goes up and down," Hicks said
"Sometimes it is easy as cake, other
times really tough. In high school you
could loaf around and guard the guy
who wasn't very good, but here every
one is good.
"It's hard to balance academics when
you're taking 15 units and gone from
Wednesday to Sunday, five weeks out
of the quarter. [It] can be very hard
studying on the road — the hotel is
definitely not the same as the library,"
Hicks added.
Montgomery noted the factors that
determine whether a recruit will play
in his first year. "The decision to red
shirt has to do with the ability of the
player to contribute as a freshman," he
said. "Last year we had three returning
guards (Todd Lichti, Terry Taylor and
Scott Meinert) who played the position
for us," said Montgomery.
Because of this guard situation,
Pukes would not have received a sub
stantial amount of playing time last
season. But after the loss of the three
seniors, the situation was much differ
ent. "With last year's three guards gone
and Ammann's back causing problems,
all of our guards have to be ready to
play," added Montgomery, referring to
freshmen backups Dukes, Hicks and
Marcus Lollie.
Despite these differences, both Dukes
and Hicks had no trouble choosing to
come to the Farm. After helping lead
his high school team to a second-place
finish in the Washington state tourna
ment in 1987, Dukes was recruited by
Stanford, Cornell, Washington and Gon
zaga. Stanford, however, was the clear
winner.
"During my recruiting trip, I really
liked the atmosphere," he says. "If they
offered me a scholarship, I knew I would
come."
Now, Dukes couldn't be more
satisfied with his choice. "I am really
happy to be here playing Pac-10 basket-

ball. The coaching staff has done an
excellent job with us this year."
Coming out of high school, Hicks
definitely knew he was interested in
playing basketball and his top prospects
were Stanford and Santa Clara. "At
Stanford, you can't beat the academics
and it has a good basketball program,
there really is no better ticket."
Hicks, who hails from Sherman Oaks,
Calif., has already seen some excellent
playing time this season, including a
13-point performance against Washing
ton State.
Before the season, a main concern
was simply how quickly Hicks could
make the adjustment to college basket
ball. Apparently, he has had little trou
ble so far. "He's a quick defender who
knows the fundamentals and where to
be on the court," Montgomery said.
For Dukes, his season has been an
arduous but rewarding experience. "I
am fortunate to be playing a lot as a
freshman," he said. "The season started
out well but I was set back by broken
ribs, heart trouble and an injured elbow.
In spite of this, I feel I have added to
the success of the season by playing
during crunch time and getting the ball
to our guys."
Montgomery goes on to say that "both
Dukes and Hicks have nice personalities
and play smart according to what is
happening on the court. They both have
the opportunity to help the program."
By getting valuable playing time on
the court as freshmen, both Dukes and
Hicks are well on the way to achieving
their personal goals of becoming
starters and mtyor contributors on the
team. Both also look to the future at
the strong possibility of participating in
an NCAA Tournament.
And for now, the Cardinal can even
do a little playoff damage this season,
should the NIT come calling. If so, count
on Dukes and Hicks being there to help
shoulder the load.

the roster as freshmen, Dukes was able
to do everything but play last year as
a redshirt. Hicks, on the other hand,
came into a depleted Cardinal backcourt
this year and has been able to contribute
from the start.
For Dukes, the opportunity to red
shirt has been invaluable. "I now know
the rigors of a Division I basketball
season and what it takes to do well in
practice," said Dukes.
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery
also feels that Dukes has contributed
in his own right and mentions the UCI.A
game at Pauley Pavilion as an example.
"He knows what needs to be done and
where the ball should be," Montgomery
said. "His work in the weightroom has
helped increase his strength."
Dukes' experience as a redshirt helped
make the difficult transition from high
school to college basketball much easier.
"Practicing with the team but not com
peting in games for a year helped me
adjust academically and .socially to col
lege life."
While getting used to the academic
stress of Stanford, Dukes was also able
to experience the pressures and com
mitments that go along with making
numerous roadtrips throughout the
season. "Last year I went on the trip
during Christmas break and to the Pac
-10 Championship and the NCAA Tour
nament. I was able to get a feel for
living out of a hotel room."
Since Hicks began playing immedi
ately as a freshman, the transition from
high school to college athletics and ac
ademics has at times been difficult, but
it definitely hasn't been all bad.

Its hard to balance academics when you're taking 15
units and gone from Wednesday to Sunday, five
weeks out of the quarter. It can be very hard studying
on the road — the hotel is definitely not the same as
the library.'

"It goes up and down," Hicks said
"Sometimes it is easy as cake, other
times really tough. In high school you
could loaf around and guard the guy
who wasn't very good, but here every
one is good.
"It's hard to balance academics when
you're taking 15 units and gone from
Wednesday to Sunday, five weeks out
of the quarter. [It] can be very hard
studying on the road — the hotel is
definitely not the same as the library,"
Hicks added.
Montgomery noted the factors that
determine whether a recruit will play
in his first year. "The decision to red
shirt has to do with the ability of the
player to contribute as a freshman," he
said. "Last year we had three returning
guards (Todd Lichti, Terry Taylor and
Scott Meinert) who played the position
for us," said Montgomery.
Because of this guard situation,
Pukes would not have received a sub
stantial amount of playing time last
season. But after the loss of the three
seniors, the situation was much differ
ent. "With last year's three guards gone
and Ammann's back causing problems,
all of our guards have to be ready to
play," added Montgomery, referring to
freshmen backups Dukes, Hicks and
Marcus Lollie.
Despite these differences, both Dukes
and Hicks had no trouble choosing to
come to the Farm. After helping lead
his high school team to a second-place
finish in the Washington state tourna
ment in 1987, Dukes was recruited by
Stanford, Cornell, Washington and Gon
zaga. Stanford, however, was the clear
winner.
"During my recruiting trip, I really
liked the atmosphere," he says. "If they
offered me a scholarship, I knew I would
come."
Now, Dukes couldn't be more
satisfied with his choice. "I am really
happy to be here playing Pac-10 basket-

ball. The coaching staff has done an
excellent job with us this year."
Coming out of high school, Hicks
definitely knew he was interested in
playing basketball and his top prospects
were Stanford and Santa Clara. "At
Stanford, you can't beat the academics
and it has a good basketball program,
there really is no better ticket."
Hicks, who hails from Sherman Oaks,
Calif., has already seen some excellent
playing time this season, including a
13-point performance against Washing
ton State.
Before the season, a main concern
was simply how quickly Hicks could
make the adjustment to college basket
ball. Apparently, he has had little trou
ble so far. "He's a quick defender who
knows the fundamentals and where to
be on the court," Montgomery said.
For Dukes, his season has been an
arduous but rewarding experience. "I
am fortunate to be playing a lot as a
freshman," he said. "The season started
out well but I was set back by broken
ribs, heart trouble and an injured elbow.
In spite of this, I feel I have added to
the success of the season by playing
during crunch time and getting the ball
to our guys."
Montgomery goes on to say that "both
Dukes and Hicks have nice personalities
and play smart according to what is
happening on the court. They both have
the opportunity to help the program."
By getting valuable playing time on
the court as freshmen, both Dukes and
Hicks are well on the way to achieving
their personal goals of becoming
starters and mtyor contributors on the
team. Both also look to the future at
the strong possibility of participating in
an NCAA Tournament.
And for now, the Cardinal can even
do a little playoff damage this season,
should the NIT come calling. If so, count
on Dukes and Hicks being there to help
shoulder the load.

Peter Dukes has had to wait his turn, but after a redshlrt year last season he has
seen considerable action In the Cardinal backcourt.
When observers looked at Stanford's
men's basketball team this season, most
saw 1990 as a year of rebuilding. No
one expected the Cardinal to sweep a
program like UCLA or to do as well in
the Pacific 10 Conference as it has sim
ply due to the youth of the squad.
Surprisingly, it has been the consis
tent play of freshmen off the bench dur
ing pressure situations that has given
Stanford a shot at postseason play going
into the Pac-10 tournament this Friday.
Two young guards that have both had
considerable amounts of playing time
are redshirt Peter Dukes and true fresh
man Kenny Hicks.
