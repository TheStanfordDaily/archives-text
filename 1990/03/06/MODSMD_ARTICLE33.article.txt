# 'Bucko' gains on the comp
## 
### Ellen Posman 
To make the defending na
tional champion Stanford wom
en's swim team, one would
assume that an athlete would
have to be a national-calibre
swimmer since age six. While
some of the team members fit
this description, star sprinter
Suzy Buckovich is a dramatic
exception.
Buckovich is an integral part
of a Cardinal squad that in
cludes Olympic gold medal win
ners and NCAA champions,
despite the fact that she did not
even dream of swimming on a
top team until her junior year
of high school. Her late start
and difficulties that she encoun
tered in high school make her
accomplishments all the more
impressive.
During her first two years of
high school Buckovich was the
best swimmer on a losing team
in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania,
but by no means was she one
of the tops in the country. She
qualified for the state meets,
but not the nationals, and even
the state meets weren't exciting
because none of her teammates
were with her.
"I was the hero in my small
town but my times didn't even
touch the national level," she
says.
Buckovich's swimming for
tunes turned around in her
junior year. She transferred to
Germantown Academy because
both the swimming program
and the academics were better.
She entered at the bottom of
the swim team, but after her
first year, she took ten seconds
off of her 200-yard individual
medley, five seconds off of her
100-yard sprints and qualified
for the World Game trials and
the national meet.
Buckovich credits her im
provement to both the swim
mers at Germantown and the
coach. While the coach at her
former high school had doubled
as the gym teacher, the coach
at Germantown, Richard Shoul
berg, had been a Pan-Pacific
team coach and had trained
Olympians.
Because the other swimmers
were better than Buckovich,
they pushed her to do better.
"When you're in a program
where you're the only good one,
you go to the big meets alone,"
she says. "With a good team,
everyone goes, and you get to
swim relays. It's more fun to
swim on a relay because there's
three other people with you and
it's more of a team."
Success followed enthusiasm,
as her 400 free relay team set
a national prep school record.
At Stanford, all three of her
relay teams in last year's NCAAs
placed third.
The change had a direct in
fluence on Buckovich's ability to
come and swim for Stanford. "I
knew I wanted to go to a swim
ming college, but I always had
a lower-class swimming college
in mind," she says. "This was
just a dream. It wasn't until
junior and senior year that I
decided I wanted to come here
and could."

When it came time to choose
a college, Buckovich had a de
cision to make similar to the
one she made in high school.
She could go to UCLA, where
she would be the best swimmer,
or come to Stanford to be one
of many top swimmers. Buck
ovich wanted to be pushed by
the best swimmers in the coun
try, so she came to the Farm.
"When you have people you
try to catch, it's just going to
make you a better swimmer,"
she observes. "When you're not
the top, you're always striving
to be the top."
At Stanford, Buckovich has
swum with some of the world's
best swimmers, and she has im
proved by leaps and bounds.
Swimming with former
Cardinal and Olympic sprinter
Jenna Johnson helped Buck
ovich with her sprints, and
swimming with Janel Jorgensen
this year has helped with her
butterfly
The benefits go both ways.
"Swimming in the same lane as
Bucko makes for added fun —
she's very encouraging," Jorgen
sen says, "which is helpful in
getting through practice. And
having her there pushes me to
do better."
While many swimmers peak
early in their careers, Buckovich
has improved incredibly, pos
sibly because she was a late
bloomer. Buckovich has gone
from placing 10th in the 100
butterfly at the 1988 NCAAs to
finishing sixth in 1989. In the

100 freestyle, she placed 21st in
1988, 11th in 1989, and hopes
to improve again this year.
"I like to think it is not too
unusual to improve at Stan
ford," says Stanford Coach Rich
ard Quick, "but Suzy is
improving at an exceptional
rate."
Buckovich's explanation for
her substantial improvement is
that she started swimming later
than other people. "I think why
I keep improving is because my
junior year is when I started
going to nationals," she says.
"While a lot of people have been
swimming at the national level
since they were twelve, I started
when I was seventeen. I guess
I'm a late bloomer so I still have
time to improve."
Credit for Buckovich's im
provement must also go to the
structure of the Stanford pro
gram. "The Stanford program
is designed for her talents and
it's better for the program to
fit the individual than for the
individual to try to fit the pro
gram," says Quick.
In the 1990 NCAAs, Buck
ovich will swim the 100 butter
fly, the 200 IM and the 100
freestyle. Quick is especially
looking for her to be a contender
in the 100 butterfly. Currently,
teammate Janel Jorgensen has
the best time in the country in
the event. "My hope is that
Janel and Suzy go one and two
in the 100 fly," Quick says,"and
I think Suzy has a chance to
win it."

Junior Suzy Buckovich has always been a late bloomer when
it comes to swimming. The sprinter has steadily decreased her
times while at Stanford.
