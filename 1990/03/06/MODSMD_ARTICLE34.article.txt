### Dax Kurbegov Staff writer 
Two weeks ago, the Stanford
men's and women's fencing teams
stormed through southern Cali
fornia, going undefeated against
seven schools to win their Pacific
10 Conference title. This weekend,
they brought their victory tour
home to Maples Pavilion where
both teams defended Western Re
gional Championships, and the
women set a new record by win
ning their seventh straight cham
pionship.
UC-Santa Cruz had already
defeated Stanford in head-to-head
competition twice this year going
into Saturday's team competition.
However, the Cardinal men took
charge and Stan Brobston's win
over his Banana Slug opponent
clinched the 14-13 victory for
Stanford.
"They're always tough," said
epee fencer David Brody. "But
we've fenced them twice this year
and knew that we were capable
of beating them."
The women's team displayed
their best fencing of the year, ac
cording to coach Sherry Pos
thumus. This weekend, after
fencing four other schools, they
decisively beat Santa Cruz 12-4.
"The bout score shows that we
beat Santa Cruz badly," said fen
cer Olivia Judson. "But many of
the bouts were really tough and
close."
With the win, the men iced a
perfect day of fencing (5-0) and
captured the over-all Western Col
legiate Fencing Championship.

Along the way, the men's team
qualified Stanford teams for
NCAA Championships in the foil
and sabre divisions.
Men's coach Zoran Tulum said,
"Our entire team is so young. I
had no expectations of doing so
well this year. The epee squad
which consists of two sophomores
and a freshman will certainly be
a dominant force in the next three
years."
A member of the victorious
sabre team, senior Jim Farrell
said, "Qualifying so many people
for NCAAs is great for a team as
young as ours. The more they get
a taste of what being in the NCAA
finals really is, the more they're
going to want it."
The women's team also quali
fied for NCAA finals. Team mem
ber Elisabeth Spilman said, "We
have a stronger team now. We
will certainly do much better than
our last-place finish last year."
Sophomore Nick Bravin, a
member of the Senior National
Team of the United States, was
seeded first and expected to win
the individual foil title. He was
upset by Air Force fencer Tracey
Grenville and placed fifth.
In all, Stanford qualified three
of four teams and four individuals
for the NCAA tournament. Ac
cording to Tulum, this makes
Stanford one of the best
represented schools in the event.
