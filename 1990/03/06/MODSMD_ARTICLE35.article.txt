Yesterday, the Stanford men's
swimming team took care of the
first order of business at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships ift Long Beach.
Despite an opening day schedule
that did not include their
strongest events, the Cardinal
squad opened up a 254-202 lead
over second-place Southern Cali
fornia and qualified eight more
swimmers for NCAAs.
"At NCAAs (where the se
quence of events will be the same),
we will not be looking to be ahead
at the end of the first day," Asst.
Coach Ted Knapp said. "We'll be
looking to see how close we can
be. . . . To be in first place today
is real exciting."
The Cardinal opened up the
conference finals with its only win
of the evening and, in the process,

set a new Pac-10 record in the
200 free relay. The time of
1:19.17, marked up by seniors
Rick Gould and Doug Lillydahl
and freshmen J.J. Freitag and
Erik Maurer, broke the 1989
record of 1:19.27 of UCLA.
.USC's Dan Jorgensen finished
ahead of the Cardinal swimmers
in the next event, the 500 free,
with a time of 4:19.46. Seniors
Lunn Lestina and John Witchel
paddled into the next two spots
with times nearly five seconds
faster than the previous Cardinal
season best. Sophomores Alex
Kostich and Jason Plummer also
qualified with their swims.
In the 200 IM, Gary Anderson,
another Trojan, splashed ahead
of junior Matt Rodgers. Still,
Rodgers and sophomore Andy
Lloyd touched the wall with times
under the NCAA standard.
"Everybody swam faster at
night (after the morning prelim

inaries)," Knapp said. "One of the
keys for NCAAs will be to get
everyone into the night session;
the other will be swimming faster
at night."
In the 50 free, three swimmers
from the Southern California
schools touched ahead of the Car
dinal competitors. The next four
spots, however, were claimed by
Stanford swimmers, with Maurer,
Lillydahl and senior Jeff Garr
reaching the NCAA standard.
In the final event of the evening,
the Stanford 400 medley relay
team, which had reached the
NCAA time earlier in the season,
was disqualified.
Today, Stanford will attempt to
increase the number of its NCAA
competitors from 12 to the max
imum 17. Seven events will be
held, with the preliminaries start
ing at 11 a.m. and the finals at
6 p.m.
