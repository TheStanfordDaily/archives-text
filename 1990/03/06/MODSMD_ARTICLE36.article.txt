# Cardinal netters host Eagles

Returning home triumphantly
from the National Team Indoors,
Stanford women's tennis Coach
Frank Brennan said he felt this
year's team is better than last
year's was at this point.
Considering that the 1989
squad went undefeated — and
Brennan called it his "best ever"
— that's a mighty scary thought
indeed.
It makes one wonder why un
heralded Boston College is visiting
the Stanford Tennis Stadium
today when the Eagles must know
they are about to become just an
other notch on the Cardinal's
racket handle.
Brennan said Boston College is
"somebody a little different" from
the California schools Stanford
traditionally plays. He had little
to say about the match other than
that the Cardinal will hold out
three of its top six singles players.
On the subject of Sandra Birch

— one of the three who will not
be in action today — Brennan had
nothing but praise. "Sandra Birch
took a giant stride, a giant step
forward in her career," Brennan
said of her performance at In
doors.
He said Birch played somewhat
tentatively in her match with Wis
consin's Elaine Demetoulis and
nearly lost a shot. "The coaching
staff told her that was Reason
372 why she should be going to
the net more . . . being more ag
gressive," Brennan said.
Birch took the advice to heart
the next day when she played
Betsy Somerville of Arizona and
beat her 6-3, 6-4. "She was ag
gressive right from the outset in-

stead of easing her way in,"
Brennan said.
Saturday, Birch played Shan
nan McCarthy, one of the top
serve-and-volleyers in the nation.
Again she was aggressive and
again she was impressive, winning
6-3, 6-4. Jessica Emmons, who
beat Birch handily once last
season, was no match for her Sun
day in a 6-4, 6-1 decision.
Brennan did not say it, but it
is apparent Birch is reaching that
rarefied level Tami Whitlinger
and Patty Fendick — Stanford's
last two dominant No. 1 players
— were on as they led the Car
dinal to the past four NCAA
championships.
