# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Junior Stan Spencer is a top pitcher for
the Cardinal baseball team, while Lana Kang
is a freshman on the Stanford fencing team.
Yet these seemingly disparate athletes have
one vital thing in common: they are The
Daily's Athletes of the Week.
Actually, the two have another similar
characteristic — despite their excellent
skills, both have probably felt overlooked at
Stanford. Kang is on one of the less-visible
sports on the Farm, while Spencer has had
to pitch alongside much-heralded classmate
pitcher Mike Mussina.
Kang, a freshman from Little Falls, N.J.,
showed you don't have to be an upperclass

men to be the best in fencing. At the Western
Regional Championships at Maples last
weekend, Kang went undefeated and won
the women's foil individual championship.
In doing so, Kang also qualified for
NCAAs as an individual. In addition, the
women fencers won their seventh straight
Western Regional Championship and qual
ified for NCAAs.
Kang was the top recruit of the fencing
team last year, as she fenced extensively in
high school for one of the top clubs on the
East Coast. She will be one of four Cardinal
fencers to compete in the individual division
at NCAAs, which will be held at Notre Dame
March 2\ through 28.
Honorable mention this week has to go
to Teri Whitlingcr, who dropped a mere
eight games in four matches at the National
Team Indoors.

Spencer, a 6-foot-3 righthander from rainy
Vancouver, Wash., has always had to suffer
comparison with Mussina, the top prep
recruit of 1987. However, he came into his
own his freshman year when went 7-2 with
a 3.19 ERA and won the College World
Series title game against Arizona State. Now
he can add the thrill of being named an
AOTW to his scrapbook.
Against those self-same Sun Devils on
Saturday, Spencer battled and hung tough
to get the win in the Cardinal's Six-Pac
home opener, 3-2. Spencer went the whole
way, giving up a scant five hits and two
runs in running his record to a perfect 5-0
on the year.
Spencer also fanned nine Arizona State
would-be hitters, giving him 46 for the year
to lead the Stanford staff. The economics
major lowered his ERA to 2.63, as he has

surrendered only 14 earned runs on 35 hits
in 7 games.
Spencer is merely picking up where he
left off last season, when he won his final
three starts and gave up only four earned
runs. With the year he is having so far,
Spencer may he a high pick in the m«\jor
league draft this spring.
Honorable mention goes to Kenny Am
mann, who made eight of 12 three-pointers
and scored 30 points in the Cardinal's two
games versus Cal last week.
