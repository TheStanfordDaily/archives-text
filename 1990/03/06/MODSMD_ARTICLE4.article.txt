# 7 slates eye Senior Class presidency
## 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
The Senior Class presidential
election is off to an unusual start
this year.
A whopping seven slates have
submitted letters of intent to run,
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Steve Krauss announced yesterday.
"This number of slates is
definitely unprecedented in the
recent history of Stanford," said
Krauss. Last year only three slates
vied to be the Senior Class presi
dents. The year before that, two
slate* registered to run, but one
dropped out before the elections.
Although the letters of intent
were due Friday, the slates will not
be officially posted until next Mon
day. This week is being devoted to
working out some of the kinks
among the proposed slates, accord
ing to Krauss.
"Such a large number of con
tenders is probably going to lead to
some confusion as to the actual dif-

ferences among
the slates," said
Myriam Perez of
the Centennial
Slate.
Confusion al
ready has arisen
over the names of

the slates. Two slates submitted
proposals to be called the Just Do
It Slate.
"We obviously are not going to
allow two slates with identical
names to be put on the ballot," said
Krauss. He does not yet know which
of the two slates will be forced to
change its name.
The names "Slate of the Century"
and "Centennial Slate" are also con
sidered too similar by some people
on each of these slates. However,
Krauss is allowing both slates to
retain their names if they choose.
"Even though they are both
trying to capitalize on the same
theme, since they have distinguish
able names, I don't see any over
riding need to change them."
