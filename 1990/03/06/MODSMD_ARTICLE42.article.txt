Problems of working women, from profes
sors to blue-collar laborers, were the subject
of a Women's 'Herstory' Week panel discussion
yesterday.
History Prof. Estelle Freedman, United
Stanford Workers chief steward Linda Crouse
and Dinah Leventhal, a national youth section
organizer for the Democratic Socialists of
America, told a Stanford audience about the
history of the women's movement and current
struggles of women in conjunction with the
labor movement. The panel was titled,
"Women, Work and Discrimination: A Campus
Perspective."
Freedman spoke about the struggle of

women to be accepted into universities as
students and later as faculty. The percentage
of women on university faculties has decreased
since its peak in the 19305, she said. Currently,
26 percent of faculty members nationwide are
women.
She added that women are heavily over
represented in low-level academic jobs and
underrepresented in higher positions.
Crouse spoke specifically about the prob
lems facing the blue-collar worker. She said
blue-collar workers "live from paycheck to
paycheck" and that their work is an "endless
stream of drudgery." She said the majority
of women are "procreational slaves" and
"wage slaves."
Crouse said change needs to come from a

militant and united women's movement.
She urged the Stanford community to take
part in the struggle for change by making
sure that upward mobility of women in the
workplace does not mean "the right to exploit
workers." She said the role of the laborer is
to "insist that the unions stay progressive
and aligned with the women's movement."
Leventhal, who attended Harvard and was
active in the drive for unionization at Harvard,
said, "We all need to be loyal fighters in the
struggle to make our universities more
humane and democratic for all."
The panel was co-sponsored by the Stanford
Democratic Socialists of America and Women's
Herstory Week.
