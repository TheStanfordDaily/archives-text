# Images of a past era
## Computer simulation illuminates film industry 
### Kathy Toy Staff writer 
Your boss has left a note on your desk:
/ want you to look through this catalog and
order three films for us to show at the Crystal
Palace on opening night.
— Mr. Zukor
The pressure is on. As a loyal assistant,
you must decide which films the audience will
like. Choosing correctly will mean success for
you as well as the company. Failure will put
you out on the street.
But wait — the Crystal Palace opened at
the beginning of the century, and your boss,
Adolph Zukor, was one of Hollywood's greatest
producers back in the era of silent films.
This is not a time warp. This is Mogul.
Mogul is a computer-based interactive
simulation being developed by Communication
Prof. Henry Breitrose. His idea was to create
a program that would help students under
stand the decision-making process in the early
film industry.

"I was interested in seeing how technology
could be applied to specific pedagogical prob
lems," he says.
Breitrose, who teaches "History of Film"
in the Communication Department, took his
idea to the staff of Academic Information
Resources. AIR operates a project designed to
help faculty explore computer use in the class
room.
Since June, a team of AIR staffers has been
creating Mogul in its Laboratory for Author
ing Multimedia Programs. AIR systems pro
grammer Brodie Lockard is one of four people
currently working to turn Breitrose's idea into
reality.
"It's necessary to have a whole team of
people," says Lockard. He explains that each
specialist works on a different area of the
program, with some writing the script and
others doing programming or graphic designs.
Lockard compares his task to that of writing
a word processing program. The designing
team has written most of Mogul and now has
only to add additional text, he says.
Yet Mogul is much more than a word proc
essor. The simulation program combines a

Macintosh II with a video screen. Players can
click on the video as they would on a Mac
intosh monitor to learn valuable information.
The use of graphic overlay on video puts
the program "on the cutting edge of technol
ogy," according to Lockard.
The videodisc includes period slides and film
clips as well as material shot especially for
Mogul. The video allows the user to look at
a map to find locations or to "visit" penny
arcades and theaters, for example.
Mogul is an educational tool which can be
played like a game. How well players do is
measured by the amount of respect they
receive from Mr. Zukor.
The nameplate above the player's desk on
the video screen changes to reflect successes
and failures.
However, both the thrill of victory and the
agony of defeat are limited by fact, explains
sophomore Jesse Ellenbogen, one of the Mogul
team members.
"We have to let the user interact and make
decisions, while at the same time we must
deal with history," he says.
