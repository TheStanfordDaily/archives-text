# Russian lawyer details reforms
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
The right to a trial by jury may
he constitutionally guaranteed in
the United States, but it was only
granted to Soviets last December
— for the first time since 1917.
This is but one example of the
sweeping reforms in the Soviet
legal system, said Russian lawyer
Alexander Podolsky at the Law
School yesterday. In a talk titled
"Legal Perestroika: Changes in
the Soviet System," Podolsky said
the USSR's movie toward a more
democratic society has brought
about the need to reshape its legal
structure.
Podolsky said the Soviet Union
must create what he called a
"rule-of-law state," in which the
country "must rely much more
on legal frameworks than on po
litical decision-making and party
bureaucracy."
Podolsky described the Soviet
legal system as "rather different"
from that of the United States,
since it relies on codified, written
laws instead of case laws and
precedents.
"Soviet judges apply the laws,

The Soviet Union
must create a 'rule-of
law state.'

but they don't create them," he
explained. • Laws are created
through the legislative process, as
opposed to the court system, al
though Podolsky said this might
change soon.
Podolsky and 16 other Soviet
lawyers came to the United States
last September for a seven-month
exchange to work in American law
firms and universities. He has
been working for a San Francisco
firm and learning more about in
ternational trade and foreign joint
ventures, as well as practicing civil
and criminal law.
"So many things have changed
[in the USSR] since I came to the
United States," Podolsky said. In
addition to trial by jury, Russians
now have the opportunity to ask
for a lawyer from the point of
arrest. In the past, defendants
were often left without legal ad
vice, he said.

Improvements are being made
in the Soviet legal system, but
problems remain. While the
United States has an overabun
dance of lawyers, Podolsky said,
"it's the opposite situation in the
Soviet Union."
Another problem the Soviets
face is becoming able to deal eco
nomically with other nations.
"The Soviets don't know about
mortgages, loans or banking
laws," Podolsky said.
"We're in a unique, exciting po
sition to help revise the Soviet
legal system," Podolsky said of
himself and the other Soviet
lawyers on exchange in the United
States.
He added that their visit
enables them to "adopt the best
parts of the Western legal system
and leave what's not good about
it," while retaining the good
points of the Soviet system.
"I definitely hope the role of
attorney will grow in the Soviet
Union," Podolsky concluded. As
"we're going to abandon the one
party system and the domination
of terror," he said, "the laws
should have dominance, not the
political decisions."
