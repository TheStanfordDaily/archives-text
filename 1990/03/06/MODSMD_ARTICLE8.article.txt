# It's 7 o'clock. Do you know where your senator is?
## Many ASSU representatives have compiled less-than-perfect attendance records 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Campaigning last spring to be an ASSU
graduate senator, Theodora Varvarigou
promised to shift the focus of the senate
toward graduate students.
Her campaign efforts paid off hand
somely when she received 467 votes, the
highest number of any graduate student
candidate.
Despite all the promises, she has made
even less progress toward fulfilling her
campaign pledges than most ASSU pol
iticians.
Varvarigou hasn't been to any of the
11 senate meetings held this year.
Her attendance record isn't unique.
Graduate senator Miguel Rodriguez
hasn't been to any meetings either. And
graduate senators Bob Griffin and Larry

Galka have only been to one meeting
apiece.
In fact, of the 37 graduate and under
graduate senators elected last year, 19
have missed four or more meetings, ac
cording to senate attendance records. Of
those 19, 14 are graduate senators and
four are no longer registered students.
Why do these senators skip out on so
many meetings?
Senate chair Ed Sasaki, who has at
tended every session, said, "It's a mix.
It's partly apathy, and partly because the
graduate students are split up into dif
ferent schools and it's hard to get a critical
mass" of enough motivated graduate stu
dents agreeing on a single issue.
Senate procedures specify that a
senator may be expelled after five unex
cused absences from either full senate
meetings or committee meetings in any

one quarter. Only Varvarigou, Rodriguez
and undergrad Ted Lieu missed that
many full senate meetings in the fall.
Lieu has since resigned. Sasaki said at
tendance records for committee meetings
are poorly kept and generally unavailable.
Sasaki also said that if too many
senators resign or are expelled, the senate
will have to hold a special election, which
will cost a bundle for the cash-strapped
ASSU.
Graduate senator Lawrence Greenberg
gives another reason for having skipped
eight meetings. "I realized that since
prodedure was so completely ignored,"
he felt a "combination between protest
and disgust, with an emphasis on dis
gust."
Greenberg said he objected to financial
mananger Sandra Leal's hasty approval
last summer, without full senate go

ahead, of a $39,000 loan to ASSU Type
setting for a color photocopier. At an Oct.
10 meeting, the senate retroactively ap
proved the loan after Leal said the timing
of the loan saved the ASSU about $7,500.
And even though a senate seat gives
him a voice in senate conduct, Greenberg
said that "on the occasions I've had some
thing to say, it didn't seem worth the
mental energy" because "it doesn't seem
like a place with open, intellectual inter
change."
In addition, Greenberg said he was sur
prised he even was elected in last year's
balloting, as he was not a candidate. "I
voted for me to collect fee refunds. . . .
For some reason, I won," he said.
Greenberg was elected on a write-in
ballot and has not resigned his post be
cause "it seemed pointless." Since there
are often fewer candidates than graduate

senator positions, it is easy for write-in
candidates to be elected.
Varvarigou, on the other hand, has
gone to no meetings on account of her
tough schedule. She added that she is
planning to resign.
Rodriguez, although still on senate at
tendance lists, no longer attends the Uni
versity and lives in Los Angeles. Galka,
who went to one meeting, has graduated
and moved away.
Griffin, who has skipped 10 meetings,
could not be reached. He is not listed in
the student nor local telephone directory.
Senator Michael Tiemann failed to at
tend nine meetings because he stopped
out of school in January. He said he
missed fall meetings because he spent
most of his time trying to obtain startup
funding for a business. He has not yet
resigned.
