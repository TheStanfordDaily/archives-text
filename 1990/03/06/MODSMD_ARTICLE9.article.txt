Devilish defective drive abducted
An infected Apple Macintosh hard drive re
cently stolen from the Storke Publications Build
ing may be getting revenge on its new owner.
The $1,800 drive, used to create the Stanford
Student Directory, was reported missing Friday
from the directory office, according to police. The
unit, however, had not been in use since Novem
ber due to system problems.
"It had a nasty virus we couldn't get rid of,
so we disconnected it and left it on the side,"
said Morris Sim, the directory's project director.
Sim added that all the data on the drive had
been backed up.
The loss was discovered Thursday, but the
drive had not been seen since a week earlier,
according to Sim.
The police found no signs of forced entry and
no clues, according to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, but a staff member remembered find
ing the door unlocked last Monday morning.

Stanford issues 100 th
license on recombinant DNA
Stanford and UC-San Francisco announced last
week that the Henkel Group has become the
100 th licensee of recombinant DNA technology,
which is patented by the two schools.
This marks the first time 100 licenses for the
gene cloning techniques have been registered con
currently.
The Henkel Group, based in Diisseldorf, West
Germany, manufactures consumer personal-care
and cleaning products and adhesives. One of the
company's subsidiaries, the Henkel Research
Corp., based in Santa Rosa, Calif., is using genetic
engineering techniques for research in industrial
enzymes and biocatalysts, according to Kenneth
MacKay, president of the corporation.
Sales of all recombinant products worldwide
totaled more than $1 billion at the end of 1988,
according to Katharine Ku, associate director of
Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing. To
date, the royalty income from the patents is more
than $17 million, she said. Stanford and the
University of California share net royalties equal
ly.

The trio of gene cloning patents, which will
expire in 1997, is based on work carried out in
1973 by Stanley Cohen, professor of genetics at
the School of Medicine, and Herbert Boyer, pro
fessor of biochemistry at UC-San Francisco. They
were the first to show how genes of plants and
animals could be dissected, recombined in new
ways and then spliced into "cellular factories."
Their work helped spawn the biotechnology
industry.
Sermon wins national contest
Stanford's Episcopal chaplain, the Rev.
Penelope Duckworth, has been awarded first
place in Harper and Row's Annual Best Sermon
Competition.
Her sermon, "Disbelief for Joy," — which was
preached at Memorial Church last year — won
the Theological or Doctrinal category and was
one of 2,000 contest entries in five categories.
The winning sermons will be published this
spring in "Best Sermon's III."
Athletic cuts named tomorrow
Athletic Director Andy Geiger told The Daily
he would make an announcement about further
changes in the Athletics Department budget to
morrow.
The Athletics Department, which has a budget
mostly independent from the University's general
fund, faces a severe deficit. The department has
already cut funding to the field hockey, track
and field and sailing programs.
Geiger has yet to make a public announcement
of the cuts.
Wanna be an RA?
Residential Education is looking for resident
assistants for next year and will be holding meet
ings at 6 p.m. today, Wednesday and Thursday
for prospective RAs.
RAs-to-be should meet at Elliott Program Cen
ter for the one-hour informational meeting and
one-hour expectation discussion. The back-to
back meetings are designed to help students
decide whether they want to apply for residence
staff positions.
