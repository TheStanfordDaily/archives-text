Turbulence is the most complicated, most common and most
important kind of fluid motion. The wild eddies and tangles of
turbulence can be seen in a coffee cup, in the atmosphere and the
ocean - possibly in the galaxy - and in most fluid flows of
engineering importance. In this popular talk, which will include
exciting demonstrations, Professor Bradshaw will review current
turbulence research at Stanford and elsewhere.
