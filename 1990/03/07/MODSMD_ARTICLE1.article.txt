# Athletics cuts staff, wrestling funding to balance budget
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
In what should be the last of its budget
cuts for this year, the Athletics Depart
ment yesterday cut funding from the
wrestling team and reduced the depart
ment's number of staff positions.
These cuts should enable the Athletics
Department to balance a $1 million
budget deficit caused, to a great extent,
by the rising costs of athletic scholar
ships, Athletic Director Andy Geiger said.
The wrestling team will be changed to

varsity 111 status next year, which means
that it will not receive funding from the
Athletics Department but will still com
pete under the NCAA varsity eligibility
rules, Geiger said.
Geiger has already cut funding from
the sailing and field hockey teams, which
will also be reclassified as varsity 111
sports.
The change in the status of sailing,
field hockey and wrestling will save the
department about $100,000, Geiger
noted. He could not say exactly how much
money was cut from wrestling.

A cut in scholarship funding for the
track and field program will further
reduce the department's deficit.
The funding cuts for the wrestling
team may have a slightly different effect
than those of the sailing and field hockey
teams in that wrestling coach Chris Hor
pel will stay on with the Athletics De
partment. He will take on additional ad
ministrative duties as he continues to
coach the team, Geiger said.
Horpel said he believes the wrestling
team will not be seriously affected by the
cuts because it has relied on its own

fundraising in the past.
"We may have to work a
little harder" to raise
money, he noted.
"The team is not really
that concerned about the
cut in funding," wres
tling team co-captain
Ron Perry said. "The
team is self-sufficient for
the most part."

In addition to the program cuts, a total
of eight to 10 administrative and support
staff positions will be eliminated from

the department, Geiger said.
The Athletics Department will make
these cuts by leaving several unfilled po
sitions vacant, by the process of attrition
and by laying off several people, Geiger
added.
Geiger said he hopes a strong football
schedule and good fundraising in the next
few years will help alleviate some of the
strain on the budget. He also noted that
if the University keeps tuition increases
relatively low, the department will not
spend as much money on financial aid
for athletes.
