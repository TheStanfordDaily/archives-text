# Colorado bank leveled
## Three people killed, only vault remains 
### 
CRESTED BUTTE, Colo. (AP) -
An explosion shattered a two-story
bank yesterday, killing three people
and injuring 14 others, officials said.
Three people were listed in critical
condition.
Firefighters and volunteers dug by
hand through the rubble of the down
town Crested Butte National Bank to
pull out survivors, witnesses said. The
entire building was leveled except for
the vault.
The cause of the blast in this Rocky
Mountain ski resort was not immedi
ately determined, but authorities said
they were investigating the possibility
of a bomb or methane gas buildup.
Crested Butte Police Chief Hank
Smith said two restaurants received
bomb threats over the week, and one
of them was evacuated.
Mayor Wes Light said three bodies
were pulled from the rubble, and all
15 people believed inside during the
explosion were pulled out.
The federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms sent a 12-person
response team to the scene, and Gov.
Roy Romer made National Guard
units available to provide assistance if
needed.
The explosion occurred at 9:15 a.m.,
shortly after the bank opened.
About 200 people responded quickly
to the scene and started digging with
their hands.
"They started digging through the
rubble, helping the people who were
still alive," said Mark Reaman, a pho
tographer for the Chronicle & Pilot
newspaper.
"The whole town would suddenly
become silent, stopping to see if they
could hear someone. It was the most
eerie thing I've ever heard. Luckily,
many times they found someone who
was still alive."
The dead were identified as bank
employee Jade Woelk, Donna Smith
and Monica Henning. Their ages were

not available.
Hope Ostheimer, who works nearby,
said the building "completely collapsed
on itself."
"People started running from their
cars and businesses and just started
digging," said a passerby who identi
fied himself only by his first name,
Brad.
"I started digging, but I wigged out
when I saw the condition of one of
the victims," he said. "One guy crawled
out," but the rest were trapped.
Dusty Demerson, who was in his
shop at Color West Photography about
a block from the bank, also went to
investigate.
"The president of the bank ... was
hanging out the back of the bank by
his legs and we got him down," he said.
By that time, ambulances arrived
and Demerson also started digging for
survivors.
Six of the injured were taken to
Gunnison County Hospital 30 miles
away; the others were treated at
clinics, the mayor said.
Tom Yates, chief of the Gunnison
Police Department, said three people
were in critical condition.
Bob Gillen, communications director
for the Crested Butte ski area, said
the resort put its disaster plan into
effect and handled rescue operations.
"We're doing this as if this was an
avalanche, because what we have here
is a material avalanche," he said.
"They're doing it by hand. We have
some heavy equipment there, but most
of the rescuers are using their hands."
Ron Walters, assistant agent in
charge of the San Francisco district
of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, said agents from Denver and
a 12-person national response scene
were dispatched at the request of local
authorities.
"There was an explosion, but there
are no natural gas lines,in there. We're
puzzled by it," said Gillen. "It doesn't
make sense."
