## Crimes of inaction 
### 
University must take
responsibility for
problems with tenants

STANFORD MUST stop being
a passive observer and start
being an active voice.
Over the last two months, nu
merous stories about abuses by
non-Stanford operations on Stan
ford land have appeared in The
Daily.
In cases from "dirty water"
leaked by Research Park corpora
tions to illegal activity at the golf
course's restaurant to the peren
nial problems at Webb Ranch,
Stanford may seem more a den of
iniquity than the educational in
stitution it is.
University President Donald
Kennedy's Monday statement
pushing Webb Ranch to reach a
settlement of its labor dispute is a
move in the right direction. But a
new formal University protocol on
such issues is what's really needed.
If there's a problem on Stanford
land, whether or not the Univer
sity is directly responsible for the
situation, it's our problem too.
As evidenced by its dealings with
Webb Ranch, the University often
avoids the issue or takes years to
act in even the slightest fashion.
Instead, when a problem is
brought to Stanford's attention,
the administration should actively
seek out a resolution to the situ
ation.
The University should take the
initiative in asking outside, gov

ernmental agencies to investigate
possible violations. Because of the
nature of the University and les
sor/lessee agreements, it would be
difficult for the University to do
its own investigations.
But governmental probes that do
not rely on University personnel
have proven effective in pointing
out legal violations.
Stanford, however, has been
hesitant to act on these reports
through either constructive
dialogues with the parties involved
or, in the most extreme cases, ter
mination of the lease.
The University must realize
that, as a major peninsula lan
downer, it has a moral responsi
bility to assure proper conduct on
its land.
Turning away from legal viola
tions because the University does
not directly contribute to them is
to ignore the part that it plays as
owner of the land.
The University, through the
Real Estate and Lands Manage
ment Office and through the Legal
Office, must make it clear from
the beginning that it means busi
ness.
It must start by putting a state
ment of its position in the rental
contracts: that the University will
request investigations of alleged
wrongdoing, and that if legal vio
lations are found it will take action.
If the administration does not
do so, it will continue to suffer
from bad publicity and the moral
outrage that these violations and
bad press bring.
Now is not the time to do noth
ing. Let us realize our responsibil
ity and begin the courage of action.
