Chicano community is forging positive future for all

IN A RECENT ISSUE of The Stan
ford Review, a front-page article
was run which serves to erode the
gains the Chicano community has
made in the last year. By failing to
acknowledge the tremendous progress
made by the Chicano community, The
Review has offered an uninformed and
negatively-biased view which adversely
affects the building of a multicultural
university.
Furthermore, we feel that it is nec
essary to state that the allegations The
Review has raised against the Office of
Student Affairs and MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group — and the
Chicano community as a whole — are
wrong and do nothing to contribute to
the forward momentum of our commu
nity.

We, as members of the Stanford
community, strongly support the con
viction that all people must be
respected and understood to create a
truly multicultural university. As Uni
versity administrators, Chicano faculty,
staff, and members of MEChA and
other Chicano student organizations,
we have worked to develop positive
relationships and mutual respect.
Together we have contributed to
Stanford's multiculturalism by building
a strong and united El Centro and
Chicano community. In the last six
months alone, we have been able to
provide the community with a full-time
dean, involve many more Chicano
students in the community and provide
more services and educational program
ming to the Stanford community as a

whole.
This year has been an especially
productive one. With the arrival of our
new associate dean of Student Affairs,
Frances Morales, we find ourselves in
an exciting period of positive transition
and a renewed spirit of involvement in
the community.
Events like the Cuauhtemoc Car
denas program, El Gran Baile and
Floricanto have shown the new level of
activity and unity that the Chicano
community has at Stanford.
We constantly extend a warm wel
come to everyone to become involved
during this exciting period in our
community. At this time, we are help
ing develop a governance process that
will further strengthen El Centro, and
this process will include the input of

all people in our community.
We have held true to our vision of a
strong and united community and we
will continue to work together toward
the strength and unity that will con
tribute to multiculturalism at Stanford
