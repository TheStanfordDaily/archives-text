# Columnist's analogy obscured better pro-choice views
## 
### 
Carrie Chang's assertions on the
issue of abortion stand on the edge of
being absurd. Favoring pro-choice for
abortion, I am not criticizing Chang's
stance on the issue but rather her
argument on the matter. Her analogy
of the eraser to abortion is extremely
inappropriate and even damaging to
the pro-choice cause.
Abortion is not in any way like
White-out. Abortion is a choice that
should be made after careful delibera
tion of the other choices such as adop
tion. One does not erase a pregnancy
like a simple mathematical error; to do
so would take the humanity away from
our race.
Abortion is a medical process that
can in fact have psychological ramifica

tions. Abortion is not right for all
women, and it should not be advertised
as an eraser because that gives abor
tion the allure of a panacea. Dangers
arise when a woman is misled to be
lieve that abortion is a simple choice
and necessarily the best choice.
The statement by Chang that sex is
a mistake is incredibly naive. Sex is a
matter of choice, except in the case of
rape, and in making this choice the
people involved, male and female, now
become responsible for any contracep
tive technique that they choose to use.
I must grant that so called sexual
"mistakes" can arise from ignorance of
contraceptive methods, but this is a
matter that must be prevented by edu
cation.
The greatest mistake that 1 can find
in the column is the calling of a rape
induced pregnancy a mistake.
The woman bears no responsibility
for the cause of the pregnancy in the
case of rape. She was forced into the
sexual act and therefore she has made

no mistake. Rape is one of the most
disgusting crimes known to humans,
and the arising pregnancy does not fall
into a category of mistake or non
mistake.
Chang is correct in asserting that
the rate of pregnancy will not decrease
now that abortion has been restricted
in a number of states. The pregnancies
will occur because the law will not
change our sexual morality. Illegal
abortions that threaten the life of the
woman will occur where women cannot
attain an abortion nor afford 10 go
elsewhere to get one.
The right to choose should not be
argued on the basis that abortion
erases the "mistake" of pregnancy; it
should be argued that women have the
right to choose the course of their lives
and the right to control their bodies. A
woman should have the right to choose
an abortion based on her moral stand
ards and her personal deliberation.
