## Power to black women 
### 
BLACK WOMEN! Your time has
come. Cosmo wants you. Glamour
wants you. Vogue wants you. And
ain't it about time, for you have lived in
Barbie's shadow for too long. The sun is
shining on you now.
Over the last seven months I have
noticed black faces gracing the covers of
our nation's top fashion magazines. When
I first saw the cover of the September
issue of Vogue, my mouth hit the ground.
I couldn't beleive my eyes; there was a
sister on the cover. I thought it was a
mistake, until I saw the covers of
Glamour and Mademoiselle. They had
sisters on their covers too, and all in the
same month.
I couldn't figure it out; what was up?
Then it was all explained to me on a
special edition of "USA Today: The TV
Magazine." Their fashion consultant was
claiming the 1990s as the decade for the
"ethnic model." She went on to describe
the "ethnic model" as "exotic," "kinky
haired," "broad-nosed" and "full-lipped."
But we all know they spell one thing,
B-L-A-C-K. Black. That's you, baby!
And now for the creme dele creme.
Both Miss America and the newly
crowned Miss USA are black. Truly sister,
you have arrived!
But black people discovered a long time
ago that big hips and big booties were
beautiful. Even our African brothers and
sisters adhere to the same aesthetic. Not
only are big hips and big booties beau
tiful, but they are necessary tools for
groovin' at Friday night house parties.
And now everbody is taking notice. The
blonde-haired, blue-eyed, anorexic look is
over. Through. Tired. To the curb. Black

is where it's at, and even the white women
are trying to get in on the act.
For years white women have fried
themselves in the sun in order to add a
little "color" to their skins. Now they are
going even farther, and are paying big
bucks to acquire your tools. The latest
craze in cosmetic surgery is lip, butt and
hip implants. Some women are paying
anywhere from $1,500 to $5,000 for the
"black look." Get that! White women are
paying big money to get what, 10 or 15
years ago, black women would have been
glad to give away. And it wasn't that
long ago that a black woman couldn't
even sell toothpaste because her lips were
considered too big.
White women with the "black look"
are now considered the reigning beauty
queens. Singer Taylor Dayne and
actress/model Andie McDowell (of "sex,
lies and videotape" fame) have been
dubbed "sexy" and "gorgeous" for their
"beautiful" full lips. Even Marilyn
Monroe — the quintessential white
beauty — was once quoted as saying, "I
don't care if people don't notice my chest,
as long as they notice my butt."
But don't fret, girlfriend. Only you
have what one black female comedian
has called "the power of the bootie." This
is the power to stop conversation when
you enter the room as all eyes turn on
you. The power to make all the brothers
pay homage to you and your bootie. The
power to make even the most miscellan
eous brother dis' his white girlfriend and
scream "Lord have mercy!"
The "power of the bootie" is a black
thang; it cannot be bought. Its power
has to be passed down from generation

Black is where it's at,
and even the white
women are trying to
get in on the act.

to generation.
Unfortunatley, there is one thing that
can be bought and sold, and that is the
images that appear on the covers of white
fashion magazines. So, what is here today
is gone tomorrow. In fact we saw the
same black craze in the late 1960s and
early 19705, when black models were the
hottest thing since the mini skirt.
Only then, there was none of this "eth
nic model" stuff. Fashion experts weren't
afraid to call a spade a spade, and sisters
were prominently described as "black
models."
So sister, don't rush out to subscribe
to Vogue or Cosmo, because by the time
you get your first issue, you will be out
of style. But don't worry sister, your
black brothers will always pay homage
to you.
Power to the bootie!
