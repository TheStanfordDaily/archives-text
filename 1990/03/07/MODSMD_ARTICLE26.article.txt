## Ice cream chills teeth 
### Megan Beardsley Staff writer 
a. Every time I bite into a
• spoonful of ice cream my
start to ache. Why does
this happen ? Is there anything
1 can do? I don't want to give
up my favorite food.
A. The roots of the teeth,
• usually hidden beneath
your gums, are sensitive not
only to cold foods like ice cream
and Popsicles, but also to heat,
according to an article in Hip
pocrates magazine.
The root of a tooth is basi
cally a mass of nerves covered
by a layer of collagen and
minerals called the dentin. The
roots lack the enamel that
covers the top part of your
teeth, but are usually well
protected by the gums. How
ever, gum disease, aging and
over-energetic brushing can ex
pose the roots to all the envi
ronmental dangers of your
mouth.
Thin tubes link the surface
of the dentin to the nerves in
side. These tubes are filled with
a fluid that responds to changes
in temperature, researchers
say. When the fluid moves, it
irritates the nerves, and you
feel pain. One study showed
that people with more sensitive
teeth have larger tubes than
those with less sensitive teeth,
Hippocrates reports.
To treat super-sensitive
teeth, dentists simply block off
the tubes. They can apply
fluoride gels to clog the tubes
or can block the ends with a
mixture of resins and ad
hesives.
Q # You always hear about
.people who can block out

pain and fear enough to walk
on hot coals. Is there a scientific
explanation for this ability ?

A. If fear makes the fire
• walkers sweat, it actually
may be helpful, according to
Jearl Walker in his book, "The
Flying Circus of Physics with
Answers."
Fire-walkers are protected,
Walker says, by the thin layer
of water vapor that forms as
their sweat-covered feet near
the hot coals. This layer con
ducts heat less efficiently than
the coals and provides a few
seconds of insulation.
