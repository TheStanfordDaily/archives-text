# Reaction distance for molecules found
## 
### Garrett R. Vargas 
For two molecules to form a
product, they must make contact
with each other. It isn't necessary
that they collide head-on, but
rather that they pass reasonably
close to each other.
The big question is: How close
do the molecules have to be to
react? Until recently, no one knew
for sure.
But, Chemistry Prof. Richard
Zare, working with post-doctoral
assistant Pat Vaccaro, graduate
students Daqing Zhao and Thanos
Tsekauras and post-doctoral stu
dent Christine Leach, has an
swered this question.
Zare drew an analogy between
the chemical process of two
molecules colliding and two ice
skaters:
The skaters do not have to meet
head-on to interact, but must pass
close enough so that they can grab
on to each other with their out
stretched arms.
Zare's team used a laser to mea
sure the atomic distances between
the molecules. These distances
were measured in Angstroms —
one Angstrom is one ten-billionth
of a meter, or approximately the
diameter of a hydrogen atom.
The team also had to pick ap
propriate chemical reactants to
work with; they used barium
reacting with hydrogen iodide.
This system was chosen because
the by-product, a hydrogen atom,
is extremely light compared to the
other product, barium iodide. In
the skaters' analogy, this is equiv
alent to one skater losing his hat
— the overall change on the sys
tem is negligible.
The task that Zare and his team
set out to accomplish was mea
suring the impact parameter, the
distance of closest approach be
tween the molecules. They mea
sured the rotation of the resulting
products and then worked back

ward to find the initial conditions.
"Because we can't see chemical
reactions," Zare said, "we need to
use abstract concepts to measure
distances. In this case we are
using the theory of the conserva
tion of angular momentum."
In the skater analogy, the dis
tance that the skaters are apart
when they meet and their initial
speeds will determine the amount
that they will rotate. This amount
does not change during the colli
sion. By measuring this angular
rotation, it is possible to measure
the impact parameter.
These physical principles are
critical to understanding the re
action. "All the people in my
group need to know both physics
and chemistry," Zare said.
In addition, the more the
barium iodide rotated, the less it
vibrated. When the particles hit
head-on, they didn't rotate very
much, but vibrated back and
forth.
The task of actually determin
ing the impact parameter is not
as simple as it may sound, and
Zare has spent the last decade
working on this project.
Zare drew compared the exper
iment to a game he calls Molecular
Archery.
"The rules are that the archer
is blindfolded, and he randomly
launches arrows at the target
(barium). The scoring depends, in
an unknown manner, on the im
pact parameter. The task is to
find the relationship between the
score (final product state) and the
impact parameter."
"Although what we are at
tempting to find is a simple quan
tity," Vaccaro said, "it has taken
numerous graduate careers to
produce results."
Several problems that had to
be solved before any results could
be obtained included setting up
the expensive, delicate equipment
— all of which had to be built so

that it could not be destroyed by
the hydrogen iodide.
Zare and his team discovered
that all of the barium-iodide
molecules with no vibration oc
curred when the impact parame
ter was approximately 4.5
Angstroms.
Further, Zare learned that
molecules produced in a different
vibrational state all corresponded
to an impact parameter of 2.5
Angstroms.
Turning to the archer analogy,

the impact parameters correspond
to rings of the target. The ring
you hit determines the rotation
and vibration of the product.
This may seem obvious, but no
one knew for sure what the result
of the experiment was before it
was performed.
In fact, this experiment applies
only to this particular system in
volving barium and hydrogen
iodide. Zare said doubts the result
applies in general. "What we ob
tained is a unique result," he said.
