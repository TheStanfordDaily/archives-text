# Drink water during exercise

The importance of sufficient
water consumption, one of the
most obvious nutritional require
ments, is frequently overlooked.
Most health-oriented individ
uals tend to focus on such current
trends as cholesterol and salt re
duction or calcium intake. While
these subjects are indeed of im
portance, they tend to overshadow
the equally-crucial dietary
benefits of water.
The average adult body con
tains about 45 quarts of water â€”
about two-thirds of the body by
weight. An average of three
quarts of water are lost daily
through perspiration and excre
tion, and this figure rises
astronomically for individuals
who live in hot, dry climates or
engage in vigorous exercise.
Since the body's water require
ment usually exceeds the amount
needed to quench thirst, it is im
portant for everyone, not just ath
letes, to pay attention to their
fluid intake.
Water is responsible for nearly
every bodily process, including
digestion, circulation, nutrient
transport, excretion and growth.
In addition, sufficient amounts of
water are necessary to regulate
body temperature, extremely im

portant to those who exercise on
a regular basis.
Normal body processes neces
sitate a recommended intake of
six to eight eight-ounce glasses of
water daily; however, these
amounts rise with increased phys
ical activity.
Although exact measurements
vary, it is often recommended that
people drink one or two eight
ounce glasses of water two or
three hours before engaging in ex
ercise, and an additional glass fif
teen minutes before.
The process of hyperhydration
is often recommended during very
hot weather. Under these circum
stances, one should increase water
consumption to two or three
glasses two or three hours in ad
vance and one or two cups 15
minutes before starting exercise.
To prevent dehydration and reg
ulate body temperature, one
should try to drink one or two

mouthfuls of water every 10 or
20 minutes during exercise.
Several water fountains along
Campus Drive are very accessible
to thirsty joggers. One is located
by the golf driving range and an
other is by the Medical Center
parking structure.
Sufficient water intake is ex
tremely important for athletes.
Dehydration during physical
activity can result in dizziness,
fatigue, nausea and even fainting
or death in severe cases.
Although any liquid is better
than none, water is preferable
over specially designed sports
drinks. Due to their high sugar
concentration, the water in such
drinks is absorbed more slowly
from the stomach, delaying
rehydration.
In addition, cold water is ab
sorbed more quickly than warmer
water.
Another consideration, particu
larly for college students, is the
dehydrating effects of alcohol.
Water depletion caused by the me
tabolism of alcohol is largely re
sponsible for the uncomfortable
headaches, dizziness and nausea
associated with hangovers. Drink
ing water after alcohol consump
tion can lessen these after-effects.
The body also absorbs water
from a variety of fruits and veg
etables.
