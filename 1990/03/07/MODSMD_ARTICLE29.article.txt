# Doctor heals eyes with light

A woman sits in a chair, looking into a strange
mechanism. Dr. Michael Gaynon of the School
of Medicine peers into a magnifying eyepiece in
the machine, carefully maneuvers a joystick and
then presses a button with his foot. There is a
brief pulse of light and the treatment is complete.
Laser surgery on eyes is a novel concept, as
it seems intuitively dangerous to apply concen
trated light to the eye. After all, staring at the
sun for lengthy periods of time can damage the
retina, an array of cells on the back surface of
the eye that actually sense light. It would appear
that the super-concentrated blast of light that a
laser emits, however thin it might be, might
easily permanently burn the retina.
In fact, that is the purpose of laser eye surgery
— photocoagulation, or burning with light.
Gaynon uses a very weak light called an aiming
beam to determine exactly where the laser is to
be applied. Then, keeping the aiming joystick
steady, he presses with his foot a button which
fires the laser.
The one-and-a-half-watt beam is applied for
about one-tenth of a second. The beam travels
through the clear cornea, the outer covering of
the eye, and passes through the pupil to the
retina. A very small circular piece of the retina
is burned.
There are a number of diseases which can be
treated using laser surgery. For example,
diabetics can sometimes develop a condition called
macular edema, in which fluids leak from the
retina into the center of the eye. By applying the
laser to the small leaking area, it can be seared

and sealed.
A condition found often in boxers, though less
often in the general populace, is the retinal tear,
a small rip in the inner layer of the retina.
Should it remain untreated, the rip could expand
and eventually the inner layer could partially
detach from the outer layer. To prevent the tear
from spreading, the laser is applied several times,
forming several concentric circles of burns —
similar to spot-welds — around the tear to rejoin
the layers of the retina.
While peripheral vision may be diminished,
burning the retina repeatedly does not substan
tially reduce detail vision. A high concentration
of cone cells, the cells responsible for detecting
detail, are concentrated in a small area of the
retina called the fovea. As long as the fovea is
intact, it is still possible to have 20-20 vision.
The Heliotrope, a series of mirrors and lenses
that focus sunlight to a very fine beam directed
onto the retina, was the first device to enable
light to be used for eye surgery. Due to the
frequent lack of bright sunlight, the focused light
of white xenon arc lamps, like those used as
stage lights in theaters, replaced sunlight in this
apparatus.
In the early 19705, a ruby laser was first
applied to the task. The major problem with the
ruby laser was that if the patient started bleeding,
the red laser light would be reflected by the blood
and the bleeding could not be stopped. Currently,
the most popular setup is the argon laser, which
can produce either blue-green or green beams.
Current experimentation focuses on reshaping
the cornea with a laser to correct natural defects
and remove the need for glasses.
