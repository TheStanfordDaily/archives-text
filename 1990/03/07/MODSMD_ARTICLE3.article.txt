# Houses to get new identities
## Three quake-damaged residences will live elsewhere 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
Residents of three campus houses received a letter
under their doors yesterday informing them that
their houses will be "borrowed" by three displaced
student residence groups next year.
The letter from Row director Diana Conklin said
that 553 Mayfield will house the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity and that the residents of the Phi Psi and
Synergy co-ops will be housed in the Grove houses
and the AD House.
In addition, Durand House — which was closed
after the Oct. 17 earthquake — will re-open as a
University-operated residence known as Grove-
Durand.
Conklin said the University decided to intervene
because it was doubtful that the displaced programs
would survive after two years out of housing. "We
want to help preserve them because they're valued
programs," she said.
Although rumors about the possible switches
abounded last week in many residences, the an
nouncement yesterday sparked mixed reactions from
students in the replacement houses.
"I was shocked," said senior Alison Chinn, a res
ident assistant in Grove-Mayfield. "Nobody even
guessed that Grove was considered."
Conklin said the final decision was based in large
part on the desire to "spread the impact of the
earthquake" evenly upon the three types of housing
options: co-ops, self-ops and University-operated
houses.
Grove is currently one of three non-theme

University-operated Row residen
ces, the other two being the too
small Durand and the traditionally
popular 558 Mayfield residences.
"I think they chose Grove by
default," Chinn said. The Grove res
idence consists of two separate
houses. Although residents of
Grove-Mayfield and Grove-Lasuen
dine and attend house meetings to
gether, the houses have two small

kitchens which would not make the houses "con
ducive to co-op communities," Chinn said.
However, she added that most Grove residents
would not be returning anyway because the house
currently does not have a priority system in place.
The choice of 553 Mayfield as the temporary Delt
house came as less of a surprise to its residents,
but the announcement was met with much stronger
opposition.
"I think it's an outrage," said senior Edan Cassidy,
who was recently elected one of 553 Mayfield's three
house managers for next year, a job which would
guarantee him a space in the house. "The University
didn't pay respect to the system already in the
house," Cassidy said. "We're not getting the deal
we were promised."
Rumors that Conklin was considering 553
Mayfield as a replacement house had been circulat
ing among residents for some time.
The residence is the former home of the Delta
Upsilon fraternity, which was disbanded in 1986.
It has oniy been an open house in the Draw for
four years.
