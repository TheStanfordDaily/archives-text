# Pac-10 hoops on rebound
## 
### 
Tomorrow, the fourth annual
Pacific 10 Conference Men's
Basketball Tournament
gets underway. It will be the last.
In its brief history, the tourna
ment has provided few great mo
ments but caused a great number
of headaches. Last season, the
Cardinal played in the final
against Arizona on a Sunday —
its third game in three days —
and returned home only to pack
its bags and head for Greensboro,
N.C. to meet Siena.

Stanford was not making any
excuses for its loss to the Saints,
but felt too many games and too
much travel in too little time were
reason enough to vote out the Pac
-10 party. Virtually all the other
teams in the conference cast their
ballots likewise, with academic
concerns being cited as the main
reason to eliminate the tourna
ment.
The Pac-10 now rejoins the Ivy
League and Big Ten as the only
conferences without an end-of
the-season affair. It would seem
like a downwardly mobile move
for a conference that has been on
the upswing in recent years.
Pac-10 universities dominate
in virtually every sport
from football to water polo.
Between UCLA, USC and Stan
ford, the league can boast of more
national champions than any
other by a wide margin. In men's
basketball, however, there has
been much mediocrity.
Yet, progress has been made.
Under Lute Olson, Arizona is now
a perennial power able to contend
for a Final Four spot nearly every
year. Notwithstanding their mys
tifying 15th place in the Associ
ated Press poll, the Wildcats rank
No. 3 on Jeff Sagarin's computer
ratings — a far better indicator
of NCAA tournament seedings.
With the addition of transfer
Chris Mills and New York prep
superstar Khalid Reeves, Arizona
may be next year's preseason No.
1. The Wildcats' brethren in
Tempe, a non-factor in recent
years, are also headed for a new
halcyon era.
Super recruiter Bill Frieder has
a top-five recruiting class coming
to Arizona State next season —
even though the Sun Devils will
probably finish under .500 in
1990. If Southern Californian Ed
O'Bannon, one of the top high
school power forwards in the
country, signs with the Sun Devils
in April their recruits will be the
nation's best.
UCLA, despite its recent slide,
is clearly on the rise with most
of L.A.'s top talent willing to
remain home rather than head
for Syracuse, UNLV and the like.
California is headed for its fourth
postseason berth in five years and
its first NCAA tournament since
1960. Oregon, a perennial door
mat, is NIT bound.
Even Stanford, which once went
46 years without playing in the
postseason, will likely continue on
into mid-March for the third
straight year.
So much for the good news.
Now, consider that with all
its recent success, the Pac-10
is still not one of the five Relevant
Conferences: Big Ten, Big East,
Big Eight, Atlantic Coast and
Southeastern.
The Relevant Conferences send
between three and six teams to
the NCAAs every year (the Big
Ten will actually send an unprece
dented seven this season). When
surprise teams make runs in the
tourney they are most often from
these conferences.
Lorenzo Charles led the ACC's
N.C. State to a shocking national
title in the 1980s. Ed Pinckney
did the same for a Cinderella Vil
lanova squad from the Big East.
Rick Pitino worked his magic for
another Big East club, Provi
dence, and took them to the Final
Four.
Even most of the Sweet 16
surprises are from the Relevant
Conferences. The Pac-10, despite
holding a marginal edge on the
SEC this season in the power
ratings (the edge will evaporate
next season when Pitino puts
Kentucky back on the glory trail),
is not yet Relevant.
One of the big reasons is tele
vision. Playing its games on the
West Coast Thursday nights, the
league is not a meaningful player
in any of the big ESPN packages


Mark
Rogowsky
like Big Monday or ACC-Big East
Wednesday.
Without a big weekday deal to
help generate interest, the
league's weekend games — be
tween teams the average
Easterner knows nothing about
— are rarely televised by the net
works. The lack of exposure
causes few people across the coun
try to care about the Pac-10.
Since hardly anyone cares,
there is no ratings incentive for
any of the college basketball
power brokers to televise confer
ence games. The circularity of the
problem should be apparent.
Given the league's commitment to
academics it is unlikely any pro
posal to move games to Mondays
or Tuesdays will meet with ap
proval.

However, in order to bring
the Pac-10 to a new com
petitive level, it will have
to get the national television ex
posure that attracts recruits. A
possible move is a 6 p.m. start
time for Thursday games so that
they can capture the 9 p.m., post-
Sports Center start time, on the
East Coast.
An ESPN deal would go a long
way because then the Dick Vitales
and Bill Rafterys would rant and
rave about the Adam Keefes and
Brian Hendricks of the world in
the middle of the other games
they do. It would be analogous to
Vitale's proselytizing about the
virtues of Michigan's Rumeal Rob
inson as Syracuse's Billy Owens
dunks over Georgetown's Alonzo
Mourning.
By no means does this suggest
that ESPN is the panacea that
will cure the Pac-10's Irrelevant
Conference Syndrome, but it
would be a step in the right di
rection. Though the package
would bring in money as well, it
is the exposure that would carry
the most value.
Fortunately, many small strides
have already been taken. The
league can boast of a corps of

bright coaches who are movers
and shakers. Aside from the afore
mentioned Olson and Frieder,
Cal's Lou Campanelli is one of
the most respected offensive
minds in the game.
Jim Harrick is singlehandedly
keeping the Los Angelenos from
straying away. Don Monson has
Oregon overachieving. USC's
George Raveling, another recruit
ing wizard, appears to be unravel
ing no longer. Mike Montgomery
has the preseason pundits
scratching their heads as he leads
the 17-10 Cardinal.
Best of all, the Pac-10 can claim
to be where it is while staying
within the rules. Nearly all of the
Relevant Conferences have teams
that have been slapped with an
NCAA probation recently or will
soon receive one.
To wit: Illinois (Big Ten) faces
the possibility of the death penalty
for offering Illinois freshman
Deon Thomas $80,000 and a car;
N.C. State (ACC), already banned
from this year's NCAA tourney,
may go down for point shaving
while Wake Forest and Maryland
are recently off probation
(Maryland is about to get hit
again, this time with a two-year

postseason ban); Kentucky (SEC)
is suffering now for sending Mills
$1,000 in an ill-fated Emery en
velope.
Missouri (Big Eight) is facing
strict scrutiny for miraculous suc
cess in recruiting kids from
Detroit while neighbor Kansas
has just been paroled.
There is an opportunity for
the Pac-10 to reach Rele
vant Status and serve as a
shining example of how to do it
on the up-and-up. As we bid
farewell to a Pac-10 Tournament
that generated little fan interest
in the first place, look upon its
elimination not as a sign of weak
ness but as a sign of focusing on
the conference's strengths.
Pacific 10 basketball is not yet
in the upper echelon; Pac-10 aca
demics, however, are among the
best in the country. If ESPN
would come calling, the league
might take its play to a new level
and get the opportunity to show
the nation what is truly Relevant.

Tomorrow, the fourth annual
Pacific 10 Conference Men's
Basketball Tournament
gets underway. It will be the last.
In its brief history, the tourna
ment has provided few great mo
ments but caused a great number
of headaches. Last season, the
Cardinal played in the final
against Arizona on a Sunday —
its third game in three days —
and returned home only to pack
its bags and head for Greensboro,
N.C. to meet Siena.

Stanford was not making any
excuses for its loss to the Saints,
but felt too many games and too
much travel in too little time were
reason enough to vote out the Pac
-10 party. Virtually all the other
teams in the conference cast their
ballots likewise, with academic
concerns being cited as the main
reason to eliminate the tourna
ment.
The Pac-10 now rejoins the Ivy
League and Big Ten as the only
conferences without an end-of
the-season affair. It would seem
like a downwardly mobile move
for a conference that has been on
the upswing in recent years.
Pac-10 universities dominate
in virtually every sport
from football to water polo.
Between UCLA, USC and Stan
ford, the league can boast of more
national champions than any
other by a wide margin. In men's
basketball, however, there has
been much mediocrity.
Yet, progress has been made.
Under Lute Olson, Arizona is now
a perennial power able to contend
for a Final Four spot nearly every
year. Notwithstanding their mys
tifying 15th place in the Associ
ated Press poll, the Wildcats rank
No. 3 on Jeff Sagarin's computer
ratings — a far better indicator
of NCAA tournament seedings.
With the addition of transfer
Chris Mills and New York prep
superstar Khalid Reeves, Arizona
may be next year's preseason No.
1. The Wildcats' brethren in
Tempe, a non-factor in recent
years, are also headed for a new
halcyon era.
Super recruiter Bill Frieder has
a top-five recruiting class coming
to Arizona State next season —
even though the Sun Devils will
probably finish under .500 in
1990. If Southern Californian Ed
O'Bannon, one of the top high
school power forwards in the
country, signs with the Sun Devils
in April their recruits will be the
nation's best.
UCLA, despite its recent slide,
is clearly on the rise with most
of L.A.'s top talent willing to
remain home rather than head
for Syracuse, UNLV and the like.
California is headed for its fourth
postseason berth in five years and
its first NCAA tournament since
1960. Oregon, a perennial door
mat, is NIT bound.
Even Stanford, which once went
46 years without playing in the
postseason, will likely continue on
into mid-March for the third
straight year.
So much for the good news.
Now, consider that with all
its recent success, the Pac-10
is still not one of the five Relevant
Conferences: Big Ten, Big East,
Big Eight, Atlantic Coast and
Southeastern.
The Relevant Conferences send
between three and six teams to
the NCAAs every year (the Big
Ten will actually send an unprece
dented seven this season). When
surprise teams make runs in the
tourney they are most often from
these conferences.
Lorenzo Charles led the ACC's
N.C. State to a shocking national
title in the 1980s. Ed Pinckney
did the same for a Cinderella Vil
lanova squad from the Big East.
Rick Pitino worked his magic for
another Big East club, Provi
dence, and took them to the Final
Four.
Even most of the Sweet 16
surprises are from the Relevant
Conferences. The Pac-10, despite
holding a marginal edge on the
SEC this season in the power
ratings (the edge will evaporate
next season when Pitino puts
Kentucky back on the glory trail),
is not yet Relevant.
One of the big reasons is tele
vision. Playing its games on the
West Coast Thursday nights, the
league is not a meaningful player
in any of the big ESPN packages


Mark
Rogowsky
like Big Monday or ACC-Big East
Wednesday.
Without a big weekday deal to
help generate interest, the
league's weekend games — be
tween teams the average
Easterner knows nothing about
— are rarely televised by the net
works. The lack of exposure
causes few people across the coun
try to care about the Pac-10.
Since hardly anyone cares,
there is no ratings incentive for
any of the college basketball
power brokers to televise confer
ence games. The circularity of the
problem should be apparent.
Given the league's commitment to
academics it is unlikely any pro
posal to move games to Mondays
or Tuesdays will meet with ap
proval.

However, in order to bring
the Pac-10 to a new com
petitive level, it will have
to get the national television ex
posure that attracts recruits. A
possible move is a 6 p.m. start
time for Thursday games so that
they can capture the 9 p.m., post-
Sports Center start time, on the
East Coast.
An ESPN deal would go a long
way because then the Dick Vitales
and Bill Rafterys would rant and
rave about the Adam Keefes and
Brian Hendricks of the world in
the middle of the other games
they do. It would be analogous to
Vitale's proselytizing about the
virtues of Michigan's Rumeal Rob
inson as Syracuse's Billy Owens
dunks over Georgetown's Alonzo
Mourning.
By no means does this suggest
that ESPN is the panacea that
will cure the Pac-10's Irrelevant
Conference Syndrome, but it
would be a step in the right di
rection. Though the package
would bring in money as well, it
is the exposure that would carry
the most value.
Fortunately, many small strides
have already been taken. The
league can boast of a corps of

bright coaches who are movers
and shakers. Aside from the afore
mentioned Olson and Frieder,
Cal's Lou Campanelli is one of
the most respected offensive
minds in the game.
Jim Harrick is singlehandedly
keeping the Los Angelenos from
straying away. Don Monson has
Oregon overachieving. USC's
George Raveling, another recruit
ing wizard, appears to be unravel
ing no longer. Mike Montgomery
has the preseason pundits
scratching their heads as he leads
the 17-10 Cardinal.
Best of all, the Pac-10 can claim
to be where it is while staying
within the rules. Nearly all of the
Relevant Conferences have teams
that have been slapped with an
NCAA probation recently or will
soon receive one.
To wit: Illinois (Big Ten) faces
the possibility of the death penalty
for offering Illinois freshman
Deon Thomas $80,000 and a car;
N.C. State (ACC), already banned
from this year's NCAA tourney,
may go down for point shaving
while Wake Forest and Maryland
are recently off probation
(Maryland is about to get hit
again, this time with a two-year

postseason ban); Kentucky (SEC)
is suffering now for sending Mills
$1,000 in an ill-fated Emery en
