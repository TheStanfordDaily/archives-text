# Pac-10 hoops on rebound

### 
Tomorrow, the fourth annual
Pacific 10 Conference Men's
Basketball Tournament
gets underway. It will be the last.
In its brief history, the tourna
ment has provided few great mo
ments but caused a great number
of headaches. Last season, the
Cardinal played in the final
against Arizona on a Sunday —
its third game in three days —
and returned home only to pack
its bags and head for Greensboro,
N.C. to meet Siena.

Stanford was not making any
excuses for its loss to the Saints,
but felt too many games and too
much travel in too little time were
reason enough to vote out the Pac
-10 party. Virtually all the other
teams in the conference cast their
ballots likewise, with academic
concerns being cited as the main
reason to eliminate the tourna
ment.
The Pac-10 now rejoins the Ivy
League and Big Ten as the only
conferences without an end-of
the-season affair. It would seem
like a downwardly mobile move
for a conference that has been on
the upswing in recent years.
Pac-10 universities dominate
in virtually every sport
from football to water polo.
Between UCLA, USC and Stan
ford, the league can boast of more
national champions than any
other by a wide margin. In men's
basketball, however, there has
been much mediocrity.
Yet, progress has been made.
Under Lute Olson, Arizona is now
a perennial power able to contend
for a Final Four spot nearly every
year. Notwithstanding their mys
tifying 15th place in the Associ
ated Press poll, the Wildcats rank
No. 3 on Jeff Sagarin's computer
ratings — a far better indicator
of NCAA tournament seedings.
With the addition of transfer
Chris Mills and New York prep
superstar Khalid Reeves, Arizona
may be next year's preseason No.
1. The Wildcats' brethren in
Tempe, a non-factor in recent
years, are also headed for a new
halcyon era.
Super recruiter Bill Frieder has
a top-five recruiting class coming
to Arizona State next season —
even though the Sun Devils will
probably finish under .500 in
1990. If Southern Californian Ed
O'Bannon, one of the top high
school power forwards in the
country, signs with the Sun Devils
in April their recruits will be the
nation's best.
UCLA, despite its recent slide,
is clearly on the rise with most
of L.A.'s top talent willing to
remain home rather than head
for Syracuse, UNLV and the like.
California is headed for its fourth
postseason berth in five years and
its first NCAA tournament since
1960. Oregon, a perennial door
mat, is NIT bound.
Even Stanford, which once went
46 years without playing in the
postseason, will likely continue on
into mid-March for the third
straight year.
So much for the good news.
Now, consider that with all
its recent success, the Pac-10
is still not one of the five Relevant
Conferences: Big Ten, Big East,
Big Eight, Atlantic Coast and
Southeastern.
The Relevant Conferences send
between three and six teams to
the NCAAs every year (the Big
Ten will actually send an unprece
dented seven this season). When
surprise teams make runs in the
tourney they are most often from
these conferences.
Lorenzo Charles led the ACC's
N.C. State to a shocking national
title in the 1980s. Ed Pinckney
did the same for a Cinderella Vil
lanova squad from the Big East.
Rick Pitino worked his magic for
another Big East club, Provi
dence, and took them to the Final
Four.
Even most of the Sweet 16
surprises are from the Relevant
Conferences. The Pac-10, despite
holding a marginal edge on the
SEC this season in the power
ratings (the edge will evaporate
next season when Pitino puts
Kentucky back on the glory trail),
is not yet Relevant.
One of the big reasons is tele
vision. Playing its games on the
West Coast Thursday nights, the
league is not a meaningful player
in any of the big ESPN packages
