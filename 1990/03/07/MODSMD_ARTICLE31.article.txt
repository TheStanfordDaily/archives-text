## Griffin's two grand slams lift Cardinal 
### David Hirning Editorial staff 
The number 13 was an extremely un
lucky one for the Santa Clara Broncos
yesterday at Sunken Diamond.
Number 13 for the No. 3-ranked Stan
ford Cardinal baseball team is worn by
senior third basemen Tim Griffin, who
blasted two grand slams to drive in eight
of the Cardinal's nine runs. The second
came with the score tied in the eighth
inning, and gave Stanford a 9-5 victory.

"Today they made some mistakes,"
said Griffin, whose torrid hitting has
given him the team lead in both home
runs (10) and RBIs (33). "If they make
those mistakes to anybody on our team,
they're going to pay."
However, it was Griffin who did all
the collecting yesterday for the Cardinal
(18-5), which managed just one other
extra base hit besides the pair of grand
slams. Three Stanford pitchers surren
dered eight hits and five earned runs
to the Broncos (11-10-1).
Senior right-hander Rob Kamerschen
came on in the seventh and retired eight
of the nine batters he faced to pick up
the win, his first decision this season.
With the victory, Kamerschen extended
his flawless Stanford career mark to 7-0.
"I felt good. It's important when you
haven't thrown in a while to make sure
to get in there and throw strikes in the
beginning," said Kamerschen, who had
been bothered by arm trouble last year.
John Reid got the call to start on the
mound for Stanford, and the junior
pitched relatively well until he tired in
the fifth. With the game tied 1-1, Reid
got one quick out and then gave up a
triple to DH Howie Kennedy and a walk
to Drew Miller.

Enter reliever Aaron Dorlarque, who
walked the next batter to load the bases.
A bouncer to short scored one run, and
Dorlarque got out of the inning with a
fly to center.
Stanford would not trail for long,
though. In the bottom of the inning,
freshman Jeff Hammonds singled with
one out to extend his hitting streak to
sixteen games. Troy Paulsen hit a line
shot to center, but Miller made a diving
catch and nearly doubled off Hammonds.
Hammonds promptly stole second base,
one of the two he swiped on the day to
give him 17 for the season.
David McCarty walked, and both run
ners advanced on a wild pitch. Santa
Clara pitcher David Currie then worked
carefully to Paul Carey, finally walking
him to load the bases.
Bronco Coach John Oldham next
made the most inexplicable move of the
day: he left the struggling Currie in the
game to face red-hot Griffin. Mr. One-
Three greeted that decision with ap
proval — he turned on Currie's first
pitch and drove it over the trees in left.
"It was a fastball, a little inside, which
is what I look for," Griffin said. "I don't
think that's where he wanted to put it."
Dorlarque did not have his best stuff,
however, and walked three more
Broncos in the next two innings. A three
run homer by senior Bill Enos in the
seventh tied the game and chased Dor
larque.
"His shoulder got a little tight," Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said. "We
may give him a couple days off."
Kamerschen then retired the side with
two strike-outs — he ended up with
three Ks in his two-plus innings. Mar
quess was full of praise for Kamerschen's
effort.
"He didn't pitch much in the fall
(because of the injury). He's a senior —
he's been there before. It's good to have
him back.
