They are treading on the turf
of legends.
In recording their 50th straight
dual-match victory yesterday, the
Stanford women's tennis team ex
tended the longest winning streak
in the sport's history.
The Cardinal is now one win
short of tying the Stanford record
for consecutive wins in any sport
set by Coach Dante Dettamanti's
water polo teams between 1985
and 1987. It is believed that John
Wooden's UCLA basketball teams
hold the NCAA record with 88
straight wins.
The unheralded Eagles of Bos
ton College flew into the Stanford
Tennis Stadium yesterday with a
chance to make history by stop
ping the Cardinal. They failed.
Among the regular Stanford
starters, only Debbie Graham and
Lisa Green played and both were
winners. Graham best Jennifer
Lane handily 6-0, 6-4. Green
downed Pam Piorkowski 6-4, 7-5.

"It was a good opportunity to
keep Debbie and Lisa in practice
and give everyone else (the non
starters) an opportunity to play,"
Asst. Coach Lele Forood said.
"Now we have two days to
prepare for the Arizonas who are
never quite as competitive here
as they are down at home."
In other action yesterday, Kylie
Johnson hammered Michelle
Chua 6-2, 6-1; Mario Carruth
bested Meg Wilson 6-2, 6-4;
Valerie Wilson crushed Regina
Fagan 6-2, 6-1; and Carina Rolley
handled Katie Sullivan 6-3, 6-3.
The Cardinal got a doubles
sweep as Green-Willens won 6-4,
7-6 (7-4) over Lane-Piorkowski;
Johnson-Carruth beat Chua-
Sullivan 6-2, 6-3; and Rolley and
Valerie Wilson blew out Fagan
and Meg Wilson 6-1, 6-2.
