### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
After spouting all season
about their March rush to the
NCAA Championships, the
Stanford men's swimming team
took an important step yester
day toward reaching that high
goal. The Cardinal dominated
the second day of the Pacific 10
Championships, stretching out
their lead over second-place
UCLA to 186 points.
At the Belmont Pool in Long
Beach, Stanford opened and
closed the evening with relay
victories in the process of rack
ing up 626 points, far ahead of
UCLA's 440 and USC's 405.
Cardinal swimmers won 5 of the
7 events, and four more Stan
ford racers, seniors Byron Bur
son and Sam Schwartz,
sophomore Josh Mikesell and
freshman J.J. Freitag, recorded

NCAA qualifying times.
The Cardinal relay teams fol

record in the 200 freestyle relay
by starting of Tuesday's finals
with a conference meet record
in the 200 medley relay.
Schwartz, sophomore Jeff Rouse

of the pre-meet ceremony in
which he was honored as the
Southern California Male Ath

individual first-places finishes
to four events by beating soph
omore Alex Kostich to the wall
in the 400 IM.

Finally, after nearly half of
the three-day meet was in the
books, Lillydahl ended the
drought and started a Cardinal
quick sprint for three individual
championships. Lillydahl cap
tured Stanford's first individual
title in the 100 butterfly with
a swim of 47.63.
Senior John Witchel followed
with a '200 freestyle victory, and
Rouse finished off the streak
with a championship swim in
the 100 backstroke.
Using the momentum of the
day's dominating performance,
the 800 freestyle relay team
pulled off an exciting finish in
the final event of the evening.
After Burson, sophomore Jason
Plummer and senior Lunn Les
