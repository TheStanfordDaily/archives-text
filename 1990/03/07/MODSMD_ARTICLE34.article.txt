# Paralysis doesn't ground gymnast
## 
### Pat Tower Staff writer 
In a split-second last autumn at the World Cham
pionships of gymnastics in Stuttgart, West Germany,
Adrianna Duffy's life changed.
The Stanford sophomore was practicing a
handspring-front vault, which she had performed
in every meet of the Cardinal's 1989 season, when
her hand slipped off the vaulting horse. Duffy was
left with a dislocated neck, paralyzing her from the
chest down.
"My first reaction was that I screamed a couple
times because I couldn't move my legs, but then I
told myself to be quiet. Screaming wasn't going to
help anything," Duffy recalled.
This reaction illustrates the type of attitude that
has allowed Duffy to go on with her life. After all,
while the accident dramatically changed her life,
there was no reason it had to end it.
"If people wanted to feel sorry for me, I would
tell them them they don't have to worry about me,
because I'm okay," Duffy said.
Duffy still has full use of her upper arms and,
thanks to emergency surgery and intense rehabilita
tion, has regained very limited movement in her
hands and some sensation below her chest. The one
thing which this accident could not take away, how
ever, is an incredible spirit.
"Her attitude has always been that if she has a
problem, she'll just say, 'that's the way it is,' and
find something else to be happy about," Shira
Wohlberg, a close friend and ex-Stanford teammate,
said.
Dina Amoroso, co-captain of the Stanford squad,
agreed. "That's the kind of person she is. She's just
a happy person, and she makes the best of a situ
ation."
Duffy offers an ther reason for her positive at
titude: "It doesn't do me any good to have a bad
attitude. I am using too much energy on other
things," including rehabilitation and preparations
for her return to Stanford spring quarter.
Her friends and family have also been a great
boost to her.
"I want people to know that everyone at Stanford
has been great," she said, adding that her mother,

who has been with her since the accident, has been
her biggest influence during her recovery.
Whatever the reason for her attitude, it is notice
able to anyone who has visited her in southern
California that she is ready to go on with her life.
"When you talk to her, you leave feeling pretty
good because of her," Stanford coach Breck Green
wood said.
"I was with her for three hours, and I felt so
much better when I left," Amoroso added.
Part of this is due to the fact that people are
expecting to see the worst when they go to see her.
Because the accident happened in Europe, specific
information was hard to get, so people drew false
conclusions about her condition.
"Their first reaction is that I look better than
what they expected," Duffy explained."
She is looking forward to returning to Stanford
next quarter to continue her studies, most likely
in Philosophy.
She will be living in Mirrielees with her mother
and later a trained assistant, and having her mother
for a roommate will be just one of the many ad
justments she will have to make.
"It will be different having my afternoons free,"
she said. "Between ballet lessons and gymnastics,
my afternoons have been full since I was five." In
addition, she explained, "I'll have to learn campus
all over again" to learn new routes for her wheel
chair.
While the most obvious limitation she has is
restriction to a wheelchair, she explains, "not being
able to walk is the least of my problems. There are
so many other things people take for granted — it
takes me a half-hour to put my pants on in the
morning."
The accident has not dampened her love for the
sport of gymnastics. She was excited to receive a
tape of the World Championships during her
recovery, and she attended the Cardinal's meet at
Cal State-Fullerton over the weekend.
When the Stanford gymnasts visited with her
after the meet, she told them with a smile, "You
looked good on vault, but I would have loved to do
a handspring-front for you guys."
