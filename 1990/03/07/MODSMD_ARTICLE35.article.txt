# Card spikers looking for revenge
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
It's show time.
All the scores may be settled
tonight as the No. 1 Stanford
men's volleyball team today
travels to Pauley Pavilion to chal
lenge No. 4 UCLA (13-2) in a
rematch of last year's NCAA
championship final and what

many believe will be a precursor
to this year's version.
The conditions for this much
anticipated rematch attach a tre
mendous significance to the out
come. The Cardinal (7-1, 7-0 in
WIVA) is riding a seven game vic
tory streak into the City of An
gels. In fact, taking the entire
1989-90 school year into consid
eration, including nine exhibition
matches, seven two-out-of-three
matches, and two non-NCAA
matches in addition to the eight
official matches, Stanford is 25-1
on the year. That one blemish is
UCLA.
The Bruins came from behind
in the finals of the UCSB-
Michelob Light Invitational to
claim the tournament champion
ship and temporarily seize the na
tion's top ranking.
Stanford can take comfort in
having defeated two of the three
teams to whom defending cham
pion UCLA has lost this season.
Last week, Stanford edged out a
last-point victory over the Long
Beach State 49eis who had just
undone the Bruins at home. In
their first home match of the
season, the Cardinal dispensed of
Cal State-Northridge, who prior
to that contest had stunned UCLA

at the UCSB Invitational.
The Cardinal can additionally
cite a five-game exhibition win
over the Bruins late last year as
proof that the team is more than
capable of handling UCLA.
Because their prior competition
was in a non-conference tourna
ment, this will be the first official
conference meeting of the two
teams and will affect their stand
ings in the respective divisions.
This fact looms large for Stanford,
which is being frenetically chased
by No. 2 USC in the Harry Wilson
division. The Trojans (9-1, 6-1 in
WIVA) recently downed UCLA at
Pauley, and will be visiting
Burnham Pavilion this Saturday
in perhaps the most significant
home match of the year.
All-American middle blocker
Dan Hanan continues to hoist the
team on his shoulders as he leads
the squad in kills (130) and blocks
(44), and is second in both hitting
percentage (.430) and digs (51)
despite not having played in the
last match due to illness.
As a team, Stanford is scorching
the offensive hardwood. The Car
dinal is hitting a torrid .302 as a
team and has registered 580 kills
on the season.
