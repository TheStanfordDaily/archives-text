Obtaining a perfect record in
collegiate sports is difficult. Main
taining it is next to impossible.
But that's exactly what the
Stanford men's tennis team will
attempt to do this week as it puts
its 8-0 record and No. 1 national
ranking on the line against San
Jose State today and West Vir
ginia tomorrow.
San Jose State comes into
today's match much improved
from ths last time it met Stanford,
Feb. 6. In that match, the Cardi
nal whipped the Spartans 7-1 at
San Jose State.
"San Jose State is a much better
team than we played last time,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"They still will have two excellent
players in Mike Chinchiolo and
Brian Eagle, and they have added
some depth to the bottom of their
lineup."

Chinchiolo and Eagle both have
given the Cardinal problems in
the past. Chinchiolo downed
standout freshman Jared Palmer
at the NorCal Intercollegiate Ten
nis Championships last month, 6-
3, 6-1. Eagle, a freshman, provided
San Jose State with its only win
Feb. 6 as he upset Jeff Cathrall
at No. 2 singles.
But Chinchiolo, Eagle and the
rest of the Spartan team will meet
a Cardinal squad riding high after
its win at the National Team In
door Championships Feb. 25.
"We have made a solid state
ment as to where we think we
should be so far," Gould said.
"Now we are hoping to end out
the winter portion of our season
with two upbeat matches."
Gould added that the "final
push" of the season will not come
until after spring break as the
team heads into the NCAA cham
pionships.

Up to this point, Stanford has
compiled some truly impressive
individual records, according to
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger.
Sophomore Alex O'Brien, who
presently has a 12-match winning
streak, comes into the week with
a 23-3 record.
