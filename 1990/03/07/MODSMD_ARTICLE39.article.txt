Rain or shine, the North Se
ries continues.
At their last home regatta for
this year, the Stanford varsity
sailing team showed their
prowess in a variety of condi
tions. The team won Saturday's
North Series No. 4, a team
racing event, and placed second
to California in Sunday's North
Series No. 5, a regular fleet race.
Stanford entered two teams
in Saturday's event, which was
attended by eight schools. The
Stanford A team, which con
sisted of skipper Robert Brown
and crew Susannah Mapes,
skipper Scott Dale and crew
Julia Novy and skipper Rick
Rosen and crew Rebecca Bryson
placed first in an undefeated 8-0
round robin competition.

The USC team tied with the
Stanford B team, which con
sisted of skipper Dave Dowd and
crew Lydia Snape, skipper Matt
Sanford and crew Deborah
Claymon, skipper Brady Sih and
crew Matt Dunbar and skipper
A 1 Sargent and crew Andrea
Guerrero for second place with
a 6-2 record each. USC broke
the tie by beating Stanford B
in head-to-head competition.
According to Sanford, the
seven-knot wind and clear skies
were "perfect team racing con
ditions." He added that "things
are looking good," since the
team beat all the teams it will
come up against in the spring
to qualify for Nationals.
Sunday's torrid rains didn't
stop the Stanford team's efforts
as they placed second out of the
10 teams present. The regatta
was won bv Berkeley, but two

Stanford boats held top-five
spots in the 27-boat fleet. The
combinations of Dowd and
Snape with Rosen and Bryson
placed second overall, and Sih
and Dunbar with Sargent and
Tracy Turner placing fifth.
Divisional results include a
second place by Dowd and Snape
in A-division, as well as a fourth
by Sanford and Claymon. In B
division, Rosen and Bryson
placed third, Sih and Dunbar
placed fifth, and Peter Somers
with crews Jon Schreiber and
Midge Ette placed sixth.
Last weekend's performance
puts Stanford in first place in
the North Series thus far, with
Berkeley trailing a point behind
them. The next North Series
will be March 24-25 in San
Francisco. The team will be
traveling to Los Angeles next
weekend.
