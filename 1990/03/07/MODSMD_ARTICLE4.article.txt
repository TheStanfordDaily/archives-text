# A 						whole lotta hot air
## Senate OKs COP censure, approves 3 items for ballot 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
In a marathon four-hour meet
ing last night, the ASSU Senate
heated up over a bill calling for
sanctions against the Council of
Presidents after campaign viola
tions last weekend.
The senate also passed three
constitutional amendments call
ing for reforms of special
fee assessments, which have come
under heavy fire in recent weeks.
The amendments will be placed
on the spring ballot for a general
student vote.
The COP sanctions bill asked
the senate to uphold the ruling
of Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss and urged candidates and
slates to resolve election contro
versies through channels created
by the ASSU Constitution.

Students First party supporters
were enraged last week when the
COP distributed ASSU Resource
Guides that Krauss later ruled to
be in violation of the election rules
because they were considered to
be campaign material. Another
violation resulted when an ASSU
dorm representive, apparently
oblivious to the first violation
warning, passed out additional
resource guides.
Senator Kevin Warsh authored
a bill calling for harsh sanctions
against the People's Platform for
the errors.
Much of the controversy over
the bill revolved around the man
ner in which it was drafted and
subsequently treated by the sen
ate. The bill finally passed by the
senate was completely different
from the bill first presented to it.
The original bill was written

Monday night during a three-hour
committee meeting that often
broke down into a shouting match,
according to Warsh.
Warsh's original bill demanded
that a financial disclosure be
issued by the COP detailing the
expenses incurred in printing the
pamphlet, and it also asked that
the People's Platform bear the
costs of producing the pamphlet.
Yesterday, after the bill was
finished, Senate Chair Ed Sasaki
asked that another bill be written
because Krauss' ruling was not
accurately represented at the com
mittee meeting.
Senator Solina Kwan then
drafted another document, which
became the bill finally passed by
the senate, and proposed that it
replace the entirety of Warsh's
bill.
But Warsh and other support
ers of his bill objected to the sub
stitution bill, saying that none of
Krauss' statements was misrepre
sented in the meeting.
The senate passed the bill with
Kwan's amendment in a 11-4 roll
call vote with two abstentions.
The first of the three constitu
tional amendments proposes that
groups seeking to be placed on
the special fee ballot not be re
quired to collect signatures, pro
vided that the group received sup
port from 50 percent of the stu
dent body in the previous election
and that the new budget is no
different from the old by a factor
of inflation plus 10 percent. The
amendment passed in a divided
hand vote.
The second amendment
eliminates fee refunds and
reduces special fees by 25 percent,
while allowing conscientious ob
jectors to reallocate their fee
refunds either to the discretion

ary fund or to the program board.
The third amendment indexes
general fees to inflation. Cur
rently, students vote to increase,
maintain or decrease general fees
in each election. In recent years,
the senate has been forced to call
upon emergency reserves because
students have not voted increases
in fees.
In other senate actions:
• The COP presented five sep
arate bills. The first and second
were bylaws establishing student
involvement committees and in
stitutionalizing ASSU dorm rep
resentatives. The purpose of the
bills is to encourage more active
student involvement in the ASSU.
The third and fourth bills asked

that the ASSU take action against
rape on campus and pledged $500
to support a dorm-based self
defense class.
The fifth bill called for the sen
ate to include a referendum on
the spring ballot supporting an
ethnic studies distribution re
quirement and a rape education
seminar.
• A separate bill asked that the
senate support the struggles of
the Webb Ranch workers by ask
ing that University President
Donald Kennedy make the
renewal of the the ranch's lease
contingent upon the Webbs not
evicting workers and their
families.
