## Senate OKs COP censure, approves 3 items for ballot 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
In a marathon four-hour meet
ing last night, the ASSU Senate
heated up over a bill calling for
sanctions against the Council of
Presidents after campaign viola
tions last weekend.
The senate also passed three
constitutional amendments call
ing for reforms of special
fee assessments, which have come
under heavy fire in recent weeks.
The amendments will be placed
on the spring ballot for a general
student vote.
The COP sanctions bill asked
the senate to uphold the ruling
of Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss and urged candidates and
slates to resolve election contro
versies through channels created
by the ASSU Constitution.

Students First party supporters
were enraged last week when the
COP distributed ASSU Resource
Guides that Krauss later ruled to
be in violation of the election rules
because they were considered to
be campaign material. Another
violation resulted when an ASSU
dorm representive, apparently
oblivious to the first violation
warning, passed out additional
resource guides.
Senator Kevin Warsh authored
a bill calling for harsh sanctions
against the People's Platform for
the errors.
Much of the controversy over
the bill revolved around the man
ner in which it was drafted and
subsequently treated by the sen
ate. The bill finally passed by the
senate was completely different
from the bill first presented to it.
The original bill was written

Monday night during a three-hour
committee meeting that often
broke down into a shouting match,
according to Warsh.
Warsh's original bill demanded
that a financial disclosure be
issued by the COP detailing the
expenses incurred in printing the
pamphlet, and it also asked that
the People's Platform bear the
costs of producing the pamphlet.
Yesterday, after the bill was
finished, Senate Chair Ed Sasaki
asked that another bill be written
because Krauss' ruling was not
accurately represented at the com
mittee meeting.
Senator Solina Kwan then
drafted another document, which
became the bill finally passed by
the senate, and proposed that it
replace the entirety of Warsh's
