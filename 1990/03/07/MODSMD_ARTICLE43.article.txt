# Students, faculty rally for Webb workers
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Amid strains of Chicano bal
lads, more than 400 people in
White Plaza heard speakers la
ment Webb Ranch working condi
tions at a rally yesterday.
The 18 speakers, including stu
dents, faculty, labor representa
tives and ranch workers, urged
the Stanford community to "con
tinue the fight" for a fair contract
for the workers and to pressure
the University to accept respon
sibility for the workers' welfare.
"I thank my father who taught
me how to till the earth so that
my work could produce something
all God's children could eat. I feel
proud of the work I do," said
ranch worker Agustin Gonzales.
"But we also want to be treated
like human beings, not like savage
animals."
Gonzalez, who has worked at
the ranch for 20 years, shares a
50-foot by 20-foot trailer on the
ranch with his wife and five
children.
Reading a list of the workers'
demands, Gonzales' nephew Jose
Luis Gonzalez said, "We want bet
ter housing, better treatment and
just wages like other California
farm workers."
Debbie Britt, vice president of
the United Stanford Workers,
pledged the union's support and
said the USW "will not stand by
and allow the workers to be
abused and taken advantage of'
without exhausting all available
resources.
The union, said USW lawyer
Jim Eggleston, will not waver
from its "one simple demand.

There needs to be safe, decent
housing for the workers."
A statement by Law Prof.
Miguel Mendez, read by Political
Science Prof. John Manley,
likened a tour of Webb Ranch to
"a travel back in time."
Mendez noted that in the past
Stanford students have believed
the University should not support
companies whose South African

operations "deny workers equality
and dignity." Referring to the
plight of Webb Ranch workers, he
added that the University should
not "tolerate at home what it con
demns abroad."
Manley asked students to "keep
the pressure on" and urged them
to attend a candlelight vigil before
the Faculty Senate meeting to
morrow. At the meeting, faculty

will debate the Webb Ranch issue
and consider issuing a resolution.
"After so many years of silence
. . . living in fear, having no union
to represent them, and having
their previous illegal immigrant
status to quiet them, they are now
boldly speaking," said sophomore
Celina Martinez, a member of the
Student Coalition in Support of
Webb Workers.
