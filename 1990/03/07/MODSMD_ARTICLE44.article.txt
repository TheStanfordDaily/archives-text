# Gov't may limit access to on-line information
## Services at Jonsson Library threatened

Services provided by Stan
ford's Jonsson Government
Documents Library and similar
libraries nationwide which pro
vide free access to government
information could be threat
ened by a bill under consider
ation in the House of Repre
sentatives.
The Government Printing
Office Improvement Act of
1990 would eliminate free
access to government informa
tion stored on-line in comput
ers. The Committee on House
Administration has scheduled
hearings on the bill today and
tomorrow.
According to Win-Shin
Chiang, chief librarian at the
Jonsson Library, the bill would
skirt an 1896 law which re
quires the federal government
to make all publications avail
able to the public free of charge
through government depositor
ies such as the Jonsson Libra
ry.
If passed, the bill would still
require the government to pro
vide tangible information such
as pamphlets and books to de
positories free of charge, but
would allow the government to
charge for computer-accessible
on-line information.
The bill would undoubtedly

limit the Jonsson Library's
ability to provide government
documents and information at
little or no cost to students,
Chiang said.
"The government is respon
sible for providing information
to the people" and, in order to
remain free, "a democratic so
ciety must publish documents,"
Chiang said.
If enacted, the bill will
"severely limit public access to
government information and
thus abrogate the most basic
principles of the depository
program," she added.
The bill, sponsored by U.S.
Rep. Jim Bates, D-San Diego,
arose as a bureaucratic re
sponse to demands imposed by
changing technology. Other
provisions would allow the ex
clusion of electronic govern
ment information from the def
inition of 'government publica
tion' and the removal of
electronic government informa
tion from the publishing activ
ities of the Government
Printing Office.
In recent years, the trend of
reducing information to
electronic data only accessible
through on-line computer sys
tems has steadily grown to
replace the antiquated method
of placing words on paper.
