# Nurses, hospital at impasse as strike looms
## 
### Lena Slachmuijlder Staff writer 
No progress was made in negotiations be
tween the nurses' union and the administra
tion of Stanford Hospital yesterday, despite
Monday's union vote overwhelmingly in favor
of a strike.
Union spokesperson Donalda Dunnett said
she was "real pessimistic" about the possibility
of reaching an agreement before the strike
deadline next Monday. The nurses decided to
strike primarily in opposition to a two-tiered
wage system in which more experienced nurses
get lower wage increases than less experienced
nurses.
As the prospect of a nurses' strike by the
1,400 union members loomed, the hospital
began restricting admissions yesterday morn
ing and looking into opportunities for patient
transfers. Only critically ill non-transferrable
patients will be admitted, through a screening
process in the Emergency Department.
"We have a responsibility to provide quality
care for the patients we have, and we will
utilize every means we can to do that," said
Stanford Hospital staff counsel and chief ne
gotiator Priscilla Wheeler.
Wheeler said that in addition to the above

measures, the hospital will be
ready to hire anyone who is
certified as a nurse and is will
ing to care for the remaining
patients in the hospital.
A new proposal "with sig
nificant economic adjust
ments" was introduced
yesterday by the hospital but
was met with no response
from the union, according to

Wheeler.
Stanford's proposal, the most recent of three
initiatives, provides in the first year a 5 per
cent wage increase for the most experienced
nurses, a 10 percent wage increase for the
newest nurses and varying percentage in
creases for levels of nurses in between. There
would be an across-the-board 5 percent wage
increase the second year.
Striving to be more competitive for entry
and mid-level nursing positions, the hospital
wants to raise lower-level salaries more the
first year, then raise all nurses' wages equally
the second year, Wheeler explained. Senior
nurses already receive leading salaries com
pared to other Bay Area hospitals, according
to Wheeler.
The nurses' union, the Committee for

Recognition of Nursing Achievement, has
demanded that wages be increased uniformly,
10 percent the first year and 9 percent the
second. Union spokesperson Dunnett said that
with uneven percentage wage increases, the
wage spectrum will narrow, creating resent
ment among more experienced nurses.
"It has been shown that compressed nurses
salaries are not a good retention tool," she
said.
Non-economic concerns appear to be stag
nating on the mediation table. The union has
demanded that a mechanism be introduced
through which nurses could file written com
plaints about procedures they feel compromise
patients' safety.
However, Wheeler said that such a mecha
nism already exists through "joint committee
conferences" between nurses and nursing
managers on a regular basis, and that the
union's proposal is "cumbersome and not
operational."
Dunnett said that without a form that a
nurse can file in protest of an assignment,
"the procedure doesn't really make the hospi
tal accountable."
The union is also concerned about gradual
replacement of nursing positions with tech
nicians and nursing assistants.
