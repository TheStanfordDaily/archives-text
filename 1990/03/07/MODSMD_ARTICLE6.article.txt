# Into the Lyons den
## Robinson to head Student Affairs during search for a replacement 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
After 17 years as dean of
Student Affairs, James Lyons
will be passing the torch to As
soc. Dean Norm Robinson â€”
at least for the next year.
Robinson will become the
acting dean of Student Affairs
following Commencement on
June 17 and will hold the po
sition for one year, until a per
manent replacement for Lyons
is found.
The search for the replace
ment will be slow in coming,
however. The office structure
and the job itself are currently
being changed by the Univer
sity's Action Plans for Change
committee, and the search for

a new dean will not begin until
this redefinition is finalized.
"We don't even know what
the job will be yet," Robinson
said. "Right now I'm just
trying to plan what 1 need to
do for tomorrow."
When Lyons leaves this
June, the reorganization of the
office, its leadership and its op
erating budget will be the pri
mary matters Robinson will
need to address.
"I hope to contribute some
stability in a time of uncer
tainty for this office," Robinson
said.
Robinson brings "just the
kind of experience and good
judgment that will be netted
during this transition," Lyons
said.
