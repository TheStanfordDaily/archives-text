# Report absolves Dekes of guilt
## University: Fraternity not at fault in alleged sexual assault 
### Janine De Fao Editorial staff 
In a report released yesterday,
the University absolved the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity
of any responsibility for an al
leged sexual assault at its house.
The report states that the fra
ternity complied with Residen
tial Education and Interfrater
nity Council party policies at its
Oct. 6 party. The report made
several recommendations to the
fraternity to prevent another
possible incident in the future.
Deke president Armando
Cano said that fraternal affairs
adviser Michael Hughes in
formed the fraternity that its
social probation was ended as
of yesterday. Hughes could not
be reached for comment.
The University and police re
ceived a letter Nov. 1 alleging
that a sexual assault of a 13-
year-old girl had taken place in
a second-floor bathroom at the
Deke house during the party.
The alleged victim, whom
police located in December, said
she was forcibly "grabbed,
kissed and fondled" by a white
male in the bathroom during
the party. Police were able to
identify the alleged assailant
with a description given by the
girl and the assistance of a fra
ternity member who recognized
the description.
John Franco, an 18-year-old
student at the California
Polytechnic State University in
San Luis Obispo, was arrested
in January on felony charges of
unlawful sexual conduct with a
minor under the age of 14.

Franco was scheduled to issue
a plea last week in Santa Clara
County Superior Court in Palo
Alto, but the plea was res
cheduled for April due to other
commitments of Franco's attor
ney. Neither Franco nor the at
torney accompanying him in
court would comment last week
on the case.
The University report, writ
ten by Michael Jackson, associ
ate dean for campus affairs,
states that Franco was invited
to the party by a guest of a
fraternity member.
The report is based on inter
views with 27 members of the
house concerning the planning
of the party and the events that
occurred that night and after
ward. Jill Salak, who attended
the party and first reported
talking to the girl, was also in
terviewed.
Jackson found that "frater
nity members took resonable
steps, based upon their own ex
perience, University, Residential
Education and Inter fraternity
Council policies, and guidelines
and common party preparations
and customs at Stanford," the
report states.
Both Residential Education
and the IFC have policies
stating that Stanford IDs must
be checked to keep high school
students out of parties.
Prior to the party, however,
the Dekes made an agreement
with the band that they be al
lowed to invite friends and place
their names on a guest list and
also "vouch for friends who
came to the door on the evening
of the party and indicate that

they were invited by members
of the band," according to the
report.
Although such exceptions are
not explicitly stated in Univer
sity or IFC policies, Jackson said
in an interview yesterday that
allowing admittance to friends
of band members is a general
campus practice.
According to the report, all
guests were screened at the en
trance to the party, and those
who did not have Stanford ID,
were not on the guest list or
were not vouched for by a fra
ternity member were turned
away.
"This process also, however,
resulted in the admittance of a
13-year-old girl because it is
believed that her name was put
on the list by the band," the
report states. The guest list was
discarded after the party.
The report includes a recom
mendation that non-Stanford
party guests show proof of age
and not be admitted unless they
are at least 18 years old, a
restriction on band members
and their guests bringing alco
hol to parties, and a suggestion
that groups hosting parties limit
the number of guests.
It also recommends that party
hosts restrict the number of
guests band members can invite
and that all parties prominently
display signs informing guests
of University and house policies
regarding the use of alcohol and
other appropriate behavioral ex
pectations.
Jackson said he would like
feedback from students concern
ing these recommendations.
