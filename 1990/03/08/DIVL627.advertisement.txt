THE HIGH NOON, HIGH TECH,
EASY LISTENING LECTURE SERIES
"THE PHENOMENA OF TURBULENCE"
What Does The Coffee In Your Cup Have In Common With The
Stars In The Galaxy?
Professor Peter Bradshaw
Thomas V. Jones Professor of Engineering
Mechanical Engineering Department
Turbulence is the most complicated, most common and most
important kind of fluid motion. The wild eddies and tangles of
turbulence can be seen in a coffee cup, in the atmosphere and the
ocean - possibly in the galaxy - and in most fluid Hows of
engineering importance. In this popular talk, which will include
exciting demonstrations, Professor Bradshaw will review current
turbulence research at Stanford and elsewhere.
