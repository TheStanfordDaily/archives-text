# Centennial Campaign nears goal, but key areas lag
##

Editor's note: This is the first of a two-part
series examining the University's billion
dollar Centennial Campaign.

While Stanford's Centennial Campaign is
well on the way to achieving its $l.l billion
fund-raising goal by 1992, contributions for
various pet projects remain sluggish and
fund-raisers in the Office of Development
face several obstacles in completing their
task.
The campaign is the most ambitious
money-raising effort of any university in
the United States.
Since the effort was launched three years
ago, Stanford has amassed $874 million
79 percent of the goal and is about six

months ahead of schedule, officials in the
development office say.
However, featured objectives mainly
improvements in undergraduate education,
endowed professorships, the Near West
Campus and $4O million in earthquake
recovery lag behind schedule.
Near West, a complex of new science and
engineering buildings to replace the old wood
and cinder block laboratories behind the
Physics Building, has gained only $80.7 mil
lion, 58 percent of its targeted $l4O million.
Endowment for professorships in the
School of Humanities and Sciences is also
suffering a drought. To date, money for only
14 of a proposed 40 Humanities and Sciences
chairs has been raised, compared to 46 of
60 chairs that have been secured in other
schools.
In addition, plans for a renovation of
Meyer Library have been stalled and com

pletion dates for some Near West buildings
extended, in part because some of the pro
posed funding for these projects has been
siphoned off for repair of the estimated $l4O
million in damage caused by the Oct. 17
earthquake.
While development officers point out that
the perceived need for all objectives may
not be met by the campaign's completion
in February 1992, they recognize the im
portance of injecting life into those goals
that are falling behind.
The main reason for directing attention
toward these objectives is to preserve the
balance of excellence among the various
schools within the University, according to
John Wirth, vice provost for academic plan
ning and development.
