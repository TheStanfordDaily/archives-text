# Centennial Campaign nears goal, but key areas lag
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first of a two-part
series examining the University's billion
dollar Centennial Campaign.

While Stanford's Centennial Campaign is
well on the way to achieving its $l.l billion
fund-raising goal by 1992, contributions for
various pet projects remain sluggish and
fund-raisers in the Office of Development
face several obstacles in completing their
task.
The campaign is the most ambitious
money-raising effort of any university in
the United States.
Since the effort was launched three years
ago, Stanford has amassed $874 million
79 percent of the goal and is about six

months ahead of schedule, officials in the
development office say.
However, featured objectives mainly
improvements in undergraduate education,
endowed professorships, the Near West
Campus and $4O million in earthquake
recovery lag behind schedule.
Near West, a complex of new science and
engineering buildings to replace the old wood
and cinder block laboratories behind the
Physics Building, has gained only $80.7 mil
lion, 58 percent of its targeted $l4O million.
Endowment for professorships in the
School of Humanities and Sciences is also
suffering a drought. To date, money for only
14 of a proposed 40 Humanities and Sciences
chairs has been raised, compared to 46 of
60 chairs that have been secured in other
schools.
In addition, plans for a renovation of
Meyer Library have been stalled and com

pletion dates for some Near West buildings
extended, in part because some of the pro
posed funding for these projects has been
siphoned off for repair of the estimated $l4O
million in damage caused by the Oct. 17
earthquake.
While development officers point out that
the perceived need for all objectives may
not be met by the campaign's completion
in February 1992, they recognize the im
portance of injecting life into those goals
that are falling behind.
The main reason for directing attention
toward these objectives is to preserve the
balance of excellence among the various
schools within the University, according to
John Wirth, vice provost for academic plan
ning and development.
"We have a strategic vision of keeping

things balanced," he said. "We
want to keep the whole place
rising, but at the same time we
want to keep things balanced. We
want the central teaching core to
be healthy."
Wirth said professorships in
Humanities and Sciences are
more difficult to fund than their
counterparts in professional
schools such as the Graduate
School of Business and School of
Medicine primarily because many
donors "have a utilitiarian view,"
he said. They are more inclined
to support schools that can offer
immediate end products, he said.
David Fulton, deputy to the vice
president in Office of Develop
ment, added that alumni from the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences form less of a "unified con
stituency" than graduating
engineers or business students
and are less likely to pool re
sources to endow chairs.
Yet raising funds for professor
ships can often be easier than
reusing funds for buildings be
cause it takes donors less money
to get their name on an endowed
professorship than on the front
of a new building.
Even donations in the millions
do not assure a contributor's
name in front of a building, as
the largest donor usually wins the
honor. Few individuals or organ
izations have the means of donat
ing the majority share of building
some of which can run near
$4O million and are therefore
hesistant to direct their resources
this way.
Building cutbacks
The Oct. 17 earthquake also
shook up the fund-raising efforts
for new structures. The $4O mil
lion for earthquake relief was in
cluded in the campaign by
reducing the objectives for the
Near West campus.
However, plans for the new en
gineering and science buildings
were already being stretched out
prior to Oct. 17, mainly because
of the complex's financial impact

on the University budget, which
is currently facing serious strains.
Added to the cost of construct
ing new buildings are the operat
ing expenses of maintaining the
site after completion and the ser
vicing of the debt used to finance
them, according to Richard Ben
nett, associate director of the Cen
tennial Campaign.
Simultaneous construction of a
large number of buildings the
Near West campus calls for six
major new ones could place
huge and immediate pressure on
University resources, so planners
are putting the brakes on ambi
tious building projects, Bennett
explained.
Bennett also said fund-raising
objectives for buildings are often
inflated to six times the true
amount of funding needed, so
Near West's sluggish performance
is not necessarily a sign that the
project is in jeopardy.
But according to Wirth, fund
raisers need to exercise caution
when requesting earthquake relief
money for fear of directing many
potential contributions away from
other Centennial Campaign objec
tives.
"It's a tricky business," Wirth
said. "We have to be careful not
to have enthusiasm for the cam
paign change to earthquake
relief."
Wirth said the University's
strategy has been to be upfront
with donors about the extent of
the damage rather than letting
misconceptions skew alumni per
ceptions of University's needs.
The earthquake has, in fact,
opened up "a whole new fund
raising opportunity for us," Wirth
said.
The influence of image
Although earthquake coverage
did not harm fund-raising efforts,
unfavorable press on other issues
can often discourage potential do
nors. Likewise, favorable press
can often boost the campaign.
When then-U.S. Secretary of
Education William Bennett spoke
at Stanford in 1988 about the Uni
versity's "trashing of Western cul
ture" in the heat of the Area One
debate, "you can't believe the fuss
we got from uninformed alumni"

who read about Bennett's re
marks, said Stanford campaign of
ficer Bennett.
Though careful explanation to
alumni of the issues surrounding
Cultures, Ideas and Values as
suaged much alumni consterna
tion, Bennett still acknowledged
that "the impression of Stanford
from the press is very important"
in fund raising.
Wirth said the press can often
come to Stanford's advantage.
Though the University has often
been vilified in the press, donors
increasingly perceive Stanford as
a leader in many fields, and they
want to participate alongside,
Wirth said.
"People take a tremendous
pride in leadership," he said. "The
pride and commitment in this
place is really awesome."
Several magazines periodically
offer rankings of American uni
versities, and various schools
within Stanford have often re
ceived favorable reviews. This
publicity stimulates not only their
own fund-raising efforts, but ex
cites a general eagerness for dona
tions to other parts of the
Universtiy, Bennett said.
"Having a school ranked num
ber one helps other schools," he
said. "People like winners."
However, there does not seem
to be a trickle-down effect from
winning athletic teams. In 1971,
the University, motivated by back
to-back Rose Bowl victories in
1970 and 1971, commissioned a
study to determine whether a big
winning percentage on the field
contributes to big donor checks.
The report not only found little
difference in donations to the De
partment of Athletics but practi
cally no unexpected change in
donations to the various academic
divisions, according to Bennett.
Needless to say, major donors
to the Athletics Department lately
have caught the spirit of the Cen
tennial Campaign, Fulton said,
and have supported other parts
of the University generously.
Increasing competition
Competition among various de
partments for funds is minimal
donors that offer restricted
contributions are usually clear on

their goals even though a def
inite bias exists for the Business
School, Medical School and Engi
neering School. However, an even
more fierce competitor is looming
on the horizon, bearing the name
of "publics," or public schools.
Facing decreasing financial sup
port from state legislatures,
several public universities
notably California state schools
have intensified efforts to obtain
donations from private con
tributors.
While competition currently has
not reached "cutthroat" level, ac
cording to Wirth, "it is something
we're careful about."
Because only about one-fourth
of total donations usually comes
from alumni, universities do not
hold a captive audience of fund
raising prospects. According to
Bennett, Stanford relies evenly
among alumni, corporations,
foundations and non-alumni in
fund raising, and the latter three
rarely are obligated to a particular
school.
The successful fund-raising ef
forts of many public schools
particularly UC-Berkeley, the
University of Michigan and
several of the California state
schools and junior colleges rep
resents an ominous threat to the
existence of private schools and
the "diversity" that private
schools offer, Wirth said. These
universities rely solely on private
donations and federal government
support.
Cooperative efforts
Not all fund-raising efforts
among schools are competitive,
though. Stanford shares many of
its successful and failed ideas,
both formally and informally,
with other schools, particularly
MIT and those in the Ivy League,
Fulton said.
Ideas are swapped formally
through a professional organiza
tion of university development of

* ficers known as the Council for
Advancement and Support of Ed
ucation, which meets once a year.
Informal gatherings among de
velopment officers are com
monplace, too, according to Brodie-
Remington, campaign director at
the University of Pennsylvania.
"We don't consciously or explicitly
compare notes," Remington said.
In a few cases, the University
has difficulty raising money be
cause a match cannot be found
between the University's needs
and a potential fund raiser's choice
on how to spend the money. But
such impasses are so rare that
Charles Sizemore, development
officer of the School of Business,
has turned down one donation in
ten years of fund raising at Yale
University and Stanford.
Mismatches are usually re
solved by offering a finicky funder
several alternative options for
making a contribution and some
times referring donors to another
department or school.
Usually, because the process of
identifying prospective larger do
nors is a long one that develops
over a period of years, University
development officers generally are
very certain of each major donor's
goals and expend a large effort
researching areas where a
mutually beneficial arrangement
can be made.
"Fund raising is such a won
derful profession," said Bennett,
"because people want to give."

An article in yesterday's Daily
incorrectly reported that ASSU
Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss ruled that ASSU Resource
Guides issued by the current
People's Platform Council of
Presidents were campaign mate
rial.
Krauss ruled that the pam
phlets were not campaign mate
rial, but that they could be banned
because they could influence the
outcome of the spring election.

Fund raising by
public universities
is a growing threat.

Tomorrow: Where will your
money go after graduation ? Prob
ably still to Stanford if you're
rich enough.

For the record
