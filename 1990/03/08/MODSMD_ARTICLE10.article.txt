Labor extends ultimatum
JERUSALEM (AP) - Ministers of the left
leaning Labor Party yesterday extended an
ultimatum for quitting the coalition govern
ment, giving Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
Likud bloc four more days to approve U.S.
peace proposals.
Labor ministers announced the decision
after Israel's Inner Cabinet failed to reach a
decision on the U.S. proposals in a two-hour
meeting and postponed a vote on the issue
until Sunday.
If the proposals by U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker 111 are not approved at the
second meeting, Labor's Central Committee
will meet Monday with a recommendation that
the party quit, toppling the 15-month-old gov
ernment, Labor officials said.
Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of Labor pre
dicted Shamir's Cabinet would fall, saying: "I
don't think there is any possibility of getting
Likud to change their minds. If the answer
in negative from Likud, then this government
has no continuation."
Coup leader defects
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) â€” The former
Afghan defense minister who led a coup at
tempt against the government defected yes
terday to the Moslem insurgents he fought
for more than a decade, guerrilla and Pakistani
government sources said.
Gen. Shah Nawaz Tanai fled Afghanistan
on yesterday with his wife, two daughters and
son, then returned with the guerrillas, accord
ing to the sources.
The situation in Afghanistan was unclear.
President Najib again claimed that the coup
Tanai launched Tuesday had "absolutely been
broken. Of that there is no doubt." Tanai's
flight seemed to indicate this.
But Western diplomats and guerrilla leaders
based in Pakistan said fighting continued, al
though on a smaller scale.
Secession to be decided
MOSCOW (AP) - Lithuania's parliament will
meet this weekend to declare independence
from the Soviet Union, activists in the Baltic
republic said yesterday.
Sweeping victories in recent elections have
given backers of Sajudis, the pro-independence
popular movement, dominance in the Lit
huanian parliament, and Sajudis leaders have
decided to force the issue of secession, activist
Audris Siaurusavicius said.
Pro-secession sentiment in Lithuania has
been swelling for months, but Sajudis decided
to move now to pre-empt President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's plans for a vastly more powerful
presidency with the right to crack down on
restive republics. The national Congress is to
meet Monday to consider the presidency pro
posal.
Rebels ignore proferred reforms
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - Secessionist rebels
in Ethiopia's northernmost province of Eritrea
are rejecting economic and political reforms
proposed by President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
The Eritrean People's Liberation Front said
Ethiopia's economy has been shattered by the
government's war against it and other rebel
groups, and the only solution is to end the
conflict.
Mengistu on Monday proposed scrapping the
rigid, Marxist economic system.
