JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
(AP) - Seven people were killed yes
terday when police fired on demon
strators in the black homeland of Bop
huthatswana, one of several black
ruled territories facing growing unrest,
reports said.
South African President F.W. de
Klerk said his government was con
cerned the violence in the homelands
could hinder efforts to open negotia
tions on a new constitution that would
include the country's black majority.
Speaking to journalists in Cape
Town, de Klerk said negotiations could
not begin if there was "anarchy" in
black areas.
Dozens of blacks have died in recent
days during violence in several of
South Africa's 10 black homelands.
Most of the deaths occurred in the
southeastern homeland of Ciskei,
where the military staged a coup Sun
day.
South Africa sent troops into Ciskei
on Monday to help quell looting and
rioting, and de Klerk said he would
take similar action in Bophuthatswana
if necessary.
In nominally independent Bophut
hatswana, police using rifles and tear
gas battled some 50,000 protesters de
manding the reintegration of the
homeland into South Africa.
Clouds of smoke hung in the air
after protesters set fire to public build
ings and vehicles and looted shops in
Garankuwa, part of the homeland 12
miles north of Pretoria, South Africa's
capital.
The Star newspaper of Johannes
burg, quoting witnesses and doctors,
said at least seven people were killed
and up to 500 others suffered various
injuries.
Protesters called for the resignation
of homeland President Lucas Mangope
and waved placards denouncing his
government.
Mangope yesterday night declared a
state of emergency in several parts of
the homeland, which has about 2 mil

lion residents scattered over seven sep
arate pieces of land.
South Africa established the
homelands in the 1960s to try to create
separate, tribal-based states for blacks,
while whites would retain control of
national politics and the economy.
About 14 million of the country's 28
million blacks live in the territories.
Activists in several of the homelands
are demanding reintegration into
South Africa and calling for the end

of white-minority rule in South Africa.
Four of the homelands are nominally
independent, although no nation but
South Africa recognizes them.
In Ciskei, South African troops
helped restore order yesterday after
three days of rioting and looting that
left at least 27 people dead and 550
injured.
Dissident officers in the Ciskei mil
itary seized power Sunday in a blood
less coup, but chaos erupted shortly

afterward.
Ciskei industrialists said the
rampage that followed the coup had
shattered the economy and put 10,000
people out of jobs. Ray Brentnall, head
of the Ciskei Chamber of Industries,
said rioting caused damage worth mil
lions of dollars.
"People are very upset. After sweat
ing blood to build up their businesses
it's heartbreaking to see them go up
in flames," he said.
