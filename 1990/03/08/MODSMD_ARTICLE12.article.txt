Soldiers indicted
MIAMI (AP) — Two U.S. Army
sergeants used military mail to ship
cocaine from Panama to the United
States in their duffel bags, according
to a federal indictment returned yes
terday.
Sgt. Raphiel Fultz, based in
Panama, and Sgt. Jarvis Earl
Worelds, now at Fort Ord, Calif., were
among 20 people indicted in the al
leged scheme, including four Colom
bians handed over to authorities here
by the new government of Panama.
Fultz cooperated in uncovering the
ring after he was arrested on a tip
to the Drug Enforcement Adminis
tration, U.S. Attorney Dexter Leh
tinen said.
The only U.S. citizens charged were
the sergeants, and the shipments in

volved relatively small amounts of
cocaine, Lehtinen said.
Study indicates savings
WASHINGTON (AP) - A U.S.-
Soviet treaty to reduce strategic
weapons would produce annual
federal savings ranging from $3 bil
lion to $12 billion depending on Pres
ident Bush's plans to modernize stra
tegic forces, said a congressional
study released yesterday.
The Congressional Budget Office
projected long-term savings based on
the likelihood that an agreement to
limit nuclear warheads to 6,000 on
each side will emerge later this year
from superpower negotiations in
Geneva.
The treaty would not limit the pro
duction of new weapons systems, and
the CBO estimated the savings based

on three options - the Bush admin
istration continuing full-scale moder
nization of its strategic forces, a less
expensive plan to upgrade the sys
tems and minimum steps to improve
the arsenal.
Jury sworn in
WASHINGTON (AP) - A jury of
seven women and five men was sworn
in yesterday for the Iran-Contra trial
of John Poindexter, whose lawyers
were attempting to sharply curtail
any damaging testimony from Oliver
North, the government's leadoff wit
ness.
The jury was sent home for the
day, after being selected from a pool
of 45 people, as U.S. District Court
Judge Harold Greene considered the
question of whether to limit North's
testimony. Jury selection took just

three days, as opposed to more than
a week in the North trial last year.
Summit dale is flexible
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush
administration said yesterday it is
flexible about the timing of a super
power summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and is willing
to move up the meeting from late
June.
President Bush and Gorbachev had
agreed to hold the summit the last
two weeks of June, probably in Wash
ington. That would put it right before
a seven-nation summit of Western
allies Bush is to host in Houston
from July 9 to 11.
"We'd like to do it as early as pos
sible because of the economic sum
mit," Fitzwater said of the next
Bush-Gorbachev meeting.
