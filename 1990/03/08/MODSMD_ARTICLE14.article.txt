## Time to take action 
### 
WORDS ARE better than
silence. But actions speak
louder than words.
Stanford has taken a bold step
from a policy of timid malaise to
one of forceful leadership. On Mon
day, University President Donald
Kennedy announced that Stanford
may terminate the Webbs' lease if
they fail to settle their labor dis
pute with the United Stanford
Workers at Webb Ranch.
Until now, the University had
effectively avoided taking a defini
tive position on the outrageous
conditions facing the workers at
Webb Ranch, despite the demand
by union representatives, students
and other supporters of the Webb
Ranch workers that Stanford take
a stand.
The community is uniting to
protest the blatant injustice on
Webb Ranch. In addition to the
University's decision to put pres
sure on the Webbs to resolve the

conflict with the workers, the Fac
ulty Senate will vote on a bill today
that is expected to voice its ap
proval of Stanford's support for the
workers.
But statements are nothing if
they are not backed up with ac
tions.
On Tuesday, the Stanford com
munity took an active step in sup
port of the workers. Members of
the community rallied in White
Plaza to make clear their con
demnation of the horrendous vio
lations at the ranch.
Now it's the University's turn.
Stanford needs to continue its com
mitment to the Webb Ranch
workers by working with them to
fight for improvements that are
long overdue.
The University has taken the
first positive step in dealing with
the problems at Webb Ranch. Let's
hope it follows through with ac
tion.
