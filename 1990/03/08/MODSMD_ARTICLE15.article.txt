# Debate a real issue
## 
### 
IT'S TIME to move on.
As the Stanford campus
prepares for the annual ASSU
campaign season, care must be
taken to ensure a fair and informed
election process.
Mistakes do happen; mistakes
must be recognized and dealt with.
However, once a process point is
cleared up, debate should appro
priately move beyond technicalities
to issues of substance.
The distribution of the ASSU
Resource Guides was a violation
of the ASSU Campaign Practice
Codes. The Council of Presidents
has recognized its mistake, and is
taking steps to recall the Resource
Guides.
It's time for the ASSU to move
forward with the rest of its busi
ness. With the prevalence of press

ing issues and the need for student
involvement, it is silly to spend
time on a non-issue that has been
effectively resolved.
For the sake of a constructive
campaign, this minor mix-up has
no place as an election "issue."
There are many other issues con
cerning students that have greater
relevance than a minor infraction
of campaign rules, and this election
should not be bogged down with
technicalities.
Next quarter's elections are a
time for the Stanford community
to choose student government rep
resentatives based on the discus
sion of substantive issues.
Let's address some of these is
sues and not bicker about tech
nicalities.
