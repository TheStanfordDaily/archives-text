Stanford Hospital needs to attract qualified nurses

REGISTERED nurses at Stanford
University Hospital are in the
process of negotiating a new
contract.
The role of the registered nurse has
changed along with changes in the
health care industry. Nursing has
become a highly specialized, high-tech
profession. It requires specialized train
ing, excellent observation, communica
tion and problem-solving skills as well
as technical expertise.
We are not only care givers but
patient advocates, educators and techni
cal specialists. We are at the bedside
24 hours a Hay monitoring patients,
deciding when to notify physicians of
changes and performing complex proce
dures.
We work weekends, holidays and
nights. We are expected to participate

in committees, research, hospital proj
ects, and education of the community.
These services are performed on our
own time without compensation.
There is no question that a nursing
shortage exists. Many experienced RN's
are leaving hospital nursing for jobs in
business and the private sector where
their skills are respected and acknowl
edged with appropriate wages and
benefits. The best students no longer
consider nursing as a career option
because it is considered to be a dead
end job.
We realize that there is a financial
crisis in the health care system. How
ever, RN's with technicians and nurs
ing assistants will not solve the prob
lem. Stanford must offer a contract
with provisions to protect current RN
positions. They must also provide us

with an avenue to voice our concerns
and take action in situations where
unsafe staffing exists.
Stanford has always enjoyed an
excellent reputation in the community.
It is a referral center that attracts the
sickest and most complex patients. In
order to protect its reputation Stanford
must be able to attract and retain
experienced RN's. The best medical
care in the world means nothing with
out equally excellent nursing care.
Let's face it, people come to a hospi
tal because they need nursing care. If
they only needed the care of a
physician, they would go to the doc
tor's office.
We live in an area where the cost of
living has increased dramatically dur
ing the past few years. Stanford must
offer a contract that will attract new

nurses and retain the experienced ones.
The wage proposal that they have
presented actually penalizes their most
experienced and dedicated nurses. This
is unacceptable. Patient care will suffer
because of the loss of good nurses.
They cannot be replaced with less
experienced and less-educated assistants
and technicians.
Stanford must be proactive. It must
look past the current financial cutbacks
to see that in order to survive it must
have qualified RN's to care for
patients.
We are asking Stanford to negotiate
with us in good faith for a contract
that will benefit all. No one wants to
strike. They say they value and respect
us. Let them prove it with a fair and
equitable contract.
Vickie Williams, RN
