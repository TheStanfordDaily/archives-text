# No condemnation of homosexuals in Jesus' ministry
## 
### 
We are prompted to write a response
to the letter of Tony Trousset and
Wendy Allen that appeared in The
Daily on March 5.
For a number of years there has
been a brochure on the door of the
Episcopal Chaplaincy office. On the
front it reads, "What did Jesus say
about homosexuality?" Wh»-n you un
fold the brochure, the inside is com
pletely blank.
For we, as Christians, pay particular
attention to the words of our savior.
Jesus said nothing regarding homo
sexuality and in his ministry spoke
more about the sins of the spirit than
any sins of the body.
To quote Leviticus and to seek to
adhere to the letter of the law in that

book is to deny much of the good news
of Christ. Likewise, Paul was very
much a man of his time and wrote for
particular churches in particular situa
tions. Many of his statements on
women have been disputed in the con
temporary church.
We do not believe that God creates
our gay brothers and lesbian sisters
and then condemns them for acknowl
edging and embracing who they are.
We are also concerned that the Trous
set and Allen letter seems to hold the
single and/or childless life in some
disregard.
Our reading of the Bible in its en
tirety is one of good news for all
people; news of a loving, forgiving and
nurturing God who wants us to help
create a world that accepts and em
powers us all.
