# Individuals should not be objectified as parts of the body
## 
### 
After reading Corey Davis' dramatic
column yesterday, we could not help
but notice his objectification of women.
Many black and white sisters would
certainly object to his sexist ar
chetypes. Black women are defined by
more than just their "big hips and big
booties." Similarly, white women are
not just "blond-haired, blue-eyed
anorexic(s)."
We live in an age where we are
trying to break away from stereotypes;
individuals are more than just a set of
physical characteristics such as breasts,
hips and buttocks.
We appreciate the fact that Davis is
trying to make black women more
confident in their identity. Unfortu
nately, he undermines certain other

ideals in doing so. For many years, the
drive has been to integrate all the di
verse races and cultures into a happy
whole. His column implies that black
women can be fully appreciated only
within the black community, thereby
promoting a spirit of segregation.
Davis' objectives would be better
achieved if he focused on the intellecu
tal strengths and achievements of black
women instead of looking at them as
pieces of meat who go "groovin* at
Friday night house parties."
