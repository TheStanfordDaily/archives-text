## Program offers opportunities for underprivileged 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
"Before Upward Bound, I
thought there were only four ways
of getting into college," said Wood
side High School freshman Dabina
Brown. "Being rich, well off, being
a super brain or a wonder athlete.
Now I know there are many dif
ferent ways."
Brown related her experience
in a speech at a community recep
tion celebrating the Upward
Bound tutorial program on Tues
day at the Center for Educational
Research at Stanford. Her words
reflected what director Arcadio
Morales said the program seeks
to create in its high school stu
dents: "self-esteem."
The national program aims to
encourage low-income and/or
first-generation prospective col
lege students to further their
education. The local chapter,
which is sponsored by the Haas
Center for Public Service, works
with students from area high
schools.
At the reception, University
President Donald Kennedy
praised the program, saying it
promotes access and opportunity
for underprivileged students. He
said the University considers it a
privilege to be involved with Up
ward Bound.
Forty-five Stanford tutors,
from freshmen to doctoral stu
dents, meet with the students for
two to three hours every Satur
day. The tutors work with stu
dents from Peninsula high schools
on their classwork and academic
problem areas and accompany
them on field trips.
Throughout the year-long pro
gram, students and tutors develop
a "big brother/big sister relation
ship," Morales said, adding that
the program has "a family feeling
about it."
According to Morales, who
joined Stanford's Upward Bound
program in August, the diverse
group of 45 students consists of
blacks, Chicanos/Latinos and
Asian-Americans. All instruction
is in English, he said.
Morales came to Stanford from
UC-Santa Cruz and has eight
years of experience with Upward
Bound. Suzette Degrange, who is
the program's first full-time guid
ance counselor, hails from Loyola
University in New Orleans.

Nationally, 90 to 95 percent of
Upward Bound students go on to
college, Morales said. Though
some cannot meet the admissions
standards of the more selective
colleges, "they will still be higher
than they were before," he said.
Many students' families think
four-year colleges are too difficult
for their children, and parents of
ten advise their children to attend
community colleges.
But Upward Bound counselors
encourage their students to go to
four-year colleges. "Anybody can
go to community college," Morales

said. Most Upward Bound gradu
ates attend California public uni
versities, and a few have come to
Stanford, he said.
According to Morales, the high
light of Upward Bound is the
"really intensive" six-week resi
dential summer program held at
Stanford. The summer students
live in University housing, take
classes in the morning and work
in campus offices or do commu
nity work in the afternoon,
Degrange said.
Students study core subjects
such as math and English as well

as less traditional topics such a
psychology and journalism
Morales said, adding that thi
teachers take "non-traditional ap
proaches" to the subjects
Students receive high school elec
tive credit for their classes.
Degrange said many studenti
suffer from problems in theii
home environments. Their neigh
borhoods are filled with "dm
traffickers and homeless peopl
lying in front of' the students
homes. Many students are als*
members of single parent families
she said.
