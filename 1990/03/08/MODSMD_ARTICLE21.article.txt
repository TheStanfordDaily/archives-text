## Why not make it official? 
### 
AUTUMN, the year 2000. John
Tanton, co-founder of the
English-Only Movement, who has
succeeded in passing a national amend
ment deeming English the official
language of the United States, has
been named head of the Stanford
Welcome Committee.
Tanton: Welcome to Stanford, my
boy!
Confused Frosh: Uh, hi.
T: Let's look at your card. Oh, poor
you. You'll be living in Wilbur Hall,
Wood House.
CF: Huh? I thought I was living in
Madera.
T: Bite your tongue! Only English
spoken here.
CF: I thought I was speaking Eng
lish.
T: Obviously your red-white-and-blue
lexicon has been infiltrated by foreign
(shudder) gobbledegook. M-A-D-E-R-A
is Spanish for wood.
CF: Sorry, I don't speak Spanish.
T: That's a blessing. Well, let's show
you around Wilbur. It's really an all-
American complex composed of the
houses Haste, Copse, Hill, Cedar,
Stream, Corner, Wood, and the John
Smith American Theme House.
CF: John Smith? What happened to
the Asian-American Theme house?
T: Well, we couldn't find a transla
tion for O-K-A-D-A. And we got rid of
hyphenated American stuff as soon as
multiculturalism, whatever that is,
went out with fro yo in 1996. Asian-
Amerian, African-American — what's
the difference? We're all Americans.
Don't you read The Stanford Review?

CF: Uh, no.(Looks around and sees
pictures of Ronald Reagan draped in
the entrances and shudders.) Do I have
to live here?
T: Don't get sarcastic on me now,
boy. Stanford is truly a bastion of
language purity . . . and all because
English is the official language of the
United States.
CF: Wasn't it always?
T: The key word is OFFICIAL.
English has always been the prevalent
language in this country, but way back
in the 1980s it was just too easy for
Them to get by without learning Eng
lish.
CF: Them?
T: You know ... the (nudge nudge)
foreigners. Can you believe they had
things like Spanish ballots and emer
gency phone numbers printed up in a
multitude of foreign babbles? Worst of
all, waiters in Japanese restaurants
would have the audacity to jabber
away in Japanese at you when you
walked in.
CF: You jest.
T: No, it was horrible. That's why a
group of America-loving citizens like
me got together to prevent this nation
from crumbling like a Tower of Babel.
CF: Pretty nifty.
T: Our opponents called us xenop
hobes, but they didn't realize we were
doing Them a favor by forcing Them
to learn English quicker. Take this
morning, for instance: a Korean
woman was rushed into the Stanford
emergency hospital from a car accident.
In the old days, a bilingual medical

assistant would probably administer
help in Korean, allowing this woman
to get away with not learning a single
word of English. With English Only in
action, the woman was forced to learn
English on the spot. It took her three
hours and a bunch of dictionaries, but
she finally learned the word blood.
CF: Education at its finest. Hey, I'm
sort of hungry.
T: Well, there are a million restau
rants along The Road, but the best
ones are really in downtown Wood
Heights. One of my favorites is Gold
Gold, a Chinese restaurant called
J-I-N-G J-I-N-G's in the archaic days.
CF: Magnifique! Let's go!
T: Whoa . . . what's this "mag
nifique" stuff? Keep your French on
your toast and off the American
tongue.
CF: But aren't a lot of English
words of French origin?
T: Precisely, which leads us to our
new movement: Old English Only. Fy!
Spek namoore foreyne langage. Now
herkeneth every maner man that
Englissh understonde kan.
