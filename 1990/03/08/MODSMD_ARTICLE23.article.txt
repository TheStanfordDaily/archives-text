Content of survey
is inappropriate
and insensitive
We are writing to express our out
age at a survey on acquaintance rape
which is being circulated by Drs. Doug
Daher and Karen Huang of Counseling
Psychological Services. The survey
studies both male and female concep
tions of male attitudes and behavior,
completely neglecting the needs and
feelings of women.
When questioned last week, Huang
claimed that male attitudes are being
studied exclusively because they are
[he ones which need to change. How
ever, we question their method.
The survey comes in two versions,
one for men and one for women. Both
contain a brief heterosexual dating
scenario which stops short of date
rape.
Women respondents are then asked
to "think about the typical man you
have dated or would date and rate how
[his 'typical man' might react under

four conditions." The woman is in
structed to imagine four different
aspects of this composite man and give
each part a name: the typical man as a
whole, that aspect of him which
responds to her best ideals, that part
of him which is prone to drunkenness
and a sexual fantasy of the typical
man.
She is then asked to speculate on his
thoughts ("I've come so far, I can't
turn back now"), feelings and actions
("stop and discuss each other's
feelings," "beat her," "continue at
same or quicker pace") under each of
these four conditions at the end of the
preceding scenario. Her response is
based on the likelihood the typical man
would think, feel or act in these ways.
We find the survey critically flawed
in method, format and attitude.
Women are forced to generalize and
categorize in a clearly dichotomous
range of options — either the typical
man we have dated is most likely to
rape us or act sensitively and in our
best interests.
Furthermore, what if this survey
goes to a woman who has been raped?
The cover letter attempts to refer stu

dents who are "disturbed" by the sur
vey to counseling — at CAPS, the very
people who circulate the survey.
Particularly in light of The Daily's
recent rape series, we cannot help but
note how remarkably consistent the
survey is with the University's insensi
tive attitude and ineffective policies
toward acquaintance rape victims.

Biblical passages
must be read
in proper context
What rubbish. What absolute rub
bish.
If Tony Trousset and Wendy Allen
claim that "we are not allowed to pick
and choose (from the Bible) what we
wish to apply to our lives and reject
the rest," I'd like to see them never
cut their hair and never eat shellfish

and never get rich. (I leave the
documentation of this to others.)
On a less trivial level: for too long
has the "Word of God" been used to
treat women like shit, justify slavery,
repress any kind of sexuality and
spread loathing, self-hatred, fear and
death. I don't get it; where is "Chris
tian love" in all this? We need to pick
and choose and put things in their
contexts.
A suggestion for Trousset and Allen:
if you really "love" lesbian and gay
(and straight) Christians, then go and
meet some and actually try to listen to
what they have to say.
Go to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford's Coffee House tonight at 9
p.m. at the Fire Truck House. Go to a
Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Speakers'
Bureau. You could actually learn some
thing. Maybe.
And thank you for writing your let
ter. I'm tired of the so-called "con
servative" voice on this campus
continually complaining that it never
has a forum to express itself. We need
to keep talking and listening.

Content of fliers
not meant to be
offensive to women
On behalf of the Intersorority Coucil,
I would like to apologize for the poten
tially offensive nature of fliers distrib
uted on Monday advertising our rush
informational meeting. The fliers were
created and distributed before being
approved by the council or any sorority
and were removed and replaced.
The serious implications of this mis
take are widely recognized by the ISC.
As a women's organization, we strive
to uphold high ideals of womanhood
and stand to promote women's rights.
We do not advocate by any means dis
crimination or demoralizing of women
and are offended by any evidence of it.
Please accept our apology for offend
ing anyone in the Stanford community.
The flier was a result of an oversight
by one person, and the ISC acted as
quickly as possible to remove it.

Bureau. You could actually learn some
thing. Maybe.
And thank you for writing your let
ter. I'm tired of the so-called "con
servative" voice on this campus
continually complaining that it never
has a forum to express itself. We need
to keep talking and listening.

Content of fliers
not meant to be
offensive to women
On behalf of the Intersorority Coucil,
I would like to apologize for the poten
tially offensive nature of fliers distrib
uted on Monday advertising our rush
informational meeting. The fliers were
created and distributed before being
approved by the council or any sorority
and were removed and replaced.
The serious implications of this mis
take are widely recognized by the ISC.
As a women's organization, we strive
to uphold high ideals of womanhood
and stand to promote women's rights.
We do not advocate by any means dis
crimination or demoralizing of women
and are offended by any evidence of it.
Please accept our apology for offend
ing anyone in the Stanford community.
The flier was a result of an oversight
by one person, and the ISC acted as
quickly as possible to remove it.
Pam Simpson
President, Intersorority Council
