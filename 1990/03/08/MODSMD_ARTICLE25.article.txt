The next time you're in Maples Pavilion,
take a look at that old thing hanging
in the corner rafters. You've seen it a
thousand times — it says something about a
basketball championship. It's been there for a
looooong time.
And it's looking mighty lonely.
After almost a half-century, Stanford bas
ketball finally has a chance to bring home a
national title ("Once every 48 years"? Well,
it's just a thought). The women's basketball
team, which has seen its share of great mo
ments this season, just may find the greatest
moment of all at the end of the NCAA tour
nament.

A few of those images will stick with me
long after I've forgotten the scores of all the
team's wins. One of those moments, I think,
perfectly captures the reason this team is so
good — and why, on April 1, it stands a very
good chance of bringing home the national
title.
I was sitting in the press box at Maples
Pavilion six weeks ago, watching the team
destroy Long Beach State, when I saw what
gets my vote as the sweetest play of the season.
It happened near the end of the game, and
since I saw it I haven't been able to get it out
of my head.
Stanford was on offense, and Martha Ric
hards had just gotten the ball out on the right
wing. Martha started dribbling toward the foul
line, and I figured she was about to put up
her runner. Wrong. She swept a two-handed
pass — across her body — to Julie Zeilstra,
who was steaming down the right side of the
floor at the hoop. Great pass, big roar from
the crowd.
The defender on Zeilstra was looking mighty
scared, so I assumed Julie would take it to
the hole for two and the foul.
Of course, I was wrong again. On the dead
run, Zeilstra pulled the ball up and fired a
pass right by the defender's ear to Trisha
Stevens, who was wide open on the other side
of the lane. Another roar. Layup.
This all happened so fast — dribble, sweep,
dribble, zing, layup — that the crowd barely
had time to cheer for the two great passes
before applauding for the score. I was busy
saying "Wow" about a dozen times as the team
ran back to play defense.
In the grand scheme of things, the play
didn't count for much: The team was already
whomping the 49ers, so what did it matter?
Well, nothing much. Except that during that
one sequence a reserve player, who doesn't
get to score much, passed up a shot to make
a beautiful pass to a starter, who then passed
up what looked like a sure three-point play to
get the ball to a teammate who'd already scored
25 points.
If that's not the definition of "team," I don't
know what is.
Great plays and outstanding ability
though, aren't enough to describe this
team. There's something else there, and
I've only seen it once before.
My favorite sports photo is a picture of one
of the basketball teams from my high school's
league. It was taken last February, when the
team was 22-0 and ranked No. 1 in Pennsyl
vania.
The picture shows the team's starters on
the bench, cheering for a basket scored by one
of the reserves on the floor. Cheering may not

actually do the scene justice; the
fans in the stands are going nuts,
and the players (who weren't al
lowed to stand up) are giving each
other high fives, pumping their
fists, laughing and generally
having a great time.
Check out the Stanford bench
at the end of tonight's game and
you'll probably see the same thing
— a bunch of very, very good
players cheering for their reserves
and having a lot of fun.
The one thing I'll remember
most about this team, though,
didn't happen on the court. After
one of the blowouts in January,
I saw Jennifer Azzi standing in
the hallway near the press room,
surrounded by a bunch of children
who wanted autographs.
Normally that wouldn't be un
usual — the players always sign
after the games — except that
these autograph hounds were all
deaf. And the looks on their faces
as they waited for Jennifer were
incredible. They laughed, signed
to each other, and watched her
every move.
It was completely silent, except
for the smiles.
Long after all this is done —
when the NCAA champs (whoever
they may be) take home the
trophy, when Maples is quiet
again — those children will still
remember this team and what it
did. And that may be much more
important than something as
simple as a banner.

team. There's something else there, and
I've only seen it once before.
My favorite sports photo is a picture of one
of the basketball teams from my high school's
league. It was taken last February, when the
team was 22-0 and ranked No. 1 in Pennsyl
vania.
The picture shows the team's starters on
the bench, cheering for a basket scored by one
of the reserves on the floor. Cheering may not

actually do the scene justice; the
fans in the stands are going nuts,
and the players (who weren't al
lowed to stand up) are giving each
other high fives, pumping their
fists, laughing and generally
having a great time.
Check out the Stanford bench
at the end of tonight's game and
you'll probably see the same thing
— a bunch of very, very good
players cheering for their reserves
and having a lot of fun.
The one thing I'll remember
most about this team, though,
didn't happen on the court. After
one of the blowouts in January,
I saw Jennifer Azzi standing in
the hallway near the press room,
surrounded by a bunch of children
who wanted autographs.
Normally that wouldn't be un
usual — the players always sign
after the games — except that
these autograph hounds were all
deaf. And the looks on their faces
as they waited for Jennifer were
incredible. They laughed, signed
to each other, and watched her
every move.
It was completely silent, except
for the smiles.
Long after all this is done —
when the NCAA champs (whoever
they may be) take home the
trophy, when Maples is quiet
again — those children will still
remember this team and what it
did. And that may be much more
important than something as
simple as a banner.
