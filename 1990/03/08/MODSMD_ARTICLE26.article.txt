# The
						Doctor Is In
## Stevens is Stanford's prescription for success 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Someday, Trisha Stevens hopes to be
come a doctor. And, in the opinion
of women's basketball Coach Tara
VanDerveer, "She's going to be a great
one." Unlike her basketball career, though,
her diagnostic career didn't get off to a
great start.
When Stevens was in high school, she
began to experience soreness in her knees
at the end of each season. "I was always
trying to get up and grab the rim. Everyone
was trying to get me to dunk," Stevens
says. "After a while I had to stop doing
that."
In additional to basketball, Stevens also
competed in volleyball and track. She says
she "used to go and high jump 50 times
a day." The soreness got worse, but Stevens
did not worry much about it."I never
thought it was a problem. I thought that's
what eveybody experienced.
"After my freshman year, my knees were
sore but I never thought I needed any
treatment. Then, they started getting really
bad at the end of [last] summer," she adds.
After she arrived this fall, the pain became
worse. "Some days it kills me, other days
it just hurts," she says.
Finally, she went to get some help, figur
ing she could use a knee sleeve. The doctor
had other ideas. "You're going to take three
weeks off," she was told.
"No, I'm not," Stevens said.
Instead, she began to ready herself for
the season. When play got underway,
Stevens started fast and hasn't stopped
since. Currently, she is the Cardinal's
leading scorer at 17 points per game. She
is second in the conference with a .557
shooting pecentage. If teammate Jennifer
Azzi is not awarded the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Player of the Year award this season,
it will probably go to Stevens.
Sonja Henning dribbles up court looking
for someone to pass the ball to. Stevens,
who happens to be Henning's roommate,
is posting up in the low block. Seemingly
without looking, Henning zips the ball to
Stevens.
The Cardinal's 6-foot-3 junior center
catches it, drop steps, fakes the defender
with her shoulder, turns and shoots. Swish.
"Sonja has radar for Trisha," VanDer

veer says. And when Stevens lets go of the
ball, it's like a net-seeking missile.
Even if the opposition's best defender
stands in the lane like some immovable
object, Stevens is an unstoppable force
when she goes to the goal. Regardless of
what you might read in a physics textbook
about the outcome of such an encounter,
when the force is Trisha Stevens she nearly
always wins.
Her success is no accident. Stevens began
playing basketball at a very young age in
a little hamlet known as Philomath, Ore.,
a town of 2,500 just outside of Eugene.
She and her brothers, Jeff and Dirk
would pass the time on the basketball
court. Dirk, who is 6-5, would go at it with
his sister. "Jeff is 6-9 and was sort of the
teacher. He worked a lot with me on the
different moves," says Stevens, explaining
how she learned the subtleties of post play.
"You don't need to do a lot of the dipsy
doodle things," Jeff told Trisha. He ex
plained the basic drop steps, head fakes
and whatnot — and told her to work from
there.
Back then, Stevens knew good advice
when she heard it. VanDerveer says she
still does today. "Trisha has a tremendous
advatange over a lot of great players in
that she's very coachable. She listens and
she tries to do what you're explaining. She
doesn't think she has all the answers and
she doesn't have 15 million excuses," the
coach says.
VanDerveer adds: "I'm a better person
for knowing her. Trisha makes our team
special for me to coach, not because of her
talent but because of what she does for
everybody around her."
What she does is maintain a positive
attitude and an even keel no matter what
happens. It's a demeanor that she developed
over the years off the court, and on it as
well. For Stevens, the thrill of victory has
helped make it easy for her to be upbeat.
"I've never been on a losing team," she
says, adding that while playing three sports
in high school her teams were rarely
defeated. When she came to Stanford,
though, the team had just completed a .500
season and the success the Cardinal is cur
rently enjoying was not guaranteed.
"I don't know what I would have done
if I had come here and we just lost and

Center Trisha Stevens' 17 points a game is one of the reasons the
Cardinal takes a 25-1 record into tonight's contest against Oregon.
