# No. 1 spikers upset by upstart Bruins

Ever had one of those days?
Stanford currently seems to be
having them with increasing fre
quency against UCLA. The No. 1
men's volleyball team (7-2, 7-1 in
WIVA) lost again last night in Pauley
Pavilion to the one squad in the coun
try that seems to have its number
this season. The No. 4 Bruins, who
upended Stanford at the UCSB-
Michelob Light Invitational earlier
this season to register the only pre
vious blot on their record, downed the
Cardinal again in comeback fashion,
2-15, 15-17, 15-7, 15-9, 15-12.

"We played poorly and got beat by
a team that just played better," Coach
Fred Sturm said. "That's the story."
On paper, though, the story
shouldn't have been so dismal.
Statistically, the Cardinal finished the
match leaps and bounds ahead of its
foe. Stanford registered a higher team
hitting percentage (.253 to .237) and
delivered nine more total kills (87 to
78) than UCLA. Four Cardinal players

— led once again by middle blocker
Craig Forsyth, who contributed a .474
percentage — hit over .420.
This offensive output seemed en
tirely sufficient for the task at hand
in the early going. Stanford pelted
UCLA 15-2 in the first game and made
a rousing comeback in Game 2 for a
commanding 2-0 game score.
However, UCLA, as Sturm put it,
"is the type of team that you just
don't want to fall behind," which is
precisely what the Cardinal did in the
ensuing game. An effective Bruin
serve resulted in 11 aces on the night
and passing and siding out difficulties
for Stanford. Trailing in each game,
the Cardinal was unable to recover.
