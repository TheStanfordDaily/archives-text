# Card cruises to ninth title
## 
### Michael Clayton Staff writer 
On March 10, 1982, the Stanford men's
swimming team sneaked ahead of UCLA
by a 426-415 score to win its first Pacific
10 Conference Championship. Nine confer
ence meets later, no squad has come close
to loosening the Cardinal grip on that
trophy.
Yesterday in Long Beach's Belmont Plaza
Pool, Stanford completed three dominant
days of conference competition by inscrib
ing its name into the record books next to
USC's 1961-69 squads with nine consecu
tive Pac-10 titles. Like the 1982 squad, the
Cardinal utilized its superior depth to
finish ahead of UCLA and USC by 281
and 320 points, respectively. Stanford also
completed the task of qualifying the max
imum number of swimmers (17) for the
NCAA Championships.
"The team swam especially well," Asst.
Coach Jay Mortenson said. "We had a great
team effort."
Continuing its dominance of the relay
events, Stanford finished the 1990 confer
ence meet with an uncharacteristic 400
freestyle relay victory. For the first time
during its reign of the Pac-10, a Cardinal
team won the sprint relay. Sophomore John
de Groot, freshman Erik Maurer and sen
iors Doug Lillydahl and Byron Burson, the
same four individuals who set a deGuerre
Pool record in the event earlier this season,
charged ahead of UCLA to win with a
2:55.66 clocking.
In three days, the Cardinal won four of

the five relays. The only relay team that
did not win, the 400 medley squad, had
qualified for NCAAs back in January.
Sophomore Alex Kostich qualified with
an impressive performance in the 1650
freestyle, which vaulted him over classmate
Jason Plummer. Last year Plummer
finished second and Kostich third. Yester
day, Kostich jumped into the top spot,
claiming Stanford's fourth individual
championship, by stroking far ahead of the
field and beating Plummer, the closest com
petitor, by nearly 15 seconds. The next
four swimmers were separated by less than
five seconds.
In the 200 backstroke, the conference's
sophomores cruised past their upperclass
teammates. The first four spots were
claimed by sophomores (and the fifth by
a freshman) as USC's Gary Anderson
reached the wall less than a second before
Stanford's Jeff Rouse and Josh Mikesell.
Maurer led a Cardinal surge in the 100
freestyle with a third-place finish, and, in
the 200 breaststroke, junior Matt Rodgers
just missed touching before UCLA's Andrea
Cecchi.
With their Pac-10 duties now completed,
the Cardinal will begin preparations for
the NCAA Championships, held March 22-
24 in Indianapolis.
