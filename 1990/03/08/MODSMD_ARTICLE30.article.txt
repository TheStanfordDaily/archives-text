# Pac-10 hoops begins today

### 
The Pacific 10 Conference
Men's Basketball Tournament
begins for the last time tonight
when two games will be played.
This is the fourth year of the
tournament and also the last as
athletic directors voted to discon
tinue it after this season. But the
tourney will be played this year,
and it gets underway at Arizona
State's University Activity Center
tonight at 6 p.m.
The bottom four teams in the
conference standings take the
court tonight in an effort to get
to the final eight. In the first
game tonight, No. 8 Arizona State
meets No. 9 Washington while No.
7 USC does battle with cellar
dweller Washington State imme
diately thereafter.
The Sun Devils are not only
the hosts of the tourney but also
have two wins over the Huskies
going for them. They triumphed
63-48 in Tempe early in the year
and repeated the gesture by a 58-
56 margin in Seattle.
The other first-round game
matches a pair of teams who split
their series this year. The Cougars
won their league opener against
the Trojans in Pullman, but as
their 1-17 league record would in
dicate, they weren't too successful
after that.
In fact, they're 0-16 in the '90s.
Meanwhile USC has played fairly
well during the second half of the
season, expecially when Harold
Miner lights it up from outside.
Stanford will meet California
tomorrow in one of the four
second-round games.
