Synchro on top
Upsetting number one ranked Ohio State
in the process, the Stanford synchronized
swimming team handily won a four-way meet
at Davis Feb. 24.
The final standings were Stanford 105,
defending national champion Ohio State 79,
Berkeley 61 and Davis 43. The point totals
were a combination of compulsory figures com
petition, in which swimmers must perform
standard exercises, and freestyle routines, in
dividually designed by each team.
Stanford placed first in all three figures
events, with Karen Madsen winning senior fig
ures, Rekha Rao junior figures and Cyndi Rob
inson novice figures.
Leading the Cardinal's trouncing of Ohio
State, Karen Madsen and Melinda Downey
teamed up to win the duet routine competition
and went on to capture the trio with senior
Debbie Brear.
The win was very significant for the squad
since Ohio State is the Cardinal's main com
petitor, the Buckeyes having won the national
title the last three years with Stanford a close
second.
Stanford will host the Western Regional
Championships this Saturday at deGuerre
Pool. Figure competition begins at 8 a.m. with
the routines starting at 2 p.m.
Cyclists second
The Stanford Cycling team raced to second
place finishes in both the Berkeley hill climb
and criterium during the first big race weekend
of the Western Collegiate Cycling Conference
season Feb. 24.
The Berkeley squad, defending WCCC cham
pions and runner-up at last year's nationals,
took full advantage of their familiarity with
their own 3.5-mile hill climb to win the event
by a wide margin.
Top Stanford riders in the men's A category
included Lou O'Neill, Brian Sterling and fresh
man gear-masher Jeremy Hermann. Addi
tional strong showings by Sacha Henchman,
Rex Jameson, Art Kuo and Larry Tsaithe
pulled Stanford into second place for the day.
A first-place finish in the criterium races
— multiple laps of a technical circuit — looked
to be a distinct possibility for Stanford as the
Cardinal took five out of the top eight places
in the men's D category and four of the top
seven spots in the men's C race.
However, despite Stanford star Coulter Rich
ardson winning three mid-race sprints (primes)
in the men's A race, strong showings by Cal
riders allowed the Golden Bears to surpass
Stanford and grab a first place team finish.
