# Life's never dull with Patty
## Former Stanford netter keeps pro tour rolling with antics 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
While former Cardinal tennis star Patty Fendick's
style of play has been described as "colorful" and
"dynamic," the same could be said for her person
ality.
"I'm a bit of a prankster out on the circuit," she
says."I play jokes on people just to keep it a little
more exciting. If everybody were serious, nobody
would come out and watch the matches."
Fendick's attitude is that tennis is meant to be
fun for everyone — the fans, the media and the
players themselves. She tries to make her career
as enjoyable for those around her as it is for herself.
As a result, Fendick's press conferences usually
boast turnouts as large as those of the top two or
three players in the world. "I joke with 'em. I always
try to leave them with a thought, like, 'Why do
Kamikaze pilots wear helmets?"'
Her attitude that she is "in an entertainment-type
business and it's got to be . . . fun" expresses itself
in her game, as well. Women's tennis coach Frank
Brennan recalls that when Fendick was playing for
Stanford, "of the 1,000 people in the stadium, 900
would be watching Patty's match."
"I like to create a lot of energy while I'm on the
court," she says."I like to think I'm fun to watch.
"A lot of times," she admits, "I'll go out in a
match and people will root for the other person
because, you know, it's their hometown, or whatever,
by about halfway through the match you can
feel it kind of turning a little bit, and then by the
end most of the people end up rooting for me."
But tennis fans and newspaper reporters aren't
the only ones who enjoy Fendick's game. Although
she claims that "nothing will ever compare" to her
four years on The Farm, she also glows about her

current profession. However, she is also quick to
point out the limitations of modern professional
tennis.
"The problem with tennis now is that there's so
much money in it people tend to start thinking
about that rather that thinking about how fun it
can be," she says.
"But, you can't do it just for the money. . . I
mean, the traveling schedule — you have no personal
life — I mean there's none. There's zero. You have
to eat, sleep and breathe it. And there's no time
for anything else; everything gets sacrificed for it.
So you better enjoy what you're doing or you won't
last long."
As for herself, Fendick says,"I really enjoy what
I'm doing and I really enjoy my life. There were
times at Stanford when I just didn't think I was
going to make it because I was burning the candle
at both ends. Now, it's so easy. All I have to do is
play tennis. It's great."
Card Notes
When Fendick is asked to compare her Cardinal teams
to today's, she assumes an air of faux righteousness. "See,
when I was here," she states, "it wasn't this easy. It was
never this easy. I mean, these guys, shoot, they're not
doing anything — they're just so good."
Fendick says that Stanford has been so dominant lately
because of a combination of a few factors. First, she
claims the level of competition has gone down.
Second, "there's so much depth on this team. You just
go out there and they're all straight through. You know,
you look at the first line and you go, 'They'll win.'"
Additionally, Fendick says that team dynamics have
been more amicable of late. "We used to have dogfights,"
she recalls. "See, our team was really colorful. .. There
were always personality conflicts on our team. We had
eight leaders and no followers."
