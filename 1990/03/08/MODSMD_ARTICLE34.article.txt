# Frosh netter leads Card sweep of Spartans
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Few tennis players can punish
opponents in as many ways as
Stanford freshman Jared Palmer.
"Jared can beat you from
anywhere on the court," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "He can
beat you from the baseline. He
can beat you serving and volley
ing. He's one of the most versatile
players I've ever coached."
San Jose State's No. 1-ranked
player, Mike Chinchiolo, learned
this the hard way as Palmer
avenged an earlier loss to
Chinchiolo with a 6-1, 6-3 thrash
ing yesterday at Stanford Tennis
Stadium.

Palmer's teammates followed
suit, giving the Cardinal a 9-0
victory over the Spartans.
"When [Palmer's] on, he's ex
tremely tough to beat,"
Chinchiolo said. "He hits the ball
a lot harder than most people,
which makes it tough to get any
rhythm."
But if Chinchiolo thought Pal
mer was tough to beat yesterday,
his teammates warn that the
"real" Palmer has yet to surface.
Palmer underwent knee surgery
Jan. 9 and is still recovering.
"The thing about my knee sur
gery was that I was off my feet
for three to four weeks after the
surgery," he said. "I've taken
breaks from tennis before, but I
was still active. When I tried to
come back this time, my feet were
all out of synch. I'm still working
on that."
Palmer, who was ranked in the
top five on the world junior circuit
before coming to Stanford, has
impressed nearly everyone who
has watched him play, especially
his teammates.
"There's not another player in
college tennis who can consis
tently come up with the brilliant
shots that Jared can," teammate
Glenn Solomon said. "The more

confidence he gets after his oper
ation, the better tennis he is going
to start producing."
Teammate Eric Peus adds, "I've
been around a lot of great tennis
players. But Jared is one of the
few players who I think could be
No. 1 in the world one day."
Of course, Palmer is not perfect.
"Sometimes a great athlete can
forget the basics," Gould said.
"What we want to do with Jared
is to make sure he's got a solid
base to fall back on. We want him
to have — not just a punishing
serve — but a punishing and con
sistent serve. We want him to have
— not just punishing
groundstrokes — but punishing
and consistent groundstrokes."
According to Gould, Palmer is
definitely a threat to win the
NCAA championships in May.
"Jared is only going to get better
and better," Gould said. "By the
time the NCAAs come around,
you are going to see a phenomenal
tennis player."
Palmer, who was ranked No.
223 in the world last year, already
has some significant dents on the
professional circuit, recording
wins over former Stanford No. 1
Jeff Tarango, Jimmy Arias, and
Kevin Curren.
The Cardinal freshman also
regularly practices and plays dou
bles with the world's No. 1-ranked
player, Ivan Lendl. "It was really
educational for me to hit with
Lendl," Palmer said. "It was in
teresting to see what he puts into
tennis. He's very disciplined."
