## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY Roller coaster renaissance A
						national guide to this season's best thrill rides 
### 
There's nothing like the feeling of wind rushing
through your hair, floors dropping out from un
derneath you, or your stomach being left far be--
hind. Basically, there's nothing like a good thrill
ride.
Although roller coasters in America numbered
almost 2,000 in 1920, by 1978 less than 150
remained nationwide. But the past year has seen
a "roller coaster renaissance" of sorts, as thrill
rides, coming back into vogue, now number 190,
with 13 new roller coasters to open this year.
Theme parks across the country are opening
their gates just in time for the spring break
onslaught of vacationing college students, families
and tourists. Intermission highlights seven of the
best thrill-ride amusement parks in the country.
Magic Mountain, Valencia, Calif. — Magic
Mountain is listed in its press guide as a "family
theme park," but one glance at the park from the
nearby freeway tells a different story. Magic Moun
tain's thrill rides are undoubtedly the best in South
ern California.
This season spotlights the opening of Viper, the
world's largest looping roller coaster. Towering
seven stories above Colossus, the dual-track roller
coaster which serves as the park's centerpiece,
Viper includes three vertical loops, a two-loop
corkscrew, and one boomerang turn. Speeds exceed
70 miles per hour over die 2.5 mile ride.
Visitors to Magic Mountain can also soar on
Ninja, the world's fastest suspended roller coaster,
in wliich riders achieve 55-mile-per-hour speeds
and 180-degree swings while hanging from an

overhead-track. Revolution boasts a 90-foot verti
cal loop that was the world's first upside-down
trip, and Freefall offers a ten-story drop to the
ground.
Kings Island, Cincinnati, Ohio — Kings Island,
renowned for its daunting and invigorating thrill
rides, is considered to be one of the best amuse
ment parks for miles around. Rides include Vortex,
a six-loop ride, King Cobra, the world's first stand
up roller coaster, the Racer, and of course the
incredibly popular Beast.
The Beast is both the most famous of the thrill
rides at Kings Island as well as the most terrifying.
It is listed in the Guiness Book of World Records
as the largest wooden roller coaster in the world.
The Beast reaches speeds exceding 65 miles an
hour taking 45-degree turns. It is definitely a roller
coaster and a park not to miss if you are in the
area, and it's worth driving three days across the
country.
Astroworld, Houston, Texas — If you plan to
spend your spring break in Houston, check out
Astroworld, perhaps Texas' biggest amusement
park. The big feature there is the Texas Cyclone,
chosen as the world's best rollercoaster by People
magazine in 1985. Also, this season debuts the
Ultra Twister, described only as an "unusual
shuttle coaster."
Other rides vary in quality, from the take-your
breath-away 100-foot loop called Greased Lightnin'
to the truly lame XLRB rollercoaster.
Great America, Santa Clara, Calif. — Great
