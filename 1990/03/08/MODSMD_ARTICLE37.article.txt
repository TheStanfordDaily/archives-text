# Animated 'His Boy Elroy’ rocks the Farm
## 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
If you don't want to have fun, don't
go to a party where His Boy Elroy is
playing.
Once the eight-member band starts
playing, the dance floor immediately
fills. The vocalists smile, dance and
gesture at the crowd. Music fills the
air and the whole room comes to life.
The crowd is swept away.
The energy emanating from the band
is inescapable, and His Boy Elroy in
variably mesmerizes the crowd.
Most of the audience is usually
watching Wren Wescoatt, the band's
male vocalist. Wescoatt shrugs, dances
and shuffles his feet along to a quirky
grin that tells you he is loving every
minute on stage.
Even if you have never seen His Boy
Elroy play before, the band members
■nay look familiar. Three of the band
members were formerly with the
Youngsters, a popular campus band
which broke up last year.
Dan Brown, the group's guitarist,
Sean Varah, the keyboardist and Wes
coatt, the vocalist, played with The
Youngsters until their break-up last
February.
In addition to its three founding
members, the band now includes Matt
Vaska on trombone, Dave Jones on
trumpet, Jeff Mueller on drums, Sharon
Stolberg with female vocals and Ives
Chor on bass.
In general, the band members are a
I'ght-hearted bunch who don't take
themselves too seriously. They joke
ar ound, tease each other and often
Chor, the youngest member in
me group.
Even deciding on a name for the
e clectic group has not been competely
fesolved. "We were going to call our
selves 'Shut Up Ives,' " said Stolberg,
out it just didn't fly."
We finally picked His Boy Elroy be
muse it's the name of another band at
'nzona State [University]," said Wes-
c °att. "But I think we're still in the
Market for a good name."

His Boy Elroy got off to a strong start
last spring, playing at many campus
parties and events. This fall they
decided to "go underground," in order
to record old music and learn new
songs. Now, however, they are back in
the performing circuit, having already
played at several campus parties this
quarter.
The group's repertoire can be classi
fied as upbeat and danceable progressive
rock. "We're trying to work on a new
sound now," said Stolbcrg. "I think
we're moving in the direction of Carib
bean music, and have added some
reggae and ska. Dave just picked up
the song "Island Girl" on a vacation in
Antigua. . .

Most of their music, however, is far
more familiar, including tunes from
The Cure, the B-52's, the English Beat,
Thomas Dolby, Oingo Boingo and the
Smiths.
"We all pick out songs we'd like to
play and put them on one tape," said
Stolberg, "then wc cach learn our parts
off the tape and jam around until it
sounds right."
The band members decide which
songs they arc going to learn by a rela
tively democratic process. "We all have
really different tastes in music," said
Vara, "so we each pick out songs we'd
like to do and put them on one tape.
After that, Wren takes them all off and
puts on what he wants to play."

After the band has learned a song,
it still stands a strong chance of being
discarded. During their rehearsals, one
of the most frequent questions is "OK,
who votes that we NEVER, EVER do
that song again?"
But His Boy Elroy can afford to be
choosy. The band already has a vast
selection of songs ready to perform
"Wait," Vara said, "I think we should
explain the reason why we're together.
I mean, we do this because it's fun.
It's not an ego thing ... is it?"
"It is for me," Wescoatt said.

His Boy Elroy's next scheduled appear
ance is at an Ultimate Frisbee tourna
ment on the IM fields on Saturday.
