# Chatting with Curtis
## Jamie Lee discusses new movie 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
Though drama has been a lifetime ambition for
Jamie Lee Curtis, her career has skyrocketed in just
the past few years.
Curtis began her acting career in the lowly realm
of horror movies, including "Halloween" I and 11,
"Terror Train," and "Prom Night." Recently, however,
the success of such movies as "Trading Places" and
"A Fish Called Wmda" has drawn her out of the
acting doldrums end into prominence as one of the
sexiest, most dynamic actresses around.
Intermission caught up with Curtis in Los Angeles
to talk about her latest film, "Blue Steel."
Intermission: With the success of "Trading Places"
and "A Fish Called Wanda," it seemed that you were
becoming primarily a comedic actress. How do you
feel about the role change in "Blue Steel" with regard
to drama and violence?
Jamie Lee Curtis: I don't look on my career as
planned. If a good role comes up at the right time
then I will take it. In fact, I started work on "Blue
Steel" before "A Fish Called Wanda" was a hit.
I knew "Blue Steel" was a cop film, and cop films
are violent. I've done many horror films in the past,
but I've always refrained from taking a moral stance
on their violence. I think audiences love to see vio
lence and action, so I did my best to give them that.
I: What special preparation did you undertake to
play this new role?
JLC: Well, I've never fired a gun before, not a
single round, so I had to learn how to shoot. When
I first picked up the pistol, I really respected the
weapon. I had never dealt with something so imme
diate and powerful before.
As I got used to handling the gun, some of this
fear went away. But I think that any cop would tell
you that if you're not scared of your gun, it's time
to quit. Actors feel that too. If you're not a little
excited and your heart doesn't beat faster every time
you're on the stage or in front of the camera, then
it's time to move on.
I: It seems that many women's acting opportunities
in the film industry deal with sex and exploitive
nudity. "Blue Steel," however, refrains from any
female nudity. How do you feel about nude scenes
in your roles?
JLC: If I was going to exploit myself, I would have
when I was a teenager. In the scene in "Trading
Places" where I take off my shirt, that nudity fit the
unabashed character I was playing and was right for
the part. However, I won't do it again. If Megan in
"Blue Steel" were to unbutton her blouse, it's no
longer Megan but becomes Jamie Lee.
I don't want the audience to be interrupted and
say "there's Jamie's tits." If women without great
bodies take off their clothes, it's not that interesting,
but since I have an attractive body, showing it in
terrupts the flow of the movie.
I: With the success of your recent films and the
hopeful success of "Blue Steel," in what roles do you
see yourself in the future?
JLC: Everyone's perception now is that I'm a "hot
ticket," and I am, to a point. Mostly, however, I'm
offered a lot of mediocre jobs. Most roles for women
are negligible and boring, often as the girlfriend of
the star. I'd rather be involved in something that's
creative than something that's mediocre or too main
stream.
I: With respect to Megan's character in "Blue Steel,"
did you feel that there was an underlying theme
involving a conflict between striving for vengeful
lustice and upholding "the system" of the law?
JLC: Megan's actions were WTitten into the script
and were not my decisions. I had to perform from
the script as best as I could. My greatest challenge
was keeping honest in all my reactions as Megan.
Although I personally feel she was correct in her
actions, what was important was that Megan believed
that what she did was correct. I just did the best I
could to convey this belief.
I: Working with a female director, Kathryn Bigelow,
on this film portraying a woman cop in the lead
role, did you notice resistance on the part of the
motion picture industry to produce and release "Blue
Steel?"
JLC: There was some resistance, yes, because some
executives doubted the marketability of the idea.
Oliver Stone, who produced "Blue Steel," helped
greatly to break this resistance and get the film made
Now, I feel that a lot is up to the film. If the movie
is a success then it will transcend gender and apply
to both sexes equally.
