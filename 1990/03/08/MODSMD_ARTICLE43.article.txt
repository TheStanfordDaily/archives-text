## Pilobolus dance theater more than just a fungus 
### Charan Devereaux 
Dance ensembles are rarely named
for fungi. For the Pilobolus dance
troupe, though, their unorthodox name
reflects their unique style of production.
Pilobolus, whose name describes a
light-seeking fungus, was the brainchild
of a handful of Dartmouth students in
1971. Nineteen years later, the group
has toured around the world, including
performances in London, Rome, Sin
gapore and two sessions on Broadway.
Renowned for its unique style,
pilobolus' performances combine
theater, acrobatics and dance tech
niques, as dancers form amoebas, eight
limbed creatures and unbelievable body
sculptures on stage.
Jonathan Wolken, co-founder of
Pilobolus, is one of the troupe's five
artistic directors. All dances are created
in collaborative efforts, and Wolken
believes that this creative process is
one of Pilobolus' finest assets. "Where
one may have weaknesses, others have
strengths," Wolken said. "In our com
pany, what results is more than a single
person's vision."
However, group choreography also
has its own shortcomings. Group con
sensus is often difficult to achieve.
"When we do agree on things, it's
fabulous," said Wolken. "Disagreement,
however, is less fabulous."

Pilobolus was never meant to be a
traditional ensemble. The original im
petus came from Alison Chase, a
Dartmouth dance instructor, who
wanted to give students freedom to cho
reograph and experiment with dance
expression. "She set no boundaries,"
Wolken said. After graduation, Wolken
and Moses Pendleton founded
Pilobolus, and were later joined by
classmates Robby Barnett and Michael
Tracy, as well as Chase herself.
Traditional dance training takes a
back seat to personal styles for
Pilobolus. "We bring our whole lives
into the studio," Wolken said, "from
our mournings to our personal limita
tions and always being our senses of
humor." Wolken also cited influences
from science and literature
Tonight's performance will be the
