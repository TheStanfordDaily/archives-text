# 'Alchemist' play glitters like gold
## 
### Allison Gerson 
Wouldn't it be nice if you could get an
A without doing any work? Or get a job
without ever going to the Career Planning
Placement Center? The desire to get some
thing for nothing is something everyone
can understand.
Director James Loehlin's production of
Ben Jonson's "The Alchemist" depicts the
world of Jacobean London, in which this

same desire pervades all levels of society.
The play focuses upon three criminals
who work together to con everyone they
meet out of their money. The alchemist
himself is a low-life charlatan who uses
mystical robes and esoteric language to
convince people to fund his "projects" for
turning lead into gold.
He is aided by Face, a butler, who finds
potential clients and allows the group to
set up shop in his house while the master

is away. The trio is completed by Doll
Common, a prostitute who seduces the
clients and picks their pockets for what
they have not already given to the "doctor."
The audience laughs knowingly as the
three work their con game on all members
of their society. Sir Epicure Mammon, a
nobleman, seeks a philospher stone which
will allow him to turn everything into
gold.
Loehlin says that "much of the play
depends on the specific social and histor
ical milieu in which it is written." Yet he
clearly wants us to make the connection
between the world on stage and our own
world. The program is studded with quo
tations from contemporary figures like Jim
Bakker and Ivan Boesky and examples of
modern get-rich-quick schemes.
However, the play is not a parable or
a dreary lecture on the evils of modern
society. Rather, "The Alchemist" is a very
funny, fast-paced farce.
Loehlin's production of "The Al
chemist" contains many fine perform
ances. Ray O'Neal is both cunning and
cruel as Face, switching effortlessly from
accomplice to lab assistant to butler. Andy
Arrow's Epicure Mammon evokes hysteri
cal laughter through his sensual fantasiz
ing and almost childish gullibility. And
Anne Kauffman, as Ananias, seems like
a Jacobean version of the Church Lady
from "Saturday Night Live."

"The Alchemist" runs tonight, tomorrow
and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2
p.m. at The Nitery Theater in Old Union.
Tickets are available for $5 at the Tres
idder Box Office.
