## 'Lost Souls' with direction 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
The worst thing about "vintage"
rock and roll is that old artists die,
retire, or grow stale quicker than
new artists can fill their places. As
styles change, genres become per
manently stuck in time, with little
chance of continuation.
With "Lost Souls," the impres
sive debut album from the Rain
dogs, mainstream classic rock gets
rejuvenated. Called "a dream of a
bar band" by "Rolling Stone," the
Raindogs put themselves ahead of
other groups with their diverse mu
sical repertoire, introspective
lyrics, and a fiddler described as
"the band's secret weapon."
Fiddler Johnny Cunningham
shines on "Lost Souls," but the
album's solid structure is
definitely a group effort, with mu
sical styles from Celtic folk to
American country to Cajun rock.
The eclectic influences reflect the
band's scattered backgrounds,-
band members hail from Loui-

siana, Africa, Ireland, and Scot
land.
The lyrics of lead vocalist Mark
Cutler highlight emotions of per
sonal conflict and turmoil, from
love to loneliness, deception to self
esteem. With a vocal style like
Tom Petty, Cutler can cut deep
("I'm Not Scared") as well as reveal
vulnerability ("Too Many Stars").
Instruments complement each
other without competing, display
ing the experience of bassist Dar
ren Hill, guitarist Emerson Torrey,
and drummer James Reilly.
"Lost Souls" has received quite
a bit of critical acclaim. "Rolling
Stone" called the album "invigorat
ing and riveting." "Billboard" cited
the band's "delicious stew of in
fluences." And Peter Buck of
R.E.M. said the Raindogs "write
good songs and play well together.
. . . They're a great live act."

Intermission caught up with the
Raindogs' songwriter and lead
vocalist, Mark Cutler, after their
spotlighted appearance at the
Gavin Convention Center in San
Francisco.

Intermission: Where did the
name "Raindogs" come from?
Mark Cutler: "Raindogs" is a
term given to stray canines that
are picked up by the Manhattan
animal pound. After it rains, the
scent washes away, and the dogs
can't find their way back home.
Workers at the pound call the
strays "rain dogs."
I: How did the band members
finally come together?
MC: Darren and Jimmy had just
left their old band, the Red Rock
ers, some time after they had
toured with U2. They ended up in
Boston and met Johnny Cunning
ham in an Irish bar called
Limerick's.
Meanwhile, I was with a band
called the Schemers up in Rhode
Island. Just when I was getting
frustrated with my band, Darren
called me up. Everything else hap
pened from there.
I: "Musician" said that each
song on "Lost Souls" told an in
dividual story.
MC: Actually, a lot of the stories
are reflections of memories from
my upbringing. I worked for a long
time as a stagehand for an opera
house in Boston. One of my co
workers would always complain
about being afraid of growing and
changing. That story became "Too
Many Stars" on the album. I just
thought that he had the worst ex
cuse for fighting for his dreams.
I think that many of the songs
parallel common situations.
There's a lot of human interest in
the songs. I didn't want to make
the lyrics overly political or any
thing; I don't believe in forcefeed
ing ideas or beliefs through the
media.
The Raindogs have all the pieces
of a strong mainstream band, and
all the signs of a bright future. For
a group of "lost puppies," the Rain
dogs have definite direction.

The Raindogs play March 18 at
Slim's, 333 Eleventh Street, in San
Francisco, as part of their current
tour with Warren Zevon. Tickets
are available at all BASS outlets.
