# Patrick St.: Irish folk
## 
### Sherromba Barbee Staff writer 
In a world of MTV, Michael
Jackson and U2, it might be con
sidered strange to make a living
as an Irish folk musician. But to
Kevin Burke, fiddler for Patrick
Street, his profession is nothing
unusual.
"I started playing as a kid,"
Burke said. "I just never grew out
of it, I supppose."
In 1987, Burke helped found
Patrick Street, an Irish group which
plays both traditional and contem
porary folk music.
"Traditional music," Burke said,
"is closer to mainstream music in
Ireland than it is in the States.
Back home, it's fairly well-known
and well-heard." However, he
added that traditional music re
mains a small part of the music
world, relative to the worldwide
popularity of bands like U2.
Much of Patrick Street's music
is laced with political commentary.
Like racial conflicts in America,
Ireland has a history of civil strife.
"Whenever your life is being ruled

by someone else," Burke said, "the
end result is the same."
"Naturally, our opinions come
out in the music," Burke said. "It's
not directly political, but even the
fact that it exists is political. We're
not pushing the Ireland thing so
much, it's just that we happen to
be Irish."
Patick Street plays a number of
traditional instruments, including
the fiddle, the mandolin, the
bouzouki and the uilleann pipes.
However, they also use keyboards
in order to add "depth and breadth
to the sound."
The group's name comes from
real streets in Ireland. Patrick
Street is a street name in almost
every town in Ireland, similar to
Main Street in the United States.
"We thought the name was good,"
Burke said, "because it made ref
erence to town life in Ireland."

Patrick Street will perform Sunday
at Memorial Auditorium. Tickets
range from $17 to $12, with a $3
discount for Stanford students, and
are available at BASS outlets. Call
725-ARTS for more information.
