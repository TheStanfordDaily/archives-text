# Hammer hits hard on 'Hurt'
## 
### Tim Marklein 
He got it started with his 112i rst
album; now he's back to finish it
In the past two years, Oakland
native M.C. Hammer has become
the undisputed king of dancing
rappers — he terms himself the
"Dancin' Machine" on his new al
bum, "Please Hammer Don't Hurt
'Em." While other rappers have dis
tinguished themselves with their
voices or messages of black em
powerment, Hammer's feet have
proved his point.

Some new artists have tried to
replicate his style, and Digital Un
derground admits that people
doing their new "Humpty Dance"
look like "M.C. Hammer on
Crack." He has become the defini
tive dude of dance, and his newest
album will do nothing to change
that.
"U Can't Touch This," the al
bum's first single, takes Rick
James' classic "Superfreak," mixes
in some fresh new beats and pro
vides a pumped background for
Hammer and his posse to "do the
Hammer" until it hurts.
In addition to the trademark
bells and "Go Hammer" chants
from the first album (which in
cluded "Let's Get It Started," "Ring
'Em" and "Turn This Mutha
Out"), Hammer rounds out his
sound with some new tricks of the
hip-hop trade, including heavy
sampling from previous hit songs
like Prince's "When Doves Cry."
Hammer even includes some so
cial commentary of his own, most
notably on "Crime Story," a col
lection of four scenes about losing
in drugs, gangs and prostitution.
Hammer says he's "not gonna mis
lead my brothers," and makes a
plea at the end for gang members
to allow young kids to "do their
thing at the schoolhouse" and
"lead a different life."
