## Bergin: atop 'Mountains' 
### Chris MeKenna 
In his lifetime, Sir Richard Burton was a
Victorian explorer, geologist, anthropologist,
poet, fencing master, linguist and the first
white man to enter the forbidden, holy Mus
lim citadel of Harer. Few persons could ever
dream of accomplishing even one-tenth of
the remarkable feats which Burton achieved.
Yet one man was chosen to portray this
fascinating character for the new film
"Mountains of the Moon." His name is
Patrick Bergin, and the relatively unknown
Irish actor recently catapulted himself into
the limelight by receiving rave reviews for
lis performance as the famous explorer. Jack
Gamer of the "Gannett News," said that
Bergin "clearly dominated the film ... in a
most impressive debut."
Intermission recently talked with Bergin
about "Mountains of the Moon".
Intermission: As an actor, how difficult
Iras it to try to capture such a complex
individual on screen?
Patrick Bergin: It was extremely hard.
There's no man alive who has the range of
iharacteristics that Burton had. No man I
mow has killed 30 men with a sword and
ived through it, disguised himself as a Mus
im and snuck into Mecca, or written 40
rolumes of books and spoke 29 languages,
tod all of this occurred before he was 30.
'Mountains of the Moon" recounts only one
small aspect of an utterly incredible life.
I: At one point, the film seems to suggest
kt Burton was combatting racism. How
:ver, some people today profess that he was
jrejudiced.
PB: Burton found that different tribes had
lifferent qualities. He thought that the Arab
nentality, and perhaps consequently the
tfhite man's mentality, was superior; not

inherently superior, but culturally. To him,
a society based on cruelty will always be
inferior to a society that is not. Many that
were involved in the antiracist movement
of his time neglected to realize that there
really is good and bad.
Here's one man trying to suck in all of
the knowledge of the world and attempt to
come up with one truth. So along the way
he says that some of the black tribes were
lazy drunkards. But he says the same thing
about some of the English. As complex as
this film is, the real story and the real
Richard Burton are ten times more complex.
I: This film was shot on location in Africa,
under rigorous conditions. What was one of
the most memorable aspects of production?
PB: Acting with the lion was extremely
difficult. There's a scene in the film where
Burton gets attacked by a lion, so for the
movie they literally threw a lion at me —
a quarter of a ton of drugged lion. The first
time he landed on me, his claws were still
out and they pierced my clothing.
On the third or fourth take, Bob [Rafelson,
the director] said "No, no, no. I'll show you
how to do the scene." So he got down on
the ground, and the crew was just about to
drop the lion on him when the thing opens
its mouth and eyes and lets out a growl.
Needless to say, Bob was rightsut of there.
Suddenly, the macho man was not so
macho.
This film raises a lot of meaningful ques
tions. Is it getting to the source of the water
which is important, or is it the journey? As
we plunge headfirst into the 21st century,
we have to know what our journey is, what
we're trying to achieve. If it's the domination
of one species over another, we're fucked.
We need to find common territory, just like
Richard Burton was trying to find common
territory.
