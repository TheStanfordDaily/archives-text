## Committee calls for individual decisions 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
University faculty and staff are
afraid to make individual deci
sions because of the risks in
volved, a University committee
has found, but the same commit
tee is aiming to increase individ
ual decision making in Stanford's
administrative operations.
University administrative deci
sions are now often made by con
sensus, a process many consider
inefficient.
A committee created in October,
Action Plans for Change, is ex
amining decision making at Stan
ford and will recommend changes
in management structure so that
individual staff will have more re
sponsibility — and accountability
— for making decisions. Also,
more decisions will be made at
lower levels in the administration.

However, the committee has
realized that this goal will require
a change in "management cul
ture," from an academic tradition
to a more hierarchical corporate
structure.
"Universities and colleges ha
ven't grown up with business
practices.. .. We sometimes avoid
pinpointing decision makers,"
said Vice President for Adminis
trative Resources Su Schaffer.
Committee chair Robert Street,
vice president for information re
sources, has identified four main
tasks for his committee:
• Simplify administrative pro
cesses;
• Simplify organizational struc
ture;
• Create better communication
around the University; and
• Change management culture.
Street's committee was recently
merged into a second committee,
led by Provost James Rosse, that
is charged with cutting the Uni
versity's operating budget by $22
million.
Though Action Plans for
Change has been functioning for
nearly five months, "Not any of
us (involved with the committee)
has an entirely clear idea" of how
to tackle these sweeping challeng
es, according to Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Susan
Schofield, who is on the support

staff.
Nevertheless, "There's no way
this is going to feel comfortable"
for staff, said Director of Human
Resources Services Mary Moore,
a member of the committee's sup
port staff.
Any changes to the manage
ment structure, however, will
have to be coupled "with an en
dorsement of risk taking," accord
ing to Vice President for Public
Affairs Bob Freelen, a committee
member.
Freelen likened such an en
dorsement to the University en
couraging students to take some
academic risks and explore
courses outside of their realm of
talents.
"You have to support staff when
they make mistakes," Moore
added.
Moreover, "The [staff] who will
still be around will be those who
want to make the leap" from con
sensus to individual decision
making, said Schofield.
From the perspective of John
Kennedy, administrative services
manager for the Department of
Chemistry, "It's a wise move that
they don't try to get everybody
in on all decisions." Howevej, he
said he felt consensus decision
making among staff is not always
bad and inefficient.
On the other hand, he will wel
come more responsibility for day
to-day decisions. "It will allow you
more control over your daily life.
A lot of times you don't feel you
have that," Kennedy said.
Richard Baldwin, administra

'Universities and col
leges haven't grown
up with business
practices We
sometimes avoid pin
pointing decision
makers.'
Su Schaffer
tive services manager for the
Procurement Office, agreed with
Kennedy and said streamlining
the administration is a step in
the right direction. However, "It's
important to have broad policy
decisions going through a consen
sus process," he noted.
Kennedy and Baldwin both
lauded the committee for listening
to the thoughts and suggestions
of staff, although they emphasized
their uncertainty about its aims.
Faculty will remain relatively
unaffected — their decit ons will
still be made through a consensus
process, while staff "will bear es
sentially all of the costs" of the
change, Street said.

Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy pointed out at the last
Faculty Senate meeting that such
lopsided changes could cause
faculty-staff animosity. He sug
gested some consideration be
given to cutting the salary in
creases of tenured faculty.
However, Street said staff
growth has far outpaced faculty
growth over the last few years,
and it is "reasonable" to target
staff only for reductions.
It is hard to quantify the
benefits of streamlining, accord
ing to Street. Using the example
of Human Resources Services, he
predicted that a change from con
sensus to individual decision
making will save that group "a
factor of two or three" in time
and "about one-fourth of what it
spends now."

Faculty Senate meeting that such
lopsided changes could cause
faculty-staff animosity. He sug
gested some consideration be
given to cutting the salary in
creases of tenured faculty.
However, Street said staff
growth has far outpaced faculty
growth over the last few years,
and it is "reasonable" to target
staff only for reductions.
It is hard to quantify the
benefits of streamlining, accord
ing to Street. Using the example
of Human Resources Services, he
predicted that a change from con
sensus to individual decision
making will save that group "a
factor of two or three" in time
and "about one-fourth of what it
spends now."
