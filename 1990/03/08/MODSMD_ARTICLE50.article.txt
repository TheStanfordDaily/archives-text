# Epic production peaks at 'Moon'
## 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
Few modern movies compare to the
epic adventures of the past. Their elab
orate sets and sweeping, panoramic shots
of awe-inspiring landscapes render the
vast majority of recent films insignificant
in comparison.
Recently, however, Bob Rafelson, the
creator of "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy
Pieces/' attained the high goal of creating
a film which hearkens back to the genius
of "Lawrence of Arabia." With "Moun
tains of the Moon," Rafelson demon
strates that epics still exist, and that
individuals' lives can be richer than any
stretch of the imagination.
"Mountains of the Moon" depicts the
fact-based story of Richard Burton's quest
to discover the source of the Nile. Bur
ton's adventuresome career included kis
sing the sacred Kabba stone and
translating the Kamasutra. Master of 20
languages and 40 dialects, Burton travels
with John Hanning Speke deep into the
"uncivilized" expanses of Africa's core.
Shot on location in Kenya, the movie
captures the essence of the grandeur,
mystery and danger that comprise the
Dark Continent. Every African scene is
utterly compelling and believable,

making the viewer feel the heat of the
desert sun, hear the roar of the lion and
experience the fear of explorers lost
within a virtually unknown land.
As Rafelson caught the core of Africa,
the actors capture the essence of the
characters they play. Patrick Bergin, who
portrays Burton, delivers a resounding
performance as the brilliant adventurer.
Surprisingly, Bergin has previously had
no major roles in film, although his
career will certainly skyrocket from this
base.
lain Glen, who plays Speke, contri

butes admirably with a reserved, yet emo
tionally provoking demeanor that
simultaneously repulses and attracts the
viewer. Speke's courage is inspiring, yet
his ability to turn on a loyal friend tar
nishes his appeal in the viewer's eye.
Although this description may sound
vague, any further elaboration might
detract from the pleasure you'll derive
from watching it first-hand.
Other excellent performances are given
by Fiona Shaw as Burton's wife and Paul
Onsongo as Sidi Bombay, the black guide
for the expeditions and the only person
to traverse Africa from North to South
and East to West. Additionally, Delroy
Lindo compellingly portrays the runaway
slave Mabruki, with whom Burton
develops a touching, tragic friendship.
In retrospect, much more needs to be
said concerning this motion picture in
order to do it justice. Simply put, the
movie is great, the cinematography is
excellent, the acting is superb, and the
plot is provoking. One must marvel at
the lives that these individuals led, and
one must go see this movie.

"Mountains on the Moon" opened in
Los Angeles for an exclusive engagement
on February 23. It opens nationally on
March 23.
