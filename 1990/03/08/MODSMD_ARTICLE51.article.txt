Intermission Recommends
Henry V
Called the new Laurence Olivier, Kenneth
Branagh follows Olivier's lead and turns in an
Academy Award-nominated performance as
well as a nomination for directing in this re
adaptatlon of a Shakespearean classic.
The Hunt For Red October
Though a little slow at the beginning, once
"The Hunt For Red October" gets moving it
almost pulls you down into the heart of
suspense. The most intentionally entertaining
film released since the Oscar crop, it has it all:
Sean Connery, an awe-inspiring visual design,
and a solid plot.
Driving Miss Daisy
Based upon Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize
winning play, "Driving Miss Daisy" offers Oscar
nominated performances by Morgan Freeman,
Jessica Tandy and, believe or not, Dan Aykroyd.
The film Is extremely engaging and is one of
the very best of 1989.
