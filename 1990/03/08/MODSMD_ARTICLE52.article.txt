# Lowe film too 'Bad'
## 
### Chris McKenna 
After watching Rob Lowe on the
screen, it became obvious that this
was unlike anything the former
Brat Packer had ever done before.
Shedding himself of all constraints,
Lowe clearly demonstrated to all
that, although his range is not very
extensive, he was prepared for the
business at hand.
I am referring, of course, to the
infamous "Atlanta Videotape,"
better known as "Youngblood II:
The 'Raw Blow' Story." Unfortu
nately, "Bad Influence," Lowe's
first screen outing since last year's
dabbling in home videos, lacks the
passion and intensity of his last
work.
"Bad Influence" is a bland film
about succumbing to temptation
and then paying the price. James
Spader ("sex, lies and videotape")
gives an uninspiring performance
as the insecure Michael who re
mains unhappy despite a secure
profession and a beautiful fiancee.
Enter, Alex (Lowe), a mysterious
drifter who soon shows Michael
that amorality can solve those
Yuppie-time blues. Alex introduces
Michael to a sinister and lascivious
underside of Los Angeles, and Mi
chael soon becomes entangled in
an orgy of sex and drugs.
The plot thickens when Alex
kills Michael's lover and then at
tempts to frame Michael for the
murder. The result is an an
ticlimactic ending in which Mi
chael must choose between justice
and self-preservation. Unfortu
natelv for him Alex is still a "bad

influence."
Director Curtis Hanson has
remarked that the film "shows a
side to Rob Lowe that we've never
seen before." However, audiences
have literally seen every side of
Lowe, top to bottom, and nothing
in this movie is new.
There's one scene of the movie,
supposedly in the original script,
which is worth mentioning. The
scene consists of Lowe's character
videotaping Michael and a person
of the female persuasion fervently
consummating their lust on a
leather couch. If this is a ploy to
capitalize on Lowe's sexploits, then
all involved should be flogged. Yet,
t seems obvious that this scene
was written into the film before
the Atlanta incident, because dis
tinguishable differences do exist.
For example, the woman in "Bad
Influence" is over the age of 16.
"Bad Influence" is just one of
innumerable movies that call
themselves "psychological thrill
ers." It seems that the only
prerequisites for one of these films
is that it contain at least two
people, sex and a murder, not nec
essarily in that order. A more
suitable term for "Bad Influence"
might be "psychological test," for
it is only successful in measuring
the attention span of the audience.

"Bad Influence" opens nationally
tomorrow.
