# 'Steel' runs cold
## 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
With the advent of modern
films, which often cast a strong
woman as the central character,
women's loics in film are in
creasingly penetrating tradition
ally male storylines. In "Blue
Steel," however, this impact is
lost among the other muddled
themes of the movie.
"Blue Steel" stars Jamie Lee
Curtis as Megan Turner, a cou
rageous, morally self-righteous
rookie police officer. A beautiful
woman, Megan initially
encounters some resistance
from her peers and her father
about her motivations for being
a cop.
Her determination enables
her to override these impede
ments; however, on her first
night on the beat Megan con
fronts an armed grocery store
robber. The robber begins to
turn his weapon on her, and
ihe unloads her revolver directly
into his chest.
This juncture in the movie
marks two developments: the
plot, in which Eugene Hunt, a
psychotic stock trader, picks up
the robber's weapon and escapes
unseen; and the conflict in the
movie between real justice and
'the system," which all cops are
supposed to uphold.
Regarding the plot, there

aren't many surprises. Megan
gets suspended while police in
vestigate her "unlawful use of
deadly force." Hunt, blandly
played by Ron Silver, develops
an obsession for Megan, and
goes on a killing spree using
bullets on which he inscribes
her name. And so on, and so
on, the plot drags until the big
shootout between Megan and
Eugene.
Concerning technical aspects
of the film, director Kathryn
Bigelow creates some effective
imagery, especially with the
vivid sounds of the city.
One wonders if perhaps
Eugene, tormented to insanity
by voices urging him to murder,
is more deserving of sympathy
than Megan. In the final con
frontation, Eugene, out of am
munition and suffering three or
more gunshot wounds, looks up
at Megan helplessly.
As a cop, Megan should arrest
him, but instead she reacts by
following her instincts for
revenge. This detracts from the
portrayal of a woman ready to
assume the burden of upholding
the law, thereby limiting and
muddling the impact of the
movie as a whole.
