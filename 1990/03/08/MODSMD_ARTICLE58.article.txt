# Carnivorous appetites flock to Infirmary
## 
### Sarah Laurence Staff writer 
Beware: St James Infirmary is no place for
the infirm. Anyone suffering from a high
cholesterol level, a puny appetite or
vegetarianism should probably stay away.
For the more adventuresome, though, St.
James Infirmary is perfect for all carnivorous
individuals. Though its burgers are a tribute
to the cattle industry, St. James is primarily a
saloon. And true to the Old West, even the
huge converted barn that houses the tavern
isn't big enough for two outlaws. The number
one bad guy, Red Meat, has thrown his weight
around and scared off any would-be rivals.
With the help of his two sidekicks, Grease and
Salt, he runs the show.
You have to respect a restaurant that dares
to print on the menu, "If it's not ready in 10

minutes, then it'll be ready in 15. If it's not
ready in 15 minutes, then have another beer."
Those unfortunate enough to bear the brand
"UNDER 21 UNTIL 1991" can chomp on
another gold bar of fried mozzerella and con
template the horse-drawn wagons dangling
from the ceiling. Why are there no horses
dangling from the ceiling to draw them? And
if horses could draw, wouldn't they draw gods
that look like horses?
As the manager advised me over the phone,
make sure you're hungry when you go to St.
James. The meat, perfectly cooked, is served
in quantities unheard of since we killed off the
buffalo. The appetizers alone will fill you up,

not to mention the curly fries that come w
the burgers and sandwiches. Across the boa
St. James dishes taste as exquisite as fm
food gets, for reasonably low prices.
St. James Infirmary lacks no amuseme
Multiple television sets offer boxing and b;
ketball in stereo broadcasts. There are al
video games, an old train engine parked
front, traffic signs stuck on the walls and ti
mendous amounts of other stuff. God knoi
where they got all. Judging from the well-woi
furniture and presence of sawdust on the iloo
rowdiness is not unheard of in the wee hour
Mountain View may seem far to go for
burger, but at St. James, a burger, like th
25-foot Wonder Woman statue presiding
one of the rooms, becomes larger than life,

St. James Infirmary is located at 390 Mo/fo
Blvd. in Mountain View.
