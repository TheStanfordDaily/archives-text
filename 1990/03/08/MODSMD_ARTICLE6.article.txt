# Ageless emotion
## Classical collection is little-known treasure 
### Alison Derbenwick 
When people think of classical music
and rare instrument collections, they fre
quently conjure up images of "Amadeus"
and dark, dusty music shops, filled with
the smells of stale rosin and varnish.
But at Stanford, in the Harry R.
Lange Historical Collection of Musical
Instruments and Bows, things are just
a little bit different. Housed in Braun
Music Center, the collection includes

•4% m* ; .m. m.m*. T ▼ *l* :r;. w**w*r
about 370 pieces, stored in a secure,
temperature-and humidity-controlled,
well-lighted room.
? So much for romance and mystery.
But the instruments themselves are
enough to create an, awe-inspiring at
mosphere.
for the most part, they are older than
any living person, and they carry with
them a sense of this timelessness. Many
instruments hang within easy
reach, each uniquely beautiful
with the light reflecting off dif
ferent old woods and varnishes.
Indeed, these instruments seem
to embody what classical music is
all about — ageless emotion ex
pressed through a combination of
musical sounds.
Although it is made up prima
rily of stringed instruments, the
collection includes everything
from viol da gambas and recorders
to a few bass trumpets and trom
bones. There are about 70 violins
alone, representing such makers
as Stradivarius, Stainer and the
Grancinos. There are also many
violin bows, including bows by
Dodd, LaFleur and Peccatte.
The collection does not include
very many common instruments
like B-flat clarinets, flutes and
modern stringed instruments, but
is made up of "oddities that stu

dents don't usually come in con
tact with," said Music Department
lecturer and collection curator
Herbert Myers.
The purpose of the collection is
to give students, faculty and staff

access to instruments that are not
found in normal rental shops, he
added.
The Lange collection began as
a personal collection of violins and
violin bows. Harry Lange made
his first donations to Stanford
anonymously starting in 1956,
but by the late 1950s the collec
tion had been established in his
name. At that time it included
books and catalogs about violins,
as well as the instruments them
selves. In more recent years, the
Lange collection has been aug
mented by other benefactors.
Lange, now living in San Fran
cisco, said that collecting violins
was a hobby. He said that he gave
his collection to Stanford because
he knew that Stanford did not
have a music department in the
1950s and thought that this would
be a good way to "help them out."
Lange said he donated his
violins because he "wanted to
have them used," and added,
"There were too many to have
them just sitting in my house."

Most people are unaware tha
Stanford has a rare instrument
collection, but many of the instru
ments are well-used
"Some [instruments! get play*
all the time, and some of then
don't get played at all," Mye r ,
said.
The Baroque Orchestra f re
quently uses instruments f ron
the collection to create a mor,
authentic sound. Among thos
that are rarely played are high
arched Italian violins and instru
ments that are extensiveli
decorated, because they seem ti
have a stigma attached to them
Myers hopes more of these instru
ments that have a "lesser
gree" will someday be used mop
frequently.
Staff, faculty and students whi
are enrolled in Music Departmen
ensembles or are taking lesion
can borrow the instruments f 0
any length of time, depending 01
their needs. The instrument
must be kept on or arouni
campus.
