IFC officers chosen
Last night, two months
before elections are normally
held, the new Interfraternity
Council officers were elected.
Erik Jorgensen, the present
vice president and Rush chair,
will be the IFC president. Jor
gensen, a junior, is a member
of the Sigma Chi fraternity and
ran unopposed in yesterday's
elections.
The new vice president,
Keith Rabois, is a junior and
a member of the Alpha Epsilon

Pi fraternity. The secretary will
be sophomore Steve Jarrett, a
Sigma Nu fraternity member,
and the treasurer will be junior
Ken Zeitung, a member of
Theta Xi fraternity.
The newly elected officers
will "shadow" the present ex
ecutive board for the next two
months to learn the responsi
bilities of their respective po
sitions, according to Jorgensen.
"The IFC has made a lot of
progress this year," said Jor
gensen. "I just hope to keep it
moving in that direction."
