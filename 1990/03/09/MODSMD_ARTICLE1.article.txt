# USW rejects reforms offered by Webb
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Webb Ranch offered unprece
dented reforms to its workers
yesterday, including a 35 percent
pay increase and the chance for
workers to own their own
homes.
The United Stanford Workers
flatly rejected the reforms. Po
litical Science Prof. John Man
ley, who was at Webb Ranch
when the proposal was an
nounced, said the USW "sum
marily rejected [the proposal] as
so far below anything that they
thought fair."
The negotiations occurred
Tuesday between Webb family
lawyer Terrence O'Connor, USW
field representative Rodney Bar
nette, USW lawyer Jim Eg
gelston and USW president Alan
Wagner.
"I was shocked," O'Connor
said, referring to USW's refusal
of the offer. "It's a hell of a deal."
Webb Ranch proposed that
workers' pay be increased from
$4.25 an hour to $5. Some
workers, such as tractor drivers,
would receive $6 an hour. But
Barnette noted current Webb
pay rates are well below those
of other California farms.
The laborers currently pay 75

cents rent for every hour they
work, but under the proposal of
fered by the ranch, no rent would
be paid. The wage increases and
the rent bonuses add up to $1.50
per hour gained by workers,
which is 35 percent of the cur
rent $4.25 wage level.
But Manley said, "It doesn't
square in my arithmetic. . . .
This whole thing is completely
preposterous."
"The Webbs offered to give the

trailers to the people who now
live in them," O'Connor said.
The Webbs cannot make the
same offer to employees who live
in the University-owned ranch
houses, he noted.
O'Connor said the Webb fam
ily "offered to help renovate cur
rent housing and facilitate the
construction of a new dormitory
for seasonal employees." He said
the offer would allow workers
to "run the housing themselves"

by forming their own coopera
tives and setting internal rules.
But Manley called the housing
"worthless junk" which the
ranch is trying to force on the
workers. He said the housing is
so far beyond repair that "the
Webbs are trying to unload the
housing and get off scot free."
Barnette said the ranch wants
to absolve its responsibility for
housing, and the workers would
"inherit [its] worst problems."
