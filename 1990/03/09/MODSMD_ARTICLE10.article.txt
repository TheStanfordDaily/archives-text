# Happy 105th, Stanford
## 
### David Bianco 
If Sen. Leland Stanford were
alive today, he'd be celebrating
his 166 th birthday — as well
as the 105 th anniversary of the
founding of the University.
Today is Founders' Day,
which commemorates these
two events. The holiday will be
observed on Sunday.
Ceremonies will begin with
church services at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium at 10 a.m. followed
by a procession to the Mauso
leum.
Founders' Day offers gaw
kers a rare opportunity to see
the crypts inside the Mausole
um.
After the procession, Provost
James Rosse and Michael
Roark, one of the Senior Class
presidents, will give brief
speeches. Following their re
marks, refreshments will be
available, and the Mausoleum

will be open to the public.
While this year's ceremonies
will be relatively modest, next
year Founders' Day will be a
weekend-long event in conjunc
tion with the Centennial
Celebration.
Founders' Day was in
stituted in 1906 after the death
of University co-founder Jane
Stanford to commemorate the
birth of the University.
Jane and Leland Stanford of
ficially founded the University
together on March 9, 1885.
Through the 19505, the Uni
versity called off classes on
Founders' Day to allow
students to attend the ceremo
nies, according to Stanford his
torian Roxanne Nilan. She also
pointed out that many people
— including the Centennial
Celebration committee mem
bers — mistakenly refer to the
event as "Founder's Day,"
misplacing the apostrophe.
