Gloria Anzaldua, a Chicana les
bian feminist author who spoke
on campus last night, said
writings by women of color cross
many political boundaries.
Anzaldua delivered the keynote
address for Women's 'Herstory'
Week at Kresge Auditorium,
talking about her experiences as
a woman of color and a writer.
Teri Hopper, coordinator of the
Women's Center, called Anzaldua
"the perfect person" to highlight
the week's issues — women's ex
periences, marginalization and
discovering women's voices.
Anzaldua is author of "Border
lands/La Fronlera: The New Mes
tiza" and editor of "This Bridge
Called My Back: Writings by Radi
cal Women of Color."
She called her writings

autohistorias-teorias and ex
plained, "When women of color
started writing, it was about our
personal histories. But behind the
self is an I that is plural — it is
more than me that I am talking
about."
"Historia," the Spanish word
for history, can also mean story,
Anzaldua said. "The borders be
tween fact and fiction, memories
and imagination, have a way of
being blurred."
Similarly, Anzaldua said
writings by women of color cross
the traditional boundary between
analytical and creative genres, and
are thus a way of resisting and
transcending Western literary
conventions.
Frances Morales, director of El
Centro Chicano, introduced An
zaldua, saying, "She has taught
us to defy the system, to listen
to our voices and write."
