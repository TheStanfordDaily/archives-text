## Bush introduces new transportation policy 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush announced a national transpor
tation policy yesterday that would cost
travelers more and increase local gov
ernments' share in meeting air, land
and sea travel needs into the next
century.
Just as the Model T and the Wright
brothers' plane "prepared the way for
today's millions of cars and thousands
of passenger jets, so it is now our turn
to invest in America's future," Bush
said in unveiling the policy with Trans
portation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
Bush said it would help keep Amer
ica"the world leader in transporta
tion "
The 129-page plan, "Moving Amer
ica Into The 21st Century," calls for
more toll roads, local gas taxes, user
fees, private investments, competition,
deregulation, research into futuristic
systems and openness to foreign air
carriers as well as increased attention
to safety and protection of the envi
ronment.
The policy was hailed as an impor
tant step by some industry groups,
but most expressed some disappoint
ment, and Democratic members of
Congress were critical.
Aviation and ground transportation
groups opposed "user fees" and other
taxes that Skinner acknowledged
would require travelers to pay more.
The American Public Transit Associ
ation said the policy was "long on ad
vice and short on help" from the
federal government.
Rep. Norman Mineta, I)-Calif.,
chairman of the House surface trans
portation subcommittee, called it "a
good start" but said shifting programs
to the state and local level without
financial resources "would be the shift
and the shaft."
Bush did not immediately field ques
tions on the proposal, leaving Skinner
to face news media.
The secretary, who had the policy
drawn up after holding 117 hearings
across the country, justified proposals
for increases in local gasoline taxes
and fees by saying polls show that
people are willing to pay if they get
improvements.
Skinner denied the policy represents
a shift of responsiblity for transpor
tation away from the federal govern

ment, saying it was an attempt to
"strike a balance" after years in which
the federal government has assumed
"almost all of the responsibility" for
funding some transportation systems.
"The federal commitment to infra
structure and to transportation will
continue to be at a very high level,"

he said, adding that federal transpor
tation budgets are expected to increase
each year.
"It is not the panacea or the answer
to all of the problems in transporta
tion," said Skinner. "It was never de
signed to be that."
The plan outlines no major federal

programs not already called for in the
president's budget request.
Its overall goal is to maintain the
U.S. transportation system as "the
finest in the world." However, the
report said "there are increasing signs
. . . that the system is beginning to
break down."
