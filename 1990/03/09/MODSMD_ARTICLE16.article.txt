HAVING HALF OF a basket
ball team in foul trouble
would have most coaches
pulling their hair out. So why
doesn't anyone seem worried that
half of the ASSU senate is on the
verge of expulsion for lack of at
tendance?
Nineteen of the 37 senators have
missed four or more senate meet
ings, to say nothing of required
committee meetings where attend
ance is more haphazardly recorded.
According to the ASSU Bylaws,
a senator can be expelled after
missing five senate and/or commit
tee meetings in one quarter. The
rules also allow for probation and
suspension for fewer absences.
Yet not even the elected senators
w : ho haven't shown up once are
likely to be thrown out. Neither
are the four senators who are no
longer registered students.
This is because the ASSU
realizes that enforcing its own

rules would result in so many
senators being expelled that the
financially-strapped student gov
ernment would have to run new
elections to fill all the vacancies
for the rest of the year.
The sad result of this situation
is that the ASSU has given tacit
consent to massive absenteeism
and undermined its own effective
ness. What student can believe in
a representative body that must be
just barely making quorum each
meeting?
The remaining senators need to
address this problem now to
prevent a new group of no-shows
from being elected next quarter.
Apparently the student body
made some poor choices in last
year's ASSU senate elections, but
it is the ASSU that must revise
its Bylaws so that it can maintain
some sort of adequate organiza
tional standards without bringing
about financial self-destruction.
