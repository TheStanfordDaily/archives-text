# Grad funds resume
## 
### 
The administration is
listening.
Last week graduate stu
dent concerns were brought to the
Studies anounced that it wilt
resume granting research assis
tantships to qualified graduate stu
dents doing summer research.
The administration previously
took this privelege away from grad
uate students because a number
of past students who had received
these funds admitted that they did
not perform any research.
However, this problem will be
taken care of with a proviso which
states that students must submit
a detailed written review of their

research upon returning the fol
lowing autumn quarter.
A great deal of credit for reviving
mittee Tliis' group worked hard in
order to reestablish the positions,
and in doing so it successfully rep
resented the concerns of many
graduate students.
As one member of the committee
pointed out, this positive outcome
shows what can happen when stu
dents, faculty and the administra
tion work together to accomodate
student concerns.
We can only hope that the ad
ministration continues to listen
when such concerns are voiced.
