MEChA doesn't represent concerns of community

WE, THE UNDERSIGNED, are
active members of the Chi
cano/Latino and greater Stan
ford community. Many of us are
former residents of Casa Zapata.
We would like to respond to a letter
printed in the March 7 Daily entitled
"Chicano Community is forging posi
tive future for all." This letter claimed
that The Stanford Review's recent
articles documenting MEChA's tactics
of harassment toward non-MEChA
Chicanos were false.
The letter went on to state that by
printing the articles, The Review had
"offered an uninformed and negatively
biased view which adversely affects the
building of a multicultural university."
Finally, this letter claimed that the
Stanford Chicano/Latino community
was "strong and united" and enjoying
"a renewed spirit of involvement in the
community."
We would like to politely refute these
assertions.

First, The Review articles which
detail how, over the last two years,
MEChA has harassed Chicano/Latino
students who disagree with their tac
tics and ideology are absolutely true.
Non-MEChA students have been physi
cally encircled and verbally abused.
Second, although we are usually not
fans of The Review because its political
beliefs are much more conservative
than our own, we applaud its decision
to investigate and publish these stories.
For too long MEChA's harassment
has gone unreported, allowing the
types of harassment MEChA employs
to escalate. Contrary to the letter's
assertions, The Review, unlike The
Daily, is not uninformed but quite
informed.
Finally, we would like to comment
on the letter's statement that the
Chicano/Latino community is "strong
and united." For three years, there has
been a major split in the the communi

ty. The split occurred when large
numbers of students began to disagree
with MEChA's strong-arm tactics. We
still continue to disagree strongly with
MEChA.
So how can MEChA state that the
community is "strong and united"
when there are large numbers of Chi
cano/Latino students who state that
there is a division? This statement can
only make sense if MEChA considers
those students who disagree with its
tactics as non-Chicanos. In other
words, if MEChA excludes dissenting
students from membership in the
Chicano/Latino community, then of
course there will be no division.
This is a disturbing thought. Un
fortunately, this is what MEChA has
done in the past. MEChA has consis
tently labeled students that disagree
with its position as "assimilated,"
"sellouts" or even worse, "CHUMPS"
(which stands for Chicano Upwardly
Mobile Professionals).

In fact, MEChA has alienated so
many Chicano/Latino students at Stan
ford that the vast majority of Chi
cano/Latino students have nothing to
do with MEChA. According to the
University Committee on Minority
Affairs' report, only 15.2 percent of
Chicano/Latino students have ever
participated in any way whatsoever in
a MEChA event. This is in comparison
to 53.4 percent of black students who
have participated at one point in the
Black Student Union.
Thus, it is with some irony that we
read the statement that MEChA ex
tends "a warm welcome to everyone to
become involved during this exciting
period in our community," when in the
past and present MEChA has engaged
in activities that have not only made
us feel unwelcome but downright
intimidated.
