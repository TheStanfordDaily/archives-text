# Reality is more than fairy tale at Webb Ranch
## 
### 
This is a true story. There once was
a happy farm where the farmer's fam
ily worked hard to grow especially
tasty fruits and vegetables, and every
one around made special trips to buy
them. The farmer hired helpers to
grow and harvest these strawberries,
zucchini and pumpkins.
He even provided housing for the
helpers. The housing was in a beauti
ful, clean, roomy country setting. The
helpers invited their friends and rela
tives to share their housing, and they
were happy to accept, even though

they did not work on the farm.
The helpers no longer had to move
from job to job, as various crops re
quired, because the farmer found alter
native work for them to do in
j Jandscaping for a neighbor at off-peak
times. Some helpers said they felt
lucky to raise their children in this
environment.
One day a union person came to the
farm. Then the helpers said — al
though illegally in this land — that
they should have the same legal rights
as legal citizens, specifically minimum
wages. The union person said they
should be paid more money so that the
union could have some of it for dues.
This would help to pay the salary of
the union person.
Government inspectors looked at the
helpers' housing and said that it was
superior to other helpers' housing

areas nearby. But there were a few
problems: toilets were shared, latches
were broken and I think the television
wiring needed improvements. The hel
pers could not fix these things, so the
farmer fixed them.
But the farmer could not do this
work because he now had a lot of
meetings to attend — meetings with
the helpers, meetings with the union
person and meetings with other people
who just dropped in to offer their
opinions. So he said the helpers should
choose another place to live.
Then the farmer's landlord said he
couldn't do any work either because he
had to go to the meetings too. The
landlord planned to build large build
ings on the farm.
So the helpers had to move to
houses in the city which cost more
rent, the workers' children could not

play in the country after school, the
farmer did not have a farm any more,
the neighbors no longer had their spe
cial fruits and vegetables, the town lost
its beautiful open space and the
landlord lost his rent from the farmer.
But the union person lived happily
ever after because the union had more
money from the new union members.
At Webb Ranch, truth is stranger
than fiction.
