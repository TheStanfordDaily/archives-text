The Faculty Senate voted
yesterday to support the Webb
Ranch workers in their current
labor negotiations.
The proposal, written by
Law School Prof. Miguel Men
dez, calls for "a fair and equi
table settlement [between the
workers and the Webbsj, in
cluding provisions acceptable
to the workers for the improve
ment and maintenance of
housing," to be reached as soon
as possible.

rented to ranch employees,
which consists of "long wooden
sheds with no insulation,
divided into partitions in which

On Monday, University
President Donald Kennedy —

working conditions at the
ranch, in favor of Mendezs sub

"When the petition was first
circulated, the appointment of a
committee seemed a good idea,"
he said. However, in light of recent
developments, he said he felt an
investigation at this time could
interfere with current labor nego
tiations.
Faculty debated the phrase
"provisions acceptable to the
workers." Opponents argued that
it was too general and did not
offer a concrete standard.
Although several senators sug
gested alternatives to the phrase,
including "acceptable housing"
and "housing that meets accept
able community standards for
farm labor," the senate voted each
time to preserve the original wor
ding of the proposal.
