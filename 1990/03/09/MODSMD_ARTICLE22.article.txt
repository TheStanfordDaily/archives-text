## Don't just say no to drugs 
### 
SO IF YOU'RE at a party and some
body offers you drugs, what do you
say?
Is it, "Sorry, but I refuse to contribute
to the illegal trafficking of controlled sub
stances and adversely affect the less
privileged classes of our society," or do
you just say, "No"?
Do you say, "Thanks, but one day I
may have to go before a Senate confir
mation committee," or do you say "No,
thank you"?
Maybe you say, "Yes."
Whatever your response, don't decline
because you're supposed to say "no."
If you refuse, do it because you're
making a reasoned, rational decision
about breaking the law and about what
you'll be putting into your bloodstream
for a few hours or perhaps have sitting
at the base of your spinal column for the
. rest of your -life.
Most of all, be sure that you don't
"just say no," because implicit in the
"just say no" slogan is the advice to speak
without thinking and to do what you're
told and not ask any questions because
it's for your own good. A good way to
picture this is to imagine William Bennett
in a T-shirt that says, "Because I'm the
Drug Czar, that's why."
If it were my decision to make, I'd
have a "just give it some thought" cam
paign. It's not quite as catchy, but it
certainly shows more confidence in the
American public's ability to make
reasoned decisions. On the other hand,
I'm not surprised that our politicians
want us to act without thinking, as that's
generally what they depend on to get

elected in the first place.
Moving right along, if you are going
to try drugs, do it now while you're still
in college. You see, even if you do one
day have to get up before the Senate and
divulge all the sordid details of each and
every hedonistic experience you've ever
had, you have access right here and now
to the ultimate all-purpose excuse: "I was
in college."
Let's face it folks, what do you call
someone who gets drunk, sleeps around
and often doesn't wake up before noon?
In many situations you wouldn't call
them at all — you'd just hope they found
themselves a good therapist and a better
rehab program. In the collegiate world,
however, you might call such a character
your roommate, your friend or — flaunt
ing your lack of creativity — a nice per
son.
Ladies and gentleman, this offer is good
for a limited time only. Years from now
these foibles will earn you the labels of
drunkard, adulterer and good-for-nothing
sluggard, but for the time being they are
perfectly legitimate indulgences.
I'm not advising that you abuse this
privilege, though. "Just give it some
thought" works both ways: It's permis
sion to satiate an appetitive nature, but
it doesn't excuse you from being respon
sible about what you ingest, inject or
inhale.
So don't rush off to the city for free
hypodermic needles, and don't canvass
door-to-door looking to get "taste spoons"
at a crack house.
And for goodness sake don't take an
intellectual tack and rationalize that

Samuel Coleridge wrote while on opium,
and Hunter Thompson wrote while on
just about everything else.
I may be stating the obvious here, but
1 think you'd be making a mistake by
indulging haphazardly and/or becoming
an addict; keep in mind that Coleridge
is dead, and by all logical standards
Thompson should be.
"But," you say, "we've landed ourselves
upon quite a slippery slope in that by
sampling drugs, one risks addiction."
I agree — and the same thing is true
with food, alcohol, shopping and sex. It's
a question of use versus abuse: Vice is
nice as long as you keep it in moderation.
Honestly, if you've got no self-control,
you're going to land yourself in trouble
with or without drugs.
And I have real trouble with the socie
tal guilt trip: The fact that drugs are a
bigger problem among the poor is more
a reflection on a problem with poverty
than with drugs. Treating a symptom is
nice and all, but I think we'd be better
off curing the disease.
So, if the opportunity presents itself,
don't be so fast to balk at a new expe
rience just because the government — or
anybody else — tells you to.
Remember, anything to excess is dan
gerous — even abstinence.

with or without drugs.
And I have real trouble with the socie
tal guilt trip: The fact that drugs are a
bigger problem among the poor is more
a reflection on a problem with poverty
than with drugs. Treating a symptom is
nice and all, but I think we'd be better
off curing the disease.
So, if the opportunity presents itself,
don't be so fast to balk at a new expe
rience just because the government — or
anybody else — tells you to.
Remember, anything to excess is dan
gerous — even abstinence.
