White feminists
must consider
cultural contexts
As an African-American woman, I
was greatly disturbed by the reaction
of many white feminists toward Corey
Davis' column, "Power to Black Wom
en."
Over the past two days I have heard
many white feminists accuse Davis of
sexism in his column. They claim that
he has objectified African-American
women by glorifying their physical
traits.
In doing so these feminists have
essentially imposed their white-middle
class brand of feminism onto the
African-American experience. This Eu
rocentric frame of reference can in no
way speak for the experiences of black
women.
Based on my experiences as an
African-American woman, I saw Davis'
column not as sexist or as an objec
tification of my body, but rather as a

tribute to and empowerment of the
black woman.
In a sense, he used the black wom
an's body, which has historically been
devalued by white society's standards,
as a metaphor for her personal and
social power.
Davis' "power to the bootie" refer
ence must be seen in its historical con
text. Big hips, kinky hair and broad
noses have always been considered
unattractive by "mainstream" America.
By holding black beauty in high es
teem, Davis is making a radical state
ment against America's racist beauty
standards.
These white feminists have taken
Davis' tribute to black womanhood,
with its unique history of empower
ment, and looked at it from their own
culturally narrow perspective.
This same cultural ignorance has
historically alienated black women from
working with the white feminist move
ment. Differences between white and
black cultures must be acknowledged.
For instance, many white feminists
took offense at Davis' tribute to the
black woman's physical traits because
in white society most attention to the

female body has been derogatory and
crippling. This is tied up with the
myth of female powerlessness that
pervades white America.
In Africa-American culture, however,
black women have always worked
alongside men. Therefore acknowledge
ment of their physical traits has not
been used to make them feel physically
weak and powerless.
Instead, white Americans' interpreta
tions of the African-American woman's
traits have been used to make her feel
unattractive and unworthy of attention
or praise. So Davis' tribute to the
"power of the bootie" takes on an en
tirely different meaning when looked at
from a black perspective.
The white feminist movement needs
to show some respect for African-
American women's opinions. Black
women can determine for themselves
what is offensive and what isn't. We
understand our own history and view
every situation from an African-
American as well as a female perspec
tive.

University should
consider state
recommendations
After reading Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole's statements defending her
actions in dealing with rape victims, I
find it impossible to sit quietly and
ignore the fallacy and injustice that
has taken place.
"Nina," the woman in the first arti
cle of The Daily's Feb. 26-28 series on
acquaintance rape, was clearly raped
according to the legal definition of
rape.
It is plain that a rape occurred if
the man involved had intercourse with
Nina while she was intoxicated — thus
unable to give any worthy consent —
and he was reasonably aware of this.
In Nina's case, Cole ignores the law.
I ask students to question whether
Sally Cole is qualified to serve students
in the capacity of a Judicial Affairs
officer when in one of the most sensi
tive types of cases — rape — she has

proven unable.
In order to prevent mishandlings of
rape cases like the one mentioned here,
I ask that students demand that Stan
ford recognize California Assembly
Concurrent Resolution No. 46, which
resolves, among other things, that "all
institutions of higher education in the
state should establish and utilize clear
and consistent sexual assault policies
which may be incorporated into the
current disciplinary policies of each
campus ..." and "that all institutions
of higher education . . . provide all
freshman students and dormitory, fra
ternity and sorority residents with
information or annual seminars that
include, but are not limited to the
following: 1) the legal definition of
rape, 2) student, acquaintance and
gang rape statistics and 3) penalties for
rape . . ."
This document was received from the
Assembly California Legislature by the
Office of the President, Residential
Education and the Office of the Dean
of Student Affairs in 1987.
