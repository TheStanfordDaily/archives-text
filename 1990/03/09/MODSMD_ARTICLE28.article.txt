## No dogs allowed Frats' canines kicked off campus 
### 
March 5, 1938
The Stanford Daily
During finals week, the Univer
sity Controller's Office ordered
dogs owned bv seven fraternities
off the campus. Asst. Controller
A.L. Trowbridge gave several
reasons for the new policy, which
prohibited any student group or
individual from keeping a dog on
campus.
The main reason was "the con
tinuous risk of the dogs getting
rabies and biting someone." In
addition, the dogs were accused
of "continually fighting in the li
brary," "molesting" professors in
the Quad and "wandering into
classes, yawning and wandering
out."

"Siggie," the canine mascot of
the Alpha Sig house, who had
spent three years on the Farm,
had no comment on the new
policy. Neither did "Tammany,"
"Napoleon," "Duke," "Hester,"
"Kappie" or the nameless Great
Dane who lived in the Beta house.
If the University plans to re
move everyone who wanders into
class, yawns and wanders out, I
know a number of economics
majors who are in big trouble.
Not to mention half the freshmen
in any given CIV lecture. Of
course, these students rarely
molest professors in the Quad, so
maybe they can stay.

Stanford created the new posi
tion of provost to serve as the

second-highest-ranked adminis
trator of the University, to assist
the president in guiding the di
rection of academic affairs and to
act as president when the presi
dent is away from campus.
So that's what the provost does!
I've always wondered.
March 6, 1962
The Stanford Daily
Stanford University adminis
trators decided to discontinue the
Geography Department after the
two professors who taught
courses in the department decided
to retire. Other reasons for drop
ping the department included fi
nancial considerations and the
feeling that geography was "not
a strong discipline", across the
country. In addition, administra
tors noted that Harvard had
dropped its geography program a
few years before.
I'll agree that geography' isn't
a strong discipline in America. In
fact, in a recent survey six out of
ten Americans could not find the
"You are here" arrow on a shop
ping center map and only two out
of ten could correctly answer the
question, "What state are the
Hawaiian Islands a part of?" But
dropping a department because
Harvard did ? I mean just because
those snobs in Connecticut . . . no
wait, Rhode Island . . . no . . . well
anyway, just because those snobs
on the East Coast dropped a de
partment is no reason not to study
geography here. Wherever that is.
Well, after over a year of search
ing through back issues of The
Daily hoping to find details of the
ugliest man contest, the Roble frog
hunt and the many other high
lights of Stanford history, my days
of writing This Week in Stanford
History are done. Don't worry,
TWISH will go on. But as for me
... I'm history.
