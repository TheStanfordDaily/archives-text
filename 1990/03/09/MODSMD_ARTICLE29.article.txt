# To prevent freezing to death, take off your clothes
## 
### Bryan Cooperrider Staff writer 
Unlike the last five years, we
seem to have gotten a lot of snow
this winter. I suppose that fact
didn't really escape anybody's at
tention unless you're a
math/science graduate student
who hibernates in the basement
of Green library during winter
quarter. But it just occurred to
me that with all this news of
snowstorms in the mountains, I
haven't actually seen any snow
this year.
My favorite part of skiing is
riding the chair lifts, because
that's where you can look cool
even if you're a terrible skier,
which I am. You can meet some
pretty nifty people on those rides.
I met one guy who said one thing
during the entire 17 minutes and
28 seconds of the ride. He stared
at me and muttered, "The snow
used to be so pure, so pure . . .
Now they even find pollutants in

the snow at the North Pole." For
a minute I was worried he'd seen
me peeing in the snow before I
got on the lift.
It took me a while to figure out
why the little colorful geometric
figures were tacked on the trees
at the top of each run. I assumed
the symbols were indicators of
food prices at the snack bar near
the bottom of the slope. For ex
ample, the black diamond meant
you could hock your wedding ring
for a double cheesburger and a
small coke. The fries, of course,
are extra. After skiing three runs
named "Mogul Madness," "Dag
ger Ridge" and "Bloody Basin," I
suggested to a Grizzly Adams
look-alike (who appeared to be
wearing the bear) at the chairlift
that they should change the sym
bol to a red cross — as an in
dicator of the services offered at
the bottom of the slope. He just
shook his shovel at me.
Send me your silly questions! You
can:

1. Drop your questions off at
The Daily in the box outside the
front office,
2. Send e-mail to BUG-ME on
LOTS,
3. Send your questions via
"support-the-postal-service
spend-25-cents" mail to Bug Me,
The Stanford Daily, Storke Bldg.,
Stanford, CA, 94305, or
4. Tape the question to your
forehead and wander around
campus until I happen to see you.
Don't do this on a rainy day be
cause I generally skip class.
Dear Bug,
Cross-country (Nordic) skiing is
the awesomest sport around today.
Does Stanford have an cross
country ski team ? It has just about
everything else.
- Dr. Bob
This is an easy one: yes.
Dear Bug,
Do the snowmakers on ski

slopes blow out snow or spit out
little droplets of water that freeze
as they come down?
— Mike Perozek
The National Weather Service
requires ski resorts to apply for
a permit before tampering with
the local weather patterns. Nat
urally, this process falls under the
Forecasting Service branch of the
National Weather Service. There
have been a few screw-ups of late
concerning the dispersion of
weather conditions. For example,
just recently Florida received a bit
of frost when the city of Barstow
in southern California put in a
request for nippy weather and
mistakenly omitted the "s."
P.S. By the way, Mike, a freez
ing night in Antarctica is about

the only place where you can
throw water in the air and have
it land as snow.
Dear Bug,
I'm going on a ski trip with
some friends, and I was wonder
ing if it was true that the best
treatment for hypothermia is
taking off all your clothes and
getting in a sleeping bag together ?
— John
I'm afraid I'm not qualified to
answer this question, so I took
the liberty of sending this one to
the Science Bug — look for it next
week in the science section of The
Daily. My roommate, however, in
forms me that this has actually
happened to him, and neither one
of them got hypothermia.
