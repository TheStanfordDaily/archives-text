# Stitching the ties that bind
## Office of Development strives to make rich friends

Editor's note: This is the second of a two-part series
examining the University's billion-dollar Centennial
Campaign.

Pretend you're rich.
No, pretend you are really rich, so loaded that if
you had the desire to donate money to Stanford,
the line on your check would barely be long enough
to hold all the zeros.
And if it ever does happen to you, University
fund-raisers will probably know about it and will
come knock on your door.
The process fund-raising offices in the Universi
ty's various schools use to target potential donors
and to encourage contributions — especially large
ones — is lengthy, relatively simple and very inter
personal.
It all starts immediately after you graduate. The
Office of Development tracks alumni careers, largely
by extracting data from published sources and
hearing news from alumni friends.
Fund-raisers also periodically examine contribu
tions to the annual fund — the $12 million pool
to which alumni are asked every year to contribute
a small sum — to determine whose gifts are
gradually increasing.
Not all rm\jor donations come from alumni. Ac
tually, only about one-fourth do. The rest are derived

from corporations, foundations and non-alumni who
usually, however, have some connection to the Uni
versity.
Loose connections
For example, one of the most generous donors
ever to give to Stanford was Cecil Green, former
chair of the Texas Instruments Corp. and namesake
of the University's largest library. Green's only link
to the University was that, in his early career, he
worked for a semiconductor firm in Palo Alto and
made casual acquaintances with Stanford faculty
and researchers.
If you are targeted as a potentially major donor,
the Office of Development will send a volunteer
representative to meet with you once a year from
either its main office in Encina Hall or from branch
offices in Southern California and New York.
The purpose of such visits is to build close rela
tionships between the potential donor and the Uni
versity, according to David Fulton, deputy to the
vice president of development, and to find out in
what ways the donor wishes to help the University.
Such a relationship takes persistence. "For a large
gift, we go one-on-one with a donor over a period
of time," Fulton said. "It often takes years."
"It's a long cultivation," said John Wirth, vice
provost for academic planning and development.
"The prospect and a volunteer (from the Office of
