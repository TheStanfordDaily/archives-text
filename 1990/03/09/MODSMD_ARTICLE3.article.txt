# Stitching the ties that bind
## Office of Development strives to make rich friends 
### Jason Bloomstein Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the second of a two-part series
examining the University's billion-dollar Centennial
Campaign.

Pretend you're rich.
No, pretend you are really rich, so loaded that if
you had the desire to donate money to Stanford,
the line on your check would barely be long enough
to hold all the zeros.
And if it ever does happen to you, University
fund-raisers will probably know about it and will
come knock on your door.
The process fund-raising offices in the Universi
ty's various schools use to target potential donors
and to encourage contributions — especially large
ones — is lengthy, relatively simple and very inter
personal.
It all starts immediately after you graduate. The
Office of Development tracks alumni careers, largely
by extracting data from published sources and
hearing news from alumni friends.
Fund-raisers also periodically examine contribu
tions to the annual fund — the $12 million pool
to which alumni are asked every year to contribute
a small sum — to determine whose gifts are
gradually increasing.
Not all rm\jor donations come from alumni. Ac
tually, only about one-fourth do. The rest are derived

from corporations, foundations and non-alumni who
usually, however, have some connection to the Uni
versity.
Loose connections
For example, one of the most generous donors
ever to give to Stanford was Cecil Green, former
chair of the Texas Instruments Corp. and namesake
of the University's largest library. Green's only link
to the University was that, in his early career, he
worked for a semiconductor firm in Palo Alto and
made casual acquaintances with Stanford faculty
and researchers.
If you are targeted as a potentially major donor,
the Office of Development will send a volunteer
representative to meet with you once a year from
either its main office in Encina Hall or from branch
offices in Southern California and New York.
The purpose of such visits is to build close rela
tionships between the potential donor and the Uni
versity, according to David Fulton, deputy to the
vice president of development, and to find out in
what ways the donor wishes to help the University.
Such a relationship takes persistence. "For a large
gift, we go one-on-one with a donor over a period
of time," Fulton said. "It often takes years."
"It's a long cultivation," said John Wirth, vice
provost for academic planning and development.
"The prospect and a volunteer (from the Office of
Development) gradually assess the
needs of the institution and the
interests of the donor."
Building relationships
Fund-raisers say they often
garner strong friendships with
targeted alumni, but all the while
there is no misrepresentation of
the University's purposes.
"We build close relationships
and lifelong friendships, but
nobody is ever under any illu
sion," Fulton said.
Development officers count on
school deans to help in the fund
raising effort. Mary Cloutier, sec
retary to Engineering Dean
James Gibbons, estimated that
Gibbons spends at least one
fourth of his time involved in
matters related to fund raising.
Often, when he flies off to con
ferences and meetings, develop
ment officers call Gibbons and
arrange for him to schedule meet
ings with major donors who live
in locations he is visiting.
Even when he receives visitors
in his office, Gibbons is asked to
bring up the subject of donations
to the University, said Cloutier.
Charles Sizemore, development
officer for the Graduate School of
Business, said Business School
Dean Robert Jaedicke's position
on the boards of several corpora
tions allows him the opportunity
to solicit donations when attend
ing corporate board functions.
Faculty gets involved
While potential donors are
being solicited, University faculty
are writing proposals requesting
use of some of the donated money.

The process by which they submit
requests of more than $100,000
involves a large group of reviewers
and is a method uncommon in
other schools, Wirth said.
Such requests are submitted to
what is called the "Green Folders
Committee." Committee mem
bers confer with officials in the
Provost's Office to consider the
academic merit of the proposals.
The provost's staff then sits
down with development officers
to consider the practicality of the
proposals.
"By the end of the afternoon,
we have a good idea of what we
want and what we need to get,"
Wirth said.
Finally, after what often become
years of periodic talks, donors are
asked for a contribution.
gift givers receive a letter from
University President Donald Ken
nedy and are honored at a special
dinner party with campus admin
istrators, which Fulton describes
as a "warm occasion."
Size of check matters
Donors who endow a professor
ship meet the faculty who will fill
the chair and receive copies of the
professor's publications.
Once the celebrations of grati
tude are over, however, the proc
ess is not through.
The Office of Development con
tinues tracking the careers of
major donors, assessing their in
terests in hopes of future contri
butions.
Not all solicitations and thanks
from the University are as per
sonal as yearly visits and dinners
with administrators. Those are
reserved for the upper-end do
nors, Fulton said.
"With 125,000 alumni, it's not
possible to be personal with all of
them," he said.

the line on your check would barely be long enough
to hold all the zeros.
And if it ever does happen to you, University
fund-raisers will probably know about it and will
come knock on your door.
The process fund-raising offices in the Universi
ty's various schools use to target potential donors
and to encourage contributions — especially large
ones — is lengthy, relatively simple and very inter
personal.
It all starts immediately after you graduate. The
Office of Development tracks alumni careers, largely
by extracting data from published sources and
hearing news from alumni friends.
Fund-raisers also periodically examine contribu
tions to the annual fund — the $12 million pool
to which alumni are asked every year to contribute
a small sum — to determine whose gifts are
gradually increasing.
Not all rm\jor donations come from alumni. Ac
tually, only about one-fourth do. The rest are derived

from corporations, foundations and non-alumni who
usually, however, have some connection to the Uni
versity.
Loose connections
For example, one of the most generous donors
ever to give to Stanford was Cecil Green, former
chair of the Texas Instruments Corp. and namesake
of the University's largest library. Green's only link
to the University was that, in his early career, he
worked for a semiconductor firm in Palo Alto and
made casual acquaintances with Stanford faculty
and researchers.
If you are targeted as a potentially major donor,
the Office of Development will send a volunteer
representative to meet with you once a year from
either its main office in Encina Hall or from branch
offices in Southern California and New York.
The purpose of such visits is to build close rela
tionships between the potential donor and the Uni
versity, according to David Fulton, deputy to the
vice president of development, and to find out in
what ways the donor wishes to help the University.
Such a relationship takes persistence. "For a large
gift, we go one-on-one with a donor over a period
of time," Fulton said. "It often takes years."
"It's a long cultivation," said John Wirth, vice
provost for academic planning and development.
"The prospect and a volunteer (from the Office of
Development) gradually assess the
needs of the institution and the
interests of the donor."
Building relationships
Fund-raisers say they often
garner strong friendships with
targeted alumni, but all the while
there is no misrepresentation of
the University's purposes.
"We build close relationships
and lifelong friendships, but
nobody is ever under any illu
sion," Fulton said.
Development officers count on
school deans to help in the fund
raising effort. Mary Cloutier, sec
retary to Engineering Dean
James Gibbons, estimated that
Gibbons spends at least one
fourth of his time involved in
matters related to fund raising.
Often, when he flies off to con
ferences and meetings, develop
ment officers call Gibbons and
arrange for him to schedule meet
ings with major donors who live
in locations he is visiting.
Even when he receives visitors
in his office, Gibbons is asked to
bring up the subject of donations
to the University, said Cloutier.
Charles Sizemore, development
officer for the Graduate School of
Business, said Business School
Dean Robert Jaedicke's position
on the boards of several corpora
tions allows him the opportunity
to solicit donations when attend
ing corporate board functions.
Faculty gets involved
While potential donors are
being solicited, University faculty
are writing proposals requesting
use of some of the donated money.

The process by which they submit
requests of more than $100,000
involves a large group of reviewers
and is a method uncommon in
other schools, Wirth said.
Such requests are submitted to
what is called the "Green Folders
Committee." Committee mem
bers confer with officials in the
Provost's Office to consider the
academic merit of the proposals.
The provost's staff then sits
down with development officers
to consider the practicality of the
proposals.
"By the end of the afternoon,
we have a good idea of what we
want and what we need to get,"
Wirth said.
Finally, after what often become
years of periodic talks, donors are
asked for a contribution.
gift givers receive a letter from
University President Donald Ken
nedy and are honored at a special
dinner party with campus admin
istrators, which Fulton describes
as a "warm occasion."
Size of check matters
Donors who endow a professor
ship meet the faculty who will fill
the chair and receive copies of the
professor's publications.
Once the celebrations of grati
tude are over, however, the proc
ess is not through.
The Office of Development con
tinues tracking the careers of
major donors, assessing their in
terests in hopes of future contri
butions.
Not all solicitations and thanks
from the University are as per
sonal as yearly visits and dinners
with administrators. Those are
reserved for the upper-end do
nors, Fulton said.
"With 125,000 alumni, it's not
possible to be personal with all of
them," he said.
