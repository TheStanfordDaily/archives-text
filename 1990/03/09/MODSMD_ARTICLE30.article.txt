## Tough Cardinal D downs Ducks 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Last night, the Cardinal played the
kind of game it cannot play in the up
coming NCAA tournament.
Yet, despite turning in its worst
shooting performance of the season,
second-ranked Stanford was still good
enough to beat Oregon handily 75-45
before 2,506 spectators in Maples Pa
vilion.

In winning its sixth consecutive game,
the Cardinal upped its season record to
26-1, 16-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play.
The Ducks slipped to 17-11, 9-8.
None of Stanford's top six players
shot over 50 percent, as the team com
bined to make just 31 of 87 field goal
attempts. In shooting just .356 percent
from the floor, the Cardinal posted its
worst mark since a .352 performance
at Washington last season.
Defensively, however, Stanford was on
top of its game. Mixing in full-court
pressure with a half-court trap, the Car
dinal forced the Ducks into 25 turn
overs. Add in 19 points from Jennifer
Azzi, and Stanford was able to overcome
Oregon.
"That was the hardest 30 point win
we've ever had," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "I credit our defense
with the win."
Stanford had to do it without the ball
because, when the Cardinal had it, they
had trouble putting it in the goal. In
the first half, the team hit a mere 14
of 45 attempts and scored 31 points.
The total matched the team's season
low for a half set at Oregon in January.
Katy Steding was 1 of 9 in the opening
20 minutes and 3 of 14 on the night.
"It was frustrating," she said of all the
missed shots. "|But| we'll come back,
and I'll come back."
The biggest reason for Stanford's
shooting problem was 6-foot-7 Oregon
center Stefanie Kasperski. The Pac-10's
tallest player not only led the Ducks

with 14 points and 10 rebounds, but
she also blocked six shots. "Six?" Van-
Derveer said, "It seemed like she had 66.
"Kasperski is extremely disruptive to
any inside game," she added. The Ducks
further confounded the Cardinal with
a zone defense. "We don't play against
any zones because of our outside shoot
ing," VanDerveer noted.
Typically, Stanford can bomb away
from the perimeter and render the zone
impotent. Last night, the Cardinal's
shots weren't falling from anywhere.
With a 31-23 halftime lead, Stanford
faced a challenge on its home court for
the first time in a long while. As she
always seems to do, Azzi found a way
to answer that challenge — though not
immediately.
When Sonja Henning made a steal
and went coast-to-coast for a layin to
open the second stanza, it appeared the
Cardinal might be getting things going.
But after a Trisha Stevens basket, the
Ducks came back with seven straight
points to trim the lead to five, 35-30.
Six minutes had already elapsed in
the half at that point. The two teams
traded scores for the next several pos
sessions before Azzi knocked down a
three-pointer — one of her four on the
evening — to make it 44-36 Stanford.
After a Kasperski free throw, Azzi
hit another trey, and the Cardinal was
suddenly on its way. Val Whiting made
a beautiful spin move and scored on a
reverse layup, and the Ducks called
timeout.
Oregon regrouped momentarily,
matching Stanford for the next two
minutes. Then Julie Zeilstra hit an open

8-footer on the baseline to start a 14-0
run that quashed the Ducks.
Zeilstra scored twice more during the
binge and played a key role in the play
of the game. With a 63-41 lead, Azzi
threw a halfcourt pass to Zeilstra, who
was about 15 feet from the Cardinal
basket.
She caught the ball falling backwards
and saw Steding steaming down court.
Zeilstra made an ideal touch pass,
Steding grabbed it as she flew by and
then completed the play.
The Ducks, had enough at that point
and subbed for everyone on the floor.
Henning did not shoot well, but had
another excellent game. She made six
steals to key the Cardinal defense and
dished out four assists while commiting
only one turnover.
Card notes
Steding scored six points to give her a
career total of 1,500. She joins Azzi and
Jeanne Kuark Hoff as the only players in
school history to reach that plateau.
Zeilstra finished with 11 points. She has
scored in double figures for 23 straight
games.

the half at that point. The two teams
traded scores for the next several pos
sessions before Azzi knocked down a
three-pointer — one of her four on the
evening — to make it 44-36 Stanford.
After a Kasperski free throw, Azzi
hit another trey, and the Cardinal was
suddenly on its way. Val Whiting made
a beautiful spin move and scored on a
reverse layup, and the Ducks called
timeout.
Oregon regrouped momentarily,
matching Stanford for the next two
minutes. Then Julie Zeilstra hit an open

8-footer on the baseline to start a 14-0
run that quashed the Ducks.
Zeilstra scored twice more during the
binge and played a key role in the play
of the game. With a 63-41 lead, Azzi
threw a halfcourt pass to Zeilstra, who
was about 15 feet from the Cardinal
basket.
She caught the ball falling backwards
and saw Steding steaming down court.
Zeilstra made an ideal touch pass,
Steding grabbed it as she flew by and
then completed the play.
The Ducks, had enough at that point
and subbed for everyone on the floor.
Henning did not shoot well, but had
another excellent game. She made six
steals to key the Cardinal defense and
dished out four assists while commiting
only one turnover.
Card notes
Steding scored six points to give her a
career total of 1,500. She joins Azzi and
Jeanne Kuark Hoff as the only players in
school history to reach that plateau.
Zeilstra finished with 11 points. She has
scored in double figures for 23 straight
games.

Katy Steding and the Cardinal could have used more layups last night, as the team
shot a dismal .311 in the first half. A strong defensive effort allowed Stanford to
hammer Oregon anyway, 75-45.
Last night, the Cardinal played the
kind of game it cannot play in the up
coming NCAA tournament.
Yet, despite turning in its worst
shooting performance of the season,
second-ranked Stanford was still good
enough to beat Oregon handily 75-45
before 2,506 spectators in Maples Pa
vilion.

In winning its sixth consecutive game,
the Cardinal upped its season record to
26-1, 16-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play.
The Ducks slipped to 17-11, 9-8.
None of Stanford's top six players
shot over 50 percent, as the team com
bined to make just 31 of 87 field goal
attempts. In shooting just .356 percent
from the floor, the Cardinal posted its
worst mark since a .352 performance
at Washington last season.
Defensively, however, Stanford was on
top of its game. Mixing in full-court
pressure with a half-court trap, the Car
dinal forced the Ducks into 25 turn
overs. Add in 19 points from Jennifer
Azzi, and Stanford was able to overcome
Oregon.
"That was the hardest 30 point win
we've ever had," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "I credit our defense
with the win."
Stanford had to do it without the ball
because, when the Cardinal had it, they
had trouble putting it in the goal. In
the first half, the team hit a mere 14
of 45 attempts and scored 31 points.
The total matched the team's season
low for a half set at Oregon in January.
Katy Steding was 1 of 9 in the opening
20 minutes and 3 of 14 on the night.
"It was frustrating," she said of all the
missed shots. "|But| we'll come back,
and I'll come back."
The biggest reason for Stanford's
shooting problem was 6-foot-7 Oregon
center Stefanie Kasperski. The Pac-10's
tallest player not only led the Ducks

with 14 points and 10 rebounds, but
she also blocked six shots. "Six?" Van-
Derveer said, "It seemed like she had 66.
"Kasperski is extremely disruptive to
any inside game," she added. The Ducks
further confounded the Cardinal with
a zone defense. "We don't play against
any zones because of our outside shoot
ing," VanDerveer noted.
Typically, Stanford can bomb away
from the perimeter and render the zone
impotent. Last night, the Cardinal's
shots weren't falling from anywhere.
With a 31-23 halftime lead, Stanford
faced a challenge on its home court for
the first time in a long while. As she
always seems to do, Azzi found a way
to answer that challenge — though not
immediately.
When Sonja Henning made a steal
and went coast-to-coast for a layin to
open the second stanza, it appeared the
Cardinal might be getting things going.
But after a Trisha Stevens basket, the
Ducks came back with seven straight
points to trim the lead to five, 35-30.
Six minutes had already elapsed in
the half at that point. The two teams
traded scores for the next several pos
sessions before Azzi knocked down a
three-pointer — one of her four on the
evening — to make it 44-36 Stanford.
After a Kasperski free throw, Azzi
hit another trey, and the Cardinal was
