# Shutting the 'Dor'
## Sophomore Dorlarque conquers rookie woes, finds bullpen role 
### Nat Cousins Senior staff writer 
Stanford pitcher Aaron Dor
larque knows yo-yos.
The right-handed sophomore
hurler has certainly seen the end
of the string. Last year, the fresh
man was shelled for 61 hits and
35 runs in 31Vh innings of relief
work as Stanford stumbled to a
30-28 finish.
Hut Dorlarque (pronounced
DOR-lark) has bounced back as a
sophomore, leading the deep Car
dinal staff in appearances (9),
while lowering his earned run
average nearly five points from
his ghastly 7.47 ERA of 1989.
Dorlarque threw seven innings
of solid relief work in a 16-5 vic
tory over UCLA on Feb. 18,
showing no signs of his freshman
year jitters.
Then in the first game of a
three-game series at Southern
California, he got the starting nod
and pitched well against the then
top-ranked Trojans, allowing
three earned runs in four and a
third innings of work.
"He's been a lot more consis
tent," said Cardinal pitching coach
Tom Dunton. "He really has im
proved, mostly with his control
and location on the fastball. He's
pitching with a lot more confi
dence this year."
The righty throws fastballs 70
percent of the time, mixing in a
split-finger to left-handers and an
assortment of curves to right
handers. He also has been tossing
a straight change-up and sinker
for variety.
In Tuesday's game against
Santa Clara, however, he had
trouble finding the plate with any
pitch, allowing four walks and a
towering three-run home run to
center field in two innings of relief

work. After the game, Dorlarque
admitted his arm was sore from
too much pitching.
"He has been a little tentative,"
agreed Dunton. "His arm might
be a little tired."
And on a team stocked with
young pitching talent, Dorlarque
realizes his status is day-to-day.
Nobody knows for sure what his
role will be for the rest of the
season, least of all Dorlarque.
For this weekend's three-game
series at Sunken Diamond against
Arizona, Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess indicated he may give
Dorlarque a rest to strengthen his
arm. But in future outings, Dor
larque may see time as a closer,
as a middle reliever and as a spot
starter.
"Starting, middle, closing —
whatever. Whoever had the last
best outing will be out there,"
Dorlarque said. "I like relief —
coming in with adrenaline. I'm
not sure if I actually like it that
much, but it's good for my pitch
ing. That's the important thing."
And Dunton thinks that middle
relief is where Dorlarque can help
the team most right now. Of
course, things change. After Stan
ford's aces, right-handers Stan
Spencer and Mike Mussina, the
pitching lineup is jumbled and any
of 11 other pitchers could end up
in the elusive third spot in the
rotation.
Of course, after a turbulent
freshman campaign that he posi
tively calls "a great learning
experience," and Dunton labels "a
real challenge," Dorlarque is
pleased as pie to be on the mound
and pitching consistently.
"I learned what it takes to
succeed," said Dorlarque of the
1989 season, which saw Stanford
miss the NCAA playoffs after win
ning back-to-back national titles.

There is a fine line
between success and
failure.'

"There is a fine line between suc
cess and failure. Two inches off
the plate is the difference between
a home run and a grounder."
Dunton credits Dorlarque's
"bulldog determination" and
"strong work ethic" with his soph
omore season improvement.
"Every day a pitcher has to go
out there and prove himself,"
Dunton said. "I think he's past
his freshman year."
Of course, his strong 6-3, 190-
pound frame, beefed up by off
season weightlifting, hasn't hurt.
He also played summer league in
Anchorage, Alaska, ironing out his
pitching mechanics and building
up his confidence for 1990.

Dorlarque was noticed at Co
lumbia River High School in Van
couver, Wash., by coaches
recruiting another Cardinal
fireballer — junior Stan Spencer.
Although Spencer and Dorlarque
played together from the age of
13, their styles are independent,
and Dorlarque plays down any
comparisons.
"I'm sure it helped me that
Stan was there while 1 was play
ing. I came to Stanford for the
academics," said Dorlarque, a pro
spective economics major. "We
have a great baseball program,
too."
And although the resilient Dor
larque is a little unsure of his
role, he can relish Stanford's 18-5
record and help the team pursue
another national title.
"Everything's not clear. I just
have to do it,"he said. "I'll help
where I can, wherever thev need


Sophomore Aaron Dorlarque, of Vancouver, Wash., leads the 18-5
Cardinal baseball team in appearances this year. The Cardinal
hosts a big three-game series against Arizona starting today.
