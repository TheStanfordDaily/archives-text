# Most dominant?
## Women netters go for record 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
At the time, it didn't seem
like a big deal. The Stanford
women's team had been
defeated a day earlier by UCJLA
and was looking to bounce
back.
The date was Saturday, April
16, 1988 and the traditionally
tough USC Trojans came
riding in to the Stanford Tennis
Stadium looking to hand the
Cardinal a second straight loss.
But Teri Whitlinger, Lisa
Green and Cindy Buchsbaum
— all of whom had lost their
matches against the Bruins —
were not about to let that hap
pen. Each knocked off their op
ponents from Troy, as did
teammates Sandra Birch and
Kay Tittle.
Those five singles victories
gave Stanford a one-match win
ning streak. "No big deal," you
say?
Well, since then they've won
49 more without suffering a
single setback. The 50 consecu
tive wins are a collegiate tennis
record. If the Cardinal beats
Arizona today and Arizona
State tomorrow, recording win
number 52 in the process, the
team will have the all-time
Stanford record for consecutive
wins in any sport.
The record currently belongs
to Coach Dante Dettamanti's
water polo squads, which set
the mark between 1985 and
1987. As history is about to be
rewritten, Dettamanti is taking
it in stride.
"It's inevitable," Dettamanti
said of the record's falling.
"The only question now is how
many they'll go before they
lose. They could probably go
for a hundred.
"It's great that women's ten
nis is doing that. It shows the
depth and quality of our ath
letic program at Stanford," he
added.
Women's tennis Coach Frank
Brennan is being his normally
cautious self. "I hate to think
too much about it until we do
it,"he said. "We're playing the
No. 10 team in the country
Friday and the No. 8 team Sat
urday. It's not automatic."
Not that Brennan isn't ex
cited. "I think it's really quite
an honor If we're able to pull
it off, 1 think that's a pretty
good feat. I'll be really psyched
Saturday night if we do it,"he
said.

John Wooden's UCLA bas
ketball teams won 88 straight,
which is believed to be an
NCAA Division I record. "1
don't know how much longer
we can go," Brennan added, "il
we lose two players out of out
top five and only replace then
with one player."
The reference was to Green,
who will graduate, and fresh
man Meredith McGrath, who
will probably turn professional
after this season He said there
are "two recruits that are real
blue chippers" and could fill
the void.
If either of them chooses to
attend another school, though,
Brennan said "there's nobody
else out there for us ."
At the moment, the future
is far away, and the excitement
is mounting. Dettamanti, who
said few people were aware of
the water polo streak until it
was over, was joking about it
with Brennan the other day.
"Frank and I were kind of
teasing each other," he said. "I
accused him of going against
weak opponents."
Dettamanti cited the recent
Boston College match as an ex
ample. He even gave Brennan
a hard time for needing to play
a doubles match at the Na
tional Team Indoor tourna
ment recently. "They're sup
posed to win in singles," Det
tamanti said
This weekend, however,
Brennan will take them any
which wav he can.
