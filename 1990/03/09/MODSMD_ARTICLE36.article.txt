West Virginia came to Stanford boasting two of
the top players in the country in Joby Foley, ranked
No. 14 by the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings,
and Paul Mancini, ranked No. 27.
But Foley and Mancini soon learned that Stanford
has some guns of its own.
At No. 1 singles, freshman Jonathan Stark blew
past Foley, 6-4, 6-2.
"I was a little bit skeptical before the match
because I hadn't played singles in a while," said
Stark, who was recently ranked No. 4 in those same
rankings. "Luckily, I think [Foley] was a bit off."
. Foley, however, did not see the match that way.
"[Starkl plays on a different level," he said. "He
was just smashing balls past me left and right. I
never got a chance to get in a real rally."
Jared Palmer, filling in for O'Brien, improved on
his No. 58 ranking with a 6-3, 7-6 defeat of Mancini.
Palmer, who has been sitting out most of the season
because of knee surgery, should move up in the
rankings as the year progresses, according to Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould.
At No. 3 singles, Jeff Cathrall powered past Mark
Booras 6-4, 6-3.
Glenn Solomon followed suit at No. 4, downing
Brad Kelly 6-4, 6-3. "I definitely hit the ball as
well as I have all year," Solomon said. "The guy I
played was deceptively tough, so I was glad that I
was concentrating pretty well.

"Coach [Gould] has worked a lot on my serve
lately. I've got more confidence with it now,"
Solomon added. "It gave me some free points today,
which always helps."
Despite jumping off to 3-0 leads in each of their
matches, Alexis Hombrecher and Jason Yee both
struggled, accounting for the Cardinal's two losses.
"It was just one of those days for Alexis and
Jason," Asst. Coach John Whitlinger said. "We all
have those types of matches."
Hombrecher, playing at No. 5, fell to Patric Wes
too, 6-4, 6-2. "I was just a step slow on every ball
today," Hombrecher explained. "And when you're
a step slow on every ball, you usually lose."
Yee, playing in the No. 6 spot, fell to Ron Mercer
4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Going into the doubles competition, the Cardinal
still had not clinched the victory. Stark and Palmer
changed that in a hurry, dispatching of Foley and
Kelly 6-1, 6-3.
"We are really coming along well and gaining
confidence in our doubles," Stark said. "We are
getting our returns back consistently and closing
off the net well. Hopefully, we can keep it up."
Stark and Palmer are ranked No. 2 in doubles
in the country, while Foley and Kelly are No. 8.
"[Stark and Palmer] are starting to learn more
about doubles — when to close the net, what shot
to hit at certain times," Whitlinger said. "You have
to remember that the guys they beat were ranked
eighth in the country, and, in the first set, Stark
and Palmer made them look silly."
At No. 2 doubles, Cathrall and Hombrecher
crushed Mancini and Booras, 6-2, 6-1. "I was
definitely more up for this match," Hombrecher
said.
In the longest match of the afternoon, Yee and
Dan Turbow came back to beat Mercer and Rick
Jacob, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4.
"As a team, I think we played a little tired today,"
Gould said. "But I was very pleased to come out
of this match with a 7-2 win heading into winter
quarter finals."
