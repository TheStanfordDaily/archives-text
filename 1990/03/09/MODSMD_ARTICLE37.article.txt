## Lisle, wrestlers conquer handicaps to enter Pac-10s 
### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
No one can be sure how Josh
Lisle will do at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Wrestling Championships
(his weekend. However, one thing
is certain: He will not quit.
Regardless the competition,
Lisle will walk onto the mat this
Saturday knowing that he has al
ready conquered enemies far more
challenging than any wrestler he
will face.
Lisle, a fifth year senior, was
born with a hearing disorder. He
has 75 percent of his hearing in
his right ear, but only 10 percent
in his left. The problem is easily
correctable with a hearing aid, but
some cruel grammar school kids
in his hometown of Clarinda, lowa
made it difficult for Josh to wear
one.
"I tried a hearing aid in fifth
or sixth grade and suffered a lot
pf abuse for it,"he said. "I decided
I wasn't going to wear it. I just
would sit in the front of the class.
I got sort of good at looking at
people's faces and watching their
lips."
The elementary school experi
ence left a deep impression on
Lisle which lasted until he came

to Stanford. After two unsuccess
ful operations, he still was not
willing to wear his hearing aid.
"When I came to Stanford, a
lot of my problems were mag
nified by this hearing loss," he
said.
Lisle was only on the Farm for
five weeks before he decided to
stop out and have a third opera
tion. He went home to lowa for
the operation, but before he left,
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel told
him to consider a hearing aid in
case the surgery was not success
ful.
Horpel's support turned out to
be important in convincing Lisle
to return to Stanford.
"A couple of times while I was

home recovering from the opera
tion, Chris would give me a call
encouraging me to come back to
Stanford regardless if I wrestled
or not," he said.
When Josh returned, he arrived
with a hearing aid and a new
outlook. Things went smoothly
until his sophomore year, when
wrestling was disappointing and
depression set in. He wanted to
leave Stanford again, but he
forced himself to stay.
"I think it was that part of any
wrestler's personality that says,
'I will not give up,' " said Horpel.
Horpel is glad that Lisle stayed.
"He has always been one of the
hardest workers on my team," he
said, "and until this year, he
hadn't had the athletic results
that he should have, based on his
effort. It should be interesting to
see how he does at Pac-lOs."
This season Lisle has beaten
wrestlers who placed in the tour
nament in the past. If he has a
good weekend, he could qualify
for the NCAA Championships by
placing in the top three in his
weight class.
However, one thing is certain:
He goes into the tournament
knowing that his toughest battle
is behind him.
