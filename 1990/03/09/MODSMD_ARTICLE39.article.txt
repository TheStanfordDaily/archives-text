# Spikers put UCLA behind them
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Maybe it has something to do
with Disneyland.
Stanford's men's volleyball
team, whose only two losses this
season have come in Southern
California, will continue a road
swing today in the shadow of
Space Mountain after a bumpy
start Wednesday at UCLA.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal (7-
2, 7-1 in WIVA) must brush off
a painful five-game loss to the
Bruins and contend with UC-
Irvine at 7:30 tonight. Saturday,
Stanford squares off with No.
2-ranked USC.
Irvine, ranked 17th, worries
the Stanford coaching staff far
more than its 3-9 record might
warrant. Despite being winless
in WIVA, the Anteaters can
boast of victories over 11th
ranked Penn State and UC-San
Diego.
"By record," Stanford Asst.
Coach Ruben Nieves explained,
"Irvine is the weakest team in
the league. But they've got two
or three guys who are really
good, solid players."
Nieves and the staff may still
be having unpleasant flashbacks
from last year's Irvine contest,
which forced the eventual NCAA
runner-ups to five games.
"We respect all of our oppo
nents," Nieves said. "The first
thing we have to do now is make
sure we're ready to play Irvine."
Saturday's match at USC may
nevertheless be looming large in
the minds of the team. The
Trojans have shattered all pre
season expectations with a ster
ling 10-1 overall record. Their
7-1 mark in the Harry Wilson
division of the WIVA conference
places them in a dead heat with
Stanford.
USC is spearheaded by Brian
Ivie, a talented outside hitter
who Nieves considers to be of
"national team caliber." Ivie is
delegated the type of hitting re
sponsibilities that Olympian
Scott Fortune had for the Car
dinal last season.
Despite their nearly flawless
season, the Trojans' pursuit of
the nation's top ranking was al
most shattered two nights ago
in a match at Loyola. The No.
15-ranked Lions stretched the
match to a fifth game and ac
tually held match point before
falling 17-16.
Sophomore Dave Goss, who
had what Coach Fred Sturm
considered his "best match of
the season" against UCLA, will

look to continue the momentum
Duncan Blackman pounded
20 kills at Pauley, and Craig
Forsyth led the team with a .441
hitting percentage to highlight
the Cardinal attack against
UCLA.

"We are very disappointed
about that match." Nieves said.
"I think we're going to feel that
one for a while. But we are still
tied for first place, and the loss
will not have a negative effect
on the team's morale."
