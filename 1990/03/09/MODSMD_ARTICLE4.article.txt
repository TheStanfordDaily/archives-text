### Lena Slachmuijlder Staff writer 
The union representing nurses
at Stanford Hospital has res
cinded its strike notice against the
hospital after reaching a tentative
agreement on a new two-year con
tract at 4 a.m. yesterday morning.
The hospital yesterday stopped
its strike preparations, which in
cluded restrictions on patient ad
missions. The 1,400-member
union, called the Committee for
Recognition of Nursing Achieve
ment, had threatened to strike
Monday over several points in a
proposed two-year contract.
The nurses will be informed of
the agreement's details today and
will vote on the proposal Monday.
The nurses are expected to ratify
the agreement, according to union
spokesperson Donalda Dunnett.
No details of the new contract
will be released until union
leaders present the full proposal
to the membership today.

The agreement focuses on three
issues, most importantly the two
tiered wage increase advocated by
the hospital and adamantly op
posed by the union.
The hospital aims to make its
entry-level nurses' salaries com
petitive in the Bay Area by giving
these nurses proportionately
larger wage increases than more
experienced nurses.
However, this structure would
"compress the wage scale" and
decrease incentives for nurses to
want to remain at the hospital
and rise in the seniority system,
according to nurse Vickie Wil
liams.
Dunnett said the agreement
also addresses the current mech
anism by which nurses file com
plaints when requested to perform
procedures compromising patient
safety.
It also addresses the nurses'
demand of a guarantee by the
hospital to neither decrease nor
replace the number of registered
nurses on staff, Dunnett said.
