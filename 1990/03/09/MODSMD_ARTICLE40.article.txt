# Volleyball at UC-Irvine, USC
## 
### 
TONIGHT — 7:30 p.m. start at Irvine.
TOMORROW - 6:30 p.m. start at USC.
RECORDS — Stanford (7-1, 7-1 in WIVA conference, ranked No 1 in
the nation), UC-lrvine (3-9, 0-9 in WIVA, ranked No. 17). USC (10-1,
7-1 in WIVA, ranked No. 2).
NOTES — Stanford is seeking to recover from an upsetting loss to
No. 4 UCLA two nights ago. The top-ranked Cardinal will face the
Anteaters tonight and will play for the conference lead tomorrow at
USC. Two wins would probably enable Stanford to maintain the
nation's top ranking despite the Bruin defeat. ~. The Cardinal con
tinues to live and die by the pass. Their offensive production has
been a constant this season, but their inability to side out effectively
has cost the squad at times, according to Coach Fred Sturm
