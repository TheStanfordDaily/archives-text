# The 						end of an era — bruiser 'Bruuu'-ton hangs 'em up
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — College is supposed
to be a learning experience, and that is
exactly what it's been for fifth-year
senior Derek Bruton.
When he came to Stanford, he was
very optimistic about his basketball fu
ture. He had finished his senior season
averaging 22 points and 14 rebounds a
game. He twice had 40 points and 25
rebounds in one game and felt that
after a brief adjustment period he would
be a top college player.
He didn't become a star, however, but
he's done something more lasting. He
has been a part of the building of the
Stanford program, and this year his
experience and ability to lead by example
have propelled an overacheiving Cardi
nal squad to the brink of its third con
secutive postseason berth.
The Cardinal meets California tonight
in the second round of the Pacific 10
Conference tournament and appears
headed for either the NCAA or NIT
Tournament after that.
"I guess I had higher hopes about
playing a lot more and making a bigger
contribution to the team," he said. "As
1 began to see the level of competition
and the adjustment I'd have to make,
the goals changed a little bit, and it
went more from individual to team
goals. Winning became more important,
which is how it should be."
Bruton's freshman year wasn't very
rewarding in either individual or team
goals. He redshirted that year under
Coach Tom Davis and the Cardinal went
14-16.
"Freshman year, redshirt year, was
really frustrating," he said. "Redshirt
ing was really frustrating. Working that
hard and having no reward for it, not
playing in games. ... I was kind of frus
trated with the Davis system. He's a
really good coach and a good guy, but
it really wasn't my type of system."
Davis' idea of basketball was pressing
full court for 40 minutes and scoring
in the 90s every night. For a 6-foot-10,
235-pound center, that was clearly not
the system of choice.
But after Bruton's freshman year,
Davis left to coach at lowa, and Mike

Montgomery came to the Farm. Mont
gomery stresses a deliberate offense of
working the ball into post players.
"The system fits my type of game
better," Bruton said. "It's more like the
one we had in high school."
Bruton got a little playing time his
sophomore and junior years but was
behind Eric Reveno and Howard Wright
at center. His junior year, however,
Stanford went 21-12 and played in the
NIT.
The next year Stanford had its first
trip to the NCAA Tournament since
1942.
"Last season I knew what my role
was before the season started," Bruton
said. "Basically it was the year the whole
team thing set in my mind.
"I just set my goals on being able to
contribute when 1 could, knowing I'd
have limited minutes. I tried to make
other players better in practice. It was
a great year."
But while he enjoyed having the team
post win after win, he wished he was
playing more minutes.
"I don't think anyone can say they're
not bummed when they don't play," he
said. "You feel part of the losses, because
you think maybe you could have done
something about it. But you don't feel
part of the wins as much.
"That's where the team thing moves
in. You have to think, 'Maybe I didn't
contribute this time to the win, but
maybe next time I will.' "
With Reveno and Wright graduating
after last season, Bruton knew he would
have a bigger role to fill this season.
Also, as the only senior on a team with
10 guys who didn't play collegiate bas
ketball last year, he knew he would
have to serve as a leader.
"I feel there's some amount of respect
they have for me as a senior," he said.
"I know what's wrong with their game
even if I couldn't do it myself, and they'll
listen to me. I can take pride in that.
"We have a lot of guys who can be
good. ... I want to look and when Kenny
Ammann's All-Pac-10,1 can say I helped.
I'm not the only one who had an in
fluence on him, but what I say helps."
Bruton earned a starting role this
season and started the Cardinal's first
13 games. While his field goal percent

age was very good, Montgomery felt
Bruton wasn't scoring enough or pulling
down enough rebounds. Montgomery
then inserted Deshon Wingate into the
starting lineup for Bruton and has kept
that lineup ever since.
"It was tough when I lost the starting
position for exactly one day," Bruton
said. "You can either tell yourself that's
the end of it, I've given it my all, or
you can come out and work your butt
off, which is what I did. I thought com
ing off the bench I could give the team
a lift and put up some numbers that
way. . . . Whatever makes the team bet
ter, that's what it boils down to."
Bruton has certainly been successful
in that goal. He is averaging just under
five points a game, but more impres
sively, he is shooting 59 percent from
the floor. The Cardinal is 17-10 this
year and has exceeded almost everyone's
expectations.
"Once you know how to win, you can
keep going," he said. "We may lack tal
ent or experience, but the feeling for
knowing how to win can make up for
some things."
He also feels that the success is not
fleeting, that the program is poised on
the brink of becoming a national power.
"I thought there were two divisions in
college basketball," he said. "There was
the top one, with the teams you see all
the time, and there was the second one
with Stanford in it. I could never see
us breaking that barrier and being seen
with that top group, being with North
Carolina, Duke, Oklahoma.
"People might consider Stanford and
Duke to have about the same academics,
but Duke had a better basketball pro
gram when I came here. Now, with the
success we've had, recruits are going to
come our way a little more."
And even though things didn't work
out the way he thought they might,
Bruton is glad he chose Stanford. "It's
been a really good experience. It's been
a heck of a learning experience. Some
times it hasn't been satisfying, but other
times it has — everything I've learned,
not just about basketball: confidence,
leadership, responsibility, what it takes
to be successful. That's boiled over to
life.


Chris Eisenberg — Daily
Derek Bruton is the lone graduating senior on the Stanford men's basketball team.
He has seen time as a reserve center and a mentor this season.
"It's been a good experience.
Who knows — it probably would
have been a better experience if
I was a 22-point scorer, the Pac
10's leading rebounder. But what
ever. That's not there. You can't
use any 'ifs'. It's been a great
experience at face value."

they have for me as a senior," he said.
"I know what's wrong with their game
even if I couldn't do it myself, and they'll
listen to me. I can take pride in that.
"We have a lot of guys who can be
good. ... I want to look and when Kenny
Ammann's All-Pac-10,1 can say I helped.
I'm not the only one who had an in
fluence on him, but what I say helps."
Bruton earned a starting role this
season and started the Cardinal's first
13 games. While his field goal percent

age was very good, Montgomery felt
Bruton wasn't scoring enough or pulling
down enough rebounds. Montgomery
then inserted Deshon Wingate into the
starting lineup for Bruton and has kept
that lineup ever since.
"It was tough when I lost the starting
position for exactly one day," Bruton
said. "You can either tell yourself that's
the end of it, I've given it my all, or
you can come out and work your butt
off, which is what I did. I thought com
ing off the bench I could give the team
a lift and put up some numbers that
way. . . . Whatever makes the team bet
ter, that's what it boils down to."
Bruton has certainly been successful
in that goal. He is averaging just under
five points a game, but more impres
sively, he is shooting 59 percent from
the floor. The Cardinal is 17-10 this
year and has exceeded almost everyone's
expectations.
"Once you know how to win, you can
keep going," he said. "We may lack tal
ent or experience, but the feeling for
knowing how to win can make up for
some things."
He also feels that the success is not
fleeting, that the program is poised on
the brink of becoming a national power.
"I thought there were two divisions in
college basketball," he said. "There was
the top one, with the teams you see all
the time, and there was the second one
with Stanford in it. I could never see
us breaking that barrier and being seen
with that top group, being with North
Carolina, Duke, Oklahoma.
"People might consider Stanford and
Duke to have about the same academics,
but Duke had a better basketball pro
gram when I came here. Now, with the
success we've had, recruits are going to
come our way a little more."
And even though things didn't work
out the way he thought they might,
Bruton is glad he chose Stanford. "It's
been a really good experience. It's been
a heck of a learning experience. Some
times it hasn't been satisfying, but other
times it has — everything I've learned,
not just about basketball: confidence,
leadership, responsibility, what it takes
to be successful. That's boiled over to
life.

Derek Bruton is the lone graduating senior on the Stanford men's basketball team.
He has seen time as a reserve center and a mentor this season.
"It's been a good experience.

I was a 22-point scorer, the Pac
10's leading rebounder. But what

TEMPE, Ariz. — College is supposed
to be a learning experience, and that is
exactly what it's been for fifth-year
senior Derek Bruton.
When he came to Stanford, he was
very optimistic about his basketball fu
ture. He had finished his senior season
averaging 22 points and 14 rebounds a
game. He twice had 40 points and 25
rebounds in one game and felt that
after a brief adjustment period he would
be a top college player.
He didn't become a star, however, but
he's done something more lasting. He
has been a part of the building of the
Stanford program, and this year his
experience and ability to lead by example
have propelled an overacheiving Cardi
nal squad to the brink of its third con
secutive postseason berth.
The Cardinal meets California tonight
in the second round of the Pacific 10
Conference tournament and appears
headed for either the NCAA or NIT
Tournament after that.
"I guess I had higher hopes about
playing a lot more and making a bigger
contribution to the team," he said. "As
1 began to see the level of competition
and the adjustment I'd have to make,
the goals changed a little bit, and it
went more from individual to team
goals. Winning became more important,
which is how it should be."
Bruton's freshman year wasn't very
rewarding in either individual or team
goals. He redshirted that year under
Coach Tom Davis and the Cardinal went
14-16.
"Freshman year, redshirt year, was
really frustrating," he said. "Redshirt
ing was really frustrating. Working that
hard and having no reward for it, not
playing in games. ... I was kind of frus
trated with the Davis system. He's a
really good coach and a good guy, but
it really wasn't my type of system."
Davis' idea of basketball was pressing
full court for 40 minutes and scoring
in the 90s every night. For a 6-foot-10,
235-pound center, that was clearly not
the system of choice.
But after Bruton's freshman year,
Davis left to coach at lowa, and Mike

Montgomery came to the Farm. Mont
gomery stresses a deliberate offense of
working the ball into post players.
"The system fits my type of game
better," Bruton said. "It's more like the
one we had in high school."
Bruton got a little playing time his
sophomore and junior years but was
behind Eric Reveno and Howard Wright
at center. His junior year, however,
Stanford went 21-12 and played in the
NIT.
The next year Stanford had its first
trip to the NCAA Tournament since
1942.
"Last season I knew what my role
was before the season started," Bruton
said. "Basically it was the year the whole
team thing set in my mind.
"I just set my goals on being able to
contribute when 1 could, knowing I'd
have limited minutes. I tried to make
other players better in practice. It was
a great year."
But while he enjoyed having the team
post win after win, he wished he was
playing more minutes.
"I don't think anyone can say they're
not bummed when they don't play," he
said. "You feel part of the losses, because
you think maybe you could have done
something about it. But you don't feel
part of the wins as much.
"That's where the team thing moves
in. You have to think, 'Maybe I didn't
contribute this time to the win, but
maybe next time I will.' "
With Reveno and Wright graduating
after last season, Bruton knew he would
have a bigger role to fill this season.
Also, as the only senior on a team with
10 guys who didn't play collegiate bas
ketball last year, he knew he would
have to serve as a leader.
"I feel there's some amount of respect
they have for me as a senior," he said.
"I know what's wrong with their game
even if I couldn't do it myself, and they'll
listen to me. I can take pride in that.
"We have a lot of guys who can be
good. ... I want to look and when Kenny
Ammann's All-Pac-10,1 can say I helped.
