# Cardinal's curtain call in Hobee's
## 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
Three Cardinal gymnasts will march in for the
last time in front of the home crowd tonight at the
Hobee's Invitational in Burnham Pavilion. The meet
is the largest home competition of the year for the
Stanford team.
Senior Becky Ashton will be competing on balance
beam, an event which she won at this meet two
years ago. She will be performing the same vault
with which she competed for the first time this
season at last week's meet, earning the second
highest score on the team.
Team co-captains Dina Amoroso and Susan Banta
will also be making their final appearances at
Burnham Pavilion. Amoroso, the Cardinal's top all
around performer, placed fourth at last year's
Hobee's Invitational and later qualified for the
NCAA championships in the event.
Banta — who like her fellow graduating seniors
is an economics major — will compete on floor
exercise as well as uneven parallel bars, her specialty.
She expressed mixed feelings about her final home
appearance.
"Right now I'm excited about the meet," Banta
explained, "but once I'm actually there, I might be
a bit sad. Every year when the seniors were an
nounced, I have gotten emotional, so I probably will
again."
No changes from last week's lineup are planned
with the exception of the return on vault of Nicki
Kobrine, who sat out last week due to illness.
Two of the other teams competing at the meet
are familiar to the Cardinal. Stanford had the mis
fortune of meeting Cal State-Fullerton when the
Titans were in the process of scoring a season-high
point total last week at Fullerton.
In addition, Stanford dropped a dual meet at
California on two days rest early in the season.
Coach Breck Greenwood sees little comparison be
tween that meet and tonight's rematch.
"We're a completely different team now. We've
been a different team since the Oregon State meet
(four weeks ago)," he said.
"Every time we've had the right attitude, we've
had the right result."
