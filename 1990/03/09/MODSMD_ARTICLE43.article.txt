Stanford's track and field teams will
seek to extend their young undefeated
seasons tomorrow in a dual meet against
the Cal State- Bakersfield Roadrunriers.
Both the Cardinal men and women
are 2-0 heading into the meet, which
starts at noon at Stanford Stadium.
"Bakersfield has a good men's team,"
said Stanford Asst. Coach Scott Chisam.
"Their women's team is a little thin."
As a result, the Cardinal will not be
competing at full strength. "We're going
to try to spread our people out and have
everyone concentrate on just one event,"
said Chisam.
However, he noted a few exceptions
to that rule. "They are strong in the

javelin, the sprints and the hurdles,"
and Stanford will fortify its strength in
those events accordingly.
In addition, Chisam said, "We will put
a lot of effort on our weaker Cal events,"
alluding to the all-important Big Meet
against California on April 28.
Some runners not officially affiliated
with Stanford will be competing for the
Cardinal, with Bakersfield's consent.
Among them will be Stanford graduate
Sissy St. Jeme, a frequent running part
ner of American record-holder Patti Sue
Plumer.
However, Stanford will be without the
services of super-sophomore Chryste
Gaines, who will be competing at the
NCAA Indoor Championships this week
end. She is gunning for the national
indoor 55-meter dash title.
