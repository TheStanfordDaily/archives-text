# Crew to kick off new season
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The Stanford men's crew season is about
to start â€” sort of. Six Cardinal boats will
square off against UC-Davis tomorrow with
the varsity also racing against a group of
post-collegians, but the season is very, very
young.
"This race is really a false start," said
Captain Andy Winden. "We don't have an
other race for a month, and this race is a
little bit unusual because it is twice as
long as normal."
Instead of racing 2,000 meters, as is the
standard college distance, the teams will
be racing a course that stretches two and
a half miles. Yet after countless trips up
and down the stairs of Stanford Stadium
and many miles on the ergometer mac

hines, the team is ready to race.
"I'm looking forward to racing them and
beating them and getting their shirts,"
sophomore Jeff Collins said. "I'm really
excited to win."
Though all six boats will be racing the
Aggies, the varsity will also face a group
of post-collegians. The post-collegians, in
cluding Stanford freshman coach and 1988
Olympic eight "A" stroke John Pescatore,
bring many national class athletes to the
competition. Stanford Coach Ken Dryfuss,
who picked the seats of his varsity boat
just yesterday, sees the race as a good
indicator of where his team stands.
"We have been working on a more patient
style, we are not in a hurry, we want more
relaxed, quality strokes," Dryfuss said.
"This is a good checkpoint to see where
we are."
