# Men's Basketball vs. California
## 
### 
THREE'S A CHARM — Tonight, with a 9 p.m. tipoff in the lovely University
Activity Center in Tempe, Ariz., Stanford and California will meet yet
again. The game will be shown live on PSN. The ever-engaging Pat
Rollins will star in the live broadcast on KZSU (90.1 FM) along with a
cohort to be named later. KCBS (740 AM) will also carry the game live.
RECORDS - Stanford (17-10, 9-9 in Pac-10 play), California (21 8, 12-6).
SERIES — California leads the series, which dates back to 1912, 129-85.
Stanford moved one game closer in that series by blasting the Bears
79-58 in Harmon Gym behind 20 points from Adam Keefe and 18 from
Kenny Ammann. More important than the offense, however, was the
defense, which held Cal to 18 points in the second half and kept the
Bears without a field goal for nearly 12 minutes.
GOLDEN BEAR UPDATE — The Golden Bears are facing a tough task in
matching up against the Cardinal. In the 80 minutes the teams played
last week, Stanford outgunned the Bears for 66, but those other 14
minutes gave Cal a split. The Bears played mostly zone, with a bit of a
box-and-one on Ammann, against the Cardinal, and it just didn't work.
Keefe scored anyway, and the Stanford perimeter players pretty much
lit it up.
CARDINAL UPDATE — Stanford got another glimpse of the team's potential
Sunday in the laugher over the Bears. Young teams, however, have
problems producing the same high level of play night-in and night-out,
and Stanford has definitely fit that mold this year. But with the guards
coming off a fine collective showing Sunday, and with the frontcourt
playing well, the Cardinal could be tough to beat
KEYS TO VICTORY — In building big leads over the Bears twice last week,
the Cardinal got Cal players in foul trouble. Brian Hendrick and Roy
Fisher cannot stop Keefe in the low post without clubbing him. Thus, if
Stanford moves the ball quickly around the perimeter to get the zone
out of position, the guards should be able to get the ball into The
Franchise and let him school the Bears' big men. Ball movement will
also give the Cardinal's perimeter players open shots. That could well
be a good thing, as Stanford has hit 17-of-30 three-pointers (57 percent)
against the Bears this year.
TOURNAMENT TALK — The winner of the Stanford-Cal game will meet the
winner of the Arizona-USC game at 3 p.m. Saturday. Meanwhile, the
Oregon State-Arizona State winner will meet the Oregon-UCLA victor at
1 p.m. The final is Sunday at 1 p.m. Raycom will televise both Saturday
games and the one Sunday game on channel 5. The Cardinal is 6-1 on
Raycom this season and 14-5 overall on television.
