# Gymnasts test perfect mark

A list of the reasons why the
Stanford men's gymnastics team
should come away from this week
end's meet with a loss would be
a long one. However, if history
repeats itself, the undefeated Car
dinal will overcome the odds and
maintain its unblemished record.
Tomorrow's meet pits Stanford
against UCLA, Cal State-
Fullerton and UC-Santa Barbara.
It will be held in Los Angeles,
which presents the Cardinal with
its first disadvantage. When
UCLA visited Burnham Pavilion
two weeks ago, many gymnasts
felt the large home crowd was a
key part of the Stanford victory.
"The competition will be
tough," Coach Sadao Hamada
said. "UCLA is mad (from their
previous defeat), and they will
have the advantage of being at
home. There's no doubt they'll be
strong."
At the same time, Fullerton has
proved itself as a force to be
reckoned with this season. Last
week, the Titans' all-around score
against San Jose State was 281

(out of 300), which is over four
points higher than Stanford's
season high. "They are definitely
one of the top ten teams this
year," Hamada said.
It would seem that facing this
competition at full strength would
be challenging enough. However,
the injury-ridden Stanford team
is put at an even bigger disadvan
tage with the loss of sophomore
Tim Ryan, who is scheduled to
have surgery on his broken wrist
today, and junior Tim Wang, who
will continue to only compete in
four events due to an ankle injury.
"Everybody's really excited
about this meet," junior David
Neithardt said. "But with all of
our injuries, we're still the un
derdogs."

In fact, one might be convinced
that the end of the Cardinal's win
ning streak is imminent. However,
the squad seems to thrive under
unfavorable conditions. Last
week, for example, the team man
aged to pull off an upset victory
against Arizona State and West
ern Michigan under similar cir
cumstances.
"We went 275 last week with
only four all-arounders," fresh
man Jair Lynch said. "If we hit
like we did last week, we'll win."
In addition, senior Conrad
Voorsanger will be back from Vir
ginia, where he competed in the
American Cup last weekend. With
the contributions of sophomore
Peter Wayne, who made his
season debut last meet, the Car
dinal will once again have six gym
nasts competing on each event.
All things considered, it is dif
ficult to predict the outcome of
Saturday's meet with any cer
tainty. With a past record of over
coming all obstacles thrown in its
path, however, there is a good
chance that the team will rise to
the occasion and come away with
another upset.
