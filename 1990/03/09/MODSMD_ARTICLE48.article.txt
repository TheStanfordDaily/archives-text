# Head and shoulders above
## Senior Connors stands as best women's diver in Stanford history 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
When babies first learn to walk,
the result is almost always the
same â€” the little tyke falls down
flat.
Kids usually get past that stage
fairly quickly. Katie Connors,
however, is still falling on her
head at age 22, and she wouldn't
have it any other way.
Connors, a senior on the wom
en's diving team, became only the
second female diver in history to
make the top eight in all three
events at the NCAA Champion
ships last year, placing fourth in
the three-meter, sixth in the plat
form and eighth in the one-meter.
Her performance helped the Car
dinal swimming and diving team
win the NCAA title last season,
the school's first since 1983.
This year she has high hopes
to fare even better after winning
both the one- and three-meter
competitions at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships two
weeks ago. The Stanford diving
team is competing at the Zone E
Diving meet today and tomorrow
at BYU in an effort to qualify
more people for next week's
NCAA Championships.
Connors has already qualified
by virtue of her Pac-10 perform
ance, but sophomores Kristin Jen
sen and Melisa Kuller will be com
peting.
"[Connorsi had great NCAAs
last year, and we hope she can

repeat that performance at least,
if not do better," said Rick
Schavone, the Stanford diving
coach and Connors' longtime
mentor. "Katie's the best diver
I've ever coached at Stanford. She
gets more out of what she's given
than any other diver I've
coached."
Connors began diving with no
idea she could come this far. "I
started when I was about eight
because it looked like a fun thing
to do for a month during the sum
mer," she said. "I began diving
year-round when I was 12. When
I was 14, I started diving with
Rick."
Even though Connors lived in
Davis, Calif., she and Courtney
Nelson, who went to BYU, would
come down every weekend to train
under Schavone at Stanford.
"And he's good," she continued.
"He wasn't really recognized at
first; he was up-and-coming. The
first year Courtney and I were
here, he was (U.S.) Coach of the
Year."
After training with Schavone
and improving greatly, Connors
had an easy decision as to where
she wanted to go to college. "I
always wanted to go here with
Rick," she said. "It was a nice
benefit that it was Stanford. . ..
People would start recruiting me,
and I'd tell them I wanted to go
to Stanford. Then they'd call Rick
and ask him if he thought I'd get
in, and he'd say he thought so. I
was contacted by a lot of coaches

... but they knew my heart was
here.
"The coaches that recruited me
... if they knew I'd do this well,
I'd have been more widely
recruited. No one expected this of
me. Not even Rick, I think."
She began surprising people im
mediately, taking a second and a
third at the Pac-10 meet and earn
ing All-American honors at
NCAAs. As a sophomore, she won
all three events at Pac-lOs and
made the final in the three-meter
competition at NCAAs, finishing
eighth.
After her tremendously success
ful junior season, she began this
year with high goals. She has lived
up to them so far, winning five
of the eight one-meter competi

tions and seven of eight three
meter events that she has entered
this year. In addition to her own
improvement, she credits the
strengthening of the Cardinal
team for her success this year.
"The last three years I've felt
pressure on me to win every dual
meet," she said. "Now I know if
I don't win, we have Melisa and
Kristin there. It's given me more
time to train."
But Connors hasn't lost too fre
quently to anyone this season. "I
rarely get a bad workout out of
her, and I rarely get a bad meet
out of her," Schavone said. "I've
never coached anyone as
tenatious, determined and com
petitive a diver as she is."
