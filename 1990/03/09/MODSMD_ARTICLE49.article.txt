# Women's Diving at Zone Meet
## 
### 
WHAT — The Zone E diving meet.
WHERE — At the BYU pool in Provo, Utah.
WHEN — The women's one-meter competition is today and the three-meter
competition is tomorrow.
WHY — The meet is a last chance to qualify divers for the NCAA Women's
Swimming and Diving Championships on March 15-17. Senior Katie
Connors already qualified on both the one- and three-meter boards at
the Pac-10 Championships. Sophomores Kristin Jensen and Melisa
Kuller will try to qualify on either or both Most of the top divers in the
West will be there.
HOW — The top four divers on the one-meter today will qualify to dive
one-meter at the NCAA meet. Likewise, the top four divers on three-meter
at this meet will go to NCAAs on that board. Any diver who qualifies on
either board is also eligible to compete in the platform diving at the
NCAA meet. However, Stanford can only bring two divers to nationals,
and Connors will certainly be one, so if both Jensen and Kuller qualify,
a tough decision will have to be made.
