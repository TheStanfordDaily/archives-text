# Toronto celebration Kennedy to head north for weekend
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
While University bigwigs party
this weekend in Toronto, they will
have their studies — Canadian
studies — on their minds.
Fresh from their February
fiesta in Mexico City, University
President Donald Kennedy,
former Secretary of State George
Shultz and some University fac
ulty and staff have headed north
of the border to join Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
and Stanford's 1,200 Canadian
alumni for the third International
Centennial Celebration.
Although their explicit purpose
is to include international alumni
in the University's 100 th anniver
sary festivities and showcase
Stanford faculty, these confer
ences have had a decidedly North
American focus.
In February 1989, the
Canadian government donated
$100,000 for the establishment of
a Canadian studies program at
Stanford in Shultz's honor. And
it has been encouraging collabora
tive scholarship among Canadian,
Mexican and Stanford professors
for a number of years, according
to Food Research Institute Prof.
Clark Reynolds.
Reynolds, who directs the
Americas Program project on
U.S.-Mexico relations, said the

Canadian government wishes to
see his project expand to become
the "North America Program."
"One important aspect would
be a Canadian studies program,"
consisting of a group of courses
from different disciplines and
eventually offering a degree, he
said.
However, Richard Lyman, di
rector of the Institute for Inter
national Studies, emphasized that
it is only "the germ of an idea"
at this point, lacking significant
funding and clear organization.
Meanwhile, a research effort
has been launched with the
Canadian grant. For example,
Reynolds recently co-edited a book
on the dynamics of North Amer
ican trade with professors from
the University of Toronto and
Colegio de Mexico. And some of
the interest from the gift will be
annually granted to a graduate
student studying a Canadian
topic, according to Lyman.
The two-day Toronto celebra
tion kicks off with a dinner dance
and keynote speech by Mulroney
tonight at the King Edward Hotel.
At tomorrow's conference, Ken
nedy, Shultz, Lyman, Reynolds,
Vice Provost John Wirth, Political
Science Prof. Nina Halpern and
Dean of the Chapel Robert Gregg
will deliver lectures to Canadian
alumni on a variety of scholarly
topics.
