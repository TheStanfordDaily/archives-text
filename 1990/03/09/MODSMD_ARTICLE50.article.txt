### Amy Arends Staff writer 
Providing a solution to the
crisis in urban communities in
volves the three R's of Christian
community development, accord
ing to John Perkins, founder and
president emeritus of Voice of Cal
vary Ministries.
Perkins explained his philoso
phy, which involves relocation,
reconciliation and redistribution,
to a crowd of 70 at Annenberg
Auditorium last night.
Relocation involves "Christian
workers who go and live among
t he people. No one will trust you
if you're helping long-distance,"
he said.
"Understanding and using the
gospel of Christ to reconcile God
to man and man to man" is the
second part of his philosophy,
which he calls reconciliation.
The final part of his community
development program is
redistribution. Perkins describes
it as "using the skill and resources
of people who have left the com
munity and succeeded, but who
also have returned to offer their
knowledge to others who need
their help and encouragement."
Perkins also said he sees "a

commitment to justice as the
means of giving people the tools
to find their way."
"Indigenous leadership develop
ment and a holistic Christian com
munity" are the two necessary
tools, according to Perkins.
Perkins worked for 12 years in
Mendenhall, Miss., where "there
was no attention given to in
digenous leadership development.
Gangs were in control there be
cause there was no other form of
leadership. Everybody that was
intelligent was leaving," he said.
"My goal was to build a sense
of community, which is done
through the Christian church," he
said. "I waited for the children of
that community, whom I had nur
tured, to leave and go to college
and then come back to help main
tain and encourage that commu
nity."
He is currently involved in
Harambee Christian Family Cen
ter in northwest Pasadena, which
has one of the highest daytime
crime rates in Southern Califor
nia.
"You obviously don't go to the
ghetto to get, but to give," he
said. "But if you go there to live,
you end up getting more than you
give."
