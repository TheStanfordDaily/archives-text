# Feminist Studies' status raised by Faculty Senate
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
After a series of sharp ex
changes between Feminist Studies
faculty and other members of the
Faculty Senate yesterday, the sen
ate elevated the Feminist Studies
Program to degree-awarding
status.
Chemistry Prof. James Collman
objected to the Feminist Studies
program's self-described premise
that "gender difference accounts
for an imbalance of power in social
systems." He called the political
nature of the statement "inap
propriate."
English and Feminist Studies
Prof. Regenia Gagnier offered to
show Collman the "overwhelming
evidence" in support of the pro
gram's premise if he did not be
lieve it.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Robert Eustis, "speaking as a
man," questioned the title
Feminist Studies and suggested

changing it to Gender Studies.
"We don't have Men's Studies,"
he said.
"Most of the courses here
should be called that," Feminist
Studies Chair Sylvia Yanagisako
quipped.
The recommendation, which
will allow students to earn a bach
elor of arts degree in Feminist
Studies, passed the senate unan
imously with two abstentions.
In other business, the senate
heard from Dean of Undergradu
ate Studies Tom Wasow, who out
lined his two principal goals as
dean: to facilitate high quality of
learning and to make the curric
ulum more multicultural.
Wasow mentioned plans to
strengthen the non-Western dis
tribution requirement and propos
als to add gender and ethnic
studies requirements to the cur
riculum.
"It's our responsibility to
prepare students to be thoughtful
members of society," he said.
