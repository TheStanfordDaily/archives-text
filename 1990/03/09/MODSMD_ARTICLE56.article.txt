Clark Kent, Lois Lane,
Brenda Starr, Vicki Vale.
The professional lives of
this fearless four of jour
nalism are a bit over
glamorized in the comics.
In real life, the stress of
the press can lead to insular
reporting as a journalist
documents events day in
and day out, losing sight of
the larger scope.
To counteract this prob
lem, the Knight Fellows
Program aims to improve
news quality by offering
reporters an opportunity to
increase their understand

ing of their respective areas
of interest.

The year 1990 marks the
25th anniversary of the
program, which enables six
international and 12 do
mestic journalists to study
at Stanford. During their
yearlong stay here, the cor
respondents receive a
$30,000 stipend for ex
penses and a book allow
ance.
Fellows in the program
are the envy of j'ournalists
the world over, who are of
ten burned out from years
of reporting. The location,

the money and the freedom
can hardly be beat.
Since the program's
origin, Stanford has hosted
nearly 500 lucky fellows,
many of whom have won
further acclaim in their
field. Ten Pulitzer Prizes
have been awarded to fel
lows, among them two-time
Pulitzer winner James Ris
ser, director of the Knight
Fellowships.
