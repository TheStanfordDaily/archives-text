# Solidarity supporter wants 'to make information'
## 
### 
To call the life of Joanna Szczesna eventful would
be a gross understatement. As a journalist, she has
had a profound effect on her native Poland. From
spending time in prison to co-founding the Solidarity
Press Agency, Szczesna has devoted herself to pro
testing the repressive Polish government.
Originally, Szczesna did not plan to lead the fran
tic life of a reporter; rather, she hoped to become
a teacher. As a freshman at a state-run university
in 1969, she began publishing an underground
periodical with a group of friends.
Even told through a translator, her story is vivid
and frightening:
"We met in secret seminars on the topics of social
movement and Polish history. Our group was caught
when some of us were traveling to Poronin to ex
plode a bomb in a Lenin Museum."
Szczesna was accused of belonging to an anti-state
organization and imprisoned for a year. After being
expelled from school, she transferred to the Catholic
University of Lublin, the only private university in
Poland, and graduated in 1973.
But when she entered the real world and became
a teacher, Szczesna was "thrown out of work in
the schools three times" by the political police due
to her views and membership in an illegal organi
zation, she says.
The first underground newspaper was created in
1976 by the Committee for the Defense of the
Workers. After Szczesna criticized its leader for poor
grammar and punctuation, he invited her to join
his publication.
With the emergence of Solidarity in 1980 and
subsequent reforms, Szczesna was once again able
to teach in schools, but "by that time, it turned
out that journalism interested me even more."

Szczesna says that witnessing the August 1980
Lenin shipyards incident, which sparked the
Solidarity movement, was one of the most exciting
aspects of her career. "It was the first explosion of
freedom I had ever seen."
As the masses began to subscribe to the Solidarity
movement, Szczesna says she decided that she
"wanted to make information. At that point, a single
press agency existed."
To be the first independent news source in the
Communist bloc was a tremendous undertaking.
Szczesna worked with few experienced staffers, only
one phone and no wire service. Despite those im
pediments, the agency flourished.
"In the course of a year it went from a very
amateur operation to a very serious institution,
serving the whole country," Szczesna says."In a
few months, we managed to do a bulletin for which
the representatives of the government stood in line
in order to get the information."
The events leading up to her visit as a Knight
Fellow are as vivid and extraordinary as her entry
into journalism. Through 1981, Szczesna worked in
the press agency she helped to found. But, because
she was on a governmental list of people to be
interned, Szczesna was forced to go into hiding once
martial law was declared on Dec. 13, 1981 and
remained underground until July 1982, when she
was arrested while conducting an interview of Radio
Solidarity members.
Mistakenly held as part of Radio Solidarity, she
was released after four months in the custody of
political police. Since then, Szczesna has reported
for The Mazowse Weekly.
During her fellowship, she is perusing Polish his
torical documents in the Hoover Archives.
