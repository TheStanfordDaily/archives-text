# German writer views changing global climate

When he was first exploring
careers, journalism was always
"looming on the horizon" for
Egon Scotland. However, after
studying modern history and
Asian studies in both Ankara,
Turkey and London, he saw the
newspaper world as flat.
But soon Scotland realized
"There's a lot more fun in writing
publicly . . . than writing history
and putting it into drawers and
bins."
While doing his doctorate, he
was accepted to a journalism
school. And the rest, as they say,
is yesterday's newspapers. For
Scotland, the thrill of fresh ink
has taken hold. Currently, he is
a parliamentary correspondent
with the West German newspaper
Siiddeutsche Zeitung.
This articulate journalist main
tains a broad view in terms of
today's changing world situation.
Regarding the events in Eastern
Europe in relation to his native
West Germany, he sees the main
issue as "joining successful indus
try with morality."
As a concerned environmen
talist, Scotland says he thinks our
global problems should outweigh
those of the lines we draw to sep
arate countries.

We incur ecological damage "at
the expense of our children and
grandchildren," he warns. "The
question of whether this happens
in a small nation or big nation is
really of a secondary nature."

Scotland emphasizes multicul
turalism as the key to a success
ful, integrated state. "Having
people of other nationalities and
cultures in Germany adds to the
cultural wealth of that country
and of Europe," he says.
Referring to the conflict be
tween Turkey and Greece, where
many support independent na
tions for each ethnic group, Scot
land says he finds a "dead end"
in desiring such homogenity. At
tempts at cultural and border seg
regation are producing tension
that will soon force antagonists

to cooperate, he says.
As is apparent from his com
ments about global politics, Scot
land has reported on a variety of
foreign and domestic issues. Sur
prisingly, though, the largest
reader response Scotland ever re
ceived did not arise after a
weighty political opinion piece but
from a story on how he sews his
own pants.
"I did a very little piece about
my fast trousers, and I've never
had more mail, more acclaim for
anything," Scotland says. A prac
tical and analytical speaker, Scot
land says, "Maybe it says

something about a man trans
gressing his supposed limita
tions."
Aside from being a multicul
tural advocate, Scotland is a mul
tifaceted individual. Currently, he
is pursuing a diversified curricu
lum at Stanford. While "trying to
digest what happened last fall" in
Germany, he is also taking classes
in Nigerian studies, Egyptian
studies and Japanese studies. For
recreation, he is pursuing "some
constructed art, a cartoon class
and piano lessons." Not to men
tion sewing more trousers.


A correspondent with the Suddeutsche Zeltung, Egon Scotland
advocates increased multicultural and environmental awareness.
Currently, Scotland is studying issues concerning his native Ger
many at Stanford.
