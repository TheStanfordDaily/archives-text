# Colombian journalist hasn't given up hope for end of drug war
## 
### 
Colombia is a country riddled with conflict;
a history of revolutions coupled with the cur
rent crossfire between guerillas and drug traf
fickers has contributed to the recent social
and political climate of the nation. In a place
where more than 45 journalists have been
murdered over the past two years, one might
have second thoughts about pursuing a career
in communications.
But Rafael Santos, managing editor of
Bogota's El Tiempo, is addicted to the excite
ment and cutting edge of his current profes
sion.
El Tiempo was started by Santos' grandfa
ther at the turn of the century and has re
mained in family hands ever since. At the
time of Santos' birth, the paper was closed
down, and his father was imprisoned from
1954 to 1957 by a military dictatorship. The
military government had halted the printing
of the paper because of its stance, but after
the downfall of the dictatorship, publishing
resumed at El Tiempo.
Santos says visiting the newspaper as a
young boy with his father opened his eyes.
He remembers "the smell of ink, the smell
of paper, the typewriters going and the
reporters running all over, shouting and
screaming."
Doing bit work on the publication provided
Santos with some practical experience before
he enrolled at the University of Kansas to
study journalism. After graduation, he took
a job with The Miami Herald, which had
recently started publishing a Spanish edition.
Later, he joined the family business and tried
his hand at various aspects of the field ranging
from night shift to domestic and national
issues. He currently focuses on editing.
Santos vividly recalls two special editions
of El Tiempo as the most challenging points
of his career. In 1985, a volcano eruption

'The big pressures come
from the leftist guerrilla
movements which seek
... propaganda through
the news media and the
drug traffickers.'
— Rafael Santos

killed over 25,000 Colombians. Short of staff
and time, he turned out an in-depth special
edition on the calamity.
Two years before the volcano eruption, an
other natural disaster had rocked the country.
A sizable earthquake hit an old city during
Holy Week, the week before Easter. The
presses were closed in observance of the
holiday, and Santos took it upon himself to
catch the story.
"We had very few reporters available," he
recalls. "We had to run to get a staff. ... I
flew probably the first reporting team to get
to that city".
Santos says "getting to cover the violent
process of Colombian life in the past six years"
has been the most interesting and dangerous
aspect of his recent career.
A very "delicate" part of his work has been
reporting on the drug lords. "You have to be
very careful and . . . still try to keep the public
informed of what's going on," he says.
As managing editor, Santos also actively
coordinates reporting teams to cover the peace

negotiations between guerillas and the gov
ernment.
A largely unknown aspect of Colombian
journalism is the broad freedom accorded to
the press. One finds "very little government
censorship," however, "the big pressures come
from the leftist guerilla movements which seek
. . . propaganda through the news media and
the drug traffickers," Santos says.
A polite tap on the shoulder is not their
style; murdering journalists is "their way of
letting you know that you have to be careful
about what you say and what kinds of issues
you touch," he explains.
Santos stresses the importance of consider
ing alternatives to fight the drug problem in
his country and abroad. He finds fault in U.S.
military intervention as a method to solve
this problem. In the drug war, the huge in
frastucture of money and corruption produces
an ambiguous enemy, he says.
Sending troops is a superficial shortcut; it's
the "easiest" but not the most efficient way
of handling this scourge, he says. Legalization,
as a method to "take away the luxury of the
drug business" should be considered as a pos
sible choice, he adds.
Reflecting upon the seemingly impossible
goal of economic, political and military
stability in Columbia, Santos says he realizes
that reform might not be around the corner.
What keeps his presses running is his personal
motto: "Never give up hope."
At Stanford, Santos is looking to better
himself as an editor. Frequenting the Gradu
ate School of Business to gain managerial
skills, he is learning to improve his organi
zation of El Tiempo. He also hopes to develop
a broader geopolitical scope through political
science and communication classes.

In a nation where drug cartels murder journalists who expose their
activities, Rafael Santos is addicted to the excitement of being the
managing editor of El Tiempo.
