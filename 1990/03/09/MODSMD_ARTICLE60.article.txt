# Foreign editor urges newspapers to develop broader perspectives on world events
## 
### 
Mild-mannered Kathryn Tolbert has
had many a hectic experience working as
the foreign editor for The Boston Globe.
Waking up reporters in the middle of the
night to cover a late-breaking story,
having correspondents call to tell her that
the South African police have confiscated
all their notes or hearing a firsthand
account of the massacre in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square from a reporter
crouching in a phone booth are just some
of the daily ups and downs of the job.
Tolbert says that as a political science
major at Vassar College, she was "one
of those people who never wanted to do
anything else" but journalism. The eager
correspondent wasted no time after grad
uating to enter the world of reporting.
With a background in Japanese culture,
she packed up her bags and set out to
work in Tokyo with The Associated Press
for a few months.
What she had originally intended to be

Today's papers are
'myopic,' Tolbert says.
'While we are focused
on Germany, we forget
completely about Cen
tral America or South
Africa.'

a summer job lasted three and a half
years.
After transferring to the AP world desk
in New York, she left to pursue a master's
in international relations. Tolbert was
hired by The Washington Post in 1980

as a metro reporter, but she says she
wanted to move north to spend time with
her Boston-based fiance. Landing a po
sition with The Globe was the next ob
stacle for her to overcome.
Beginning as a metro reporter at The
Globe, Tolbert progressed to assistant
foreign editor when the publication began
opening foreign bureaus in 1982. She
climbed the last rung on the ladder in
1985, when she was promoted to foreign
editor.
In foreign editing, not everything
comes up roses. Sending reporters to lo
cations they don't want to go, or as she
emphasizes, "keeping them out of places
they do want to cover, like Beirut" can
keep one perched in a hectic situation.
Sometimes she encounters problems
that lie outside her job description. In a
telescript of a recently given speech, she
said that, "You never have enough space
in the newspaper for all that is going on

'The culture of the
newsroom is such that
you only move up by
moving around.'

. . . your newspaper will frequently lose
perspective ... if, say, there's been a par
ticularly gruesome killing in the city, or
the Red Sox are on a winning streak
(which doesn't happen all that often)."
Despite these difficulties, her ardor for
her work has not waned.
Tolbert sees the role of print media as
"more complex" and "more analytical"
than its televised counterpart.
"The Berlin Wall being chipped away
behind Ted Koppel or Dan Rather is not
the story," she says."The real story is

why, after 28 years, the barriers to East
German travel dissolved so quickly."
But Tolbert won't glorify print media
either.
"While we are focused on Germany,
we forget completely about Central Amer
ica or South Africa," she says. The goal
of the written press is to "generate in
terest in Third World stories, to try to
continue to be independent from Wash
ington's agenda and overcome our eth
nocentricty."
A goal-oriented woman, Tolbert has
decided to switch focus in mid-career.
She is planning to go from a "globe
trotting" foreign editor to her newspa
per's Washington bureau. Her
philosophy: "The culture of the
newsroom is such that you only move
up by moving around."
To help her transition to domestic af
fairs, Tolbert is taking a variety of courses
in political science and economics.
