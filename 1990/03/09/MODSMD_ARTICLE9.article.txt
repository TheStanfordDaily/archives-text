# Sexual assault victims break their silence
## 
### Sarah Kling 
"Carrie" stood nervously behind the podium
in White Plaza yesterday and told of her ex
perience with sexual abuse.
It began when she was just 7 years old and
continued until she was 13. The perpetrator,
her uncle, performed abuses ranging from
talking and looking at her in suggestive ways
to fondling and oral sex.
"Breaking the Silence — Speaking Out
About Sexual Violence" was an open forum
for sexual assault victims to tell their stories.
Addressing a crowd of dozens of onlookers as
part of Women's "Herstory" Week, six women
told their stories in a convincing demonstra
tion that the issue of sexual assault is gaining
importance on campus.
Carrie, like other women who took the
podium, was deeply traumatized by her expe
rience. "I left my body while it happened,"
she said. "If I had stayed within it, I would

never have survived."
Carrie constantly felt dirty and ashamed.
"I tried to fool people into thinking 1 was a
good person and was always afraid that some
one would find out that I was really bad,"
she said.
Before she entered therapy, Carrie spent
her life searching "so badly" for someone to
trust. She slipped in and out of abusive re
lationships, believing in people who only took
advantage of her dependency on them.
However, she said she is coping with her
past comfortably now. "I needed to direct my
anger outward instead of inward at myself,"
she said.
Emphasizing the fact that there is no stereo
typical abuser, Carrie noted that her uncle
was loved and respected and seemed normal
to everyone but her.
"Anyone raised in this culture has the po
tential to abuse," she declared.
A number of other women seized the chance

to relate their histories and offer hope and
support for those survivors of sexual abuse
who still suffer in silence.
"Julie," telling about the abuse she suffered
at the hands of a lover, expressed to the
audience the rage and anger she still feels.
"He expects me to forgive him, to talk to him
when he approaches me and gets in my face."
"1 used to change in the closet to keep my
roommate from noticing the bruises, Julie
said. She still bears scars from the man's
repeated abuse and rapes, she said.
"Katherine," after summing up her tale of
an abusive cousin, said, "I always felt that I
was to blame. Even at age 8, I knew what it
was like to live in a rape culture.
"My cousin told me that if I told anybody,
I was going to get in a lot of trouble," she
said, "and I believed him."
Katherine demanded that society confront
rape culture and rape-supportive language.
"The body is not a commodity," she said.
