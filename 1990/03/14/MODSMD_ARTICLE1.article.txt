# Turnaround jumper
## Azzi guns for a national title 
### Mark Rogowsky 
BEFORE Tara VanDerveer's arrival
here in 1985, the only Stanford wom
en's basketball tradition was a
losing one. To turn things around, the
coach figured she would have to bring in
players who were winners. In her first
recruiting campaign, VanDerveer was
pretty certain she had found one in Oak
Ridge, Tenn., native Jennifer Azzi.
During the three reasons before Azzi
came to Stanford, the Cardinal went 27-57.
Since then the team has gone 96-23. The
lion's share of credit for the turnaround
