# Turnaround jumper
## Azzi guns for a national title 
### Mark Rogowsky 
BEFORE Tara VanDerveer's arrival
here in 1985, the only Stanford wom
en's basketball tradition was a
losing one. To turn things around, the
coach figured she would have to bring in
players who were winners. In her first
recruiting campaign, VanDerveer was
pretty certain she had found one in Oak
Ridge, Tenn., native Jennifer Azzi.
During the three reasons before Azzi
came to Stanford, the Cardinal went 27-57.
Since then the team has gone 96-23. The
lion's share of credit for the turnaround

belongs to the team's three seniors
— Azzi, Stacy Parson and Katy
Steding.
When that trio of top high
school basketball players commit
ted to attend Stanford, it was big
news. These days, signing prep
stars is easy for VanDerveer.
Landing that recruiting class,
though, was quite a feat.
"Those three made a commit
ment to our team and our pro
gram," VanDerveer says. "They
paid a price their freshman year."
The price was losing, as the team
finished 14-14 in 1986-87. But the
light at the end of the tunnel was
becoming brighter. On Jan. 4 of
that season, Stanford was battling
UCLA, a team it had not beaten
in 13 tries. With the score tied at
60-60 and three seconds left on
the game a clock, the freshman
Azzi, a 5-foot-9 guard, stepped up
to the foul line for a pair of free
throws.
She confidently sunk both to
give the Cardinal a two-point vic
tory over the Bruins. "I remember
how excited she was talking to
everyone before the game was
over. She was saying, 'Come on,
let's go, don't be afraid,' " Van-
Derveer says. "She wants to win
more desparately than anyone
I've ever been around."
Says Azzi: "Losing is the
worst." Not that she knows much
about it. Ever since she first
picked up a ball in nursery school,
Azzi has been around winners. In
junior high, her teams went 50-0.
In her four years at Oak Ridge
High School, Azzi tasted victory
85 times against only 11 defeats.
Six years of basketball and she
had fewer than a dozen losses to
fret about. One year at Stanford
and she added 14 more. For Azzi,
it did not matter in the least that
she was receiving accolades for
her play.
"My freshman year was so hard
because we lost," she says. "You
can read your own name in the
paper or hear really good things
about yourself, but it still feels
lousy."
Now Azzi is a senior, and the
Cardinal rarely loses anymore.
The team is 27-1 this season and
ranked No. 2 in the country. They
are a leading contender for the
national championship, and Azzi,
who was named an Ail-American
at the end of the last season, is
their marquee player.
But she is uncomfortable with
the spotlight that shines on her.
Asked whether she would just as
soon have the attention shifted to
someone else, Azzi says,"I don't
care one way or the other. What
ever happens, it's not going to
affect what makes me happy or
makes me go."
Says VanDerveer: "Her focus is
the right focus. She's not caught
up with reading Sports Illustrated
or The New York Times (both of
which have prominently featured
her this season). She handles the

attention very, very well."
And not just from the media.
VanDerveer says that before the
Jan. 25 game against Arizona —
one Azzi would miss with an ankle
injury — she asked Asst. Coach
Amy Tucker where Jennifer was.
Tucker pointed at a group of
people near the end of the court
and said, "Look at that clump
down there." Azzi was sur
rounded by dozens of auto
graph-seekers and was signing as
many as she possibly could. She
is especially fond of the young
children who form a major com
ponent of the ever-growing crowds
at Maples Pavilion.
Four years ago, barely 300
people came out to see the team
play. The arena was so empty that
only one of the four sets of bleac
hers was rolled out for seating.
Today, attendance is nearly 10
times what it was Azzi's freshman
year.
The home average is 2,929, in
cluding a record 5,425 for a Dec.
15 matchup with defending na
tional champion Tennessee. When
the teams met a year ago, the
Lady Vols bested the Cardinal 83-
60 in Knoxville. Stanford re
turned the favor with an 85-71
victory this time around.
Once upon a time, VanDerveer
would say of Tennessee, "I don't
know if we'll ever beat them."
With that no longer the case, the
squad is aiming to win it all. They
have come this far by combining
talent with limitless unselfish
ness, and Azzi epitomizes what
makes the Cardinal so good.
If you look at glamour statistics,
like scoring totals, Azzi and her
teammates do not look all that
impressive. Yet, though she does
not pour in 25 points a night,
Azzi was named Pacific 10 Con
ference Player of the Year in '88-
89 and again this year.
The award recognized her su
perb all-around game. This
season, she was eighth in the Pac
-10 in scoring, third in three-point
accuracy and third in free-throw
shooting. Finally, she finished sec
ond in the league in assists and,
every time she dishes out another
one, she adds to her own school
record.
For Azzi, the perfect pass is just
as good as putting the ball in the
hoop. "My whole idea of offense
is either I'm going to score or I'm
going to get the ball to someone
else who is going to score."
VanDerveer works hard to
foster that notion throughout the
team. As sophomore reserve
guard Martha Richards puts it,
"The coaches know it takes all 11
of us to go anywhere." So does
Azzi, adds Richards. "She's always
very positive; she makes us feel
like we're just as important as
she is. You don't feel like there
are two separate groups — the
starters and the others."
Richards came to Stanford as a
high school superstar, but she
puts all ego aside when speaking
of her teammates. "Jennifer has
a great competitive edge," she
says. "She doesn't go out to beat

people. She just goes out to play
hard, and by doing so, she out
plays them.
"Sometimes she'll look at the
schedule and say, 'I didn't know
we were playing them this week.'
It doesn't really matter to her
who the opponent is she just
knows we have to beat them,"
Richards says.
Says VanDerveer: "There are a
lot of players who are very good.
But they want something for
nothing. Jennifer is willing to pay
the price as other players on our
team are, too. Personal success
doesn't go to her head.
"Unlike other players, Jennifer
will work on her weaknesses,"
VanDerveer adds. "It's easy to go
to the gym and work on some
thing you're good at. It's harder
to apply yourself to something you
need work on." But Azzi has, and
it all fits in with her commitment
to helping the team win above all
else. That single-mindedness does
not allow her the chance to realize
how good she is.
And Azzi couldn't care less.
"I've worked really hard and fall
the attention and awards] is a
by-product of what I've done," she
says.
"But it's not anything that
makes me think I'm a better
player than anyone on our team.
I would be crazy to think that,"
she points out. "Sitting on the
bench the other night (when she
was hurt), I was just amazed be
cause our team is so good."
Azzi, of course, is a big part of
that. As she has developed, Azzi
has realized the potential for
greatness VanDerveer saw in
recruiting her four years ago.
It was actually Tucker, VanDer
veer's ace talent scout, who took
the first steps toward bringing
Azzi to Stanford. "Amy is proba
bly the very best in terms of eval
uating players," VanDerveer says.
"She can pick kids in the eighth
grade, and they're the ones who
become All-Americans." What
Tucker saw in Azzi was a guard
who pushes the ball up the floor
and likes to run. The Cardinal
brain trust thought Azzi would
be ideal for the up-tempo game
they wanted Stanford to play. All
they had to do was get Azzi to
play for Stanford.
It was not going to be easy. Azzi
did not really know much about
Stanford and, contrary to what
some have implied, she was very
much in demand. "When my mom
reads things that say I wasn't
heavily recruited, she goes crazy,"
Azzi says.
After sorting through all the
phone calls and letters from
across the nation, Azzi's mother
and father made a pitch for Stan
ford. "My parents really intro
duced me to the school more than
anybody," she says. "My dad read
anything and everything about
Stanford; he told me about the
Robber Baron. He's probably their
best recruiter."
Azzi says she was "excited
about going to California, which
is something people from Tennes

see don't do that much. She adds
that it was important to her to
"be able to help start building a
winning program."
Says VanDerveer: "There are
things about her I really didn't
understand as much then as I do
now. Jennifer is a risk taker. She
is willing to gamble a little bit
and not go with the proven prod
uct. Stanford basketball was not
on the map as far as a place that
recruited her like Ohio State or
Vanderbilt or Tennessee. She
could have gone where she wanted
to."
It turned out she wanted to
come here, and VanDerveer is
glad she did. "She makes us go,"
the coach says. And what makes
her special? "If I could put it into
words, bottle it and sell it, I'd be
rich," VanDerveer adds.
The coach has a special affec
tion for her star player even
though Azzi exasperates her on
occasion. At a practice this season,
VanDerveer was complaining
about the fact that Azzi did not
pay attention to some instructions
on what she should bring with
her. Zeilstra listened to VanDer
veer's carping for a minute, then
said, "But you wouldn't trade her
for anybody, would you?"
"No," VanDerveer relied with
a sheepish smile.
Besides, most of the time, Azzi

takes what VanDerveer says to
heart — especially about winning
and losing. "Tara preaches all the
time [that] you can learn from a
win just like a loss. Why lose?"
is an Azzi favorite.
Amid all the winning, Azzi has
stopped to smell the roses. "Like
when we cut down the nets after
last year's UCLA game to finish
18-0 in the Pac-10, there have
been moments when I have just
stopped and taken a look at every
thing that's happened," she says.
"That was one of them. It was
really great. We each went up the
ladder and cut the net down.
Hopefully, it will be like that at
NCAAs this year.
"At times like that, when you're
all really good friends and you've
all worked really hard, to come
together and just win like that is
a great feeling," Azzi adds.
When the curtain falls on her
Stanford career, Azzi hopes to
continue playing basketball in Eu
rope, where there are women's
professional leagues, and she
would like to try out for the 1992
U.S. Olympic team.
But that's all in the future.
Right now there is a national
championship to be won, and you
can bet the winner in Jennifer
Azzi will do everything she can
to bring it home.

going to get the ball to someone
else who is going to score."
VanDerveer works hard to
foster that notion throughout the
team. As sophomore reserve
guard Martha Richards puts it,
"The coaches know it takes all 11
of us to go anywhere." So does
Azzi, adds Richards. "She's always
very positive; she makes us feel
like we're just as important as
she is. You don't feel like there
are two separate groups — the
starters and the others."
Richards came to Stanford as a
high school superstar, but she
puts all ego aside when speaking
of her teammates. "Jennifer has
a great competitive edge," she
says. "She doesn't go out to beat

people. She just goes out to play
hard, and by doing so, she out
plays them.
"Sometimes she'll look at the
schedule and say, 'I didn't know
we were playing them this week.'
It doesn't really matter to her
who the opponent is she just
knows we have to beat them,"
Richards says.
Says VanDerveer: "There are a
lot of players who are very good.
But they want something for
nothing. Jennifer is willing to pay
the price as other players on our
team are, too. Personal success
doesn't go to her head.
"Unlike other players, Jennifer
will work on her weaknesses,"
VanDerveer adds. "It's easy to go
to the gym and work on some
thing you're good at. It's harder
to apply yourself to something you
need work on." But Azzi has, and
it all fits in with her commitment
to helping the team win above all
else. That single-mindedness does
not allow her the chance to realize
how good she is.
And Azzi couldn't care less.
"I've worked really hard and fall
the attention and awards] is a
by-product of what I've done," she
says.
"But it's not anything that
makes me think I'm a better
player than anyone on our team.
I would be crazy to think that,"
she points out. "Sitting on the
bench the other night (when she
was hurt), I was just amazed be
cause our team is so good."
Azzi, of course, is a big part of
that. As she has developed, Azzi
has realized the potential for
greatness VanDerveer saw in
recruiting her four years ago.
It was actually Tucker, VanDer
veer's ace talent scout, who took
the first steps toward bringing
Azzi to Stanford. "Amy is proba
bly the very best in terms of eval
uating players," VanDerveer says.
"She can pick kids in the eighth
grade, and they're the ones who
become All-Americans." What
Tucker saw in Azzi was a guard
who pushes the ball up the floor
and likes to run. The Cardinal
brain trust thought Azzi would
be ideal for the up-tempo game
they wanted Stanford to play. All
they had to do was get Azzi to
play for Stanford.
It was not going to be easy. Azzi
did not really know much about
Stanford and, contrary to what
some have implied, she was very
much in demand. "When my mom
reads things that say I wasn't
heavily recruited, she goes crazy,"
Azzi says.
After sorting through all the
phone calls and letters from
across the nation, Azzi's mother
and father made a pitch for Stan
ford. "My parents really intro
duced me to the school more than
anybody," she says. "My dad read
anything and everything about
Stanford; he told me about the
Robber Baron. He's probably their
best recruiter."
Azzi says she was "excited
about going to California, which
is something people from Tennes

see don't do that much. She adds
that it was important to her to
"be able to help start building a
winning program."
Says VanDerveer: "There are
things about her I really didn't
understand as much then as I do
now. Jennifer is a risk taker. She
is willing to gamble a little bit
and not go with the proven prod
uct. Stanford basketball was not
on the map as far as a place that
recruited her like Ohio State or
Vanderbilt or Tennessee. She
could have gone where she wanted
to."
It turned out she wanted to
come here, and VanDerveer is
glad she did. "She makes us go,"
the coach says. And what makes
her special? "If I could put it into
words, bottle it and sell it, I'd be
rich," VanDerveer adds.
The coach has a special affec
tion for her star player even
though Azzi exasperates her on
occasion. At a practice this season,
VanDerveer was complaining
about the fact that Azzi did not
pay attention to some instructions
on what she should bring with
her. Zeilstra listened to VanDer
veer's carping for a minute, then
said, "But you wouldn't trade her
for anybody, would you?"
"No," VanDerveer relied with
a sheepish smile.
Besides, most of the time, Azzi

takes what VanDerveer says to
heart — especially about winning
and losing. "Tara preaches all the
time [that] you can learn from a
win just like a loss. Why lose?"
is an Azzi favorite.
Amid all the winning, Azzi has
stopped to smell the roses. "Like
when we cut down the nets after
last year's UCLA game to finish
18-0 in the Pac-10, there have
been moments when I have just
stopped and taken a look at every
thing that's happened," she says.
"That was one of them. It was
really great. We each went up the
ladder and cut the net down.
Hopefully, it will be like that at
NCAAs this year.
"At times like that, when you're
all really good friends and you've
all worked really hard, to come
together and just win like that is
a great feeling," Azzi adds.
When the curtain falls on her
Stanford career, Azzi hopes to
continue playing basketball in Eu
rope, where there are women's
professional leagues, and she
would like to try out for the 1992
U.S. Olympic team.
But that's all in the future.
Right now there is a national
championship to be won, and you
can bet the winner in Jennifer
Azzi will do everything she can
to bring it home.


Kai Keasey — Daily file
Jennifer Azzi has "made herself into a great player," according to
Washington Coach Chris Gobrecht.
BEFORE Tara VanDerveer's arrival
here in 1985, the only Stanford wom
en's basketball tradition was a
losing one. To turn things around, the
coach figured she would have to bring in
players who were winners. In her first
recruiting campaign, VanDerveer was
pretty certain she had found one in Oak
Ridge, Tenn., native Jennifer Azzi.
During the three reasons before Azzi
came to Stanford, the Cardinal went 27-57.
Since then the team has gone 96-23. The
lion's share of credit for the turnaround

belongs to the team's three seniors
— Azzi, Stacy Parson and Katy
Steding.
When that trio of top high
school basketball players commit
ted to attend Stanford, it was big
news. These days, signing prep
stars is easy for VanDerveer.
Landing that recruiting class,
though, was quite a feat.
"Those three made a commit
ment to our team and our pro
gram," VanDerveer says. "They
paid a price their freshman year."
The price was losing, as the team
finished 14-14 in 1986-87. But the
light at the end of the tunnel was
becoming brighter. On Jan. 4 of
that season, Stanford was battling
UCLA, a team it had not beaten
in 13 tries. With the score tied at
60-60 and three seconds left on
the game a clock, the freshman
Azzi, a 5-foot-9 guard, stepped up
to the foul line for a pair of free
throws.
She confidently sunk both to
give the Cardinal a two-point vic
tory over the Bruins. "I remember
how excited she was talking to
everyone before the game was
over. She was saying, 'Come on,
let's go, don't be afraid,' " Van-
Derveer says. "She wants to win
more desparately than anyone
I've ever been around."
Says Azzi: "Losing is the
worst." Not that she knows much
about it. Ever since she first
picked up a ball in nursery school,
Azzi has been around winners. In
junior high, her teams went 50-0.
In her four years at Oak Ridge
High School, Azzi tasted victory
85 times against only 11 defeats.
Six years of basketball and she
had fewer than a dozen losses to
fret about. One year at Stanford
and she added 14 more. For Azzi,
it did not matter in the least that
she was receiving accolades for
her play.
"My freshman year was so hard
because we lost," she says. "You
can read your own name in the
paper or hear really good things
about yourself, but it still feels
lousy."
Now Azzi is a senior, and the
Cardinal rarely loses anymore.
The team is 27-1 this season and
ranked No. 2 in the country. They
are a leading contender for the
national championship, and Azzi,
who was named an Ail-American
at the end of the last season, is
their marquee player.
But she is uncomfortable with
the spotlight that shines on her.
Asked whether she would just as
soon have the attention shifted to
someone else, Azzi says,"I don't
care one way or the other. What
ever happens, it's not going to
affect what makes me happy or
makes me go."
Says VanDerveer: "Her focus is
the right focus. She's not caught
up with reading Sports Illustrated
or The New York Times (both of
which have prominently featured
her this season). She handles the

attention very, very well."
And not just from the media.
VanDerveer says that before the
Jan. 25 game against Arizona —
one Azzi would miss with an ankle
injury — she asked Asst. Coach
Amy Tucker where Jennifer was.
Tucker pointed at a group of
people near the end of the court
and said, "Look at that clump
down there." Azzi was sur
rounded by dozens of auto
graph-seekers and was signing as
many as she possibly could. She
is especially fond of the young
children who form a major com
ponent of the ever-growing crowds
at Maples Pavilion.
Four years ago, barely 300
people came out to see the team
play. The arena was so empty that
only one of the four sets of bleac
hers was rolled out for seating.
Today, attendance is nearly 10
times what it was Azzi's freshman
year.
The home average is 2,929, in
cluding a record 5,425 for a Dec.
15 matchup with defending na
tional champion Tennessee. When
the teams met a year ago, the
Lady Vols bested the Cardinal 83-
60 in Knoxville. Stanford re
turned the favor with an 85-71
victory this time around.
Once upon a time, VanDerveer
would say of Tennessee, "I don't
know if we'll ever beat them."
With that no longer the case, the
squad is aiming to win it all. They
have come this far by combining
talent with limitless unselfish
ness, and Azzi epitomizes what
makes the Cardinal so good.
If you look at glamour statistics,
like scoring totals, Azzi and her
teammates do not look all that
impressive. Yet, though she does
not pour in 25 points a night,
Azzi was named Pacific 10 Con
ference Player of the Year in '88-
89 and again this year.
The award recognized her su
perb all-around game. This
season, she was eighth in the Pac
-10 in scoring, third in three-point
accuracy and third in free-throw
shooting. Finally, she finished sec
ond in the league in assists and,
every time she dishes out another
one, she adds to her own school
record.
For Azzi, the perfect pass is just
as good as putting the ball in the
hoop. "My whole idea of offense
is either I'm going to score or I'm
going to get the ball to someone
else who is going to score."
VanDerveer works hard to
foster that notion throughout the
team. As sophomore reserve
guard Martha Richards puts it,
"The coaches know it takes all 11
of us to go anywhere." So does
Azzi, adds Richards. "She's always
very positive; she makes us feel
like we're just as important as
she is. You don't feel like there
are two separate groups — the
starters and the others."

a great feeling," Azzi adds.
When the curtain falls on her
Stanford career, Azzi hopes to
continue playing basketball in Eu
rope, where there are women's
professional leagues, and she
would like to try out for the 1992
U.S. Olympic team.
But that's all in the future.
Right now there is a national
championship to be won, and you
can bet the winner in Jennifer
Azzi will do everything she can
to bring it home.


Kai Keasey — Daily file
Jennifer Azzi has "made herself into a great player," according to
Washington Coach Chris Gobrecht.
BEFORE Tara VanDerveer's arrival
here in 1985, the only Stanford wom
en's basketball tradition was a
losing one. To turn things around, the
coach figured she would have to bring in
players who were winners. In her first
recruiting campaign, VanDerveer was
pretty certain she had found one in Oak
Ridge, Tenn., native Jennifer Azzi.
During the three reasons before Azzi
came to Stanford, the Cardinal went 27-57.
Since then the team has gone 96-23. The
lion's share of credit for the turnaround

belongs to the team's three seniors
— Azzi, Stacy Parson and Katy
Steding.
When that trio of top high
school basketball players commit
ted to attend Stanford, it was big
news. These days, signing prep
stars is easy for VanDerveer.
Landing that recruiting class,
though, was quite a feat.
"Those three made a commit
ment to our team and our pro
gram," VanDerveer says. "They
paid a price their freshman year."
The price was losing, as the team
finished 14-14 in 1986-87. But the
light at the end of the tunnel was
becoming brighter. On Jan. 4 of
that season, Stanford was battling
UCLA, a team it had not beaten
in 13 tries. With the score tied at
60-60 and three seconds left on
the game a clock, the freshman
Azzi, a 5-foot-9 guard, stepped up
to the foul line for a pair of free
throws.
She confidently sunk both to
give the Cardinal a two-point vic
tory over the Bruins. "I remember
how excited she was talking to
everyone before the game was
over. She was saying, 'Come on,
let's go, don't be afraid,' " Van-
Derveer says. "She wants to win
more desparately than anyone
I've ever been around."
Says Azzi: "Losing is the
worst." Not that she knows much
about it. Ever since she first
picked up a ball in nursery school,
Azzi has been around winners. In
junior high, her teams went 50-0.
In her four years at Oak Ridge
High School, Azzi tasted victory
85 times against only 11 defeats.
Six years of basketball and she
had fewer than a dozen losses to
fret about. One year at Stanford
and she added 14 more. For Azzi,
it did not matter in the least that
she was receiving accolades for
her play.
"My freshman year was so hard
because we lost," she says. "You
can read your own name in the
paper or hear really good things
about yourself, but it still feels
lousy."
Now Azzi is a senior, and the
Cardinal rarely loses anymore.
The team is 27-1 this season and
ranked No. 2 in the country. They
are a leading contender for the
national championship, and Azzi,
who was named an Ail-American
at the end of the last season, is
their marquee player.
But she is uncomfortable with
the spotlight that shines on her.
Asked whether she would just as
soon have the attention shifted to
someone else, Azzi says,"I don't
care one way or the other. What
ever happens, it's not going to
affect what makes me happy or
makes me go."
Says VanDerveer: "Her focus is
the right focus. She's not caught
up with reading Sports Illustrated
or The New York Times (both of
which have prominently featured
her this season). She handles the

attention very, very well."
And not just from the media.
VanDerveer says that before the
Jan. 25 game against Arizona —
one Azzi would miss with an ankle
injury — she asked Asst. Coach
Amy Tucker where Jennifer was.
Tucker pointed at a group of
people near the end of the court
and said, "Look at that clump
down there." Azzi was sur
rounded by dozens of auto
graph-seekers and was signing as
many as she possibly could. She
is especially fond of the young
children who form a major com
ponent of the ever-growing crowds
at Maples Pavilion.
Four years ago, barely 300
people came out to see the team
play. The arena was so empty that
only one of the four sets of bleac
hers was rolled out for seating.
Today, attendance is nearly 10
times what it was Azzi's freshman
year.
The home average is 2,929, in
cluding a record 5,425 for a Dec.
15 matchup with defending na
tional champion Tennessee. When
the teams met a year ago, the
Lady Vols bested the Cardinal 83-
60 in Knoxville. Stanford re
turned the favor with an 85-71
victory this time around.
Once upon a time, VanDerveer
would say of Tennessee, "I don't
know if we'll ever beat them."
With that no longer the case, the
squad is aiming to win it all. They
have come this far by combining
talent with limitless unselfish
ness, and Azzi epitomizes what
makes the Cardinal so good.
If you look at glamour statistics,
like scoring totals, Azzi and her
teammates do not look all that
impressive. Yet, though she does
not pour in 25 points a night,
Azzi was named Pacific 10 Con
ference Player of the Year in '88-
89 and again this year.
The award recognized her su
perb all-around game. This
season, she was eighth in the Pac
-10 in scoring, third in three-point
accuracy and third in free-throw
shooting. Finally, she finished sec
ond in the league in assists and,
every time she dishes out another
one, she adds to her own school
record.
For Azzi, the perfect pass is just
as good as putting the ball in the
hoop. "My whole idea of offense
is either I'm going to score or I'm
going to get the ball to someone
else who is going to score."
VanDerveer works hard to
foster that notion throughout the
team. As sophomore reserve
guard Martha Richards puts it,
"The coaches know it takes all 11
of us to go anywhere." So does
Azzi, adds Richards. "She's always
very positive; she makes us feel
like we're just as important as
she is. You don't feel like there
are two separate groups — the
starters and the others."
Richards came to Stanford as a
high school superstar, but she
puts all ego aside when speaking
of her teammates. "Jennifer has
a great competitive edge," she
says. "She doesn't go out to beat

people. She just goes out to play
hard, and by doing so, she out
plays them.
"Sometimes she'll look at the
schedule and say, 'I didn't know
we were playing them this week.'
It doesn't really matter to her
who the opponent is she just
knows we have to beat them,"
Richards says.
Says VanDerveer: "There are a
lot of players who are very good.
But they want something for
nothing. Jennifer is willing to pay
the price as other players on our
team are, too. Personal success
doesn't go to her head.
"Unlike other players, Jennifer
will work on her weaknesses,"
VanDerveer adds. "It's easy to go
to the gym and work on some
thing you're good at. It's harder
to apply yourself to something you
need work on." But Azzi has, and
it all fits in with her commitment
to helping the team win above all
else. That single-mindedness does
not allow her the chance to realize
how good she is.
And Azzi couldn't care less.
"I've worked really hard and fall
the attention and awards] is a
by-product of what I've done," she
says.
"But it's not anything that
makes me think I'm a better
player than anyone on our team.
I would be crazy to think that,"
she points out. "Sitting on the
bench the other night (when she
was hurt), I was just amazed be
cause our team is so good."
Azzi, of course, is a big part of
that. As she has developed, Azzi
has realized the potential for
greatness VanDerveer saw in
recruiting her four years ago.
It was actually Tucker, VanDer
veer's ace talent scout, who took
the first steps toward bringing
Azzi to Stanford. "Amy is proba
bly the very best in terms of eval
uating players," VanDerveer says.
"She can pick kids in the eighth
grade, and they're the ones who
become All-Americans." What
Tucker saw in Azzi was a guard
who pushes the ball up the floor
and likes to run. The Cardinal
brain trust thought Azzi would
be ideal for the up-tempo game
they wanted Stanford to play. All
they had to do was get Azzi to
play for Stanford.
It was not going to be easy. Azzi
did not really know much about
Stanford and, contrary to what
some have implied, she was very
much in demand. "When my mom
reads things that say I wasn't
heavily recruited, she goes crazy,"
Azzi says.
After sorting through all the
phone calls and letters from
across the nation, Azzi's mother
and father made a pitch for Stan
ford. "My parents really intro
duced me to the school more than
anybody," she says. "My dad read
anything and everything about
Stanford; he told me about the
Robber Baron. He's probably their
best recruiter."
Azzi says she was "excited
about going to California, which
is something people from Tennes

see don't do that much. She adds
that it was important to her to
"be able to help start building a
winning program."
Says VanDerveer: "There are
things about her I really didn't
understand as much then as I do
now. Jennifer is a risk taker. She
is willing to gamble a little bit
and not go with the proven prod
uct. Stanford basketball was not
on the map as far as a place that
recruited her like Ohio State or
Vanderbilt or Tennessee. She
could have gone where she wanted
to."
It turned out she wanted to
come here, and VanDerveer is
glad she did. "She makes us go,"
the coach says. And what makes
her special? "If I could put it into
words, bottle it and sell it, I'd be
rich," VanDerveer adds.
The coach has a special affec
tion for her star player even
though Azzi exasperates her on
occasion. At a practice this season,
VanDerveer was complaining
about the fact that Azzi did not
pay attention to some instructions
on what she should bring with
her. Zeilstra listened to VanDer
veer's carping for a minute, then
said, "But you wouldn't trade her
for anybody, would you?"
"No," VanDerveer relied with
a sheepish smile.
Besides, most of the time, Azzi

takes what VanDerveer says to
heart — especially about winning
and losing. "Tara preaches all the
time [that] you can learn from a
win just like a loss. Why lose?"
is an Azzi favorite.
Amid all the winning, Azzi has
stopped to smell the roses. "Like
when we cut down the nets after
last year's UCLA game to finish
18-0 in the Pac-10, there have
been moments when I have just
stopped and taken a look at every
thing that's happened," she says.
"That was one of them. It was
really great. We each went up the
ladder and cut the net down.
Hopefully, it will be like that at
NCAAs this year.
"At times like that, when you're
all really good friends and you've
all worked really hard, to come
together and just win like that is
a great feeling," Azzi adds.
When the curtain falls on her
Stanford career, Azzi hopes to
continue playing basketball in Eu
rope, where there are women's
professional leagues, and she
would like to try out for the 1992
U.S. Olympic team.
But that's all in the future.
Right now there is a national
championship to be won, and you
can bet the winner in Jennifer
Azzi will do everything she can

ference Player of the Year in '88-
89 and again this year.
The award recognized her su
perb all-around game. This
season, she was eighth in the Pac
-10 in scoring, third in three-point
accuracy and third in free-throw
shooting. Finally, she finished sec
ond in the league in assists and,
every time she dishes out another
one, she adds to her own school
record.
For Azzi, the perfect pass is just
as good as putting the ball in the
hoop. "My whole idea of offense
is either I'm going to score or I'm
going to get the ball to someone
else who is going to score."
VanDerveer works hard to
foster that notion throughout the
team. As sophomore reserve
guard Martha Richards puts it,
"The coaches know it takes all 11
of us to go anywhere." So does
Azzi, adds Richards. "She's always
very positive; she makes us feel
like we're just as important as
she is. You don't feel like there
are two separate groups — the
starters and the others."
Richards came to Stanford as a
high school superstar, but she
puts all ego aside when speaking
of her teammates. "Jennifer has
a great competitive edge," she
says. "She doesn't go out to beat

people. She just goes out to play
hard, and by doing so, she out
plays them.
"Sometimes she'll look at the
schedule and say, 'I didn't know
we were playing them this week.'
It doesn't really matter to her
who the opponent is she just
knows we have to beat them,"
Richards says.
Says VanDerveer: "There are a
lot of players who are very good.
But they want something for
nothing. Jennifer is willing to pay
the price as other players on our
team are, too. Personal success
doesn't go to her head.
"Unlike other players, Jennifer
will work on her weaknesses,"
VanDerveer adds. "It's easy to go
to the gym and work on some
thing you're good at. It's harder
to apply yourself to something you
need work on." But Azzi has, and
it all fits in with her commitment
to helping the team win above all
else. That single-mindedness does
not allow her the chance to realize
how good she is.
And Azzi couldn't care less.
"I've worked really hard and fall
the attention and awards] is a
by-product of what I've done," she
says.
"But it's not anything that
makes me think I'm a better
player than anyone on our team.
I would be crazy to think that,"
she points out. "Sitting on the
bench the other night (when she
was hurt), I was just amazed be
cause our team is so good."
Azzi, of course, is a big part of
that. As she has developed, Azzi
has realized the potential for
greatness VanDerveer saw in
recruiting her four years ago.
It was actually Tucker, VanDer
veer's ace talent scout, who took
the first steps toward bringing
Azzi to Stanford. "Amy is proba
bly the very best in terms of eval
uating players," VanDerveer says.
"She can pick kids in the eighth
grade, and they're the ones who
become All-Americans." What
Tucker saw in Azzi was a guard
who pushes the ball up the floor
and likes to run. The Cardinal
brain trust thought Azzi would
be ideal for the up-tempo game
they wanted Stanford to play. All
they had to do was get Azzi to
play for Stanford.
It was not going to be easy. Azzi
did not really know much about
Stanford and, contrary to what
some have implied, she was very
much in demand. "When my mom
reads things that say I wasn't
heavily recruited, she goes crazy,"
Azzi says.
After sorting through all the
phone calls and letters from
across the nation, Azzi's mother
and father made a pitch for Stan
ford. "My parents really intro
duced me to the school more than
anybody," she says. "My dad read
anything and everything about
Stanford; he told me about the
Robber Baron. He's probably their
best recruiter."
Azzi says she was "excited
about going to California, which
is something people from Tennes

see don't do that much. She adds
that it was important to her to
"be able to help start building a
winning program."
Says VanDerveer: "There are
things about her I really didn't
understand as much then as I do
now. Jennifer is a risk taker. She
is willing to gamble a little bit
and not go with the proven prod
uct. Stanford basketball was not
on the map as far as a place that
recruited her like Ohio State or
Vanderbilt or Tennessee. She
could have gone where she wanted
to."
It turned out she wanted to
come here, and VanDerveer is
glad she did. "She makes us go,"
the coach says. And what makes
her special? "If I could put it into
words, bottle it and sell it, I'd be
rich," VanDerveer adds.
The coach has a special affec
tion for her star player even
though Azzi exasperates her on
occasion. At a practice this season,
VanDerveer was complaining
about the fact that Azzi did not
pay attention to some instructions
on what she should bring with
her. Zeilstra listened to VanDer
veer's carping for a minute, then
said, "But you wouldn't trade her
for anybody, would you?"
"No," VanDerveer relied with
a sheepish smile.
Besides, most of the time, Azzi

takes what VanDerveer says to
heart — especially about winning
and losing. "Tara preaches all the
time [that] you can learn from a
win just like a loss. Why lose?"
is an Azzi favorite.
Amid all the winning, Azzi has
stopped to smell the roses. "Like
when we cut down the nets after
last year's UCLA game to finish
18-0 in the Pac-10, there have
been moments when I have just
stopped and taken a look at every
thing that's happened," she says.
"That was one of them. It was
really great. We each went up the
ladder and cut the net down.
Hopefully, it will be like that at
NCAAs this year.
"At times like that, when you're
all really good friends and you've
all worked really hard, to come
together and just win like that is
a great feeling," Azzi adds.
When the curtain falls on her
Stanford career, Azzi hopes to
continue playing basketball in Eu
rope, where there are women's
professional leagues, and she
would like to try out for the 1992
U.S. Olympic team.
But that's all in the future.
Right now there is a national
championship to be won, and you
can bet the winner in Jennifer
Azzi will do everything she can
to bring it home.
