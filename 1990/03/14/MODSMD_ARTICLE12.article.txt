Ken Boer â€” Deny me
Maples Mania
Once upon a time, there were so few fans at Stanford women's
games the players practically knew them all by name. Today,
the students show up early, and many members of the com
munity come out as well. The Cardinal has drawn over 4,000
this season on three separate occasions. Entering the 1989-90
campaign, the record crowd was just over 3,600; when Ten
nessee came to town, 5,425 fans filled the seats. Partly as a
result of the fan support, Stanford has the second longest
home winning streak in the nation with 29 consecutive vic
tories.
