### 
10
Jennifer Azzi
5-9 Senior guard
Career bests
Points: 30
Rebounds: 10
Assists: 16
Stat fact: Azzi recorded the only triple-double in
Pac-10 women's history during her freshman year.
In that game, she had 14 points, 10 rebounds and
a league-record 16 assists.

On the women 's game:
"History is not behind us. You can't look back and say, 'These women were
great.' You just don't have that tradition like the men do. It's a new thing but it's
something I really believe in."

30
Trisha Stevens
6-3 Junior center
Career bests
Points: 35
Rebounds: 12
Assists: 3
Stat fact: Only four times during Tara VanDer
veer's tenure has a Stanford player scored 30 or
more points — three of those times the feat was
performed by Stevens, once in last year's NCAAs.

On winning and losing:
"I don't know what I would have done if I had come here and we just lost and
lost. Everybody of this team is like that. Any time you have people who are used
to winning and know what it takes, you can't help but be successful."

44
Julie Zeilstra
6-3 Sophomore forward
Career bests
Points: 27
Rebounds: 12
Assists: 8
Stat fact: Zeilstra has scored in double figures in
24 straight games. Though she's only in her
second season, Zeilstra is already 17th on Stan
ford's all-time scoring list with 616 points.

On making the pass:
"I probably don't do one or two things great. I think Ido all the little things ... I
really get a thrill out of making a pass. In fact, I think I'd rather make a good
pass and see one of my teammates score than score myself."

23
Katy Steding
6-0 Senior forward
Career bests
Points: 27
Rebounds: 16
Assists: 7
Stat fact: Steding is the only player in Stanford
history to be among the top 10 all-time in points
(third with 1,513), rebounds (second with 826) and
assists (seventh with 262).

On shooting the three:
"It's just fun because everybody gets such a big kick out of it. There's that line
and it's really not that much harder to shoot there than from a foot forward. It's
amazing the reaction you get from people. It's not that much farther out, really."

34
Sonja Henning
5-8 Junior guard
Career bests
Points: 27
Rebounds: 10
Assists: 12
Stat fact: Henning was named to the all
conference team this season despite averaging
just 7.9 points per game. She did, however, lead
the Pac-10 in assists at 6.8 per game.

On playing the point:
'We have so many people who score well, it doesn't matter who scores as long
as we're scoring. As long as we're winning games, that's my primary goal — not
only as a point guard but as a player."

52
Val Whiting
6-3 Freshman center
Career bests
Points: 20
Rebounds: 13
Assists: 6
Stat fact: Whiting trounced Stanford's single
season record for blocked shots this year with 51
(the old record was 40). She could break the
career record of 122 next season.

On coming off the bench:
"I really didn't think about starting. I just wanted to contribute. Honestly, I thought
wouldn't start because I was a freshman. I just try to psych myself up on the
bench to get ready."
