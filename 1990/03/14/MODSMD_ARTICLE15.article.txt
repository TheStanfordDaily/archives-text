# Their time will come
## With clouded futures cleared up, freshmen wait in the wings 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Freshman Val Whiting has a
lot of things in common with her
classmates on the women's bas
ketball team. But playing time is
not among them. Whiting is the
Cardinal's super-sub — she leads
the Cardinal in rebounding and
blocked shots and plays 23
minutes a game.
The team's other freshmen —
Molly Goodenbour, Chris Mac-
Murdo and Angela Taylor —
average 22 minutes combined. In
games, they are rarely in at
crunch time, but they are vital
keys to the team's success none
theless. Each works extremely
hard, and all three are being
counted on for the future.
Oddly enough, were it not for
some twists of fate, all three
might not be playing college bas
ketball at all — let alone for a
championship contender.
Goodenbour, a 5-foot-6 guard,
hails from the town of Waterloo,
lowa.
In 49 of the United States, bas
ketball is played with five players
on a side. In the other one, the

girl's game is played six-on-six.
The other one is lowa. Gooden
bour played six-on-six in seventh
grade, but does not remember it
fondly. "Six-on-six isn't even bas
ketball," she says. "It's just
weird." Three players on each
team, the guards, play nothing
but defense. The other three, the
forwards, play nothing but of
fense.
No one is allowed to cross mid
court. Though this anachronism
is still wildly popular, girls who
grow up on it have little chance
of playing in college because they
are unlikely to develop their skills
completely.
Fortunately for Goodenbour,
the wall of tradition was breached
a few years back. "My ninth-grade
season was the first year they
switched [to five-on-five]," she
says. The timing couldn't have
been more serendipitous.
Three years later, Goodenbour
was receiving All-America honors
from nearly everyone who follows
women's basketball. As a result,
she was a highly sought recruit.
Goodenbour says she chose Stan
ford over Duke, Virginia, Vander
bilt and Washington.

"The balance between athletics
and academics here was un
matched anywhere else," she says.
But that wasn't the only reason
she came here. "When I visited
and met the people on the team,
I saw how well everybody got
along and how close everybody
was. That's what tipped it."
The transition from being a big
time scorer to a little-used reserve
has sometimes been difficult for
her. "I'm not going to say it hasn't
been frustrating at times,"
Goodenbour notes. "I just have to
remind myself who I've been play
ing with. Jennifer [Azzi] and
Sonja [HenningJ are pushing me
to play better."
Coach Tara VanDerveer sees
the same thing. "Sonja is the best
thing for Molly," she says. "It's
almost like medicine in a way;
you don't like to take it. Every
day, playing against Sonja in prac
tice ... games are going to be
easy for her. She'll do really well.
She has improved tremendously
since day one."
Goodenbour knows her time
will come, with Azzi and Stacy
Parson graduating this season.
And she thinks the future is
bright — both for herself and the
Cardinal. "This year is the year,"
she says.
"In the future, I don't know.
We lose a few very good people.
With hard work in the summer,
though, they can be replaced. It
won't be the same team, but it
can be a team that's just as good."
MacMurdo's story is quite dif
ferent. She's 6-0 and actually a
sophomore. But last season she
played in just five games before
redshirting with a back injury. "I
talked to one doctor who said I
wasn't going to play again," she
recalls. "He said I had maybe a
20 percent chance. That really
crushed me."
She went and relayed the news
to VanDerveer. After a lengthy
discussion, they decided to seek
another opinion. "I held on to the
hope that I'd recover," she says.
And after having surgery on June
19, 1989 — "a date forever etched
in my mind" — to remove two
disks, MacMurdo began the long
road to recovery.
"The doctor said if you take
care of yourself, and do the rehab,
you should be playing," she adds.
"I didn't have any doubt. I knew
I was going to make it back."
Around the end of the summer,
she was able to start running
again. They school started and
basketball rolled around. "It was
a big transition from pretty much
not playing for a year to playing
with one of the top universities.
It took a while to get back into
the flow," she says."I think my
skills are still a little bit down."

made her a high school All-

Though they haven't seen much action this season, Angela Taylor,
top left; Chris MacMurdo, left; and Molly Goodenbour, above; will
be counted on heavily In the future.
American, MacMurdo is planning
on spending the summer here to
work out. Teammate Katy Steding
did the same thing a couple of
years back and is now one of the
best players in the country.
Coincidentally, MacMurdo is
one of the leading candidates to
replace Steding at small forward
next year. Though she's alter
nated between playing down low
and on the perimeter this season,
she sees her future on the outside.
"1 don't think anyone can
replace Katy," she says, adding
that she feels she'll bring a lot to
the small forward spot. "If it's a
matter of work that determines
whether a will be at that
position, I'm going to work the
hardest."
Unlike Goodenbour and Mac-
Murdo, Taylor was not a highly

touted prep player. As a matter
of fact, she almost gave up bas
ketball to attend Stanford. "As
you go up a level, there's less and
less people that can compete."
Taylor says."I realized that my
basketball career was coming to
an end [after high school]. I didn't
want it to, but I knew it was
coming."
For that reason, she concen
trated on academics, and Stanford
was where she wanted to be. Her
brother Gary, who is a junior,
plays for the football team, and
she liked the effect the school had
on him. "After he came back, he
was really a changed person," she
says."He was more open. You
could tell this was the place he
wanted to be."
Angela wanted to be here too.
She came with a plan to try and
make the team as a walk-on and
contribute any way she could. Her
expectations have been exceeded.
With just 11 players on the team,
Taylor plays nearly every minute

in practice.
VanDerveer appreciates her
contribution a great deal and even
awarded Taylor a scholarship in
December for the remainder of
the year. Though the grant is not
guaranteed for the future, Taylor
is in for the long haul. "I'm plan
ning on sticking this out for four
years," she says.
Taylor adds that her plans will
not change even if her playing
time does not increase. Her teams
often lost in high school, and she
is eryoying being around a winner.
"It's really a great feeling. I know
how to lose, so I know what the
other teams feel like when we
blow 'em out by 40 points.
"I have as much fun on the
bench jumping up and yelling at
the great plays people are making.
I told my parents and my brother
that each second I get is more
than I would've gotten if I hadn't
tried out for the team. I'm just
happy to get in there anytime I
do," she adds.

brother Gary, who is a junior,
plays for the football team, and
she liked the effect the school had
on him. "After he came back, he
was really a changed person," she
says."He was more open. You
could tell this was the place he
wanted to be."
Angela wanted to be here too.
She came with a plan to try and
make the team as a walk-on and
contribute any way she could. Her
expectations have been exceeded.
With just 11 players on the team,
Taylor plays nearly every minute

in practice.
VanDerveer appreciates her
contribution a great deal and even
awarded Taylor a scholarship in
December for the remainder of
the year. Though the grant is not
guaranteed for the future, Taylor
is in for the long haul. "I'm plan
ning on sticking this out for four
years," she says.
Taylor adds that her plans will
not change even if her playing
time does not increase. Her teams
often lost in high school, and she
is eryoying being around a winner.
"It's really a great feeling. I know
how to lose, so I know what the
other teams feel like when we
blow 'em out by 40 points.
"I have as much fun on the
bench jumping up and yelling at
the great plays people are making.
I told my parents and my brother
that each second I get is more
than I would've gotten if I hadn't
tried out for the team. I'm just
happy to get in there anytime I
do," she adds.
Freshman Val Whiting has a
lot of things in common with her
classmates on the women's bas
ketball team. But playing time is
not among them. Whiting is the
Cardinal's super-sub — she leads
the Cardinal in rebounding and
blocked shots and plays 23
minutes a game.
The team's other freshmen —
Molly Goodenbour, Chris Mac-
Murdo and Angela Taylor —
average 22 minutes combined. In
games, they are rarely in at
crunch time, but they are vital
keys to the team's success none
theless. Each works extremely
hard, and all three are being
counted on for the future.
Oddly enough, were it not for
some twists of fate, all three
might not be playing college bas
ketball at all — let alone for a
championship contender.
Goodenbour, a 5-foot-6 guard,
hails from the town of Waterloo,
lowa.
In 49 of the United States, bas
ketball is played with five players
on a side. In the other one, the

girl's game is played six-on-six.
The other one is lowa. Gooden
bour played six-on-six in seventh
grade, but does not remember it
fondly. "Six-on-six isn't even bas
ketball," she says. "It's just
weird." Three players on each
team, the guards, play nothing
but defense. The other three, the
forwards, play nothing but of
fense.
No one is allowed to cross mid
court. Though this anachronism
is still wildly popular, girls who
grow up on it have little chance
of playing in college because they
are unlikely to develop their skills
completely.
Fortunately for Goodenbour,
the wall of tradition was breached
a few years back. "My ninth-grade
season was the first year they
switched [to five-on-five]," she
says. The timing couldn't have
been more serendipitous.
Three years later, Goodenbour
was receiving All-America honors
from nearly everyone who follows
women's basketball. As a result,
she was a highly sought recruit.
Goodenbour says she chose Stan
ford over Duke, Virginia, Vander
bilt and Washington.

"The balance between athletics
and academics here was un
matched anywhere else," she says.
But that wasn't the only reason
she came here. "When I visited
and met the people on the team,
I saw how well everybody got
along and how close everybody
was. That's what tipped it."
The transition from being a big
time scorer to a little-used reserve
has sometimes been difficult for
her. "I'm not going to say it hasn't
been frustrating at times,"
Goodenbour notes. "I just have to
remind myself who I've been play
ing with. Jennifer [Azzi] and
Sonja [HenningJ are pushing me
to play better."
Coach Tara VanDerveer sees
the same thing. "Sonja is the best
thing for Molly," she says. "It's
almost like medicine in a way;
you don't like to take it. Every
day, playing against Sonja in prac
tice ... games are going to be
easy for her. She'll do really well.
She has improved tremendously
since day one."
Goodenbour knows her time
will come, with Azzi and Stacy
Parson graduating this season.
And she thinks the future is
bright — both for herself and the
Cardinal. "This year is the year,"
she says.
"In the future, I don't know.
We lose a few very good people.
With hard work in the summer,
though, they can be replaced. It
won't be the same team, but it
can be a team that's just as good."
MacMurdo's story is quite dif
ferent. She's 6-0 and actually a
sophomore. But last season she
played in just five games before
redshirting with a back injury. "I
talked to one doctor who said I
wasn't going to play again," she
recalls. "He said I had maybe a
20 percent chance. That really
crushed me."
She went and relayed the news
to VanDerveer. After a lengthy
discussion, they decided to seek
another opinion. "I held on to the
hope that I'd recover," she says.
And after having surgery on June
19, 1989 — "a date forever etched
in my mind" — to remove two
disks, MacMurdo began the long
road to recovery.
"The doctor said if you take
care of yourself, and do the rehab,
you should be playing," she adds.
"I didn't have any doubt. I knew
I was going to make it back."
Around the end of the summer,
she was able to start running
again. They school started and
basketball rolled around. "It was
a big transition from pretty much
not playing for a year to playing
with one of the top universities.
It took a while to get back into

Though they haven't seen much action this season, Angela Taylor,
top left; Chris MacMurdo, left; and Molly Goodenbour, above; will
be counted on heavily In the future.
American, MacMurdo is planning
on spending the summer here to
work out. Teammate Katy Steding
did the same thing a couple of
years back and is now one of the
best players in the country.
Coincidentally, MacMurdo is
one of the leading candidates to
replace Steding at small forward
next year. Though she's alter
nated between playing down low
and on the perimeter this season,
she sees her future on the outside.
"1 don't think anyone can
replace Katy," she says, adding
that she feels she'll bring a lot to
the small forward spot. "If it's a
matter of work that determines
whether a will be at that
position, I'm going to work the
hardest."
Unlike Goodenbour and Mac-
Murdo, Taylor was not a highly

touted prep player. As a matter
of fact, she almost gave up bas
ketball to attend Stanford. "As
you go up a level, there's less and
less people that can compete."
Taylor says."I realized that my
basketball career was coming to
an end [after high school]. I didn't
want it to, but I knew it was
coming."
For that reason, she concen
trated on academics, and Stanford
was where she wanted to be. Her
brother Gary, who is a junior,
plays for the football team, and

Though they haven't seen much action this season, Angela Taylor,
top left; Chris MacMurdo, left; and Molly Goodenbour, above; will
be counted on heavily In the future.
American, MacMurdo is planning
on spending the summer here to
work out. Teammate Katy Steding
did the same thing a couple of
years back and is now one of the
best players in the country.
Coincidentally, MacMurdo is
one of the leading candidates to
replace Steding at small forward
next year. Though she's alter
nated between playing down low
and on the perimeter this season,
she sees her future on the outside.
"1 don't think anyone can
replace Katy," she says, adding
that she feels she'll bring a lot to
the small forward spot. "If it's a
matter of work that determines
whether a will be at that
position, I'm going to work the
hardest."
Unlike Goodenbour and Mac-
Murdo, Taylor was not a highly

touted prep player. As a matter
of fact, she almost gave up bas
ketball to attend Stanford. "As
you go up a level, there's less and
less people that can compete."
Taylor says."I realized that my
basketball career was coming to
an end [after high school]. I didn't
want it to, but I knew it was
coming."
For that reason, she concen
trated on academics, and Stanford
was where she wanted to be. Her
brother Gary, who is a junior,
plays for the football team, and
she liked the effect the school had
on him. "After he came back, he
was really a changed person," she
says."He was more open. You
could tell this was the place he
wanted to be."
Angela wanted to be here too.
She came with a plan to try and
make the team as a walk-on and
contribute any way she could. Her
expectations have been exceeded.
With just 11 players on the team,
Taylor plays nearly every minute

in practice.
VanDerveer appreciates her
contribution a great deal and even
awarded Taylor a scholarship in
December for the remainder of
the year. Though the grant is not
guaranteed for the future, Taylor
is in for the long haul. "I'm plan
ning on sticking this out for four
years," she says.
Taylor adds that her plans will
not change even if her playing
time does not increase. Her teams
often lost in high school, and she
is eryoying being around a winner.
"It's really a great feeling. I know
how to lose, so I know what the
other teams feel like when we
blow 'em out by 40 points.
"I have as much fun on the
bench jumping up and yelling at
the great plays people are making.
I told my parents and my brother
that each second I get is more
than I would've gotten if I hadn't
tried out for the team. I'm just
happy to get in there anytime I
do," she adds.
