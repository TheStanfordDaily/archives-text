# Their time will come
## With clouded futures cleared up, freshmen wait in the wings 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Freshman Val Whiting has a
lot of things in common with her
classmates on the women's bas
ketball team. But playing time is
not among them. Whiting is the
Cardinal's super-sub — she leads
the Cardinal in rebounding and
blocked shots and plays 23
minutes a game.
The team's other freshmen —
Molly Goodenbour, Chris Mac-
Murdo and Angela Taylor —
average 22 minutes combined. In
games, they are rarely in at
crunch time, but they are vital
keys to the team's success none
theless. Each works extremely
hard, and all three are being
counted on for the future.
Oddly enough, were it not for
some twists of fate, all three
might not be playing college bas
ketball at all — let alone for a
championship contender.
Goodenbour, a 5-foot-6 guard,
hails from the town of Waterloo,
lowa.
In 49 of the United States, bas
ketball is played with five players
on a side. In the other one, the

girl's game is played six-on-six.
The other one is lowa. Gooden
bour played six-on-six in seventh
grade, but does not remember it
fondly. "Six-on-six isn't even bas
ketball," she says. "It's just
weird." Three players on each
team, the guards, play nothing
but defense. The other three, the
forwards, play nothing but of
fense.
No one is allowed to cross mid
court. Though this anachronism
is still wildly popular, girls who
grow up on it have little chance
of playing in college because they
are unlikely to develop their skills
completely.
Fortunately for Goodenbour,
the wall of tradition was breached
a few years back. "My ninth-grade
season was the first year they
switched [to five-on-five]," she
says. The timing couldn't have
been more serendipitous.
Three years later, Goodenbour
was receiving All-America honors
from nearly everyone who follows
women's basketball. As a result,
she was a highly sought recruit.
Goodenbour says she chose Stan
ford over Duke, Virginia, Vander
bilt and Washington.

"The balance between athletics
and academics here was un
matched anywhere else," she says.
But that wasn't the only reason
she came here. "When I visited
and met the people on the team,
I saw how well everybody got
along and how close everybody
was. That's what tipped it."
The transition from being a big
time scorer to a little-used reserve
has sometimes been difficult for
her. "I'm not going to say it hasn't
been frustrating at times,"
Goodenbour notes. "I just have to
remind myself who I've been play
ing with. Jennifer [Azzi] and
Sonja [HenningJ are pushing me
to play better."
Coach Tara VanDerveer sees
the same thing. "Sonja is the best
thing for Molly," she says. "It's
almost like medicine in a way;
you don't like to take it. Every
day, playing against Sonja in prac
tice ... games are going to be
easy for her. She'll do really well.
She has improved tremendously
since day one."
Goodenbour knows her time
will come, with Azzi and Stacy
Parson graduating this season.
And she thinks the future is
bright — both for herself and the
Cardinal. "This year is the year,"
she says.
"In the future, I don't know.
We lose a few very good people.
With hard work in the summer,
though, they can be replaced. It
won't be the same team, but it
can be a team that's just as good."
MacMurdo's story is quite dif
ferent. She's 6-0 and actually a
sophomore. But last season she
played in just five games before
redshirting with a back injury. "I
talked to one doctor who said I
wasn't going to play again," she
recalls. "He said I had maybe a
20 percent chance. That really
crushed me."
She went and relayed the news
to VanDerveer. After a lengthy
discussion, they decided to seek
another opinion. "I held on to the
hope that I'd recover," she says.
And after having surgery on June
19, 1989 — "a date forever etched
in my mind" — to remove two
disks, MacMurdo began the long
road to recovery.
"The doctor said if you take
care of yourself, and do the rehab,
you should be playing," she adds.
"I didn't have any doubt. I knew
I was going to make it back."
Around the end of the summer,
she was able to start running
again. They school started and
basketball rolled around. "It was
a big transition from pretty much
not playing for a year to playing
with one of the top universities.
It took a while to get back into
the flow," she says."I think my
skills are still a little bit down."

made her a high school All-
