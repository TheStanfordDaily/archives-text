# No arguments — this attorney is the ultimate fan

Peering intently at the action
through blue glasses, the slightly
built gray-haired woman sitting
in the stands directly behind the
Cardinal bench doesn't look like
an out-of-the-ordinary basketball
fan.
Appearances, however, can be
deceiving.
Palo Altan Laura Rothkopf is
not merely a fan, she is the wom
en's hoops aficionado.
"I'm not really involved with
the game," Rothkopf said. "I am
addicted to it. Specifically, I am
addicted to the 1989-90 women's
basketball season."
The trial lawyer attends every
Cardinal home game and sits di
rectly behind Coach Tara VanDer
veer in the first row of bleachers.

She has to be in Maples when the
opening buzzer sounds — she has
been known to leave friends be
hind if it means missing tipoff —
and arranges business trips to
coincide with Stanford Pacific 10
road trips.
The marriage seems to be an
odd couple. Not only has Rothkopf
never played basketball, she had
never even been to a women's
game before 1987. So why Cardi
nal women's basketball?
"At my first game during the
winter of 1987,1 noticed two won
derful athletes — Jennifer Azzi
and Sonja Henning. Jennifer's
athletic skill impressed me so
much I turned to my teenage son
who had talked me into going to
the game, and I said, 'Oh I get
it, basketball is like ballet only
rougher.' So I guess I first had
an interest in it as an art form."

Rothkopf slowly became in
trigued by the game, especially its
strategies, and began not only at
tending more contests but also
leading up on the sport. After
learning some of the rules and
picking out various strategies, she
became even more interested, es
pecially with the various "levels"
of the game.
"I found out that it's possible
to er\joy the game at a lot of dif
ferent intellectual levels, and
there are lots of related disciples.
There are lots of games within
the game."
Rothkopf cites the Stanford-
UCLA game in Los Angeles as an
example. An official called a foul
on Trisha Stenens and yelled out
that she had fouled out. Vanl)er
veer, after conferring with an as
sistant, registered a complaint:
Stevens was not in the game. Of

ficial response: complaint too
slow, ruling stands. "It was Kaf
kaesque," Rothkopf said.
The human aspect of basketball
is especially intriguing to Roth
kopf — personalities, interaction
and fallibility. "The fact that the
team lost in Seattle made the
game even more exciting to me,
made me even more addicted.
These are fallible human beings,
and we don't know whether they
are going to win or not."
While the lawyer enjoys all col
legiate basketball — she also holds
season tickets to the men's home
contests — she is more drawn to
the Cardinal women because of
the strictly amateur aspect of the
discipline. While men have an op
portunity to play professional bas
ketball, their female counterparts
only have the present to work for,
which puts the game in a different

light for the lawyer.
"These players are amateurs in
the classic sense —they're playing
for the love of the sport. They
don't have a lucrative contract
waiting for them. [The Cardinal
women] are also scholar-athletes
— they're the best of their gen
eration in academics and the best
of their generation in academic
skills. I know what Chris Mac-
Murdo means when she talks
about how hard it is to study
chemistry and prepare for a bas
ketball game.
Why the 1989-90 squad?
"The hook for me this season
is the team members and the
coaches and how they interact
during the game. They're very
verbal; they're really human
beings. If they were perfect, they
