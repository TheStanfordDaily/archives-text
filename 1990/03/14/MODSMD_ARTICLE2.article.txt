# Card faces stacked deck in NCAA tournament
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
This year's Final Four will be played on
the home court of defending national cham
pion Tennessee. The Lady Vols' home faith
ful can't wait. They've purchased 17,000
tickets out of the available 24,000 in an
ticipation of the event.
Of course, if Tennessee fails to reach the
end-of-the-month party, those tickets might
go unused. But they're not worried in
Knoxville.
Thanks to the vicissitudes of fate — and
a series of surprising decisions by the
NCAA tournament selection committee —
the Lady Vols' road to the Final Four ap
pears to be the smoothest of the four No.
1 seeds.
Next to No. 4 Tennessee (25-5), the high
est ranked team in the East is No. 12
Virginia.
Stanford (27-1) was granted the No. 1
seed in the West, which wiil allow the
Cardinal to play three straight home games
in the tournament. That's the good news.
However, second-rated Stanford is joined
in the region by the teams ranked fifth,
sixth and seventh in the final Associated
Press and USA Today polls.
Those teams, Georgia (25-4), Stephen F.
Austin (27-2) and UNLV (28-2) are seeded
two through four in the West. In addition,
No. 14 Long Beach State, No. 16 Hawaii,
No. 22 Arkansas and No. 24 Mississippi
are in the region. All told, the West can
boast of eight top 25 teams — more than
any other region.
The deep West has four teams among
the top seven and six among the elite 16.
"We tried very hard to balance out the
regions," said Judy Holland, chair of the
NCAA selection committee. "We didn't
want any region weaker or stronger than
the rest. Tennessee is paired up with the
winner of the ACC (Virginia) — a very
tough conference. I'm not sure there is
any imbalance in the brackets at all."
Leon Barmore, coach of No. 1 Louisiana
Tech, which is the No. 1 seed in the Mid
west, saw things differently. "I certainly
think it was deliberate, and I understand
that," Barmore said. "If the committee is
trying to attract 25,00 fans, it won't happen
if Tennessee doesn't have a legitimate shot
at the Final Four. That's not to say they

The West is the giant
killer.'
— Joe Ciampi,
Auburn coach

wouldn't get there anyway. But on paper,
the East does appear to be the easiest."
Stanford Coach Tar a VanDerveer echoed
a similar theme. "Our region is pretty
loaded at the top," she said. "It's pretty
obvious they want Tennessee in Knoxville."
Of course, despite the tough draw, the
Cardinal is a strong favorite to be there
as well. All Stanford has to do is capture
its second-round game against the Hawaii-
Montana winner to set up a probable show
down with UNLV. Then the Cardinal can
advance to face the Georgia-Stephen F.
Austin winner.
If Stanford completes all those tasks, the
team has the dubious honor of meeting
Tennessee in the semifinals. A win there
and the Cardinal is in the national cham
pionship game.
It's too hard to know for sure who'll be
the opposition, but Lousiana Tech and
Washington, the No. 1 seed in the Mideast,
are the most likely foes. Catch your breath
and let this sink in: Stanford might need
to beat the Nos. 16, 5, 6, 4 and 1 teams
— in that order — to bring home a national
crown.
"The West is the giant killer," said Joe
Ciampi, coach of lOth-ranked Auburn.
"That's the big toughie. Stanford has to
be ready to play a very physical game."
Likely, the Cardinal will be up to the
task. Though the team has not had many
challenges in recent weeks, Stanford's of
fense has been clicking lately. The Cardinal
has posted three 100-point performances
in the last five games. Also, the light
schedule has allowed Trisha Stevens and
Julie Zeilstra — both of whom have chronic
injuries — to get needed rest.
Seniors Jennifer Azzi, Stacy Parson and
Katy Steding can no longer say, "Wait 'til
next year." For the trio, it's now or never.
Wanting to win and making it happen are
different beasts, but Stanford seniors have
the ability to help take the team all the way.

Tennessee in the semifinals. A win there
and the Cardinal is in the national cham
pionship game.
It's too hard to know for sure who'll be
the opposition, but Lousiana Tech and
Washington, the No. 1 seed in the Mideast,
are the most likely foes. Catch your breath
and let this sink in: Stanford might need
to beat the Nos. 16, 5, 6, 4 and 1 teams
— in that order — to bring home a national
crown.
"The West is the giant killer," said Joe
Ciampi, coach of lOth-ranked Auburn.
"That's the big toughie. Stanford has to
be ready to play a very physical game."
Likely, the Cardinal will be up to the
task. Though the team has not had many
challenges in recent weeks, Stanford's of
fense has been clicking lately. The Cardinal
has posted three 100-point performances
in the last five games. Also, the light
schedule has allowed Trisha Stevens and
Julie Zeilstra — both of whom have chronic
injuries — to get needed rest.
Seniors Jennifer Azzi, Stacy Parson and
Katy Steding can no longer say, "Wait 'til
next year." For the trio, it's now or never.
Wanting to win and making it happen are
different beasts, but Stanford seniors have
the ability to help take the team all the way.

toughest in the field.
This year's Final Four will be played on
the home court of defending national cham
pion Tennessee. The Lady Vols' home faith
ful can't wait. They've purchased 17,000
tickets out of the available 24,000 in an
ticipation of the event.
Of course, if Tennessee fails to reach the
end-of-the-month party, those tickets might
go unused. But they're not worried in
Knoxville.
Thanks to the vicissitudes of fate — and
a series of surprising decisions by the
NCAA tournament selection committee —
the Lady Vols' road to the Final Four ap
pears to be the smoothest of the four No.
1 seeds.
Next to No. 4 Tennessee (25-5), the high
est ranked team in the East is No. 12
Virginia.
Stanford (27-1) was granted the No. 1
seed in the West, which wiil allow the
Cardinal to play three straight home games
in the tournament. That's the good news.
However, second-rated Stanford is joined
in the region by the teams ranked fifth,
sixth and seventh in the final Associated
Press and USA Today polls.
Those teams, Georgia (25-4), Stephen F.
Austin (27-2) and UNLV (28-2) are seeded
two through four in the West. In addition,
No. 14 Long Beach State, No. 16 Hawaii,
No. 22 Arkansas and No. 24 Mississippi
are in the region. All told, the West can
boast of eight top 25 teams — more than
any other region.
The deep West has four teams among
the top seven and six among the elite 16.
"We tried very hard to balance out the
regions," said Judy Holland, chair of the
NCAA selection committee. "We didn't
want any region weaker or stronger than
the rest. Tennessee is paired up with the
winner of the ACC (Virginia) — a very
tough conference. I'm not sure there is
any imbalance in the brackets at all."
Leon Barmore, coach of No. 1 Louisiana
Tech, which is the No. 1 seed in the Mid
west, saw things differently. "I certainly
think it was deliberate, and I understand
that," Barmore said. "If the committee is
trying to attract 25,00 fans, it won't happen
if Tennessee doesn't have a legitimate shot
at the Final Four. That's not to say they

The West is the giant
killer.'

Auburn coach

wouldn't get there anyway. But on paper,
the East does appear to be the easiest."
Stanford Coach Tar a VanDerveer echoed
a similar theme. "Our region is pretty
loaded at the top," she said. "It's pretty
obvious they want Tennessee in Knoxville."
Of course, despite the tough draw, the
Cardinal is a strong favorite to be there
as well. All Stanford has to do is capture
its second-round game against the Hawaii-
Montana winner to set up a probable show
down with UNLV. Then the Cardinal can
advance to face the Georgia-Stephen F.
Austin winner.
If Stanford completes all those tasks, the
team has the dubious honor of meeting
Tennessee in the semifinals. A win there
and the Cardinal is in the national cham
pionship game.
