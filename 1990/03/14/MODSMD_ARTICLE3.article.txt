# VanDerveer's five-year plan is nearing completion
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
On the court, the Stanford
women's basketball team plays
beautiful music together. Like any
orchestra, though, they wouldn't
be anywhere without a conductor.
For the fifth straight year, Tara
VanDerveer is waving the baton
for the Cardinal. Over that
stretch, Stanford is 109-38. For
all the contributions made by Jen
nifer Azzi, Katy Steding and the
like, hardly anyone would argue
that Stanford wouldn't be where
it is today without VanDerveer.
Before coming to Stanford,
VanDerveer was immensely suc
cessful at Ohio State. And, even
though the Cardinal did not
achieve much under her predeces
sor Dotty McCrea, the fact Van-
Derveer went west was not that
much of a surprise.
"We played Stanford the year
before I came," she says."I could
spell Stanford, and I knew where
it was. I went to an academic high
school. Personally, for me, I
thought this would have been a
great place to go and play basket
ball. When the Stanford job
opened up, I had this sinking
feeling in my stomach. I turned
to one of my assistants and said,
'I think I'm going to take this
job.' "
When she made that remark,
she had not even interviewed with
Andy Geiger yet. But she had that
feeling . . .
Then people started giving her
all the reasons in the world not
to take the job. "My father said,
'Don't do it; you're crazy; you'll
never find enough good kids to
beat teams like Ohio State,' " she
remembers. "Then it almost be
came a challenge. People said ,
'You'll get burial.' "
Finally, she says, the negative

reaction was too much to pass up.
"I thought, 'Hey, I want to do it
just to show I can do it,' " she
said of taking the job and making
Stanford a winner.
"I just got a real good sense,"
she said of her visit here. She saw
Geiger was committed to having
a winning team. "I thought, 'This
is some place I think I could be
happy and accomplish goals,' "
she remembers.
"I don't know too many coaches
that don't want to win a national
championship, that don't want to
go to the Final Four. That's a
dream that everybody has, and I
have it too."
Today Stanford is on the verge
of accomplishing some of those
goals, but looking back on it, she
realizes the chance she was
taking. "It was a definite risk,"
she says. "[And] our success now
is very fragile. Where we would
be without Jennifer [Azzi]? Where
would we be without Sor\ja [Hen
ning]?"
Fortunately, that is not some
thing she has to worry about. Not
only does she have Azzi and Hen
ning, she has Steding, Trisha
Stevens and a host of other gifted
players.
Many of today's Cardinal stars
were recruited at a time when the
team was not successful. VanDer
veer especially remembers her
first class — Azzi, Steding and
Stacy Parson. "They welcomed
the challenge," she says. "Jennifer
I'll always respect for accepting
that challenge and saying, 'I'm
going to go to a place and put it
on the map.' "
VanDerveer credits the team for
helping to bring that trio to Stan
ford. "The thing that recruited
Jennifer, Katy and Stacy was
when they met people on the team
who really loved being at Stan
ford," she says. "Those people

wanted the team to be good. They
wanted Jennifer to come here.
They weren't saying, 'Here comes
that hot shot from Tennessee,
there goes my playing time.' "
The coach also made a point of
showing that winning and Stan
ford go hand in hand. "We could
say look at women's volleyball,
they made it to the Final Four.
If they can do it why can't we?"
she says.
"If baseball can win a national
championship, why can't we?
Look at [John] McEnroe and
[Johnl Elway."
VanDerveer also notes that

Stanford tends to attract
motivated people, the type who
get things done. "Jennifer is a
great example," she says. "She
did not start out as an All-
American her freshman year. She
made herself one. She kind of
reflects our team."
As the wins have began to out
number the losses, the success
could have gone to people's heads,
and individual egos could have
torn the fragile fabric apart. It
has not turned out that way, Van-
Derveer says, because "people on
our team have a big-picture per
spective. The leaders on our team

set the tone.
"If Sorya Henning went into the
locker room after every game,
grabbed the stat sheet and said,
'Hey, I didn't get my 15 points
tonight, then we'd have a prob
lem.' "
Instead, a team loaded with
stars coexists in the galaxy known
as the Stanford Cardinal. And,
VanDerveer the astronomer can
gaze at it in delightful wonder as
the goals she set for herself a
half-decade ago have transformed
from wishes upon shooting stars
to very real possibilities.

If they can do it why can't we?"
she says.
"If baseball can win a national
championship, why can't we?
Look at [John] McEnroe and
[Johnl Elway."
VanDerveer also notes that

Stanford tends to attract
motivated people, the type who
get things done. "Jennifer is a
great example," she says. "She
did not start out as an All-
American her freshman year. She
made herself one. She kind of
reflects our team."
As the wins have began to out
number the losses, the success
could have gone to people's heads,
and individual egos could have
torn the fragile fabric apart. It
has not turned out that way, Van-
Derveer says, because "people on
our team have a big-picture per
spective. The leaders on our team

set the tone.
"If Sorya Henning went into the
locker room after every game,
grabbed the stat sheet and said,
'Hey, I didn't get my 15 points
tonight, then we'd have a prob
lem.' "
Instead, a team loaded with
stars coexists in the galaxy known
as the Stanford Cardinal. And,
VanDerveer the astronomer can
gaze at it in delightful wonder as
the goals she set for herself a
half-decade ago have transformed
from wishes upon shooting stars
to very real possibilities.

In just five years, Coach Tara VanDerveer has brought Stanford women's basketball from the depths
of obscurity to the brink of capturing a national championship.
On the court, the Stanford
women's basketball team plays
beautiful music together. Like any
orchestra, though, they wouldn't
be anywhere without a conductor.
For the fifth straight year, Tara
VanDerveer is waving the baton
for the Cardinal. Over that
stretch, Stanford is 109-38. For
all the contributions made by Jen
nifer Azzi, Katy Steding and the
like, hardly anyone would argue
that Stanford wouldn't be where
it is today without VanDerveer.
Before coming to Stanford,
VanDerveer was immensely suc
cessful at Ohio State. And, even
though the Cardinal did not
achieve much under her predeces
sor Dotty McCrea, the fact Van-
Derveer went west was not that
much of a surprise.
"We played Stanford the year
before I came," she says."I could
spell Stanford, and I knew where
it was. I went to an academic high
school. Personally, for me, I
thought this would have been a
great place to go and play basket
ball. When the Stanford job
opened up, I had this sinking
feeling in my stomach. I turned
to one of my assistants and said,
'I think I'm going to take this
job.' "
When she made that remark,
she had not even interviewed with
Andy Geiger yet. But she had that
feeling . . .
Then people started giving her
all the reasons in the world not
to take the job. "My father said,
'Don't do it; you're crazy; you'll
never find enough good kids to
beat teams like Ohio State,' " she
remembers. "Then it almost be
came a challenge. People said ,
'You'll get burial.' "
Finally, she says, the negative

reaction was too much to pass up.
"I thought, 'Hey, I want to do it
just to show I can do it,' " she
said of taking the job and making
Stanford a winner.
"I just got a real good sense,"
she said of her visit here. She saw
Geiger was committed to having
a winning team. "I thought, 'This
is some place I think I could be
happy and accomplish goals,' "
she remembers.
"I don't know too many coaches
that don't want to win a national
championship, that don't want to
go to the Final Four. That's a
dream that everybody has, and I
have it too."
Today Stanford is on the verge
of accomplishing some of those
goals, but looking back on it, she
realizes the chance she was
taking. "It was a definite risk,"
she says. "[And] our success now
is very fragile. Where we would
be without Jennifer [Azzi]? Where
would we be without Sor\ja [Hen
ning]?"
Fortunately, that is not some
thing she has to worry about. Not
only does she have Azzi and Hen
ning, she has Steding, Trisha
Stevens and a host of other gifted
players.
Many of today's Cardinal stars
were recruited at a time when the
team was not successful. VanDer
veer especially remembers her
first class — Azzi, Steding and
Stacy Parson. "They welcomed
the challenge," she says. "Jennifer
I'll always respect for accepting
that challenge and saying, 'I'm
going to go to a place and put it
on the map.' "
VanDerveer credits the team for
helping to bring that trio to Stan
ford. "The thing that recruited
Jennifer, Katy and Stacy was
when they met people on the team
who really loved being at Stan
ford," she says. "Those people

wanted the team to be good. They
wanted Jennifer to come here.
They weren't saying, 'Here comes
that hot shot from Tennessee,
there goes my playing time.' "
The coach also made a point of
showing that winning and Stan
ford go hand in hand. "We could
say look at women's volleyball,
they made it to the Final Four.
If they can do it why can't we?"
she says.
"If baseball can win a national
championship, why can't we?
Look at [John] McEnroe and
[Johnl Elway."
