Two seasons ago, the Stanford Cardinal
lost just four regular-season games.
Last year, they suffered half as many
setbacks, fallingjust twice before the NCAA
tournament.
This time through, the women's basket
ball team has felt the agony of defeat just
once.
Twenty-seven and one. Just one step
short of perfection.

Though Stanford would finish the year
as one of the nation's highest-scoring
teams, the Cardinal did not light up the
scoreboard in the season opener. Facing
Michigan State at the Communiplex Classic
in Cincinnati Nov. 24, Stanford scored
what would be its lowest total of the season
in a 73-63 triumph.
Just 24 hours later, the team cranked it
up a notch — or three. Ohio University
was run out of the building as Stanford
rang up 113 points while allowing just 65.
Two weeks later, on Dec. 10, the home
fans finally got a chance to see the women
in action against sacrificial lamb San Diego
State. Katy Steding poured in a career-high
27 as Stanford set a school record for mar
gin of victory. The Cardinal conquered the
Aztecs by 64, 109-45.
That game was just an appetizer. Five
days later, the main course arrived in the
form of defending national champion Ten
nessee. Last season, the Lady Vols
demolished the Cardinal 83-60, and Coach
Tara VanDerveer would later say, "I don't
know if we'll ever beat them."
Fortunately, the coach made a rare mis
take in judgment. It was apparent from
the tipoff that Stanford was not intimidated
by Tennessee. Before a record crowd of
5,425 (officially, though the total appeared
quite a bit higher), the Cardinal moved
ahead early and took a 38-31 halflime lead.
Early in the second stanza, the Lady
Vols trimmed the margin to one at 45-44.
Point guard Sorya Henning, who led all
scorers with 23 points, then put a charge
into Stanford's offense — and the Cardinal
began to pull away.
Back-to-back baskets by Trisha Stevens
gave Stanford a 71-58 lead with five
minutes left; in the game. Forty seconds
later, Jennifer Azzi buried a three-pointer,
Tennessee called timeout and the game was
all but over. The Cardinal's breakthrough
85-71 victory set the stage for what was
to come.
"We hadn't really beaten anybody that
big," VanDerveer said after the Tennessee
game. "It'll really be a challenge for us to

keep improving from here."
Stanford answered the challenge in the
subsequent weeks. The Cardinal went East
to pick up a pair of road wins at Holy
Cross and Boston College. Next up was
the Cardinal Classic — Stanford's end-of
the-year, mini-tournament. In two games,
Julie Zeilstra tallied 47 points as Stanford
drubbed Eastern Michigan (105-58) and
Providence (89-64) to win the tourney.
USF visited Maples — and lost — before
Stanford opened the Pacific 10 Conference
schedule in the state of Oregon. Bye, bye
Beavers; so long, Ducks. The Cardinal had
two conference wins heading into a show
down with Washington — then ranked
seventh and the team most likely to chal
lenge Stanford for Pac-10 supremacy.
In perhaps its most dominant perform
ance of the season, the Cardinal
blitzkrieged the Husky women 102-62.
Washington was stunned, shocked and em
barrassed.
Stanford, now 12-0, steamrolled Wash
ington State, UCLA and USC to set another
school record. With 15 consecutive wins to
start the season, the team bettered the
mark of 14 set in 1987-88.
A date with Long Beach State Jan. 23
came up on the calendar. ESPN was in
town to televise the sixth-ranked 49ers and
the second-ranked Cardinal. Stevens
showed a national audience that women
can indeed play the low post as she rang
up a career-high 35, and Stanford pasted
Long Beach 105-91.
Arizona, Arizona State and California
were the next three victims, as Stanford
moved to 19-0.
The Cardinal went on the road to Wash
ington State. On the way to Pullman, the
team bus was stopped by a highway patrol
roadblock. A driving snowstorm made the
road impassable, and Stanford had to spend
the night on the floor of Colfax High School.
Showing no signs of fatigue, the Cardinal
hammered the Cougars 90-64 the next
night. Two days later in Seattle, though,
the Huskies were prepared to erase the
bitter memory of their blowout in Maples.
Washington Coach Chris Gobrecht had
done a lot of trash-talking about Stanford
following the debacle. "We don't like them,"
she said, fueling interest in the rematch.
The teams did not disappoint. Stanford
fell behind midway through the first half
and was forced to play catch-up for the
first time this season. Finally, when Steding
hit a three-pointer with 2:31 left in the
game, the Cardinal had a 73-71 lead.
But the night belonged to the Huskies.
Before a sellout crowd of 7,704 — one of
the largest for any basketball game in Hec
Edmundson Pavilion — Washington
regained the lead on baskets by Amy Mick

elson and Laurie Merlino. The duo scored
46 points.
When the horn sounded, the Huskies
had won 81-78 and Stanford slipped to
20-1. "We have people in a comfort zone,"
VanDerveer said. "Hopefully, the loss will
get their attention."
Stanford returned to California after the
loss to hammer the L.A. schools. The Car

dinal then headed for Arizona and brought
back two 100-point performances — the
first since the Long Beach game.
Cal was overmatched in a 112-84 defeat
at Maples. Over 4,000 fans were in attend
ance at Maples for the third time this
season. Finally, Stanford closed out its
schedule with victories over Oregon and
Oregon State.

Julie Zellstra and her teammates were nearly perfect in 1989-90. Their only defeat
came on the road against Washington, one of the nation's top teams.
Two seasons ago, the Stanford Cardinal
lost just four regular-season games.
Last year, they suffered half as many
setbacks, fallingjust twice before the NCAA

back two 100-point performances — the
first since the Long Beach game.
Cal was overmatched in a 112-84 defeat
at Maples. Over 4,000 fans were in attend
ance at Maples for the third time this
season. Finally, Stanford closed out its
schedule with victories over Oregon and
Oregon State.

Julie Zellstra and her teammates were nearly perfect in 1989-90. Their only defeat
came on the road against Washington, one of the nation's top teams.
Two seasons ago, the Stanford Cardinal
lost just four regular-season games.
Last year, they suffered half as many
setbacks, fallingjust twice before the NCAA
tournament.
This time through, the women's basket
ball team has felt the agony of defeat just
once.
Twenty-seven and one. Just one step
short of perfection.

Though Stanford would finish the year
as one of the nation's highest-scoring
teams, the Cardinal did not light up the
scoreboard in the season opener. Facing
Michigan State at the Communiplex Classic
in Cincinnati Nov. 24, Stanford scored
what would be its lowest total of the season
in a 73-63 triumph.
Just 24 hours later, the team cranked it
up a notch — or three. Ohio University
was run out of the building as Stanford
rang up 113 points while allowing just 65.
Two weeks later, on Dec. 10, the home
fans finally got a chance to see the women
in action against sacrificial lamb San Diego
State. Katy Steding poured in a career-high
27 as Stanford set a school record for mar
gin of victory. The Cardinal conquered the
Aztecs by 64, 109-45.
That game was just an appetizer. Five
days later, the main course arrived in the
form of defending national champion Ten
nessee. Last season, the Lady Vols
demolished the Cardinal 83-60, and Coach
Tara VanDerveer would later say, "I don't
know if we'll ever beat them."
Fortunately, the coach made a rare mis
take in judgment. It was apparent from
the tipoff that Stanford was not intimidated
by Tennessee. Before a record crowd of
5,425 (officially, though the total appeared
quite a bit higher), the Cardinal moved
ahead early and took a 38-31 halflime lead.
Early in the second stanza, the Lady
Vols trimmed the margin to one at 45-44.
Point guard Sorya Henning, who led all
scorers with 23 points, then put a charge
into Stanford's offense — and the Cardinal
began to pull away.
Back-to-back baskets by Trisha Stevens
gave Stanford a 71-58 lead with five
minutes left; in the game. Forty seconds
later, Jennifer Azzi buried a three-pointer,
Tennessee called timeout and the game was
all but over. The Cardinal's breakthrough
85-71 victory set the stage for what was
to come.
"We hadn't really beaten anybody that
big," VanDerveer said after the Tennessee
game. "It'll really be a challenge for us to

keep improving from here."
Stanford answered the challenge in the
subsequent weeks. The Cardinal went East
to pick up a pair of road wins at Holy
Cross and Boston College. Next up was
the Cardinal Classic — Stanford's end-of
the-year, mini-tournament. In two games,
Julie Zeilstra tallied 47 points as Stanford
drubbed Eastern Michigan (105-58) and
Providence (89-64) to win the tourney.
USF visited Maples — and lost — before
Stanford opened the Pacific 10 Conference
schedule in the state of Oregon. Bye, bye
Beavers; so long, Ducks. The Cardinal had
two conference wins heading into a show
down with Washington — then ranked
seventh and the team most likely to chal
lenge Stanford for Pac-10 supremacy.
In perhaps its most dominant perform
ance of the season, the Cardinal
blitzkrieged the Husky women 102-62.
Washington was stunned, shocked and em
barrassed.
Stanford, now 12-0, steamrolled Wash
ington State, UCLA and USC to set another
school record. With 15 consecutive wins to
start the season, the team bettered the
mark of 14 set in 1987-88.
A date with Long Beach State Jan. 23
came up on the calendar. ESPN was in
town to televise the sixth-ranked 49ers and
the second-ranked Cardinal. Stevens
showed a national audience that women
can indeed play the low post as she rang
up a career-high 35, and Stanford pasted
Long Beach 105-91.
Arizona, Arizona State and California
were the next three victims, as Stanford
moved to 19-0.
The Cardinal went on the road to Wash
ington State. On the way to Pullman, the
team bus was stopped by a highway patrol
roadblock. A driving snowstorm made the
road impassable, and Stanford had to spend
the night on the floor of Colfax High School.
Showing no signs of fatigue, the Cardinal
hammered the Cougars 90-64 the next
night. Two days later in Seattle, though,
the Huskies were prepared to erase the
bitter memory of their blowout in Maples.
Washington Coach Chris Gobrecht had
done a lot of trash-talking about Stanford
following the debacle. "We don't like them,"
she said, fueling interest in the rematch.
The teams did not disappoint. Stanford
fell behind midway through the first half
and was forced to play catch-up for the
first time this season. Finally, when Steding
hit a three-pointer with 2:31 left in the
game, the Cardinal had a 73-71 lead.
But the night belonged to the Huskies.
Before a sellout crowd of 7,704 — one of
the largest for any basketball game in Hec
Edmundson Pavilion — Washington
regained the lead on baskets by Amy Mick

elson and Laurie Merlino. The duo scored
46 points.
When the horn sounded, the Huskies
had won 81-78 and Stanford slipped to
20-1. "We have people in a comfort zone,"
VanDerveer said. "Hopefully, the loss will
get their attention."
Stanford returned to California after the
loss to hammer the L.A. schools. The Car

dinal then headed for Arizona and brought
back two 100-point performances — the
first since the Long Beach game.
Cal was overmatched in a 112-84 defeat
at Maples. Over 4,000 fans were in attend
