# Hey, who is that guy anyway?
## Chris Jones is the Stanford women's man behind the scenes 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
In the NBA, the "twelfth man"
is the guy who sits on the end of
the bench. He rarely gets into a
game, even in garbage time.
Usually, he's a role player who
does a couple of things well, but
not often enough to earn a lot of
playing time.
The Stanford women's team has
a rather unusual "twelfth man,"
though. What makes him stand
out is that he, well, is a he. Three
days a week in practice, the No.
2-ranked team in the nation takes
to the court with 11 women and
junior Chris Jones.
When the season started back
in November, the Cardinal had
13 players and Jones was over
seas. But just before the team
was to play an exhibition with the
Spanish National Team, team
members Tammy Svoboda and
Celeste Lavoie announced they
were leaving Stanford.
Halfway around the world,
Jones had not heard the news.
When he returned in January,
though, he ran into Trisha
Stevens and Sonja Henning. Jones
knew Stevens well. "1 practiced
with her last spring," he says,
explaining that he met her fresh
man year.
They became friends, and he
began to work out with the team
in the unofficial scrimmages that
take place after the season.

It's not essential to
my role on the team
to be a person who
has to score, who has
to dominate.'

"While I was overseas, I was
thinking about doing some sort
of managing with the team,"
Jones remembers. "Then 1 came
back, and Trisha and Soi\ja told
me, 'Tammy and Celeste are gone,
and we'd like someone to help out
the team stuff and practice with
us.' w
Jones went to see Coach Tara
VanDerveer and was surprised at
how favorably she reacted. Before
he knew it, he had made the team.
Though he'll never see even a
second of actual playing time,
Jones is er\joying his chance to be
part of big-time college basketball.
"I could have potentially played
at a Division 111 school with a lot
of work," he says. But the self
described "defensive specialist"
wanted to be at Stanford.
Though he was never much of
a scorer in high school, that's not
a problem for Jones when he
works out with the Stanford wom
en. His role on the Cardinal is to
present challenges for the team.
"These days, the coaches are

having me crash the boards and
be like a big inside player because
that's what the team might be
facing down the road [in the
NCAA tournament]," he says.
Being the only man among the
women might make someone a bit
less aggressive, but not Jones. "I
get more than my share of phys
ical abuse," he says. "[So] I don't
hesitate to play as physical as I
can. I'm not there to hurt anyway,
but if I don't play physical, I'm
not preparing them."
Jones says freshman Val
Whiting is particularly tough to
play against. Since she does not
back down to him, he "treats her
like any other player," he says.
With that stereotype aside,
what do Jones' friends think
about his day job? "Most of them
think it's really, really cool," he
says. "They say they'd like to be
doing it."
They're jealous because they
know Jones enjoys himself, and
they can see he does not take
things too seriously. "I don't have
an ego about getting beat one-on
one by Soi\ja Henning," he says.
"It's not essential to my role on
the team to be a person who has
to score, who has to dominate.
"I'm definitely competitive, and
I get frustrated with myself for
doing dumb things. But anything
I can do to contribute to a national
championship, its something
that's really positive. That's im
portant to me."
