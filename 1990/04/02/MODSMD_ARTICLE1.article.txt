## Stanford fulfills dream, outguns Auburn 88-81 for NCAA title 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Two and a half
hours after winning their 32nd game of
the season, the Stanford women's basket
ball team was on a bus bound for Oak
Ridge, a town of 29,000 in East Tennessee.
They were already in good spirits when
Aretha Franklin's "Respect" began to play
on the stereo.
Suddenly, the Cardinal 11 jumped up
and burst into song. At maximum volume
they sang along with Aretha as she belted
out: "All I want — is just a little respect.
Just a little bit. Just a little bit . . . Sock
it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock
it to me."
Like Rodney Dangerfield, Aretha will
probably be making her request for time
immemorial. After winning their first na
tional championship yesterday, though, the
Stanford women need not ask for it any
longer.
Friday night, the Cardinal advanced to
within one step of the NCAA title by
beating Virginia. The victory was the
team's 100 th in the last four seasons. One
might think that would be an impressive
enough achievement considering Stanford
won just 46 times in the previous quad
rennium.
Three team members — one from Syl
mar, Calif.; one from Lake Oswego, Ore.;
and one from Oak Ridge, Tenn. — saw
things a bit differently. Win No. 101 would
be the fulfillment of a dream that took
root in the autumn of 1986, when Stacy
Parson, Katy Steding and Jennifer Azzi

were freshmen, and women's basketball at
Stanford was little more than a curiosity.
The dream was to be crowned national
champs, and it became a reality in the
trio's final collegiate game before a women's
Final Four record crowd of 20,023 in the
Thompson-Boling Arena.
Azzi and Steding have teamed with
juniors Soi\ja Henning and Trisha Stevens
to start 90 of the past 94 games. As a unit,
the growing success of the Cardinal's "Fab
Four" has been critical to the team's rise
to national prominence. Yesterday, the
foursome was in top form as they combined
to score 72 of Stanford's points in an 88-81
defeat of Auburn in the national title game.
Overwhelmed by emotion, Azzi said: "I
don't know if you can really put it into
words. The thing that's really special to
me is that we all care about each other so
much. I don't think you'll find that on a
lot of teams. We've worked really hard,
and it's nice to know it paid off."
Said Henning: "We stuck together
(throughout the season). We were down to
11 players. We knew what our goal was.
We had it up in the locker room from day
one." She was referring to a piece of paper
that read: "NCAA champions 1990 — Get
comfortable with it."
They also knew that to achieve that goal
they would have to combine their talents
to form a well-oiled machine. Selfish play
and concern for individual statistics were
not a part of that machine this year, and
yesterday was no exception.
"It's kind of been the same story all
