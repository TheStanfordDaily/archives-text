## Stanford fulfills dream, outguns Auburn 88-81 for NCAA title 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Two and a half
hours after winning their 32nd game of
the season, the Stanford women's basket
ball team was on a bus bound for Oak
Ridge, a town of 29,000 in East Tennessee.
They were already in good spirits when
Aretha Franklin's "Respect" began to play
on the stereo.
Suddenly, the Cardinal 11 jumped up
and burst into song. At maximum volume
they sang along with Aretha as she belted
out: "All I want — is just a little respect.
Just a little bit. Just a little bit . . . Sock
it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock
it to me."
Like Rodney Dangerfield, Aretha will
probably be making her request for time
immemorial. After winning their first na
tional championship yesterday, though, the
Stanford women need not ask for it any
longer.
Friday night, the Cardinal advanced to
within one step of the NCAA title by
beating Virginia. The victory was the
team's 100 th in the last four seasons. One
might think that would be an impressive
enough achievement considering Stanford
won just 46 times in the previous quad
rennium.
Three team members — one from Syl
mar, Calif.; one from Lake Oswego, Ore.;
and one from Oak Ridge, Tenn. — saw
things a bit differently. Win No. 101 would
be the fulfillment of a dream that took
root in the autumn of 1986, when Stacy
Parson, Katy Steding and Jennifer Azzi

were freshmen, and women's basketball at
Stanford was little more than a curiosity.
The dream was to be crowned national
champs, and it became a reality in the
trio's final collegiate game before a women's
Final Four record crowd of 20,023 in the
Thompson-Boling Arena.
Azzi and Steding have teamed with
juniors Soi\ja Henning and Trisha Stevens
to start 90 of the past 94 games. As a unit,
the growing success of the Cardinal's "Fab
Four" has been critical to the team's rise
to national prominence. Yesterday, the
foursome was in top form as they combined
to score 72 of Stanford's points in an 88-81
defeat of Auburn in the national title game.
Overwhelmed by emotion, Azzi said: "I
don't know if you can really put it into
words. The thing that's really special to
me is that we all care about each other so
much. I don't think you'll find that on a
lot of teams. We've worked really hard,
and it's nice to know it paid off."
Said Henning: "We stuck together
(throughout the season). We were down to
11 players. We knew what our goal was.
We had it up in the locker room from day
one." She was referring to a piece of paper
that read: "NCAA champions 1990 — Get
comfortable with it."
They also knew that to achieve that goal
they would have to combine their talents
to form a well-oiled machine. Selfish play
and concern for individual statistics were
not a part of that machine this year, and
yesterday was no exception.

season long," Coach Tara VanDer
veer said after the championship
game. "It was a total team effort.
The coach praised her troops
for working together to bring the
ball up against the Tigers'
vaunted pressure defense and pro
viding a varied offensive attack
that was too much for Auburn to
handle.

Women's Basketball

"They have so many weapons
. . . so many weapons," Tiger
Coach Joe Ciampi said. "Defen
sively it created so many problems
for us."
Knowing they would have to
give up something, Auburn's plan
was to silence the Cardinal's big
guns and hope for the best. "We
had anticipated taking out
Stevens, Azzi and Steding,"
Ciampi said. That left Henning
free to make things happen. So
she did.
"Sonja Henning really did a job
for them with 21 points and nine
rebounds," Ciampi added. "We
were going to slough off her, and
we found out our game plan was
in trouble."
Not just as far as Henning was
concerned. Ciampi knew his team
would have to get out quickly on
the Cardinal's three-point
shooters as well.
In the early going, the Tigers
were failing on all fronts. Azzi,
Stevens and Steding combined for
20 points, including 15 on treys,
by the time eight minutes had
ticked off the clock. Stanford's
bombs-away strategy gave the
team a 22-11 lead.
"We really look for that shot a
lot," VanDerveer said of the three,
"and I encourage them to take it."
She went on to explain that the
Auburn defense played a role in
dictacting her strategy. "We ha
ven't been pressed much this
season and basically for a reason.
"We might turn it over a couple
of times, but it opens up our
three-point shooting," she ex
plained.
In the game, Stanford set Final
Four records for three-pointers
made (11) and attempted (26).
Steding attempted 15 treys alone
and sunk six of them, smashing
the previous highs for a women's
final. No one had attempted or
made more than two.
Azzi chipped in four treys on
eight attempts, and Henning hit
one as well. It was just the 10th
of the season for the Stanford
point guard.
But the Cardinal did not hit a

three in the final 12 minutes of
the first half as the team con
verted on just four of its last 13
field goal attempts overall.
Meanwhile, the Tigers clawed
their way back. Carolyn Jones,
who finished with a game-high
24 points, sunk two free throws
to key a 30-10 run that put
Auburn ahead 41-32. Jones scored
six more points from the line dur
ing the spurt, as the Tigers
seemed to be taking control.
"We kind of got a little bit com
fortable in our lead," Steding said.
"We stopped working as hard on
defense and keeping them off the
boards."
VanDerveer then made a sub
stitution that might have saved
the game. With 2:07 remaining,
she sat Martha Richards down
and sent in Val Whiting. The swap
meant the Cardinal had a
frontline of Stevens, Whiting and
Julie Zeilstra — all 6-foot-3.
Immediately, it began to pay
dividends. Whiting banked in a
7-foot jumper to trim the deficit
to seven. After Henning completed
an old-fashioned three-point play,
Whiting scored again to pull Stan
ford within 41-39.
Azzi made both ends of a one
and-one to knot things at 41-41
heading into the intermission.
Auburn had clearly lost the eye
of the Tiger as well.
It is an age old basketball cliche
that games are won and lost in
the first five minutes of the sec
ond half. Like many cliches, how
ever, this one is most often true.
With Henning bringing the ball
up against the press, Stanford
outscored Auburn 16-7 to open
the second stanza. The Cardinal's
inside game, which had been er
ratic against Virginia Friday, fi
nally got on track as Stevens
scored six points during the run
and Stanford opened up a 57-48
bulge.
For six minutes the team went
back and forth until an Azzi three
pointer made it 70-57 with 7:54
to play. Auburn answered with
five straight points on a Jones
three and a turnaround jumper
by C.C. Hayden.
Stanford called timeout, and
VanDerveer once again told her
bomber squadron to go on a
sortie. Henning and Steding
nailed treys on consecutive offen
sive trips to keep the Tigers at
bay.
Just 94 seconds remained in the
game, and the scoreboard showed
Stanford ahead 79-68 — Auburn
had barely cut into Stanford's lead
at all.
Six seconds later, Azzi fouled
Jones on a breakaway. It was her
fifth. The senior, who is second
on the school's all-time scoring
list, would watch the last minute

from the bench after upping her
school disqualification record to
23.
Ciampi told his troops to begin
fouling immediately. Five times,
the recipient of the foul was Hen
ning. She made 7 of 10 free throws
down the stretch, including all
five front ends of the one-and
ones. The Tigers became desper
ate and started to hoist threes
left and right.
Evelyn Thompson hit a pair of
treys, the second of which cut the
lead to 82-75 with 1:05 left to
play. Two possessions later, the
Tigers' Linda Godby shot an air
ball from the left corner. Lynn
Stevenson followed it with an air
ball from the opposite corner. Fi
nally, Jones made it an airball
trifecta as she threw a three-point
attempt off the side of the back
board.
For an Auburn team that has
lost in the championship game
three straight years, the sequence
illustrated in microcosm the
frustrations they felt.
Stanford's last possession ended
with Henning on the free-throw
line. It seemed appropriate, con
sidering she led the team in scor
ing, was second in rebounding and
committed just two turnovers de
spite battling the press through
out the game.
Yet Azzi and Steding made the
all-tournament team, and Hen
ning was overlooked. "I didn't
come here to make the all
tournament team," Henning told
reporters. "I came here to win a
national championship. That's
what we did."
One of the Cardinal's theme
songs in 1989-90 is "Can't Touch
Us." As they stand together, able
to command the respect of the
entire women's basketball world,
those words seem truer than ever.
Card notes
Joining Azzi and Steding on the
all-tournament team were Auburn's
Jones and Chantel Tremitiere and
Louisiana Tech's Venus Lacy.
Azzi also won the Wade Trophy Fri
day — the most prestigious award in
women's basketball — to go along with
the Naismith Award she received
before the regiohals.

Junior point guard Sonja Henning took advantage of an Auburn game plan that left her open, scoring 21

veer said after the championship
game. "It was a total team effort.
The coach praised her troops
for working together to bring the
ball up against the Tigers'
vaunted pressure defense and pro
viding a varied offensive attack
that was too much for Auburn to
handle.

"They have so many weapons
. . . so many weapons," Tiger
Coach Joe Ciampi said. "Defen
sively it created so many problems
for us."
Knowing they would have to
give up something, Auburn's plan
was to silence the Cardinal's big
guns and hope for the best. "We
had anticipated taking out
Stevens, Azzi and Steding,"
Ciampi said. That left Henning
free to make things happen. So
she did.
"Sonja Henning really did a job
for them with 21 points and nine
rebounds," Ciampi added. "We
were going to slough off her, and
we found out our game plan was
in trouble."
Not just as far as Henning was
concerned. Ciampi knew his team
would have to get out quickly on
the Cardinal's three-point
shooters as well.
In the early going, the Tigers
were failing on all fronts. Azzi,
Stevens and Steding combined for
20 points, including 15 on treys,
by the time eight minutes had
ticked off the clock. Stanford's
bombs-away strategy gave the
team a 22-11 lead.
"We really look for that shot a
lot," VanDerveer said of the three,
"and I encourage them to take it."
She went on to explain that the
Auburn defense played a role in
dictacting her strategy. "We ha
ven't been pressed much this
season and basically for a reason.
"We might turn it over a couple
of times, but it opens up our
three-point shooting," she ex
plained.
In the game, Stanford set Final
Four records for three-pointers
made (11) and attempted (26).
Steding attempted 15 treys alone
and sunk six of them, smashing
the previous highs for a women's
final. No one had attempted or
made more than two.
Azzi chipped in four treys on
eight attempts, and Henning hit
one as well. It was just the 10th
of the season for the Stanford
point guard.
But the Cardinal did not hit a

three in the final 12 minutes of
the first half as the team con
verted on just four of its last 13
field goal attempts overall.
Meanwhile, the Tigers clawed
their way back. Carolyn Jones,
who finished with a game-high
24 points, sunk two free throws
to key a 30-10 run that put
Auburn ahead 41-32. Jones scored
six more points from the line dur
ing the spurt, as the Tigers
seemed to be taking control.
"We kind of got a little bit com
fortable in our lead," Steding said.
"We stopped working as hard on
defense and keeping them off the
boards."
VanDerveer then made a sub
stitution that might have saved
the game. With 2:07 remaining,
she sat Martha Richards down
and sent in Val Whiting. The swap
meant the Cardinal had a
frontline of Stevens, Whiting and
Julie Zeilstra — all 6-foot-3.
Immediately, it began to pay
dividends. Whiting banked in a
7-foot jumper to trim the deficit
to seven. After Henning completed
an old-fashioned three-point play,
Whiting scored again to pull Stan
ford within 41-39.
Azzi made both ends of a one
and-one to knot things at 41-41
heading into the intermission.
Auburn had clearly lost the eye
of the Tiger as well.
It is an age old basketball cliche
that games are won and lost in
the first five minutes of the sec
ond half. Like many cliches, how
ever, this one is most often true.
With Henning bringing the ball
up against the press, Stanford
outscored Auburn 16-7 to open
the second stanza. The Cardinal's
inside game, which had been er
ratic against Virginia Friday, fi
nally got on track as Stevens
scored six points during the run
and Stanford opened up a 57-48
bulge.
For six minutes the team went
back and forth until an Azzi three
pointer made it 70-57 with 7:54
to play. Auburn answered with
five straight points on a Jones
three and a turnaround jumper
by C.C. Hayden.
Stanford called timeout, and
VanDerveer once again told her
bomber squadron to go on a
sortie. Henning and Steding
nailed treys on consecutive offen
sive trips to keep the Tigers at
bay.
Just 94 seconds remained in the
game, and the scoreboard showed
Stanford ahead 79-68 — Auburn
had barely cut into Stanford's lead
at all.
Six seconds later, Azzi fouled
Jones on a breakaway. It was her
fifth. The senior, who is second
on the school's all-time scoring
list, would watch the last minute

from the bench after upping her
school disqualification record to
23.
Ciampi told his troops to begin
fouling immediately. Five times,
the recipient of the foul was Hen
ning. She made 7 of 10 free throws
down the stretch, including all
five front ends of the one-and
ones. The Tigers became desper
ate and started to hoist threes
left and right.
Evelyn Thompson hit a pair of
treys, the second of which cut the
lead to 82-75 with 1:05 left to
play. Two possessions later, the
Tigers' Linda Godby shot an air
ball from the left corner. Lynn
Stevenson followed it with an air
ball from the opposite corner. Fi
nally, Jones made it an airball
trifecta as she threw a three-point
attempt off the side of the back
board.
For an Auburn team that has
lost in the championship game
three straight years, the sequence
illustrated in microcosm the
frustrations they felt.
Stanford's last possession ended
with Henning on the free-throw
line. It seemed appropriate, con
sidering she led the team in scor
ing, was second in rebounding and
committed just two turnovers de
spite battling the press through
out the game.
Yet Azzi and Steding made the
all-tournament team, and Hen
ning was overlooked. "I didn't
come here to make the all
tournament team," Henning told
reporters. "I came here to win a
national championship. That's
what we did."
One of the Cardinal's theme
songs in 1989-90 is "Can't Touch
Us." As they stand together, able
to command the respect of the
entire women's basketball world,
those words seem truer than ever.
Card notes
Joining Azzi and Steding on the
all-tournament team were Auburn's
Jones and Chantel Tremitiere and
Louisiana Tech's Venus Lacy.
Azzi also won the Wade Trophy Fri
day — the most prestigious award in
women's basketball — to go along with
the Naismith Award she received
before the regiohals.

Mike Topolovac — Daily
Junior point guard Sonja Henning took advantage of an Auburn game plan that left her open, scoring 21
points yesterday to lead the Cardinal to its first-ever NCAA crown.
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Two and a half
hours after winning their 32nd game of
the season, the Stanford women's basket
ball team was on a bus bound for Oak
Ridge, a town of 29,000 in East Tennessee.
They were already in good spirits when
Aretha Franklin's "Respect" began to play
on the stereo.
Suddenly, the Cardinal 11 jumped up
and burst into song. At maximum volume
they sang along with Aretha as she belted
out: "All I want — is just a little respect.
Just a little bit. Just a little bit . . . Sock
it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock
it to me."
Like Rodney Dangerfield, Aretha will
probably be making her request for time
immemorial. After winning their first na
tional championship yesterday, though, the
Stanford women need not ask for it any
longer.
Friday night, the Cardinal advanced to
within one step of the NCAA title by
beating Virginia. The victory was the
team's 100 th in the last four seasons. One
might think that would be an impressive
enough achievement considering Stanford
won just 46 times in the previous quad
rennium.
Three team members — one from Syl
mar, Calif.; one from Lake Oswego, Ore.;
and one from Oak Ridge, Tenn. — saw
things a bit differently. Win No. 101 would
be the fulfillment of a dream that took
root in the autumn of 1986, when Stacy
Parson, Katy Steding and Jennifer Azzi

were freshmen, and women's basketball at
Stanford was little more than a curiosity.
The dream was to be crowned national
champs, and it became a reality in the
trio's final collegiate game before a women's
Final Four record crowd of 20,023 in the
Thompson-Boling Arena.
Azzi and Steding have teamed with
juniors Soi\ja Henning and Trisha Stevens
to start 90 of the past 94 games. As a unit,
the growing success of the Cardinal's "Fab
Four" has been critical to the team's rise
to national prominence. Yesterday, the
foursome was in top form as they combined
to score 72 of Stanford's points in an 88-81
defeat of Auburn in the national title game.
Overwhelmed by emotion, Azzi said: "I
don't know if you can really put it into
words. The thing that's really special to
me is that we all care about each other so
much. I don't think you'll find that on a
lot of teams. We've worked really hard,
and it's nice to know it paid off."
Said Henning: "We stuck together
(throughout the season). We were down to
11 players. We knew what our goal was.
We had it up in the locker room from day
one." She was referring to a piece of paper
that read: "NCAA champions 1990 — Get
comfortable with it."
They also knew that to achieve that goal
they would have to combine their talents
to form a well-oiled machine. Selfish play
and concern for individual statistics were
not a part of that machine this year, and
yesterday was no exception.

dividends. Whiting banked in a
7-foot jumper to trim the deficit
to seven. After Henning completed
an old-fashioned three-point play,
Whiting scored again to pull Stan
ford within 41-39.
Azzi made both ends of a one
and-one to knot things at 41-41
heading into the intermission.
Auburn had clearly lost the eye
of the Tiger as well.
It is an age old basketball cliche
that games are won and lost in
the first five minutes of the sec
ond half. Like many cliches, how
ever, this one is most often true.
With Henning bringing the ball
up against the press, Stanford
outscored Auburn 16-7 to open
the second stanza. The Cardinal's
inside game, which had been er
ratic against Virginia Friday, fi
nally got on track as Stevens
scored six points during the run
and Stanford opened up a 57-48
bulge.
For six minutes the team went
back and forth until an Azzi three
pointer made it 70-57 with 7:54
to play. Auburn answered with
five straight points on a Jones
three and a turnaround jumper
by C.C. Hayden.
Stanford called timeout, and
VanDerveer once again told her
bomber squadron to go on a
sortie. Henning and Steding
nailed treys on consecutive offen
sive trips to keep the Tigers at
bay.
Just 94 seconds remained in the
game, and the scoreboard showed
Stanford ahead 79-68 — Auburn
had barely cut into Stanford's lead
at all.
Six seconds later, Azzi fouled
Jones on a breakaway. It was her
fifth. The senior, who is second
on the school's all-time scoring
list, would watch the last minute

from the bench after upping her
school disqualification record to
23.
Ciampi told his troops to begin
fouling immediately. Five times,
the recipient of the foul was Hen
ning. She made 7 of 10 free throws
down the stretch, including all
five front ends of the one-and
ones. The Tigers became desper
ate and started to hoist threes
left and right.
Evelyn Thompson hit a pair of
treys, the second of which cut the
lead to 82-75 with 1:05 left to
play. Two possessions later, the
Tigers' Linda Godby shot an air
ball from the left corner. Lynn
Stevenson followed it with an air
ball from the opposite corner. Fi
nally, Jones made it an airball
trifecta as she threw a three-point
attempt off the side of the back
board.
For an Auburn team that has
lost in the championship game
three straight years, the sequence
illustrated in microcosm the
frustrations they felt.
Stanford's last possession ended
with Henning on the free-throw
line. It seemed appropriate, con
sidering she led the team in scor
ing, was second in rebounding and
committed just two turnovers de
spite battling the press through
out the game.
Yet Azzi and Steding made the
all-tournament team, and Hen
ning was overlooked. "I didn't
come here to make the all
tournament team," Henning told
reporters. "I came here to win a
national championship. That's
what we did."
One of the Cardinal's theme
songs in 1989-90 is "Can't Touch
Us." As they stand together, able
to command the respect of the
entire women's basketball world,
those words seem truer than ever.
Card notes
Joining Azzi and Steding on the
all-tournament team were Auburn's
Jones and Chantel Tremitiere and
Louisiana Tech's Venus Lacy.
Azzi also won the Wade Trophy Fri
day — the most prestigious award in
women's basketball — to go along with
the Naismith Award she received
before the regiohals.

Mike Topolovac — Daily
Junior point guard Sonja Henning took advantage of an Auburn game plan that left her open, scoring 21
points yesterday to lead the Cardinal to its first-ever NCAA crown.
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Two and a half
hours after winning their 32nd game of
the season, the Stanford women's basket
ball team was on a bus bound for Oak
Ridge, a town of 29,000 in East Tennessee.
They were already in good spirits when
Aretha Franklin's "Respect" began to play
on the stereo.
Suddenly, the Cardinal 11 jumped up
and burst into song. At maximum volume
they sang along with Aretha as she belted
out: "All I want — is just a little respect.
Just a little bit. Just a little bit . . . Sock
it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock
it to me."
Like Rodney Dangerfield, Aretha will
probably be making her request for time
immemorial. After winning their first na
tional championship yesterday, though, the
Stanford women need not ask for it any
longer.
Friday night, the Cardinal advanced to
within one step of the NCAA title by
beating Virginia. The victory was the
team's 100 th in the last four seasons. One
might think that would be an impressive
enough achievement considering Stanford
won just 46 times in the previous quad
rennium.
Three team members — one from Syl
mar, Calif.; one from Lake Oswego, Ore.;
and one from Oak Ridge, Tenn. — saw
things a bit differently. Win No. 101 would
be the fulfillment of a dream that took
root in the autumn of 1986, when Stacy
Parson, Katy Steding and Jennifer Azzi

were freshmen, and women's basketball at
Stanford was little more than a curiosity.
The dream was to be crowned national
champs, and it became a reality in the
trio's final collegiate game before a women's
Final Four record crowd of 20,023 in the
Thompson-Boling Arena.
Azzi and Steding have teamed with
juniors Soi\ja Henning and Trisha Stevens
to start 90 of the past 94 games. As a unit,
the growing success of the Cardinal's "Fab
Four" has been critical to the team's rise
to national prominence. Yesterday, the
foursome was in top form as they combined
to score 72 of Stanford's points in an 88-81
defeat of Auburn in the national title game.
Overwhelmed by emotion, Azzi said: "I
don't know if you can really put it into
words. The thing that's really special to
me is that we all care about each other so
much. I don't think you'll find that on a
lot of teams. We've worked really hard,
and it's nice to know it paid off."
Said Henning: "We stuck together
(throughout the season). We were down to
11 players. We knew what our goal was.
We had it up in the locker room from day
one." She was referring to a piece of paper
that read: "NCAA champions 1990 — Get
comfortable with it."
They also knew that to achieve that goal
they would have to combine their talents
to form a well-oiled machine. Selfish play
and concern for individual statistics were
not a part of that machine this year, and
yesterday was no exception.

season long," Coach Tara VanDer
veer said after the championship
game. "It was a total team effort.
The coach praised her troops
for working together to bring the
ball up against the Tigers'
vaunted pressure defense and pro
viding a varied offensive attack
that was too much for Auburn to
handle.

Women's Basketball

"They have so many weapons
. . . so many weapons," Tiger
Coach Joe Ciampi said. "Defen
sively it created so many problems
for us."
Knowing they would have to
give up something, Auburn's plan
was to silence the Cardinal's big
guns and hope for the best. "We
had anticipated taking out
Stevens, Azzi and Steding,"
Ciampi said. That left Henning
free to make things happen. So
she did.
"Sonja Henning really did a job
for them with 21 points and nine
rebounds," Ciampi added. "We
were going to slough off her, and
we found out our game plan was
in trouble."
Not just as far as Henning was
concerned. Ciampi knew his team
would have to get out quickly on
the Cardinal's three-point
shooters as well.
In the early going, the Tigers
were failing on all fronts. Azzi,
Stevens and Steding combined for
20 points, including 15 on treys,
by the time eight minutes had
ticked off the clock. Stanford's
bombs-away strategy gave the
team a 22-11 lead.
"We really look for that shot a
lot," VanDerveer said of the three,
"and I encourage them to take it."
She went on to explain that the
Auburn defense played a role in
dictacting her strategy. "We ha
ven't been pressed much this
season and basically for a reason.
"We might turn it over a couple
of times, but it opens up our
three-point shooting," she ex
plained.
In the game, Stanford set Final
Four records for three-pointers
made (11) and attempted (26).
Steding attempted 15 treys alone
and sunk six of them, smashing
the previous highs for a women's
final. No one had attempted or
made more than two.
Azzi chipped in four treys on
eight attempts, and Henning hit
one as well. It was just the 10th
of the season for the Stanford
point guard.
But the Cardinal did not hit a

three in the final 12 minutes of
the first half as the team con
verted on just four of its last 13
field goal attempts overall.
Meanwhile, the Tigers clawed
their way back. Carolyn Jones,
who finished with a game-high
24 points, sunk two free throws
to key a 30-10 run that put
Auburn ahead 41-32. Jones scored
six more points from the line dur
ing the spurt, as the Tigers
seemed to be taking control.
"We kind of got a little bit com
fortable in our lead," Steding said.
"We stopped working as hard on
defense and keeping them off the
boards."
VanDerveer then made a sub
stitution that might have saved
the game. With 2:07 remaining,
she sat Martha Richards down
and sent in Val Whiting. The swap
meant the Cardinal had a
frontline of Stevens, Whiting and
Julie Zeilstra — all 6-foot-3.
Immediately, it began to pay
dividends. Whiting banked in a
7-foot jumper to trim the deficit
to seven. After Henning completed
an old-fashioned three-point play,
Whiting scored again to pull Stan
ford within 41-39.
