MANCHESTER, England (AP) -
About 700 inmates rioted at a crowded
19th century prison yesterday, occupy
ing rooftops, smashing windows and
setting fires. At least 50 guards and
inmates were injured, police said.
Television newscasts carried uncon
firmed reports that witnesses had seen
up to 12 bodies. A police spokesman
said inmates brought out of Strange
ways Prison also reported deaths, but
that police would not be able to con
firm this until they reached the center
of the complex.
The Home Office said no hostages
were being held, and police said talks
with prisoners were under way. There
was no clear indication of the cause
of the rioting at the medium-security
prison, which was built in the Vic
torian era.
Home Office spokesman Charles
Keseru said prison officers regained
control of one wing of the jail yesterday
evening and found no seriously injured
inmates. The office said 12 injured
staff members and 25 inmates were
taken to area hospitals.
Prisoners were surrendering to au
thorities and about 400 had given up
late last night, Keseru said. The prison
houses about 1,600 inmates.
Hundreds of riot police surrounded
the prison and a police helicopter hov
ered overhead as flames leaped 20 feet
into the air from the prison gym
nasium, where a fire burned out of
control.
Twenty-five firefighters under
police protection battled the blaze as
dense black smoke billowed above the
building.
Fires also were reported to have
been set in three cells and a classroom
as large groups of inmates rampaged
inside. Those fires later were reported
under control.
An office statement said the uprising
began in the prison chapel at 11 a.m.,
when 300 inmates attacked staff mem
bers.
