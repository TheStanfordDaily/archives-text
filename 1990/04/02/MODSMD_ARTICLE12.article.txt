Soviet Jews supported
NEW YORK (AP) â€” An estimated
120,000 demonstrators gathered out
side the United Nations yesterday to
emigration and to express rage at
reports of growing anti-Senffhsffl in
the Soviet Union.
The ralliers, who packed Dag Ham
mersjold Plaza, also called for direct
flights from Moscow to Tel Aviv.
The rally came six days after
Malev, the Hungarian airline, halted
flights between Budapest and Tel
Aviv because of threats by the radical

group Islamic Jihad to attack air
liners carrying Soviet emigres. The
airline resumed limited flights from
Budapest to Tel Aviv yesterday but
still wasn't running direct charter
flights from Moscow.
Shooting holds up talks
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The
driver of a Southeastern Trailways
bus taking a Greyhound route was
shot and critically wounded, prompt
ing strike-plagued Greyhound yester
day to rule out contract talks until
a week has passed without gunfire.

"It's an open-and-shut case of ter
rorism," said Fred Currey, chairman
and chief executive officer of strike
plagued Greyhound Lines Inc. "We
will not negotiate with people who
are involved in terrorism."
Representatives of striking "Grey
hound denied responsibility,
but Currey said he would refuse to
reopen talks until a week goes by
without a shooting.
The bus belonged to Southeastern
Trailways, an independent company,
but operated on Greyhound routes
with Greyhound passengers under a
pooling arrangement that existed

before the strike.
Fuel spill spreads
PITTSBURGH (AP) - A 30-mile
long fuel slick left a town of about
15,000 people without normal water
yesterday and threatened water sup
plies in Pittsburgh and dozens of
other cities dependent on the Alleg
heny and Ohio rivers, authorities
said.
The slick, which was moving slug
gishly down the Allegheny northwest
of Pittsburgh, resulted from a land
slide that cracked a pipeline Friday.
