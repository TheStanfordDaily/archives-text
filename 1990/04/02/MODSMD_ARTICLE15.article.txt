Stanford's women's
basketball players are
winners on and off court

THE 11 MEMBERS OF Stan
ford's women's basketball
team are winners in every
sense of the word.
The Stanford community should
take pride not only in the team's
national championship, but in the
fact that the Cardinal women are
first-class individuals.
A lot of unseen hard work went
into yesterday's 88-81 victory over
Auburn and the 32-1 season that
the championship game capped off.
While the Cardinal now basks in
the national limelight, it's easy to
forget that in 1983-84, the team
finished at 5-23. Since then, the
team has steadily improved â€” a
result of countless hours on the
hardwood in front of empty bleac
hers.
Coach Tara VanDerveer
deserves hearty praise. In her five
years as head coach, she has
brought women's basketball from
the depths of obscurity at Stanford
to a national championship. She
has turned the program
recruiting important players like
Jennifer Azzi and Katy Steding,
and she has ignited enthusiasm on
campus for women's basketball. In
1986, the Cardinal averaged a mere
300 spectators per game; this year,
an average of 3,000 fans came out
to Maples Pavilion.

In addition to Stanford students,
many of the those who regularly
attended home games were young
girls who look to the women on
the team as role models. True to
championship form, the Cardinal
women would hang around after
their victories, signing autographs
and offering words of encourage
ment for those who hope to follow
in their footsteps.
They will have big shoes to fill.
Seniors Azzi, Steding and Stacy
Parson derserve a lion's share of
the credit for the team's success,
as they were VanDerveer's first
recruiting class. As a result of their
dedication and commitment, the
three women will be leaving Stan
ford with a women's basketball pro
gram infinitely richer than they
found it.
Ironically, on the same day Stan
ford captured its national title, the
nation's college sports fans were
lamenting the University of
Okalahoma's decision to cut its
women's basketball program.
Stanford's display of excellence
yesterday is a testament to the
merit of women's basketball at the
collegiate level. Hopefully, their
performance sent a strong message
to the administration at Oklaho
ma.
others assoclatec! with Stanford's
1989-90 women's basketball team,
a heartfelt thank you. You have
offered the community a model of
athletic excellence and of first-class
sportsmanship. You have written
a chapter in Stanford history of
which we can all be proud.
