WHEN WE WAKE up tomorrow
morning, we must continue to
face our moral responsibility in
helping to resolve the Webb Ranch labor
dispute. The Faculty Senate took a pos
itive step at its March 8 meeting when
it announced its support for the Webb
Ranch workers.
The University's offer of mediation
services, however, may not only be pre
mature, as the United Stanford Workers
representatives have put it, but the offer
itself may be unwise, depending on how
the mediation sessions are to be struc
tured. Some mediation sessions focus too
much on reaching a result, any result,
and some tend to reproduce the bargain
ing inequities that exist outside of media
tion.
When we wake up tomorrow morning,
we confront a horrendous budget deficit
that will mean the end of Staofos4 em
ployment for some people, many of
received letters last month warning them
of the prospect. Financial uneasiness can
weaken ties among components of the
University when departments try to
preserve themselves by pointing the
budget axe at a different target.
(If, however, further budget cuts need
to be made within the Department of
Athletics, I recommend the team whose
junior varsity members wear T-shirts
with the inscription "Technique is for
faggots.")
When we wake up tomorrow morning,
we who were incensed by The Daily's
portrait of the atmosphere for dealing
with acquaintance rape at Stanford must
press Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole

for a process that will produce a more
tolerable atmosphere. Better yet, we who
were incensed by The Daily's portrait of
the atmosphere for acquaintance rape
must realize that every male-female con
text is a sexual context and that not only
are there rape victims among us but also
rapists among us.
When we wake up tomorrow morning,
we must figure out whether a Royal/Adler
Satellite 111 electronic typewriter has a
programmable capability, thus disqualify
ing it from use on the California Bar
Exam, as detailed in Rule 11-2 of the
California Bar Examiners Applicants
Manual. Oh, wait a minute, that's my
problem.
Enough about tomorrow morning.
When we woke up this morning, we
could be grateful that this Farm became
more appealing than the farms that sur
ro\>ncT Moscow, Idaho — not to mention
more appealing than whatever surrounds
Columbus, Ohio.
And when we woke up this morning,
we could be oveijoyed that Vernal, Utah
has given us a more exciting attraction
than Dinasour National Monument.
And when we woke up this morning,
we could be thrilled that someone from
Idaho made a positive contribution to
women's issues after three weeks of
legislative battles that produced the na
tion's most restrictive abortion law.
Because when we woke up this morn
ing, Tara VanDerveer, Julie Zeilstra, An
gela Taylor and the rest of the folks who
do women's basketball for Stanford had
done it better than any similar set of

folks in the country, as many of us saw
on CBS yesterday morning in a game
that ran slightly shorter than CBS' other
production about women and basketball
last week, "The Laker Girls."
That's not bad considering that way
back in 1896, in what Stanford pictorial
historian Norris James identifies as the
first intercollegiate women's basketball
game in the United States, Stanford
topped Cal by a score of 2-1. My guess
is they didn't have a 30-second clock or
a three-point line. Only women were al
lowed into the San Francisco Armory —
as players, coaches or officals — to wit
ness the game.
And when workmen came in to repair
a broken backboard, the Cal team retired
modestly to its locker room, lest the
workmen see them in their bloomers.
The Stanford women, however, remained
brazenly on the court. The ensuing scan
dal shut down the intercollegiate compe
tition component of the women's
basketball program for about ten years.
For the rest of the women's basketball
teams in the country, that was about
84-too-few years of inactivity.
Stanford women's basketball. The tra
dition continues.
