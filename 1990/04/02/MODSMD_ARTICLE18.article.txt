Racism against whites spreading across University

THIS IS YET another letter con
cerning racism.
In four years at Stanford,
years spent, among other things, tutor
ing children in East Palo Alto, working
for social change in South Africa and
painfully reflecting upon and rooting
out my own racial biases, I have
reached these conclusions about the
issue of race at Stanford University:
• A dangerous form of racism is
emerging here. It is a racism used by
emerging non-white powers against
whites,
• The most blatant and inexcusably
racist student organizations on campus

are black fraternities and sororities
and the Black Student Union, if the
color of skin is used as a membership
criterion,
• The Stanford Daily, which is per
haps a mirror of social attitude, is held
in a grip of terror by the multicultural
movement, in that any sericus dissen
sion from the movement's spirit or
letter does not generally appear on its
pages,
• Opinion columns such as the recent
one glorifying black female beauty are
great, unless they inflict bitter and
violent damage to "blond-haired, blue
eyed anorexic women," many of whom
are desperately struggling with eating

disorders and don't need to be told
that society no longer considers them
attractive,
• Serious and debilitating com
promises in competence are being made
at Stanford in the process of using
race as an employment qualification,
• There is a quiet, powerful resent
ment growing among whites here who
feel that they are paying an increas
ingly burdensome toll for the crimes of
their, or someone else's, ancestors. The
fact that this resentment is not ex
pressed in campus literature or open
conversation does not mean it is not
there; on the contrary, its lack of
expression will ensure that it festers

and grows,
• Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of
a society where the color of one's skin
is irrelevant is in danger of being lost
today at Stanford University.
I am counting the hours until I am
labeled as a racist by minds in the
clutches of multicultural group-think.
Those minds which do so make the
racist assumption that I, and other
whites like myself, do not believe
deeply in a vision of a multicultural
Stanford University, in the equal sense
of the word.
