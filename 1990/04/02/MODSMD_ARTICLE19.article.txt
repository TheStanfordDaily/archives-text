# Writer has published most important book in recent history
## 
### 
Maggie Gallagher is a 29-year-old
Yale graduate, a single mother and
attractive, judging from the photo on
the cover of her book, "Enemies of
Eros." One other detail: She has writ
ten probably the most important book
of our time.
Everyone knows that the decline of
the American family threatens to put
us out of the running in international
competitions, mainly in terms of the
weak base it offers for education.
The Japanese finance minister who
appeared on a roundtable discussion of
the world economic future (hosted by
Peter Jennings) was merely the most
recent to remind us, with particular
appropriateness, of this blunt fact.
In a word, Gallagher, who writes as
breezily as Ellen Goodman but with
infinitely more wisdom, tells us what
to do about the looming disaster. For

example, we have to stop putting indi
vidual whim or "choice" above truly
serious matters such as raising children
properly, keeping families with two
parents and so on.
She may not be heeded, of course,
but not because she didn't try. She
runs rings around Simone de Beauvoir
in depth of insight, for example, and is
altogether sparkling, solid and inspir
ing.
The rest is up to you, folks.
