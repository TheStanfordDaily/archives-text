# Family feuding on the Farm
## X-TV takeoff features big bovine, fast-talking farmer 
### Doug Lillydahl Staff writer 
Producer Dave Holland hopes
to milk it for all it's worth.
Complete with an 11-foot
high Holstein backdrop, Stan
ford's latest X-TV game show,
"Farm Feud," began taping last
quarter at Toyon Hall.
The show is the brainchild of
Holland, a junior who said the
idea came to him during a late
night economics study session
last spring. "Farm Feud" is a
spirited takeoff on the long
running game show "Family
Feud," starring Richard Daw
son.
"Farm Feud," which will
begin airing early this quarter,
follows the format of its
predecessor — with a few im
portant exceptions.
The questions all pertain to
college life at Stanford, so
answers such as "fro-yo" and
"I'd go get my RA" score big
points. The second exception is

'The cow as an
icon has been be
coming more
popular... and it
only required
black and white
paint to make.'
— Dave Holland

the ominous presence of the
scoreboard, which displays the
11-foot-tall dairy cow and is
operated by a sharp-tongued
farmer in overalls.
The first episode features
"families" from Roble and
Toyon Halls matching wits over
the results of questionnaires
distributed to dorms the previ
ous week. Contestants answer
ing questions are awarded a

number of points equal to the
number of dorm residents who
responded similarly.
If a contestant guesses an an
swer not found among the sur
veyed answers, the bovine back
drop bellows out its disapproval.
An early afternoon crowd
showed increasing enthusiasm
at the first taping, despite
several technical delays which
pushed taping of the show back
nearly 45 minutes. By the end
of the show, a spirited Roble
contingent was cheering its
panel.
John Manning, the show's
host, said the staff hopes to tape
two shows a week during spring
quarter, "now that we've got the
first one under our belts."
When questioned about the
show's scoreboard, Holland re
flected, "The cow as an icon has
been becoming more popular . . .
and it only required black and
white paint to make."
The first show will air April
9 at 6:30 p.m.
