# True recycling also requires use of recycled products
## 
### 
"The burden of saving the earth falls
squarely on the shoulders of everyone
at this University" — so proclaims The
Daily's editorial entitled "Recycle this
paper." Stanford students, faculty and
The Daily can do more, though, than
merely toss their papers into green

bins rather than regular trash cans —
they can switch to recycled paper for
many of their needs.
Today, as many communities across
the nation begin recycling programs,
they are facing the reality of creating
markets for these recycled products,
especially collected paper. State and
local governments are taking action
and have mandated the use of recycled
paper in some operations.
Since 1976, California has been home
to one of the nation's first successful
programs for procurement of recycled
paper, and Gov. Deukmejian recently
signed a law requiring California news
papers to use 25 percent recycled paper
by 1992 and 50 percent recycled paper
by 2000.
Thus, in several years, The Daily
will have to be printed on partially
recycled paper. However, many newspa
pers in the Bay area (The Peninsula
Times Tribune, San Francisco
Chronicle and San Jose Mercury News)
already use recycled newsprint in some
of their papers — shouldn't The Daily
follow their lead?
Here at Stanford, students can pur

chase recycled paper products at the
Bookstore; faculty, staff and student
organizations can purchase recycled
paper from Central Stores. In both
places demand has been on the up
swing for these environmentally
preferred products.
The Daily might do more to save the
environment by initiating the use of
recycled newsprint than by exhorting
students to recycle. As Stanford's Recy
cling Center proclaims, you're not
really recycling unless you're using
recycled products.
The Daily's editorial misses out on
this crucial second part of the equa
tion.
