# Forgotten Henning leads women to title

### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - Ninety
minutes before Friday's national
semifinal game against Virginia,
Stanford's Jennifer Azzi walked
onto the court and started shoot
ing at the East basket. As Asst.
Coach Amy Tucker rebounded,
Azzi — who was the first Cardinal
player out of the locker room —
was the center of attention, as she
had been all week.
Two ushers, each about 70
years old, sat 10 seats apart from
each other in the fourth row,
watching the senior guard warm
up. After a few minutes — and
a lot of swishes — one called to
the other.
"Hey."
"Yeah?"
"What's her name?"

"Azzi."
Pause. "She's pretty good."
Nod. "Yup."
A few minutes later Azzi was
joined by Katy Steding, and then
several other players took the
court. Finally, almost 15 minutes
after Azzi appeared, Sonja Hen
ning walked on the court, picked
up a ball and started to shoot
around.
The ushers — along with most
everyone else — didn't pay any
attention to Henning. They were
still admiring Azzi, who hadn't
missed very many shots.
"Hey."
"Yeah?"
"She shoots three-pointers bet
ter'n our guys does!"
Another nod. "Yup."
Yup indeed. But while Azzi was
busy dazzling the media, fans and
ushers OVfir the course of the
weekend — winning Most Out

standing Player honors in the
process — it was Henning, her
backcourt mate, who was quietly
piloting the Cardinal to its first
national title.
Whether she was patiently
directing the offense, quickly dis
mantling a press, dealing out
assists or grabbing another re
bound, it was Henning — who
played all but 71 seconds of the
two games — who ran the show.
"She's just about the best-kept
secret there is," Stanford Coach
Tar a VanDerveer said after Hen
ning scored 12 points and handed
out five assists in Friday's 75-66
win over the Cavaliers. "I didn't
think she played as sharp as she
usually does (Henning had seven
turnovers), but we had a lot of
trouble with our offense tonight,
and she stayed with it and kept
working."
Henning apparently remained a
secret for the rest of the weekend
because, despite scoring a team
high 21 points (including seven
free throws in the last 90
seconds), grabbing nine rebounds
and committing only two turn
overs against Auburn in the
championship game, she was left
off the all-tournament team.
Not that she cared. "I didn't
come here to make the all
tournament team," Henning said.
"I came to win a national cham
pionship, and that's exactly what
we did. From day one we've been
playing as a team, and I'm just

as happy that Jennifer and Katy
(Steding) made the team as I
would be if I had."
"[Awards] aren't that big of a
deal to Sonja or me," Azzi said.
"We know what's important.. . .
Going home with our rings is
MVP enough for all of us."
Auburn Coach Joe Ciampi,
though, knew who had made the
difference in the game. "In big
games, someone's got to step for
ward, and Sonja Henning did the
job for them today," he said. "We
were going to slough off her and
see what she could do, and we
found out that our game plan was
in trouble."
To say the least. It wasn't Hen
ning's scoring (she was 6 for 11
from the field and 8 of 11 from
the line), though, that killed the
Tigers. By only committing two

turnovers (one on a lousy out-of
bounds call by the official) against
Auburn's press, she effectively
took the claws out of the Tigers'
defense.
"Auburn has a great press —
that's half of their offense, the
pressure defense," Henning said.
"That's something we haven't
faced much."
"We were looking to attack the
middle, and the person who was
attacking and thinking was
Sonja," VanDerveer said. The
strategy worked: Stanford com
mitted 13 turnovers, but only two
were in the second half.
"We get the job done no matter
who scores or makes the big
plays," Azzi said, "and Sonja got
it done today."
Maybe next time a few more
people will notice.
