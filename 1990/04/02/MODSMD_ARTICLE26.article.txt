# Forgotten Henning leads women to title

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - Ninety
minutes before Friday's national
semifinal game against Virginia,
Stanford's Jennifer Azzi walked
onto the court and started shoot
ing at the East basket. As Asst.
Coach Amy Tucker rebounded,
Azzi — who was the first Cardinal
player out of the locker room —
was the center of attention, as she
had been all week.
Two ushers, each about 70
years old, sat 10 seats apart from
each other in the fourth row,
watching the senior guard warm

backcourt mate, who was quietly
piloting the Cardinal to its first
national title.
Whether she was patiently
directing the offense, quickly dis
mantling a press, dealing out
assists or grabbing another re
bound, it was Henning — who
played all but 71 seconds of the
two games — who ran the show.
"She's just about the best-kept
secret there is," Stanford Coach
Tar a VanDerveer said after Hen
ning scored 12 points and handed
out five assists in Friday's 75-66
win over the Cavaliers. "I didn't
think she played as sharp as she
usually does (Henning had seven
turnovers), but we had a lot of
trouble with our offense tonight,
and she stayed with it and kept
