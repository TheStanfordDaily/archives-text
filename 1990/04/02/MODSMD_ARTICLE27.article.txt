# Azzi amazes in publicized 'homecoming'
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - "So
what's it like to play the Final
Four in your hometown?"
"Is this the fulfillment of a
childhood dream?"
"Do you consider this a
storybook ending to your career?"
"VWiy didn't you play for Ten
nessee?"
Jennifer Azzi only answered
3,462 inane questions over the
past six days. And she answered
virtually every one with a smile.
When the Lady Vols of Tennes
see were eliminated from the
NCAA tournament the pre
planned Final Four storyline
needed to be rewritten. It was no
longer good enough to write,
"Root, root, root for the home
team."
The media, always hungry for
an angle, latched on to the best
one available: "Hometown girl
goes West, becomes a star, then

comes home to win it all."
Azzi, of course, is that star.
Born and raised in Oak Ridge —
just 20 miles away from Knoxville
— the Stanford senior became not
just a story but The Story. The
press dusted off the Universal
Media Blitz Playbook and ran it
to perfection.
Azzi was on every local televi
sion story, in every newspaper
and at every possible press con
ference. Her days were filled shut
tling back and forth between
interview sessions. She was often
separated from the rest of the
team.
Finally, Azzi was asked about
all the questions she was being
asked. "I think a lot of people
have been overlooked because it's
been such a big deal with me com
ing home," she said. "A lot of
people like to write about that."
As a result she once again be
came the focal point of the media's
attention. It is a role Azzi has
been forced to play countless

times over the past two years as
she became the symbol of her
team's success.
She said the past week was
"hard" for her because she knows
how good her teammates are and
feels they should share in the
credit.
But unlike Azzi, they were not
named to the All-America team,
they did not win the Naismith
Award, they were not awarded the
Wade Trophy and they were not
Pacific 10 Conference Player of
the Year. Again.
While she was unquestionably
deserving of all the honors, the
same could be said of many Stan
ford players. Still, only Azzi is
from Oak Ridge.
Therefore, only Azzi could be
called "ours" by the locals. Only
Azzi could be the heroine in this
Final Four fairy tale.
"I guess it's kind of like a
storybook," she said. "But that's
kind of selfish since I feel so good
about our team."
