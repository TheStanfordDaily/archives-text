# Women swimmers lose NCAAs in last-race heartbreaker
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas — To the casual obser
ver, the 1990 NCAA Women's Swimming
and Diving Championships seemed to have
a little of everything.
For top-ranked Stanford, however, the
meet had just a little too much Leigh Ann
Fetter.
With the closest meet in NCAA history
hanging in the balance on the last race,
the 400-yard freestyle relay, Fetter pulled
away for Texas on the final leg to give
them the race and the meet. The final
point-totals were 632 for Texas and 622 Vi
for the Cardinal.
Florida finished a distant third and Cal
ifornia fourth in the meet held March 15-17
at the Texas Swim Center.
"That was an exciting meet," Stanford
Coach Richard Quick said. "I think every
one got their money's worth. ... I thought
we had a chance. The Texas team did a
great job."
Going into the meet, Quick knew he
wanted to take a lead into the final race.
The Lady Longhorns have the best sprint
freestyler in the country in Fetter and
several others among the nation's elite.
Quick, actually, was the one to blame, as
he recruited most of those swimmers to
Texas before coming to Stanford before
last season. The Cardinal, on the other
hand, lost its two top sprinters from last
year to graduation.
But despite the odds, the Cardinal squad
hung tough. Stanford led at the 100-, 200-

and 300-yard marks, and at the start of
the fourth leg, Stanford, Texas and Florida
were all dead even.
But Fetter, who earlier in the day had
won the 100 freestyle, pulled away from
the field and Florida's Lorraine Perkins
also passed Karen Kraemer, who is much
more of a distance swimmer than a
sprinter.
Quick's plan going into the race was to
have his best swimmer, Janel Jorgensen,
lead off and hope to build a lead. If the
team did that, he hoped either Fetter would
get psyched out or would burn herself up
trying to catch up too quickly. But the
Texas swimmers stayed with the Cardinal
early, and that was the meet
"If Janel could have gotten a bigger lead
on Julie (Cooper, who swam the first leg
for the Lady Longhorns)," Quick lamented,
"but Julie Cooper did a great job. That
was our only chance — to get in the lead
and take it away from Leigh Ann. That's
a tough task.
"I'm an emotional guy and I wanted to
win that meet and that relay, so I'm dis
appointed right now. But I'm not disap
pointed in any of those swimmers because
they swam the splits of their lives.
"If 1 had to lose this meet, I would want
to lose it to the University of Texas."
After the first day of the three-day meet,
it looked like Stanford would have the meet
wrapped up before the final relay. Although
it trailed the Lady Longhorns by 26 points
after day one, that left the Cardinal 13

points closer than the team was
last year. Last season Stanford
won handily.
After Stanford took second in
the 200 freestyle relay to open
the meet, freshman Janet Evans
got the Cardinal going. Evans
broke Tracy Caulkins' 11-year-old
American record in the 500 free
style by nearly two seconds. The
race was close for a while before
Evans pulled away from Florida
freshman Whitney Hedgepeth.
It was a rough night for
Caulkins, who was there as a tele
vision commentator. Just a few
minutes later, another Stanford
freshman, Jorgensen, broke
Caulkins* pool record and the
school record in winning the 200
individual medley.
"I'm least confident in that
event and newer swimming it,"
Jorgensen said. "Having such a
great time drop in it gives me
confidence for the rest of the
meet. It's always nice to start on
the right foot going into a three
day meet."
Stanford closed day one by win
ning the 400 medley relay, hand
ing Florida their first loss in 39
medley races.
Evans broke Caulkins' meet
and pool records in the 400 IM
to open the second day, after
which Jorgensen easily won the
100 butterfly. With Jorgensen
winning that race and Suzy Buck
ovich and Jamie Rugless also
reaching the final, Stanford took
the overall lead from Texas.
Stanford padded that lead two
races later when freshman Lori
Heisick took second and senior
Jill Johnson placed fifth in the
100 breaststroke. Sophomores
J.T. Toton and Susan Johnson
also scored, and the Cardinal lead
was up to 39V2 points.
Texas had closed to within 12V2

points going into the last race of
the second day, the 800 freestyle
relay, but this race soon became
episode 111 of the Janet Evans
Show.
After the first 600 yards of the
800 freestyle relay, Evans entered
the water 2.10 seconds behind
Lady Gator Nancy Marley. Evans
had made up almost no ground
on Marley at the 750-yard mark,
but an incredible finish enabled
her to catch Marley and win the
race for Stanford.
"I thought if anybody could do
it, Janet Evans could," Quick said.
"She is just a phenomenal com
petitor. She swam her lifetime
best times at 50 and at 100 yards.
She just made a phenomenal ef
fort down the stretch."
Unfortunately for Stanford, the
boost wasn't big enough, and the
meet soon got even closer. The
Cardinal didn't swim that well in
the qualifying heats on the third
morning, and it became clear that
Texas had the upper hand.
Realizing they were in trouble,
the Stanford swimmers responded
with some outstanding efforts.
Evans shattered her own Ameri
can record in the 1650 freestyle,
breaking the record by nearly six
seconds and winning by 25
seconds. The Cardinal's lead was
up to 45Vfe points.
The Longhorns gained in the
next two events, but Jill Johnson
and Heisick went one-two in the
200 breaststroke and the Cardinal
parents were chanting "sweep" in
the stands. The win in her final
collegiate race was especially
sweet for Johnson, who was upset
by Michigan's Ann Colloton in the
200 last year.
Jorgensen then won the 200
butterfly, but Texas' depth
brought the Lady Longhorns
within half a point going into the
platform diving. There Stanford
senior diver Katie Connors im
proved from eighth to fourth.

It was a rough night for
Caulkins, who was there as a tele
vision commentator. Just a few
minutes later, another Stanford
freshman, Jorgensen, broke
Caulkins* pool record and the
school record in winning the 200
individual medley.
"I'm least confident in that
event and newer swimming it,"
Jorgensen said. "Having such a
great time drop in it gives me
confidence for the rest of the
meet. It's always nice to start on
the right foot going into a three
day meet."
Stanford closed day one by win
ning the 400 medley relay, hand
ing Florida their first loss in 39
medley races.
Evans broke Caulkins' meet
and pool records in the 400 IM
to open the second day, after
which Jorgensen easily won the
100 butterfly. With Jorgensen
winning that race and Suzy Buck
ovich and Jamie Rugless also
reaching the final, Stanford took
the overall lead from Texas.
Stanford padded that lead two
races later when freshman Lori
Heisick took second and senior
Jill Johnson placed fifth in the
100 breaststroke. Sophomores
J.T. Toton and Susan Johnson
also scored, and the Cardinal lead
was up to 39V2 points.
Texas had closed to within 12V2

points going into the last race of
the second day, the 800 freestyle
relay, but this race soon became
episode 111 of the Janet Evans
Show.
After the first 600 yards of the
800 freestyle relay, Evans entered
the water 2.10 seconds behind
Lady Gator Nancy Marley. Evans
had made up almost no ground
on Marley at the 750-yard mark,
but an incredible finish enabled
her to catch Marley and win the
race for Stanford.
"I thought if anybody could do
it, Janet Evans could," Quick said.
"She is just a phenomenal com
petitor. She swam her lifetime
best times at 50 and at 100 yards.
She just made a phenomenal ef
fort down the stretch."
Unfortunately for Stanford, the
boost wasn't big enough, and the
meet soon got even closer. The
Cardinal didn't swim that well in
the qualifying heats on the third
morning, and it became clear that
Texas had the upper hand.
Realizing they were in trouble,
the Stanford swimmers responded
with some outstanding efforts.
Evans shattered her own Ameri
can record in the 1650 freestyle,
breaking the record by nearly six
seconds and winning by 25
seconds. The Cardinal's lead was
up to 45Vfe points.
The Longhorns gained in the
next two events, but Jill Johnson
and Heisick went one-two in the
200 breaststroke and the Cardinal
parents were chanting "sweep" in
the stands. The win in her final
collegiate race was especially
sweet for Johnson, who was upset
by Michigan's Ann Colloton in the
200 last year.
Jorgensen then won the 200
butterfly, but Texas' depth
brought the Lady Longhorns
within half a point going into the
platform diving. There Stanford
senior diver Katie Connors im
proved from eighth to fourth.
AUSTIN, Texas — To the casual obser
ver, the 1990 NCAA Women's Swimming
and Diving Championships seemed to have
a little of everything.
For top-ranked Stanford, however, the
meet had just a little too much Leigh Ann
Fetter.
With the closest meet in NCAA history
hanging in the balance on the last race,
the 400-yard freestyle relay, Fetter pulled
away for Texas on the final leg to give
them the race and the meet. The final
point-totals were 632 for Texas and 622 Vi
for the Cardinal.
Florida finished a distant third and Cal
ifornia fourth in the meet held March 15-17
at the Texas Swim Center.
"That was an exciting meet," Stanford
Coach Richard Quick said. "I think every
one got their money's worth. ... I thought
we had a chance. The Texas team did a
great job."
Going into the meet, Quick knew he
wanted to take a lead into the final race.
The Lady Longhorns have the best sprint
freestyler in the country in Fetter and
several others among the nation's elite.
Quick, actually, was the one to blame, as
he recruited most of those swimmers to
Texas before coming to Stanford before
last season. The Cardinal, on the other
hand, lost its two top sprinters from last
year to graduation.
But despite the odds, the Cardinal squad
hung tough. Stanford led at the 100-, 200-

and 300-yard marks, and at the start of
the fourth leg, Stanford, Texas and Florida
were all dead even.
But Fetter, who earlier in the day had
won the 100 freestyle, pulled away from
the field and Florida's Lorraine Perkins
also passed Karen Kraemer, who is much
more of a distance swimmer than a
sprinter.
Quick's plan going into the race was to
have his best swimmer, Janel Jorgensen,
lead off and hope to build a lead. If the
team did that, he hoped either Fetter would
get psyched out or would burn herself up
trying to catch up too quickly. But the
Texas swimmers stayed with the Cardinal
early, and that was the meet
"If Janel could have gotten a bigger lead
on Julie (Cooper, who swam the first leg
for the Lady Longhorns)," Quick lamented,
"but Julie Cooper did a great job. That
was our only chance — to get in the lead
and take it away from Leigh Ann. That's
a tough task.
"I'm an emotional guy and I wanted to
win that meet and that relay, so I'm dis
appointed right now. But I'm not disap
pointed in any of those swimmers because
they swam the splits of their lives.
"If 1 had to lose this meet, I would want
to lose it to the University of Texas."
After the first day of the three-day meet,
it looked like Stanford would have the meet
wrapped up before the final relay. Although
it trailed the Lady Longhorns by 26 points
after day one, that left the Cardinal 13
