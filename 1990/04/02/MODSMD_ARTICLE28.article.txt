# Women swimmers lose NCAAs in last-race heartbreaker

AUSTIN, Texas — To the casual obser
ver, the 1990 NCAA Women's Swimming
and Diving Championships seemed to have
a little of everything.
For top-ranked Stanford, however, the
meet had just a little too much Leigh Ann
Fetter.
With the closest meet in NCAA history
hanging in the balance on the last race,
the 400-yard freestyle relay, Fetter pulled
away for Texas on the final leg to give
them the race and the meet. The final
point-totals were 632 for Texas and 622 Vi
for the Cardinal.
Florida finished a distant third and Cal
ifornia fourth in the meet held March 15-17
at the Texas Swim Center.
"That was an exciting meet," Stanford
Coach Richard Quick said. "I think every
one got their money's worth. ... I thought
we had a chance. The Texas team did a
great job."
Going into the meet, Quick knew he
wanted to take a lead into the final race.
The Lady Longhorns have the best sprint
freestyler in the country in Fetter and
several others among the nation's elite.
Quick, actually, was the one to blame, as
he recruited most of those swimmers to
Texas before coming to Stanford before
last season. The Cardinal, on the other
hand, lost its two top sprinters from last
year to graduation.
But despite the odds, the Cardinal squad
hung tough. Stanford led at the 100-, 200-

and 300-yard marks, and at the start of
the fourth leg, Stanford, Texas and Florida
were all dead even.
But Fetter, who earlier in the day had
won the 100 freestyle, pulled away from
the field and Florida's Lorraine Perkins
also passed Karen Kraemer, who is much
more of a distance swimmer than a
sprinter.
Quick's plan going into the race was to
have his best swimmer, Janel Jorgensen,
lead off and hope to build a lead. If the
team did that, he hoped either Fetter would
get psyched out or would burn herself up
trying to catch up too quickly. But the
Texas swimmers stayed with the Cardinal
early, and that was the meet
"If Janel could have gotten a bigger lead
on Julie (Cooper, who swam the first leg
for the Lady Longhorns)," Quick lamented,
"but Julie Cooper did a great job. That
was our only chance — to get in the lead
and take it away from Leigh Ann. That's
a tough task.
"I'm an emotional guy and I wanted to
win that meet and that relay, so I'm dis
appointed right now. But I'm not disap
pointed in any of those swimmers because
they swam the splits of their lives.
"If 1 had to lose this meet, I would want
to lose it to the University of Texas."
After the first day of the three-day meet,
it looked like Stanford would have the meet
wrapped up before the final relay. Although
it trailed the Lady Longhorns by 26 points
after day one, that left the Cardinal 13
