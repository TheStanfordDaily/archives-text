# Men bow out early in NIT

HONOLULU — Christian Laet
tner may have sent Connecticut
home with his buzzer-beating,
double-pumping 18-footer. Alonzo
Mourning may yet turn out to be
the next Patrick Ewing. Don
Mac Lean may bring UCLA an
other championship banner some
day.
But in Adam Keefe, Stanford
may have a sophomore big man
that is the equal of any of them.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal
found out March 15 that Keefe's
supporting cast needs to crank it
up several notches if Stanford is
to end its postseason losing streak
at three.

| Rainbows 69
Cardinal 57

Despite getting 31 points on 10-
of-13 shooting from the 6-foot-9
redhead, Stanford was over
matched by Hawaii in its first
round game of the National Invi
tation Tournament. The end
result was a 69-57 defeat before
5,981 at the Neal Blaisdell Arena.
The Cardinal concluded the
1989-90 campaign with an 18-12
record, while Hawaii finished at
25-10 after losing in the NIT quar
terfinals. Stanford won three
straight postseason games in 1942
when the team captured the
NCAA championship. In 1988, the
Cardinal won an NIT game
against Long Beach State before
losing to Arkansas State. Last
season, Siena shocked Stanford in
the NCAA tournament.
While the Rainbows proved in
capable of matching up with
Keefe, the rest of the Cardinal
had few solutions for stopping the
Rainbows. While Hawaii was no
taller than Stanford, the Rain
bows were as strong and a lot
quicker.
"They were just so athletic
across the board," Keefe said. "I
don't think our effort was what
it should have been. Especially
after staying out of the sun."
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery cited the team's 20 turn
overs — a season-long problem —
as a key factor. "We made a lot
of errors. We panicked a little bit."
Whatever the reason, Hawaii
held starting guards John Patrick
and Kepny Ammann to 3-of-12
shooting. Forward Deshon Win
gate scored six points but grabbed
no rebounds.
"They kicked our butt," Patrick
said. "We have to come out next
year and not let stuff like that
happen. We have to be more than
a one-threat team."
Even though that sole threat is
quite formidable.
Keefe dominated the low block
and scored 12 points in the
opening eight minutes of the game
as Stanford moved ahead 14-9.
When the final horn sounded,
though, it was clear Hawaii had
dominated. Of Stanford's 21 field
goals, Keefe scored 10. The Car

dinal made 14 free throws, 11 by
Keefe.
As the Rainbows began to shake
off the effects of a 21-day road
trip, they began to claw their way
back into the game. Terry Hous
ton, who finished with 15 points,
kept his team close early, and Vin
cent Smalls scored seven points
in the final 3:14 of the first half
to send Hawaii into the locker
room with a 29-26 lead.
In the second stanza, senior
guard Chris Gaines took over the
Rainbows. Limited to just five
points in the opening 20 minutes,
he exploded for 20 more to bury
the Cardinal.
"He was really tired after the
trip," Hawaii Coach Riley Wallace
said. "He hit a couple clutch shots
in the second half and took over."
Gaines hit two long jumpers
early in the second period as
Hawaii used a series of four-to
six-point runs to keep the Cardi
nal at bay. But Stanford had one
comeback left. Trailing 51-46,
Keefe scored on one of his five
dunks, sunk three free throws and
watched Andrew Vlahov make a
10-footer to bring Stanford within
54-51.
Vincent Smalls, whose 11 point,
13 rebound performance "killed
us" according to Keefe, fed Gaines
for a layup. He was fouled, com
pleted the three-point play and

helped Hawaii pull away for good.
When the final television
timeout rolled around with 4:33
remaining, the Rainbows led 65-
53, and the Cardinal had no weap
ons left in its arsenal to mount a
last-second charge.
"One side is very disappointed,"
Montgomery said afterwards.
"Yet the other side says we played
postseason basketball and won 18
games. You hate to end like that."
Card notes
Montgomery may have coached his
last game at Stanford. He is a finalist
for the vacancy at Virginia. Xavier's
Pete Gillen and Texas' Tom Penders
removed themselves from considera
tion. It is believed that Montgomery
or Penn State's Bruce Parkhill will
be tabbed to lead the Cavaliers.
Eric Reveno, who started at center
for Stanford last year, was on hand
to watch his former teammates.
Reveno was returning from Japan and
moved up his flight from Friday to
Wednesday to see the team in action.
He worked for Nippon Mining and
played professionally in the Land of
the Rising Sun.
The Cardinal finished at No. 51 in
the USA Today's computer rankings
compiled by MIT grad Jeff Sagarin.
In the NIT championship, Vander
bilt defeated Saint Louis. It was the
second straight year the Billikens
finished as NIT runners-up.
