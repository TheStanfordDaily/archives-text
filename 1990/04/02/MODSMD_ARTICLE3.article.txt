Budget teams worked franti
cally last week and into the week
end to whittle away at their
budgets after Provost James
Rosse asked units within the Uni
versity to target 5 to 30 percent
for cuts.
The provost announced last
Monday where individual units
fell within a three-tiered prelim
inary target for the $22 million
of cuts in the total annual oper
ating budget of about $388 mil
lion. Much of that budget is
reserved for academic purposes
and is untouchable, leaving about
$175 million vulnerable to cuts.
Rosse said the administrative
budgets of the schools of Business,
Education, Engineering, Law,
Medicine and Humanities and Sci
ences, and various academic
centers and institutes as well, will
be cut from 5 to 9 percent. The
cuts are intended to spare the ac
ademic core of the University,
leaving the number of faculty po
sitions virtually unchanged.
Other areas of the University
will suffer far deeper cuts â€” up
to 30 percent by the preliminary
estimates offered by the provost.
Among those that will take at
least an 18 percent cut: Student
Affairs and Residential Education,
the Legal Office, the administra
tion of the Financial Aids Office,
Human Resources, the Office of

Planning and Management and
the administrative areas of the
University Libraries.
The announcement of the cut
proposals has fueled concerns that
staff will be laid off, and many
University workers have asked
their supervisors what the budget
cuts will mean for their jobs.
"There will be staff cuts," Rosse

said. "There's no doubt about it."
Stanford has more than 6,400
non-teaching employees, not in
cluding those who work at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
