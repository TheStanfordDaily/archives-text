# Rosse details budget cuts
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Budget teams worked franti
cally last week and into the week
end to whittle away at their
budgets after Provost James
Rosse asked units within the Uni
versity to target 5 to 30 percent
for cuts.
The provost announced last
Monday where individual units
fell within a three-tiered prelim
inary target for the $22 million
of cuts in the total annual oper
ating budget of about $388 mil
lion. Much of that budget is
reserved for academic purposes
and is untouchable, leaving about
$175 million vulnerable to cuts.
Rosse said the administrative
budgets of the schools of Business,
Education, Engineering, Law,
Medicine and Humanities and Sci
ences, and various academic
centers and institutes as well, will
be cut from 5 to 9 percent. The
cuts are intended to spare the ac
ademic core of the University,
leaving the number of faculty po
sitions virtually unchanged.
Other areas of the University
will suffer far deeper cuts — up
to 30 percent by the preliminary
estimates offered by the provost.
Among those that will take at
least an 18 percent cut: Student
Affairs and Residential Education,
the Legal Office, the administra
tion of the Financial Aids Office,
Human Resources, the Office of

Planning and Management and
the administrative areas of the
University Libraries.
The announcement of the cut
proposals has fueled concerns that
staff will be laid off, and many
University workers have asked
their supervisors what the budget
cuts will mean for their jobs.
"There will be staff cuts," Rosse

said. "There's no doubt about it."
Stanford has more than 6,400
non-teaching employees, not in
cluding those who work at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
Normal attrition, which hovers
at about 15 percent per year but
varies widely from department to
department, may account for a
large number of the anticipated
staff cuts. But layoffs, voluntary
early retirements and job trans
fers are expected in some depart
ments, Rosse said.
"We haven't formed all of our
policies on transfers, layoffs,
retirements and so forth," Rosse
said. "They won't be needed until
summertime at least. I don't be
lieve there will be any necessary
layoffs before the first of Septem
ber."
Rosse said the staff cuts will
occur at all levels, including the
senior officer level.
Most adminstrators inter
viewed said they have yet to make
decisions about what might be cut
if the preliminary reduction levels
are finalized.
The preliminary targets were
set by the Reposition Steering
Committee, a group of nine ad
ministrators, faculty members
and others charged with leading
the effort to make the necessary
budget cuts by September 1991.
Administrators have until April
4 to come back to the steering
committee with responses.
Human Resources was slapped
with a 30 percent cut. The office
handles everything from compen

sation and benefits for employees
to training and development. The
budget of the central office is
about $4 million, but director
Mary Moore estimated that at
least another $1 million is spent
on employees spread throughout
the University.
Moore said she hopes individual
departments and offices around
campus can become more actively
involved in the day-to-day issues
now handled by her department.
Human Resources currently has
about 10 vacant positions, and
those vacancies will make it easier
to cut the 30 percent. Still, Moore
said, "We're going to lose some
people, and that's going to be
really tough."
University Libraries director
David Weber said his administra
tive budget will be slashed 20
percent. "I've never faced any
thing of the sort. This is just
awesome," he said. "It's earth
shaking at best."
Memorial Church has been
asked to take a 10 percent cut.
Administrative assistant Diane
Hill said the church receptionist
has already been informed she
would lose her job, and other cost
cutting measures will be inevita
ble.
Hill said the cuts will be espe
cially painful because one of the
church's main sources of revenue,
the wedding program, has been
canceled due to earthquake
damage.

Although officials have not yet
received their assigned budget cut
targets from the dean of Human
ities and Sciences, Overseas
Studies may be a particularly
hard-hit victim of the budget ax.
"It's our assumption at Overseas
Studies that we will be affected
by the budget cuts," said Corbin
Smith, deputy director of the pro
gram.
Smith said nearly any cuts will
mean that one or more overseas
programs will have to be dropped.
Overseas Studies sponsors 10 pro
grams in places from Paris and
Oxford to Kyoto, Japan and San
tiago, Chile.
Smith said the strategy will

likely be to close more centers
than might seem necessary to
achieve the budget reductions so
that Stanford can strengthen its
other programs. "We don't want
Overseas Studies to be weak," he
said.
David Mendelow, associate vice
president for the Medical School,
said the school has been preparing
for cuts since last summer, when
Dean David Korn ordered the
school to plan to make substantial
cuts. The total reduction in the
school's budget will be $750,000,
Mendelow said.
He emphasized that academic
programs will not be cut.

Smith said nearly any cuts will
mean that one or more overseas
programs will have to be dropped.
Overseas Studies sponsors 10 pro
grams in places from Paris and
Oxford to Kyoto, Japan and San
tiago, Chile.
Smith said the strategy will

likely be to close more centers
than might seem necessary to
achieve the budget reductions so
that Stanford can strengthen its
other programs. "We don't want
Overseas Studies to be weak," he
said.
David Mendelow, associate vice
president for the Medical School,
said the school has been preparing
for cuts since last summer, when
Dean David Korn ordered the
school to plan to make substantial
cuts. The total reduction in the
school's budget will be $750,000,
Mendelow said.
He emphasized that academic
programs will not be cut.
Budget teams worked franti
cally last week and into the week
end to whittle away at their
budgets after Provost James
Rosse asked units within the Uni
versity to target 5 to 30 percent
for cuts.
The provost announced last
Monday where individual units
fell within a three-tiered prelim
inary target for the $22 million
of cuts in the total annual oper
ating budget of about $388 mil
lion. Much of that budget is
reserved for academic purposes
and is untouchable, leaving about
$175 million vulnerable to cuts.
Rosse said the administrative
budgets of the schools of Business,
Education, Engineering, Law,
Medicine and Humanities and Sci
ences, and various academic
centers and institutes as well, will
be cut from 5 to 9 percent. The
cuts are intended to spare the ac
ademic core of the University,
leaving the number of faculty po
sitions virtually unchanged.
Other areas of the University
will suffer far deeper cuts — up
to 30 percent by the preliminary
estimates offered by the provost.
Among those that will take at
least an 18 percent cut: Student
Affairs and Residential Education,
the Legal Office, the administra
tion of the Financial Aids Office,
Human Resources, the Office of

Planning and Management and
the administrative areas of the
University Libraries.
The announcement of the cut
proposals has fueled concerns that
staff will be laid off, and many
University workers have asked
their supervisors what the budget
cuts will mean for their jobs.
"There will be staff cuts," Rosse

said. "There's no doubt about it."
Stanford has more than 6,400
non-teaching employees, not in
cluding those who work at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
Normal attrition, which hovers
at about 15 percent per year but
varies widely from department to
department, may account for a
large number of the anticipated
staff cuts. But layoffs, voluntary
early retirements and job trans
fers are expected in some depart
ments, Rosse said.
"We haven't formed all of our
policies on transfers, layoffs,
retirements and so forth," Rosse
said. "They won't be needed until
summertime at least. I don't be
lieve there will be any necessary
layoffs before the first of Septem
ber."
Rosse said the staff cuts will
occur at all levels, including the
senior officer level.
Most adminstrators inter
viewed said they have yet to make
decisions about what might be cut
if the preliminary reduction levels
are finalized.
The preliminary targets were
set by the Reposition Steering
Committee, a group of nine ad
ministrators, faculty members
and others charged with leading
the effort to make the necessary
budget cuts by September 1991.
Administrators have until April
4 to come back to the steering
committee with responses.
Human Resources was slapped
with a 30 percent cut. The office
handles everything from compen

sation and benefits for employees
to training and development. The
budget of the central office is
about $4 million, but director
Mary Moore estimated that at
least another $1 million is spent
on employees spread throughout
the University.
Moore said she hopes individual
departments and offices around
campus can become more actively
involved in the day-to-day issues
now handled by her department.
Human Resources currently has
about 10 vacant positions, and
those vacancies will make it easier
to cut the 30 percent. Still, Moore
said, "We're going to lose some
people, and that's going to be
really tough."
University Libraries director
David Weber said his administra
tive budget will be slashed 20
percent. "I've never faced any
thing of the sort. This is just
awesome," he said. "It's earth
shaking at best."
Memorial Church has been
asked to take a 10 percent cut.
Administrative assistant Diane
Hill said the church receptionist
has already been informed she
would lose her job, and other cost
cutting measures will be inevita
ble.
Hill said the cuts will be espe
cially painful because one of the
church's main sources of revenue,
the wedding program, has been
canceled due to earthquake
damage.

Although officials have not yet
received their assigned budget cut
targets from the dean of Human
ities and Sciences, Overseas
Studies may be a particularly
hard-hit victim of the budget ax.
"It's our assumption at Overseas
Studies that we will be affected
by the budget cuts," said Corbin
Smith, deputy director of the pro
gram.
Smith said nearly any cuts will
mean that one or more overseas
programs will have to be dropped.
Overseas Studies sponsors 10 pro
grams in places from Paris and
Oxford to Kyoto, Japan and San
tiago, Chile.
