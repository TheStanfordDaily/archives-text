# Cardinal third at nationals

INDIANAPOLIS - After ex
pecting to be entrenched in a
fierce dogfight for the 1990
NCAA Championship trophy
on March 22-24 at the Indiana
University Natatorium, Stan
ford's men's swimming team
had to be a little surprised
when the Cardinal looked up
before the final event of the
meet and saw three other
squads — Texas, Southern Cal
ifornia and Michigan — ahead
of it.
Instead of going into the 400
freestyle relay with the chance
to bring home Stanford's first
NCAA Championship of the
year, the Cardinal team needed
to beat the Wolverines in the
final event just to perpetuate
its seven-year reign as one of
the top three squads in the na
tion.
Michigan's Brent Lang, the
NCAA champion in the 50 and
100 freestyle, did his best to
bump the Cardinal from its
spot in the triumvirate by
swimming a 42.77. His efforts
gave the Wolverines the early
lead, ahead of sixth-place Stan
ford freshman Erik Maurer by
1.42 seconds.

However, the next three Wol
verine swimmers finished far
slower than Lang's pace and
Cardinal seniors Doug Lil
lydahl, John Witchel and Byron
Burson each swam the final
legs of their college careers in
under 44 seconds — enabling
Stanford to make up the early
deficit and surge into third
place, four spots in front of
Michigan.
This concluding performance
by Maurer and the three sen
iors inched Stanford into third
place, just ahead of Michigan
in the final standings. With 506
points, Texas handily won its
third consecutive NCAA Cham
pionship while USC, Stanford
and Michigan finished with
423, 354 and 351.5 points,
respectively.
"We got into the top three,
so we really have nothing to
be disappointed about," soph
omore Alex Kostich said. "We
wanted to win, but this just
means we'll have to come in
and work harder next year."
Kostich put an impressive
cap onto his second collegiate
season by finishing second to
lowa's Artur Wojdat in the
1650 freestyle. Kostich lowered
his personal best time to
14:49.69, over 10 seconds

faster than his best time last
year, and qualified for the
American Goodwill Games
squad.
"My season goal was to get
under 14:50 — that's all I
wanted to do," Kostich said. "1
knew he (Wojdat) would be
there at the end... (and) a
couple of times I tried to make
a run at him but didn't think
I could sustain my surge, so I
kept holding back. Next year,
I'll start a little sooner and get
him."
Sophomore Jeff Rouse gar
nered the Cardinal's only
championship of the meet in
the 100 backstroke. Rouse
broke Asst. Coach Jay Morten
sen's 1987 school record by
leading the entire way and pos
ting a 47.50, just ahead of
Texas' Jeff Thibault and Flor
ida's Martin Zubero. Despite
finishing second to Zubero in
the 200 backstroke, Rouse
broke his own school record in
the event with a time of
1:44.61.
"I do remember coming off
the turn (in the 200 back
stroke) with 50 yards left and
thinking how much I was hur
ting," Rouse said. "I did my
best time and am happy with that.
Martin had a hell of a swim —
there*B not much I can do about
that."
Despite recording 12 personal
best times for swimmers in the
consolations and finals, Stanford
could not stay close to Texas and
USC. After the first day, Stanford
was in fifth place,--already 74
points behind the Longhorns.
"If only the meet was four or
five days long and we had two
extra days to catch up, then I
think we could," Kostich said.
"Unfortunately, the ending came
kind of early."
Before the meet, Texas Coach
Eddie Reese had noted that the
key to the winning NCAAs would

be getting swimmers into the
eighth instead of ninth spot and
the 16th instead of the 17th or
18th spots. With the scoring for
the finals being graduated on a
scale from 20 to 10 (20,17,
16,15. . . ) and for the consola
tions from eight to one, the squad
that placed the most swimmers
in the evening's events would have
the best opportunity to accrue
points.
Stanford took the largest team,
18 swimmers, to NCAAs, but ill
fated finishes in the mornings
doomed them. In the 100 butter
fly, senior Doug Lillydahl finished
ninth and missed the final by .01
seconds; in the 100 breaststroke,
junior Matt Rodgers finished 17th
and missed the consolations by
.02 seconds. Overall, Stanford
placed four swimmers in ninth
place and three in 17th and 18th.
