## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Stanford's men's gymnastics
team has been waiting for its first
Pacific-10 Conference title for a
long time.
The wait is finally over, as
Coach Sadao Hamada's squad il
lustrated Saturday. The Cardinal
men won the Pac-10 team cham
pionship at Arizona State, captur
ing first in five of the eight
categories of competition.
Stanford senior Charles Loop
captured the individual title,
while freshman Jair Lynch
finished fourth.
The team competition started
Friday in Tempe, and ended with
the Cardinal on top with 280.20
points. Host Arizona State
finished second with 279.65
points and UCLA landed third
with 275.65. Lynch led the indi
vidual all-around competition at
57.55, followed closely by Loop.
"We really put everything into
winning the team competition,"
Lynch said. "That's what was

most important to us."
Stanford entered the competi
tion on a late-season roll. The
team racked up a Pac-10 high of
282.45 points against California
and San Jose State a week ago.
This explosive meet, in which
senior Conrad Voorsanger, Lynch
and Loop swept the all-around
honors, seemed to put the team
in the right frame of mind for
the Pac-10 meet.
Following the pattern of the
regular season, however, the Car
dinal was unable to enter the
competition unscathed by iryury.
Voorsanger, who scored a Pac-10
high 57.95 in Stanford's last dual
meet, injured his ankle just days
before the Pac-10 Championships.
As a result, he was not able to
compete on floor or vault.
Sophomore Tim Ryan, the

defending national champion, is
still sidelined with a broken wrist.
Despite the injuries, Stanford
was able to pull through. "We just
wanted to do it for Sadao," Loop
said. "And the fact that we were
able to win without some of our
top guys says a lot for his coach
ing."
Hamada, who is in his 18th year
at Stanford, received the Pac-10
Coach of the Year award.
On Saturday Loop came away
with a 112.65 to snare the indi
vidual title and Pac-10 Gymnast
of the Year honors. Super-frosh
Lynch tallied 108.15 to place
fourth.
Lynch took the titles on both
the floor exercises and high bar
and placed third on pommel horse.
Loop emerged with a win on
the parallel bars, second place on
the high bar and rings and fourth
place on floor exercises.
VoorSanger tied for second on
the rings and placed fourth on
the parallel bars. Tim Wang
rounded out the medal count with
a silver on the bars.
