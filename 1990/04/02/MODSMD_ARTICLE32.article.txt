# Spikers lose two, slip down to fourth

Adversity is beginning to knock
vigorously at Stanford's door.
A dismal spring break excursion
to Southern California for the
Cardinal men's volleyball team be
came nearly catastrophic when
standout starting setter Parker
| Blackman twisted his ankle at 14-
J 11 of the first game against
! Loyola Marymount and watched
the remainder of the squad's
matches on crutches from the
bench.
What he saw wasn't especially
j pleasing. The No. 3 Cardinal (9-5,
i 9-4 in WIVA) fell unexpectedly to
eighth-ranked Loyola last Wed
nesday night in four games,
j surged back to defeat seventh
; ranked San Diego State the next
night, then yielded in five games
to fourth-ranked Long Beach
, State Saturday.
The two road losses to confer
, ence opponents proved costly.
Stanford fell to fourth place in
the Harry Wilson Division of the
i WIVA conference, one half game
J behind No. 5 Hawaii (13-6, 10-4).
1 Because only three teams from
; the division qualify for the WIVA
conference playoffs in three
weeks, Stanford must win its
three remaining conference
matches to make the tournament,
assuming Hawaii continues to
win. Such a task will prove chal
lenging as No. 2 USC comes to
Burnham a week from Friday.
Fans who left Maples Pavilion
March 2 after watching the Car
dinal dismantle UC-Santa Bar
bara might be asking what has
happened since. At that point,
Stanford was ranked No. 1 in the
nation and was undefeated in the
conference. Since then, the team
has lost four away matches,
prompting team members to pose
the same question.
"We haven't been clicking to
gether as a team," injured setter
and team co-captain Parker
Blackman said. "Against Loyola,
we lost heart. We hit rock bottom
for the season."
The statistics seem to say as
much. The Cardinal had one of
its poorest hitting performances
of the year against the Lions, as
only swing-hitter John Alstrom
was able to hit over .300 for the
match. The team committed 36
attack errors and combined for a
.172 hitting percentage.
"We didn't react well," Black
man said. "It was the team's re
sponsibility to adjust and we
didn't do that."
Stanford's failure to adjust
resulted in a 14-16, 12-15, 15-5,
4-15 loss. The contest may have
produced even more ominous con

sequences as setter Blackman sus
tained a second-degree ankle
sprain after attempting to bump
set an errant ball in the first
game. The ir\jury forced Black
man to the bench and ushered
backup Ryan O'Hara into action.
Blackman's status is day-to-day,
but he anticipates he will return
in time for this weekend's tour
nament at UCLA.
"Parker's unavailability af
fected us," Coach Fred Sturm
said. "But injuries are part of the
game, they do happen."
The team's performance
sparked an involved team meeting
afterwards in which their con
cerns were voiced. "It was a per
spective check," Sturm said. "We
had to remind ourselves that we
didn't want to play passively, we
want to dictate the action."
The conference seemed to be
effective as a rejuvenated squad
took the floor the next night to
repel resurgent San Diego State,
15-12, 15-12, 12-15, 17-16. The
match produced several promising
signs for the Cardinal. In addition
to making Coach Sturm "feel
much better about the way (the
squad) played," the team
showcased freshman outside hit
ter Jimmy Klein, who pounded a
team-high 20 kills for a .342 hit
ting percentage while contributing
11 digs and 2 blocks.
Basketball superstar Adam
Keefe also joined the team only
three days after concluding his
basketball duties.
Against Long Beach two nights
later, the Cardinal played the best
it had since its spiral began, ac
cording to Blackman. The effort
enabled Stanford to seize a 2-1
game lead but the 49ers' stellar
hitting resulted in 87 kills and
enabled Long Beach to seize the
final two games, 11-15, 15-9, 4-15,
15-12, 15-9.
Ail-American middle blocker
Dan Hanan had what Sturm con
sidered his best match in the
losing effort.
Adversity has often proved to
be a team's greatest asset. Sturm
hopes that the Cardinal will play
with added motivation the
remainder of the season. "I view
this as an opportunity," Sturm
said. "Winning these must-win
matches will help prepare us for
the playoffs and will give us an
opportunity to be playoff ready
before other teams."
Before the road trip, the Car
dinal defeated club team Califor
nia 15-5, 15-11, 6-15, 11-15, 15-9.
Swing-hitter Robert Hillman and
senior Craig Forsyth, who leads
the nation in hitting percentage,
spearheaded Stanford in the un
official match. Sophomore trans
fer Hillman had 10 kills.
