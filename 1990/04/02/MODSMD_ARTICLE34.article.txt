After nearly three weeks with
out a match, it's only reasonable
that the Stanford women's tennis
team'6honld be a bit flat.
The Stanford women's tennis
team isn't always reasonable,
however.
The University of San Diego
and San Diego State found out
how unreasonable the Cardinal
can get as each suffered lopsided
defeats. After beating the Toreros
7-2 Thursday and the Aztecs 8-1
Friday in San Diego, Stanford is

18-0.
The Cardinal now has a school
record 54-match winning streak
going into matches at UCLA and
USC this weekend. The Bruins
were the last team to beat Stan
ford, doing it two years ago at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
While the Cardinal's two lop
sided victories were expected, one
big surprise came out of San
Diego. In Thursday's match Stan
ford junior Sandra Birch lost her
first match of the season, falling
to Aby Brayton 6-4, 6-3. Birch,
the defending NCAA singles
champion, was 9-0.
