# No break for men's tennis
## Netters open Pac-10 season with pair of wins 
### Steven Apfelberg 
While the majority of Stanford
students relaxed and unwound
from the tension of finals, the
men's tennis team spent spring
break battling three tough oppo
nents. Although they faced some
of their toughest tests of the
season, the Cardinal emerged un
scathed, beating Fresno State, Ar
izona State and Arizona.
With the victories, No. 1-ranked
Stanford remains undefeated at
13-0 and 2-0 in conference play.
On Wednesday, the Fresno
State netters came to the Stanford
Tennis Stadium. The Cardinal
responded by rolling right
through them by a score of 9-0.
Although only freshman Jona
than Stark at No. 1 singles had
to play a third set, many of the
players were forced into tiebreak
ers. However, everyone pulled
through on the crucial points, and
the Cardinal was able to post the
shutout victory.
"Fresno State is not a bad
team," Asst. Coach John Whit
linger said. "For not having played
a match in a long time, we played
well. We concentrated well for a
match at that point in time."
After the Fresno State match,

the team did get some relaxation.
The players took a much-needed
respite and headed for the Stan
ford Golf Course, where they com
peted in their annual golf
tournament.
The fun did not last for long,
though, as the team headed down
to Tempe, Ariz, to face a strong
Arizona State team. Last Friday's
match against ASU marked the
opening of Stanford's Pacific 10
Southern Division season. The
Cardinal expected a battle from
ASU, which is especially danger
ous at home, and received every
bit of the challenge they had an
ticipated.
Stark won 6-1, 6-1 at No. 1
singles, but the rest of the singles
matches were stretched into a
third set. With the exception of
sophomore Alex O'Brien, all the
Stanford players followed the
same pattern of taking the first
set but dropping the second.
O'Brien, who crushed Brian
Gyetko (ranked No. 24 in the na
tion) in the second set to force a
third, lost to end his 13-match
winning streak, 7-6, 1-6, 6-3.
Jared Palmer, Glenn Solomon
and Alexis Hombrecher all won
their third sets to take their
matches, but senior Jeff Cathrall

lost at No. 4 singles, 0-6, 7-6, 6-2.
This left the score at 4-2 in favor
of Stanford going into the doubles.
The Cardinal, which has not been
forced to the doubles much this
season, was able to overcome this
unfamiliar obstacle and post a
convincing win.
The No. 1 doubles team of Stark
and classmate Jared Palmer
clinched the win with a 6-2, 7-5
decision. Cathrall and freshman
Alexis Hombrecher came through
at No. 3 doubles, 6-3, 1-6, 6-0,
while O'Brien and Dan Turbow
fell at No. 2 doubles, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3
to make the final match score 6-3
for Stanford.
With a big win under its belt,
the team travelled to Tucson to
play the University of Arizona on
Saturday. After the singles were
completed, the Cardinal led 5-1,
and the teams decided to forego
the doubles play. Stanford's only
loss was the rare defeat of junior
Glenn Solomon, 6-4, 6-0.
"The conditions in Arizona are
always tough," Solomon said.
"The altitude causes the balls to
fly. It is always windy and noisy
Coach (Gould) told us not to
worry if we didn't play our best,
that we should just play well
