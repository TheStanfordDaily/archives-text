Spring break in Hawaii was
no vacation for the Cardinal
women golfers. And they have
a lot of work ahead of them in
the new quarter, which includes
the crucial part of their
schedule.

Cardinal fourth at the
Hawaii Intercollegiate

Stanford returned from the
Hawaii Intercollegiate having
finished fourth in a field of nine,
but they did not accomplish
their goals for the tournament.
"We wanted to win it," said

Stephanie Davis, who had the
roughest time of it with a 244
overall score. "There were four
good teams there, so finishing
fourth was really like finishing
last for us."
Arizona won the event with
a sizzling 903 combined score,
41 shots ahead of the Cardinal
and 16 ahead of the second-place
UCLA Bruins. Arizona State
was the third-place team.
Stanford's sharpest shooter
was Audrey Wooding, who gar
nered a score of 233. However,
she was 13 strokes behind the
leader, Debbie Parks of Arizona.
The somewhat lackluster per
formance of the Cardinal was
exactly what they wished to
avoid. Only the top 14 teams in
the country get automatic bids
to the NCAAs, and Stanford had

previously been ranked No. 9.
Their Hawaii scores will cer
tainly not secure them the spot
which they had hoped to clinch
at that tournament.
"This puts us on the fence
for nationals," said Davis.
However, the Cardinal still
has some time to show the
NCAA the stuff it's made of.
Beginning this Friday is a tour
nament in Phoenix, the last of
the regular season. "A lot of the
top teams in the country will
be there," said Davis, wh\ch
would make it an excellent op
portunity for Stanford to im
prove its postseason prospects.
The absolute last chance for
the Cardinal, however, will be
the Pacific-10 Conference tour
nament. But they don't want to
wait till then.
