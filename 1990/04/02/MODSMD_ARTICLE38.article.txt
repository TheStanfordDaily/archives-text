# Track team sees improvement
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
Even though the Stanford-Holiday Inn Track and
Field Festival was not a scored meet, Stanford Coach
Brooks Johnson felt that, in a way, "we won it."
At the end of the two-day track and field extrav
aganza Friday and Saturday featuring over 2,000
athletes from 75 high schools and 25 colleges,
Johnson said he could find "nothing but pluses"
for the Cardinal. Given the fact that his teams had
not competed in three weeks, Johnson was ecstatic
about their performance. In particular, he praised
the throwers, distance runners and women's sprint
corps. In Friday's action Brian Boggess and John
Fowler went 1-2 in the discus. Both recorded season
bests, including a Pacific-10 Conference qualifying
171-3 distance for Boggess. Cardinal Debbie Malueg
placed first in the same event for the women with
a mark of 141-2.
In the hammer, Stanford's Vince Bohner captured
second among the collegians with a season-best
177-1.
On Saturday Boggess was the No. 1 collegian in
the shot put at and Fowler placed second
in the discus. Malueg placed first in both of those
events.
The distance events saw great improvements in
Stanford's times. In the 3000-meter steeplechase,
Fred Carter beat his previous season-best by nearly
ten seconds to easily qualify for Pac-lOs. Dave
Scudamore improved his 5000-meter mark by a
similar time.
Several Cardinal runners gave respectable

performances on their first tries in certain events.
These include Bennie Cravat in the 10,000-meters
and Mark Mastalir in the 5,000-meters. Especially
impressive was Eric Mastalir, who took first in the
5,000-meters with a time of 14:04.67.
"The Mastalirs were awesome," commented
Johnson.
Stanford placed first in both the four-mile and
the distance medley relay. For the women, Carol
Gray easily won the 3,000-meters, beating out Olym
pic marathoner Nancy Ditz. Gray and Jill Schenkel
greatly improved their previous season bests in that
event, with Gray well under the Pac-10 qualifying
mark.
She could not hold off Ditz in the 5000-meters,
however, finishing third overall and first collegiately.
Ditz was blown away by the unattached Stanford
graduate Patti Sue Plumer, whose performance was
appropriately called a "warmup" by the meet's an
nouncer, as she missed her American record by
nearly a minute, but still beat Ditz by over 31
seconds.
Plumer also won the 1500-meters, with Melanie
Bloch finishing third overall and second among
collegians in that event. Ashley Black was also im
pressive in that event, garnering a personal season
best.
"Our distance runners are doing well," Johnson
said, "which is good because we're going to need
them."
The women'B sprint squad dominated the compe
tition. On Friday, Chryste Gaines captured first in
the 100-meter dash, and on Saturday she col
laborated with her teammates in winning both the
mile relay and the 400-meter relay.
