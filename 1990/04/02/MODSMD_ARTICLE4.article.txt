# Student Affairs to trim $2 million
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial stall 
Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons was left shaken
when he got his latest
homework assignment: to slash
the budget of his Student Af
fairs empire by $2 million.
That preliminary reduction
target represents 20 percent of
Student Affairs' $10 million
budget, and Lyons figured that
it can only mean a massive
overhaul in the way his office
operates. The reduction marks
a serious blow to the office,
and Lyons said the cuts will
certainly mean a reduction in
the quality of a Stanford stu
dent's education.
The announcement also
taints Lyons' June retirement
from the position he has held
for 18 years.

Now Lyons is taking the cuts
in stride, recognizing that he
too must bear the brunt of the
budget cuts that are affecting
most areas of the University.
"I'm still very concerned, but
the deficit isn't going to
evaporate," he said.
Before he leaves, Lyons and
others — including students —
will take a critical look at Stu
dent Affairs, finding programs
that can be trimmed or con
solidated with others to save
money. "That can happen be
cause I'm leaving now," he
noted. "There's no fiefdom
being guarded."
Lyons has no answers yet to
his budget problems, but he
has plenty of questions that
need to be asked. For example:
• Can Residential Education
consolidate field offices so that
each residence hall does not need
to have a separate office?
• Should Cowell Student Health
Center get rid of its nighttime
infirmary? Can students go to
Stanford Hospital instead? This
option could save $130,000.
• Would a pharmacy at Cowell
offer both convenience for stu
dents and revenue for the health
center?
• Are residential computer
clusters really necessary? Elimi
nating them and centralizing the
computers could save $280,000.
• Are physical fitness classes for
graduate students really neces
sary?
• Do dormitories without fresh
men require resident fellows?
Eliminating them could save
about $130,000.
• Is it necessary for the Uni
versity to fund the ASSU at a
cost of $200,000 per year?
Whatever the final decisions
are, they are sure to be changes
that cut to the heart of the Stu
dent Affairs operation.
Because much of the budget of
Student Affairs pays for staffing,
not material goods, the reductions
will inevitably mean the loss of
many jobs. Student Affairs
employs about 220 regular staff
members, 650 paid students and

38 faculty resident fellows. But
Lyons is hoping that many of
those staff reductions can happen
over the next 16 months by at
trition, not layoffs. Lyons has al
ready called for a hiring freeze.
Lyons said he would continue
to promote programs that encour
age students to determine their
own education. "A lot of what we
do is to train students what they
should be doing for themselves,"
he said. "That's why we're blessed
with a student body that is able
to roll up its sleeves."
Lyons insists that the cuts can
not be made without strong stu
dent participation.
Lyons wrote in a memo to all
Student Affairs employees that he
would keep the following goals in
mind when determining budget
cuts:
• To protect programs that are
closer to the heart of the primary
missions of Stanford.
• To re-engage the faculty with
the education of undergraduates
and to have them participate fully
in the creation and maintenance
of an educational community.
• To keep programs that have
the most benefit to the greatest
number of students.
• To obey the maxim that in
convenience is more tolerable than
hardship.
• To maintain the objective of
achieving an interactive, pluralis
tic community.
