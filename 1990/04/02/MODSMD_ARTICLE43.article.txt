# He fought the law and the law lost
## 'Olympic' athlete outdistances police 
### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
If the Stanford Police were reg
istered students, several would
have received a "no clue" grade
during Finals Week.
Campus police cornered and
chased a pickpocket described as
an "Olympic-class" athlete out of
Meyer Library on March 19, but
when the smoke cleared, the cops
were left in the dust.
In a hair-raising pursuit that
involved at least eight officers, the
suspect raced through the library
stacks, hurdled the turnstile and
led police around central campus
before eluding them in the School
of Education.
Workers at Meyer had noticed
a 5-foot-8-inch slender black man
in his mid-twenties acting suspi
ciously up to two months before
the incident, and a number of wal
lets had been stolen in that time.
Portal monitors had seen the
man sneaking into the library on
weekends, jumping the chain bar
ricade or entering with a group
of students. He would then circle
the stacks quickly while staring
at people intensely.
At one point, the man began
flashing a student ID card, and
the monitors became more suspi
cious. Eventually, library staff
noticed that his appearance coin
cided with the disappearance of
wallets, purses and backpacks.
They could make no solid connec
tion, however, until a student ac
tually witnessed the pickpocket
removing a wallet from his back
pack.
Shankar Saikia, a coterminal
student in economics, came back
to his table after a study break
and saw the suspect about to leave
with his wallet.
"He told me that someone else
stole his wallet, and that he was
just showing me what could hap
pen. He pretended to educate me,"
said Saikia.
According to Saikia, the suspect
returned the wallet and the
money he had removed, shook
Saikia's hand and said knowingly,
"Remember, Stanford is not a safe
place."
Saikia apparently agreed and re

ported the incident to the Meyer
staff, who in turn called the police.
An officer found the man in a
far corner of the third floor
leafing through a medical diction
ary written in Spanish.
According to eyewitness David
Aufhauser, an undeclared fresh
man, the officer asked the suspect
to accompany him downstairs.
"The man stood up, moved
around and started arguing. He
backed off, and then the officer
grabbed his wrist," said Auf
hauser.
The suspect then broke free and
bolted past the officer, said Auf
hauser. He ran past a second of
ficer on the stairs, jumped over
the turnstile in the lobby and
raced toward the Bookstore.
"They should send him to the
Olympics. He was very fast, run
ning down the stairs and jumping
over the gate," said George
Chang, a portal monitor who wit
nessed the chase.
Several more officers rushed to
the scene, sighted the man near
White Plaza and pursued him on
foot.
Eyewitnesses describing the
man as "extremely fleet of foot"
saw a group of policemen shouting
and chasing him from the Book
store back toward Meyer. At that
point, the thief fled into the back
entrance of the Cubberley Build
ing.
Anna Itoi, a junior in English,
was studying in the basement of
Cubberley when the pickpocket
flew by. According to Itoi, he
"looked very scared," and seconds
later, the police ran in and asked
her to leave. Itoi did not hear the
exit door in the basement open or
close.
A crowd gathered outside the
building as police blocked all the
exits. Several pairs of officers then
entered the building and con
ducted an hour-long search, but
they found no trace of the suspect.
The police, however, did not have
keys and were not able to check
locked rooms.
At least three wallets were
stolen over the weekend before
Finals Week, a library supervisor
said. She estimated that normally
one wallet is stolen each week.
