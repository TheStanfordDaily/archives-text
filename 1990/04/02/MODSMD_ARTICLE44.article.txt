Moore to leave rat race
Mary Moore, director of Human Re
sources, has announced she will step down
from her post April 9 for personal and pro
fessional reasons.
Sally Clevinger, manager of employee re
lations, will become acting director.
Moore will be leaving at a crucial time
for Human Resources, just after Provost
James Rosse announced that 30 percent of
the department's budget will likely be cut.
Moore said she will stay on until the end
of the University's "repositioning efforts"
to help Clevinger handle the workload.
"I feel like I'm stepping off a cliff," Moore
said.
Moore said both personal and professional
factors influenced her decision to leave after
a little more than two years in the position.
She said that she and her husband are con
sidering lifestyle changes, and she
cited concerns about the "extraordinary"
workload of the director's post during the
University's budget cutting effort.

Thornburgh urges students
to consider public serv ice
U.S. Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh urged Stanford law students
last month to consider careers in which they
would make less money and work harder
than most private attorneys.
"Public service today offers a grand op
portunity, especially to young lawyers,"
Thornburgh said at the annual banquet of
the Stanford Law Review March 22.
Working within the vast network of public
service law that Thornburgh oversees offers
three primary rewards, he told the prospec
tive lawyers: compensation, integrity and

leadership.
"When I speak of compensation, I am fully
aware that nobody ever gets rich in public
service, or at least not legally," he quipped.
"Salaries lag a full 25 percent behind the
private sector." The resd measure of com
pensation, in Thornburgh's view, is "the
deep satisfaction gained from contributing
to the commonwealth, to one's fellow man.
Boeing pledges $1.6 million
for engineering professorship
The Boeing Company has made a pledge
of $1.6 million to establish the Edward C.
Wells professorship for aeronautical engi
neering in the School of Engineering.
Wells received a bachelor of arts degree
in mechanical engineering from Stanford in
1931, graduating "with greatest distinction."
He made lasting contributions to aerospace
technology during his long career with
Boeing.
Wells was credited as the father of the
B-17 "Flying Fortress," and he oversaw the
design and production of what became one
of the best-known airplanes of all time. Wells
died at his home in Bellevue, Wash., in 1986.
Jogger flashed in Foothills
A stress-relieving jog during Finals Week
was rudely interrupted for one Stanford stu
dent.
A junior was jogging along Junipero Serra
Boulevard after an afternoon final on March
20 when she heard kissing noises in the
bushes near Lake Lagunita.
The student, who wishes to remain anon
ymous, turned around to see a man who
had dropped his jeans to his ankles. She
described him as 6 feet tall, 180 pounds,
with brown hair and a white T-shirt, al

though the darkness made identification dif
ficult.
"At first I wasn't scared. I laughed, but
when I realized I was alone, I got angry
and just ran really fast," said the student,
who called the police immediately afterward.
The incident is one of the first reported
flashings since two men were apprehended
Jan. 15 and Feb. 6 for a series of indecent
exposure incidents on campus.
