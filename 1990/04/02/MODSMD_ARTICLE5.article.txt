# Biz school snatches Harvard dean
## 
### Raoul Mowatt Editorial staff 
In a coup over its primary East
Coast rival, Stanford has hired
the second-highest administrator
at Harvard University to oversee
the prestigious Graduate School
of Business.
An 18-member search commit
tee appointed A. Michael Spenfce,
a highly regarded economics
scholar, to become dean of the
Business School next fall.
Spence succeeds Robert
Jaedicke, who will step down after
six years as dean. Jaedicke an
nounced last year that he plans
to teach and research in account
ing.
As dean of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences at Harvard, Spence

has held one of the nation's top
academic posts, the equivalent of
provost at many other univer
sities.
Spence attributed much of his
decision to come to Stanford to
the global nature of business.
With increasing competitive pres
sure worldwide, managers are
finding themselves in unfamiliar
and uncomfortable situations, he
explained.
"It's a very challenging time for
business, and it creates new op
portunities for research and edu
cation," he said, adding that as
dean of the Business School he
would be in an ideal position to
foster synergy between the two
worlds.
