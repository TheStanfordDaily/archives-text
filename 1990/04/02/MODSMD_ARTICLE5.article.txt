## 
### Raoul Mowatt Editorial staff 
In a coup over its primary East
Coast rival, Stanford has hired
the second-highest administrator
at Harvard University to oversee
the prestigious Graduate School
of Business.
An 18-member search commit
tee appointed A. Michael Spenfce,
a highly regarded economics
scholar, to become dean of the
Business School next fall.
Spence succeeds Robert
Jaedicke, who will step down after
six years as dean. Jaedicke an
nounced last year that he plans
to teach and research in account
ing.
As dean of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences at Harvard, Spence

has held one of the nation's top
academic posts, the equivalent of
provost at many other univer
sities.
Spence attributed much of his
decision to come to Stanford to
the global nature of business.
With increasing competitive pres
sure worldwide, managers are
finding themselves in unfamiliar
and uncomfortable situations, he
explained.
"It's a very challenging time for
business, and it creates new op
portunities for research and edu
cation," he said, adding that as
dean of the Business School he
would be in an ideal position to
foster synergy between the two
worlds.


A. Michael Spence
Spence currently oversees 700
Harvard faculty members and
9,000 students. By contrast, he
will supervise 120 faculty mem
bers and 800 students at the Busi
ness School.
Spence, 46, received a bachelor's
degree in philosophy from Prince
ton University and earned both
an additional bachelor's and a
master's as a Rhodes scholar at
Oxford University.
Specializing in market mecha
nisms, Spence earned his doc
torate in economics from
Harvard.
Spence taught and researched
economics at Stanford from 1973
to 1975, while his wife, Ann Ben
nett Spence, was earning her
M.B.A. from the Business School.
"He produced a phenomenal
amount of work in the two years
he was at Stanford, more than
many people do in a lifetime,"
said Provost James Rosse, who
appointed him to the economics
faculty.
Because Boston offered better
employment prospects for his
wife, Spence returned to Harvard,
where he climbed the academic
ranks and received the John Bates
Clark Medal for his research.

Kennedy praised the selection

dinary" choice, predicting that
Spence's diverse experiences in
academia will make him a suc
cessful dean.
Spence said his colleagues have
expressed sadness at his depar
ture while feeling happiness at
the new opportunities available to
him at Stanford.
Harvard President Derek Bok
said, "All of Harvard owes Mike
Spence a great debt of gratitude
for the skillful and imaginative
way in which he has led the Fac
ulty of Arts and Sciences during
the past six years."
Spence said he will confer with
faculty, students and alumni in
mid-April to prepare for his new
position.

program to prepare managers for
future economic shifts. The school
