Chinua Achebe, a noted African
author, has canceled his scheduled
visit and faculty appointment for
spring quarter following a serious
automobile accident near the
Nigerian city of Enugu March 23.
Achebe, author of the critically
acclaimed novels "Things Fall
Apart" and "Anthills of the
Savannah," was riding in a
chauffeur-driven car with his
eldest son when the rear axle of
the rental vehicle snapped, flip

ping the car and throwing both
passengers and the driver from
the vehicle, according to David
Abernethy, director for the Center
for African Studies.
Abernethy, who has been main
taining telephone communica
tions with Achebe's family, said
that Achebe "sustained the worst
injuries" because the car rolled
on top of him before coming to
rest, causing extensive rib, chest
and back damage.
Achebe was flown to Paddocks
Hospital in England for treat

ment. He is "mentally alert," al
though doctors have yet to
determine if the author has sus
tained permanent spinal iryury,
Abernethy said.
Word of Achebe's accident sent
waves of shock and regret rippling
through the Stanford community.
"I have not taken it in yet,"
lamented Sylvia Wynter, director
of African and Afro-American
Studies. "It would have been an
unparalleled event if Achebe had
come, given his centrality and im
portance to African literature and

fiction.
"He would have been very ex
citing, and students would have
really enjoyed interacting with
him," she added.
About 100 students who were
planning to take Achebe's courses
will have to leaf through their
time schedules in search of classes
to replace the two courses.
The African and Afro-American
Studies courses, titled "Achebe:
His Fiction, His World" and "Con
temporary African Fiction," have
been postponed indefinitely.
