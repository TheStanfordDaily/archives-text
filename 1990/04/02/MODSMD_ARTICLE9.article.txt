# Freshman censured by dean for drunkenness
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
A Residential Education official has sent a
harshly worded warning letter to a Branner
Hall freshman who passed out from drunken
ness at a Cow Palace wrestling show March 7.
The freshman was inadvertently left in a
Cow Palace bathroom by friends who thought
he had left the San Francisco arena already.
Security guards found the freshman lying in
his own vomit, according to a Branner resident
assistant. Chin said emergency medical tech
nicians who attended to the freshman esti
mated that his blood alcohol level was about
twice the legal limit to drive.
The Cow Palace incident caused quite a stir
at Branner because several RAs and resident
fellow Kennell Jackson were awakened late

that night by the guards, who reportedly
warned one RA that they would call the police
if someone from Stanford did not come to
pick up the freshman.
Jackson would not comment on the incident.
Jack Chin, the residence dean for Branner,
sent the critical letter to the freshman after
interviewing Jackson, the RAs and several of
the students involved.
The freshman, along with two other Bran
ner residents, met a group of about seven
other Stanford students at the Cow Palace
before the show, Chin found in his investiga
tion. The group's driver was kicked out of the
Cow Palace after a scuffle with another wres
tling fan.
He drove home about the same time the
drunken freshman passed out in the bath
room. His friends apparently thought he had

gone home with the combative driver.
The letter scolds the freshman for irrespon
sible behavior and asks him to consider getting
treatment for what apparently is a drinking
problem, Chin said. He said he sent no other
letters to anyone else involved because he
thought that the student who passed out was
the only one deserving blame.
"He really did leave himself quite vulnera
ble," Chin said. "If you get drunk, you leave
yourself open for all kinds of things." He
noted that the freshman lost his glasses and
his jacket while he was drunk.
The freshman was apparently served alcohol
at the Cow Palace because the vendor did not
check the student's identification.
Many of the students involved were mem
bers of the ski team, but the event was not
an official social gathering for any group.
