"CAMP CHALLENGE GAVE ME
THE CONFIDENCE TO SUCCEED."
I attended ROTC Basic Camp this past summer at Fort Knox, KY, because I
wanted to do something new, adventurous, and challenging. Camp Challenge
proved to be all of the above. I rotated into different leadership positions
(squad leader, platoon sergeant, executive officer) and participated in
several hard and challenging, but exciting training exercises. I rappelled,
fired weapons, learned how to navigate cross country with a map and
compass, and much more. I also built many strong friendships.
For student convenience classes are now offered on campus,
preparing students for success! Find out more, call Larry Hall or
Tom Weissmiller at (408) 554-4781 collect.
