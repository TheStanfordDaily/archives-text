# Iraq unveils new threat
## Binary chemical weapons may be used against Israel 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraqi Pres
ident Saddam Hussein said for the first
time yesterday that his country has
deadly binary nerve gas weapons, and
he threatened to use them on Israel
if the Jewish state attacks Iraq.
Binary weapons, usually artillery
shells or missile warheads, contain two
relatively safe compounds that com
bine to produce toxic nerve gases. They
are outlawed under a 1925 treaty.
Iraq is already seen as a front
runner in a Middle East drive to
develop arsenals of long-range and
surface-to-surface missiles. Its devel
opment of chemical weapons, and pos
sibly nuclear arms, has raised fears of
an arms race in the volatile region.
In Israel, government officials
warned yesterday that Israel would
retaliate if Hussein used chemical
weapons against it.
The U.S. State Department de
nounced Hussein's chemical weapons
threat as "inflammatory, irresponsible
and outrageous."
Hussein, in a speech broadcast by
Baghdad Radio, denied Iraq has nu
clear weapons. Concerns about this
were raised last week by the intercep
tion in London of 40 Iraqi-bound trig
ger devices that officials said were de
signed for nuclear bombs.
"I categorically deny that we have
any atomic bombs," the president said
at a ceremony in Baghdad, where he
awarded medals to senior military of
ficers.
Hussein claimed that during the
1980-88 war with Iran, "Iraq was of
fered enriched uranium and even a
complete atomic bomb by people who
were either American, British or
Zionist agents. But Iraq turned down
these offers."
He did not elaborate. Such an offer
would not be in accord with Western
efforts to block nuclear military tech
nology to developing nations.
Hussein warned the Israelis that if

they try to repeat their June 1981 air
strike on a French-built nuclear reaa»
tor near Baghdad, he will retaliate
with chemical weapons.
"I say that if Israel dares to hit even
one piece of steel on any industrial
site, we will make the fire eat half of
Israel," he declared.
"Let them hear, here and now, that
we do possess binary chemical weap
ons which only the United States and
Soviet Union have."
In a clear reference to Israel,
believed to be the only Middle Eastern
power with nuclear weapons, Hussein
said: "Those who are threatening us
with nuclear bombs: we warn them
that we will hit them with this binary
chemical weapon."
A statement issued in Jerusalem by
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Is
rael said Hussein's remarks "reveal
once again the basic threat at the root
of the situation in the Middle East,
which is . . . the continued aspiration
to destroy Israel. . . . Let there be no
doubt, Israel will also know how to
defend itself in the future and defeat
the evil designs of its enemies.".
Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said,
"We have no aggressive intention
against anyone, including Iraq." .
Asked about a possible preemptive
strike, Pazner said: "We don't even
want to talk about that kind of thing."
Western intelligence officials have
long said Iraq is developing chemical
weapons at top-secret research instal
lations.
Only the United States and Soviet
Union have officially admitted having
binary weapons, although other coun
tries were believed to possess them.
The Iraqis have told Israel several
times the last two years not to launch
preemptive strikes against its burgeon
ing arms industry. Baghdad says it
now is capable of producing long-range
missiles and rockets capable of putting
satellites into space orbit.
