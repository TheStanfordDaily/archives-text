ASSU candidates should
think seriously about
why they are running

IN 1988, George Bush and Mi
chael Dukakis waged a presi
dential campaign filled with
cheap shots, malicious innuendo
and meaningless rhetoric.
That was the season in which
Willie Horton, the "wimp" factor,
flag factories and "Where was
George?" baiting became more im
portant national issues than the
federal deficit, foreign policy,
poverty and education.
In 1990, California's Democratic
gubernatorial candidates, Dianne
Feinstein and John Van de Kamp,
have traded nasty barbs in televi
sion ads — Van de Kamp citing
selected newspaper articles under
mining Feinstein's mayoral record
and Feinstein juxtaposing Van de
Kamp and Richard Nixon.
With such political models, it's
no wonder that candidates for
ASSU offices sometimes stoop to
focus on less-than-significant is
sues themselves. The Stanford
community got a taste of this ap
proach with the recent spat over
ASSU resource guides distributed
by the current Council of Presi
dents.
With this spring's elections just
more than two weeks away, now
is the time for all the candidates
to commit to forging a civil cam
paign focusing on issues that are
important to the community.
Debates between COP slates

should address how the slates in
tend to increase student involve
ment in administrative decision
making, advance Stanford's multi
cultural goals and ensure that the
interests of all students are served
by their elected representatives.
Candidates should strive to ex
plain exactly what they stand for
and what they will work to ac
complish; to persuade students
why to vote for them, not just why
not to vote for their opponents.
The mud-slinging and nearly
slanderous attacks of professional
politicians are not constructive. A
clean, informative campaign is
what's needed.
And though all candidates
should certainly play by the rules
of the game, quibbling over tech
nicalities only wastes their time
and that of the campus community.
Now is also a good time for
ASSU Senate candidates to think
seriously about why they're run
ning and make sure they're willing
to make the necessary commit
ments if elected.
The Daily reported last month
that of 37 senators elected last
spring, 19 had missed four or more
senate meetings this year.
Some of the frequently absent
senators interviewed said they
were too busy with other things
to attend a meeting once every two
•Th» is: Why
did they run in the first place?
This year's candidates should ask
themselves the same question and
drop out of the race now if they
can't come up with a strong an
swer.
