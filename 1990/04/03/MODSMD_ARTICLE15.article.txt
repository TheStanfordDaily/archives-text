Pluralistic ideals do not exist in housed fraternities

CLARIFYING the concept of
pluralism within the Stanford
community these days is an
almost hopeless task. The paradigm
examples being used to illustrate the
failure of pluralism are, in reality,
nothing more than simple examples of
the failure of tolerance.
Essentially the growth of pluralism
is a silent inner process, which begins
when I first catch a glimpse of two
things: the unique feelings of comfort,
acceptance and power that I experience
when associating with people like
myself and the unique feelings of
discomfort, fear and powerlessness that
I experience when I am among people
who appear to be very different from
me.
The process of learning pluralism
begins in earnest when I decide to try
to unearth as much as I can of this
trap of comfort, belonging and power. I
must find the will to push past my
fear of others. From time to time, as I
enter the dining hall, I must make a
decision not to sit at a table with
friends, precisely because sitting with
friends is so very comfortable.
And from time to time I must have

the will to sit at a table precisely
because, among all my alternatives,
this is the one table at which initially
I will feel the most uncomfortable.
When it is hurdled again and again,
the fear of others shrinks. More impor
tantly, I slowly begin to enjoy the
unique satisfaction that comes from
letting myself enter into, or be entered
by, personalities and points of view
that are "foreign" to me; the more
foreign, the more interesting. When we
begin to feel this type of satisfaction,
we are realizing — experientially, not
intellectually — what pluralism means.
Learning pluralism has precious little
to do with reading books, listening to
lectures or satisfying distribution re
quirements. It rests almost entirely on
the constant undercurrent of learning
that is taking place or that is not
taking place within living groups.
If you plan on joining a housed
fraternity, please reconsider. To achieve
an education in pluralism — in the
United States of America, in 1990 — it
is necessary to absorb an extraordinary
diversity of philosophies and personali
ties:

tives — from the militant to the mild.
A great spectrum of Afro-American and
Chicano/Latino points of view. The
emerging voices of Asian-Americans
and Native Americans. The gays. The
disabled. The shy and introverted.
Occasionally rubbing shoulders with
this diversity — simply "tolerating" it,
or even being "friendly" to it — is not
enough. Pluralism requires sitting
down at the table. Regularly.
Have you already decided to rush
housed fraternities? Here's one way of
figuring out where to pledge. Bring to
the rush parties those of your friends
who are gay, who are angry and black,
who are uncomfortable about the role
alcohol plays in our lives, who speak
up when women are referred to in
terms of body parts and who are very

awkward socially. Judge the house by
its response to your diverse group of
friends.
Because it is an inner process, reject
ing pluralism will always be an option
at Stanford — whether or not housed
fraternities are phased out and
whether or not new distribution re
quirements or updates to the Funda
mental Standard are phased in.
Even for the person who opts for a
pluralistic education, three or four
years will always be no more than just
a beginning; the diversity is too great,
and the self-knowledge that is a neces
sary part of the process cannot be
rushed.
Democracy is not a finished project,
and pluralism is no more a liberal idea
than it is a conservative idea. It is no
more a colored idea than it is a white
idea. In essence pluralism is a spiri
tual, not political, ideal. Don't give up
on it, and don't give up on the resi
dence halls. Give us three or four
years. Stay with us, and help us figure
out what pluralism means and how to
make it work.
