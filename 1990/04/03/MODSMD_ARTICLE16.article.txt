# University must actively commit to aid environment
## 
### 
* As humans, we live in an age when
local and global environmental degrada
tion has called us louder than ever to
make significant changes in our socio
economic, political and personal think
ing about our impact on this earth we
share.
Stanford, in its commitment to pro

gressive education, advocates that it is
responding to that call by offering
programs that prepare students to be
come leaders in determining solutions
to environmental problems. Yet Stan
ford fails to act on its claims by pro
viding consistent courses from which to
gain knowledge for educated environ
mental decision-making.
The recent cancellation of Human
Biology 148: Environomental Policy is
a prime example of this lack of com
mitment. Its termination is symbolic of
a trend throughout the campus, includ
ing constant cancellation of Urban
Studies courses and the complete ter
mination of the Resources Planning

graduate program from the Civil Engi
neering Department.
While it is possible to construct a
major focusing on environmental
studies and natural resource use, rele
vant courses are often difficult to find
and those that are available are offered
inconsistently. What is needed, and has
been suggested by University President
Donald Kennedy, is a mtyor program
devoted entirely to environmental
studies so that students may be guar
anteed of a substantial rather than
substandard environmental education.
Now, more than ever, the earth re
quires environmentally educated leaders

in all industries and areas of life to
collectively determine wise use or non
use of life-sustaining resources.
It is my hope that the University
truly makes an active committment to
the ideals expressed at the Human
Biology "Challenge for 2005" confer
ence and begins to consistently provide
its students with the tools to make the
difficult natural resource decisions that
our collective future depends on. The
development of a strong environmental
curriculum is the first step toward
that goal.
