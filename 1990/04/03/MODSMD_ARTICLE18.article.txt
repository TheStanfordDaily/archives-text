## Racist tag is inaccurate 
### 
A PERSISTENT theme of Stanford
debate and politics has been the
litany of grievances from student
groups — most notably, the Black Stu
dent Union — charging discrimination
and racism. This contentiousness has
touched many forums and has pushed
itself to the heart of many of the signif
icant debates on this campus.
Discussion of the recent University
Committee on Minority Issues report, the
question of ethnic studies, the Webb
Ranch dispute and the Western Culture
debate all were drawn, to some degree,
as conflicts of race relations. Parties such
as the People's Platform have tried to
present Stanford as a university which
has racial antagonism insidiously woven
into the fabric of its daily life.
This perception of "institutional rac
ism" is a vision of Stanford that is
profoundly inaccurate. It has produced a
number of unfounded — and
ly, unfair — charges of racism; it hasi
helped to create misdirected policies and
bad decisions, and it has severely
debilitated our ability to conduct produc
tive debate on social and political ques
tions: this is perhaps its worst effect.
The genuine concern for racial issues
on the part of most students, staff and
faculty has extricated Stanford from the
morass of apathy and prejudice found in
many communities in the United States,
and indeed, on some campuses across the
country.
Our concern has been translated into
a sort of knee-jerk liberalism, and not
into the careful, reasoned analysis and
discussion of which we are so very capa

ble. Instead, the primary mode of argu
ment seems to be "proof through vehe
ment assertion." This simple fervor has
driven campus debate to the level of the
label-and-smear tactics which charac
terize professional political debate.
The smear most often used is the racist
tag. It is also extremely effective: it im
mediately puts the person or group on
the defensive, where the accused must
prove his innocence. The "institutional
racism" or covert racism allegations are
even more potent.
An accusation of racism of any sort
can be made without proof or significant
evidence and be accepted as fact, but
covert racism can never be disproven,
because both evidence and lack of
evidence of racial antagonism work to
support the theory of covert racism. That
is, if no indication of racism exists, then
it can be said that it is simply well-hidden.
The racist label Was applied in the
Western Culture debate enabling the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values supporters to
obscure and discredit the arguments of
those who opposed the almost infinite
expansion of a course that was already
making a cursory and ad hoc study of
its subject matter.
The self-proclaimed progressive stu
dent groups were able to transform dis
cussion of this question into a referendum
on Stanford's sensitivity to minority con
cerns. This made Western Culture into
a battle between intolerance of the non-
Western social and intellectual tradition,
and the receptiveness and commitment
to multiculturalism. Only one outcome
was compatible with the latter; it was

Our concern for racial is
sues has been translated

liberalism and not into

not an issue where reasonable people
could disagree.
However, this condition must exactly
be present if Stanford is to have quality
discussion and debate and lay claim to
being an elite university.
For all the People's Platform's talk
about diversity, no other organization has
done more to work for uniformity in
thought. There seem 9 'to be a presump
tion that certain student groups have a
monopoly on compassion and insight. We
are led to believe that for conscientious
students there exists just one correct po
litical agenda.
The travesty of the "institutional rac
ism" rhetoric is that a whole portion of
this campus has been so imbibed with
its exclusive sense of rightness, that it
has embraced a dogmatism that is a per
version of true liberal values.
