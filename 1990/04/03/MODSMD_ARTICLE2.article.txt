# Workers voice discontent in study of SLAC
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Workers who have complained about inef
fective and intimidating management at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center are getting
the chance to air their concerns in a study
evaluating the laboratory's management prac
tices.
According to some SLAC workers, the study,
being performed by an outside firm, was begun
in time to save the laboratory from damaging
organizational problems.
In a February memo, SLAC director Burton
Richter said the study had been contracted to
evaluate the organizational effectiveness of
SLAC.
"During the past years, SIxAC has undergone
considerable change â€” in leadership, in tech
nical demands, in general strategic direction
and in organizational structure," he wrote. "It
is time for us to examine these issues and
understand what has positively and negatively
influenced our effectiveness."
Lon Warneke, a senior SLAC cryogenics tech
nician, said changes in the laboratory's man
agement style over the last five years have
reduced the morale of SLAC workers. "It's too
damned difficult to get anything completed,"
Warneke said. He blamed much of the problem
on the efforts of new management to stream
line SLAC's research practices.
Widespread "intimidation" is used by the
management, especially in the technical divi
sion, Warneke said. He charged that the upper
management at SLAC threatened workers with
punitive measures to the point that workers
didn't want to take individual initiative. SLAC
physicists, who did not want to be named,
affirmed that much of the problem occurred
in the technical division.
Technical division director Kaye Lathrop
said workers have not notified his office of
any discontent over management practices. In
timidation is not used to make workers more
efficient, hr said. "We definitely don't do busi
ness that way."
Warneke said the management also threw
away much of SLAC's older equipment which
could still have been used. He cited one ex
ample in which a $100,000 magnet that was
still functional was thrown out.
Warneke, who is a United Stanford Workers
steward, said the technical division's manage
ment ignored the voicing of worker grievances
and created little opportunity for worker ad
vancement. He added that the management
did not pursue affirmative action
policies.
Lathrop said much of the
workers' frustration can be traced
to recent SLAC projects. Last year,
SLAC announced that the new
Stanford Linear Collider had
produced an elusive Z particle
after spending many frustrating
months fixing problems with the
collider.
"It was a long, arduous job
making the linear collider work,"
Lathrop said. "There is a natural
letdown after that."
Decreasing government funding
of the center adds to the stress

faced by the workers, he said.
Lee Lyon, SLAC personnel serv
ices manager, said the recently
commissioned study is similar to
other studies performed by organ
izations to evaluate themselves
and is not a direct response to
worker discontent. While admit
ting there may be signals of
worker frustration, Lyon said
SLAC's performance as a research
lab has not been seriously ham
pered.
The study is being conducted
by Frank Lee Associates, a Santa
Cruz-based consulting firm.
Nancy Davidson, director of busi
ness development at Frank Lee,
said the study is being done
through a series of small-group
discussions with randomly chosen
SLAC workers.
