Martin Amis has embarked
upon a remarkable literary exper
iment. On the first page of "Lon
don Fields," he tells us specifically
what the book is about. And then,
over the course of the next 469
pages, he makes the story inter
esting enough to read anyway.
The novel is encased in its own
24-two-tier-chaptered fatality and
moves inexorably toward an
apocalyptic climax, strongly rein

forced by the imminent end of the
millenium.
Amis writes as American author
Samson Young in London, al
though he is unambiguously Eng
lish in reality.
He engages a wide spectrum of
London society in his novel. The
main reason the novel succeeds
is that its two main characters —
Keith Talent and Nicola Six —
are fascinating material for any
student of human nature.
Six is undoubtedly one of the
most memorable vamps ever. She
professes to be more than a
femme fatale — she is a murderee.
Coupled with the fact that
Amis' work is sexually compre

hensive, in its allusions and tone,
the combination is provocative
and very interesting.
Six is maliciously mischievous,
toying with the lives of men in a
deliberate and tantalizing man
ner. What makes her lethal is her
quiver full of kisses.
"You came out of them entirely
plaque-free. The Rosebud, the

gin.
Her prescience dooms her to
foreknowledge of her own death,
and she executes the actions nec
essary for its realization in a dis
turbingly efficient manner.
Keith Talent is a remarkable
modern character. He represents
archetypal pub culture, where
darting excellence is the most
noble plane he can aspire to. He
lives without a conscience, driven
by a base, primitive force that he
himself cannot and does not un
derstand.
He plows through a world of
napalm sauce in Indian restau
rants, a sincere tabloid reader
whose excessive drinking of cheap
foreign liquor fires his erratic
sexual drive. And of course, tele
vision is a universe which engulfs
him entirely. He is confused by
its reality, but his video gives him
absolute control over the sexual
titillation it provides.
Amis projects his fatalism onto
"London Fields." The city spirals
towards a Malthean vortex, where
death and its bearers emerge
forcefully. The love triangle be
tween Six, Talent and wealthy
Guy Clinch is complicated by the
author's imminent mortality.
He transforms their geometry
into the shape of the "Black
Cross," a pub they all frequent.
He atrophies over the course of
the book, just as London does,
although his is a more stable, pre
dictable malaise.
The novel is more than just a
story — at times, it seems to be
a frightening, dangerous scenario.
