Martin Amis has embarked
upon a remarkable literary exper
iment. On the first page of "Lon
don Fields," he tells us specifically
what the book is about. And then,
over the course of the next 469
pages, he makes the story inter
esting enough to read anyway.
The novel is encased in its own
24-two-tier-chaptered fatality and
moves inexorably toward an
apocalyptic climax, strongly rein

forced by the imminent end of the
millenium.
Amis writes as American author
Samson Young in London, al
though he is unambiguously Eng
lish in reality.
He engages a wide spectrum of
London society in his novel. The
main reason the novel succeeds
is that its two main characters —
Keith Talent and Nicola Six —
are fascinating material for any
student of human nature.
Six is undoubtedly one of the
most memorable vamps ever. She
professes to be more than a
femme fatale — she is a murderee.
Coupled with the fact that
Amis' work is sexually compre

hensive, in its allusions and tone,
the combination is provocative
and very interesting.
Six is maliciously mischievous,
toying with the lives of men in a
deliberate and tantalizing man
ner. What makes her lethal is her
quiver full of kisses.
