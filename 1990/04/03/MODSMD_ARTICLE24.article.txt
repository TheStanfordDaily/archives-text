Very few people have had the
opportunity to live in both the
United States and the Soviet
Union. Fewer still have written a
book that takes an honest look at
the values and beliefs of these
two societies.
Vladimir Pozner is such a man,
and "Parting with Illusions" is
such a book.
In "Parting with Illusions,"
Pozner boldly takes perestroika to
a new level, offering his personal
views on the strengths and weak
nesses of both societies. In the
process, he also provides an in
teresting personal account of the
history of the Soviet Union, from
the Bolshevik revolution of 1917
to Gorbachev's latest economic
and political reforms.
Pozner was born in France,
grew up in New York, or "Noo
Yawk" as he affectionately calls
it, and has lived in the Soviet
Union since the age of 18. He
writes from the unique perspec
tive of someone who fully under
stands the national philosophies
of both the United States and the
Soviet Union.
Drawing from his experiences
in both countries, Pozner puts to
gether a riveting exploration of
two radically different worlds —
a capitalist America and a socialist
Soviet Union. His account and
opinions are usually presented
with just enough personal infor
mation, such as an anecdote or
personal experience he distinctly
remembers, to give the reader a
feel for his honesty and reasoning
in coming to his conclusions.
Throughout his presentation,

which only roughly resembles that
of an autobiography, Pozner plays
no favorite, being quick to point
out the strengths as well as the
shortcomings of both societies.
Pozner admits that neither soci
ety is Utopian. Pozner, though, is
a staunch supporter of socialism,
stating "For as long as I can re
member my political views, I
believed that socialism had the
realistic potential to provide a
more fair, just and open society
than any other system that
preceded it."
He then goes on to add, "But
during the 37 years of my life in
the Soviet Union, I came clearly
to understand the way in which
socialism had been led down a
crooked, tortuous lane away from
the road originally mapped by
some of humanity's most
profound minds."
He knows that the Soviet Union
is not perfect and writes, "We
have witnessed more than one oc
casion when the Party made a
decision that turned out to be a
disaster for the country — forced
collectivization and going into Af
ghanistan are just two cases that
come to mind."
Throughout the book, Pozner
pays special attention to the role
of dissent. A case in point is that
of Andrei Sakharov. Ashamed,
Pozner admits to condemning
Sakharov when he was exiled to
Gorky, "which is like exiling some
one to Detroit."
On this issue, he continues
"What do you do with a prominent
citizen who allows himself to be
used against his own country? Is
it not true that any government
will react to what it conceives to
be a threat? When a system con
siders itself threatened by a per
son or organization, that person
or organization will have to suffer
the consequences."

Pozner does not let the issue
rest with this rationalization,
though. He goes on to condemn
the actions of his country, and
himself, by saying, "The [ anti-
Soviet propagandal laws were
wrong, and what was done to 112
Sakharovl, who broke those laws,
was wrong."
This is not the only case in
which Pozner openly criticizes the
Soviet Union. He presents many
opinions that one would expect
more from an American politician
than from a Soviet journalist.
Being foreign-born, Pozner's
right to travel abroad was severely
restricted for 38 years. It is not
surprising to find Pozner refer
ring to travel as "a basic human
right." On this subject, he goes
on to write, "Anyone who wishes
to leave his or her country, be it
for a while or for good, is born
with the right to do so, regardless
of the laws of the land."
As a journalist for the better
part of the past four decades, Poz
ner has traveled through much of
the Soviet Union. These experi
ences have given him an insider's
view into many social issues in
the Soviet Union. He uses this
insight as he discusses topics such
as anti-Semitism and racism in
the Soviet Union, providing both
a historical and a personal expla
nation of the causes for these
forms of social unrest.
There is no doubt that Pozner's
work was only made possible by
the recent developments in the So
viet Union and that if things take
a change for the worse, he will
have much to answer for.
Pozner makes it painfully clear
that both the Soviets and the
Americans must break the self
serving molds they hold of each
other and begin addressing the
needs of humanity and the envi
ronment.
