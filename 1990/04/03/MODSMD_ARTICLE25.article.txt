## Card nine reach tourney final, lose 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
MINNEAPOLIS - The last
time they met was in the 1988
College World Series. After Sun
day's game in the Pillsbury Base
ball Classic, the next time they
meet could be in the 1990 Series.
As snowflakes danced on the
Hubert H. Humphrey Metro
dome's fiberglasss roof, Stanford
and Miami played 10 innings of
championship-calibre collegiate
baseball with a tournament title
and a No. 1 ranking on the line.
The Hurricanes captured both
in dramatic fashion, as Miami
mustered a run with two out in
the bottom of the 10th to edge
the third-ranked Cardinal 4-3.
Miami spoiled what was other
wise simply a splendid weekend
for Stanford in the Land of 10,000
Lakes. On Saturday, the Card
nine obliterated the defending
NCAA champion Wichita State
Shockers for a 10-1 victory. The
win came just 15 hours after Stan
ford's 10-4 shellacking of host
Minnesota on Friday night.
The Cardinal entered the Pills
bury Classic with a gaudy 24-6
record after taking two of three
from Fresno State and posting a
12-8 road win over the 49ers of
Long Beach State.
Freshman hurler Brian Sack
insky brought a 4-0 record into
Sunday's start against Miami.
Win number four was especially
memorable for Sackinsky, as the
right-hander pitched eight and a
third no-hit innings against
Fresno before allowing a Bulldog
hit.

In the Metrodome, Sackinsky
and Hurricane starter Shawn
Purdy engaged in a contest which
contained all the elements of a
classic pitching duel: fine pitch
selection, crafty speed changes,
and solid defensive play behind
them.
Purdy's performance for the
Hurricanes was so masterful that
it jeopardized Stanford center
fielder Jeff Hammonds' consecu
tive game hitting streak.
The freshman sensation came
into the tournament having hit
safely in 23 straight contests.
Hammonds extended the streak
against Minnesota and Wichita
State with first inning singles to
right field and pushed his total
to 25 games.
Purdy stymied Hammonds' at
tempt to continue the streak for
the majority of Sunday's game.
The crafty right-hander induced
Hammonds to fly out in the first
and struck him out in the third.
In the top of the fifth, the fresh
man did reach base on a fielder's
choice, but was hitless as he came
to the plate to lead off the eighth
inning. As Stanford trailed Miami
3-2 after seven, it appeared as if
this would be Hammonds' final
opportunity to get a hit.
The roolue phenom stepped into
the box and watched a ball sail
outside before roping Purdy's sec
ond offering down the right field
line for a hit and move the streak
to 26 consecutive games.
Hammonds has now hit safely
in 32 of Stanford's 33 contests
and stands just two games shy of
tying teammate Troy Paulsen's
school record. Paulsen expressed

nothing but admiration for the
freshman's run at his record.
"I'm really happy for him and
I hope he breaks it. We've talked
about it and I am very excited
for Jeff," Paulsen said.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Hammonds' personal accomplish
ment came on an afternoon where
things just seemed unwilling to
go Stanford's way.
Sackinsky walked Miami's Mike
Tosar and Jorge Fabregas in the
opening inning and both came
around to score on a double off
the bat of designated hitter Frank
Mora.
The Cardinal missed a great
scoring opportunity in the top of
the second after filling the bases
with no one out. Leftfielder Ryan
Turner's fly-out to right was too
shallow to allow Paul Carey to
tag-up from third, and Roger Bur
nett grounded to short for an
inning-ending double play.
Miami pushed its lead to 3-0 in
the third, but Stanford countered
with two of its own in the fifth
to cut the defecit to one.
The Cardinal knocked out
starter Purdy in the top of the
ninth with consecutive singles by

Steve Solomon, Tuner, and Bur
nett to load the bases with no
outs. Hurricane reliever Todd
Bush came in and appeared to be
on his way out of the jam, as he
fanned Troy Tallman and got
Hammonds to ground to short
stop Greg Erickson, who nailed
Solomon at the plate.
However, the 'Canes bullpen
ace then walked Paulsen to bring
in Turner and tie the game at
three. First baseman David
McCarty grounded out to end the
rally, but Stanford had success
fully matched Miami's early lead.
In the extra frame, Stanford
third baseman Tim Griffin
stroked a double, but was
stranded at third to end the Car
dinal's threat. Greg Erickson led
off for Miami in the bottom of
the tenth and was walked by Car
dinal reliever Scott Weiss, who
came on in the seventh after
starter Sackinsky experienced
back pain in his throwing motion.
Erickson stole second and
moved to third on a force out.
With two men out, first baseman
Charles Johnson drove a Weiss
fastball into centerfield to score
Erickson and give Miami a hard
fought win.
For Griffin, the loss sparked a
desire for redemption.
"We played well and had plenty
of opportunities to win this game.
We definetly want another shot
at them (Miami), so we can show
what we've got," Griffin said.
Stanford certainly displayed its
vast array of talent in the opening
games of the Classic. Starter Mike
Mussina pushed his record to 6-3
with an excellent outing against
Witchita State, as the hard throw
ing righty carried a shutout into
the eighth and pitched his sixth
straight complete game.
Mussina allowed just six hits
and struck out six Shockers. The
junior was the beneficiary off 12
Cardinal hits for 10 runs, includ
ing round-trippers by Paulsen and
Griffin.
Griffin's homer was a
monstrous shot off Wichita's
Jamie Williams that sailed 15
rows deep in the leftfield stands,
and pushed his team leading to
tals to 14 four-baggers and 46
RBIs in just 33 games.
On Friday night, Stan Spencer
picked up win number eight in
his fifth consecutive complete
game victory. While giving up 10
hits to the Golden Gophers, Spen
cer kept his 1990 record un
blemished on the strength of 17
Stanford hits.
Four Cardinal players were
named by the working media to
the all-tournament team.
Rightfielder Paul Carey, who went
4 for 10, joined Griffin, Ham
monds and Paulsen for all-
Pillsbury honors.

Hammonds' personal accomplish
ment came on an afternoon where
things just seemed unwilling to
go Stanford's way.
Sackinsky walked Miami's Mike
Tosar and Jorge Fabregas in the
opening inning and both came
around to score on a double off
the bat of designated hitter Frank
Mora.
The Cardinal missed a great
scoring opportunity in the top of
the second after filling the bases
with no one out. Leftfielder Ryan
Turner's fly-out to right was too
shallow to allow Paul Carey to
tag-up from third, and Roger Bur
nett grounded to short for an
inning-ending double play.
Miami pushed its lead to 3-0 in
the third, but Stanford countered
with two of its own in the fifth
to cut the defecit to one.
The Cardinal knocked out
starter Purdy in the top of the
ninth with consecutive singles by

Steve Solomon, Tuner, and Bur
nett to load the bases with no
outs. Hurricane reliever Todd
Bush came in and appeared to be
on his way out of the jam, as he
fanned Troy Tallman and got
Hammonds to ground to short
stop Greg Erickson, who nailed
Solomon at the plate.
However, the 'Canes bullpen
ace then walked Paulsen to bring
in Turner and tie the game at
three. First baseman David
McCarty grounded out to end the
rally, but Stanford had success
fully matched Miami's early lead.
In the extra frame, Stanford
third baseman Tim Griffin
stroked a double, but was
stranded at third to end the Car
dinal's threat. Greg Erickson led
off for Miami in the bottom of
the tenth and was walked by Car
dinal reliever Scott Weiss, who
came on in the seventh after
starter Sackinsky experienced
back pain in his throwing motion.
Erickson stole second and
moved to third on a force out.
With two men out, first baseman
Charles Johnson drove a Weiss
fastball into centerfield to score
Erickson and give Miami a hard
fought win.
For Griffin, the loss sparked a
desire for redemption.
"We played well and had plenty
of opportunities to win this game.
We definetly want another shot
at them (Miami), so we can show
what we've got," Griffin said.
Stanford certainly displayed its
vast array of talent in the opening
games of the Classic. Starter Mike
Mussina pushed his record to 6-3
with an excellent outing against
Witchita State, as the hard throw
ing righty carried a shutout into
the eighth and pitched his sixth
straight complete game.
Mussina allowed just six hits
and struck out six Shockers. The
junior was the beneficiary off 12
Cardinal hits for 10 runs, includ
ing round-trippers by Paulsen and
Griffin.
Griffin's homer was a
monstrous shot off Wichita's
Jamie Williams that sailed 15
rows deep in the leftfield stands,
and pushed his team leading to
tals to 14 four-baggers and 46
RBIs in just 33 games.
On Friday night, Stan Spencer
picked up win number eight in
his fifth consecutive complete
game victory. While giving up 10
hits to the Golden Gophers, Spen
cer kept his 1990 record un
blemished on the strength of 17
Stanford hits.
Four Cardinal players were
named by the working media to
the all-tournament team.
Rightfielder Paul Carey, who went
4 for 10, joined Griffin, Ham
monds and Paulsen for all-
Pillsbury honors.


Al Green — Daily file
Cardinal senior Tim Griffin continued his torrid hitting with a monstrous home run in the Minneapolis
Metrodome last Saturday. Stanford finished second in the weekend tournament, losing the final to
No. 2-ranked Miami, 4-3 in 10 innings.
MINNEAPOLIS - The last
time they met was in the 1988
College World Series. After Sun
day's game in the Pillsbury Base
ball Classic, the next time they
meet could be in the 1990 Series.
As snowflakes danced on the
Hubert H. Humphrey Metro
dome's fiberglasss roof, Stanford
and Miami played 10 innings of
championship-calibre collegiate
baseball with a tournament title
and a No. 1 ranking on the line.
The Hurricanes captured both
in dramatic fashion, as Miami
mustered a run with two out in
the bottom of the 10th to edge
the third-ranked Cardinal 4-3.
Miami spoiled what was other
wise simply a splendid weekend
for Stanford in the Land of 10,000
Lakes. On Saturday, the Card
nine obliterated the defending
NCAA champion Wichita State
Shockers for a 10-1 victory. The
win came just 15 hours after Stan
ford's 10-4 shellacking of host
Minnesota on Friday night.
The Cardinal entered the Pills
bury Classic with a gaudy 24-6
record after taking two of three
from Fresno State and posting a
12-8 road win over the 49ers of
Long Beach State.
Freshman hurler Brian Sack
insky brought a 4-0 record into
Sunday's start against Miami.
Win number four was especially
memorable for Sackinsky, as the
right-hander pitched eight and a
third no-hit innings against
Fresno before allowing a Bulldog
hit.

In the Metrodome, Sackinsky
and Hurricane starter Shawn
Purdy engaged in a contest which
contained all the elements of a
classic pitching duel: fine pitch
selection, crafty speed changes,
and solid defensive play behind
them.
Purdy's performance for the
Hurricanes was so masterful that
it jeopardized Stanford center
fielder Jeff Hammonds' consecu
tive game hitting streak.
The freshman sensation came
into the tournament having hit
safely in 23 straight contests.
Hammonds extended the streak
against Minnesota and Wichita
State with first inning singles to
right field and pushed his total
to 25 games.
Purdy stymied Hammonds' at
tempt to continue the streak for
the majority of Sunday's game.
The crafty right-hander induced
Hammonds to fly out in the first
and struck him out in the third.
In the top of the fifth, the fresh
man did reach base on a fielder's
choice, but was hitless as he came
to the plate to lead off the eighth
inning. As Stanford trailed Miami
3-2 after seven, it appeared as if
this would be Hammonds' final
opportunity to get a hit.
The roolue phenom stepped into
the box and watched a ball sail
outside before roping Purdy's sec
ond offering down the right field
line for a hit and move the streak
to 26 consecutive games.
Hammonds has now hit safely
in 32 of Stanford's 33 contests
and stands just two games shy of
tying teammate Troy Paulsen's
school record. Paulsen expressed

nothing but admiration for the
freshman's run at his record.
"I'm really happy for him and
I hope he breaks it. We've talked
about it and I am very excited
for Jeff," Paulsen said.
