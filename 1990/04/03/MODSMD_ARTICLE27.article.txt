# Netters face Long Beach St. sans two
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
People around the country
travel hundreds of miles and pay
top dollar to see what Stanford
students have in their own back
yard.
The back yard is Stanford Ten
nis Stadium and the main attrac
tion is some of the best tennis in
the world — yes, the world.
Stanford's four top players —
Jonathan Stark, Alex O'Brien,
Jared Palmer and Jeff Cathrall
— could all step on the profes
sional circuit and win matches.
Glenn Solomon, Alexis Hombrec
her and Jason Yee could play in
the No. 1 spot on most collegiate
tennis squads. That's not even
mentioning Stanford's "loaded"
bench consisting of John Connol
ly, Ken Pedroza, Eric Peus, Barry
Richards, Roman Sydorak and
Dan Turbow — each of whom
compiled top rankings on the
junior circuit.
But, in college tennis, talent
does not always equal national
championships. Team chemistry,
doubles play and "guts" all play
into the equation.
In the next two weeks, No. 1-
ranked Stanford will see just how
good it is — as a team. Today's
match against Long Beach State
will be the first test of many.
Highly-ranked UCLA and USC
will follow over the weekend.
Second-ranked California will
come to the farm April 11.
"We can't go onto the court and
expeoi the other teams to lie
down," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "I doubt Long Beach
State will do that, and I know
USC and U£LA won't."

After spending its spring break
competing in Arizona, most of the
players look forward to the up
coming homestand. The Cardinal
will play its next seven matches
at home.
"Everyone is really looking for
ward to playing at home,"
Solomon said. "Playing on the
road can wear you out."
"We are coming into a crucial
part of our season," Gould added.
"I hope [today'si match starts off
a good homestand for us.
"It's natural to have a let down
[after winning]. We just have to
make sure we play to our capa
bility. It is important for us to
get momentum heading into the
weekend."
General admission tickets for
the matches against UCLA and
USC are on sale now for $2. Be
cause of the quality of the tennis,
both matches are expected to sell
out.
