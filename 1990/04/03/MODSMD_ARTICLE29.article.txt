# An open letter to Mr. Montgomery
## 
### 
Dear Coach Montgomery,
1 guess you're kind of
busy right now. But I
just have a few things I want
to say.
When you first came here I
wondered what you'd be like.
When I first saw you I won
dered where you got those
shoes. When I first saw your
team play, I wondered how
we'd ever beat anyone scoring
only 55 points a game or so.
But, as time passed my op
inion changed. I saw the value
of defense — not that full-court
defense Dr. Tom played, but
real defense. But I was still a
Montgomery detractor.
This year, covering you guys,
I got a better view of you as
a coach. And although even a
year ago I never thought I'd
say this, I'm going to say it
now:
Don't go.
You are not a perfect coach
by any means. But you have
improved greatly while here,
especially this year. I guess
that's why your phone keeps
ringing with calls from athletic
directors.
But know you have to decide,
once again, where you want to
go. Last year it was Maryland,
and you said no. This year Vir
ginia, and perhaps other
schools I haven't heard about,
are interested.
I think you should stay here.
I'll admit that a big part of my
reasoning is selfish. I think if
you stick around we can be
pretty good next year. As in
"go-to-the-regionals" good, per
haps.
Virginia will probably be
good, too, but they definitely
might not be as good. And
teams almost always struggle
with returning talent adjusting
to a new coach. Just look at
Ball State. After being ranked
in the top 20 most of last
season, returning everyone,
and adding Chandler
Thompson, the Cardinals still
had their problems all year un
til tournament time.
I'm not saying that will hap
pen at UVa, but it might.
Furthermore, 1 think you
are more likely to con
tinue to get better as a
coach here. Not to take any
thing away from the Cavalier
athletic program, but on the
Farm you are surrounded by
some of the best coaches in the
business. I don't want to name
names for fear of slighting
people but I can easily count
five Stanford coaches who are

probably the best in their
respective sports.
Tara VanDerveer learns
from Brooks Johnson. Fred
Sturm learns from VanDer
veer. And so on.
And the one reason I don't
think you should overlook in
volves ego. Now I'm not sug
gesting you have a large ego
or anything, but the biggest
reason for going to Virginia
seems to be to bolster your rep
utation.

Instead, you could stay on
the Farm and be fully confident
that everything you get is of
your own doing. Here, starting
basically from stratch, you took
a team to the NIT last year.
Next year you can take a team,
your own team, to the big show.
You may think of it as a chal
lenge to compete in the Atlantic
Coast Conference. Going up
against the best of the best
every game may seem like the
ultimate challenge.
But I think the ultimate
challenge is finding guys with
1200 SATs who can fill it up.
But the decision isn't
mine to make and you
have to do what you
think is best for you and your
family. Before you decide,
though, you should talk to a
couple of people.
Ask Richard Quick why he
left Texas. He had the perfect
program there and had won
five consecutive NCAA titles,
but he left to come here.
Ask Tara VanDerveer why
she left an outstanding situa J
tion at OHW?"State to come out
West. Ask Berhane Andeber
han why he doesn't take any
of the offers that must be com
ing his way.
But anyway, you have some
thinking to do, so I'll let you
go. Thanks for listening.
