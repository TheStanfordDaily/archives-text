# Ranch workers to vote on agreement
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
After almost one year of nego
tiations, Webb Ranch and the
United Stanford Workers have
reached a comprehensive tentative
agreement in their labor dispute.
The compromise will be presented
to the Webb workers for ratifica
tion today.
Both sides had sealed lips about
the details of the agreement, say
ing they wanted to give the
workers a chance to examine and
vote on it privately. But USW at
torney Jim Eggleston said the
compromise leans "in the
direction supported by the Stan
ford student body."
Various student groups have
lobbied on behalf of Webb workers
throughout the negotiations. Stu
dents also held a rally in support
of the workers in White Plaza
March 7.
Eggleston said he thought the
workers would accept the agree
ment, which addresses all the is
sues on the bargaining table,
including wages, housing and in
surance liability. The Webb fam
ily's attorney, Terrence O'Connor,
also said he hoped it would be
ratified.
Some non-substantive "struc
ture of language" in the agree
ment remained to be worked out
yesterday, according to Eggleston.
"The shouting's over,"
O'Connor said.
If the agreement is ratified, it

will mark the end of a long
standing labor dispute between
the Webbs and the USW. Workers
have demanded higher wages and
better housing conditions, among
other grievances. Negotiations
had been stalled until the tenta
tive agreement was reached Fri
day night.
Fifteen Webb workers partici
pated in the bargaining. In order
to be approved, the agreement will
require a majority vote of the ap
proximately 50 workers involved.
The vote will take place today
at 6 p.m. at the ranch.
On March 5, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy attempted
to speed up the pace of negotia
tions by threatening to forfeit the
Webb family's lease on the 237-
acre ranch if a settlement was not
reached soon.
At that time, Kennedy also
reiterated a January offer for the
University to serve as a neutral
mediator in the bargaining.
The Webbs accepted the offer
March 13. The USW did not.
Eggleston called the Universi
ty's pressure "helpful" in achiev
ing the agreement.
However, Political Science Prof.
John Manley, who has been an
active supporter of the Webb
workers, said, "It is incorrect to
give the University administra
tion much credit here. The fact
of the matter is that the Univer
sity . . . and Donald Kennedy in
particular have been bringing up
the rear for a year."
