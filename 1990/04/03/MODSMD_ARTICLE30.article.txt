# Athletes of the Week

### 
Spring break for you, maybe. While the
average Stanford student was sunning in
Maui or skiing in Jackson Hole, the average
Stanford student-athlete was out competing.
Amidst a full slate of action, three two
performers stood above the rest.
First of all we would be remiss in not
recognizing Sonja Henning, the floor leader
of the championship-winning women's bas
ketball team. And, for helping the women's
swimmers to a second-place finish at the
NCAA meet, The Daily tabs Janet Evans.
Finally, on the men's side, Nick Bravin
deserves special mention for his achievement
at yet another championship event.
Henning, a 5-foot-8 junior from Racine,
Wis., keyed the Cardinal attack throughout
the NCAA tournament as Stanford won its
first women's basketball national champion
ship.
Stanford's point guard, who is often over
looked because she does not score much,
was left off the all-tournament team despite

scoring 33 points and grabbing 16 rebounds
in the Final Four held in Knoxville, Tenn.
Not that it mattered to Henning. "I didn't
come here to make the all-tournament team.
I came here to win a national champion
ship," she said. "That's what we did."
CBS commentator Mimi Griffin called the
omission a "travesty."

Evans, a 5-6 freshman from Placentia,
Calif., set two American records and was
named the outstanding swimmer at the
NCAA Championships in Austin, Texas.
In the 1650-yard freestyle, the Olympic
gold medalist broke her own American
record by nearly six seconds and won the
race by nearly 25 as she swam a 15:39.14.
Her first event of the meet, the 500 free
style, proved to be nearly as spectacular.
When Evans touched the wall the clock read
4:34.39 â€” almost two seconds faster than

Tracy Caulkins' 11-year-old American
record. Evans won that race by a mere four
and a half seconds.

Bravin, a 5-10 sophomore from Los An
geles, Va., became the school's first-ever na
tional champion at the NCAA Champion
ships in South Bend, Ind.
Fencing brilliantly, Bravin won the men's
foil by defeating Penn State's Edward Muefel
in the final. Along the way, Bravin, who
was seeded sixth, bested Stephen Schroeder
of Wayne State, who is ranked fourth in
the world in foil.
In the round-robin preliminaries, Bravin
did not lose a single bout.
It was a comeback performance for Bravin
after finishing a disappointing fifth in the
event at the Western Regional Champion
ships in early March.
The men's team finished sixth overall
while the women came in ninth.
