Buddie's record evidently did not
command much respect from the
rest of the nation at the NCAA
tournament which took place
March 22-24. At 24-3-1, the junior
was still left unseeded in 167
pound bracket. When it was all
over, however, Buddie had earned
the nation's respect and the title
of All-American with a fourth
place finish.
Buddie, who was was ranked
eleventh in the nation going into
the meet, inexplicably did not
receive one of the twelve seeds
available in his weight class.
"Not being seeded made me
think," Buddie said. "I wondered
if maybe I wasn't as good as my
record indicated, and it (the tour
nament) became a mission for
n
me.
The fourth place finish by
Buddie scored 13 team points for
Stanford and propelled the Car
dinal to a 21st place finish in the
overall team standings. Oklahoma
State won the meet with 117.75
points. Arizona State, who
finished second, was the only

Pacific 10 Conference school in
the top 10.
Going into the tournament,
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel felt
that if Buddie placed it would be
either seventh or eighth.
Horpel's feeling changed after
watching Buddie dismantle Navy's
Ed Dewald in the opening round
of the tournament. Dewald was
the Eastern Interscholastic Wres
tling Association's conference
champion, but Buddie sank the
Midshipman, 15-2.
Horpel was not sure what was
making Buddie wrestle so well.
"It just seemed as though he was
in his element," said Horpel. "He
was like a mechanic going to
work."
Buddie, who posted a 21-match
win streak this season that is the
second longest in Stanford his
tory, kept working. His next
match was perhaps his most im
pressive as he downed the fourth
seed, Robbie Hadden, from Okla
homa State.
Buddie dominated the Big Eight
champion, using his quickness
and technique to build a 10-point
lead in the third period. Then,
with 33 seconds left in the match,
Buddie pinned Hadden.

After the match Buddie said, "I
wanted to wrestle right away so
I wouldn't lose momentum."
Buddie had to wait until the
next morning before he would face
the fifth seed, Bart Chelesvig,
from wrestling power lowa. It was
worth the wait, as Buddie won,
6-5.
"The pace became ferocious at
the end (of the match) and Buddie
just out-toughed him," Coach
Horpel said,
This win guaranteed Buddie a
place in the top eight, which gave
Stanford its first All-American
since Dave Lee placed fifth at 167
pounds in 1986.
In his next match, Buddie was
unable to stop the take downs of
top-ranked and undefeated Dan
St. John of Arizona State. St.
John won 9-2.
Buddie's loss forced a rematch
against Hadden from OSU. This
match was much closer than the
previous encounter. The first pe
riod was even and Buddie forced
the action by shooting for Had
den's leg mid-way through the sec
ond period. Hadden tried to flee
the mat, but Buddie dragged him
back on and used a half-nelson
to pin Hadden for the second time.
