Does God play April Fool's jokes too?
Saturday, March 31. The Stanford women's
gymnastics team competes at the Spartan Invi
tational in San Jose, a tune-up meet before the
regional meet to be held in one week in Los
Angeles. The team scores a 183.45 — low com
pared to the team's season average, but about
what is expected considering that two gymnasts
are sick and another has just gone in for knee
surgery.
Sunday, April 1. Coach Breck Greenwood
receives a call from the NCAA telling him that
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, a team which Stanford
had beaten by over a point in February, has
scored a 188 and overtaken Stanford to earn the
final regional spot. The season is abruptly ended

for the Cardinal and practice is canceled for the
next day.
Monday, April 2. 8:00 p.m. Greenwood recieves
a second call from the NCAA, this time telling
him that some of the judges at Cal Poly-SLO's
final meet were not qualified to judge NCAA
competition. The Mustangs' score is voided,
leaving Stanford with the final qualifying spot.
Talk about complete turnarounds.
"This type of thing has never happened to me
before, so this is new territory," Greenwood said.
"They've been working hard, and they're tired,
so this might be a second wind."
The Cardinal will need something to counter
for the bevy of injuries and illness. Despite the
absences, the squad's score in the meet was good
enough for second place behind Cal State-
Fullerton's 186.65. Host San Jose State was third
with a total of 180.5.
