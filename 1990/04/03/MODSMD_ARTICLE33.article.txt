### David Hirning Editorial staff 
Continuing to make its presence
known in a sport dominated by
East Coast schools, the Stanford
fencing team returned from the
NCAA tournament at Notre Dame
March 24-28 with its first-ever
national champion and a sixth
place finish overall.
Cardinal sophomore Nick
Bravin, a U.S. national and Olym
pic team member, defeated Soviet
Edward Muefel of Penn State to
win the NCAA title in men's foil.
Bravin, a sixth seed in the tour
nament, also knocked off Stephen
Schroeder of Wayne State, who is
the fourth-ranked foil fencer in
the world.
Third-year Stanford coach
Zoran Tulum attributed Bravin's
success to his mental stability, for
fencing is a highly technical sport
requiring great concentration.
"I've had better fencers, but his
attitude was the best of anyone
in the competition," Tulum said.
"Mentally, nobody could beat him.'
Bravin was undefeated in the
tournament, which included both
round-robin and single
elimination competition. Stanford
finished seventh in saber and
sixth in men's foil. Bravin and the
Cardinal's achievements are all
the more impressive because of
the low-profile nature of the fenc
ing program.
"Eighty percent of my team is
from P.E. classes," Tulum said.
"It's like teaching a water-polo
team from non-swimmers."
