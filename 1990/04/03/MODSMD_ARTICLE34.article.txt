# Rebels run away with NCAAs

DENVER (AP) - The
NCAA's ultimate Rebels became
its biggest winners.
UNLV routed Duke 103-73
last night, ending college bas
ketball's tournament of thrills
and close finishes with the lar
gest margin of victory and most
points in a championship game.
Jerry Tarkanian, the coach
who fought the NCAA in the
courts for the past 15 years,
guided UNLV to its first na
tional title while Duke contin
ued as the school with the most
frustrating of postseason
records.
"It was one of those games
you dream about," Tarkanian
said.
The Runnin' Rebels became
the first team to score more
than 100 points in the champi
onship game. They are also the
first preseason No. 1 to win the
title since North Carolina in
1982 and the first Western team
to win since UCLA in 1975.
They did it with the style they

have made famous — tenacious
man-to-man defense — as they
rattled Duke, a team known for
its savvy and poise.
"It was an incredible display
of great basketball by UNLV,"
said Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski. "Their halfcourt
defense is the best in the coun
try and it dictated the whole
basketball game. They were in
control when they had the ball
and when they didn't have the
ball. I think it is the best a team
has played against me as a
coach."
The Runnin' Rebels literally
stole the title from Duke, which
was making its eighth Final
Four appearance. The Blue
Devils went home again without
a trophy, extending the longest
streak of national semifinal
futility.
UNLV broke the tournament
record for steals in a game with
16, eclipsing by three the mark
set by Duke in the 1986 cham
pionship game and matched by

Oklahoma in the 1988 title
game. Both those teams lost,
something it was obvious UNLV
wasn't going to do last night.
"I told the kids it was going
to come down to the last shot
of the game and I just hope that
we take it," Tarkanian said.
But it was never really close.
The Runnin' Rebels also set
a record for most points scored
in a tournament with 571 in six
games, just better than their
regular-season average of 92.3.
Until last night, the largest
margin of victory in a champi
onship game was 23 points,
when UCLA beat North
Carolina 78-55 in 1968. And, un
til last night, the most points
scored in the title game was 98
by UCLA against none other
than Duke in 1964.
For Tarkanian, who looks
pained even when his team wins,
getting the trophy capped a long
battle with the NCAA, which in
1977 ordered the school to
suspend him for violations.
