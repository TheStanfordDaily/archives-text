# Census workers come to campus
## 
### Lara Filson Staff writer 
More than just students have
returned to campus after spring
break â€” Census '90 workers are
here as well.
Yesterday, workers started per
sonally dropping off census forms
to resident fellows, who will dis
tribute the forms to. residents, ac
cording to Gail Guzman, the
Santa Clara County Census Of
fice's assistant manager of field
operations.
The workers will come back
later in the week to collect the
forms and ensure that they have
been filled out correctly.
Accurately counting students
living on college campuses is one
of the new special operations of
the U.S. Census Bureau, accord
ing to Ed Morillo, who recruits
census workers.
In previous censuses, forms
were bulk mailed to students, an
inaccurate operation because
some people were missed, said
Jason Wilder, a special operations
supervisor in Berkeley.

In January, census workers
came to campus to determine
which living quarters would need
to have forms distributed person
ally.
Workers will come back to help
students who have not filled out
their forms correctly, Guzman
said. This is standard census pro
cedure.
All information obtained
through the census is confidential.
Although completed forms were
due April 1, some people still have
not received them because of
mailing delays, according to Carol
Huboi, a census worker.
There is therefore no stringent
deadline, and census officials ex
pect to still be accepting forms
through the end of the month.
Six out of every seven people
will receive a short form with 12
questions. The others will receive
a longer form with 44 questions.
Everyone is required by law to
fill out the forms, and there is a
fine for not complying.
Students are encouraged to vol
unteer in helping assure that tar
geted minority communities in

the area return their forms, said
Morillo, who made several presen
tations on campus last quarter to
student of color organizations.
Morillo noted that since public
schools receive their funding
based on official population sta
tistics, schools in traditionally un
derrepresented communities
stand to gain about $4,000 in tax
revenues over the next 10 years
for each additional person counted
in the census.
He also mentioned the signifi
cance of the census in political
representation, which is deter
mined by population.
Although a lot of the paid work
went on during spring break, jobs
are still available for students who
wish to work for Census '90.
Census operations will continue
through the fall.
Students who have questions
while filling out the forms can
call the Santa Clara County
Census Office at (800) 999-1990.
Those who did not get forms can
call (408) 748-2838. People inter
ested in working or volunteering
can call (408) 748-2804.
