# Inventor of Aerobie works with corners

The inventor of a ring that can
be thrown far away has now come
up with a triangle that comes
back.
Alan Adler, a lecturer in me
chanical engineering and a self
taught aerodynamicist, is known
to toy buffs as the creator of the
Aerobie Flying Ring, a high-tech
rival of the Frisbee. The Flying
Ring was once tossed nearly one
quarter mile by a mere mortal —
a world record.
However, the toy that first
caught Adler's eye back in the
mid-1970s was the common
Australian boomerang. If the
Frisbee flew too meekly, the
boomerang flew too ferociously.
"The old wood ones were kind
of mean," said Adler, referring to
heavy boomerangs that come
whipping back to the defenseless
thrower and can wound on im
pact.
"I wanted something easier to
throw . . . something nicer and
safer," Adler said. But in the
19705, the soft materials required
for such a safe product did not
yet exist.
So for the next decade Adler
turned his attention to refining
the Frisbee and has since sold
millions of his Flying Rings to an
international market.
In the process of developing the
Flying Ring, Adler invented the
"soft rubber edge construction"

that eases the pain on the
catcher's hand. Armed with the
new technology, he returned to
the problem of kamikaze
boomerangs last year.
After about six months of
design work, Adler unveiled a hol
low soft rubber triangle called the
Aerobie Orbiter, which weighs
about half as much as a conven
tional boomerang.
With a relatively soft throw, the
Orbiter will loop a circle of 90 to
100 feet in diameter around the
thrower and then — usually —
drop politely back into his or her
hands.
According to Adler, the Orbiter
flies better than its competitors
because of an unorthodox "trail
ing edge flap" at each wingtip,
which directs the flow of air over
the majority of the orbiter's wing
and gives it low aerodynamic drag.
A patent is pending.
Along with its soft rubber
edges, the Orbiter contains a
flexible polycarbonate backbone
that absorbs most of the energy
of impact when it is caught. Also,
it can be safely snagged by poking
a hand through its hollow center.

According to Lois Kleinkauf, a
buyer for the Stanford Bookstore,
the first 96 Orbiters, carrying
$8.95 pricetags, were put on the
racks in mid-January and sold out
by Valentine's Day, a faster pace
than she had expected.
Kleinkauf noted the Orbiter is
actually outselling the popular
Flying Ring by about two to one,
a fact she attributed to the tri
angle's novelty.
Adler does not expect it to out

sell the Flying Ring in the long
run, because "more skill and more
space" is required to play with
the Orbiter.
In terms of performance on the
playing field, Adler claims to have
once made 75 consecutive catches
of the thing.
Adler warns against throwing
the Orbiter in winds of more than
six miles per hour or in confined
spaces, and he does not recom
mend the toy for children under

the age of 13.
As another consideration, the
Orbiter is designed to be launched
from the right hand, since the
flaps cause it to always rotate to
the left. Left-handers have to
master a trickier across-the-chest
backhand throw to use it.
Adler does not have any future
flying inventions in the works at
the moment. He said, "From time
to time, I do the best I can with
a particular goal in mind."
