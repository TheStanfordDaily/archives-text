# Employees get more control over pensions
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Glasnost has finally come to the col
lege retirement world, as an $84 billion
pension fund company has opened the
door for Stanford faculty and staff
members to have more control and
responsibility over their pension plans.
The Teachers Insurance and An
nuity Association and College Retire
ment Equities Fund — long criticized
for paternalism in its control of the
college retirement-fund market — has
officially given up control of pension
funds to individual universities. And
major changes are due in pension sys
tems for college faculty and staff
throughout the nation.

The result leaves
John Schwartz, the
University's chief legal
officer, with a strong
sense of moral and le
gal justice. Schwartz
spearheaded a two
year legal battle with
TIAA-CREF in"the
interest of our em
ployees."

Meanwhile, a University task force
is "very close" to making its recom
mendations to Provost James Rosse
about changes to Stanford's current
pension system, according to chair
John Shoven, professor of economics.
Last month, TIAA-CREF began al
lowing pension-holders the option of

transferring their pension accumula
tions to funds offered by rival invest
ment firms.
At issue is who should decide how
individual retirement funds are man
aged and what the role of a university
is in helping investors manage their
investment funds.
Previously, TIAA-CREF had exer
cised a great deal of control over these
retirement funds, prohibiting inves
tors from taking their funds elsewhere
and limiting investors from transfer
ring their funds within the TIAA and
CREF companies.
That is precisely what Schwartz and
University President Donald Kennedy
objected to. "Why shouldn't I have a
right as a pension-holder to decide how

to manage my funds?" Schwartz asked
in an interview. "We thought [TIAA
CREF] was wrong . . . and we have a
strong interest in our employees and
that they have strong and flexible in
vestment choices."
Under the new policies, which went
into effect last month, TIAA-CREF's
policyholders will be allowed to trans
fer their funds to other firms, but
only if their universities allow such
transfers. Each institution currently
offering TIAA-CREF pension plans
will need to decide how individuals
will be allowed to transfer their funds.

ident for human resources at DePaul
