# Employees get more control over pensions
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Glasnost has finally come to the col
lege retirement world, as an $84 billion
pension fund company has opened the
door for Stanford faculty and staff
members to have more control and
responsibility over their pension plans.
The Teachers Insurance and An
nuity Association and College Retire
ment Equities Fund — long criticized
for paternalism in its control of the
college retirement-fund market — has
officially given up control of pension
funds to individual universities. And
major changes are due in pension sys
tems for college faculty and staff
throughout the nation.

The result leaves
John Schwartz, the
University's chief legal
officer, with a strong
sense of moral and le
gal justice. Schwartz
spearheaded a two
year legal battle with
TIAA-CREF in"the
interest of our em
ployees."

Meanwhile, a University task force
is "very close" to making its recom
mendations to Provost James Rosse
about changes to Stanford's current
pension system, according to chair
John Shoven, professor of economics.
Last month, TIAA-CREF began al
lowing pension-holders the option of

transferring their pension accumula
tions to funds offered by rival invest
ment firms.
At issue is who should decide how
individual retirement funds are man
aged and what the role of a university
is in helping investors manage their
investment funds.
Previously, TIAA-CREF had exer
cised a great deal of control over these
retirement funds, prohibiting inves
tors from taking their funds elsewhere
and limiting investors from transfer
ring their funds within the TIAA and
CREF companies.
That is precisely what Schwartz and
University President Donald Kennedy
objected to. "Why shouldn't I have a
right as a pension-holder to decide how

to manage my funds?" Schwartz asked
in an interview. "We thought [TIAA
CREF] was wrong . . . and we have a
strong interest in our employees and
that they have strong and flexible in
vestment choices."
Under the new policies, which went
into effect last month, TIAA-CREF's
policyholders will be allowed to trans
fer their funds to other firms, but
only if their universities allow such
transfers. Each institution currently
offering TIAA-CREF pension plans
will need to decide how individuals
will be allowed to transfer their funds.
According to Joyce Fecske, vice pres
ident for human resources at DePaul


Schwartz
University in Chicago, the aca
demic world is experiencing a
trend toward laissez-faire eco
nomics, in which there is a good
deal of faith in the efficiency of
the marketplace.
This attitude goes against the
paternalistic philosophy of the
TIAA-CREF companies, which
owe their origins to an attempt
by Andrew Carnegie to create a
pension system for college profes
sors.
According to Rosse, Stanford's
legal battle with TIAA-CREF was
based on "the initiative of
[Schwartz] with the support of
the rest of the University." Al
though the effects have been

"quite neutral for the University,"
according to Rosse, they have been
"beneficial for faculty wanting
more control" in managing their
funds.
Task force moves ahead
The task force investigating
changes in the pension system has
been at work for almost a year,
said Shoven, "to make sure that
the current pension system is ad
equate and that faculty and staff
can afford to retire." The task
force is now preparing to make
its recommendations to Rosse,
who will then announce the final
recommendations to the Stanford
community.
Shoven emphasized that the
plan is not part of the University's
current budget-cutting measures
and that the recommendations are
not intended to save money.

Although reluctant to discuss
specific details of a new pension
plan, Shoven said two important
factors will be considered. The
first is a lifting of the mandatory
retirement age of 70, and the sec
ond is a tightening of Stanford's
legal environment.
Included in the task force's rec
ommendations will be the ability
to transfer funds to different in
vestment companies, such as
Fidelity and Vanguard.
Compared to five or six years
ago, Shoven said, there now is "a
much greater satisfaction on the
part of faculty and staff." He cited
increased responsiveness by
TIAA-CREF, as well as the pos
sibility of transferring funds to
other companies, as major reasons
for the attitude shift.
DePaul's Fecske said it was only
natural for people to feel more

comfortable when they have a
choice about their investment
plans and compared the availabil
ity of such choices to that of griev
ance procedures.
However, she said that because
many faculty members are un
aware of different options for pen
sion plans, "something might be
done to improve the level of in
formation."
'Irresponsible' use of funds?
Meanwhile, faculty and admin
istrators at other universities
have different views on the sig
nificance of the new options al
lowed by TIAA-CREF.
Roy Schotland, a Georgetown
University law professor who
played a large part in initiating
the opposition to TIAA-CREF's
policies six years ago, warned that
it would be "irresponsible" of

Stanford to "allow people to use
Fidelity and Vanguard funds" be
cause they carry a higher risk
than those placed in TIAA-CREF.
While applauding the policy
changes by TIAA-CREF, Schot
land said a greater number of
choices "means that a university
has to be sober and responsible"
and not "play risky games with
people's retirement funds."
He said Georgetown places cer
tain restrictions on access to these
retirement funds.
Schwartz defended the other in
vestment vehicles as being "fine
companies" and denied that there
is any potential increase in risk
in dealing with them.
However, Fecske disagreed with
Schwartz and compared the
changes to opening a Pandora's
box. Before offering alternatives
to TIAA-CREF, she said, univer

sities should make certain of how
these companies consolidate funds
for individuals at retirement.
For example, within the Fidelity
company, said Fecske, there are
about five "safe funds" and many
that are not safe, such as those
investing in the gold market.
She said that "Stanford is say
ing that the employee is respon
sible for his own financial secu
rity, while others think that an
institution owes its employees
some degree of security."
Besides not allowing lump-sum
cash withdrawals, Schwartz said,
Stanford's current policies place
no restrictions on where employ
ees may invest their funds. "You
have to give a certain amount of
credit to people who have been
saving for 20 or 30 years that
they know what to do with their
money," he said.
