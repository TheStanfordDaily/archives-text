# Scientific journals become too expensive for libraries
## 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
Biological Sciences Prof. David Epel, a
prominent marine biologist, was once able
to walk over to the Falconer Library in
the biology building when he wanted to
consult an article in the scientific journal
"Marine Biology." He can't do that any
more.
"Marine Biology" is one of a growing
number of journals being cut from Uni
versity libraries because of rising costs.
The publication, which costs more than
$1,100 per year, is no longer available on
the Stanford campus. Every time Epel
needs to take a glance at an article in the
journal, he must go to his other office by
the crashing waves of Monterey Bay at
Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station.
Epel is one of many Stanford researchers
who have been repeatedly inconvenienced
in their research efforts over the past few
years. The University libraries have been
slashing hundreds of scientific journal sub
scriptions, many of them of high cost and
low quality.
According to Michael Ryan, assistant di
rector of collections for University libraries,
in the past two years Stanford has cut
nearly 700 titles, and more cutbacks are
possible this year. He said the prices of
these journals "range from the sublime to
the ridiculous," citing $30 as a sublime
and $5,000 as a ridiculous one-year sub
scription price.
For example, "Nuclear Engineering" cost
$2,027 for a one-year subscription in 1988.
"Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dy
namics" cost $2,196 in 1989. The Univer

sity dropped both journals.
The increase in prices is largely based
on the rising importance of commercial
publishers in the scientific journal market.
Whereas scientific societies can charge little
more than cost for their journals, commer
cial publishers see immense opportunities
for profit in what Ryan called "basically a
captive market," namely libraries.
Rising costs present libraries with a se
vere dilemma: professors are demanding
journals for research purposes, but the li
braries cannot afford to subscribe to them
all.
When the price of one commercial jounal,
"Applied Surface Science," skyrocketed
from $755 to $1,005 for a one-year sub
scription, the University had the choice to
either eliminate or capitulate.
Joe Wible, Steve Gass and Henry Lowood
— head librarians at the biology, engineer
ing and physics libraries, respectively —
all agreed that the cutbacks have been
significant. Each said his library has spent
more money on publications over the past
two years, while they have had to cut as
many as 10 percent of their titles.
The librarians follow different strategies
in determining what should be cut. Wible
said he has targeted the more expensive
titles and cut other titles, such as "Marine
Biology," that were duplicated at Hopkins
and are readily available bv mail or fax.
He also keeps track of the number of
times certain journals are cited in faculty
papers, the number of times Stanford fac
ulty publish in those journals, and the
number of times journals are reshelved at
the library. Those with the least use by
faculty are easily targeted for cuts.

the science journals that have been cut because of a rise in subscrip
tion rates. Each subscription costs more than $2,000 per year.
