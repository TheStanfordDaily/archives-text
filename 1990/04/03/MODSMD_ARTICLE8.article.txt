# Stanford's United Way donations increase

Stanford employees contributed
$153,400 — up a healthy 18 per
cent from the previous year —
through United Way during 1989.
The total contribution from
Stanford during 1989 exceeded
that of any previous year. How
ever, less than 6 percent of the
University's staff participated, a
decrease from 1988, when 894 em
ployees donated a total of
$130,265. In 1989, there were 869
givers.
"We're very pleased about the
increase in contributions, espe
cially the fact that individual gifts
were larger than in past years,"

said campaign chair Alberta
Siegel, a professor of psychology
in the School of Medicine. "But
there is still a strikingly low level
of overall employee participation
— we still have a lot of people to
reach."
Seven employees, up one from
the previous year, donated more
than $1,000 each in 1989. Siegel
hailed these givers as the "pillars"
of the campaign.
An estimated 15,000 employees
of the University, Stanford Hospi
tal and the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center are eligible to en
roll in the voluntary payroll
deduction plan as an automatic
contribution to United Way. In

addition to the $153,000 total,
employees donated $500 to spe
cific agencies, some not affiliated
with United Way.
As an institution, Stanford also
channeled $100,000 through
United Way for earthquake relief
from proceeds of the 49ers-
Patriots National Football League
game held at Stanford Stadium
in October.
University President Donald
Kennedy commissioned a study
last spring to examine and revise
the United Way campaign. The
study recommended an increase
in the amount and quality of in
formation provided to Stanford
employees, in order to help the

staff make more informed deci
sions about giving options
through United Way.
Three campus-wide United Way
activities — two open house ses
sions and the screening of a film
about United Way — were held
in response to the study's recom
mendations.
The restructured campaign
yielded results that indicate po
tential for success in the future,
according to Siegel.
An evaluation committee will
convene later this quarter to ex
amine the results of the recent
campaign and make recommenda
tions for the future.
