# Creative camping
## More than 100 seek admittance to popular class 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
One of the most popular late
night spots on campus this
week was not on the Row —
it was in the English Depart
ment, where more than 100
students camped out Monday
night hoping to snag a place
in one of the ever-popular Fic
tion Writing classes.
Although the Creative Writ
ing office did not open for sign
ups until 8 a.m. yesterday
morning, students began
staking their claims to the pre
cious line spaces along the
Quad as early as 1 p.m. the
previous afternoon.
"We knew it was crazy, but
we wanted to be first," said
sophomore Juliette Tanner, the
first in the line, as she lay
cozily on the floor in front of
the Creative Writing office
door.
"All in all, I'm just glad I
got to be inside," she said.
Although many of the stu
dents around her passed the
hours in slumber, Tanner used
much of her 19-hour wait to
do a little reading, work on
some embroidery and balance
her checkbook. To ensure a
good night's sleep, she even
brought a new pair of earplugs
to drown out the noise from
televisions and radios behind
her in the line.
Things were not quite so
comfortable for the more than
70 students who spent a brisk

More than 100 students camp outside the English Department Monday night with
hopes of landing a spot in a Fiction Writing class.
night on the tiles along the Quad
in a line that stretched from
Building 50 to Building 30. Many
hopefuls occupied themselves
with card games, backrubs and a
few warming beverages.
"I was hoping for the Inner
Quad at least," said sophomore
Tom Borthwick, who, arriving
shortly after 11 p.m., found him
self at the end of a line of nearly
80 students.
Although Borthwick and many
others behind him decided to stick
it out, they were disappointed
when the office opened yesterday
morning. The last space in the
class went to a student who ar
rived at 10 p.m., leaving more
than half of the overnight camp
ers only with spaces on a long

wait list.
This bizarre notion of camping
out for Fiction Writing began
three years ago when a popular
visiting professor prompted
several students to arrive at the
office early in the morning to en
sure a space in his section. Since
then, it has exploded into a nec
essary activity to enroll in any
section of the class.
"This is awful — it's the worst
I've ever seen it," said Gay Pierce,
coordinator of the Creative Writ
ing program, as she opened the
doors to the maze of tired stu
dents.
"Every time we say there must
be a better way," she said. "We
need a creative solution."
Despite the obvious popularity
of the class, Pierce said that recent
budget cuts have made it impos
sible for the English Department
to offer more than five sections
of fifteen people each.
