# Bigger Bookstore on December horizon
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
While the University adminis
tration seeks to shrink the mag
nitude of its operations, the
Bookstore is expanding enor
mously.
According to current construc
tion plans, by the end of Decem
ber the Bookstore will be
utilizing its two basement floors
to become the largest college
bookstore in the country, carry
ing 225,000 titles, said General
Manager Eldon Speed.
The project will cost about $3
million to the Bookstore, a non

profit organization independent
of the University.
In the new Bookstore, the
lower basement floor will carry
course books and other academic
books, and the upper basement
floor will contain academic books
and Microdisc.
The ground floor will house
general books and the cash reg
isters, all of which will be moved
to the left wall to avoid the Book
store's current "supermarket"
look, Speed said.
On the mezzanine level, shop
pers will find "soft goods" —
such as Stanford paraphernalia
and school supplies — and a cafe

serving coffee and candy.
Speed said he hopes the cafe
will become a "social gathering
spot" on campus.
According to Speed, the pur
pose of the expansion is simply
"to serve the community better,"
in response to student and fac
ulty requests to add more book
space.
The basement floors had been
used as storage space for incom
ing shipments. The Bookstore
will move this operation to an
other location in Newark, a city
in the East Bay about 15 miles
away.
Construction in the basement

has been carried on since the
beginning of the school year, and
it has caused occasional incon
venience to shoppers.
When work on the floors above
ground begins in June, it will
have a much greater impact on
book buyers, according to Speed.
However, the Bookstore has
planned the construction around
the beginnings of quarters, when
students are purchasing their
textbooks, Speed said.
Along with the new construc
tion, the Bookstore will sport a
new look, with California red
wood finishing on the walls and
gray granite floors.
