Tales of spring break often focus on
the lush and exotic, but for 14 Stanford
students "vacation" consisted of a 20-
hour drive to spend a week cleaning up
schoolyards at the Zuni Indian Reserva
tion in New Mexico.
Despite sleeping on a hard, cold
linoleum floor in two cramped trailers
and fighting for two barely functional
toilets and showers, the participants re
turned to Palo Alto believing that their
experience equaled, or surpassed, any
other student's spring break.
"The week before (we left) people asked
what I was doing for spring break, and

I surprised them when I said I was going
to an Indian reservation," freshman
Kristy Stromberg said. "Without a doubt,
I am pleased that I gained a lot of dif
ferent perspectives and saw a lot of things
I would never have seen."
The students split their time between
performing public service and learning
about the Zuni culture.
To the disappointment of many of the
Stanford participants, the majority of the
public service consisted of cautiously
picking up broken beer bottles and franti
cally chasing gum wrappers across school
yards. The previous year the participants
built playground equipment and dug an
irrigation ditch at the local high school.
However, because of some disorganiza
tion and miscommunication on the part
of Zuni administrators, this year students
found themselves performing last

minute, menial tasks.
"It was unfortunate that we had to
spend so much time on a task that would
not be very evident after a couple of
weeks," student coordinator Anne
Blanche Adams said. "But 1 did have the
opportunity to talk with the school ad
ministrators so that they understood we
would prefer a more lasting project for
future spring breaks."
Upon arrival, the students got ac
quainted with the community residents.
"I couldn't believe (at first) that these
people could survive in some of the
houses," Stromberg said, referring to the
extreme poverty of the community. "As
the week went on and I saw the happy
children and smiling adults, I understood
how you could live there."
A few of the students had the oppor
tunity to help Zuni senior citizens cook

sourdough bread in their round, red clay
ovens and to make tamales which the
senior citizens sold to the community.
Others spent a day with the Zuni Ar
chaeological Project mapping out, search
ing for and recording the artifacts that
they found.
Activities such as these enabled the
students to overcome their initial inhibi
tions toward an unfamiliar culture.
"Zuni people may appear shy, silent,
quiet and somewhat distanced from you
at first," Adams said. "But once they
strike up a conversation for the first
time, you realize how willing they are to
let you know about their culture."
The participants were fortunate to be
some of the few outsiders to attend a
Zuni tribal dance. Photographs of the
religious event have been strictly prohib
ited for years, so the students had to

imprint the images of nearly 50 dancers,
colorfully dressed with mallard duck
heads and coyote skins, into their mem
ories.
"The American culture is so accessi
ble," senior Lyn Fairchild said. "In com
parison, the Zuni are not trying to display
their culture everywhere. When I was at
the dance, I felt I had an insight into
something beautiful, ancient, preserved."
The students also visited two ruin sites.
The original Zuni village, which wit
nessed the arrival of Coronado, had been
excavated so that the walls of former
houses were above the ground. The sec
ond site had not yet been excavated, and
the students found numerous pieces of
ancient pottery from different ages.
On the final morning, the students
climbed Dowa Yalane, a sacred Zuni
mountain.
