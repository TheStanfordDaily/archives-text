# Senate passes clean air legislation

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate
overwhelmingly approved sweeping air
pollution controls on automobiles, fac
tories and power plants yesterday after
a decade of struggle over whether to
strengthen federal clean air laws.
The new controls, which are esti
mated to cost the economy $21 billion
a year when they go fully into effect,
were approved by a vote of 89-11.
President Bush, speaking in In
dianapolis in advance of Senate action,
called it "a historic vote" that would
"affect generations to come as we work
to build a cleaner, safer America."

After the vote, presidential spokes
man Marlin Fitzwater said, "We're
pleased and we'll work for passage in
the House."
Senate approval shifted the clean air
debate to the House where a similar
bill is being written by the Energy and
Commerce Committee. Rep. John Din
gell, D-Mich., the panel's chairman,
said he plans to have the committee
vote by week's end and expects floor
action next month.
Differences in the Senate and House
measures will then still have to be
worked out.

Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, acknowledged the
new requirements would be expensive
to industry, but argued "the costs of
inaction will be higher than the cost
of this bill." Health experts have es
timated air pollution may account for
50,000 premature deaths every year,
he said.
"We can no longer delay," said
Mitchell, who has sought federal con
trols on acid rain for nearly a decade
and made the clean air bill his top
priority as Democratic leader.
