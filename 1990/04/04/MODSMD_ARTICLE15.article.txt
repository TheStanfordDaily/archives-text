# Marcos to call Bush as witness
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Imelda Marcos'
attorney contended yesterday that
George Bush urged her husband to
invest in U.S. real estate and that the
CIA "was aware of every transaction"
for which she is on trial on racketeer
ing charges.
In opening arguments, defense at
torney Gerald Spence also said he
plans to call Bush as a witness.
The lawyer said that Bush, then the
vice president, was concerned about
the Marcoses negotiating an oil deal
with Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy
and suggested to Marcos during a 1981
meeting in Manila, "Why don't you
invest in American properties?"
The Marcoses, "who saw themselves
as children of America," took the ad
vice, Spence said. "They abandoned
any further attempt to invest in Libya
and began to put their money into
New York real estate."
In Washington, White House spokes
man Steve Hart had no immediate
comment on the attorney's statements.
Earlier in the day, a prosecutor
portrayed Mrs. Marcos as an uncon
trolled spender who treated the Philip
pine National Bank as her "personal
piggy bank." The former Philippines
first lady and her late husband, Fer
dinand, were named in the 1988 in
dictment that charged them with steal
ing millions of dollars from their
homeland's treasury to buy Manhat
tan real estate, jewelry and art. Marcos
died in exile in Hawaii last September.
On trial with Mrs. Marcos is Saudi
arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi.
Spence said Marcos was warned by
the CIA that he might not have enough
money to marshal a force to recapture
the Philippines if it was taken over by
the Communist insurgency.
Without going into specifics, Spence
claimed that the CIA was worried that
the Philippines would fall to the Com
munists as Cuba had been taken over
by Fidel Castro.
