Jury sequestered
WASHINGTON (AP) - The judge
in John Poindexter's trial disclosed
yesterday that two jurors had been
contacted by the news media and he
ordered the jury sequestered to avoid
further problems from such "ir
responsible behavior."
U.S. District Court Judge Harold
Greene said both jurors will remain
on the panel because they "were alert
and intelligent and didn't allow" any
conversation about the case to take
place.

Debt hits $3 trillion
WASHINGTON (AP) - The na
tional debt on Monday totaled more
than $3 trillion for the first time in
history, the Treasury Department re
ported yesterday.
That's $3,000,000,000,000. Count
them: a three and 12 zeroes.
A person counting a $1,000 bill
each second would take 133 years
just to reach $1 trillion.
Labor fines climb
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fines
against fast-food restaurants and
other businesses are climbing toward
the $3 million mark for thousands

of child labor law violations uncov
ered in a three-day federal sweep,
officials said yesterday.
One businessman called the effort
by the Labor Department "nitpick
ing" and a "crusade." But spokes
woman Johanna Schneider said the
department's "responsibility is to en
force the letter of the law."
Aid package approved
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House yesterday approved a $2.4 bil
lion spending bill that includes
money President Bush is urgently
seeking for new democracies in
Panama and Nicaragua.
The bill, with $720 million for the
two Central American nations, would
mark the first use of a "peace divi
dend" from reduced Pentagon spend
ing. It still needed Senate action.

which appeared unlikely by the
Thursday deadline Bush had set for
completion of the measure.
Lawmakers approved the bill on a
vote of 362-59 after defeating a series
of amendments that would have cut
foreign aid amounts in the bill. Those
amendments brought caustic reac
tions from the bill's supporters.
