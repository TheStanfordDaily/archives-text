SPRING HAS COME and the
free speech issue is in the air.
The Student Conduct
Legislative Council has finally
made a definitive statement on the
issue of the compatibility of the
Fundamental Standard with the
First Amendment of the U.S. Con
stitution.
The SCLC recently accepted the
so-called Grey proposal offered in
December by Law Prof. Tom Grey.
This interpretation makes certain
speech punishable by the Univer
sity's Fundamental Standard.
This includes any speech that is
intended to insult or stigmatize on
the basis of a person's sex, race,
color, handicap, religion, sexual
orientation or national or ethnic
origin; is addressed directly to the
individual or individuals whom it
insults or stigmatizes; and makes
use of insulting or "fighting

words" or non-verbal symbols.
Although the SCLC has voted
for the proposal, it is beginning a
one-month community comment
period today. The committee asks
everyone in the community, par
ticularly students, to write in their
comments to the committee.
This issue has been one that has
commanded little attention from
students in the last few months as
demonstrated by the lack of inter
est in the SCLC. Even though
voters will get to vote for three
candidates for the SCLC in the
upcoming ASSU elections, only
two people filed to run for those
spots.
Few campus issues are more im
portant than this one. In the spirit
of free speech, everyone is encour
aged to lose the shell of apathy
that has sometimes characterized
this issue.
