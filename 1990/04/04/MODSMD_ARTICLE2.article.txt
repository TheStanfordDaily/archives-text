# SCLC offers revised reading of Standard
## Interpretation attempts to define harassment 
### Robert L. Jamieson, Jr 
Beginning today, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council is seeking comment on
its latest proposed interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard. The proposal
defines when discriminatory verbal or non
verbal abuse violates the student conduct
code.
The SCLC's proposal, approved by the
council March 14 by a 9-2 vote, holds that
speech or other expression constitutes har
assment by satisfying three explicit condi
tions:
• It is "intended to insult or stigmatize
an individual or a small number of indi
viduals on the basis of their sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation or na
tional and ethnic origin,
• "It is addressed directly to the individ
ual or individuals whom it insults or stig
matizes, and
• "It makes use of insulting or 'fighting
words' or non-verbal symbols."
The proposal's full text appears on page
14 of today's Daily
Students, faculty and staff have until
May 4 to comment on the proposal, which
will then go back to the council for more
consideration.
The SCLC initiative comes on the heels
of last year's two failed attempts to inter
pret the Standard in terms of racially and
sexually discriminatory behavior. Interpre
tation of the Standard was prompted by
two incidents of sexual and racial harass
ment in 1988 — one in which a freshman
verbally abused a gay resident assistant
and another in which two students defaced
a poster in a racially offensive manner at
Ujamaa House.
Last year's two SCLC proposals drew
overwhelmingly negative public criticism,
including complaints that the proposals in
fringed upon First Amendment rights.
However, Law Prof. Robert Rabin, SCLC
chair, said the new proposal overcomes the
problems of its predecessors.
The specificity of the proposal ensures
that speech which may be offensive is
"statistically minute," he said.

"This is not a restriction
on people's beliefs — no
matter how odious they
may be. It is meant merely
to restrict action in fur
therance of those beliefs
that harass specified indi
viduals or small groups of
individuals," Rabin said.
More importantly, Rabin
said, the new proposal

reflects a deep commitment to maintaining
conditions of communal decency at Stan
ford.
"It strikes me," he said, "that the Fun
damental Standard is an attempt to create
certain minimal obligations of decency in
the Stanford community.
"The [SCLC interpretation] is a more
specified way of saying what those mini
mum decent standards are," he added.
Agreeing with Rabin, SCLC student
member Ravi Bellur called "an over-broad
Fundamental Standard" dangerous and
argued that the new proposal is "doing a
service by showing what speech actually
constitutes harassment."
"If people want to be neo-Nazis, that's
fine. They can march or convene. But they
better realize the possible consequences if
they decide to funnel their complete and
utter hatred at a particular group or indi
viduals," he said.
In spirit, the SCLC proposal seeks to
thaw the chilling effect generated by the
uncertainty students face, not knowing
whether their speech falls under the cloak
of discriminatory harassment or intellec
tual discourse, Rabin said.
But the SCLC proposal is not without
its problems, say some.
Perry Friedman, a SCLC student mem
ber, opposed the council's reasoning and
decision on numerous grounds.
"The burden of proof is very difficult,"
he said. "[And] it's not going to stop rac
ism."
Friedman said that one clause of the
new proposal, in particular, was problem-
