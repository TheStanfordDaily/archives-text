Students First needs to clarify its stances on issues

CONSERVATIVE STUDENTS at
this university have long stated
that there is no forum through
which to express their political views.
They have called upon the members of
this community to strive toward creat
ing an atmostphere which is conducive
to the open discussion of all .optical
viewpoints.
However, hidden by the
centrist position of the Students First
Party, several conservative members of
the ASSU Senate have been working
not toward creating an open dialogue,
but rather toward silencing those of
differing political views.
Students First claims to be dedicated
toward making student concerns the
top priority of the ASSU. In the past,

it has campaigned on the platform that
the ASSU should focus its attention on
issues 3uch as Big Game Bonfire or
filling Lake Lagunita.
Yet, it seems that certain Students
First Senators have a lot more in mind
then just ensuring that students will be
able to windsurf in the spring.
Autumn quarter, Enrique Origgi and
Students First senators John Abbott
and Kevin Warsh led a campaign
within the senate to cut ASSU funding
to the Stanford Central America Action
Network and the Stanford Democratic
Socialists of America claiming that the
two groups were "too political" to
receive funding.
At the end of last quarter, Graduate

Senator Peter Thiel, with the support
of several Students First senators,
argued that the ASSU should withhold
funding to the Stanford Pro-Choice
Alliance.
Such actions raise several questions.
First, does it not seem contradictory
to call for a more open dialogue so
that conservative views can be heard
and then to work toward silencing
those who do not agree with such
views?
Second, Students First claims to be
working toward making students con
cerns the top priority of the ASSU, yet
at the same time certain members of
that party are attempting to cut the
funding of three student groups.

Which students and what issues are
Students First members really con
cerned with? Do the members of the
Students First Party believe that the
women of this University are more
concerned with filling Lake Lag than
they are with fighting to maintain
control of their bodies?
As the ASSU elections draw near, 1
urge the Students First Party to
publicly clarify its goals and I call
upon my fellow students to seriously
consider the implications of an ASSU
Senate controlled by the supposedly
politically neutral Students First Party
