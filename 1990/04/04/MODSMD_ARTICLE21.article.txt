# Black fraternities play crucial role in community
## 
### 
As a proud member of an African-
American fraternity, I found Eric Mik
kelson's statement that "the most bla
tant . . . racist student organizations on
campus are black fraternities and so
rorities ..." to be ludicruous.
African-American fraternities and
sororities were established nearly a
century ago to serve our community as
service-oriented and social organiza
tions. At that time, African-Americans
were not permitted to join the white
groups. The African-American fraternal
and sororal groups at Stanford are
composed of a diverse body of people
who display interest in a variety of
aspects of the Stanford community.
African-American fraternal and
sororal groups have played an integral
role in black society. It is extremely

arrogant to assume that we should
abandon our institutions so that we
may "integrate" into the now
liberalized mainstream groups.
Whites are not discouraged from
joining African-American fraternal and
sororal organizations. African-American
fraternities and sororities have been
interracial since the mid-19405.
Becoming a member does require an
appreciation of African-Amprican cul
ture and history. But most whites have
little knowledge of our fraternal and
sororal groups and African-American
culture as a whole.
Sadly, this ignorance is acceptable
for many white people, whereas an
African-American cannot afford to be
ignorant of white culture without risk
of being labeled socially dysfunctional.
Also, it is far more likely that a white
member of a black fratemal/sororal
organiztion will gain wide acceptance
by group members on a nationwide
level than a black person in a white
organization.
In closing, Martin Luther King Jr.,
who was himself a member of an

African-American fraternity, never con
sidered skin color "irrelevant" as Mik
kelson asserts. King believed that black
skin, or skin of any other hue, should
not be a hindrance in obtaining the
"American Dream."
And for African-Americans, that
dream does not include burying our
cultural institutions.
