# Graduation speaker has impressive, inspiring message
## 
### 
Last December I was privileged to
hear well-known children's advocate
Marian Wright Edelman speak at a
National Association of Countries Con
ference in Charlotte, N.C. Edelman
received a standing ovation at the end
of her speech. I have heard a myriad
of speakers all over the country; never

have I been more impressed or moved
As a local elected official I am
acutely aware, as we enter the last
decade of the century, that this coun
try is in crisis whether we wish to
recognize that fact or not. Edelman
addresses the realities of our society
and paints a frightening future if we
do not acknowledge the message she
gives us.
As the parents of a 1990 graduate,
my husband and I would be at gradua
tion no matter who was selected to
give the Commencement address.
Knowing that Edelman has been cho
sen to do so is a very special added
bonus. All those in attendence will
leave knowing they have heard a dedi
cated woman give an inspiring and
challenging message.
I am very excited to know that my
family will have the opportunity to
hear her. She is truly a woman of
valor.
