## Respect different cultures 
### 
LET'S FACE IT, multiculturalism is
not working too well at Stanford.
Sure, Stanford has a racially di
verse student body which it doesn't mind
bragging about every chance it gets. But
despite all the colored folks at Stanford,
there ain't too much interaction going on.
One look at the dining halls will tell
you that. The white people eat in one
section, and the black people eat in an
other, with the Asians and
Chicanos/Latinos sprinkled somewhere in
the middle. If you went into the Lagunita
Court dining hall, you'd think you
stepped back into the 1960s and the days
of segregation.
But who's to blame? White people?
Black people? Many white people's per
ceptions of people of color on this campus
are shaped by stereotypes. For example,
whites view blacks as militant, separatist
and hostile, and they use such views as
an excuse not to interact with blacks.
While there are certainly some blacks
who fit the above description, I think
most blacks support multiculturalism.
Unfortunately, some of us have forgotten
that multiculturalism is a two-way street,
and that we cannot expect whites to be
the only ones who make changes.
I'll admit, a lot of whites have gotten
beaten up in the multicultural debate,
and some of them deservedly so. How
ever, multiculturalism is a debate that
should include everyone.
The problem arises when people begin
to think they have a monopoly on mul
ticulturalism. Most whites have confused
multiculturalism with assimilation, and
many, despite their intentions, approach

the debate with a paternalistic attitude.
Furthermore, some members of minor
ity communities don't really want mul
ticulturalism. Instead they advocate
multiculturalism in order to advance
their own personal politics.
Somewhere along the way, we lost the
meaning of multiculturalism. Multicul
turalism doesn't mean that we all have
to think and act the same way, or that
everyone has to be "politically correct."
Nor does multiculturalism mean that
we have to always be around each other.
Some white people, because of personal
and cultural insecurity, are threatened
when people of color get together. Many
see it as separatism or as a consortium
against white people, instead of viewing
it as people of color getting together to
share and celebrate among themselves.
Multiculturalism, as I see it, occurs
when people from diverse racial and cul
tural backgrounds live together peaceful
ly, and are able to share and learn from
each other. Multiculturalism means there
is no hierarchy of cultures, and everyone
is given equal social and economic oppor
tunities for success and happiness.
In order to achieve multiculturalism,
we need to respect different cultures. But
we can't begin to respect different cul
tures until we understand and learn
about them.
And we can't learn about them until
Stanford hires more minority faculty.
Students of color cannot continue to be
the "spokespersons" for their race in the
classrooms and dorms.

to multiculturalism, it's absolutely ridic-

ulous that there is no ethnic studies re
quirement.
Stanford wants multiculturalism but
it doesn't want to take any real steps
toward achieving it. Despite a few classes,
the Stanford curriculum remains over
whelmingly Eurocentric. Only when
Stanford diversifies its curriculum can
we effectively push for multiculturalism.
Hopefully, the Irvine grant will result
in a change in the curriculum. Let's also
hope white students take advantage of
ethnic studies classes and allow them
selves to be educated instead of assuming
they have all the answers.
And let's hope students of color con
tinue to welcome whites into the debate,
and that we begin to re-examine our com
mitment to multiculturalism. Otherwise
we can forget about multiculturalism al
together.
