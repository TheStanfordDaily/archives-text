## Warren Packard and Brent Williams Letter showed ignorance of multiculturalism at Stanford 
### 
THIS IS YET another letter con
cerning ignorance.
In four years at Stanford,
years spent, among other things,
keeping an open eye to changes occur
ring on campus and around the nation,
maintaining a ready ear to catch the
arguments and pleas of both minority
and non-minority students alike and
reflecting upon our own attitudes and
the opinions of those around us, we
have compiled this set of comments
regarding Eric Mikkelson's letter head
lined "Racism against whites spreading
across University."
How can you justify calling black
fraternities and sororities as well as
the Black Student Union "the most
blatant and inexcusably racist student
organizations on campus" when the
whole country, not to mention a large
portion of our own University, insists
that blacks as well as other minorities
abandon their own values and customs
and assimilate into a white society
governed by white values and ideals?
Don't you feel that minorities
deserve the right, at the very least, to
maintain some hold on their own
beliefs and customs without the disap
proving eye of white society looking
over their shoulder?

Furthermore, your contention that
skin color is a membership criterion
for the BSU and the black Greek
organizations is false; though these
organizations are traditionally regarded
as 'closed' to others, they presently do
not limit membership along racial
lines.
When you state that "serious and
debilitating compromises in competence
are being made at Stanford" due to a
program in affirmative action, are you
seriously implying that minority
workers who are employed under this
program are incompetent?
Moreover, do you seriously believe
that they lack the ability to be taught,
or learn on their own, any relevant
skills which they don't happen to have?
You seem fairly certain that minority
employment currently is and will be in
the future "serious and debilitating."
We challenge you to support any one
of these claims with real evidence, not
just petty conjecture. Your blanket
assumption of the incompetence of
workers hired under affirmative action
reinforces harmful racial stereotypes
that prevent minorities from receiving
equal economic opportunity in the first
place.
No hiring process is entirely objec-

tive. Certainly in a society such as
ours that has historically and system
atically denigrated people of color,
racial discrimination has been institu
tionalized and engrained in our na
tional psyche.
As long as the white population is
consciously or unconsciously preferred
for employment, minorities will not be
afforded a fair opportunity, for if one
assumes a priori that a person is
unqualified, then it is that much easier
to find faults which will support estab
lished prejudices. One way to overcome
such injustice is through the deliberate
institution of affirmative action.
You bring up the fact that there is a
"quiet, powerful (00000, scary!) resent
ment growing among whites" who feel
that they're paying an "increasingly
burdensome toll for the crimes of their,
or someone else's, ancestors."
While we don't deny that this
"quiet" minority exists, it is terribly
unfortunate that you have arrived at
the conclusion that crimes committed
against minorities are simply a disap
pointing feature of the past, and, this
being so, there is absolutely nothing
you can do about it.
With such a bold statement you have

successfully justified your inaction and
ambivalence toward issues involving
minorities. Unfortunately, these crimes
are still being committed. Until the
entire population of this country wakes
up from its peaceful slumber and
realizes that it has a long way to go
before minorities feel comfortable living
here, we will continue to commit
crimes against our neighbors while we
turn our heads and look the other way.
Finally, if you think that Martin
Luther King Jr. had a dream of a
society where one's skin color is "ir
relevant," you are sadly mistaken.
If you believe that minority groups
in general are out to eliminate racial
barriers by asking people to ignore the
color of their skin, you are sadly mis
taken.
If you maintain that the cure for a
racially biased society is to urge every
one to assimilate to a common culture
where everyone shares in similar
values and customs, you are sadly
mistaken.
Even here at Stanford, the colorful
and creative character of "Identity" is
all too frequently tossed aside in order
to make way for an individual's devel
opment as a "Stanford student."

This does not have to happen. While
a community can grow together around
a common set of goals and experiences,
the beauty and richness of community
life stems from the diversity and crea
tivity of its individual constituents.
To this end, we have ethnic, religious
and cultural minorities to thank. In
stead of leading us to believe that the
color of their skin is irrelevant, they
teach us to pay careful attention to the
color of their skin and everything else
about them, for they are more than
eager to expose us to their inextin
guishable pride, their brilliant customs,
their colorful history and, most of all,
their cultural "Identity."
While we will not label you (as you
had guessed) as a racist, we will label
you as being sophomoric. With the
boldness which you exhibited in writ
ing your letter, we hope that you will
see it fitting to learn more about
minority life on campus and, once
again, reflect upon and root out your
racial biases.
