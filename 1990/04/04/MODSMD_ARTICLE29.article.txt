## Logging destroys giants

"Save Our Ancient Forests."
The statement alone might not
conjure up images of urgently
threatened natural grandeur, but
the sign hangs on an immense
section of a felled Douglas fir. The
tree, nicknamed "the Big One,"
measures more than 10 feet in
diameter.
Strapped to the back of a huge
truck traveling cross-country, the
fir is a testament to its fellow
redwoods, fir and spruce — the
largest living beings on the planet
— which may be entirely elimi
nated in the next five to 10 years.
Doug Nalen and Sean McGinty
are accompanying the tree on the
Ancient Forest Rescue Expedition,
a journey whose first stop was
Stanford. Their goal is to per
suade voters to sign the California
Forests Forever Initiative or to
write letters to their senators and
representatives.
The facts speak for themselves,
but when they are communicated
by an ex-logger and slides of
majestically towering trees, the
presentation is nothing short of
inspirational.
Because of exploitative overcut
ting by timber companies, less
than 10 percent of the ancient
forests of the Pacific Northwest
remain standing today. The
United States Forest Service has
been negligent in its protection of
the forests, using tax dollars to
build enough access roads to circle
the Earth 14 times.
Timber sales are highly sub
sidized by the government, drop
ping the price of timber far below
its actual cost. The increasing ex
port of unmilled logs — 2.5 billion
board-feet of lumber annually —
passes the subsidy on to Japan,
China, Korea and Taiwan at the
expense of the U.S. taxpayer.
Clearcutting leaves the forests
covered with pockmarks, destroy
ing the habitat of over 150 species,
including the bald eagle and the
great blue heron. These habitats
cannot be easily replaced, as
stands replanted by timber com
panies are tree plantations lacking
the diversity in age and species
needed to support forest wildlife.
The United States is not only
sacrificing its natural heritage to
short-term profiteering, but it is

being hypocritical in its demands
that Brazil and Indonesia cease
their deforestation. It is past time
for the United States to take re
sponsibility for its own forests,
which are just as important in
preventing global warming as
those in other parts of the world.
U.S. citizens have vociferously
protested the deforestation in na
tions such as Brazil. Many look
upon clearcutting of tropical rain
forests as an ultimately self
destructive activity as well as a
selfish one, while failing to ad
dress the same activity in the
United States.
People forget that in the days
of expansion on the frontier, trees
were seen as obstacles to be over
come for the good of the people.
By the 19605, almost all privately
owned old-growth timber had
been removed at accelerating
rates. After exhausting the forests
of the East and Midwest, timber
companies began encroaching on
the national forests of the Pacific
Northwest as the last reserve of
naturally growing timber.
What are timber companies
planning to do once all old-growth
forests are gone? They plan to
continue business by harvesting
second growth forests, planted
mainly with Douglas fir because
of its rapid growth rates. But
think again before envisioning
old-growth-style, albeit smaller,
second growth forests.
The neatly planted rows of firs
are all roughly the same height.
Neither cornfields nor forests can
sustain such treatment. The soil
erodes and loses fertility without
the benefits of rich humus formed
by decaying logs. Water becomes
cloudy, deprived of its natural fil
tration systems. The new forest
is genetically bland, and therefore
more vulnerable to disease, in
sects and fire. The largest source
of air pollution in the Pacific
Northwest is the deliberate bur
ning that follows clearcutting.
Biology is not the only impor
tant issue at stake. The export of
unprocessed lumber, mainly to

Japan, deprives U.S. taxpayers of
the full benefits of their support
of the Forest Service. The timber
industry has tried to convince mill
workers and loggers that it is
valiantly defending their jobs
against conservationists.
In actuality, by exporting 90
percent of Alaska's harvest, the
industry is denying U.S. citizens
of jobs processing lumber. Japa
nese processors are able to bid
higher than most U.S. processors,
so two-thirds of the Pacific North
west harvest is exported to Japan,
along with the jobs and benefits
of the subsidized timber harvest.
So far the timber industry has
been successful at turning
workers against conservationists.
The hostility is clear from dem
onstrations staged against the en
dangered spotted owl.
Conservationists have taken on
the owl's cause because its
precarious status is an alarm sig
nal for the interconnected ecosys
tem.
Spotted owls feed on rodents
and flying squirrels, which in turn
feed on a fungus called mycorrizae
that grows on the ground and
plant roots in the ancient forests.
The fungus helps plants, includ
ing the majestic trees, absorb
nutrients and avoid root rot. As
the trees disappear, so does the
mycorrizae. The fate of the
spotted owl is clearly aligned with
the fate of the ancient forests.
Unfortunately, government
agencies have thus far failed to
sufficiently protect the spotted
owl and its habitat. The Forest
Service admits that under its plan
the spotted owl will probably be
extinct in 100 to 150 years. Strong
timber lobbies and public parades
of owl hunters have further wor
sened the owl's plight.
The spotted owl is a reminder
that the forest is a complex
ecosystem whose fate has impli
cations for global warming,
enjoyment of nature's gifts and
the economy. Chief Sealth, for
whom Seattle was named, put it
best: "This we know. The earth
does not belong to man, man
belongs to earth. This we know.
All things are connected like the
blood which unites one family. . . .
Man did not weave the web of
life, he is merely a strand in it.
Whatever he does to the web, he
does to himself."
