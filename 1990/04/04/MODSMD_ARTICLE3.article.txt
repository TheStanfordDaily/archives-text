# Fac Sen to consider revamped distribution requirements
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
The freshman class entering Stanford
in 1991 will face an expanded set of dis
tribution requirements, if a new proposal
by the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies is passed by the Faculty Senate.
The new proposal restructures the cur
rent system and adds three new require
ment categories: world cultures, gender
studies and ethnic studies.
However, students will not have to take

any more courses than currently re
quired, according to History Prof. Peter
Duus, chair of the committee.
The proposed new requirements in
clude 11 different areas. The Cultures,
Ideas and Values track and the three
requirements in mathematics and sci
ences would remain the same.
The major changes would be in the
humanities and social sciences require
ments, which would gain the three new
requirements for a total of seven.
Under the proposal, students would

have to take at least four courses to
fulfill these seven requirements. To ac
complish this, certain courses could be
used to satisfy two of the different areas,
said Duus, just as certain courses now
fulfill both the non-Western culture re
quirement and a distribution require
ment.
For example, the course "The Psychol
ogy of Women" would fulfill the require
ments in both gender studies and Human
Development, Behavior and Language,
according to the proposal.

Junior Smita Singh, a member of the
committee, said the new requirements
are "taking a step toward exposing stu
dents to areas that are important in a
changing world." The possibility of
"double counting" will permit more in
terdisciplinary work, she added.
The committee was charged last year
by the Faculty Senate with considering
changes in the current system, Duus said.
He said he hopes there will be a lot of
discussion on the proposed changes. A
public meeting on the proposal will be

held on April 11 at 7 p.m. in History
Corner, room 2.
Duus will also hold meetings with de
partment representatives and other fac
ulty members before finalizing the
proposal.
The final proposal will be submitted
to the Faculty Senate in May. Duus said
he hopes it will be approved by the end
of the school year.
Proposed additions are designed to ad-
dress some of the academic issues
that have been discussed over the
past few years, Singh noted. For
example, the proposed world cul
tures area establishes the current
non-Western culture requirement
as a full-fledged distribution re
quirement.
The ethnic studies area is in
tended to "introduce students to,
and cultivate their understanding
of, the history and culture of mi
norities in the United States sys
tematically discriminated against
on the basis of conceptions of race

or religion," the proposal states.
The requirement focuses on mi
norities in the United States, dis
tinguishing these groups from
non-Western cultures.
It was added by the committee
when "it became clear from the
[University Committee on Minor
ity Issues] report that this issue
needed to be addressed," Duus
said.
Adding gender studies to the
proposal is partly in response to
a request from the Program in
Feminist Studies, Duus said. The
gender studies area is designed to
"encourage students to study is
sues of gender conceptions, gender
roles, gender relations and sexual
identity and their relation to

'Students need
knowledge about
these fields to live
in the modern
world.'

gender-related social outcomes,"
according to the proposal.
Duus said the proposal only re
quires ten courses so it will not
place any unnecessary burdens on
students in engineering or other
majors that have many course re
quirements of their own.
"We wanted to make it possible
to fulfill the requirements by

taking only ten courses (including
Freshman English)," Duus said.
However, students would not
have to count one course toward
two requirements if they choose
not to, Duus noted.
The committee chose not to
change the requirements in the
three technical areas.
"Students need knowledge
about these fields to live in the
modern world," Duus said. In ad
dition, it would be difficult to
double count courses in these
fields, he added.
The committee is also consid
ering slightly modifying the Tech
nology and Applied Science
requirement to focus on the im
pact of technology on society, ac
cording to Duus.
