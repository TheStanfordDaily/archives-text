# Fac Sen to consider revamped distribution requirements
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
The freshman class entering Stanford
in 1991 will face an expanded set of dis
tribution requirements, if a new proposal
by the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies is passed by the Faculty Senate.
The new proposal restructures the cur
rent system and adds three new require
ment categories: world cultures, gender
studies and ethnic studies.
However, students will not have to take

any more courses than currently re
quired, according to History Prof. Peter
Duus, chair of the committee.
The proposed new requirements in
clude 11 different areas. The Cultures,
Ideas and Values track and the three
requirements in mathematics and sci
ences would remain the same.
The major changes would be in the
humanities and social sciences require
ments, which would gain the three new
requirements for a total of seven.
Under the proposal, students would

have to take at least four courses to
fulfill these seven requirements. To ac
complish this, certain courses could be
used to satisfy two of the different areas,
said Duus, just as certain courses now
fulfill both the non-Western culture re
quirement and a distribution require
ment.
For example, the course "The Psychol
ogy of Women" would fulfill the require
ments in both gender studies and Human
Development, Behavior and Language,
according to the proposal.

Junior Smita Singh, a member of the
committee, said the new requirements
are "taking a step toward exposing stu
dents to areas that are important in a
changing world." The possibility of
"double counting" will permit more in
terdisciplinary work, she added.
The committee was charged last year
by the Faculty Senate with considering
changes in the current system, Duus said.
He said he hopes there will be a lot of
discussion on the proposed changes. A
public meeting on the proposal will be

held on April 11 at 7 p.m. in History
Corner, room 2.
Duus will also hold meetings with de
partment representatives and other fac
ulty members before finalizing the
proposal.
The final proposal will be submitted
to the Faculty Senate in May. Duus said
he hopes it will be approved by the end
of the school year.
Proposed additions are designed to ad-
