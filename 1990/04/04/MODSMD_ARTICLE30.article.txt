# Bug warms up cold victims
## 
### Megan Beardsley Staff writer 
In the March 9 Daily, the Bug
requested that I say a few sci
entific words about hypother
mia — in particular, whether
the best treatment for the con
dition is taking off all your
clothes and climbing into a
sleeping bag with a companion.
Hypothermia is the some
times fatal chilling of the blood
and internal organs. This can
occur after only a few minutes
if a person is immersed in freez
ing water, but it can also be
caused by extended exposure
without shelter or clothing at
temperatures as high as 70
degrees Fahrenheit, says junior
Jeff Tumlin, co-director of the
Outdoor Education Program.
Hypothermia quickly affects
the brain, and its victims begin
to speak slowly, lose hand coor
dination and stumble. Most dan
gerously, they lose the ability to
think clearly and often don't
realize they need help or even
notice that they are cold.
At this stage, it is very im
portant to remove the sufferer's
wet clothes and to apply a gentle
source of heat. Hot water bottles
and warm wet towels are rec
ommended, but in many cases,
Tumlin says, body-to-body con
tact is "the only treatment avail

able in the field."
Just in case you were getting
any ideas about asking for help
"practicing hypothermia treat
ment techniques," be warned —
hypothermia victims should
avoid strenuous activities.
Those with moderate to severe
hypothermia should not exercise
at all.
Q. How does oh, say, armpit
• hair know when to stop
growing?
Q. Why does hair grow back
• coarser after you shave?
A .All hairs — whether on
• your scalp or your toes —
grow, rest and eventually fall
out, says Dr. Youn Kim of the
Department of Dermatology at
the Medical School.
The length of the hair in dif
ferent locations is determined
by the amount of time the root
of the hair spends in the
growing stage. The roots on
your scalp grow hair for a longer
time before resting than do the
roots of your eyebrows, says
Kim. The roots of armpit hair
have growing stages somewhere
between the two.
As for the idea that shaving
makes hair coarser, hormonal
changes like those that occur in
puberty can change the color

and thickness of human hair,
but shaving, Kim says, has no
affect on the hair root. "That's
their imagination," Kim says.
"There's no evidence that it gets
thicker."
Anyway, this is my final
column (sob!). It's been lots of
fun. If I haven't answered your
question yet, don't worry, I'll
pass it on to my two highly ca
pable successors.
