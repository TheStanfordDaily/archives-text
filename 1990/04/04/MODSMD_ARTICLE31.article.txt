Meditation goes Transcendental
A Stanford physicist has found that of all forms
of meditation and relaxation, Transcendental
Meditation appears the most effective against
general anxiety.
Kenneth Eppley of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center coauthored the study with Jona
than Shear, a philosopher at Virginia
Commonwealth University, and psychologist Al
lan Abrams of the University of San Francisco.
Eppley has been practicing Transcendental
Meditation for 14 years and is interested in the
phenomenon of meditation. He said he and his
coauthors took considerable effort to make sure
none of their expectations affected the results of
the study.
Transcendental Meditation originated with an
Indian guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Practition
ers are given a mantra, a polysyllabic word or
sound, that they recite mentally to promote
relaxation. They practice the technique twice a
day for about 20 minutes.
Eppley's work involved meta-analysis, which
permits statisticians to analyze a large series of
experiments even though the studies may involve

different variables or inconsistencies.
Transcendental Meditation "was found to
produce a significantly larger effect than other
forms of meditation and relaxation in the reduc
tion of trait anxiety," Eppley, Shear and Abrams
wrote.
Cancer treatment center opens
A powerful cancer-fighting technique, born at
Stanford more than 50 years ago but then aban
doned, has been revived at the Medical Center
and offers hope to patients with cancer deep
within the body.
Called intraoperative radiotherapy, the tech
nique is particularly helpful for colon or pelvic
cancers, said Dr. Malcolm Bagshaw, chairman of
the Department of Radiation Oncology. The com
pletion of a specially designed operating room
has enabled Stanford to begin using the technique
again.
The room, including the floor, is lined with
lead, and the windows through which the treat
ment team monitors the patient are constructed
with lead-impregnated glass.
