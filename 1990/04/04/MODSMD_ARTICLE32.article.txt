# The
						healthy choice can be good for the environment

### June Cohen Staff writer 
The media today is flooded with
warnings about environmental
hazards and personal health risks.
The abundant and often conflict
ing reports are confusing to many
individuals who are trying to bal
ance social and personal respon
sibility.
Fortunately, what is good for
the individual is usually good for
the environment, and many of the
choices one can make to enhance
personal health benefit the planet
as well.
For instance, many individuals
limit their consumption of meat
in order to reduce the cholesterol
and fat in their diets. This reduc
tion may aid in heart disease pre
vention and weight reduction and
benefit the environment.
Raising livestock causes rapid
erosion of soil, and necessitates a
far greater input of resources
than other food sources. For in
stance, 2,500 gallons of water are
required to produce one pound of
beef, while the same amount of
grain requires only 60 gallons. In
addition, it takes 16 pounds of
grain and soybeans to produce one
pound of beef; in a world of
rapidly diminishing resources
where many go hungry, it is far

more efficient to eat the grain
directly.
In addition, developers are now
clearing great portions of the
South American tropical rain for
est to create grazing land for
cattle. The beef produced this way
is used primarily by fast food res
taurants. By avoiding such res
taurants, one can discourage the
industry's exploitation of land,
while also avoiding the food,
which tends to be unhealthy and
high in fat and sodium.
The chemical fertilizers and
pesticides used in crop cultivation
are another area of concern and
potential danger for both the in
dividual and the environment.
Even though only one-tenth of 1
percent of the chemicals actually
reach the intended insects,
375,000 tons of pesticides con
tinue to be administered on U.S.
farmlands every year â€” primarily

for cosmetic purposes.
These chemicals endanger the
environment by releasing damag
ing toxins into the soil and air
and can be harmful to individuals
as well. Pesticide use may cause
cancer, birth defects and organ
damage in both consumers and
farm workers.
By purchasing organic prod
ucts, one can both discourage
these practices and avoid personal
harm. Organic produce is grown
without the use of chemical fer
tilizers or pesticides and is avail
able at local markets.
One of the most common
manifestations of environmental
concern at Stanford is the
avoidance of styrofoam. The
familiar blue travel mug is om
nipresent around campus, and has
reduced the use of take-out
styrofoam cups considerably.
Mug-toters are aware that while
reducing waste, they are also
saving money on each refill; how
ever, they are usually ignorant of
the health benefits such mugs
provide.
Styrofoam is particularly harm
ful to the environment because in
addition to being unrecyclable, it
releases toxins into the air when
incinerated. These same chemi
cals are released when hot liquid,
such as coffee, is poured into a

styrofoam container, and the
toxins which harm the environ
ment can be directly harmful to
individuals as well.
Regular exercise, like a proper
diet, is lauded for its health
benefits. Americans tend to be
sedentary, and regular cardiovas
cular exercise is believed to play
an important role in preventing
heart disease and promoting gen
eral well-being.
Riding a bicycle is necessary for
mobility at Stanford and is fre
quently touted for its health
benefits as well. Choosing this
mode of transportation instead of
a car also benefits the environ
ment.
Burning gasoline releases pol
lutants into the air; oil and other
automotive fluids contaminate
water and soil; and the chemicals
emitted by leaky air conditioners

are a msyor cause of ozone deple
tion.
Automobiles account for ap
proximately one half of the na
tion's oil consumption, and oil
supplies are rapidly depleting.
Such sensitive areas as off-shore
waters and the Alaskan wilder
ness are now being exploited by
developers seeking to augment
present stores and keep up with
demand.
In addition, when oil is burned,
it emits carbon dioxide, the major
greenhouse gas which is believed
to contribute to global warming.
Automobiles are responsible for
emitting 20 percent of the nation's
carbon dioxide, as well as 40 per
cent of the nitrogen oxide respon
sible for acid rain and much of
the toxic carbon monoxide and
hydrocarbons that cause smog in
the United States.

Faulty air conditioners in cars
release toxins called chlorofluoro
carbons into the air. CFCs are
among the dangerous chemicals
which are destroying the ozone
layer of the stratosphere.
The ozone layer is responsible
for filtering out much of the
damaging ultraviolet light from
the sun, and the effects of ozone
depletion may be devastating to
the health of many individuals.
The resulting rise in exposure to
damaging light rays may cause
crop damage and a number of
health problems for humans, in
cluding cancer and cataracts. The
Environmental Protection Agency
now predicts an additional 20,000
skin cancer cases for each 1 per
cent decrease in ozone.
When you must drive, choose a
car which is fuel-efficient (new
models get up to 55 miles per
gallon) to cut costs and conserve
resources. Have your car in
spected frequently, and avoid
using the air conditioner when
ever possible.
It is often difficult to see the
effects of one's efforts on the en
vironment; however, as in the case
of personal health, the small
things one does over a lifetime do
make a difference, and the long
term benefits greatly outweigh
the short-term inconveniences.
