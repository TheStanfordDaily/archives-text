## A 						STANFORD DAILY COMMEMORATIVE SECTION Seniors go out with style 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Amid all the joy and celebra
tion of the past few days, it
has to have been easy to
avoid thinking about. But it cannot
be wished away.
Sometime, maybe next week,
maybe next month, maybe not till
next year, everyone will remember
that Jennifer Azzi, Stacy Parson
and Katy Steding will never again
suit up in a Stanford uniform.
With all the great memories
those three have provided, all they
have done for women's basketball
here, it seems almost impossible
to say goodbye. But we must do
just that.
As they have written a most ex
ceptional chapter in the annals of
Stanford University, they will
never be forgotten. Nor will they
ever forget what they accom
plished.
A look at the school's record
books gives one some idea of the
impact they made. Points scored:
Azzi is second, Steding third.
Rebounds: Steding is second, Azzi
11th. Assists: Azzi is first, Steding
seventh. Games played: Steding is
first, Azzi second and Parson
fourth.
Their impact, of course, cannot
be measured in mere statistics.
When those three committed to
Stanford, the team was not a win
ner. As freshmen, they had to beat
Hawaii in the season finale to
finish .500; as seniors, they won
a national title.
Azzi became the symbol of the
team's success. As a junior she was
named Pacific 10 Conference
Player-of-the-Year and was tabbed
as an All-American. This season
she received those honors again in
addition to the two most pres
tigious national player of the year
awards: the Wade Trophy and the
Naismith.
At Maples yesterday, she talked
about her career coming to an end.
The gym was empty and she knew
she would never play there again.
"All year, I've sort of been prepar
ing myself," Azzi said. Winning
the NCAA crown has made it
easier for her to deal with things.
"If we had gone out any other
way, I'd be sad. But we did all
that you could possibly do," she
added. "I'm ready to do something
new."
With all the media attention she
received during the Final Four,

Azzi did not have a chance to let
it all sink in. "While it was going
on, I don't think I realized what
was happening.
"I didn't have time to enjoy it.
I was doing, doing, doing stuff ail
the time," she said. Yesterday, she
began to savor the feeling. "I'm
just amazed. I just feel a really
incredible sense of satisfaction."
Steding was equally ebullient.
"It doesn't feel like it's over," she
explained. "We're all still celebrat
ing. [Sunday] was just probably
the best day of my life. It was the
culmination of 12 or so years of
hard work.
"It didn't always look like it was
going to pay off."
Parson was just starting to put
things in perspective. "It's kind of
setting in a little more. You kind
of realize the significance of it. I
don't think I had many expecta
tions coming in (four years ago),"
she said.
Neither did Steding. When Tara
VanDerveer recruited her, Steding
says she listened to the coach talk
about building a national power
and nodded her head while think
ing, "Yeah, right." It's not that
the idea wasn't attractive to her,
it's just that she had trouble seeing
it reach fruition.
Steding said since she was not
a big-time player in high school,
she had trouble believing what she
was hearing. "Tara thought we all
had the ability to be a team that
could make it to the Final Four,"
Steding remembered.
"That sounds great, but it's kind
of like a pipe dream. I guess I
should have had more faith."
Azzi saw things differently. "I
was maybe overconfident. I envi
sioned us in the Final Four three
out of my four years here," she
said, adding that maybe the team
would have won two national titles
along the way.
Still, Azzi is anything but dis
satisfied. As she was reminded
time and again last week, her
return to Tennessee provided the
perfect storybook ending for her
career.
It wasn't lost on her either.
"Personally, I'm not going to lie.
It felt great to win in Tennessee,"
she said, because it was a chance
to prove the naysayers wrong.
"They said you shouldn't go to
Stanford, you're not going to win
there."
In her triumphant return, all

that was in the past. Azzi is from
Oak Ridge, 20 miles from Knox
ville, the site of the Final Four.
After the championship game Sun
day, the mayor stopped by her
house to present Azzi with the key
to the city. The local TV station
showed highlights from the party.
Azzi would have been just as
happy if the focus was elsewhere.
"It makes me feel bad. I drew a
lot of attention away from the real
story, which is our team," she said.
Self-effacing to the end, Azzi
took time to credit her close friend
and backcourt mate Sonja Hen
ning, one of the many overlooked
stars on the team. "If I could give
it all to her, I would. I used to
run the point and there's no way
I would be free to do the things
I have without a great point
guard," she said.
She related a story from an in
terview she had this year in which
a reporter told Azzi her statistics
were really not that impressive. It
annoyed her not because she cared
about the numbers, Azzi said, but
because she didn't ask to be in
terviewed and there she was being
put down.
Meanwhile, without a spectacu
lar scoring average or shooting
percentage, Azzi collected the big
gest honors in her sport. "If there's
anything to the awards I take pride
in, it's that they recognize a team
player and team play. That's what
basketball is all about."
And it's certainly what the Car
dinal is all about. "Unity is some
thing we've stressed as long as
we've been here," Steding said.
"Even when we were a terrible
team. This year, especially, we've
made a conscious effort to remain
close."
They can stay together because
there is no division between
starters and reserves, between up
perclassmen and underclassmen.
Parson, perhaps better than
anyone, symbolizes the Stanford
magic. She played a reserve role
for four years without ever com
plaining.
VanDerveer has stressed the
"team first" concept since she ar
rived here. "Stacy Parson sets the
tone for that more than anybody
else."
And she and her classmates have
set a standard for all Stanford
teams in the future. They will be
dearly missed and fondly remem
bered.

tigious national player of the year
awards: the Wade Trophy and the
Naismith.
At Maples yesterday, she talked
about her career coming to an end.
The gym was empty and she knew
she would never play there again.
"All year, I've sort of been prepar
ing myself," Azzi said. Winning
the NCAA crown has made it
easier for her to deal with things.
"If we had gone out any other
way, I'd be sad. But we did all
that you could possibly do," she
added. "I'm ready to do something
new."
With all the media attention she
received during the Final Four,

Azzi did not have a chance to let
it all sink in. "While it was going
on, I don't think I realized what
was happening.
"I didn't have time to enjoy it.
I was doing, doing, doing stuff ail
the time," she said. Yesterday, she
began to savor the feeling. "I'm
just amazed. I just feel a really
incredible sense of satisfaction."
Steding was equally ebullient.
"It doesn't feel like it's over," she
explained. "We're all still celebrat
ing. [Sunday] was just probably
the best day of my life. It was the
culmination of 12 or so years of
hard work.
"It didn't always look like it was
going to pay off."
Parson was just starting to put
things in perspective. "It's kind of
setting in a little more. You kind
of realize the significance of it. I
don't think I had many expecta
tions coming in (four years ago),"
she said.
Neither did Steding. When Tara
VanDerveer recruited her, Steding
says she listened to the coach talk
about building a national power
and nodded her head while think
ing, "Yeah, right." It's not that
the idea wasn't attractive to her,
it's just that she had trouble seeing
it reach fruition.
Steding said since she was not
a big-time player in high school,
she had trouble believing what she
was hearing. "Tara thought we all
had the ability to be a team that
could make it to the Final Four,"
Steding remembered.
"That sounds great, but it's kind
of like a pipe dream. I guess I
should have had more faith."
Azzi saw things differently. "I
was maybe overconfident. I envi
sioned us in the Final Four three
out of my four years here," she
said, adding that maybe the team
would have won two national titles
along the way.
Still, Azzi is anything but dis
satisfied. As she was reminded
time and again last week, her
return to Tennessee provided the
perfect storybook ending for her
career.
It wasn't lost on her either.
"Personally, I'm not going to lie.
It felt great to win in Tennessee,"
she said, because it was a chance
to prove the naysayers wrong.
"They said you shouldn't go to
Stanford, you're not going to win
there."
In her triumphant return, all

that was in the past. Azzi is from
Oak Ridge, 20 miles from Knox
ville, the site of the Final Four.
After the championship game Sun
day, the mayor stopped by her
house to present Azzi with the key
to the city. The local TV station
showed highlights from the party.
Azzi would have been just as
happy if the focus was elsewhere.
"It makes me feel bad. I drew a
lot of attention away from the real
story, which is our team," she said.
Self-effacing to the end, Azzi
took time to credit her close friend
and backcourt mate Sonja Hen
ning, one of the many overlooked
stars on the team. "If I could give
it all to her, I would. I used to
run the point and there's no way
I would be free to do the things
I have without a great point
guard," she said.
She related a story from an in
terview she had this year in which
a reporter told Azzi her statistics
were really not that impressive. It
annoyed her not because she cared
about the numbers, Azzi said, but
because she didn't ask to be in
terviewed and there she was being
put down.
Meanwhile, without a spectacu
lar scoring average or shooting
percentage, Azzi collected the big
gest honors in her sport. "If there's
anything to the awards I take pride
in, it's that they recognize a team
player and team play. That's what
basketball is all about."
And it's certainly what the Car
dinal is all about. "Unity is some
thing we've stressed as long as
we've been here," Steding said.
"Even when we were a terrible
team. This year, especially, we've
made a conscious effort to remain
close."
They can stay together because
there is no division between
starters and reserves, between up
perclassmen and underclassmen.
Parson, perhaps better than
anyone, symbolizes the Stanford
magic. She played a reserve role
for four years without ever com
plaining.
VanDerveer has stressed the
"team first" concept since she ar
rived here. "Stacy Parson sets the
tone for that more than anybody
else."
And she and her classmates have
set a standard for all Stanford
teams in the future. They will be
dearly missed and fondly remem
bered.

Left to right, Stacy Parson, Jennifer Azzi and Katy Steding will graduate this year having brought
their team from obscurity to the pinnacle of college basketball. When the trio arrived, the Cardinal
was a .500 team. Four years later, Stanford won a national title. The names of Parson, Azzi and
Steding are indelibly etched throughout the Stanford record books.
Amid all the joy and celebra
tion of the past few days, it
has to have been easy to
avoid thinking about. But it cannot
be wished away.
Sometime, maybe next week,
maybe next month, maybe not till
next year, everyone will remember
that Jennifer Azzi, Stacy Parson
and Katy Steding will never again
suit up in a Stanford uniform.
With all the great memories
those three have provided, all they
have done for women's basketball
here, it seems almost impossible
to say goodbye. But we must do
just that.
As they have written a most ex
ceptional chapter in the annals of
Stanford University, they will
never be forgotten. Nor will they
ever forget what they accom
plished.
A look at the school's record
books gives one some idea of the
impact they made. Points scored:
Azzi is second, Steding third.
Rebounds: Steding is second, Azzi
11th. Assists: Azzi is first, Steding
seventh. Games played: Steding is
first, Azzi second and Parson
fourth.
Their impact, of course, cannot
be measured in mere statistics.
When those three committed to
Stanford, the team was not a win
ner. As freshmen, they had to beat
Hawaii in the season finale to
finish .500; as seniors, they won
a national title.
Azzi became the symbol of the
team's success. As a junior she was
named Pacific 10 Conference
Player-of-the-Year and was tabbed
as an All-American. This season
she received those honors again in
addition to the two most pres
tigious national player of the year
awards: the Wade Trophy and the
Naismith.
