# Once is not enough
## Graduation losses will hurt, but the Cardinal could contend again 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
"I think they can win it again," Jen
nifer Azzi said of Stanford's chances to
repeat as national champions.
While Coach Tara VanDerveer was
unwilling to do her best Pat Riley and
guarantee another NCAA crown, she
certainly did not rule out the possibility
of another Final Four appearance. "We
got a taste of it, and I know some people
want to get back."
Getting there won't be easy for a
team that loses Azzi, Stacy Parson and
Katy Steding to graduation. "Personally
I fell all three of our seniors are ir
replceable," VanDerveer said. "We are
not going to be the same team next
year."
That does not meet they can't even
tually be as good, however. For a few
minutes in the championship game, the
Cardinal featured a frontline of Julie
Zeilstra, Val Whiting and Trisha
Stevens. All are 6-foot-3; all are return
ing next season.
There is not a team in the country
that will be able to match up with that
frontcourt. But Stanford will not be
able to play those three together for
extended periods of time because it
would leave the team without bench
support in the low post.
When either Stevens, Whiting or
Zeilstra is sitting, the team will count
of big contributions from the likes of
Martha Richards, Chris MacMurdo and
Molly Goodenbour. All three were high
school All-Americans but played
sparingly this season.
Still, the coach believes they'll make
an impact. "I have a lot of confidence
in the returnees," she said. "People like
Molly, Chris and Martha . . . those three
are going to have to say, 'Hey, I loved
it in the Final Four. 1 want to be playing
in it.' "
In addition, the Cardinal recruiting
machine netted two top prospects in
the fall: Kelly Dougherty and Nicole
Sevillian. "Both of them are going to
have to come in and contribute," Van-
Derveer continued. "We are going to
have to count on nine or 10 people."

Dougherty and Sevillian are both lightn
ing quick and have a good chance of
being among those 10.
That would be a marked contrast to
this season where Stanford went six to
eight deep. VanDerveer explained that
while Azzi and Steding were able to
play nearly 40 minutes a game, she
expects to do more substituting next
season.
Perhaps most importantly, in Stevens
and Sonja Henning, the Cardinal
returns two legitimate player-of-the
year candidates. Stevens became a
nearly unstoppable low-post force in the
1989-90 season. She led the team in
scoring by a fairly substantial margin
and will conclude her career ahead of
Azzi and Steding on the all-time scoring
list.
The only thing limiting Stevens this
year was a pair of sore knees. She played
about 23 minutes a game as a result
of the chronic problem. Stevens will go
under the knife this spring and, assum
ing the surgery is a success, should be
even better in 1990-91.
Henning is almost certainly the na
tion's top floor general. She proved in
the tournament that if teams do not
play her honest, she can score as well.
Henning's assist-to-turnover ratio and
leadership are simply unmatched. If she
comes back in the fall with three-point
range — a distinct possibility — the
sky is the limit.
Zeilstra and Whiting are likely can
didates to replace Azzi and Steding on
the All-Pacific 10 Conference team.
When the season began, Zeilstra was
barely able to run due to an Achilles
problem. She recovered enough to go
and established herself as a superb
frontcourt passer who runs the break
exceptionally well.
VanDerveer praised Zeilstra for her
"court savvy" and her ability to quickly
pick up on what the coaches are asking
her to do. Since she primarily played
in the low post, Zeilstra's three-point
shooting ability was not demonstrated
in game situations this season.
Believe it or not, Stevens and Whiting
can hit the trey as well. At a practice
before the Final Four, all of them were

busting from outside. Stevens was even
hitting turnarounds from behind the
arc.
Whiting is a superstar in the making.
She is sensational in the low post,
rebounds with the best of them and
could shatter the school's blocked shot
record as a sophomore.
Mississippi Coach Van Chancellor
called her "the best sub in the world."
Hut whether she starts next season or
not won't matter. Whiting's minutes will
increase and her already stellar num
bers should increase, too.
Stanford's biggest challenge may be
dealing with some early season losses.
Not only will the team have to deal
with replacing two starters; it will have
to deal with difficult competition. "We
are playing an incredibly tough
schedule," VanDerveer said, adding it
will be much stronger than this year's.
The Cardinal will open its next cam
paign in the arena where it just captured
the national championship. This time,
though, Tennessee will be Stanford's op
ponent and VanDerveer expects the
place to be sold out.
Among the other non-conference
matchups are road games at Utah,
Colorado and Long Beach State. Stan
ford is playing in a mini-tournament in
South Carolina along with Ohio State,
Texas and Tennessee.
To top it off, the Cardinal Classic will
bring with it Georgia and Northwestern
Winning, VanDerveer says, breeds a
desire for more winning. The coach
turned to Angela Taylor, a walk-on at
the beginning of the season, during the
celebration and said to her: "You didn't
play a minute at Knoxville. How do you
feel?"
Said Taylor: "I feel great. This is
awesome."
In 1989-90, the Cardinal was pretty
awesome. Whether they are next year
remains to be seen. Four years ago, no
one believed Tara VanDerveer and Jen
nifer Azzi when they said they could
win a national championship at Stan
ford.
If Azzi really believes they can repeat,
who's to say she's not right this time,
too.

Freshman sensation Val Whiting is one of the main reasons the future looks bright
for Stanford women's basketball. She is one of many talented players who will help
the Cardinal defend Its title next season.
