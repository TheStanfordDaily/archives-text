# Can't touch us!
## 
### 
The story from Knoxville
was the same as it had
been all year. It was not
about one player or one play. It
was about one team and one goal.
From the posting of "NCAA
Champions 1990 â€” Get comforta
ble with it," on the first day of
practice, to the concluding "Stan
ford is #1" on the blackboard
after the championship game,
there was one dream and one way
to accomplish it. The fulfillment
of this dream came about from an
entity far more powerful then its
elements. It was a story more
about people then about basket
ball. No one ever really had a
chance of touching them.
