# Cardinal's long climb ends atop the basketball world
## April 1-National Championship Cardinal 88, Lady Tigers 81 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - Thirty
one victories was not going to
satisfy the Cardinal. If they could
just get one more Sunday, they
would be crowned national cham
pions and savor the memory for
the rest of their lives. Standing
in the way were the Auburn Lady
Tigers, who were making their
third straight appearance in the
championship game.
When nine seconds remained on
the clock, Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer looked up at the
scoreboard and realized what the
crowd of 20,023 in the Thompson-
Boling Arena already knew — the
Cardinal was about to win the
NCAA Championship for the first
time.
A moment later, Chantel
Tremitiere's three-pointer at the
buzzer trimmed the margin of vic
tory to 88-81 but could not
prevent the Tigers from being
bridesmaids once again.

"I don't know if you can really
put it into words," said an over
come Jennifer Azzi. "The thing
that's really special to me is that
we all care about each other so
much. I don't think you'll find
that on a lot of teams. We've
worked really hard and it's nice
to know it paid off."
For a while, it seemed like it
might not. The Cardinal jumped
ahead 22-11 in the opening eight
minutes as Azzi and Katy Steding
put on a three-point shooting
clinic. The school's second and
third all-time leading scorers com
bined for five treys as Stanford
threatened to make it a rout.
Then the Lady Tigers
responded with a 30-10 run that
almost buried the Cardinal before
halftime. Trailing 41-32 with two
minutes, seven seconds remaining
in the half, Stanford went to a
tri-towers frontline of Julie
Zeilstra, Val Whiting and Trisha
Stevens.
Quickly, the team reeled off
nine in a row to knot things at

41-41 heading into the intermis
sion. Auburn moved ahead 46-43
early in the second half before
Azzi keyed another 9-0 Stanford
run with two assists and a 16-foot
jumper. Stanford took a 52-46 lead
and never looked back.
When the horn sounded, the
Cardinal had smashed the Final
Four records for three-pointers
made (11) and attempted (26).
Steding hit a record six threes
and Azzi added four.
But the difference in the game
was the play of Sonja Henning.
She led Stanford with 21 points,
grabbed nine rebounds and only
committed two turnovers despite
bringing the ball up against the
vaunted Auburn press.
While Azzi and Steding were
named to the all-tournament
team, Henning was notable in her
absence. Asked whether it both
ered her, she responded: "I didn't
come here to make the all
tournament team. I came here to
win a national championship.
That's what we did."

championship on the team's home court. The victory earned Stanford its first trip to the Final Four
and the team made the best of it by capturing the NCAA crown.
