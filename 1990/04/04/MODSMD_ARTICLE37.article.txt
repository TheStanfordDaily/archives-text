# March 30-National Semifinals
## Cardinal 77, Cavaliers 65 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - The
matchup was between two teams
making their first Final Four ap
pearance: the young Virginia
Cavaliers and the veteran Stan
ford Cardinal. Each team got
there due in large part to the play
of an All-America guard.
On this Friday, before 19,467
fans in Tennessee's Thompson-
Boling Arena, senior Jennifer Azzi
and her Stanford teammates were
a bit better than Dawn Staley and
Virginia. The result was a 75-66
Cardinal victory and a chance to
play for the national champion
ship two days later.
Coach Tara VanDerveer was
thrilled to be in the title game,
but a bit disappointed in the way
things transpired during the
game. "It wasn't the Stanford
team I'm used to watching," she
said. "We were tight. We weren't
able to run our offense the way
we wanted to. Their inside players
disrupted our inside game."
Said Trisha Stevens: "It's no
fun getting your shot blocked. We
came out with the win but it
wasn't a pretty one."
The game seesawed in the early
going. Stanford jumped ahead 6-2,
fell behind 9-8, led 16-14, then
trailed 18-16.
Azzi, who finished with 15
points, six rebounds and five as
sists, tied things on a layup with
8 minutes, 50 seconds left in the
first half. A minute later she hit
a three-pointer to move Stanford
ahead 21-18. The Cardinal never

trailed again.
When Katy Steding hit two free
throws late in the first half, Stan
ford led 40-30 and threatened to
pull away. But Staley, who led the
Cavaliers with 18 points and eight
rebounds, scored five unanswered
points and helped Virginia pull
within 42-38 at halftime.
"Stanford played an outstand
ing game," Virgina Coach Debbie
Ryan said afterward. "They had
a few too many weapons for us
tonight."
Along with Azzi, those weapons
were Steding (a team-high 18
points), Stevens (16) and Sonja
Henning (12).
The "Fab Four" helped Stan
ford answer every Cavalier charge
in the second half. Though the
game remained close, the Cardinal
opened up a 13-point lead with
8:28 to play that seemed to give
the team control.
Three minutes later, Virginia
still trailed 63-52 when Heather
Burge, one of a pair of 6-foot-5
twins on the squad, was heading
for the basket on a breakaway.
She brought the ball up as though
she was going to dunk it.
Suddenly, at the last instant,
she switched her hand over and
scored on a finger roll. Had she
successfully slammed the ball, it
might have ignited a Virginia
comeback.
Instead, the Cavaliers could
only remind themselves that with
sophomores Staley and Tammi
Reiss in the backcourt, and a pair
of freshmen named Burge, they
might have a lot more comebacks
ahead of them.
