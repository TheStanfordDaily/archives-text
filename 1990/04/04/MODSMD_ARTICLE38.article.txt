# March 24-Regional Final
## Cardinal 114, Lady 'Backs 87 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The Lady Razorbacks were
something of a Cinderella in 1989-
90. They weren't expected to be
much of a threat with their youth
and inexperience. But when the
NCAA tournament field was
trimmed to eight, Arkansas was
still alive.
To reach the Final Four,
though, they would have to stop
Stanford on the Cardinal's home
court. In the last home game for
Jennifer Azzi, Katy Steding and
Stacy Parson. It did not seem pos
sible to deny the Cardinal's senior
trio a ticket to Knoxville, Tenn.
And on that night, the impos
sible remained impossible. Stan
ford played like a team on a mis
sion in a 114-87 triumph. The
Cardinal shot 58 percent from the
field, including an unbelievable 63
percent from three-point range.
They outrebounded Arkansas,
committed fewer turnovers and
dished out a Pacific 10
Conference-record 37 assists.
Azzi made 5 of 8 three-point
attempts and scored 20 points.
Steding hit 4 of 5 from behind
the arc and finished with 17.
Trisha Stevens missed on her trey
attempts, but led the Cardinal
with 24.
"That was easily the best shoot
ing team I've seen," Arkansas
Coach John Sutherland said. "I
remember one timeout, talking to
my assistant coaches and saying,
'You got a 27-point play?' They
said no."

At halftime, the Lady Razor
backs trailed 57-32 despite getting
21 points from Delmonica DeHor
ney. Sutherland was thinking
about making a lineup change for
the second period. "Is Magic in
there?" he asked his assistants,
looking at his team's locker room.
"Nope," they said.
"Is Barkley in there?" he said,
trying again.
"Nope."
Even if the Razorbacks had the
services of Earvin Johnson or Sir
Charles, they would have been
hard pressed to make the come
back. Stanford simply wanted it
too badly.
"The best competition brings
out the best in our players,"
Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I
love watching our team play."
In a game that provided count
less highlights, two stood out.
With the Cardinal ahead 66-43,
Azzi hit a three-pointer from the
left corner. After the shot, there
was a foul away from the ball
that gave Stanford possession
again. The ball was inbounded to
Steding, who hit a three from the
right corner. "I went crazy on the
six-point play. I've never seen that
before," VanDerveer said.
Later, on a fast break, Azzi
threw a 50-foot pass ahead to
Julie Zeilstra. The 6-foot-3 for
ward was drifting under the hoop
as the pass arrived so she tipped
it back to an oncoming Val
Whiting.
Whiting then layed it in and
the crowd — another sellout —
went wild.
