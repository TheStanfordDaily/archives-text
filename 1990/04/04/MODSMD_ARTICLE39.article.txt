# March 22-Regional Semifinal
## Cardinal 78, Lady Rebels 65 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Two years ago, Stanford sub
mitted a bid to host the West Re
gional this season knowing that
— if everything went according
to plan — the team would be a
contender for the championship.
Sure enough, the Cardinal's
1989-90 campaign went pretty
much as expected and the team
not only got to host the regional,
but was its No. 1 seed as well.
After upsetting highly-rated
UNLV in the second round, Mis
sissippi earned the dubious dis
tinction of facing the Cardinal in
the regional semifinals. The Lady
Rebels would have to contend with
a talented Stanford team and the
first home sellout — 7,500 were
on hand at Maples Pavilion — in
school history.
Mississippi was not intimidated,
though. Playing a suffocating de
fense and slowing the tempo, the
Rebels held Stanford in check for
much of the first half. Kimsey
O'Neal scored eight points in the
closing four minutes to pull Mis
sissippi within 39-33 at halftime.
O'Neal finished with 27 points
while shooting 12 of 18 from the
field. In the end though, her per
formance wasn't enough as Trisha
Stevens (19 points), Val Whiting
(18) and Julie Zeilstra (15) wore
down the Lady Rebels and led
Stanford to a 78-65 victory.
In the end, Mississippi Coach
Van Chancellor gave the Cardinal
all the credit. "We played a great
team tonight in a tough, hostile
environment," he said. "I don't

know how much else we could've
done.
"It was not a case of what Ole
Miss failed to do; it was what
Stanford did," he added.
Chancellor explained he wanted
to control Stanford's outside
shooting. "We have great
perimeter defensive players," he
explained. "We didn't realize they
were going to be so big, strong
and powerful."
While Jennifer Azzi and Katy
Steding were held to 14 points
combined, the Cardinal's inside
troika was on fire. "Fifty-two. Is
that the best sub in the world?"
Chancellor said of Whiting.
"[Stevensl has four fouls . . . They
bring in 52 and she just kills us."
"I guess I could tell him thank
you," Whiting said when told of
Chancellor's remarks. The fresh
man sensation contributed eight
rebounds, two blocks and two
steals to the Cardinal cause.
Said Azzi: "If the inside game's
open, I'd just as soon get the ball
inside." She brushed off sugges
tions that the fact she scored only
five points, her second lowest
total of the season, was in any
way relevant.
"We try not to count on one
person because things like this
can happen," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "The tempo
wasn't what I would've liked it
to have been." As with Azzi, the
team's scoring output was its
second-lowest of the season. In
the end, though, the coach was
pleased with the victory as it left
the team just one step short of
the Final Four.
