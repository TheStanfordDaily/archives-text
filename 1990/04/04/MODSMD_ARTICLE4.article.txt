# University report calls for reduced parking demand
## 
### Ari Richter Staff writer 
On-campuB parking will most likely become less
convenient in the future as the University attempts
to save money by reducing the demand for parking
spaces.
A report released today by the University Com
mittee on Parking and Transportation details pre
liminary plans to cut back demand for on-campus
parking spaces by offering carpool services, shuttles
from an off-campus parking lot and better Margue
rite service.
In the report, the committee concluded, "Our
first priority must befcome] conservation of re
sources — financial and environmental — at the
expense of convenience."
The University's current policy has been "to pro
vide convenient parking at affordable rates for
anyone who chooses to bring a car to campus,"
according to the report. Were such a policy to be
continued, the cost to the University might be as
much as $40 million.
To contain expected expenditures, the commitee
recommended that the University "reduce parking
demand by 10 percent from current levels over a
period of 10 years."
Ultimately, the committee hopes to see the campus
parking supply diminish.
Committee chair Pete Sidebot
tom explained, "We want to
reduce the number of parking
spaces on campus . . . but the Uni
versity has not done enough to
provide alternatives" that would
first decrease demand.
According to the report, a series
of "Transportation Demand Man
agement" programs are the key
to reducing the need for campus
parking.
These programs would include
"Marguerite improvements, new
shuttle services and incentives for
carpools, bicyclists, transit riders
and pedestrians."
In addition, the report recom
mends the creation of a new type
of parking facility, a surface lot
outside the Campus Drive loop,
for which both commuters and
resident students could obtain
"free 'D-permit' parking."
One or two such facilities
should be operational before Sep
tember and would include "bike
lockers, sheltered waiting areas

and campus phones" as well as
shuttle service to and from
campus, the report said.
Some current parking areas will
be lost to future construction, es
pecially in the Near West campus,
the report noted.
Sidebottom and student com
mittee member Kevin Lewis both
appeared pleased with the com
mittee's progress. Lewis said the
recommendations "represent the
views of the committee and the
best interests of the community
at large."
In particular, Lewis said he was
"very encouraged by the 'D
permit' alternative."
In contrast to this optimism,
committee member Diana Dia
mond suggested that the commit
tee reached "a very reluctant
consensus."
"No one is really particularly
happy," Diamond said. "There is
no optimal solution. . . . Every
body would like to see the Trans
portation Demand Management
Program work, but if you carpool
. . . it can cripple a person's ac
tivity during the day."
Jeffrey Tumlin, the other stu
dent member of the committee,
said he was pleased with the list

'We want to reduce
the number of
parking spaces on
campus ... but the
University has not
done enough to
provide alterna
tives.'

of recommendations released by
the committee but warned of po
tential infighting among the com
mittee's members in the future.
"There was a great deal of con
flict, mostly from Medical School
representatives," Tumlin said.
At one point the committee con
sidered prohibiting freshmen and
sophomores from bringing cars on
campus — a proposal that Tumlin
and Lewis dissuaded the commit
tee from adopting, Tumlin said.
"Students were going to bear
the whole brunt of changes," he
said.

David O'Brien, a committee
member from the School of Med
icine's planning office, explained,
"The Medical Center has unique
parking needs . . . [and] will not
fit easily into general policies. The
Medical Center is a business and
has a public that needs to be
served."
According to Tumlin, "Dealing
with the Medical School is going
to be a serious political issue."
Sidebottom did not discuss the
conflict but said "drastic actions"
not among the committee's cur
rent recommendations might be
come necessary if the goal of
reduced demand is not met.
What such actions might entail
is unclear, but the committee's
report does state "any rationing
system should spread the burden
equitably among all sectors of the
community and must be sensitive
to the needs of individuals and
groups."
With the preliminary recom
mendations released, the commit
tee will now hold four public
hearings in the next month.
Sidebottom strongly encouraged
all members of the Stanford com
munity to attend the hearings and
give "specific feedback."
