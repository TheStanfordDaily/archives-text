## Cardinal cruises to victory over UOP behind Sepeda's shutout 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Tension, pleasure, excitement
and drama were all present during
yesterday's game at Sunken Dia
mond.
They were lying on the grass
hill, sleeping in the sun.
The University of the Pacific's
lineup slept through most of the
game as well, as Cardinal pitcher
Jamie Sepeda went five and a
third innings before giving up a
hit. Other than Sepeda's perform
ance and Jeff Hammonds' dingle
in the seventh (extending his hit
ting streak to 27 games), though,
this game gave new meaning to
the word "snoozer."

Stanford now has a 27-7 record
heading into this weekend's home
series with UCLA. The Tigers,
who gave up the last eight runs
of the game after two bonehead
errors (perfectly complementing
their lethargic offense and less
than-lightning-like pitching), fell
to 10-22 — and have now been
outscored 38 to two in their last
two games at Stanford.
Sepeda set the tone early, strik
ing out the side in the top of the
first. He only got two K's in his
next five innings of work, but it
really didn't matter: The Tigers
hit the ball out of the infield a
whole four times while Sepeda
was pitching, and didn't get
anyone on base until Pat Floyd
reached on an error in the fifth.
"Everything was going well
today," said Sepeda. "At least, it
went better than it has been
before. . . My curveball was up a
little at first, but later on I got
it down to the point where it was
efWfrtive.

Other than Sepeda's
performance and Jeff
Hammonds' single...
this game gave new
meaning to the word
"snoozer".

"(Today) I threw more strikes
than I have before; in that respect,
it was my best outing," Sepeda
said. "I didn't have my best stuff
today, though."
He didn't exactly need it. While
the Tiger hitters were doing their
best impression of the Lewis &
Clark Pioneers, UOP starter Da
vid Cloninger was handing out
two-run homers left and right.
Paul Carey took Cloninger to
school in the first, crushing his
eighth homer of the season over
the pines in right-center. David
McCarty did the same two innings
later for his sixth dong, and Roger
Burnett got in on the party in
the fourth, knocking his third
homer off the top of the
scoreboard in left, making the
score 6-0 and effectivly putting
the game out of reach.
Even with the outcome never
in doubt, though, Stanford did
have two tense moments. The first
came in the third inning, when
Tim Griffin — who leads the team
in homers with 14 — fouled a
pitch off the plate. The ball kicked
up and hit Griffin in the left knee,
sending him writhing to the
ground. He managed to limp off
the field (with a little help), how
ever, and was later diagnosed as
having a bruised knee. He should
be fine for the UCLA series.
The second tense moment in
volved Hammonds, who was 0-
for-4 when he came to the plate

in the seventh. "I felt a little of
the pressure today," said Ham
monds, who came into the contest
two games shy of Troy Pausen's
28-game school-record hitting
streak. "This is the first game
I've really pressed. I didn't feel
good at all."
It showed: His first four times
up ended up in two ground outs,
a line out and a strikeout. "I
pretty much threw my first two
at-bats out the window," Ham
monds said. "I was like 'Oh man,
maybe this isn't my day."' In his
fifth try, though, Hammonds used
his greatest weapon — flat-out,
raw speed — to beat out a
grounder to short. By an inch.
Maybe.
Nothing like cutting it close,
huh? "That's the word for it,"
Hammonds said. "I don't like in
field hits, but that o»ie I didn't
mind."
