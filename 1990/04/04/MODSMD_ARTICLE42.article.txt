# Forsyth overcomes injuries to lead spikers
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Certain things in life just aren't
supposed to happen. The U.S.
wasn't supposed to beat the
Soviets at their own game, hockey.
Humans aren't supposed to be
able to score 69 points in a single
NBA game. Stanford isn't sup
posed to win basketball champi
onships. And 6-foot-3 high school
setters with tendinitis aren't sup
posed to go to college and lead
the nation in hitting percentage.
But then again, it wouldn't be
prudent to tell senior co-captain
of the men's volleyball team Craig
Forsyth where or how he's sup
posed to play. The Santa Monica
High product, who currently tops
the country with a .477 hitting
percentage, has defied expectation
throughout his career. Trained as
a redshirt setter with the team
in his freshman year, Forsyth
switched to starting outside hitter
that same year, and has since been
starting at middle blocker.
Don't attribute these rather
abrupt changes to mere coinci
dence, though. "Craig has worked
very hard to make himself the
player he is," Coach Fred Sturm
said. "He has dedicated himself
to Stanford volleyball and is play
ing with as much confidence, ag
gressiveness and leadership as he
ever has."
It is the combination of these
qualities that has developed For
syth into one of the premier
middle blockers in the country, a

and leadership as he ever has.'

magnet of defensive attention, and
a steady foundation upon which
the team is established.
"Craig hustles, works real hard,
and gives us a lift in a lot of
ways," setter and close friend
Parker Blackman said. "His atti
tude can be contagious."
Forsyth's attitude isn't the only
contagious thing with which he
has been associated, however.
Physical adversity has con
tagiously crept into every phase
of his volleyball career and has
significantly threatened it.
In coming to the Farm, Forsyth
was already in the midst of an
excruciating battle with tendinitis
in his knees. The enervating ail
ment taxed his every physical
reserve and handicapped his abil
ity to improve certain aspects of
his game, such as his vertical leap.
Continuing to compete with char
acteristic tenacity, Forsyth's knees
deteriorated rapidly and forced
him to avoid all other physical
activity, take cortisone injections,
and seriously consider surgery by
the end of his freshman year.
"Mv knees would hurt so much

that they would wake me up when
I was asleep," Forsyth said. "I
would always have to sit in the
aisle during classes so I could keep
my legs straight. It was hard to
stay focused. It wasn't enjoyable
to play and I couldn't train."
After sitting out volleyball
camps and programs in the sum
mer following his freshman year,
Forsyth returned for a season of
similar physical digression. Fol
lowing his sophomore year, the
starting middle blocker opted for
surgery. While recovering and
rebuilding his strength during his
junior year, Forsyth continual to
impact the team with his play and
started in Stanford's NCAA cham
pionship match against UCLA.
This year, however, is his first of
relatively complete health. And
"the difference in him physically,"
Blackman said, "is like night and
day."
"Craig has been injury-ridden
throughout his career here,"
Sturm said. "That affected his
performance at times. In spite of
this, he has played a role
on the team."

This sentiment is echoed con
currently by his teammates and
opponents alike. An eminent stu
dent of the game, Forsyth stood
in the wings of volleyball greats
such as Scott Fortune during his
first three years, developing a
refined court sense to emerge this
year as a true team leader in every
aspect of the game.
Leading his teammates and the
nation in hitting percentage, For
syth is also the team's second
most proficient blocker with 47
stuffs and has acquired 45 digs,
the fourth-best total on the team.
Statistics such as these may
come as somewhat of a surprise
to spectators of his game. Short
for a middle blocker by WIVA
standards, perhaps not as flam
boyantly expressive a hitter as
teammates Dave Goss and Dun
can Blackman, and playing con
stantly in the shadows of his
middle blocking counterpart, Ail-
American Dan Hanan, Forsyth
suffers from an intense lack of
recognition.
But the composed middle
blocker knows he has greater
things to worry about. "1 don't
mind it too much," Forsyth said.
"A lot of the things I do aren't
that noticeable. Since high school,
I seem to do a lot of the little
things."
Forsyth is often called upon to
"soft block" where he opens his
hands up to relay a hard-hit ball
up into the back row for an easy

pass, a far less crowd-pleasing
play than the "roof block in
which the ball is sent back down
and in immediately.
But it is this attention to the
"little things" that in the larger
picture makes Forsyth one of the
team's most essential components.
"Craig's not the biggest player.
He's not the fastest," Blackman
said. "But he's quick to the ball,
real consistent, can beat the block
and hits the ball real hard. He's
one of the reasons we win."
While such an assessment may
surprise some, it's hardly a
newsflash to his peers. "It
surprises me when he doesn't put
the ball away," said Blackman
who has been close friends with
Forsyth since the seventh grade.
For his deceptively powerful at
tacks, Forsyth acquired "Clubby"
— a derivation of "Clubber" —
as a nickname that has stuck since
his freshman year. The name has
become a rally cry for some of
his more ardent Phi Delt support
ers in the stands who can often
be heard screaming the appela
tion.
Considering his physical condi
tions, Forsyth's most surprising
contribution has been the effec
tiveness of his blocking. While of
ten shorter than many of his
attacking counterparts, he is con
sistently able to repel their poten
tial kills for the Cardinal.
"Craig has a natural feel for
blocking," Sturm said. "He knows
where he needs to place his hands,
he takes up a lot of space, and
he just has that instinct. He is

the most versatile blocker on the
team and can do all of our block
ing schemes well."
It was that instinct that com
pletely turned the season around
for Stanford last year, according
to Sturm. In a pivotal match
against top-ranked Hawaii, the
Cardinal fell behind 2-0 in games
playing without Forsyth. The
senior economics mtyor entered
the melee in the third game and
led a resurgent comeback to even
the game score. Down 10-13 in
the fifth, Stanford fell into danger
as a Hawaii hitter had the oppor
tunity to take the game to match
point. He simply had to put away
an errant ball that had been mis
handled while Stanford was out
of position.
Forsyth leapt off-balance in the
path of the attempted kill and
with one hand blocked the smash
back down onto Hawaii's side. The
Cardinal averted the loss,
defeated the No. 1 team, and rode
the emotional tide to the NCAA
championship match.
Sturm however hesitates to end
his appreciation. Forsyth has also
served in perhaps the most im
portant and least noticeable
capacity on the club, as a team
leader. Along with Blackman and
Hanan, Forsyth is a tri-captain of
the squad and has taken it upon
himself to motivate his peers. "I
try to make sure that guys are
going to work as hard as they can
and that they stay focused," For
syth said. "I try to rile the guys
up. My goal for this year is to
win the national championship
and to help the other guys play
better."

tial kills for the Cardinal.
"Craig has a natural feel for
blocking," Sturm said. "He knows
where he needs to place his hands,
he takes up a lot of space, and
he just has that instinct. He is

the most versatile blocker on the
team and can do all of our block
ing schemes well."
It was that instinct that com
pletely turned the season around
for Stanford last year, according
to Sturm. In a pivotal match
against top-ranked Hawaii, the
Cardinal fell behind 2-0 in games
playing without Forsyth. The
senior economics mtyor entered
the melee in the third game and
led a resurgent comeback to even
the game score. Down 10-13 in
the fifth, Stanford fell into danger
as a Hawaii hitter had the oppor
tunity to take the game to match
point. He simply had to put away
an errant ball that had been mis
handled while Stanford was out
of position.
Forsyth leapt off-balance in the
path of the attempted kill and
with one hand blocked the smash
back down onto Hawaii's side. The
Cardinal averted the loss,
defeated the No. 1 team, and rode
the emotional tide to the NCAA
championship match.
Sturm however hesitates to end
his appreciation. Forsyth has also
served in perhaps the most im
portant and least noticeable
capacity on the club, as a team
leader. Along with Blackman and
Hanan, Forsyth is a tri-captain of
the squad and has taken it upon
himself to motivate his peers. "I
try to make sure that guys are
going to work as hard as they can
and that they stay focused," For
syth said. "I try to rile the guys
up. My goal for this year is to
win the national championship
and to help the other guys play
better."
Quite noble — just don't tell
him that's what his goal is sup
posed to be.
Certain things in life just aren't
supposed to happen. The U.S.
wasn't supposed to beat the
Soviets at their own game, hockey.
Humans aren't supposed to be
able to score 69 points in a single
NBA game. Stanford isn't sup
posed to win basketball champi
onships. And 6-foot-3 high school
setters with tendinitis aren't sup
posed to go to college and lead
the nation in hitting percentage.
But then again, it wouldn't be
prudent to tell senior co-captain
of the men's volleyball team Craig
Forsyth where or how he's sup
posed to play. The Santa Monica
High product, who currently tops
the country with a .477 hitting
percentage, has defied expectation
throughout his career. Trained as
a redshirt setter with the team
in his freshman year, Forsyth
switched to starting outside hitter
that same year, and has since been
starting at middle blocker.
Don't attribute these rather
abrupt changes to mere coinci
dence, though. "Craig has worked
very hard to make himself the
player he is," Coach Fred Sturm
said. "He has dedicated himself
to Stanford volleyball and is play
ing with as much confidence, ag
gressiveness and leadership as he
ever has."
It is the combination of these
qualities that has developed For
syth into one of the premier
middle blockers in the country, a

magnet of defensive attention, and
a steady foundation upon which
the team is established.
"Craig hustles, works real hard,
and gives us a lift in a lot of
ways," setter and close friend
Parker Blackman said. "His atti
tude can be contagious."
Forsyth's attitude isn't the only
contagious thing with which he
has been associated, however.
Physical adversity has con
tagiously crept into every phase
of his volleyball career and has
significantly threatened it.
In coming to the Farm, Forsyth
was already in the midst of an
excruciating battle with tendinitis
in his knees. The enervating ail
ment taxed his every physical
reserve and handicapped his abil
ity to improve certain aspects of
his game, such as his vertical leap.
Continuing to compete with char
acteristic tenacity, Forsyth's knees
deteriorated rapidly and forced
him to avoid all other physical
activity, take cortisone injections,
and seriously consider surgery by
the end of his freshman year.
"Mv knees would hurt so much

that they would wake me up when
I was asleep," Forsyth said. "I
would always have to sit in the
aisle during classes so I could keep
my legs straight. It was hard to
stay focused. It wasn't enjoyable
to play and I couldn't train."
After sitting out volleyball
camps and programs in the sum
mer following his freshman year,
Forsyth returned for a season of
similar physical digression. Fol
lowing his sophomore year, the
starting middle blocker opted for
surgery. While recovering and
rebuilding his strength during his
junior year, Forsyth continual to
impact the team with his play and
started in Stanford's NCAA cham
pionship match against UCLA.
This year, however, is his first of
relatively complete health. And
"the difference in him physically,"
Blackman said, "is like night and
day."
"Craig has been injury-ridden
throughout his career here,"
Sturm said. "That affected his
performance at times. In spite of
this, he has played a role
on the team."

This sentiment is echoed con
currently by his teammates and
opponents alike. An eminent stu
dent of the game, Forsyth stood
in the wings of volleyball greats
such as Scott Fortune during his
first three years, developing a
refined court sense to emerge this
year as a true team leader in every
aspect of the game.
Leading his teammates and the
nation in hitting percentage, For
syth is also the team's second
most proficient blocker with 47
stuffs and has acquired 45 digs,
the fourth-best total on the team.
Statistics such as these may
come as somewhat of a surprise
to spectators of his game. Short
for a middle blocker by WIVA
standards, perhaps not as flam
boyantly expressive a hitter as
teammates Dave Goss and Dun
can Blackman, and playing con
stantly in the shadows of his
middle blocking counterpart, Ail-
American Dan Hanan, Forsyth
suffers from an intense lack of
recognition.
But the composed middle
blocker knows he has greater
things to worry about. "1 don't
mind it too much," Forsyth said.
"A lot of the things I do aren't
that noticeable. Since high school,
I seem to do a lot of the little
things."
Forsyth is often called upon to
"soft block" where he opens his
hands up to relay a hard-hit ball
up into the back row for an easy

play than the "roof block in
which the ball is sent back down
and in immediately.
But it is this attention to the
"little things" that in the larger
picture makes Forsyth one of the
team's most essential components.
"Craig's not the biggest player.
He's not the fastest," Blackman
said. "But he's quick to the ball,
real consistent, can beat the block
and hits the ball real hard. He's
one of the reasons we win."
While such an assessment may
surprise some, it's hardly a
newsflash to his peers. "It
surprises me when he doesn't put
the ball away," said Blackman
who has been close friends with
Forsyth since the seventh grade.
For his deceptively powerful at
tacks, Forsyth acquired "Clubby"
— a derivation of "Clubber" —
as a nickname that has stuck since
his freshman year. The name has
become a rally cry for some of
his more ardent Phi Delt support
ers in the stands who can often
be heard screaming the appela
