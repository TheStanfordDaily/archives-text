# Track takes on top competition
## Stanford faces the nation's best at the famous Texas Relays 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
The Texas Relays, one of the largest track and
field events in the country, if not the world, begins
today, and 25 Cardinal athletes begin competition.
They will arrive in Austin at various times, as the
meet will span over four days, lasting up to 16
hours per day.
How big is this meet? Let some of the team
members tell you:
Long jumper Marcus Hickerson — "It's a big,
big, big, big meet. One of the biggest."
Sprinter D'Layne Kerr — "It's a really big deal."
Bill Crowley, distance runner — "It's a great
meet, the next biggest after Penn Relays."
Hurdler Kyle Coachman — "Some hellaciously
big teams will be there."
Chryste Gaines, sprinter — "There will be a lot
of fast teams."
Fast teams indeed. Host Texas, LSU, Georgetown,
SMU, Arkansas and Florida are among the vaunted
track and field titans that will clash forces on Aus
tin's oval.
"This is the first really fast competition we will
have this year," said Gaines, whose events include
the open 100-meters and the anchor leg of the four
by 100 meters relay. "We don't get top competition
all the time."
With most of the Southwest Conference, South

east Conference, Big East Conference and Pacific 10
Conference showing up, there should be no shortage
of quality competition.
Although Gaines, one of the quickest sprinters
in the NCAA, said that top-level competitors push
her to run faster, she was not as certain about her
less-experienced teammates. She said that her relay
team's performance will depend mainly on how her
teammates "react under pressure." referring t(vthe
pressure to perform against such competition and
also in front of 30,000 spectators.
"It's big, crowded, the stands are packed, and
everybody's staring at you," she said. "And they
will talk about you," she added.
Gaines should know. The sophomore grew up in
Texas and has run at the Relays since she was a
junior in high school.
"Chryste is kind of a Texas Relays legend down
there," said Hickerson, who has had some success
himself. Last year at the Relays, Hickerson recorded
a personal record in the long jump, the same event
he will be competing in this year
Despite the daunting competition, certain events
promise success for the Cardinal, particularly the
men's middle distance relays — the distance medley,
the four by 1500-meters and four by 800-meters.
Various combinations of Crowley, Jim Cramton,
David Strang, and Mark and Eric Mastalir will be
running these events.
