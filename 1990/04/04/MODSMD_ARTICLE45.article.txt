Cardinal 7

49ers 2

According to Stanford Coach
Dick Gould, the win, which moved
the No. 1-ranked Cardinal to a
record of 14-0, was especially
meaningful after the arduous Ar
izona road trip.
"We had solid matches from the
guys who will be playing against
USC and UCLA [this upcoming
weekend]," Gould said. "I was
pleased with the way they con
centrated, especially after the
tough Arizona trip and with the
start of school and everything."
Freshman Jonathan Stark, who
recently was ranked No. 2 in the
country by the Volvo Ten
nis/Collegiate Rankings, out
rallied Derek Farren at No. 1
singles 6-3, 6-1. "[Farren] hits the
ball extremely hard, but he's a
hot-and-cold player. I just worked
on keeping the ball in play. I
thought if I did that, he would
miss. He did," Stark said.
Junior Alex O'Brien, who
moved to No. 10 in the rankings,
followed suit, downing Vince
Mackey 6-4, 6-2.
At No. 3 singles, Jeff Cathrall
played within himself, scoring a
6-3, 6-4 win over Marco Redaelli.
"Jeff played a smart match. Not
only was he able to dictate the
pace of the ball, but he also dic
tated the tempo of the points.

Sometimes he doesn't do that as
well as he did today," Gould said.
"Jeff also was very effective
today in mixing up serving and
volleying with his basic baseline
game."
Junior Glenn Solomon scored
perhaps the most impressive win,
bageling Nader Farsyi at No. 4
singles 6-0, 6-0. "[Faraji] plays a
similar game to mine," Solomon
said. "I was just a little more pow
erful. I was able to attack on every
point. The points were basically
there for me to take, and, luckily,
I executed well."
At No. 5 singles, Jason Yee
came back from a slow first set
to beat Scott Potthast 3-6, 6-1,
6-3.
Senior John Connolly was not
as lucky at No. 6 singles. Up 3-1
in the second set, Connolly had
an asthma attack. He only won
one more game in the next two
sets, losing the match to Long
Beach State's Bill Pham 6-4, 6-0.
"With all the pollen in the air,
I had some trouble breathing, es
pecially in the second set," Con
nolly said. "But I don't want to
take anything away from the way
[Pham] played. He deserved to
win today. I made a lot of mis
takes. He didn't."
In No. 1 doubles, Cathrall
teamed with Yee to blast by
Redaelli and Mike Phipps 6-4, 6-1.
"They played a solid match, espe
cially Jeff. [Cathrall] served ex
tremely well," Gould said. "And
Jason came on strong in the sec
ond set."
The 49ers' pair of Farren and
Mackey overpowered O'Brien and
Dan Turbow at No. 2 doubles 7-5,
6-3. According to Gould, O'Brien
and Turbow had trouble commu
nicating throughout the match.

At No. 3 doubles, Barry Ric
hards and Roman Sydorak came
back from a slow start to down
Potthast and Pham 6-3, 6-3.
"Both of us started off the match
consistently holding serve, but

then Coach [John] Whitlinger told
us to start staying back [on their
serve]," Sydorak said.
With the victory, the Cardinal
extended its dual meet winning
streak to 24 matches. The biggest
threat to the streak will come this
weekend when Stanford sqaures
off against No. 8 UCLA and No.

11 use.
"The matches against UCLA
and USC should be really tough.
It never really matters if one team
is having a down year or another
team is playing well. They are
always tough matches," said Ric
hards, captain of the this year's
squad.
