# Memories of national championship season will be hard to equal
## 
### 
The first story I wrote about Stan
ford women's basketball was the
toughest. Juniors Celeste Lavoie
and Tammy Svoboda had just quit the
team and it was my job to cover it.
To open the season, the Cardinal played
the Spanish National Team and after the
game ended I called Jennifer Azzi over
and asked her to talk about Lavoie and
Svoboda's decision. She said "It hurts,"
but then added, "I don't think they'll
find better teammates anywhere.
As the team savors their first-ever na
tional championship this week, it's clear
how right she was. Stanford may have
a number of superb talents on its roster,
but the NCAA crown would be residing
somewhere other than here were it not
for the way the players came together
this season.
By focusing exclusively on the team
concept, the Cardinal was able to over
come adversity, bounce back from defeat
and outlast the rest of the field. It has

been a magical, mystical season for the
team and everyone around it — myself
included.
In my time at Stanford, there have
been sports-related moments that will be
with me forever.
Men's basketball stunning No. 1 Ari
zona two years ago. Paul Carey taking
Ben McDonald deep for a grand slam to
keep baseball alive in the College World
Series. Brad Humpheys stopping Gaston
Green cold to preserve a victory over
UCLA in the Gator Bowl year.

None of them have diminished in my
mind, but they also no longer hold the
place closest to my heart. I hardly knew
Todd Lichti. I've talked to Paul Carey
once. If I ran into Brad Humphreys, I
doubt I'd recognize him.
As the women's basketball season prog
ressed, though, I found myself becoming
friends with several members of the team.
Sometimes there was a nagging feeling
that my journalistic integrity was in
jeopardy as a result.
But I was fortunate. It's easy to write
great things about Jennifer Azzi, Sonja
Henning, Katy Steding, Trisha Stevens
and so on because they are all great
players. You don't have to cover the sor
did, seemy side when there is none to
cover.
Like a lot of things about Stanford,
the women's basketball program here is
almost too good to be true. There is an
endless supply of talent. The coaching

staff is magnificent. The team wins. The
players graduate on time.
And, if none of them ever hit a jump
shot again, they would all be immensely
successful because they are intelligent,
charming, dedicated and motivated.
When I leave this place in June, I hope
to be writing sports professionally. 1 know
it will never be as easy or enjoyable as
it has been this year covering women's
basketball.
Nor will it be as rewarding. From the
time I typed in that first story on the
computer, I have grown tremendously as
a writer. As the team came together and
began to get excited about the stretch
run, I got excited along with them.
After they clinched a spot in the Final
Four, I went up to a number of players
to offer my congratulations. The first
question from virtually all of them was:
"You get to go with us. Right?"

It gave me a sense that I belonged.
Somehow, in some small way, I was a
part of things. Not a significant, irreplce
able part, but a part nonetheless. Again,
the objective journalist was getting
drowned out by the emotion.
Again, it did not matter. After the team
defeated Auburn in the final game, I took
a step back and wrote one of the best
stories of my brief career. Sure, there
was a dash of Stanford fan mixed in. But
the story was unquestionably profes
sional.
It has been wonderful to have people
tell me I've done a good job covering the
team this season. Yesterday, I heard the
same thing from Azzi and Coach Tara
VanDerveer. That was especially wonder
ful.
