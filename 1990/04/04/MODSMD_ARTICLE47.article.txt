Student Affairs asks for
student feedback on budget cuts
With 20 percent to cut from its $10 million
budget, Student Affairs is asking for the input
of undergraduate and graduate students.
In a letter mailed yesterday to 13,000 students,
Provost James Rosse reminded them "that no
final decisions have been made at this time on
making changes to specific student programs and
services."
Rosse mailed the letter on behalf of the Uni
versity Repositioning Steering Committee, which
must cut $22 million from Stanford's operating
budget.
One of the largest cuts has targeted Student
Affairs, including Residential Affairs, Campus Af
fairs, the Career Planning and Placement Center,
Cowell Student Health Center and Tresidder
Memorial Union.
In the letter, Rosse asked students to become
involved in the decision-making process by ap
proaching staff members and directors of student
services with suggestions involving reduction or
elimination of services, as well as ways cuts could
be implemented. He added that students can sub
mit ideas directly to him.
The task force charged with Student Affairs
cuts must submit recommendations to the Steer
ing Committee in early May.
Pro-choice group to hold rally
The Stanford Pro-Choice Alliance will host a
multicultural celebration tomorrow at noon in
White Plaza as part of a National Day of Campus
Pro-Choice Action.
The celebration will include dance, song and
poetry, as well as letter writing and the kickoff
of a nationwide voter registration drive.
The event is being co-sponsored by the National
Abortion Rights Action League and the California
Progressive Student Alliance, among other
groups.
Recyclers now take magazines
The Stanford Recycling Center is now accepting
magazines at its Pampas Lane drop-off center.
Barb Voss, Recycling Center coordinator, said

she hopes members of the community "will take
advantage of this opportunity to protect the en
vironment . . . especially with Earth Day celebra
tions happening in just a few weeks."
The center hopes to collect at least 150 tons
of magazines annually.
Professors to study homeless
Homeless children and adolescents in Santa
Clara and San Mateo counties will be the focus
of a Stanford study.
The study — conducted by the Center for the
Study of Families, Children and Youth — is being
funded by the Walter Johnson Foundation with
the assistance of the Hewlett Foundation.
"The devastating consequences of prolonged
homelessness, especially on those most vulnera
ble, the children, require that solid facts be known
so that leaders can build effective programs,"
said Georgia Tracis, representing Santa Clara
County's Help House the Homeless program.
The study aims to develop valid and reliable
information about the situation of homeless
families and children in the two counties, about
the homeless children themselves beyond the
usual emphasis on their parents, and about home
less youth between the ages of 13 and 18. This
last group is less likely than younger children to
be part of a homeless family, less likely to use
shelter facilities and more likely to engage in
deviant behavior.
The study is being headed by Sociology Prof.
Sanford Dornbusch.
Professors become Sloan fellows
Four Stanford professors have been selected
to receive Sloan research fellowships for young
scientists, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has
announced.
The professors, among 90 nationwide from 50
universities and colleges, will receive $25,000 each
for a two-year period. The professors are the
following:
Faruk Gul, an assistant professor in the Grad
uate School of Business; Robert Staiger, an as
sistant professor of economics; Russell Lyons, an
assistant professor of mathematics; and Thomas
Schwarz, an assistant professor of molecular and
cellular physics.
