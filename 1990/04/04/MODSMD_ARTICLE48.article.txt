# Education professor receives major grant

Stanford Education Prof.
Henry Levin has one solution to
the nation's education crisis â€”
and he now has the funding to
put it into action.
Levin was recently awarded a
$1.45 million grant from the
Chevron Corporation for his re
search on better methods of
teaching at-risk elementary-school
students.
The award, announced by Chev
ron on March 21 in San Francisco,
will give Levin much-needed
funds to expand research on his
Accelerated Schools Project.
The project, first implemented
in 1987 at Hoover Elementary
School in Redwood City, attempts
to bring at-risk elementary-school
children up to par with their peers
by using innovative teaching tech
niques.
Levin said that traditional
methods, such as isolating the
children and teaching them at a
slower pace than their classmates,
are actually detrimental to the
students' growth. Instead, he sup
ports an accelerated program,
much like the ones used to in
struct gifted children.
"Someone must always be mon
itoring the progress. It is impor
tant that we work closely with
[the children] every day," Levin
said.
The logistics of the project itself
are quite simple. The project will
not expand directly to the schools,
Levin explained. Satellite centers
around the country will control
regional distribution of Levin's
new teaching techniques.
The money will be divided be
tween the Stanford headquarters
and four regional training centers

around the country. The regional
centers will each receive $180,000,
while the headquarters will retain
$729,000.
The funds kept at headquarters
will be used to provide technical
support and training for the staff,
to produce a newsletter detailing
the status of the program, and to
research various aspects of the
program itself, Levin said.
The program has already been
implemented in 40 schools nation
wide, including 25 schools in Illi
nois, nine in Missouri, three in
Salt Lake City, three in California,
and several others across the na
tion.
Because of increased competi
tion among the many programs
seeking to improve the nation's
schools, Levin's program cannot
rely on federal support from the
Department of Education. Private
corporate awards such as Chev
ron's are vital to the financial suc
cess of the project, just as state
and local governments are key to
its implementation.
Given the intense debate now
raging about the future of Amer
ica's educational system, a com
prehensive program to make
America more competitive world
wide is being demanded by the
nation's top educators.
However, Levin indicated that
this concern is misplaced. "Our
best students do as well or better
(than the top students of other
countries). The ones that go
abroad to universities have no
trouble coping with the level of
academic work," he said.
Efforts need to be directed
toward the welfare of all of Amer
ica's students, not merely toward
the prodigies, he added.
