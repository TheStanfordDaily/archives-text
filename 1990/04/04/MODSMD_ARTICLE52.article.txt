# Green's periodicals to stay in basement
## 
### Michelle Campos Staff writer 
Due in part to student, staff
and faculty protest, the periodi
cal and reference sections of
Green Library will remain in
tact, the Faculty Senate Com
mittee on Libraries and
University Libraries officials
have decided.
Library officials last month
proposed moving the periodi
cals from the basement to the
first floor reference section to
accommodate Special Collec
tions, which was displaced by
the Oct. 17 earthquake.
Students, faculty and staff
objected to the relocation, ar
guing it would shrink available
references by 30 percent.
Opponents of the proposal
also argued that while only a
few people use Special Collec
tions weekly, many hundreds
of students and faculty fre
quent the periodical and refer
ence sections daily. Concerned
library patrons circulated a pe
tition to block the proposal and

presented it to University Li
braries Director David Weber.
Director of Special Collec
tions Michael Ryan said the
senate committee and library
officers considered, in addition
to the petition, the cost, time
and difficulty involved in mov
ing the periodicals to the first
floor.
The committees rejected the
proposal and decided instead to
expand the area on the third
floor where Special Collections
is now located.
"The committees looked at
all the alternatives and for all
kinds of reasons. Everyone
decided the third floor was the
best option," Ryan said.
Weber was optimistic that
the expansion will be com
pleted by this fall.
Special Collections was pre
viously located in Green Libra
ry's west wing, which was
severely damaged by the earth
quake. Restoration of the west
wing is expected to take three
years.
