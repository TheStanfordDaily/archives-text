# A
						prancing pony provides nourishment
## Computer vending machine offers chili, bagels and soft drinks

Even from the outside, the inn
looked a pleasant house to familiar
eyes. . .. The door was open and
light streamed out of it. Above the
arch there was a lamp, and
beneath it swung a large
signboard: a fat white pony reared
up on its hind legs. Over the door
was painted in white letters:"The
Prancing Pony by Barliman But
terbur. "
— J.R.R. Tolkien, "The Fellow
ship of the Ring"
In Tolkien's world, travelers
stopped at the Prancing Pony to
nourish themselves before
heading into the dreaded Mordor,
an evil land of ash and smoke.
Stanford's Prancing Pony was
designed with the same task in
mind — but it is a charge-by
computer vending machine, and
the "travelers" are seeking
nourishment before they confront
other, less friendly computers.
The Prancing Pony is located
in the third-floor kitchen of the
Computer Science Department in
Margaret Jacks Hall. It sells
everything from soft drinks and
chili to fresh bagels and cookies.

The machine does accept change,
but most who use it charge their
purchases to their accounts.
There is a small keyboard at
tached to the upper corner of the
vending machine. A user types in
what he or she wants; the com
puter opens the door for the cus
tomer to remove the item and
then adds the purchase amount
to the user's monthly total. At
the end of the month users receive
a bill, usually by electronic mail.
The charge accounts are for
those who spend a great deal of
time in the Computer Science De
partment — mostly faculty, staff
and graduate students. There are
almost 400 Prancing Pony ac
counts, but about half are now
inactive, according to Pony man
ager Martin Frost. The machine
has been in operation nearly 20
years.
The Prancing Pony was de
signed in the 1970s in Stanford's
Artificial Intelligence Lab, then lo
cated six miles from campus on
Arastradero Road. The system
was meant to provide lunch as a
convenience for those who worked
there.
"People couldn't just run across
to the Poli Sci Cafe or to Tresid
der," says Frost.

At one time the ma
chine also sold beer;
if a customer was un
derage, the display
would read, 'Sorry,
kid.'

The idea of a charge account
vending machine is quite novel,
according to Les Earnest, who de
signed the original software for
the Prancing Pony. When it was
first developed, the system re
ceived national attention, and ven
ding machine companies sent out
representatives to look at the
Pony.
However, "it was immediately
apparent that they didn't know
what computers were about," says
Earnest.
Nothing ever developed from
those visits.
In addition to dispensing food
and charging and billing accounts,
the program also likes to play
games. Approximately one out of
every 128 purchases will be free.
If you are the lucky winner, the

computer will ring a bell in the
kitchen.
You could also choose to venture
into a little gambling by telling
the computer you'd like to bet
double or nothing when you place
your order.
"You've got a 50-50 chance,
much better odds than you'd get
at Reno," says Frost.
At one time the Prancing Pony
also sold beer, according to Ear
nest. It was available only on cred
it, and if the customer was un
derage, the keyboard display
would read, "Sorry, kid."
Since the Artificial Intelligence
Lab moved into the Computer Sci
ence Department 10 years ago, the
Prancing Pony has switched its
focus from lunch to snack foods.
However, the machine is so
popular that it needs to be stocked
four times a day.
Volunteers operate the enter
prise, buying and stocking the
goods. Because the Prancing Pony
is run as a cooperative, prices are
kept to a bare minimum.
A Coca-Cola is only 35 cents,
but if you'd rather have a Pepsi
from the other machine, the
Prancing Pony will give you
change on credit. But beware —
the Pepsi will cost you 70 cents.
