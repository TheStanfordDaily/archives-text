# Tresidder to accept meal cards
## 
### Aaron Thode Staff writer 
The same meal card that until
now has restricted students to
culinary delights like Wilbur
"mystery meat" will now entitle
them to treats including Caesar
salad, espresso and frozen yogurt
— with the inception of a pilot
program allowing students to buy
food on credit at the Coffee House
using their meal cards.
The program begins next Mon
day and will continue until the
end of the quarter, when Tresid
der Union will decide whether to
continue and expand the service
to its other food stores.
After paying a minimum of $25
to University Food Service, par
ticipating students will receive a
corresponding credit amount on
their card. They can make pur
chases at the Coffee House until
their "account" runs out.
The cash credit account will be
kept separate from the normal
Food Service meal record, which
cannot be used to buy meals at
Tresidder. There will be no refund
or carryovers for any unused
credit at the end of the quarter.
Tresidder and Food Service
have been working on this project
since November. Mary Clark, of
Bon Appetit Food Catering, which
operates Tresidder food services,
said that both organizations hope
the program succeeds.
"We don't know what the
demand will be, but I think this
program is a big asset to stu
dents," she said, adding that the
system could eventually allow stu
dents greater flexibility and vari
ety in their meal plans.
For example, Clark said, a stu
dent who would normally buy a
15 meal-a-week plan could buy a

'We don't know what
the demand will be,
but I think this pro
gram is a big asset to
students.'

10-meal plan instead, placing the
difference in cost on a credit ac
count, gaining a greater variety
without any extra expense.
However, these possibilities will
never occur unless the current
pilot program is deemed a success.
And according to Lois Ohms, as
sistant Food Service representa
tive, only 10 students had created
accounts as of Monday.
If students wish to test the new
service, they should sign up at
the Food Service office at Pampas
Lane as soon as possible, Clark
advised.
