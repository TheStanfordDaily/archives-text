# Many events slated for Earth Week '90

### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
To gear up for Earth Day 1990,
Stanford will be bombarded with
events aimed at raising environ
mental consciousness.
Indeed, the week before the
April 22 event has been dubbed
Earth Week.
Monday, April 16 will be Energy
Day. Students plan to set up a
clothesline in White Plaza to dem
onstrate how easy it is to hang-dry
clothes. Also, people will be en
couraged to get into the habit of
turning off lights and appliances
when they are not being used.
On Tuesday, a display in White
Plaza will show what things can
be recycled in honor of Recycling
Day. Students also plan to make
a sculpture out of the paper they
gathered from the lower floor of
Memorial Auditorium after one
Sunday Flick last quarter. The
sculpture will demonstrate how
much paper — in this case, 60
pounds — students waste without
even thinking about it.
Students planning events for
Wednesday's Water Conservation
Day faced the problem of how to
show how to conserve water with
out wasting it. People will be en
couraged to take "eco-showers,"

in which they turn off the water
while they lather up, and to turn
off the faucet while they are
brushing their teeth.
On Thursday's Transportation
and Emissions Day, students will
be displaying a "styrocar," a car
made from styrofoam collected
from garbage cans.
Friday's Toxics Day will feature
an outdoor shower in White Plaza,
and students will demonstrate
which products are environmen
tally safe. In addition, there will
be a big vat of toxic-looking stuff,
a "toxicade" stand.
Also on Friday many students
are expected to participate in the
environmental fast which takes
the general recommendations of
fered by Earth Day 1990 organi
zers and brings them closer to
home.
Saturday will be Outdoor Day.
People will be urged to do projects
around the community. There will
be a big game with an Earth ball
— a huge blue and green beach
ball — on Wilbur Field.
Then, Sunday will be Earth Day
1990. There will be a Fun Run
from the Oval, where a ceremony
will be held in the morning, to
Frost Amphitheater, where there
will be a campus-wide Earth Day
rally.
