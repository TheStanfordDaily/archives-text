In what promises to be a truly exciting presentation, Boyd Paulson, the
Ohbayashi Professor of Engineering, will present an overview of large
scale field construction (highways, urban skyscrapers, tunnels, and dams)
as a potential application area for advanced automation and robotic
technologies. In this popular talk he will also focus on trends in research
and development in the U.S. and elsewhere and their relationship to civil
engineering and computer science research at Stanford.
