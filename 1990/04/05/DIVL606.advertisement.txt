SCREENING
Aii elevated cholesterol level may be a nsk factor for early onset heart
disease Waiting until you are 40 or 50 to check your cholesterol is probably
unwise, studies of young men who died m the Vietnam War showed that
many already had significant cholesterol deposits in their artenes Lowenng
of the blood cholesterol by dietary means is believed to lower one's chances
of heart disease Therefore, knowing your cholesterol level is a good tlung l
Who should get tested? Probably everyone should at least once It normal
(below 200), it need not be repeated more often than every five years Men
are more at nsk than women, and women on birth control pills may be at
higher nsk than others Students of either sex who have obesity, high blood
pressure, a family history of early heart disease, or are smokers, have a
greater nsk as well
How do you get it? Fingerstick screens are available at many locations,
although the accuracy of such screens has been called into guestion If you
donate blood, a cholesterol level —as well as an HIV antibody screen is
automatically done without charge Screening is also available at Cowell, for
$20, you will receive a test for total cholesterol (after a 12 hour fast), a
discussion of the results, information on how to change your diet, and a
medical referral if indicated
Is fasting really necessary' 5 Cor screening purposes probably not However
d fasting specimen is somewhat more accurate, and when paying $20. you
might as well go for accuracy
What about HDL, LDL, and triglycerides — what are they, do I need them
and will they be measured for $20? HDL means high density lipoprotein
This is the "good cholesterol, and the higher it is the better off you are HDL
is higher in women and in those who exercise LDL means low density
lipoprotein it is the most harmful kind of cholesterol, and should be below
140 The tnglycendes wax and wane, depending on how recently you have
eaten The equation is Total cholesterol - HDL + LDL + Tnglycendes/5
The cholesterol is not broken down on the initial $20 screening test, and if
your test is under 200 it is not necessary to break it down If the level is
between 200 and 240. and you have any of the nsk factors mentioned above
