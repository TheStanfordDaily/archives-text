"CAMP CHALLENGE GAVE ME
THE CONFIDENCE TO SUCCEED."
If you have ever wanted to experience military
training without enlisting, Basic Camp at Fort Knox,
KY, is your choice.
My prior exposure to anything military consisted
solely of images from the media. I went to Camp
Challenge because I wanted to experience Army
training first hand. During the six weeks, I rappelled
from a 60 foot tower, led a platoon of forty people, and
learned that drill sergeants aren't so bad after all.
For student convenience classes are now
offered on campus, preparing students for
success! Find out more, call Larry Hall or Tom
Weissmiller at (408) 554-4781 collect.
