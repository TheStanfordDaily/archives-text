# Workers OK contract, ending Webb dispute
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
In an unprecedented farm labor agree
ment, Webb Ranch workers yesterday voted
overwhelmingly to accept a contract giving
them control of their housing and a 15 to
30 percent wage increase.
Marking the end to a yearlong deadlock
with Webb Ranch owners, the workers
voted 23-1 to ratify the five-year contract,
which will provide the workers with new
and upgraded housing. In addition, the
agreement stipulates that Webb Ranch
must recognize the seniority of workers in
hiring and layoff practices and give the
workers greater control over farm produc

of what crops to plant.
The contract is the result of direct ne
gotiations between Webb Ranch and the
United Stanford Workers, which has rep

housing.

Worker housing has been the largest con

to completely eliminate the housing units
last November. The Webb proposal would
have given each worker $300 to help
resettle away from the ranch.
Under the new contract, ranch owners
will give up control of the housing to a
tenant corporation composed of ranch
workers, who will be in charge of the main
tenance of the housing facilities. Workers
will no longer have to pay Webb Ranch 75
cents per hour for rent charges.
The workers' tenant corporation, how
ever, will charge minimal rent and use the
money to bring the housing into accordance
with county and state housing codes, with
some funds from Webb Ranch. Meanwhile,
the USW will look to the University and
other sources for additional funds to build
new housing.
One possible source of funds is the Com
munity Action Agency, a local organization
that uses federal funds to construct and
