# Workers OK contract, ending Webb dispute
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
In an unprecedented farm labor agree
ment, Webb Ranch workers yesterday voted
overwhelmingly to accept a contract giving
them control of their housing and a 15 to
30 percent wage increase.
Marking the end to a yearlong deadlock
with Webb Ranch owners, the workers
voted 23-1 to ratify the five-year contract,
which will provide the workers with new
and upgraded housing. In addition, the
agreement stipulates that Webb Ranch
must recognize the seniority of workers in
hiring and layoff practices and give the
workers greater control over farm produc
tion, allowing them to take part in decisions
of what crops to plant.
The contract is the result of direct ne
gotiations between Webb Ranch and the
United Stanford Workers, which has rep
resented the workers since last April. Ne
gotiations since then have been deadlocked
on issues of wage increases and worker
housing.

Worker housing has been the largest con
cern of the USW since Webb Ranch decided
to completely eliminate the housing units
last November. The Webb proposal would
have given each worker $300 to help
resettle away from the ranch.
Under the new contract, ranch owners
will give up control of the housing to a
tenant corporation composed of ranch
workers, who will be in charge of the main
tenance of the housing facilities. Workers
will no longer have to pay Webb Ranch 75
cents per hour for rent charges.
The workers' tenant corporation, how
ever, will charge minimal rent and use the
money to bring the housing into accordance
with county and state housing codes, with
some funds from Webb Ranch. Meanwhile,
the USW will look to the University and
other sources for additional funds to build
new housing.
One possible source of funds is the Com
munity Action Agency, a local organization
that uses federal funds to construct and

upgrade low-income housing. Last
spring, the agency offered to up
grade the Webb Ranch housing at
no cost to the ranch, but the offer
was refused by ranch owners.
"This contract is for real,"
United Stanford Workers attorney
Jim Eggleston said. He attributed
the success of the negotiations to
"the resolve and solidarity of the
workers" as well as "the Stanford
community uniting behind the
workers and saying, 'We won't
stand for this situation on our
campus.' "
The 237-acre ranch, located off
Alpine Road near Interstate 280,
is on land owned by the Univer
sity. Last month, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy threatened
to evict the Webbs from the land

unless significant improvements
were made in the deadlocked ne
gotiations between Webb Ranch
and the USW.
The lease between the Univer
sity and Webb Ranch expired last
August. With the acceptance of
the contract, the University is
more likely to negotiate a new
lease with the ranch.
Ernesto Alvarado, a member of
the legal assistance department
for the Mexican Consulate, called
the agreement "wonderful. Now
[the workers] will be treated like
human beings." The ranch
workers sought the help of the
Consulate in the dispute.
Provisions were added to the
contract before the vote yesterday
that would allow non-working
family members aged 21 and over
to remain on the ranch and to
pay tractor workers for time spent
working in the field as well as on
the tractor.
