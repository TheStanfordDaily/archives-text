Li asserts strength
BEIJING (AP) — A confident, smiling Pre
mier Li Peng asserted yesterday that China's
leadership is united and strong and that the
public does not want a renewal of the massive
pro-democracy protests of last year.
Li s comments to reporters were his first
since the protests were crushed last June. Also
yesterday, the Chinese parliament wrapped up
its two-week annual session with measures
calling for freer business practices but tougher
law and order policies.
The 3,000-seat National People's Congress,
which largely rubber-stamps decisions by top
Communist Party and government officials,
also gave final approval to the basic law under
which Hong Kong will be governed after Brit
ain returns it to China in 1997.
Legislators in Hong Kong immediately said
the law was not democratic enough and asked
that it be amended.
Troops in control
AMRITSAR, India (AP) — Paramilitary
troops patrolled a Punjab town today to try
to prevent further violence after a bombing
blamed on Sikh extremists killed 33 people
and enraged Hindus retaliated by killing three
people.
People were confined to their homes by a
curfew imposed on Batala shortly after Tues
day's bombing of a Hindu religious procession.
Police said 33 people were killed and 68
injured when the bomb exploded as about
100,000 Hindus celebrating the birth of the
warrior-god Rama paraded through a crowded
vegetable market. Most of the victims were
Hindus, though some Sikh onlookers were
among the casualties.
Lithuanians heartened
MOSCOW (AP) — Soviet and Lithuanian
officials were heartened today by a more than
three-hour meeting of representatives of the
breakaway republic and a top aide to Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman,
Yuri Gremitskikh, called the meeting Tuesday
night between a Lithuanian delegation and
Alexander Yakovlev, a progressive member of
the Presidential Council and the Communist
Party Politburo, "a positive sign."
It was the first high-level contact between
Lithuania and the Kremlin since the day after
the republic declared itself independent March
11.
Estonian leader scolded
TALLINN, U.&SvR. <AP> - Mikhail Gor
bachev phoned thf president of Estonia today
and sharply cftflmed the Baltic republic's
drive for independence, Estonian media re
ported.
Arnold Ruutel, president of Estonia's Su
preme Soviet parliament, told officii television

generally very angry during the conversation.
In a later radio interview, Ruutel said Gor
bachev criticized Estonia's Supreme Soviet for
declaring the republic an occupied state.
"When I heard of your resolution I was
completely beside myself. You must declare
the resolution null and void. It is an invalid
one," Ruutel quoted Gorbachev as saying.
"It seems to me that I have to introduce
similar measures as those taken in Lithuania,"
he quoted the Soviet leader as saying.
