# Peres claims that he can form coalition

### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres said yesterday he
had enough support in parliament to
form a ruling coalition and requested
a special session to approve the new
government.
Peres refused to name the members
of the proposed government. He said
secrecy was necessary as he tried to
recruit more lawmakers into a broader
government. But radio reports ques
tioned whether the Labor leader ac
tually had the needed votes.
If Peres succeeds, the new govern
ment may move toward accepting U.S.
proposals for starting Middle East
peace talks. Yizhak Shamir's refusal
to accept the proposals led to the fall
of his government March 15.
Peres' Labor Party had accepted
compromise proposals by Secretary of
State James A. Baker 111 for opening
a dialogue with Palestinians as a step
toward Israeli-proposed elections in
the occupied territories.
Conservatives in the coalition gov
ernment that was headed by Shamir
refused to go along, creating an im
passe that led to a vote of no
confidence against Shamir's govern
ment.
Peres notified President Chaim Her
zog that he had succeeded in getting
msyority backing in the 120-member
parliament, or Knesset, to replace the
coalition.
He said he had appealed to the
speaker of parliament to convene the
legislature "as soon as possible."
