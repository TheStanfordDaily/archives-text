# East Germans ask de Maiziere to lead country
## 
### 
EAST BERLIN (AP) - East Ger
many's major political factions agreed
yesterday to ask Christian Democrat
leader Lothar de Maiziere to try to
build a government that will unite this
foundering nation.
The first freely elected Parliament
in the nation's history is to convene
today, and it is certain to formally
approve yesterday's agreement and
charge de Maiziere with forging a
broad governing coalition.
Leaders of the parties that control
the legislature met yesterday and
agreed on a framework for finally put

ting in place a democratic government.
If de Maiziere is successful in bring
ing together groups with differing
ideas on unification with West Ger
many, then the Parliament will recon
vene April 11 and vote on his Cabinet
nominations, said Martin Kirchner, a
high-ranking Christian Democrat.
De Maiziere leads a Christian
Democrat-led alliance that has been
trying to form a coalition with the
left-leaning Social Democrats and a
smaller group of liberal lawmakers.
Although the Alliance for Germany
won the most seats in the March 18

elections, it needs to form a coalition
to ensure two-thirds control of the Par
liament.
Kirchner predicted that a govern
ment may be formed quickly "so that
this nation is no longer devoid of gov
ernment."
The backroom political wrangling
and charges that new lawmakers had
ties to the secret police of the old
Stalinist regime have taken the steam
out of the reunification process.
Coupled with a palpable public ap
athy, the disputes have left East Ger
many an essentially leaderless nation.

Leaders of major political parties
agreed that Parliament will be asked
to charge de Maiziere, who will likely
be premier, with forming a broad co
alition encompassing much of the Par
liament's middle philosophical ground.
That will be followed by the real
debate in meetings this week aimed
at resolving the differences between
the political factions.
The Alliance for Germany led by de
Maiziere favors rapid reunification.
The left-leaning Social Democrats
want a gradual merger of the two
states.
