## Improving the plan 
### 
IT'S A GOOD start.
Using Food Service meal
cards to make purchases at
Tresidder Union and other non
dorm venues is sin idea that has
been kicked around for years and
has been included in the campaign
promises of many an ASSU senate
candidate.
Next Monday, a pilot program
to do just that will go into effect
at the Coffee House.
The program will allow students
to put a minimum of $25 into a
Food Service account, then draw
off that fund by making purchases
at the Coffee House. This account
will be entirely separate from the
meal account; skipping a meal at
the dorm earns no credit for the
Coffee House account.
Moreover, there will be no
refunds or carryovers of unused
credit at the end of the year. It

does not set up the kind of system
that students have clamored for:
one which allows you to miss a
dorm meal you can't attend or
don't like.
Instead, it merely offers you a
credit account at one Tresidder res
taurant; the apparent advantage
being that you can carry less cash
in your wallet. The creators of the
program suggest that students can
buy a smaller meal plan.
This suggestion requires that
students plan in advance to skip a
certain number of Food Service
meals per week, and doesn't offer
anything to the student who hap
pens to miss the occasional dorm
meal.
Still, the fact that Food Service
and Bon Appetit — Tresidder's
caterer — have worked together
to offer this plan is a hopeful sign
that a better system can be
brought about.
