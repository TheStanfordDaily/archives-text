# Unfair to scientists

Commercialism is invad
ing the scientific community,
and Stanford researchers are
paying for it. Or, more specifically,
the University won't pay for it.
Because the cost of some scien
tific journals is skyrocketing, the
University has been forced to dis
continue its subscriptions to some
of the more expensive research
journals.
The purpose of these journals is
to serve the scientific community
by providing a forum for publish
ing research and a resource for
conducting research. But the in
creasing participation of commer
cial publishers has overshadowed
this purpose with a higher calling:
profit.
Stanford, along with other aca
demic institutions, should take
steps to stop this trend that is
hurting researchers and

academicians throughout the coun
try. These institutions must unite
in order to make any long term
impact in the fight against the ri
diculous costs of these
commercially-published journals.
Many alternatives to discontinu
ing subscriptions can be explored.
Universities can establish a system
of interlibrary loans. Although it
would take longer, the journals
would be accessible.
Another possibility would be to
boycott these outrageously priced
journals and present the publishers
with letters calling for lower, more
reasonable subscription rates.
Stanford must take the initiative
and play an active role in remedy
ing this problem, or the high prices
of these journals will slowly take
their toll on the scientific commu
nity.
