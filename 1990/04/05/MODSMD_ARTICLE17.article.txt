Grad students to experience multicultural living

WE ARE PLEASED to see that
The Daily supports the concept
of a graduate multicultural
theme house. We believe the concept is
a good one and we have been working
closely with the members of the
United Graduate Student Alliance to
effect such a program next year.
However, we would like to correct
some omissions and inaccuracies in last
quarter's Daily editorial about the
current Residential Affairs proposal.
First, it is a proposal made jointly by
the Housing Center and the Office of
Graduate Residences. The principle
behind the proposal is the same as
that of the UGSA group, which is to
create a housing and programming

option which would serve the support
needs of all interested minority gradu
ate students and to provide more
opportunities for multicultural educa
tion in the Rains Houses and through
out graduate residences.
Our proposal would create the fol
lowing:
• An option for graduate students (in
Rains, Escondido Village and Crothers
halls) to live in multicultural clusters
Halls with adequate programming
support in all residences,
• A designated building in Rains
which will be called the Multicultural
Theme House to serve as the focal
place for multicultural living for Rains
students and as the hub of multicul-

tural educational graduate activities
within residences at large. The plan
would accommodate as many requests
for theme house participation as neces
sary,
• A plan for setting aside an appro
priate number (five to 10) of exempt
spaces in Rains to be given to those
graduate students who will provide
strong leadership in creating and main
taining the goals of the Multicultural
Theme House and help focus program
ming activities in Rains and elsewhere,
• A plan that could be implemented
for autumn 1990.
We are confident that the proposal
meets the needs identified by the
UGSA and actually expands the scope.

As some of you know, we have just
completed a survey of reactions and
interests of the on-campus minority
graduate students and a select number
of non-minority students regarding a
multicultural theme house option.
The final plan we implement will be
influenced in part by the result of that
survey.
