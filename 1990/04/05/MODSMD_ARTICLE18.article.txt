# Fraternities offer pluralism and diverse experiences
## 
### 
I was disappointed by Dennis Mat
thies' letter in The Daily on April 3
concerning pluralism and housed fra
ternities. Although his emphasis on the
importance of pluralism in today's
world is extremely laudable, the pic
ture he paints of housed fraternities is
absurdly distorted.
Our house, for example, is a synthe
sis of members of diverse races, reli
gions, ideologies and perspectives: we
have Afro-Americans, Chicano/Latino
students, Asian-Americans and Middle-
Eastern-Americans; there are Jews,
Catholics, Protestants and Muslims; we
have conservatives and liberals, Demo
crats and Republicans, and, yes,
feminists (despite Matthies' blatant
implication that only females can be
feminists).
More disappointing than Matthies'

ignorance of the true composition of
fraternities, however, is his ignorance
of his own hypocrisy. He writes —
quite truthfully — of the unique satis
faction that comes from entering into
personalities and points of view that
are "foreign" to him, but asks prospec
tive rushees to reject housed fraterni
ties and remain in residence halls for
four years.
He writes that pluralism is no more
a liberal idea than a conservative idea,
no more a colored idea than a white
idea, but completely forgets that
pluralism is no more a residence hall
idea than a housed fraternity idea.
So you say, Mr. Matthies, that
pluralism requires sitting down at the
table regularly? Well, let me ask, have
you ever once sat at our table? Have
you ever had "the will to sit at a
table" filled exclusively with housed
fraternity members?
As you so eloquently put it, "to
achieve an education in pluralism it is
necessary to absorb an extraordinary
diversity of philosophies and personali
ties." Well, I invite you, Mr. Matthies,
to come sit at our table regularly and

absorb our extraordinary diversity.
