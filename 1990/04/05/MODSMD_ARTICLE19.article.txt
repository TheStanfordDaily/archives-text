# Students First aims to respond to past ASSU issues
## 
### 
In its April 3 editorial, The Daily
called for issues to be the focus of the
upcoming ASSU elections. All members
of the continually-evolving Students
First party would like to echo that call,
since spring elections give students the
chance to be the ASSU's most effective
check.
As soon as the campaign can offi
cially begin according to ASSU cam
paign regulations, we will be talking
about the issues and listening to stu
dents' views on the issues. But until
April 11 rolls around, I think a re
sponse to a few flawed premises of
The Daily's editorial is necessary.

In its opening paragraphs, the edito
rial noted two national and state ex
amples of "dirty campaigning":
Democratic use of the "Where was
George?" questioning tactic during the
1988 presidential campaign, and Cali
fornia gubernatorial candidate John
Van de Kamp's use of newspaper ac
counts undermining his opponent's
record as mayor of San Francisco.
While both strategies can fairly be
termed "negative" campaigning, the
questioning of an opponent's record in
office stands as an essential and ger
mane part of a campaign between two
candidacies.
Students First was created last year
to respond to the ASSU's past record
and to make a brighter future. Our
membership and issue base has ex
panded to better represent the entire
student body.
We also hope they will allow us to
criticize the established record of
ASSU leadership, without being labeled
as "dirty campaigners."
