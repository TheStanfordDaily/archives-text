# ASSU programs may get the ax because of University cuts
## 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
Wielding its figurative fat-trimming
cleaver, the University is slashing the
ASSU budget by 20 percent, and as a
result, the ASSU will cut back on some
programs.
While the cuts will eliminate some pro
grams altogether, they will also serve to
reduce bureaucratic inefficiency and
wasteful spending, many ASSU officers
believe. The cuts will not impact special
fee funding of student groups.
Council of Presidents member David
Brown said the cuts will be selectively
targeted to "retain what students really
like." He added that the COP will ask
for student input on what programs
should be cut.

According to financial
manager Sandra Leal,
the ASSU will receive
$160,000 next year from
Student Affairs. This
year, Student Affairs fun
neled $200,000 to the
ASSU.
In addition to this re
duction in University
funding, Leal said

Student Affairs asked the ASSU to "cut
the expenses you expect to have" by 20
percent. Between the two reductions, the
ASSU must reduce its expenditures by
about $81,000.
Leal said Student Affairs requested the
ASSU trim back the budget funded by
its business income because otherwise
"the students will take up the burden."

The cuts will be selec
tively targeted to 'retain
what students like.'

The ASSU generates about $200,000
in revenue per year from several en
terprises, including Sunday Flicks, Type
and Design, the Ad Agency and Lecture
Notes.
Leal said the reduction in expenses
translates into a reduction of services
offered by the ASSU. She said programs
such as the dry cleaning service, ASSU

News and straw polls will probably be
terminated.
In addition, the Office of Public Affairs
may be consolidated with other ASSU
offices to eliminate some student staff
positions. Other staff positions are
threatened as well, including senate clerk
and assistant financial manager.
However, Torrence Boone, next year's
financial manager who will have to im
plement many of the cuts, sees them as
a "mechanism to boost efficiency, not as
an ultimatum."
"The fat is there, and it's about time
that it gets trimmed," Boone said.
Both Leal and Boone said no salaries
for student workers will be reduced.
Brown said "a significant portion" may
be trimmed from the $20,000 Annual
Discretionary Account. The fund chan

nels money to various "emergency" ex
penses, such as last fall's donation of
$3,000 to the city of Watsonville to help
with earthquake-related costs.
According to Brown, many of the cuts
will not be "across-the-board" but will
be selectively chosen from areas where
there is an "inefficiency of bureaucracy."
Leal and Brown said it was too soon
to tell whether any full time staff posi
tions in the business office will be ter
minated.
Leal added that the cuts will come with
difficulty and are "going to be a fight."
Some expenses will fall on the
shoulders of students in the form of spe
cial fees. "If students want [Lake Lagu
nital, they will have to pay for it," Leal
said.
