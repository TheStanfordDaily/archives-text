# Carrie Chang
## Violence in kindergarten 
### 
IT IS A frightening day when a flip
of a radio switch undoubtedly means
a spewer of filth in your ear, an im
broglio of ungodly guttertalk that instills
the worst in even the best human being.
One has only to look at the crime
infested streets of America and to hear
the foul mouths of American youth to
realize that the moral fabric of American
society is being ripped to shreds. And
the culprit? None other than the radio
sitting in your room at this very moment.
It is comforting to note that the attacks
on America's youth have not gone un
heeded. Oral Roberts revealed the satanic
lyrics of Prince a few years ago, and most
recently, New York's Archbishop John
O'Connor exposed Ozzy Osbourne's
music for the demonic influence that it is.
While both men's attempts to censor
those purveyors of immorality deserve
admiration, there remains something
wholly ineffective in their approach: both
fail to address evil at its root.
We must pause and ask questions such
as, "What drove these teens to buy such
Deviltalk in the first place?" and "If the
tainting of the human soul is a delicate,
gradual process, when and how does this
process begin . . . musically?"
It was with these questions pounding
in my head that I headed down Stanford
Avenue toward the Lucille M. Nixon
Elementary School for an investigation.
Upon entering a kindergarten classroom
unnoticed, I planted a tape recorder be
hind a couple of cans of finger paint and
proceeded to observe the youngsters' be
havior.
The results were not encouraging.

The following is a transcription of my
recording. The more violent lyrics are
omitted or summarized in brackets in
deference to the faint of heart . . .
(beginning of tape)
Good morning boys and girls. Today
we are going to learn how to sing Three
Blind Mice.
Ready? One, two, three .. .
Three blind mice (two times),
See how they run (two times),
They ran away from the farmer's wife,
(Explicitly violent lyric about maiming
already-handicapped mice),
Very good. Now let's sing the one we
learned yesterday.
Rub-a-dub-dub . . .
(Sexually suggestive lyric),
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch
a pail of water,
(Gory lyric replete with cranial frac
tures),
(Song about a suicidal maniac named
Humpty Dumpty),
(Demonic dance ritual called the Hokey
Pokey).
(End of tape)
Observation: The effect of the music
upon the subjects was marked and ter
rifying.
The previously docile 6-year-olds
swayed to the haunting melodies as if
held in a frenzied trance. Glazed eyes
and listless voices — obvious symptoms
of being possessed — were noted among
the subjects. Disruptive and un
wholesome behavior ensued almost im
mediately. Legos were flung and some
subjects fingerpainted "Kiss the devil"
on the walls while they sniffed Play-

dough.
The most noticeable effect took place
in one of the subjects, "Sally." While she
initially appeared serene with her Cab
bage Patch doll, Sally became quickly
entranced by the Hokey Pokey, a dance
ritual which would make the Lambada
seem like a square-dance.
Caught in the thrall of the heathen
melody, Sally "stuck her right arm in,
and then her right arm out," proudly
displaying a Cabbage Patch head sans
hair. She then proceeded to stamp the
doll to pieces.
Horror of horrors. The proof is so in
disputable so as to be chilling. Wait until
the Archbishop finds out he's been
barking up the wrong tree: Forget Prince
or Ozzy Osbourne; the root of youth cor
ruption goes by the code name Mother
Goose.
Trouble is, I don't think she has any
tapes or CD's we can ban.
