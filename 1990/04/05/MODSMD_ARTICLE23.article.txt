## Death penalty usurps inalienable right to life 
### 
ON THE NARROW road leading
to the San Quentin Correctional
Facility, beyond the barricade of
highway patrolmen in riot gear, a sign
reads "Not a through street." The
irony is obvious to the men imprisoned
here: this road leads to nothing but
wasted time.
Last Monday, however, this road led
10 Stanford students to participate in a
vigil for Robert Alton Harris. Harris, a
convicted murderer has survived a
12-year legal war waged in hopes of
keeping him from walking down the
long corridor to the gas chamber.
Just 12 hours before Harris' sched
uled execution, the United States
Supreme Court voted 6-3 in favor of
Judge Noonan's decision which granted
Harris an indefinite stay of execution.
The court upheld the decision in order
to reexamine the competence of the
psychiatrists who testified at Harris'
trial.
Though the execution was canceled,

a diverse group of nearly 300 people,
from the Marxist All People's Congress
to the Episcopalian Church to the
Stanford chapter of Amnesty Interna
tional, protested the death penalty in
speeches and song. Their reasons for
the vigil were as varied as the people.
The Episcopalians, Catholics and
other religious groups protested on the
grounds that killing is a sin; we should
learn the path to forgiveness. They
invited the victims of horrible crimes
to speak; the children of murdered men
and women extolled the cleansing
power of forgiving the murderers.
The All People's Congress, the Spar
tacus League and other labor-oriented
groups see capital punishment as yet
another racist, white bourgeoisie tool
of oppressing the multicultural working
class. To these people, the death
penalty is part of a plot to keep the
working class under the thumb of the
ruling, white upper class.
However, most of the people lighting

the candles for Robert Harris were the
type of educated individuals now
cursed with the title of "Liberal." The
rational, reasonable left expertly
juggled facts and figures with the
dexterity of future politicians.
They cited the 23 innocent people
who were executed. They calculated
the disproportionate ratio between
minorities and whites who receive the
death penalty. They compared crime
rates between states with capital pun
ishment and states without capital
punishment and found no significant
difference. They could find no distinc
tion between those who received capital
punishment and those who received life
in prison without possibility of parole.
Federal Appeals Court Judge Benton
likened capital punishment to a lottery.
Harris might be in jail for killing two
San Diego youths, but his death is a
matter of circumstance. But many
people die arbitrary deaths at the
hands of society, and most of them are

poor, mentally ill or persons of color.
Homeless people freeze, senior
citizens starve or die of loneliness and
thousands of children disappear every
year, yet the government's solutions to
these problems can best be described
as inadequate.
How did these rational people choose
the death penalty to protest?
John Chang, a senior and a member
of Amnesty International, believes,
"There are certain things that go
beyond the tribunal of the ballot box.
One of these inalienable rights is life."
Since capital punishment is no more
effective than life imprisonment, Chang
continues, state executions are not
motivated by self defense. So, capital
punishment violates the right to life.
Freshman Michi Tarall fears the
anarchy capital punishment entails.
"The death penalty doesn't just
involve Robert Harris," Tarall says.
"Your telling people that it's OK, if
you're mad enough, and if you feel

justified enough, to kill people." Yet
the slogan on the back of one
protester's T-shirt said even more. It
read, "Don't Kill For Me."
The protestors feel responsible for
the actions of the state, and they know
that the state is wrong. Yet, I and a
lot of other people there felt a sense of
desperation. How could Robert Harris
live in such uncertainty? Before the
Supreme Court returned its decision,
Harris had already ordered his last
meal.
Can you imagine ordering your last
meal?
