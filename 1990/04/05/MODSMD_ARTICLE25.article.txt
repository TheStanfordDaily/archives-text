## An apology for the work of sports writers 
### 
If you're not sure about where you stand
in the Creation vs. Evolution debate, I
think I've found proof that Darwin was
full of you-know-what.
No, there's no divine inspiration here, no
messages from beyond, no evidence that this
whole (beautiful) mess was created in seven
days. I've merely found something that proves
there's no freaking way we could possibly be
evolving to a higher, more intelligent state of
existence:

Sports writers.
You're all familiar with them, even though
you probably aren't too thrilled about it. The
basic description of them runs pretty much
like a fine portrait of the common cockroach:
They serve no real purpose, but they're always
there. They're annoying, but they never go
away. And they're dumb.
Folks, if this where evolution is taking us,
I want off this little ride right now.
Oh, so you know someone who's a member
of the above-mentioned Fellowship of Foolish
ness? Gee, that's too bad, oops, I mean so do
I. I can explain. Trust me.
As I've said, sports writers have been around
for quite awhile. You know them, you love
them, you wish they could all be locked away
in a room somewhere to hurl mangled metap
hors and atrocious adjectives (not to mention
asinine alliterations) at each other.
The problem here isn't the people, it's the
job description. Being a sports writer too often
means one has to (a) write a lot on a subject
about which one knows very little; (b) criticize
and second-guess players and coaches who, for
the most part, know a hell of a lot more about
what they're doing than does the writer; and
(c) ask really, really stupid questions.
Now, I'm sure there are lots of fine people
who happen to write about sports. Well, maybe.
Anyway, the problem isn't that there are no
intelligent, friendly, hardworking souls in the
field. There are. What's wrong is that when
they (okay, we) stop being Joe Whoever and
start being Joe Writer, intelligence and com
mon sense too often take a holiday.
Take the press conferences during last week
end's women's Final Four. If you've never been
to one of these things, believe me, there's
nothing like a press conference to make you
doubt that humans are a superior life form.
Of course, they're a necessary evil — they
allow writers to ask the dumb questions in
public instead of one-on-one — but that doesn't
make them any fun. Just ask Joe Ciampi,
Auburn's coach.
Ciampi wasn't in the greatest of moods after
the championship game, so one writer decided
to make his day by letting him know he
thought Ciampi had screwed up.
"Why didn't you start shooting threes ear
lier, Coach?" asked the scribe, who apparently
hadn't noticed the three Tiger airballs from
treyland in the final minute.
"When would you have started?" Ciampi
asked back.
"About four or five minutes before you did."
"Then you get yourself a team, 'cause I
wanna play your ass."
Count it! Go to the line.
Now, the dumb question problem is un
avoidable: If I got paid for every incredibly
loopy question I asked ("So, how do you feel?"
"How do you think things went today?"), I'd
be a rich man.
Sometimes a question isn't asked for a spe
cific reason, it's just thrown out (not unlike
garbage) to get someone to start talking. It
makes the writer look like a dweeb but at
least it gets the ball rolling.
And, at least at Stanford, most athletes and
coaches are polite enough to not comment on
the intelligence level of some questions.
I kept reminding myself during the press
conferences, then, that other writers (like me)
aren't completely clueless. They just look that
way sometimes.
Then I remembered that the members of
the media, in their infinite wisdom, left Sonja
Henning off the all-tournament team.
