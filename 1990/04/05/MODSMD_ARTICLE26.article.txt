# Montgomery to remain with Stanford
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
The next time Mike Montgomery
goes to recruit a high schooler to play
basketball here, the kid can be sure
that Montgomery is speaking from the
heart.
After weeks of rumors, Montgomery
announced yesterday that he will be
staying at Stanford. Montgomery was
one of the leading candidates to replace
the retiring Terry Holland at Virginia,
but he decided to take himself out of
the running.
"Basically we're going to make our
stand here at Stanford," Montgomery
said. "I had a chance to take a look
at another program. ... I came away
from that experience with the under
standing I had a great job right where
I am and that I didn't have to go
anywhere else to accomplish what I
wanted to accomplish. It only strength
ened my resolve."

Montgomery said
that he was "just
looking" at the Vir
ginia job because he
felt he wanted to stay
at Stanford. "I knew
all along that there
were some things here
that suited me," he
said. "What I didn't
know was what else

was out there. I needed to know. . . .
It has really helped me to know this
is the best place for Mike Mont
gomery."
Montgomery was in Virginia Sun
day, Monday and Tuesday with his
wife, Sarah. He said that UVA Director
of Athletics Jim Copeland asked him
to stay another day but Montgomery
said no. Copeland then called Mont
gomery yesterday morning, and they
decided Copeland needed to find some
one else.
"When I was deciding to come here

from Montana it was so clear-cut,"
Montgomery said. "Sarah could've
said, 'I'm not going,' and I would have
said, 'See ya.' That was so clear-cut.
This one wasn't clear-cut. Where are
you going to find a campus nicer than
Stanford's? Where are you going to
find better people?
"I told people a month ago that I
just wished they'd get me out of my
misery and say I'm not a candidate.
I just wanted to take an opportunity
to look and make sure this is where
1 wanted to be and I'm sure of that."
Montgomery told his players the
news at a regularly-scheduled meeting
yesterday. The team returns 11 of 12
players and three redshirts and will
add at least one recruit to the squad
that went 18-12 and earned a berth
in the National Invitation Tournament
last season.
"We need continuity here," Mont
gomery said. "We've got great players,
a lot of young players with great po

tential." ,
Those players were in turmoil witn
Montgomery's status up in the air, but
the team is glad to have him back. 1
was hard knowing what to think, said
junior Kenny Ammann, the starting
shooting guard. "You just try not to
think about anything. You don t know
what's going on so you don t know
what to think. I just tried not to wory
about it. , â€ž
"I'm really glad [he's going to stay I,
Ammann continued. "Now we can just
try to keep going as the team we are
and get right into spring ball 1 m
glad the way it turned out."
Junior John Patrick, the starting
point guard, felt the same way. It
feels good to know he's going to bo
back," he said. "I was recruited by
him, worked with him for four y e^ rs
and am used to his system. ... We
have something to prove. Its his team
