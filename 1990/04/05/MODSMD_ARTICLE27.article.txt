# Card off to running start
## Two place well during first day of Texas Relays 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
Yesterday's competition at the Texas
Relays began in the morning but won't
end till this afternoon. The opening days
of the famous meet consist of the multi
event decathalon and heptathalon. The
first five events of both were held yester
day, with good results for the Cardinal.
Peggy Odita has been the most successful
Stanford athlete so far, finishing her first
day of competition in fifth place in the
heptathalon. Though that may sound less
than impressive, in fact, Odita is trailing
second place by only 100 points and has a
good chance of capturing that spot if she
performs up to her potential in today's
events, the javelin, long jump and open
800-meters.
In addition, even with a sub-par per
formance today, Odita should qualify for
NCAAs.
However, she was ambivalent about her
marks in yesterday's events. Overall she
said, "I did okay. I'm five points behind
last year, which is not too bad."
Of the five events, she was most excited
about her shot put distance, which was a
personal record. She was also pleased with
her hurdles J,ime, her fastest this year.
Since she was only .1 seconds behind her
personal best in the hurdles, she added
that she feels she can break that record
easily this season.
However, her 200-meters race was "piti
ful. It was going well until I slipped," she
said.

Odita is trailing second
place by only 100 points
and has a good chance of
capturing that spot if she
performs up to her potential
in today's events.

For her strategy today, she said, "I've
got to get loose and stay aggressive." She
cited the javelin as a good event for her,
and also expects to do well in the 800-
meters. "We've been training a lot for that,"
she explained.
Meanwhile, teammate Jennifer Jauquet
has been able to meet her goals so far.
Though she is in 11th place, Jauquet is
on track to qualify for the Pacific-10 Con
ference meet.
In the decathlon, D.D. Harris has done
quite well, especially considering his first
time appearance in a meet of this magni
tude. He is currently seventh out of 15
competitors with a score of 3746.
His best event yesterday was the long
jump, in which he leapt 22 feet 11 inches.
As Harris is only 64 points behind fifth
place, he could easily capture that spot
today, and might even go higher if he per
forms exceptionally well.
Jauquet will be trying to maintain her
Pac-10 qualifying pace. Odita, who finished
fourth in the hephtaphlon at the Texas
Relays last year, is gunning for at least
second place and an NCAA- qualifying time.
