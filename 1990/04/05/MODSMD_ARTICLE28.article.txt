# Crew season gets under way in San Diego
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
The San Diego Crew Classic marks
the second time this year the Stanford
men's team has raced, but according
to Stanford men's coach Ken Dreyfuss,
this is the traditional start of the col
legiate season. Stanford will be sending
down six boats, three men's and three
women's, to an event that is loaded
with talent.
"This is the strongest field that 1
can remember," Dreyfuss said.
Dreyfuss comment is well supported.
Defending National Champion Har
vard will be there, as will Washington,
last year's runner-up. Stanford got a
reprieve by landing in Washington's
heat instead of Harvard's, but it is a
small break. The Cardinal will also be
racing against perenniel powerhouse
Navy, as well as Syracuse, a team many
consider to be one of the three best
in the country. Temple and Purdue
round out the Cardinal's heat, but it
is not Owls or Boilermakers that the
team is worried about.
"Right now who we are aiming to

beat is Washington, Syracuse, and
Navy," coxswain Quinn Bolton said.
"We need to beat one of those three
schools to get in the final."
The format of the Classic has two
heats of six, with the top three in each
race going on to the grand final. The
rest of the boats have the consolation
of advancing to the small final. Stan
ford is not a shoe-in for a spot in the
grand final, but they are in a good
position, literaly. The Cardinal's lane
position has them rowing with Wash
ington on one side and Navy on the
other.
"We are right in the action with the
boats we need to beat," Bolton said.
Faster crews will push you to go faster.
It is always good to have teams you
want to beat side-by-side."
Good lane position alone will not
win the race, but good practice will,
somthing that the Cardinal has had a
lot of lately.
"We had a tremendous spring vaca
tion," Dreyfuss said. "Over a ten day
period we got in 16 practices. We had
a good chance to work hard and be
come a boat."

Stanford is led by captain Andy Win
den rowing in the fifth seat, and senior
Jason Stinson in the second seat. The
eight man boat is rounded out with
stroke Carmine Rimi, seventh seat Jeff
Collins, sixth seat Zander Packard,
fourth seat Leo Ramos, third seat Pat
Bradley, and bow Kevin McPeek. This
combination has been boated for al
most a month, and Dreyfuss thinks
they are ready to go.
"We are now a racing team,"
Dreyfuss said. "Everyone is racing well
and everyone is looking forward to
this race. We like our line-up and we
like the way we are rowing. It is early
(in the season), but it is early for
everybody."
Including the women's team, third
place finishers at the nationals last
year, the Stanford women's crew is
looking to do even better this year,
and San Diego will provide a good clue
to what the team will have to look
forward to later in the season. Wash
ington, last year's Pacific 10 Con
ferance champions, will be in the Car
dinal's heat, as will Pennsylvania,
seventh in the east last season. Stan

ford will be tested, but they go down
confident of their chances.
"We are confident that we can go
down there and put on a good show,"
Coach John Davis said. "We expect to
go Ito the grand final 1. We have never
not gone to the final."
Davis has reason to be confident.
Even with injuries to senior Katherine
Van Uum, and junior Julie Vanneman,
the Cardinal goes down south with a
boat that the 11th year coach calls
"the most aggresive group I've ever
had." National Team member Audrey
Barnett leads the team at stroke with
a strong boat working with her. Senior
Quentin Story will cox the woman,
with a sophomore transfer from
Brown, Beth Coie, at second seat,
Junior Kelly Emerton at third seat,
Junior Emily Dirksen at fourth seat,
sophomore Bonnie Baker at fifth seat,
and seniors Diane Olson and Laura
Stearns at sixth and seventh seats,
respectively. It is a team that Davis
already considers winners.
"The first place you win is in prac-
tice, and we have been winning
in practice," Davis said. "I'm
really happy with the team's at
titude and the way they work.
They have a championship atti
tude, and that is the stuff of great
ness."
Davis is convinced that his team
has the potential to surpass the
achievments of last year's squad.
Last season Stanford made it to
the grand final, finished dead last,
but rebounded at season's end to
finish third at nationals. Davis
believes this year's team has that
same attitude, saying they have
"hearts of lions," better yet, they
can go faster.

"This year we will have to work,
but if we work we will go faster
[than last year]," Davis said. "We
know we will be good, but if at
the end of the season we haven't
won the whole ball of wax we will
be happy that we met our per
sonal goals."
That, of course, does not rule
out the whole ball of wax, it just
keeps things in perspective. Davis
is confident of team's ability, but
this early in the season is not the
time to be rushing victory.
"I don't think we are ready [to
win at San Diego], nor do we want
to be ready. If we go our fastest
than we are in a lot of trouble,"
Davis said. "We are just glad the
season is here, and we are ready
to race."

place finishers at the nationals last
year, the Stanford women's crew is
looking to do even better this year,
and San Diego will provide a good clue
to what the team will have to look
forward to later in the season. Wash
ington, last year's Pacific 10 Con
ferance champions, will be in the Car
dinal's heat, as will Pennsylvania,
seventh in the east last season. Stan

ford will be tested, but they go down
confident of their chances.
"We are confident that we can go
down there and put on a good show,"
Coach John Davis said. "We expect to
go Ito the grand final 1. We have never
not gone to the final."
Davis has reason to be confident.
Even with injuries to senior Katherine
Van Uum, and junior Julie Vanneman,
the Cardinal goes down south with a
boat that the 11th year coach calls
"the most aggresive group I've ever
had." National Team member Audrey
Barnett leads the team at stroke with
a strong boat working with her. Senior
Quentin Story will cox the woman,
with a sophomore transfer from
Brown, Beth Coie, at second seat,
Junior Kelly Emerton at third seat,
Junior Emily Dirksen at fourth seat,
sophomore Bonnie Baker at fifth seat,
and seniors Diane Olson and Laura
Stearns at sixth and seventh seats,
respectively. It is a team that Davis
already considers winners.
"The first place you win is in prac-
tice, and we have been winning
in practice," Davis said. "I'm
really happy with the team's at
titude and the way they work.
They have a championship atti
tude, and that is the stuff of great
ness."
Davis is convinced that his team
has the potential to surpass the
achievments of last year's squad.
Last season Stanford made it to
the grand final, finished dead last,
but rebounded at season's end to
finish third at nationals. Davis
believes this year's team has that
same attitude, saying they have
"hearts of lions," better yet, they
can go faster.

"This year we will have to work,
but if we work we will go faster
[than last year]," Davis said. "We
know we will be good, but if at
the end of the season we haven't
won the whole ball of wax we will
be happy that we met our per
sonal goals."
That, of course, does not rule
out the whole ball of wax, it just
keeps things in perspective. Davis
is confident of team's ability, but
this early in the season is not the
time to be rushing victory.
"I don't think we are ready [to
win at San Diego], nor do we want
to be ready. If we go our fastest
than we are in a lot of trouble,"
Davis said. "We are just glad the
season is here, and we are ready
to race."
The San Diego Crew Classic marks
the second time this year the Stanford
men's team has raced, but according
to Stanford men's coach Ken Dreyfuss,
this is the traditional start of the col
legiate season. Stanford will be sending
down six boats, three men's and three
women's, to an event that is loaded
with talent.
"This is the strongest field that 1
can remember," Dreyfuss said.
Dreyfuss comment is well supported.
Defending National Champion Har
vard will be there, as will Washington,
last year's runner-up. Stanford got a
reprieve by landing in Washington's
heat instead of Harvard's, but it is a
small break. The Cardinal will also be
racing against perenniel powerhouse
Navy, as well as Syracuse, a team many
consider to be one of the three best
in the country. Temple and Purdue
round out the Cardinal's heat, but it
is not Owls or Boilermakers that the
team is worried about.
"Right now who we are aiming to

beat is Washington, Syracuse, and
Navy," coxswain Quinn Bolton said.
"We need to beat one of those three
schools to get in the final."
The format of the Classic has two
heats of six, with the top three in each
race going on to the grand final. The
rest of the boats have the consolation
of advancing to the small final. Stan
ford is not a shoe-in for a spot in the
grand final, but they are in a good
position, literaly. The Cardinal's lane
position has them rowing with Wash
ington on one side and Navy on the
other.
"We are right in the action with the
boats we need to beat," Bolton said.
Faster crews will push you to go faster.
It is always good to have teams you
want to beat side-by-side."
Good lane position alone will not
win the race, but good practice will,
somthing that the Cardinal has had a
lot of lately.
"We had a tremendous spring vaca
tion," Dreyfuss said. "Over a ten day
period we got in 16 practices. We had
a good chance to work hard and be
come a boat."

Stanford is led by captain Andy Win
den rowing in the fifth seat, and senior
Jason Stinson in the second seat. The
eight man boat is rounded out with
stroke Carmine Rimi, seventh seat Jeff
Collins, sixth seat Zander Packard,
fourth seat Leo Ramos, third seat Pat
Bradley, and bow Kevin McPeek. This
combination has been boated for al
most a month, and Dreyfuss thinks
they are ready to go.
"We are now a racing team,"
Dreyfuss said. "Everyone is racing well
and everyone is looking forward to
this race. We like our line-up and we
like the way we are rowing. It is early
(in the season), but it is early for
everybody."
