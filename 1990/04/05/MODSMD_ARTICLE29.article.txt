# Synchro dunks competition for second
## 
### 
For the fourth year in a row
Stanford was edged out by Ohio
State for the national synchro
nized swimming title. The second
ranked Stanford club team came
up short to the Buckeye varsity
dynasty after the women of Ohio
State took first in four out of the
five events.
Stanford senior and four-time
national team member, Karen
Madsen highlighted the Cardinal
performance with a championship
spot in the solo event and a close
second in the compulsory figure
event. Madsen teamed up with
Melinda Downey to take third in
the duet event, a mere one-tenth
of a point behind Ohio State's duet
of Debbie Urlich and Cheryl
Weigand, and less than a half a
point behind the first place Buck
eye team of Maria Guisti and
Cheryl Shemanour. Stanford sen
iors Debbie Brear and Ginny
Cohn followed with a fourth in
the duet event.
We had great swims in duet, as

well as in the other events. We
were especially solid in finals."
Downey said. The point spread in
all events was so slim that al
though our placings were disap
pointing, we were confident with
our performances."
Cohn also teamed up with Mad
sen and Downey for a silver in
the trio event, and Brear added
another fourth in trio with soph
omore Michelle Ghert and fresh
man Mandy Blake. In the team
event, Blake, Brear, Cohn,
Downey and Ghert earned the
bronze, finishing behind Ohio
State only because of a 1.5 point
bonus received by the Buckeyes
for having a full squad of eight
swimmers.
We had a great meet and swam
extremely well," Madsen said.
"Unfortunately the champion
ships were held at Ohio State and
the judging was very political. It's
something we have to deal with
in our sport. We did the best we
could under the circumstances."

Although it was difficult to
compote with the disadvantage of
subjective judging, the team felt
that the routines were swum ex
ceptionally well and that the meet
was definitely a success. Team
spirit was high and many swims
were personal bests.
Ohio State synchronized swim
ming is a varsity program with
several full scholarships and an
extensive recruiting and training
program. Although Stanford
synchro, coached by Andy Maisel
and Vickey Weir, has only Varsity
111 status, the program is verv
strong, due to the talent and ex
perience of the swimmers.
The loss of the graduating sen
iors Brear, Cohn and Madsen will
force the team into a rebuilding
stage where Ohio State will bo
less threatened. Nevertheless, the
team has a strong base to build
from and Stanford synchronized
swimming hopes to own the na
tional crown in the near future.
