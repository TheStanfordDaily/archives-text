Stanford Police yesterday ar
rested a man suspected of imper
sonating a Cardinal basketball
player in order to deceive Stanford
students and burglarize their
rooms.
The suspect, Ralph Innachic
Sanders, 22, was caught in Palo
Alto after a six-month investiga
tion by Stanford Police detective
Tim Frecceri.
During this time, numerous
campus residents, mostly female.

found checks and other personal
items missing from their dor
mitory rooms after being visited
by the 6-foot-8-inch Sanders,
Frecceri said The checks were
forged and cashed for $200 to
$300 soon afterward.
"He would wander into un
locked or open rooms," said Frec
ceri. "When he saw people, he
talked politely, used various
names and said he was redshirting
for the basketball team."
Since November, nine burgla
ries of this nature on campus have
been reported to the police, and

forged checks were cashed all
along the Peninsula from San
Jose to San Francisco.
"In many cases, he basically
came up to young females, gained
their confidence and got invited
into their rooms," said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Sanders would allegedly claim
often to recognize female students
from classes or to know their
dormmates in order to start a con
versation.
Sanders was arrested at 8 a.m.
yesterday in Palo Alto outside the
home of his girlfriend, a graduate
student, Niemeyer said. According
to Frecceri, the girlfriend had no
knowledge of his criminal activi
ties and was "traumatized" by the
revelation.
The police began an investiga
tion last year when it became ob
vious that the same man had
struck several times.
All the students who had con
tact with the burglar positively
identified Sanders in a photo
spread.
Sanders was convicted of check
forgery late last year at Foothill
College, where he was enrolled as
a student and reportedly played
basketball. He was placed on a
yearlong court probation for that
crime.
Later, Sanders allegedly opened
an account in Mountain View
using the identification of
Theodore Godfrey, a man with
whom he played basketball. In
Godfrey's name, he withdrew
$4,400 illegally from the bank
San Jose State University police
had also identified Sanders, a man
they said was hanging around the
campus and was perhaps enrolled
under another name.
Frecceri credited his "real
break" in the case to a campus
source â€” an unnamed faculty
member who was able to find out
where Sanders lived.
A 16-count arrest warrant for
Sanders was issued March 20. He
was apparently on his way to class
in San Jose when he was arrested
yesterday.
