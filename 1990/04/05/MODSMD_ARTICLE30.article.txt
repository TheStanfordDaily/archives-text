# Sailors keep afloat during tough regattas
## 
### Debbie Cordon 
Stanford sailors showed un
precedented depth weathering six
tough regattas around the nation
during spring break. Although
Seattle and Boston were not the
balmy locales many others chose
to spend their break, the Cardinal
sailors were tough through snow
and intense competition on the
water.
The week began with North Se
ries 5 at Berkeley on Saturday,

March 24. North Series 6, sched
uled for Sunday the 25th, was
cancelled due to high winds. With
the A team of Dave Dowd and
Matt Dunbar and B team of Rick
Rosen and Louis Kofsky, Stanford
took second to host Berkeley. Cal's
win pulled them into a tie with
Stanford in the North Series.
North 7 and 8 Alameda — taking
place this weekend across the Bay
in Alameda — will most likely
determine the series.
On the other coast, braving ex

treme temperatures and forty
degree water, Stanford sailed
strongly in the Boston College
Spring Invite, hosted by BC at
MIT. Stanford, with team Robert
Brown and Kim Gross competing
as A and Matt Sanford and
Deborah Claymon in the B divi
sion, finished fourth out of four
teen, behind the top three teams
Brown, University of Rhode Is
land and MIT. The day was high
lighted by Sanford/Claymon's sec
ond place finish in the B division.

Sunday at MIT brought a
seventh place finish for the Stan
ford women's team in the Emily
Wick Women's Regatta. The com
petition was won by Tufts, the
new No. 1 women's team. The
Cardinal's A team of Kim Gross
and Robin Powers and B team of
Haley King and Marina Kimball
sailed tough, recording strong
performances although sailing in
strange boats through strange
weather. The weekend proved to
be a successful warm-up for the
following competitions.
For the Stanford women, March
31 and April 1 at Tufts marked
the intense Duplin Trophy and
competition with the best female
sailors in the nation. Starting out
slowly, King and Marina and Kim
ball and Gross with Ivey left Bos
ton with great finishes in both
divisions, taking eighth out of
eighteen. Coming in unranked,
Stanford upset ranked Charles
ton, St. Mary's, Rhode Island and
Michigan.
While the women sailed at
Tufts, the Stanford coeds contin
ued to battle in Larks and Techs
on the freezing Charles in the
oldest collegiate dingy race in the
nation, the Boston Dinghy Cup,
hosted by MIT. After a week of
practice in the northeast cold and
snow, A teams Robert Brown/
Susannah Mapes and Matt San
ford/Deborah Claymon, and B
team Rick Rosen and Rebecca
Bryson struggled to find consis
tency in the tough competition.
Coach Blake Middleton agreed
with team members, saying "This
is the toughest competition of the
year. Nationals won't be this
tough." However, Rosen and
Bryson highlighted the regatta for
Stanford taking fifth in B divi
sion.
