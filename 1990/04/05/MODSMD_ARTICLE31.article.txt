# Awards keep coming for freshman swimmer
## 
### 
Janet Evans needs to buy an
other mantel.
There can be no doubt that
the mantel at her home is al
ready covered with awards too
numerous to mention. Now she
has to find room for one more
as the Pacific 10 Conference
announced today that she is
the Pac-10 Women's Swimmer
of the Year.
The award comes three
weeks after the Stanford fresh
man was named the winner of
the Sullivan Award, the na
tion's most prestigious
amateur award. Evans followed
that up by being named the
outstanding swimmer at the
NCAA Championships.
Evans won three events at
the NCAA meet, helping the
Cardinal to a second-place
finish. She broke her own
American record in the 1,650-
yard freestyle, broke Tracy
Caulkins' American record in
the 500 freestyle and broke

Caulkins' NCAA record in the
400 individual medley.
She also made up more than
two seconds on the anchor leg
of the 800 freestyle relay to
pull out that race for the Car
dinal.
Evans and teammate Janel
Jorgensen were the high-point
scorers at the NCAA meet as
each scored 60 points.
Evans and Jorgensen also
tied for high-point honors at
the Pac-10 Championships,
Feb. 23-25 in Monterey Park,
Calif. Evans won the same
events there as she did at the
NCAA meet, setting Pac-10
meet records in the 1,650 free
style and the 400 IM.
She also swam the second
leg on the Cardinal's winning
800 freestyle relay squad.
In addition to the 500 free
style, the 1,650 freestyle and
the 400 IM, Evans broke the
school record in the 1000 free
style earlier in the season.
