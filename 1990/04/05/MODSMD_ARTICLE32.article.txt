# Everything you wanted to know about the Women's Final 4
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
What a week it has been for
Stanford women's basketball, the
1990 NCAA champs. One last look
at some notes from Knoxville,
Tenn. and the Final Four . . .
Jennifer Azzi was named to the
Kodak All-America team for the
second consecutive season. In
sharp contrast to last year when
Azzi was the only junior on the
squad, five non-seniors earned
All-America honors this time
around:
Sophomore guard Daw n Staley
of Virginia, junior guard Carolyn
Jones of Auburn, junior center
Wendy Scholtens of Vanderbilt,
junior center Daedra Charles of
Tennessee and junior guard
Andrea Stinson of North Carolina
State.
The seniors other than Azzi

were center Portia Hill of Stephen
F. Austin, center Dale Hodges of
St. Joseph's, center Venus Lacy
of Louisiana Tech and forward
Franthea Price of lowa.
Asst. Coach Leslie Crandell was
concerned that with all the atten
tion being focused on Auburn's
pressure defense, Stanford players
might forget to crash the boards
in Sunday's championship game.
As a reminder, she posted 150
signs in the team's hallway that
read "Rebound." Apparently it
worked, as the Cardinal out
rebounded the Tigers 49-36.
Dollie Emily Mackenzie was
stunned Friday when her mom
showed up at the arena. She had
no idea Nickie Mackenzie was
making the trip from San Fran
cisco to Knoxville.
The Auburn mascot provided
the best laugh of the Final Four
when he did an imitation of the

Energizer bunny during one of
the Dollies' routines.
Both tournament and single
session attendance records were
set at the Final Four. At the 1986
Final Four, held in Austin, Texas,
15,615 tickets were sold for each
session — a total of 31,230. This
year, semifinal ticket sales total
19,467 and a total of 20,023 tick
ets were purchased for the final.
Overall, there were 39,490 tick
ets sold. The record is impressive
considering that host Tennessee
failed to make the Final Four.
Texas was a participant in 1987.
On the bus ride from Knoxville
to Oak Ridge, Azzi announced
over the P.A. system, "Up on the
left is my junior high. We were
50-0 in basketball . . . Up ahead
is the elderly home."
Freshman Molly Goodenbour
chimed in from the back of the
bus: "Is that who you played?"

Sunday's victory gave Tara
VanDerveer a 114-38 record at
Stanford, good enough for a .750
winning percentage. The .750 is
higher than her overall percent
age, which currently stands at
.749, for the first time since she
was 1-0 as the Cardinal's coach.
In order to accomodate CBS,
the Final Four will be played on
Saturday and Sunday next year,
i.e. there is no off day between
games. The event will be held in
New Orleans at the Superdome.
In men's basketball, schools
making the Final Four received a
payout of roughly $1.4 million.
Stanford, Auburn, Virginia and
Louisiana Tech each got roughly
$35,000 for reaching the women's
Final Four.
The most notable rule change
approved for the women's game
next year is that players will be
awarded three free throws when

they are fouled in the act of shoot
ing from behind the three-point
arc. An overwhelming 88 percent
of players, coaches and adminis
trators associated with women's
basketball said they approved of
the current 19-foot-9, three-point
distance.
Stanford is hoping to sign a
recruit for next season during the
upcoming spring signing period.
Among the notables in attend
ance at the championship game
was Dean of Admissions Jean Fet
ter.
Because the game was not a
sellout (the arena seats over
24,000), it was blacked out locally
in Tennessee. Still, there were
enough fans in attendance to out
number the residents of Aiken,
S.C., the hometown of Chris Mac-
Murdo. Julie Zeilstra had said
the crowd was three times the
size of Vernal, Utah.
