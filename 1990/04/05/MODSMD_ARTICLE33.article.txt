# ASSU airport shuttle takes off
## 
### Todd Schneider 
Due to the growing popularity
of the Council of Presidents' Air
port Shuttle, COP members wish
to make the program permanent
by establishing it as an ASSU Spe
cial Project.
The shuttle has become one of
the most popular student services
in less than a year of operation,
according to COP member David
Brown.
The shuttle chauffeurs students
to and from the San Francisco
and San Jose airports at the be
ginning and end of each quarter
for a price of $5.
COP member Aimee Allison,
who heads the operation, esti
mated that more than 1,100 stu
dents used the shuttle before and
after winter break, and more than
300 used it at spring break.
The shuttle, a campaign prom
ise of the COP, has been financed
solely by the fares it collects and
has usually been left with "a cou
ple hundred [dollars'! padding for
the next quarter," said Allison.

Because of the program's suc
cess, COP members want to en
sure it lasts after they leave office.
In May, they will propose a bill
to the ASSU Senate to make it a
Special Project, like the ASSU T-
Shirt Shop.
Last quarter, the shuttle had a
student coordinator, freshman Mi
chael Almodova, who worked with
Allison. If it became a Special
Project, however, the ASSU would
hire a full-time coordinator to be
paid from the shuttle's funds.
The COP hires drivers, and
sometimes COP members donate
their time to chauffeur. Though
they use the STOP Safe Trans
portation Program van, they have
also needed to rent vans in order
to transport students. Brown said
he hopes the ASSU will purchase
a van, which would be used by
the shuttle service, Haas Public
Service Center and other students
groups.
Even with ASSU budget prob
lems, Brown thinks the shuttle
will make enough money to pur
chase a used van by next year.

"If the ASSU owned the van, any
student could drive, instead of just
students 21 and over [for insur
ance reasons]," he said. In fact,
Allison is the only COP member
not allowed to drive a rented van
because she is too young.
The shuttle picks up riders in
front of Lagunita Court and Tres
idder Union and between Stern
and Crothers Halls.
Freshman Adam Cohen partic
ularly liked the convenient pickup
locations. He had used Airport
Connection before, which only op
erates from the Oval, but when
he used the shuttle service, he
"could take home stuff I wouldn't
ordinarily because I didn't have
to carry it to the Oval." He also
liked that it cost only $5, com
pared with $12 for Airport Con
nection.
However, Allison said the price
would probably rise to $6 this
quarter to increase funding.
The COP plans to run the
shuttle at the end of this quarter,
and it might even have runs after
graduation.
