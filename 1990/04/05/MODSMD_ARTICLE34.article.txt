# Tree-planting project planned

Imagine being surrounded by
the exotic environs of Australia,
Chile, Southern Africa and the
Mediterranean. Sound enticing?
A long-range plan to trans
form Campus Drive into a
"botanical parkway" may well
bring tastes of these far-away
places home to the Farm.
The idea is the outcome of
two years of collaboration be
tween the University Planning
Office and the Stanford Center
for Conservation Biology.
As envisioned by parkway
planners, the Campus Drive
Botanical Parkway will display
trees and shrubs from five of
the world's Mediterranean
climate zones — regions similar
to Stanford in that they receive
winter rains but have dry sum
mers.
The project has both practical
and educational aims, as it will

implement a landscape appro
priate to* Stanford's drought
ridden climate and provide a
unique opportunity for students
and the community to study
plant development.
A formal kickoff for the proj
ect, "Celebrating Biological Di
versity at Stanford," is slated
for 11 a.m. Wednesday, April 11,
at Campus Drive and Lomita
Avenue near the Mausoleum.
Fifteen oaks, bay laurels and
buckeyes native to California
and an unusual Chilean tree will
be presented for planting, and
Biological Sciences Prof. Paul
Ehrlich will give an address.
In addition, the program will
acknowledge John and Susan
Boething, owners of Boething
Tree Farm, whose contributions
have supported the project's de
velopment. The tree farm grows
trees commercially on land
leased from Stanford in the hills
adjacent to campus.

According to project manager
Charles Carter of the Planning
Office, the University is not
funding the botanical parkway
project. But at the same time,
it will "evolve in association
with roadway and other im
provements of Campus Drive,"
he explained.
Changes in the appearance of
Campus Drive will not be im
mediately recognizable. Carter
said changes will occur
gradually over a period of many
years, fulfilling the Planning
Office's general goal of "develop
ing a landscape appropriate to
Stanford."
Much of Campus Drive is al
ready populated by oaks native
to California, which the project
will supplement with donated
trees and shrubs as landscape
improvement is needed.
The parkway will be divided
into six zones showcasing trees
