Rabushka issues Israel scorecard
Alvin Rabushka, senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, has issued "Scorecard on the Israeli
Economy: A Review of 1989," a comprehensive
assessment of Israel's economic policies during
1989.
Rabushka's scorecard assigned the following
grades to the seven economic policy areas:
• Budgetary policy: D-,

• Tax Policy: D,
• Money and Capital Markets: C-,
• Business: B-,
• Price Control: D-,
• Labor Markets: F, and
• International Trade: C-.
"On balance, 1989 was a dismal year for the
Israeli economy," Rabushka said. "Most economic
indicators signaled a steadily weakening economy
throughout the course of the year. Nor did the
government make truly substantial progress in
adopting economic policies to lay the foundation
for a renewal of long-run growth."
Rabuska's report is scheduled for annual pub
lication.
