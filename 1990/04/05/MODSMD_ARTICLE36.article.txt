## Becoming Giants Singer speaks on crazy duo 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
For a long time, the strongest word in the
name "They Might Be Giants" was "Might."
Sure, the quirky duo released albums and
videos which were .. . amusing. But commer
cial; Well, with songs like "Chess Piece Face"
and "Puppet Head" and dizzying, low-cost
videos, They Might Be Giants seemed far from
mainstream popularity. The band is so bizarre,
they even maintain their own Dial-A-Song
phone line (718-387-6962) with a new song
each day.
But a funny thing happened on the way to
clever obscurity: They Might Be Giants hit the
right note. Elektra Records helped the band
escape from an independent label. "Birdhouse
In Your Soul," the first song off of their newest
album, "Flood," skyrocketed up college charts.
Spin Magazine lauded the duo's "boundless im
agination and a gyroscopic sense of what makes
a pop tune click." And a European tour included
a television appearance that reached over 12
million viewers.
The newfound fame of They Might Be Giants
has made it difficult to keep up with their cult
following; the Dial-A-Song tune changes about
every other day now. Is the band finally hitting
the big time? More importantly, is that what
it wants?
Intermission spoke with vocalist and guitarist
John Flansburgh from London.
Intermission: How did you two come to
gether?
John Flansburgh: John [Linnell] and I knew
each other in high school, but it wasn't until
we converged later in Brooklyn that we thought
about forming a band. They Might Be Giants
started in a hobbyish sort of way. Not many
bands start out as unambitiously as we did.
We weren't trying to make a career out of it
and didn't think much about the future as we
did the New York club scene. When we finally
recorded our first cassette, we were happy to
sell 1,000 copies. We just did what we could.
They Might Be Giants is its own project. I
have no idea what Keith Richards and Mick
Jagger were like before the Rolling Stones, but
I don't think we have their bravado. John and
I are more like regular people.
I: Do the two of you share singing and
songwriting responsibilities?
JF We tried to create a band which suited
out own talents best. I guess we share things
about 50-50. But 1 think John has sung on all
of our hit songs. That's kind of a relief, though,
because I never have to sing the last song of
a performance.
I: Your first break into MTV was with the
video for the song "Don't Let's Start," in which
both of you wear enormous fezzes.
JF: "Don't Let's Start" was great because there
was no particular idea or logic behind it. We
weren't shooting for any symbolism or imagery.
It was more like a cartoon; it was interesting
to see how tall of a hat you could make.
I: But most rock bands have a message that
they try to get across.
JF: Yeah, a lot of rock stars make these
didactic, ridiculous statements that probably
should just be ignored. I can't think of a group
of people less likely to be spokesmen for the
world than rock bands.
I'm highly suspicious of musicians who insist
on making political statements. I read a press
release for Annie Lennox of the Eurythmics,
and though 1 have no doubt that she's sincere
about helping Greenpeace, I still think that her
"newfound consciousness" is |ust related to
marketing schemes. Frankly, all of this post-
Live Aid "reality" turns me off.
I: Do you feel that your move to a big label
was a "sell-out?"
JF: I've never felt like a sell-out. On an in
dependent label, you have to face the fact that
you have to do all of the hustling yourself. I
turned into a businessman, not a musician,
and ended up doing a gig at a surfer convention
I think that anyone wants to be successful
in his or her career. Right now "Birdhouse In
Your Soul" is #34 in the U.K. Of course, I'd
like to be higher on the charts, but out of the
33 other songs, I wouldn't want to record any
of them We're happy to make our kind of
music, and nothing else. It's great just to be
able to make records.
