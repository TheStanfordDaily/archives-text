# Altered States
## Hallucinating inside a flotation tank 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to
die? To no longer see, hear, smell, taste, feel. To be
removed from the world.
It may be impossible for us to truly fathom death
while we are alive, but it is possible to move closer
to the line that separates life from death, floating in
the darkness and silence of a sensory isolation tank.
And it may not be as depressing as it sounds. You
may even learn something about yourself.
At the end of last quarter, I pushed the meaning
of Dead Week to new extremes by taking a trip to
Palo Alto's Watercourse Way for one-and-a-half hours
of sensory isolation flotation.
The tank is upstairs in a room with a cot and a
shower. There are bizarre leather masks on the walls.
The sign on the door says simply: Flotation.
It costs $25 for a single hour-and-a-half flotation
session. Before going upstairs to the tank, you have
to sign an agreement that you won't try to heighten
the experience with drugs. Also, you have to agree
to "take responsibility for all of your thoughts and
actions while in the tank." The agreement includes
some other stipulations too, but those two add to
the mystique that anyone who has ever seen the
movie "Altered States" feels about going into a sensory
isolation tank.
The woman who showed me to the tank room
told me to dab Vaseline on any cuts I might have
so the salt would not burn them. She told me to
wear earplugs. She said I could use a floating pillow
if I wanted to and added that she would come up
and knock on the door of the tank when my time
was up.
The tank was horizontal and rectangular and
smaller than I expected. I shed my clothes and took
out my contact lenses and decided not to use the
pillow. I opened the door of the tank, took a deep,
nervous bieath and stepped into the nine inches of
salty, 94-degree water. I stretched my legs out in
front of me, closed the door and let the darkness
and silence surround me. The salt in the water
\ buoyed me up and I began to float.
I could see a square of light around the door of
the tank and only after the experience was over did
I realize it would have been better to have turned
out the lights in the room. Instead, I just closed my
eyes. My breathing was loud.
I felt the slight pressure of the water on my body
but, arms out, legs extended, floating, that was all
1 could feel. My made noises now and again
and occasionally the water made « uiuckmg sound,
near my ears. But that was all I could hear except
for my breathing, which was softer and more regular
now, and my heartbeat.
I expected to hallucinate and began to feel some
what disappointed when I didn't. I tried to think
back on my childhood and my life to see what I
could remember. As I thought back, I saw images
of myself in whatever situation I remembered. I could
never remember exactly what it was like for me to
actually look out from my eyes during the situation.
I could never get back into my own head. My memory
worked as an omniscient narrator, removed, showing
me myself and the others around me.
This made me wonder what it would be like if
someone made a movie in which we never see the
L-.

narrating character, the camera acts as the eyes of
the character and we see the whole world through
his or her eyes. Other characters react to the camera
as they would to the narrating character, but that is
a character the audience never sees. It's like doing
a whole movie from the same perspective that the
cinematographers use in the scuba scene in "The
Graduate."
Mostly, while I was in the tank, I thought about
the things I normally think about. It was like
daydreaming, only I was very conscious that I was
thinking.
I had decided that, after I got out of the tank, I
would just write in a notebook for 10 minutes, what
ever came into my head. So now, a part of my mind
was working to remember the different impressions
that I had so that I could record them later.
At first, the thought that I would be getting out
of the tank and recording my ideas anchored me. I
think it was this idea, always in the back of my
mind, that I would be getting out of the tank that
kept me from really experiencing what death must
be like. There is a big difference between not seeing
and not hearing and not being able to see or hear.
With my eyes closed, I thought about the blackness.
Darkness. A make-believe wall between me and what
I knew was out there. Blankness. But a wall I knew
I had the power to control and tear down at any
time. I tried to find the words to describe it, but
realized there is no way to really describe blackness.
It is just something you can refer to and, if they try,
people can relate to what you say and understand
what you mean in some small way.
Now, my breathing seemed loud again. It w*» <
huqaid m the tank. I tried to breathe evenly I even
held my breath. Then, all I could feel was the pressure
of the water on my body. It was eerie. My mind was
clear.
The strangest part of the tank experience was that
I lost all track of time while I was floating.
I was nervous about what might happen, so I
brought a friend with me and he waited outside the
room while I was in the tank. He came in and rapped
on the door of the tank when I had 30 minutes to
go. Later, he came in and rapped on the tank when
I had 10 minutes to go. It was a complete surprise.
The time between his first knock and his second
knock — 20 minutes — seemed as long as the time
between when I first entered the tank and his first
knock — 60 minutes.
I did not fall asleep in the tank, but I remember
drifting off in thought and starting to shake The
thought came into my head that 1 was whipping my
body back and forth like a fish. At another point, I
curled up like a child without really knowing why
or willing myself to do so.
Fragments of different ideas that I had been think
ing about recently raced through my mind at times.
At other times, I would become incredibly conscious
of my surroundings and my thoughts, a sign that I
may not have been actively thinking or that I had
been thinking in some different way immediately
beforehand
After I overcame my initial anxiety about the tank
experience, I felt relaxed, confident and serene. When
my friend knocked on the tank door and told me I
had 10 minutes to go, I was glad the experience was
over in some ways and, in other ways that I cannot
quite explain, I wished that it had not ended

go. Later, he came in and rapped on the tank when
I had 10 minutes to go. It was a complete surprise.
The time between his first knock and his second
knock — 20 minutes — seemed as long as the time
between when I first entered the tank and his first
knock — 60 minutes.
I did not fall asleep in the tank, but I remember
drifting off in thought and starting to shake The
thought came into my head that 1 was whipping my
body back and forth like a fish. At another point, I
curled up like a child without really knowing why
or willing myself to do so.
Fragments of different ideas that I had been think
ing about recently raced through my mind at times.
At other times, I would become incredibly conscious
of my surroundings and my thoughts, a sign that I
may not have been actively thinking or that I had
been thinking in some different way immediately
beforehand
After I overcame my initial anxiety about the tank
experience, I felt relaxed, confident and serene. When
my friend knocked on the tank door and told me I
had 10 minutes to go, I was glad the experience was
over in some ways and, in other ways that I cannot
quite explain, I wished that it had not ended
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to
die? To no longer see, hear, smell, taste, feel. To be
removed from the world.
It may be impossible for us to truly fathom death
while we are alive, but it is possible to move closer
to the line that separates life from death, floating in
the darkness and silence of a sensory isolation tank.
And it may not be as depressing as it sounds. You
may even learn something about yourself.
At the end of last quarter, I pushed the meaning
of Dead Week to new extremes by taking a trip to
Palo Alto's Watercourse Way for one-and-a-half hours
of sensory isolation flotation.
The tank is upstairs in a room with a cot and a
shower. There are bizarre leather masks on the walls.
The sign on the door says simply: Flotation.
It costs $25 for a single hour-and-a-half flotation
session. Before going upstairs to the tank, you have
to sign an agreement that you won't try to heighten
the experience with drugs. Also, you have to agree
to "take responsibility for all of your thoughts and
actions while in the tank." The agreement includes
some other stipulations too, but those two add to
the mystique that anyone who has ever seen the
movie "Altered States" feels about going into a sensory
isolation tank.
The woman who showed me to the tank room
told me to dab Vaseline on any cuts I might have
so the salt would not burn them. She told me to
wear earplugs. She said I could use a floating pillow
if I wanted to and added that she would come up
and knock on the door of the tank when my time
was up.
The tank was horizontal and rectangular and
smaller than I expected. I shed my clothes and took
out my contact lenses and decided not to use the
pillow. I opened the door of the tank, took a deep,
nervous bieath and stepped into the nine inches of
salty, 94-degree water. I stretched my legs out in
front of me, closed the door and let the darkness
and silence surround me. The salt in the water
\ buoyed me up and I began to float.
I could see a square of light around the door of
the tank and only after the experience was over did
I realize it would have been better to have turned
out the lights in the room. Instead, I just closed my
eyes. My breathing was loud.
I felt the slight pressure of the water on my body
but, arms out, legs extended, floating, that was all
1 could feel. My made noises now and again
and occasionally the water made « uiuckmg sound,
near my ears. But that was all I could hear except
for my breathing, which was softer and more regular
now, and my heartbeat.
I expected to hallucinate and began to feel some
what disappointed when I didn't. I tried to think
back on my childhood and my life to see what I
could remember. As I thought back, I saw images
of myself in whatever situation I remembered. I could
never remember exactly what it was like for me to
actually look out from my eyes during the situation.
I could never get back into my own head. My memory
worked as an omniscient narrator, removed, showing
me myself and the others around me.
This made me wonder what it would be like if
someone made a movie in which we never see the
L-.

narrating character, the camera acts as the eyes of
the character and we see the whole world through
his or her eyes. Other characters react to the camera
as they would to the narrating character, but that is
a character the audience never sees. It's like doing
a whole movie from the same perspective that the
cinematographers use in the scuba scene in "The
Graduate."
Mostly, while I was in the tank, I thought about
the things I normally think about. It was like
daydreaming, only I was very conscious that I was
thinking.
I had decided that, after I got out of the tank, I
would just write in a notebook for 10 minutes, what
ever came into my head. So now, a part of my mind
was working to remember the different impressions
that I had so that I could record them later.
At first, the thought that I would be getting out
of the tank and recording my ideas anchored me. I
think it was this idea, always in the back of my
mind, that I would be getting out of the tank that
kept me from really experiencing what death must
be like. There is a big difference between not seeing
and not hearing and not being able to see or hear.
With my eyes closed, I thought about the blackness.
Darkness. A make-believe wall between me and what
I knew was out there. Blankness. But a wall I knew
I had the power to control and tear down at any
time. I tried to find the words to describe it, but
realized there is no way to really describe blackness.
It is just something you can refer to and, if they try,
people can relate to what you say and understand
what you mean in some small way.
Now, my breathing seemed loud again. It w*» <
huqaid m the tank. I tried to breathe evenly I even
held my breath. Then, all I could feel was the pressure
of the water on my body. It was eerie. My mind was
clear.
The strangest part of the tank experience was that
I lost all track of time while I was floating.
I was nervous about what might happen, so I
brought a friend with me and he waited outside the
room while I was in the tank. He came in and rapped
on the door of the tank when I had 30 minutes to
go. Later, he came in and rapped on the tank when
I had 10 minutes to go. It was a complete surprise.
