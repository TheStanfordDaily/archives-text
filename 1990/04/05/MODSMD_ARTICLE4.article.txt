# 'I didn't suspect anything'
## 
### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
When sophomore Trisha
Mizushima walked into her
dormitory, a tall young man
wearing a Cardinal cap ap
proached her.
The man said he was looking
for someone, mumbled a name
and then followed her to her
room. "He seemed friendly and
harmless," Mizushima said, al
though he "flirted pretty
strongly."
Mizushima's roommate
walked in and joined the con
versation. and the man said he
played basketball with Adam
Keefe. "He was talking politely,
and then he said he recognized
me from a class," her room
mate said. "I didn't suspect
anything."
After a few minutes of con
versation, all three left the
room, leaving the door un
locked. It was not until several
days later that the roommates
noticed the absence of a check
book.
He is a red shirt basketball
player from Beverly Hills, a
human biology miyor who has

friends in every dorm.
The ideal Stanford student?
An experienced con man,
rather, whose string of lies and
successes reflect more on the
trusting nature of his victims
than on his abilities, said police
who have worked on the case
for six months.
The alleged con artist, Ralph
Sanders, apprehended yester
day, was sometimes not alone
in rooms that were burglarized.
At one place on campus, a soph
omore was studying in her
room when Sanders came in
and spoke to her.
Sanders spent 20 minutes in
her room, walking about and
talking to her. "It was all very
random," she said afterward,
but she was not suspicious un
til later, when she used an ATM
machine only to find $600
missing.
Sophomore Kurt Lindsay
also found Sanders in his room.
He said he was somewhat sus
picious of the man, but echoing
the sentiments of many vic
tims, he did not feel comfort
able confronting someone who
appeared to be a Stanford stu
dent.
