## Plant album not 'Nirvana' 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
Robert Plant shows off his mas
tery of the moan in his latest of
fering, "Manic Nirvana." It is a
good enough album, but it is noth
ing special.
And, like many of Plant's cuts
(he co-wrote most of the album's
tracks), the lyrics often revel in
their sexism.
The first offensive track, "Hurt
ing Kind (I've Got My Eyes on
You)/' began receiving heavy
airplay immediately, probably pri
marily because it was Plant who
recorded it. A standard top-40 hard
rocker, it contains the (unfor
tunately) usual frightening lyrics
about the privileged male gaze.
Plant's grunts of "I've got my eyes
on you" sound like a prelude to
hunting some women down.
And the next song, "Big Love,"
brings phallic celebration to new
heights of idiocy. While Plant
groans "She loves my big, she loves

my big," his backing male vocalists
shout like savages.
After this track, the self
professed big lover settles down to
churn out some decent tunes.
None of the 11 tracks will be con
sidered classics, though almost any
of them could be released as
singles. "I Cried," "Nirvana" and
"Your Ma Said You Cried In Your
Sleep Last Night" stand out from
the rest of the pack.
The last of those three is an
interesting remake of an obscure
'60s song. In a post-modern twist
on the age of perfect digital record
ing, Plant intentionally dubbed in
some surface noise to create the
authentic sound of a dusty old
record. Another nostalgia trip on
the album is "Tie Dye on the High
way," a homage to Woodstock
which is mediocre at best.
Plant also quotes the Led Zep
pelin classic "Black Dog" in "Your
Ma Said You Cried In Your Sleep
Last Night", a stunt he has pulled
on other albums. Why he would

want to raise the comparison be
tween his decent solo career and
perhaps the greatest hard rock
band of all remains a mystery.
Another mind-boggier is the
meaning of the quasi-Buddhist
motif in his album titles: "Manic
Nirvana" follows 1988's "Now and
Zen."
In short, "Manic Nirvana" is a
good-but-not-great album with a
fair number of potential hit tunes
played by solid studio musicians.
Of course, it has its flaws.
For Plant, though, the album
does rank among his top solo of
ferings.
