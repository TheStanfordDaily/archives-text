# Who 'join' for boxed set
## 
### Ari Richter Staff writer 
When The Who announced their reunion
concert tour last year, critics of the band
said that the band members were too old
or out of practice and would most likely
put on a bad show. Critics also demeaned
the motives of the bandmembers, citing
greed as the sole reason for the tour.
And didn't their 1984 tour produce the
album "Who's Last?"
Well, the critics were unable to keep fans
from packing The Who's shows, including
two benefit performances of "Tommy,"
which sold some seats at $1,000 apiece. In
a year that saw far too many reunion tours,
The Who's performance was a tour de force.
lust released, "Join Together" provides a
wonderful reminder of the tour for those
who were lucky enough to see it, and for
those who missed the show, the collection
offers a well-chosen cross-section of the
Who's powerful concerts across the country.
But don't buy this box set on record or
tape; it can only be fully appreciated on
compact disc. A full digital recording, "Join
Together" includes 34 songs and over 130
minutes of live performances.
Disc one contains most of "Tommy," a
sampling of their New York and Los Angeles
performances. Don't be timid with the
volume. From the beginning of the "over
rare" to the end of "We're Not Gonna Lake
ft," Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey, John
Entwistle and the "12 people it took to
replace Keith Moon," as Townshend joked
at a performance in New Jersey, are a plea
sure to listen to.

Join Together

'foin Together' offers a well
chosen cross-section of The
Who's powerful concerts.

Only an hour long, this rendition of "Tom
my" reflects some splicing by either the
bandmembers or the album's producers. No
song is actually titled "Listening To You/See
Me Feel Me," but "We're Not Gonna Take
It," which runs for almost nine minutes
serves as an ebb and flow between the two
songs.
Significantly, as a live performance,
"Tommy" is masterful; whether or not the
listener cares for the songs themselves is
another issue. As a rock opera, "Tommy"
does contain strained lyrics that try to
preserve the story line, but most such songs
are less than a minute long and are easily
forgotten when listening to "Pinball Wizard"
or "I'm Free."
But the real value of "Join Together" does
not emerge until disc two, a collection of
13 songs performed at various arenas and
stadiums across the country. Seventy
minutes long, disc two contains the 1971
standards "Behind Blue Eyes" and "Won't
Get Fooled Again." The second disc also
offers powerful renditions of "Love Reign
O'er Me," the title track, "Eminence Front"
and the perhaps unknown solo effort of
Entwistle's "Trick of the Light."
