# D'Mode delves deep into dark depression
## 
### John Louie Editorial staff 
Does the new decade mark the
end of doom and gloom?
Since Depeche Mode formed in
1981, the Bntish band has set the
standards for alternative and
modern rock bands. With the ex
ception of "lust Can't Get
Enough," the band is primarily
known for its depressing musical
and lyrical songs, like the suicidal
"Blasphemous Rumours," the sin
ful "A Question of Lust," and the
violent "People Are People."
At a first glance, mass appeal
appears to have altered the dark
declarers of depression. "Personal
Jesus," the first single from their
new album, "Violator," is a spunky
invitation to prayer, religion and
faith. The album's second single,
"Enjoy the Silence," also has a
quick, danceable synthesizer beat.
Yet, "Violator" reaffirms that
there is still dark at the end of
Depeche Mode's tunnel. A closer
look at the first two singles reveals
hints of nihilism and total verbal
censorship. Upbeat drums help to
conceal the minor undertones and
negative lyrics, leading to inter
pretative ambiguity.
However, other songs on

"Violator" display a more explicit
cynicism. "Halo" describes an
apocalyptic prophecy of the near
future. And in an interesting twist
on honesty, "Policy of Truth" con
dones deception. You will always
wonder how/It could have been if
you'd only lied/. . . Hide what you
have to hide. And the band's new
sound is not prevalent on all
tracks; "Waiting for the Night" and
"Blue Dress" highlight the slow,
haunting synthesizers and har
monies of Depeche Mode's past.
This marked dichotomy in mu
sical styles detracts from the al
bum's continuity, ultimately
revealing musical and lyrical flaws.
A lethargic pace plagues songs like
"Sweetest Perfection," which
sounds like a sick elephant that
never gets off the ground. "Blue
Dress," along with two other
tracks, ends with ghostly, un
necesary appendices.
Still, Depeche Mode has enough
slow, melancholy tracks and quick,
releasable singles to perpetuate
their mass appeal and growing
commercial fame.
