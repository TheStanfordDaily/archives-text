## 'Nuns On the Run' escapes big laughs 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
Those who comprised the
Monty Python troupe hold special
places in the hearts of millions of
Americans who can appreciate
British humor. Their special tal
ents are immortalized by the
"Flying Circus," as well as the
films they produced while still to
gether, including "The Meaning of
Life," "Life of Brian" and "Monty

Python and the Holy Grail."
Since those glorious days, how
ever, most of the members have
had little success in comedic acting
roles. Aside from John Cleese and
Michael Palin's triumph in "A Fish
Called Wanda," the group's mem
bers have not fared well.
For example, Eric Idle in "Nuns
on the Run" just doesn't compare
to the Sir Robin of old, who nearly
fought the vicious Chicken of Bris
tol. Starring Idle and Robbie

Coltrane, "Nuns on the Run" is a
tale of love, high adventure,
chicanery and dressing in drag.
Sound interesting? Not really.
Like innumerable other
mediocre comedy movies, this film
takes some genuinely funny actors
and submerses all their talents in
an inane, sophomoric plot.
Idle and Coltrane's characters,
Brian and Charlie, are gang mem
bers who don't like the "recent"
trend toward violence in crime.

ONuns On The Run
Eric Idle, Robbie Coltrane

Shocked that it is necessary to
carry guns in the modern under
world, these two decide to abscond
with 1 million British pounds they
stole from two gangs.
Incredibly, the gangs aren't too
excited about this development.
Forced to hide in a convent in
preparation for their escape to
Brazil, the two assume the iden
tities of two travelling nuns, Sister
Inviolata of the Immaculate Con
ception and Sister Euphemia of the
Five Wounds. Are you piqued yet?
Hold on, because this film offers
even more. With a love story that
rivals Domino's Pizza in amounts
of tepid cheese and a shower scene
that rivals the infamous "Porky's,"
the plot quality decreases rapidly.
Other areas of moderate interest
in regard to this film include its
executive producer, ex-Beatle
George Harrison, who created
HandMade Films to help his
Monty Python friends produce
"Life of Brian." The director and
writer, Jonathan Lynn, won the
British Academy Writer of the Year
Award in 1988.
It appears, overall, that a lot of
talented people worked on the
movie both in front of and behind
the camera. However, none of their
talents coalesced, leaving a predict
able, boring, stereotypical dropping
of a film.
