Pretty Woman
If you see film as a medium through which to expand your
mind, then you'd better forget "Pretty Woman." Look beyond the
less-than-original story of "Pretty Woman," though, and you will
find a charming romantic comedy. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts
give two enticing performances full of chemistry. Go see the film
to enjoy it, but not to be intellectually stimulated by it.
My Left Foot
As one of the most critically-acclaimed Irish films ever made,
"My Left Foot" further distinguishes itself by now having two
Oscar-winning performances. Best Actor recipient Daniel Day
Lewis portrays cerebral-palsy-afflicted artist Christy Brown. Brenda
Fricker, who received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, is
Brown's mother.
The Hunt For Red October
Definitely, this pre-glasnost thriller offers the most bang for the
buck of any film out this week. Alec Baldwin successfully brings
to life author Tom Clancy's common man hero, Jack Ryan. "The
Hunt For Red October" needs a little room to maneuver, but once
it gets started the suspense is ample.
Cinema Paradiso
Winner of this year's Oscar for Best Foreign Film, "Cinema
Paradiso" depicts the story of a young Sicilian who escapes his
seemingly dull life by hanging out at the local movie theater. An
Italian production, "Cinema Paradiso" draws heavily on Hollywood
nostalgia.
