# Dirty dancing craze makes dull movies

It's everywhere.
David Letterman is doing it.
Sprockets members Wayne and
Dieter from "Saturday Night Live"
are doing it. Even Rob Lowe has
gotten in on the action.
Yes, Lambada has hit America
— and hit it big. Fueled by the
recent release of two hurriedly
produced Lambada movies, as well
as by the pulsing Afro-Latin beat
of Kaoma's hit song "Lambada,"
Lambada fever has swept across
the United States faster than you
can say, "If it were any hotter, it
wouldn't be dancing."
Originally created in Brazil dur
ing the mid 1980s, Lambada,
which roughly translates from Por
tuguese as "slap" or "rapid shot,"
was imported to Europe last year
by French record promoter Jean
Karakos. The Latin dance became
an overnight rage on the Contin
ent, and it was only a matter of
time before fad-hungry Americans,
eager to fill the pop void left by
the untimely death of the "Dirty
Dancing" craze, sunk their collec
tive teeth into Lambada.
Retailers such as Macy's in New
York and Bullock's in Los Angeles
have stocked their shelves with
Lambada skirts and tops.
Perhaps the best measure of the
dance's popular success, however,
is the recent spurt of Lambada
oriented movies. Ever eager to cash

in on a hot dance trend (as evi
denced by the films "Breakin,"
"Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo,"
and "Salsa: The Movie"), Holly
wood has cast its lot with other
Lambada commercializers by
releasing two films whose themes
deal almost exclusively with the
dance.
"Lambada" relates the story of
a Beverly Hills high school teacher
who moonlights as a Lambada
dancer in East L.A. Through his
dancing, the teacher inspires his
East L.A. teen proteges to work as
hard in school as they do on the
dance floor, thus leading to an ac
ademic showdown between the
East L.A. kids and the Beverly Hills
snobs.
Equally simplistic is "The For
bidden Dance," Hollywood's sec
ond entry in the race for
Lambada-generated dollars. "The
Forbidden Dance," named because
the producers of "Lambada" were
able to register their title first, fol
lows the trials and tribulations of
a beautiful young Brazilian girl as
she struggles to save her village,
as well as the Brazilian rain forests,
from destruction.
Although the studios have, for
the most part, yanked these two
movies from theater distribution,
they will soon be available on video
cassette for the enjoyment of all.
