# 'Woman': high Gere

Everybody loves a good Cin
derella story.
Banking on this tned and true
formula, Disney has spun out an
other fairy tale, this time through
Touchstone Pictures, its extension
company which aims films at the
post-pubescent. Accordingly,
"Pretty Woman" is a rags-to-riches
story with a premise quite unlike
those Disney childhood favorites.
In this movie, Cinderella wears
a mini-skirt and thigh-high ankle
boots and works as a Hollywood
Boulevard prostitute. (Ironically,
this premise is quite similar to Mr.
Disney's original storyline for
"Snow White and the Seven
Dwarves," in which Snow wasn't
so white.) But not to worry, Walt,
the prostitute has a heart of gold
and is so loveable that there will
surely be a new Disney character
walking the sidewalks of Main
Street U.S.A.
"Pretty Woman" relates the old
adage that true love contains the
power to transform anyone. Cor
porate mogul Edward Lewis
(Richard Gere), "The Wolf of Wall
Street," hasn't had the best luck
with his love life. As fate would
have it, Edward runs into Vivian
Ward (Julia Roberts), a savvy,
streetsmart businesswoman who
sells the commodity of love on an
hourly, cash-only basis.
Edward impulsively offers to give
Vivian a week-long look at how
the other half lives. His friendly
takeover of her life introduces the
young woman to the world of
power and privilege, in which
Vivian's natural charm and grace

emerges. Similarly, Edward, the
stoic corporate raider, is liberated
from his business mindset and
learns how to feel.
"Pretty Woman" is sappy, sen
timental, predictable, mindless
and completely absent of any edify
ing qualities, but in a good way.
So the storyline isn't plausible —
it's a fairy tale. Okay, charming
Vivian isn't the most typical
hooker one would find walking the
streets of L.A. This is Hollywood,
the magical world which brought
to the screen Mr. Mom in a Bat
suit pummeling bad guys, and
which recently cast C. Thomas
"Soul Man" Howell as the world
beach-volleyball champion in the
new movie "Sideout."

Director Garry Marshall
("Happy Days," "Beaches")
handles the story with a light
touch, and the result is a breezy,
bubbly comedy. But the driving
force behind the film is Julia
Roberts, who was recently
nominated for her supporting role
in "Steel Magnolias." The 22-year
old actress ignites each scene with
sexual zest and genuine comic
finesse as the fish out of water
who finds she can swim with grace
and agility.
In other words, yes, "Pretty
Woman" is mindless entertain
ment, but it is well done mindless
entertainment. "Pretty Woman"
forges no new ground, nor does it
lead to higher thought. But it's en
joyable.
