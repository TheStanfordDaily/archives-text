## Sterling performances in 'Les Miz' 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
"The biggest thrill for me is to be able
to entertain and enlighten on stage,"
Stanford alumnus Clark Sterling
declared. Sterling, a "swing" cast member
of the San Francisco production of "Les
Miserables," can play any one of 14
minor roles in the musical, depending
upon where he is needed.
The versatile actor is used to lead roles
in off-Broadway and regional theater pro
ductions. "I don't know if I'd like to
'swing 7 any other shows," he said. "But
in 'Les Miserables/ the ensemble tells
the whole story. No matter who I am,
I have something important to do.
"I was so bowled over by 'Les
Miserables,' that I had to be in the show,"
Sterling explained. "Hearing the music
and seeing the production, it transcends
all other musical theater."
For Sterling, the show's message is
also very important. Since he moved back
to the Bay Area in the fall of 1988, he
has been studying for a master's degree
at the San Francisco Theological Semi
nary.
" 'Les Miserables' has a strong message
of social justice," Sterling explained. "I
got caught up in the passion of it."
Sterling is continuing his studies part
time while appearing in "Les Miserables."
He said he would like to try to find a

way to combine religion and the arts in
his life. Unfortunately, he has not found
a good role model yet, he said. "I just
mieht have to create one," he added.
"One's spirituality is linked to the
desire to perform, to enlighten and to
communicate," Sterling explained.
"There has never been a show with such
a combination of theology and entertain
ment [as 'Les Miserables']."
That's why Sterling tried so hard to
get a part in "Les Miserables." He audi
tioned for the New York production, for
both national tours and even for a Vienna
production of the show before landing

his current job.
"Each time, I got a little bit closer/'
Sterling said. "For the Vienna production,
it came down to me and one other guy
for this part, and they chose him."
Finally, after moving back to the Bay
Area, Sterling made it onto the cast of
the San Francisco production and, since
then, it has been a full-time job.
"There are eight shows a week, two
on Wednesday, two on Saturday, and
then Monday is our day off," Sterling
said. "Being in the show is always thrill
ing, and hearing the music, it keeps you
going. But it is still a job, a very physically
demanding job, and you look forward to
your day off even though what you are
doing is gratifying.
"I love to perform and to be employed
doing it is very nice," Sterling continued.
"But to be in a show of this quality that
has such meaning for you is a gift. Some
times you have to pinch yourself. I think
everyone who is in the show feels it is
special.
"You can't see what we do on stage
and walk out on Geary Street or through
the Tenderloin and just idly walk by
people who need help," Sterling added.
"The bishop gives Valjean a new out
look on life," Sterling explained. "It is
fascinating that today 'Les Miserables'
is one of the most widely performed
shows in the world. It is not a show
about Western Christianity "
