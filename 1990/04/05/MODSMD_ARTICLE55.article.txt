# 'Invalid' a strong drama

American Conservatory Theater's
"The Imaginary Invalid," currently play
ing at San Francisco's Palace of Fine
Arts, is a near-brilliant production and
a worthy salute to the sophisticated farce
of Moliere.
Interestingly, the play's leading char
acter, the hypochondriac Argan, was
fashioned around the playwright's own
infirmity. Moliere, whose cough wracked
him to comic effect, collapsed during the
final scene of a 1673 performance and
died a short time later.
In"The Imaginary Invalid," Argan
wants to marry off his beautiful daughter,
Angelique, to an utter nincompoop, Dr.
Thomas Diafoirus. Argan wants a doctor
in the family because he's tired of paying
high prices for his prescriptions. But An
gelique is in love with the dashing
Cleante, so she enlists the aid of
Toinette, Argan's trouble-making and
kindhearted servant, to thwart Argan's
selfish scheme.
While this is going on, Beline, Argan's
second wife, is manipulating her husband
to give all of his worldly possessions to
her.
The most striking area of the ACT

production is the vibrant array of elegant
costumes the performers wear, which
words alone can't describe. Costume and
scenery designer Gerard Howland is an
astonishing and gifted artist.
While these costumes alone might
make the production a success, the act
ing, despite a few minor flaws, is also
exceptional. Argan and Toinette arc the
main characters, hut they're the weakest
in their roles. As Argan, Peter Donat has
difficulty from the opening scene, when
he has to take down his pantaloons (he
leaves his underwear on) and sit on a
glorified commode to complain about his
doctor bills. His imaginary illnesses are
not pronounced enough, and he would
show more bravado if he used Argan's
ailments to get sympathy and attention
from the other characters.
But all is not lost, for these performers'
weaknesses seem to bring out the
strength of the other cast members.
Howard Swain as Thomas Diafoirus is
nothing short of great; Pippa Winslow
as Angclique is a beautiful and gifted
coloratura; Richard Butterfield as Cleante
is handsome and comical.

"The Imaginary Invalid" will be per
formed at the Palace of Fine Arts, San
Francisco, March 19 through April 14.
