Chances of being admitted to Stanford rose from
17 percent to 20 percent this year, according to
statistics released yesterday by the Office of Un
dergraduate Admissions.
Though the number of applicants declined by
almost 2,000, letters of acceptance increased by 102
to 2,649.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter
attributes the changes to a shrinking applicant pool
and uncertainties in this year's yield rate of students
choosing to enter. Referring to declines at other top
universities, Fetter said, "We're in very good com
pany."
According to the admissions office both Duke
University and Georgetown University suffered a

decline of 13 percent, while Harvard experienced
about a 7 percent drop in applicants.
Qualitatively, the academic caliber of the admitted
students remains high. Forty-seven percent of the
admitted class have grade point averages of 4.0,
and 44 percent have combined SATs of 1,400 or
more.
The somewhat-controversial Jordan Scholars pro
gram will continue for the freshman class of 1990.
Instituted in 1987, the program distinguishes the
top 7 to 8 percent of the admitted students based
on academic excellence.
Unlike other universities which award merit schol
arships, Stanford's Jordan Scholars program pro
vides no financial benefit. "To attach money," said
Fetter, "would be entirely contradictory to Stan-
ford's tradition of need-based fi
nancial assistance."
Geographically, the percentage
of admitted students coming from
the western United States in
creased this year. The share of
Californians increased from 30.6
percent to 35.3 percent, while the
share of New Yorkers decreased
from 7.1 percent to 5.8 percent.
Although the gender composi
tion of the new freshman class
remains the same at 56 percent
male and 44 percent female, over
all ethnic diversity has improved.
Admitted students of either black,
Chicano/Latino, Asian-American
or Native American heritage com
prise 44 percent of the class.
Asian-American numbers grew
from 19 percent to 23.9 percent.
