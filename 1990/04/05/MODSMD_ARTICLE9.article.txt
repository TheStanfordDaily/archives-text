# Solar car is 'shining' success
## 
### Greg Blackwood 
Some Stanford students think
they have created the fastest
solar-powered car in the United
States.
The project began in January
1989 when the students submitted
a 60-page proposal to General
Motors and were chosen to be one
of 32 teams that will compete in
the 1990 GM Sunrayce, an 1,800-
mile race from Orlando, Fla., to
Detroit that will occur in July.
The 45 students currently affil
iated with the Sunsurfer car proj
ect hope to win the race and
advance to the 1990 World Solar
Challenge in November.
The car was researched and
tested last summer, and the
design was finalized by October.
It is now in the final stages of
construction. The car will be dis
played at Stanford on Earth Day,
April 22.
The team's strategy coordina
tor, sophomore Jesse Ellenbogen,
explained that one of Sunsurfer's
unique characteristics is the type
of solar cell the team is using.
The cells are especially designed
by Electrical Engineering Prof.
Richard Swanson, who is respon
sible for the most efficient solar
cells ever created.
"The biggest difference [bet
ween our car and the others] is
the solar cell. Most cars are using
solar cells that are . . . about 13
percent efficient. The Swanson
cells are about 23 percent effi
cient," Ellenbogen said.
Ellenbogen added that most
other teams are using conven
tional Arco solar cells, which can-

The car is three feet high, weighs less than
600 pounds and is built of an ultra-lightweight
carbon composite stronger than steel.

not absorb ambient light very
efficiently. In an experiment to
demonstrate the efficiency of the
Swanson cells, Ellenbogen says,
the team "put [a Swanson cell]
on the same panel up against an
Arco cell. You can cover the Swan
son cell with your hand .. . and
there's hardly any perceptible
drop in voltage." If the same pro
cedure is applied to the Arco cell,
the efficiency rating drops to
about a fourth of its previous
level, Ellenbogen explained.
One of the other mtyor reasons
for the car's efficiency is the
catalyzing process it uses. This
process involves placing a protec
tive coating over the solar cells
and linking them in arrays. El
lenbogen said the team thinks its
original catalyzing process is
"pretty revolutionary."
With most processes, "by the
time you're done putting the cells
in an array they're about 8 or 9
percent efficient" because of the
overlaid material and the resis
tance of the wiring, he added. He
said he thinks that Sunsurfer's
cells will be about 18 percent ef
ficient after the catalyzing process
is implemented.
The car is three feet high, six
feet wide and 20 feet long and
weighs less than 600 pounds. The
shell is built with an ultra
lightweight carbon composite that

is allegedly stronger than steel.
The shape of the car is similar
to a half-cylinder, rounded side
up, with five facets. Ellenbogen
said he believes that this curved
array is the best way to capitalize
on the light-absorbing abilities of
the Swanson cell. By contrast,
most solar cars have flat arrays.
The car will look quite different
from the original GM Sunraycer.
"Their whole theory was to make
a really aerodynamic car and then
try to attach solar cells to that,"
Ellenbogen explained.
"We feel that's not the optimum
approach to the problem of build
ing a solar car. So we made the
most solar-efficient car we could,
and then we tried to make it as
aerodynamic as possible," he
added.
Since the sun's rays are not uni
formly intense, the team had to
discover a converter to provide
constant output to the motor. "We
have a peak-power tracker that is
hooked up to each facet of the
array. ... It makes a constant vol
tage go out, even though a varying
voltage is going in."
"The key problem is the storage
system for the energy," said
Stefan Heck, coordinator of the
project. The car's set of 50 bat
teries will be able to store the
solar power in the event of rain
or hilly terrain.

Conventional lead-acid batteries
would be too heavy for the car to
use, so the alternative is silver
zinc batteries. These batteries can
only be used about 10 times before
their capacity drops rapidly, ren
dering them useless.
But weight is an important con
sideration. The lower the weight,
the greater the car's acceleration
and speed. "We'd like for the car,
without a driver, to have a weight
of around 425 pounds," said El
lenbogen. Other cars in the com

petition have been quoted as
having weights in the 400 to 600
pound range.
The team worked hard over
spring break assembling the chas
sis and drive train so that the car
will be ready for its Earth Day
showing. Heck said the project is
intended to "raise public aware
ness and student involvement."
Unfortunately, the project may
be in serious financial trouble. Al
though the car is relatively cheap
at $300,000, only about $125,000

has been raised. "We're at the
point where people are paying for
things out of their own pockets,"
Ellenbogen said.
"What we are trying to prove
is that with much less than mil
lions of dollars you can make a
car that runs on alternative en
ergy," said sophomore Illah Nour
bakhsh, the project's design
coordinator. "It sounds ridiculous
to have a car covered with solar
cells, but ... in the far future it
may well be feasible."

not absorb ambient light very
efficiently. In an experiment to
demonstrate the efficiency of the
Swanson cells, Ellenbogen says,
the team "put [a Swanson cell]
on the same panel up against an
Arco cell. You can cover the Swan
son cell with your hand .. . and
there's hardly any perceptible
drop in voltage." If the same pro
cedure is applied to the Arco cell,
the efficiency rating drops to
about a fourth of its previous
level, Ellenbogen explained.
One of the other mtyor reasons
for the car's efficiency is the
catalyzing process it uses. This
process involves placing a protec
tive coating over the solar cells
and linking them in arrays. El
lenbogen said the team thinks its
original catalyzing process is
"pretty revolutionary."
With most processes, "by the
time you're done putting the cells
in an array they're about 8 or 9
percent efficient" because of the
overlaid material and the resis
tance of the wiring, he added. He
said he thinks that Sunsurfer's
cells will be about 18 percent ef
ficient after the catalyzing process
is implemented.
The car is three feet high, six
feet wide and 20 feet long and
weighs less than 600 pounds. The
shell is built with an ultra
lightweight carbon composite that

is allegedly stronger than steel.
The shape of the car is similar
to a half-cylinder, rounded side
up, with five facets. Ellenbogen
said he believes that this curved
array is the best way to capitalize
on the light-absorbing abilities of
the Swanson cell. By contrast,
most solar cars have flat arrays.
The car will look quite different
from the original GM Sunraycer.
"Their whole theory was to make
a really aerodynamic car and then
try to attach solar cells to that,"
Ellenbogen explained.
"We feel that's not the optimum
approach to the problem of build
ing a solar car. So we made the
most solar-efficient car we could,
and then we tried to make it as
aerodynamic as possible," he
added.
Since the sun's rays are not uni
formly intense, the team had to
discover a converter to provide
constant output to the motor. "We
have a peak-power tracker that is
hooked up to each facet of the
array. ... It makes a constant vol
tage go out, even though a varying
voltage is going in."
"The key problem is the storage
system for the energy," said
Stefan Heck, coordinator of the
project. The car's set of 50 bat
teries will be able to store the
solar power in the event of rain
or hilly terrain.

Conventional lead-acid batteries
would be too heavy for the car to
use, so the alternative is silver
zinc batteries. These batteries can
only be used about 10 times before
their capacity drops rapidly, ren
dering them useless.
But weight is an important con
sideration. The lower the weight,
the greater the car's acceleration
and speed. "We'd like for the car,
without a driver, to have a weight
of around 425 pounds," said El
lenbogen. Other cars in the com

petition have been quoted as
having weights in the 400 to 600
pound range.
The team worked hard over
spring break assembling the chas
sis and drive train so that the car
will be ready for its Earth Day
showing. Heck said the project is
intended to "raise public aware
ness and student involvement."
Unfortunately, the project may
be in serious financial trouble. Al
though the car is relatively cheap
at $300,000, only about $125,000

has been raised. "We're at the
point where people are paying for
things out of their own pockets,"
Ellenbogen said.
"What we are trying to prove
is that with much less than mil
lions of dollars you can make a
car that runs on alternative en
ergy," said sophomore Illah Nour
bakhsh, the project's design
coordinator. "It sounds ridiculous
to have a car covered with solar
cells, but ... in the far future it
may well be feasible."

Stefan Heck puts the finishing touches on the Sunsurfer - a solar-powered car created by 45
Stanford students who believe it is the fastest solar-powered car in the United States.
Some Stanford students think
they have created the fastest
solar-powered car in the United
States.
The project began in January
1989 when the students submitted
a 60-page proposal to General
Motors and were chosen to be one
of 32 teams that will compete in
the 1990 GM Sunrayce, an 1,800-
mile race from Orlando, Fla., to
Detroit that will occur in July.
The 45 students currently affil
iated with the Sunsurfer car proj
ect hope to win the race and
advance to the 1990 World Solar
Challenge in November.
The car was researched and
tested last summer, and the
design was finalized by October.
It is now in the final stages of
construction. The car will be dis
played at Stanford on Earth Day,
April 22.
The team's strategy coordina
tor, sophomore Jesse Ellenbogen,
explained that one of Sunsurfer's
unique characteristics is the type
of solar cell the team is using.
The cells are especially designed
by Electrical Engineering Prof.
Richard Swanson, who is respon
sible for the most efficient solar
cells ever created.
"The biggest difference [bet
ween our car and the others] is
the solar cell. Most cars are using
solar cells that are . . . about 13
percent efficient. The Swanson
cells are about 23 percent effi
cient," Ellenbogen said.
Ellenbogen added that most
other teams are using conven
tional Arco solar cells, which can-
