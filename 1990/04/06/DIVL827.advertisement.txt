If you're the best in your class,
your career should be one
failure after another.
Failure is uur business. We are the largest and most
experienced engineering consulting firm in the na
tion specializing in the analysis and prevention of
mechanical, structural, and materials failure.
Founded in 1967 by a group of Stanford engineers,
we've since analyzed thousands of failures - from
airplane crashes to building collapses, from power
plant failures to supertanker sinkings. We've inves
tigated highly publicized disasters like the Decem
ber 1989 crane collapse in downtown San Fran
cisco. We've provided technical advice in areas as
different as NASA's space shuttle and children's
toys. We offer some of the most challenging and
interesting engineering work available anywhere.
We're currently seeking graduate-level engineers in
Mechanical, Civil/Structural, Chemical, and Envi
ronmental Engineering. If you're an academic stand
out and a hands-on problem solver, we invite you to
join us for a campus presentation and an interview.
