No matter which you choose, a Macintosh is a Macintosh.
Clearly the computer of choice for over 22,000 people in the Stanford
community. Apple Computer has offered its Macintosh computers to Stanford
faculty, staff, and students at the lowest prices available anywhere in the world.
No matter who you are -- whether you're a student on a budget, a busy professor on
the go, or a business professional on your way to the top - we've got a Macintosh
thats light for you. From the affordable Macintosh Plus to the high-performance
Macintosh Ilci. All you need to do is decide how much Macintosh you need.
Don t wait any longer. Come on into the Stanford Bookstore and get your hands on
a Macintosh today, and see for yourself what you've been missing.
