# Kennedy on Stanford's second century:
## Emphasis on teaching, streamlining 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Staff writer 
In perhaps the benchmark speech of his
career, University President Donald Kennedy
offered his vision of Stanford in its second
century — with the faculty more committed
to teaching than research and the adminis
tration more streamlined and efficient.
Addressing both the Academic Council at

its annual meeting and the entire community
in a packed Kresge Auditorium yesterday,
Kennedy pointed out the "painful" disparities
between this vision and the present reality at
Stanford.
Recalling University founders Jane and
Leland Stanford and first University President
David Starr Jordan's belief in the unity of
teaching and research, Kennedy said his vision
of improved undergraduate education "is

faithful to Stanford's character," a rededica
tion to its original purpose.
"It is time for us to reaffirm that education
— that is, teaching in all its forms — is the
primary task, and that our society will judge
us in the long run on how well we do it,"he
said.
Kennedy criticized faculty who "buy out"
teaching time in order to concentrate on their
research, leaving the teaching to visiting or
temporary appointees.
However, Kennedy acknowledged that Stan
ford often fails to offer tenure to junior faculty
who are outstanding teachers "to the dismay
of students who understandably wonder about
the University's values."
To avoid a relationship between Stanford's
professors and students of "you don't bother
us too much, we don't bother you too much,"
Kennedy proposed a convergence of teaching
and research through the improvement of in
terdisciplinary and honors programs and in
dependent study. In these "bridges," faculty
and students work in collaboration at the fron
tiers of their fields, he said.
Kennedy also attacked the University's ap
athy in trying to improve the quality of teach
ing.
"1 am struck, for example, by the lack of
conversation around here about what pedag
ogy means, and what makes it successful,"
said Kennedy. "We seldom consider how to
improve the vital non-classroom kinds of
teaching, like advising. Nor do we argue
enough, except in rare episodes like the CIV
debate, about what ought to be the common
intellectual property of educated men and
women."
Addressing his assembled faculty colleagues
specifically, Kennedy said, "We need to talk
more about teaching . . . and make it first
