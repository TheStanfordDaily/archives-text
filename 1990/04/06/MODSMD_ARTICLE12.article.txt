Germans march toward union
EAST BERLIN (AP) — East Germany's first
freely chosen Parliament declared the nation
a democracy yesterday and began building a
political system that will lead it to unification
with West Germany.
The lawmakers, elected March 18 in the
nation's first democratic ballot, convened for
the first time and formally dismantled the
Communist system that ruled four decades.
Meeting in the Palace of the Republic built
by the former Stalinist regime, the 400-
member Parliament began rewriting the con

The new legislature and the government it
creates could be East Germany's last as a
sovereign state because of the moves toward
unification with West Germany.
