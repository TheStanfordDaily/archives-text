## Gorbachev advances superpower summit 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United
States and the Soviet Union have
seven short weeks to put together a
summit package of nuclear weapons
cutbacks and to find common ground
on German unification and ways to
awaken the sluggish Soviet economy.
But as Secretary of State James
Baker 111 and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze plodded past
the midpoint of this week's heavy pre
summit agenda, the outlook for meet
ing the May 30 deadline with solid
accomplishments was uncertain.
In fact, the summit may turn out
to be less of a ceremonial signing event
than a working session for President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
Whatever reasons Gorbachev had for
advancing the summit — it was ini
tially planned for the second half of
June — the effect is to put additional
pressure on negotiators grappling with
three of the most complicated arms
control treaties in history.
And officials on both sides suggested
on yesterday chances of finishing the
accord to cut long-range nuclear mis
siles by the time Gorbachev comes here
to see Bush are virtually nil.
The most optimistic projection is
that Baker and Shevardnadze, and ne
gotiators meeting in Geneva, will be
able to reach agreement by May 30 on
the key issues and leave the details to
be mopped up after the summit.
"Taking into account it's in seven
weeks," Yuri Nazarkin, the chief So
viet START negotiator, said, "it's im
practical, I think, to expect it's going
to be signed at the summit. But
definitely, all the major issues should
be resolved, making the treaty ready
for signing" later on.
