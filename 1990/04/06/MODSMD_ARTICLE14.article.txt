U.S., Japan sign treaty
WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. and
Japanese negotiators yesterday put
the finishing touches on an unprece
dented agreement seeking to make
broad-based reforms in the
economies of both nations.
The talks, which had been sched
uled for two days, took up four days
as negotiators haggled over details
of the complex proposals aimed at
reducing America's huge $49 billion
trade deficit with Japan.
The talks were unprecedented in
their scope because they aimed not

at boosting sales for specific foreign
products but at correcting broad bar
riers to trade in both countries.
For the first time, representatives
of sovereign states drew up detailed
lists of the economic shortcomings
in the other nation and demanded
changes.
Senators lambaste Bush
WASHINGTON (AP) - Two Re
publican senators accused President
Bush and congressional leaders yes
terday of reacting too slowly to
changes in Eastern Europe and urged

cuts in the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
Frustrated with the administra
tion's fiscal 1991 defense budget and
with proposed adjustments circulat
ing on Capitol Hill, Sens. William
Cohen of Maine and John McCain of
Arizona recommended a leaner
framework, including cutbacks for
the B-2 Stealth bomber and land
based nuclear missiles.
They propose keeping military
spending basically stable over the
next five years compared to the ad
ministration's recommendation of
modest increases of 2 percent or less
each year â€” less than the probable

rate of inflation.
Hubble on schedule
WASHINGTON (AP) - Cosmic
questions that have puzzled humans
since they first looked at the
night-time sky may be answered
when the Hubble Space Telescope is
placed in orbit as history's keenest
celestial eye.
Hubble, to be launched Tuesday
by the space shuttle Discovery, will
give a view of the cosmos that is not
filtered and dimmed by the Earth's
atmosphere.
