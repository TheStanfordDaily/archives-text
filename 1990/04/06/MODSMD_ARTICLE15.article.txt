savs. "All students should take this course
I am going to require all freshmen to take
it."
Lxxiisiana State University Athletic De
partment Director of Academics. Charles
Alexander says."I took the course and
found iKit that the key to getting better
grades is not studying longer, but learning
better memory techniques."
UCLA law student Rcgina Hermann says,
"I used to read my law hooks up to three
times in preparation for cases. Now I only
have to read them once and retain infor
mation tor as long as I want, not just until
the test is over. I wish I could have studied
Mr Jackson's memory techniques in col
lege."
Alvin Jackson has been teaching attor
neys. ikxtors, and law entorcement agen
cies memory techniques for 12 years, and
noticed an increase in the number of stu
dents taking his course with startling in
creases in their grades.
"The reason is simple", say Jackson, "All
a student has to do is ask themself these
three questions;
1 If I could remember everything I read,
would my grades be better?
2 It 1 could recall everything I heard in
class lectures, Ihtw much better would
my grades be?
3 How many memory techniques do I
now know'*"

Most students only know one memory
technique repetition. Among mem
ory experts, repetition is at the rock
bottom of the list because it forces
student to spend too much time
reading, and re-reading, and re
reading, and once the test is given, they
forget everything!
Jackson has taught his memory tech
niques to those with excellent Ci.P.A.'s
wishing to cut down on studying time
while maintaining top grades and to
those who want to increase their
G.P.A. Under the present set up of the
education system, those who can re
member the most get the highest
grades
Mr Jackson will teach each class mem
bet how to read text books once and
remember all material, how to listen to
a lecture and remember everything,
how to remember names and faces,
complex math formulas, speeches, his
tory, languages, and how to take exams
which is nothing more than remember
ing answers
Because Mr Jackson teaches each stu
dent individually, he can only accept .10
persons in each class on a first come,
first served basis
His clavs will be held Thursday, April
12 in the Cypress R<*wn at the Holiday
Inn Paki Aito at 10:00 am and h (It pm
Tuition for the seminar is 545.00 for
students and $75 (Ml for non-students
