# Funds finally freed
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY officials will
find their retirement a little
less exhausting with a
major policy shift by the $84 billion
pension fund the University uses.
The Teachers Insurance and An
nuity Association and College Re
tirement Equities Fund was
formed in the days of monopoly,
and its operations have, up until
late, reflected its origin. Prohibit
ing college faculty and staff from
transferring their investment
funds to rival firms, the company
has long cornered its market under
the guise of protecting consumers.
Thankfully, that will no longer
be the case. Last month, the com
pany decided to relinquish its con
trol of funds to individual
universities.
As a result, Vice President and
General Counsel John Schwartz is
a happy man. As the University's
chief legal officer, he has long ad
vocated more individual invest
ment freedom for retiring staffers,

and two years of legal contests
have now borne fruit.
Pending the recommendations of
a University task force, former em
ployees will have expanded invest
ment choices, and rightfully so.
As Schwartz put it, "You have
to give a certain amount of credit
to people who have been saving for
20 or 30 years that they know
what to do with their money."
At the same time, others fear
that colleges might take unreason
able risks with the newly-freed
funds.
The University needs to ensure
that both the Equity Fund and
rival companies will stay account
able to investors. And more impor
tantly, the University must remain
accountable to its staffers.
If there are strong temptations
to play accounting games with the
funds, the University has to resist
them. After all, the funds are
meant to secure the future of its
employees.
