Professors should be empathetic regardless of race

I AM WRITING to express my
discontent with Corey Davis' last
column. In his April 4 column,
Davis writes: "We can't learn about
[different cultures] . . . until Stanford
hires more minority faculty. Students
of color cannot continue to be the
'spokeaspersons' for their race."
Although I recognize Davis' good
intentions and his efforts to correct the
ethnocentric attitudes of the past, I
hesistate to endorse his proposal to
hire minority faculty mainly to correct
that imbalance.
Next year, I will pursue a doctorate
in history at Northwestern University.
I plan to study American foreign policy
in the early 20th century vis-a-vis
Central America and the Caribbean. I
am eager to study the cultural as well
as the political ramifications of United
States policy on these countries.
Despite my interest in approaching

history from a multicultural perspec
tive, I also feel a strong commitment
to my field as a scholar. I intend to
become a professional historian and
abide by accepted historiographical
techniques.
I want to be recognized as a profes
sor who happens to be a minority,
rather than a minority professor. I do
not believe that the color of my skin,
my language or my Puerto Rican
culture should determine my conclu
sion as a professional historian.
Granted, my culture will influence to
a degree my examination of facts and
my conclusions about them, but I do
not intend to be a spokesperson for the
Puerto Rican or Latino students in my
classes. Such an assumption by Corey
Davis and others who feel like him are
an offense to my desire to be treated
as a scholar in my own right.
Yes, I will take into account the

contributions of blacks, Chi
cano/Latinos, women and other minori
ties. But I do not feel that my skin
color or my culture immediately be
stows those qualities of compassion. I
feel it is the duty of any professor —
black, Asian or white, historian or
engineer — to care for his or her
students.
This compassion should not be due
to cultural or racial similarities but
due to a common sense of humanity. I
understand that as a dark-skinned,
Chicano/Latino professor, some of the
students will reach out to me and feel
more comfortable, but I want to reach
out to the anglo, blue-eyed, blonde
haired frat students as well, because
they are equally-worthy human beings
and they have many problems from
living in a university environment.
Let no one misunderstand me. We
need more ethnic studies. We need to

understand the contributions of women
and minorities. But 1 encourage the
Stanford faculty and administrators to
answer to that call by hiring professors
who will empathize with students
regardless or their color.
Some of my white professors have
been just as caring and understanding
of my problems as minority professors
are expected to be. Athough there are
not nearly enough of those professors
around at Stanford and other univer
sities, it is a problem of attitude about
their role as professors, rather than
their inherent inability to empathize
due to their racial or cultural back
ground.
Let us appeal to our higher nature
of compassion and love and empathy
that transcends barriers of color and
culture.
