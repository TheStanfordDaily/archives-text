# Faculty praise vision, question role of cuts
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Impressed with University President
Donald Kennedy's eloquent delivery and
compelling vision, faculty members wel
comed his message for an increased
emphasis on undergradute education.
But some questioned the compatibility
of his rhetoric with the massive budget
cuts scheduled for this year.
While "quite pleased" with Kennedy's
emphasis on teaching, Education Prof.
Denis Phillips said he was also "somewhat
distressed" over the inconsistency between
the president's message and the impending
budget cuts.
"Which one of these messages do you
take seriously?" he asked.
Phillips, a resident fellow at Twain, noted
that dorms sponsor many of the educational
activities advocated by Kennedy in his
speech, but the University's budget-cutting
"reposition" committee has set a prelimi
nary 20 percent budget reduction target

for Residential Education.
Phillips said he agreed in general with
the streamlining process, but he drew a
distinction between paring down a budget
by 10 percent and cutting it by 20 percent.
"You can't cut that sort of money by
making yourself more efficient," he said.
"It's not going to add up."
Nevertheless, faculty were moved by Ken
nedy's vision of teaching as the primiary
mission of the University.
"Kennedy is required reading," said
Ewart Thomas, dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
His speach was "emotionally uplifting
studded with hints and ideas a manager
can use," Thomas said.
"He set a wonderful tone at a time when
everyone is gloomy about budget cuts,"
Biological Sciences Prof. Robert Simoni
said.
However, reconciling excellence in re
search and teaching presents a great chal
lenge, according to Computer Science Chair
Nils Nilsson.
"I'm all for him," Nilsson said,
but added that he wondered
whether excellence in teaching
necessarily follows from a process
in which the best researchers are
hired and promoted.
In* yesterday's regular meeting
of the Faculty Senate, prior to
Kennedy's address, Provost James
Rosse presented the operating
budget guidelines for 1990-91.
Although the specific plans for
repositioning and budget reduc
tion will be discussed in June,
Rosse issued several recommen
dations for consideration at next
week's Board of Trustees meeting.
Rosse's recommendations, not
all of which will reduce University
spending, included:
• Reducing the self-help compo
nent of financial aid from 25 to
20 percent,
• Increasing faculty and staff
salaries,
• Setting the indirect cost rate
at 78 percent and reducing this
rate in the long term, and
• Allocating funds for earth
quake repair.
English Prof. Robert Polhemus
drew attention to the 20 percent
budget cut target set for the Uni
versity's libraries.
"A cut of that magnitude would
drastically affect the libraries'

ability to serve the Stanford com
munity," he said, pointing to
declines in research and recruiting
as possible outcomes.
In other action, the Senate ap
proved the Ph.D. Graduate Spe
cial Program, an interdisciplinary
doctoral program.
