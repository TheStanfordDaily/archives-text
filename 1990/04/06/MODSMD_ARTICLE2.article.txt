# Faculty praise vision, question role of cuts
## 
### Liz Lempert Senior staff writer 
Impressed with University President
Donald Kennedy's eloquent delivery and
compelling vision, faculty members wel
comed his message for an increased
emphasis on undergradute education.
But some questioned the compatibility
of his rhetoric with the massive budget
cuts scheduled for this year.
While "quite pleased" with Kennedy's
emphasis on teaching, Education Prof.
Denis Phillips said he was also "somewhat
distressed" over the inconsistency between
the president's message and the impending
budget cuts.
"Which one of these messages do you
take seriously?" he asked.
Phillips, a resident fellow at Twain, noted
that dorms sponsor many of the educational
activities advocated by Kennedy in his
speech, but the University's budget-cutting
"reposition" committee has set a prelimi
nary 20 percent budget reduction target

for Residential Education.
Phillips said he agreed in general with
the streamlining process, but he drew a
distinction between paring down a budget
by 10 percent and cutting it by 20 percent.
"You can't cut that sort of money by
making yourself more efficient," he said.
"It's not going to add up."
Nevertheless, faculty were moved by Ken
nedy's vision of teaching as the primiary
mission of the University.
"Kennedy is required reading," said
Ewart Thomas, dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
His speach was "emotionally uplifting
studded with hints and ideas a manager
can use," Thomas said.
"He set a wonderful tone at a time when
everyone is gloomy about budget cuts,"
Biological Sciences Prof. Robert Simoni
said.
However, reconciling excellence in re
search and teaching presents a great chal
lenge, according to Computer Science Chair
