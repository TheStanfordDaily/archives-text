# Betas prepare to make changes in their community
## 
### 
We are writing to correct two subtle
yet damaging inaccuracies that ap
peared in the recent article entitled
"Betas seek input on whether or not
to go coed." Each is due to a migcom
munication during an interview with
The Daily which resulted in the March
14 article.
First of all, the article makes the
claim that Beta Theta Pi fraternity
was "the only fraternity house to par
ticipate in last quarter's Take Back
the Night' march." This is not true â€”
several members of other fraternities
were involved in the march in numer
ous different capacities.

An apology is due to several individ
uals who were involved in the march
and to the fraternities of which they
are members. It was not our intention
to be judgmental about, thp attitudes or
actions of other fraternities at Stan
ford.
Secondly, the article also states that
the Betas "have consistently demon
strated commitment to sexual equality"
and "have hosted a number of educa
tional programs on gender-related is
sues."
The truth is that the Betas have not
traditionally shown a commitment to
combating sexism, and this is precisely
the reason why we want to make al
terations in the structure of our frater
nal community. We will begin to host
educational programs that enable us to
change the direction of the Beta house
to better demonstrate commitment to
sexual equality.
More importantly, the inclusion of

women in our social community beyond
that of a traditional fraternity party is
an important step in accomplishing
these goals.
