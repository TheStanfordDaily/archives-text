# Member's actions not reflective of entire ski team

### 
The last line of an April 2 Daily
article describing events of drunken
misconduct by Stanford students at a
Cow Palace wrestling match read:
"Many of the students involved were
members of the ski team, but the
event was not an official social gather
ing for any group."

We have one question for The Daily:
If this was not an organized gathering
for any group, then why was there a
need to associate it with a group?
At the ski team cabin in Lake Tahoe
we promote and maintain a highly
social, yet highly responsible drinking
environment — without the presence of
resident assistants or resident fellows
— which has yet to result in an inci
dent like the one mentioned.
Even if all 10 of the students in
volved were members of the ski team,
how could they accurately reflect the
behavior of a group with over 120
participants? As a club sport, an im
portant source of revenue for the ski
team is alumni donations. The last
thing we need is falsely-represented
negative press.
