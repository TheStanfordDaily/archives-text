## Grace in every situation 
### 
HEY! HOW ARE you? How was
your break?
I'm only asking because appar
ently it's mandatory. It might just be me,
but don't you think it's kind of eerie
when everyone you talk to begins with
the exact same words?
Okay, I'll stop beating around the bush
and get to it — it's already been done in
a hundred different papers and by people
who know far more than I do about what
it is that makes good sportswriting, but
I still feel a need to say thank you to
the Stanford women's basketball team
for the absolutely amazing season-long
display of poise and talent that brought
them a 32-1 season and a well-deserved
National Championship victory.
I know it sounds like I'm shoveling
this stuff, but I was in Ruston, La. last
year for the Stanford vs. Louisiana Tech
game, and the ugliest thing on the court
wasn't a Stanford loss. It was Venus Lacy.
Now Lacy is a fine basketball player
in her own right — but she's also a
person who would find sports psychology
sessions some time well-spent.
I don't think I've ever seen someone
come as close as Lacy did to throwing a
temper tantrum every time she was
whistled for a foul. It didn't appear that
she was frustrated over a bad call or
with herself for committing a foul. She
was just acting like a little kid; she was
completely oblivious to the concept of
"grace under pressure."
This year in Knoxville I saw grace:
Sonja, Jennifer, Julie, Katy, Trisha and
as deep a bench as I've ever seen. When
it came down to the final game an Auburn

cheerleader asked one of the Dollies, "Is
this y'all's first final four?"
"Yep," came the reply. The cheerleader
smirked — she was probably thinking,
"Well isn't that cute?" as Auburn has
been there for the last three champion
ship games — and lost them — isn't that
cute?
It's grace on the court that most people
get to see. The luckier ones get to see
them off the court too, as people.
Ruston and Knoxville have been two
of the most memorable road trips I've
taken, partly because of the people in
volved in the events that surrounded the
games. In Ruston, the team had just
returned from dinner and was about to
go out to see a movie. The Band was
hanging out in the parking lot, barbecue
ing. The bus driver revved his engine
and the door started to close, when Jen
nifer Azzi leaned out and asked, "You
guys want to go?"
And so, completely spontaneously, a
Stanford Women's Basketball team and
a Stanford Band went out to see a movie,
"Beaches." In it, Barbara Hershey's char
acter mentions, and then goes to, Stan
ford Law School — and we of said school
erupted with applause.
I'm positive we confused and/or an
noyed the rest of the theater pretty tho
roughly.
This year there was a celebration at
the Azzi's house in nearby Oak Ridge
and then another party at the Holiday
Inn in Knoxville. There were songs, there
was dancing, there was drinking and
there was eating.
There was Val Whiting conducting and

Molly Goodenbaur and Tara Vanderveer
playing drum solos. They played about
as hard after the game as they did during.
It was pretty bizarre, this team and this
band playing together. I don't know if
the team thought it was weird, but I
know I did. For me these athletes always
seemed a little more important than reg
ular students — and I began to under
stand how schools get tempted to violate
NCAA rules. . . . But I digress.
What I'm getting at is that it's ex
tremely cool that two such divergent
groups as a band and a basketball team
could have such a good time together.
There are plenty of ways to introduce
yourself to completely different groups
of people and to learn about them; sure
you could read a book or go to a lecture
or even see a movie about them — but
just being around other groups is, I think,
the best of all ways to understanding
them.
Congratulations — and thank you —
to the Stanford women's basketball team.
