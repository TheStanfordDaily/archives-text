## Karen Abrams, Elissa Epel and Sairus Patel Affirmative action does more than remedy discrimination 
### 
Affirmative action is an
institutional response to institu
tional discrimination against
marginalized groups. It exists in many
forms. A mild form encourages people
from traditionally-underrepresented
groups to apply, for example, to uni
versities and companies. A stronger
form considers them for preferential
treatment if they are qualified for the
position. Ihe use of quotas, perhaps
the most controversial form of affirma
tive action, is the exception rather
than the rule.
Here we must note that affirmative
action applies to women as well as
targeted minorities; it is disconcerting
that the issue of gender discrimination
has been completely ommitted in all
Daily discussion.

We cannot overemphasize that af
firmative action applies to those with
equal qualifications. Equally qualified
applicants from underrepresented
groups have often worked much harder
than others to achieve those qualifica
tions by effectively dealing with bar
riers such as racism and sexism. The
claim that affirmative action results in
loss of efficiency is completely un
founded. On the contrary, these candi
dates are often more qualified for the
positions.
Sherifa Omade Edoga, a black
woman who is disabled, says others
constantly tell her that the only reason
she got into Stanford was because of
affirmative action. Her response is,
"Being a black, disabled female posed
real obstacles for me in achieving the

good record that I did. Because of
working with these difficulties — not
in spite of them — and being success
ful, I think there is a damn good
reason to let me into Stanford."
After recognizing that affirmative
action candidates are equally qualified,
we need to examine whether or not
they receive equal consideration. There
seems an unwillingness on the part of
those who oppose affirmative action to
recognize the subjectivity of assessing
another's competence. Merit is a social
construction. Our perceptions of an
other person's "concrete" qualifications
are shaped by factors such as race,
gender, and physical ability.
We also need to note the relative
effects of affirmative action on all
people. Many yell that affirmative

action is reverse discrimination. In
part, this is true with the stronger
forms of affirmative action where
underrepresented people who are
equally qualified receive preference.
However, not all forms of discrimina
tion are equally objectionable. There is
a fundamental difference between white
men, for instance, not getting the job
because of affirmative action, and
traditionally underrepresented people.
These people's rejection reinforces the
notion that they are incapable, that
they do not belong, and thus further
continues the long history of underrep
resentation and inequality.
Law School Prof. Deborah Rhode
explains in her book "Justice and
Gender" how "disfavoring women
serves to stigmatize, stereotype, and

subordinate; disfavoring white men
does not."
Affirmative action has been accused
of taking jobs away from certain
people. The implicit assumption behind
such a statement is that these people
have the right to a particular job. This
is false. In this country, no one is
guaranteed a specific job.
We must dispel the myth that we
live in a land of equal opportunity.
Such a myth insidiously implies that
race and gender are not enormous
sources of discrimination.
