## Aliens invade Farm President's home visited by flying saucer

The Daily Palo Alto
April 9, 1906
Spring Break was a bad time
for four Stanford affiliates to be
"horsing around." Each of the
four was involved in a separate
equestrian-related accident dur
ing the vacation.
Dr. Leon Lewis, of the Law
School, was thrown from a horse
while riding in Golden Gate Park.
A physical examination disclosed
no serious injuries.
G. B. McLain, a junior at Stan
ford, was also thrown from a
horse and received cuts and
lacerations about his face, for
which he needed over 20 stitches.
McLain was unconscious for 12
hours after the accident and at
one point, it was doubtful that he
would recover.
Finally, Miss E. L. Officer, also
a junior, and Miss A. S. Hayes, a
senior, were thrown from a horse
driven carriage when the animal
was startled by an automobile.
They sustained no injuries but
the story notes that both ladies
were lucky they were not killed.
Both women were members of the
Pi Beta Phi sorority.
What if The Daily had a column
listing all the bike accidents in
White Plaza? Imagine this: "Don
Kennedy, frightened by a black
squirrel, ran into the Clock Tower
yesterday. Though Kennedy suf
fered a broken arm, the tower re
mained unscathed." Think of how
much this would add to the reg
ular embarrassment that comes
from having a one-person bike ac
cident.
The Stanford Daily
March 32, 1966
The Stanford Daily reported
that a metallic blue flying saucer
crashed into the second floor of
the home of University President
Wallace Sterling at about 10:30
the previous evening. Sterling and
his wife were downstairs in their
den when they heard a thun
derous explosion from above. "I

thought SLAC had blown up," he
said.
Sterling later opened fire on the
spaceship with an illegal double
barrel shotgun.
Captain Midnight of the Stan
ford Police Department was
quoted as saying, "I have closed
down drunken fraternity parties,
stopped panty raids on Roble
single-handedly and even walked
Heidi (the president's dog), but I
never had such a difficult assign
ment."

The "space invasion" caused ex
tensive damage but no injuries.
March 32? A flying saucer? Ah
yes, the infamous April Fools edi
tion. Actually, it sounds just as
believable as anything else The
Daily prints.
The Stanford Daily
April 4, 1968
And, "coincidentally," two years
to the day later, radio engineers
operating the 150 foot dish an
tenna at The Stanford Center for
Radar Astronomy reported having
received mysterious signals from
space which they believed to be
from another civilization.
According to a senior research
engineer, this marked the first
time a radio observatory in North
America was able to receive such
signals. To imaginative scientists
this suggested the possibility of
an inter-galactic communications
network among different civiliza
tions.
Wow, what a scary story. And
you thought the cows by the Dish
were from this planet.
