# If your ID number starts with 38, you are paying too much

There have been only four times in my
life that I have slept past 2 p.m. — three
of them were last week. I hope every
body's Spring Break was as productive
as mine. I think it all started last quarter
during finals week when I went to Green
Library for the sole purpose of sleeping
— I didn't use the pretext of studying.
I didn't even take a backpack. ... I find
it a little unfair that the furniture in
Green is much more comfortable than
my bed.
Dear Bug,
When I was reduced to a number last
year I was consoled by the fact that the
first two digits of my new identity held
a special symbolic meaning. The 3 obvi
ously stood for the Trinity (Leland, Jane,

Leland Jr.), while the S represented the
year I left home. But it appears the Uni
versity has broken with what I thought
was tradition by issuing current frosh
people coveted ID numbers beginning
with "38." Is this a new trend, and if
so, is it an outgrowth of CIV?
— Numeric Numbskull
Joy at the Registrar's Office was very
happy to let me know that the process
for assigning student ID numbers is an
unexciting one involving one single com
puter. The numbers are sequential but
are randomly generated. However, before
1984 the first three numbers cor
responded with the quarter and year a
student entered. There is some consola
tion, Numbskull, in the fact that your
number is unique and will never be
reused, which leads me right into the
real story behind the creation of a Stan
ford Student Identification Number.

After some exhausting research and a
multitude of clandestine meetings, I have
discovered the following information. The
first two digits of the ID number are a
code for the amount of tuition at the
time of entering. For example, my num -
ber starts with 36, which means I was
paying too much when I entered as a
freshman. Your number, Numbskull,
starts with a 38, which means you were
paying way too much as a freshman.
The next four digits are the results
from a character study. The first of those
four numbers is a contribution rating.
In other words, how much you can be
expected to contribute to the University
post graduation. The second number is
the expected number of years until grad
uation. Admissions never lets in people
they expect to take longer than nine
years, simply because it would screw up
the process of assigning ID numbers.

The next two numbers are success fac
tors. The first is the student's expected
academic success and the second is the
student's expected social success at the
Deke house on Friday nights. This second
number can be a pretty good indicator
of a person's m^jor.
The last number — and I'm not kidding
about this — is a check sum for the first
six numbers. This is why the Financial
Aids Office, for example, only types in
the first six numbers of your ID. You
can really learn a lot about a person from
their ID number. At parties I really don't
need to say, "Hi, my name is Bryan." I
could just say, "HI, 3605009," and you
already know a good deal about me.
So, Numbskull, this really isn't a new
trend, and I'm afraid I didn't even broach
the subject of any CIV connection for
fear of being labeled as biased in some
way.
