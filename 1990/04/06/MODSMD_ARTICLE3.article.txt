# Big cuts cloud Res Ed's future

Facing a budget reduction of
about $900,000, the Office of Res
idential Affairs will have to make
cuts that may dramatically change
the future of residential life at
Stanford.

ident fellows will probably be
reduced, dorm computer clusters
may be eliminated and less money
will be available for dorm educa

made for next academic year, with
the remaining two-thirds to take
effect in the 1991-92 school year.

plan involves reducing the num
ber of RAs in the dorms. Dorms
that currently have four RAs,
such as the all-freshman houses
in Wilbur and Stern Halls, would
only have three RAs, Supton said.
The dorms in Florence Moore
Hall, which currently have three
RAs, would have only two under
the new system.
The number of RAs in the eth
nic theme houses would also be
reduced from four to three, except
in Ujamaa House, which has more
residents than the other ethnic
houses, Supton added.
In the Row houses, the job of
an RA may also be redefined to
help save money. Row RAs may
no longer be responsible for edu
cational programming, Supton
said. They would retain the tasks
of emergency and crisis manage

would be responsible for educa
tional programming.
The RAs in the Suites may also
