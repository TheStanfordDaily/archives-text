# Big cuts cloud Res Ed's future
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
Facing a budget reduction of
about $900,000, the Office of Res
idential Affairs will have to make
cuts that may dramatically change
the future of residential life at
Stanford.
While no final decisions have
been made at this time, the num
ber of resident assistants and res
ident fellows will probably be
reduced, dorm computer clusters
may be eliminated and less money
will be available for dorm educa
tional programs.
The Office of Residential Edu
cation alone is planning to cut
about $438,000 from its budget,
according to Assoc. Dean Alice
Supton.
One-third of the cuts must be
made for next academic year, with
the remaining two-thirds to take
effect in the 1991-92 school year.
No cuts are definite, but one
plan involves reducing the num
ber of RAs in the dorms. Dorms
that currently have four RAs,
such as the all-freshman houses
in Wilbur and Stern Halls, would
only have three RAs, Supton said.
The dorms in Florence Moore
Hall, which currently have three
RAs, would have only two under
the new system.
The number of RAs in the eth
nic theme houses would also be
reduced from four to three, except
in Ujamaa House, which has more
residents than the other ethnic
houses, Supton added.
In the Row houses, the job of
an RA may also be redefined to
help save money. Row RAs may
no longer be responsible for edu
cational programming, Supton
said. They would retain the tasks
of emergency and crisis manage
ment and counseling. Volunteers
would be responsible for educa
tional programming.
The RAs in the Suites may also
be redefined in the same way,
Supton said. However, any
changes to the RA system will not
take place until the 1991-92 school
year.
Supton said Res Ed is not plan
ning to reduce the compensation
of dorm RAs from the current
level of 79 percent of room and
board.
To further cut its budget, Res
Ed is also considering changing
the resident fellow program.
Supton emphasized that Res Ed
has not fully thought about ways
to reduce and consolidate the
number of RFs. However, she
noted that reorganizing the resi
dent fellow system could poten
tially require rearranging the
whole housing system.
RFs will remain in freshman
dorms and in the ethnic theme
houses, Supton said. "We want
incoming students to have the ex
perience of resident fellows," she
said.
However, given the emphasis
placed on freshmen, some up
perclass houses may be left with
out RFs. "Fewer sophomores,
juniors and seniors will have the
chance to have an RF," Supton
noted. She said she does not want
to create a situation in which most
RFs are located on one side of
campus, and some housing might
have to be reclassified to prevent
this.
By reducing the number of RFs,
Res Ed will save the money spent
on paying for their families' room
and board, in addition to freeing
up more space to house students

in dorms without separate RF
quarters, Supton added.
The changes in the RF program
will also not be made until the
1991-92 academic year.
Supton noted that RA and RF
recruiting is already being af
fected by the planned cuts. "RFs
won't be able to know 200 stu
dents intimately," and some of the
applicants don't want the job if
it becomes too large, she said.
Res Ed will also have to reduce
the program funds for dorm ed
ucational activities. One program
that will most likely be cut or
drastically reduced is the guest
or artist-in-residence program in
which distinguished individuals
spend time in dorms working with
students.
In addition, RF funds, currently
used for some programs in the
dorms, will be reduced, and Res
Ed may no longer be able to un
derwrite ticket costs for artistic
and cultural events, Supton said.
Res Ed's ability to contribute
to events on campus, such as the
Martin Luther King Week celebra
tion, and to activities planned by
student organizations will also be
hindered.
Overall, the "richness of the
program" will be limited because
"the money won't be there," said
Supton. "For the student who
wants it, [the program] won't be
there in the same way. The
campus will be different."
Supton said she wants to
"preserve what is important about
Res Ed. What we continue to do,
we want to do well."
Another residence program af
fected by the budget cuts is the
residence computer program. In
fact, while not necessarily likely,

The roles of resi
dent fellows and
resident deans will
likely change to cut
expenses.

complete elimination of the resi
dence computer clusters is "not
out of the question," according to
Jeff Merriman, director of resi
dential computing.
Merriman said his program has
to cut $70,000 â€” about 25 percent
of his budget.
Even if the program is not to
tally cut, the budget reduction will
"definitely hinder service to stu
dents," Merriman said. Merriman
projects that at the very least, the
number of computer clusters will
be reduced, fewer residence com
puter coordinators will be hired,
and the computers now owned by
residential affairs will be con
solidated.
For example, in the best case
scenario, the eight clusters cur
rently in Wilbur Hall might be
reduced to four, Merriman said.
If the cuts have to be more drastic,
there might be one cluster for all
of Wilbur Hall.
Merriman is exploring several
other options. Residential Affairs
could begin charging students for
some computer services, for ex
ample. Merriman said he hopes
some other department might also
be able to absorb some of the
costs of running the residential
computer program.
The Stanford Housing Center
will also be forced to reduce its

services and perhaps, its staff. Ac
cording to director Rodger Whit
ney, the housing center has to cut
over $100,000 from its budget and
still try to provide students with
housing services.
In terms of services, the
housing center may eliminate
some of the activities associated
with the draw and streamline the
waiting list procedures to save
staff time, Whitney said.
The housing center will also
scale down its publications and
increase fees for some services,
such as listing off-campus
housing, Whitney added. The cur
rent practice of holding housing
deposits may have to be dropped,
thereby eliminating a staff posi
tion.
The role of the residence dean
is also very likely to change. Diana
Conklin, director of residence
deans, says her office must cut
$40,000 out of a budget of about
$205,000.
Because almost all of her
budget goes to pay staff salaries,
Conklin said two staff positions
may be cut. One position that may
be eliminated is the dean respon
sible for Mirrielees and students
living off-campus.
While Mirrielees would be given
to another dean, the off-campus
students might be left on their
own, she said.
The duties of the remaining res
idence deans will probably also be
reduced to compensate for the loss
of one or two deans. As one pos
sibility, deans may no longer be
involved in helping students with
academic and personal difficul
ties, Conklin said.
Conklin said she hopes the res
idence deans will not have to cen
tralize.
