## 'Superstar' frosh running all the way to record book 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
You want speed? All right, listen
up! This you cannot do:
The time is Sunday, March 11,
and the Stanford baseball team
is hosting Arizona. It's the bottom
of the third, and the Wildcats are
up 1-0.
The Cardinal's Jeff Hammonds
dances around near second base.
How'd he get there? A double to
left. Standup, of course. Now Troy
Paulsen is at the plate, waiting
for pitcher Don Pruitt to deliver.
Pruitt checks Hammonds,
waits, and throws to the plate.
Hammonds takes off, and Paulsen
hits a grounder to short. The ball
kicks off J.J. Northam's glove and
rolls five feet to his right. That's
not nearly enough for Hammonds
to score — he isn't even at third
when Northam first touches the
ball — so third-base coach Dean
Stotz tells him to stop.
Yeah, right. Hammonds con
veniently misses the signal and
rips toward home, not realizing
he doesn't have a chance in hell
of making it. No, change that:
Anyone else wouldn't have a
chance. As it turns out, Northam
— looking mighty shocked that
anyone would have the balls to
try and score from second on a
cheesy grounder — throws the
ball right into Hammonds' sliding
backside. Safe, one-all, Paulsen
ends up at second.
Scoring from second? On a
grounder to short? Are you al
lowed to do that? "I tried to stop
him, but I guess he had a better
angle on the play than I did," a
smiling Stotz says afterward. "It
sure surprised me. I think it sur
prised the shortstop too."
"Hey, I didn't want to defy
Coach," Hammonds says."I just

wanted to get something going."
Hammonds, the Cardinal's
freshman center fielder/leadoff
hitter/superstar, has done a heck
of a job "just getting something
going" all season.
You want hitting? Heading into
this weekend's series against
UCLA, Hammonds leads the Six-
Pac in batting (.384), is second in
runs (45) and triples (5), third in
on-base percentage (.469) and
fourth in hits (56).
You want defense? Hammonds
is a magnet in center: 34 games,
no errors. None.
You .want consistency? With a
hit today, Hammonds will tie Troy
Paulsen's school record of hitting
in 28 games in a row.
You want more speed? Ham
monds, who is already drawing
comparisons with the A's Rickey
Henderson, leads the Six-Pac with
26 steals and is well on his way
to smashing the school record of
43. This is a man who once stole
a base standing up.
You want pitching? No, no, no.
Enough is enough.
In fact, it's more than enough.
Just ask the Toronto Blue Jays,
who offered Hammonds a
$250,000 signing bonus to forget
about college. Or ask opposing
pitchers.
Heck, ask Paul Carey, who
knows a thing or two about talent.
"He's a superstar," Carey said at
the start of the season. "He's
going to make a huge impact."

No kidding? For all his skills,
though, it's Hammonds' speed —
flat-out, see-ya, catch-me-if-you
can speed — that has brought
him the most attention this
season. Fly balls that should fall
in the gaps become outs. Infield
choppers become adventures.
And most notably, when Ham
monds gets on first, pitchers dial
911. His natural ability will prob
ably carry him to Stanford's stolen
base record, which ain't bad for
someone who hasn't — that's has
not — always been the fastest
player on his teams.
"On my little-league team, I
wasn't the fastest," Hammonds
says. So who was? "A kid named
Jamil Joyner. He was two years
older than me. . . and he could
blow my doors off. I don't know
about now, but back then I was
always the second-fastest."
(Jamil, if you're reading this,
there are a few recruiters who'd
like a word with you.)
Actually, when Hammonds first
came to school, he was so inex
perienced on the basepaths that
he had no clue how to steal. Yeah,
that's right. Jeff Hammonds, the
player USC Coach Mike Gillespie
called "the best base-stealer in the
nation," came to school last Sep
tember with the baserunning
technique of, well . .
"What technique?" Hammonds
laughs. "1 didn't have a technique
(before coming to Stanford), not
at all. I didn't know how to get
jumps, didn't know how to take
a lead. . . Coming here, I knew
that I could do nothing but learn
how to steal bases, 'cause I never
knew how to. I would take a three
step lead and just rely on my
speed, and hopefully I'd get there
in time." Hopefully.


Not only can't anyone catch freshman Jeff Hammonds — the center fielder leads the Card nine in
steals with 26 — he has surged to the forefront of the Slx-Pac in hits and batting percentage as well.
Any reason for this? "When it
came down to stealing bases or
learning how to hit a curveball
on the outside corner, every time
I would want to learn how to hit,"
Hammonds says. "Stealing bases
wasn't important to me."
Wasn't important? "Not at all.
(My coaches) wanted me to, but
I never thought it was important,"
Hammonds says."I never valued
the ability to steal a base until I
got here. No one ever told me
'Jeff, you should steal more
bases."'
Actually, Hammonds was prob
ably too busy knocking the crap
out of the ball for anyone to tell
him to do more in high school.
At Scotch Plains (N.J.) High,
Hammonds batted .542 as a soph
omore (which led the state) and
then hit .420 and .450 the next
two seasons. With scouts and pro
teams falling all over each other
to get at him, though, Hammonds

decided to commit to Stanford in
April of last year, two months
before the mayor-league draft.
"I wanted to sign early, commit
early, just to get it out of the
way," Hammonds says. The Blue
Jays took a chance on him in the
ninth round anyway, and offered
him the quarter million.
No dice. Hammonds' brother
Reggie, who graduated from
Northwestern, played in the
Pirates organization for several
years before an injury ended his
career, and Jeff took the lesson
to heart. "I won't say that came
down heavy in the whole decision,
(but) it's a thought in the back
of your mind, to get hurt," Ham
monds says. "That was evident.
We had to think about it. It had
happened; it was reality for our
family.
"There were other factors, too,"
Hammonds continues, "like
whether or not I was ready to
start my profession. Was I ready
as a person to just drop every
thing? Games would have been
over. I make a mistake, I'm out,

and where am I looking? I'm
looking at Burger King or
McDonald's, and hopefully I'll
meet somebody at a sporting
goods chain and maybe sell shoes
for a living.
"I wanted to go to college, and
if you're going to go, you might
as well go to the best."
And you might as well be the
best once you get there. Besides
the steals mark, Hammonds could
conceivably break school single
season records in hits (108), runs
(80) and triples this year.
And then there's that hitting
streak. Hammonds has gone hit
less in a game exactly once all
season, against Sacramento State
"I feel as though that's what
you're supposed to do as a ball
player: You're supposed to go out
and try to get a hit," Hammonds
says."And my pop's coming out
this weekend. After (Sacramento)
I thought 'Hey, my pop's coming
out for the UCLA weekend, maybe
I can get a hit every game until
he comes out here.' I've had it so
far."

(My coaches) wanted me to, but
I never thought it was important,"
Hammonds says."I never valued
the ability to steal a base until I
got here. No one ever told me
'Jeff, you should steal more
bases."'
Actually, Hammonds was prob
ably too busy knocking the crap
out of the ball for anyone to tell
him to do more in high school.
At Scotch Plains (N.J.) High,
Hammonds batted .542 as a soph
omore (which led the state) and
then hit .420 and .450 the next
two seasons. With scouts and pro
teams falling all over each other
to get at him, though, Hammonds

decided to commit to Stanford in
April of last year, two months
before the mayor-league draft.
"I wanted to sign early, commit
early, just to get it out of the
way," Hammonds says. The Blue
Jays took a chance on him in the
ninth round anyway, and offered
him the quarter million.
No dice. Hammonds' brother
Reggie, who graduated from
Northwestern, played in the
Pirates organization for several
years before an injury ended his
career, and Jeff took the lesson
to heart. "I won't say that came
down heavy in the whole decision,
(but) it's a thought in the back
of your mind, to get hurt," Ham
monds says. "That was evident.
We had to think about it. It had
happened; it was reality for our
family.
"There were other factors, too,"
Hammonds continues, "like
whether or not I was ready to
start my profession. Was I ready
as a person to just drop every
thing? Games would have been
over. I make a mistake, I'm out,

and where am I looking? I'm
looking at Burger King or
McDonald's, and hopefully I'll
meet somebody at a sporting
goods chain and maybe sell shoes
for a living.
"I wanted to go to college, and
if you're going to go, you might
as well go to the best."
And you might as well be the
best once you get there. Besides
the steals mark, Hammonds could
conceivably break school single
season records in hits (108), runs
(80) and triples this year.
And then there's that hitting
streak. Hammonds has gone hit
less in a game exactly once all
season, against Sacramento State
"I feel as though that's what
you're supposed to do as a ball
player: You're supposed to go out
and try to get a hit," Hammonds
says."And my pop's coming out
this weekend. After (Sacramento)
I thought 'Hey, my pop's coming
out for the UCLA weekend, maybe
I can get a hit every game until
he comes out here.' I've had it so
far."
You want speed? All right, listen
up! This you cannot do:
The time is Sunday, March 11,
and the Stanford baseball team
is hosting Arizona. It's the bottom
of the third, and the Wildcats are
up 1-0.
The Cardinal's Jeff Hammonds
dances around near second base.
How'd he get there? A double to
left. Standup, of course. Now Troy
Paulsen is at the plate, waiting
for pitcher Don Pruitt to deliver.
Pruitt checks Hammonds,
waits, and throws to the plate.
Hammonds takes off, and Paulsen
hits a grounder to short. The ball
kicks off J.J. Northam's glove and
rolls five feet to his right. That's
not nearly enough for Hammonds
to score — he isn't even at third
when Northam first touches the
ball — so third-base coach Dean
Stotz tells him to stop.
Yeah, right. Hammonds con
veniently misses the signal and
rips toward home, not realizing
he doesn't have a chance in hell
of making it. No, change that:
Anyone else wouldn't have a
chance. As it turns out, Northam
— looking mighty shocked that
anyone would have the balls to
try and score from second on a
cheesy grounder — throws the
ball right into Hammonds' sliding
backside. Safe, one-all, Paulsen
ends up at second.
Scoring from second? On a
grounder to short? Are you al
lowed to do that? "I tried to stop
him, but I guess he had a better
angle on the play than I did," a
smiling Stotz says afterward. "It
sure surprised me. I think it sur
prised the shortstop too."
"Hey, I didn't want to defy
Coach," Hammonds says."I just

wanted to get something going."
Hammonds, the Cardinal's
freshman center fielder/leadoff
hitter/superstar, has done a heck
of a job "just getting something
going" all season.
You want hitting? Heading into
this weekend's series against
UCLA, Hammonds leads the Six-
Pac in batting (.384), is second in
runs (45) and triples (5), third in
on-base percentage (.469) and
fourth in hits (56).
You want defense? Hammonds
is a magnet in center: 34 games,
no errors. None.
You .want consistency? With a
hit today, Hammonds will tie Troy
Paulsen's school record of hitting
in 28 games in a row.
You want more speed? Ham
monds, who is already drawing
comparisons with the A's Rickey
Henderson, leads the Six-Pac with
26 steals and is well on his way
to smashing the school record of
43. This is a man who once stole
a base standing up.
You want pitching? No, no, no.
Enough is enough.
In fact, it's more than enough.
Just ask the Toronto Blue Jays,
who offered Hammonds a
$250,000 signing bonus to forget
about college. Or ask opposing
pitchers.
Heck, ask Paul Carey, who
knows a thing or two about talent.
"He's a superstar," Carey said at
the start of the season. "He's
going to make a huge impact."

No kidding? For all his skills,
though, it's Hammonds' speed —
flat-out, see-ya, catch-me-if-you
can speed — that has brought
him the most attention this
season. Fly balls that should fall
in the gaps become outs. Infield
choppers become adventures.
And most notably, when Ham
monds gets on first, pitchers dial
911. His natural ability will prob
ably carry him to Stanford's stolen
base record, which ain't bad for
someone who hasn't — that's has
not — always been the fastest
player on his teams.
"On my little-league team, I
wasn't the fastest," Hammonds
says. So who was? "A kid named
Jamil Joyner. He was two years
older than me. . . and he could
blow my doors off. I don't know
about now, but back then I was
always the second-fastest."
(Jamil, if you're reading this,
there are a few recruiters who'd
like a word with you.)
Actually, when Hammonds first
came to school, he was so inex
perienced on the basepaths that
he had no clue how to steal. Yeah,
that's right. Jeff Hammonds, the
player USC Coach Mike Gillespie
called "the best base-stealer in the
nation," came to school last Sep
tember with the baserunning
technique of, well . .
"What technique?" Hammonds
laughs. "1 didn't have a technique
(before coming to Stanford), not
at all. I didn't know how to get
jumps, didn't know how to take
a lead. . . Coming here, I knew
that I could do nothing but learn
how to steal bases, 'cause I never
knew how to. I would take a three
step lead and just rely on my
speed, and hopefully I'd get there
in time." Hopefully.


Not only can't anyone catch freshman Jeff Hammonds — the center fielder leads the Card nine in
steals with 26 — he has surged to the forefront of the Slx-Pac in hits and batting percentage as well.
Any reason for this? "When it
came down to stealing bases or
learning how to hit a curveball
on the outside corner, every time
I would want to learn how to hit,"
Hammonds says. "Stealing bases
wasn't important to me."
Wasn't important? "Not at all.
(My coaches) wanted me to, but
I never thought it was important,"
Hammonds says."I never valued
the ability to steal a base until I
