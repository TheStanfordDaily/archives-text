# Spikers look to avenge southern losses
## No. 5 Stanford hoping to redeem defeats at hands of USC, UCLA at Pepsi Classic 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Four weeks ago, the word of the day
scrawled on the chalk board in Burnham Pa
vilion was probably "maintain." This week,
it's most definitely "redeem."
The No. 5 Stanford men's volleyball team,
which fell from its early pedestal atop the
NCAA after two perilous road trips to South
ern California last month, will seek to redeem
itself in its final venture south for the season
this weekend. The team plays in the Diet
Pepsi Collegiate Volleyball Classic at UCLA
today and tomorrow and against conference
rival Pepperdine on Monday.
The tournament will feature four of the
elite teams in the country as No. 1 UCLA,
N0.2 USC, and No. 10 UCSB will accompany
the Cardinal to the invitational.
The matches will be played in best-of-five
NCAA format, but because the competition
is a tournament, the results will not affect
WIVA conference standings and is inconse
quential to the playoff situation.
The contest will nevertheless provide Stan
ford with a gauge by which it can measure
its prospects. USC, the only squad in the
country that has swept Stanford 3-0 this
season, will be the first opponent for the
Cardinal tonight. This match will serve as a
preview for next Friday's competition with

the Trojans at home, a conference match Stan
ford must win.
The Trojans feature perhaps the top player
in the nation in U.S. national team member
Bryan Ivie. Ivie, who hits most types of sets
from all positions on the court, currently leads
the country in kills-per-game average with
7.5. Ivie pounded away at will against Stanford
during the March 10 meeting between the
two squads.
The Cardinal hopes to answer the offensive
threat with the addition of 6-foot-9 middle
blocker Adam Keefe. The Stanford basketball
sensation, who will travel with the team after
only a week of practice, has commandeered
a backup role and offers the team both height
and enhanced hitting power.
Should Stanford defeat USC, they will face
the winner of the UCLA/UCSB match on Sat
urday. Both this final and the Stanford/USC
contest will be televised live on XTV. The No.
1 Bruins are high on the Cardinal blacklist,
as UCLA has defeated Stanford twice this
season.
While insignificant to WIVA standings, the
tournament is of decided importance for its
probable effect on team morale. "We've been
struggling," Ail-American middle blocker Dan
Hanan said. "We've got to be ready to play.
Our high priority is to gain momentum."
"We are looking for a chance to play better,"
Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves said.

That opportunity may be somewhat inhib
ited by last week's injury of senior starting
setter Parker Blackman. After being confined
to crutches for the early part of the week,
Blackman practiced temporarily on Wednes
day, setting a few balls. His status, however,
remains day-today.
As such, Coach Fred Sturm will play it safe
and carry three setters on the trip.
