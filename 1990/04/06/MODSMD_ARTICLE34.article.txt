# Southern foes expected to be a racketful

Seven letters give Stanford men's ten
nis coach Dick Gould headaches: U-C
li-A and U-S-C. That's five, if you don't
count the U and C twice.
Indeed, Gould gets fidgety whenever
he hears those letters. "It's never easy
playing UCLA and USC. Never."
Team captain Barry Richards ex
plained, "It doesn't matter if one team
is having a good year and the other
isn't. We always have tight matches with
UCLA and USC."
The Bruins come to Cardinal country
with especially impressive credentials.
With a record of 19-2, UCLA has
amassed more wins than any team in
collegiate tennis.
"UCLA is on a roll," Gould said.
"They have good doubles teams, and
their results against other teams have
been comparable to ours.
"They are at least one of the top
three teams in the country. It is going
to be a dogfight," he added.
Cardinal freshman Jonathan Stark,
who recently moved to the No. 2 spot
in the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings,
will have his hands full with UCLA's
Jason Netter, who is ranked No. 20.
"(Netter) is a hot and cold player. You
have to be extremely careful because
he can come up with some great match
es," Gould said.
UCIJV sophomores Bill Barber and
Mark Quinney won the Pacific 10 Con
ference doubles title last year and should
provide Stark and Jared Palmer, the
No. 2-ranked doubles team in the coun
try, with their first real challenge of
the dual meet season.
"Coach Gould has a lot of respect for

UCLA's Coach [Glenn Bassett)," junior
Glenn Solomon said. "[Bassett] always
has them ready to play. I'm sure they
will be especially pumped to break our
winning streak. Hopefully, everyone will
be ready."
According to Gould, USC is one of
the most underrated teams in the coun
try. Despite their No. 11 ranking, Gould
said the Trojans probably have one of
the five best teams in collegiate tennis.
USC's squad features tennis players
from six different nations including
Canada, Hungary, Algeria, Switzerland,
Zimbabwe and the United States. Three
of USC'B top players compete on their
respective Davis Cup teams.
Byron Black, USC's No. 1-ranked
player, was recently ranked No. 5 in
the country in singles. In addition,
Black and teammate Kent Seton were

ranked No. 4 in doubles. Black was
undefeated as a member of the Zim
babwe Davis Cup team.
Mehdi Benjebka, USC's No. 2-ranked
competitor, plays in the No. 1 spot on
Algeria's Davis Cup team. Freshman
Andras Lanyi, who sits in the No. 4
spot, competed as a member of Hun
gary's Davis Cup team.
"They are a sleeping giant," Gould
said. "As their foreign players get used
to playing college tennis, they are only
going to get better."
Stanford has a small grudge to bear
with USC. It was the Trojans who
handed the Cardinal its last dual meet
loss April 8 of last year. Stanford's win
ning streak now stands at 27 matches.
Although Stanford's No. 6-ranked
player, Alexis Hombrecher, will miss
today's match, the Cardinal enters the
weekend exceptionally strong. Along
with Stark's No. 2 ranking, sophomore
Alex O'Brien recently moved to the No.
10 spot in the Volvo rankings.
Palmer, who just returned from a pro
fessional tournament in Orlando, Fla.,
seems to be improving each match after
his knee operation earlier in the season.
Palmer jumped to No. 35 in the Volvo
poll and probably will continue to rise.
Senior Jeff Cathrall and junior Glenn
Solomon also are playing well. Compet
ing at No. 3 last Tuesday against Long
Beach State, Cathrall played one of his
best matches of the year, defeating
Marco Redaelli 6-3, 6-4.
In the No. 4 singles spot, Solomon
continued his consistent play, double
bageling Long Beach State's Nader
Fartyi 6-0, 6-0.
The players are hoping to fill Stanford
Tennis Stadium this weekend.
