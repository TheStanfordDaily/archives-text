# Golfers face tough field in raisin capital tourney
## 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
Stanford men's golf coach
Wally Goodwin "heard it
through the grapevine" that
the Fresno Classic would be
among the season's most chal
leging events for the Cardinal
linksters.
Then he saw a list of the
sterling field doing battle in
California's raisin capital.
In its quest for the team title,
the Cardinal will have to best
17 teams hailing from the
NCAA's Western region. The
squad will seek to overcome the
challenge presented by such
skilled district foes as Arizona,
Arizona State and host Fresno,
ail of whom hope to improve
their postseason chances by
gaining a head-to-head victory
over Stanford.
As if Goodwin did not have
enough to focus on, one of
Japan's finest collegiate teams,
Nippon University, has crossed
the Pacific to improve an al

ready talent-laden tourney.
Thus, the coach was not ex
aggerating when he described
the Fresno event as "one of the
toughest tournaments" for the
Cardinal this year.
"All of these teams are gun
ning to knock us off before
NCAA regionals in May. The
pressure is on our guys and it
will be a great challenge to see
how well we respond," Good
win said.
Ranked twentieth nationally
in the latest Golf World/Taylor-
Made poll, Stanford will be rep
resented in this potentially
explosive intercollegiate by four
seniors and junior Johan Rem
melgas. Joining the Swedish
junior college transfer will be
Brad Benbrook, Don Christian
sen, Marc Funseth arid Brad
Geer.
Notable by his absence is
sophomore Christian Cevaer,
who failed to qualify for a tour
nament for the first time in
his brief yet brilliant Stanford
career.
