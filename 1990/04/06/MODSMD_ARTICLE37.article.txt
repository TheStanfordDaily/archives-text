# Top-ranked women netters take on struggling conference foes
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
The Los Angeles road trip has
traditionally provided some of the
most exciting action of the season
for the Stanford women's tennis
team.
Last year, Tami Whitlinger was
locked in a battle with USC's
hard-hitting Trisha Laux. If Whit
linger had iost the match, Stan
ford ran the risk of being tied 3-3
after singles.
The Cardinal sophomore had
not lost a dual match all season,
but was in jeopardy of falling to
Laux. Whitlinger was battling a
severe stomach ailment and was
unable to eat breakfast before the
morning match.
After splitting the first two sets,
Laux jumped ahead 5-2 and
seemed to be in control. Coach
Frank Brennan nearly threw in
the towel for Whitlinger at that
point.
But the coach knew his No. 1
player wouldn't give in with the
team in trouble. He let her go on
and, suddenly, she began to go
off. Whitlinger battled back to 3-5,
4-5, 5-5 . . . 6-5.
Laux tied it up at 6-6 but Whit
linger emerged from the tie
breaker on top. Stanford's unde
feated record was preserved.

Heading into this season, the
tennis fan could have hoped for
more of the same. UCLA (18-2,
ranked No. 2 in the nation) re
turned all the starters from last
season's NCAA runners-up and
promised to challenge the Cardi
nal for the top spot in college
tennis.
Their cause would be enhanced
by the addition of freshmen Kim
berly Po and Cammie Foley.
USC (17-2, ranked No. 4) had
Laux back along with Stephanie
London, Lupita Novelo and a top
recruit named Linda Harvey-
Wild.
Things have hardly gone ac
cording to plan for Stanford's So-
Cal foes. The Bruins have
struggled with their lineup this
season, often playing Mamie
Ceniza at No. 2 singles.
While Ceniza is a solid player,
her position in the second spot is
a tactical move by Bruins Coach
Bill Zaima to strengthen the bot
tom of the lineup while sacrificing
some strength at the top.
Po has been out for most of the
past month and a half with an
elbow injury. She had been playing
in the middle of the singles lineup.
Still, UCLA has found a way
to win nearly every match. Work
ing in Stanford's favor is the fact

that the Cardinal has never lost
a match at the Bruins' mag
nificent tennis facility. Stanford
has won a pair of NCAA titles
there as well.
For the Trojans, things have
gone surprisingly well. With
Harvey-Wild atop their lineup,
USC might have been considered
a legitimate darkhorse at the na
tional championships in May.
But Harvey-Wild decided —
after one semester of school —
that she was ready to move on to
the professional tour. Wednesday,
while her former teammates were
preparing for this weekend s ac
tion, Harvey-Wild was losing to
Katerina Maleeva in the Family
Circle Cup at Hilton Head, S.C.
The Cardinal has had little but
good news in 1990. Maintaining
its No. 1 ranking throughout the
year, Stanford has cruised to an
18-0 record behind what may be
the best team assembled in the
history of collegiate tennis.
Junior Sandra Birch lost her
first match of the season last
weekend at the University of San
Diego to Aby Brayton. Other than
that, she has been spectacular.
Meredith McGrath, Debbie
Graham and Teri Whitlinger all
are undefeated in dual-match
play.
