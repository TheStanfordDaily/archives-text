# Gymnasts gunnine for NCAAs
## Tough field awaits Pac-10 champions at Western Regionals 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
One down, two to go.
That was the feeling after the
men's gymnastics team landed
first place at last week's Pacific
10 Conference Championships.
The second leg of their journey
to a national title wiii take place
this Saturday in Norman, Okla.,
when the Cardinal competes in
the Western Regionals.
Only the 10 teams that have
accumulated the highest all
around scores during the season
are invited to compete. The four
squads that emerge with the top
all-around totals will advance to
the NCAA Championships, where
they will face the top four teams
from the East.
Stanford is ranked third behind
Nebraska and Ceil State-Fullerton
in the Western division, and the
Cardinal is currently holding
down the fifth spot nationally.
Saturday's meet will give the team
a chance to prove itself against
squads it has not competed with

all season, including top-ranked
Nebraska, which has won six of
the last eleven national titles.
"If we perform like we did last
week, there's no doubt in my mind
that we can be one of the top
four," Coach Sadao Hamada said.
"If we're consistent, we're capable
of scoring even higher than we
did in Pac-lOs."
The Cardinal racked up 280.2
points in that competition, and
Hamada feels that a score of over
280 points will be necessary again
to qualify for the national cham
pionships.
"It's definitely going to be
tight," freshman Jair Lynch said.

"We can't just walk through it.
With only 1.5-2.0 points separat
ing the top five teams (going into
the competition), whoever can get
the most hits and eliminate all
the small reductions will win."
The fact that the field must be
reduced to the top four teams
from each side of the country also
makes the competition more dif
ficult. In the past, 10 teams have
been allowed to compete in the
NCAA Championships.
In addition to the four teams,
12 individuals from each regional
competition will earn a trip to
Minnesota. This will allow top
gymnasts from non-qualifying
teams a chance at national com
petition. The Cardinal, however,
hopes to travel as a unit.
"If we hit our dismounts, stick
our landings and make everything
look really nice, we have a
chance," junior Tim Wang said.
The other teams competing
against Stanford this weekend are
UCLA, Arizona State, Oklahoma,
New Mexico, California, Brigham
Young and San Jose State.
