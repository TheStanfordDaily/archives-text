# Cardinal has one last hurrah

After being given new life by the NCAA, the
Stanford women's gymnastics team will continue
its season at the NCAA regional meet tomorrow
night. The meet at UCLA's Wooden Gymnasium
kicks off at 7:30 p.m.
Stanford is looking to improve on its seventh-place
regional standing with a strong performance. The
final regional standing is determined by a combi
nation of the average of the team's top five regular
season scores and the score in this meet.
"With a good performance, we could end up fifth
at regionals," Coach Breck Greenwood said. "Our
goal for this meet will be the same as always. We
want to be aggressive, enjoy it, and look like we're
enjoying it. When we've accomplished that in the
past, we've done well."
A team berth in the NCAA Championships, al
though not a mathematical impossibility, is unlikely.
The Cardinal does have three all-around performers
who are strong candidates for individual spots in
the meet, however.
Senior Dina Amoroso went to Nationals the last
two years and has been the Cardinal's top all-around

performer this year.
Freshman Erin McCann and junior Jennifer
Bloom will also be out to impress the judges in the
all-around. Bloom appears to be peaking at about
the right time, coming off a personal best score of
37.7 at last week's meet at San Jose State.
Seniors Becky Ashton and Susan Banta will likely
be competing in their last meet for Stanford. Ashton,
an Economics major from Agoura, California, will
compete in vault, balance beam and floor exercise.
Banta, who in addition to Amoroso is a co-captain
of the squad, has recovered from the virus which
kept her out of last week's meet. She will compete
on bars and floor exercise and will replace sopho
more Nicki Kobrine on vault. Kobrine sprained her
ankle near the end of practice Thursday and will
miss the competition.
While the meet allows the Cardinal to end the
season on a high note, it also serves as the deciding
match-up in the five-meet series with Boise State.
The Broncos defeated the Cardinal at the first two
meetings, in Boise and Seattle. Stanford came back
to win the next clashes, at Bumham Pavilion and
in Fullerton, and is looking to gain the season
advantage in Los Angeles tomorrow.
