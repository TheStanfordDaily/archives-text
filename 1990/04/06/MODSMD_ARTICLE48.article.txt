## Go ahead ... get off the Farm

OVER 100 YEARS ago, John Muir stood at the
head of Pacheco Pass to look down upon Cali
fornia's heartland bathed in the morning light:
"I saw a landscape . . . that after all my wanderings
still appears as the most divinely beautiful and sublime
I have ever beheld. There at my feet lay the great central
plain of California, level as a lake, 30 or 40 miles wide,
400 miles long, one rich furred bed of gold.
"And along the eastern shore of this lake of gold rose
the mighty Sierra, miles in height, in massive, tranquil
grandeur, so gloriously colored and so radiant that it
seemed not clothed with light, but wholly composed of
it, like the wall of some celestial city. . . . Then it seemed
to me the Sierra should be called, not the Nevada or
Snowy Range, but the Range of Light."
Less frequently these days do we see such crystal-clear
skies, when the Sierra seems only a stone's throw away.
Muir's lake of gold is now traversed by highways, its
fertile soil furred not with wild grasses but with alfalfa,
tomatoes, fruit orchards and vineyards. Today giant
windmills dot the hillsides of Altamont and the Pacheco
Pass, where Muir stood to survey lus sublime landscape.
To be sure, the face of the land has changed. But they

don't call it the Golden State for nothing. From the
dawn-burnished granite walls of Yosemite to the yellow
flecks of light glinting amid the sailboats on San Francisco
Bay, to the honey-colored sands of Santa Cruz at sunset,
California flaunts the hues of its untarnished beauty.
With this issue of Off the Farm, we want to tempt
you with that beauty and entice you into aesthetic aban
don. Leave the gold sandstone of the Quad behind and
head toward a Sierra sunrise. Take a morning sail on
the Ray. Rise in a hang glider to meet the sun. Spend a
lazy afternoon fishing for striped bass. Find peace in the
grass-floored cathedrals of baseball.
Whether you're looking for quiet ventures or thrilling
adventures, amusement-park diversions or amazing des
tinations, the Golden State is filled with hidden treasures
that glisten in the springtime sun.
So go on a treasure hunt.
So get a life.
So get off the Farm!
