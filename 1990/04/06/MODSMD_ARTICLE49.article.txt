# Pounding hooves, thundering waves
## Take a morning ride at Half Moon Bay 
### Janine De Fao 
WHETHER YOU'RE looking
for a romantic sunset outing
or iust want to spend the
day horsing around, get off the Farm
and get to Sea Horse Ranch, iust a
horseshoe's toss away in Halt Moon
Bay.
The family-owned ranch offers
horseback rides both on nearby trails
and right on the beach.
Never been riding before? Never
tear. From their 100 horses, the Sea
Horse ranch hands can find a match

for a rider of any level — from the
New York native who's never ridden
anything but the subway to the Texas
rodeo winner. Still nervous? Ask for
Peso, about which one worker said,
"You could strap a baby to his saddle,
and I mean an infant, and [the baby]
would be uist fine."
Once you have met your new com
panion be it Cognac or Cougar,
Queenie or Judy, Maverick or Goose
you'll be set to saddle up and get
on the trail Before you get started,
you'll receive a crash course on leg,
verbal and reign commands — in

other words, how to jump start a
horse and then make him or her stop.
A guide will accompany you for
the tirst 15 minutes to show you the
trail and make sure you have control
of your horse. After that, you're on
your own — unless you'd like to hire
a guide. It's not necessary to have a
guide for safety purposes, since there
are three riders with walkie-talkies
stationed along the trail to handle
problems, injuries or runaway horses.
According to owner Terry Shipley,
accidents are rare, with only three or
four occurring each month — a small


Damian MarhefKa Dally
fraction compared to the hundreds of
riders who go out daily.
Once you start riding, it's impor
tant to establish a relationship with
your horse. They all know their
names and will respond. It's also nec
essary to let your horse know who's
in charge. They definitely have wills
of their own and will lead you —
instead of the other way around —
unless you assert that you are the
boss. Don't be afraid to use your
heels, reins and voiee to communi
cate with your horse.
When you're riding in a group, be
especially careful not to let your horse
go faster than a speed at which you're
comfortable. If the other horses speed
up, your horse will want to be right
up there with them because they like
to ride together. If it's more then you
can handle, you might lose your bal
ance, which is how most accidents
happen. Be firm with your horse.
"WHOA!!" usually works nicely.
Starting out at a walk may feel like
a comfortable beginning speed, but
sooner or later boredom is bound to
set in. Try a trot, and if that feels
good, a canter. Even a beginner can
work up to a gallop — which is really

where the fun starts.
Once you're down on the sand, you
begin to sense that you and your
horse are establishing a rhythm. Go
with it! You become less self
conscious about gripping the reins
and stop worrying about falling off.
You start to watch the waves rolling
in, as you clutch the back of your
horse's neck. You feel the sun beating
down and the wind blowing through
your hair. All of a sudden, you realize
your knuckles are no longer white
and your legs aren't cramping from
holding on for dear life.
You're having fun. And the horse
is having fun. Somehow you can just
tell.
Once you reach that point, you
may want to stay all day. But, alas,
things won't be as much fun when
you wake up the next morning and
try to walk. Unless you're an avid
rider, it's not uncommon to feel the
effects of a couple hours on horseback
for the next couple days.
The ranch is open seven days a
week, from 8 a.m. until sunset.
Rates start at $12 an hour and
decrease with added time — $18 for
an hour and a half, $23 for two hours,

$46 for five, and $85 for eight.
Groups of 10 or more receive a $1
discount per person, but need to call
ahead for reservations. Barbecue and
picnic facilities are also available.
Sea Horse Ranch also offers the
option of leasing a horse for $105 a
month; the horse is kept and cared
for at the ranch and the leaser receives
15 hours of riding time on any of
the horses.
Guides are available for $15 an
hour, regardless of group size.
Sea Horse Ranch is located only
about a half an hour away, one mile
north of Half Moon Ray on Highway
1. For directions, group reservations
or more information, call 726-2362.
Practically next door is Friendly
Acres Ranch, which offers similar
outings. For $12 per hour, $15 per
hour-and-a-half or $20 per two hours,
riders can venture out with or without
a guide; there is no extra charge for
a guide. Friendly Acres is open from
8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., seven days a
week and reservations are required
for groups of seven or more. It is
located just north of Sea Horse Ranch
on Highway 1. For more information,
call 726-9871. OTT

WHETHER YOU'RE looking
for a romantic sunset outing
or iust want to spend the
day horsing around, get off the Farm
and get to Sea Horse Ranch, iust a
horseshoe's toss away in Halt Moon
Bay.
The family-owned ranch offers
horseback rides both on nearby trails
and right on the beach.
Never been riding before? Never
tear. From their 100 horses, the Sea
Horse ranch hands can find a match

for a rider of any level — from the
New York native who's never ridden
anything but the subway to the Texas
rodeo winner. Still nervous? Ask for
Peso, about which one worker said,
"You could strap a baby to his saddle,
and I mean an infant, and [the baby]
would be uist fine."
Once you have met your new com
panion be it Cognac or Cougar,
Queenie or Judy, Maverick or Goose
you'll be set to saddle up and get
on the trail Before you get started,
you'll receive a crash course on leg,
verbal and reign commands — in

other words, how to jump start a
horse and then make him or her stop.
A guide will accompany you for
the tirst 15 minutes to show you the
trail and make sure you have control
of your horse. After that, you're on
your own — unless you'd like to hire
a guide. It's not necessary to have a
guide for safety purposes, since there
are three riders with walkie-talkies
stationed along the trail to handle
problems, injuries or runaway horses.
According to owner Terry Shipley,
accidents are rare, with only three or
four occurring each month — a small

fraction compared to the hundreds of
riders who go out daily.
Once you start riding, it's impor
tant to establish a relationship with
your horse. They all know their
names and will respond. It's also nec
essary to let your horse know who's
in charge. They definitely have wills
of their own and will lead you —
instead of the other way around —
unless you assert that you are the
boss. Don't be afraid to use your
heels, reins and voiee to communi
cate with your horse.
When you're riding in a group, be
especially careful not to let your horse
go faster than a speed at which you're
comfortable. If the other horses speed
up, your horse will want to be right
up there with them because they like
to ride together. If it's more then you
can handle, you might lose your bal
ance, which is how most accidents
happen. Be firm with your horse.
"WHOA!!" usually works nicely.
Starting out at a walk may feel like
a comfortable beginning speed, but
sooner or later boredom is bound to
set in. Try a trot, and if that feels
good, a canter. Even a beginner can
work up to a gallop — which is really

where the fun starts.
Once you're down on the sand, you
begin to sense that you and your
horse are establishing a rhythm. Go
with it! You become less self
conscious about gripping the reins
and stop worrying about falling off.
You start to watch the waves rolling
in, as you clutch the back of your
horse's neck. You feel the sun beating
down and the wind blowing through
your hair. All of a sudden, you realize
your knuckles are no longer white
and your legs aren't cramping from
holding on for dear life.
You're having fun. And the horse
is having fun. Somehow you can just
tell.
Once you reach that point, you
may want to stay all day. But, alas,
things won't be as much fun when
you wake up the next morning and
try to walk. Unless you're an avid
rider, it's not uncommon to feel the
effects of a couple hours on horseback
for the next couple days.
The ranch is open seven days a
week, from 8 a.m. until sunset.
Rates start at $12 an hour and
decrease with added time — $18 for
an hour and a half, $23 for two hours,

$46 for five, and $85 for eight.
Groups of 10 or more receive a $1
discount per person, but need to call
ahead for reservations. Barbecue and
picnic facilities are also available.
Sea Horse Ranch also offers the
option of leasing a horse for $105 a
month; the horse is kept and cared
for at the ranch and the leaser receives
15 hours of riding time on any of
the horses.
Guides are available for $15 an
hour, regardless of group size.
