# Hospital to lay off 100
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Facing reduced revenues and high oper
ating costs, Stanford Hospital announced
layoffs of about 100 employees yesterday.
"Given the growing concern about the
cost of health care, this is the only prudent
and responsible action to take," Hospital
President Kenneth Bloem said in a press
release.
The layoffs are part of a program de
signed to reduce the hospital's 1990-91
budget by $27 million. While the hospital
does not have a deficit now, it could face
a $30 to $35 million deficit without these
cuts.
The layoffs will take place between now
and the end of August, with the majority
occurring this month. The hospital is ac
tually removing 384 jobs, but about three
fourths of the positions will be terminated
by not refilling vacancies created by those
who retire or quit.
Malmda Mitchell, acting chief operating
officer, said the layoffs are in "almost every
single department." About 17 percent of
management positions and 9 percent of
staff positions have been laid ofT. Mitchell
said these layoffs are the only ones occur
ring at this time to reduce the budget, but

she did not rule out further layoffs in the
future.
The hospital is facing financial problems
because of high operating costs and reduced
occupancy. It is receiving less revenue due
to an increase in outpatient care, which
reduces the number of patients staying at
the hospital. Currently, the hospital is filled
to 70 percent capacity.
"We need a fully occupied hospital" in
order to meet financial needs, Bloem said.
Hospital revenue is further reduced by
an increase in uninsured or underinsured
patients coming for treatment. Bloem said
that while these patients pose a financial
problem, the hospital would not turn them
away.
In order to stay ahead of the reduced
income, the hospital has been forced to
raise prices. However, two New York con
sulting firms contracted by Bloem found
that without budget cuts the hospital's
prices would not be competitive.
Bloem gave warnings of possible layoffs
in December when the budget cuts were
first announced. In a letter to hospital
employees, he wrote, "If layoffs are neces
sary, we will look carefully at attrition and
other options in order to minimize the
hardship for our employees."
All those laid off were informed
yesterday by letter.
According to Mitchell, some em
ployees have been moved to posi
tions in other departments. She
said she has not heard any mcyor
outcry from the workers yet.
However, a number of workers
are upset. "A lot of people are
real ticked off," said a worker in
the hospital transport depart
ment, who wished to remain anon
ymous.
