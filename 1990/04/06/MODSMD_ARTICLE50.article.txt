# Wind beneath your wings
## Learn to hang glide at Santa Cruz beach 
### Geoff Goldman 
YOU LOOK DOWN and see the ground tailing awa
from your feet. Suspended only by a metal tram
and dacron wings, you may never get any close
to Icarus' dream.
Maybe you've felt tempted to try hang gliding, bu
you've hesitated because you think it's too dangerouj
But contrary to what you might believe, you don't bcgn
hang gliding by lumping right off a clift.
"Hang gliding is actually the least dangerous way t
fly," according to Roger Watson, manager ot Missio
Soaring Center, one of the Ray Area's premier hang-glidin
schools
It's very relaxing," Watson added. "If you get good .
it, you have total control.
"Hang gliding is actually very easy to learn, Watso
said. "It takes some getting used to, but once you di
it's very intuitive."
In fact, someone with absolutely no previous expenenc
can be in the air on his first day of training. Accordin
to Watson, beginners generally fly off of a gently slope
training hill. On the first few flights, you are no moi
than four to tive feet off of the ground.
"It was wild," said sophomore Nat Timmins after li

first hang-gliding lesson. "I've never done anything quite
like it." How does Timnnns describe learning to hang
glide on a 40-foot slope at the beach on a warm day?
"Exhilarating."
For part of the lesson, the instructor held on to his
feet to keep him from going too high, although at one
point he accidentally went about 25 feet above the ground,
he said.
Most beginners don't soar so high. At the beginner
stage, gliding students learn basic takeoff and landing
skills, Watson said. At Mission Soaring Center, students
are videotaped and also spend time in the classroom.
They receive personalized instruction and advance at
their own pace, according to Watson.
Timmins said he had a lot of misconceptions going
into his tirst lesson, and he was "surprised at how easy
it was." However, Timmins noted that the amount of
tune it takes to he proficient at hang gliding is one of
its only drawbacks.
Timmins added that he did not realize that living a
hang glider is such an extremely delicate task
You control a hang glider by pushing or pulling on
the bar below you, thereby changing the center of gravity
of the glider. But it you grab tightly onto the bar, you
are likely to make a nose dive and end up with your

face in the sand, Timmins noted.
To prevent this, instructors tell you to "lightly tap
your fingers on the bar," according to Timmins.
After the first lesson on the "bunny hill," aspiring
gliders have the opportunity to see what advanced hang
gliding is really like. Going up in a tandem glider with
an instructor, you can experience soaring and high alti
tude flight, and get a taste of what the future holds.
As you move toward that future of flight, you will
move on to higher hills and learn to work on turns,
Watson said.
Watson's company has four different hang-gliding lo
cations around the Bay Area, including the "bunny lull"
on the beach north of Santa Cruz, a location in Pleasanton
and, for more advanced gliders, a facility in Nig Sur.
Once an instructor decides you arc ready, you can try
to achieve a novice rating. At the novice level, you go a
bit higher and work on making turns. Novice level gliders
may practice on 600-foot hills and may go as high as
200 feet above the ground, Watson said.
It generally takes about 10 to 15 lessons to become
fairly comfortable with the basics of gliding and obtain
a novice rating.
If you get hooked on hang gliding, you can attempt
an intermediate rating. To achieve such a rating, you
must wait four months during which you accumulate
several hours of in-flight experience.
Once you move up to the intermediate level, you begin
to learn the art of soaring. Unlike gliding, where you
start at the top of a lull and glide down to the bottom,
soaring lets you stay airborne as long as you want,
Watson said. You soar by finding thermals and updrafts

which allow you to gain altitude.
With an intermediate rating, you can fly in a variety
of places. Watson mentioned that many intermediates
fly at several locations in Marin County, near Fort Ord
and at Rig Sur.
After at least a year of training, you can try for an
advanced rating, which allows you to fly at such places
as Glacier Point in Yosemite National Park and Mt.
Diablo in the East Bay. Advanced gliders also embark
on longer, cross-country tlights ; Watson said flights cover
ing 50 miles arc not uncommon.
Once you are an advanced glider, the sky is really the
limit. The world record for being in the air is 34 hours,
and the longest tlight in terms of distance covered 278
miles.
Of course, getting to that level takes a lot of practice
and training, which Watson is happy to provide. Mission
Soaring Center is currently running a special discount
in April for Stanford students. For about $59 each, Wat
son's lessons include four hours of air and classroom
time. You also get all of the hang-gliding equipment
needed tor your lesson. Watson is also offering package
discounts for a series of lessons.
Mission Soaring Center is the oldest and largest hang
gliding school in the Hay Area and has over 1,000 students
every year â€” none of whom have ever been seriously
injured during training. Mission Soaring Center's main
facility is located .it 1116 Wrigley Way in Milpitas.
Reservations for lessons and other information can be
obtained by calling (408) 262-1055.
Both Timmins and Watson agreed, "It's definitely
worthwhile to try it once " OTT
