# At the water's edge
## A
						look at marine life in the Pacific tidepools 
### Janine De Fao 
IMAGINE SPENDING YEARS searching tor that pot
of gold at the end of the rainbow — and finding it.
You'd be happy. You'd have reached a long-awaited
goal. And you'd be rich
But now imagine linding that prize without having
looked for it. You'd still be rich, but your happiness
would be so much greater after having gamed something
yoti never even knew existed.
So it is with the hidden treasures of the California
coast — the tide pools and marine lite. Once you stumble
across them, you'll be much richer tor the experience
And just like any treasure-hunter, you'll face the tough
decision ot sharing your find with others or keeping it
your own little secret.
There's something almost sacred about the tide pools.
Many ot the areas .ire located right ott the highwav, but

most arc well-hidden troni the road. And once you step
into that undisturbed marine environment, you feci as
it you're entering another world an almost prehistoric
kingdom where the sea creatures have ruled tor centuries,
left untouched by destructive human hands.
Hermit crabs, each possessing a distinct and colorful
shell, can be seen scurrying around in their little crab
cities Giant starfish and barnacles cling to the rocks,
looking like perfect National Geographic photos.
Anemones cover the rocks, hidden by sand, but make
their presence known by squirting as you step on them.
And spiny purple sea urchins live in pockets deep in the
pools, resembling Koosh Ball breeding farms
But I've seen it all before, you say, listing the numerous
aquariums you've visited. The tide pools are different,
however. Because they're outdoors, and right on the
shoreline, they lack that almost hospital-like feel that
aquariums sometimes have
