# At the water's edge
## A 						look at marine life in the Pacific tidepools 
### Janine De Fao 
IMAGINE SPENDING YEARS searching tor that pot
of gold at the end of the rainbow — and finding it.
You'd be happy. You'd have reached a long-awaited
goal. And you'd be rich
But now imagine linding that prize without having
looked for it. You'd still be rich, but your happiness
would be so much greater after having gamed something
yoti never even knew existed.
So it is with the hidden treasures of the California
coast — the tide pools and marine lite. Once you stumble
across them, you'll be much richer tor the experience
And just like any treasure-hunter, you'll face the tough
decision ot sharing your find with others or keeping it
your own little secret.
There's something almost sacred about the tide pools.
Many ot the areas .ire located right ott the highwav, but

most arc well-hidden troni the road. And once you step
into that undisturbed marine environment, you feci as
it you're entering another world an almost prehistoric
kingdom where the sea creatures have ruled tor centuries,
left untouched by destructive human hands.
Hermit crabs, each possessing a distinct and colorful
shell, can be seen scurrying around in their little crab
cities Giant starfish and barnacles cling to the rocks,
looking like perfect National Geographic photos.
Anemones cover the rocks, hidden by sand, but make
their presence known by squirting as you step on them.
And spiny purple sea urchins live in pockets deep in the
pools, resembling Koosh Ball breeding farms
But I've seen it all before, you say, listing the numerous
aquariums you've visited. The tide pools are different,
however. Because they're outdoors, and right on the
shoreline, they lack that almost hospital-like feel that
aquariums sometimes have

These life-filled pools are like a mixture of the Ex
ploratorium, the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Land
of the Lost. You want to climb the rocks and go as far
as you can, to sec and touch and feel all the nature
around you. The beauty is so natural, so raw, so different
that you can only compare it to movie scenes. You want
to explore, to make believe — reminiscent of grammar
school days when even the local creek was an adventure
in itself.
But really, how exciting arc invertebrates? you insist.
Well, if lower life forms aren't your bag, you may even
be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of California's cel
ebrated sea lions, sunning themselves on rocky islands
just off the coast, or frolicking in the waves only yards
away from you.
And if you're looking to get a little closer to some
furry sea friends, Ario Nucvo State Reserve, located 30
miles south of Half Moon Bay on Highway 1, offers a
chance to view molting elephant seals from points along
a trail staffed by naturalists. Visitors pay a $3 parking
fee and are given non-guided access to the rookery.

The 45-acre reserve offers 450 species of animals and
150 species of plants. It is open free of charge from dawn
to dusk, seven days a week. Visitors can explore the park
unguided or take a walk with a naturalist. Walks arc
filled on a first-come, first-served basis.
The reserve information guides suggest that explorers
wear rubber boots or old tennis shoes, since some of
the tooting is often slippery. T hey also recommend that
visitors pick up a copy of Pacific Intertidal Life — about
$2 in any bookstore — to familiarize themselves with
some of the species they will see.
Most importantly, they stress that because the tidepools
arc part of a reserve, nothing living or dead can be
removed from the grounds.
