# In the presence of mountain majesties

FOR THOSE WHO view its
splendor for the first time, the
California coastline, its beaches
flowing gold in the sunset for hun
dreds of miles from Mexico to
Oregon, can seem like the very shores
of Elysium. When the sun is warm
and the wind is gentle, one knows
moments of pagan paradise.
Rut for the pilgrim who wanders
eastward through the golden
heartland of California, to ascend fi
nally among the towering peaks of
the Sierra Nevada, the glacier-carved
granite walls of Yoscmite Valley glit
tering in the morning sun can seem
like the very City of God. That City
of the Apocalypse, with streets of gold
so pure they are transparent, could
not he more dazzling than this
sculpted wilderness of hanging val
leys, foaming cascades, and ice
polished domes rising above the basin
floor like jeweled towers.
Indeed, Yosemitc Valley is the
crown jewel of Yosemitc National
Park, celebrating its centennial as a
national park on Oct. 1, 1990. Known
as "The Incomparable Valley,"
Yoscmite boasts stunning vistas and
thriving, delicate wildlife â€” images
of which are preserved in the brilliant
photographs of Ansel Adams.
In fact, the Ansel Adams Gallery
at the Yosemitc Valley Visitor Center
houses some of that photographer's
finest work. The Gallery is just one
of many exhibits that give visitors
unfamiliar with the riches of
Yosemitc a chance to learn about the
history and beauty of the park
According to the National Park
Service, Yosemitc Valley was carved
from the granite mountains in three
successive periods of glaciation during
the last great ice age The valley floor,
eroded by both ice and (lowing water,
rests at 4,000 feet above sea level.
Towering above the tloor are
several granite domes and monoliths.
The most famous of these landmarks,
Half Dome, looks as if it were cleft
with a giant wedge and hammer. In
fact, the flat face of the dome repre
sents the plane along which a scam
ran through the rock.

Yosemite Valley was
carved from the
granite mountains in
three successive peri
oils of glaciation dur
ing the last great ice
age. The valley floor,
eroded by both ice
and flowing water,
rests at 4,000 feet
above sea level.

As the sculpting glacier ground its
way past Half Dome, placing a strain
on the granite, the rock fell away
along the seam. Those with the
courage to climb the face of Half
Dome can see striations in the rock
which represent the "highwater"
mark of the glacier.
Because springtime weather in
Yosemite is often unpredictable, the
Half Dome Climb is an excursion to
be postponed until the summer
months. Rut the same weather con
ditions that make Half Dome treac
herous in the spring make the
waterfalls and cascades of Yosemite
Valley breathtakingly magnificent.
According to the National Park
Service, May and June are the best
months for viewing the waterfalls of
the valley. During spring, melting
snows swell the headwaters of
Yosemite Falls, the highest falls in
North America. From the visitor cen
ter you can take a shuttle bus to the
the Lower Falls. You'll then enjoy an
easy, 20-minutc walk to the churning
base of the waterfall.
In addition to Yosemite Falls, the
roaring ribboned waters of Venial and
Bridalveil falls arc a springtime sight
you won't want to miss.
Yosemite's landscape is so power
ful you won't be able to absorb it in
one visit. But its beauty is also so
enticing that you'll want to take it
all in at once. To sec as much of
Yosemite as you can during your day
in the park, take the Valley Floor
tour. For $12.50, you can ride on an
open-air tram or an enclosed bus for
a two-hour guided tour of key
sightseeing spots on the valley floor.
The guides on the tour are equipped
with a wealth of information about
the geology, history and wildlife of
the region.
It you postpone your trip to the
Sierras until the summer months,
you can take advantage of the oppor
tunity to explore some of Yosemite's
high country. The highest
campgrounds in the park are nestled
at about 8,500 feet above sea level
at Tuolumne Meadows, an alpine
flatland rimmed by ice-shattered
crags which hold the last remnants
of true elaciers
