# In the presence of mountain majesties

### Lora Dawn Headrick 
FOR THOSE WHO view its
splendor for the first time, the
California coastline, its beaches
flowing gold in the sunset for hun
dreds of miles from Mexico to
Oregon, can seem like the very shores
of Elysium. When the sun is warm
and the wind is gentle, one knows
moments of pagan paradise.
Rut for the pilgrim who wanders
eastward through the golden
heartland of California, to ascend fi
nally among the towering peaks of
the Sierra Nevada, the glacier-carved
granite walls of Yoscmite Valley glit
tering in the morning sun can seem
like the very City of God. That City
of the Apocalypse, with streets of gold
so pure they are transparent, could
not he more dazzling than this
sculpted wilderness of hanging val
leys, foaming cascades, and ice
polished domes rising above the basin
floor like jeweled towers.
Indeed, Yosemitc Valley is the
crown jewel of Yosemitc National
Park, celebrating its centennial as a
national park on Oct. 1, 1990. Known
as "The Incomparable Valley,"
Yoscmite boasts stunning vistas and
thriving, delicate wildlife — images
of which are preserved in the brilliant
photographs of Ansel Adams.
In fact, the Ansel Adams Gallery
at the Yosemitc Valley Visitor Center
houses some of that photographer's
finest work. The Gallery is just one
of many exhibits that give visitors
unfamiliar with the riches of
Yosemitc a chance to learn about the
history and beauty of the park
According to the National Park
Service, Yosemitc Valley was carved
from the granite mountains in three
successive periods of glaciation during
the last great ice age The valley floor,
eroded by both ice and (lowing water,
rests at 4,000 feet above sea level.
Towering above the tloor are
several granite domes and monoliths.
The most famous of these landmarks,
Half Dome, looks as if it were cleft
with a giant wedge and hammer. In
fact, the flat face of the dome repre
sents the plane along which a scam
ran through the rock.

Yosemite Valley was
carved from the
granite mountains in
three successive peri
oils of glaciation dur
ing the last great ice
age. The valley floor,
eroded by both ice
and flowing water,
rests at 4,000 feet
above sea level.

As the sculpting glacier ground its
way past Half Dome, placing a strain
on the granite, the rock fell away
along the seam. Those with the
courage to climb the face of Half
Dome can see striations in the rock
which represent the "highwater"
mark of the glacier.
Because springtime weather in
Yosemite is often unpredictable, the
Half Dome Climb is an excursion to
be postponed until the summer
months. Rut the same weather con
ditions that make Half Dome treac
herous in the spring make the
waterfalls and cascades of Yosemite
Valley breathtakingly magnificent.
According to the National Park
Service, May and June are the best
months for viewing the waterfalls of
the valley. During spring, melting
snows swell the headwaters of
Yosemite Falls, the highest falls in
North America. From the visitor cen
ter you can take a shuttle bus to the
the Lower Falls. You'll then enjoy an
easy, 20-minutc walk to the churning
base of the waterfall.
In addition to Yosemite Falls, the
roaring ribboned waters of Venial and
Bridalveil falls arc a springtime sight
you won't want to miss.
Yosemite's landscape is so power
ful you won't be able to absorb it in
one visit. But its beauty is also so
enticing that you'll want to take it
all in at once. To sec as much of
Yosemite as you can during your day
in the park, take the Valley Floor
tour. For $12.50, you can ride on an
open-air tram or an enclosed bus for
a two-hour guided tour of key
sightseeing spots on the valley floor.
The guides on the tour are equipped
with a wealth of information about
the geology, history and wildlife of
the region.
It you postpone your trip to the
Sierras until the summer months,
you can take advantage of the oppor
tunity to explore some of Yosemite's
high country. The highest
campgrounds in the park are nestled
at about 8,500 feet above sea level
at Tuolumne Meadows, an alpine
flatland rimmed by ice-shattered
crags which hold the last remnants
of true elaciers
Tuolumne Meadows, White Wolf
and other campgrounds higher than
the valley floor don't open until early
summer — the exact date depends
on die amount of unmelted snow
remaining on the ground, and on how
soon the pipes to the restrooms thaw.
Still, it's not too early to start making
plans. You can reserve a campsite in
any campground in the park through
Ticketron.
Meanwhile, during the spring
months you can pitch tent in one of
several campgrounds on the valley
floor. Some campgrounds, such as
the Upper and Lower Pines camps,
are open only from April to October
or November and require Ticketron
reservations. But the Sunnyside walk
in campground in Yosemite Valley
and the campground in Wawona arc
open year-round and operate on a
first-come, first-served basis.
In addition to the park entrance
fee of $5 (good for one week), most
campgrounds in Yosemite assess a
fee of $12 per night. Rut the Sun
nyside Walk-In — for people who
don't bring a car into the park
charges only $2 per person.
If you've never been camping before
— at least not where bears come
strolling through the campsite of an
evening, foraging for pre-cooked
"people food" — you should contact
the public affairs office of Yosemite
National Park. You can call the office
at (209) 372-0248, or write to them
at P.O. Box 577, Yosemite, CA
95389. Public affairs officers will pro
vide you with a packet of information
about the many of ways in which
you can enjoy the splendid beauty of
the park.
That beauty, re-emerging now from
beneath a cloak of melting snow,
reposes only a few hours away from
Stanford.
It takes about three-and-a-half
hours by car to reach El Portal, the
main entrance to the park. Take the
San Mateo bridge across the bay to
Interstate 880 north. After about
three miles of northbound traffic,
you'll come to the 238-580 inter
change. Take the 238 exit to Castro
Valley and merge with Interstate 580
east.
The Interstate will take you over
the Altamont Pass. On the eastern
side of the pass, take Interstate 205
east, past Tracy and Manteca. As you

country, page 49

near Mantcca, watch for the signs
for Highway 120.
Take Highway 12 0 toward
Modesto, then get on Highway 99
south. (Although yon can reach
Yosemitc via Highway 120 through
Sonora, the El Portal entrance is the
only route regularly cleared of snow
and ice until the summer months.)
Highway 99 will take you south
through Modesto and other Central
Valley towns to Merced, known as
the "Gateway to Yosemitc."
In Merced, take the Yosemitc
Parkway exit to connect with High
way 140 east. Highway 140, rising
through the rolling foothills toward
the Sierra Nevada, is the main road
into the valley.
If you don't have a car, the best
way to reach Yosemitc is through one
of two special shuttle services oper
ating out of Merced, California. The
best way to reach Merced is by
Amtrak. The cost of a round-trip train
ticket to Merced (I wouldn't buy a
one-way fare) ranges from $36 on
normal operating days to $44 during
selected holidays.
The 7 a.m. train from the Amtrak
depot on Ist and Mission Streets in
San Francisco will bring you to the
Merced depot around 10:30 a.m. A
bus from California Yosemitc Tours
will be waiting at the train station
to take passengers to Yosemitc. For
$28 you can purchase round-trip
transportation on the tour bus. Or,
for $45.95, you can enjoy an all-day
guided tour in Yosemitc Valley, in
cluding lunch at the picturesque yet
pricey Ahwahnee Hotel. Call CYT at
(209) 383-1563 for more information.
Unfortunately, an "all-day" tour
with CYT means only four hours in
Yosemitc Valley — the bus returns
to Merced by 6:15 p.m., in time for
the evening train to San Francisco.
If you'd like to spend more time
in Yosemitc — including an overnight
stay in or near the park — or if you'd
just like to catch a later train, then
board the 10:35 a.m. Amtrak from
San Francisco. Unless the train is
running very late, you should reach
the Merced depot in plenty of time
to join a Via Company tour of
Yosemite.
The Via bus leaves the Merced
Greyhound station at 2:45 p.m. and
arrives at the Yosemite Lodge in time
for dinner at 5:10 p.m. OTF

Yosemite is often unpredictable, the
Half Dome Climb is an excursion to
be postponed until the summer
months. Rut the same weather con
ditions that make Half Dome treac
herous in the spring make the
waterfalls and cascades of Yosemite
Valley breathtakingly magnificent.
According to the National Park
Service, May and June are the best
months for viewing the waterfalls of
the valley. During spring, melting
snows swell the headwaters of
Yosemite Falls, the highest falls in
North America. From the visitor cen
ter you can take a shuttle bus to the
the Lower Falls. You'll then enjoy an
easy, 20-minutc walk to the churning
base of the waterfall.
In addition to Yosemite Falls, the
roaring ribboned waters of Venial and
Bridalveil falls arc a springtime sight
you won't want to miss.
Yosemite's landscape is so power
ful you won't be able to absorb it in
one visit. But its beauty is also so
enticing that you'll want to take it
all in at once. To sec as much of
Yosemite as you can during your day
in the park, take the Valley Floor
tour. For $12.50, you can ride on an
open-air tram or an enclosed bus for
a two-hour guided tour of key
sightseeing spots on the valley floor.
The guides on the tour are equipped
with a wealth of information about
the geology, history and wildlife of
the region.
It you postpone your trip to the
Sierras until the summer months,
you can take advantage of the oppor
tunity to explore some of Yosemite's
high country. The highest
campgrounds in the park are nestled
at about 8,500 feet above sea level
at Tuolumne Meadows, an alpine
flatland rimmed by ice-shattered
crags which hold the last remnants
of true elaciers
Tuolumne Meadows, White Wolf
and other campgrounds higher than
the valley floor don't open until early
summer — the exact date depends
on die amount of unmelted snow
remaining on the ground, and on how
soon the pipes to the restrooms thaw.
Still, it's not too early to start making
plans. You can reserve a campsite in
any campground in the park through
Ticketron.
Meanwhile, during the spring
months you can pitch tent in one of
several campgrounds on the valley
floor. Some campgrounds, such as
the Upper and Lower Pines camps,
are open only from April to October
or November and require Ticketron
reservations. But the Sunnyside walk
in campground in Yosemite Valley
and the campground in Wawona arc
open year-round and operate on a
first-come, first-served basis.
In addition to the park entrance
fee of $5 (good for one week), most
campgrounds in Yosemite assess a
fee of $12 per night. Rut the Sun
nyside Walk-In — for people who
don't bring a car into the park
charges only $2 per person.
If you've never been camping before
— at least not where bears come
strolling through the campsite of an
evening, foraging for pre-cooked
"people food" — you should contact
the public affairs office of Yosemite
National Park. You can call the office
at (209) 372-0248, or write to them
at P.O. Box 577, Yosemite, CA
95389. Public affairs officers will pro
vide you with a packet of information
about the many of ways in which
you can enjoy the splendid beauty of
the park.
That beauty, re-emerging now from
beneath a cloak of melting snow,
reposes only a few hours away from
Stanford.
It takes about three-and-a-half
hours by car to reach El Portal, the
main entrance to the park. Take the
San Mateo bridge across the bay to
Interstate 880 north. After about
three miles of northbound traffic,
you'll come to the 238-580 inter
change. Take the 238 exit to Castro
Valley and merge with Interstate 580
east.
The Interstate will take you over
the Altamont Pass. On the eastern
side of the pass, take Interstate 205
east, past Tracy and Manteca. As you

near Mantcca, watch for the signs
for Highway 120.
Take Highway 12 0 toward
Modesto, then get on Highway 99
south. (Although yon can reach
Yosemitc via Highway 120 through
Sonora, the El Portal entrance is the
only route regularly cleared of snow
and ice until the summer months.)
Highway 99 will take you south
through Modesto and other Central
Valley towns to Merced, known as
the "Gateway to Yosemitc."
In Merced, take the Yosemitc
Parkway exit to connect with High
way 140 east. Highway 140, rising
through the rolling foothills toward
the Sierra Nevada, is the main road
into the valley.
If you don't have a car, the best
way to reach Yosemitc is through one
of two special shuttle services oper
ating out of Merced, California. The
best way to reach Merced is by
Amtrak. The cost of a round-trip train
ticket to Merced (I wouldn't buy a
one-way fare) ranges from $36 on
normal operating days to $44 during
selected holidays.
The 7 a.m. train from the Amtrak
depot on Ist and Mission Streets in
San Francisco will bring you to the
Merced depot around 10:30 a.m. A
bus from California Yosemitc Tours
will be waiting at the train station
to take passengers to Yosemitc. For
$28 you can purchase round-trip
transportation on the tour bus. Or,
for $45.95, you can enjoy an all-day
guided tour in Yosemitc Valley, in
cluding lunch at the picturesque yet
pricey Ahwahnee Hotel. Call CYT at
(209) 383-1563 for more information.
Unfortunately, an "all-day" tour
with CYT means only four hours in
Yosemitc Valley — the bus returns
to Merced by 6:15 p.m., in time for
the evening train to San Francisco.
If you'd like to spend more time
in Yosemitc — including an overnight
stay in or near the park — or if you'd
just like to catch a later train, then
board the 10:35 a.m. Amtrak from
San Francisco. Unless the train is
running very late, you should reach
the Merced depot in plenty of time
to join a Via Company tour of
Yosemite.
The Via bus leaves the Merced
Greyhound station at 2:45 p.m. and
arrives at the Yosemite Lodge in time
for dinner at 5:10 p.m. OTF

FOR THOSE WHO view its

moments of pagan paradise.
Rut for the pilgrim who wanders
eastward through the golden
heartland of California, to ascend fi
nally among the towering peaks of

crown jewel of Yosemitc National
Park, celebrating its centennial as a
national park on Oct. 1, 1990. Known
as "The Incomparable Valley,"

history and beauty of the park
According to the National Park
Service, Yosemitc Valley was carved
from the granite mountains in three
successive periods of glaciation during
the last great ice age The valley floor,
eroded by both ice and (lowing water,
rests at 4,000 feet above sea level.
Towering above the tloor are
several granite domes and monoliths.
The most famous of these landmarks,
Half Dome, looks as if it were cleft
with a giant wedge and hammer. In
fact, the flat face of the dome repre
sents the plane along which a scam

In addition to the park entrance
fee of $5 (good for one week), most
campgrounds in Yosemite assess a
fee of $12 per night. Rut the Sun
nyside Walk-In — for people who
don't bring a car into the park
charges only $2 per person.
If you've never been camping before
— at least not where bears come
strolling through the campsite of an
evening, foraging for pre-cooked
"people food" — you should contact
the public affairs office of Yosemite
National Park. You can call the office
at (209) 372-0248, or write to them
at P.O. Box 577, Yosemite, CA
95389. Public affairs officers will pro
vide you with a packet of information
about the many of ways in which
you can enjoy the splendid beauty of
the park.
That beauty, re-emerging now from
beneath a cloak of melting snow,
reposes only a few hours away from
Stanford.
It takes about three-and-a-half
hours by car to reach El Portal, the
main entrance to the park. Take the
San Mateo bridge across the bay to
Interstate 880 north. After about
three miles of northbound traffic,
you'll come to the 238-580 inter
change. Take the 238 exit to Castro
Valley and merge with Interstate 580
east.
The Interstate will take you over
the Altamont Pass. On the eastern
side of the pass, take Interstate 205
east, past Tracy and Manteca. As you

near Mantcca, watch for the signs
for Highway 120.
Take Highway 12 0 toward
Modesto, then get on Highway 99
south. (Although yon can reach
Yosemitc via Highway 120 through
Sonora, the El Portal entrance is the
only route regularly cleared of snow
and ice until the summer months.)
Highway 99 will take you south
through Modesto and other Central
Valley towns to Merced, known as
the "Gateway to Yosemitc."
In Merced, take the Yosemitc
Parkway exit to connect with High
way 140 east. Highway 140, rising
through the rolling foothills toward
the Sierra Nevada, is the main road
into the valley.
If you don't have a car, the best
way to reach Yosemitc is through one
of two special shuttle services oper
ating out of Merced, California. The
best way to reach Merced is by
Amtrak. The cost of a round-trip train
ticket to Merced (I wouldn't buy a
one-way fare) ranges from $36 on
normal operating days to $44 during
selected holidays.
The 7 a.m. train from the Amtrak
depot on Ist and Mission Streets in
San Francisco will bring you to the
Merced depot around 10:30 a.m. A
bus from California Yosemitc Tours
will be waiting at the train station
to take passengers to Yosemitc. For
$28 you can purchase round-trip
transportation on the tour bus. Or,
for $45.95, you can enjoy an all-day
guided tour in Yosemitc Valley, in
cluding lunch at the picturesque yet
pricey Ahwahnee Hotel. Call CYT at
(209) 383-1563 for more information.
Unfortunately, an "all-day" tour
with CYT means only four hours in
Yosemitc Valley — the bus returns
to Merced by 6:15 p.m., in time for
the evening train to San Francisco.
If you'd like to spend more time
in Yosemitc — including an overnight
stay in or near the park — or if you'd
just like to catch a later train, then
board the 10:35 a.m. Amtrak from
San Francisco. Unless the train is
running very late, you should reach
the Merced depot in plenty of time
to join a Via Company tour of
Yosemite.
The Via bus leaves the Merced
Greyhound station at 2:45 p.m. and
arrives at the Yosemite Lodge in time
for dinner at 5:10 p.m. OTF
