# Go for the sold

THEY DON'T CALL IT the Golden State tor not
hin'.
When James Marshall discovered gold at Slitter's
Mill on January 24, 1848, men and women flocked to
California by the millions to make their fortunes in
mining and prospecting. In the process of pursuing their
gilded dreams, the '49ers and their followers brought
muscle, manpower and money to transform quiet, rural

California into a populous,
prosperous region.
Today California, known for
beach hums and boogie
boards, would not he the bel
lwether beacon of America if
it weren't for the bullion
bearing hills of the Sierra
Nevada.
Well, technically, you don't
find gold ingots in a quartz
vein or a stream bed. But if
you go goldpanning in the foot
hills of the Sierras, you can
find plenty of gold flakes and
even some nuggets.
Unless you're incredibly
lucky, an afternoon of goldpan
ning won't earn you enough
to pay for a meal at Tresidder.
But this vocation-turned
pastime is a fun, relaxing way
to spend a sunny spring after
noon in California. And, after
140 years of prospecting,
there's still enough gold in
"them thar hills" to make
Leland Stanford's millions
look like pocket change.
But don't rush out to San
Francisquito creek with a
Irving pan; you won't find any
gold in the Foothills near the

Farm. Instead, you'll need to make the eastward trek
through California's heartland, the San Joaquin Valley.
It takes about three hours to get to the Gold Country
from Stanford. Take the San Mateo bridge across the bay
to Interstate 880 north. After about three miles of dense
Nimitz traffic, you'll come to the 238-580 interchange.
Take die 238 exit to Castro Valley and you'll merge with
Interstate 580 east.

The Interstate will take you through a forest of giant
windmills that would make even Quixote cower. On the
eastern side of the pass, take Interstate 205 east, past
the Bay Area bedroom communities of Tracy and Man
teca. As you're nearing Manteca (which, by the way,
means "lard" in Spanish), get onto Highway 120.
It you just want to get a flavor for the history of
California's Gold Rush heyday without getting your hands
dirty, take Highway 120 toward Sonora, near the northern
entrance to Yosemite National Park. Sonora is a small

mountain community only a
few miles away from Colum
bia State Park, one of Califor
nia's most unusual historical
treasures.
The entire town of Colum
bia, including saloons, a black
smith s h op, woo d c n
sidewalks, horsedrawn car
nages, and a one-celled brick
jail, has been frozen in time
to preserve the aura of a
bygone era. This once-thriving
community of ruffians,
prospectors, prostitutes, Chi
nese mine and rail workers
and Miwok Indians still
retains the gritty allure of its
halcyon days. Take a walk
through the church cemetery
and read the weathered
headstones — the dead sleep
ing quietly now once shoul
dered their way along
sidewalks crammed with
people pursuing a golden
dream of instant fortune.
If you'd like to take a stab
at making your own fortune
m gold — or at iust making
enough to pay your tuition,
which works out to roughly
the same thing — you can try

your luck in any of the creeks or rivers whose waters
(low over or through the Mother Lode, a thick quartz
vein running through the granite mountains of the Sierras
in Placer and Tuolumne counties. The Stanislaus River
that runs past Sonora and Jamestown would he a great
place to pan.
But it you'd like to combine your treasure hunt with
a look at the priceless treasures of Yosemite National
