THEY DON'T CALL IT the Golden State tor not

When James Marshall discovered gold at Slitter's
Mill on January 24, 1848, men and women flocked to
California by the millions to make their fortunes in
mining and prospecting. In the process of pursuing their
gilded dreams, the '49ers and their followers brought
muscle, manpower and money to transform quiet, rural

California into a populous,
prosperous region.
Today California, known for
beach hums and boogie
boards, would not he the bel
lwether beacon of America if
it weren't for the bullion
bearing hills of the Sierra
Nevada.
Well, technically, you don't
find gold ingots in a quartz
vein or a stream bed. But if
you go goldpanning in the foot
hills of the Sierras, you can
find plenty of gold flakes and
even some nuggets.
Unless you're incredibly
lucky, an afternoon of goldpan
ning won't earn you enough
to pay for a meal at Tresidder.
But this vocation-turned
pastime is a fun, relaxing way
to spend a sunny spring after
noon in California. And, after
140 years of prospecting,
there's still enough gold in
"them thar hills" to make
Leland Stanford's millions
look like pocket change.
But don't rush out to San
Francisquito creek with a
Irving pan; you won't find any
gold in the Foothills near the

Farm. Instead, you'll need to make the eastward trek
through California's heartland, the San Joaquin Valley.
It takes about three hours to get to the Gold Country
from Stanford. Take the San Mateo bridge across the bay
to Interstate 880 north. After about three miles of dense
Nimitz traffic, you'll come to the 238-580 interchange.
Take die 238 exit to Castro Valley and you'll merge with
Interstate 580 east.

The Interstate will take you through a forest of giant
windmills that would make even Quixote cower. On the
eastern side of the pass, take Interstate 205 east, past
the Bay Area bedroom communities of Tracy and Man
teca. As you're nearing Manteca (which, by the way,
means "lard" in Spanish), get onto Highway 120.
It you just want to get a flavor for the history of
California's Gold Rush heyday without getting your hands
dirty, take Highway 120 toward Sonora, near the northern
entrance to Yosemite National Park. Sonora is a small

mountain community only a
few miles away from Colum
bia State Park, one of Califor
nia's most unusual historical
treasures.
The entire town of Colum
bia, including saloons, a black
smith s h op, woo d c n
sidewalks, horsedrawn car
nages, and a one-celled brick
jail, has been frozen in time
to preserve the aura of a
bygone era. This once-thriving
community of ruffians,
prospectors, prostitutes, Chi
nese mine and rail workers
and Miwok Indians still
retains the gritty allure of its
halcyon days. Take a walk
through the church cemetery
and read the weathered
headstones — the dead sleep
ing quietly now once shoul
dered their way along
sidewalks crammed with
people pursuing a golden
dream of instant fortune.
If you'd like to take a stab
at making your own fortune
m gold — or at iust making
enough to pay your tuition,
which works out to roughly
the same thing — you can try

your luck in any of the creeks or rivers whose waters
(low over or through the Mother Lode, a thick quartz
vein running through the granite mountains of the Sierras
in Placer and Tuolumne counties. The Stanislaus River
that runs past Sonora and Jamestown would he a great
place to pan.

park, you shouldn't head toward Sonora. Instead, take
Highway 120 toward Modesto, then get on Highway 99
south.
Highway 99 will take you through some of the most
fertile farmland in the world, highlighted by the emerald
green fields that surround Merced, a quiet Central Valley
community known as the "Gateway to Yosemite."
Alter you've driven along Highway 99 through the
less-picturesque portions of Merced, take the Yosemite
Parkway exit to connect with Highway 140 east. Highway
140, rising through the rolling foothills of the stunning
Sierra Nevada mountains, will take you right to the heart
of goldpanning country.
About 40 miles northeast ot Merced sits the mountain
town of Mariposa. Before you drive into town, stop at
Dial's Rock Shop, located to your light along a cut ot
the Agua Fria Creek. Ralph Dial, the proprietor, is a
wizened old-timer full of stories (most of them true)
about spectacular nuggets and six-foot rattlesnakes.
Beneath the glass countertops of his store, you can
see scores of vials full of nuggets taken right out of the
riverbed behind the shop. Dial can tell yoti where to
start panning; he can even sell you a "starter kit" con
taining a goldpan and some sample paydirt. But you'll
probably save a few dollars to buy softie cones in Mariposa
if you bring your own gear.
A well-equipped beginning goldpanner should have a
goldpan. (You can pick one up at Dial's shop, or at the
Cecil's Sporting Goods on 21st street, off of Yosemite
Parkway in Merced.) You'll also need a small spade or
garden trowel to scrape otit dirt from crevasses in the
dry riverbank, a pair ot tweezers to retrieve the gold
flakes from your pan, and a small
vial — fill it almost to the top with
water — to hold your little treasures.
Besides bringing the right stuff,
you've got to wear the right stuff:
long pants and protective shoes.
Rattlesnakes in the Sierra foothills
are waking up and sunning them
selves during the warming spring, and
if you step on one, you won't be a
happy camper. You might want to
take along a small snakebite kit; you
can purchase one at any outdoor
supply store.
To be a successful prospector, you
have to remember that gold is denser
than iron grains, sand and rock. Each
spring when the snow in the Sierras
thaws, the streams running down
into the Merced River carry with them
small particles of every sort.
Gold particles, because they are the
densest, will sink and lodge at the
earliest available opportunity. This
means you're likely to find gold in
the dried silt and dirt that has ac
cumulated at the upstream edges of
rocks along the bank and in the
riverbed.
Take your trowel and scrape some

dirt from the rock's edges into your
pan. Add some water from the river
and slowly swirl it around by tilting
the pan in your hands. After you've
picked out the pebbles and other large
pieces, watch the finer particles as
they swish around in the pan.
You have to get rid of nearly all
the extra dirt in the pan, so that you
have mostly iron particles (they look
like black sand). Since a gold flake
is heavy, it will tend to be the very
last of the particles to move when
you swish the pan, and will be the
first to stop moving. With a sharp
eye and good light, you can spot the
tiny yellow flecks at the upper edge
of the dirt in your pan. Using your
wet fingertip, a wet wooden
matchstick or your tweezers, pick up
the flakes and place them in your vial.
If you find a large nugget, Ralph
Dial would probably be glad to take
it off your hands for a fair price. If
you find nothing but tiny flakes —
or maybe nothing at all — don't
despair. lust pack up your gear, get
on the road, leave the foothills behind
you and head for the high country. . . .
