# The 						one that got away
## Learn the art of fishing in the Bay Area 
### Frank Quaratiello 
ON THE WAY HOME from a
family trip to New
Hampshire's White Moun
tains, we pulled off the road and
parked hv a slow-moving river for a
picnie. My father went back to the
trunk, got out the picnic basket, the
blanket and a fishing pole. No one
was hungry yet, so he decided to teach
my sister and I how to fish. 1 was
about 9 years old and my sister was
6, and neither of us was quite ready
for the challenge. But, after about an

hour of instruction and practice, wc
could both cast the line out into the
deeper part of the river.
If there were fish in that river, they
either weren't hungry or they had
seen this trick before, because what
we cast into water was all that we
were getting back out of it.
Finally, my sister and I decided
that we would each cast one more
time and then go eat. My sister leaned
back, cast the line and brought it in.
Nothing. Then, I brought the pole
back and flung the line out as far as
I could. I thought I felt a tug on the

line, so I started to reel it in. But
nothing pulled back and 1 figured a
fish had just knocked the bait oft the
hook. I reeled in the line and, as it
got closer, my father pointed out intc
the water. On the end of the line,
there was a tiny, red and silver fish.
I had never seen one quite like it
before. I reeled it in. My father ex
amined it and declared that it was ;i
baby trout.
We were surprised the ambitious
little fella had even been able to get
the hook in its mouth. My father
told us it was too small to keep. I

was a little bit crestfallen and my
sister wanted to take it home in a
cup. But finally we agreed and my
father unhooked it, dropped it back
in the water and we had our picnic.
Fishing is all about little moments
like that one. It is a means of survival
that societies have grown up around,
a psychological struggle, a primal way
to commune with nature.
For the eager Stanford outdoorsper
son, there are tremendous fishing op
portunities in the Bay Area. Like
many things, fishing is a complete
activity. It transcends the artificial
boundaries created by human minds
in an effort to better understand the
world and displays elements of both
art and science. When starting out,
it is better to learn what you can of
the science of fishing from area ex
perts.
Who else could we possibly ask
but Jim Jim, proprietor of the Jail
house Bait, Tackle, Grocery Store and
Deli.
Back in the middle of March when
I asked Jim about how the fishing
season was going, he said: "The lack
smelt are running like crazy." For
those of you who are not familiar
with fishing lingo, the fish aren't
really "running." When fish arc "run
ning," it means that how many fish
you can catch is only limited by the
amount of time it takes you to cast
your line and reel it back in.
For bait, Jim said "use pileworms,
of course."
If you've spent any time around
people who fish, you know two
things: They always have a story
about a big fish that they almost
caught one day and, no matter how
much you bug them, they will never
tell you their favorite places to fish
(A favorite fishing place has a kind
of spiritual value).
But Jim was more than happy to
list a couple of places on this side of
the Bay where the fish were hopping
(I'm sure there are a few great places
that he didn't tell me about, but that's
only fair because they are his places).
Fie listed Oyster Point, the lagoon
at Brisbane, the Third Street pier in
San Francisco and "a place called
Showboat" in Burlingame as the best
places to go on this side of the Bay
if you want to fish from a pier or
the beach.
Personally, Jim said he likes to take

his 28-foot boat out into the deep
water by the Golden Gate Bridge.
"I catch sturgeon as big as 100 lbs.,
striped bass as big as 50 lbs., sharks
and sting rays," he said.
Jim said he's been fishing around
here almost all his life. He started
as a kid and, when he grew up, he
bought his own bait and tackle shop.
He said by now, the sturgeon will
be back and the striped bass will be
running. But give him a call at 952-
4240 or stop by 1051 Airport Rd. in
South San Franeisco and ask him
where the best spots are.
One of the wonderful things about
fishing is that there are so many dif
ferent ways to fish: fresh water, salt
water, deep-sea, fly fishing, shore fish
ing, fishing from a boat.
If you're in the mood for a deep-sea
fishing party, you can eall Benji at
Monterey Sport Fishing.
For $21 per person on weekdays
or $25 on weekends, the sport shop
takes from 25-50 people out open
fishing for roek cod ott Cypress Point
in Carmcl Bay. From 15-25 can go
out for salmon now that the season
has opened, for $35 on weekdays or
$45 on weekends.
That may sound pretty steep, but
if you arrange a private party, you
ean take more people out and maybe
get a better deal. Besides, Benji said
"it's a great year for fishing.
"When we go out for rock cod,
everyone catches some," he ex
plained.
If you're interested, give Benji a
ring at (408) 372-2203 or drop by
the 96 Fishermen's Whart No. 1 in
Monterey.
Those expert sources will point you
in the direction of the most popular
fishing holes and they will even tell
you where you can get the gear you
need. But, after you get a little expe
rience behind you, you'll find your
own places and start to develop an
understanding of and appreciation tor
the art of fishing.
I can't help you too much in that
department right now, but if you ever
get over to New Hampshire and find
yourself near a chain of lakes named
the Pennichuck Lakes, cast a line and
you'll almost be able to see the
dreams that a handful of young kids
built in the clouds while they cut
classes and waited for the fish to
start biting. OTT

water by the Golden Gate Bridge.
"I catch sturgeon as big as 100 lbs.,
striped bass as big as 50 lbs., sharks
and sting rays," he said.
Jim said he's been fishing around
here almost all his life. He started
as a kid and, when he grew up, he
bought his own bait and tackle shop.
He said by now, the sturgeon will
be back and the striped bass will be
running. But give him a call at 952-
4240 or stop by 1051 Airport Rd. in
South San Franeisco and ask him
where the best spots are.
One of the wonderful things about
fishing is that there are so many dif
ferent ways to fish: fresh water, salt
water, deep-sea, fly fishing, shore fish
ing, fishing from a boat.
If you're in the mood for a deep-sea
fishing party, you can eall Benji at
Monterey Sport Fishing.
For $21 per person on weekdays
or $25 on weekends, the sport shop
takes from 25-50 people out open
fishing for roek cod ott Cypress Point
in Carmcl Bay. From 15-25 can go
out for salmon now that the season
has opened, for $35 on weekdays or
$45 on weekends.
That may sound pretty steep, but
if you arrange a private party, you
ean take more people out and maybe
get a better deal. Besides, Benji said
"it's a great year for fishing.
"When we go out for rock cod,
everyone catches some," he ex
plained.
If you're interested, give Benji a
ring at (408) 372-2203 or drop by
the 96 Fishermen's Whart No. 1 in
Monterey.
Those expert sources will point you
in the direction of the most popular
fishing holes and they will even tell
you where you can get the gear you
need. But, after you get a little expe
rience behind you, you'll find your
own places and start to develop an
understanding of and appreciation tor
the art of fishing.
I can't help you too much in that
department right now, but if you ever
get over to New Hampshire and find
yourself near a chain of lakes named
the Pennichuck Lakes, cast a line and
you'll almost be able to see the
dreams that a handful of young kids
built in the clouds while they cut
classes and waited for the fish to
start biting. OTT
ON THE WAY HOME from a
family trip to New
Hampshire's White Moun
tains, we pulled off the road and
parked hv a slow-moving river for a
picnie. My father went back to the
trunk, got out the picnic basket, the
blanket and a fishing pole. No one
was hungry yet, so he decided to teach
my sister and I how to fish. 1 was
about 9 years old and my sister was
6, and neither of us was quite ready
for the challenge. But, after about an

hour of instruction and practice, wc
could both cast the line out into the
deeper part of the river.
If there were fish in that river, they
either weren't hungry or they had
seen this trick before, because what
we cast into water was all that we
were getting back out of it.
Finally, my sister and I decided
that we would each cast one more
time and then go eat. My sister leaned
back, cast the line and brought it in.
Nothing. Then, I brought the pole
back and flung the line out as far as
I could. I thought I felt a tug on the

line, so I started to reel it in. But
nothing pulled back and 1 figured a
fish had just knocked the bait oft the
hook. I reeled in the line and, as it
got closer, my father pointed out intc
the water. On the end of the line,
there was a tiny, red and silver fish.
I had never seen one quite like it
before. I reeled it in. My father ex
amined it and declared that it was ;i
baby trout.
We were surprised the ambitious
little fella had even been able to get
the hook in its mouth. My father
told us it was too small to keep. I

was a little bit crestfallen and my
sister wanted to take it home in a
cup. But finally we agreed and my
father unhooked it, dropped it back
in the water and we had our picnic.
Fishing is all about little moments
like that one. It is a means of survival
that societies have grown up around,
a psychological struggle, a primal way
to commune with nature.
For the eager Stanford outdoorsper
son, there are tremendous fishing op
portunities in the Bay Area. Like
many things, fishing is a complete
activity. It transcends the artificial
boundaries created by human minds
in an effort to better understand the
world and displays elements of both
art and science. When starting out,
it is better to learn what you can of
the science of fishing from area ex
perts.
Who else could we possibly ask
but Jim Jim, proprietor of the Jail
house Bait, Tackle, Grocery Store and
Deli.
Back in the middle of March when
I asked Jim about how the fishing
season was going, he said: "The lack
smelt are running like crazy." For
those of you who are not familiar
with fishing lingo, the fish aren't
really "running." When fish arc "run
ning," it means that how many fish
you can catch is only limited by the
amount of time it takes you to cast
your line and reel it back in.
For bait, Jim said "use pileworms,
of course."
If you've spent any time around
people who fish, you know two
things: They always have a story
about a big fish that they almost
caught one day and, no matter how
much you bug them, they will never
tell you their favorite places to fish
(A favorite fishing place has a kind
of spiritual value).
But Jim was more than happy to
list a couple of places on this side of
the Bay where the fish were hopping
(I'm sure there are a few great places
that he didn't tell me about, but that's
only fair because they are his places).
Fie listed Oyster Point, the lagoon
at Brisbane, the Third Street pier in
San Francisco and "a place called
Showboat" in Burlingame as the best
places to go on this side of the Bay
if you want to fish from a pier or
the beach.
Personally, Jim said he likes to take
