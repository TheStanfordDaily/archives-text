HOW WOULD YOU LIKE to
spend your weekends on a
luxurious, 70-foot yacht, sail
ing across the waters of the San Fran
cisco Ray?
How would you like to he able to
go out every day on a sailboat and
do your homework?
Relieve it or not, you don't have
to be rich to experience these nautical
adventures. It you're a member of
the Stanford community, these op
portunities are right under your nose.
The Stanford Sailing Association,
a part of the Farm's overall sailing
program, offers the Stanford commu
nity the opportunity tor windsurfing
and recreational sailing in large
yachts and small boats.
"This is the most enjoyable means
ot going sailing on the bay with the
least expense," said Joe Petrucci, the
director of the sailing program.
For $60, anyone in the Stanford
community can join the sailing as
sociation. Currently, the association
has between 600 and 800 members,
about 90 percent of whom arc Stan
ford students.
It you're interested in sailing in
small boats, you can use the sailing
association's boats at its facility in
Redwood City. The association also
offers basic and intermediate
windsurfing in Felt Lake.
And if you want to go small boat
sailing or windsurfing every day in
spring quarter, you can, Petrucci said.
But if you feel that you really ought
to go to class, don't worry. The best
part of the sailing association's pro
gram is available on weekends. Mem
bers of the sailing association can go
on weekend sails on one of the as
sociation's large boats, which range
in size from 34 feet to 72 feet.
The boats are crewed by a group
of well-trained volunteers, and asso
ciation members can help out as
