# Run before the wind
## Take an afternoon sail on the San Francisco Bay 
### Geoff Goldman 
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE to
spend your weekends on a
luxurious, 70-foot yacht, sail
ing across the waters of the San Fran
cisco Ray?
How would you like to he able to
go out every day on a sailboat and
do your homework?
Relieve it or not, you don't have
to be rich to experience these nautical
adventures. It you're a member of
the Stanford community, these op
portunities are right under your nose.
The Stanford Sailing Association,
a part of the Farm's overall sailing
program, offers the Stanford commu
nity the opportunity tor windsurfing
and recreational sailing in large
yachts and small boats.
"This is the most enjoyable means
ot going sailing on the bay with the
least expense," said Joe Petrucci, the
director of the sailing program.
For $60, anyone in the Stanford
community can join the sailing as
sociation. Currently, the association
has between 600 and 800 members,
about 90 percent of whom arc Stan
ford students.
It you're interested in sailing in
small boats, you can use the sailing
association's boats at its facility in
Redwood City. The association also
offers basic and intermediate
windsurfing in Felt Lake.
And if you want to go small boat
sailing or windsurfing every day in
spring quarter, you can, Petrucci said.
But if you feel that you really ought
to go to class, don't worry. The best
part of the sailing association's pro
gram is available on weekends. Mem
bers of the sailing association can go
on weekend sails on one of the as
sociation's large boats, which range
in size from 34 feet to 72 feet.
The boats are crewed by a group
of well-trained volunteers, and asso
ciation members can help out as

much or as little as they like with
the sailing.
Typically, members have had some
sailing experience, hut none is nec
essary to go on one of the weekend
sails, Pctrucci said.
Members have the chance to assist
the crew in all aspects of the sailing
of the boat. If you want, you can
even take the helm and steer. Al
though no formal instructional pro
gram is offered on the big boats, you
have the chance to learn a lot from
participating in the sail, according to
Pctrucci.
Pctrucci said his idea of a "good
sail" is having the volunteer crew be
involved only in leaving the dock and
bringing the boat back in at the end
of the day. "People generally have a
great time helping sail the boat," he
said.
To go on a sail, a member only
has to call the sailing association a
week in advance and reserve a place.
On the day of the sail, you have to
show up at the dock at approximately
11 a.m. After about an hour of prep
aration, the boat will leave the dock
around noon.

ing association's pro
gram is available on
weekends. Members of
the sailing association
can go on weekend sails
on one of the associa
tion's large boats, which
range in size from 34
feet to 72 feet.

Pctrucci said sails currently last un
til about 4 p.m., but as the days get
longer, sailing time may be extended
until 6:30 or 7 p.m.
The sailing association's big boats
are scattered around the Bay Area,
from the San Francisco marina to
Brisbane to Alameda. Sailors need
not bring anything except themselves
and anything they want to eat or
drink on the excursion.
The boats generally stay within the
San Francisco Bay in what Pctrucci
calls prime sailing area, although they
sometimes do venture beyond the
Golden Gate Bridge. In particular, the
boats remain in the area bounded by
the Golden Gate, San Mateo and San
Rafael bridges. This area is one ot
the 10 nicest places in the world to
sail, according to Pctrucci.
The sailing association is also plan
ning several special sailing events tor
the coming months. In addition to
several weekend overnight excur
sions, the association will hold its
first annual Caribbean cruise m June.
