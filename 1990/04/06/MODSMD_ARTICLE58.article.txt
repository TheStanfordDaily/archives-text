Big Sur/Los Padres, and for such ac
tivities as white-water rafting and
skiing.
The guides cost $1 for students
and $3 for others and are available
at the Outdoor Programs office. The
guides give detailed information on
what to bring on trips, where to stay
and how much the trips will cost.

outdoor enthusiast can take weekend
trips with old friends or a new group
of people," according to Outdoor Pro
grams coordinator Nancy Noelke.

more preparation in the form of
a required two-hour pre-trip meeting
on May 8 — and a little more mon

to cover instruction and the use of
climbing equipment.
Since enrollment is limited, Tres
idder suggests people register for the
outing by April 18.

will be let loose on a flotilla ot ratts
on the American River in Northern
California. This outing will be an
all-day affair, leaving in car pools
from Stanford at 5 a.m. and returning
at 10:30 p.m.
To battle such river highlights as
Troublemaker, Triple Threat and
Satan's Cesspool, river rats should
bring an extra pair of dry clothes.
The mandatory pre-trip session will
take place on May 15 in Tresidder's
Aspen Room at 8 p.m. Although the
outing costs $60 or $65, proceeds go
to the Friends of the River foundation.
