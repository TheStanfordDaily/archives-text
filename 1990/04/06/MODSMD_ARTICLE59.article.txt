# Win, place or show
## Spend a little dough on the sport of kings

HE HAD LEGS that wouldn't quit. Or so 1 thought,
as I watchcd him pace back and forth on the
gravel, the sinews on his gams writhing like
snakes beneath his glossy chestnut hair.
One look, and I knew where I wanted to put my $2.
Such was my introduction to horse racing, the "Sport

of Kines." (I'm not quite sure why they call it that

I guess when "reins" are involved, the aristocracy
doesn't like to be left out.)
w And when winning money is involved, I don't

like to he left out. I bought a program from a greasy
man in a brown leather cap. He was chewing tobacco,
and after I gave him my buck, he squirted some brown
juice out of his mouth and onto the ground. "Nice," I
muttered, as he wiped the excess from his stubbly chin.
"I gotta tip for ya," he said, "Put it all on Fanny's
Fancy. 'Tsa sure thing."
He sucked and squirted again.
1 would have liked to show him a sure thing, but I
had a bet to place, so I trotted over to the window with
the shortest line. A couple of yuppies were standing in
front of me wearing matching suede jackets.
"You know your therapist warned you not to get too
analytical, Lora Dawn," the man reasoned. "1 overheard
a tip that Fanny's Fancy was supposed to be hot."
"I don't care about any fancy fannies, Geoff," Lora
Dawn retorted. "This is my inheritance, and I'll bet it
like I want to. On Purple Doozy."
lust then a trio of oily beauhunks joined the line. 1
overheard them talking about someone's fanny "How
insensitive and chauvinistic," I thought, as I made sure
my pants were on straight.
I heard Lora Dawn bet $200 on an Exacto on two and
three, Purple Doozy and Fancy Fanny. "The obscenely
wealthy," I mused. The likelihood that Purple Doozy

and Fancy Fanny would take first and second respectively
was slim at best.
"But it takes suckers like that to make the purse sweet
for the rest of us," 1 sneered.
My turn to bet came. "Two dollars on No. 5," I said
to the clerk. No. 5 — Straight Arrow — was the horse
I had spied pawing the gravel earlier in my adventure.
"Win, place or show:" he asked impatiently.
"Show." I'm always cautious when I'm playing big
dollars.
The elerk handed me my ticket. I strolled past the
oilv beauhunks and over to my seat in the stands. As
luck would have it, Lora Dawn and Geoff were right
behind me eating brie on diagonally sliced baguettes.
I bought a hot dog and a medium coke and waited
for the race to start Before I could even get the ketchup
spread on my dog, the horses and jerseyed jockeys were
called to the post.
Like a champ, Straight Arrow trotted to the starting
gate Through my binoculars, I saw him flare his nostrils.
The intensity of the gesture was art.
One by one, the horses were led into their gates, like
living torpedoes loaded into a submarine's tubes. The
indecisive masses that hadn't yet placed their bets con
tinued to line up at the windows.
