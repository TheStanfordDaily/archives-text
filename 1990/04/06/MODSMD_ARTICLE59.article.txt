# Win, place or show
## Spend a little dough on the sport of kings 
### Martha Brockenbrough 
HE HAD LEGS that wouldn't quit. Or so 1 thought,
as I watchcd him pace back and forth on the
gravel, the sinews on his gams writhing like
snakes beneath his glossy chestnut hair.
One look, and I knew where I wanted to put my $2.
Such was my introduction to horse racing, the "Sport

of Kines." (I'm not quite sure why they call it that

I guess when "reins" are involved, the aristocracy
doesn't like to be left out.)
w And when winning money is involved, I don't

like to he left out. I bought a program from a greasy
man in a brown leather cap. He was chewing tobacco,
and after I gave him my buck, he squirted some brown
juice out of his mouth and onto the ground. "Nice," I
muttered, as he wiped the excess from his stubbly chin.
"I gotta tip for ya," he said, "Put it all on Fanny's
Fancy. 'Tsa sure thing."
He sucked and squirted again.
1 would have liked to show him a sure thing, but I
had a bet to place, so I trotted over to the window with
the shortest line. A couple of yuppies were standing in
front of me wearing matching suede jackets.
"You know your therapist warned you not to get too
analytical, Lora Dawn," the man reasoned. "1 overheard
a tip that Fanny's Fancy was supposed to be hot."
"I don't care about any fancy fannies, Geoff," Lora
Dawn retorted. "This is my inheritance, and I'll bet it
like I want to. On Purple Doozy."
lust then a trio of oily beauhunks joined the line. 1
overheard them talking about someone's fanny "How
insensitive and chauvinistic," I thought, as I made sure
my pants were on straight.
I heard Lora Dawn bet $200 on an Exacto on two and
three, Purple Doozy and Fancy Fanny. "The obscenely
wealthy," I mused. The likelihood that Purple Doozy

and Fancy Fanny would take first and second respectively
was slim at best.
"But it takes suckers like that to make the purse sweet
for the rest of us," 1 sneered.
My turn to bet came. "Two dollars on No. 5," I said
to the clerk. No. 5 — Straight Arrow — was the horse
I had spied pawing the gravel earlier in my adventure.
"Win, place or show:" he asked impatiently.
"Show." I'm always cautious when I'm playing big
dollars.
The elerk handed me my ticket. I strolled past the
oilv beauhunks and over to my seat in the stands. As
luck would have it, Lora Dawn and Geoff were right
behind me eating brie on diagonally sliced baguettes.
I bought a hot dog and a medium coke and waited
for the race to start Before I could even get the ketchup
spread on my dog, the horses and jerseyed jockeys were
called to the post.
Like a champ, Straight Arrow trotted to the starting
gate Through my binoculars, I saw him flare his nostrils.
The intensity of the gesture was art.
One by one, the horses were led into their gates, like
living torpedoes loaded into a submarine's tubes. The
indecisive masses that hadn't yet placed their bets con
tinued to line up at the windows.

I was eating the hotdog slowly,
relishing my impending victory, when
a disturbing noise began behind me.
I took my eyes off my meal and
turned around.
The three oily beauhunks were sit
ting about two rows back. One of
them had a swizzle stick in his car,
and he was playing a military tight
song. I didn't like to think of the ear
wax build-up that he must have had
in order to produce such resonant
strains.
I stopped listening, however, when
the man next to the gate raised the
red flag. Swizzle stick music or no,
I had a race to watch. With a flourish,
the starter opened the gate, crying
out the famous words, "And they're
off."
Since this was a six-furlong race,
the starting gate was at the far right
hand corner of the track. My
binoculars weren't much help in
penetrating the thick cloud of dust
and straining legs. I depended on the
announcer's insight to inform me
with the play-by-play.
"Straight Arrow is in the lead on
the back stretch," he piped, "Fancy
Fanny and Smart Joe follow by a

length and a halt.
Having read on the program that
Straight Arrow was a strong starter,
I knew that he was right where he
needed to be in order for me to nab
the purse.
"Fancy Fanny is making his move
on Straight Arrow," the announcer
continued, "And it's Fancy Fanny in
the lead."
1 started to think of how I wanted
to spend my money.
"But wait, here comes Purple
Doozy. It's Purple Doozy making a
move on the inside."
I began wishing 1 had a swizzle
stick so 1 could play, "I'm in the
money."
A group "Oooh" spread over the
crowd, signaling that something that
was amiss.
"We've had a slip-up on the track,
ladies and gentlemen. One of our
horses is down," the announcer bel
lowed.
"And it looks like Straight Arrow
has veered from the path," he con
tinued, "That's right, No. 5
Straight Arrow — has taken a nasty
tumble. Look's like that's about it
for him today."

"My life is pain," I groaned. I took
a look through my binoculars.
Straight Arrow lay crumpled on the
track, the foam from his mouth
kneaded together with blood from his
noble nostrils. The jockey looked
dead.
"And it's Fancy Fanny by half a
length, followed by Purple Doozy,"
the announcer shouted, breaking my
semi-trance, "What a race we just
witnessed, ladies and gentlemen."
Lora Dawn began clubbing Geoff
over the head with the rest of the
baguette, bemoaning her substantial
loss. "Let's get you home for a
valium," he whimpered.
I felt a prick in my back. Reaching
back, I plucked a sticky swizzle stick
from my sweater. 1 turned around
and spied the oily beauhunks behind
me, swapping high fives.
I shuffled out of the grandstand
pondering the hard lessons I had just
learned "Life is unfair, and gambling
doesn't pay," I exclaimed, shaking
my fist at the winedark race track,
where workers struggled to drag
Straight Arrow's body out of the way.
Two bucks poorer, one race wiser,
I lined up to place my next bet. OTF
