# Kennedy gives OK to alcohol restrictions
## 
### Brooke Hart 
University President Donald Kennedy yesterday
approved a proposal to revise Stanford's alcohol
policy, but not before broadening it to prohibit drink
ing at all public events in athletic facilities, including
this year's Commencement.
A report prepared by Kennedy states that the
University cannot reasonably prevent drinking at a
sporting event and simultaneously allow it when an
equal number of people are gathered at a non
athletic event, such as a concert.
The following restrictions are now a part of Stan
ford's alcohol policy:
• Alcoholic beverages are not permitted at athletic
and public events inside the stadiums, pools, playing
fields and pavilions at Stanford.
• Alcoholic beverages may not be promoted or
advertised at events or in enterprises under the
control of the Department of Athletics.
• Persons who have been convicted of driving
while intoxicated on the Stanford campus are
ineligible to receive a permit to
park on campus for a year follow
ing their conviction.
The regulation restricting ad
vertising concerns publications as
well as scoreboards and fences.
However, alcohol can still be ad
vertised in programs produced by
the Pacific 10 Conference, such
as glossy football programs, and
during radio and television broad
casts of Stanford games.
Since a check with the state
Department of Motor Vehicles on
every person who applies for a
campus parking permit would be

difficult, the third regulation will
most likely apply only to people
convicted of drunk driving within
the Stanford Police jurisdiction.
The intent of this regulation "is
not to penalize" but "rather to
protect the welfare of our campus
publics," according to Kennedy's
report.
Originally four proposals were
drafted in January by Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons,
Athletic Director Andy Geiger and
Director of Public Safety Marv
Herrington. The proposals were
released for public comment and
subsequently altered, taking into
account the community's recom
mendations. Three of the original
four proposals were amended and
the fourth was dropped before

submission to Kennedy.
"The recommendations were
and are intended to protect the
public welfare, to discourage al
cohol abuse and to indicate the
institution's disapproval of exces
sive alcohol consumption," the
report states.
The fourth proposal, which was
rejected due to unfavorable com
munity response, would have pro
hibited the use of student fees
collected by the University for the
purchase of alcoholic beverages.
Kennedy and the recommending
group concluded, after careful
consideration of the arguments
for and against the proposal, that
a regulatory approach of this kind
would be inappropriate.
According to Kennedy's report,

energy would be better directed
toward encouraging student
groups to better control functions
at which alcohol is served and to
limit abuse more effectively.
Support among students was
moderate to strong for the first
three proposals. One student,
however, objected to the first pro
posal which will prohibit alcohol
at Commencement. "Graduating
seniors should be treated like the
responsible adults they are," said
senior Andrew Baw.
According to Lyons,the regula
tions are "not intended to alter
the basic alcohol policy for stu
dents." The University's general
policy stresses student responsi
bility with alcohol rather than im
posing stringent regulations.
