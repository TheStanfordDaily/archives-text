## Baseball's best are in our own back yard 
### Andrew Berkowitz 
AH ; BASEBALL is back with a
vengeance. We hope.
Once the players and owners
have finished their off-season raking
in of the green, they'll he ready to
take to the green to settle their dif
ferences over 162 games.
If you're a baseball fan, Stanford
is the place to be. Not many colleges
boast proximity to major league ball,
let alone proximity to the two best
clubs in the land. At the Oakland
Coliseum, the (American League)
Athletics display last year's World Sc
ries championship with the bravado

and swagger of Roman gladiators
muscles bulging, elbows bashing,
steroids rushing like Rickey Hender
son through their veins.
At Candlestick Park, by contrast,
the San Francisco Giants, 1989 Na
tional League Champions, display the
history of their past greatness — the
retired numbers of Willie Mays,
Willie McCovey and other heroes
hanging on the right-field fence —
and the promise of their future power
in the swings of Kevin Mitchell, Will
Clark and Matt Williams.
Oakland and San Francisco offer
the best of baseball right in our own
back yard. Which park to visit is

merely .1 question ot convenience,
personal taste and, 111 the case ot
Candlestick Park, percentage of pro
tective body fat.
Candlestick Park in South San
Francisco is the home, for the mo
ment, of the Giants. It's the
second-oldest stadium in the Na

tional League, and more than one
history-making play has been hobbled
on its grassy outfield. The 'Stick is
an intimate little colossus of concrete
and 60,000 plastic seats that sits
smack-dab on a rocky point overlook
ing the San Francisco Bay, right in
the path of whatever fierce winds hap
pen to be whipping about on the top
of the ocean.
Sometimes it gets a bit chilly there.
OK, maybe it's downright cold.
ALL RIGHT, THE TRUTH: They
named it Candlestick Park because
by the seventh inning you're going
to be so cold you'll light your jumbo
dog on fire and huddle around it for
warmth. Ahem.
On the bright side, it's not always
cold at Candlestick, although the
weather is downright impossible to
predict in advance. Clear skies and
sun, even during a day game, do not
mean the park will be warm. You
must take a warm jacket to Giants
games; the disclaimer they have on
the back of the tickets includes freez
ing to death.
The Oakland Coliseum, by con
trast, is far more congenial in terms
of at mospheric conditions. The down

side, of course, is that they play
American League baseball there, a
blight and perversion upon the sen
sibilities of any self-respecting base
ball fan in America. There are those
of us who believe that most of the
world's ills can be directly linked to
the adoption of the designated hitter
rule in 1973.
If you can stomach the DH, then
Oakland ain't a bad place to see a
game. The sight lines are good, the
team is excellent, the stadium is rea
sonably comfortable, and they have
grass (a small green plant, for you
city dwellers) instead of abominable
turf.
Not that the Coliseum doesn't
have it's non-DH downsides. For one
thing, the refreshments can be
downright silly (tofu). And dot
racing, an audience participation
spectacle that rivals Geraldo for
sheer stupidity, is a scoreboard
staple. Also, they do The Wave there,
something most self-respecting (but
otherwise disrespectful) Giants' fans
wouldn't be caught dead at.
But the 'Stick has its own weird
history of crowd-pleasing activities.
In the early '80s, for instance, when

the Giants were perennial 100-game
losers, the team had as their unof
ficial mascot the Crazy Crab, a guy
dressed up in a giant orange crab
suit. The fans hated it.
Every game, the Crazy Crab would
come out of the dressing room dur
ing the seventh inning stretch and
do a dance while the scoreboard
proclaimed "Love that Crazy Crab"
in giant block letters. The fans would
literally go nuts. They'd boo, they'd
throw stuff, they'd boo some more.
After finishing his dance, the Crab
would turn around, moon the audi
ence, and scurry back into the dress
ing room until the next game. The
Crazy Crab disappeared a couple of
years ago. The fans probably had
him shot.
The fans at both parks are an
interesting breed, and whichever
park you pick, it's important to
decide just where you are going to
sit. There are two schools of thought
on this issue. There are those — my
editor, for instance — who think
that the only place to sit are the
cheap bleacher seats, which offer a
terrible view of the game but often
a good view of fans so crude thev

of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.
Another school of thought — the
rational one — says you should sit
in decent seats, among civilized folk,
in a place where you can see the
action, a place where you aren't
likely to run into editors. Bleacher
tickets are only $2.50 at Candlestick,
$3.50 at the Coliseum, but c'mon;
you can get upper-reserved tickets
for only $7 at both venues (that's
about the same as a movie), and the
most expensive ticket is only $11 at
the Coliseum, $10 at the 'Stick.
It ain't easy to get base-line box
seats at either park, so try and buy
your tickets well in advance.
Even with odious BASS sur
charges, this is not going to bankrupt
you. There will still be some money
left in your pocket for food, drinks,
betting on dot racing, whatever. If
you do go for refreshments, hot dogs
are the old standby.
Scientists have discovered that the
brain secretes a chemical that makes
hot dogs taste like gourmet food
when you eat them at baseball
games, as opposed to the rest of the
time when they taste like the

chopped up pig and cattle organs
that they really are. (Watch, I'll get
a letter from the National Hot Dog
Council. Just you wait and see.)
Pretzels and fries are dry and salty
but passable at both parks.
Hamburgers and other "normal"
foods tend to be extraterrestrial at
ballparks, so be forewarned. On the
bright side, they do sell hot cocoa
at the 'Stick.
Ultimately, the choice of which
ballpark to visit may be based mainly
on your ability to get there. The
Coliseum, unfortunately, is darn
near impossible to get to without a
car. BART goes there, but it doesn't
go anywhere near here. To get to
the Coliseum by car take the Dum
barton or San Mateo Bridge to the
East Bay, and then take 880 north

until you see big signs that say
"Coliseum."
Candlestick, thankfully, is quite
accessible by public transportation.
SamTrans runs a special ballpark
express bus to Candlestick which
leaves from the Palo Alto Caltrain
station and returns soon after the
game. Schedules are available at the
Tresidder Information Window, or
by calling 367-1500 The bus costs
about three bucks.
To drive to Candlestick — and
this means dealing with the Parking
Lot of the Living Dead — take 101
north until the Candlestick exit, then
idle your engine for 45 minutes while
you jockey for a parking space.
Tickets for Giants and A's games
are available through BASS at the
Tresidder Ticket Office, by calling
the Giants (467-8000) or A's (638-
0500) box offices, or at the park.
After the amazing performances of
these two Bay Area ball clubs last
fall, as well as the angst caused by
this spring's management lockout,
tickets to see the boys of summer
should sell out for more than one
game this season.
Baseball fever . . . catch it! OTT
