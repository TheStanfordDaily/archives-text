## Explore the warm sands of Santa Cruz

IF THE PERSON WHO who combined peanut butter
and chocolate was brilliant, then the individual who
combined an amusement park with a beach environ
ment was a genius.
The Santa Cruz Boardwalk blends the natural mystique
of California beaches with the mechanical thrills ot .1
theme park, resulting in an atmosphere which you can t
help but enjoy.
One ot the biggest faults of most large amusement
parks is the constant level of excitement; its often difficult
to find refuge amid all the rides, shows and activities
Along the Boardwalk, however, the shoreline offers .1
respite tor tired thrill-seekers, a chance to relax 111 .111
environment of natural tranquility. Amazingly, the
aromas of junk food, the roars of roller coasters and the
screams ot happy children are only steps away from the
serene lapping ot the waves on the beach and the warmth
of the California sun.

The open-air Boardwalk thrives from its accessibility
and can be reached from either the beach or city side.
There is no admission fee, but each ride requires up to
five tickets, which can be purchased at sporadically placed
booths. Tickets are 40 cents each, but can be purchased
in blocks at $10.95 tor 30 and $17.75 for 50. Leisurely
strolling visitors can purchase an all-day pass for $14.50.
The Boardwalk's centerpiece is the Giant Dipper, an
all-wood rollcrcoaster featured as the Coney Island
Cyclone in motion pictures. After plunging into twists
and turns in underground darkness, the initial rise of
the white monolith highlights the beauty of the beach
with a breathtaking view. Though the Hipper is only a
moderately sized rollcrcoaster, the ride's plunges and
compact structure offer thrills which rival those at bigger
parks.
Other rides on the Boardwalk span the entire gamut
of typical amusement park rides. Logger's Revenge, the
park's water-flume ride, makes up tor its primitive ap
pearance with an impressive ending plunge. The Jet Star,

the Boardwalk's other rollercoastcr, is a slower, illumi
nated version of Disneyland's Space Mountain; the ride's
incessant right turns are less than breathtaking. But the
Pirate, a giant pendulum ride like Magic Mountain's
Buccaneer, reaches some impressive heights and speeds
at its peak.
Many of the rides in the park are targeted for a much
younger crowd, such as a drive-your-own-car-typc attrac
tion. Sueh reminders of juvenalia should not deter indi
viduals from trying the indoor carousel, hidden beneath
one of the awnings of the upper level.
The only unredecming ride at the Boardwalk is the
Haunted Castle, which is both uninspiring and appalling.
The dark, gloomy ride's papier-mache figures arc unre
alistic and benign, and what can be made of the barely
moving exhibits are merely disgusting scenes. Not only
is the ride not scary, but it fails to capitalize on the
Boardwalk's strength: the outdoor atmosphere.
Surprisingly, the only area of the Santa Cruz Beach
Boardwalk which suffered damage in the October earth
quake was the indoor miniature golf course. The area
remains closed for reconstruction, and the new attraction,
Neptune's Kingdom, is scheduled to be completed in
October.
Still, the true beauty of the Boardwalk is its relaxed,
mellow pace. Many of the rides utilize the park's idyllic
position for enjoyments. The Sky Glider offers a chairlift
stylc panoramic view of the coastline in both directions
â€” the hanging sky-cars span the entire length of the
Boardwalk and present a magnificent view of the
coastline.
Though the seats ot the Ferris Wheel looming at the
end of the Boardwalk face inland, a glance over your
shoulder will reveal yet another picturesque view ot the
sea. All of the rides at the Boardwalk can be tried without
rushing from attraction to attraction, preserving that
laid-back California charm.
The beach provides a perfect spot for eating a Boardwalk
lunch. The Beach Grille offers traditional amusement
park greasy fare, including hamburgers, hotdogs, and
french fries. Those opting for a sit-down meal may dine
at the Cocoanut (sic) Grove restaurant.
But by all means, don't confine the beach to a simple
lunch-time experience. The serenity of the shoreline is
perfect for winding down after a day of rides. As you
recline on the warm sand, the loud noise of the Boardwalk
seems to fade away behind you. And while watching the
sunset over the glistening horizon, you can't help but
wonder why every amusement park doesn't have a beach
in it.
