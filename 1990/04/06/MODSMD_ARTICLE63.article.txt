IF THE PERSON WHO who combined peanut butter
and chocolate was brilliant, then the individual who
combined an amusement park with a beach environ
ment was a genius.
The Santa Cruz Boardwalk blends the natural mystique
of California beaches with the mechanical thrills ot .1
theme park, resulting in an atmosphere which you can t
help but enjoy.
One ot the biggest faults of most large amusement
parks is the constant level of excitement; its often difficult
to find refuge amid all the rides, shows and activities
Along the Boardwalk, however, the shoreline offers .1
respite tor tired thrill-seekers, a chance to relax 111 .111
environment of natural tranquility. Amazingly, the
aromas of junk food, the roars of roller coasters and the
screams ot happy children are only steps away from the
serene lapping ot the waves on the beach and the warmth
of the California sun.

The open-air Boardwalk thrives from its accessibility
and can be reached from either the beach or city side.
There is no admission fee, but each ride requires up to
five tickets, which can be purchased at sporadically placed
booths. Tickets are 40 cents each, but can be purchased
in blocks at $10.95 tor 30 and $17.75 for 50. Leisurely
strolling visitors can purchase an all-day pass for $14.50.
The Boardwalk's centerpiece is the Giant Dipper, an
all-wood rollcrcoaster featured as the Coney Island
Cyclone in motion pictures. After plunging into twists
and turns in underground darkness, the initial rise of
the white monolith highlights the beauty of the beach
with a breathtaking view. Though the Hipper is only a
moderately sized rollcrcoaster, the ride's plunges and
compact structure offer thrills which rival those at bigger
parks.
Other rides on the Boardwalk span the entire gamut
of typical amusement park rides. Logger's Revenge, the
park's water-flume ride, makes up tor its primitive ap
pearance with an impressive ending plunge. The Jet Star,
