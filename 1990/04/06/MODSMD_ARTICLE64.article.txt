# Next best thing to Oz
## Disneyland offers fun for the child in you 
### Lora Dawn Headrick 
Once upon a time, a knight in
black plate armor, astride a spledind
white horse, cantered up to the
drawbridge, leveled his lance and
shouted his challenge: "Open the
Disneyland Castle in the name of
the children of the world."
When Sleeping Beauty's castle
opened its gates on July 17, 1955,
the noble knight was surrounded bv

a sea of ecstatic children streaming
past him into the Magic Kingdom.
Judy Brown and Handy Schneider,
two 8-year-old kids from Anaheim,
Calif., raced towards the first ride
they saw.
Randy and Judy clambered up into
a giant Teacup — when the ride
started, they went spinning madlv
in concentric circles across the whirl
ing ground. Their bright faces, alive
with laughter, appeared later that

week on the cover of Life Magazine.
Then Randy and Judy grew up,
got married, had a family and lived
happily ever after.
It's the perfect Disneyland saga,
with a happy ending almost too
sappy to be true — but it is. The
Schneiders have been family friends
since my dad and Randy started
teaching high school together in
1970. Judy still has the Life maga
zine cover. And the first time 1 went

to Disneyland, the Schneiders came
along with us.
I'll never forget that visit — for
a 2-year-old child, it was like walking
into Oz. Some of it was awful —
like the clutch of fear I felt as we
sailed past the uvula of the same
menacing whale that swallowed
Pinocchio, or the self-protective in
stincts that kicked in during our
stay in the Haunted Mansion, when
I said to my mom, "I'm getting out
now."
But most of it was wonderful —
like the boisterous, rollicking Pirates
of the Caribbean singing their drink
ing songs as the town burns down
around them, or the gentle elephants
bathing in the waterfall of the
Jungle Cruise, or the chattering
birds of the Tikki Room.
Disneyland is full of dream figures
come to life — it's (he original 'Toon
Town. When Donald Duck waddles
up to shake your hand, you might
feel silly at first — a sophisticated
Stanford student like you, looking
forward to a bright and interesting
future as a computer scientist,
shaking the gloved wing of a giant
duck. But after a few minutes in

Walt Disney's Wonderland, you begin
to shake off your staid maturity and
renew your acquaintance with the
child inside of you.
Of course, some people just aren't
able to willingly suspend their dis
belief long enough to enjoy a world
created for the sake of children. But
if you're lucky enough to be able to
lose yourself in imaginative fantasy,
then Disneyland is the place for you.
Billed as "the happiest place on
earth," the theme park is situated
about 27 miles southeast of Los An
geles in Anaheim, Calif.
The park is open every day of the
year; during April and May, park
hours are usually 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
on weekdays, and 8 a.m. to midnight
on weekends. For more specific in
formation about park hours and
events, contact Disneyland guest re
lations at (714) 999-4573. Adult ad
mission to the park is rather pricey
— $25.50 — but, hey, do it for the
kid in you.
Everything in the amusement
park is created with that child in
mind. All the employees — dubbed
"Disneylanders" — are "on stage"
in the park. Like professional actors,

they cannot break character, but
must always contribute to the care
free, fantastical atmosphere of the
park.
Disneyland contains within it
seven smaller "lands" — self
consistent worlds built around spe
cific themes. Fantasyland, with its
storybook castle, stands as the
original centerpiece of the park.
There you can follow Alice down the
rabbit hole, or fly with Peter Pan
through the night skies above Lon
don.
Tomorrowland, just around the
Matterhorn from Fantasyland, of
fers you a taste of the future. In
addition to the old rocket ride —
one of my favorites, because I can
remember flying with my dad
through the summer twilight sky —
Tomorrowland boasts Space Moun
tain, a large indoor roller coaster,
and Star Tours.
Star Tours, developed and built
with the collaboration of George
Lucas, is an incredible journey into
the world of "Star Wars". C-3PO
and R2-D2 will entertain you with
their lively banter as the line moves
slowly past the interspace travel ads
and the android factory. Slowly.
But the ride is worth the wait.
Star Tours is an amazing flight
simulator that takes you on an in
tergalactic steeple chase using flight
footage from the "Star Wars" films.
If you think it sounds like a tame
attraction, you're in for a surprise.
In fact, the signs posted at intervals
along the line suggest that pregnant
women and people with heart con
ditions should not ride. You may not
really be flying, but your body sure
thinks you are.
After the dazzling excitement of
Tomorrowland, you'll probably want
to retreat into a quieter setting.
Frontierland is just the place for
you. Climb aboard the Mark Twain,
a steam-powered paddle boat that
runs along Disneyland's own version
of the Mississippi River. Or, if you're
feeling intrepid, brave the rickety
rails of Big Thunder Railroad, a
roller-coaster ride in a runaway mine
train.
But even the most fearless adven
turer must pause before the ominous
sight of Splash Mountain, "Dis
neyland's steepest, highest, scariest,
wildest, wettest, newest adventure."

Disneyland is full of
dream figures come to
life — it's the original
'Toon Town. When
Donald Duck waddles
up to shake your hand,
you might feel silly at
first — a sophisticated
Stanford student like
you, looking forward to
a bright and interesting
future as a computer
scientist, shaking the
gloved wing of a giant
duck.

Even the hyperbole of publicity pam
phlets cannot prepare you for the
heart-in-the-throat terror of your
FIVE-STORY DROP from the top
of Splash Mountain into the dark
ness of the Briar Patch.
This new attraction draws im
aginatively from the folk characters
of the Uncle Remus tales as they
were portrayed in Disney's 1946 clas
sic film "Song of the South." Ac
cording to a Disneyland press
release, the ride boasts a supporting
cast of more than 100 "performers"
— the electronic animated figures
that create the magic in the Magic
Kingdom.
The rich harmonies of "Song of
the South" will linger in your ears
long after you drip your way out of
Critter Country. Hut you can get a
fresh dose of great music in New
Orleans Square, where jazz bands
swing at Carnation Plaza.
However you end up spending your
time, you'll never be able to explore
all the delightful niches of Dis
neyland in a single day. You'll have
to go back — and this time, take
me with you! OTT
