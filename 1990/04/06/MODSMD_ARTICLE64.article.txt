## Disneyland offers fun for the child in you

Once upon a time, a knight in
black plate armor, astride a spledind
white horse, cantered up to the
drawbridge, leveled his lance and
shouted his challenge: "Open the
Disneyland Castle in the name of
the children of the world."
When Sleeping Beauty's castle
opened its gates on July 17, 1955,
the noble knight was surrounded bv

a sea of ecstatic children streaming
past him into the Magic Kingdom.
Judy Brown and Handy Schneider,
two 8-year-old kids from Anaheim,
Calif., raced towards the first ride
they saw.
Randy and Judy clambered up into
a giant Teacup — when the ride
started, they went spinning madlv
in concentric circles across the whirl
ing ground. Their bright faces, alive
with laughter, appeared later that

week on the cover of Life Magazine.
Then Randy and Judy grew up,
got married, had a family and lived
happily ever after.
It's the perfect Disneyland saga,
with a happy ending almost too
sappy to be true — but it is. The
Schneiders have been family friends
since my dad and Randy started
teaching high school together in
1970. Judy still has the Life maga
zine cover. And the first time 1 went
