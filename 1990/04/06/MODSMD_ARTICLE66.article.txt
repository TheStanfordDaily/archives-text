# Experience good food
## You can satisfy almost any craving here

Ah, cat, drink and be merry . . .
We've heard it so many times
before. But it's only after the novelty
of dorm dining and Tresidder fare
wears off that we decide to "ex
perience" good food — and in abun
dance!
Fortunately, food lovers, the Stan
ford area offers a multitude of dining
opportunities that range from the
cheap and casual to the upbeat and
pnccy. With health food, California
fare, and "ethnic" cuisine to choose
from, it's easy to find just about what
ever you may be craving — even if
it's pizza topped with coconut and
raisins. (Hint: Try the Applewood In
n's sweet but tasty white pizza.)
Pizza pie
Speaking of pizza, which only New
Yorkers seem to know as "pies,"
there are several good spots for in
dulging. Topping everyone's list as
the absolute favorite — but the far
thest from campus — is Frankie,
Johnnie & Luigi Too (939 El Camino
Real, Mountain View). The pizza
crust is divine and the toppings are
all quite good. Expect a wait to be
seated. A little closer to home is
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto), which boasts "New York style"
pizza. Although the pizza is generally
good, it is nothing like real New York
pizza, which is actually paper thin
and would not come near pineapple
and Canadian bacon for all the pasta
in Italy.
By contrast, Ramona's pizza is
fairly thick-crusted (try the whole
wheat crust!) with spicy sauce and
generous toppings. Fresh spinach
adds a unique and delicious twist.
Expect to run into lots of fellow Stan
ford students while you wait for your
dinner.
Finally, don't overlook the Ap
plewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Menlo Park) with its gourmet pizza
toppings. The outside of the Ap
plewood Inn doesn't look inviting

Don't be deceived. The artichokes on
a veggie combo pizza make this place
special.
Sandwiches and such
The best place around for sand
wiches and other deli items is the
Stanford Delicatessen (83 Stanford
Shopping Center). The huge assort
ment of salads behind the counter
pasta with shrimp is one of my
favorites — will give you something
to munch on while you wait for your
sandwich. Big sandwiches, with just
about anything you want — from
turkey on whole wheat to a real
pastrami on rye — arc the norm.

Although Chinatown
in San Francisco
can't be beat, the
Palo Alto area boasts
many of its own fine
Chinese restaurants.

A real Stanford tradition is getting
Togo's (528 University Ave.) sand
wiches for tailgaters, dorm meetings
or just a quick meal. These
hcroes/subs/grinders comc in a vari
ety of sizes to easily feed the hungry
crowds. The vegetarian combo is not
bad, although turkey is wonderful as
well.
Burgers and fries
When you're in the mood for a
hamburger but just can't stomach
the thought of McDonald's, try Pud
ley's (255 University Ave.) or the Al
pine Beer Garden (3915 Alpine Road,
Portola Valley), more commonly
known as Zott's. Zott's has great
frcnch fries and serves rectangular
hamburgers to its loyal customers.
The beer flows and the jukebox plays
0n...

Health conscious
If you're a healthy eater (and who
isn't these days?), two local spots
will be of interest to you. first
there's Crouton's (379 University
Ave.). Croutons is a salad bar — a
large salad bar, with just about every
thing you could want on a salad.
They also have soups (not as good
as the salad stuff) and fresh fruit
(always good), not to mention
amazing bran muffins, scones, rye
bread and sourdough . . . all for one
price, help-yourself-style. There's also
a frozen yogurt stand in the front of
the restaurant.
Another good choice is The Good
Earth (185 University Ave.), which
even has its own bakery selection at
the counter. Good soups, hearty sand
wiches and tasty yogurt shakes make
this spot a winner. The placc gets
quite crowded at dinner, where you'll
often find a slightly older crowd than
at Crouton's.
Wake-me-ups
The absolute best breakfast place
around is Hobee's (Town and Coun
try Village or 4244 El Camino) with
its amazing blueberry' coffee-cake and
cinnamon tea — both are truly ad
dictive. Hobee's has great omelettes
and egg scrambles, as well as pan
cakes and homemade granola. Don't
miss out on their energy blends either
— yogurt shakes with fresh straw
berries, bananas or blueberries.
Another old favorite is Late for the
Train (ISO Middleficld, Menlo Park),
where pancakes are big and fluffy and
the maple syrup is the real thing'
Scones are a specialty, French toast
is divine, and the blintzes are deli
cious. Expect to wait for seating, es
pecially on the weekends.
For a quick bite, head to Suzanne's
Muffins (376 University) where you
can't miss with the bran bran bran,
the oatmeal chocolate chip, the
blueberry, the apple cinnamon, the
corn . . . get the picture?
And, it bagels are your thing, then
