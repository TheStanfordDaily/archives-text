# Experience good food
## You can satisfy almost any craving here 
### Mia Manzulli 
Ah, cat, drink and be merry . . .
We've heard it so many times
before. But it's only after the novelty
of dorm dining and Tresidder fare
wears off that we decide to "ex
perience" good food — and in abun
dance!
Fortunately, food lovers, the Stan
ford area offers a multitude of dining
opportunities that range from the
cheap and casual to the upbeat and
pnccy. With health food, California
fare, and "ethnic" cuisine to choose
from, it's easy to find just about what
ever you may be craving — even if
it's pizza topped with coconut and
raisins. (Hint: Try the Applewood In
n's sweet but tasty white pizza.)
Pizza pie
Speaking of pizza, which only New
Yorkers seem to know as "pies,"
there are several good spots for in
dulging. Topping everyone's list as
the absolute favorite — but the far
thest from campus — is Frankie,
Johnnie & Luigi Too (939 El Camino
Real, Mountain View). The pizza
crust is divine and the toppings are
all quite good. Expect a wait to be
seated. A little closer to home is
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto), which boasts "New York style"
pizza. Although the pizza is generally
good, it is nothing like real New York
pizza, which is actually paper thin
and would not come near pineapple
and Canadian bacon for all the pasta
in Italy.
By contrast, Ramona's pizza is
fairly thick-crusted (try the whole
wheat crust!) with spicy sauce and
generous toppings. Fresh spinach
adds a unique and delicious twist.
Expect to run into lots of fellow Stan
ford students while you wait for your
dinner.
Finally, don't overlook the Ap
plewood Inn (1001 El Camino,
Menlo Park) with its gourmet pizza
toppings. The outside of the Ap
plewood Inn doesn't look inviting

Don't be deceived. The artichokes on
a veggie combo pizza make this place
special.
Sandwiches and such
The best place around for sand
wiches and other deli items is the
Stanford Delicatessen (83 Stanford
Shopping Center). The huge assort
ment of salads behind the counter
pasta with shrimp is one of my
favorites — will give you something
to munch on while you wait for your
sandwich. Big sandwiches, with just
about anything you want — from
turkey on whole wheat to a real
pastrami on rye — arc the norm.

Although Chinatown
in San Francisco
can't be beat, the
Palo Alto area boasts
many of its own fine
Chinese restaurants.

A real Stanford tradition is getting
Togo's (528 University Ave.) sand
wiches for tailgaters, dorm meetings
or just a quick meal. These
hcroes/subs/grinders comc in a vari
ety of sizes to easily feed the hungry
crowds. The vegetarian combo is not
bad, although turkey is wonderful as
well.
Burgers and fries
When you're in the mood for a
hamburger but just can't stomach
the thought of McDonald's, try Pud
ley's (255 University Ave.) or the Al
pine Beer Garden (3915 Alpine Road,
Portola Valley), more commonly
known as Zott's. Zott's has great
frcnch fries and serves rectangular
hamburgers to its loyal customers.
The beer flows and the jukebox plays
0n...

Health conscious
If you're a healthy eater (and who
isn't these days?), two local spots
will be of interest to you. first
there's Crouton's (379 University
Ave.). Croutons is a salad bar — a
large salad bar, with just about every
thing you could want on a salad.
They also have soups (not as good
as the salad stuff) and fresh fruit
(always good), not to mention
amazing bran muffins, scones, rye
bread and sourdough . . . all for one
price, help-yourself-style. There's also
a frozen yogurt stand in the front of
the restaurant.
Another good choice is The Good
Earth (185 University Ave.), which
even has its own bakery selection at
the counter. Good soups, hearty sand
wiches and tasty yogurt shakes make
this spot a winner. The placc gets
quite crowded at dinner, where you'll
often find a slightly older crowd than
at Crouton's.
Wake-me-ups
The absolute best breakfast place
around is Hobee's (Town and Coun
try Village or 4244 El Camino) with
its amazing blueberry' coffee-cake and
cinnamon tea — both are truly ad
dictive. Hobee's has great omelettes
and egg scrambles, as well as pan
cakes and homemade granola. Don't
miss out on their energy blends either
— yogurt shakes with fresh straw
berries, bananas or blueberries.
Another old favorite is Late for the
Train (ISO Middleficld, Menlo Park),
where pancakes are big and fluffy and
the maple syrup is the real thing'
Scones are a specialty, French toast
is divine, and the blintzes are deli
cious. Expect to wait for seating, es
pecially on the weekends.
For a quick bite, head to Suzanne's
Muffins (376 University) where you
can't miss with the bran bran bran,
the oatmeal chocolate chip, the
blueberry, the apple cinnamon, the
corn . . . get the picture?
And, it bagels are your thing, then
The Bagel Works (129 Lytton) is the
place to be. It's not an eatery like
the other places, but a great place to
run in and grab some (frcsh-from
the-oven-and-still-warm) chewy
bagels.
Sushi anyone?
If hot-tubbing and sushi sound
like a great combination, then head
to Watercourse Way (165 Channing,
Palo Alto), where both arc a specialty.
Reservations may be needed for the
hot-tub rooms next door . . .
One of the best sushi spots is
Miyake (261 University) where the
food is good and not too expensive.
On the pricey side is Fuki-Sushi (4119
El Camino) with a full sushi bar and
Tata mi rooms.
For a little action with your sushi,
try Shogun (4390 El Camino, Los
Altos), where skilled Japanese knife
artists prepare food for you at your
table.
Chinese proverbs
Although Chinatown in San Fran
cisco can't be beat, the Palo Alto
area boasts many of its own fine

Chinese restaurants. One favorite is
the often-overlooked China Delight
(3691 El Camino) which serves
amazing hunan chicken and a great
dish of mu-shu chicken, shrimp, pork
or eggs. It's never crowded, has good
service and tons of food — for what
more could you ask:
If China Delight is overlooked, it's
probably because everyone is flocking
to the Jing Jing (443 Emerson, Palo
Alto). Within easy biking distance
from Stanford, the ling ling serves
mouth-watering (literally) spicy-hot
southern Chinese cuisine. Try the hot
and sour soup and the Kung Pao
chicken tor a super taste sensation!
Also a stone's throw from campus
is King Chuan (75 Town and Coun
try Village), which offers many dishes
for the vegetarian palate, as well as
Szcchuan and Peking specialties.
If cheap is what you're looking for,
then Chung King Royal (2209 El
Camino) is the place. Don't worry,
the food is good and plentiful. And
you can even ride your bike there.
But don't expect lavish surroundings.
An old Stanford favorite is Chef

Chu's (1067 N. San Antonio Rd., at
El Camino Real, Los Altos). It's al
ways crowded and a good place for
big groups who have different tastes.
The food is good, if unexciting.
French finds
For excellent crepes and pretty
outdoor dining, try Le Meursault
(6SI Emerson St.), "Palo Alto's wine
restaurant." A great wine selection
complements the delicate crepes and
desserts for a wonderful meal. Also
serving fine French food (and at rea
sonable prices) is Le Pot Au Feu
(1149 El Camino, Menlo Park) with
its country-kitchen atmosphere and
simple, well-prepared dishes.
French dining can be an elegant
affair in the Stanford area as well.
The more formal (and expensive)
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino) is a
definite local institution. With dance
music and a country inn atmosphere,
Chez Louis provides a lovely dining
experience. Another more expensive
treat is Chantilly ,530 Ramona) —
when you feel like going out in style.
Mange Bene!
Palo Alto has cornered the market
on good local Italian eateries. The
big three — Osteria, La Pastaia and
Cenzo's offer great Italian dinners in
a variety of atmospheres, all in the
medium price range. Osteria (247
Hamilton Ave.) is crowded, busy and
lively (reservations a must!), with
great fresh pasta, especially the gnoc
chi. Cenzo's (233 University Ave.) is
more casual and cafc-like, with great
bread and good seafood-and-pasta
combinations. La Pastaia (420 Emer
son Ave.) is the most elegant of the
three, and the chef there pays closc
attention to food presentation. You
ccrtainly can't go wrong with any of
them.
One more place you might like to
try is La Galleria (73 Town and
Country Village) which offers fine
Northern Italian cuisine, with a touch
of Swiss influence, in a casual but
pretty atmosphere.
South of the Border
Local Mexican restaurants are
known more for their festive atmos
phere than for excellent food, but

you can find good, hearty meals for
a reasonable price at many of these
popular spots. Judging from the
number of Stanford students who
frequent Compadres (3877 El
Camino), you know that retaurant is
doing something right. That some
thing is probably the tasty margaritas
. . . good salsa too! Along the same
lines is El Torito (4470 El Camino),
a popular place for Senior Pub Nights.
A lively newcomer to the Mexican
cuisinc scene is the El Dorado Cafe
(420 Ramona) where nouveau
Mexican food, tequila shots and a
boisterous crowd make for a fun eve
ning. Best if you're with a large group.
Chili's (700 El Camino, Mcnlo
Park) is another spot where you'll
find many fellow students — proba
bly waiting in line for a table with
you! It's casual, with great margaritas
and soft tacos.
If a lack of atmosphere doesn't
bother you, try Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Avenue, Redwood City).
It's a hole in the wall, but the au
thentic Mexican cuisine makes up
for it. It's fun with a group, and
Rosita's has a great selection of

Mexican beers. It you don't mind sit
ting on benches watching cars go by,
Senor Taco (3490 El Camino) is fast,
good and cheap — with a wide se
lection. The pink taco stand with
cactus in front serves great carne
asada's for under $3.
Finally, there's Macheesmo Mouse
(271 University Ave.), an airy counter
service restaurant which tends to get
quite noisy inside. Crayons and paper
keep you busy while you want your
food, which will be good, but nothing
special. Try the decently rich turtle
pie for dessert — it will make up for
your ordinary meal!
Ail-American Atmosphere
A Stanford favorite for pre-formal
dinners and other special occasions
is the upscale and trendy Mac Arthur
Park (27 University Ave.). Barbecued
ribs are the specialty, but the grilled
chicken and fish of the day are
favorites as well. Expect a yuppie
crowd, still dressed from work, and
a lively atmosphere with "healthy fast
food." A contradiction in terms? Find
out for yourself!
Another busy and yuppie-like spot
is the new Max's Opera Cafe (711
Stanford Shopping Center). The food
is quite good and comes in huge por
tions — the desserts are amazing, so
save room! The waiters and
waitresses sing Broadway show
stoppers, providing non-stop and en
joyable entertainment.
The California Cafe (Stanford
Barn) is another lively spot with great
grilled chicken and fish, and a variety
of pasta and salads. It's sleek and
chic and smells wonderful. It is fre
quented by a slightly dressier crowd
than Max's.
By far, the most elegant American
restaurant is The Gatehouse (256
Lytton), another great spot for special
occasions. The outdoor dining and
chic bar make it an attractive, if more
expensive, restaurant.
Something smells fishy
As close as Stanford is to the
Pacific Ocean, you should expect
some great seafood restaurants —
and you won't be disappointed. The
most accessible, reasonable and
casual is The Fish Market (3150 El
Camino Real) which offers super

Local Mexican res
taurants are known
more for their festive
atmosphere than for
excellent food, but
you can find good,
hearty meals for a
reasonable price at
many of these
popular spots.

fresh fish from an ever-changing daily
menu. Great red snapper and grilled
swordfish!
Scott's Seafood Grill and Bar
(2300 E. Bayshore Rd.) is more for
mal. Also on the dressy (and more
expensive) side is Theo's (546 Uni
versity Ave.), which has fresh fish as
well as pasta and chicken. Also down

town is the interesting Pearl's Oyster
Bar (535 Ramona Ave.) with its
grotto-like entry way.
The Grand Finale
Palo Alto is just dripping with ice
cream stores, each one more tan
talizing than the next. There are the
standard Baskin Robbins and Swen
sen's (University Ave.), but they must
compete with the gourmet-type
chains Haagen-Dazs (Stanford Barn)
and Rainbow (Ramona St.). In addi
tion, there is Blatz (101 California
Ave.), the king of folded icc cream
(choose your own mix-ins). Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream (Charleston
at Middlefield) and the Peninsula
Creamery (corner of Hamilton and
Emerson) round out the group. For
milkshakes made with Bud's ice
cream, visit the Creamery (209 Uni
versity Ave.).
If gelato is more your style, try
Gelato Classico (437 Emerson),
where you can enjoy such flavors as
white chocolate pistachio, dark choc
olate, and banana walnut. There's
also Perche Non (Liddicoats, Univer
sity Ave.) OTF
