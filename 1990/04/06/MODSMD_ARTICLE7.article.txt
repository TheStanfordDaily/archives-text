In a Feb. 21 article, The Daily
implied that Webb Ranch sys
tematically paid its workers
below the federal minimum
wage between 1981 and 1985
for work at the University.
The Daily's allegation was
overbroad.
The U.S. Department of
Labor has ordered the ranch to
pay back wages to nine workers
for minimum wage violations.
In general, however, hand
written paysheets from 1981 to
1985 do not indicate that
workers were paid below the
federal miminum wage, as
stated in the article.
Webb Ranch management
says that workers have always
been paid at least the minimum
wage.

In a Feb. 20 article, members
of the United Stanford Workers
alleged that Ranch management
was illegally withholding from
the federal government social
security deductions taken from
workers who lack social security
numbers.
There is no evidence to sub
stantiate the union's claim.
