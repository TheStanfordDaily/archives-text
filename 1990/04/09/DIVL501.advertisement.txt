Memory course helps
students boost grades
By Anthony Rao
University of Southern California Director
of Acedemic Services, Candy Duncan says,
All students should take this course. I am
going to require all freshmen to take it "
Louisiana State University Athletic Depart
ment Director of Academics, Charles Alex
ander says,"I took the course and f(*md out
thai the key to getting better giadcs is not
studying k>ngcr, hut learning better memory
techniques"
IK LA law student Kcgina Hermann says,"I
used to read my law hooks up to three times
in preparation for cases Now I only have to
read them once and retain information for
as long as I want, not (ust until the test is
over I wish I could have studied Mr Jack
son's memory techniques in college."
"Ytw'rc not as good as you think ytxi arc, if
yi*i can t read a hook once friwn cover to
cover and remember every bit of information
by page number", savs memory expert A bin
Jacks* hi
Ab in Jackson has been teaching attorneys,
ikmors, and law enforcement agencies mem
ory techniques for 12 years, and noticcd an
increase in the number of students taking his
course with startling increases in their
grades
"The reason is simple . say Jackson. "All a
student has to do is ask thcmsclf these three
quest ions
1 If I could remember everythrng I read,
would my grades be better?
2 If I could recall everything I heard in class
lectures, how much better would my
grades be?
3. Htwv many memory techniques do I now
know?"
Most students only know one memory
technique repetition. Among memory
experts, repetition is at the rock bottom of
the list because it forces student to spend
Uxi much time reading, and re-reading,
and re-reading, and once the test is given,
they forget everything'
Jackson hits taught his memory techniques
to those with excellent G.P A.'s wishing to
cut down on studying lime while maintain
ing top grades and to those who want to
increase their G.P.A. Under the present
set up of the education system, those who
can remember the most get the highest
grades.
Mr. Jackson will teach each class member
how to read text Kioks once and remem
ber all material, how to listen to a lecture
and remember everything, fww to remem
ber names and faces, complex math for
mulas. speeches, history, languages, and
how to take exams which is nothing more
than remembering answers
Because Mr Jackson tcachcs each student
individually, he can onlv accept VI persons
in each class on a first cxvne, first served
basis.
His class will be held Thursday, April 12
in the CVpress Koi*n at the Holiday Inn
