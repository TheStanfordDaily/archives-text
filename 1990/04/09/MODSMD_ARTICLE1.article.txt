# Planning a yearlong party
## Centennial to offer chance to relive history 
### Sue Kown 
In the early morning hours of Oct. 1,
1891, construction workers were still
preparing the Inner Quadrangle for the
opening ceremonies after six years of
planning and building Stanford Univer
sity.
Panels of red and white cloth and a
life-size portrait of Leland Stanford Jr.
backed the alcove where the dignitaries
would sit. About 2,000 chairs were set
up in the three-acre Quad, to be filled
by people flowing in on horseback, in
carriages and farm wagons, and on foot.

At 11 a.m., some 400 students led a
chant — "Wah-hoo! Wah-hoo! L-S-J-U!
Stan-ford!" — to symbolize their enthu
siasm for the birth of a new educational
institution in the West.
On Sept. 30, 1990, 99 years later, the
Stanford Centennial Celebration Com
mittee plans to relive the excitement of
Stanford's opening day with birthday
balloons and ceremonies, beginning a
yearlong celebration of Stanford's
birthday.
While the campus will be filled with

Stanford's Centennial.
spirited alumni and special events,
the Centennial will be an occasion
with purposes beyond mere
celebration.
The year's events will focus
upon an important theme — the
international, interdisciplinary
and intercultural face of the
changing world.
"The Centennial is a profound
opportunity to reflect upon and
reassess Stanford's history and re
establish what Stanford exists to
do in society and how it intends
to meet its obligations in its sec
ond century," said Centennial Ex
ecutive Director Stephen Peeps.
He said funding for the celebra
tions would come from friends of
the University, foundations and
corporations. "We are aware of
the need to be cost-effective. The
celebration will not be a glitzy,
ostentatious event. We are trying
to strike a balance," he said.
The main events commemorat
ing Stanford's 100 th year will be
three large-scale academic sympo
sia, led by Nobel laureates Ken
neth Arrow and Paul Berg,
Pulitzer Prize-winner James Ris
ser and Mac Arthur Fellows Shir
ley Heath and William Durham.
The three symposia will focus
on the information explosion, the
emergence of a multicultural so

ciety and genetic engineering and
the human environment, examin
ing those topics from technologi
cal, humanistic and social
scientific perspectives.
"The overarching goal for the
conferences is to engage scholars
from diverse disciplines in a
landmark assessment of the world
— and of their universities — as
we approach the end of the 20th
century. The symposia will leave
a substantive intellectual legacy
on the occasion of Stanford's cen
tennial," said Gerald Lieberman,
chair of the Centennial Celebra
tion Operating Committee and a
professor of operations research
and statistics.
"It's a teachable moment,"
Peeps added. "We can use the
event to heighten public under
standing of the role of higher ed
ucation, showcasing Stanford
University, on important national
and international problems.
Hopefully, the alumni and indi
viduals who attend the events will
leave with a greater appreciation
for what Stanford seeks to do."
Aside from its involvement in
the symposia and other activities
to take place during the actual
centennial year, the operating
committee has been active in sup
porting more than 60 academic
projects since its formation in
1985.
Recent projects include the
Veblen Centennial Lecture Series

on Race and Ethnicity; the pro
gram "Human Biology: The Chal
lenge for the Year 2005"; the
Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project's video "Keepers of the
Dream"; the Creative Writing
Program's centennial anthology,
"The Uncommon Touch"; and the
Humanities Center conference,
"Culture, Gender and Social
Movements of the 19605" to be
held this month.
Other programming objectives
for the committee are to com
memorate Stanford's rich heritage
and celebrate Stanford's contem
porary diversity. Peeps said, "The
world is becoming separated into
more identities with smaller
boundaries." Citing the recent
changes in Eastern Europe, Peeps
said, "We face the need to tie eth
nicity and different cultures to
gether."
To heighten awareness of Stan
ford's involvement in these
changes abroad, the operations
committee has staged three inter
national celebrations: in London
in April 1989, in Mexico City in
February of this year and in
Toronto last month.
Some of the topics covered in
the Toronto conference included
"Economic Relations in North
America: Implications of Trade
Negotiations," "Acid Rain in
North America," "Politics in the
People's Republic of China" and
"Multiculturalism: What's Miss

ing in the Conversations?"
University President Donald
Kennedy also spoke on "Educat
ing Leaders for a World Without
Borders," and Graduate School of
Business Prof. George Shultz cov
ered "Why the World is Changing
and What We Should Do About
It."
A fourth conference is sched
uled in Hong Kong next October.
The centennial year is intended
to cap the events and programs
of the past five years, but it will
also concentrate on building spirit
and excitement for Stanford's
100 th birthday.
Plans include events such as a
formal convocation in Frost Am
phitheatre honoring the 100 th
group of students to enroll at
Stanford, ceremonies for a U.S.
Postal Service postal card com
memorating Stanford's centenni
al, a San Francisco Symphony
concert at Davies Hall, a centen
nial season of the Lively Arts at
Stanford, an event honoring
Leland Stanford Jr.'s parents on
Parents' Weekend and a grand
finale weekend with fireworks
and headline entertainment.
Peeps said the year's events
"should bring from 10,000 to
15,000 alumni to Stanford. It will
be a genuinely irretrievable mo
ment to gather, attach and reat
tach individuals to Stanford for
years to come."
