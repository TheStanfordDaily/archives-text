# Planning a yearlong party
## Centennial to offer chance to relive history 
### Sue Kown 
In the early morning hours of Oct. 1,
1891, construction workers were still
preparing the Inner Quadrangle for the
opening ceremonies after six years of
planning and building Stanford Univer
sity.
Panels of red and white cloth and a
life-size portrait of Leland Stanford Jr.
backed the alcove where the dignitaries
would sit. About 2,000 chairs were set
up in the three-acre Quad, to be filled
by people flowing in on horseback, in
carriages and farm wagons, and on foot.

At 11 a.m., some 400 students led a
chant — "Wah-hoo! Wah-hoo! L-S-J-U!
Stan-ford!" — to symbolize their enthu
siasm for the birth of a new educational
institution in the West.
On Sept. 30, 1990, 99 years later, the
Stanford Centennial Celebration Com
mittee plans to relive the excitement of
Stanford's opening day with birthday
balloons and ceremonies, beginning a
yearlong celebration of Stanford's
birthday.

Stanford's Centennial.
