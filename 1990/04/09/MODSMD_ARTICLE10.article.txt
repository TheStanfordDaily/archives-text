# Invasion of the orygia vetusta
## Caterpillars return, get a not-so-warm welcome 
### Kaarin Michaelsen 
They're baaaaack! No, they're
not poltergeists; they're caterpil
lars, and again this spring the
one-inch critters have reappeared
to annoy students, faculty and
staff.
"Orygia vetusta," commonly
known as Western tussock moth
caterpillars, can be found on trees
all across campus. The critters fall
off branches and leaves and cling
to the clothes, hair or backpack
of the unsuspecting walker or
biker.
"While riding home, I saw a big
clump of them (caterpillars) dan
gling from a branch, just waiting
to drop on me. I was able to dodge
it, but the guy behind me didn't
see it and got the disgusting
things all over him," said senior
Darline Mondesir.
Along with being annoying, the
pale green caterpillars pose prob
lems for the trees they inhabit.

According to Stephen Gayle of Op
erations and Maintenance, the
larvae put severe stress on an oak
tree by eating its leaves. Without
restraints, they can completely
defoliate the tree, leaving it sus
ceptible to disease.
"The loss of the majority of its
leaves this early in the spring,
when the tree is undergoing a
large degree of photosynthesis,
would be for the tree the equiv
alent of skipping dinner for two
or three weeks. The caterpillars
remove the tree's means of ob
taining nourishment," said Gayle.
In the past, the University has
had to spray all trees with or
thene, a synthetic organic insec
ticide which destroys most of the
larvae, in order to reduce the
damage done by the pests' annual
arrival. The decision of whether
to spray again this year will be
made in the next two or three
weeks, Gayle said.
"What we're doing now is just

basically monitoring the popula
tion growth, which varies widely
from year to year. We're hoping
that it won't be too high so that
we can be selective in the trees
that we spray," he said. The spray
ing can cost the University
anywhere from $2,000 in a very
light year to more than $10,000
in a bad one.
While neither the pesticide nor
the caterpillar itself is potentially
harmful to humans, the larvae do
shed bristly white hairs and scales
that can cause some people to
develop allergies. "Several of our
tree workers have broken out with
red, itching rashes after touching
the bugs," noted Gayle, but the
rashes turned out to be nothing
serious.
"Until we make the decision
about spraying, about the only
thing people can do to help alle
viate the problem and eliminate
the annoyance the bugs cause is
to duck when going under trees."
