BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -
Voters choosing Hungary's first freely
elected government in 43 years gave
an overwhelming victory yesterday to
Hungary's main conservative party.
"I am completely certain that we
won the elections," Democratic Forum
President Jozsef Antall told jubilant
supporters crowding party headquar
ters six hours after polls closed.
"But it is not we, but the Hungarian
people who have won these elections,"
he said.
Final results for the 261 parliamen
tary seats at stake in runoff elections
yesterday were not expected before
Tuesday. But state television showed
the conservative Hungarian Demo
cratic Forum winning 41.8 percent of
the vote, or 116 seats, with more than
90 percent of the votes counted.
Their closest rivals, the liberal Alli
ance of Free Democrats, won 21 per
cent of the vote, or 58 seats.
The agrarian-based Smallholders
party won 29 districts with 11.5 per
cent of the vote, while reform Com
munists grouped in the Socialist Party
had won 18 with 8 percent.
It was the second conservative sweep
in Eastern Europe in as many free
elections. East Germans gave conser
vatives a clear victory in elections on
March 18, relegating the Communists
to an opposition role.
In Hungary, 171 of the 261 seats
were voted on directly yesterday.
Ninety seats will be determined on the
voting percentage each party receives.
With 43 seats won by Democratic
Forum candidates in the first round
March 25, the party had a total of 159
seats after both rounds, according to
the preliminary calculations based on
90 percent returns.

The Free Democrats had 92 seats,
while the Smallholders had 44 and the
Socialists 32. Others seats were shared
by two smaller parties.
There are 394 seats in Parliament,
including eight seats to be allocated
to national minorities.
Democratic Forum President Antall
turned 58 yesterday, and a rare smile
creased his face as he was presented
with a gigantic boquet of flowers.
The early conservative advantage
forced a concession from Free Demo
crat leader Miklos Haraszti.
"It is clear that the HDF will gain
the most seats," he said.
Elections two weeks ago left 261 of
the National Assembly's 394 seats un
decided. That balloting gave no party
an outright majority but relegated the
former Communists to fourth place.
No party was considered strong
enough to win a majority in Sunday's
polling and a coalition government was
expected. More than 7.5 million people
were eligible to vote.
Both front-running parties, the
Democratic Forum and the Free Dem
ocrats, have refused to consider form
ing a government with the former
Communists.
Many Hungarians seemed weary
after the second round of balloting in
two weeks.
"It's clear that people have become
tired," Interim President Matyas
Szueros told reporters before casting
his ballot. "It's time to end the election
process."
The first round of elections on
March 25 put the Hungarian Demo
cratic Forum and the liberal Alliance
of Free Democrats in the lead, but
neither party polled a majority, forcing
yesterday's second round.
