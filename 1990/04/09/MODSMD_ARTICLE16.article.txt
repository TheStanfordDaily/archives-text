Annual address signals
new direction for
universities everywhere

WHAT UNIVERSITY
PRESIDENT Donald Ken
nedy said last Thursday
may be a benchmark not only for
Stanford but for all of American
higher education as well.
In his annual address to the Ac
ademic Council, Kennedy defined
a vision of "Stanford in its second
century" centered around a daring
proposition — that Stanford move
away from research and place more
emphasis on teaching, especially
undergraduate teaching.
Details of the speech landed on
the front pages of such influential
newspapers as the Los Angeles
Times, and much more national
attention is likely to be paid the
speech in the weeks and months
to come.
How can one 45-minute speech
be so important?
First of all, in those 45 minutes
the president shaped the 21st
century agenda for one of the
worlds leading academic institu
tions.
Kennedy's charge to the Univer
sity to "reaffirm that education . . .
is the primary task" was not just
rhetoric — it was a mandate for
the entire University to evaluate
what it is doing and to modify its
objectives. If that mandate is
carried out throughout the insti
tution, Stanford will look quite dif
ferent in as little as 20 years.
In a larger sense, however, Ken
nedy's address was a challenge to
the American academic community
as a whole. It was a challenge to
foster better ties between the re
search and teaching functions of
universities, to think more criti
cally about the qualities of a good

education, to do business more in
telligently.
As Kennedy himself noted, Stan
ford is in a unique position to be
a national leader in this "reforma
tion" of education. And if the
reformation occurs as Kennedy
envisions, many may look back to
Thursday's speech as the start of
it all.
Certainly, there are some caveats
to be considered.
In its responses to the presi
dent's comments, the University
community should remember that
teaching and research are not
mutually exclusive — and Kennedy
does not imply that they are. Re
search opportunities abound on
this campus for undergraduates,
and such opportunities can be
some of the most educationally sat
isfying experiences in a Stanford
student's career.
Furthermore, much of the
quality of Stanford's academic pro
grams is due to the caliber of its
faculty — and good professors are
attracted to universities that offer
attractive research opportunities.
To go too far in the direction of
compromising research programs
would ultimately mean very bad
news for the University.
Finally, Kennedy's speech
devoted a good deal of attention to
streamlining, that- process by
whichjthe;Uniyersity is both paring
its budget a tighter,
more efficient structured In that
effort, the University must not
compromise its commitment to a
multicultural environment and a
multicultural education.
Ultimately, the success of Ken
nedy's plan for an educational
reformation will depend on the in
dividual members of the Stanford
community. The president's charge
will require on everyone's part an
openness to new ideas, a tolerance
of experimentation and a willing
ness to work together to begin this
"work of renewal."
