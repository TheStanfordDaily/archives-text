Housed fraternity members do not value pluralism

I USED TO believe that the exis
tence of housed fraternities on
campus was justifiable in that at
least they kept a certain percentage of
a certain type of people all together
and away from other students. That
way the rest of us could get many
valuable experiences out of Stanford
without having to deal with them.
For my first year at Stanford, a
fraternity was a place where I could go
to party on the weekends.
But as the year progressed, there
were a lot of things that began to
bother me. I remember walking into a
fraternity hallway where two drunken
students, one of them a house member,
were discussing the house picture. I
overheard him joking, "Here's our
token black. And here's our token few
Asians."
And I remember reading with dis
belief that the president of the Inter
fraternity Council claimed that a gay
student in a housed fraternity might
disrupt the feeling of brotherhood that

is essential to a frat and that the
student might not be offered a bid on
those grounds.
I once went to a party where a
naked female doll, partially mutilated
and painted red in some parts, was
being tossed about. Most of the party
goers were so far gone that the whole
place seemed almost surreal and
savage, like a scene from "Lord of the
Flies."
I have seen how isolated
brotherhood-style houses can quickly
degenerate — not only in fraternities
but in dorms like Alpha Sig as well —
and how the bonds that build respect
and acceptance of differences are
rapidly broken through a socialization
far more insidious than the supposed
"Res Ed Agenda."
And I have "sat at their tables"
many times, eating with my friends
who live in frats. I have gone to their
parties and have attended their fund
raisers and charity events. But what I
have seen has onlv reinforced mv

beliefs.
I may be unfair to base my opinions
on a few personal experiences. But I've
been a Resident Assistant for two
years, and unfortunately I've seen the
same pattern repeating itself.
Whether or not the system brings it
upon itself, there is a "fraternity men
tality" and lifestyle, almost by defini
tion, even if it is only due to the most
obvious and visible aspects of fraternal
living. Not surprisingly, RA staffs can
usually predict with great accuracy
which frosh men will join housed frats.
I do not mean to imply that frater
nity members all think alike or are not
unique individuals. In fact, most of the
people I know who joined housed frats
are decent people. However, I do be
lieve that these people have little or no
interest in embracing — and have
never truly understood — the kind of
pluralism I have come to know at
Stanford.
Pluralism is more than having
people of the opposite sex or of other

races living around you (though the
absence of authentically feminine per
spectives and the relatively low per
centage of minorities in housed frats is
cause for concern in itself). I agree
with Dennis Matthies (who by the way
is a former fraternity member), who
says that pluralism is a spiritual idea,
and that "comfort" in day to day living
is both too easy and too dangerous.
And so I hope the University
abolishes the housed fraternity system
as best as it is able, for the benefit of
those in the houses and those who
would join them.
But I want them abolished for the
sake of non-fraternity students as well.
We are also too comfortable with the
way things are, with those with the
"fraternity mentality" and lifestyle far
from us easily scape-goated for all that
is wrong with Stanford. We should
have to all live together, in discomfort
if need be.
