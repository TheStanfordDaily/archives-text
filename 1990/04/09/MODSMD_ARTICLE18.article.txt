# Helmets are needed for safe biking around campus
## 
### 
It's that time of year again: the
weather is warm, baseball is hot and
the heart transplant team is burning
the midnight oil (generic, not
Australian). Yes, we have no bicycle
helmets.
We're all outside and in a great
mood and often in 12th gear on our
bikes. Some of us are on red scooters
(Is Cal covered with blue scooters?)
and we're not really sure which gear is
which ("Where's reverse on this
thing?"). But we're all outside and

we're happy and our hair gets really
funky in the wind, doesn't it?
Unfortunately, we're not all moving
at the same speed. Some of us are
basically "Top-Gun-Goes-To-College"
types, breezing along comfortably at
Mach two, and occasionally swerving to
dodge imaginary "Cruise" missiles.
Others of us are merely trying to
stay on course while we wave to our
loved ones and acquaintances, carry on
a conversation, finish a problem set,
eat lunch, think of something clever to
say in section and/or occasionally
swerve at other bikers in sort of a fun,
imaginary missile sort of way.
The point is, there are quite a few
dangers prowling around out here, and
we are very distracted. We are also, for
the most part, helmetless.
There are many reasons for this, the

most erudite and scientific of which is
"I'm not going to look like a dork and
get ragged on anymore, OK?" Which is
fine and dandy to a lot of cardiology
patients who are just waiting for one
of us to "Spring Forward, FaJl Back"
in a big way.
Now, that may sound a bit morbid
to some, but we're talking official Mor
bidity and Mortality Conference mate
rial here, folks. Roe v. Wade was a
close one — Car v. Bike (or even
Loose Gravel v. Bike) could be a
blowout.
You don't even have to be moving,
you know. There are lots of cases of
those who simply fall over, hit the
pavement (physics majors: calculate the
head velocity at impact of a 5 foot, 6
inch valedictorian), and end up with
the mentality of a rutabaga or —

shudder — a Berkeley freshman (or
worse, a Berkeley senior).
What's the solution? Just how do we
convince the What Is Cool Committee
members that looking like a dork is
now cool? (We did it with "Not
smoking is now cool" and "Not trash
ing the planet is now cool.")
Perhaps we can decorate our helmets
a bit. How about neon-colored graffiti
like Blank Cal, or Blank USC or the
perennial favorite, Blank Blank Blank?
Or how about some plain old
smarts? A mind is a terrible thing to
waste. It's also a terrible thing to
squash.
