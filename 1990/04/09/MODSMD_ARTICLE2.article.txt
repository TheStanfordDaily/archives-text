# Board of Trustees to tackle rebuilding, operating budget
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
The University's operating budget and
seismic reconstruction plans will be on the
agenda at the Board of Trustees meeting
today and tomorrow.
Although the trustees usually approve
the following year's specific operating
budget in April, the University's current
budget-cutting and administrative stream
lining plans will probably cause a concrete
decision to be postponed until June, ac
cording to Provost James Rosse.
The proposed 1990-1991 operating
budget is balanced at $409 million, but it
assumes $7.2 million in reductions that
have not yet been made. A complete budget
will be presented at the trustees' June
meeting.

Major elements of the
proposed budget include:
• Undergraduate finan
cial aid. Funds have been
budgeted to allow the Uni
versity to reduce the self
help component of the
student financial aid pack
age from 25 percent to 20
percent;
• Indirect cost rate in-

crease. The University intends to raise and
then hold the rate at 78 percent; and
• Facilities planning. Funds have been
budgeted for earthquake repair.
In February, the trustees heard a report
on the minimum earthquake repair and
strengthening program, expected to cost


Rosse
$134 million.
At this week's meeting, the
trustees will hear a report on a
program to strengthen hazardous
buildings beyond current state re
quirements, prevent future dam
age and preserve the architecture.
The total repair cost would in
crease to about $172 million if
such options were exercised.
Seismic reconstruction plans
for the Geology Corner, the Lan
guage Corner, Green Library West
and the Graduate School of Busi
ness will be considered.
The full board meeting, at
which the trustees vote on the
various proposals presented to
them, takes place tomorrow.
