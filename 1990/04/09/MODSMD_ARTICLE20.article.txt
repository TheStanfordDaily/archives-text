I DRINK A LOT of Diet Coke. For
the most part, it's a problem between
me and my dentist, between me and
those laboratory rats who consume
Nutrasweet for a living and between me
and today's Law School fall semester
paper deadline. In about a month it will
be between me and final exams.
And I prefer my Diet Coke cold, in the
can. No glass, no ice, just me, 12 ounces
of carbonated water, caramel color, aspar
tame, phosphoric acid, potassium ben
zoate, natural flavors, citric acid and
caffeine — and the taste of the aluminum
can.
The second I'm down to nothing but
the aluminum can, however, my Diet
Coke habit is between me and everyone
and everything that has an interest in
keeping the world a safe place to live
now that it seems like the world is going
to be safe from an East-West nuclear
holocaust.
I think about this everytime I finish
a can. Where do I put it? I can't help
but think about it. My roommate is one
of these Earth Day (1990) People. We
have three paper sacks, which we reuse,
under our kitchen counter: one for plas
tics, one for aluminum and one for
bottles. Newspapers get stacked under
the living room end table; the regular
garbage is under the sink.
Recycling is a fairly easy environmental
task, particularly at Stanford, where we
have bins everywhere. Nonetheless, one
week from tomorrow, on Earth Week
1990's Recycling Day, these Earth Day
People are going to build a paper sculp
ture from paper left in Memorial Audi

torium after a Sunday Flick.
Now I've only been to one Sunday
Flick, and that was "Roxanne" two-and
a-half years ago. I had to sit on the stairs
in the aisles and only got hit three times
by paper wads. 1 also had to sit through
extended wolf-whistles every time Darryl
Hannah walked onto the screen. The
whistling probably came from the same
people who watched "The Laker Girls"
last week.
Anyway, I'm sure this 60-pound sculp
ture will be at least the size of the Falcon
that sits outside the law school. And I'm
sure that the next day we'll have a paper
bag for paper under our kitchen counter.
Not every facet of becoming environ
mentally conscious is as effortless as
dropping an aluminum can in the right
bin or paper sack, a concept that these
Earth Day People obviously have latched
on to. So along with Recycling Day, we've
got Monday's Energy Day, Wednesday's
Water Conservation Day, Thursday's
Transportation and Emissions Day, Fri
day's Toxics Day and Saturday's Outdoor
Day. Sunday morning features a sunrise
ceremony at the Oval, a rally at Frost
Ampitheater and a Fun Run joining the
two.
I think it all sounds pretty good, except
the Fun Run, which strikes me as an
oxymoron. 1 mean, I've had fun running
before — as long as I'm chasing some
ball, or someone with a ball. So I'll skip
the Fun Run, particularly since these
Earth Day People told me I can walk or
I can ride a bike but I can't drive my
car. I guess the Earth Day 500 just
doesn't make much sense.

Actually, I'm not too into the "eco
showers" (turn the water off while you
lather up) that will be part of Water
Conservation Day either. I tried it once
last week, and I just can't get into the
soap sort of sticking to my skin and
producing a filmy feeling.
Quite frankly, like a lot of Idahoans,
I've found environmental consciousness
to be something of a mixed bag, which
is not to say you should mix your recy- <
cling bags.
Idaho has a lot of natural resources, j
and a lot of majestic scenery worth con- j
serving. But three of the state's major
industries — timber, farming and the.
Idaho Nuclear Engineering Laboratory!
— have never been at the top of environ-!
mentalists' lists. Production versus con-;
servation. To get by on a day-to-day basis, J
a lot of people employed in these indus
tries — and that's a lot of people — need
them to operate consistently and at pretty
near full capacity.
It is solving this dilemma, I suspect,
that may be the hardest and most re
warding part of environmental conscious
ness.
But don't forget the easy part. Throw
this paper in a recycling bin when you're
done — after you've cut out this column,
of course.
