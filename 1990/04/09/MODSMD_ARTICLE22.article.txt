Columnist accuses
without significant
facts or proof

In response to Eric Mikkelson's April
2 letter and Alex Grant's April 3
column, both of whom impugn posi
tions unsympathetic to theirs:
Mikkelson's language exercises a
rhetoric of mass hysteria and paranoia:
"I am counting the hours until I am
labeled as a racist by minds in the
clutches of multicultural group-think."
I wonder if the phrase "clutches of
multicultural group-think" itself dem
onstrates the very "labeling" that he
professes to dread.
In other words, his letter consists of
an inversion — a projection of his own
tactics and motives onto those of
others. Those who disagree with his
assumptions, procedures and conclu
sions apparently are "minds in the
clutches" of some hysterical and irra
tional herd instinct.
Grant, on the other hand, tries to
make a case for the fractious rhetoric
of a ruse he dubs "proof through

vehemence," but he ought to have
described another: glittering
generalities.
His own generalizations permit him
to characterize a diverse number of
organizations and individuals as "label
and-smear" tacticians, "self-proclaimed
progressives," "dogmatic" and as claim
ing for themselves "a monopoly on
compassion and insight." He is able to
do this without citing a single incident
or detail, without substantiating a
single allegation.
Unlike Grant, I expect scrupulous
and specific details in making a "care
ful, reasoned analysis." Let us look at
the character of Grant's own "proof
through vehemence."
"Parties such as the People's Plat
form have tried to present Stanford as
a university which has racial an
tagonism insidiously woven into the
fabric of its daily life." "This percep
tion of 'institutional racism' is . . .
profoundly inaccurate. It has produced
a number of unfounded — and conse
quently, unfair — charges of racism; it
has helped to create misdirected poli
cies and bad decisions, and it has
severely debilitated our ability to con
duct productive debate."
Where and in what specific terms

has the People's Platform offered such
a position? And on what grounds are
these anonymous charges "profoundly
inaccurate?" What "number of charges'
concern Grant? What "misdirected
policies and bad decisions" are in ques
tion here?
And if debate is so "severely
debilitated," why do the likes of Grant,
Mikkelson, French Prof. Robert Cohn
and Hoover Institution Fellow Sidney
Hook have so many opportunities to
advertise their complaints despite the
charges by both Grant and Mikkelson
that such debate is contravened,
restricted and under-represented?
"An accusation of racism of any sort
can be made without proof or signifi
cant evidence and be acceptable as fact
. . ." Of any sort? Where? Support a
single instance of such a charge being
made without "significant evidence."
Who exactly accepts these anonymous
charges "as fact?"
"Covert racism can never be dis
proven because both evidence and lack
of evidence of racial antagonism work
to support the theory of covert rac
ism." Aside from the fact that "covert
racism" is hardly a "theory," the
proposition is a nonsequitur: both
evidence and lack of evidence "work to

support the theory?" What does this
mean? How does this enigmatic mecha
nism operate? To what particular inci
dent is Grant referring?
It is precisely this sort of hyperbolic
bad faith that somehow comes to stig
matize those who disagree with Grant's
opinions. "The racist label was applied
in the Western Culture debate enabling
the Cultures, Ideas and Values sup
porters to obscure and discredit the
arguments of those who opposed the
almost infinite expansion of a
course. ..."
The "label" was applied by everyone
interested in CIV? CIV courses are
subject to an "almost infinite expan
sion?" Infinite? How and why has the
effort to include previously excluded
texts been translated into an "almost
infinite expansion?" Where?
As Grant knows fully well, the CIV
tracks merely open up some curricula
to two or three additional texts. Either
the texts can be added, or they can be
suggested as alternates to previous
texts. In what way, precisely, does this
constitute an "almost infinite expan
sion?"
I wonder who, in this case, has
"debilitated" debate. Differences of
opinion do not amount to debilitation.

Let us face up to these differences
with some fairness. In all fairness, I
welcome any recommendations which
would modify my own misreading of,
and unfairness to, Grant.
By the way, I'm white.

Columnist accuses
without significant
facts or proof

In response to Eric Mikkelson's April
2 letter and Alex Grant's April 3
column, both of whom impugn posi
tions unsympathetic to theirs:
Mikkelson's language exercises a
rhetoric of mass hysteria and paranoia:
"I am counting the hours until I am
labeled as a racist by minds in the
clutches of multicultural group-think."
I wonder if the phrase "clutches of
multicultural group-think" itself dem
onstrates the very "labeling" that he
professes to dread.
In other words, his letter consists of
an inversion — a projection of his own
tactics and motives onto those of
others. Those who disagree with his
assumptions, procedures and conclu
sions apparently are "minds in the
clutches" of some hysterical and irra
tional herd instinct.
Grant, on the other hand, tries to
make a case for the fractious rhetoric
of a ruse he dubs "proof through

vehemence," but he ought to have
described another: glittering
generalities.
His own generalizations permit him
to characterize a diverse number of
organizations and individuals as "label
and-smear" tacticians, "self-proclaimed
progressives," "dogmatic" and as claim
ing for themselves "a monopoly on
compassion and insight." He is able to
do this without citing a single incident
or detail, without substantiating a
single allegation.
Unlike Grant, I expect scrupulous
and specific details in making a "care
ful, reasoned analysis." Let us look at
the character of Grant's own "proof
through vehemence."
"Parties such as the People's Plat
form have tried to present Stanford as
a university which has racial an
tagonism insidiously woven into the
fabric of its daily life." "This percep
tion of 'institutional racism' is . . .
profoundly inaccurate. It has produced
a number of unfounded — and conse
quently, unfair — charges of racism; it
has helped to create misdirected poli
cies and bad decisions, and it has
severely debilitated our ability to con
duct productive debate."
Where and in what specific terms

has the People's Platform offered such
a position? And on what grounds are
these anonymous charges "profoundly
inaccurate?" What "number of charges'
concern Grant? What "misdirected
policies and bad decisions" are in ques
tion here?
And if debate is so "severely
debilitated," why do the likes of Grant,
Mikkelson, French Prof. Robert Cohn
and Hoover Institution Fellow Sidney
Hook have so many opportunities to
advertise their complaints despite the
charges by both Grant and Mikkelson
that such debate is contravened,
restricted and under-represented?
"An accusation of racism of any sort
can be made without proof or signifi
cant evidence and be acceptable as fact
. . ." Of any sort? Where? Support a
single instance of such a charge being
made without "significant evidence."
Who exactly accepts these anonymous
charges "as fact?"
"Covert racism can never be dis
proven because both evidence and lack
of evidence of racial antagonism work
to support the theory of covert rac
ism." Aside from the fact that "covert
racism" is hardly a "theory," the
proposition is a nonsequitur: both
evidence and lack of evidence "work to

support the theory?" What does this
mean? How does this enigmatic mecha
nism operate? To what particular inci
dent is Grant referring?
It is precisely this sort of hyperbolic
bad faith that somehow comes to stig
matize those who disagree with Grant's
opinions. "The racist label was applied
in the Western Culture debate enabling
the Cultures, Ideas and Values sup
porters to obscure and discredit the
arguments of those who opposed the
almost infinite expansion of a
course. ..."
The "label" was applied by everyone
interested in CIV? CIV courses are
subject to an "almost infinite expan
sion?" Infinite? How and why has the
effort to include previously excluded
texts been translated into an "almost
infinite expansion?" Where?
As Grant knows fully well, the CIV
tracks merely open up some curricula
to two or three additional texts. Either
the texts can be added, or they can be
suggested as alternates to previous
texts. In what way, precisely, does this
constitute an "almost infinite expan
sion?"
I wonder who, in this case, has
"debilitated" debate. Differences of
opinion do not amount to debilitation.

Let us face up to these differences
with some fairness. In all fairness, I
welcome any recommendations which
would modify my own misreading of,
and unfairness to, Grant.
By the way, I'm white.
