## Pitching plus hitting equals broom-time for Card nine 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
There are two basic ways to
win a baseball game.
The easy way: Don't let the
other team score. It's quick and
it's simple.
The hard way: Let 'em score
as much as they can, then score
more. It's not quick, it's definitely
not simple, but it's a heck of a
lot of fun to watch.
Either way works.
Just ask the Cardinal nine,
which followed Plan A in last Fri
day's opener against UCLA, Plan
Bin Saturday's see-saw slugfest
and a little bit of both to complete
the sweep yesterday.

Cardinal sweeps three

game series with Bruins

The sweep, Stanford's second
in a row in Six-Pac play, leaves
the Cardinal atop the league at
11-3, 30-7 overall. Stanford has
now won 17 of its last 19 games,
including eight in a row in the
Six-Pac.
Friday's 6-1 Cardinal win fol
lowed pretty much the same script
as every other game Stan Spencer
has pitched this year, which
means the Bruins got nothing and
liked it. For seven and two-thirds
innings, in fact, UCIJ\ literally
got nothing: One and only one
Bruin reached base — on an error
— and he was picked off a minute
later.
No hits, no walks, no nothing.
"(Stan's) control was the big thing
today," Stanford catcher Troy Tal
lman said. "His velocity has had
better days, but his control was
the best since I've been here."
"That boy was on today," said
•Jeff Hammonds, who picked up a
hit in the seventh (on a 3-0 pitch,
no less) to extend his hitting
streak to 28 games. "You can't
ask for too much more."
In the eighth, however, with
two gone and the count 0-1, Bruin
right fielder David Tokheim
turned on an inside pitch and sent
it over the fence in right, throwing
the no-hitter and shutout right
out the window. "I wanted to go
up and in, and I don't know if I
missed," Spencer said. "It wasn't
a bad pitch."

With the no-hitter gone, Spen
cer gave up two more hits in the
ninth, but completed the game
for his ninth win. "(The no-hitter)
I think was in the back of my
mind, but I was more concerned
about the shutout," Spencer said.
"And I lost both on one pitch."
It didn't really matter. With
Tallman, Troy Paulsen and Roger
Burnett each going 2-for-4, the
game was long over by the time
Tokheim homered.
Tallman and Burnett continued
their tear the next day, racking
up six of the team's 12 hits in a
9-7, back-and-forth, I-don't-want
the-lead-you-take-it win.
"I changed my stance a few
weeks ago, and it's just been a
matter of my getting comfortable
with it," said Tallman, who was
7-for-17 in the five games before
the UCLA series. "I was lunging
at the ball. . . (and the stance)
keeps me from lunging at it.
Hopefully I can keep this up."
Even with Tallman starting to
produce — he was 2-for-3 with a
double and run scored — it was
Burnett who was Saturday's star.
The sophomore shortstop was 4-
for-4, scored four runs (including
the game-winner) and hit a homer
for the third straight game.
"(Burnett's) really swinging the
bat well," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "He's seeing the
ball well and hitting it to all fields:
You pitch him outside and he
takes you the other way."
It was Hammonds, though, who
provided the first highlight of the
game. With the score 3-1 UCLA,
Hammonds came up in the bot
tom of the fourth with two men
on. After watching three balls sail
by, Hammonds took a strike,
fouled a pitch off, and then waited
as Tim Lindsay served up a fat
change-up.
See ya! Hammonds crushed the
ball on a line to left. Fourth career
homer, 29-game streak, Stanford
up 4-3.
The Bruins took the lead right
back in the fifth when Shawn
(.186) Wills, whose 16 hits coming
into the series included seven in
field singles, took a Mike Mussina
pitch and sent it over the wall,
trees, and chain-link fence behind
the trees. Go figure. Bruins 6-4.
That lead lasted a whole ten
minutes, which was how long it
took for Burnett to come to the

plate and take Lindsay deep. Six
all.
In a game with so much power,
it made perfect sense when the
winning runs were scored on an
error. At eight-all in the eighth,
Burnett and Tallman both hit
one-out singles and advanced on
Hammonds' pop-out. After Paul
sen pulled a full-count walk, David
McCarty came to the plate and
sent a grounder toward shortstop
Mike Hankins.
Hankins dove to make the stop,
realized his only play was at
first. . and threw the ball halfway
to Menlo Park. Two runs scored,
and Mussina pitched a 1-2-3 ninth
for the win.
Yesterday's game picked up
where Saturday's left off, with
Stanford taking a 1-0 lead in the
second, UCLA tying it an inning

later, the Cardinal scoring twice
more minutes later, and then
UCLA knocking starter Brian
Sackinsky out with five runs in
the fourth.
With Sackinsky gone, though,
the Bruins were done for the day,
because junior Scott Weiss came
on and shut them down the rest
of the way. Weiss, who finished
the game with a career-high six
strikeouts, overcame some control
problems at in the fourth to baffle
the Bruins with his curve for the
next five innings.
"I had to get warm really quick,
and I don't know if I was totally
loose when I went in," Weiss said.
'Tve just been working on throw
ing strikes — that's the key to
success. You see guys like Stan
Spencer out there, and that's what
they're doing."

"Scott did a great job," Mar
quess said. "He came in when they
were rolling and shut 'em down."
"That was the best I've
thrown," said Weiss, who allowed
only three hits. "It's the midway
point of the season, and I've been
getting progressively better. I
can't stop there, though."
With the Bruins muzzled, the
Cardinal scratched back from a
6-3 deficit. Ryan Turner got one
run back with his first career
homer — "It's about fu--ing
time!" Paul Carey said after the
game — in the fourth, and then,
after Hammonds scored in the
fifth to make it 6-5, Carey came
to the plate with men on first and
second.

visited freshman starter Kris
Scwengel, who had been strug
gling. . .and left him in the game.
Oops. Two pitches later, Carey
smacked the ball over the fence
in right-center, and Scwengel was
gone. When Tim Griffin homered
three pitches later — hitting the
top of the TV tower in center —
the score was 9-6, and that was
that.
The homer salvaged a not-too
sunny weekend for Carey, who
was 2-for-13 against the Bruins.
"I had a good break, and I thought
I'd have some momentum coming
in, but I just sh- the bed," Carey
said. "It felt good to get it off my
back, but still, something's wrong.
That's why it's good to have guys
like Griff, McCarty, and Roger
who can pick you up."

There are two basic ways to
win a baseball game.
The easy way: Don't let the
other team score. It's quick and
it's simple.
The hard way: Let 'em score
as much as they can, then score
more. It's not quick, it's definitely
not simple, but it's a heck of a
lot of fun to watch.
Either way works.

Cardinal sweeps three

game series with Bruins

The sweep, Stanford's second
in a row in Six-Pac play, leaves
the Cardinal atop the league at
11-3, 30-7 overall. Stanford has
now won 17 of its last 19 games,
including eight in a row in the
Six-Pac.
Friday's 6-1 Cardinal win fol
lowed pretty much the same script
as every other game Stan Spencer
has pitched this year, which
means the Bruins got nothing and
liked it. For seven and two-thirds
innings, in fact, UCIJ\ literally
got nothing: One and only one
Bruin reached base — on an error
— and he was picked off a minute
later.
No hits, no walks, no nothing.
"(Stan's) control was the big thing
today," Stanford catcher Troy Tal
lman said. "His velocity has had
better days, but his control was
the best since I've been here."
"That boy was on today," said
•Jeff Hammonds, who picked up a
hit in the seventh (on a 3-0 pitch,
no less) to extend his hitting
streak to 28 games. "You can't
ask for too much more."
In the eighth, however, with
two gone and the count 0-1, Bruin
right fielder David Tokheim
turned on an inside pitch and sent
it over the fence in right, throwing
the no-hitter and shutout right
out the window. "I wanted to go
up and in, and I don't know if I
missed," Spencer said. "It wasn't
a bad pitch."

With the no-hitter gone, Spen
cer gave up two more hits in the
ninth, but completed the game
for his ninth win. "(The no-hitter)
I think was in the back of my
mind, but I was more concerned
about the shutout," Spencer said.
"And I lost both on one pitch."
It didn't really matter. With
Tallman, Troy Paulsen and Roger
Burnett each going 2-for-4, the
game was long over by the time
Tokheim homered.
Tallman and Burnett continued
their tear the next day, racking
up six of the team's 12 hits in a
9-7, back-and-forth, I-don't-want
the-lead-you-take-it win.
"I changed my stance a few
weeks ago, and it's just been a
matter of my getting comfortable
with it," said Tallman, who was
7-for-17 in the five games before
the UCLA series. "I was lunging
at the ball. . . (and the stance)
keeps me from lunging at it.
Hopefully I can keep this up."
Even with Tallman starting to
produce — he was 2-for-3 with a
double and run scored — it was
Burnett who was Saturday's star.
The sophomore shortstop was 4-
for-4, scored four runs (including
the game-winner) and hit a homer
for the third straight game.
"(Burnett's) really swinging the
bat well," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "He's seeing the
ball well and hitting it to all fields:
You pitch him outside and he
takes you the other way."
It was Hammonds, though, who
provided the first highlight of the
game. With the score 3-1 UCLA,
Hammonds came up in the bot
tom of the fourth with two men
on. After watching three balls sail
by, Hammonds took a strike,
fouled a pitch off, and then waited
as Tim Lindsay served up a fat
change-up.
See ya! Hammonds crushed the
ball on a line to left. Fourth career
homer, 29-game streak, Stanford
up 4-3.
The Bruins took the lead right
back in the fifth when Shawn
(.186) Wills, whose 16 hits coming
into the series included seven in
field singles, took a Mike Mussina
pitch and sent it over the wall,
trees, and chain-link fence behind
the trees. Go figure. Bruins 6-4.
That lead lasted a whole ten
minutes, which was how long it
took for Burnett to come to the

plate and take Lindsay deep. Six
all.
In a game with so much power,
it made perfect sense when the
winning runs were scored on an
error. At eight-all in the eighth,
Burnett and Tallman both hit
one-out singles and advanced on
Hammonds' pop-out. After Paul
sen pulled a full-count walk, David
McCarty came to the plate and
sent a grounder toward shortstop
Mike Hankins.
Hankins dove to make the stop,
realized his only play was at
first. . and threw the ball halfway
to Menlo Park. Two runs scored,
and Mussina pitched a 1-2-3 ninth
for the win.
Yesterday's game picked up
where Saturday's left off, with
Stanford taking a 1-0 lead in the
second, UCLA tying it an inning

later, the Cardinal scoring twice
more minutes later, and then
UCLA knocking starter Brian
Sackinsky out with five runs in
the fourth.
With Sackinsky gone, though,
the Bruins were done for the day,
because junior Scott Weiss came
on and shut them down the rest
of the way. Weiss, who finished
the game with a career-high six
strikeouts, overcame some control
problems at in the fourth to baffle
the Bruins with his curve for the
next five innings.
"I had to get warm really quick,
and I don't know if I was totally
loose when I went in," Weiss said.
'Tve just been working on throw
ing strikes — that's the key to
success. You see guys like Stan
Spencer out there, and that's what
they're doing."

"Scott did a great job," Mar
quess said. "He came in when they
were rolling and shut 'em down."
"That was the best I've
thrown," said Weiss, who allowed
only three hits. "It's the midway
point of the season, and I've been
getting progressively better. I
can't stop there, though."
With the Bruins muzzled, the
Cardinal scratched back from a
6-3 deficit. Ryan Turner got one
run back with his first career
homer — "It's about fu--ing
time!" Paul Carey said after the
game — in the fourth, and then,
