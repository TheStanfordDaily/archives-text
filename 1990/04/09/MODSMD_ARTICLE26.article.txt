# Netters fend off tough southern foes

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - If you look
at a map of California you could
quickly determine that it is
about 400 miles from Stanford
to L.A. Just don't tell the wom
en's tennis team.
For the Cardinal, playing at
UCLA and USC has always
made the team feel at home. The
crowds tend to have a pretty
good number of Cardinal fans
and the team usually avoids the
hotel scene by staying with
friends.
No one was more comfortable
this weekend than freshman
Heather Willens, who hails from
Los Angeles. Willens played her
best tennis as a collegian to help
Stanford (20-0) down the na
tion's second- and fourth-ranked
teams in by far the most exciting
matches of the season.
Matched up with No. 2
(17-4) Friday, the Cardinal
found itself behind in four of

Women's Tennis

1 Cardinal 5 Bruins 4
I Cardinal 5 Trojans 1

the six singles matches early on
— including the top three. On
the back courts, though, Willens
was methodically downing vet
eran Stella Sampras 6-4, 6-4 to
put Stanford on the scoreboard.
Teri Whitlinger seemed to
handle Iwalani McCalla with rel
ative ease, 6-3, 6-3, but she was
not pleased with her play. "I was
definitely not on top of my game
today," Whilinger said. "This
match came at a really bad time
for us."
She explained that with the
way Stanford's schedule was set
up — a two-week layoff followed
by a pair of relatively easy
matches in San Diego last week
end — the Cardinal was not as
well prepared as it could have
been to face top competition.

Perhaps that had an effect on
Lisa Green and Sandra Birch.
Green dropped a 6-1, 0-6, 6-3
decision to Bruin freshman
Cammie Foley. In a replay of a
match played on the same court
last year, Jessica Emmons
defeated Sandra Birch 7-5, 6-1.
When Debbie Graham out
lasted Kirsten Dreyer 7-6 (7-4),
6-4, Stanford pushed ahead 3-2
in the team competition. If
Meredith McGrath could knock
off Mamie Ceniza, the Cardinal
could take a commanding lead.
But Ceniza was playing at a level
she had never achieved before
and captured the first set 6-4.
McGrath rebounded to take
the second set 7-5. Ceniza opened
the third by holding serve.
McGrath did the same to make
it 1-1. Five straight service
breaks ensued to give McGrath
a 4-3 lead. Everyone in the sta
dium — including the members
of both teams — were rapt in
attention.
Then, without warning,

Ceniza announced that she had
to default with a shoulder injury.
Instead of 3-3, the match was
4-2 and Ceniza — half of UCLA's
No. 1 doubles team — would be
on the sidelines.
McGrath and Whitlinger blew
by Sampras and Debbie LaFran
chi 6-1, 6-3 to wrap things up.
Birch-Graham and Willens-
Green were defeated, but Coach
Frank Brenan wasn't concerned.
"In the doubles, we would
have done what we had to do,
we would've had more zest," he
said. Of course, it was easy for
Brennan to be relaxed once
things were decided in Stan
ford's favor and the team's 56-
match winning streak was
preserved.
"I had the speech ready. 'All
streaks are made to be broken.' "
he said. "That was very scary.
But even with 3-3, I figured we
were going to be in good shape.
"We're definitely a little cocky.
• We've got to temper that with
'preparedness — mental and phys
ical. We have to be ready for any
thing, especially on the road."
Green, the Cardinal's captain,
was ready Saturday. She captured
jthe first nine games of her match
• with USC's Julie Tullberg in un
der half an hour. Before the
Trojans' No. 5 player could
recover, Green had an easy 6-0,
6-2 victory.
Because Marks Stadium has
only five courts, Willens had to
wait until a match was completed
before going on. Little did Linda
! All red, Willens* opponent, realize
how anxious Willens was.
Stanford's No. 6 player opened
with a break of Allred's serve and

summarily freight-trained her
way to a 6-0, 6-0 victory before
any of the other singles matches
were completed. For Willens, who
struggled earlier in the season,
the two wins were especially
sweet. "I felt really good this
weekend," she said. "I've started
to get my confidence . . . there's
not as much pressure."
She also was happy to be close
to home. "I always like it when
my dad is watching."
Willens suggested that the
layoff may have played a role in
the team's troubles. "All our
matches have been easy (to this
point)," she said. "We haven't
been challenged."
Still, Stanford was able to shake
off any rust in time to answer
the challenges. Though Birch fell
to Trisha Laux 7-5, 5-7, 6-1,
McGrath came up with another
heart-stopping victory to make

the match score 3-1.
After taking the first set from
Stephanie London 6-1, she lost
the second set 6-2. The third set
see-sawed until London broke
McGrath to move ahead 6-5. Serv
ing for the match, USC's No. 2
player moved ahead 30-0 before
McGrath answered with four
straight points to force the tie
breaker.
London jumped out to a 3-0
lead in the breaker. But McGrath
won seven of the next eight points
to win the tiebreaker 7-4 and cap
ture the match. "What a week
end," McGrath said, a bit
befuddled by her play. "I don't
know what it is. If anything, I've
been working harder."
She did find a bright side,
though. "I wasn't playing that
well but I won . . . That means a
lot. Everyone seemed to be strug
gling.

McGrath came up with another
heart-stopping victory to make

the match score 3-1.
After taking the first set from
Stephanie London 6-1, she lost
the second set 6-2. The third set
see-sawed until London broke
McGrath to move ahead 6-5. Serv
ing for the match, USC's No. 2
player moved ahead 30-0 before
McGrath answered with four
straight points to force the tie
breaker.
London jumped out to a 3-0
lead in the breaker. But McGrath
won seven of the next eight points
to win the tiebreaker 7-4 and cap
ture the match. "What a week
end," McGrath said, a bit
befuddled by her play. "I don't
know what it is. If anything, I've
been working harder."
She did find a bright side,
though. "I wasn't playing that
well but I won . . . That means a
lot. Everyone seemed to be strug
gling.
LOS ANGELES - If you look
at a map of California you could
quickly determine that it is
about 400 miles from Stanford
to L.A. Just don't tell the wom
en's tennis team.
For the Cardinal, playing at
UCLA and USC has always
made the team feel at home. The
crowds tend to have a pretty
good number of Cardinal fans
and the team usually avoids the
hotel scene by staying with
friends.
No one was more comfortable
this weekend than freshman
Heather Willens, who hails from
Los Angeles. Willens played her
best tennis as a collegian to help
Stanford (20-0) down the na
tion's second- and fourth-ranked
teams in by far the most exciting
matches of the season.
Matched up with No. 2
(17-4) Friday, the Cardinal
found itself behind in four of

Women's Tennis

1 Cardinal 5 Bruins 4
I Cardinal 5 Trojans 1

the six singles matches early on
— including the top three. On
the back courts, though, Willens
was methodically downing vet
eran Stella Sampras 6-4, 6-4 to
put Stanford on the scoreboard.
Teri Whitlinger seemed to
handle Iwalani McCalla with rel
ative ease, 6-3, 6-3, but she was
not pleased with her play. "I was
definitely not on top of my game
today," Whilinger said. "This
match came at a really bad time
for us."
She explained that with the
way Stanford's schedule was set
up — a two-week layoff followed
by a pair of relatively easy
matches in San Diego last week
end — the Cardinal was not as
well prepared as it could have
been to face top competition.

Perhaps that had an effect on
Lisa Green and Sandra Birch.
Green dropped a 6-1, 0-6, 6-3
decision to Bruin freshman
Cammie Foley. In a replay of a
match played on the same court
last year, Jessica Emmons
defeated Sandra Birch 7-5, 6-1.
When Debbie Graham out
lasted Kirsten Dreyer 7-6 (7-4),
6-4, Stanford pushed ahead 3-2
in the team competition. If
Meredith McGrath could knock
off Mamie Ceniza, the Cardinal
could take a commanding lead.
But Ceniza was playing at a level
she had never achieved before
and captured the first set 6-4.
McGrath rebounded to take
the second set 7-5. Ceniza opened
the third by holding serve.
McGrath did the same to make
it 1-1. Five straight service
breaks ensued to give McGrath
a 4-3 lead. Everyone in the sta
dium — including the members
of both teams — were rapt in
attention.
Then, without warning,

Ceniza announced that she had
to default with a shoulder injury.
Instead of 3-3, the match was
4-2 and Ceniza — half of UCLA's
No. 1 doubles team — would be
on the sidelines.
McGrath and Whitlinger blew
by Sampras and Debbie LaFran
chi 6-1, 6-3 to wrap things up.
Birch-Graham and Willens-
Green were defeated, but Coach
Frank Brenan wasn't concerned.
"In the doubles, we would
have done what we had to do,
we would've had more zest," he
said. Of course, it was easy for
Brennan to be relaxed once
things were decided in Stan
ford's favor and the team's 56-
match winning streak was
preserved.
"I had the speech ready. 'All
streaks are made to be broken.' "
he said. "That was very scary.
But even with 3-3, I figured we
were going to be in good shape.
"We're definitely a little cocky.
• We've got to temper that with
'preparedness — mental and phys
ical. We have to be ready for any
thing, especially on the road."
Green, the Cardinal's captain,
was ready Saturday. She captured
jthe first nine games of her match
• with USC's Julie Tullberg in un
der half an hour. Before the
Trojans' No. 5 player could
recover, Green had an easy 6-0,
6-2 victory.
Because Marks Stadium has
only five courts, Willens had to
wait until a match was completed
before going on. Little did Linda
! All red, Willens* opponent, realize
how anxious Willens was.
Stanford's No. 6 player opened
with a break of Allred's serve and

summarily freight-trained her
way to a 6-0, 6-0 victory before
any of the other singles matches
were completed. For Willens, who
struggled earlier in the season,
the two wins were especially
sweet. "I felt really good this
weekend," she said. "I've started
to get my confidence . . . there's
not as much pressure."
She also was happy to be close
to home. "I always like it when
my dad is watching."
Willens suggested that the
layoff may have played a role in
the team's troubles. "All our
matches have been easy (to this
point)," she said. "We haven't
been challenged."
Still, Stanford was able to shake
off any rust in time to answer
the challenges. Though Birch fell
to Trisha Laux 7-5, 5-7, 6-1,
McGrath came up with another
heart-stopping victory to make

the match score 3-1.
After taking the first set from
Stephanie London 6-1, she lost
the second set 6-2. The third set
see-sawed until London broke
McGrath to move ahead 6-5. Serv
