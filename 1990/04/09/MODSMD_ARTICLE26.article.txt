# Netters fend off tough southern foes

### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - If you look
at a map of California you could
quickly determine that it is
about 400 miles from Stanford
to L.A. Just don't tell the wom
en's tennis team.
For the Cardinal, playing at
UCLA and USC has always
made the team feel at home. The
crowds tend to have a pretty
good number of Cardinal fans
and the team usually avoids the
hotel scene by staying with
friends.
No one was more comfortable
this weekend than freshman
Heather Willens, who hails from
Los Angeles. Willens played her
best tennis as a collegian to help
Stanford (20-0) down the na
tion's second- and fourth-ranked
teams in by far the most exciting
matches of the season.
Matched up with No. 2
(17-4) Friday, the Cardinal
found itself behind in four of

the six singles matches early on
— including the top three. On
the back courts, though, Willens
was methodically downing vet
eran Stella Sampras 6-4, 6-4 to
put Stanford on the scoreboard.
Teri Whitlinger seemed to
handle Iwalani McCalla with rel
ative ease, 6-3, 6-3, but she was
not pleased with her play. "I was
definitely not on top of my game
today," Whilinger said. "This
match came at a really bad time
for us."
She explained that with the
way Stanford's schedule was set
up — a two-week layoff followed
by a pair of relatively easy
matches in San Diego last week
end — the Cardinal was not as
well prepared as it could have
been to face top competition.

Perhaps that had an effect on
Lisa Green and Sandra Birch.
Green dropped a 6-1, 0-6, 6-3
decision to Bruin freshman
Cammie Foley. In a replay of a
match played on the same court
last year, Jessica Emmons
defeated Sandra Birch 7-5, 6-1.
When Debbie Graham out
lasted Kirsten Dreyer 7-6 (7-4),
6-4, Stanford pushed ahead 3-2
in the team competition. If
Meredith McGrath could knock
off Mamie Ceniza, the Cardinal
could take a commanding lead.
But Ceniza was playing at a level
she had never achieved before
and captured the first set 6-4.
McGrath rebounded to take
the second set 7-5. Ceniza opened
the third by holding serve.
McGrath did the same to make
it 1-1. Five straight service
breaks ensued to give McGrath
a 4-3 lead. Everyone in the sta
dium — including the members
of both teams — were rapt in
attention.
Then, without warning,

Ceniza announced that she had
to default with a shoulder injury.
Instead of 3-3, the match was
4-2 and Ceniza — half of UCLA's
No. 1 doubles team — would be
on the sidelines.
McGrath and Whitlinger blew
by Sampras and Debbie LaFran
chi 6-1, 6-3 to wrap things up.
Birch-Graham and Willens-
Green were defeated, but Coach
Frank Brenan wasn't concerned.
"In the doubles, we would
have done what we had to do,
we would've had more zest," he
said. Of course, it was easy for
Brennan to be relaxed once
things were decided in Stan
ford's favor and the team's 56-
match winning streak was
preserved.
"I had the speech ready. 'All
streaks are made to be broken.' "
he said. "That was very scary.
But even with 3-3, I figured we
were going to be in good shape.
"We're definitely a little cocky.
