# Hot Hammonds breaks record
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
During the Stanford baseball
team's 9-7 victory over UCLA on
Saturday, freshman center fielder
Jeff Hammonds did something
rather ordinary. In the fifth in
ning, with Stanford losing 3-1
after Hammonds committed his
first error of the season to allow
a UCLA run to score the previous
inning, he stepped to the plate
and crushed Bruin pitcher Tim
Lindsay's 3-2 change-up over the
left field fence to put the Cardinal
back in front 4-3.
Hitting baseballs is a common
occurrence when Hammonds has
a bat in his hand. But because it
is so common, it has become ex
traordinary. By hitting that home
run, Hammonds tallied a hit in
his 29th consecutive game, break
ing the Stanford and Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division hit
ting streak record of teammate
Troy Paulsen.
Hitting a baseball moving 90
miles per hour is no easy feat;
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
thinks it's "one of the most dif
ficult things in sport to do." Get
ting a hit in 29 consecutive games
is, simply, incredible.
"It's a hard thing to hit a base
ball," Hammonds said on Satur
day. "But it's something that each
player expects from each ot
her. . . I don't see any reason why
you can't hit the ball once out of
every four at-bats."
That reflects Hammonds'
strength as a hitter: a simple
refusal to acknowledge the
reasons why he, or at least an
ordinary baseball player,
shouldn't be able to accomplish
what he has.
When Hammonds stepped to
the plate in the fifth inning Sat
urday, he forgot he was a fresh
man who wasn't supposed to be
able to hit college pitchers. He
refused to believe that freshmen
get rattled after committing cru
cial errors.
He didn't seemed bothered
about the potential record
breaking hit, against Arizona
State on March 5, which was nul
lified when the game was called
because of darkness.
Hammonds didn't consider how
lucky he was to get a hit on Friday
to keep the streak alive. He
seemed to forget about his first
three hitless at-bats Friday and
the 3-0 count he faced in the
seventh inning when he whacked
a high outside fastball, certainly
ball four, into right field to tie
the record.
Whether it's God or skill or just
plain dumb luck, Hammonds pos
sesses a record that few in base
ball can match. Joe DiMaggio hit
in 56 straight games, the mgyor
league record, and Oklahoma
State's Robin Ventura holds the
collegiate record at 58. Both are
legendary records.

But those records only reaffirm
the accomplishment of Ham
monds' record. Consider the
physics of hitting a baseball, as
examined by Yale University Ster
ling Professor of Physics and
Physicist to the National League
Robert Kemp Adair.
A fastball thrown at 90 miles
per hour takes approximately .46
seconds to travel the 60 feet, 6
inches from the mound to home
plate. In that half second, the bat
ter must decide to take the pitch
or to swing.
Hammonds has faced these
odds at least three times in each
of the last thirty games, including
Sunday's game when he extended
the streak by going 3-for-5, and
beat them. During any one of his
succesful at-bats, he could have
struck out or swung that hun
dredth of a second too late.
But for thirty games in a row,
he hasn't.
That's extraordinary.
