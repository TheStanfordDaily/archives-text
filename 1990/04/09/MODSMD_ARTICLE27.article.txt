# Hot Hammonds breaks record
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
During the Stanford baseball
team's 9-7 victory over UCLA on
Saturday, freshman center fielder
Jeff Hammonds did something
rather ordinary. In the fifth in
ning, with Stanford losing 3-1
after Hammonds committed his
first error of the season to allow
a UCLA run to score the previous
inning, he stepped to the plate
and crushed Bruin pitcher Tim
Lindsay's 3-2 change-up over the
left field fence to put the Cardinal
back in front 4-3.
Hitting baseballs is a common
occurrence when Hammonds has
a bat in his hand. But because it
is so common, it has become ex
traordinary. By hitting that home
run, Hammonds tallied a hit in
his 29th consecutive game, break
ing the Stanford and Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division hit
ting streak record of teammate
Troy Paulsen.
Hitting a baseball moving 90
miles per hour is no easy feat;
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
thinks it's "one of the most dif
ficult things in sport to do." Get
ting a hit in 29 consecutive games
is, simply, incredible.
"It's a hard thing to hit a base
ball," Hammonds said on Satur
day. "But it's something that each
player expects from each ot
her. . . I don't see any reason why
you can't hit the ball once out of
every four at-bats."
That reflects Hammonds'
strength as a hitter: a simple
refusal to acknowledge the
reasons why he, or at least an
ordinary baseball player,
shouldn't be able to accomplish
what he has.
When Hammonds stepped to
the plate in the fifth inning Sat
urday, he forgot he was a fresh
man who wasn't supposed to be
able to hit college pitchers. He
refused to believe that freshmen
get rattled after committing cru
cial errors.
He didn't seemed bothered
about the potential record
breaking hit, against Arizona
