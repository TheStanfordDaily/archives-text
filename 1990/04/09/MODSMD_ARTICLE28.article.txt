# Golfers turning to bikes after ninth place finish
## 
### Brian W. Webber Staff writer 
After posting a ninth-place
finish in this weekend's Fresno
Classic, the men's golf team is
preparing to embark on its ver
sion of a "Tour de Stanford."
In the coming weeks, the Car
dinal linksters will put many
miles on exercise bikes in the
hopes of improving their aerobic
conditioning. The squad's lack of
physical stamina became painfully
obvious in Fresno and appears to
be the team's lone significant
deficiency.
The tournament format con
sisted of successive 18-hole rounds
on Friday, with a single round of
competition on Saturday. Friday's
36 holes proved excessively gruel
ing for the Cardinal, who saw a
top-10 morning standing evapor
ate in afternoon play.
As his team struggled during
the final holes, Stanford coach
Wallv Goodwin witnessed the

latest demonstration of a middle
round lack of stamina which has
plagued his team throughout this
season.
"We seemed to fall apart at the
seams on Friday afternoon. It
doesn't look like we did anything
differently mechanically or with
swing technique, so it must be
conditioning," Goodwin said.
After Friday's woes, the Cardi
nal rebounded nicely to fire a final
round 303. The total, which was
among the lowest 18-hole scores
for the Fresno event, indicates the
team's capability when the team
does not exceed its physical
bounds.
Stanford's 911 team total was
46 strokes off the pace set by vic
torious host Fresno State.
The Cardinal was led by Marc
Funseth, who carded fine rounds
of 74-73-73 to tie for 11th indi
vidually. Goodwin appraised the
senior's performance as "one of
the finest tournaments Marc has
played for us in his career."
