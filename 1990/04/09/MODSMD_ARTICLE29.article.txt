# Injury mars weekend sweep
## Men roll over UCLA, USC but frosh star Stark reinjured 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
It was one of those pood news
bad news weekends for the Stan
ford men's tennis team.
Coach Dick Gould saw his team
clobber two of its toughest oppo
nents 5-1 but would have given
up both wins to have superstar
freshman Jared Palmer back in
the lineup.
Palmer, who has been recover
ing from knee surgery during the
past few months, was forced to
withdraw in the third set of his
No. 3 singles match against UCLA
because of problems with his
other knee. Palmer won the first
set against the Bruins' Fritz Ris
sell 6-4 but started having serious
trouble midway through the sec
ond. Unable to move with any
effectiveness, Palmer withdrew at
4-6, 6-2, 3-0.
Palmer's injury seriously af
fects Stanford's singles and dou
bles lineup. Palmer and classmate
Jonathan Stark play No. 1 dou
bles for the Cardinal and are

ranked second in the country by
the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate
Rankings.
Palmer will see a doctor today.
His future playing status will be
determined later this week.
According to Gould, Palmer's
injury put a damper on two other
wise superb performances over
the weekend.
On Friday, the top-ranked Car
dinal simply outclassed the
eighth-ranked Rruins.
At No.l singles. Stark pounded
Jason Netter 7-5, 6-1 with an ar
ray of aces and finesse volleys.
"Once (Stark) gets going on his
serve, there's no stopping him,"
Netter said. "I thought 1 played
a good first set, but in the second
he just plain overpowered me."
Alex O'Rrien came back from a
0-2 lead to clobber Mark Knowles

6- 3, 6-2 at No. 2 singles.
JefT Cathrall followed suit at
No. 4, downing Jason Sher 6-3,
7-5.
At No. 6 singles, Jason Yee won
in straight sets over Robbie Wen
dell, 6-4, 6-3. "I was really up for
this match," Yee said. "I started
off serving well. Everything kind
of fell into place after that."
Stanford clinched the match at
No. 5 singles in undoubtedly the
most dramatic match of the week
end. Stanford's Glenn Solomon
outlasted Bill Behrens in a
four-hour duel, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2.
With the entire stadium
crowded around court No. 5,
Solomon actually had a- match
(and dual meet) point at 6-5 in
the second-set tiebreaker.
Solomon served a ball which Be
hrens returned short. But, instead
of showing the consistency that
has become his trademark,
Solomon shanked a forehand into
the bottom of the net. Behrens
went on to win the next two points

and the tiebreaker.
"I just got a little tight,"
Solomon said. "The crowd was
there. The team was behind me.
I knew [with that point] I could
win the match for the team, and
I got a little tight. It happens."
In the third set, however,
Solomon left no doubt as to the
match's final outcome. In a match
that had featured no breaks in
the first two sets, Solomon re
corded one in the first game of
the third.
"I had b«en close to breaking
him the whole match," Solomon
said. "Then I finally got one in
the first game of the second. That
really made the difference."
On Saturday, Stanford went up
against USC, who had just beaten
second-ranked California the day

before.
The Trojans boast three Davis
Cup players from foreign coun
tries, the No. 4-ranked player in
the country, and one of the top
doubles teams in collegiate tennis.
But with Palmer out of the
lineup, the Cardinal stepped up
its play a notch, routing the
Trojans 5-1.
Stark, the No. 2-ranked player
in the country, was most impres
sive as he crushed the No. 4-
ranked player in the collegiate
tennis, Byron Black, 6-1, 6-3.
At No. 2 singles, O'Brien came
back from a rough first set to
down Mehdi Benyebka 3-6, 6-1,
6-2.
Cathrall blasted past Donny
Isaak at No. 3 singles 7-5, 7-6.
Cathrall came to the net a lot
more than usual in the match.
At No. 4 singles, Solomon fell
in a tight three-setter, 6-4, 1-6,
6-3. "He'll bounce back," Gould
said. "He always does."

Palmer will see a doctor today.
His future playing status will be
determined later this week.
According to Gould, Palmer's
injury put a damper on two other
wise superb performances over
the weekend.
On Friday, the top-ranked Car
dinal simply outclassed the
eighth-ranked Rruins.
At No.l singles. Stark pounded
Jason Netter 7-5, 6-1 with an ar
ray of aces and finesse volleys.
"Once (Stark) gets going on his
serve, there's no stopping him,"
Netter said. "I thought 1 played
a good first set, but in the second
he just plain overpowered me."
Alex O'Rrien came back from a
0-2 lead to clobber Mark Knowles

6- 3, 6-2 at No. 2 singles.
JefT Cathrall followed suit at
No. 4, downing Jason Sher 6-3,
7-5.
At No. 6 singles, Jason Yee won
in straight sets over Robbie Wen
dell, 6-4, 6-3. "I was really up for
this match," Yee said. "I started
off serving well. Everything kind
of fell into place after that."
Stanford clinched the match at
No. 5 singles in undoubtedly the
most dramatic match of the week
end. Stanford's Glenn Solomon
outlasted Bill Behrens in a
four-hour duel, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2.
With the entire stadium
crowded around court No. 5,
Solomon actually had a- match
(and dual meet) point at 6-5 in
the second-set tiebreaker.
Solomon served a ball which Be
hrens returned short. But, instead
of showing the consistency that
has become his trademark,
Solomon shanked a forehand into
the bottom of the net. Behrens
went on to win the next two points

Junior Glenn Solomon's four-hour, three-set victory over UCLA's Bill Behrens at No. 5 singles clinched
No. 1 ranked Stanford's 5-1 win on Friday.
and the tiebreaker.
"I just got a little tight,"
Solomon said. "The crowd was
there. The team was behind me.
I knew [with that point] I could
win the match for the team, and
I got a little tight. It happens."
In the third set, however,
Solomon left no doubt as to the
match's final outcome. In a match
that had featured no breaks in
the first two sets, Solomon re
corded one in the first game of
the third.
"I had b«en close to breaking
him the whole match," Solomon
said. "Then I finally got one in
the first game of the second. That
really made the difference."
On Saturday, Stanford went up
against USC, who had just beaten
second-ranked California the day

before.
The Trojans boast three Davis
Cup players from foreign coun
tries, the No. 4-ranked player in
the country, and one of the top
doubles teams in collegiate tennis.
But with Palmer out of the
lineup, the Cardinal stepped up
its play a notch, routing the
Trojans 5-1.
Stark, the No. 2-ranked player
in the country, was most impres
sive as he crushed the No. 4-
ranked player in the collegiate
tennis, Byron Black, 6-1, 6-3.
At No. 2 singles, O'Brien came
back from a rough first set to
down Mehdi Benyebka 3-6, 6-1,
6-2.
Cathrall blasted past Donny
Isaak at No. 3 singles 7-5, 7-6.
Cathrall came to the net a lot
more than usual in the match.
At No. 4 singles, Solomon fell
in a tight three-setter, 6-4, 1-6,
6-3. "He'll bounce back," Gould
said. "He always does."
