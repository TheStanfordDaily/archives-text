# Measles epidemic spreads
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Amid a statewide measles
epidemic that has caused 16
deaths already this year, Cowell
Student Health Center and county
health officials are recommending
that the majority of the student
body be vaccinated â€” even if they
have been once before.
In addition, members of next
year's freshman class will be re
quired to have been vaccinated in
the lust 10 year 6.
Although the outbreak has
largely affected unvaccinated
preschool-age children, including
one child of a Stanford graduate
student, health officials believe
those born since 1958 are at risk
of catching and spreading the
highly contagious disease even if
they have been previously vac
cinated. Officials now question
the validity of all immunizations
administered before 1980.
In Oakland, more than *200
cases of measles have been re
ported in the last six months,
compared to three cases in all of
Alameda County in 1988. County
officials declared a public health
emergency last Tuesday in order
to apply for special state funds.
Monterey and Santa Cruz
counties followed suit on Wednes
day, and San Francisco and Santa
Clara County officials are contem
plating declaring emergencies in
coming weeks.
According to Dr. Randy Bergen,
fellow in Pediatric Infectious Dis
eases at the Medical Center, "there
certainly is a risk" of a measles
epidemic at Stanford because "the
college-age population is at
greater risk of infection" than the
general population or even today's
school-age children born after
1980.
