# Measles epidemic spreads
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Amid a statewide measles
epidemic that has caused 16
deaths already this year, Cowell
Student Health Center and county
health officials are recommending
that the majority of the student
body be vaccinated — even if they
have been once before.
In addition, members of next
year's freshman class will be re
quired to have been vaccinated in
the lust 10 year 6.
Although the outbreak has
largely affected unvaccinated
preschool-age children, including
one child of a Stanford graduate
student, health officials believe
those born since 1958 are at risk
of catching and spreading the
highly contagious disease even if
they have been previously vac
cinated. Officials now question
the validity of all immunizations
administered before 1980.
In Oakland, more than *200
cases of measles have been re
ported in the last six months,
compared to three cases in all of
Alameda County in 1988. County
officials declared a public health
emergency last Tuesday in order
to apply for special state funds.
Monterey and Santa Cruz
counties followed suit on Wednes
day, and San Francisco and Santa
Clara County officials are contem
plating declaring emergencies in
coming weeks.
According to Dr. Randy Bergen,
fellow in Pediatric Infectious Dis
eases at the Medical Center, "there
certainly is a risk" of a measles
epidemic at Stanford because "the
college-age population is at
greater risk of infection" than the
general population or even today's
school-age children born after
1980.
"Measles can be a very devas
tating infection. If I were a college
student, I would want the best
possible chance of being
protected," Bergen said. He added
that last fall there was a "pretty
bad epidemic" at USC, in which
public health measures were in
stituted.
Meanwhile, Cowell is taking
measures to safeguard against a
measles epidemic at Stanford. Ac
cording to John Dorman, director
of public relations for Cowell, "We
don't think it's a serious problem,
but we are taking precautions."
Dorman said that no Stanford
student has caught measles in the
last 10 years, but Cowell will
"strongly recommend" this month
that all students under age 33 be
vaccinated.
The vaccine is available at
Cowell for $25, which Dorman
emphasized is being provided at
cost.
In addition, the current require
ment that entering students prove

'Measles can be a very devastating infection.
If I were a college student, I would want the
best possible chance of being protected.'

that they have once been vac
cinated against measles will be
tightened beginning with next
fall's freshman class. Incoming
students will need to have been
vaccinated since 1979, Dorman
said.
He added that although it is
not now cost-effective to require
all current students to be vac
cinated a second time, a rapid
spread of measles among the
Stanford population might change
Co well's policy.
"We recommend that students
get the second immunization,"
said Laura Levin of the Immuni
zation Assistance Program of the
Santa Clara County Health De
partment. According to Levin, stu
dents who do not carry antibodies
will be highly susceptible to catch
ing measles and very likely trans
mit the virus to others who do
not carry antibodies.

Measles, also known as rubeola
or 10-day measles, results in a
fever and body-covering rash, but
can lead to meningitis or pneu
monia, which are potentially fatal.
Bergen said administration of
the measles vaccine during in
fancy became standard practice in
1963, so it is unlikely that those
born between 1957 and 1963 are
immune to measles. Health offi
cials believe that people born be
tween 1963 and 1967 are the next
most vulnerable group because
the vaccine used during those
years was not a live vaccine.
Levin estimated that 95 percent
of the college-age population cur
rently carries antibodies to the
measles virus, but testing for
measles antibodies would be
equally as expensive and time
consuming as a second vaccina
tion.
