# Strikers warm-up for show-time

### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES â€” Opening day
has arrived for the Stanford men's
volleyball team.
Much like the 26 major league
baseball teams, the Cardinal
played a pair of exhibitions over
the weekend in an effort to get
ready for tonight's contest at Pep
perdine. Stanford is currently bat
tling Hawaii for the third and
final playoff spot in the Wilson
Division and needs to win all three
remaining league games to clinch
the berth.
Begining with a match at the
ninth-ranked Waves tonight,
Stanford knows it's time to pull
out all the stops. "Monday's a big
game for us," Cardinal Coach
Fred Sturm said. "It's a big game
for both teams. ... I'm really in
terested to see how we play. We're
in a position where we can get
some momentum."
Stanford went a long way
toward gaining some momentum
Saturday, defeating lOth-ranked
UC-Santa Barbara 12-15, 15-9,
15-13, 15-12 in the consolation
game of the UCLA Diet Pepsi Col
legiate Volleyball Classic. Stan
ford, now 10-6 overall, lost 15-5,
15-10, 15-11 to USC in the semi
finals of the four-team tourna
ment at Pauley Pavilion Friday

night. The second-ranked Trojans
upset No. 1 UCLA to win the
tourney title.
The two non-league matches
gave Sturm a chance to juggle his
lineup and the result was a few
pleasant surprises. Freshman set
ter Jimmy Blackman started both
matches for his first collegiate ac
tion and fared well. The Cardinal's
starting setter, Parker Blackman,
did not travel to the tournament,
as he is still suffering from a
spiained ankle incurred two
weeks ago. However, Parker
Blackman will join the team
before tonight's match.
"For Jimmy we used three dif
ferent systems in two nights,"
Sturm said. "He did a pretty good
job of keeping track of who was
where. ... I have a lot of confi
dence in him."
"I was really nervous at first,"
Blackman said. "But when I have
guys around me as good as my
teammates, it makes my job easy."
Sophomore Adam Keefe also re
ceived a lot of playing time. With
Stanford's two middle blockers,
Dan Hanan and Craig Forsyth,
both having terrific seasons, there
appeared to be little room for
Keefe in the lineup. But he started
alongside those two in the USC
match after Hanan was switched
to an outside hitter spot.
Stanford had problems siding

out against the Trojans all night
with the new lineup, however, and
USC hit .444 for the match Fri
day. Although, Hanan played out
of position in the first two games,
he had a match-high 26 kills, and
Keefe added 14 for the Cardinal.
For the Trojans, middle blocker
Kevin Shepard had 13 kills and
an .813 hitting percentage and his
counterpart in the middle, Chris
Underwood, hit .583.
Stanford rebounded the next
night, however. With regular
starters Forsyth and Dave Goss
both sitting out the entire match,
Keefe and sophomore Bob Hill
man led the Cardinal to victory.
While Hanan had his customary
22 kills and .375 hitting percent
age, Keefe tied his career best
with 18 kills, and the 6-foot Hill
man added 19 kills and six blocks.
"I thought we played well,"
Hillman said. "Not spectacularly
well but well enough to win. . . .
I thought I played maybe an
above-average match. I felt good
out there and confident. I felt I
got the job done, which is good
because I haven't always done
that starting."
The Cardinal had some prob
lems early against the Gauchos
but evened out to take the second
game. After that game, however,
Sturm inserted outside hitters
Ryan Moos and Mike Lowe for

last year's NCAA Freshman of the
Year, Duncan Blackman, and
John Alstrom. The move worked
as Moos scored several points with
his jump serve and notched 11
kills and a .368 hitting percentage.
Lowe also helped out with five

digs and a stuff block.
"I felt good that I finally got a
chance to show what I can do,"
Moos said. "What 1 think it shows
is the starting spots are really
close. Dan Hanan has a solid
starting spot. After that. . . That's

what makes the team so good is
the competition for those spots."
"[UCSB] is a good win for us
to have," Hillman said, "especially
after losing the first game ... I
think we're in a good position to
beat Pepperdine."
