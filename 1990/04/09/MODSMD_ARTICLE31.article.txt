# Figley hoping to birdie way to pro links
## 
### Aden Fine 
As a young girl, growing up in
a house across the street from a
golf course, Jody Figley dreamt
that one day she would play on
the professional golf tour.
And though that dream may
have seemed distant in the past,
and is still a far way off in the
future, it seems to he becoming
closer to reality each time Figley
steps on a golf course.
"I'm still hoping to become a
professional player," she said.
"It's always been my goal and I'm
confident I'll make it."
Coming out of high school,
Figley, who is now a junior, had
reason to be confident about her
future. After all, she was a first
team All- America her senior year
in high school and made the sec
ond team the two previous years.
In her freshman year of college,
Figley continued this success,
playing "the best golf of my
1 Figley's) life." In fact, in the ten
tournaments inwhich she com
peted, Figley finished in the top
10 an amazing seven times, earn
ing her Honorable Mention All-
American honors.
But however good the rest of
the season was, she saved her best
for last, finishing thirteenth in
the individual competition at the
NCAA championships. "That was
probably one of the most memo
rable golf experience I've ever
had," she commented.

Inspired by her frosh perform
ance, Figley was hopeful for an
even bigger year as a sophomore,
but things didn't quite work out.
"Last year I had really high ex
pectations going into the season,
so when I didn't play too well, I
was pretty disappointed," she
said.
Figley's lack of success carried
over into the beginning of this
year, but she has since turned her
game around and is regaining the
form that made her so successful.
"I'm really pleased with how I'm
playing right now. My swing feels
good and I'm comfortable with it."
Indeed, despite the poor start,
Figley has improved to the point
where she is now ranked No. 43
in the country, and with three
tournaments left before the
NCAAs, she has a good opportu
nity to move up even higher.
No one, including Figley and
Coach Tim Baldwin, can really ex
plain what caused the turn-

around, but everyone believes it
is Figley's work ethic that has
always made her so successful.
"She practices very intensely to
perfect her swing, and it has
shown. She just has a large, large
heart, and that's what makes her
a special person," Baldwin ex
plained.
Teammate Audrey Wooding
added, "She's really determined,
is a hard worker and is dedicated
to her game. We all learn from
her not by words, but from her
example of hard work."
However, Figley feels she needs
to put in even more work. "I'm
out here (on the driving range)
about three hours a day, but I
should be out here at least four
hours."
The reason she can't spend any
more time with golf is that she
spends a lot of time with her
schoolwork. As teammate Steph
anie Davis explained, "You can
usually find Jody at one of three

places: the driving range, the
phone or in the library."
Figley, who is majoring in
Human Biology, is especially ex
cited and hopeful that she has a
chance to be named an Academic
All-America this year, and she
said this honor would rank right
up there with any of her honors
from golf.
Her dream, however, is still to
be a member of the professional
golf tour, and last year she got a
huge taste of what it is like by
qualifying for the U.S. Open golf
tournament. One of only 33
amateurs in the country to be in
the event, she played very well
and missed the cut by only five
shots.
And even more exciting news is
that (the qualification) was last
year — when Figley was not play
ing her best. Now that she seems
to have gotten her game together,
she figures to fare even better on
her quest to make a dream be
come reality.
