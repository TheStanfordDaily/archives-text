# 5th ranked gymnasts miss qualifying

### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Murphy's Law states that on
some days everything that can go
wrong will. Unfortunately, Satur
day was one of those days for the
Stanford men's gymnastics team.
The squad entered the Western
Regional meet ranked fifth in the
nation and almost guaranteed a
trip to the NCAA Championships.
With a new rule only allowing the
top four finishers from each re
gional meet to go on to the na
tional competition, however, the
team's fate hinged on a single ef
fort. In the end, Stanford finished
this meet in fifth place, missing
the necessary fourth spot by a
mere 0.65 points.
New Mexico, ranked 11th in the
nation going into the meet,
snagged fourth behind Nebraska,
Oklahoma and UCLA. The Car
dinal was not completely shut out,
as seniors Charles Loop and Con
rad Voorsanger and freshman Jair

Lynch each earned individual
spots in the championships that
will take place in two weeks.
This did not prove to be much
consolation, however. "The whole
thing is a team event," Lynch said.
"It's no fun going to NCAA's by
yourself."
Loop agreed. "It was pretty
much the worst meet ever," be
said. "But on the positive side,
nobody ever gave up. After four
events we were in sixth place, and
we managed to come back to
within a fraction of a point of
fourth."
Stanford's first two events,
vault and parallel bars, passed
without incident. It was the high
bar, traditionally the team's
strongest event, that began a
negative chain reaction. Five out
of th£" six routines weri* rrhsSecl,
and this trend continued on floor.
In fact, ten of the thirty routines
that were counted towards the
team's all-around score were clas

sified as misses by Lynch.
"If we had just had a normal meet,
we could easily have gotten sec
ond. But with so many mistakes,
there was no way we could do it,"
he said.
According to junior Tim Wang,
the competition was both physi
cally and mentally draining. "We
tried to keep our morale high, but
it was hard because we had a bye
after each event. We would watch
the other teams, and I think we
just got psyched out," he said.
"Before each event we would have
to get warmed up all over again."
The meet did have a few posi
tive aspects, however. For the
younger members of the team, it
provided an experience with in
tense competition under pressure.
Lynch emerged from this compe
"titicm"with anTfnpfysSrfce* fourth
place all-around finish, and both
seniors will have a chance to end
their collegiate careers with an
NCAA Championship appearance.
