# Card crew squads find direction
## Strong finish for women, slow men's race show shortcomings 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
In a weekend marred by wrecks the Stanford
crew teams learned something about their direction.
r l L n Crew Classic brings together some
of the best rowing talent in the country, and when
the smoke had cleared, both the men's and the
women's teams had better ideas of what they would
have to do to be competitive this season.
Despite some crashing, and being crashed into
the women's team had a strong showing. The second
novice boat provided Stanford's only victory of the
day, and after being hit by the UCLA boat, the
first novice finished third. The Junior Varsity boat
followed the novice lead, crashing into a buoy and
also finishing third. The Varsity managed to stay
out of the way of stray objects and brought home
the team's third third-place finish of the day. Coach
John Davis was pleased with these early season
results.
We are pretty happy about our races. The kids
looked good, the attitudes were good, and the kids
pulled hard," Davis said.
"The Varsity raced like champs, they just don't
have any speed yet. Being the smallest crew in the
final and coming in third is not bad."
It's even better when one considers the path they
took to get there. Saturday morning found the
Cardinal in a heat with defending Pacific 10 Con
ference Champions Washington, and the Huskies
pushed Stanford to the limit. It was a "two boat"
race according to Davis, with Stanford coming back
to win by a second and a half.
"We came from behind and rowed them down,"
Davis said. "Not many people can do that to Wash

ington.
The final turned out to be a different story. Even
though the Cardinal jumped off the line strong and
took the early lead, they could not maintain their
position and took third behind California and UCLA.
"We rowed a real good race. We took the lead
right off, but Cal and UCLA are just better than
us," Davis said. "UCLA is very strong. They average
over six feet; they looked more like our basketball
team."
After Saturday's heat, the Stanford men's team
probably wished that they could have looked like
the basketball team, or at least had the same kind
of success. Knowing that they had to row strongly
to get into the grand final, the Cardinal nevertheless
came off the line slowly and found themselves play
ing catch-up the rest of the way. Stanford wound
up fifth and were relegated to the petite final where
they finished third.
"We had tough, tough competition in the heat
and just didn't row that well," coxswain Quinn
Bolton said. I don't think we were warm at the
line. We only got out at 37 or 38 strokes per minute,
which is really slow."
"We had a disappointing weekend," Captain Andy
Winden said. "We haven't really jelled as a boat yet,
but that is no surprise since it is so early in the
season. Our start was really slow in the morning
so we couldn't get it going. In the afternoon we
sped up relative to the competition."
The other men's boats fared a little better. The
freshman boat came in second, the novice came in
third as did the J.V. The latter race was particularly
exciting. After crashing during warm-ups, the J.V
came back in the sprint and made up six seats to
beat out UCLA for third.
