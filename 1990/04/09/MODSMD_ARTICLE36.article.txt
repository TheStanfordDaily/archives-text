# Stanford tears up Texas Relays
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
The men's and women's track
and field teams were kept pretty
busy in their first week of
Spring Quarter. In addition to
Saturday's meet at Sonoma
State, 21 of Stanford's best com
peted at the prestigious Texas
Relays in Austin. After squaring
off against some of the most
powerful teams and individuals
in the nation, the Cardinal has
found that it can hold its own
among them.
"We showed what we can do
on a really competitive level. ..
national caliber," said junior
Jennifer Jauquet. "Now we
know where we stand and what
we need to work on."
So what can they do? Where
do they stand? Take a gander
at some of these results:
Sophomore Chryste Gaines
finished second in the 100-
meters with an 11.31 time â€”
bettering her previous personal
record by a considerable .13
seconds. This is also currently
the second-fastest time recorded
in the NCAA so far this year.
It's even more impressive that
she did it in weather that she
described as "awful cold."

The men's distance medley
relay tearh recorded the fastest
time in the NCAA this year in
winning that event. Half of that
team also participated in the
four by 1500-meters, which
placed second.
"I expect that the four by 15
will remain the second best in
the nation by the end of the
year," assistant coach Scott
Chisam said. "The distance
medley time will probably be
second or third," he added.
Junior Marcus Hickerson
achieved his primary goal of
making the finals in the long
jump. He ended up with seventh
place out of more than 40
jumpers with a personal record
jump of 25-foot- 5 1/2.
Despite his success, Hicker
son knows he has potential to
jump much farther. "I wasn't
fast on the runway," he said. "I
was probably the slowest person
in the finals." He commented
that once he improved his speed,
he should be able to surpass
California's jumpers at Big Meet
on April 28. The distance re
quired to accomplish that feat
would also send him to the
NCAA's.
Senior Brian Boggess made
the finals in the shot put, plac

ing sixth in that event, with a
distance of 58-foot-8.
"There were some bad dudes
in that final," Chisam said,
"some really tough guys, and
Brian hung in there."
Junior Melanie Bloch took
third place in the 1500-meters
and equalled her personal
record. She was locked in a bat
tle for second place when, in
Chisam's words, her opponent
"decked Melanie at the finish."
Jauquet qualified for the
Pacific 10 Conference meet in
the heptathlon, and senior
Peggy Odita qualified for
NCAA's in the same event.
Debbie Malueg, a junior, re
corded a personal record in the
shot put, and sophomore Fred
Carter captured seventh place
in the 3000-meter steeplechase.
Meanwhile, at a less famous
meet in Sonoma on Saturday,
over 40 Cardinal runners rep
resented Stanford as they
"dominated in just about every
event," according to Chisam.
"This has been a tremendous
weekend," he said. "Two years
ago we sent eight people to
Texas and less than 20 to
Fresno. This year we sent 21 to
Texas and 40 to Sonoma."
