# Boston U. prof.:
## Intellectual variety obstructs black unity 
### Heidi Durrow 
After surveying the argu
ments of many black intellec
tuals, the director of the
Afro-American Studies Depart
ment of Boston University re
solved that there are "many
varieties of Africanity" that
obstruct progress toward black
unity.
As part of a special series
presented by the Program in
African and Afro-American
Studies, Prof. Wilson Jeremiah
Moses gave a lecture Thursday
night entitled "Founding the
American Negro Academy:
Idealism, Materialism and
Hero Worship."
Moses briefly discussed the
background and childhood of
such figures as W.E.B. Dußois,
Booker T. Washington and Al
exander Crummell, and he ex
plained how each man's
perception of Africanity was af
fected by his past.
Washington, Moses ex
plained, believed that "slavery

had been a school" and that
black people, as Christians, had
improved themselves by
leaving behind a heathen past.
Crummell, however, consid
ered black American culture
the greatest enemy of black
people and thought that what
black people had in Africa was
more useful, Moses added.
Moses concluded that it is
necessary to ask: "Whose
Afrocentrism?" when talking
about Afrocentrism.
In response to a question,
Moses said, "One of the prob
lems I think that we often have
when we talk about the whole
question of black unity is that
people come into a situation
with so many different back
grounds."
Moses questioned whether
people are "talking about the
same culture" when discussing
blacks from different back
grounds. "We often say this is
the time of year we will cele
brate our culture, rather than
our cultures," he said.
