# Palo Alto reverend decries death penalty
## 
### Mark Lewis 
Although the Death Row case of Robert
Alton Harris is fading from public view since
his March 30 stay of execution, the Rev. Joe
Doss has not given up his fight to end the
death penalty.
Doss spoke against capital punishment
Thursday night to a group of 30 people in
Loro lounge. Calling modern society a pro
ducer of violence, Doss told the group that
the continuing existence of the death penalty
is American society's "absolute symbol that
violence is the solution."
Doss is the rector of St. Mark's Episcopal
Church in Palo Alto and the president of
Death Penalty Focus, a social action group
that opposes capital punishment.
In the discussion, sponsored by the Stanford
chapter of Amnesty International, Doss drew
on his wide experience as a pastor, his knowl
edge of jurisprudence and his work with de
fense attorney Julian Murray in the Death
Row case of Earnest Knighton. Knighton was
executed in Louisiana in 1984.
While Doss, like many others, argues

against the justice and moral utility of the
death penalty, his point of view is unique due
to his experience counseling families of violent
crime victims in Louisiana.
According to Doss, a penal system which
implements the death penalty only offers the
family continued hate and grief, not reconcil
iation to the tragedy they have undergone.
Doss also led a caustic attack on politicians'
manipulation of the death penalty issue to
gain votes. Many media polls, according to
Doss, mislead the public because they do not
adequately specify who should be executed or
in which criminal situations.
He said he believes polls are actually in
tended to find out what the public wishes
would happen in an unspecified death penalty
case. He speculated that the politician's
scheme is to tell the individual, "I can help
convince you that your wish isn't a lie and
it can be lived out."
Doss criticized two polls conducted this year
by an organization led by Merwin Fields. One
poll, directed by Fields himself, was conducted
for Republican Sen. Pete Wilson. Doss said
the 80 percent support for the capital pun

ishment found in that poll led Fields to tell
The New York Times that "California wants
the death penalty in any circumstances."
When Doss' organization, Death Penalty
Focus, had Fields' staff conduct a poll with
more explicit qualifications, it showed that
only 26 percent of Californians supported cap
ital punishment. But the higher percentage is
still used by Wilson, according to Doss. "The
pollsters and politicians are in bed," Doss
declared.
Referring to the religious belief in the
"sanctity of life" and the Judeo-Christian tra
dition of forgiveness, Doss stated that the
death penalty ensures a continued cycle of
violence and hatred, not compassion or
rehabilitation.
Doss cited racial prejudice in death penalty
prosecution and sentencing as another exam
ple of the law's injustice. He argued that
although the U.S. Supreme Court knows that
a white jury is more likely to find a black
defendant guilty if the punishment is execu
tion, the Court rationalizes this and other
discrepancies along racial lines by saying, "We
live in a racist society, so what do you expect?"
