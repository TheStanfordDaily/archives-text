'Sleep Alert' broadcast tonight

and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. on channel 32, PBS
will broadcast a half-hour documentary entitled
"Sleep Alert," featuring Dr. William C. Dement,
director of Stanford's Sleep Disorders Clinic and
Research Center.
As many as 100 million Americans are in con
stant danger of falling asleep, with consequences

ing on many of the issues raised in the popular
"Sleep and Dreams" course Dememt taught last

H-Bomb could have been avoided,
Stanford history prof writes
Had a 1952 Soviet-American arms proposal
been accepted, "it might have spared the world
much of the horror of the hydrogen bomb era,"
History Prof. Barton Bernstein published re
cently in "International Security."
According to Bernstein, while scientists were
preparing to test the thermonuclear process that
would power the H-bomb, a five-person Panel of
Consultants on Disarmament recommended that
the United States negotiate with the Soviet Union
to ban all such tests.
The Soviets may have accepted the proposal,
Bernstein writes, because they lagged behind the
United States in H-bomb research. But because

the Truman administration and the American
public believed negotiations with the Soviet
Union were impossible, the proposal never even
reached the president.
