# Yearlong Stanford study:
## Lesbian women lack community 
### Minal Hajratwala Staff writer 
After more than a year of interviews
with students, faculty and administra
tors, Stanford's first assessment of the
needs of lesbian and bisexual women
students has been released.
The study discussed oppressive fac
tors in Stanford's sociopolitical environ
ment, evaluated existing community
and mental health resources and made
various recommendations.
According to the study, the greatest
problem for lesbian and bisexual wom
en, in contrast to gay males, is a lack
of community. Ethnic minority and
graduate students face similar prob
lems.
Because the needs assessment was
issued in the midst of an overhaul of
the Dean of Student Affairs Office, it
is too early to know how and when the
report's recommendations will be imple
mented, according to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Jackson.
The report, released last month, was
commissioned by Counseling and Psy

chological Services in January 1989 to
examine why lesbian and bisexual
women often fail to take advantage of
services offered by various campus or
ganizations.
"[The survey] was necessary because
there is a danger that underuse will be
interpreted as lack of need," said Trudie
Heming, the CAPS consultant who con
ducted the study.
Heming presented her preliminary
findings Feb. 22 as part of the Gaia
Women's Health Lecture Series, and the
study's recommendations were finalized
last month.
Originally limited to mental health
needs, the study's scope was expanded
when Heming realized that no data was
available, not even an estimate of how
many lesbian and bisexual women stu
dents are at Stanford. She interviewed
"key informants" to get a picture of
what life on campus is like for lesbian
and bisexual women students.
Women's Center coordinator Teri Hop
per called the study accurate, saying,
"The lesbian community generally goes
unacknowledged on campus."

Specific recommendations for the im
provement and expansion of CAPS serv
ices are accompanied by general
recommendations such as respecting the
diversity of the group and maintaining
consistency of services.
The study also examines why past
efforts by campus organizations have
failed to create a comfortable commu
nity for lesbian and bisexual women.
Doug Daher, acting director of CAPS,
said CAPS is working to respond to the
needs assessment. A training program
for students in clinical psychiatry
specializing in gay, lesbian and bisexual
issues is being established, he said. The
program will run parallel to CAPS' gen
eral training for students, creating a
source of more consistent services for
the community.
The report's release coincides with
the formation of a campus social net
work for women called Beyond
Heterosexuality. The group currently
has 30 members, including graduate
and undergraduate students and staff
members and is funded in part by the
Women's Collective.
