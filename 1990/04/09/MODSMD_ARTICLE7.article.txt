# Lathrop now Muwekma-Tah-Ruk

### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Residents of the American Indian Theme House,
formerly known as Lathrop House, officially
renamed their home in the Ohlone Indian language
as Muwekma-Tah-Ruk at a program Saturday.
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk (pronounced "Moo-WAYK
muh Tah Rook") means "The House of the People"
in the language of the Ohlone, a tribe which has
existed for 10,000 years and has lived on what is
now Stanford land for 5,000 years.
Resident assistant Colin Hampson, who was
master of ceremonies at the program, said the name
change was "exciting for the house and the com
munity."
Hampson said residents have wanted to change

the name ever since Lathrop became the American
Indian Theme House two-and-a-half years ago. "The
time was right," he said, "to honor the people who
had lived on this land" before the University was
built.
Hampson said members of the Ohlone community
acquainted residents with the tribe's history, culture
and language. The tribe members advised the res
idents to form their own concept of what the house
meant to them before choosing a new name.
"Muwekma," Hampson said, not only means
"people," but also means "family and community,"
and encompasses many of the other name ideas the
residents had discussed, such as "welcome," "ex
tended hands," "tightly bound" and "nations coming
together." "Ruk" means "house,"
and "tah" roughly means "coming
together."
Rosemary Cambra, an Ohlone
woman who lives in the area,
thanked the residents for
"revitalizing" her language and
called the name change "a bless
ing my people will always remem
ber."
Arvol Lookinghorse, the spiri
tual leader of the Lakota Nation,

chair of the Stanford American
Indian Organization, commended
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk's sense of
family, saying it made Native
American students "feel
welcome." She said it is very im
portant for the Native American
community to be able to "live in
a house and feel we belong, but
also not live there and still feel
we belong."
