On-Campusjam Session
April 24, 1990
In PB2, in the court of Emperor Joseph 11, a brash
young composer named Wolfgang Amadeus Mo/art
set the music world on its ear. A radical departure
from the current fashion in music, he set a new stan
dard for style and composition.
It has always heen so. The old guard surpassed by a
new wave. It's true today in the area of Integrated
Circuit IX-sign Automation (ICDA) —software tools
used in the design and development of ICs and elec
tronic systems. Cadence broke with the conventional
order to create the industry's only completely open
and integrated ICDA software solution. Our high
performance tools are coordinated into one harmo
nious environment, allowing the user to arrange
the entire IC design process from design entry to
final verification
Our approach to integrating the IC design has made
Cadence the leader in ICDA software. And now we're
building on our expertise in IC design and expanding
our range to include a full line of products for the
overall Electronic Design Automation (EDA) market,
a much broader market than ICDA We arc a financially
secure, fully resourced company, and we're growing
at 80% a year—over three times as fast as the indus
try average. With the recent merger with Gateway
Design Automation Corporation, now called our Ad
vanced Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) Division,
we are able to challenge the top vendors in the systems
design software market And our new Advanced CAE
Division will continue to market the Verilog logic
simulation software products, bringing new strength
to our market penetration efforts in Europe and Japan
