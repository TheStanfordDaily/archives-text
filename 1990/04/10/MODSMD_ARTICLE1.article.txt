### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
A second upper-level Stanford admin
istrator has fallen victim to the Univer
sity's massive budget "repositioning."
Director of Operations and Mainte
nance Ralph Buchanan was fired last
week due to disagreements over budget
cuts with Su Schaffer, vice president for
administrative resources.
The first administrator, Director of
Human Resources Services Mary Moore,
quit her job shortly after a preliminary
budget cut of 30 percent was announced
for her department. Moore cited the
heavy demands that would be placed on
her time were she to stay on to lead the

budget-cutting effort.
Buchanan, in a memo
to Schaffer, noted that
Schaffer told him last
Tuesday that he "did not
have the abilities to lead
O & M through the
budget repositioning
process" and that it
would be "disruptive" for
him to stay on as direc
tor.

Buchanan was then given the choice of
resigning or being fired. At a meeting
last Thursday between Buchanan and
Schaffer, Buchanan refused to resign. He
was then told that he was fired "and
that was final," according to Buchanan's

Buchanan and Schaffer
clashed over budget
cutting plans. Then,
Buchanan was fired.

memo.
Buchanan asked Schaffer if he could
try to explain his plans for the budget
repositioning process, but he was only
allowed 15 minutes to do so, he said.
Buchanan wrote in the memo that his
dismissal "is certainly not in the best

interest of O & M or
Stanford" and that it
caused him "to seriously
question" Schaffer's
judgment and leadership
ability.
Buchanan's memo also
expressed dismay at
Schaffer's handling of his
termination. The memo
states that although Bu-

chanan was fired "in no uncertain terms"
by Schaffer, she told managers in Oper
ations and Maintenance that the terms
of Buchanan's departure were "still
open."
Schaffer said in an interview that
"nothing has been concluded" regarding

Buchanan's termination. She refused to
comment further.
Buchanan said in an interview that he
has 20 years of experience in physical
plant operations at universities and has
weathered budget troubles before. He
said he did not know of any reasons,
beyond Schaffer's belief that he was no
longer effective, which would explain his
dismissal.
Buchanan is scheduled to meet with
University President Donald Kennedy
today, between Kennedy's meetings with
the Board of Trustees, to discuss his
termination.
