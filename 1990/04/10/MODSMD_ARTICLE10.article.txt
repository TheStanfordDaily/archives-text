# Rush gets underway
## Organizers expect large turnout 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
The large audience at last
Thursday's Rush registration
meeting has led members of
the Greek community to an
ticipate a high turnout for this
year's fraternity Rush, which
started yesterday.
According to Interfraternity
Council Rush chair Erik Jor
gensen, more than 400 Rush
books were distributed at last
week's informational meeting
in Kresge Auditorium.
This is the first year that
men have been requested to
formally register for Rush, and
although registration is not
mandatory, it may account for

the strong turnout at the pre
sentation, according to Jorgen
sen.
Jorgensen also pointed to the
freshman outreach program
launched by the IFC and what
he called a current national
trend toward increased interest
in Greek organizations.
Fraternity Rush will con
tinue for three weeks, and the
first official Rush parties were
held last night. Throughout
Rush, parties will be held from
8 p.m. to midnight. During the
first week, only beer may be
served at parties; the second
week will be completely dry,
and during the third week both
beer and mixed drinks will be
permitted.
