# University tells students to clean up their act
## 
### Elizabeth Weiss Staff writer 
Spring cleaning is taking on added meaning
for 17 student-managed houses, as the Uni
versity has called for them to improve cleanli
ness levels following poor and mediocre
performances in health and safety inspections
last quarter.
But some students in those houses have
charged that the University is using too high
a standard for inspecting and that the dorms
have never been cleaner.
The results of the residence inspections,
indicated by scores on a five-point scale, "are
disappointing," said Asst. Dean of Residential
Affairs Jack Chin. He said that cleanliness in
self-cleaned residences is "expected to be on
the same level as University-run dormitories
would be."
Last week Chin and Pete Harvey, acting
manager of Row facilities, sent letters to the
student-cleaned houses, requesting immediate
improvement in residence cleanliness.

If cleaning does not improve
soon, the University will hire
professional cleaners to
scour some houses, leaving
residents with bills.

The letters encourage residents to accom
pany housing inspectors on house tours and
to contact the Row facilities office for clarifica
tion of the University's cleanliness standards.
According to the letters, if residence clean
ing does not improve soon, the University will
hire a professional cleaning service to scour
some houses, leaving residents with bills rang
ing from $150 to $575.
Harvey emphasized that the University
would "work with house managers" to im
prove cleaning procedures before contracting
outside service.
"We need to have the houses cleaned for

the residents' health and safety, but we prefer
that the students take responsibility for the
cleaning," said Harvey.
However, some residents fear their houses
will be unable to meet the University's cleanli
ness standards. Although Whitman House re
ceived only average marks during the
inspections, its residents already contribute a
total of 54 cleaning hours each week.
Consequently, former Whitman kitchen
manager Justin Hayes, a junior, sees little
room for improvement. "Whitman is a very
clean dorm. It is very well-worn, but it is not
dirty," he said.
AD House Resident Assistant Chip Bartlett,
a senior, agreed that old houses may face
difficulties in significantly improving their
cleanliness scores. He said, "I'm not sure if
it's possible to score above average. The old
carpets are not going to look great no matter
what [cleaners] do."
As former Whitman house manager Allen
Robinson, a senior, explained, "Sending in a
cleaning service is infringing on self-op au
tonomy."
