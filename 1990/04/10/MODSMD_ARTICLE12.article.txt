Ministers support Lithuania
BRATISLAVA, Czechoslovakia (AP) —
Foreign ministers indicated yesterday at a con
ference on Central Europe that Lithuania's
push for independence should be resolved in
dialogue with Moscow so European integration
isn't jeopardized.
Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary joined
Austria, Italy and Yugoslavia at a unique,
daylong conference in Bratislava. The purpose
was to discuss new structures for Europe's
security and ways to curb the historic conflicts
in the region as the East emerges from 45
years of Soviet domination.
President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia
won limited support for his proposal to create
an all-European Security Commission this year
that could gradually replace the Warsaw Pact
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
But the ministers clearly signaled that they
do not want to antagonize the Soviets, nor to
see the crisis over Lithuania derail their efforts
at change.
De Maiziere proposes cabinet
EAST BERLIN (AP) — Lothar de Maiziere,
the prime minister-designate, proposed a
Cabinet yesterday that includes the major po
litical parties and has a peace activist as de
fense minister.
The Christian Democrat leader unveiled the
tentative composition of East Germany's first
democratic government after negotiations with
the nation's diverse political groups.
Agreement was reached in five days of talks
with the Social Democrats, who finished sec
ond to the Christian Democrats in East Ger
many's first free elections March 18.
Georgians protest in strength
TBILISI, U.S.S.R. (AP) - Thousands of
Georgians chanting "Occupiers! Occupiers!"
rallied outside a Soviet military base yesterday,
capping a day of protests recalling a bloody
clash that sparked their republic's indepen
dence movement.
The day of commemorations drew almost
200,000 people to three separate rallies. It
served as a show of strength by independence
activists who have scored several major vic
tories in the past month.
Soldiers assaulted a peaceful pro
independence protest in front of government
buildings in Tbilisi on April 9, 1989, with
shovels and gas. Nineteen people died.
The attack unleashed bitter criticism across
the country. Several investigations have placed
the blame for ordering the attack as high as
the Communist Party Politburo. But no one
has been blamed officially.
Sihanouk wants peace
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — Cambodian
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
yesterday urged an immediate cease-fire in his
country and said the U.N. Security Council
should deploy peacekeeping troops to enforce
it.
The proposed peacekeeping force would com
prise American, Chinese and Soviet soldiers.
Sihanouk is head of a three-faction guerrilla
alliance fighting the Vietnamese-installed gov
ernment in Cambodia. He said there was a
moral responsibility to find a solution to end
the 11-year-old war.
Sihanouk said no winners will emerge from
the conflict but that the big losers will be the
"small citizenry of Cambodia."
In a statement issued from the village in
northwestern Cambodia where he lives,
Sihanouk said the five-member U.N. Security
Council should send a peacekeeping force and
along with the warring factions, proclaim an
immediate cease-fire.
