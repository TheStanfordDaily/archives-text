# Nepalese celebrate political pluralism

KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) - People
smeared their faces with ceremonial
red dust and burst firecrackers yes
terday in nationwide jubilation over
the king's promise to re-establish a
multiparty system in Nepal.
A left-wing radical group said Sun
day's agreement between King
Birendra and the leaders of a seven
week campaign for democracy did not
go far enough. It pledged to continue
the movement, using violence if nec
essary.
Before a curfew was lifted yesterday,
reports said troops shot and killed at
least two people.
After curfew, hundreds of thousands
of people marched through Katmandu
and a half-dozen other towns in the
Himalayan kingdom to celebrate the
agreement clinched by the Nepali Con
gress party and the United Left Front.
The Front is a coalition of left-wing
parties.
Laughing, whistling, clapping and
chanting "Victory! Victory!" people
wound their way through the streets
on foot, cars, motor-powered rick
shaws and tractors.
"Democracy, democracy, we have
now democracy!" a man shouted in
English into a megaphone. Boys with
hand-scrawled "I love democracy"
posters pinned on their backs zipped
around on bicycles.
"Today we will celebrate our free
dom. We have no definite plan, but
we only want to express our joy," said
Yagya Nidhi Duhal, his face smeared
with red powder used by Nepalese dur
ing celebrations.
Most other marchers, including
several Western tourists, wore powder
marks on their foreheads.
On Sunday, Birendra announced he
was lifting a 29-year-old ban on polit
ical parties that has kept the Rashtriya
Panchayat, or national assembly, non
partisan and allowed the king to rule
through a largely rubber-stamp gov
ernment.
The announcement came two days

after the bloodiest day in modern
Nepalese history. Witnesses said as
many as 200 people were killed when
security forces opened fire to prevent
pro-democracy demonstrators from
marching to the king's palace Friday.
The government said 10 people were
killed and 107 injured in nationwide
violence that day.
Immediately after the royal
proclamation, the Nepali Congress
party and the United Left Front said
they were suspending their movement.
But the United National People's
Movement, a radical group that was
supporting the pro-democracy cam
paign, said yesterday that the agree
ment to "withdraw the current move
ment, without abolishing the present
Panchayat constitution ... is definitely
a betrayal to the people.
"We will continue the movement un
til we achieve more. We won't
propagate violence, but we also do not
rule it out," said party spokesman
Babu Ram Bhattarai.
Bhattarai said "the very fact that
they want to amend the constitution
and not form a new one means the
king wants to remain the decisive
body."
The United People's Movement is
not considered a major political force,
but political observers say it com
mands a sizeable following.
Prime Minister Lokendra Chand
told reporters yesterday that a com
mission will amend the constitution
to fulfill the king's promise of
"pluralistic democracy."
Oblivious of the first signs of dissent
among the movement leaders, people
celebrated the royal proclamation into
the night, lighting oil lamps, candles
and electric bulbs around their houses.
Celebrations began at dawn yester
day when a two-day curfew was lifted
in Katmandu and two suburbs, Patan
and Bhaktapur. Tens of thousands of
residents streamed out of their homes
and marched through the main inter
sections and the narrow sidestreets.
