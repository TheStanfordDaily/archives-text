Pepsico signs pact
MOSCOW (AP) — Pepsico Inc.
signed yesterday a $3 billion, 10-year
pact to double Soviet production of
Pepsi in exchange for ships and ex
panded sales of Soviet vodka in the
United States.
The deal also will allow Pepsico to
open two Pizza Hut restaurants in
Moscow this summer.
"It is the largest, most far-reaching
agreement signed by an American
consumer goods company in the So
viet Union," said Donald M. Kendall,
chairman of Pepsico's executive com
mittee.
"It will generate over $3 billion in
retail sales here and in the United
States," he said.
The deal comes less than two
months before the planned summit
meeting between President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
It also comes at a time when the

Soviet government faces increasing
pressure to make more consumer
goods available to its citizens.
"This agreement with the Pepsi
company perhaps doesn't solve the
most important issues in Soviet life,
but it is in the mainstream of our
work in solving the difficult situation
with food products in the Soviet
Union," said Anatoly Belichenko,
deputy minister of food and procure
ment.
