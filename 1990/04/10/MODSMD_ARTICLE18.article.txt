## Lost programming 
### 
UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
Donald Kennedy pointed
out in his annual address
last Thursday that a crucial aspect
of this University is "vital non
classroom types of teaching."
And most important in that area
is the Office of Residential Educa
tion.
Yet despite Kennedy's pledge to
emphasize undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford, Res Ed is facing
crippling cuts â€” slashes that will
damage its contributions to this
University.
In the proposed cuts, resident
fellow positions would be cut,
leaving fewer RFs with a larger
number of students to oversee.
In addition, the number of res
ident assistants will be reduced. In
many houses, the cuts will include
decreased salaries and decreased
responsibilities.
These actions do not jibe with
Kennedy's speech.
The University must decide

what is its "primary academic mis
sion." Previously, Res Ed has
played a large role in that purpose,
a fact that has made Stanford dif
ferent from other universities and
pushed it to the forefront in areas
such as multiculturalism.
With fewer RAs, some of whom
will be responsible only for "coun
seling," much of the programming
in dorms will be lost.
The pride in a residential system
where a large number of people
want to be RFs and RAs will also
will be lost.
The chance for students to speak
out against these changes is now.
Provost James Rosse has sent let
ters to all students indicating that
he is open to suggestions.
Speak up now to reaffirm the
notion that, at Stanford, education
exists outside the classroom as well
as inside.
Let the administration know
that Res Ed should not lose its
valued place at Stanford.
