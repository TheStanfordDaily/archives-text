# Keeping promises
## 
### 
THE LONG battle has finally
paid off.
After a year's stalemate on
negotiations, the owners of Webb
Ranch and the ranch employees
have come to an agreement on a
new contract that will increase
workers' control over their housing
situation and provide wage in
creases.
The agreement will also allow
workers to have more control over
farm production and give them a
voice in decision-making.
In addition, a tenant corporation
will allow workers to take leader
ship in their housing and their
community, an opportunity previ
ously unavailable to them at the
ranch.
The agreement in part results

from overwhelming response by
students, faculty, staff, administra
tion and other members of the
Stanford community. All these
sources have lent their support to
the ranch workers over the past
year, forcing the Webb family to
listen to workers' complaints so
that an agreement could be
reached.
This community effort should
not have been in vain. Both the
Webb family and its employees
should keep their ends of the agree
ment.
A lot of lessons have been
learned by the Webb family, the
ranch workers and the Stanford
community in the past year.
Let's hope they don't have to be
learned all over again.
