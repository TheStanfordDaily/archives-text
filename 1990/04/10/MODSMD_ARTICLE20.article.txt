Kennedy needs to clarify his definition of education

WE ARE WRITING to express
our support for University
President Donald Kennedy's
rededication to teaching and his com
mitment to a reduction in bureaucracy.
More important, however, is our desire
to respond to issues raised in recent
Stanford repositioning statements and
in Kennedy's address to the Stanford
community at the meeting of the
Academic Council on April 5.
In the past, we have celebrated the
conclusion of the academic year at an
elegant dinner that Kennedy has
hosted at Hoover House. At this din
ner he has regularly congratulated us
and expressed his satisfaction with our
performance of our educational and
community-building mission in the
Stanford residences.
We were therefore surprised to learn

in his April 5 address that he feels
"the integration of formal academic
work into the residences has not
achieved the high hopes we routinely
express for it."
More concretely, the Office of Resi
dential Education is not viewed as one
of those departments "closest to Stan
ford's primary mission of teaching and
research," but rather is viewed as a
service "too expensive to provide (its)
current form," and therefore has been
targeted for a 20 to 25 percent budget
cut.
In keeping with Kennedy's call for a
reaffirmation of education as our
"primary task" and for an improve
ment in"the vital non-classroom kinds
of teaching," it is obviously time for us
to have a conversation, not only about
the meaning of pedagogy and "what
makes it successful," but about the

meaning of education and where it
occurs.
Hence we respectfully suggest that it
would not be appropriate for Kennedy
to host a dinner for resident fellows in
a climate of austerity and reposition
ing. Rather, it would be much more
valuable for us to hear where he feels
we have failed to meet his expectations
for resident fellows.
There seems to be a clear dis
crepancy between what we see as a
shared assumption of the University
management (e.g., Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse) that education is
limited to the formal process that
occurs in the classroom, as opposed to
the conviction that education is also
that less formal, but no less valuable,
process that takes place in the Stan
ford residences.
Each January, an in-depth survey of

the residents has demonstrated that
the work of resident fellows is, in fact,
already an embodiment of the educa
tional ideals expressed in the April 5
address and is an endeavor unique on
the national level.
Therefore, this year in lieu of a
dinner for resident fellows at the end
of May, we invite Kennedy and Rosse
to meet with us in order to discuss
their expectations for the contribution
of resident fellows to the educational
mission at Stanford.
It is a well-known management
principle that employees of any organi
zation cannot improve their perform
ance without understanding manage
ment's expectations and the nature of
its dissatisfaction.
