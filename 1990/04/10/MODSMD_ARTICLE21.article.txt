# Kennedy has ignored promise to improve humanities
## 
### 
University President Donald Ken
nedy's speech on Stanford in its second
century contained a startling and dis
maying omission.
Although he referred to points made
in his 1980 inaugural address, he did
not cite perhaps the most memorable
and uplifting promise he made 10
years ago: to give the humanities at
Stanford parity with the sciences.
Why was this left out of his vision
for the future? If in 2010 the humani
ties finally had parity with the sciences
at Stanford, that would be more excit
ing and different than anything else he
predicted. Such a parity would not be

contrary to the new emphasis on
teaching he has called for.
But how can our President call for
more emphasis on teaching while his
administration wants to cut the library
by 20 percent and separates it from
the University's primary academic mis
sion? Has Kennedy given up on his
promise to work for parity in the hu
manities and sciences?
The faculty and students have a
right to know.
