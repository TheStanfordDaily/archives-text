# Any discrimination is contrary to civil rights ideals
## 
### 
Karen Abrams, Elissa Epel and
Sairus Patel's April 6 viewpoint, which

states that discrimination against white
males is acceptable, is an exercise in
rank stupidity and a cry against basic
social justice.
The single most critical goal of the
Civil Rights movement is to ensure
equal rights for all citizens, regardless
of race or gender. The statement of the
viewpoint runs in direct contrast to
this goal.
How one can look at the evils dis
crimination has caused in the past and
then blithely assert that it is accepta
ble to inflict these ills on any individ
ual is utterly beyond me. It does not
matter whether the victim of such
treatment is male or female, black or
white â€” discrimination is an evil re
gardless of who is forced to endure it.
Thinking, as the authors of the
viewpoint that people of one skin color
can be discriminated against is the
same position that Martin Luther King
Jr. lost his life fighting against. All

that the viewpoint did differently than
King's opponents was to pick a differ
ent target for discrimination.
If anyone is denied opportunity on
the basis of the amount of melanin in
his or her skin, it is a moral horror
and a blot upon the honor of our na
tion. One cannot have selective civil
justice and have any kind of real jus
tice at all. We already endure too much
discrimination in the United States.
To categorize people by such superfi
cial factors as skin color is just plain
ridiculous and to assert that someone
should be treated differently because
she or he falls into one of these artifi
cial categories is even more absurd.
To claim that such action should be
taken against any individual, even
someone who is categorized in a so
called "meyority group," in the name of
equal rights is a travesty.
