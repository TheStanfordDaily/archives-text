## 'Fighting words' troubling 
### 
ATTENTION, students of Stan
ford. We have a real-life issue
before us as we prepare for the
ASSU elections. This issue is not of
the blue-in-the-face, barely-breathing,
half-dead variety of which we are
accustomed. The recent "Grey propos
al" from the Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council is the genuine article.
The problem of hate speech and its
regulation has national implications.
Stanford has the opportunity to take
the lead in forming a responsible policy
that strikes a balance between free
speech rights and civil rights.
The Grey proposal represents a very
real improvement over the original
SCLC proposal, which was offered on
March 1, 1989. It allows for con
siderably more latitude for free speech
than its predecessor by limiting the
scope of its regulation and clearing up
a good deal of its vagueness.
By excluding hate speech directed at
large groups and limiting its regulation
to a "small number of individuals," the
Grey proposal leaves most hate speech
protected. But by doing so, it
eliminates the extreme open-endedness
of the original proposal, which held out
the potential for a nearly boundless
ban on speech.
However, even the Grey proposal
includes troubling ambiguities. The
"fighting" words provision is a good
faith attempt to prevent an overbroad
regulation which produces the un
wanted "chilling effect" on open and
vigorous debate.
Taken from the 1942 Supreme Court

decision, Chaplinsky v. New
Hampshire, the definition of " 'fight
ing' words — those which by their
very utterance inflict injury or tend to
incite an immediate breach of the
peace" leaves open much uncertainty as
to its application in practice.
Notwithstanding the fact that the
high court has since repeatedly
declined to use this standard to
prohibit offensive speech, "fighting"
words, as so described, could be inter
preted to include much speech which
would be considered not only worthy
of protection but also highly desirable.
A good deal of the speech of Martin
Luther King Jr. could have been con
strued as "fighting words" since it
tended to "incite an immediate breach
of the peace" because Southern racists
chose to react violently to his message.
By the "fighting" words standard, it
would seem that individuals willing to
do violence or threaten violence could
exercise veto power over opposing
opinions, thus creating a perversion of
rights where good people are silenced
because their speech and actions
precipitate violence.
Indeed, the SCLC recognizes and
addresses this concern: "exclusive focus
on the actual likelihood of violence
might suggest that opponents of con
troversial speech can transform it into
forbidden 'fighting words' by plausibly
threatening violent response to it —
the so-called 'heckler's veto.' The
speech, if it is to be subject to
restraint, must also be grossly insult-

ing by the more objective standard of
commonly shared social standards."
Here "fighting words" becomes
problematic because it holds controver
sial speech up to accepted "social
standards." It is just this element of
public approval which is antithetical to
the First Amendment.
Indeed, speech which is obscene,
insulting or otherwise objectionable, is
the only type of speech needing protec
tion. It is not speech from groups like
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which
already has majority approval.
Actually, the very measure of our
society's free speech rights is our
tolerance for the speech which we
deem to have the lowest value: Ku
Klux Klan, Nazi demonstrations, etc.
This is not to say that some of these
most abhorrent sorts of speech are
immune to regulation on this campus,
but that by ultimately appealing to
social standards, the "fighting words"
doctrine may prove to be grounds for
regulating controversial speech, which
is, in fact, covered by the First Amend
ment.
