## Row living lets students develop responsibility 
### 
A QUIET CRISIS is taking shape
at Stanford University, a crisis
emblematic of many issues cen
tral to how this institution functions.
Though it may sound melodramatic,
the Row administration's effort to strip
houses of their independence by forcing
outside cleaning services down their
throats threatens to further isolate,
bureaucratize and marginalize the
Stanford lifestyle.
Presently, students living in self-ops
and co-ops have the responsibility for
cleaning their houses. In an apparent
shift, the Row administration has
decided that students are not com
petent enough, or simply don't have
the time, to clean up after themselves.
The very fact that many Row resi
dents are enraged by this recent devel
opment speaks for the independent
lifestyle on the Row. Though savings
on housing costs contribute to this
loyalty, it is more than just a question
of money.
At issue is whether students should
be allowed to develop self-responsibility.

The big dorm lifestyle, replete with
housekeeping services and in-house
administrators, imparts a totally differ
ent attitude than Row living. Students
living in Toyon Hail or Roble Hall
don't have to accept responsibility for
their actions, and thus there is a much
greater tendency to trash the dorm.
Sure, 10 minutes after the maids
have completed their work, Toyon may
be cleaner than 10 minutes after house
crews clean Whitman House. But go
back two hours later, and you will find
that Whitman is much cleaner because
the residents care about their house.
Then go back Sunday afternoon.
Walk through any big dorm. You will
find trash in the halls, trash in the
bathrooms and trash in the lounge.
Someone probably vomited or urinated
on the bathroom floor after a big
Saturday night.
Walk over to a house where the
students have to clean up after them
selves.
Though it may not always be the
case, you will probably find a cleaner

The Row office, an of
fice that can't even
handle the tasks al
ready assigned to it, is
attempting to expand
its responsibility.

house, and you will certainly find
students more willing to pick up trash
off the floor rather than let it wait
until someone else does.
From my experience, having lived in
both Toyon and Whitman House, I
think self-ops also create a much
closer-knit community than other
houses.
I grumbled along with most people
when I had to wake up on Sunday
morning to clean bathrooms, but the
experience of working together with

fellow residents was valuable. We
created a sense of community and a
loyalty that is missing in many
University-administered houses.
Another issue is whether this Uni
versity really needs more bureaucracy.
Am I mistaken, or didn't University
President Donald Kennedy stress
streamlining over bureaucratization in
his speech last Thursday?
In this case, an office is attempting
to expand its responsibility, an office
that can't even handle the tasks al
ready assigned to it.
Anyone who lives on the Row proba
bly can tell of submitting a work order
four or five times before a repair is
completed. And these people want
more responsibility?
Or try walking through a Row house
the first week of fall quarter. The
houses are administered by the Row
and occupied over the summer.
Each house is cleaned by residents at
the end of spring quarter. A great deal
of time and effort is expended making
sure the houses meet the Row's

cleanliness requirements.
Unfortunately, the Row doesn't use
the same care in cleaning the houses
after the summer. In many cases the
houses are dirtier in the fall, after the
Row supposedly cleaned them, than
they were at the end of the spring.
All of this adds up to the simple
conclusion that a few administrators in
the Row should not be allowed to
destroy a valuable part of Stanford life
in the name of "administrative efficien
_ ft
cy.
A more constructive position might
be to work with self-ops an co-ops to
create a common set of reasonable
standards to help these houses survive.
