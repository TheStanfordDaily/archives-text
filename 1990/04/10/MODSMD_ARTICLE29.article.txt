# John L'Heureux's last interview
## Former creative writing program director discusses his life, work 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Poet and novelist John
L'Heureux finished a 12-year
stint as director of Stanford's cre
ative writing program last year,
and now, with more time to write,
he has a collection of stories hot
off the presses and a long novel
on the way.
"Comedians," a collection of
two short stories, nine sketches
and a novella, was published a
few months ago by Viking and
"An Honorable Profession," a
novel set in a high school, will be
released next January.
"It ('An Honorable Profession')
was scheduled originally for Oc
tober, but the Rolling Stones are
bringing out something in Octo
ber that will use up all of Viking's
advertising budget, so they
postponed it until January,"
L'Heureux said. "It shows you
how one can easily be forced to
acknowledge one's betters."
L'Heureux was born in western
Massachusetts. He attended
public schools and then Holy
Cross College in Worcester, Mass.
before becoming a Jesuit. He was
a Jesuit for 16 years.
During those years, he studied,
taught and wrote. He earned
master's degrees in philosophy
and theology. Then he earned a
master's degree in literature at
Harvard University and was
working on his Ph.D. there, but

he never finished.
"I still don't have a Ph.D. I am
completely unlettered,"
L'Heureux said.
L'Heureux went to work as a
literary editor at the Atlantic
Monthly, where he had been pub
lishing poetry for about 10 years,
since he was in his early twenties.
After working for the Atlantic
Monthly for a little over a year,
he moved to England to think
about leaving the Jesuits.
He applied to leave the Jesuit
order from England, and his re
quest was approved. Eleven days
later, he married Joan, to whom
all his books are dedicated, and
they have been together ever
since.
Despite the rapid succession of
events, L'Heureux said his desire
to get married had little to do
with his decision to leave the
priesthood.
"I left the Jesuits because I
wanted to live my own life, make
my own decisions and take re
sponsibility for those decisions,"
L'Heureux explained. "With a
vow of obedience, you simply can
not do that. The vows of poverty
and chastity didn't bother me
nearly so much as the vow of
obedience.
"I wanted to live my own life,
and one of the things I wanted
to do was to write and to write
fiction. That's possible but not
easy as a Jesuit," he added.
L'Heureux said he could not

have written any of the novels he
has written while he was a Jesuit.
"They would cause scandals,
not because they are scandalous
novels, but because people don't
expect priests to be writing that
sort of thing," he said. "For in
stance, Andrew Greeley, who re
mains a priest, not a Jesuit but
a priest and writes these trashy
novels is to my mind a source of
great scandal because the novels
are in a very pure sense pornog
raphy.
"The idea that a priest of any
kind should be spending his time
and whatever talent he has writ
ing that kind of titillating garbage
is monstrously offensive to me,"
L'Heureux continued.
After spending a year in Eng
land, L'Heureux came back to the
United States and accepted a job
as editor in chief of a magazine
called the Boston Review of the
Arts.
L'Heureux, who had taught at
five universities including
Georgetown, Tufts and Harvard
while he served as a Jesuit, was
hired by Stanford as an assistant
professor in 1973.
In "Comedians," L'Heureux
said he deals more overtly and
specifically with theological prob
lems than he does in his other
books.
"Almost all of the stories are
concerned with God's intervention
in our lives, His attempt to get
our attention, to nudge us into
noticing that we are not the still
point of the turning world as
much as we would like to think
so," L'Heureux explained.
But the stories are also graced
by a wit that L'Heureux has be
come known for.
"In all of my fiction, I try to
put a lot of funny stuff because
it seems to me that in every hor
rible situation there is always
something that is wildly
inappropriate to the situation and
because of that terribly funny,"
L'Heureux said.
"Comedians" was put together
over the course of five or six years.
L'Heureux's last book of stories,
"Desires," was published in 1980.
His last novel, "A Woman Run
Mad," came out in 1988.
"From the time I was a very
little kid, I wanted to be a writer
or a painter or an actor, all im
itative arts," he explained. "It's
difficult for me to say when I
became a writer because I've al
ways written."
L'Heureux points to Flannery

O'Connor, Evelyn Waugh,
Graham Greene and Iris Murdoch
as writers who have influenced
his work.
"The glorious thing about
literature is that it allows you, as
a reader, to experience vicariously
what you never fortunately have
to undergo in real life,"
L'Heureux explained. "The same
is true with a writer. It allows
you to purge yourself of all the
worst kind of bedevilling thoughts
or ideas or even temptations with
out ever having to go through
with them."
One of the less glorious things
about being an author is that
reporters call you up to ask for
interviews. Though the interview
did not go poorly, L'Heureux
jokingly pledged that this is the
last interview he will ever give.
"A person talking about his
work is a person committing him
self to public folly," he explained.
"The reason you write the book
is because you had something to
say that did not lend itself to a
telegram or a letter, and it makes
you seem self-important and ri
diculous. It makes your work
seem a lot more trivial than it
actually is."
So ends John L'Heureux's last
interview.

ative writing program last year,
and now, with more time to write,
he has a collection of stories hot
off the presses and a long novel
on the way.
"Comedians," a collection of
two short stories, nine sketches
and a novella, was published a
few months ago by Viking and
"An Honorable Profession," a
novel set in a high school, will be
released next January.
"It ('An Honorable Profession')
was scheduled originally for Oc
tober, but the Rolling Stones are
bringing out something in Octo
ber that will use up all of Viking's
advertising budget, so they
postponed it until January,"
L'Heureux said. "It shows you
how one can easily be forced to
acknowledge one's betters."
L'Heureux was born in western
Massachusetts. He attended
public schools and then Holy
Cross College in Worcester, Mass.
before becoming a Jesuit. He was
a Jesuit for 16 years.
During those years, he studied,
taught and wrote. He earned
master's degrees in philosophy
and theology. Then he earned a
master's degree in literature at
Harvard University and was
working on his Ph.D. there, but

he never finished.
"I still don't have a Ph.D. I am
completely unlettered,"
L'Heureux said.
L'Heureux went to work as a
literary editor at the Atlantic
Monthly, where he had been pub
lishing poetry for about 10 years,
since he was in his early twenties.
After working for the Atlantic
Monthly for a little over a year,
he moved to England to think
about leaving the Jesuits.
He applied to leave the Jesuit
order from England, and his re
quest was approved. Eleven days
later, he married Joan, to whom
all his books are dedicated, and
they have been together ever
since.
Despite the rapid succession of
events, L'Heureux said his desire
to get married had little to do
with his decision to leave the
priesthood.
"I left the Jesuits because I
wanted to live my own life, make
my own decisions and take re
sponsibility for those decisions,"
L'Heureux explained. "With a
vow of obedience, you simply can
not do that. The vows of poverty
and chastity didn't bother me
nearly so much as the vow of
obedience.
"I wanted to live my own life,
and one of the things I wanted
to do was to write and to write
fiction. That's possible but not
easy as a Jesuit," he added.
L'Heureux said he could not

have written any of the novels he
has written while he was a Jesuit.
"They would cause scandals,
not because they are scandalous
novels, but because people don't
expect priests to be writing that
sort of thing," he said. "For in
stance, Andrew Greeley, who re
mains a priest, not a Jesuit but
a priest and writes these trashy
novels is to my mind a source of
great scandal because the novels
are in a very pure sense pornog
raphy.
"The idea that a priest of any
kind should be spending his time
and whatever talent he has writ
ing that kind of titillating garbage
is monstrously offensive to me,"
L'Heureux continued.
After spending a year in Eng
land, L'Heureux came back to the
United States and accepted a job
as editor in chief of a magazine
called the Boston Review of the
Arts.
L'Heureux, who had taught at
five universities including
Georgetown, Tufts and Harvard
while he served as a Jesuit, was
hired by Stanford as an assistant
professor in 1973.
In "Comedians," L'Heureux
said he deals more overtly and
specifically with theological prob
lems than he does in his other
books.
"Almost all of the stories are
concerned with God's intervention
in our lives, His attempt to get
our attention, to nudge us into
noticing that we are not the still
point of the turning world as
much as we would like to think
so," L'Heureux explained.
But the stories are also graced
by a wit that L'Heureux has be
come known for.
"In all of my fiction, I try to
put a lot of funny stuff because
it seems to me that in every hor
rible situation there is always
something that is wildly
inappropriate to the situation and
because of that terribly funny,"
L'Heureux said.
"Comedians" was put together
over the course of five or six years.
L'Heureux's last book of stories,
"Desires," was published in 1980.
His last novel, "A Woman Run
Mad," came out in 1988.
"From the time I was a very
little kid, I wanted to be a writer
or a painter or an actor, all im
itative arts," he explained. "It's
difficult for me to say when I
became a writer because I've al
ways written."
L'Heureux points to Flannery

O'Connor, Evelyn Waugh,
Graham Greene and Iris Murdoch
as writers who have influenced
his work.
"The glorious thing about
literature is that it allows you, as
a reader, to experience vicariously
what you never fortunately have
to undergo in real life,"
L'Heureux explained. "The same
is true with a writer. It allows
you to purge yourself of all the
worst kind of bedevilling thoughts
or ideas or even temptations with
out ever having to go through
with them."
One of the less glorious things
about being an author is that
reporters call you up to ask for
interviews. Though the interview
did not go poorly, L'Heureux
jokingly pledged that this is the
last interview he will ever give.
"A person talking about his
work is a person committing him
self to public folly," he explained.
"The reason you write the book
is because you had something to
say that did not lend itself to a
telegram or a letter, and it makes
you seem self-important and ri
diculous. It makes your work
seem a lot more trivial than it
actually is."
So ends John L'Heureux's last
interview.
