# Cowell, ethnic centers among targets
## Student services may face cutbacks 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
Impending budget cuts in the
Office of Student Affairs may take
their toll on a large number of
student services, from ethnic com
munity centers to Cowell Student
Health Center, officials said.
But while Cowell has been given
a preliminary budget reduction
figure, the future budgets of
many other services are far less
certain.
Cowell faces a budget cut of
about $327,000, or 9 percent of
its total budget, according to act
ing director Harvey Weinstein.
Because University budget
planners have decided that certain
"basic medical services" cannot be
eliminated, Cowell's options for
cutbacks are limited, he said.
Officials in the Campus Affairs
division of Student Affairs, which
includes all of the ethnic commu
nity centers and Student Organi
zation Services, are not yet sure
of the amounts their budgets will
be cut.
However, even if the Campus

Affairs budget is frozen at its cur
rent level, services to students will
be affected, according to Keith Ar
chuleta, director of the Black
Community Services Center.
The center is fairly new and is
already underfunded and under
staffed, Archuleta said. "There
are not too many places they can
cut," he said.
Archuleta added that the center
is just getting to the point where
it could become more self
sufficient. The operation "still
needs nurturing if it is going to
grow," he noted.
Jim Bouquin, director of the
Disability Resource Center, echoed
Archuleta's sentiments. Even a
budget freeze would present a dif
ficult situation for the resource
center, he said.
The number of disabled stu
dents at Stanford has doubled in
the past three years, and Bouquin
said he expects it to continue to
increase.
The office provides two primary
functions to the community of dis
abled students on campus â€” a
community center and services

such as readers, interpreters and
note-takers. Because some of
these services are required by law,
Bouquin said he fears a cut might
take away the resources needed
for the community center.
According to Michael Ramsey-
Perez, director of SOS, people's
expectations of services from his
office will have to change. While
no definite plans for reductions
have been made, there will prob
ably be fewer services, and those
that remain may be less efficient.
Ruth Schneider, director of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, said her office is examin
ing every aspect of the CPPC op
eration to see what can be cut.
Because 85 percent of the CPPC
budget pays salaries, it is possible
that some staff positions may be
cut, she said.
The Cowell staff is currently
exploring four main ways of meet
ing its budget goal. One proposal,
which Weinstein called his first
choice, would be to close Cowell's
infirmary, which would reduce
the budget by $130,000.
If this proposal is approved, stu

dents too ill to remain in their
residences would have to go to
Stanford Hospital. In addition,
the infirmary would not be avail
able for after-hours urgent care,
forcing students to go to the emer
gency room.
A second possibility is to reduce
the budget of Counseling and Psy
chological Services by $90,000.
This cut would probably reduce
both staff and programs, accord
ing to the proposal.
CAPS currently has a 25-person
waiting list for treatment, and it
is likely that if the staff were
reduced further, the waiting list
would lengthen, Weinstein said.
In addition, CAPS would be less
flexible in responding to emer
gency or crisis situations and
would have less time to work with
individual dorms.
Weinstein said he worries that
CAPS will have less time for con
sultations with resident assistants
and resident fellows. Because res
idence staffs often refer students
to CAPS, problems might not be
