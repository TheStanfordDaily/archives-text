"Comedians," Stanford author John L'Heureuxto
12th book, is a collection of 11 stories and one
novella which revolve mainly around the lives of
artists and deal with theological questions.
The first story in the collection, "The Comedian,"
is about Corinne, a female comedian whose unborn
fetus sings to her from inside the womb. The story
presents a snapshot of a life torn by career and
relationship pressures and faced with the choice of
whether or not to bring a child into the world.
In the next section of the book, L'Heureux offers
nine sketches which he groups together and calls
"Brief Lives." The first story, "Father," is based
upon the death of his father. L'Heureux said he
was playing a game by writing himself into the
story, but he added that he should have used other
names because it seems to have distressed people.
He said he hopes people find the story funny and
painful.
In another sketch, "The Poison Girls," L'Heureux
writes about how the scorn of three female students
ate away at the psyche of their writing instructor.
"In 'The Poison Girls' I was concerned with
hatred's power to destroy, and I found it amusing
to have me as the character who was destroyed,"
L'Heureux said. "Very few of the teaching experi
ences described in my fiction have not come in some
way from my life.
"The hatred 1 explore here comes from a young
man I rather liked who simply detested me," he
continued. "I was, from his point of view, absolutely
detestable."
L'Heureux said one day he was walking on
campus, thinking about how wonderful it was to
be at Stanford, and then he saw himself from this
student's point of view and realized that the student
was right. But instead of crumbling when he saw
the part of him that was detestable, L'Heureux said
he laughed because that is what people do to get
through times like those.
In the beginning of the book, L'Heureux frames
the stories with a quote from Christopher Fry:
"Comedy is an escape not from truth but from
despair."
"I chose the quote because Fry elevates comedy
here to a sphere that does not include horse-laughs
or knee-slapping but insists on comedy as a way of
dealing with the most important issues of life: faith,
love, despair, how one gets through existence,"
L'Heureux explained.
After "Brief Lives," L'Heureux offers a broad,
masterful novella called "The Terrible Mirror,"
which is about a promising young sculptor and his
wife and how they change over time.
L'Heureux said that though he has never tried
his hand at sculpture before, he has a friend who
is a distinguished sculptor and taught him about
the anguish of trying to create something out of
alabaster or clay.
Many of the stories in the book deal with the
lives of artists.
In"The Terrible Mirror," L'Heureux also presents
theological problems and depicts the dissolution of
a relationship. He explained that, while he is happily
married, being a priest and later living in an aca
demic community have put him in touch with many
people whose relationships are not as fulfilling.
L'Heureux said "Comedians" deals with theologi
cal problems more overtly than any of his 11 other
books.
"There is a peculiar preoccupation with theological
problems in this book as there is not in most books
of short stories published today," L'Heureux ex
plained. "I am not so concerned with who is screwing
whom or whether or not these people who are
engaging in an adulterous affair will get together

at the end of the story or whether he will go back
to his wife or whether this person will succeed in
coming of age or coming out of the closet or coming
into the big job as in 'Bonfire of the Vanities,'
which isn't to put any of these things down; it is
just to say that these are not my subject matter.
"I'm much more interested in people's anguish
over whether or not their particular lives have any
meaning, whether or not that meaning includes the
existence or possibility of existence of God who is
a personal god in any way and cares about them
or wishes to interfere in their lives, and I'm very
concerned about what function love of another has
in the life of a human being," he continued. "But
more often, in these stories, there is the problem
of God that is being addressed here."
Like several of the other stories in the collection,
"Maria Luz Buenvida" asks the reader to accept
what L'Heureux calls the "suprarational."
"Whenever I resort to the suprarational, this ob
viously is intended to alert the reader to the fact
that this is something more than conventional
realism, but in each case that I resort to this sort
of thing, I intend it to be taken in both its literal
and metaphorical sense," L'Heureux explained. "I
usually take great care to provide the terms of
interpretation within the story."
In the case of "Maria Luz Buenvida," L'Heureux
said the story came to him whole one day.
"I'd been reading an awful lot about the disap
peared in South America, and I'd read three very
lengthy articles by Joan Didion in the New York
Review of Books. I'd read her book 'Salvador' and
a couple of other things, and it just sort of got into
my psyche and I came up with this little story,"
L'Heureux explained. "It is the only first-person
story I have ever written, and it certainly is the
only story I've ever written from the point of view
of someone who is going to be dead in a couple of
minutes.
"You are supposed to take it as seriously as you
would take anyone's last words," he continued. "Of
course her very last words are an apocalyptic state
ment of resurrection, some kind of divine blessing
on all of this mayhem and bloodshed."
