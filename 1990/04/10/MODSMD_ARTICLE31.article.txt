## Card beats moonstruck SJSU Hammonds extends record hitting streak to 31 games 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
SAN JOSE — Maybe it was the full
moon.
How else do you explain a game be
tween two top-ten baseball teams which
saw six errors, 13 walks, at least four
mental goofs, a 15-minute brouhaha
over inept umpiring, grounders that
took maniacal, infielder-mauling killer
hops, throws that missed their targets
by a lot and one fly ball that was mis
judged by about a quarter-mile?

Cardinal 6
Spartans 5

Amid the sea of craziness — the first
four innings took almost two hours to
complete, and that was before the 15-
minute philosophical debate concerning
the umpires' grasp of reality took place
— only Stanford pitcher John Reid
emerged as an island of sanity in Stan
ford's 6-5 win over San Jose State.
Reid, whose previous best outing had
been in a 4-3 victory against the Spar
tans back in February, came on last
night in the fourth inning with the
bases loaded and nobody out and
promptly struck out the next three bat
ters, setting the tone for the rest of the
game. From that point on, the Spartans
got only one run, as Reid gave up only
four hits in the next five innings.
"Reid came in and really did the job
on us," San Jose Coach Sam Piraro
said. "He threw the breaking ball really
well. . . . It's sharp, and it's crisp. That's
just a fantastic performance on his
part."
Even with Reid humming — he
finished the game with six Ks and only
two walks — this was a game which
turned out to be downright loopy. The
first inning was normal enough, with
the Spartans taking a 3-1 lead thanks
to two Jamie Sepeda walks, a triple and
a double. From then on, though. . . .
The Cardinal knotted the score in the

second (which was also when Jeff Ham
monds picked up a hit for the 31st game
in a row) and then things got really fun
in the third. After Paul Carey singled
(he ended the evening 3-for-4), Tim Grif
fin hit a fly ball to center. Spartan Greg
Mugg camped under the ball,
waited. . . and watched it fall twenty feet
to his left. Second and third, one out.
Two batters later, catcher Charles Havel
tried to pick Carey off third and threw
the ball into left field. Four-three Stan
ford.
The Spartans tied it up in the next
inning on a hit, a walk and a throwing
error on Tim Griffin. A walk later
Sepeda was gone, but Reid slammed the
door.
In the top of the fifth, though, an
already-ugly game went straight into
the toilet. Spartan pitcher Chris Martin
gave up three walks to load the bases
with two down, and then Roger Burnett
hit a squib to the right of the mound.
Martin raced down, picked up the ball,
ran over to tag Burnett and fell to the
ground. The home-plate umpire waited,
waited, finally saw the ball rolling in
the grass and called Burnett safe.
"I hit his glove and kept running,"
said Burnett, "and then when I turned
to look, I saw he was bobbling the ball."
Piraro raced out of the dugout, a mite
irate at the call, and during the whole
play both David McCarty and Carey
scored.
Piraro took a very long time to make
his point. "We had a replay camera, and
my argument was that the tag was made

and then when he (Martin) tried to
show, the ball he lost it," Piraro said
afterward. "The umpire misconstrued
that as a bobble. ... The out should
have been right there. That's baseball,
though."
Piraro didn't win argument No. 1 —
Burnett stayed at first — but then won
argument No. 2, in which he said time
had been called as soon as he raced on
the field to argue No. 1, which meant
Carey's run shouldn't count.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
begged to differ, and did so for several
minutes. "The ball was still in play; no
one had called time out," Marquess said.
"You can't stop a play like that. . . .You
can't penalize the offensive team for
that. That's a live ball."
The umpires, after great debate,
decided Piraro was right and sent Carey
back to third, taking the run off the
board. Marquess protested the game.
Why? "He (the umpire) didn't know
what was going on," he said. Fair
enough.
The lost run didn't turn out to be of
much consequence, however, because
after the Spartans tied it up (with the
help of two Stanford throwing errors),
the Cardinal took advantage of an schiz
ophrenic infield to score the winning
run.
"The field wasn't bad for the first
four innings," Burnett said, "but it got
to the point where there were no true
hops. I can't complain, though, because
it went both ways." He would know:
Burnett caught one grounder on the
shoulder and another in the neck be
cause of crazy hops.
In the seventh, though, with the bases
loaded, the ground turned out to be
Burnett's best friend. With men on first
and second, he hit a chopper toward
third baseman Jeff Ball, who watched
the ball take a crazy hop, smack off his
glove and race into left field. Griffin
scored on the play, and Reid escaped a
jam in the bottom of the inning —
thanks largely to a spectacular diving
stop by Burnett — before setting the
Spartans down quietly in the last two.
