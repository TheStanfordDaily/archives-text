# Of Little League and lockouts — Opening Day blues
## 
### 
Yesterday was Opening Day, the day
millions of Americans wait months
for. It is a precursor to warming
temperatures, the end of another school
year and a season of the national pastime.
To me, it's no big deal.
Before you start going on some McCar
thian tear, branding me a communist
and sending me off to Siberia (or do they
not do that now that they're being nice
over there?), let me say for starters that
I love baseball.
In fact, let me say at length how I love
the game.
Some of my fondest memories of little
kiddie dom were of riding in the back of
Mom and Dad's station wagon to the
Oakland Coliseum. We'd go and see guys
like Reggie, Vida, Catfish, Rollie and Sal
Bando (my favorite, I don't know why);
watch Charlie Finley's mule parade
around the ballpark and eat some jumbo
dogs.
Then, after the game, we'd drive back.
I'd try to watch the drive-in movies play
ing along both sides of the freeway until
I fell asleep. When we'd get home, Mom
would wake me up. I'd go inside and fall
asleep in my bed, dreaming about being
the next Joe Rudi.

When I was old enough, I played
Little League. I was pretty
worthless, but at least I had fun.
My throwing arm wasn't too accurate,
so they put me at second base. I still
came up with the occasional Steve Sax
from second, so they then moved me to
first. I dealt with that a little better. All
you had to do was catch.
When I was 12, my last year in Little
League, I came away with perhaps my
most lasting memory. I still remember
the day I went over to my coach's house,
clutching an article I clipped from the
San Jose Mercury News that morning
about a star left-hander at San Jose State.
I got the article autographed by the
southpaw himself, who also happened to
be the coach's son: "To Chris, Best of
luck in everything you do. Mark
Langston."
Little did I realize then that the left
arm he signed the story with would
eventually be worth three million
dollars a year. But I was just a stupid
little kid then.
The reasons I loved the game were
simple. Basically it was just a bunch of
grown men doing the same thing I was
doing in Little League — they only did

it a bit better. It was easy to see that
inside all those men, all my heroes, were
just a bunch of kids like me, going out
to play every day and loving every minute
of it.
Eventually, however, I got smarter to
the ways of the world. I slowly realized
you couldn't be a kid forever. Sooner or
later you basically had to grow up.
My heroes came of age as well, it seems.
While I was painfully learning there was
more to living than the game of baseball,
they were learning there was more to
the game of baseball than a living.
It wasn't sufficient to be able to play
a game and earn enough money to avoid
having to get a real job. They figured
they deserved better. They never really
explained why, but they all needed raises.
So they struck, way back in 1981.
The owners and the players finally
worked things out, however, and
baseball returned.
And I forgave them.
I mean these are my heroes we're
talking about. Those big guys in those
fancy uniforms weren't really greedy;
they just had a bad day or something.
But now we have strife again. There
was this lockout thing. And it really both

ered me.
Major league baseball has signed tele
vision contracts worth several hundreds
of millions of dollars. Yet they do nothing
but haggle for 30 days when they should
be playing pepper. And the only reason
they could come up with was that basi
cally the players and the owners couldn't
come to an agreement on whether a spe
cific handful of players should be able to
play that ridiculous game called arbitra
tion.
Why didn't they just play that fun
game called baseball?
I want to love baseball because I
thought it was a bunch of guys who just
never grew up. Now it seems they not
only grew up; they also got grumpy in
their old age.

So this is why 1 don't give a flying
fungo about Opening Day.
I decided a couple weeks ago that I
would try to avoid baseball, to hate
it even, until about mid-June. I
figured that was a reasonable length of
time.
1 did well through spring training, only
glancing at about two linescores and
reading zero stories in my favorite morn
ing paper. But yesterday was tough. I
was working at this job I have in the
Athletic Department, and there was a
television inside one of the offices there.
Needless to say (this is the Athletic De
partment, not like History or something),
baseball was on.
I tried to stay away, but I saw a few
pitches. I actually watched the Orioles
get the last two outs in the bottom of
the ninth to send the game into extra
innings before I turned away.
I guess the little boy in me still hasn't
learned how to hate, especially not a game
that enjoyable. I don't think I'm going
to make it to June.

would try to avoid baseball, to hate
it even, until about mid-June. I
figured that was a reasonable length of
time.
1 did well through spring training, only
glancing at about two linescores and
reading zero stories in my favorite morn
ing paper. But yesterday was tough. I
was working at this job I have in the
Athletic Department, and there was a
television inside one of the offices there.
Needless to say (this is the Athletic De
partment, not like History or something),
baseball was on.
I tried to stay away, but I saw a few
pitches. I actually watched the Orioles
get the last two outs in the bottom of
the ninth to send the game into extra
innings before I turned away.
I guess the little boy in me still hasn't
learned how to hate, especially not a game
that enjoyable. I don't think I'm going
to make it to June.

Yesterday was Opening Day, the day
millions of Americans wait months
for. It is a precursor to warming
temperatures, the end of another school
year and a season of the national pastime.
To me, it's no big deal.
Before you start going on some McCar
thian tear, branding me a communist
and sending me off to Siberia (or do they
not do that now that they're being nice
over there?), let me say for starters that
I love baseball.
In fact, let me say at length how I love
the game.
Some of my fondest memories of little
kiddie dom were of riding in the back of
Mom and Dad's station wagon to the
Oakland Coliseum. We'd go and see guys
like Reggie, Vida, Catfish, Rollie and Sal
Bando (my favorite, I don't know why);
watch Charlie Finley's mule parade
around the ballpark and eat some jumbo
dogs.
Then, after the game, we'd drive back.
I'd try to watch the drive-in movies play
ing along both sides of the freeway until
I fell asleep. When we'd get home, Mom
would wake me up. I'd go inside and fall
asleep in my bed, dreaming about being
the next Joe Rudi.

When I was old enough, I played
Little League. I was pretty
worthless, but at least I had fun.
My throwing arm wasn't too accurate,
so they put me at second base. I still
came up with the occasional Steve Sax
from second, so they then moved me to
first. I dealt with that a little better. All
you had to do was catch.
When I was 12, my last year in Little
League, I came away with perhaps my
most lasting memory. I still remember
the day I went over to my coach's house,
clutching an article I clipped from the
San Jose Mercury News that morning
about a star left-hander at San Jose State.
I got the article autographed by the
southpaw himself, who also happened to
be the coach's son: "To Chris, Best of
luck in everything you do. Mark
Langston."
Little did I realize then that the left
arm he signed the story with would
eventually be worth three million
dollars a year. But I was just a stupid
little kid then.
The reasons I loved the game were
simple. Basically it was just a bunch of
grown men doing the same thing I was
doing in Little League — they only did

it a bit better. It was easy to see that
inside all those men, all my heroes, were
just a bunch of kids like me, going out
to play every day and loving every minute
of it.
Eventually, however, I got smarter to
the ways of the world. I slowly realized
you couldn't be a kid forever. Sooner or
later you basically had to grow up.
My heroes came of age as well, it seems.
While I was painfully learning there was
more to living than the game of baseball,
they were learning there was more to
the game of baseball than a living.
It wasn't sufficient to be able to play
a game and earn enough money to avoid
having to get a real job. They figured
they deserved better. They never really
explained why, but they all needed raises.
So they struck, way back in 1981.
The owners and the players finally
worked things out, however, and
baseball returned.
And I forgave them.
I mean these are my heroes we're
talking about. Those big guys in those
fancy uniforms weren't really greedy;
they just had a bad day or something.
But now we have strife again. There
was this lockout thing. And it really both

ered me.
Major league baseball has signed tele
vision contracts worth several hundreds
of millions of dollars. Yet they do nothing
but haggle for 30 days when they should
be playing pepper. And the only reason
they could come up with was that basi
cally the players and the owners couldn't
come to an agreement on whether a spe
cific handful of players should be able to
play that ridiculous game called arbitra
tion.
Why didn't they just play that fun
game called baseball?
I want to love baseball because I
thought it was a bunch of guys who just
never grew up. Now it seems they not
only grew up; they also got grumpy in
their old age.

So this is why 1 don't give a flying
fungo about Opening Day.
I decided a couple weeks ago that I
would try to avoid baseball, to hate
it even, until about mid-June. I
figured that was a reasonable length of
time.
