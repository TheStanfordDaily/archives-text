# Women's netters to host Fresno State
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Sometimes, in the middle of a
raging hurricane, the wind sud
denly stops blowing. The sky
clears rapidly and the sun begins
to shine.
Alas, it is Mother Nature per
petrating a cruel hoax yet again.
As quickly as eye of the storm
sweeps in, it passes by and leaves
in its wake the rest of the hur
ricane.
Call today's tennis match
against Fresno State the eye of
the storm. After returning from
a grueling Southern California
trip, the Cardinal gets a shot at
the Bulldogs today before heading
to Berkeley tomorrow to meet the
red-hot California Golden Bears.
No one could be happier about
the relative calm than Sandra
Birch. The defending NCAA
singles champion has dropped
three of her last four matches
after going undefeated through
the middle of March.
She lost twice on the weekend
to highly-rated players — UCLA's
Jessica Emmons and USC's
Trisha Laux. Coach Frank Bren
nan is not overly concerned.
"Sandra's back," he said after she

dropped a three-set decision to
Laux. "She played very well
today."
Brennan explained that he liked
what he saw Birch doing on the
court and expected her to con
tinue her return to form.
Still, her probable opponent
today is no slouch. Maria Mandez,
a Buenos Aires native, jumped
from off the chart to No. 46 in
the most recent Volvo/
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches As
sociation rankings.
Meredith McGrath will sit out
today's action as she attempts to
rest her injured ankle. The na
tion's top freshman gutted out
two tense matches on the weekend
and may take the top spot from
Birch when the new poll is re
leased later this month.
