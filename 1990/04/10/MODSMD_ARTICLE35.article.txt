# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
The job of selecting The Daily's Athletes
of the Week is never an easy one, but the
task has been made all the more difficult
this spring by the excellence of Stanford's
sports teams. Last week allowance was made
for a third athlete, while this week's winners,
Chryste Gaines and Roger Burnett, won
over some fierce competition.
Gaines, a sophomore from Dallas, finished
second in the 100 meters at the Texas Relays

in Austin last week. In the process, Gaines
set a school record and qualified for NCAAs
with her time of 11.31 seconds.
Yesterday, the Pacific 10 Conference an
nounced it has named the sprinter its Track
and Field Athlete of the Week for track. It
was the first such honor for a Stanford
athlete this year.
Gaines, who was the top high school
sprinter in the country for two years, bet
tered her personal best time by a consider
able .13 seconds. The time was the second
fastest recorded in NCAA competition this
year, behind Carletta Guidry of Texas, who
won the event. The performance strength
ened Gaines' hold on the No. 2 all-time
100-meter ranking in the Pac-10.

Burnett, a sophomore from Broken Arrow,
Okla., apparently made a resolution for
spring quarter. It did not pertain to aca
demics, however, but to baseball; Burnett
must have decided to hit a home run in
every game for the rest of the season.
Overshadowed by teammates Jeff Ham
monds' club-record hitting streak and Stan
Spencer's 9-0 pitching mark, the shortstop
nearly did just that. While going seven-for
sixteen at the plate, Burnett hit a roundtrip
per in each of the first three games last
week.
Despite going hitless in the final game of
the Cardinal's weekend sweep of UCLA, Bur
nett still hit .438 for the week while knock
ing in six runs and scoring seven. On Sat
urday, he keyed a 9-7 Stanford victory by
hitting a two-run homer in the sixth to tie

the game at 6-all and then singling and
scoring the go-ahead run in the eighth. Bur
nett went four-for-four in the contest.
Burnett entered yesterday's game with
San Jose State hitting .279 with five homers
and 24 RBIs.
