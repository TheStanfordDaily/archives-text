# Golfers sixth after first day
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
The Lady Sun Devil at Arizona
State University in Tempe, Ariz.,
is always one of the most com
petitive tournaments of the year
for the women's golf team, and
this year it became even harder
for the Cardinal. After all, before
yesterday, the team had never
even seen the golf course.
However, playing on the brand
new Karsten Golf Course, the Car
dinal showed that they were quick
learners by shooting a combined
score of 309. The performance put
Stanford in sixth place, fourteen
shots behind the leader, host Ar
izona State.
Especially impressive was soph
omore Stephanie Davis, who shot
a two-over-par round of 74, which
was good enough to tie her for
seventh place individually. She is

four shots behind Brandi Burton
of ASU and Carolyn McKenzie of
Oklahoma State, who lead the 92-
golfer field after one round.
Sophomore Audrey Wooding,
who also enjoyed a smooth
opening round on the unfamiliar
course with a 78, knows how
much her home-state teammate
is capable of. "When Steph's on,
she plays a steady game. She
really keeps her concentration and
doesn't let little things distract
her."
One of the strangest aspects of
the course is that, unlike Stanford
Golf Course and most others in
the country, there are no trees at
all. "It took me about five holes
to get used to the course, but then
I was pretty comfortable on it,"
Wooding said.
Comfortable enough to shoot a
round which put her in a tie for

29th place. Stephanie Parel, the
lone senior on the Cardinal squad,
also played well and finished the
round with a five-over 77, tying
her for 19th.
Junior Jodi Figley, who was
looking forward to the new course,
is currently in the middle of the
pack after a round of 80. Ironi
cally, before going to Tempe,
Figley said, "I'm happy that we're
playing a new course, because I
had a lot of trouble at the one
the tournament used to be held
at."
With eighteen out of the top
twenty teams in the country com
peting in the tournament (No. 6
Florida and No. 8 Georgia are the
exceptions), Stanford sixth place
score going into today's second
round puts them in a good posi
tion to improve on their current
No. 10 national ranking.
