# Gymnasts fifth in regionals
## 
### Patrick Tower Staff writer 
After a false alarm last week,
the women's gymnastics team's
season did actually come to an
end over the weekend. Before
bowing out, however, the Cardinal
gymnasts rang up a point total
185.9, the team's second-highest
score of the season, to finish in
a tie for fifth in the NCAA West
ern Regionals.
Pre-meet favorite UCLA took
the regional title, followed by Cal
State-Fullerton, Oregon State and
Washington.
After qualifying in the final
spot for the regionals, the team
was pleased with the overall per
formance. "We were happy about
going from seventh to fifth, and
that was our goal," said Coach
Breck Greenwood.
The outstanding performers of
the meet for the Cardinal were
the seniors on the squad. Co
captain Dina Amoroso tied for
fifth place in the all-around with
a 37.975 and earned Stanford's
sole individual berth at the NCAA
Championships. In addition,
Becky Ashton and co-captain
Susan Banta both scored season
highs on vault.
The Cardinal endured a season
which saw the retirement of two
gymnasts, a career-ending injury
to one team member and a season
ending injury to another, along
with many other untimely mis
haps.
"We were as consistent as I
could have hoped we would be
this year," Greenwood said. "The
transition from the former coach
ing staff to this staff was as well
as could be expected. And the big
gest thing we did this year was
get our emotional act together.
Emotionally, we're really strong."
