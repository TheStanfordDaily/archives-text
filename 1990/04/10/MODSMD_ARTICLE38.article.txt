# Cardinal comes back for win
## 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
It's funny the way things work
out.
Friday night after falling to
USC for the second time this
season, the Stanford men's volley
ball team looked very much like
a squad that would be taking mid
terms while the Final Four was
being played in Virginia. The team
had begun yet another Southern
California road trip in rather
suspect fashion.
But last night's quelling of the
No. 9 Pepperdine Waves coupled
with Saturday's trouncing of No.
10 UC-Santa Barabara allowed
the Cardinal to assemble the final
piece of its own playoff puzzle in
architect-like fashion.
By recording the WIVA confer
ence win 11-15,15-9,15-6,15-12 at
Firestone Fieldhouse, Stanford
can now clinch a playoff position
this weekend in a favorable at
mosphere. The team goes into its

match against No. 1 USC — the
one team it has yet to take a game
from this year — with a full head
of steam, before its home crowd,
with national television coverage
on ESPN.
If Stanford, which has rattled
off two consecutive road victories
against top ten competition, can
defeat the Trojans Friday and No.
6 San Diego State Saturday, the
team will qualify for the WTVA
playoffs with almost frightening
momentum.
After game one last night, how
ever, this scenario hardly seemed
likely to materialize. Pepperdine,
struggling to remain ahead of UC-
Santa Barbara for the final
playoff spot from the Burt
DeGroot division, also approached
the match haunted by season
ending fears.
Amid home supporters, the
Waves seemed best able to settle
their emotions early, hitting .359
in the first game and capitalizing
on inconsistent Cardinal passing.

Effectively diagnosing the situa
tion, Coach Sturm inserted senior
setter Parker Blackman into the
lineup to remedy the mental
aspects and swing hitter Ryan
Moos to address the latter. The
results were instantaneous.
"Parker came in during game
one and got things going," Nieves
said. "He settled the team down,
and they played more confidently.
Even though he had not practiced,
he stepped in like he didn't miss
a beat."
The enhanced conditions were
all the deadly Cardinal triple
threat of Dan Hanan, Dave Goss,
and Duncan Blackman needed.
The three have combined for 60
percent of the squad's total kills
this season and continued the
trend last night. Hanan posted 25
kills and a .500 hitting percentage.
Goss likewise connected 25 times,
while Blackman pelted 21 kills for
a .417 mark.
"I feel we played a very inspi
rational match," Moos said.

Redshlrt freshman Dave Goss helped the Cardinal get up and over the Pepperdine Waves last night
11-15, 15-9, 15-6, 15-12. The outside hitter had 25 kills and a .364 hitting percentage in the win.
