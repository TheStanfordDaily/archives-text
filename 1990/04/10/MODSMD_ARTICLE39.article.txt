# Whitfield charged with battery
## Football star allegedly punched student at Friday party 
### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
A party at Governor's Corner last weekend turned
sour when a freshman was arrested for punching
a sophomore after beer had been splashed around.
According to witnesses, freshman football player
Bob Whitfield punched sophomore Mark Forman
in the nose during the Sigma Nu "Sunsplash" party
on Friday night after Forman threw beer on him.
Forman, a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity, was treated at Stanford Hospital's emer
gency room. He received five stitches.
Whitfield was charged with battery.
"Apparently people were intoxicated and beer was
being thrown around," said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. "It's kind of unclear what exactly
happened."
An eyewitness, sophomore Suzanne Yoder, said

she saw Forman throw beer over his shoulder after
beer was thrown at him. The beer splashed onto
Whitfield and another freshman football player, Be
cket Hinckley. Hinckley spoke with Forman, and
Whitfield apparently asked him for an explanation.
Whitfield and Forman then exchanged words, and
Forman assumed a combative stance, witnesses said.
At that point, Whitfield punched Forman, who
backed away and was taken to the hospital by a
friend shortly thereafter.
Forman declined comment, and Whitfield charac
terized the incident as "a misunderstanding," refus
ing to comment further.
Whitfield, at 6 feet 8 inches and 300 pounds, was
a top college football prospect last year and has
been called a potential All-American by head football
coach Dennis Green.
The Santa Clara County District Attorney will
review the case this week.
