# Multicultural grad housing established
## 
### Dour Fine Staff writer 
After weeks of discussions with graduate
students, University housing officials have
decided to create a graduate multiracial
theme house beginning this fall.
The program, based in the Rains Houses,
will be the first of its kind on campus, and
officials hope it will fill an important niche
in the Stanford graduate student commu
nity.
But students who initially called for the
theme house opposed the plan because it
does not go far enough to meet their de
mands, officials said.
Jean Kim, director of graduate residen
ces, called the new theme house an attempt
to improve interracial understanding.
"Based on a survey, we're confident that
the program will be very popular," Kim
said. "We don't have any preset number
nor any quota for the number of students
who participate in the theme house."
An entire graduate multiracial theme
house was only one of several options which
the administration, working with several
student groups, was considering. Originally,
both Kim and Rodger Whitney, director of
housing, supported the idea of simply

having multicultural clusters, housed
within several graduate residences.
In the end, both the clusters and the
theme house were approved. Three grad
uate residences — Escondido Village,
Crothers Hall and Crothers Memorial Hall
— will have these multiracial clusters.
Not all involved groups are satisfied with
the decision, according to Kim. Among
those dissatisfied with the format of the
new house are members of the United
Graduate Student Alliance, which initiated
the original proposal for a graduate dorm
dedicated to multiracial themes.
Although supporting the idea of an entire
multiracial theme house, the group is un
happy the new theme house will be a part
of the normal graduate housing lottery,
rather than as part of a special post-lottery
draw, Kim said.
The graduate student organization does
not endorse the administration's current
plan, Kim said. Members of the graduate
student alliance could not be reached for
comment.
Kim said up to 10 spots for coordinators
of the multiracial theme house will be set
aside, and she said she hopes interested
students will contact her office if interested
in filling one of those positions.
