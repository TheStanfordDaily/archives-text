# Computer glitch leads to extended RA deadline
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
Due to a "slight glitch" in a computerized
section of this year's resident assistant ap
plication process, the Office of Residential
Education has extended the application
deadline one week to this Friday.
Because of an overload of people trying
to log onto the file server last Thursday
and Friday to make the 1 p.m. Friday
deadline, many potential applicants were
unable to complete the computerized form

on time, according to Claire Dolan, interim
coordinator for the RA selection process
at Res Ed.
"There was some panic on Friday morn
ing" among the RA applicants, said Ann
Porteus, assistant director of Res Ed and
resident fellow at Roble Hall.
In addition, a rough count of the number
of applicants on Friday afternoon turned
up a significantly lower number of students
applying than in previous years, said Dolan.
For the 185 RA positions avail
able, Dolan counted roughly 250
application cards, with another 30
set aside from early applicants
currently studying abroad. This
number compares to 383 appli
cants last year and 420 in 1988,
a 40 percent decrease in just two
years.
Consequently, the decision was
made late Friday to extend the
deadline, Porteus said. However,
a more careful count yesterday
showed that 333 applications had
been received, a less severe
decline.
This is the first year that any
part of the RA application process
has been computerized, according
to Jeff Merriman, director of res
idential computing. The decision
to computerize the system was

'There was some
panic on Friday morn
ing 1 among RA appli
cants, but Res Ed ex
tended the applica
tion deadline one
week.

made to simplify the paperwork
for Res Ed, so that each of the
application sheets would not need
to be typed manually into the
database program, said Dolan.
While the special interest form
of the RA application must be
completed through the computer
network, the other sections, such
as the essays and recommendation
form, are still completed on paper.
The deadline was extended for all
parts of the application.
Merriman added that the Ap
ple Share file server can only ac

commodate 40 to 50 people at a
time. Res Ed had hoped that more
people would copy the program
directly onto their own disks, but
a large number of applicants
decided to fill out the computer
ized form at the last minute, he
said.
In addition, many people did
not completely exit the system
when they were finished filling
out the form, causing delays.
Although the increased speed
and efficiency of the computeri
zation is counteracted by the 15
to 20 hours Merriman estimates
he used to write the program, Res
Ed should be able to use the com
puter program next year "without
major modifications."
"We're hoping to automate
more of the process next year . . .
while working through some of
the glitches," said Merriman, add
ing that the current budget cuts
are requiring more efficient use
of staff time.
