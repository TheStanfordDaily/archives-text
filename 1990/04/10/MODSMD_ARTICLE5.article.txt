Due to a "slight glitch" in a computerized
section of this year's resident assistant ap
plication process, the Office of Residential
Education has extended the application
deadline one week to this Friday.
Because of an overload of people trying
to log onto the file server last Thursday
and Friday to make the 1 p.m. Friday
deadline, many potential applicants were
unable to complete the computerized form

on time, according to Claire Dolan, interim
coordinator for the RA selection process
at Res Ed.
"There was some panic on Friday morn
ing" among the RA applicants, said Ann
Porteus, assistant director of Res Ed and
resident fellow at Roble Hall.
In addition, a rough count of the number
of applicants on Friday afternoon turned
up a significantly lower number of students
applying than in previous years, said Dolan.
