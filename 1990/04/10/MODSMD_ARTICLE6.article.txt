## President Bush tells Stanford senior to promote public service nationwide 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
It all began with a phone call
from the White House.
A little stunned, senior Kim
Grose was asked to become a
founding director of the Points
of Light Initiative Foundation.
She agreed, signed the nec
essary legal documents and
flew to Washington two weeks
ago to stand behind President
Bush with the other founding
directors during a press con
ference. The press conference
was followed by a casual lunch
in the White House with the
president and first lady.
Bush presides as honorary
chair of the Points of Light
Foundation. The main goal of
the foundation is "to have
every individual claim commu
nity problems as their own and
take responsibility for and
work on solving community
problems," Grose said.

Grose is the only student
among the 11 appointed found
ing directors. She speculated
that her involvement with
public service on the national
level, primarily with the Stan-


Kim Grose
ford Project on National Service
and with the Campus Outreach
Opportunity League, brought her
name to the attention of the White
House Office of National Service.
Grose's role in the organization
is still not specifically defined, but
the founding directors will serve
as an umbrella board for eight
mission areas that make up the
Points of Light Initiative Foun
dation.
The board will appoint people
in the various mission areas and
"get the groups off of the ground
and running," Grose said. The
board is also responsible for
guiding policy directives of the
foundation and ensuring that the
objectives are being reached.
Everv two months, the found

ing directors will meet in Wash
ington. Bush also invited the
founding directors to a retreat
this summer at Camp David.
"I was very excited about the
fact that the president of the
United States is taking the lead
ership role in building the service
ethic and realizing that problems
facing communities, such as
poverty, violence and abuse can't
only be solved with federal pro
grams or funding," said Grose.
"Attitudes will change toward so
cial responsibility and civic activ
ism with leadership from the
executive branch."
Grose is an anthropology rmyor
and a Rhodes Scholar. In October,
she will leave for Oxford Univer
sity to study Human Sciences.
Despite her status as a student
among a board made up of cor
porate chairs, foundation presi
dents and"the real power brokers
of America," Grose hopes and

believes that "I as a student will
be taken seriously in my views
and won't be the only young per
son allowed to give those views."
She is, however, concerned with
her position as the "lone young
voice."
"I feel a certain pressure, as I
am the only young person ap
pointed to the foundation, to get
more young people involved. I
want there to be more young
voices and not just mine."
Grose hopes to incorporate stu
dent voices at Stanford in her new
role as founding director.
Grose also discussed her unique
opportunity to observe President
Bush's public and private sides.
"1 felt that I had the chance to
see George Bush as a real states
man and as a family man talking
with his wife and hosting a
friendly luncheon. I was also very
impressed with Mrs. Bush."
