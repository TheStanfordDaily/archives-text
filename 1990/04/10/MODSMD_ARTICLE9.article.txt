# Seeking gold in granola
## Stanford alum Hammer sees breakfast food as big business 
### Mary Sprague 
When Preston Hammer was 6, he sold
candy. At the age of 9, he bought his
own drum set with his earnings. By 15,
he had mowed lawns, shoveled snow,
delivered newspapers, and sold station
ery and Kiwanis fruitcake.
After one year of working at Friend
ly's ice cream, he decided to start his
own painting company. Over six sum
mers, he contracted in excess of $80,000
and employed up to 12 persons per sum
mer. At Stanford, he produced and sold
Farm Side posters and T-shirts and
"Coed naked lacrosse" T-shirts.
Preston Hammer, entrepreneur, 1989
Stanford graduate, former senior class
president, and founder and social chair
of the Sigma Nu fraternity, can never
be accused of not taking advantage of
a money-making opportunity. After the
7.1 rolled through the Bay Area Oct.
17, Hammer sold T-shirts for an easy
profit at $12 a pop.
Hammer has had uncanny success in
business, and it is no wonder that upon

graduation he began to produce and
market another product — but this time
on a much larger scale.
Named after Leland Stanford Jr.,
Leland's Choice Gourmet Granola is
Hammer's latest product.
Hammer's interest in granola began
during his junior year when he was
displaced from seismically unsafe Roble
Hall and moved to Columbae, a vege
tarian co-op known for its homemade
bread and granola.
One time when he was experimenting
with granola-making by throwing in
nuts, oats, honey and other ingredients,
he said he came up with a mixture that
everyone liked, including his fraternity
brothers — who usually do not like
granola.
Later that year, for Industrial Engi
neering 271, "New Enterprise Manage
ment," he had to invent a product and
create a marketing strategy for it. He
used the granola product, and his pro
fessor, Robert Keesley, told him he
should give it a shot for real. But Ham
mer had his mind on other things.

During his senior year, he began in
terviewing with big corporations. How
ever, since he had not worked for anyone
since he was 16, he did not think he
would be satisfied working for another
person.
Getting his product out on the market
was not smooth sailing. He compared
the process to a track meet: He could
see the finish line, but people kept
throwing out more hurdles, whether
they were complications with state or
federal regulations, problems with prod
uct design or availability of ingredients.
Today, he is finally seeing results. He
sold 800 $2.49 snack-size bags of
granola his first week. His granola is
"made of the finest, freshest ingredients
available," Hammer says.
Already Leland's Choice granola is
sold in 20 stores in the Stanford area,
including the Stanford Bookstore and
Tresidder Express. Hammer says he has
distributors lined up in San Francisco
and elsewhere on the Peninsula, but he
wants to see how the product sells on
a smaller scale first.
