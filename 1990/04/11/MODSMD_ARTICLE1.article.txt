# USW march protests firing of Buchanan
## 
### Janine De Fao Editorial staff 
Chanting "Who do we want? Ralph! Who
do we want to get rid of? Su Schaffer!"
nearly 40 United Stanford Workers mem
bers and leaders marched yesterday after
noon to Schaffer's office and to the meeting
place of the Board of Trustees.
The union is protesting last week's firing
of Ralph Buchanan, director of Operations
and Maintenance, and calling for the res
ignation of Schaffer, vice president for ad
ministrative resources.
Schaffer was not in her office when the
marchers arrived, and the march did not
disrupt the trustees' meeting.
At a noon meeting in the University
plumbing shop, USW field representative
Rodney Barnette told workers that Buchan
an's firing indicates a "change in Opera
tions and Maintenance policy" that will
lead to contracting out more workers' jobs.
Barnette said Buchanan had met with
Schaffer to discuss ways to make two
"problem shops" — the labor shop and
garage — more efficient. "But Su Schaffer
said [Buchanan's proposal] wasn't accept
able and implied the only way was to con

tract out the labor shop and garage," Bar
nette said.
Schaffer fired Buchanan last week fol
lowing the disagreement. In a memo, Bu
chanan wrote that SchafTer told him he
"did not have the abilities to lead O&M
through the budget repositioning process."
With the loss of Buchanan, many
workers feel they have lost a voice in the
University. In a letter to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, "concerned Opera
tions and Maintenance employees" said
they object to the firing of Buchanan, who
is "not only a very competent director but
also a very supportive and sympathetic
person."
Auto mechanic Lamont Wiley, who said
he came to Stanford because of job security,
called Buchanan a man of leadership. "If
you get rid of him, you might as well get
rid of the whole organization."
Both Barnette and Linda Crouse, USW
chief steward, claim that Schaffer is in
sensitive to workers' needs and point to
her past employment at United Airlines,
where they claim she was involved in a
"union avoidance campaign."

Nearly 40 members of the United Stanford Workers marched to the office of Su Schaffer yesterday to protest the
firing of Ralph Buchanan, director of Operations and Maintenance. Schaffer, vice president for administrative resources,
dismissed Buchanan last week.
Schaffer said she is very con
cerned about yesterday's events
and will meet with union leaders.
Asked about her history at
United, Schaffer said she was a
supporter of workers, both union
and non-union.
Because Operations and Main
tenance must cut 15 percent from
its current operating budget, the
union fears that cuts will come
in the form of layoffs of low-level
workers.
"If workers are cut rather than
mid-level management, it will cost
the University money," Crouse
said. "They have to cut the fat at
the top, not the muscle at the

bottom."
Schaffer said she needs to ex
amine the entire organization to
determine budget restructuring
and repositioning.
"No group is free from review
in the restructuring process,"
Schaffer said. But she added that
rather than look at the cuts sim
ply in terms of layoffs, she wants
to determine "how [Operations
and Maintenance] can do work as
effectively as possible."
Yesterday's events, Schaffer
said, indicate a "very large strand
of fear running through our
campus everywhere" about
budget cuts.
And workers are afraid. Jim
Keck, a worker in the garage, said,
"I think they'll start [making

cuts] with our shop." He spoke
of a 57-year-old worker named
Billy who has been working in the
shop for 33 years but may now
be forced to retire early, with a
pension of only $300 a year.
Wiley said that he is also
worried about jobs in the garage
where he works.
"There are two older gentlemen
in our shop that have put in a
lot of heart and work and may
be terminated before they want
to," Wiley said.
The workers' march ended on
the steps of Hoover Tower, where
Crouse reiterated that the
workers had "lost confidence [in
SchafTer], questioned her motives,
and believed she was insensitive
to workers."
Chanting "Who do we want? Ralph! Who
do we want to get rid of? Su Schaffer!"
