# USW march protests firing of Buchanan

Chanting "Who do we want? Ralph! Who
do we want to get rid of? Su Schaffer!"
nearly 40 United Stanford Workers mem
bers and leaders marched yesterday after
noon to Schaffer's office and to the meeting
place of the Board of Trustees.
The union is protesting last week's firing
of Ralph Buchanan, director of Operations
and Maintenance, and calling for the res
ignation of Schaffer, vice president for ad
ministrative resources.
Schaffer was not in her office when the
marchers arrived, and the march did not
disrupt the trustees' meeting.
At a noon meeting in the University
plumbing shop, USW field representative
Rodney Barnette told workers that Buchan
an's firing indicates a "change in Opera
tions and Maintenance policy" that will
lead to contracting out more workers' jobs.
Barnette said Buchanan had met with
Schaffer to discuss ways to make two
"problem shops" — the labor shop and
garage — more efficient. "But Su Schaffer
said [Buchanan's proposal] wasn't accept
able and implied the only way was to con

tract out the labor shop and garage," Bar
nette said.
Schaffer fired Buchanan last week fol
lowing the disagreement. In a memo, Bu
chanan wrote that SchafTer told him he
"did not have the abilities to lead O&M
through the budget repositioning process."
With the loss of Buchanan, many
workers feel they have lost a voice in the
University. In a letter to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy, "concerned Opera
tions and Maintenance employees" said
they object to the firing of Buchanan, who
is "not only a very competent director but
also a very supportive and sympathetic
person."
Auto mechanic Lamont Wiley, who said
he came to Stanford because of job security,
called Buchanan a man of leadership. "If
you get rid of him, you might as well get
rid of the whole organization."
Both Barnette and Linda Crouse, USW
chief steward, claim that Schaffer is in
sensitive to workers' needs and point to
her past employment at United Airlines,
where they claim she was involved in a
"union avoidance campaign."

dismissed Buchanan last week.
