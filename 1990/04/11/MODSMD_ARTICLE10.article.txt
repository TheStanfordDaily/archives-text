# Population paradox
## Ehrlich says universities must seek creative solutions to world problems 
### Heidi Ballard 
Speaking to a packed Kresge
Auditorium last night, Biological
Sciences Prof. Paul Ehrlich called
on universities to take a leading

role in solving global population
and environmental problems
through interdisciplinary ap
proaches.
Covering universal topics such
as global warming, overpopula

tion, biodiversity, ozone depletion
and AIDS, Ehrlich stressed that
we must reduce the impact of de
veloped countries on natural re
sources, while carefully con
trolling the development of poorer

countries.
Ehrlich's most recent books,
"The Population Bomb" and"The
Population Explosion" — both
coauthored with his wife, Anne
Ehrlich, who is a senior research
associate in Biological Sciences —
have dealt with these issues.
Ehrlich said that after he wrote
the first book, new environmental
problems erupted that were a
surprise to him. As a result, he
wrote the second book to deal with
these problems, such as the ozone
hole in the polar region and the
incredible increase in tropical
deforestation.
The destruction of the environ
ment will have devastating im
pacts for all creatures on the
earth, as we "saw off the limb
we're sitting on," warned Ehrlich.
The main problem, explained
Ehrlich, is that developed coun
tries have successfully "exported
death control technology but not
birth control technology," as
people in developing countries are
now living longer but are still
having very large families.
Universities must be intellec
tual leaders in the push to find
environmental solutions, Ehrlich
explained, but they cannot follow
the traditional paths of
departmental divisions and poli
tics.
Universities should take away
funding for research and teaching
from departments and give it to
interdisciplinary work, he said.
This diversion of funds would al
low professors to be judged not
on how specific they can delve
into one area of their department,
