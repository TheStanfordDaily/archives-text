# Panel predicts future of Eastern Europe
## 
### Jim Ron Staff writer 
Stanford last night joined in the
world-wide game of predicting Eu
rope's future with a debate by a
top-level panel of Euro-experts
here for a symposium on the Eu
ropean Community and its rela
tions with a rapidly changing
Eastern Europe.
The panel, composed of influen
tial decision-makers and commen

tators from Belgium, Hungary,
West Germany and Italy, warned
that the transition in Eastern Eu
rope from centralized economies
to more liberal, free-market
regimes was without historical
precedent and is fraught with po
tential threats.
"In the past, we didn't like the
system [in Eastern Europe], but
we liked the result, the stability.
Now, we like the system, but we
are afraid of the eventual conse

quences," said Belgian economist
Willy De Clercq, chair of the
Foreign Economic Relations Com
mittee of the European Parlia
ment.
Hungarian economist Andras
Inotai of the World Bank made a
plea for Western economic sup
port, warning that the East Eu
ropean euphoria with successful
political change may turn into
despair if economic conditions
worsen in the near future.

De Clercq indicated that East
ern Europe should not expect to
enter the European Community
in the near future, pointing out
that joining the community would
entail the partial forfeiture of po
litical sovereignty, a move still in
conceivable for former Soviet
satellites.
