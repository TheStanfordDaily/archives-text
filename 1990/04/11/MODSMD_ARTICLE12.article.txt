Bush plays ball
TORONTO (AP) — President Bush and
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney together
tossed out the first balls yesterday to begin
the Toronto Blue Jays' opening game against
Bush's homestate Texas Rangers.
The two smiled broadly as they threw the
balls to a group of ballplayers standing under
the covered Skydome.
Boos were mixed with applause as Bush and
Mulroney came onto the field and a huge
banner reading "Axe the Tax" was plastered
across the bleachers. Mulroney's proposed 7
percent tax on goods and services, passed yes
terday by the House of Commons, is widely
unpopular.
Right posts victory
LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) — Partial
election results yesterday showed a center
right coalition with a large majority in
Slovenia's first multiparty parliament, but the
Communists will remain the largest single
party.
With about 43 percent of the ballots counted
from Sunday's elections, the first in the Yug
solav republic in 45 years, the DEMOS coali
tion of six center-right and conservative parties
had 76.3 percent.
Germans squabble over seats
EAST BERLIN (AP) — East German polit
ical leaders squabbled over the Cabinet seats
still open yesterday as Prime Minister
designate Lothar de Maiziere struggled to form
a broad-based coalition government.
Christian Democrat De Maiziere, who in
tends to lead the fledgling democracy to unity
with West Germany, said he still sought a
consensus on several issues.
Sandinistas issue warning
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — The ruling
Sandinistas said yesterday new fighting could
break out because an agreement between the
newly elected government and Contra rebels
failed to set a deadline for the rebels to disarm.
The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada
and the pro-Sandinista daily El Nuevo Diario
ran editorials and stories dismissing the accord
as a rebel ploy to gain time and influence
before the April 25 change of government. The
accord was reached Monday.
Texans at the polls
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — State Treasurer
Ann Richards seized the early lead over At
torney General Jim Mattox in yesterday's Dem
ocratic gubernatorial runoff, a down-and-dirty
battle that dwelled on allegations of drug use
and dishonesty.
Ms. Richards was seeking to become the
first woman nominated for the state's top job
since Miriam "Ma" Ferguson won the Demo
cratic nod — and later the office — in 1932.
Walesa will not run
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa was quoted yesterday as saying
he will run for president in the next election.
The report by the government news agency
PAP could not immediately be confirmed with
Walesa or his spokesman. Aides and colleagues
of the Solidarity leader have long been saying
he is considering a presidential bid.
Hungary results delayed
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — The release
of official final results in national elections
has been postponed because of irregularities
in several districts, an official said yesterday.
An announcement of final results had been
expected by yesterday. But Janos Nemeth,
chairman of the National Electoral Committee,
told reporters the official tallies would be re
leased at a later date. He did not say when.
Civil unrest reported
KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Thousands of
soldiers patrolled this city yesterday after a
governing party leader was wounded and a
militant opposition leader began a hunger
strike to protest the arrests of his supporters
in the incident.
