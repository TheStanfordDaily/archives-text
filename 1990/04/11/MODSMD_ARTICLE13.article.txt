Let's try again
Riley Foster, a Lockheed pneumatics technician, puts on his white suit
before entering the secured area around the shuttle Discovery at the
Kennedy Space Center. The shuttle mission to launch the Hubble
space telescope was scrubbed yesterday when an auxiliary power unit
failed to operate properly in the final four minutes of the countdown.
The launch will be delayed at least a week as the power unit is
replaced. For more on the shuttle mission see Science, page 7.
