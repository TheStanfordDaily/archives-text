# Abu Nidal terrorists free three hostages

### 
PARIS (AP) â€” The Libyan-backed
Palestinian group headed by Abu Nidal
freed a French woman, a Belgian man
and their young daughter yesterday
after holding them for nearly 2V2
years.
The three arrived to the cheers of
a crowd of relatives and French offi
cials at a military airport outside Paris
late yesterday after a five-hour flight
from Beirut. They had been dropped
off at the French Embassy in the
morning by masked gunmen who ar
rived in cars with drawn curtains.
Jacqueline Valente, 32, Fernand
Houtekins, 43, and their 2-year-old
daughter Sophie-Liberte, born in cap
tivity, made no public statements
though the couple smiled as they got
off the plane. They were taken to a
military hospital to spend their first
night in freedom after 882 days' cap
tivity.
Abu Nidal's group announced Nov.
8, 1987, it had seized the hostages
from the French yacht Silco in the
Mediterranean off the Gaza Strip. It
accused them of collaborating with Is
rael's Mossad intelligence agency.
Friends said the group was on a
holiday cruise.
The French government thanked
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafi
for his role in the release and said
relations with Libya would improve.
Khadafi last week called for the release
of hostages as a humanitarian gesture.
President Bush, in Toronto, said he
didn't know enough about the release
to say whether Khadafi deserves any
credit.
"We've got some major differences
with Libya that continue to exist, but
look, who am I to argue in this case
if someone can help free one hostage?
... Give that person credit," Bush said.
The hostages, released by the Fatah-
Revolutionary Council, used an exec
utive jet in Beirut provided by the
French government to fly to Vil
lacoublay near Paris. Valente was the
first to disembark, followed by
Houtekins, holding their daughter in
his arms. All appeared healthy.
The Fatah-Revolutionary Council
has been blamed for scores of terrorist
acts, including the December 1985 at

tacks on Rome and Vienna airports
that killed more than 20 people.
Because the hostages were believed
to have been held in Libya, the case
is considered unrelated to the 18
Westerners, including eight Ameri
cans, held in Lebanon.
However, Fatah spokesman Walid
Khaled denied assertions that the
hostages had been held in Libya.
Speaking at a news conference in
Beirut, he said the hostages had been
kept in Lebanon.
The State Department welcomed the
release and called for freeing of other
captives.
However, U.S. officials in Washing
ton were critical of France's warm
words for Khadafi. The officials, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said France and other countries should
press Libya to expel Abu Nidal and
his group and stop alleged efforts to
make chemical weapons.
"France is being nicer to Libya than
we think they should be," said one
U.S. official.
The release came a month after
France returned to Libya three
French-made Mirage jet fighters that
had been in France for repairs since
1986. The return of the planes was
blocked by an embargo imposed when
Libya and France backed opposing
sides during the civil war in Chad.
In December, Libya, pressing for
delivery of the aircraft, closed its ports
to French ships.
Khadafi said yesterday that Abu
Nidal's group was "distancing" itself
from its terrorist reputation by releas
ing the hostages, Libya's official news
agency JANA reported.
Last week, Khadafi urged the re
lease of hostages in the Middle East
as a gesture for Ramadan, the Islamic
holy month. He singled out Ms.
Valente.
Khadafi has supported Abu Nidal,
who along with some of his followers
has been convicted of terrorist attacks
abroad. The Libyan leader is believed
to have allowed him to live near the
Libyan capital, Tripoli.
Houtekins said after his release that
four members of his family still held
by the terrorist group are well.
