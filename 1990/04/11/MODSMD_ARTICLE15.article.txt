MOSCOW (AP) — One day after
issuing a harsh new warning to Lith
uanian separatists, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev backed off the
tough line yesterday by declaring he
does not yet see a need to impose
presidential rule.
Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis, responding to the severe
tone of Monday's declaration by the
Kremlin, sent a telegram to Gorbachev
saying he feared that "ultra-rightist
imperial forces are compelling you to
take a wrong step: to continue the

wrongs of the 1940s in the Baltics."
"In the name of peace, justice and
concord on earth, do not do this," he
wrote.
He was referring to the Soviet oc
cupation and forced annexation of the
three Baltic republics — Lithuania,
Estonia, and Latvia — in 1940.
Since March 11, when Lithuania
declared its independence restored, the
Kremlin has repeatedly alternated be
tween threatening and conciliatory
tones. On several occasions, threaten
ing military movements were followed

by kinder words.
Speaking yesterday at a Young Com
munist League congress in Moscow,
Gorbachev said presidential rule would
be used only as an extreme measure
during a civil conflict, the Tass news
agency said. He said Soviet leaders are
still trying to persuade Lithuanians
to rescind their declaration of inde
pendence.
Presidential rule could include mar
tial law and dissolving Lithuania's par
liament. It was elected in March and
is Lithuania's first freely elected par

liament in 50 years.
However, in a meeting yesterday
with British Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd, Gorbachev said, "The
adventurist actions of the current lead
ership can cost the Lithuanian people
themselves, the Soviet Union and
world peace dearly.
In the latest Soviet show of strength,
several tanks rolled through
Gediminas Square in the center of Vil
nius, the Lithuanian capital, overnight
Monday, according to Eduardas
Potasinskas of Lithuanian television.
