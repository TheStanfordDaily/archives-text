Necessity, sufficiency
of new interpretation
need more examination

Following two hours of
testimony to both the value
of free speech and to the
right of freedom from harassment,
members of the Daily editorial
board failed to reach a consensus
on the merits of the Student Con
duct Legislative Council's latest
proposed interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard.
Generally, a consensus is not nec
essary to formulate a Daily edito
rial; majority opinion constitutes
a sufficient basis. In this case, how
ever, three competing viewpoints
emerged, none of which was backed
by a majority of the board.
Thus, in lieu of an editorial in
this space, the Daily editorial board
is providing (on the next page) an
encapsulation of the three strands
of argumentation which arose dur
ing the board's discussion.
The SCLC interpretation at
tempts to define when discrimina
tory verbal or non-verbal abuse
constitutes harassment, thereby
violating the Fundamental Stand
ard.
The diverging opinions regard
ing the interpretation are anchored
by two primary questions: "Is such
an interpretation necessary?" and
"If so, is this particular proposal
sufficient to interpret the Standard
in terms of racially and sexually
discriminatory behavior?"
Put more simply, the two ques
tions about the proposed interpre
tation that must be answered are:
"Is it needed?" and "If so, is it
enough?"
The nature of the SCLC ap
proach of interpretation, reaction
and revision made forging a
coherent editorial all the more dif

ficult. In the abstract, one can
envision opinion on Fundamental
Standard interpretation as run
ning on a continuum from "ab
solutely no restrictions on speech"
to "very rigid restrictions on
speech."
But in the concrete, we are
forced to examine the merits of a
specific proposal, one which can be
rejected from opposing ends of the
continuum.
One could reject the proposal be
cause one feels it places too many
restrictions on speech, or because
one feels it does not place enough
restrictions on speech.
In order to support the proposed
interpretation, one must believe
that the proposal is both necessary
and sufficient.
But, one would reject the pro
posal if one feels the interpretation
is not necessary, or if one feels the
interpretation is necessary but not
sufficient.
Accordingly, two people who
agree that the proposal should be
rejected could have very different
views on how many restrictions
should be placed on speech which
harasses and stigmatizes.
Such was the plight of the Daily
editorial board.
Despite the disagreements, the
board did forge a consensus on one
issue: the handling of Fundamen
tal Standard cases by the Office
of Judicial Affairs.
Judicial Affairs needs to make a
much stronger commitment to up
holding the Fundamental Stand
ard, investigating alleged violations
and rigorously prosecuting those
who violate the Standard — re
gardless of what interpretation, if
any, is eventually accepted.
The comment period on the cur
rent proposal runs until May 4.
Members of the Stanford commu
nity are urged to express their
thoughts on the proposal to the
SCLC and on the Opinions pages
of The Daily.
