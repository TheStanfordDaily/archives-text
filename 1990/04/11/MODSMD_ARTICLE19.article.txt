Letter exaggerated dorms 9 commitment to pluralism

I AM WRITING to express my
continued dismay about how mem
bers of the Stanford community
continue to appoint themselves as the
conscience of the University.
In particular I would like to chal
lenge the myopic views offered by Jay
Jay Kuo in the April 9 Daily. However,
I wish not to provide a laundry list of
what positive things fraternities do but
rather to offer my own assessment as
a member of a housed fraternity who
has moved back into a residence hall.
It strikes me as highly irregular that
students like Kuo (who consider them
selves champions of tolerance and
diversity) show so little tolerance for
students who seek different rewards
from residential life at Stanford. Kuo
is absolutely right in arguing that
some members of frats (as he calls

them) place less of an emphasis on
pluralism than he or his friends do.
But he also overestimates the com
mitment to pluralism that dorm resi
dents have. From my experience living
in a dorm this year, I know several
people who show less interest in multi
culturalism than anyone I have ever
known in my fraternity.
Herein lies Kuo's problem: he fails to
acknowledge that the importance of
pluralism in a student's life is not an
all or nothing position. One can be
committed to promoting equality with
out having to follow a distinct agenda
for action. Furthermore, one's political
opinions are not determined by one's
address.
In the three years that I lived in a
housed fraternity, I knew brothers who
were perhaps among the most commit-

ted to pluralism at Stanford. Fortu
nately, these members were able to
coexist with other less active brothers
without summarily dismissing these
people as "part of the problem."
Kuo's opinion is not much different
than someone saying Stanford should
abolish engineerging majors because
the "techies" don't value the humani
ties. Maybe the techies do value the
humanities but to a lesser degree, and
they do not deserve castration for it.
People at Stanford — and every
where — should have the freedom to
choose their residential environment
without criticism. Kuo has no right to
judge the value of housed fraternities
solely on his own conceptions, just as I
have no right to assess the value of
theme houses by myself.
In fact, Kuo needs to consider tem-

pering his pronouncements in light of
the fact that many students — both
Greek and non-Greek — see value in a
residential fraternity system.
The time has long since come from
for people like Kuo and Otero Resident
Fellow Dennis Mathies to stop trying
to personify fraternities as the root of
evil at Stanford. While I will be the
first to admit that both the United
States' and Stanford's Greek systems
have flaws, there is no reason to
crusade against them.
Perhaps it might be more construc
tive for those highly committed to
pluralism to consider tapping the
resources and organization that housed
fraternities possess to help achieve
progress.
