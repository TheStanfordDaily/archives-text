# University tries to clarify policy on housing for gay couples
## 
### Holly Hacker Staff writer 
After years of gay couples struggling
to obtain the benefits and status of
married student couples, University offi
cials are now trying to revise the housing
policy to better reflect Stanford's policy
of non-discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation.
The current housing policy states that
to obtain married student housing, a cou
ple must be in a marriage legally recog
nized under California state law — and
gay couples are not so recognized. If a
couple is unable to comply, it may petition
for housing.
Granting gay couples married student

status, and thereby allowing a gay stu
dent to live in University housing with
a non-student, has therefore been"the
exception to the rule," Asst. Dean of
Graduate Student Affairs Jean Kim said.
According to Housing Director Rodger
Whitney, while no gay couple has ever
petitioned and been denied University
housing, "some students are hoping for
a more explicit policy."
"The language in the housing bro
chures doesn't indicate that [married stu
dent housing for gay students] is
available," said law student Susan Miz
ner, who petitioned to live with a non
student. "If you can't comply with the
rules, you must petition. I don't think
others read that as an invitation."

Tom Henning, an officer of the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter, agreed. "Part of the issue is making
the policy more sensitive to same-sex cou
ples," he explained. As the policy now
stands, "many gay couples are likely to
assume Stanford won't give a damn about
you."
Above all, Henning said, the policy
needs to be clarified and publicized so
that "people can be aware of it."
Although the University grants gay
couples married student housing status
"by exception," Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said "that may not be quite
enough."
"We're not getting talented students
here when they quickly learn they can't

bring someone they've been living with
for two or three years," Lyons said.
In addition, Mizner said, because many
remain unaware of the opportunity to
petition, "gay couples pay a very high
price at Stanford. Most end up moving
to the city, coming in for classes and not
contributing in any way to the Univer
sity" outside the classroom.
Mizner now lives in married student
housing with her partner, a non-student.
While the University has been "a big
help" in granting them married student
housing and giving both her and her
partner health insurance, Stanford does
not grant the partners of gay graduate
students a spouse card, which allows
them acceas to University libraries, ath

letic facilities and certain health benefits.
"My lover left her home 3,000 miles
away to come here and found she couldn't
even get into the library," she said.
Law student Ed Swanson said, "A lot
of folks here have had a good deal of
trouble not having spouse cards, because
they can't do the things most people's
partners can do."
Kim said the Graduate Housing Advi
sory Committee has "endorsed the con
cept" of clarifying and amending the
housing policy, "but it needs to be coming
down as a policy from the top," including
the president and Board of Trustees.
While the housing policy issue is on
the agenda for these officials to
discuss later in the quarter, Kim
said the committee has talked to
deans in the meantime to garner
support.
Lyons said he favors the policy
changes. However, he cautioned,
"Stanford can't get in the busi
ness of substituting for the state"
in determining "what a commit
ted relationship is and how it is
defined."
While the issue is a "policy
problem," Lyons stressed that
"more importantly, it's a human
problem. Some people now feel
like second-class citizens."
The problem is also one of logic,

'More importantly, it's
a human problem.
Some people now
feel like second-class
citizens.'

according to Lyons. "If you extend
privileges to same-sex couples and
not heterosexual unmarried ones,
don't you create another prob
lem?" he asked.
Lyons said he would like to see
not only gay students be given
married status housing and
benefits, but also that "unmarried
couples may, under certain cir
cumstances, have these benefits."
The only remaining problem is

how to determine "what consti
tutes commitment," he said.
Mizner said the gay community
has made "fantastic progress" this
year in negotiating with the Uni
versity. But as Henning noted,
University President Donald
Kennedy's recent abolishing of the
Administrative Council, which
was comprised of Kennedy and
the vice presidents, means that
the gay community is "not sure
of its status" with the University.
In spite of last week's abolition
of the council, Swanson said he
is still "very hopeful the issue will
be resolved before the end of
May."
Lyons said that while he has
encountered a few "questions and
skepticism" from various officials,
he too "would like to see some
thing resolved in May."

bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter, agreed. "Part of the issue is making
the policy more sensitive to same-sex cou
ples," he explained. As the policy now
stands, "many gay couples are likely to
assume Stanford won't give a damn about
you."
Above all, Henning said, the policy
needs to be clarified and publicized so
that "people can be aware of it."
Although the University grants gay
couples married student housing status
"by exception," Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said "that may not be quite
enough."
"We're not getting talented students
here when they quickly learn they can't

bring someone they've been living with
for two or three years," Lyons said.
In addition, Mizner said, because many
remain unaware of the opportunity to
petition, "gay couples pay a very high
price at Stanford. Most end up moving
to the city, coming in for classes and not
contributing in any way to the Univer
sity" outside the classroom.
Mizner now lives in married student
housing with her partner, a non-student.
While the University has been "a big
help" in granting them married student
housing and giving both her and her
partner health insurance, Stanford does
not grant the partners of gay graduate
students a spouse card, which allows
them acceas to University libraries, ath

letic facilities and certain health benefits.
"My lover left her home 3,000 miles
away to come here and found she couldn't
even get into the library," she said.
Law student Ed Swanson said, "A lot
of folks here have had a good deal of
trouble not having spouse cards, because
they can't do the things most people's
partners can do."
Kim said the Graduate Housing Advi
sory Committee has "endorsed the con
cept" of clarifying and amending the
housing policy, "but it needs to be coming
down as a policy from the top," including
the president and Board of Trustees.
While the housing policy issue is on
the agenda for these officials to
discuss later in the quarter, Kim
said the committee has talked to
deans in the meantime to garner
support.
Lyons said he favors the policy
changes. However, he cautioned,
"Stanford can't get in the busi
ness of substituting for the state"
in determining "what a commit
ted relationship is and how it is
defined."
While the issue is a "policy
problem," Lyons stressed that
"more importantly, it's a human
problem. Some people now feel
like second-class citizens."
The problem is also one of logic,

'More importantly, it's
a human problem.
Some people now
feel like second-class
citizens.'

according to Lyons. "If you extend
privileges to same-sex couples and
not heterosexual unmarried ones,
don't you create another prob
lem?" he asked.
Lyons said he would like to see
not only gay students be given
married status housing and
benefits, but also that "unmarried
couples may, under certain cir
cumstances, have these benefits."
The only remaining problem is

how to determine "what consti
tutes commitment," he said.
Mizner said the gay community
has made "fantastic progress" this
year in negotiating with the Uni
versity. But as Henning noted,
University President Donald
Kennedy's recent abolishing of the
Administrative Council, which
was comprised of Kennedy and
the vice presidents, means that
the gay community is "not sure
of its status" with the University.
In spite of last week's abolition
of the council, Swanson said he
is still "very hopeful the issue will
be resolved before the end of
May."
Lyons said that while he has
encountered a few "questions and
skepticism" from various officials,
he too "would like to see some
thing resolved in May."
