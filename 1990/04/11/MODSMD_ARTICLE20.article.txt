# Offensive speech proposal contains fundamental flaws
## 
### 
The new Student Conduct Legislative
Council proposal is not only flawed in
technical ways but is flawed in princi
ple.
The way to combat racism is not
through legislation but through educa
tion. Banning racist speech will not get
rid of racism. Furthermore, attempts
to ban "racist" speech may also
encroach on other free expression.
The alleged intent behind the new
proposal is to both ban offensive
speech as well as to make it clear what
kind of speech is allowable. Both are
admirable goals. According to the dis
cussions we have had, all speech not
specifically designated as a violation
under the new proposal should be

protected.
The new proposal hedges on this
slightly by saying "prohibited harass
ment includes" rather than "is" but
this is a minor technicality. But accord
ing to the intent of the proposal all
speech not specifically prohibited by
this legislation is not a violation of the
Fundamental Standard.
Unfortunately, far too much "offen
sive" speech is still allowed. As men
tioned in the original article in The
Daily, saying to a black student "your
mother is a nigger" is allowable.
Similarly, other forms of direct, face
to face verbal abuse, as long as it does
not use the prohibited epithets de
scribed in the proposal, will also be
allowed. All that this proposal ac
complishes is to require my creative
insults relying on phrases and words
not "commonly understood to convey
direct and visceral hatred or contempt
for humans beings on the basis of
their sex ..."
The main fault with the proposal

lies in the fact that, if it is indeed
meant to prevent the silencing already
felt by certain groups on this campus
in which people are afraid to express
views that are not "politically correct,"
then the proposal must be precise and
must allow all other forms of speech.
However, no precise proposal will be
comprehensive, and much hateful and
offensive speech will consequently be
allowable.
It is my belief that freedom of
speech is an important and inalienable
right. Certain expressions of free
speech can be offensive and hurtful.
In keeping with the Fundamental
Standard, intentional infliction of men
tal or physical harm by one student
upon another should not be tolerated.
But trying to put down exactly what
words or what "type" of words must
be prohibited is misguided and coun
terproductive.
I believe that each case must be
treated individually and precedents
built up. The precise interaction among

words, circumstances, intent, etc. can
not be legislated and must be dealt
with on an individual case-by-case
basis.
