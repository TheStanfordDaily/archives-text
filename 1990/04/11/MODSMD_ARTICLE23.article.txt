## Accepting cultural roots 
### 
I'VE JUST RETURNED from New
York where I was doing some inter
viewing. While in the Big Apple, I
stayed with the family of a friend whom
I met at Stanford. This was a black family
that spoke Creole, listened to Patsy Kline
and watched old biblical movies. And I
thought all black families spoke slang,
listened to Aretha Franklin and watched
the Cosby Show.
Actually, I already knew that wasn't
the case for all black families, but there
are a lot of folks out there, including
black folks, who think there is a Webster's
definition of black. Living with this fam
ily reminds me that there is multicul
turalism in the black community, that
black people are as varied as any other
group of people, if not more so.
"Tell me something I don't know," you
might say. The problem is that a lot of
black folks, especially on this campus,
have forgotten just how diverse our com
munity is. Sure, blacks are quick to
remind whites that we are not one big
monolith, that we don't all look, act or
think the same way, but we've been so
busy reminding white folks that we've
forgotten ourselves.
One thing that I won't forget is the
"blacklist" that circulated around campus
my freshman year, and that still exists
today. It was a "list" of black students
who were judged (by whom I don't know)
to be oreos, psuedo, whitewashed. Appar
ently, those on the list didn't fit the mold
of a typical black person, whatever that
is.
My friend was one of the students who
was included on this list. Ironically, my

friend is one of the "blackest" persons I
know, in the sense that she is very proud
of her African heritage, and she and her
family reflect a strong African culture.
More than that, my friend is also proud
of her American culture. She's not down
with baseball, apple pie and all that, but
she has embraced her American culture,
including its aesthetic, language and in
tellectual tradition. And for this, I
suspect, she made the blacklist.
African-American. That term has got
ten a lot of use these days. It's a beautiful
name, but some of us, in our endless
effort to be "politically correct," have as
sumed the term without fully under
standing its implications.
As part African, we have a historical
and cultural link with African people,
and like it or not, as Americans, we have
ties with European culture.
Unfortunately, many of us have not
come to terms with our European heri
tage, and how it has negatively and posi
tively affected our African heritage. The
result, as we're all familiar with, is a
"blacker-than-thou" attitude which is ex
pressed in terms such as the blacklist,
which in turn serves to chastise those
persons, such as my friend, who perhaps
have reconciled their dual identity and
proudly express their African and Euro
pean cultures.
Until we come to terms with both of
our heritages, we will continue to deny
what it truly means to be an African-
American. Sylvia Wynter, chair of
African-American Studies, reminds us
that not only are we seen as black, but
we are also seen as Americans.

Like it or not, as Ameri
cans, African-Americans
have ties with European
culture.

So when America fails, so do we. There
fore, we can't afford to disconnect our
selves from this country. This is difficult
to say without fearing being misun
derstood. I am not suggesting that we
stop challenging or trying to change
America, and I am certainly not advo
cating assimilation. However, if we are
going to call ourselves African-
Americans, then we have to claim our
European heritage.
As important as it is for blacks to claim
their European culture, it is just as im
portant for whites to acknowledge their
African influences. Whites have to rec
ognize that their culture is also shaped
by an African heritage, as well as an
Asian, Hispanic and Native American
heritage. Having done this, then we'll all
be one step closer to the multicultural
society that I hope we're trying to
achieve.
