# Interpretations
## NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT The
						Daily Editorial Board Statement requires further evaluation, elimination of ambiguities 
### 
WHAT KIND OF image is Stan
ford projecting if even at
Ujamaa, the black theme
house, black students cannot live free
from prejudice and racial slurs?
Not a very positive image, that's for
sure. Considering that the incident at
Ujamaa was investigated but went
unpunished, the need for the Univer
sity to make a clear statement that
this type of racist behavior is not
acceptable is long overdue.
Because of incidents such as this
one, students are searching for as
surance that they can live in this
community without fear of castigation

for their lifestyles or cultures.
The Student Conduct Legislative
Council's recent proposal for interpret
ing the Fundamental Standard is a
postive step toward guaranteeing this
assurance. The proposed interpretation
would give members of the community
the security of a written policy to
protect them from derogatory slurs.
The University is taking a step in
the right direction with this proposal,
but it is only the beginning. As the
proposal stands, it is sufficient for a
short-term solution because there is an
immediate need for a new definition of
the existing policy.

However, to establish a standard
that will endure, the University needs
to continue to evaluate and improve on
this statement. Although it is an im
provement on the current policy, the
proposal still contains many am
biguities that must be clarified.
Violators of the Fundamental Stand
ard could use these vague points to
manipulate the policy to their advan
tage. Changes need to be made so that
regardless of who is interpreting it, the
interpretation of the Standard will
allow members of the community to
live as they choose without persecu
tion.

Students are searching for
assurance that they can
live in this community
without fear of castigation
for their lifestyles-

There are many who argue that this
policy violates their right to freedom of
speech.
The proposal does limit free speech,

but only to the point that it upholds
the right of every student on this
campus to have the option of par
ticipating in any of the opportunities
Stanford offers. The hate speech that
now does not violate the Standard
violates the rights of those at whom it
is aimed.
This proposal for changes in the
Fundamental Standard should be
adopted as policy, but the discussion of
this issue cannot end here.
