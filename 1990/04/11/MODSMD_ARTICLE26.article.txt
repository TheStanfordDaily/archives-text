# NOT NECESSARY
## Enforcement only solution 
### 
THE SCLC'S PROPOSAL for a
new Fundamental Standard
interpretation fails to achieve its
stated goal of prohibiting verbal har
rassment while protecting free speech,
and it is doubtful if any re
interpretation would suffice. The prob
lem is not with the rules that prohibit
racist or otherwise abusive speech, but
rather with their recent non
enforcement.
The existing Fundamental Standard
states that "students at Stanford are
expected to show . . . such respect for
order, morality, personal honor and the
rights of others as is demanded of
gpod citizens." It goes on to state that
failure to do so is grounds for expul
sion.
Harrassment, personal villification
and racial attacks would all seem to be
clear violations of respect for order, the
rights of others, and the rest. The fact
that events such as last year's Otero
incident (in which a resident repeatedly
burled abusive language at a homo
sexual Resident Assistant) are not
treated as Fundamental Standard
violations reflects a failure on the part
of the University to treat such inci
dents as the odious lapses of decent
conduct that they are.
•Instead, the response has been to
draw tip new interpretations of the
Fundamental Standard that use byzan
tine logic and wording to tiptoe the
line between destroying free speech and
being completely ineffective.
The current proposal is the latest
failed attempt in this regard. In trying
to identify offensive speech, the pro
posal sets up three guidelines that
open a Pandora's Box of counter
examples and bizarre interpretations.
Under the proposed interpretation,

In fact, the new rules may
give students a larger
cloud to hide behind.

using offensive word x in saying "You
are x" is a violation, but "Your mother
is x" is not, as it is not directed at the
person it stigmatizes as required by
the second clause.
Will endless linguistic arguments
such as this serve the cause of non
harrassment or free speech? Absolutely
not.
Some may claim that the interpreta
tion needs to be broader. They are
correct in that the most broad possible
interpretation is the existing Standard
itself, which implicitly prohibits all
offensive acts that the proposed inter
pretation tries to deal with.
That this has not been evident in
the recent past has more to do with a
weakness of the Judicial Affairs Office
more than with a weakness of the
rules.
In fact, the new rules may give
students a larger cloud to hide behind.
Both the Otero vigil and the Ujamaa
incident, the two events which sparked
the free speech debate, would probably
still not be covered under the Grey
interpretation because they did not
involve "fighting words."
It is the discretion of the people who
are enforcing the Fundamental Stand
ard that we need to change. Only then
will the nauseating incidents that have
provoked this debate be justifiably
punished.
