# NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT
## Proposal is perfect balance

OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES
once wrote, "The most stringent
protection of free speech would
not protect a man in falsely shouting
fire in a theater and causing a panic."
That statement by the U.S. Supreme
Court justice set the trend for First
Amendment cases until the present day.
Free speech is a necessity if it does not
cause an immediate breach of the
peace.
In Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
the Court ruled that so-called "fighting
words" are not protected under the
First Amendment. This standard in the
Thomas Grey proposal is now the one
adopted by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council to determine
whether certain speech is punishable
under the Fundamental Standard.
This standard is a very judicious
one, because it protects minorities
from direct attacks intended to in
timidate or harass them. Fighting
words or symbols, such as clenched
fists, constitute the strong possibility
of an immediate breach of peace, i.e. a
fight, and thus should not be given
full protection under the First Amend
ment.
As a private university, Stanford has
no legal obligation to uphold a stand
ard required by the U.S. Supreme
Court, but Stanford has a moral obli
gation to do anything necessary to
protect the freedom to debate contro
versial and sometimes offensive views.
That is thoroughly consistent with the
current Fundamental Standard propos
al, as long as the University's judicial
affairs officer upholds the intent of the
currently applicable Supreme Court
decisions.
This interpretation, I believe, gives
ore the right to post a Beethoven

caricature on one's own bulletin board
(posting it on another's is a separate
question, and as such, the Ujamaa
incident might be prosecuted under
this standard).
The repugnant Otero vigil, in which
Phi Delta Theta fraternity members
acted with ignorant abandon, would
also be protected. Jesse Jackson's
public anti-Semitic statements, as
offensive as they are to many Jews,
would be protected under the
Chaplinsky ruling if he were a student.
This proposal also gives students the
right to perform research along the
vein of the late William Shockley's
misguided work, which purported to
show that blacks were inferior to
whites.
One may argue that the First
Amendment under current interpreta
tion does not protect the basic right
for minorities to be heard over the
loud voices of oppression. However,
minority communities are the groups
that have historically gained the most
from the First Amendment. The right
to speak and assemble freely was one
of the fundamental Constitutional
privileges that allowed the Civil Rights
movement to flourish.
Recalling the open tradition of that
movement, Stanford should meet the
heavy burden of proof that speech is
directly intimidating before it should
be prosecuted. We cannot wield the
Fundamental Standard every time we
encounter vile speech, but we also
cannot turn a deaf ear toward in
timidating speech based on a discrimi
natory premise.
