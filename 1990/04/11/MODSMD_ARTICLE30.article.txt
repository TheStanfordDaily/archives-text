## New brain signal system discovered 
### Joanna Sosinska Staff writer 
One-hundred years ago in a
dimly-lit research laboratory,
scientists marvelled at the dis
covery of the neuron, the
transmitter of intelligence. Re
cently, a team of Stanford
neurobiologists relived this
wonder while watching electric
signals flash across a video
screen. These signals, actually
propagating calcium waves,
suggested the existence of a
second transmission network
within the brain.
This secondary communica
tion system is composed of
astrocytes, a special type of
brain cell discovered in the late
19th century. They are part of
the glial cells that make up
half the mass of the brain.
Unlike neurons, astrocytes
were long thought to perform
only a simple maintenance role
in the brain. They aid brain
development and help
metabolize ions and
neurotransmitters. They also
help keep neurons healthy and
alive.
Stephen Smith, associate
professor of molecular and cel
lular physiology, says "recent
research has indicated that
astrocytes are actually more ac
tive then was thought possi
ble."
Astrocytes may be responsi
ble for long-distance signalling
within the brain as well. By
sending calcium waves from
cell to cell, astrocytes are able
to communicate with one an
other.
Like nerve cells, the network
of astrocytes is regulated by
glutamate, the main excitatory
neurotransmitter in the brain.
Glutamate acts as an agent
in the process of chemical sig
nalling between brain cells. It
normally floats between nerve
cells and attaches itself to spe
cial receptors along the outer
cell wall.
Once bound to the receptor,
glutamate excites the cell by
acting on certain synapses —
gaps where neurotransmitters

and hormones are released —
thereby increasing the calcium
concentration. Glutamate
changes the shape of brain cell
receptors it binds to, and there
fore, it plays a role in the com
putations of the brain. "The
entire system is activated by
glutamate," says Smith.
Yale University's Ann
Cornell-Bell, a researcher in
Smith's former laboratory, pre
viously found that astrocytes
possess glutamate-sensitive ion
channels. This finding only
hinted at a possible signalling
role for these cells.
The possibility that
astrocytes may play a role in
rapid inter-cellular transmis
sion was only confirmed after
a recent discovery that
glutamate induces calcium
waves in these cells.
This finding was actually not
intentional. "We were trying to
find out what happens when
you die or have a stroke. Ex
cessive amounts of glutamate
kill neurons," says Smith.
"We were working with sam
ples cultured from the brain
tissue of young rats," says
Smith. "And one of the samples
happened to contain some glial
cells as well."
To the researchers' surprise,
cultured rat astrocytes
responded to glutamate just
like other nerve cells with a
prompt and oscillatory eleva
tion of free calcium in the cells.
This calcium frequently
propagated as waves within the
cytoplasm of individual
astrocytes and between neigh
boring astrocytes.
Smith and Cornell-Bell,
along with Steven Finkbeiner
of Yale and Mark Cooper of
Stanford, were able to measure
and record the glutamate
induced fluorescence changes
with video and laser micro
scopes.
"The finding opens up new
possibilities. It has shown that
ast rocytes may Ko part nor to
the neuron in the brain's com
putation and that they are not
just good for housekeeping,"
Smith says.
