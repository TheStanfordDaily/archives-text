# Telescope will bring past to light

NASA hopes to launch a type
of time machine when the space
shuttle Discovery blasts off next
week, carrying with it one of
man's greatest scientific ac
complishments.
The Discovery will be carrying
a 12-ton telescope, called the
Hubble Space Telescope, which
will revolutionize modern
astronomy.
The powerful solar-powered
telescope will be able to see at
least 12 billion light-years away,
and thus enable scientists to see
objects in the universe as they
existed 12 billion years ago.
Orbiting the Earth every 90
minutes, 380 miles above the at
mosphere, the 43-foot Hubble
space telescope will be able to
detect stars 50 times fainter than
earthbound telescopes and see
other objects with 10 times finer
detail than previously possible.
The Hubble telescope is a
scientific breakthrough. Accord
ing to Electrical Engineering Prof.
Von Eshleman, "This is a major
experiment."
"It is a high cost experiment,
but it is needed for certain jobs,"
he said. "I am glad to see it in
orbit; it will be a new eye in space.
It will be excellent for observing
the planets, though its main job
is to look far beyond that."
"It is one kind of . . . [direction]
that will be important for the fu
ture," he added.
As NASA scientist Stephen
Maran told the Los Angeles
Times, "This is one of those in
credible milestones. This is some
thing that literally hundreds of
astronomers have been working
on and hundreds are waiting for
the chance to work on it."
The telescope was named after
Edwin Hubble, an astronomer
whose observations more than 60
years ago helped modern-day
astronomers to estimate the age
of the universe.
In the past, NASA has launched
several unmanned space probes,
such as the Vikings, Voyagers,
Mariners and Pioneers, without
inridpnt. This mission, though, is
so complex that the Discovery
must be manned in order to as
sure that the Hubble telescope is
properly placed. The telescope's
intricate mechanisms would not

be able to withstand the higher
acceleration of an unmanned
launch.
Further, the equipment on the
Hubble telescope is so complex
that any errors that occur during
launching can only be repaired by
humans on board the ship.
The telescope has been 20 years
in the planning, and that time
has enabled many technologically
advanced instruments to be added
to it.
The type of equipment on board
the Hubble telescope falls into
three categories: the scientific in
struments, the support systems
module and the optical telescope
assembly.
The scientific instruments in
clude two cameras. The first, a
Wide Field/Planetary camera, will
perform two main functions, as
the name suggests. It will be able
to see hundreds of galaxies at once
and focus in great detail on
planets of our solar system. Hope
fully, this camera will aid scien
tists in determining the age of
the universe and will help look
for planetary systems other than
our own.
The second camera is a Faint

Object camera. It will be the
camera that will get images that
are sharper and brighter than was
ever before possible.
Also among the scientific in
struments on board are two
spectrographs. Spectrographs are
used by scientists to determine
such qualities as the chemical
composition and temperature of
the object being viewed.
A photometer, an instrument
that measures the brightness of
objects being studied, is also on
board the Hubble.
The support systems module
consists mainly of the exterior
structure and design of the
Hubble telescope. The telescope
itself is wrapped in a foil-like
multi-layer insulation. In order to
prevent overheating, it is
equipped with a metallic silver
surface.
The optical telescope assembly
consists primarily of the mirrors
within the telescope.
The primary mirror is 94 inches
in diameter and is the smoothest
large mirror ever made. It is made
of precision-ground glass and is
coated with an aluminum reflect
ing surface.

The secondary mirror is 13
inches in diameter and is posi
tioned 16 feet in front of the pri
mary mirror.
It is crucial that these mirrors
remain aligned in the hostile en
vironment of outer space. Thus,
a special truss structure on board
the Hubble telescope will hold the
mirrors a precise distance from
each other.
Over the next 15 years, it is
hoped that the Hubble telescope
will allow scientists to see a view
of the universe that is at least
125 times the size that any
earthbound telescope could
produce.
Hopefully, the data that the
Hubble telescope provides can be
used to help astronomers answer
age-old questions about our uni
verse.
The Discovery was supposed to
be launched yesterday morning.
However, due to a problem with
one of Discovery's Auxiliary
Power Units, the launch was
scrapped four minutes before lift
off. It should be a week or two
before another launch attempt,
NASA officials reported.
The crew of five astronauts is
Air Force Col. Loren Shriver, the
commander; Marine Col. Charles
Bolden, the pilot; mission special
ists Steven Hawley and Kathryn
Sullivan; and Navy Capt. Bruce
McCandless.
If all goes according to plan,
about 24 hours after launch
Hawley will prepare to set the
Hubble into orbit.
Using a long manipulator arm
from the ship's cargo bay, he will
move the telescope and ready it
for its release into space.
Then, mission control at God
dard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md. will direct the
Hubble to open its solar panels
— the telescope's primary source
of power. Its observation instru
ments will be switched on, and its
radio antenna will be ready to
communicate with the Earth.
After three days in orbit, the
Hubble will expose its mirrors to
space, and only then will it begin
to receive pictures from outer
space. Only at this time will
astronomers back on earth know
whether or not the telescope can
see.
For 15 years, the Hubble tele
scope will remain in outer space
— our eye to the mysteries of
faraway worlds.

on the shuttle Discovery and will enable astronomers to see farther
than ever before.
