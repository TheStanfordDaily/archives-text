f~\,My roommate says that whenever
\Y • the television is on, it makes a
high-pitched whine that drives her crazy,
but I don't hear anything. What is going
on?
A. Either your roommate doesn't like
• Oprah, or she is hearing a sound
that all televisions make. This sound is
produced by the electronics which scan
the electron beam in the picture tube
from left to right, forming the lines of
the picture. This horizontal retrace oc
curs 15,750 times a second, producing

a tone which is at the upper edge of the
range of human hearing.
Loud noise damages the sensory cells
which allow you to hear high frequen
cies. As you get older, this cumulative
damage lowers the highest pitch that
you can hear. The more loud noise that
you are exposed to, the faster you lose
high-frequency hearing. Eventually, the
television's 15,750-cycle whistle becomes
inaudible to many people.
If the whistle really bothers your
roommate, you can either turn off the
television or buy her a front row seat
for a Metallica concert.
, Why does my beer go skunky after
Vy •it has sat around a time? I thought
that most beer was pasteurized.
A. The process which causes beer to
• become skunky is not the result
of the action of any living organism on
the beer. According to Hal McGee in
"On Food and Cooking," the hops which
give beer its distinctive bitter flavor con
tain a resin called humulone.
Humulone reacts with natural sulfur
containing compounds in the beer to
produce isopentenyl mercaptan. This
substance's pungency strongly resembles
the heady aroma of skunk.
This reaction occurs spontaneously at
a slow rate, but is greatly accelerated
by visible light. In full sunlight, a clear
bottle of beer may become skunky over
the course of a ball game.
However, the pigments in colored glass
absorb some of the light and signifi
cantly retard the reaction rate. This ex
plains why most good beers are shipped
in colored glass bottles and why Miller
tastes so bad.
