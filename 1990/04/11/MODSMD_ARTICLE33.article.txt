# Tandy puts power in your lap

Every once in a while a new product
comes along that makes one wonder,
"Why? The old one was perfectly fine."
Such is the case with the Tandy 1100,
the latest low-cost laptop from the folks
down at Radio Shack.
Its predecessor, the Tandy 200, was
an excellent machine for those needing
easy-to-use, easy-to-carry word process
ing on the go. The 200 came with a
built-in modem, a tolerable screen and
a price tag of around $800 — including
the carrying case.
It ran for a couple of hours on four
AA batteries and you could change them
on the fly without losing any data. Best
of all, everything was stored in random
access memory. Though the processing
power made the computer operate like
a turtle, data was saved instantly.
The 200 was standard issue for jour
nalists, as indispensable as the pen and
notebook. It was also popular with stu
dents and with businesspeople who
loved its compactness.
A few months ago Tandy discontinued
the 200 to make way for the 1100. In
the interim, potential purchasers were
forced to turn to more expensive offer
ings from firms such as Grid or more
complex offerings from Toshiba.
Recently Tandy introduced the 1100
at $999 with a national ad campaign
in a number of high-visibility
magazines. The important question is:
Was it worth the wait? The answer, as
might be expected, is a qualified yes.
The 1100 is far more capable than
the machine it replaces. An MS-DOS
compatible, the 1100 can run tens of
thousands of readily-available software
packages including the übiquitous Lotus

1-2-3 and WordPerfect.
But for those needing
nothing more than a basic
word processor or spread
sheet, Tandy has provided
those programs free of
charge. The 1100 also
comes with Desk Mate, a
Macintosh-like desktop
environment, built into
read only memory.
When you turn it on, it

boots Desk Mate from a mythical C:
drive and you can run the word proc
essor without inserting a disk. You will
need a disk to store your documents.
That's not a problem for experienced
computer users, but it takes some time
for 200 veterans to get accustomed.
Still, the benefits outweigh the draw
backs. A standard 3-inch disk can hold
720 kilobytes of information, over 20
times as much as the 200 could store
in RAM. Spell checking is also in ROM.
While the word processor lacks some
standard functions, like a keyboard
combination to move ahead one word,
it is quite capable.
A telecommunications program, GW
BASIC and a calendar/scheduler are
among the included software. It's all
solid, though unspectacular.
The new liquid crystal display is a
godsend. Though it lacks backlighting,
it has much higher resolution than the
200 and can display a 21-line, 80-column
screen plus a menu bar. An optional
internal modem at $199 can operate at
speeds up to 2,400 baud instead of 300
baud in the 200.
The new lead-acid battery allows four
hours of AC free operation and an ad
ditional pack can be purchased for $40.
You could go from 9-to-5 without plug
ging in. Since it's not a nickel cadmium

battery, recharging can be
performed in erratic
spurts without fear of
shortened battery life.
NiCads have a tendency
to get hooked on charging
and hold their charge for
shorter and shorter peri
ods of time.
If you're out of charge
though, you're out of luck.
Nothing was simpler than

replacing the AAs in the 200. Changing
packs is a snap, literally, but you better
have the spare charged and ready to go.
While the keyboard will hardly con
jure up visions of an IBM Selectric, it
is a significant improvement over the
200. As with virtually all laptops, it is
a little too small for most full-sized
hands.
Having DOS is terrific and no doubt
expands the potential customer base of
the machine tenfold. Many users,
though, will never need to see the A>
prompt.
There are serial and parallel ports on
the back of the machine so adding a
mouse or hooking up a printer is
simplicity at its best.
Journalists will still love this machine
despite a glitch in the modem works
that makes hooking up with home base
a bit more difficult. You have to dial
the call manually if you want to use a
credit card number and it is not easy
to switch from voice to data.
All in all, the new functionality and
reasonable price — under $1,400 in
cluding computer, modem, blank disks
and a spiffy new carrying case — mean
Tandy will sell a lot more of the new
computer.
If you're in the market, give it a
look-see.
