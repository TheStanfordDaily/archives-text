## Netters take bark out of Bulldogs in warm-up for Cal 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
Normally, the women's tennis
team might play Fresno State
early in the season as a tune-up
for the tough Pacific 10 Confer
ence schedule.

Women's Tennis

Cardinal 8

Bulldogs 1

Normally, the Cardinal would
rout the Bulldogs 9-0 and Coach
Frank Brennan would say some
nice words about how everyone
played and how well things are
looking.
Instead, the match was played
yesterday — just 24 hours before
a showdown with the red hot Cal
ifornia Golden Bears. While Stan
ford did triumph by a resounding
8-1 score, dropping nary a set

along the way, Brennan had a lot
to be worried about when play
was complete.
Sandra Birch and Debbie
Graham were leading 1-0 in the
first set of the No. 1 doubles
match when Graham rushed in
to hit a backhand. The shot went
for a winner, but Graham tripped
over Birch and went down on her
left knee, sustaining a nasty
bruise.
She also sprained both wrists
slightly as she used them to break
her fall. "She's going to be real
sore," said Brennan relaying the
words of trainers Patti Millson
and Rickey Hayes. Both thought
it unlikely she would be able to
play today.
"It was a great match until
Debbie went down," Brennan said.
"We don't normally [play Fresno]
in the middle of the season. Early
on, I thought, 'This worked out
pretty well. The girls are sharp.' "
Sharp as nails. The steamroller

began on the farthest court as
freshman Mario Carruth made
the most of a rare playing oppor
tunity to trounce Corey Hill 6-1,
6-0. A notch up in the lineup,
Kylie Johnson hammered Karen
Farquhar 6-0, 6-1.
Lisa Green continued her hot
play from Saturday, routing
Valerie Stukovsky 6-2, 6-0. Fresh
man Heather Willens continues
to sizzle as well. She hammered
Tara Eden 6-3, 6-2.
Graham was in top form as she
toasted Ceciel Bourdais 6-3, 6-1.
Finally, Birch ended her two
match losing streak with a 6-2,
6-2 pasting of Maria Mendez.
Throughout the match, a frus
trated Mendez entertained the
crowd by exclaiming in Spanish.
In doubles action, the Cardinal
tandems made short work of their
Bulldog foes. Carruth and
Johnson scored a 6-3, 6-4 decision
over Stukovsky and Farquhar.
With Meredith McGrath getting
a day off and Green having a late
afternoon class, Willens was
slated to team with Teri Whit
linger. But Whitlinger, who had
a class of her own, was late in
arriving and Carina Rolley nearly
stepped in.
Finally, Whitlinger showed up,
took the court immediately and
helped Willens massacre Eden and

Hill 6-2, 6-0.
Brennan said if Graham had
full mobility she could play. "If
not, I feel very confident in Kylie
Johnson. She was terrific last
year and she'll get her chance to

plug back in."
Graham could opt to play dou
bles only, where her absence from
the No. 2 team creates a major
hole. In the event she cannot do
that either, Brennan said the duo

will be "Sandra and somebody."
The somebody will also probably
be Johnson. Whether they would
play at No. 2 or No. 3, with Green-
Willens shifting up, is yet to be
determined.

Heather Widens' 6-3, 6-2 downing of Fresno State's Tara Eden helped the Cardinal roll to a 8-1
warm-up for today's Big Match. The No. 1 Cardinal brings a 57-match winning streak into the contest
with the streaking Bears.
