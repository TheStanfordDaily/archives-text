# Teen-ager Capriati the answer to American tennis' dream
## 
### 
If she plays, I want to know about it.
Who was her opponent? Did she win?
What was the score? How long was
the match?
It doesn't matter that she just turned
14. She is still in junior high school but
is already such a captivating figure that
I can't get enough. She is the brightest
light on the American women's tennis
scene since Tracy Austin.
Her every move is an event.
Jennifer Capriati is a dream come t rue.
When she first began to receive na
tional publicity last year, I was worried.
How can they call a girl who has played
exactly zero tournaments "The Next
Chris Evert?" How do they know she
can compete with the world's best
players? Will she be crushed by the ex
pectations?
They can. She can. Doubtful.
One of the things that made Evert so
great was her longevity. She dominated
an era. There is no way to project that
far into Capriati's future. But consider
this: If she plays for the next 15 years,
she can retire at the ripe old age of 29.
That would mean little if she weren't
near the top of the rankings all the way
through. If her early performance is any
indication, you can take that to the bank.
After just playing in three professional
events Capriati's tennis resume is stun
ning. She has reached the finals twice.
She is 13-3 overall, 3-2 against top-10
players. In the Family Circle Cup, she

destroyed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario —
one of the world's best clay court players
— on clay.
She debuted on the Women's Tennis
Association computer ranking at No. 25.
She has demonstrated the skill necessary
to beat all but the top handful of players
in the world. By year's end, look for her
to be ranked just below them.
Capriati already stands at 5-foot-6 and
has exceptional strength. By the time she
has finished growing, look for her to be
5-10. How does that stack up? Martina
Navratilova, a tennis legend (or "ledge"
in Capriati-speak), is 5-9.
Navratilova says she is "more polished"
at this stage than Steffi Graf was.
Best of all, though, is the way Capriati
handles herself — and the way her family
and friends handle her. Her father,
Stefano, is protective but not overbear
ing. He makes certain that family time
is closed to outsiders. Capriati says when
she is with her friends from school, they
treat her like plain ol' Jennifer.

To top it off, she is charming with the
media, says all the right things about
avoiding burnout and understands her
siginificant place in the sport.
When Evert called her America's best
hope for the future, Capriati said: "Hear
ing it from Chris Evert, that's an honor
for her to be saying that. It does give
me confidence to know that I could bring
America's tennis up, that I can make it
better and bring it back."
Austin once stood where Capriati is
now, but physical problems did her in.
Andrea Jaeger was there, too. Today she
the case study in Burnout 101. Graf, of
course, ascended gracefully to the pin
nacle of the sport. Capriati could be the
first player born in the United States to
be ranked No. 1 in a decade, but where
does she fit in?
"She's physically closer to her potential
than Andrea or Tracy or Steffi were at
that age," Navratilova said. "She hits the
ball harder on both sides. Steffi was hit
ting it hardest one way. But Jennifer hits
it hard off both sides.
"The thing that impresses me the most
is her pace and her poise," Navratilova
added. "But when you're 14 you don't
know any better. You just hit the ball as
hard as you can. If it goes in, great. If
it doesn't, oh well, you've got 15 years
ahead of you. So it's not that big a deal
when you miss."
Capriati doesn't miss often, but she
still has a few things to learn. In the

Family Circle semifinals, her opponent
Natalia Zvereva hit a ball that landed on
the line. The linesman called it out.
Capriati thought it was in, walked over
to the chair umpire and extended her
hand, palm down, to signal that the ball
was good.
The umpire reversed the call and gave
the point to Zvereva. It was a mag
nanimous gesture considering that
Capriati went on to win the match. Nav
ratilova, however, noted that few others
would have been sporting enough to do
the same.
Few threaten to dominate the sport
into the next century, either. Welcome,
Jennifer Capriati, we've been waiting a
long time for you.
Jennifer Capriati is a nightmare in
the making.
By the time she is a high school
senior, she'll probably have a French
Open trophy and a plate from Wimbledon
sitting atop her dresser. Talk about po
tential and levelheadness; she seems to
have an unlimited supply of both?
So what's the problem?
Capriati is a one-in-a-million talent.
Make that one in 10 million. It may
actually make sense for her to be playing
professional tennis at age 14. She has
already signed an endorsement contract
with a clothing manufacturer that should
set her up financially for the rest of her
life.

In just a month on the tour, she has
garnered over $60,000 in winnings. That
works out to three-quarters of a million
per annum. Good woik.if yuu can get it.
Unfortunately, few can get it. There
are too many young tennis players who
have passed up the chance at a free college
education to turn professional. Some
have done very well.
Tami Whitlinger, who would be a junior
here this year had she remained in school,
could win over $100,000 in prize money
in 1990. Subracting expenses from that
total, she is still making a good living.
Patty Fendick, Stanford Class of '87,
stayed in school for four years. This year,
she has earned more than twice as much
as Whitlinger. Recently, Fendick sus
tained a knee injury that forced her out
of action. If she never recovers (the prog
nosis is excellent), she has a Stanford
degree and all that comes with it.
At least both went to college.
Capriati's success is dangerous not to
herself, but to others. Seduced by delu
sions they can achieve what she has,
many young women may choose to skip
college altogether and head straight for
the circuit.
On any given day, any one of them
could blow out a knee and have it all
come to an end. When sophomore Debbie
Graham went crashing to the asphalt
yesterday, the fragility of it all become
readily apparent. Graham will be fine.
As for the others, who knows?

be ranked No. 1 in a decade, but where
does she fit in?
"She's physically closer to her potential
than Andrea or Tracy or Steffi were at
that age," Navratilova said. "She hits the
ball harder on both sides. Steffi was hit
ting it hardest one way. But Jennifer hits
it hard off both sides.
"The thing that impresses me the most
is her pace and her poise," Navratilova
added. "But when you're 14 you don't
know any better. You just hit the ball as
hard as you can. If it goes in, great. If
it doesn't, oh well, you've got 15 years
ahead of you. So it's not that big a deal
when you miss."
Capriati doesn't miss often, but she
still has a few things to learn. In the

Family Circle semifinals, her opponent
Natalia Zvereva hit a ball that landed on
the line. The linesman called it out.
Capriati thought it was in, walked over
to the chair umpire and extended her
hand, palm down, to signal that the ball
was good.
The umpire reversed the call and gave
the point to Zvereva. It was a mag
nanimous gesture considering that
Capriati went on to win the match. Nav
ratilova, however, noted that few others
would have been sporting enough to do
the same.
Few threaten to dominate the sport
into the next century, either. Welcome,
Jennifer Capriati, we've been waiting a
long time for you.
Jennifer Capriati is a nightmare in
the making.
By the time she is a high school
senior, she'll probably have a French
Open trophy and a plate from Wimbledon
sitting atop her dresser. Talk about po
tential and levelheadness; she seems to
have an unlimited supply of both?
So what's the problem?
Capriati is a one-in-a-million talent.
Make that one in 10 million. It may
actually make sense for her to be playing
professional tennis at age 14. She has
already signed an endorsement contract
with a clothing manufacturer that should
set her up financially for the rest of her
life.

In just a month on the tour, she has
garnered over $60,000 in winnings. That
works out to three-quarters of a million
per annum. Good woik.if yuu can get it.
Unfortunately, few can get it. There
are too many young tennis players who
have passed up the chance at a free college
education to turn professional. Some
have done very well.
Tami Whitlinger, who would be a junior
here this year had she remained in school,
could win over $100,000 in prize money
in 1990. Subracting expenses from that
total, she is still making a good living.
Patty Fendick, Stanford Class of '87,
stayed in school for four years. This year,
she has earned more than twice as much
as Whitlinger. Recently, Fendick sus
tained a knee injury that forced her out
of action. If she never recovers (the prog
nosis is excellent), she has a Stanford
degree and all that comes with it.
At least both went to college.
Capriati's success is dangerous not to
herself, but to others. Seduced by delu
sions they can achieve what she has,
many young women may choose to skip
college altogether and head straight for
the circuit.
On any given day, any one of them
could blow out a knee and have it all
come to an end. When sophomore Debbie
Graham went crashing to the asphalt
yesterday, the fragility of it all become
readily apparent. Graham will be fine.
As for the others, who knows?

If she plays, I want to know about it.
Who was her opponent? Did she win?
What was the score? How long was
the match?
It doesn't matter that she just turned
14. She is still in junior high school but
is already such a captivating figure that
I can't get enough. She is the brightest
light on the American women's tennis
scene since Tracy Austin.
Her every move is an event.
Jennifer Capriati is a dream come t rue.
When she first began to receive na
tional publicity last year, I was worried.
How can they call a girl who has played
exactly zero tournaments "The Next
Chris Evert?" How do they know she
can compete with the world's best
players? Will she be crushed by the ex
pectations?
They can. She can. Doubtful.
One of the things that made Evert so
great was her longevity. She dominated
an era. There is no way to project that
far into Capriati's future. But consider
this: If she plays for the next 15 years,
she can retire at the ripe old age of 29.
That would mean little if she weren't
near the top of the rankings all the way
through. If her early performance is any
indication, you can take that to the bank.
After just playing in three professional
events Capriati's tennis resume is stun
ning. She has reached the finals twice.
She is 13-3 overall, 3-2 against top-10
players. In the Family Circle Cup, she

destroyed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario —
one of the world's best clay court players
— on clay.
She debuted on the Women's Tennis
Association computer ranking at No. 25.
She has demonstrated the skill necessary
to beat all but the top handful of players
in the world. By year's end, look for her
to be ranked just below them.
Capriati already stands at 5-foot-6 and
has exceptional strength. By the time she
has finished growing, look for her to be
5-10. How does that stack up? Martina
Navratilova, a tennis legend (or "ledge"
in Capriati-speak), is 5-9.
Navratilova says she is "more polished"
at this stage than Steffi Graf was.
Best of all, though, is the way Capriati
handles herself — and the way her family
and friends handle her. Her father,
Stefano, is protective but not overbear
ing. He makes certain that family time
is closed to outsiders. Capriati says when
she is with her friends from school, they
treat her like plain ol' Jennifer.

To top it off, she is charming with the
media, says all the right things about
avoiding burnout and understands her
siginificant place in the sport.
When Evert called her America's best
hope for the future, Capriati said: "Hear
ing it from Chris Evert, that's an honor
for her to be saying that. It does give
me confidence to know that I could bring
America's tennis up, that I can make it
better and bring it back."
Austin once stood where Capriati is
now, but physical problems did her in.
Andrea Jaeger was there, too. Today she
the case study in Burnout 101. Graf, of
course, ascended gracefully to the pin
nacle of the sport. Capriati could be the
first player born in the United States to
be ranked No. 1 in a decade, but where
does she fit in?
"She's physically closer to her potential
