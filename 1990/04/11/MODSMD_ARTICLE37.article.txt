# Steady Solomon keeps the pace
## Men's tennis squad looks to focused junior as top-ranked Cardinal takes on No. 2 California in season showdown 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Glenn Solomon has never relied on phys
ical strength to overcome opponents.
He has never had a big serve. His volleys
have never been as crisp as he would like.
But the Cardinal junior has been starting
consistently for the past two years on the
best team in college tennis. He has two
national championships under his belt and
hopes to add two more.
Besides that, if you ask most opponents
who they would least like to play on Stan
ford's team, the name "Glenn Solomon"
would pop up a disporportionate amount
of times.
Why the success? In one word, concen
tration.
"Glenn doesn't let his mind wander on
the court," Coach Dick Gould said. "He
doesn't give up easy points. If the guy he's
playing gives up a few loose points, the
next thing you know Glenn has won the
set."
"I'm the first to admit that I don't have
the overwhelming physical strength of a
Jonathan Stark or an Alexis Hombrecher.
But I have learned to win in other ways,"
Solomon said. "It's my game to make my
opponent hit that extra ball. When I'm
playing well, I don't give up any free
points."

board, Solomon doesn't seem to miss. In

races around the court, retreiving ball after
ball â€” each time with the same precise
stroke. He probes for weaknesses; he waits
for mistakes; he never gives up.
Solomon, who has tallied a 13-3 record
playing in the No. 3 through No. 5 spots
this year, has taken the same never-say-die
attitude into the classroom. Even on a team
with a G.P.A. over 3.2, Solomon stands
out, recording a 3.7 over the past three
years.
Solomon asserts that playing competitive
tennis has only helped him academically.
"To compete on a national collegiate level
and in the pro ranks, you have to learn
how to deal with adversity and how to
perform well even when not everything is
going your way. You learn how to adjust
and how to find ways to achieve. Compet

Although not big or overwhelming like some of his teammates, Glenn Solomon's consistency and concentration have
helped make him one of the feared members of the very succesful men's tennis squad.
