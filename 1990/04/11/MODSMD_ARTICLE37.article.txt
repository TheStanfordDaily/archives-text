# Steady Solomon keeps the pace
## Men's tennis squad looks to focused junior as top-ranked Cardinal takes on No. 2 California in season showdown 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Glenn Solomon has never relied on phys
ical strength to overcome opponents.
He has never had a big serve. His volleys
have never been as crisp as he would like.
But the Cardinal junior has been starting
consistently for the past two years on the
best team in college tennis. He has two
national championships under his belt and
hopes to add two more.
Besides that, if you ask most opponents
who they would least like to play on Stan
ford's team, the name "Glenn Solomon"
would pop up a disporportionate amount
of times.
Why the success? In one word, concen
tration.
"Glenn doesn't let his mind wander on
the court," Coach Dick Gould said. "He
doesn't give up easy points. If the guy he's
playing gives up a few loose points, the
next thing you know Glenn has won the
set."
"I'm the first to admit that I don't have
the overwhelming physical strength of a
Jonathan Stark or an Alexis Hombrecher.
But I have learned to win in other ways,"
Solomon said. "It's my game to make my
opponent hit that extra ball. When I'm
playing well, I don't give up any free
points."
Anyone who watches Solomon realizes
immediately how frustrating it must be to
play the New York native. Like a back
board, Solomon doesn't seem to miss. In
his trademark red Stanford hat, Solomon

races around the court, retreiving ball after
ball — each time with the same precise
stroke. He probes for weaknesses; he waits
for mistakes; he never gives up.
Solomon, who has tallied a 13-3 record
playing in the No. 3 through No. 5 spots
this year, has taken the same never-say-die
attitude into the classroom. Even on a team
with a G.P.A. over 3.2, Solomon stands
out, recording a 3.7 over the past three
years.
Solomon asserts that playing competitive
tennis has only helped him academically.
"To compete on a national collegiate level
and in the pro ranks, you have to learn
how to deal with adversity and how to
perform well even when not everything is
going your way. You learn how to adjust
and how to find ways to achieve. Compet
itive tennis has definitely helped me in the

classroom," Solomon said. "In the
end, it taught me how to be a
competitor."
"There's no question he's a
great student," Asst. Coach John
Whitlinger said. "He takes great
pride in how well he does in the
classroom and how well he does
on the tennis court. It is a tribute
to how hard he works in both
areas."
Unlike many athletes, Solomon
has tried to keep tennis in per
spective.
Although he would like to play
professionally for a few years after
college, Solomon does not look at
tennis as a future career possibil
ity. "Largely because I am at Stan
ford and I have gotten to play
with such great tennis players, I
have realized that I probably
couldn't be as good a pro as I
might like to be," Solomon said.
Solomon said he probably will
attend law school and, later, work
in some capacity in the public sec
tor.
Solomon came to Stanford with
some impressive tennis creditials.
Ranked No. 12 in the country by
the United States Tennis Associ
ation, Solomon was undefeated
from his sophomore to his senior
year in high school. He also was

valedictorian of his class.
He chose Stanford over Harvard
and California because he
"wanted a top academic school but
also the opportunity to play for
a top-level tennis program."
Solomon, who will play in the
No. 4 spot against California
today, recorded perhaps his most
impressive showing in the Na
tional Collegiate Classic in Palm
Springs earlier this year. Solomon
ended up winning the consolation
bracket of the prestigious tourna
ment, downing Kentucky's No. 1-
ranked player, John Yancey, 6-4,
6-2 in the consolation finals.
In the meantime, what Solomon
would like more than anything is
a win over No. 2-ranked Califor
nia.
"Anytime we play Cal, it's al
ways an challenge," Solomon said.
"We have that added incentive be
cause of the school rivalry. Besides
that, we know a lot of the guys
on their team. We know that they
are good and that makes it a little
tougher."
Both Solomon and Gould en
courage students to come out and
watch the two best teams in the
country slug it out. "It always
helps when you have people
screaming for you," Solomon said.

"Glenn doesn't let his mind wander on
the court," Coach Dick Gould said. "He
doesn't give up easy points. If the guy he's
playing gives up a few loose points, the
next thing you know Glenn has won the
set."
"I'm the first to admit that I don't have
the overwhelming physical strength of a
Jonathan Stark or an Alexis Hombrecher.
But I have learned to win in other ways,"
Solomon said. "It's my game to make my
opponent hit that extra ball. When I'm
playing well, I don't give up any free
points."

races around the court, retreiving ball after
ball — each time with the same precise
stroke. He probes for weaknesses; he waits
for mistakes; he never gives up.
Solomon, who has tallied a 13-3 record
playing in the No. 3 through No. 5 spots
this year, has taken the same never-say-die
attitude into the classroom. Even on a team
with a G.P.A. over 3.2, Solomon stands
out, recording a 3.7 over the past three
years.
Solomon asserts that playing competitive
tennis has only helped him academically.
"To compete on a national collegiate level
and in the pro ranks, you have to learn
how to deal with adversity and how to
perform well even when not everything is
going your way. You learn how to adjust
and how to find ways to achieve. Compet

Although not big or overwhelming like some of his teammates, Glenn Solomon's consistency and concentration have
helped make him one of the feared members of the very succesful men's tennis squad.

end, it taught me how to be a
competitor."
"There's no question he's a
great student," Asst. Coach John
Whitlinger said. "He takes great
pride in how well he does in the
classroom and how well he does
on the tennis court. It is a tribute
to how hard he works in both
areas."
Unlike many athletes, Solomon
has tried to keep tennis in per
spective.
Although he would like to play
professionally for a few years after
college, Solomon does not look at
tennis as a future career possibil
ity. "Largely because I am at Stan
ford and I have gotten to play
with such great tennis players, I
have realized that I probably
couldn't be as good a pro as I
might like to be," Solomon said.
Solomon said he probably will
attend law school and, later, work
in some capacity in the public sec
tor.
Solomon came to Stanford with
some impressive tennis creditials.
Ranked No. 12 in the country by
the United States Tennis Associ
ation, Solomon was undefeated
from his sophomore to his senior
year in high school. He also was

valedictorian of his class.
He chose Stanford over Harvard
and California because he
"wanted a top academic school but
also the opportunity to play for
a top-level tennis program."
Solomon, who will play in the
No. 4 spot against California
today, recorded perhaps his most
impressive showing in the Na
tional Collegiate Classic in Palm
Springs earlier this year. Solomon
ended up winning the consolation
bracket of the prestigious tourna
ment, downing Kentucky's No. 1-
ranked player, John Yancey, 6-4,
6-2 in the consolation finals.
In the meantime, what Solomon
would like more than anything is
a win over No. 2-ranked Califor
nia.
"Anytime we play Cal, it's al
ways an challenge," Solomon said.
"We have that added incentive be
cause of the school rivalry. Besides
that, we know a lot of the guys
on their team. We know that they
are good and that makes it a little
tougher."
Both Solomon and Gould en
courage students to come out and
watch the two best teams in the
country slug it out. "It always
helps when you have people
screaming for you," Solomon said.
Admission to today's California
match at 1:30 p.m. in Stanford
Tennis Stadium is free to students
with Stanford identification.
