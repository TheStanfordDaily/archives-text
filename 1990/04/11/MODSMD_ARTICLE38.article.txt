# Second round drops linksters into eighth
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
According to Coach Tim
Baldwin, the women's golf team
played as well yesterday in the
second round of the Lady Sun
Devil as they did the day before
when they finished in sixth place.
But according to the scorecard,
the team wasn't quite up to par,
as they finished with a round of
318, nine shots behind the day
before, which left them in eighth
place in the tournament.
The difference? Well, Mother
Nature may have played a little
part. Make that, a big part.
"There were some strong winds
yesterday morning," Baldwin
said. "We played about the same,
but the conditions were really,
really tough."
Senior Stephanie Parel's game
was especially affected by the
winds, as she shot a round of 84
after an impressive opening day
score of 77. Sophomore Audrey
Wooding also saw her score drop
after she had an uncharacteristic
round of 82 yesterday.
After two rounds, the Cardinal's
score of 627 has put them in
eighth place, well behind host Ar
izona State, which has a com
manding lead over the rest of the
18-team field.
Nevertheless, Baldwin seems
pretty confident going into today's
final round of play. "Tomorrow,
we're going to play very well, and
hopefully the winds won't be that
bad."
One of the reasons for his op
timism has to be the play of soph
omore Stephanie Davis, whose
two round total of 152 has placed
her in a tie for 12th place indi
vidually.
"Stephanie's playing with the
best players in the country, and
she's holding her own," Baldwin
said.

Baldwin added that, "the first
day she putted really well and
that helped her finish with a two
over-par 74 . Yesterday she had
a bit of difficulty putting, but she
still played rather well."
Another reason Baldwin is
looking forward to today's round
is that after yesterday's disap
pointing performance, the entire
team got together and practiced
after competition ended.
"The practice showed how ded
icated and really concentrated the
team is," Baldwin said. "Usually,
the entire team doesn't get to
gether to practice after a round,"
Baldwin said, "But they really
want to do well tomorrow."
Despite the fact that the team
is currently ranked No. 10 in the
country and 17 teams make it
into the NCAA tournament at the
end of the year, Baldwin feels this
tournament is critical for the
team's post-season plans.
"Tomorrow's round is really im
portant for us if we want to make
the NCAAs. It's definitely one of
the most important rounds of the
year for us. We need to do well."
If the team is to come through,
then they will have to make more
adjustment to the Karsten golf
course which is quite diverse from
the Stanford links they are used
to playing on. As Wooding ex
plained, "The greens are really
hard which means it's hard to
keep the ball on them. The greens
at Stanford, on the other hand,
are soft, so you can shoot the ball
right at them."
Another difference is that there
are no trees on the course. "It
does look kind of funny without
the trees," Baldwin said. "It really
is a desert course."
After two rounds on the course,
the team is confident of its ability
to adjust, and as Baldwin said,
"We'll give it our best tomorrow."
