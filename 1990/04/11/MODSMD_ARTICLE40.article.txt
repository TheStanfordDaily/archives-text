# Athletic department cuts result of spiraling scholarship costs
##

Bigger is not always better. In some
cases it can be self-consuming.
In an effort to remain the most broadly
based athletic program west of the Mis
sissippi River, the Stanford Department
of Athletics has dug itself a $1 million
hole, out of which it is currently trying
to climb. As a result, four sports have
either suffered cut-backs or were elimi
nated from what has proven itself to be
the most successful college sports pro
gram in the nation.
Why is the department faced with this
predicament?
The department's deficit can be attrib
uted to the enormous cost of funding
athletic scholarships at Stanford ($5.67
million for the 1989-90 academic year).
"The problem of funding the scholarship
base has become all-consuming. We need
to figure out a way to cope with this
tremendous problem," Athletic Director
Andy Geiger said
Quite simply, the fund raising efforts
of the Athletics Department have not
been able to keep pace with the inflating
cost of a Stanford education.
John Kates, the Director of Major Gifts
to the Athletics Department, said, "It is
simply that the cost of a full ride, and
the fact that we believe so strongly in a
broad-based athletic program, means that
it is going to cost us more than any other
school."
In the 1970's the Buck Club — the
branch of development devoted to raising
funds for athletic scholarships — was not
only able to meet the cost of scholarships,
but it was able to exceed that cost.
"For many years we greatly exceeded
what the need was and were able to put
that money in reserves," Kates stated.
The funding of athletic scholarships
first became a challenge when Stanford

began awarding women's athletic schol
arships in 1978.
"There is no one in the [athletic] de
partment or in the university that doesn't
think that was the right way to go,"
Kates said. "But the fact does remain
that our financial aid bill literally in
creased overnight by over 50 percent."
According to Kates, the Buck/Cardinal
Club was able to maintain underwriting
the cost of scholarships until the fiscal
year of 1983-84. It was then that the
department found it necessary to draw
on its reserves from the surplus years,
and this led to the current situation.
The Athletics Department now must
balance its budget.
The easiest solution to the problem
would be a plan to split the funding of
athletic scholarships between the univer
sity and the Athletics Department. A pro
gram where the university funds an
athlete's scholarship based on financial
need, and the Athletics Department pays
for the remainder, has been suggested by
Athletics Department officials.
Although the university is very sup
portive of athletics, helping to fund schol
arships is not one of the ways in which
it can aid the Athletics Department, due
to the department's status as an auxiliary
enterprise.
"We treat the athletics as an auxiliary
activity," Vice President and Provost
James Rosse said. "That means they have
a good deal of autonomy in the way they
operate."
An auxiliary enterprise pays an over
head bill to the university in order to
use its land and buildings. In return the
it is free from interference from the uni
versity while running its business, but
this means that it is also unable to receive
the university's help when money is
scarce, putting the Athletic Department
into its current bind.
Additionally, when an auxiliary enter-

prise gives a student fi
nancial aid based on
merit, it eliminates the
student from considera
tion for university aid
based on financial need.
The only funding that
the Athletics Department
has received from the
university for intercolle
giate athletics is

s27s,ooo over the past three years in
order to help fund the Athletics Depart
ment's non-scholarship Varsity II sports.
So the Athletics Department is being
forced to look elsewhere to find the
money it needs to reach financial equi
librium, namely the Buck/Cardinal Club.
Although the club must intensify its
fund raising efforts, it is not as though
the club has had lackluster performances
in the past, however.
"The irony is that we do a better job
raising money than any other athletic
department in the country," Kates said
"We raise more money and our needs are
greater."
According to Kates, the Buck/Cardinal
Club is currently trying to find long-term
solutions to the funding problem.
"We are trying to endow a whole lot
of new scholarships at $100,000 and up,"
he said. "The reason that's so important
is because it will pay forever. For every
endowed scholarship we raise, the amount
we have to raise on an annual basis is
reduced."
The problem with this tactic is finding
donors whose pockets arc deep enough
to endow a scholarship on the spot. Some
people choose to endow a scholarship in
installments paid over several years.
Kates said that these gifts help in the
long run, but they take time to come to
fruition.
According to Kates, several people have
left large sums of money to the Stanford

There isn't any manual or
handbook about how to
get smaller. You just take a
look at where is the major
activity.'

Athletics Department in their wills, but
these funds do not "mature" until the
donor passes away.
The other fund raising strategy is the
DAPER (Department of Athletics, Phys
ical Education, and Recreation) Invest
ment Eund which currently stands at
about $10 million. The majority of this
money is ambitiously invested in start-up
companies and venture capital. The
return on these investments has been
much greater than the interest rate
earned on the department's endowment.
According to Geiger, the Athletics De
partment's endowment currently is a little
over $40 million. An increase in the
amount of interest paid on this monev
will help.
Right now it [the interest rate] is at
4.75 percent, said Geiger. "If we can get
it to seven (percent] for two years, 6 for
two years, and 5 for two years, by the
mid-90s we'll be back at equilibrium, pro
viding the university doesn't go back to
double-digit inflation."
In the mean time, several painful cut
backs had to be made in order to give
the department a chance to balance its
ledger.
I he cuts have been made in two areas:
staff and sports.
According to Geiger, the cutbacks in
staff will save the department approxi
mately $400,000.
I he sports which suffered from the
budget trimming were field hockey, wres-

tling, sailing, and track and field. Geiger
said there was no established criteria on
which to base his decisions about cutting
sports.
"There isn't any manual or handbook
about how to get smaller," he said. "You
just take a look at where is the mzyor
activity — where's the interest."
In the case of field hockey Geiger said,
"There are four field hockey teams west
of lowa and it's not a growth sport. It's
a sport that's decreasing in participation.
It is more than a financial change, it is
reflecting a demographic change."
Geiger said that the cuts in wrestling
will be a change in the source of funding
for the program. Instead of using depart
ment funds, the wrestling team will have
to rely on the money raised by the team's
support network.
Stanford Wrestling Coach Chris Hor
pel's salary currently comes from teach
ing weight lifting classes as well as
operating Encina weight room. However,
he will no longer be paid to coach wres
tling, but will take on additional admin
istrative duties.
Sailing has been reduced to a club
sport, which means it will only be funded
by the participants in the sport and any
money which they can raise.
The cuts in track and field will be
realised as the athletes who are currently
on scholarship graduate. In the next four
years, the number of scholarships for
track and field will decrease by 25,
leaving only scholarships for those who
could qualify for the NCAA meet.
The methods to eliminate the budget
deficit are short-term cuts, while the
techniques used to prevent its recurrence
are long-term investments. Stanford's
present athletes and staff are having to
endure hardship so as much of a good
thing as possible can not only survive,
but thrive.
