# Will Austin go to Boston?
## Law professor offered visiting spot here, may be first black woman tenured by Harvard 
### Jennifer Paley 
While Harvard law students have rallied
to keep her at their university, Stanford
Law School has offered Regina Austin a
position as a visiting professor for the 1991-
92 academic year.
A tenured professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, Austin would be the first
black woman to receive tenure at Harvard
Law School if she is given a position there
at the end of the 1990-91 year.
She is currently a visiting law professor
at Harvard, where she teaches insurance
law and tort law. If she accepts Stanford's

invitation, she may teach a seminar on
intentional torts, which include racial and
other forms of harassment.
Harvard law students held rallies and
overnight sit-ins Monday and last Thurs
day, demanding that the law school hire
more minority and women faculty. At the
first sit-in, the students demanded that
Austin be granted tenure at the end of this
academic year.
Stanford Law School Dean Paul Brest
has invited Austin to teach for either a
semester or for the year, "at her option."
Brest has not given her a deadline for
accepting the position.

Because the decision concerning her ten
ure at Harvard will not be made until the
end of next year, Austin said she is unable
to project her plans too far into the future.
"I was gratified by the offer by Stanford
because there are people there that I'd like
to work with," Austin said.
Although Harvard Law School may not
grant Austin tenure, the University of
Michigan has offered her a tenured posi
tion.
Austin said yesterday she is unable to
comment on the incidents at Harvard and
the other offers.
The protests against the present hiring

system at Harvard Law stem from the
students' dissatisfaction with the predom
inantly white male faculty and delayed ten
ure offers to visiting minority professors.
About 300 students participated in the ral
ly, 70 of whom "sat in" outside Law Dean
Robert Clark's office.
According to Phil Reubin, a news editor
of The Harvard Crimson, "Dean Clark
believes that abrupt changes in the [hiring]
system will hinder its ability to work."
However, the students hope that over
whelming support for Austin will cause
Clark to alter his views and make his de
cision this year.
