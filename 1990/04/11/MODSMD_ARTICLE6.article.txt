# Basketball burglar's bail: $60K
## 
### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
Ralph Sanders, the man sus
pected of posing as a Cardinal
basketball player in order to
burglarize Stanford dormitories,
received stern words yesterday
from a Palo Alto judge, who set
his bail at $60,000.
The municipal court judge
refused to release Sanders on his
own recognizance at an arraign
ment yesterday, citing Sanders'
eight previous failures to appear
in court for various offenses. The
judge, however, reduced Sanders'
bail by $15,000 from the original
amount of $75,000.
"He is facing an extensive time
in a state prison, and I won't even
begin to consider releasing him,"
answered the judge to a public
defender's request for Sanders' re
lease.
Sanders, 22, will be further in
terviewed by the public defender's
office and will enter a plea April
17.
He was arrested a week ago by
Stanford Police and has been
charged with 16 counts of bur
glary, forgery and false persona
tion.
He is suspected of stealing
checks and other personal items
from dormitory rooms and of
forging and cashing stolen checks.
In nine separate incidents since
November, a man pretending to
be a Cardinal athlete entered stu
dent rooms, and shortly thereafter
the students found that checks
were missing. Many victims have
positively identified Sanders in a
photo spread as the impostor.
A courtroom spectator wishing
to remain anonymous said his
children had befriended Sanders
at San Jose State University,
Sanders was convicted of check
forgery last year at Foothill Col
lege, where he was a student, and
recently was taking classes at San
Jose State.
"He's a very nice kid, but very,
very misguided," said the man.
"I don't think he considered this
as serious a matter as it turns
out to be.
"He's not a streetwise kid, and
I think he was too young to go
away from home," he added.
Sanders' family is in Los An
geles and will try to come to Palo
Alto as soon as possible, said the
man.
