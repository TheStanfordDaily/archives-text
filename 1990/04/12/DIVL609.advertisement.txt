2 The Palo Alto LSAT
LSAT AND GMAT COURSES
FOR THE JUNE EXAMS
The Program's courses for the June 11 LSAT and June 16 GMAT start the weekend of April 14 and
meet mostly Tuesday evenings (LSAT) and Wednesday evenings (GMAT) throughout the quarter.
Most substantive instruction will be complete by finals week. All curricular preparation,
instruction, and feedback are offered by a former Stanford faculty member who is a Stanford J.D.
and a practicing attorney with over ten years' experience in preparing members of the Stanford
community for these exams. Medians for Stanford-related persons in the past year are above the
9()th percentile. Enrollment is limited to 12 students per class, and the fee is $500.
