Carmel's quaint gingerbread architecture, profusion of colorful flowers and tall, shady trees is
mimicked by the Vagabond's House Inn. Set around a flagstone courtyard shaded by a giant
oak tree anil surrounded by fuchsias, azaleas, camelias and rhododendrons, the buildings are
storybook English cottage, brick and half-timbered topped by a thick shake roof, making this
one of Carmel's most atmospheric places to stay. Each of the guest rix>ms opens onto the court
yard and many have cozy fireplaces and sitting nooks. In the morning when you are ready for
breakfast, you phone reception to let them know when you would like a tray brought to your
r<x>m. The decor in the guest rmms varies. Many have been refurbished while others, although
the style might seem a bit dared, remain the same as they have for years because the loyal guests
protest any proposed changes to their favorite rooms â€” they love everything exactly as it
is. Directions: Take the Ocean Avenue exit from Highway 1, turn right on Dolores Street and
Vagabond's House Inn is on the corner of 4th Street.
