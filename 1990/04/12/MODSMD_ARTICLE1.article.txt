The Dead will not rise again on
the Stanford campus.
Stanford Police and the Dean
of Student Affairs Office have
decided not to allow the Concert
Network to invite the Grateful
Dead rock band back to campus
because of the drug problems and
crazy behavior that accompany its
concerts, Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said yesterday.
The group has annually per
formed two concerts at Frost Am
phitheater to sold-out crowds of
approximately 9,500 people each.
Last year police made 36 arrests
outside the May 6 and 7 concerts,
Niemeyer said. He said that num
ber was higher than previous
years. Twenty-one arrests were
for buying, selling, possessing or
using drugs. Had there been un
dercover police officers, the num
ber of arrests would have probably
leapt to more than 300, Niemeyer
said.
Nitric oxide, marijuana, LSD

and mushrooms were among the
different types of drugs people
were using, Niemeyer said.
During the concerts, there were
12 deputized police officers on the
scene to provide security. Also, 12
special events control people were
brought in to assist police.
Niemeyer added that it is "not
cheap" to provide such security,
but he could not estimate the cost.
"A 140-pound person who was

on drugs took three or four
weightlifting-type police to control
him," Niemeyer said, discussing
problems that occurred last year.
"The individual freaked out on
acid and had to be arrested with
considerable force."
Niemeyer also mentioned an
other incident in which an indi
vidual was "wandering around in
an academic building and thought
he was the Messiah."
