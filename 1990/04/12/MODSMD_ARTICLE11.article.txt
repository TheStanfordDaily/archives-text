# Howard U. exchange introduces students to a different world
## 
### Mónica Carpio Staff writer 
Darrell Daniels enjoyed the
benefits of attending Stanford,
but something was missing.
Growing up in a mixed-race
neighborhood in Connecticut and
then studying at Stanford, Daniels
said he wanted to learn traditional
subjects from a black viewpoint.
So Daniels enrolled in Howard
University and had an experience
he loved.
It was "a constant reminder of
what everyday, real life is about,"
the first-year graduate student
said. "It reminded me of why I
was in school in the first place."
But Daniels didn't transfer to
the historically black college in
Washington, D.C. Instead, he took
advantage of an exchange pro
gram between Howard and Stan
ford.
Daniels was one of the many
students who for the past 12 years
have participated in the Stanford-
Howard exchange program. The
program aims to let Stanford stu
dents experience higher education
from the very different academic
and cultural perspective of a pres
tigious historically black univer
sity, as well as giving Howard stu
dents a taste of Stanford life.
Said program coordinator Ruby
Mason, "For example, an econom
ics class (at Howard) might espe
cially address the economic situ
ation of black people living in
areas of particular concern."
Howard's outstanding pro
grams in engineering and broad
cast journalism have also at
tracted many students. Howard
has one of the top radio stations
in the District of Columbia and
offers a large selection of black
performing arts and black history
classes throughout the year.
For instance, senior Tracy Ben
ford took such classes as "Black
Diaspora" and "19th Century So
cial and Political Black History"
at Howard, while junior Alex
andra Crampton remarked that a
course in African French litera
ture had been her favorite.
Since Howard is on the semes
ter system, most Stanford stu
dents prefer to go during
Howard's fall semester, which
starts earlier than but coincides
with Stanford's fall quarter.
Others attend Howard's spring se

mester, which lasts from January
to May, while a few attend for an
entire year.
Being accustomed to Stanford's
quarter system and extremely de
manding schedule, Daniels felt he
had more time to experience ex
tracurricular activities at Howard.
For example, Daniels worked 25
hours a week at the Columbia
Heights Youth Center, located
within walking distance from his
dorm.
Unlike the jobs available at
Stanford, Daniels' job consisted
of supervising and helping set up
recreational programs for 6- to
18-year-old inner city kids, who
"would feel confident that nobody
would get into a fight" when the
monitor, Daniels, was there.
Howard's location in the north
west of the city enables students
to experience downtown activity.
"Since there is no residential ed
ucation system, students are more
responsible for their own source
of entertainment," commented
Daniels.
There are fewer campus parties,
and in a few minutes, students
can go to dance clubs, museums
and monuments.
Even though Howard has a total
enrollment of more than 12,000
students from 90 countries,
classes are small, personalized
and taught by professors who "ex
pect [students] to be serious about
their classes," Mason said.
Daniels explained that at
Howard even the introductory
classes are smaller than 30 stu
dents, and sometimes "professors

know all about your life."
The program is particularly ex
citing to many Stanford students
who have grown up in mostly
white neighborhoods and want to
experience life in a predominantly
black city setting.
Crampton, who returned from
Howard this winter, said she went
there because "after watching the
[raciall tension at Stanford last
year, I didn't think I had a good
grip on what was going on."
A white student who grew up
in a predominantly white neigh
borhood of Massachusetts,
Crampton said that even though
she felt a bit self-conscious at
tending Howard at the beginning,
she quickly adapted to the new
environment. She went to seek a
black perspective because "what
I needed to learn I couldn't learn
here."
Daniels said he returned with
a new perspective on issues facing
black Americans after spending a
semester at Howard the fall of
his senior year.
"It helped me understand a lot
of racial issues. . .. It's not as
simple as 'We should all be objec
tive.' "
Daniels experienced what it felt
like not to be a minority student
for the first time. During the time
he spent at Howard he felt no
pressure on minorities to "create
an image" to represent the various
opinions and needs of different
black communities.
"At Howard, a black student is
just another student," said Barry
Bim, coordinator of the exchange
program at Howard. Black stu
dents in a black university in
Washington have no pressure to
give an opinion which represents
the whole black race, and they
dor'i L . feel pressured to perform
better than white students to
prove their intellectual capabili
ties, Bim said.
Daniels learned about problems
that affect blacks in major cities
like Washington. Seeing, for ex
ample, "how tensions among
blacks from different parts of the
country plagued the relationship
between students and the univer
sity's administration," Daniels
learned about current problems
which affect predominantly black
communities — a topic not much
discussed at Stanford.

change last year, said students
who go to Howard also learn
about different black cultures: en
rolled at Howard are several stu
dents from different African coun
tries, the Bahamas and Bermuda.
Bim commented that Howard
students who have come to Stan
ford have had "a very positive
experience" and that more
Howard students would eagerly
come if they could.
Only three to five students
come to Stanford each quarter,
but more Howard students would
come if more Stanford students
went to Howard; the number of
students coming and going has to
be equal, Bim said.
Many of the Howard students
who come to Stanford, said Bim,
do so because they "want to see
how well they would do at a tough
school," are looking for courses
not offered at Howard and want
to attend a large and famous

school. Many are students who
were accepted to Stanford but
decided to attend Howard, and
they are curious to see "what they
missed."
Like Stanford, Howard has an
active student body striving to
achieve new outlooks in educa
tion. Last March, Howard stu
dents seized an administration
building, demanding a less Euro
pean and more African-American
focus in the curriculum and the
implementation of an African-
American studies graduate pro
gram, among other educational
objectives.
Kerr, who stood outside the
Stanford president's office during
last spring's takeover of the build
ing, said Howard's takeover influ
enced Stanford's. Unlike Stan
ford's takeover, which lasted only
one day, Howard's students re
mained in the building for more

than a week.
Kerr came to Stanford because
even though she loves her school,
she wanted to experience being a
minority and thus "be tempered"
for the real world. Although she
was pleased with her experience,
Kerr said her time at Stanford
"made me realize how fortunate
I was to go to Howard."
Kerr said she would like to see
universities such as Stanford and
Howard require students to at
tend exchange programs since
"neither one totally represents
real life."
In the mid-19705, Stanford had
an exchange with Morehouse Col
lege, a predominantly black uni
versity in Atlanta. The "culture
shock" students experienced when
they left Stanford to attend the
conservative deep-South univer
sity made that program unsuc
cessful, according to Laura
Selznick, director of Undergradu
ate Research Opportunities.
Stanford students, however,
still felt the need to have a black
university exchange program. In
1977, after having stopped out, a
Stanford student attended
Howard. She came back and
decided to establish an exchange
program, with help from the dean
of undergraduate studies and sup
port from other students.
Despite such complications as
limited on-campus housing, the
need to transfer credits and dif
ferences between semester and
quarter lengths, the Howard pro
gram was successfully established
in 1978.
One of the agreements of the
program was that exchange stu
dents would not be allowed to
transfer afterward, since one of
the goals of the program was to
let returning students share their
experiences with their home uni
versity.
