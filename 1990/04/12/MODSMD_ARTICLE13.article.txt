Rebels agree to talk
LISBON, Portugal (AP) — Angola's Marxist
government has agreed to start direct peace
talks this month with U.S.-backed rebels to
end their 15-year-old civil war, the official
Angolan news agency reported yesterday.
A rebel spokesman welcomed the announce
ment, which followed his side's offer Monday
of an immediate cease-fire. The guerrillas had
also proposed talks.
An initial truce and June talks mediated by
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire collapsed
within weeks, and fighting has intensified in
recent months.
In a dispatch released yesterday in Lisbon,
the ANGOP news agency quoted Deputy
Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura of Angola
as saying: "Probably this month (and) next
month, representatives of the Angolan govern
ment and elements of UNITA will meet to
discuss the internal problem."
Gorbachev issues warning
MOSCOW (AP) — President Mikhail Gor
bachev warned in remarks broadcast yesterday
that recarving internal Soviet borders would
lead to civil war and "such bloody carnage
that we won't be able to crawl out of it."
He told members of the Communist Youth
League he had spent more time thinking about
whether he should allow changes in the coun
try's political map than any other issue, and
decided against it.
Gorbachev said redrawing Soviet boundaries
"would pit all peoples and all nations against
each other and bring about a situation in this
society the likes of which has never been wit
nessed by our country or by the world."
And if other republics follow Lithuania's
example and try to secede, he said, "If we
begin to divide up, I'll give it to you bluntly.
We'll end up in such a civil war, in such bloody
carnage that we won't be able to crawl out of
it."
Quake jolts Japan
TOKYO (AP) — A strong earthquake jolted
western Japan yesterday morning but no dam
age or injuries were reported, the Central
Meteorological Agency said.
The earthquake, which had a preliminary
reading of 6.3 on the Richter scale, occurred
222 miles underground in the southwestern
part of Fukui prefecture (state), the agency
said. Fukui is 200 miles west of Tokyo.
An official of the agency's Seismic Division
said shock waves from an earthquake originat
ing so deep underground largely dissipate
before reaching the surface and rarely cause
damage, said the official, who declined to be
identified.
Strife mounts in Germany
EAST BERLIN (AP) — Farmers vowed to
drive their tractors through East Berlin and
telephone workers yesterday called a strike as
East Germany's new leaders tried to find a
fair formula for unity with West Germany.
An economic institute predicted 1.5 million
East Germans would be out of work in five
years unless the country saw a spurt of growth
after merging with its wealthy Western neigh
bor. According to official figures, about 70,000
East Germans are unemployed now.
political parties said yesterday that
they were close to agreeing on a blueprint for
East Germany's economic and social future.
Prime Minister-designate Lothar de
Maiziere, the conservative Christian Democrat
leader, held more talks with the left-leaning
Social Democrats on ways to dismantle the
nation's four-decade-old socialist system.
Mother Teresa retires
CALCUTTA, India (AP) — Mother Teresa,
the frail Roman Catholic nun who won a Nobel
Peace Prize for her work among the sick and
dying, said yesterday she was stepping down
as head of the religious order she founded in
1950.
