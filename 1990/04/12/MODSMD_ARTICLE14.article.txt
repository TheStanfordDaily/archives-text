JERUSALEM (AP) - Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres won additional
time to put together a governing co
alition after the last-minute defection
of two religious lawmakers yesterday
spoiled his immediate hopes of becom
ing prime minister.
Shouting matches erupted in Par
liament after attempts to form a new
government failed. The breakdown
renewed anger in Israel over the dis
proportionate influence of small right
wing religious parties, which serve as
kingmakers in any attempt to form a
governing coalition.
"Whoever says this is democracy is
speaking nonsense," said Amnon
Rubinstein of the left-wing Shinui
Party. "We can't continue with this
method."
President Chaim Herzog granted
Peres 15 more days to pull together
a government. Peres has vowed to
make peace negotiations with Pales
tinians his first priority.
He ruled out a return to the Likud-
Labor government, which collapsed
March 15 over peace moves. The right
wing Likud refused to accept U.S. pro
posals paving the way for Israeli-
Palestinian talks in Cairo.
"Let's never forget that the govern
ment fell on the issue of peace. Let's
remember that the issue of peace
should be the rmyor consideration,"
Peres told reporters.
Peres had planned to present his
coalition to the Knesset, or Parlia
ment, for approval yesterday. He was
counting on the support of 61 of the
120 legislators, including five from the
ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party.
But hours before the vote, Agudat
lawmaker Avraham Verdiger an
nounced that he had resigned from
Parliament. Party colleague Eliezer
Mizrahi then said he would vote
against Peres.
