SRINAGAR, India (AP) - The Mos
lem campaign for an independent
Kashmir spread to Bombay yesterday
with a bomb attack that wounded 34
people and brought Indian relations
with Pakistan to a new peak of anger.
United News of India, a news agency,
said frontier guards shot and killed
seven Kashmiri militants who were
trying to cross illegally into Pakistan,
which borders the Kashmir valley.
India and Pakistan, which have in
the past waged war over Kashmir,
traded bitter words over the latest vi
olence. Pakistani troops were put on
high alert yesterday after India's
leader talked of war.
The Indian news agency quoted un
identified officials as saying the
militants were killed while trying to

escape a dragnet spread across the
valley by security forces.
Authorities were cracking down in
a search for killers of three men ab
ducted last week by Moslem
separatists demanding the release of
three jailed colleagues. The bodies
were found Tuesday in the far north
ern city of Srinagar, the hub of the
secession drive.
The bomb rocked the train near
Malad station on the outskirts of Bom
bay, about 1,000 miles south of
Srinagar on India's west coast. Au
thorities said 34 people were wounded.
A man purporting to speak for the
"Mujahedeen Kashmir," or Islamic
Holy Warriors of Kashmir, telephoned
reporters in Srinagar and claimed re
sponsibility for the explosion.

The New Delhi and Bombay bomb
ings were the first time the Moslem
separatists claimed responsibility for
attacks outside Kashmir since the gov
ernment launched a crackdown on
secessionists Jan. 20. At least 260
people have been killed in Kashmir
during the crackdown.
In Srinagar yesterday, army troops
in camouflage battle dress cordoned
off the area where the bodies were
found and began house-to-house
searches for the killers, witnesses said.
A 24-hour curfew was in effect for the
sixth straight day.
The killings of the hostages, who
included a vice chancellor at Kashmir
University, were a departure from the
militants' previous practices. In the
past, the militants only killed civilians

accused of being police informers.
He said the events in Kashmir in
dicated "a sinister pattern of incite
ment to violence being orchestrated by
so-called leaders of Pakistan-occupied
Kashmir and by elements within
Pakistan itself." On Tuesday, Prime
Minister V.P. Singh said Indians
should be "psychologically prepared"
for another armed conflict with Pakis
tan over Kashmir.
Yesterday, Pakistan's military leader
put his troops on high alert.
Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, the military
chief, told a meeting of commanders
in Rawalpindi that Singh's "threaten
ing statements . . . call for a high state
of preparedness and vigilance to
frustrate the designs of the enemy."
