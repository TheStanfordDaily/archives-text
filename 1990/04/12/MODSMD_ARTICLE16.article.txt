Suspect arrested
WASHINGTON (AP) - The 1976
murder of former Chilean diplomat
Orlando Letelier on a tree-lined traf
fic circle in Washington touched off
a furor that strained U.S.-Chilean
relations and sent two men to prison.
A third man was arrested yester
day by the FBI in St. Petersburg, Fla.
Jose Dionisio Suarez, 51, was
charged with conspiracy to murder
a foreign official. The FBI said
Suarez provided the explosives and
detonating devices for the bomb that
killed Letelier.

Letelier, who had criticized human
rights policies of the Chilean military
government that exiled him, died
Sept. 21, 1976, when the bomb under
his car exploded as he drove to work
along Washington's Embassy Row.

Iran-Contra scandal, an extra 10 days
to file motions for a new trial.
U.S. District Judge Harold Greene

approved the extension until April
24 sought Tuesday by Poindexter's
attorney, Richard Beckler.
The office of independent counsel

jury verdict.
