Revised alcohol policy
is a reflection
of student concerns

STANFORD NOW HAS a new
and improved alcohol policy.
The revised alcohol policy
is a step in the right direction. By
prohibiting alcoholic beverages and
alcohol advertising in athletic fa
cilities and by revoking the parking
privileges of drunk drivers, the
policy serves to discourage alcohol
abuse and to protect the welfare
of the Stanford community.
Moreover, the revised policy
reflects the concerns of students.
The new dorm polling system
helped in soliciting opinions from
a large number of students. Be
cause of student input, a proposed
regulation prohibiting the use of
student fees to purchase alcohol
was rejected.
Students and administrators
worked effectively and quickly to
gether to develop constructive revi
sions of the alcohol policy.
However, the alcohol policy cannot,
in and of itself, address some of
the main causes of alcohol abuse
and over-consumption.
The fact of the matter is, social
activities are very limited at Stan
ford. A majority of the alcohol con
sumption on this campus does not
occur at athletic events.
Parties with alcohol are often the
major social outlet for students. In

order to reduce alcohol over
consumption and abuse, the Uni
versity needs to provide
alternatives to alcohol-focused par
ties by developing a greater variety
of social options.
For instance, Stanford still lacks
a "real" student union. In order
to meet students' needs and
schedules, Tresidder Union should
stay open past midnight and offer
activities such as bowling and, per
haps, miniature golf.
Accessibility to off-campus enter
tainment is often reserved for stu
dents who own cars. Shuttles to
Palo Alto and the Caltrain station
during the weekends and late
evenings would be of great service
to campus-bound students. Even
better, the University could lobby
for a BART extension.
At the same time, Stanford's al
cohol policy depends primarily on
student responsibility. Students,
particularly residence staff, can
help minimize alcohol abuse by en
couraging educational program
ming on alcohol consumption and
safety issues.
Party strategies, such as creating
a theme or providing quality non
alcoholic beverages, can help to
minimize the focus on alcohol. In
general, students can make an ef
fort to sponsor and attend non
alcoholic events.
While the revision of the alcohol
policy is a constructive action, the
Stanford community has yet to ad
dress the most substantive issues
surrounding alcohol use on this
campus.
