University should allow Beta fraternity to go coed

NOW THAT THE debate over
multiculturalism in fraternities
has been raised, I feel it is
appropriate to congratulate the Beta
Theta Pi fraternity for its recent deci
sion to admit women.
Implementing fundamental changes
in an organization is never easy, and
any attempt to put personal values
over traditional should be viewed as an
act of courage. I only wish that the
University administration could show
a* much ethical mettle.
I am referring to the University's
refusal to allow any future female
Betas to live in the house. It is sur
prising that a supposedly progressive
institution such as Stanford not only
fails to encourage but actively dis-

It is clear that this administration places financial
expediency over attempts to solve important social
problems. To achieve this end the University is willing
to employ tactics that are sexist on the surface and
sneaky and manipulative behind the scenes.

courages a move that can only promote
awareness and multiculturalism in an
institution that many call sexist.
This restriction is, on the surface,
sexist itself.
As one probes deeper, the restriction
becomes even more deplorable. The
restriction is based on a promise made
to fraternity alumni more than 20

years ago during a fundraising drive.
The promise made was that the rules
governing housed fraternities on
campus would not be changed, the
mtyor rule being the definition of
fraternities as "all-male organizations."
The irony is that the University is
living up to this promise for no other
reason than its desire to make quota.

Opening the doors to women is a
threat because it effectively doubles the
rush pool.
The promise the University made is
a joke, and it is being played on frater
nity alumni and members.
It is clear that this administration
places financial expediency over at
tempts to solve important social prob
lems. To achieve this end the Univer
sity is willing to employ tactics that
are sexist on the surface and sneaky
and manipulative behind the scenes.
I would have more respect for the
administration if it burned down the
houses for the insurance money.
