# Alpha Sig residents find depictions of house insulting
## 
### 
In response to Jay Jay Kuo's letter
on Monday, April 9 addressing housed
fraternity members' values concerning
pluralism, I was shocked and disap
pointed to see the Alpha Sig residence
used as an example of a "degenerate,
brotherhood-style house where the
bonds that build respect and accept
ance of differences are broken."
Alpha Sig is not a "brotherhood-style
house" in terms of Kuo's definition.
Alpha Sig is no longer a fraternity.
The house deactivated from the na
tional in 1982 when the Alpha Sigma
Pi council refused to accept a coed
community.
The Alpha Sig residents in 1982, as
they do now, found greater value in

coed living than in fraternal affiliation.
Alpha Sig is not a "degenerate" or
"broken" community. Although we did
have some problems in the beginning
of this school year, we, as a communi
ty, were able to address those prob
lems, resolve them, and unify the dorm
in the process.
Finally, I was most disappointed
when I saw that Kuo was the author
of that letter. Kuo was one of my —
along with eight other Alpha Sig resi
dents — freshman dorm resident assis
tants last year whom I respected as a
sensitive, open-minded individual who
voiced informed opinions on issues. I
have seen Kuo in my house once this
year, briefly.
I do not see how he can possibly
qualify his characterization of the Al
pha Sig community based on his lim
ited personal experiences with Alpha
Sig residents.
