# Public reporting more effective than SCLC proposal
## 
### 
Straightforward public reporting of
verbal harassment offers a faster,
simpler remedy to this problem than
the complex proposals advanced by the
Student Conduct Legislative Council.
One need not exclude the other, of
course.
Those aggrieved should immediately
record in writing their version of what
happened, their personal feelings and
others who witnessed the event.
They should consider submitting this
information as a letter to The Stanford
Daily, Campus Report and other local
news media, as well as to the judicial
affairs officer, the ombudsperson and
others with a potential interest in the
incident.
The judicial process, once invoked, is

often quite time-consuming. Concern
for individual privacy usually shrouds
the outcome, even when an incident is
widely reported.
Hard though it may be, taking time
to reconstruct what happened, putting
it in writing, and submitting it for
publication may assure a quicker, bet
ter focused public dialogue than the
student judicial process.
That is particularly true when those
involved include faculty, staff, visitors
and others not covered by the SCLC's
legislation.
