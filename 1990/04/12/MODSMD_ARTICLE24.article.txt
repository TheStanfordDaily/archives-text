## Creativity on the decline 
### 
UNLIKE THE drama of the present
day, Shakespearean times boasted
a theater of a different sort, a
theater in which physical scenery was all
but non-existent.
Language, rather than realistic props
or background, forged the scenery, and
thus the audience would need to rely on
its imagination rather than its sight to
visualize the surroundings of an act.
As a consequence, the performance of
a play such as "Macbeth" would trigger
a variety of images for each member of
the audience.
For one groundling, the interior of the
Macbeth castle might contain majestic
marble columns and red velvet drapes.
For the merchant perched in the upper
gallery, the Macbeth domain might ap
pear more austere, with wooden floors
and dark furniture.
In our modern day, it is difficult to
even fathom a culture so attuned to lan
guage. Nowadays, a bare stage might trig
ger the response, "Hey, where's the
castle? What kind of cheap production is
this anyway? Can I have my two-pence
back or what?" The audience would no
doubt then emit a low, menacing hiss.
In an age in which television has be
come the national family pet, in which
blaring picture ads accost us from every
corner, less and less responsibility is
placed upon the shoulders of imagination.
We need not envision the shade of Mar
cia Brady's hair or the patterns on the
sweaters of Cosby's Dr. Huxtable or the
color of President Bush's suit; they glow
lifelike on the tube. As a visual people
in a visual age, we find that too often

the picture is drawn for us before we
ever arrive.
It is no wonder then, that the picture
less page, or the empty stage, namely
the word, has fallen into disfavor. Why
spend a half-hour peering at dull printed
symbols which attempt to describe the
Great Wall when you can soak in its
magnificence in a few seconds with a
photograph?
If Kenneth Branaugh's "Henry V" is
a brilliant film rendering, why wade
through 80 pages and risk getting a paper
cut? Images, it seems, are far easier and
more enjoyable for the brain to digest
than words.
Exemplifying speedy information diges
tion is the modern day art of magazine
reading, or rather flipping. On my last
visit to the dentist's office, I noticed that
a continuous "flip-flip" permeated the
waiting room. A patient would flip
through at least seven magazines without
pause.
Perhaps he was a speed-reader, or
couldn't read, or was nervous, or simply
not interested in any of the articles. Or
perhaps he was in the throes of rapid
picture digestion.
The value of rapid picture digestion
can be comparable to the dubious merits
of feist food: easily accessible but provid
ing almost no nutrients.
A generation whose bedtime storyteller
is two feet tall, has a face of swirly images
and can't talk back or react is a gener
ation whose imagination, concentration
and visualization decay, followed by the
decline of conversation and writing.
It isn't surprising that American edu-

cators' assessment of students' writing
skills mirror the way an old Chinese poet
said he felt about his poetry: that if he
wrote one of his poems on a cookie and
gave it to a dog, the dog wouldn't eat it.
This is not to say that we should run
around with our eyes glued shut, smash
ing TVs, stomping on cameras and shred
ding magazines. The picture is a beautiful
thing, and is worth, after all, a thousand
words.
When it eclipses language and is met
with a blank stare, however, the thousand
tends to lapse into depreciation.
