Native Americans put entire effort toward planning powwow

Nineteen years ago, the
Native American students at
Stanford organized an effort to
sponsor an event at Stanford which
would bring a semblance of the Native
American presence to campus. The
students, with the help of the Bay
Area Indian community, successfully
established an event that has since
become an annual attraction for Native
American people from all over the
United States and Canada.
The Stanford Powwow has had the
privilege of being noted as one of the
largest Indian celebrations to take
place in California. In 1989, the num
ber of participants at the Powwow
throughout the three days reached
more than 15,000. Each year, more
people, Indian and non-Indian, attend
and share in the festivities.
A wide variety of select, quality arts
and crafts created by Native American
people in the tradition of their various
cultures is available to the public
during the Powwow. The assortment of
native arts and crafts include such

items as sand painting√ü, weavings,
turquoise jewelry, pottery, quill work
and fine bead work.
Over the years, the Stanford Pow
wow has been organized and run by
the undergraduate and graduate stu
dents who are involved with the Stan
ford American Indian Organization on
campus. Annually, SAIO's planning
committees consist of about 12 stu
dents who volunteer to take the An
nual Powwow. The entire community
and Indian staff members pull together
during the Powwow and provide the
manpower and support necessary to
run the three-day event.
The planning begins during the first
few weeks of fall quarter and contin
ues well after the last song is sung.
Because of the amount of organizing
that such an event requires, the Pow
wow becomes a msyor preoccupation
for the various committees and is the
source of an endless amount of head
aches and anxieties throughout the
year, with seemingly few rewards.
Funding for the event begins with

determine whether all the
sacrifices they made were
worth it.

soliciting contributions from the Uni
versity departments, dormitories and
student groups who are very support
ive of our unique event. But the head
aches continue with the security nego
tiations with the police department all
the way to the decision of which rental
agency will give us the best equipment
for the funds available. Why do we do
it?
In three short days, seven-and-a-half
months' worth of planning and organ
izing comes to a sudden and temporary

halt. This is the time when the indi
vidual students involved in the plan
ning and organizing must look back on
the event and try to determine
whether or not all of the academic and
social sacrifices that they made
throughout the year were worth it.
Ultimately, the answer to that reflec
tion is a resounding YES!
These intangible rewards are at the
heart of the reason why Stanford
Native American students persist in
bringing the Indian presence to campus
through the Powwow.
Historically, Powwows have been a
traditional part of Native American
cultures: a means of celebrating
achievements and endeavors of a tribe
or of an individual. The songs sung by
the drummers denote the occasion of
the dancing.
Aside from the entertainment value
of the Powwow, the historical signifi
cance of the event's survival is reason
to celebrate. Native American people
have endured a national effort to
completely assimilate the natives. This

assimilation was believed achievable
through the negation of traditional
Indian culture and values.
The government forbade Indian
people to engage in indigenous cultural,
social or religious activities. Conse
quently, Indian people across the coun
try were losing their heritage and
identity. Gradually, more and more
Indian people began to actively practice
their traditions and reaffirm their
cultures.
The effort continues. In Indian
country today, powwows take place
throughout the summer and are the
"stomping grounds" for thousands of
Native Americans who continue the
celebration of Indian culture and tradi
tions, preserved despite strong societal
pressures to assimilate into the main
stream and abandon Indian identity.
SAIO is honored to be able to share
in the continuance of the Native Amer
ican culture through the annual Stan
ford Powwow.
