## Cal breaks top-ranked netters' 29-match streak 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
When Stanford men's tennis
Coach Dick Gould said he wanted
some tight matches to get his
team ready for the NCAA Cham
pionships in May, he certainly
wasn't hoping for what happened
yesterday at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium.
In undoubtedly its closest
match this year, top-ranked Stan
ford fell to second-ranked Califor
nia 5-4, losing the dual meet in
the doubles portion of the com
petition.

Men's Tennis

Golden Bears 5
Cardinal 4

In the beginning, it looked as
though the Cardinal would record
another blowout. In the six singles
matches, Stanford won the first
set in five of them. California,
however, came back to win three
of the singles matches and force
the match into doubles.
Because of its strong singles
play throughout the year, Stan
ford had only needed to play dou
bles twice in dual competition. Ac
cording to Gould, this lack of ex
perience hurt the Cardinal as the
Bears won two of the doubles
matches and, consequently, the

meet.
The loss moved the Cardinal's
record to 16-1 and the Bears' to
16-5. It also ended Stanford's two
year winning streak at 29 match
es.
Stanford had beaten California
5-2 in the finals of the National
Team Indoors Feb. 25 in Louis
ville, Ky. But yesterday's match
saw some new heroes emerge for
the Golden Bears. In addition, the
Cardinal was missing freshman
superstar Jared Palmer who un
derwent knee surgery Monday.
In spite of the loss, freshman
Jonathan Stark played perhaps
his best tennis of the year. Stark,
who is ranked No. 2 in the coun
try by the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate
Rankings, blasted Bent-Ove
Pedersen 6-3, 6-1 in less than an
hour.
Stark's serve was especially im
pressive as he seemed to be able
to ace the Bears' No. 1 player at
will. "When I'm serving that well,
it gives me a lot of confidence,"
Stark said.
At No. 2 singles, Alex O'Brien
played a flawless first set but
ended up losing to Doug Eisenman
3-6, 6-3, 7-6 in the tightest match
of the day.
Down 6-2 in the third set tie
breaker, O'Brien mounted an im
pressive comeback which ended
when the sophomore netted a ball
down 5-6. "Throughout the third

set, I was just trying to do what
ever I could to get back into the
match," O'Brien said. "I tried to
use the crowd to get back into it,
but I just came up a little short."
"[Eisenmanl is tough to play,"
Gould added. "He's got a big left
handed serve, and it's tough to
get a rhythm against him. Alex
especially had trouble getting a
rhythm in the second and third.
"But Alex is one of the toughest
competitors on the team, if not
the toughest. He'll bounce back."
O'Brien beat Eisenman in the
Rolex Indoor Qualifying tourna
ment at Hayward earlier in the
year.
At No. 3 singles, California's
Carl Chang downed Jeff Cathrall
2-6, 7-6, 6-4. Cathrall came back
from a 5-1 deficit in the third but
couldn't get the final break at
5-4. "He was just too far down
[to come back]," Gould said.
Glenn Solomon served for the
first set at No. 4 singles but, after
that, proved ineffective against
Matt Lucena, losing 7-5, 6-1. "I
just got flat out beat today,"
Solomon said. "He dictated the
pace of the match. Anytime you
let a good player dictate the pace
of a match, he's going to give you
trouble."

Fitzpatrick at No. 5 singles 7-6,

Alex O'Brien and the Cardinal couldn't withstand the Golden Bears' onslaught yesterday, dropping
