# Sometimes sports writers just have to cheer in the press box
## 
### 
I violated a fundamental law of the
sports universe last week, and hoo
boy, am I broken up about it.
It wasn't anything earth-shattering, of
course; just a minor goof that happens
to me from time to time. Every now and
then, when someone on a team I'm cover
ing does something out of the ordinary,
or if the team does really well (like, say,
if they win a national title or something
minor like that), I forget a basic rule of
sports writing:
I cheer in the press box.
Yeah, I know, go ahead and string me
up, ban me from all sports events for life
(or worse, make me listen to Giants
games for the rest of the season). How
could I show such blatant disregard for
the rules of press box deportment? How
could I be so homer-ish? How could I
possibly do something so unbelievably,
shoddily unprofessional?
Well, (a) I ain't a professional; (b)
Cheering tends to be fun; and (c) Some
times, you've just gotta say . .
I realize most of you could probably
care less about this because you have
never, and will never, watch a game from
a press box. You're lucky, I mean, that's

too bad, 'cuz you get a great view of the
game that way. You usually get free food,
too, but I guess that's beside the point.
On the whole, the press box at Sunken
Diamond is a great place to watch a game,
if only because of the witty banter among
the troops. We're not supposed to cheer,
though. And the whole situation sheds a
little light on what it's like to write about
teams that you really, really want to win.
Now, let's get one thing straight: I
have never watched a Stanford
sporting event where I haven't
wanted the Cardinal to win. In a big way.
When Stanford wins, I feel great. When
we don't, I feel lousy. That's the Stanford
student in me.
There's no law against a sports writer
rooting for a team, I suppose, as long as
he keeps it to himself. Openly cheering
for one team or the other, though, as
I've said, is completely unprofessional.
So am I, and I'll be the first to admit
it. A professional doesn't dress the way
I do. A professional isn't biased. A pro
fessional is objective.
A professional doesn't ever lie on the
grass hill at Sunken Diamond to work

on his tan.
If you've read anything I've written
about the baseball team this season,
you've probably noticed that the notion
of objectivity somehow gets tossed out
the window every time I write. When the
Cardinal wins big, which tends to happen
pretty often, I rip on the other team.
Quotes? Mostly Stanford players and
coaches. Point of view? Cardinal all the
way.
I'm certainly not apologizing for any
of that. Whoever wins a war gets to write
the history of it, and I suppose the sports
corollary is that stories are written about
winners, not losers. In the case of the
baseball team, that means more often
than not I focus on Stanford.
That's not really an excuse: My stories
don't need the tone I give them in order
to get the facts across. I write them the
way I do . . . because, well, as long as I'm
here I'm a student first. Writing is just
something I happen to do every now and
then; it's not the reason I'm here. If I
stopped writing, I'd still care about the
baseball team. If I didn't care about the
baseball team, though, I really doubt I'd
keep writing.

It just wouldn't be any fun.
Usually, of course, there's no prob
lem with my being a Cardinal fan
'cuz I don't usually sit in the press
box. Why? Hey, if someone told you you
could have a great seat but you wouldn't
be allowed to cheer, what would you do?
Last year, covering the men's tennis
team, there wasn't ever a press box to
avoid. Every match, including the NCAA
final in Athens, Ga., I yelled and cheered
for the team, and didn't ever feel guilty
about it.
Things are a little different this year.
Normally I'm on the grass hill — yelling
quite loudly — but if the weather isn't
great I usually end up sitting in the press

box. (If the weather's really bad I get
someone else to cover the game.) Next
year, when I cover the men's basketball
team, I'll most likely be in the press box
for each and every game. And I'll most
likely be quiet.
Sometimes, though, even when I'm up
there, I have to cheer. Like last Sunday.
It was cloudy and cold, so I was up in
the press box. Stanford was down 6-3,
there were two outs in the bottom of the
fourth . . . and my freshman roommate
hit his first career home run.
I tried to be calm. I really did. I pumped
my fist about 50 times, laughed, and
then I looked around at the other
reporters and the TV commentators.
And decided they could kiss my elbow.
I stood up, I clapped and I danced a little.
Would I do the same thing again? Well,
probably not.
Next time I'll yell, too. Really, really
loud.

Cameron Macky, The Daily's baseball
writer, would have loved to be in the
Shea Stadium press box on Opening Day
to cheer the Pirates' 12-3 thrashing of
the Mets.
