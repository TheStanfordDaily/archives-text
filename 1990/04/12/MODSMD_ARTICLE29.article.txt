# Shortstop Burnett makes the impossible look routine
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
A good shortstop makes all the
routine plays. He won't give you
anything flashy, but he gets the
job done.
A better shortstop takes care of
all the easy plays and a few of
the hard ones. Occasionally
there's a moment of brilliance, but
not too often.
A great shortstop makes the im
possible look easy, and that's
where Stanford sophomore Roger
Burnett comes in.
Take Monday night's game at
San Jose State. In a game that's
an infielder's nightmare (thanks
to a field that has more ruts, rocks
and disaster areas than your
average off-road dirt track), Stan
ford takes a 6-5 lead into the bot
tom of the seventh.
With one out, though, the Spar
tans put men on first and second.
The man on first reaches base
because his slow ground ball, hit
right at Burnett, jumps straight
into the air and hits Burnett as
he tries to make the play — one
of at least five times during the
evening the ball does what it really
shouldn't.
Now, pitcher John Reid checks
the runners and fires to Charles
Havel. Ping! The ball shoots up
the middle of the field, a sure
single that will probably bring in
the game-tying run.
Nope. Burnett takes three
steps, dives, grabs the ball in mid
air and falls to the ground directly
behind second base. Still lying on
his stomach, he shovels the ball
to second baseman Troy Paulsen
for the force. Two down, the run
ner stops at third, and the Car
dinal holds on to win.
A fantastic play, but hey, it's no
big deal. "Nothing Roger does
surprises me," Stanford Asst.
Coach Dean Stotz says."The ball
goes off his face, and the very
next play he's back diving at it.
If that's me, I'm getting a little
gun-shy."

Not Burnett, whose outstand
ing range and instincts (not to
mention the Howitzer he calls a
right arm) have been helping him
make the tough plays routine for
the last two years. Making it look
easy has its down side — pretty

soon, people start to expect great
ness and might not appreciate it
as much — but that's fine with
him.
"If there isn't a big to-do about
(a play), maybe it's because they
expect it of me," Burnett says.

"It's better in that sense. If they
don't say anything, I'm just gonna
guess that they expect it."
No praise, in fact, may be a
good sign. "If I make a play that
I don't think is that tough," Bur
nett says,"and everybody says
'Great play,' I kinda think 'How
good do they think I really am?
I must not be that tough, if they
think that's such a great play.'
The less recognition, defensive
wise, the better."
Offensive-wise, however,
recognition is just fine. Burnett,
who was the Cardinal's Most
Valuable Freshman last season
(during which he hit .308 and had
six homers and 31 RBI), had, until
last week, spent most of this
season mired in a batting funk,
hitting around .250.
Last Tuesday, though, he hit a
two-run homer — his first round
tripper in two months — to kick
off a week in which he hit homers
in three straight games, went
seven-for-16 (including four-for
four Saturday), scored seven runs,
had six RBI and was named the
Six-Pac Player of the Week.
"Confidence is such a big part
of the game," Burnett says. "I've
struggled with that a little bit
since I've been here, up until late
ly. I think I might have finally
gotten a grasp on it."
Even if the offense continues,
it's his defense that will most
likely make a name for the native
of Broken Arrow, OK (pop.
53,000, thank you very much).
"He has whatever skills it takes
(to play in the majors)," Stotz
says."In the big leagues, if you're
a shortstop defensively of his
caliber and you're hitting .225,
that's fine with them, as long as
you're picking up everything
that's coming your way.
"One of the things, looking
down the road at the majors, is
how easy does it appear?" Stotz
continues. "Roger makes the dif
ficult plays look routine. That's
who plays in the big leagues, the
guys who make it look easy. He
has that same quality."

Making it look easy, though,
isn't always easy. "He's worked
hard at his game," Stotz says.
"He's paid the price."
That hard work has, for most
of Burnett's life, been shared with
his father, who played ball for a
junior college in Oklahoma. "My
dad's always sort of been my men
tor, I guess," Burnett says."He
was my Little League coach, and
he was always helping me. We
were always talking about the
mental aspects of the game.
"Even now, if something's going
wrong," Burnett says,"I can
describe the problem to him, and
even though he's not here, I can
just describe it to him and he'll
know what the problem is." The
two talk after almost every game.
"I tell him how things are, and
he always helps," Burnett says.
"He always has something to say."
His father's influence is appar
ent in other ways as well. Before
the first Cardinal time up in each
game, Burnett — who hits in the
No. 8 spot in the order — takes
a few steps toward the plate and

watches the opposing pitcher
warm up.
"I think just studying the
pitcher and getting your timing
down is such a big part of hitting,"
Burnett says. "I've found the
more you study the pitcher the
more you know what's going on.
You might pick up a little some
thing here and there that some
one else won't: how he's holding
the ball, or whatever."
Even though it lasts only a few
seconds, the ritual helps. "I try
to get as close as I can," says
Burnett, who has been studying
pitchers this way since high
school. "I try to watch him closely
and set a timer in my head, so
when I get up there my timing's
going to be on.
"I hadn't been doing that the
first half of the season, but lately
I have been," Burnett says."It
might have made a difference: My
timing seems to be better lately.
"(My dad) always taught me
that that was a big part of the
game," Burnett says. "Maybe it's
working, maybe it's not."

tripper in two months — to kick
off a week in which he hit homers
in three straight games, went
seven-for-16 (including four-for
four Saturday), scored seven runs,
had six RBI and was named the
Six-Pac Player of the Week.
"Confidence is such a big part
of the game," Burnett says. "I've
struggled with that a little bit
since I've been here, up until late
ly. I think I might have finally
gotten a grasp on it."
Even if the offense continues,
it's his defense that will most
likely make a name for the native
of Broken Arrow, OK (pop.
53,000, thank you very much).
"He has whatever skills it takes
(to play in the majors)," Stotz
says."In the big leagues, if you're
a shortstop defensively of his
caliber and you're hitting .225,
that's fine with them, as long as
you're picking up everything
that's coming your way.
"One of the things, looking
down the road at the majors, is
how easy does it appear?" Stotz
continues. "Roger makes the dif
ficult plays look routine. That's
who plays in the big leagues, the
guys who make it look easy. He
has that same quality."

Making it look easy, though,
isn't always easy. "He's worked
hard at his game," Stotz says.
"He's paid the price."
That hard work has, for most
of Burnett's life, been shared with
his father, who played ball for a
junior college in Oklahoma. "My
dad's always sort of been my men
tor, I guess," Burnett says."He
was my Little League coach, and
he was always helping me. We
were always talking about the
mental aspects of the game.
"Even now, if something's going
wrong," Burnett says,"I can
describe the problem to him, and
even though he's not here, I can
just describe it to him and he'll
know what the problem is." The
two talk after almost every game.
"I tell him how things are, and
he always helps," Burnett says.
"He always has something to say."
His father's influence is appar
ent in other ways as well. Before
the first Cardinal time up in each
game, Burnett — who hits in the
No. 8 spot in the order — takes
a few steps toward the plate and

watches the opposing pitcher
warm up.
"I think just studying the
pitcher and getting your timing
down is such a big part of hitting,"
Burnett says. "I've found the
more you study the pitcher the
more you know what's going on.
You might pick up a little some
thing here and there that some
one else won't: how he's holding
the ball, or whatever."
Even though it lasts only a few
seconds, the ritual helps. "I try
to get as close as I can," says
Burnett, who has been studying
pitchers this way since high
school. "I try to watch him closely
and set a timer in my head, so
when I get up there my timing's
going to be on.
"I hadn't been doing that the
first half of the season, but lately
I have been," Burnett says."It
might have made a difference: My
timing seems to be better lately.
"(My dad) always taught me
that that was a big part of the
game," Burnett says. "Maybe it's
working, maybe it's not."


Al Green — Daily file
Sophomore shortstop Roger Burnett will be counted on — like
usual — to make Impossible plays seem normal when Stanford
takes the field against the Bears today.
A good shortstop makes all the
routine plays. He won't give you
anything flashy, but he gets the
job done.
A better shortstop takes care of
all the easy plays and a few of
the hard ones. Occasionally
there's a moment of brilliance, but
not too often.
A great shortstop makes the im
possible look easy, and that's
where Stanford sophomore Roger
Burnett comes in.
Take Monday night's game at
San Jose State. In a game that's
an infielder's nightmare (thanks
to a field that has more ruts, rocks
and disaster areas than your
average off-road dirt track), Stan
ford takes a 6-5 lead into the bot
tom of the seventh.
With one out, though, the Spar
tans put men on first and second.
The man on first reaches base
because his slow ground ball, hit
right at Burnett, jumps straight
into the air and hits Burnett as
he tries to make the play — one
of at least five times during the
evening the ball does what it really
shouldn't.
Now, pitcher John Reid checks
the runners and fires to Charles
Havel. Ping! The ball shoots up
the middle of the field, a sure
single that will probably bring in
the game-tying run.
Nope. Burnett takes three
steps, dives, grabs the ball in mid
air and falls to the ground directly
behind second base. Still lying on
his stomach, he shovels the ball
to second baseman Troy Paulsen
for the force. Two down, the run
ner stops at third, and the Car
dinal holds on to win.
A fantastic play, but hey, it's no
big deal. "Nothing Roger does
surprises me," Stanford Asst.
Coach Dean Stotz says."The ball
goes off his face, and the very
next play he's back diving at it.
If that's me, I'm getting a little
gun-shy."

Not Burnett, whose outstand
ing range and instincts (not to
mention the Howitzer he calls a
right arm) have been helping him
make the tough plays routine for
the last two years. Making it look
easy has its down side — pretty

soon, people start to expect great
ness and might not appreciate it
as much — but that's fine with
him.
"If there isn't a big to-do about
(a play), maybe it's because they
expect it of me," Burnett says.

"It's better in that sense. If they
don't say anything, I'm just gonna
guess that they expect it."
No praise, in fact, may be a
good sign. "If I make a play that
I don't think is that tough," Bur
nett says,"and everybody says
'Great play,' I kinda think 'How
good do they think I really am?
I must not be that tough, if they
think that's such a great play.'
The less recognition, defensive
wise, the better."
Offensive-wise, however,
recognition is just fine. Burnett,
who was the Cardinal's Most
Valuable Freshman last season
(during which he hit .308 and had
six homers and 31 RBI), had, until
last week, spent most of this
season mired in a batting funk,
hitting around .250.
Last Tuesday, though, he hit a
two-run homer — his first round
tripper in two months — to kick
off a week in which he hit homers
in three straight games, went
seven-for-16 (including four-for
