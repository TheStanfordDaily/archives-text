# Trustees' commission targets environment
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
Responding to increased public at
tention to the environment, the Board
of Trustees' Special Commission on
Investment Responsibility voted this
week to approve a proxy resolution
asking five major corporations to re
spond to environmental issues.
In addition, the SCIR voted against
a resolution calling for Caterpillar Inc.
to disinvest in South Africa and
against a proposal by a group of AT&T
shareholders that AT&T eliminate its
affirmative action programs.
The resolution passed by the SCIR
asks five corporations — American Ex
press, Exxon, Arco, Kerr-McGee and

Occidental Petroleum — to report on
how they are responding to the "Val
dez Principles," a group of guidelines
for businesses about environmental is
sues, according to SCIR chair
Theodore Mitchell.
The Valdez Principles were created
by the Coalition for Environmentally
Responsible Economies in response to
last year's Exxon oil spill in Valdez,
Alaska.
The 10 principles include the protec
tion of the biosphere, reduction and
disposal of waste, wise use of energy,
marketing of environmentally safe
products and services, and compensa
tion for environmental damage.
Two of the more controversial prin
ciples require a company to have an

"environmentalist" on its board of di
rectors and an annual assessment and
audit of how well the company is ad
hering to the Valdez Principles, ac
cording to Dana Klapper, a student
member of the University Committee
on Investment Responsibility, which
advises the trustees' committee.
CIR chair Gary Malone said CIR
members have some problems with the
Valdez Principles, particularly the dif
ficulty of defining who exactly is an
environmentalist and the fact that
businesses were not consulted before
the principles were developed.
The SCIR sent a letter to each of
the five companies explaining the rea
son Stanford voted in favor of the
resolution, Mitchell said. The letter

urges the companies to work with the
Coalition for Environmentally Respon
sible Economies to develop a set of
fair and clear standards that satisfy
both businesspeople and environmen
talists.
"We want a dialogue" which will get
industry representatives and activists
together to work on these issues,
Mitchell added.
The SCIR decided to side with Cater
pillar management on the disinvest
ment resolution because it is
encouraged by the progress Caterpillar
has made in South Africa, Mitchell
said.
Caterpillar is one of the few
companies working in South
Africa that meets the require
ments set forth in Stanford's
stringent selective divestment
policy. Such companies must have
the highest rating on the Sullivan
Principles, a list of guidelines de
signed for businesses working in
South Africa to combat the dis
criminatory practices of apart
heid.
However, the SCIR did not ap
prove of all of Caterpillar's activ
ities in South Africa. It passed a
second proposal asking Caterpil
lar to discontinue sales to Escom,
the South African state-owned
electricity commission, and to
Sasol, the state-owned coal and

oil facilities.
According to Malone, these two
companies are directly linked to
apartheid.
In its final decision, the SCIR
voted against a resolution calling
for AT&T to phase out those
aspects of its affirmative action
program that are directed toward
recruiting, employing or promot
ing individuals from any particu
lar racial or ethnic group.
This is the third year that the
SCIR has rejected the proposal.
