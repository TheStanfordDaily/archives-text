# Card netters continue roll... right over Golden Bears
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — David Harris put it
best when he said "Dreams Die Hard."
Heading into yesterday's tennis match
with Stanford, the California Golden
Bears strongly believed they had a
chance to end the Cardinal's consecutive
victory streak at 57.
Consider some pre-match analysis
along with some critical commentary:

Women's Tennis

Cardinal 8
Golden Bears 1

Pre-match: Sophomore Lisa Albano,
Cal's No. 1 player, said: "I think Stan
ford is more beatable than last year.
Their top three are taking a lot more
losses than last year. They used to end
matches in singles and they don't do
that anymore."
Commentary: The Cardinal's top
three — Sandra Birch, Meredith
McGrath and Debbie Graham — had
lost a total of three matches combined
entering yesterday's action. All three
losses belonged to Birch and all occurred
within the past two weeks.
Of Stanford's 21 wins, only four were
not clinched in singles. Incidentally,
Birch hammered Albano 6-0, 6-4 yes
terday.
Pre-match: Senior Jean-Marie
Lozano, who plays second singles for
the Bears, said: "Stanford is successful
not so much because of the players they
have, it's how everyone makes them out
to be. Other players and the media say
they're unbeatable and they feed off
that image. And the teams they play
get into that, too."
Commentary: The Bears were no ex
ception to the trap apparently. Lozano
recorded their lone victory of the day,
a 6-3, 7-5 win over the previously un

defeated McGrath. If only she had been
able to convince her teammates that
Stanford is just a house of cards, things
might have turned out differently.
Pre-match: Emilie Viqueira, the
Bears' No. 3 player, said: "We're gonna
cut the trees down. I really think we're
going to do it."
Commentary: She also probably
thought she would win more than three
games in her singles match. Instead,
Teri Whitlinger trounced her 6-2, 6-1.
Normally, Whitlinger would be playing
a spot lower in the lineup. She moved
up because Debbie Graham was unable
to play.
Pre-match: Vittorio Tafur, a sports
columnist for The Daily Californian,
wrote in yesterday's paper: After ex
plaining that he has been a poor prog
nosticator this season, continued: "I'm
due for a big hit ... Bottom line . . .
Cal wins today."
Commentary: Tafur is a big, strong
fellow. Perhaps that big hit will come
in a softball game with the bases loaded.
Pre-match: Frank Brennan, coach of
the four-time defending NCAA cham
pion Cardinal, said: "If Debbie doesn't
play, I would say we're underdogs. Cal
is the second-best team in the country.
They're mighty good and they're playing
a rival at home."
Commentary: After the match, Bren
nan denied he was sandbagging. He was
singing a considerably different tune,
though, as he described his three-step
formula for success. "You've got to be
strong on top." Check. It was McGrath's
first loss of the season and Birch seems
to be back in top form.
"You've got to have good doubles."
Check. Graham was out, so the Cardi
nal's No. 3 team of Lisa Green and
Heather Willens moved up to No. 2 and
drubbed Trina Jong and Viqueira 6-3,
6-4. Stanford's No. 4 tandem of Kylie
Johnson and Mario Carruth stepped in
at No. 3 and thrashed Lisa Parks and

Veena Prabhakar 6-3, 6-3. Oh, and
McGrath Whitlinger, hammered
Albano-Lozano 6-1, 6-4 at No. 1.
"You've got to have good depth."
Checkmate. With the lineup ratcheted
one notch, Johnson slid in at No. 6.
She double-bageled Prabhakar 6-0, 6-0.
"Kylie Johnson steps in and you don't
lose a beat," Brennan said. "She really
rose to the occasion. She had a great
day . . . capping it off with great doubles.
She was clicking on all cylinders."
As was Birch, for the first time since
early March. "Mentally I was a lot better
today," she said. "That's been my main
problem."
She explained that the first of the
three losses may have set up the other
two. "If you lose one match, that can
snowball. You try to understand that
one match has no bearing on another.
"I understand that, but I don't know
how well I can implement it. There are
times when I go out, I'm my own worst
enemy. I've not been a good friend to
myself lately."
Yesterday, though, Birch's forehand
(her best buddy?) was its usual devas
tating self. From the outset of the
match, she had Albano off balance and
unable to play her normal game. Typ
ically, that is exactly how Birch beats
people, making it appear Birch is back.
McGrath, who had tempted fate with
two tense three-setters over the week
end, fell to Lozano largely as a result
of her inability to hold serve. McGrath
was broken in five of her last seven
service games.
When the match ended, Lozano tossed
her racket into the air, pumped her
fists and let out a loud "Yes!" About
the only thing she didn't do was exclaim:
"I'm going to Disneyland!"
The Bears probably wish they had
done just that. Dreams can come true
in the Magic Kingdom.

a spot lower in the lineup. She moved
up because Debbie Graham was unable
to play.
Pre-match: Vittorio Tafur, a sports
columnist for The Daily Californian,
wrote in yesterday's paper: After ex
plaining that he has been a poor prog
nosticator this season, continued: "I'm
due for a big hit ... Bottom line . . .
Cal wins today."
Commentary: Tafur is a big, strong
fellow. Perhaps that big hit will come
in a softball game with the bases loaded.
Pre-match: Frank Brennan, coach of
the four-time defending NCAA cham
pion Cardinal, said: "If Debbie doesn't
play, I would say we're underdogs. Cal
is the second-best team in the country.
They're mighty good and they're playing
a rival at home."
Commentary: After the match, Bren
nan denied he was sandbagging. He was
singing a considerably different tune,
though, as he described his three-step
formula for success. "You've got to be
strong on top." Check. It was McGrath's
first loss of the season and Birch seems
to be back in top form.
"You've got to have good doubles."
Check. Graham was out, so the Cardi
nal's No. 3 team of Lisa Green and
Heather Willens moved up to No. 2 and
drubbed Trina Jong and Viqueira 6-3,
6-4. Stanford's No. 4 tandem of Kylie
Johnson and Mario Carruth stepped in
at No. 3 and thrashed Lisa Parks and

Veena Prabhakar 6-3, 6-3. Oh, and
McGrath Whitlinger, hammered
Albano-Lozano 6-1, 6-4 at No. 1.
"You've got to have good depth."
Checkmate. With the lineup ratcheted
one notch, Johnson slid in at No. 6.
She double-bageled Prabhakar 6-0, 6-0.
"Kylie Johnson steps in and you don't
lose a beat," Brennan said. "She really
rose to the occasion. She had a great
day . . . capping it off with great doubles.
She was clicking on all cylinders."
As was Birch, for the first time since
early March. "Mentally I was a lot better
today," she said. "That's been my main
problem."
She explained that the first of the
three losses may have set up the other
two. "If you lose one match, that can
snowball. You try to understand that
one match has no bearing on another.
"I understand that, but I don't know
how well I can implement it. There are
times when I go out, I'm my own worst
enemy. I've not been a good friend to
myself lately."
Yesterday, though, Birch's forehand
(her best buddy?) was its usual devas
tating self. From the outset of the
match, she had Albano off balance and
unable to play her normal game. Typ
ically, that is exactly how Birch beats
people, making it appear Birch is back.
McGrath, who had tempted fate with
two tense three-setters over the week
end, fell to Lozano largely as a result
of her inability to hold serve. McGrath
was broken in five of her last seven
service games.
When the match ended, Lozano tossed
her racket into the air, pumped her
fists and let out a loud "Yes!" About
the only thing she didn't do was exclaim:
"I'm going to Disneyland!"
The Bears probably wish they had
done just that. Dreams can come true
in the Magic Kingdom.

Kylie Johnson bageled Cal's Veena Prabhakar to contribute to the undefeated Car
dinal's 8-1 thrashing of the Bears yesterday.
BERKELEY — David Harris put it
best when he said "Dreams Die Hard."
Heading into yesterday's tennis match
with Stanford, the California Golden
Bears strongly believed they had a
chance to end the Cardinal's consecutive
victory streak at 57.
Consider some pre-match analysis
along with some critical commentary:

Women's Tennis

Cardinal 8
Golden Bears 1

Pre-match: Sophomore Lisa Albano,
Cal's No. 1 player, said: "I think Stan
ford is more beatable than last year.
Their top three are taking a lot more
losses than last year. They used to end
matches in singles and they don't do
that anymore."
Commentary: The Cardinal's top
three — Sandra Birch, Meredith
McGrath and Debbie Graham — had
lost a total of three matches combined
entering yesterday's action. All three
losses belonged to Birch and all occurred
within the past two weeks.
Of Stanford's 21 wins, only four were
not clinched in singles. Incidentally,
Birch hammered Albano 6-0, 6-4 yes
terday.
Pre-match: Senior Jean-Marie
Lozano, who plays second singles for
the Bears, said: "Stanford is successful
not so much because of the players they
have, it's how everyone makes them out
to be. Other players and the media say
they're unbeatable and they feed off
that image. And the teams they play
get into that, too."
Commentary: The Bears were no ex
ception to the trap apparently. Lozano
recorded their lone victory of the day,
a 6-3, 7-5 win over the previously un

defeated McGrath. If only she had been
able to convince her teammates that
Stanford is just a house of cards, things
might have turned out differently.
Pre-match: Emilie Viqueira, the
Bears' No. 3 player, said: "We're gonna
cut the trees down. I really think we're
going to do it."
Commentary: She also probably
thought she would win more than three
games in her singles match. Instead,
Teri Whitlinger trounced her 6-2, 6-1.
Normally, Whitlinger would be playing
a spot lower in the lineup. She moved
up because Debbie Graham was unable
to play.
Pre-match: Vittorio Tafur, a sports
columnist for The Daily Californian,
