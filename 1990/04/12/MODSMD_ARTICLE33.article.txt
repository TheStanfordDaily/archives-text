# Golfers sizzle in Arizona
## 
### Aden Fine Staff writer 
Before yesterday's final round of the
Lady Sun Devil at Arizona State Uni
versity, Coach Tim Baldwin told his team
they had to do well.
And being the good listeners they are,
the women golfers went out and had a
great round, shooting a 304 — their
best score of the tournament and their
second-best round of golf all year.
There was a little problem, however.
You see, the seven teams ahead of the
Cardinal entering yesterday's play also
saved their best rounds for last.
The end result was that despite its
superb outing, the Cardinal did not move
up in the tournament and finished in
eighth place. Host ASU won the tour
nament with a new intercollegiate record
score of 882. Kelly Robbins of Tulsa
took the individual title by a stroke over
Sun Devil Brandi Burton, who suffered
her first loss of the season.

Yet don't expect any gloomy faces on
the golfers. If ever there was a "moral
victory," this was it. As Baldwin said,
"We improved excellently today. We
played very consistent golf and had a
solid, solid round. It's a real step in the
right direction at the right time of the
year."
Sophomore Stephanie Davis echoed
the same thoughts. "We're not disap
pointed at all that we didn't move up
in the standings. It would have been
nice, of course, but we're happy with
the way we played."
Davis had an especially impressive
tournament, as she finished with a
three-round total of 229, which was good
enough to put her in a tie for seventeenth
place overall. Baldwin was quite im
pressed with how his second-year player
handled the tough Karsten golf course.
"I was really proud of the way that
Stephanie played throughout the tour

nament. She was very solid and steady
throughout."
Davis was also obviously happy with
her performance. "My swing felt really
good and I was able to get up and down
consistently. Going into the tournament,
I was confident because I played well in
Phoenix last year, and even though it
was a different course this year, I was
still confident."
Baldwin was equally optimistic about
the way sophomore Adele Moore con
cluded the tournament (she shot a three
over-par 75 yesterday). "For the first
time this year I really saw, again, the
great ability of Adele Moore."
In fact, in the final round, every mem
ber of the team had her best, or tied
her best, score of the tournament (except
for Davis who shot a scorching 74 on
the opening day). Even sophomore
Martha Richards, who played in the
tournament as an individual after just
returning from winning a national
championship in basketball, improved
yesterday She shot an 81 — five shots
better than her next best score.
Davis feels the successful round will
be a big help to the team for the rest
of the season. "The team played really
well today, and this will help our con
fidence in the future, because we now
know that we can have a big round
when we need to."
The next tournament for the Cardinal
is the Pacific 10-Conference Champion
ships, which will be held from April 27
to 29 right here at the Stanford Golf
Course. With yesterday's showing be
hind them, the team has reason to be
optimistic.
"I think with the dedication I see on
the team, we're going to do really well
in that tournament," Baldwin said.
The team's NCAA championship
hopes were also bolstered by yesterday's
round. "It will go a long way to helping
us be seeded in the NCAAs," Baldwin
added.
In addition, with the poor showing of
UCIiA, which is currently ranked No. 9
nationally, the No. 10 Cardinal will un
doubtedly move up in the rankings.
So it was a victory after all.
