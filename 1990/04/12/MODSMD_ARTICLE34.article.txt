# Hoops signs small forward

While the Pacific 10 Conference
is definitely on the rise in men's
basketball, few think it compares
to the Big Ten Conference. But
for one high school student in
lowa, the Pac-10 comes out on top.
Nick Ravn, a 6-foot-7, 195-
pound center from Spencer High
School in Spencer, lowa an
nounced yesterday that he signed
a letter of intent to play at Stan
ford. Ravn also considered North
western and lowa, both Big Ten
schools, as well as Colorado State
of the Western Athletic Confer
ence.
He made his decision based
upon Stanford's "combination of
basketball and academics that was
just superior to the rest."
Ravn joins Bob Patton of
Youngstown, Ohio as Stanford's
freshman class for next year. Pat
ton, who signed with Stanford
during the fall signing period, was
recently named Mr. Basketball for
the state of Ohio by the Associated
Press. He led Liberty High School

to the state championship game
to earn the title of the top player
in the state.
Ravn averaged 27.9 points and
10.5 rebounds a game this season
and had one 51-point night. He
led his squad to a 16-4 record and
the Lakes Conference title. Spen
cer then lost in the second round
of the 2-A District playoffs.
That division is for the second
largest group of schools of the
state's four classifications
He was named a first-team all
state player by the Des Moines
Register, the lowa Basketball
Coaches Association and the lowa
Newspaper Writers Association.
Ravn was also selected to play in
the lowa High School All-Star
Game featuring the top 10 players
in the state from each division.
Following that game in June,
he will tour the country this sum
mer as a member of the Amateur
Athletic Union's lowa select team.
That team will play games in
Chicago; Des Moines, Iowa;
Kansas City; Los Angeles; Jack
sonville, Fla.; and perhaps Eu
rope.

"Nick fits a needed priority of
a good perimeter scorer at the
small forward position," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said.
"He is an exceptional ballhandler,
has good hands, faces the basket
and is a good scorer."
"I'm a perimeter player," Ravn
said. "I think my strengths are
shooting and passing. Physically
I'm not strong enough to compete
at the Division I level but that
will come with time."
Ravn and Patton will join a Car
dinal team that went 18-12 last
year and returns all five starters
and 11 of 12 roster players. Ravn
will battle incumbent starter Des
hon Wingate and freshman Brent
Williams, who redshirted as a
freshman this year.
"[Earning playing time] will be
difficult," Ravn said, "mainly be
cause I lack the strength and en
durance to play a Division I
game." Ravn said he and Mont
gomery had not discussed a red
shirt year, stating that, "I can't
really say until I get to camp in
the fall and start practicing."
