# DR redistribution debated

### Michelle Campos Staff writer 
Faculty and students engaged
in a heated discussion last night
concerning the distribution re
quirements proposal introduced
last week by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
The proposal calls for 11 dis
tribution requirements. Cultures,
Ideas and Values and the three
math and science requirements
would remain intact. Thrfifc new
requirements — world cultures,
gender studies and ethnic studies
— would be added to the four
current humanities and social sci
ences requirements to form a pool
of seven.
Students could fulfill these
seven areas with only four classes,
though, due to the proposed op
tion of counting some classes for
two areas.
Most of the objections raised by
faculty and students concerned
the ethnic studies requirement,
the doubling-up option and the
grouping of the requirements.
The drafted proposal defines

ethnic studies as the study of "the
history and culture of minorities
in the United States systemati
cally discriminated against on the
basis of conceptions of race or
religion."
These groups were identified in
the proposal as African-
Americans, American Indians,
Asian-Americans, Hispanic-
Americans, Jewish-Americans
and Pacific Islanders.
Several faculty members and
students present objected to dis
crimination as the controlling
definition of ethnic studies.
"It seems that the committee's
motivation is political rather than
educational," said Brian Pickrell,
an engineering graduate student.
"Trying to present students with
this definition of ethnic is to try
to express and impose a certain
political viewpoint."
Pickrell also argued the poten
tially all-encompassing nature of
the definition, saying that some
oppressed groups will not be
studied.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow responded by say-

ing that it is "not the same prep
aration for living in a
multicultural society and is not
salient preparation to become a
responsible member of that soci
ety."
More controversial, however,
was the proposed opportunity to
allow courses to count for more
than one requirement area.
"This option will only result in
the bastardization of courses,"
said English Prof. Ron Rebholz.
In an effort to attract students,
professors may be tempted to al
ter courses to encompass two
areas, he added.
The opposition also argued the
grouping of the new distribution
requirements. Many faculty
argued that the decision to leave
the math and science areas intact
discriminated against the social
sciences and humanities, whose
areas were altered.
The committee may revise this
proposal before it presents it to
the Faculty Senate for a vote in
May. The proposal would go into
effect for the entering freshman
class in 1991.
