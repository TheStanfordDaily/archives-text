THE STvi^FOWT WEE

1983. My little brother walked into our
neighborhood comic book store and picked
up a copy of this oversized, black and white
comic titled, "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles." Frankly, I was hysterical.
In an age of Uncanny X-Men, Avengers
and the Justice League of America, I couldn't
believe that my 10-year-old brother was
sacrificing his minute allowance on this
homemade, poor excuse for a superhero
comic. I took one look at my brother and
laughed.
Twenty-nine issues, one movie, one
animated cartoon series and one huge mar
keting explosion later, my little brother is
laughing at me. Still growing in popularity,
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are ev
erywhere. Their movie grossed one of the
highest all-time opening weekends ($25.4
million), and Turtle merchandise is Amer
ica's hottest fad. What's worse, that first 4
printing of the first issue of TMNT sells
for more than $200. And my brother is
laughing at me.
Who would have thought that four
radioactively mutated turtles would bring
annual revenues of more than $250 million?
For ex-fast-food chef Kevin Eastman and
freelance illustrator Peter Laird, it all started
with a bunch of doodles designed to satirize
the "invulnerable superhero" trend.
According to Turtle legend, the four war
riors were born when a canister of glowing,
radioactive ooze spilled on the four turtles'
iar, covering their bodies as well as splashing
a sewer rat. The chemical gave the rat and
the four turtles intelligence, speech and
remarkable growth in size.
Under the guidance of Splinter the rat,
whose deceased owner was a master of mar
tial arts, the four turtles learned the art of

stealth and became true ninja. Splinter
named his disciples after Renaissance art
ists: the katana-wielding Leonardo,
nunchaku-swinging Michaelangelo (sic),
staff master Donatello and quick-tempered
sai-guy Raphael.
The four turtles' arch enemy is the mur
derer of Splinter's master, commonly known
as the Shredder. Together with his evil foot
clan, the Shredder posed no match for the
four fiesty terrapins.
Seven years after their conception, the
Turtles have fought their way into every
commercial market possible, making them
the third best-selling toy (following Barbie
and Nintendo). What makes the whole mar
keting bonanza so remarkable is its appeal
to different age groups.
Young children are perhaps most familiar
with the Turtles from their animated tele
vision cartoon series, a markedly less violent
show than its bloodspilling comic parallel.
Kids eat their Turtles cereal in the morning,
play with the action figures at school, mi
crowave up some pizza (the Turtles' favorite
food) after school and go to sleep in Turtles
pajamas while cuddling up to their plush
stuffed toys. Cowabunga, dude.
But for the cult fans of the Turtles, the
action and suspense live on. These days,
Eastman and Laird are too busy to work on
their brainchild themselves. However, the
bimonthly comic book (as well as a couple
of spinoffs) remains on the "cutting edge"
of comics, and reissued collections of old
TMNT issues are currently available.
As the Turtle phenomenon continues,
prepare to see tie-ins with Burger King, a
rap-music soundtrack and appearances on
every possible article of clothing. Soon, the
shell game may be up For now, though,
nobody can knock the power of the Turtles,
the most radical reptiles around.
