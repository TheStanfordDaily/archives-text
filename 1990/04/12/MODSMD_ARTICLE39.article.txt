# Totally Shellshocked
## Hit new movie caps off ninja nightmare 
### Chris Harris Staff writer 
Everywhere I look I see those blasted rep
tiles. First they hit the comic books, then
TV and movies, and now — the true sign
of "making it"in the entertainment world
— the front page of Intermission.
God help us all.
Let's step back for a moment and take a
look at this new fad, word for word: Teenage.
Mutant. Ninja. Turtles. I don't get it. In
all appearances, the movie industry has been
invaded by a bad game of Mad-Libs.
Maybe I'm too intellectual for this world,
or maybe I'm just not as hip as I used to
be, but TMNT must be the dumbest
sounding fad since at least as far back as. . . .
Lambada. But this is the land of The
Munsters, the home of Pet Rocks, where
no idea is too stupid for the public at large.
The creators of TMNT are only the latest
in a long line of entrepreneurs to get rich
off the IQ of our nation.
TMNT represent all that's wrong with
our country's youth today. The lazy good
for-nothings spend their unearned al
lowances on half-priced movie tickets and
plastic dolls, instead of Lionel train sets.
And, as if our educational system isn't
bad enough, a whole generation is now
growing up believing Michaelangelo was a
three-foot-nigh lizard Of course, this is only
the continuation of a trend: how many of
us still thmk the plot of "David Coppcrficld"
centers around the disappearance of the
Statue of Liberty?
I refuse to see that cursed movie. I feel
uncomfortable in any theater where I'm the
only person whose feet touch the floor And
any film about four turtles is bound to be
slow-paced.
Besides, if I want to watch a movie about
heroic animals, I'll go sec "Old Yeller." Now

there's a real movie. What can "TMNT"
possibly offer that "Old Yeller" doesn't have-
Only live actors parading around in weird
muppct costumes, like Grimace.
But most importantly, take a look at the
ad for this film.
Bad Sign No. 1: The drawing shows the
Turtles poking their heads out of a sewer.
The last movie ad showing a sewer was
"C.H.U.D."; before that, "Alligator." Movies
with sewers generally carry the theme one
step too far: they stink.
Bad Sign No. 2: A quote from movie critic
Joel "Rubber Stamp" Siegel. Getting a good
review from him is like getting an acceptance
letter from Berkeley. If they have to go to
Siegel for the applause, then watch out.
Bad Sign No. 3: The promo lines. Most
promo lines, if they can't find something
good to say about their movie ("Winner of
32 Academy Awards!!!"), at least try to grab
the reader somehow ("You've read the ad,
now see the movie!"). So what are the two
exceedingly brilliant promos for "TMNT?"
1. "THEY'RE LEAN, GREEN AND ON
THE SCREEN!" Oh, I get it: it rhymes.
Very creative. Doesn't remind me of
"Stripes" at all. Perhaps they should try:
"Hated, Hated and Overrated."
2. (I pause solemnly before uttering such
a profound statement:) "HEY, DUDE, THIS
IS NO CARTOON!" Sure, but neither was
"Old Yeller." And back then, they assumed
the audience could figure it out on its own.
Needless to say, I'm only mildly skeptical
about the intelligence level of this whole
Turtle fad. With luck, the youth of Amenca
will soon realize what morons they've been
and come out from under their shell of
ignorance. But if not, I just may act on this
film idea, "Ugly Slugs Who Know Tae Kwon
Do" ("Hey, Dude, this is no escargot!").
Judging from past experience, it should be
a real winner.
