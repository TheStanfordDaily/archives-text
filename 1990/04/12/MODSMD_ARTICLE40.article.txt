Currently touring the continent, the 1990 Festival of Animation
comes to Palo Alto, bringing 18 short animated films from around
the world. The two-hour film includes Oscar winner John Lasseter's
newest work, "Knickknack," a four-minute piece using more
modern animation techniques. Other works include the Soviet
Union's "All Alone With Nature," Canada's "Black Hula," Great
Britain's "Feet of Song," and the Netherlands' "Uncles and Aunts."
Domestic material includes a new episode of Brad Bird and Tim
Burton's "Family Dog," which originally appeared on network
television. The Festival plays April 12-16 and April 21-22 at the
Spangenberg Auditorium at Gunn High School. Tickets are $6.50
at the box office or $5.50 in advance through BASS outlets.
