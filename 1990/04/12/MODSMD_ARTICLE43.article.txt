## Kline, River drown 'Death' Kasdan's latest is fun but unbalanced, predictable 
### J.T.S. Moore Staff writer 
Let's just say that loey Boca
is the pizza pie industry's equiv
alent to Rasputin. Beat him with
a baseball bat; booby-trap his car;
poison him; shoot him; shoot
him again. The only thing that
probably would ever get Joey
down would be an STD.
Opening with a claim of being
based upon a true story, "I Love
You To Death" moves along in
a fairly predictable manner. Al
most a stereotype of an Italian
immigrant, Joey Boca (Kevin
Kline) owns a pizzeria, speaks
with a heavy accent and con
stantly cheats on his wife. For
tunately for Joey, his wife Rosalie
(Tracy Ullman), rejects the con
stant suggestion by the lusty
pizza boy, Devo (River Phoenix),
that he may not be the safest of
sex partners.
When Rosalie finally sees for
herself that Joey cannot keep his
pants zipped, she confides in her
loony mother, Nadja (Joan

0 1 Love You To Death
Kevin Kline, Tracy Ullman

Plowright). Together they decide
to do the most expedient thing.
Nadja puts a hit out on him.
As fate would have it, Joey has
more lives than a Sly Stallone
character. Panic sets in and
Rosalie and Nadja decide to let
flower child wanna-be Devo
takeover. He shoots Joey once in
the head and then hires two
druggie cousins, Harlan (William
Hurt) and Marlon (Keanu
Reeves) to finish the job. The
highlight of the film, Harlan and
Marlon prove to be just as hap
less.
Docs this hilarious madness
ever end? Yes. The police drop
by the house and send Joey's
friends, family and unacquainted
killers to jail. In the hospital,
Joey has an epiphany and decides
not to press charges. Everyone
goes free, even Devo, and lives
happily ever after.

Director Lawrence Kasdan
serves up an unbalanced film
that is anything but subtle.
When "I Love You To Death"
works, it is very funny. The char
acters of Harlan and Marlon steal
the show. All of this accentuates
the incompatibility of the more
serious moments of the film with
Rosalie.
Lacking the comedic impact
normally associated with her,
Ullman docs an average job in
what is actually a very limited
role. Very little room exists in
her role as the benign, suffering
wife for Ullman to unleash her
humor.
The supporting performances
of Hurt and Reeves are far more
watchablc than that of Kline and
Phoenix. Kline comes off as
doing a parody of native Italians
while Phoenix is just plain ir
ritating.
Like a cold pizza, "I Love You
To Death" definitely has some
tasty parts, but needs more prep
aration to be totally satisfying.
Then again, a lot of people like
cold pizza.
