# 'Cook' is not for squeamish
## 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
About once every decade a film is released that
challenges the accepted bounds of cinematic discre
tion. The 1970s saw Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork
Orange" address the issues of social control and
criminal rehabilitation. In the 1980s, David Lynch
created "Blue Velvet," a psychosexual drama that
was as intense as it was controversial.

oThe Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover
Richard Bohringer

Now, writer/director Peter Greenaway and the
1990s give us "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife &
Her Lover," an intensely dark case study in greed,
lust, passion and revenge. This full-out attack on
the senses is definitely not for the squeamish.
The thief, extortionist Albert Spica, is played by
Michael Gambon in masterful style. Gambon's thief
captures the essence of man's most vile and base
characteristics. He is an appalling example of sadistic
insensitivity toward sex, race, religion, human nature
and toward his wife, Georgina, played by Helen Mir
ren.
The majority of the film — in the form of 10
dinner engagements — takes place somewhere in
London at the lofty French restaurant, "Le Hollan
dais." In this metaphorical setting, it is appropriate
tnat all things be consumed, even if only experimen
tally.
As the title suggests, the plot follows an affair
between Georgina and her intellectual lover, Michael,
played by Alan Howard. Albert assumes that eating
at the exclusive restaurant will
raise his social status, and remains
oblivious to his wife's affair, which
literally takes place between
courses.
Georgina and Michael's affair
begins in the ladies' room and pro
gresses to various pantries and

meat storage coolers. The cook's
role, which is well-performed by
Richard Bohringer, is that of or
chestrating the complex relation
ship between the other three.
The entire production is staged
so that it resembles a play, with
the film opening and closing with
the drawing of curtains. Scenes are
connected with a moving camera
that pans from one scene to the
next. And the final scene includes
a curtain call of sorts by the entire

cast.
In creating his world of sexuality
and violence, Greenaway leaves no
aspect of his film untouched. Al
though he may seem to revel in
the darker aspects of humanity, he
presents them in a highly meta
phorical and consciously artificial
manner.
Whether or not he exceeds the
boundaries of good taste is up to
the viewer to decide.
