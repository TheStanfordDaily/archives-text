Intermission Recommend*!
I Love You To Death
Overall, "I Love You To Death" delivers the
goods, but the funniest scenes are the ones
with William Hurt and Keanu Reeves as two 1
novice hitmen. The film should have focused
on them instead of a stereotyplcally ethnic Kevin
Kline and a dull Tracy Ullman. Be forewarned,
this film is infected with River Phoenix.
Teenage Mutant Nlnja Turtles
Hollywood's attempts to jump-start a pop
culture trend failed with lambada, but thanks
to four turtles, all is not lost. America now has
a marketing phenomenon to replace "Batman."
Go see the movie and remind yourself of how
great you thought "Star Wars" was when you
were a kid.
My Left Foot
The Irish film "My Left Foot" offers an excel
lent alternative to the studio fare currently out.
Both entertaining and moving, the film relates
the story of disabled Irish artist Christy Brown.
j Pretty Woman
If you see film as a medium through which
to expand your mind, then you had better forget
"Pretty Woman." Look beyond the less-than
original story of "Pretty Woman" and you wHi
find a charming romantic comedy.
