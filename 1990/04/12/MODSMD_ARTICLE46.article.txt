# Phillips' thriller lacks 'Power'
## 
### Kelly Parsons Staff writer 
It is a tried and true Hollywood
formula that countless movies
have emulated: the ancient forces
of evil, terrorizing the 20th century
by seeking to exert their
malevolent will over mankind,
force a skeptical hero (or heroine)
to summon the power of the
church and send the fiends back
to Hell.
Well, Satan and his minions are
once again running amuck on the
face of the Earth, and this time,
in"The First Power," they're out
to wreck havoc upon the un
suspecting citizens of Los Angeles.
Lou Diamond Philips stars as
Russel Logan, an L A. homicide
detective who thinks he has seen
the last of brutal serial killer
Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober of

OThe First Power
Lou Diamond Phillips

television's "China Beach") after
Channing sputters out his last
breath in the California gas cham
ber. (Apparently, this man's
lawyers are not quite as skilled as
those currently representing con
victed killer Robert Alton Harris.)
Little does Logan know that
Channing, a disciple of Satan, has
been granted by his dark lord the
"First Power": immortality. Chan
ning's vengeful spirit returns to
haunt the streets of L.A., involving
Logan in a supernatural game of
cat and mouse. Aiding Logan in
his struggle with the bloodthirsty
ghost is a successful psychic
named Tess (Tracy Griffith) and a

nun (Elizabeth Arden).
The primary flaws of "The First
Power" lie in its story, which is
basically an uninspired, rather ri
diculous variation on the church
versus-Satan theme. The plot, con
ceived by writer/director Robert
Resnikoff (who is making his
feature directorial debut with this
film), draws heavily upon a curious
mixture of New Testament text
and outrageously contrived Chris
tian mysticism, and fails to estab
lish any sort of credibility with the
audience.
In contrast, movies such as "The
Exorcist" and"The Omen" are so
powerful partly because of their
painstakingly detailed descriptions
of Bibilical text, which lend a cer
tain degree of "authenticity" that
the laughable premise of the"The
First Power" completely lacks.
The film also raises a significant
question of morality, yet fails to
address it. After he dies, Channing
gains the ability to possess the
bodies of the living, a capability
which poses an interesting prob
lem for those who are fighting him:
although Channing may, in the
guise of a stolen body, attack
whomever he likes, the damage

done to him while he is in this
state harms not him but the un
fortunate person whose body he
has temporarily taken over.
At one point, Logan, his face set
in grim determination, opens a box
full of high explosives and growls
to Tess, "Don't worry. This'll stop
anybody Channing decides to
throw at us." Which would be fine,
except for the fact that Channing,
in his attacks on Logan and Tess,
uses a number of innocent people.
How can Logan morally justify
harming these unwilling partici
pants? On this question the film
remains strangely silent.

Which is not to say that "The
First Power" is entirely devoid of
any entertainment value. The ac
tion sequences are well con
structed and fast-paced while the
stunts, particularly one involving
a leap from the top of a 10-story
building, are fantastic. In addition,
Resnikoff creates some imagina
tive dream sequences which pro
vide some unexpected — albeit
cheap — thrills.
As a movie which aims to hor
rify, however, "The First Power"
is definitely not up to the task at
hand.
