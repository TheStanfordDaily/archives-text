## Reed, Cale emerge from Underground past 
### Chris Harris 
During the 19605, Andy Warhol be
came a cultural legend, as much for
his peculiar character as his experimen
tal art. Desperate for the adoration of
crowds, he shied away from personal
contact. Obsessed witn the images of
others, he never accepted his own ap
pearance.
Late in 1966, Warhol brought the
controversial Velvet Underground to
national attention. Led by Lou Reed
and John Cale, the band became infa
mous for its gritty sound and then
borderline subject matter; like Warhol,
Velvet Underground received mixed,
sometimes hostile reviews. But inner
conflict soon split the group, and each
performer went his separate way.

Songs for Drella

Nearly 20 years later, in 1987, Lou
Reed was a respected solo artist, on the
brink of widespread acclaim for his
monolithic album "New York;" John
Cale had achieved earlier success as a
producer. Andy Warhol, after years of
artistic stagnation, lay dead in a hospi
tal from "surgical complications."
"Songs for Drella/' a personal tribute
to their former benefactor and com
panion, represents the first major
Reed/Cale collaboration since the now
legendary Velvet Underground. In
homage to the father of pop art, the
two have painted their own musical

portrait of Andy Warhol and capture
him with shocking emotion.
The album plays like a psychological
tragedy, courageously entering Warhol's
mind to explain his actions. Cale
describes a young genius, ridiculed by
his hometown ("Bad skin, bad eyes,
gay and fatty"), who moves to the city
and craftily establishes himself in the
art scene. The seductive "Style it Takes"
presents Cale-as-Warhol hypnotizing all
as he moves through the world of art.
The next few songs explore Warhol's
fame and psyche more deeply, from his
silk-screen paintings and experimental
movies ("Images," "Starlight") to a
harsh break-up with Lou Reed ("Work").
In 1969, at the peak of success and
excess, Warhol was shot by an employee
in his studio and never recovered his

artistic sharpness.
After 20 years apart, the two veterans
have in their deceased companion
recaptured some of the dark, acidic
flavor of the Velvet Underground. Al
though not every song shines on its
own, each contributes to the tragic pic
ture of Warhol as seen through the
gritty lens of Reed and Cale.
This lens is hardly an objective one;
their view of Warhol is exceedingly per
sonal, and the bitterness of unresolved
conflicts among the three darkens the
album. But when "Hello It's Me" is
over, and Reed closes with a simple
"Goodbye Andy," one is left with no
doubt that despite all the resentments
and all of his faults, these two men
really loved Andy Warhol.
