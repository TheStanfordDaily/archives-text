# 'Gold' glitters for Church
## 
### Paul Yu 
In today's modern rock world, overpop
ulated by groups that crank out catchy,
guitar-based songs lacking feeling and depth,
The Church has managed to work within
the genre while breaking the prevalent mold
of automaton-produced music. Their latest
offering, "Gold Afternoon Fix," contains
some dizzyingly good songs that are full of
emotion and intensity.
Steve Kilbey, lead vocalist, songwriter and
bassist of the Australian band, is extraor
dinarily good at writing songs in the dis
tinctive dreamy style that has become a
virtual trademark of The Church. But their
newest album infuses this dreaminess with
stark reality. "I don't want to lose that sur
realistic side that obviously attracted people
to us in the first place. . . . But now I want
to get a bit more bite," Kilbey said.
True to their word, "Gold Afternoon Fix"
has a few surprises for old fans. It is nothing
drastically different, but the band's new in
cisiveness occasionally escalates into bitter
ness, as in the song "You're Still Beautiful,"
a sardonic criticism of a once-beautiful wom
an's narcissism and egocentrism. The
chorus is cooly sarcastic: You're still beau
tiful baby/Nobody can take that away/You 're
still beautiful baby/Even when you fall down
that way
This bitterness has infected other aspects
of the music as well. Marty Willson-Piper's
guitar work on the song consists of a
gnawing, heavily vibratoed guitar riff. His
great lead riffs that were the melodic back
drop of The Church's songs of old become
a disturbing wail.
While this change in philosophy adds
some new and interesting elements to the

oThe Church
Gold Afternoon Fix

album, The Church does not fail to deliver
the powerfully dreamy and surreal rock
songs that earned them popularity, a style
that was characteristic of the Church's 1988
breakthrough album, "Starfish." The hit
"Metropolis," the album's first release,
typifies this style of songwriting, with Kil
bey's vocals and Willson-Piper's excellent
guitar lead creating a sense of breathlessness
and vertiginous celebration.
The anthemic "Laughing" is one of the
better songs on the album, containing strong
shades of David Bowie's "Heroes" in its lead
guitar drone-buzz as well as its vaguely
similar chorus. Between choruses, there is
a haunting interlude where vocals are
doubled over an octave, and throughout the
song there is a wonderful interplay of darker
sounding bass, warmer acoustic textures
with bittersweet guitar drones.
Almost all the tracks are very good, and
a few are simply incredible, including "Es
sence," the ethereal "Fading Away" and
"Transient," which highlights guitarist Peter
Koppes' vocal ability. Thanks to more of
the same tight production by Waddy Wach
tel, The Church's sound in "Gold Afternoon
Fix" is slick but not overdone, precise and
yet deep with feeling. Kilbey goes so far as
to claim, productionwise, that the album is
"almost mathematical in its perfection."
This latest from The Church is highly
recommended for old fans, and for anybody
wanting to discover the spirituality and sur
realistic beauty that has enchanted many
listeners.
