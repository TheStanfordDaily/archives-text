# Cutting against the grain
## Faculty salary increases proposed 
### Pam Weisz Staff writer 
In spite of the broad budget
cuts currently being planned, the
University has recommended
salary raises for some faculty and
staff members during the 1990-91
school year.
The recommended raises will be
approximately 4.75 percent for
faculty and 4 percent for staff,
which hovers near the expected
inflation rate.
These percentages are control

figures to be used by supervisors
in allocating raises and do not
apply to all faculty and staff. By
the time next year's operating
budget is worked out, faculty and
staff members may actually
receive more or less than the pro
posed arrjount.
Provost James Rosse wrote in
a draft of the annual Operating
Budget Guidelines that the goal
for faculty salaries is to put them
"at a level that will put Stanford
in a highly competitive position
both nationally and internation

ally for the very best faculty."
In addition, Rosse wrote that
the University is attempting to
maintain "a mid-market position
in relation to other local institu
tions" as far as staff salaries are
concerned. Staff salaries for 1990-
91 are meant to be "lean but com
petitive," Rosse wrote.
The budget paring is part of
the University's efforts to slash
$7.2 million by Sept. 1. The huge
cuts are necessary to achieve a
balanced budget in the next fiscal
year.
