# 'Yellow' play addresses colorful issues

First, let it be said that "Yellow Is My Favorite
Color" is an entertaining play. It is well-written,
well-directed and well-acted. On balance, it pro
vides a very enjoyable evening.
The play, written by Edward Sakamoto, is a
surrealistic portrayal of the life of Henry
Kawamizu, a Japanese-American growing up in
the 19405. As a boy, Henry faithfully watches
World War II propaganda films, and it is painful
to hear him speak of killing "dirty Japs."
Henry's best friend and alter ego is Mino, a
most determined free spirit and non-conformist.
Mino serves as the equivalent of a Greek chorus,
commenting on the action of the play.
Both of the leads are superb. Philip Yu (Henry)
is a loose, likable performer and a good mimic.
Cathy Sun, as Mino, is also very good, giving
the role the amount of toughness and humor
that it requires. However, it was somewhat
confusing to have Sun, a female, playing a male
character.
But according to director Kimi Watanabe, the
gender switch enhanced Mino's role as Henry's
alter ego. One of Henry's problems, Watanabe
said, was an inability to deal with women. This
was demonstrated in several scenes in the play.
An ambiguously female alter ego represented
one more thing Henry had to deal with.
How well the device worked is debatable. In
my mind, the gender switch only served to
desex the Mino character and conruse the au
dience. But Sun was really very good, and I
easily believed Watanabe when she said that
Sun was the best performer for the part.
The play is not very political, at least not in
an obvious way. Henry has experiences that
are unique to Asian-Americans, but also some
that are unique to all Americans.
"There's a lot of talk about what it is to be
an Asian-American," Watanabe said, "but we
want to balance that with what it is to be an
American."
All ac * ors ' with only two exceptions,
had to play more than one role, differentiating
between their various characters. Their success
at this difficult task is a testament to their
versatility.
"They're a wonderful cast," Watanabe said.
"They just have so much energy that I never
had any doubts that the cast would carry it off."

"Yellow Is My Favorite Color" plays through
Saturday at the Nitery Theater in Old Union.
