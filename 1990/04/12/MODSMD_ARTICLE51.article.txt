"Why should I go to Monterey?
I hate aquariums," you declare
stubbornly.
Well, how about sipping a subtle
Chardonnay while enjoying a 180-
degree view of Monterey Bay at
the tasting bar in the Paul Masson
Museum and Tasting Room?
Or maybe you would prefer wol
fing down an order of squid and
chips while exploring a bustling
wharf and the old Cannery Row
that John Steinbeck made famous.
Why not rent a bicycle to tour

WEEKEND
GETA WA YS
First in a weekly series

che glorious 17-Mile Drive before
enjoying a picnic overlooking the
water?
Of course, the Monterey Bay
Aquarium is the best-known at
traction on the peninsula. But
Monterey is alive with other pos
sibilities for a day trip from the
Farm, or even an enjoyable week

end away from the stress of
campus life.
When approaching Monterey on
Highway 1, take the Central Mon
terey exit and follow the signs to
the visitors' center located on
Camino El Estero. You can pick
up basic information at the center,
but don't expect too much from
the staff other than a map of Mon -
terey.
Another place to pick up infor
mation is at the Rodrigues-Osio
Adobe located on Alvarado Street.
Head west along Camino El Es
tero and turn left onto Del Monte
Avenue. This street will take you

directly to the Fisherman's Wharf.
Two wharfs extend into the bay
from Monterey harbor. The north
ern wharf, called Municipal Wharf,
doesn't feature the shops and res
taurants of Fisherman's Wharf.
But it also doesn't feature crowds
of tourists, and it's a quiet place
to view the harbor. If you are lucky,
you might see an otter swimming
under the pier.
The best way to fully explore
the Bay, for the non-scuba diver,
is via one of the boat tours offered
from Fisherman's Wharf. Prices
range from around $2.50 for a 20-
minute or longer tour of the Bay

in a charter craft. Both Glass Bot
tom Belle and Princess Monterey
Cruises offer good narrated tours
that regularly scout out sea otters,
sea lions and harbor seals.
Follow the signs from the wharf
to Cannery Row, where you will
find a large, well-located parking
garage that provides easy access.
The street was the site of many
canneries that packed sardines
caught in the Bay for shipment
around the world.
The aquarium is the cornerstone
of the south end of Cannery Row
and is housed in the old Hovden

cannery, which was the last to
close.
The Steinbeck Remembrance
Room Museum, open free to the
public, is now housed in the Wing
Chong market. The opening scene
of the book "Cannery Row"
focuses on this building, which is
a required stop for Steinbeck fans.
As you will probably discover if
you visit Monterey, whether on
bike or on foot, the best places are
off the beaten path and require
adventurous exploration to discov
er. Don't spend a full day at Can
nery Row or the aquarium. Explore
and discover your own little gems.
