## 'Ninja Turtles': childhood fun 
### Greg Douglas Staff writer 
Imagine this — you are waiting in a dark theater,
surrounded by hundreds of chattering children, when
suddenly, from the front of the room, an image of
four green martial artists emerges. The children are
transfixed by these apparitions, and silence falls over
the crowd.
That is, until one brave youth exclaims "Turtle
Power" with all his throaty might, evoking sounds
of awe from the rest of the pre- pubescent audience.
Does it sound like a Martian brain-washing plot
to destroy the minds of the next generation of Amer
icans? Well, it's not, but it's a close second. You are
witnessing the advent of "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" to the big screen.
Finally, the fabled adventurers of comic book and
cartoon lore attain the most glorious honor, their
own live-action feature film. And, believe it or not,
as far as costumes and action go, they make the
transition rather well.
From the viewpoint of the little boy in me who
thrilled to watch Luke Skywalker defeat a might
ATAT with a lowly snowspeeder, the movie was
pretty good. The karate action sequences were well
done, and the turtles — Donatello, Michaelangelo,
Leonardo and Raphael — were convincingly buff.

OK, OK, so the character development was a little
on the light side, and the plot was every Saturday
morning cartoon about the good guys versus the
evildoers. So what? It's a turtle fan's dream come
true, with lots of karate, pizza and even Splinter, the
wise rat mentor of our favorite Renaissance kick
backs.
The violence is clean, too. Although everyone is
brandishing various types of sharp and blunt
weaponry, never is a drop of blood revealed, because
everyone seems to just get knocked out. Yeah, it's
kind of cheesy, but that way Mom and Pop won't
get upset.
This movie even has a cute little moral story about
how all single dads really love their sons and that
staying with Dad instead of running away from home
is pretty important. It's not very deep, and hopefully
it wasn't trying to be.
Hey, I enjoyed it, OK? And so would a lot of other
people out there who would probably never admit
it. Lighten up, go see it with your younger brother
or sister, or your significant other who acts like a
pre-teen sometimes. It's fun!
