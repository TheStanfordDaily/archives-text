# Debate over Ohlone bones resurrected
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Stanford's 550 Ohlone Indian skeletal remains,
some of which are 5,000 years old, have assumed
new life.
In a letter Monday to Provost James Rosse, Bay
Area Ohlone representatives asked the University
to continue its scientific research on the bones,
while another Ohlone group is pressing to have the
bones reburied. Meanwhile, 130 of the bones are
on loan to San Jose State University, and the
remainder are in storage in the Stanford Art
Museum.
Debate has been raging over the remains since
July, when the University set a national precedent
by announcing it was going to hand over the remains
to local Ohlone descendants for reburial. A group
of 30 families represented by Ohlone tribe member
Rosemary Cambra had asked the University to end
its research on the bones.
They asserted that the bones were sacred and
that the scientific study was disrespectful.
But Andrew Galvan, an Ohlone who sent the
letter to Rosse and says he represents more than
900 tribal descendants, asked that the study on the
bones continue.
Other representatives who signed the letter in
cluded Ella Rodriguez of Salinas, who represents
more than 200 Ohlone, and Kenneth Marquis of
San Jose, who represents more than 300 descen
dants.
Galvan wrote that although the Ohlone wish
proper interment of their ancestral remains, they
want the University to continue its research for the
present.
Before the University decided to return the bones,
it hired an independent archaeologist to conduct a
report on whether the bones had scientific value.
UC-Santa Barbara Archaeology Prof. Philip Walker,
who was hired wich the agreement of the Ohlone,
stated in his 70-page report that most of the remains
could be further studied.
Walker wrote that further research could provide
valuable information for scientists studying archae
ology, paleoanthropology, medicine and forensic re
search. He added that researchers could gain more
information about the Ohlone tribe's population
