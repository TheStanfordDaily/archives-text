# Debate over Ohlone bones resurrected
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Stanford's 550 Ohlone Indian skeletal remains,
some of which are 5,000 years old, have assumed
new life.
In a letter Monday to Provost James Rosse, Bay
Area Ohlone representatives asked the University
to continue its scientific research on the bones,
while another Ohlone group is pressing to have the
bones reburied. Meanwhile, 130 of the bones are
on loan to San Jose State University, and the
remainder are in storage in the Stanford Art
Museum.
Debate has been raging over the remains since
July, when the University set a national precedent
by announcing it was going to hand over the remains
to local Ohlone descendants for reburial. A group
of 30 families represented by Ohlone tribe member
Rosemary Cambra had asked the University to end
its research on the bones.
They asserted that the bones were sacred and
that the scientific study was disrespectful.
But Andrew Galvan, an Ohlone who sent the
letter to Rosse and says he represents more than
900 tribal descendants, asked that the study on the
bones continue.
Other representatives who signed the letter in
cluded Ella Rodriguez of Salinas, who represents
more than 200 Ohlone, and Kenneth Marquis of
San Jose, who represents more than 300 descen
dants.
Galvan wrote that although the Ohlone wish
proper interment of their ancestral remains, they
want the University to continue its research for the
present.
Before the University decided to return the bones,
it hired an independent archaeologist to conduct a
report on whether the bones had scientific value.
UC-Santa Barbara Archaeology Prof. Philip Walker,
who was hired wich the agreement of the Ohlone,
stated in his 70-page report that most of the remains
could be further studied.
Walker wrote that further research could provide
valuable information for scientists studying archae
ology, paleoanthropology, medicine and forensic re
search. He added that researchers could gain more
information about the Ohlone tribe's population
movement, bone structure, cul
ture, DNA analysis and disease.
In his report, Walker also stated
that "a detailed analysis ... could
produce results of considerable
value in understanding the causes
of specific hereditary diseases in
modern people."
University archaeologist Bar
bara Bocek has said she found
the report's conclusions unsatis
factory because Walker did not
provide all the information which
the Ohlones requested.
But Anthropology Prof. Bert
Gerow, who was curator of the
Art Museum for 40 years and was
responsible for uncovering about
half of the bones, said the report
has been kept under cover. "The
University has made no attempt
to have this report publicized,"
he said.
Galvan said that for the Uni
versity to ignore a report for
which it has generously paid is
"foolish."
Gerow said Cambra represents

very few of the Ohlone, adding,
"I don't know who she does rep
resent." He said the University
had "proceeded on the assump
tion" that it was negotiating with
a more representative Ohlone
group.
Galvan emphasized that Stan
ford cannot say it has "reached
an agreement with the majority
of the Ohlone people," but that
it has only reached an agreement
with some. He estimated that
4,000 to 5,000 Ohlone live in the
Bay Area, but many do not realize
they have Ohlone blood. He added
that no full- or half-bloods are
still living.
The debate over the fate of the

bones has raised an old ethical
question over which value should
have precedence â€” a scientific
quest for knowledge or the respect
for native cultures and traditions.
Many American Indian groups
across the nation claim that the
display and study of their an
cestral bones is offensive and dis
respectful. They feel they have a
right to require universities and
museums to turn over the re
mains for reburial.
But other American Indians
disagree. "Our [Ohlone] myt
hologies are gone," Gal van said.
He said he believes that modern
medical discoveries should out
weigh ancient bones.
