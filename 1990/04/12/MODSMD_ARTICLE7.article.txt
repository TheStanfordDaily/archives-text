# Slates seek to cope with cuts
## 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
The two rival Council of Presi
dents slates have offered a wide
array of responses to huge Uni
versity budget cutbacks that in
clude a 20 percent reduction in
funds for the ASSU
The current ASSU budget is ap
proximately $200,000, but it must
be reduced to $160,000 next year
as part of the University's effort
to slash its budget and streamline
its procedures. The People's Plat
form and Students First COP
slates are both offering several
suggestions to absorb the cuts
without significantly hurting the
services which the ASSU provides.
One of the proposals by the Stu
dents First slate is to eliminate
"duplicate" student services. "The
ASSU can cooperate with existing
programs and need not strike out
on its own ventures to provide
valuable student services," said
Cecilia Tom, a freshman running
on the Students First slate.
According to Tom, the ASSU
can work with the Bookstore to
create more affordable prices for
students rather than operating a
"Beat the Bookstore" service.
Likewise, Students First members
said existing off-campus airport
shuttle services are more feasible
than the ASSU shuttle service.
The People's Platform slate has
not yet decided whether it would
cut existing programs, such as the
airport shuttle and Beat the Book
store, to cope with the budget
slash. "Although some existing
services will have to be trimmed,
we are uncomfortable to propose
any cuts without first soliciting
more student input," said People's
Platform COP slate member Jay
Tucker.
"It would be easy for us to pro
pose cuts, but it isn't really fair
to do so until we can better assess
what the students want to cut,"
Tucker said. The current COP is
conducting polls and surveys to
determine exactly what the stu
dents want. According to Tucker,

these polls
should be com
pleted within
the next two
weeks.
Aside from
cutting such

programs, the
Students First COP slate is
proposing significant administra
tive trimming and salary cuts.
"There is a lot of fat that can be
cut from the ASSU," said slate
member Tim Marklein. The
slate's proposed cuts include
reduced staff positions and a 25
percent salary cut for COP mem
bers.
Any other suggestions for cuts
to the ASSU budget will be

solicited from students through
surveys and polls conducted by
Students First, he said.
"Even with the budget cuts that
affect the ASSU, our proposals
will allow for the expansion of
student services," said Students
First slate member Mike Canul.
Such expansion includes an enter
tainment shuttle to provide regu
lar transportation to Palo Alto,
as well as graduate student child
care options, computer facilities
and increased library hours.
At this point, the People's Plat
form's proposed cutbacks are lim
ited to staff reductions and
administrative streamlining of the

ASSU. Tucker said, "With cuts of
20 percent, at least one service
will have to be cut."
Another way in which the
People's Platform hopes to reduce
expenses is by promoting a greater
concern for volunteerism. "The
more people that want to get in
volved in the ASSU, the less

money we'll have to pay to hire
people," noted Tucker.
Aside from the implications
that the budget cuts will have on
next year's COP, much of the in
itial planning and response to the
financial situation is being taken
care of by the current COP, said
People's Platform slate member
Goodwin Liu. However, he said,
"budget cuts will inevitably spill
over into the services that next
year's COP will be able to pro
vide."
