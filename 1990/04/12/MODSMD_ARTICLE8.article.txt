# Absence of annual joke slate could be no laughing matter

Though many hotly con
tested issues will play a large
part in this year's Council of
Presidents race, the factor that
could decide the election is
somewhat of a joke.

News analysis

Some campus observers note
that the absence of the Stan
ford Chapparal's traditional
"joke" COP slate may greatly
influence who wins the COP
elections next week.
With a tight race expected
between the People's Platform
and Students First parties, the
marginal 10 to 15 percent of
student voters who usually vote
for the humor magazine's slate
may swing votes away from the
People's Platform, some stu
dent observers say.

Traditional Chapparal voters
often claim that the ASSU is
too serious an organization and
that the People's Platform is
at the root of the effort to make
the ASSU a more serious stu
dent government. These stu
dents usually vote simply to
claim fee refunds the next year
and care little for the political
process, student analysts say.
Also, these apathetic voters
are likely to be a factor because
the controversial ASSU amend
ment that would abolish fee
refunds will be a heavy incen
tive to go to the polls.
"I think a lot of those voters
[who would vote for the Chap
paral] will still come out and
vote," said Stacey Leyton,
former People's Platform COP
member and current ASSU
graduate senator. "It could
make a difference in the elec
tion."
One certain result of this year's
two-slate contest is the impos
sibility of a runoff. Last year, the
Chapparal garnered 14.6 percent
of the vote, which prevented
either of the other two slates from
pulling a simple mfyority. The en
suing runoff saw lower voter turn
out, much because students did
not need to vote to be guaranteed
a fee refund for the next year.
"I believe that there is more of
a likelihood that we would take
votes away from Students First,"
said Perry Friedman, a Chapparal
staff member for several years.
"The People's Platform support
ers are more hardline in support
of their party. Generally, people
vote for the People's Platform or
against it. It's not really that they
choose to vote for Students First."
But students who vote the
Chapparal might also tend to vote
against any group that is per
ceived to hold power. "The people
that vote for a group like the
Chappie do so because they are
not satisfied," said Leonard Adler,
a member of the COP two years
ago and a founder of Students
First. "They feel that the student
government is not being very re
warding to them."
"I definitely think it helps us,"
Students First slate member Tim

Marklein said. "These people
[that would vote for the Chappie]
are more apt to vote for us, being
the party that is not in power.
They don't feel represented by the
People's Platform."
Ingrid Nava, a member both of
this year's COP and of the
People's Platform "Four Our Fu
ture" slate, disagreed that people
will vote against People's Plat
form. "I give students more cred
it," she said. "Hopefully, they'll
make a real decision."
"Four Our Future" member Jay
Tucker agreed with Nava, saying
that traditional Chapparal sup
porters would vote for the
People's Platform because they
want a more relevant student gov
ernment.
ASSU elections commissioner
Steve Krauss noted that the other
incentives to vote will draw out
those voters who do not care
about student government.
"I think the constitutional
amendment [concerning fee
refunds] has the potential to draw
out a significant portion of the
population that doesn't [usually]
vote," he said. "The amendment
has the potential to be relevant
to a lot of people."
Krauss also noted, however,
that voters have the options of
writing in a slate not on the ballot
or skipping the COP vote entirely
when they fill out the computer
ized ballot.
Last year there was consider

able sentiment that the Chapparai
slate captured enough of the dis
enchanted, anti-People's Platform
voters to sink Students First.
"We didn't feel it would be
proper to align ourselves with any
particular group," Friedman said.
"We didn't want to tick anybody
off, and it wasn't our place to
endorse anyone."
Students First desperately
needed the endorsement, because
it would have needed 90 percent
of the Chapparai voters — 683
students — to win last spring's
election. As it was, the election
only went to the runoff because
the People's Platform missed a
majority by 93 votes.
"I don't think [the Chapparai
voters] affected the results
much," Nava said.
Still, the Chapparai slate poten
tially had a large impact last year.
"If we hadn't been in the election,
Students First could have won,"
said a Chapparai staff member,
who did not wish to give a name.
"The Chappie slate did not with
draw in time, and Students First
lost by the same margin."
This year, the Chapparai
decided against running a slate
for a number of reasons. "We're
putting out five issues this year,"
said last year's editor, Helen
Chang, who was a member of last
spring's Hammer and Coffin slate.
"It took a lot of time — putting
up fliers, doing debates all over
the place."

After losing its fee assessment
in last year's election and having
financial difficulties this year, the
Chapparai staff also felt it needed
to devote more time to other
things.
However, Friedman admitted
there were political considera
tions. One of the Chapparai staff's
concerns was that it did not want
to help decrease free speech with
a more restrictive Fundamental
Standard, something that the
People's Platform has campaigned
for.
"The Chappie decided against
running a slate this year because
if we did so we would be benefit
ting the people that are out to
restrict free speech," the un
named Chapparai source said.
However, Friedman, who is also
a member of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, noted that
this was not as much of a problem
with this year's revised amend
ment as it would have been last
year.
Students First has campaigned
against the revisions to the Fun
damental Standard.
The Chapparal's "traditional"
slate has not been as traditional
in recent years.
"It used to be a more common
thing [to run a Chappie slate],"
Friedman said. "When they won,
they actually had a serious plat
form. Last year, it wasn't serious.
We were sort of surprised at the
number of votes we got."
