# Absence of annual joke slate could be no laughing matter

Though many hotly con
tested issues will play a large
part in this year's Council of
Presidents race, the factor that
could decide the election is
somewhat of a joke.

News analysis

Some campus observers note
that the absence of the Stan
ford Chapparal's traditional
"joke" COP slate may greatly
influence who wins the COP
elections next week.
With a tight race expected
between the People's Platform
and Students First parties, the
marginal 10 to 15 percent of
student voters who usually vote
for the humor magazine's slate
may swing votes away from the
People's Platform, some stu
dent observers say.

Traditional Chapparal voters
often claim that the ASSU is
too serious an organization and
that the People's Platform is
at the root of the effort to make
the ASSU a more serious stu
dent government. These stu
dents usually vote simply to
claim fee refunds the next year
and care little for the political
process, student analysts say.
Also, these apathetic voters
are likely to be a factor because
the controversial ASSU amend
ment that would abolish fee
refunds will be a heavy incen
tive to go to the polls.
"I think a lot of those voters
[who would vote for the Chap
paral] will still come out and
vote," said Stacey Leyton,
former People's Platform COP
member and current ASSU
graduate senator. "It could
make a difference in the elec
tion."
