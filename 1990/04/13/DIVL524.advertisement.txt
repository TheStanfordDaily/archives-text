PRACTICE MEDICINE.
NOT PAPERWORK.
In Navy Medicine the
emphasis is on patients,
not paperwork.
As a Navy doctor,
you step into an active
and challenging group
practice. You work with
state-of-the-art equip
ment and the best
facilities available.
Highly trained
physician's assistants,
hospital corpsmen,
nurses and hospital
administrators not only
provide medical support, they attend to almost all the paperwork. As a result, you're
free to make medical decisions based solely on the needs of your patients.
Along with your professional development, you'll enjoy the lifestyle and fringe
benefits of a Navy officer. Beginning salaries are comparable with hospital stall
positions for most specialists.
