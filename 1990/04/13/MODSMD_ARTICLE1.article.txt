# Learning the art of the cocktail

### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
In a stuffy room nestled on the
second floor of the Varian Physics
Building, Eric Mathewson is explain
ing chemistry.
"One-fifty-one proof rum is roughly
equal to 75.5 percent alcohol," he tells
a class of 20 students. A sea of heads
nods in agreement. One student hur
riedly writes the equation on a piece
of paper — it just might appear on
the final exam.
Under other circumstances this
would be a typical science lab. But
when the bespectacled teacher tells
his captivated audience to mix the
bottles of liquid at each student's work
area, the reaction is anything but
chemical.
"It's vodka time!" a spirited student
grunts. "I love decadence!" blurts an
other.
Welcome to Bartending 101, a spe
cial ASSU-sponsored class, where
"spills, drills and marketable skills"

are promised in the syllabus — and
the spirits of Bacchus reign supreme.
"After taking this class, even after
the first day, you can struggle as a
bartender," says Mathewson, the
course's instructor.
"You will have the basics to get by,"
he adds.
"Professor" Mathewson, actually an
undergraduate at UC-Berkeley,
should know.
Mathewson first learned the art of
preparing drinks when a vodka
drinking father "would come home
from work and ask his 7-year-old kid
to fix him a drink."
Today, as a part-time professional
bartender and head of his own corpo
rate events planning firm, the smooth
talking, Clark Kent look-alike says he
sees the class as a way to share bar
room experience and humor with
Stanford students.
Besides, Mathewson views the
course as repaying an old debt.
"1 literally owe my life to Stan
ford. .. . My parents met here!" he
jokes.

Calling bartenders the "aristocracy
of the restaurant business," Mathe
wson says his trade is not only lucra
tive — he's earned as much as $460
in tips alone in less than eight hours
— but teaches management and en
trepreneurial skills.
"Sure beats working at food serv
ice," he says. "This business has good
money for students. Some of my stu
dents have taken a quarter off, gone
to ski resorts and done it — tend bar
by night, ski by day. An easy $20 per
hour, no problem."
However, not all students in the
class are out to make a fast dollar.
"I always make drinks by improvis
ing," says freshman Tera Martin. "1
wanted to learn how to do it the right
way."
Rohan Sippy, also a freshman, says
he feels Bartending 101 "is a lot more
fun than Computer Science 106B."
"It's a bit more useful too," he says.

several years ago but was canceled
due to "shrinking demand."
"Students had been asking for
the class and the ASSU wanted
it, so it is back," Risch said.
For a one-time $135 fee, part
of which pays for an all-day ex
cursion to Napa Valley, students
receive a drink recipe manual, a
list of liquors and beers, and a
bar kit complete with wine opener,
pour spout, champagne opener
and other goodies.
Students also learn bits of
handy advice — why you should
not eat the worm in Tequila
bottles, for instance.
Risch says interested students
can enroll in the class on Mondav

by attending. The class meets
from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. and from
8 to 10 p.m.
"All they have to bring is a
check and a fun attitude. It's a
fun class where you can get out
what you put in,"he says.
Of course, some students were
finding that trying hard is not
enough. During a "pouring drill"
Robert Eng, a non-Stanford stu
dent in the class, was handling
his glasses like hot potatoes and
filling shot glasses until they over
flowed.
"It looks easy, but here I am
spilling stuff all over the table,"
he says, eyeing a large puddle. "I
am glad we are using water and
not the real stuff this time." ,
Like any Stanford professor,
Mathewson says in his class no
question is a silly question. Well,
almost any question.

"Is there a drink with vodka
and apple juice? I tried it out of
desperation," asks senior Pattie
Hand.
"Well," Mathewson pauses, "I
would be worried about that one
.. . I'd rather do vodka straight."
The class laughs, and so does
an embarrassed Hand. But that
is what Bartending 101 is all
about — fun, learning and asking
silly questions.
And in June, students will
receive a bartending certificate,
which is legally worthless but
good for "your own esteem and
self-entertainment," according to
Mathewson.
Hand says she has no earth
shattering expectations from the
class.
"I just think it is a fitting way
to end [my time] at Stanford,"
she adds.

good for "your own esteem and
self-entertainment," according to
Mathewson.
Hand says she has no earth
shattering expectations from the
class.
"I just think it is a fitting way
to end [my time] at Stanford,"
she adds.
In a stuffy room nestled on the
second floor of the Varian Physics
Building, Eric Mathewson is explain
ing chemistry.
"One-fifty-one proof rum is roughly
equal to 75.5 percent alcohol," he tells
a class of 20 students. A sea of heads
nods in agreement. One student hur
riedly writes the equation on a piece
of paper — it just might appear on
the final exam.
Under other circumstances this
would be a typical science lab. But
when the bespectacled teacher tells
his captivated audience to mix the
bottles of liquid at each student's work
area, the reaction is anything but
chemical.
"It's vodka time!" a spirited student
grunts. "I love decadence!" blurts an
other.
Welcome to Bartending 101, a spe
cial ASSU-sponsored class, where
"spills, drills and marketable skills"

are promised in the syllabus — and
the spirits of Bacchus reign supreme.
"After taking this class, even after
the first day, you can struggle as a
bartender," says Mathewson, the
course's instructor.
"You will have the basics to get by,"
he adds.
"Professor" Mathewson, actually an
undergraduate at UC-Berkeley,
should know.
Mathewson first learned the art of
preparing drinks when a vodka
drinking father "would come home
from work and ask his 7-year-old kid
to fix him a drink."
Today, as a part-time professional
bartender and head of his own corpo
rate events planning firm, the smooth
talking, Clark Kent look-alike says he
sees the class as a way to share bar
room experience and humor with
Stanford students.
Besides, Mathewson views the
course as repaying an old debt.
"1 literally owe my life to Stan
ford. .. . My parents met here!" he
jokes.

Calling bartenders the "aristocracy
of the restaurant business," Mathe
wson says his trade is not only lucra
tive — he's earned as much as $460
in tips alone in less than eight hours
— but teaches management and en
trepreneurial skills.
"Sure beats working at food serv
ice," he says. "This business has good
money for students. Some of my stu
dents have taken a quarter off, gone
to ski resorts and done it — tend bar
by night, ski by day. An easy $20 per
hour, no problem."
However, not all students in the
class are out to make a fast dollar.
"I always make drinks by improvis
ing," says freshman Tera Martin. "1
wanted to learn how to do it the right
way."
Rohan Sippy, also a freshman, says
he feels Bartending 101 "is a lot more
fun than Computer Science 106B."
"It's a bit more useful too," he says.
ASSU special projects director Mi
chael Risch says the class was taught

Sophomore Ted Lippert and senior Cindy Seeger listen eagerly as they are instructed on the finer points of
mixing booze.
several years ago but was canceled
due to "shrinking demand."
"Students had been asking for
the class and the ASSU wanted
it, so it is back," Risch said.
For a one-time $135 fee, part
of which pays for an all-day ex
cursion to Napa Valley, students
receive a drink recipe manual, a
list of liquors and beers, and a
bar kit complete with wine opener,
pour spout, champagne opener
and other goodies.
Students also learn bits of
handy advice — why you should
not eat the worm in Tequila
bottles, for instance.
Risch says interested students
can enroll in the class on Mondav

by attending. The class meets
from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. and from
8 to 10 p.m.
"All they have to bring is a
check and a fun attitude. It's a
fun class where you can get out
what you put in,"he says.
Of course, some students were
finding that trying hard is not
enough. During a "pouring drill"
Robert Eng, a non-Stanford stu
dent in the class, was handling
his glasses like hot potatoes and
filling shot glasses until they over
flowed.
"It looks easy, but here I am
spilling stuff all over the table,"
he says, eyeing a large puddle. "I
am glad we are using water and
not the real stuff this time." ,
Like any Stanford professor,
Mathewson says in his class no
question is a silly question. Well,
almost any question.

"Is there a drink with vodka
and apple juice? I tried it out of
desperation," asks senior Pattie
Hand.
"Well," Mathewson pauses, "I
would be worried about that one
.. . I'd rather do vodka straight."
The class laughs, and so does
an embarrassed Hand. But that
is what Bartending 101 is all
about — fun, learning and asking
silly questions.
And in June, students will
receive a bartending certificate,
which is legally worthless but
good for "your own esteem and
self-entertainment," according to
Mathewson.
Hand says she has no earth
shattering expectations from the
class.
"I just think it is a fitting way
to end [my time] at Stanford,"
she adds.
