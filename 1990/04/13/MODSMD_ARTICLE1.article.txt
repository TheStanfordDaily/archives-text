# Learning the art of the cocktail

### Robert L. Jamieson Jr. Staff writer 
In a stuffy room nestled on the
second floor of the Varian Physics
Building, Eric Mathewson is explain
ing chemistry.
"One-fifty-one proof rum is roughly
equal to 75.5 percent alcohol," he tells
a class of 20 students. A sea of heads
nods in agreement. One student hur
riedly writes the equation on a piece
of paper — it just might appear on
the final exam.
Under other circumstances this
would be a typical science lab. But
when the bespectacled teacher tells
his captivated audience to mix the
bottles of liquid at each student's work
area, the reaction is anything but
chemical.
"It's vodka time!" a spirited student
grunts. "I love decadence!" blurts an
other.
Welcome to Bartending 101, a spe
cial ASSU-sponsored class, where
"spills, drills and marketable skills"

are promised in the syllabus — and
the spirits of Bacchus reign supreme.
"After taking this class, even after
the first day, you can struggle as a
bartender," says Mathewson, the
course's instructor.
"You will have the basics to get by,"
he adds.
"Professor" Mathewson, actually an
undergraduate at UC-Berkeley,
should know.
Mathewson first learned the art of
preparing drinks when a vodka
drinking father "would come home
from work and ask his 7-year-old kid
to fix him a drink."
Today, as a part-time professional
bartender and head of his own corpo
rate events planning firm, the smooth
talking, Clark Kent look-alike says he
sees the class as a way to share bar
room experience and humor with
Stanford students.
Besides, Mathewson views the
course as repaying an old debt.
"1 literally owe my life to Stan
ford. .. . My parents met here!" he
jokes.

Calling bartenders the "aristocracy
of the restaurant business," Mathe
wson says his trade is not only lucra
tive — he's earned as much as $460
in tips alone in less than eight hours
— but teaches management and en
trepreneurial skills.
"Sure beats working at food serv
ice," he says. "This business has good
money for students. Some of my stu
dents have taken a quarter off, gone
to ski resorts and done it — tend bar
by night, ski by day. An easy $20 per
hour, no problem."
However, not all students in the
class are out to make a fast dollar.
"I always make drinks by improvis
ing," says freshman Tera Martin. "1
wanted to learn how to do it the right
way."
Rohan Sippy, also a freshman, says
he feels Bartending 101 "is a lot more
fun than Computer Science 106B."
"It's a bit more useful too," he says.

Sophomore Ted Lippert and senior Cindy Seeger listen eagerly as they are instructed on the finer points of
mixing booze.
