## 
### Danzy Senna Editorial staff 
More than 400 black students from
at least 40 California schools will gather
at Stanford this weekend for the eighth
annual African/Black Student Statewide
Alliance Conference.
Freshman Nicole Johnson, one of the
conference coordinators, called the con
ference a "watershed in the black stu
dent movement in California."
California's alliance is one of the few
statewide black student networks in the
country. It was founded at UCLA in
1982 by Black Student Union represen
tatives from various college campuses.
The first conference was held at Stan
ford the following spring, and 60 stu
dents from 22 different schools attended.
The theme of this year's conference
is "Back on the Block: Black Students

in the '90s Fighting for Unity, Power
and Pride."
The keynote speakers will be Cecelia
Arrington, director of the Ethnic
Studies program at Merritt College, and
Pedro Noguera, a professor at UC-
Berkeley.
The featured event will be the "Posi
tively Black" awards reception, dedi
cated to Nelson Mandela.
Awards will be given to San Fransisco
49ers football players Eric Wright and
Keena Turner as well as to Kurt Rob
inson, all of whom founded the Champs
Foundation which offers programs and
services for underprivileged youth.
Edwin Hawkins, of the Hawkins fam
ily gospel choir, will also receive an
award.
Stanford BSU vice chair Louis Jack
son will give the student keynote ad
dress at the awards program.

A discussion will be held on the sub
ject of how the current generation of
black students can help combat the
crisis in education. Currently, more
black men are in prison than in college.
Students will also participate in
workshops examining the concerns of
black students in high schools, commu
nity colleges and universities.
Students from more than 12 high
schools are expected to attend.
Over the past three years, the
statewide alliance has worked in coali
tion with statewide MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student organization, and
the Asian/Pacific Islander Student
Union to help write legislation on the
state's education policy.
The alliance has also worked with
such political leaders as As
semblywoman Maxine Waters and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
