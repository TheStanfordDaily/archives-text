# Speaker explores drug war's motivations
## 
### Brooke Hart 
The United States will fail to win its
so-called "war on drugs" if it continues
to employ belligerent means while fight
ing for a benevolent end, Boston Uni
versity Emeritus Prof. Howard Zinn
said last night.
Zinn's speech before 200 in Cubberley
Auditorium kicked off "Demons of the
Drug Wars: Behind the Hype," a week
end conference at Stanford.
An advocate of non-violent civil dis
obedience, Zinn criticized the use of
"guns, planes, invasions and bombs to
benefit the human race."
Placing the drug issue in a broader
foreign policy perspective, he chastised
the United States for what he called
"hypocritical" dealings with drug
polluted nations. For example, Zinn
said, the United States condemns

Thailand for prohibiting cigarette im
ports, yet U.S. military forces pillage
Central and South American cities in
search of drug rings, ignoring Colom
bia's failing economy.
Under the veil of anti-drug sentiment,
the U.S. government plays upon the
anti-communist and racist suscep
tibilities of its citizens to justify manip
ulation of foreign governments, Zinn
said.
The remainder of this weekend's con
ference will examine the deployment of
force and funds by the United States
in its national and international battle
against drugs.
The conference features four panels
of community activists, educators and
politicians from the United States and
Central and South America. All panel
discussions will be held in History Cor
ner, room 303.

The first, "Drug Use: Myth and
Reality," begins Friday at 3:15 p.m.,
followed by "Community Response to
the Drug War" at 5 p.m.
Saturday's agenda includes a discus
sion of "Racism and Domestic Policy"
at 10 a.m. and a noon lunch at El Centro
Chicano. "Drug Wars and U.S. Policy
in Latin America" at 3 p.m. precedes a
closing address by Karen Vask, a phy
sicians' assistant with the Los Angeles
Coalition Against Police Abuse. Vask
will speak at 6:30 p.m. in Annenberg
Auditorium.
The conference is sponsored by the
Chicano Graduate Student Association,
Stanford Central American Action Net
work, Black Graduate Student Associa
tion, Black Student Union, MEChA,
Stanford Action for Nuclear Disarma
ment, and the National Lawyers Guild.
