Police end Christian protest
JERUSALEM (AP) — Police fired tear gas
yesterday to end a Christian protest over a
Jewish settlement and fought Palestinian
stone-throwers as foreign tourists visiting the
city for Easter tried to avoid the violence.
The street battles with young Arabs oc
curred in Jerusalem's Old City near the Church
of the Holy Sepulcher as thousands of tourists
were visiting this Biblical setting for Easter
celebrations.
The protest by Christian clerics focused on
a nearby settlement of 150 Jews in the Arab
Christian quarter. The Jerusalem magistrate's
court, responding to a lawsuit by the Greek
Orthodox Church, ruled late yesterday the set
tlers must leave.
However, a spokesman for the settlers, David
Ben-Ami, said they would appeal, and police
agreed for now not to expel them.
Also yesterday, the Palestinian Al-Haq-Law
in the Service of Man human rights group
said a Palestine activist killed last week by
soldiers in the West Bank was shot in the
back of the head without provocation.
Colombians uncover mass grave
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The bodies of
25 people, some of whom had been missing
for months, were found buried in a common
grave in northern Colombia, a police general
said yesterday.
Gen. Octavio Vargas, the chief of police op
erations, said the bodies were found Wednes
day near the town of Valencia on the property
of Fidel Castano.
Authorities have accused Castano of leading
a right-wing death squad that has killed several
leftists and union leaders.
Some of the bodies were victims of a mass
kidnapping Jan. 13 in the town of Pueblo
Bello, Vargas said in a radio interview. An
unidentified group abducted 39 people in the
town in the northern Uraba region, where
death squads and leftist guerrillas are active.
Estonia bans Soviet draft
MOSCOW (AP) — The Estonian parliament
has declared service in the Soviet army illegal
and called on President Mikhail Gorbachev to
begin immediate talks on the Baltic republic's
independence, Soviet media reported yesterday.
Estonia's new law on conscription says "ser
vice by residents of Estonia in the U.S.S.R.
armed forces is legally illegitimate," and does
away with criminal penalties for draft-dodgers.
The parliamentary move, accompanied by a
strident letter to Gorbachev also approved Wed
nesday, stepped up the push for independence
in the small republic of 1.6 million residents.
Estonia has made clear it intends to follow
neighboring Lithuania in seceding from the
Soviet Union, but more cautiously.
The law on the draft raised the prospect of
new tensions. When Lithuania's legislature
passed a similar measure last month, the
Kremlin rejected its legality and ordered the
army to detain deserters anyway.
Millions found in drums
VEGA BAJA, Puerto Rico (AP) — Residents
of this coastal community unearthed
"extraordinary amounts of money" from steel
drums buried in a farmer's field that were
probably hidden by drug traffickers, the U.S.
attorney said yesterday.
But residents of this town of 30,000 resi
dents, sandwiched between a pristine beach
and tropical hills 35 miles from San Juan,
were tight-lipped about newspaper reports
they went on a spending binge after digging
up steel drums containing millions of dollars
in cash.
The U.S. attorney, Daniel Lopez Romo, said
in a telephone interview the FBI began inter
viewing residents two weeks ago after word
spread about the buying spree.
"We know one drum had $1.5 million and
there were several drums. So you can speculate
that we're talking about extraordinary
amounts of money," Lopez said in San Juan.
