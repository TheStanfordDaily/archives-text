# E. Germany names new prime minister
## Parliament OKs unification agenda 
### 
EAST BERLIN (AP) - East
Germany's Parliament chose Lot
har de Maiziere as prime minister
yesterday and embraced his
sweeping agenda for quickly uni
ting the foundering nation with
West Germany.
The nation's first freely elected
legislature also apologized to Jews
for Nazi atrocities and promised
to make reparations to Israel and
seek diplomatic ties.
By putting de Maiziere's broad
coalition government in power,
the Parliament set up a transi
tional government whose prime
goal will be to negotiate the terms
of creating a single Germany.
Before Parliament met, mem
bers of the coalition agreed that
a united Germany should remain
part of NATO and that East Ger
many should merge its currency
with West Germany's by July 1.
The coalition also backed a
rapid process for unification
However, it demanded that East
Germans retain some social
benefits, including housing and
job guarantees, as the nation
sheds four decades of socialism
for the competitive free market.
The historic decisions will be
followed by unification talks with
West Germany and the four World
War II allies that divided the
countries: the Soviet Union,

United States, Britain and
France.
The 400-member Parliament
put de Maiziere and his 24-
member Cabinet in power by a
vote of 265-108, with nine absten
tions. Eighteen lawmakers were
absent.
The government replaces the
Communist caretaker govern
ment that had been running the
country since East Germans over
threw the hard-line regime of
Erich Honecker in October.
In a remarkable string of con
ciliatory gestures, Parliament
recognized the legitimacy of
Poland's postwar borders, which
include former German lands. It
apologized for East Germany's
role in the Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968, which
crushed the Prague Spring re
forms.
The lawmakers also apologized
for the deaths of 20 million
Soviets during World War 11. They
ended four decades of denials by
East Germany's former Stalinist
leaders that the nation played no
role in the deaths of 6 million
Jews during the Holocaust.
"Persecuted Jews should be
granted asylum in the future in
East Germany," the Parliament
declaration said.
