# British seize tube possibly intended as Iraqi gun
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Customs officers
seized a huge forged steel tube ordered
by Iraq after military experts deter
mined yesterday that it could be used
to build a gun capable of hurling nu
clear or chemical warheads hundreds
of miles.
Iraq denied the accusation, and the
British manufacturer said the tube
would blow up if anyone tried to use
it as a gun barrel.
Arms experts say a gun with a barrel
the size of the tube sciaed by Customs
— 131 feet long with a 39-inch bore
— could fire artillery"9TMls as f?if
Tehran or Tel Aviv, eaah within 350
miles of Iraq's borders. Such a weapon
would be the longest gun ever made.
"There is no question it could be
used as a barrel of a large artillery
gun to fire a projectile of some con
siderable size. It is definitely subject
to export licensing controls," said
Douglas Tweddle, head of the Customs
and Excise Office.
On March 28, customs officials

seized U.S.-made parts for atomic
bomb triggers that were bound for
Iraq. Iraq has confirmed it has chemi
cal weapons but denied seeking a nu
clear capability.
Last week, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein threatened to use missiles
armed with chemical warheads against
Israel if Israel attacked his country.
The seizure of the triggers and Iraq's
execution March 15 of a British-based
reporter convicted of spying have
soured British-Iraqi relations.
"Even if we bought a box of choc
olates from Britain, they would say
Iraq will use it to produce an atom
bomb," Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz told reporters in Mosul, Iraq.
"Everything that is said about these
pipes is baseless," said Naiel Hassan,
press attache at the Iraqi Embassy in
London. "The British and the Israelis
are trying to make a fuss about this
matter. Even the company itself said
that these pipes are used for only
petrochemical industries."

The Iraqi government and the re
ported manufacturer, Sheffield
Forgemasters, had insisted the equip
ment impounded was a pipe designed
for a petrochemical plant. The com
pany said the government's Depart
ment of Trade and Industry had
reviewed and approved the project.
Phillip Wright, chief executive of
Sheffield Forgemasters, said the com
pany had been approached by Iraqis
about building gun barrels, but the
company refused after consulting the
British government.
Customs "hfHcials are convinced that
the impounded tube is covered by gov
ernment rules banning the export of
certain munitions, Tweddle said.
Britain banned all arms sales to Iraq
and its enemy Iran following the out
break of the eight-year Persian Gulf
War. There has been a cease-fire since
1988, but Iran and Iraq are still not
officially at peace and the British em
bargo remains.
"The goods are now seized. Investi

gations will continue to prove intent
and to establish whether offenses have
been committed," Tweddle said.
The equipment, impounded at the
northeastern English port of Mid
dlesbrough Tuesday night, was packed
in eight crates and was being loaded
aboard a ship chartered by the Iraqi
Maritime Organization, Customs offi
cials said.
"If they did manage to get all the
other necessary components I_
wouldn't stand within a mile of the
thing if they tried to fire it. It would
blow itself to pieces," the Sheffield ■
Star newspaper quoted Wright as say- *
ing.
Wright said Iraqi officials had ap
proached his company about making
gun barrels, but it declined.
"What we made were a series of
tubes and they are not like any sort
of a gun," he said. "We do make gun
barrels and in fact they are immedi
ately recognizable."
