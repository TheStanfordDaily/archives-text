Remember the good old
days when a scholarship ac
tually meant something? Or
when it was something to be proud
of?
The University could reminisce
forever about those days of yes
teryear. Or, it could do something
to bring them back by abolishing
the Jordan Scholars Program.
The program annually sends let
ters of commendation to more than
200 top admissions prospects in
the hopes they will then choose to
attend Stanford over Harvard, Yale
and Princeton.
But since its inception, the pro
gram has been the center of con
troversy.
Its "scholarship" carries no fi
nancial award, making the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions
guilty of Orwellian manipulation

of language.
Instead, the scholarship enables
students to have sporadic contact
with faculty at special luncheons.
Is that really expected to bring
in top students in droves?
Should Stanford prejudge the
quality of its admits, creating an
elite group of supposed super
academics?
The answers to these questions
should be intuitively obvious to
anyone who has gone through the
admissions process. All students
should begin their careers here on
an equal footing.
And since the admissions office
has to deal with a budget cut of
more than 10 percent, retaining a
program this unpopular without
any proof of its cost-effectiveness
is a grave error.
