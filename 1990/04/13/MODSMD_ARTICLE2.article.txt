# Forum addresses reporting of sexual assault
## 
### Jeannie Heltzel 
Seeking input from students on how to
demystify issues surrounding sexual assault,
the University Sexual Assault Task Force held
an open forum last night in Donner lounge.
Task force co-chairs Patricia Fabiano, di
rector of Cowell Student Health Center's
health promotion program, and junior
Suzanne O'Brien led a panel discussion that
included Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington, Assoc. Dean of Residential Education
Alice Supton and fraternal affairs adviser Mi
chael Hughes.
Numerous student representatives from
campus organizations such as the Bridge, the
Rape Education Project and the Women's Cen

ter were present in the audience. About 30
people attended the forum.
According to Fabiano, the biggest problems
the task force faces are defining the term
"sexual assault" and helping to clarify insti
tutional responses to it.
Task force members seek to "expand the
definition of assault and the range of
traumatizing behaviors it includes" to encom
pass not only rape, but also childhood incest,
flashing incidents, obscene phone calls and
sexual harassment, according to Fabiano.
Similarly, the task force intends to "expand
the meaning of the word 'reporting' " beyond
merely calling the police, she said. Telling
anyone about the incident, Fabiano empha
sized, initiates the healing process.

Creating a more clearly defined protocol for
people who have survived sexual assault to
report an incident is one of the chief goals of
the task fcrce, according to O'Brien.
Senior Suzanna Mak, a task force member,
explained that the task force is consulting
with existing resources both on- and off
campus to "avoid the problem of duplicating
resources."
With the recent proliferation of rape aware
ness education, it has become difficult to de
termine which students have been reached by
such programs, and what information they
have been given, a member of the audience
said.
Mak cited the three "entry
points" defined by the task force
in a report released in January
for people wishing to report an
incident of sexual assault: the
police, the Rape Crisis Center and
the Rape Response Group.
Herrington explained that all
three entry points "know each
other" and are working together,
so that "it doesn't matter which
a survivor uses — they will get
the same response."
The task force also sought ideas
for promoting awareness of issues
surrounding sexual assault.
Possibilities mentioned by au
dience members included reaching
more students through dorm
centered education led by resident
assistants, especially during fresh
man orientation, and coordinating
efforts of campus groups involved
in educating students about
sexual assault.
