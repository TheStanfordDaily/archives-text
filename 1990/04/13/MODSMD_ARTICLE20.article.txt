# Shifting gears

Students must realize
that in an age of budget con
straints, sacrifices have to
start somewhere. And one spring
board will probably be student
parking.
A recent University report has
recommended cutbacks in campus
parking spaces and development of
reasonable low-cost alternatives.
Suggesting that Stanford's policy
has been to provide numerous,
affordable spots, the report states
that the University could only con
tinue to do so at a price tag of $40
million.
The report proposes that the
University decrease demand by 10
percent over the next 10 years to
avoid spiraling costs. It also con
tains preliminary plans to improve
Marguerite shuttle services, to pro
vide carpools and to shuttle drivers
from off-campus lots.
Considering the financial and

environmental problems that
would result from providing
enough additional spaces on
campus for everyone to park
leisurely, convenience shouldn't
take precedence over common
sense.
Parking at Stanford is more at
tainable than at many other uni
versities, some of which charge
exorbitant rates or prevent fresh
men from even having cars on
campus.
Thankfully, the Stanford
parking committee rejected such
extreme measures, promising in
stead to seek new methods of
decreasing usage. Hopefully, the
committee will remain committed
to that task.
Perpetual access to convenient
parking is a scarce luxury in the
real world, and there is absolutely
no reason to increase the deficit
in order to provide it here.
