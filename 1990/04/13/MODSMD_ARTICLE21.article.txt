Residence staffs perform many services for students

IN HIS RECENT address to the
Stanford community, University
President Donald Kennedy called
for a renewed commitment to under
graduate education "in all its forms."
In the course of his address, he
delineated several ideals concerning
undergraduate education; and while he
praised (in a very brief passage) the
successes of the Office of Residential
Education, he also suggested that this
system was not fulfilling the hopes
that he and others held for it. (Details
were not given.)
Shortly before, Provost James Rosse,
in addressing the impending severe
budget cuts, suggested that some
student services offered by Res Ed
were too expensive to maintain.
These incidents suggested to us that
senior members of the Stanford com
munity are not well-acquainted with
what the resident fellows and resident
assistants actually accomplish in their
dorms. Let us list some of the activi
ties fostered in winter quarter by the
residence staff in our own dorm — a
dorm which we believe is successful

but which is certainly not among the
most exemplary in its achievement:
• Six freshman advisers visited the
dorm twice for formal dinners with
their advisees; most visited the dorm
more informally on many other occa
sions (often for weekly meals) during
the winter quarter,
• About eight to 10 other faculty
visited the dorm for meals, invited by
house staff members or by small
groups of students taking their courses,
• Five other faculty members gave
formal presentations on their academic
interests, and one expert from outside
Stanford gave a talk,
• Several programs were held on
issues of racism (most were clustered
around the week of Martin Luther
King Jr.'s birthday),
• There were programs on sexism
and on issues of concern to the gay
and lesbian communities,
• Several senior students in the
dorm, who are doing honors theses,
gave talks and led discussions on their
work,
• There were organized discussions

on topics of contemporary interest,
such as abortion and pro-choice legisla
tion,
• Many students made use — very
heavy at times — of the computer
laboratory in the dorm and were aided
by the student resident computer
coordinator. In addition, the coordina
tor provided workshops on topics of
special interest to residents,
• Residence staff members gave
individual counseling to a significant
number of students facing personal or
academic crises or facing medical prob
lems and psychological stress. (We do
not keep a log on this type of activity,
but it is frequent),
• Discussions were held with several
parents who called with special con
cerns, and
• There were the usual social, public
service and community-building activi
ties.
It is sad to think that the Stanford
administration, facing a call to renew
interest in undergraduate education "in
all its forms" is willing to endorse a 25
percent cutback in these "expensive"

activities.
We would have thought it would be
too costly — in a variety of ways,
including damage to Stanford's
credibility — to enact such severe cuts
(which are, readers will recall, about
the largest faced by any group on
campus, and which are far above the
average required to bring the Univer
sity budget under control).
What price is the administration
willing to pay for students' contact
with faculty, for academic and psycho
logical counseling, for an increase in
sensitivity to racism and sexism, for
access to computers for students from
all socio-economic backgrounds, for
friendly relations with advisers?
Or do we have to wait, as President
Kennedy was perhaps intimating, for
the year 2010 before we restore these
"expensive services"?
Stanford's reputation as a leading
institution of undergraduate education
will have "gone down the tubes" long
before then.
