# Overseas Studies programs are vital to undergraduates
## 
### 
A member of the Board of Trustees
told students this week that we should
get involved in the decision-making
process of the upcoming budget reduc
tions. Therefore, we want to voice our
support for the continued funding of a
program that adds to the uniqueness
and vitality of Stanford education.
Considering that the Stanford Pro
gram in Tours, France, was our most
rewarding academic experience thus far

at Stanford, we would like to express
our deepest concern over the proposed
budget cuts that threaten to force
Overseas Studies to shut down one or
more of its programs.
We would like to stress the quality
of the academics at Tours. The fact
that the language requirement for at
tending Tours is only two quarters
should not be perceived as a sign of
academic laxity.
To the contrary, this requirement
enables a wider range of students with
diverse academic backgrounds to profit
from an overseas center. Tours caters
to this academic diversity by offering
classes in a wide range of disciplines.
The program's commitment to lan-

guage is evident in its daily, two-hour,
intensive French classes, and by the
fact that the majority of its lectures
are in French. The classes at Tours
provide the opportunity to study with
the finest French professors of the
region in small, seminar-like settings.
This arrangement offers a high level
of contact with professors, encouraging
students to express their different per
spectives. Moreover, organized class
excursions revolutionize the classroom
by extending the learning from the
program center to the historic sites
studied.
In short, Tours exemplifies the edu
cational environment that Stanford is
working to attain.
University President Donald Ken-

nedy's vision of Stanford in the next
century emphasized undergraduate
education and teaching. Let him show
his commitment to this philosophy by
continuing to fund the programs that
do offer the undergraduate community
an innovative educational opportunity.
If the students truly are allowed to get
involved in the decisions regarding the
budget cuts, we feel certain that the
Tours program will be saved.
