## Encountering an artiste 
### 
IT'S ALL MY fault, really. And even
if it wasn't, I accept complete respon
sibility for it. Clothes make the man,
you know.
I was in my room, and the wind was
whipping against the window and making
the eaves groan. Noticing the day's blus
tery aspect, I grabbed a turtleneck out
of my closet and put it on. I slung my
backpack over my shoulder and began
walking toward the Quad.
I slowed when I realized that my back
pack was open and then stopped at the
opening between the English and Modern
Thought and Literature Departments. 1
set my pack down on the ground, zipped
it closed and looked around to see if
maybe the professor I'd come to meet
was anywhere near. He wasn't.
But before I could resume movement
toward the department door, 1 was ad
dressed by a sullen bystander I didn't
recognize. He was dressed all in black
and had a leather satchel slung over one
shoulder.
"Cigarette?" he said, offering me an
unfiltered Camel.
It struck me funny, that he'd offer me
a cigarette. "By god, it is a cigarette," I
said, attempting a joke — in vain, though,
because he didn't laugh.
"Smoke," he explained a little slower,
as if I hadn't really understood what was
going on.
"No, thanks," I said. "I don't smoke."
And suddenly the reason for the over
ture of tobacco made complete sense. It
was my turtleneck: black; my jeans: black;
my backpack: black.
I had, albeit completely unwittingly,

joined, though only temporarily, the
legitimate art community. I was clad en
tirely in black and milling in a physical
void between Modern Thought and Eng
lish — of course he offered me a cigarette.
I had given him the impression that
we were brothers in art — that we had
a kinship forged in the unspoken recesses
of the collective unconscious — that we
were deep — it had to be true — we
were wearing black.
And it struck me that whereas I was
a pretender, he was genuinely deep. I was
obviously in the presence of a genuine
intellectual — perhaps an artiste.
Consider our conversation: He used
three words — I used ten. Thus his words
were weightier, more vital, more substan
tial than mine.
Even an English major can see that
during this brief, chance exchange that
each of his words was equivalent to more
than three of mine. I shudder to think
how I might have fared had we spoken
at length.
If you'll permit me, I'd like to digress
en route to the point. My old philosophy
professor, Dan Conway, once spoke about
the power of the word "really." Say you're
at a cocktail party a few days from now
and people are talking about George
Bush. You're standing there and you say,
"Who is George Bush?" You look like a
complete idiot, right?
But if you then strike a pensive pose
and follow up with, "I mean, who is
George Bush really?" you bring a
philosophical dimension to your question
and suddenly you go "from ignoramus to
mystic genius."

Now just as the word "really" has the
power to make you a philosopher of sorts,
wearing black clothing has the ability to
transform you into someone deep and
artsy. Turtlenecks, tapered jeans and
pointy shoes are particularly good for
telling the world you take your angst
seriously and that your pathos is
heartfelt.
Black clothing is of course the most
essential part of being an abstruse entity
— but don't forget to accesorize! It can't
hurt to pick up some books by Camus,
develop a taste for espresso and stop
eating meat and most other solid foods.
Can true character be gained through
clothing? Sure. Depth is only skin deep.
And, as Billy Crystal (as Fernando
Lamas) said, "It is better to look good
than to feel good." Extrapolating from
that, "It is better to look deep than to
be deep."
It's like a Barbizon course: Be a com
plex individual or just look like one! The
choice is yours.
As I turned to leave the man in black
I said, "Thanks for the offer. See you
around."
He dismissed me with a quick toss of
his head. "Later," he said.
I'm still pondering the significance of
that.
