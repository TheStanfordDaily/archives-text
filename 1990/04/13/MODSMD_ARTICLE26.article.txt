Students First
party emphasizes
process and progress
In response to Peter Ross's letter,
the Students First political party would
like to clarify its membership, purpose
and vision for Stanford University.
The Students First political party is
politically, ethnically and socially di
verse. We are comprised of many races,
religions, colors and creeds.
Our party includes liberals and
moderates, as well as conservatives,
and we are involved in every aspect of
student life.
Students First members are active in
public service organizations, the per
forming arts, ethnic communities and
student government. What strengthens
and unites our diverse party is a com
mitment to process: a method of how
to get things done efficiently and effec
tively by ensuring that all voices are
heard, respected and included.
By establishing this process, Students
First makes progress on the issues
which affect Stanford students, includ

ing residential computing, graduate
student life, multiculturalism and em
phasizing education over research. Of
primary importance is the open, honest
exchange of different opinions and
ideas.
To this, Students First is committed.
Ross's letter asks Students First to
state its position. Students First envi
sions a budget-efficient, less bureau
cratic ASSU that actively involves and
empowers students in the University's
decision-making process. We seek
meaningful solutions to the problems
of accountability, budget cuts, fee
refunds and improvement of student
services.
In the ASSU and elsewhere, this
means involving students and ensuring
the quality of academic and student
programs in a time of massive budget
cuts. Students First believes students
should come first when University
decisions are made.
The quality of student life may be
drastically altered in the coming year.
Our party seeks solutions to the
budget problem by listening to and
acting upon students' needs.
This week, both parties will artic
ulate their solutions to the problems
facing the Stanford community. As

students challenge and compare the
two parties, all should consider the
benefits of a Students First student
government where process and progress
come first.

COP slates have
been understanding
despite mistake
Many people may have noticed that
this spring's ASSU Elections Handbook
contains a fairly serious discrepancy in
that the name of the COP slate "A
Clean Slate" is printed so as to indi
cate that slate's affiliation with the
Students First party, while the name
of the "Four Our Future" slate does
not indicate that slate's affiliation with
the People's Platform.
This discrepancy is the result of an
oversight on the part of the ASSU
Elections Commission — neither COP
slate was responsible for the mistake.
Although it has not been explicitly

stated in the guidelines we have pro
vided candidates, it is generally not our
policy on the Elections Commission to
indicate candidates' political affiliations
beside their names in the handbook.
Despite the recent tension between
Students First and the People's Plat
form, members of both parties have
been cooperative and have worked to
ensure that this error does not become
an issue as the campaign week pro
gresses.
Members of Students First and "A
Clean Slate" have dealt with the situa
tion compassionately. The People's
Platform and "Four Our Future" have
been especially understanding, since
this error potentially could have left
their campaign at a disadvantage.
While a simple typing error may
seen trival to most people, we on the
Elections Commission understand the
ease with which such honest mistakes
can be blown out of proportion when
tensions run high. We would like to
commend and thank the members of
both involved parties for their efforts
to maintain a campaign of issues and
integrity.

Director resigned
because of health,
long-term plans
I was very sorry to read in the April
10 lead article of The Daily the inac
curate report of my recent resignation
as Human Resources Services director.
My decision to leave was a very impor
tant one to me, and I'd like to be sure
those who know me have an accurate
understanding of it.
I chose to resign from the director's
role because of health problems which
caused me to make significant changes
in my work life and because of my
long-term plans for a major career
change, which I had been anticipating
for several months.
I am grateful to Su Schaffer and
other University management who
have been supportive and understand
ing of my decision, which placed con
siderable burden on them.
