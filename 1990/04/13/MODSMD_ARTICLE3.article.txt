While some campaigning
senators took a breather, environ
mental and budget cut concerns
filled the air at last night's short,
sparsely attended ASSU Senate
meeting.
Four bills with environmental
themes were introduced, and all
were passed by the senate. The
first bill urges the University
community "to actively take part
in the events of Earth Day 1990."
The second, third and fourth bills,
respectively, urge ASSU-funded
organizations, academic depart
ments and University Food
Service to adopt "environmentally
sensitive" practices.
While the senate did not specify
the nature of the practices, it did
ask a committee to formulate
guidelines to present to the three

groups.
The first, third and fourth bills
passed on undivided voice votes.
The second bill passed on a
divided voice vote.
Graduate senator Douglas
Bone, who questioned the nature
of the guidelines, voted against
the second bill.
Freshman Erika Zavaleta, a
member of the Students for En
vironmental Action at Stanford/
Stanford Earth Day Coalition,
which sponsored the four environ
mental bills, said their purpose is
"to get student involvement" in
events surrounding Earth Day be
cause "this is a time to make pos

Stanford, she added, "is a place
that tends to be at the forefront
of movements like this."
The senate considered three
bills regarding proposed budget
cuts, and all passed. The first

Affairs and criticizes the 15 per
cent cut in its budget.
Yesterday, the University
reduced the proposed budget cut
for this department from 20 to
15 percent.
The bill also called for the Uni
versity to reduce the budget cuts
in Residential Education.
The second budget bill asked
that polls be conducted of the stu

dent body to determine "which
services will receive more priority
in funding." It proposed taking a
survey of student body sentiment
through straw polls and dorm
polls.
The third budget bill requested
the "Program Committee for
Overseas Studies consider other
alternatives for budget cutting"
besides the elimination of the
Tours program.
Students have speculated that
the Tours study center will be lost
to budget cuts, but Overseas
Studies officials would not pro
vide confirmation yesterday.
Graduate senator Jayanta Bhat
tacharya, who authored the bill,
said the University is planning to
cut the Tours program to free up
funds to open new overseas cam
puses and to create budget
