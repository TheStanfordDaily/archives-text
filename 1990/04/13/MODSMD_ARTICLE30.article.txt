# DUs given warning
## Possible expulsion if behavior continues

The freshmen held a long meet
ing to arrange for their traditional
sophomore canes. The canes had
"Stanford 1903" and the owner's
initials engraved on a silver plate
and cost about $1.75. Members of
the freshman class carried their
canes for the first time during
Senior Week after the cane pre
sentation ceremony was per
formed.
How exciting. It's almost as
thrilling as owning your own
genuine Stanford keychain with
your class written on it. Do you
think that in the 1900s students
carried their canes everywhere in
stead of wearing Stanford sweat
shirts every day ?

A survey completed by Dr. Celia
Duel Mosher, medical adviser of
women, cited better living condi
tions and a growing interest in
the subject of health as the
reasons behind the 1.1 inch height
increase of Stanford women since
1901.
Perhaps women got taller be
cause of the greenhouse effect or
looser clothes. Or maybe it was
because they were allowed to live
in larger rooms than those of Wil
bur. I bet that living in Wilbur or
Stern actually does make you
shorter. I bet the Bug can tell us
how tall the average Stanford
woman living on the east side of
campus is and whether she is
shorter than other Stanford wom
en. Ask him.

of neighbors, harassing passers-by
verbally, throwing beer bottles off
the roof, trashing bicycles and
generally aggressive and hostile
behavior to a couple other houses,
mainly Columbae and Sigma
Chi."
According to president Luke
Cole, the DUs "have had some
behavior problems in the past,"
but "feel that we have cleared
things up, and we're looking to a
trouble-free future."
"We've instituted internal dis
ciplinary measures which we hope
will mitigate any future prob
lems," he explained.
Yeah, sure they did. Whatever
happened to Stanford's self
regulatory community? Maybe it
went out the window with the bur
ning couch. Off the point, I think
their old green house is the neatest
on the row. At least it's still stand
ing.
