# The 						Bug welcomes spring and all of its signs
## 
### Bryan Cooperrider Staff writer 
Ah, it's springtime again. I al
ways notice that about this time
of year. And with spring comes
many of the Stanford traditions
we all look forward to — Greek
Rush, ASSU elections, the return
of killer caterpillars, etc. And now
we have the debut of The Daily's
personal ads. Have you noticed
the colorful flyers encouraging
students to make fools of them
selves for the entire Stanford
community? The orange one is
my favorite: "Erica, South Stacks
10 p.m. Thursday — Pooh Bear."
How many people would go to the
South Stacks just to see who the
hell "Pooh Bear" is? I don't know
— I just work here. In any case,
it's rather unwise of me to make
fun of my employer.
Speaking of ASSU elections,
I've been rather curious as to how
much effort is expended formu
lating names. "Four Our Future"
is by far the catchiest — and tack
iest — name I've yet encountered.

With spring comes many Stanford
traditions we all look forward to —
Greek Rush, ASSU elections and the
return of killer caterpillars.

There are only three little Pills
bury Doughboy figures on the
sign, so next time you ride by the
post office, stop and see if you
can figure out which of the four
candidates is missing.
I've decided, to keep with the
new trend at The Daily, to change
the name of this column to "Dear
Blabby." Don't take out a personal
ad, send it to the Bug. (I have
permission from the editor to
print anything.) Send your ques
tions and problems to me: Drop
them off at The Daily in the box
outside the front office; send your
questions to Bug Me, Stanford
Daily, Storke Bldg., Stanford, CA

94305; or graffiti your questions
over the top of one of the cam
paign billboards in White Plaza.
Dear Bug,
I've heard that President Ken
nedy is an avid bird-watcher, and
I couldn't help but notice that his
wife's name is Robin. Is there any
connection there?
— A fowl-mouthed administra
tive employee
I happened to run into my good
friend Don, mainly because I've
been chasing him around for
weeks, so I asked him that very
question. Of course, I didn't want
to ruffle his feathers, but our

beloved president is a good na
tured kind-of-guy, so I just put it
on the line and asked him ver
batim. He admitted that he was
an avid bird-watcher but denied
that it had any connection to his
wife's name. "I was watching birds
long before I met that one," Ken
nedy told me.
Dear Bug,
Is it my imagination, or is going
to class in a suit becoming the
new fad? Let me guess, it's inter
viewing season. How many inter
views are conducted on campus
per day?
— Trying not to follow suit
Just to get in the mood for this
one I sat out in White Plaza and
counted how many suits walked
by. I'd tell you how many there
were except I wrote it on the back
of my homework, and I turned
that in already.
Apparently the only difference
between hunting season and
recruiting season is the time of
the year — recruiters have open

season all year long to entice un
witting students into a life of high
paying doldrums. I've had a few
interviews myself this quarter.
Let me share with you my expe
riences job-hunting.
My first interview was with
Schlumberger. They were going
to offer me in excess of 50 grand
to sit on an oil rig in the middle
of Saudia Arabia for two years. I
sat down and figured out the pros
and cons of this job.
Pro: The money.
Con: Saudia Arabia is hot.
Pro: The money.
Con: Alcohol is illegal in Saudia
Arabia.
Pro: The money.
Con: I'd be about 100 miles
from the nearest town.
Pro: The money.
Con: I'd spend my two years
with 15 smelly men.
Pro: The money.
Con: I'd work seven days a week
with no vacation for the first year
and a half.
Pro: The money.
Con: I don't speak Arabic.

After weighing the pros and
cons I decided San Quentin was
more appealing.
I learned two things from the
CPPC: 1) There are 13 to 14 in
terviews per day on campus, and
2) Dominos delivers on campus
but doesn't interview on campus.
So not only did I get rejected, I
had to go off-campus to do it.
Dominos said I just didn't have
the right look to be a delivery boy
and drive one of those nifty cars.
