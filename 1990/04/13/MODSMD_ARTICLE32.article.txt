## Killer or Mr. Nice Guy? Stanford's spectacular spiker Hanan is self-confessed 'computer geek,' regular guy 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
Just think of Cardinal volleyball
superstar Dan Hanan as your fa
vorite son. Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm is fairly confident that's
what you'd want to do if you ever
got to know him.
"Dan is the kind of guy I would
like to have as a son," Sturm said.
"He's a responsible, considerate,
and really classy individual. He
has found the balance between
being gracious and being compet
itive and that makes makes him
that much more special as a
human being."
He ain't a bad ball player either.
The 6-foot-5 national team
member, who last year was voted
runner-up to NCAA Player of
Year and was the only unanimous
All-Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association selection, is cur
rently six kills shy of breaking
Olympic captain Scott Fortune's
career kills' record at Stanford.
Hanan is, without question,
among the very elite volleyball
athletes in the country.
Hanan will likely shatter the
prestigious mark tonight as he
leads the streaking No. 5 Cardinal
into a must-win fray with the
mighty No. 1-ranked Trojans of
Southern Cal.
The senior computer science
imyor faces the bleak prospect of
competing in his last collegiate
match of his career Saturday
should the Cardinal be denied a
postseason berth. But whether his
last competition comes tomorrow
or whether it comes in Virginia
at the Final Four in May, Hanan
will not escape the volleyball
world unnoticed.
"Dan is a tremendous player,"
said USC coach Jim McLaughlin
who coached him over the sum
mer with the U.S. national team.
"He's a controlled player who does
a lot of things well. He never hits
any peaks and valleys because he's
very smart tactically. He's just a
good guy."
An All-WIVA conference selec
tion in each of his years at Stan
ford and All-American twice,
Hanan is widely considered the
premier hitting middle blocker in
the country. In his career, Hanan

who has already set school records
in hitting percentage (.416) and
blocks (131).
This year Hanan is the squad's
leading attacker (305 kills),
second-leading percentage hitter
(.375) , third-leading server with
13 aces, second-leading digger at
98, and top blocker with 93.
It's no wonder people are taking
careful note.
"I'm amazed at times by the
things he does," said freshman
setter Jimmy Blackman, who ad
mitted to being quite nervous at
first about setting the superstar.
"He's such a great example of
hard work and leadership."
"Dan is the standard on the
court," Sturm said. "He's focused,
aggressive, competitive. He's a
great model and he's really deter
mined."
"Other people would be lucky
to have his off-days," continued
middle-blocking counterpart
Adam Keefe, who can say a little
bit about having a lot of good
nights himself.
And what does Hanan think
about himself?
"I'm a huge computer geek."
In fact, the last thing you'll find
this Cardinal athlete ever doing
is gloating over remarks like
these. For a student who signs
autographs in a sport that draws
about 800 people a match and for
one who in all likelihood will rep
resent the U.S. at the 1992 Olym

pics, Hanan is remarkably
mellow.
"I like the recognition," Hanan
said, "because when you highlight
the top players, you recognize vol
leyball as a sport with some top
notch athletes."
Instead of reading his press clip
pings, Hanan prefers to hang out
with his Mirrielees pals, trying to
be "social and friendly," hacking
away at his Mac working on pro
grams, and engaging company
with his talkative charm.
"Gnarly" and "weird" decorate
his vocabulary with pleasant fre
quency while magnanimity and
excellence decorate his game.
"One of the most surprising
things about him is that he
doesn't think he's better than
anybody," Jimmy Blackman said.
Which is something that almost
everyone says he is. At his second
Olympic Festival, Hanan fondly
recalls being selected captain by
his team, many members of which
he had known for only a day."I
was pretty happy with that,"
Hanan said. "It was cool that they
respected me."
Last year, Hanan was likewise
honored as the Athlete of the Year
of Stanford's junior class, an
honor he relishes with unique
fondness considering the wealth
of world-class athletes on the
Farm.
Hanan's personal favorite was
being picked to the All-WIVA

team last season. Hanan was
stunned not so much by his in
clusion on the squad as by the
manner of his selection. As the
only unanimous choice, the soci
able senior was nominated by the
voting squads comprised of
players and coaches from every
WIVA conference team. He was
uniquely selected in this fashion
in a class of such standouts as
Olympic Captain Scott Fortune,
NCAA Player of the Year Trevor
Schirman, and national team
member AJlen Allen.
While deeply gratified by all
such accolades, Hanan neverthe
less sticks efficiently to the task
at hand. A quiet leader on the
court, Hanan speaks only when
necessary and refrains from emo
tional tirades that potentially dis
rupt the match.
"He's not a rah-rah cheer
leader-type individual," Sturm
said. "His silence is effective be
cause it's him. He's an inspiration
to his teammates."
Fans are hoping that Hanan's
presence will inspire his team
mates to levels equal to those of
last year's squad, when Hanan
and Fortune charged the Cardinal
into the national championship
match. "That's my ultimate goal,"
Hanan admits.
That, and finishing his next
computer program.
Card notes
Tonight's match is undoubtedly the
most significant of the season. The
Cardinal must win both tonight and
tomorrow against San Diego State to
assure themselves of a playoff berth.
The task however could not possibly
come against a more challenging op
ponent. The Trojans are No. 1 in the
country, have lost only twice this
season in 22 matches, and remain the
only team in the nation that has swept
the Cardinal in three straight games
this year, preseason included. USC
has accomplished the feat twice.
The match nevertheless provides
some favorable conditions for Stan
ford. Basketball standout Adam Keefe
will make his home debut for 1990
and will likely see some action. Keefe
was utilized last weekend at the Diet
Pepsi Colleigate Classic to add height
to the Cardinal attack. This week in

scrimmage he improved his timing
and effectively hit over the block.
The Cardinal will also play within
its own confines before its home
crowd and the Stanford band, which
will attend the contest. Stanford is
still undefeated at home this year.
The team should be well motivated,
as ESPN has announced it will cover
the match and with the specter of

failing to qualify for the playoffs
looming over their heads.
"I think this match will be played
differently than the others," USC
Coach Jim McLaughlin said. "We both
did some different things at the Col
legiate Classic. I think Stanford will
play great but it's a real important
match for us too. We haven't solidified
anything yet."

He ain't a bad ball player either.
The 6-foot-5 national team
member, who last year was voted
runner-up to NCAA Player of
Year and was the only unanimous
All-Western Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association selection, is cur
rently six kills shy of breaking
Olympic captain Scott Fortune's
career kills' record at Stanford.
Hanan is, without question,
among the very elite volleyball
athletes in the country.
Hanan will likely shatter the
prestigious mark tonight as he
leads the streaking No. 5 Cardinal
into a must-win fray with the
mighty No. 1-ranked Trojans of
Southern Cal.
The senior computer science
imyor faces the bleak prospect of
competing in his last collegiate
match of his career Saturday
should the Cardinal be denied a
postseason berth. But whether his
last competition comes tomorrow
or whether it comes in Virginia
at the Final Four in May, Hanan
will not escape the volleyball
world unnoticed.
"Dan is a tremendous player,"
said USC coach Jim McLaughlin
who coached him over the sum
mer with the U.S. national team.
"He's a controlled player who does
a lot of things well. He never hits
any peaks and valleys because he's
very smart tactically. He's just a
good guy."
An All-WIVA conference selec
tion in each of his years at Stan
ford and All-American twice,
Hanan is widely considered the
premier hitting middle blocker in
the country. In his career, Hanan

who has already set school records
in hitting percentage (.416) and
blocks (131).
This year Hanan is the squad's
leading attacker (305 kills),
second-leading percentage hitter
(.375) , third-leading server with
13 aces, second-leading digger at
98, and top blocker with 93.
It's no wonder people are taking
careful note.
"I'm amazed at times by the
things he does," said freshman
setter Jimmy Blackman, who ad
mitted to being quite nervous at
first about setting the superstar.
"He's such a great example of
hard work and leadership."
"Dan is the standard on the
court," Sturm said. "He's focused,
aggressive, competitive. He's a
great model and he's really deter
mined."
"Other people would be lucky
to have his off-days," continued
middle-blocking counterpart
Adam Keefe, who can say a little
bit about having a lot of good
nights himself.
And what does Hanan think
about himself?
"I'm a huge computer geek."
In fact, the last thing you'll find
this Cardinal athlete ever doing
is gloating over remarks like
these. For a student who signs
autographs in a sport that draws
about 800 people a match and for
one who in all likelihood will rep
resent the U.S. at the 1992 Olym

pics, Hanan is remarkably
mellow.
"I like the recognition," Hanan
said, "because when you highlight
the top players, you recognize vol
leyball as a sport with some top
notch athletes."
Instead of reading his press clip
pings, Hanan prefers to hang out
with his Mirrielees pals, trying to
be "social and friendly," hacking
away at his Mac working on pro
grams, and engaging company
with his talkative charm.
"Gnarly" and "weird" decorate
his vocabulary with pleasant fre
quency while magnanimity and
excellence decorate his game.
"One of the most surprising
things about him is that he
doesn't think he's better than
anybody," Jimmy Blackman said.
Which is something that almost
everyone says he is. At his second
Olympic Festival, Hanan fondly
recalls being selected captain by
his team, many members of which
he had known for only a day."I
was pretty happy with that,"
Hanan said. "It was cool that they
respected me."
Last year, Hanan was likewise
honored as the Athlete of the Year
of Stanford's junior class, an
honor he relishes with unique
fondness considering the wealth
of world-class athletes on the
Farm.
Hanan's personal favorite was
being picked to the All-WIVA

team last season. Hanan was
stunned not so much by his in
clusion on the squad as by the
manner of his selection. As the
only unanimous choice, the soci
able senior was nominated by the
voting squads comprised of
players and coaches from every
WIVA conference team. He was
uniquely selected in this fashion
in a class of such standouts as
Olympic Captain Scott Fortune,
NCAA Player of the Year Trevor
Schirman, and national team
member AJlen Allen.
While deeply gratified by all
such accolades, Hanan neverthe
less sticks efficiently to the task
at hand. A quiet leader on the
court, Hanan speaks only when
necessary and refrains from emo
tional tirades that potentially dis
rupt the match.
"He's not a rah-rah cheer
leader-type individual," Sturm
said. "His silence is effective be
cause it's him. He's an inspiration
to his teammates."
Fans are hoping that Hanan's
presence will inspire his team
mates to levels equal to those of
last year's squad, when Hanan
and Fortune charged the Cardinal
into the national championship
match. "That's my ultimate goal,"
Hanan admits.
That, and finishing his next
computer program.
Card notes
Tonight's match is undoubtedly the
most significant of the season. The
Cardinal must win both tonight and
tomorrow against San Diego State to
assure themselves of a playoff berth.
The task however could not possibly
come against a more challenging op
ponent. The Trojans are No. 1 in the
country, have lost only twice this
season in 22 matches, and remain the
only team in the nation that has swept
the Cardinal in three straight games
this year, preseason included. USC
has accomplished the feat twice.
The match nevertheless provides
some favorable conditions for Stan
ford. Basketball standout Adam Keefe
will make his home debut for 1990
and will likely see some action. Keefe
was utilized last weekend at the Diet
Pepsi Colleigate Classic to add height
to the Cardinal attack. This week in

scrimmage he improved his timing
and effectively hit over the block.
The Cardinal will also play within
its own confines before its home
crowd and the Stanford band, which
will attend the contest. Stanford is
still undefeated at home this year.
The team should be well motivated,
as ESPN has announced it will cover
the match and with the specter of

failing to qualify for the playoffs
looming over their heads.
"I think this match will be played
differently than the others," USC
Coach Jim McLaughlin said. "We both
did some different things at the Col
legiate Classic. I think Stanford will
play great but it's a real important
match for us too. We haven't solidified
anything yet."

Senior middle blocker Dan Hanan may be ferocious competitor on
the court, but he's a lamb off of it. Hanan currently stands only
six kills shy of Olympian Scott Fortune's Stanford career record
going into tonight's match with No. 1 USC.
Just think of Cardinal volleyball
superstar Dan Hanan as your fa
vorite son. Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm is fairly confident that's
what you'd want to do if you ever
got to know him.
"Dan is the kind of guy I would
like to have as a son," Sturm said.
"He's a responsible, considerate,
and really classy individual. He
has found the balance between
being gracious and being compet
itive and that makes makes him
that much more special as a
human being."
