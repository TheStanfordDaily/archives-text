# Track hosts Stanford Classic

### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
For the Stanford track and
field teams, Act One of 1990 is
over.
The Cardinal will run into to
morrow's Stanford Track Clas
sic with early-season momen
tum, which they hope to trans
late into even more kinetic en
ergy in their race for the Pacific
10 Conference meet and beyond.
Both men's and women's
teams have been successful in
the early stages of the season.
They are 3-0 in dual meet com
petition, they have qualified 15
athletes for Pac-lOs (two for
NCAAs), and they have recorded
two No. 2 times nationally and
one top-ranked time. Coach
Brooks Johnson has called this
year's group the deepest team
to pound the oval at Stanford
Stadium in his 11 years on the
Farm.
The curtain is about to rise
on Act Two.
"This starts our champion
ship time of the year," said Asst.
Coach Scott Chisam. "We've
finished the relay team prepar

atory stuff."
In other words, Stanford has
had time to get in shape and see
where it stands in relation to the
competition — and what it still
has to do as a result. Now it is
time to rev up and make a run
for the Pac-lOs and NCAAs.
Tomorrow's meet will be a kind
of "Battle of Five Armies," featur
ing Idaho, Notre Dame, Nevada-
Reno, and Long Beach City
College in addition to the Cardi
nal.
The Fighting Irish, who are
only sending 15 athletes, will chal
lenge Stanford primarily in the
distance events. Long Beach City
College sports a strong sprinting
and hurdling squad. Reno also
boasts some impressive individ
uals, particularly in the field
events.
According to Chisam, Stan
ford's goals for tomorrow's meet,
and for the next couple of weeks,
will be to qualify as many people
as possible for Pac-lOs. "We hope
to double (the 15 already quali
fied) within two weeks," he said.
Although two Cardinal athletes
have already qualified for the
NCAA meet — namely, Chryste
Gaines in the 100-meter dash and
Peggy Odita in the heptathlon —
Chisam said that he is not too
concerned about nationals yet.
"You like to drink some milk
before you go to the beer,"he
remarked, meaning that Pac-lOs
is the first order of business.
However, he did mention that
some athletes will be shooting for
NCAA-qualifying marks. The

'Our conference meet
is not too far from
national-caliber. If
they had competed as
a country, the Pac-10
would have been
third (in number of
medals garnered) in
the Olympics in '88.'

members of the top-ranked men's
distance medley team and the No.
2 4 x 1500-meter team are among
those.
In fact, their splits in those
events were good enough to
qualify, but since splits obviously
do not count as individual times,
they must at least reproduce their
performances in their respective
events. This should not pose a
problem for the Cardinal runners.
Chisam pointed out that, in any
case, "Our conference meet is not
too far from national-caliber. If
they had competed as a country,
the Pac-10 would have been third
(in number of medals garnered)
in the Olympics in '88."
The Cardinal will have two
invitational-style meets on its own
oval in in the next two weeks.
The team's primary purpose in
these meets will be two-fold. First,
as mentioned, as many athletes
as possible are to qualify for the
post season meets. Secondly, the
team is to prepare itself for Big
Meet against California on April
28.
That's Act Three.
