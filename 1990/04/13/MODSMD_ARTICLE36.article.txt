# Card trounces hapless Bears
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Sometimes you're hot even
when you're not.
Stanford pitcher Stan Spencer,
who has sizzled throughout the
season by methodically shutting
down each and every team he's
faced, finally cooled off a little
yesterday against the California
Bears in the 80-degree heat at
Sunken Diamond.
Spencer, who had walked a
grand total of one batter in his
previous 45 innings, gave an
astronomical three free passes to
the Bears yesterday. A Cal batter
reached base in every inning but
one. Heck, Stanford Pitching
Coach Tom Dunton even had to
make a visit to the mound in the
third inning to talk to Spencer,
who had just given up two walks
and a single to load the bases.

Cardinal 11

It didn't really matter. Spencer
at less than his best was still bet
ter than the Bears, who stranded
10 runners (seven in the first four
innings) and put on a not-too
impressive pitching display to
hand the Cardinal its 32nd win
of the season, 11-1.
"I just didn't have good stuff
today at all," said Spencer, who
struck out 10 — and gave up only
one unearned run — to up his
record to 10-0. "My slurve (half
slider, half curve) wasn't snap
ping, my fastball wasn't really
moving. , . . The ball was just
moving off the plate."
"Stan just wasn't quite in

sync," said Dunton, whose third
inning march to the mound
marked the earliest time this
season Spencer has received a
visit. "He might've been
frustratated, so I just went out
to give him a minute. It doesn't
take much to get him back on
track."
No kidding. Spencer worked out
of his bases-loaded jam by forcing
first baseman Troy Penix to pop
to left, and from then on only two
Bears even made it as far as sec
ond base.
"I took me a long time to get
comfortable, and even when I did
1 don't think I had very good
stuff," Spencer said. "A lot of
times I'll think I'm throwing well,
but I'll give up three runs and
maybe strike out only six or seven.
Then, when I don't think I have
good stuff, I'll strike out 10.
Strange game."
Especially when you're playing
the Bears, who with their 3-16
Six-Pac record are in serious dan
ger of becoming the first team in
the league's history to win less
than 10 games in a season.
The Cal pitching staff, with its
ERA of 6.51 — 8.08 (oh my lip!)
in conference play — had a typical
day, with Mark Juhas and Rob
Butler combining to end up with
twice as many hit batters (four)
as strikeout victims.
Tim Griffin took a bail in the
side twice from Juhas, and Butler
pegged Troy Paulsen and Paul
Carey — the latter on a slooooow
curve that took about a minute
to reach the plate — in the sixth.
"We hit two guys with a chan
geup and a curve," Cal Coach Bob
Milano said, "and another
(Griffin's second HBP) with a
fastball that was supposed to be
low and away. That frustrates me.
That pitch wasn't anywhere near
where it was supposed to be.
Weak."
Weak was the word: The Car
dinal pounded out 14 hits (four
from designated hitter David
Holbrook) to ice the game early.
Paul Carey tied it up at one-all
in the bottom of the second with
a home run to right — that's No.
10 on the year, No. 50 for the
career, leaving him four short of
Mark McGwire's Pac-10 record.
In the third a Bad News Bears
esque play on Troy Tallman's
popup ("I don't want it, you take

it!" "No, you take it!" "No, it's
yours!" "No, 1.." Plop!) led to
two more runs, and Stanford put
the game away in the fourth.
Griffin led off by getting hit,
Holbrook followed up with a bunt

single, and an out later Roger
Burnett ripped a triple (his first
of the year) to straightaway center
— the ball hit the wall just left
of the 400 mark and made the
score 6-1.

"After about three innings, we
went to sleep," Milano said. "In
the first and second, everyone in
the dugout was up, talking, giving
support, but all of a sudden it's
6-1 and everyone's sitting down."


Ooouch!
The California Bears ran into a brutal Cardinal machine yesterday, as Stanford mangled the Weenies
11-1. Here a Cal runner gets tangled up with Cardinal third baseman Tim Griffin in a close play.
