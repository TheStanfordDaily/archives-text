# Card trounces hapless Bears

### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
Sometimes you're hot even
when you're not.
Stanford pitcher Stan Spencer,
who has sizzled throughout the
season by methodically shutting
down each and every team he's
faced, finally cooled off a little
yesterday against the California
Bears in the 80-degree heat at
Sunken Diamond.
Spencer, who had walked a
grand total of one batter in his
previous 45 innings, gave an
astronomical three free passes to
the Bears yesterday. A Cal batter
reached base in every inning but
one. Heck, Stanford Pitching
Coach Tom Dunton even had to
make a visit to the mound in the
third inning to talk to Spencer,
who had just given up two walks
and a single to load the bases.

Cardinal 11

It didn't really matter. Spencer
at less than his best was still bet
ter than the Bears, who stranded
10 runners (seven in the first four
innings) and put on a not-too
impressive pitching display to
hand the Cardinal its 32nd win
of the season, 11-1.
"I just didn't have good stuff
today at all," said Spencer, who
struck out 10 — and gave up only
one unearned run — to up his
record to 10-0. "My slurve (half
slider, half curve) wasn't snap
ping, my fastball wasn't really
moving. , . . The ball was just
moving off the plate."
"Stan just wasn't quite in

sync," said Dunton, whose third
inning march to the mound
marked the earliest time this
season Spencer has received a
visit. "He might've been
frustratated, so I just went out
to give him a minute. It doesn't
take much to get him back on
track."
No kidding. Spencer worked out
of his bases-loaded jam by forcing
first baseman Troy Penix to pop
to left, and from then on only two
Bears even made it as far as sec
ond base.
"I took me a long time to get
comfortable, and even when I did
1 don't think I had very good
stuff," Spencer said. "A lot of
times I'll think I'm throwing well,
but I'll give up three runs and
maybe strike out only six or seven.
Then, when I don't think I have
good stuff, I'll strike out 10.
