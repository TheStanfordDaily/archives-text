# New environmental program set for fall
##

Facing growing demand for environmen
tal teaching and research, the University
is developing an environmental studies pro
gram that will be in place by this fall.
Wally Falcon, director of the Food Re
search Institute, and Roz Naylor, who
works at the Institute for International
Studies, are working together to hire the
appropriate faculty and establish an honors
program for fall quarter.
The interdisciplinary environmental
studies program will combine already
existing environmental faculty and re
sources from the departments of Biological
Sciences, Civil Engineering and Applied
Earth Sciences into a single department in
the School of Earth Sciences, Naylor said.
It will also add new faculty and resources
in economics, agriculture and international
studies.
In order to appease department chairs
who feared they would lose faculty to the
new program, professors are being allowed
to retain their positions in their original

departments, Naylor said.
As a result, the new program has received
the full support of faculty and administra
tion, she added.
The Institute for International Studies
is beginning the search for the first two
professors, in atmospheric chemistry and
environmental economics.
These positions will be paid for with
Centennial Campaign money, Naylor said.
At least one professor should be hired
by this fall, she said, adding she hopes the
endowments will "just give the program a
push, and then they'll draw other well
known professors in the field."
An environmental studies honors pro
gram is being implemented before a major
program because it is easier to do so, she
explained.
Meanwhile, Gary Ernst, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, said he hopes to
establish a major in the subject in his
school by next year, to be called earth sys
tems sciences. Falcon, Naylor and Ernst
are working together on this plan.
