# Undefeated at No. 1 singles as a freshman
## Mild-mannered netter is a Stark contrast to his game 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Literally minutes after the men's ten
nis team's heartbreaking loss to Cali
fornia on Wednesday, a woman walked
up to freshman Jonathan Stark with a
confused look on her face.
"I'm looking for Jonathan Stark," she
said. "You're him, aren't you?"
"Yes, I'm Jon Stark," he replied, not
giving any indication that just moments
before he had netted a volley in the No.
1 doubles match to give the Bears a 5-4
victory and the Cardinal its first loss
of the season.
"I'm a friend of one of your cousins,"
the lady continued. "Is the match over?"
"Afraid so," Stark responded.
"Well, that's okay," the woman said.
"Tennis is such a boring sport to watch
anyway, and I wasn't even sure if you
would be playing. Anyway, I've to go.
It was nice meeting you."
The lanky freshman smiled, shook the
woman's hand and said, "It was nice
meeting you too."
In a world where many of the best
athletes are egotistical, self- centered,
unappreciative and unruly, Cardinal su
perstar Jonathan Stark is a refreshing
change.
Stark is more than the No. 1 player
on the top-ranked Cardinal squad and
one of the best players in college tennis;
he is a team player, a hard-worker, a
role model — a compliment to the game,
as present doubles partner Dan Turbow
put it.
"For a guy with his incredible ability,
it is really a tribute to his personality
and character that he can stay so low
key," Turbow said. "I love being on the
team with him. He's a hard-worker. He
never complains. He's just got a lot of
class."
"He's just a great all-around guy,"
added Alex O'Brien, who plays at the
No. 2 spot just behind Stark. "You
would never think he's as good of a
player as he is if you just met him.
He's so laid-back. He's not cocky, but
he definitely has a reason to be."
"Jonathan has probably won more

sportsmanship awards than anyone,"
Coach Dick Gould said. "He's a class
act on and off the court."
Stark has consistently moved up in
the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings
this year to his present spot of No. 2.
He has reached the finals of two major
college tournaments and is still unde
feated in dual meet competition at 16-0.
Last weekend, he clobbered the No. 4-
ranked player in the country, USC's
Byron Black, 6-3, 6-1.
After his 6-3, 6-1 trashing of Califor
nia's No. 1 singles player, Bent-Ove
Pederson, few would argue that there
is anyone better in college tennis right
now.
But Stark doesn't think in those
terms. "My main goal is to make sure
we win the team championship in May,"
he said.
Stark is not low-key by accident.
When other teenage tennis phenoms
were traveling to Nick Bolletieri's, Stark
decided he wanted to stay at home in
Medford, Ore. "I just didn't think it
was worth it," Stark said. "Tennis was
always a major part of my life, but I
didn't want to let it take over. I just
wanted to be as normal a student as
possible."
Stark credits much of his success to
his parents, his two brothers and his
sister. "They never put pressure on me,"
Stark said. "And they've always made
sure I had fun with tennis. If I won,
that was great. If I lost, they'd still be
there to support me."

Staying home hardly had a negative
impact on Stark's tennis. In fact, at age
15, he was winning many of the nation's
top 18-and- under junior titles. Last
year, Stark won the Junior U.S. Open
Championship and captured the Junior
Wimbledon doubles title with classmate
Jared Palmer.
With all the tennis, Stark still man
aged to play three years of high school
basketball. He was an all-conference
player his senior year. "I didn't want
to get burned out on tennis. Basketball
was a good break, and it got me excited
for the tennis tournaments in the sum
mer," Stark said.
Stark's opponents have no trouble
telling you where his strength lies on
the court — the serve.
Against California Wednesday, the
Cardinal freshman served almost 30
aces in singles and doubles.
"I don't think [Boris] Becker can
serve any better or any harder than
that," California's Doug Eisenman said
after Wednesday's doubles match. "I
have never seen anyone in college tennis
serve that well. I didn't have a clue on
his serve the whole match."
"If he's serving well, his whole game
seems to click," O'Brien said.
"To me, watching him serve and vol
ley is like watching this monster come
after you," Turbow said. "He's as strong
as an ox. When he's serving well, I don't
think there is anyone in college tennis
that can return fhis servel."

Jonathan Stark has been untouchable as a freshman for the Stanford men's tennis
team this year. Stark has not lost a singles match so far this season, but remains
unaffected. "For a guy with his incredible ability, it is really a tribute to his personality
and character that he can stay so low-key," current doubles partner Dan Turbow says.
