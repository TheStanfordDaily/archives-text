# 85-year-olds at Stanford
## Retirement complex planned on University land 
### Sue Kown 
The site of the old Stanford Children's
Hospital may house a new retirement com
plex, if a proposal by a coalition of senior
citizens' interest groups is approved.
After the Children's Hospital moves to
the new Lucile Packard Children's Hospi
tal, which is presently under construction
next to the Medical Center, the Age Center
Alliance hopes to build 500 to 600 housing
units for the elderly on the abandoned site.
Alliance members foresee their project
as a state-of-the-art retirement community
equipped with a public resource for infor
mation and educational material on health
and aging as well as a day care center for
the 1,000 residents.
The site is located near the Stanford
Shopping Center on Sand Hill Road.
Sue Lempert, executive director of the
Age Center Alliance, said, "We are hoping
this will be a 21st century facility." For
example, she said the rooms would be
equipped with interactive communication
devices for residents' safety.
In addition to offering a monitored en
vironment, the facility's closeness to
campus will provide many opportunities

for senior citizens to interact with students,
according to Lempert.
Therefore, senior citizens will be able to
offer their experience and talents to the
Stanford community.
Lempert said she believes that the
housing complex "has unbelievable poten
tial for providing seniors with a way to
remain active in the community."
She added, "We must address the fact
that people are living longer. Individuals
well over 85 are still able to utilize their
talents." The alliance's idea is to provide
challenges for senior citizens and at the
same time keep them safe and comfortable
without making them feel "institution
alized."
The Hillsdale Group, a San Mateo con
tracting firm which specializes in building
housing for the elderly, recently released
plans for the facility. However, the project
must first be approved by the city of Palo
Alto and Stanford's Board of Trustees.
The cost of the project is still unknown.
The approval process will begin in June
when the developers bring their proposal
to the trustees. The city of Palo Alto will
also review the project in the fall. The
entire process will take about two years.
