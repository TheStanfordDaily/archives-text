Political leadership is the key to
Africa's future prosperity, said O.C.
Jonah, United Nations assistant secre
tary general for research, in the keynote
address of "Africa Week."
Kicking off the week-long celebration
sponsored by the African Student Asso
ciation, Jonah examined current prob
lems in Africa and offered his ideas on
political and economic restructuring last

night at CERAS Auditorium.
While Jonah explained to the crowd
of about 50 that poor political leadership
has been responsible for declining
economies among African nations, he
was skeptical about immediate commit
ment to either free market economies
or multiparty systems among African
nations.
He advocated a more patient approach,

saying that he was reluctant to
follow the model of reform that
has recently swept Europe.
"The idea of political pluralism
may be misplaced in Africa," he
explained, noting that many of
the conditions that were con
ducive to the development of de
mocracy in Europe are absent in
Africa.
In England, Jonah said, service
to one's country was originally
considered a privilege, but "most
[African] politicians come from
the dispossessed class and see pol
itics as a vehicle for profit."
Furthermore, Jonah predicted
that a multiparty system would
inevitably become a system based
on tribes, with voters adhering
strictly to their tribal allegiance
rather than making independent
political decisions.
A free market economy might
also be incompatible with Africa's
currently weak economic state.
"How can we adopt capitalism
without capital to invest?" Jonah
asked.
The speaker cited deficiencies
in education, agriculture and
health care as detrimental to

Africa and as key concerns for
future policy-makers. Education,
Jonah said, is the key to an "en
lightened public" and voters who
will be better equipped to make
independent political decisions.
Agriculture, health care and in
dustries that have been hurt by
foreign debt and trade imbalance
require improvement if Africa is
to become more prosperous, he
said.
Jonah closed his address with
a call for global assistance. "The
history of Africa," he said, "would
indicate that the African people
have earned the need for the sym
pathy of the world."
