Council of Presidents
O A Clean Slate
® Four Our Future

During the upcoming
year, the Council of Presidents
will be called upon more than
ever before to keep in touch with the
students it represents.
As the ASSU undergoes streamlin
ing, as student services are cut, as the
campus gropes toward pluralism, and
as the meaning of a Stanford education
continues to evolve, the COP will be
challenged to effectively represent the
diverse interests of all students at
Stanford.
"Four Our Future" is the slate best
suited to meet this challenge.
The individual members of "Four
Our Future" represent an impressively
diverse range of student interests.
Senior Ingrid Nava is a current
member of the COP and a member of
MEChA. Senior Jamie Green has been
an active member of Ram's Head
Theatrical Society and the ASSU's
Committee on Democracy in
Education. Junior Goodwin Liu was
the co-director of this year's You Can
Make a Difference conference. And
junior J. Forrest Tucker is a resident

assistant, the chief announcer for
KZSU, a member of the Black Student
Union and coordinator of Project De
mocracy 11.
As a unified slate, "Four Our Fu
ture" can draw upon the rich pasts of
its members and continue building a
student government which is true to
the principles of multiculturalism
upon which the People's Platform was
founded.
"Four Our Future" is committed to
offering a voice to those sectors of the
community historically under
represented in the ASSU, such as
women and students of color.
While striving to unify the campus,
"Four Our Future" must pay close
attention to a growing sense of aliena
tion on the part of students who do
not feel well-represented by the polit
ical message of the People's Platform.
That the opposing "A Clean Slate"
is running on a platform which prom
ises a student government for all stu
dents indicates there is a significant
fear that the People's Platform only
represents the interests of students of
color.
"Four Our Future" should be sensi
tive to this fear and go the extra mile
to incorporate all viewpoints. However,
those concerned about the growing in
fluence of students of color should
work to overcome this fear and realize
that a transition to pluralism involves
growing pains.
