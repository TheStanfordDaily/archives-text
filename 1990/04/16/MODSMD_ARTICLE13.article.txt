Amendment #1:
Simplified special fee
application process
® YES O NO

This amendment effectively removes
a bureaucratic hurdle for several stu
dent groups seeking to get their special
fee requests on the spring ballot.
Currently, groups who received more
than 60 percent of the vote in the
previous election need only senate ap
proval to appear on the ballot.
However, groups whose requests

were approved, but by fewer than 60
percent of the voters, must go through
the same channels to get on the ballot
as do groups appearing for the first
time and groups whose budgets were
rejected in the previous election.
Getting on the ballot then means
gathering signatures of 10 percent of
the student body and obtaining senate
approval — or forgoing senate approval
and gathering signatures of 20 percent
of the students.
This is silly and a waste of valuable
time.
Groups who had support of at least
50 percent of the voters a year ago
should not have to obtain 1,500 signa
tures to re-prove their worthiness to
appear on the ballot.

Amendment #2:
Fee refund elimination
<§> YES O NO

The abolition of fee refunds is long
overdue.
This amendment rights a fundamen
tal wrong of the ASSU and helps res
tore the integrity of financing student
groups at Stanford.
In addition, eliminating fee refunds
has several extremely positive side
effects:
• ASSU fees paid by all students will
be reduced by 25 percent. Presently,
student groups are permitted to tack
an extra 25 percent onto their fee re
quests to compensate for money likely
to be lost to fee refunds. Some groups
end up losing substantially more than
25 percent, however, crippling the or

ganizations' activities for the year. If
the amendment passes, student groups
will request only the amount they
need, and groups whose requests are
approved will get the exact amount
they asked for.
• The ASSU will save a substantial
amount of money. Last year, the ASSU
spent $15,000 administering refunds.
• Students who object to funding
specific groups will still have a mech
anism to steer their money away from
these groups. A provision in the
amendment allows students who object
to the mission of particular groups to
reallocate that money to the Senate
Discretionary Fund or to Program
Board. Consequently, no student need
directly fund a group to which he or
she is strongly opposed. Thus, the
amendment is true to the original in
tention of offering fee refunds but
eliminates the widespread abuse of the
refund option.

Amendment #3:
Inflation-indexing
of general fee base
<§> YES O NO

For several years, a flawed ASSU
voting procedure has left smaller stu
dent organizations on campus starved
for funding. This amendment is a pos
itive first step in providing a subsis
tence level of resources for these
groups.
Organizations that do not acquire
special fees in the spring election are
funded through various boards sup
ported by the ASSU general fee.
ASSU Bylaws dictate that the gen

eral fee is raised or lowered by vote
of the student body in the spring elec
tions. Options that appear on the bal
lot must include "no increase," as well
as symmetrical increases and
decreases, i.e. + 10 percent, -10 percent,
+20 percent, -20 percent, etc. Each
voter selects one figure from the list,
and the new fee amount is set to the
median of the voter selections.
The laws of statistics and the appeal
to uninformed voters of "keeping
things the same" have resulted in a
general fee base that has remained
stagnant during the last five years
while student-group operating costs
have spiraled upward.
Actuating the general fee base for
inflation will ensure that the current
dearth of available funding doesn't get
any worse. Thus, the proposed amend
ment is necessary and long overdue.
