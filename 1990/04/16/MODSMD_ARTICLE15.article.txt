## Hate speech humiliates 
### 
IF THERE ARE two things I've
learned in law school, they are, first,
that you can't make a coherent ar
gument about First Amendment doctrine
in three five-inch columns of newspaper
space — which, after all, is what law
reviews are for. So I won't.
And, second, that abstraction in such
doctrine exists somewhere near the same
level of reality that the abstractor exists
on — which is usually not the same level
of reality that I exist on. So I'd like to
give you a taste of my reality.
As others such as Law Profs. Mari
Matsuda and Charles Lawrence have
pointed out, in discussing the Student
Conduct Legislative Council's proposed
interpretation of the Fundamental Stand
ard, we're talking about two constitu
tional principles: equal protection and
free speech.
I share the concerns of those who see
any restrictions on speech, including that
proposed by the SCLC, as the first step
down a slippery slope. As a former jour
nalist and someone who was a female
member of a minority ethnic and reli
gious group growing up in a town
dominated by one race, one culture and
one religion, I know how valuable limita
tions on power structures' ability to cen
sor thought and speech are.
But I also have felt the pain of epithets
meant not to convey information but to
humiliate me. "Bitch." "Cunt." "Spic." I
still feel the pain of having a grade school
playmate use my mother's heritage —
my heritage — to assert her superiority
over me.
It was not the simple fact that my

mother was Mexican. I knew that. I know
that. It was the complex fact that my
playmate had thought of asserting all of
that to express her dominance, my sub
ordination. And we were both only 9
years old.
Speech does a lot of things. How speech
is spoken does a lot of things. While I
would not assert that only calmly spoken
speech (as opposed to passionate yelling
or woeful singing speech) is worthy of
protection, I would assert, cautiously,
that there are some things to balance
against some combinations of words (or
expressive actions), how they are con
veyed and what effect they have.
We all must at least acknowledge that
some messages are expressed to hurt and
to humiliate. We all know well that the
childhood saying, "Sticks and stone may
break my bones, but names will never
hurt me," is just not true.
Speech, orally, verbally or in the form
of expressive conduct, strikes some of
the deepest wounds imaginable. Sticks
and stones break bones. Names scar the
soul and break the spirit and render the
mind unable to function.
And in this liberal, rational society, the
mind has got to be able to function.
In a racist, sexist and homophobic so
ciety where physical violence has been
the surest form of dominance, speech has
played an essential role in keeping the
threat of physical violence always on the
horizon and in emblazening its own form
of dominance on its objects.
In a racist, sexist and homophobic so
ciety, words spoken to humiliate carve
wounds so deep that they may not kill

my body, but they will seep into my soul
where they fester, sometimes into anger,
sometimes into shame, until I do die in
the sense that I cease to have any ability
to function as a subject in this society.
These words, spoken to humiliate, take
my voice away at a time when it is es
sential that I speak. These words spoken
to humiliate act as a screen — keeping
me down and masking anything I am
able to utter in response as irrelevant.
After all, such utterances in response
have been spoken by someone who is n
bitch, a cunt, a spic.
Do I expect this campus, this society
to restrain these episodes of hurt and
humiliation? I, quite frankly, do not
know.
But I expect you to listen to my real
pain — as a woman, as a Latina whose
status as the daughter of a white man
has not completely whitened her, as some
one protected under the equal protection
clause — as surely as you listen to the
fear of the abstract pain of those who
would invoke their intellectual authority
(in the guise of the First Amendment)
to trump my humanity.
