University keeps
the promises it
makes to donors
In response to Scott Pearson's April
12 letter about housing women in the
Beta Theta Pi house: Surely you jest
when you say that a promise made to
donors more than 20 years ago is a
deplorable restriction; that the promise
the University made is a joke; and that
you would have more respect for the
administration if it burned down the
houses for the insurance money.
Why do you think the governing
board of this University is a board of
"trustees" rather than a board of
"directors?"
This University is a public "trust,"
which means that all of us who help

to run it do so in keeping with the
terms of the founding grant; we keep
our promises to the people of the state
of California who granted the charter;
we keep our promises to the donors
who give gifts that keep the doors
open; and we keep our promises to
students and everyone else.
Last year, gifts plus income on prior
gifts provided more money to the oper
ating budget than all the tuition pay
ments combined. That's a pretty strong
financial incentive to continue honoring
the promises we make to donors. But
even more important is the ethical
imperative to keep our promises.
You must be jesting when you sug
gest that attempting to solve a social
problem outweighs keeping one's prom
ise, or even calls for burning down
buildings.
