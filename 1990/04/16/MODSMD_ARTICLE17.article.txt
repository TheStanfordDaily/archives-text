# Chaparral will run write-in candidates for COP, senate
## 
### 
Thursday's front-page article charac
terizing the Chaparral as a mighty
political force on campus was right on
the money. However, there are a few
important clarifications we'd like to
make.
• Our Hammer and Coffin voters
resent being cast as apathetic people
who vote only to get a fee refund.
Obviously, the reason we got 14.6 per
cent of last year's COP vote is that
14.6 percent of the voters thought we
were the best slate for the job. And
who could argue, with such empty
campaign promises as a humor theme
house, a "Really Beat the Heck out of
the Bookstore" program and a hedonis
tic orgy of fun;
• We will still be offering those truly

apathetic and disillusioned voters the
choice of a write-in slate — one that
probably isn't really the best slate for
the job but will still give those
depraved, maniacal campus dead-beats
a chance to let people know they're
out there. This slate, along with a slew
of write-in Hammer and Coffin senate
candidates, will be announced in our
upcoming special ASSU election issue;
• Lastly, it's ironic that The Daily
credits our organization with such gar
gantuan power but can't bother to
spell our name correctly We were
referred to as the "Chapparal" 15
times. Webster's Ninth defines "chapar
ral" as "a dense impenetrable thicket
of shrubs or dwarf trees."
We are honored to the bear the
name Stanford Chaparral, with the "p"
and two "r"s, and we proudly give
homage to the megestic and august
shrubs of the California desert.
