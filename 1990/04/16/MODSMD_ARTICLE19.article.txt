Police overestimate
problems caused by
Grateful Dead
We are rather disturbed to find out
in the April 12 Daily that the May
Grateful Dead concerts have been can
celed due to police beliefs that every
one who attends the concert is on
drugs and causing problems.
This is an act of prejudice against
the Dead and their fans. Since when
does the Dean of Student Affairs Office
check with the police before inviting
guests to attend the campus? Student
Affairs does not check with the police
before inviting other guests such as
Ray Bradbury, Rosa Parks or any of
the several guest speakers that are
invited every day to lecture at various
departments, occasions and celebrations

on campus.
The claim that "one person was
found wandering in an academic build
ing proclaiming to be the Messiah"
makes us laugh, since this caused such
a problem to so many people. Would
we rather have someone walking
around the campus shouting racist
remarks or threatening people?
Proclaiming to be the Messiah is not
exactly "fighting words," nor is it a
violation of the Fundamental Standard.
Besides, who is to say he is not the
Messiah anyway?
With all of the police's special train
ing in communicating and working
with the public, it should be easy for
them to find a better, more productive
solution.

Slashing of RFs
and RAs will detract
from student life
The proposed reduction in the num
ber of resident fellows and resident
assistants is a great mistake. Residen
tial Education, through the RFs and
RAs, is without question a fundamen
tal part of student life "outside the
classroom."
The dorm experience at Stanford is
unique. Unlike at many universities,
students at Stanford are able to have a
personal relationship with both their
RF and RAs. One complaint of many
of my friends at other schools is that
they feel like a student ID number.
The absolute opposite is true here at
Stanford. If the number of RFs is
reduced, Linda Paulson, my RF, will
have more than 200 students under

her guidance. Establishing the personal
relationships which exist now would
simply be impossible under those cir
cumstances.
As a result, a very important aspect
of my Stanford experience would be
lost. Especially for freshmen, maintain
ing the lowest possible ratio of RFs to
students is essential.
A similar problem would result from
a reduction in the number of RAs. The
RA's most basic function is to help and
advise his or her students. This service
is especially important for freshmen,
who are forced to adapt to an entirely
new environment.
Multicultural issues are of particular
importance. To maintain this atmos
phere is doubly important right now
because of growing sentiment on
campus that — although multicul
turalism is given a lot of lip service —
differences, rather than similarities, in
race are stressed.

To reduce an important avenue for
the furthering of multicuituralism on
campus is ridiculous, considering that
Stanford is viewed nationally as being
a leading force of multicuituralism.
In my first year at Stanford, I have
felt like anything but a number. The
dorm atmosphere is unique and sets
Stanford apart from other major uni
versities.
The dormitory is one big family.
This atmosphere can make the differ
ence in attracting top students. The
friendly atmosphere here was the de
ciding factor in my choosing to attend
Stanford.
Especially considering University
President Donald Kennedy's recent
commitment to return to the basics of
teaching undergraduates, to reduce the
number of RFs and RAs now would be
a great injustice-
