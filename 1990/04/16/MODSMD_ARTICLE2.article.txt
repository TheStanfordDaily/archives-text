# Farewell, Tours?
## Overseas Studies may close two campuses 
### Andrew Tilton 
In response to University budget cuts,
the Overseas Studies Program is recom
mending that the Stanford Program in
Tours be closed, and the Salamanca pro
gram may be threatened as well.
Overseas Studies will not be spared the
effects of budget cuts to the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, and "a program or
programs overseas will have to be closed"
as a result, according to a statement re
leased by Overseas Studies.
Corbin Smith, deputy director of Over
seas Studies, said the Tours program will
be recommended for closure, "and we would
also want to discuss Salamanca if the target
is larger."
While the exact target amount of Over
seas Studies' portion of the Humanities
and Sciences cuts has not yet been deter
mined, the program would be better off
with a decreased number of centers, rather
than a reduction in the overall quality of
the centers, Smith said.
"We want to have strength under pro
grams that are there — we don't want to
have new ventures stymied," he explained.
Cutting the Florence program is also an
option under consideration, according to
another University source. Tours,
Salamanca and Florence are the most heav
ily funded by the University, so sources
said the remaining centers are less likely

to be affected.
The Tours program currently costs the
University $325,000 per year.
The exact amount of Overseas Studies'
budget cut will be determined within the
next few days, according to Smith. The
Program Committee for Overseas Studies,
consisting of both faculty and students,
will be responsible for making final deci
sions on center closings by mid-May.
Comments on particular programs and
other suggestions for the committee can
be sent to the Overseas Studies Office.
"We're trying to reach the decision that
would be best overall, trying to keep a
long-range goal in mind," said sophomore
Sophia Shing, a student member of the
committee.
However, senior James Mokhiber, an
other committee member, said that at a
meeting last Wednesday there was "sig
nificant opposition from both faculty and
students within the Program Committee
to closing any program," because the pro
grams are credit-bearing and because
closings will reduce the number of students
going overseas.
"Tours is most likely to be cut," Mok
hiber said, adding, "There are no present
plans to reconfigure the Paris program."
The closing of Tours would reduce the
number of students going overseas by about
100, he said.
Any closings will first occur in
the 1991-92 academic year, so pro
spective applicants will be affected
beginning next winter quarter. In
the future, students interested in
overseas travel may have to stop
out and attend a non-Stanford
program if they cannot find a
Stanford-sponsored program that
suits their language abilities,
Smith said.
Dean of Undergraduate Admis

sions Jean Fetter, asked what ef
fect she thought Overseas Studies
closings would have on future
Stanford applicants, said the pro
gram as a whole was a
"tremendous drawing card" for
Stanford. However, Fetter said
she thinks applicants are gener
ally more interested in the fact
that students can go overseas than
about programs in particular
countries.
"I don't think it will have a
great effect (on applications)," she
said. "In fact, I'm most often
asked about programs in the So
viet Union, which we don't have."
