## Reading between the lines: Media strikes out on Brown 
### 
"I did not and do not charge Stanford
with racism. I got my feelings hurt by
some unfortunate events. When asked
what was on my mind during [Friday's]'
game, those events were the answer.
"I certainly do not want any miscon
ceptions or stereotypes to hang over a
great school. It is certainly unfair to
persecute a ball club as it is only a
microcosm of our society."
— California pitcher Brad Brown,
in a statement released Saturday
"I looked at the paper, and that head
line . . . 'Ex-Cardinal Charges Stanford
with Racism.' The Chronicle headline
was completely off-base.'
— Brown, in an interview Saturday
"Look, 1 don't want you to think I
think they (Stanford players and
coaches) are racist. They're not. ... I
really don't want to be at the center of
a controversy or anything. . . . Look, I
don't want you to make a big deal out
of this."

— Brown, in the Friday interview
that led to the Chronicle story

Brad Brown, who played for two
years in Stanford's baseball pro
gram, transferred to California
this winter because of academic — he
wanted to mtyor in architecture, which
he couldn't do at Stanford — and fi
nancial reasons.
Last Friday, he pitched five strong
innings against his old team and was
interviewed by several reporters after
the game. During the interview he made
some comments that have since caused

a major stir in the media, most prom
inently a story in the San Francisco
Chronicle that appeared under the head
line "Ex-Cardinal Charges Stanford
With Racism."
The story portrayed Brown as an
angry, bitter player who left Stanford
partly because of the racist actions of
his teammates. It made Brown look like
he had a bone to pick with the Cardinal
baseball program, which had allegedly
mistreated him.
Nothing could be further from the
truth. Brown is not bitter. He is not
angry, and he most certainly was not
on a vendetta against his former team.
I was standing there listening to him
when he first made the statements, and
I thought it was clear he wasn't accusing
anyone of anything.
I was very wrong. In the next day's
papers, Brown was misrepresented,
under-quoted — the remarks he made
about the matter not being worth very
much attention were omitted from the
Chronicle story — and made to look

like someone who had had a terrible
experience at Stanford.
I was appalled.
It all started a few minutes after
Friday's game at Cal, which the Car
dinal had won 14-9. Brown pitched
rather well, and a few reporters were
gathered around him. One asked if there
had been any special motivation for him,
pitching against his old team.
"Well, there were a few things on my
mind," Brown said.
"Like what?" a reporter asked.
"Well ..." Brown paused, looked over
at the Cardinal, which was having a
team meeting in left field, and contin
ued. "Look, I really don't want to bust
anyone," he said, "but there were things
like a certain first baseman using the
word 'nigger' a little too much, a certain
assistant coach saying I was going to
be a crack dealer — jokingly, it was
always jokingly — and the sad fact that
I was the only black pitcher on the
team. That was on my mind today"

Just then, Brown realized how what
he said would look in the papers and
tried to do something about it. "Look,
I don't want you to think I think they're
racist. They're not," he said hurriedly.
One of the reporters wouldn't accept
that. "Then you'd better talk some
more," she said, "because from what
you've said it certainly sounds like that's
how you feel."
"All I'm saying," Brown said, "is that
sometimes players would use words be
hind my back, and certain coaches would
make jokes — not (Mark) Marquess,
this has nothing to do with him — and
those things ate away at me while I
was there. I really don't want to be at
the center of a controversy or anything,"
he added.
"Too late," one of the reporters
replied.
Brown went on to say how Marquess
had been nothing but helpful in helping
him transfer to Cal, and how he had
