## Reading between the lines: Media strikes out on Brown 
### 
"I did not and do not charge Stanford
with racism. I got my feelings hurt by
some unfortunate events. When asked
what was on my mind during [Friday's]'
game, those events were the answer.
"I certainly do not want any miscon
ceptions or stereotypes to hang over a
great school. It is certainly unfair to
persecute a ball club as it is only a
microcosm of our society."
— California pitcher Brad Brown,
in a statement released Saturday
"I looked at the paper, and that head
line . . . 'Ex-Cardinal Charges Stanford
with Racism.' The Chronicle headline
was completely off-base.'
— Brown, in an interview Saturday
"Look, 1 don't want you to think I
think they (Stanford players and
coaches) are racist. They're not. ... I
really don't want to be at the center of
a controversy or anything. . . . Look, I
don't want you to make a big deal out
of this."

— Brown, in the Friday interview
that led to the Chronicle story

Brad Brown, who played for two
years in Stanford's baseball pro
gram, transferred to California
this winter because of academic — he
wanted to mtyor in architecture, which
he couldn't do at Stanford — and fi
nancial reasons.
Last Friday, he pitched five strong
innings against his old team and was
interviewed by several reporters after
the game. During the interview he made
some comments that have since caused

a major stir in the media, most prom
inently a story in the San Francisco
Chronicle that appeared under the head
line "Ex-Cardinal Charges Stanford
With Racism."
The story portrayed Brown as an
angry, bitter player who left Stanford
partly because of the racist actions of
his teammates. It made Brown look like
he had a bone to pick with the Cardinal
baseball program, which had allegedly
mistreated him.
Nothing could be further from the
truth. Brown is not bitter. He is not
angry, and he most certainly was not
on a vendetta against his former team.
I was standing there listening to him
when he first made the statements, and
I thought it was clear he wasn't accusing
anyone of anything.
I was very wrong. In the next day's
papers, Brown was misrepresented,
under-quoted — the remarks he made
about the matter not being worth very
much attention were omitted from the
Chronicle story — and made to look

like someone who had had a terrible
experience at Stanford.
I was appalled.
It all started a few minutes after
Friday's game at Cal, which the Car
dinal had won 14-9. Brown pitched
rather well, and a few reporters were
gathered around him. One asked if there
had been any special motivation for him,
pitching against his old team.
"Well, there were a few things on my
mind," Brown said.
"Like what?" a reporter asked.
"Well ..." Brown paused, looked over
at the Cardinal, which was having a
team meeting in left field, and contin
ued. "Look, I really don't want to bust
anyone," he said, "but there were things
like a certain first baseman using the
word 'nigger' a little too much, a certain
assistant coach saying I was going to
be a crack dealer — jokingly, it was
always jokingly — and the sad fact that
I was the only black pitcher on the
team. That was on my mind today"

Just then, Brown realized how what
he said would look in the papers and
tried to do something about it. "Look,
I don't want you to think I think they're
racist. They're not," he said hurriedly.
One of the reporters wouldn't accept
that. "Then you'd better talk some
more," she said, "because from what
you've said it certainly sounds like that's
how you feel."
"All I'm saying," Brown said, "is that
sometimes players would use words be
hind my back, and certain coaches would
make jokes — not (Mark) Marquess,
this has nothing to do with him — and
those things ate away at me while I
was there. I really don't want to be at
the center of a controversy or anything,"
he added.
"Too late," one of the reporters
replied.
Brown went on to say how Marquess
had been nothing but helpful in helping
him transfer to Cal, and how he had

never mentioned any of this to
his former coach.
"Look, I don't want you to make
a big deal out of this," protested
Brown, who was increasingly
aware that what he said was going
to completely overshadow how
and why he said it. "This had
nothing to do with why I trans
ferred. I transferred here because
of academics — I wanted to mtyor
in architecture — and financial
reasons. I'm living at home, which
saves me money, and I'm saving
$8,000 a year on tuition."
Right then I left. For three
reasons. First, I was satisfied that
Brown did not feel there was any
earth-shattering issue here — I'll
explain why I felt that way in a
minute. Second, Stanford had
ended its team meeting, and I
wanted to interview some players
about the game.
Third, I already had a good idea
of what was going to be in the
next day's papers, and I thought
if I stayed to watch, I'd get sick.
Now, the Chronicle did not
misquote Brown. He did
say that a player had used
the word nigger, and he did say
that coaches had joked about his
becoming a crack dealer. So, you
ask, how could I think there was
no story here?
Easy. There is absolutely no
way a sane human could have
watched Brown and thought he
was "accusing" or "charging"
anyone with racism. He was in
creasingly uncomfortable with the
direction the interview was
taking, repeatedly said he didn't
want a big deal to be made out
of what he said and went out of
his way to make sure nothing he
said would (he thought) reflect on
the program as a whole.
Brown used the word "racist"
exactly once during the time I
was there, and that was to make
sure the reporters knew he didn't
think anyone on the baseball team
was a racist.
I'm no expert at body language
or mannerisms, but I thought I
knew enough to realize that how
Brown was making his remarks
was quite telling. He wasn't bitter.
In fact, he was almost apologetic
for bringing it up in the first
place.
He was fidgety and kept glanc
ing away, as if he weren't really
sure he wanted to talk about it
a€ all. None of this can possibly
show up in a newspaper story.
It's a failure of the medium: What
is said goes in; how it's said does
not.
The most telling thing, though,
was why he said what he did. Was
it because he was angry? No. Be
cause he wanted to cause prob
lems for Stanford? No way. He
brought it up because the inci

dents happened to be on his mind
while he was pitching, and that's
what had been motivating him.
He'd had his feelings hurt before,
and was remembering those times
during the game.
After the game the next day —
after the first stories had broken,
after racism had become the only
topic of conversation at Sunken
Diamond — Brown said he stood
by his remarks, but wanted to
clarify them. "I wasn't accusing
anyone," he said.
"I was asked what I'd been
thinking about, and that's what
was on my mind. Maybe I was
too honest.... I was surprised at
the magnitude of the whole
thing."
It seemed the only people who
weren't overreacting were Brown
and the Stanford players. Several
Cardinal players talked to Brown
before and after the game, and
Brown also talked to Marquess.
"What came out (in the papers)
wasn't what we know about Brad
Brown," Marquess said. "We
know him — he was here for two
years — and we didn't want to
jump to any conclusions because
of something in the paper."
For his part, Brown said "I
didn't want to cause problems for
the program or Stanford. I have
good memories of Stanford." And,
in the statement he had written
for those who hadn't been paying
attention the day before, Brown
said "I want to repeat that these
events were in no way the reason
I left the program."
There are several lessons to
be learned here, and the
most prominent is that
what we say — whether or not
it's in jest, whether or not it's
intentional — can hurt the people
we care about.
Brown knew the crack dealer
jokes were not intended to hurt
him, and he never said anything
about them to anyone on the
team, but they hurt him none
theless. No one on the team ever
thought that he might have been
hurt, and that's unfortunate.
I'm sure he wasn't the only
player on the team who was joked
about — everyone takes their
share of abuse from other players.
It doesn't matter what color a
player happens to be, he's going
to get ragged on. The remarks
were not strong enough for him
to ever bring it up to anyone, and
he insists they had nothing to do
with why he left.
But they still hurt, and at the
very least they made him feel un
comfortable. "I'm sure they'll
think about it," Brown said Sat
urday. "If there's anything good
to come from this, that'll be an
automatic consequence."
As for the player who used the
offensive word "a little too much":
Once is too much. Grow up.
Brown, too, probably learned
something: When you haven't
talked with any of the players or

coaches involved about something
that's been bothering you, the
media probably isn't the best
place to start talking about it.
"I feel I should have spoken
with Marquess," Brown said in
the statement he brought with
him to the game Saturday. Why
did he bring a written statement?
Well, he knew after his initial
dealing with reporters that the
impression you intend to give and
what ends up in the paper don't
always have a lot to do with each
other.
And that leaves us with the
media.
Why was that headline
written?
Why did the Chronicle story say
the incidents made Brown's deci
sion to transfer easy, when he had
stated several times they had
"nothing to do with" his decision
to leave?
Why did the Chronicle forget
that Brown said, "I don't want
you to think they're racist.
They're not"?
Why did yesterday's Times
Tribune say Brown "endured ra
cial slurs and racist jokes" after
Brown had released his statement
saying he accused no one of rac
ism'?
Why did yesterday's Examiner
say Brown called for an athletic
department investigation of the
baseball team when he didn'tt
I was standing next to Brown
when he was asked if he thought
someone should look into the
baseball program. "No," was the
answer. (I thought it was self
explanatory.) "They're not going
to form a committee or anything,"
he said.
I'm sure you all have your own
opinions about what's happened
— I know what I saw and heard,
and you can believe me if you
want — but remember, as you
discuss what's happened here,
that you'll probably be basing
your opinion on what you've read.
Usually that's not a problem,
but consider this:
The Associated Press wire serv
ice picked up the Chronicle story
and sent it to every newspaper in
the country. Is that bad? A little,
but it's not a disaster.
What is a disaster is that the
wire version of the story omits
Brown's statements that he knew
the remarks were made jokingly.
Now, the entire country has the
chance to read the words: "He
(Brown) said when he was with
the Cardinal one member of the
Stanford team used a racial slur
and an assistant coach 'said I'd
probably become a crack dealer.' "
Is that the truth? Yes. The
whole truth? Not even close.
Sometimes, what we say — and
how it is manipulated — can hurt
the people we care about.
