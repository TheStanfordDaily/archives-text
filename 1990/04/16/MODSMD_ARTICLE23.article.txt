# Spikers upset Trojans, gain playoff spot

As sophomore swing hitter
Duncan Blackman was preparing
on the bench alone for Stanford's
match with No. 1 Southern Cal
ifornia, he glanced over toward
the press table, stared for one
meaningful instant, and pro
ceeded to deliver one fantastic
primal scream. In retrospect, it
seems appropriate that the player
who, in this fashion, started the
triumphant Cardinal night would
— when all was said and done —
also end it.

Charged by a high voltage
crowd and national ESPN cover
age, Blackman and his Stanford
teammates upset the top-ranked
Trojans at Burnham Pavilion Fri
day night in perhaps the collegiate
match of the young decade, 15-6,
15-10, 9-15, 7-15, 16-14. The Car
dinal maintained its mental vigor
Saturday, trashing No. 6 San
Diego State 15-12, 15-4, 15-2 thus
completing its undefeated home
season and clinching a playoff
berth at the Western Intercollegi
ate Volleyball Association cham
pionships next week.
Even ESPN could not have
realized what it had gotten itself
into Friday night. Shortly after
Blackman's initiatory bellow, en
ergetic fans penetrated the pavil
ion's tiny confines in a record
turnout as the crowd exceeded
capacity by the start of the match.
The noise-level crested as the
Band commenced its traditional
drum beat for the announcement
of the starting lineups. The team
and each of its 1412 supporters

that night seemed to know well
the task at hand.
"We have no choice about it,"
swing hitter Robert Hillman said.
"We have to be at peak level."
Peak level wouldn't do the Car
dinal justice when discussing
Stanford's performance in the
first game. Spearheaded by a
punishing Blackman block against
the side-out efficient Trojans, the
Cardinal scurried off to an 8-0
run.
Senior Dan Hanan joined Black
man and Hillman in the early
melee, connecting on the first of
his 20 kills and stuffing another
side-out attempt. As each point
was decided, the Cardinal starters
raised their hands in exultation
and the crowd — which had been
deafening since the first serve —
erupted in chaos.
Following a Blackman jump
serve ace to make the score 8-0,
the Trojans finally registered on
the scoreboard but managed only
six points the rest of the game.
Outside hitter Dave Goss and
Hillman continued to pelt the
USC hardwood as Stanford hit a
scarcely believable .433 in the
game.
"We showed the kind of team
we're capable of being, setter
Parker Blackman said.
The members of the team, ac
customed to quiet, orthodox
crowds of 800, attributed much
of their first game success to the
outrageous fans. "I'd like to per
sonally thank the crowd," Duncan
Blackman said. "They pretty
much won that first game for us.
The sheer mass of people creates
such a noise. It was like the roof
caved in. It wears and tears the
opponent because they feel like
they're losing."
That feeling seemed to plague
the Trojans into the second game
as well. After an early 2-2 tie,
Stanford set off on a comparable

five-point run in which Hanan
and Goss continued to pound
away. Parker Blackman contrib
uted two dump kills enabling the
Cardinal to thoroughly confuse
the Trojan block. "Hitting-wise
we had a great game," Hanan
said. "We kept them guessing."
The m£yority of the guessing
concerned Hanan himself. Setter
Parker Blackman would appear
to set Hanan in the middle, to
whom two blockers always com
mitted, enabling Blackman to feed
the outside attack.
As the game progressed, how
ever, Hanan saw more sets come
his direction. At 11-7, the All-
America senior placed his fifth kill
of the game in the Trojan back
court tying him with Olympic
Captain Scott Fortune as
Stanford's all-time kills leader. On
the next point, Hanan delivered
again to break the prestigious
mark. The 6-foot-5 national team
member finished with 20 on the
night for a .457 percentage.
The intermission between the
second and third games enabled
a few fans who felt the match was
over to escape the searing hot pa
vilion and allowed the Trojans to
recollect themselves.
They struck quickly in the third
to take the lead for the first time
of the match and then seemed to
ease into the side-out rhythm that
has separated them from the rest
of the country. Despite valiant de
fensive efforts on the part of
senior Craig Forsyth and Hanan
who both had roof blocks, the Car
dinal could do little better than
match side-outs. Stanford outhit
USC .405 to .264 but fell 15-9.
The players' disappointment in
their inability to close out the
match seemed to develop into
pained negativity as the squads

switched sides. Forsyth, who in
jured his ankle after landing on
a teammates' foot in the third
game, was removed and forced to
watch potentially his last col
legiate match from the bench.
The 6-foot-3 middle blocker had
reason to worry as USC seemed
to toughen in the fourth game
committing only four attack er
rors and hitting .542. Adam Keefe
entered the game to hooting
cheers in place of Forysth and
offered three kills right away.
Mike Lowe, a reserve outside hit
ter, rested Goss and also contrib
uted some crowd-pleasing plays
including a stuff block at 4-9.
"I try to fire up the team and
try to get us back together," Lowe
said. "Hopefully I'll get a block."
Despite doing just that, he and
Keefe still could not unscramble
the Trojan side-out formula as
USC prevailed 15-7.
Momentum had certainly
shifted in USC's favor as the
teams prepared for the final
game. The Trojans looked to ben
efit from the rapid-score format
of the fifth game as they would
score with each side-out,
USC seized an early lead and
then proceeded to command a
frightening advantage at 9-4.
Goss buoyed the Cardinal with

several side-out kills but USC
would not budge. Bryan Ivie, the
Trojan star hitter, continued to
attack from every angle and po
sition on the court and menaced
Stanford with several of his
match-high 26 kills.
Sturm, as is customary, never
flinched and inserted junior John
Alstrom to serve and rebound the
flailing Cardinal. The crowd ex
ploded as Duncan Blackman
pounded three kills, and Hanan
roofed two attacks to tie the
match at 10-10.
USC would lead two more times
but Goss answered each accord
ingly. Keefe blasted two kills to
make it 14-13 and set up the final
point. The Cardinal served, dug
a hard-hit shot miraculously, then
watched as Parker Blackman set
brother Duncan swinging to the
outside.
"It was a high flat ball," Duncan
Blackman narrated. "I didn't hit
it as hard as I could have but it
just rolled over and landed."
Landing Stanford its biggest
win of the season.
The crowd poured out onto the
floor and swarmed the team who
had hit an unconscious .722 in
the final game.
The celebration seemed to spill
over to the next night as the Car
dinal thrashed No. 6 San Diego
State. Dave Goss hit .542 and had
a match-high 15 kills to lead the
Cardinal in the three-game sweep.

Cardinal 3, Trojans 2 '

Cardinal 3, Aztecs 0 |

Charged by a high voltage
crowd and national ESPN cover
age, Blackman and his Stanford
teammates upset the top-ranked
Trojans at Burnham Pavilion Fri
day night in perhaps the collegiate
match of the young decade, 15-6,
15-10, 9-15, 7-15, 16-14. The Car
dinal maintained its mental vigor
Saturday, trashing No. 6 San
Diego State 15-12, 15-4, 15-2 thus
completing its undefeated home
season and clinching a playoff
berth at the Western Intercollegi
ate Volleyball Association cham
pionships next week.
Even ESPN could not have
realized what it had gotten itself
into Friday night. Shortly after
Blackman's initiatory bellow, en
ergetic fans penetrated the pavil
ion's tiny confines in a record
turnout as the crowd exceeded
capacity by the start of the match.
The noise-level crested as the
Band commenced its traditional
drum beat for the announcement
of the starting lineups. The team
and each of its 1412 supporters

that night seemed to know well
the task at hand.
"We have no choice about it,"
swing hitter Robert Hillman said.
"We have to be at peak level."
Peak level wouldn't do the Car
dinal justice when discussing
Stanford's performance in the
first game. Spearheaded by a
punishing Blackman block against
the side-out efficient Trojans, the
Cardinal scurried off to an 8-0
run.
Senior Dan Hanan joined Black
man and Hillman in the early
melee, connecting on the first of
his 20 kills and stuffing another
side-out attempt. As each point
was decided, the Cardinal starters
raised their hands in exultation
and the crowd — which had been
deafening since the first serve —
erupted in chaos.
Following a Blackman jump
serve ace to make the score 8-0,
the Trojans finally registered on
the scoreboard but managed only
six points the rest of the game.
Outside hitter Dave Goss and
Hillman continued to pelt the
USC hardwood as Stanford hit a
scarcely believable .433 in the
game.
"We showed the kind of team
we're capable of being, setter
Parker Blackman said.
The members of the team, ac
customed to quiet, orthodox
crowds of 800, attributed much
of their first game success to the
outrageous fans. "I'd like to per
sonally thank the crowd," Duncan
Blackman said. "They pretty
much won that first game for us.
The sheer mass of people creates
such a noise. It was like the roof
caved in. It wears and tears the
opponent because they feel like
they're losing."
That feeling seemed to plague
the Trojans into the second game
as well. After an early 2-2 tie,
Stanford set off on a comparable

five-point run in which Hanan
and Goss continued to pound
away. Parker Blackman contrib
uted two dump kills enabling the
Cardinal to thoroughly confuse
the Trojan block. "Hitting-wise
we had a great game," Hanan
said. "We kept them guessing."
The m£yority of the guessing
concerned Hanan himself. Setter
Parker Blackman would appear
to set Hanan in the middle, to
whom two blockers always com
mitted, enabling Blackman to feed
the outside attack.
As the game progressed, how
ever, Hanan saw more sets come
his direction. At 11-7, the All-
America senior placed his fifth kill
of the game in the Trojan back
court tying him with Olympic
Captain Scott Fortune as
Stanford's all-time kills leader. On
the next point, Hanan delivered
again to break the prestigious
mark. The 6-foot-5 national team
member finished with 20 on the
night for a .457 percentage.
The intermission between the
second and third games enabled
a few fans who felt the match was
over to escape the searing hot pa
vilion and allowed the Trojans to
recollect themselves.
They struck quickly in the third
to take the lead for the first time
of the match and then seemed to
ease into the side-out rhythm that
has separated them from the rest
of the country. Despite valiant de
fensive efforts on the part of
senior Craig Forsyth and Hanan
who both had roof blocks, the Car
dinal could do little better than
match side-outs. Stanford outhit
USC .405 to .264 but fell 15-9.
The players' disappointment in
their inability to close out the
match seemed to develop into
pained negativity as the squads

switched sides. Forsyth, who in
jured his ankle after landing on
a teammates' foot in the third
game, was removed and forced to
watch potentially his last col
legiate match from the bench.
The 6-foot-3 middle blocker had
reason to worry as USC seemed
to toughen in the fourth game
committing only four attack er
rors and hitting .542. Adam Keefe
entered the game to hooting
cheers in place of Forysth and
offered three kills right away.
Mike Lowe, a reserve outside hit
ter, rested Goss and also contrib
uted some crowd-pleasing plays
including a stuff block at 4-9.
"I try to fire up the team and
try to get us back together," Lowe
said. "Hopefully I'll get a block."
Despite doing just that, he and
Keefe still could not unscramble
the Trojan side-out formula as
USC prevailed 15-7.
Momentum had certainly
shifted in USC's favor as the
teams prepared for the final
game. The Trojans looked to ben
efit from the rapid-score format
of the fifth game as they would
score with each side-out,
USC seized an early lead and
then proceeded to command a
frightening advantage at 9-4.
Goss buoyed the Cardinal with

several side-out kills but USC
would not budge. Bryan Ivie, the
Trojan star hitter, continued to
attack from every angle and po
sition on the court and menaced
Stanford with several of his
match-high 26 kills.
Sturm, as is customary, never
flinched and inserted junior John
Alstrom to serve and rebound the
flailing Cardinal. The crowd ex
ploded as Duncan Blackman
pounded three kills, and Hanan
roofed two attacks to tie the
match at 10-10.
USC would lead two more times
but Goss answered each accord
ingly. Keefe blasted two kills to
make it 14-13 and set up the final
point. The Cardinal served, dug
a hard-hit shot miraculously, then
watched as Parker Blackman set
brother Duncan swinging to the
outside.
"It was a high flat ball," Duncan
Blackman narrated. "I didn't hit
it as hard as I could have but it
just rolled over and landed."
Landing Stanford its biggest
