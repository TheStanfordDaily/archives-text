# Homer clinches sweep
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
California pitcher Mark Juhas
may think twice the next time he
feels like challenging Paul Carey.
Juhas, who had started Cal's
11-1 loss to Stanford last Thurs
day, was called on again Saturday
to pitch the ninth inning of a 9-9
game — and proceeded to get
right into trouble.
With one down, Juhas hit David
McCarty in the side (his third hit
batter in the two outings) and
watched Paul Carey stroll to the
plate.
Carey took a casual practice
swing, and then another. Juhas
shook off one sign, took the next,
checked the runner and fired.
Wrong answer.

Cardinal takes two from

Bears, sweeps series

Carey's home run (his 11th of
the year), which cleared the left
field wall and is still flying some
where, completed Stanford's
three-game sweep of the Bears
and gives the Cardinal a 34-7
record, 14-3 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division.
Stanford has won eight in a
row, 12 of its last 13 and, with
swoops in its last three Six-Pac
series, is in serious danger of cor
nering the market on brooms.
"It was a first-pitch fastball,"
Carey said. "I haven't seen that
for awhile. All day I was seeing
off-speed junk." With good rea
son: Carey had sent a Juhas fast
ball to the moon on Thursday,

and Juhas had come back with
all split-fingers the next time to
strike him out.
"That's why I figured for sure
I'd see the split-finger," Carey
said. "Hey, I respect that. He's a
good pitcher and a good compet
itor."
Carey's homer overshadowed
the efforts of pitcher Scott Weiss,
who came on in relief for the sec
ond day in a row to shut down
the Bears, and catcher Troy Tal
lman, who homered (also for the
second straight game) to help pull
the Cardinal out of a 6-1 hole.
And Jeff Hammonds, who went
four-for-five to run his hitting
streak to 35 games, was also al
most lost in the hubbub surround
ing Carey's home run.
On Friday, Weiss gave up only
three hits in two and two-thirds
innings to seal the Cardinal's 14-9
win at Cal, and Saturday he
picked up the win by going the
last three and two-thirds, giving
up five hits and a run.
"Scott's pitched super for us the
last four weeks," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "He had a
real good fastball today."
Pitching on consecutive days
didn't bother Weiss at all. "Ac
tually, my arm felt better today,"
he said. "Yesterday I had trouble
getting loose."
Weiss was within a strike of
finishing the game at 9-8 in the
top of the ninth, but then the
Bears hit three straight singles
— the last a wimpish squibbler
that snuck between McCarty and
Troy Paulsen into right field —
to tie the game. "I was kind of
ticked off, but then Paul comes
through and picks me up, and
we're on a roll," Weiss said.
