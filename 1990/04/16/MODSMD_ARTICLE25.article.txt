# Card salvages victory
## 
### David Earnest Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY - Weird. Totally
weird.
There's probably no better way
to describe Stanford's 14-9 victory
over California at Evans Diamond
on Friday afternoon. Sure, the day
started off normal enough. It was
sunny and pleasant, just another
average spring day of baseball.
Wrong.
By the day's end, three-and-a
half torturous hours of miscues,
atrocious pitching, and simply
bizarre plays later, a California
outfielder had tried to pitch, Stan
ford had scored its first seven
runs on three hits, Cardinal
pitcher Mike Mussina had tallied
a win in spite of giving up five
earned runs in six and a third
innings, and a stunned Berkeley
crowd tried to make sense of the
debacle as they thankfully left the
stadium for the calm and ordered
world of Bay Area rush-hour traf
fic on a Friday afternoon.
And win Stanford did, though
not without some problems. As
with Thursday's and Saturday's
Stanford victories over the Golden
Bears, the Cardinal offense
touched the California pitching
for double digits. Though the
Bears' pitching staff couldn't posi
tively assist California's effort, the
hurlers did provide an impressive
contribution to Friday's farce.
Bear starter Nate Brown, a
freshman lefthander, threw seven
walks in his 1% innings of work
to spark a seven-run, three-hit
(not exactly a barrage) Stanford
second inning that gave the Car
dinal a comfortable, though short

lived, lead. The seven walks
Brown gave up are understanda
ble, however, since he is listed on
the California roster as an out
fielder. Why Brown was pitching
is not quite as clear.
Brown loaded the bases in the
second, no thanks to an error by
Cal third baseman Matt Hansen,
and threw four straight balls to
Stanford third baseman Tim Grif
fin to plate a run.
California Head Coach Bob
Milano then yanked Brown in fa
vor of freshman right-hander
Roger Weems, who is listed as
pitcher. Weems, however, pro
ceeded to field Roger Burnett's
ground ball back to the mound
and throw wildly to first baseman
Troy Penix, allowing two runs to
score.
Fortunately the inning ended
three batters later when catcher
Troy Tallman, the 12th Cardinal
hitter in the inning, flied out to
center field.
Unfortunately, the bottom half
of the second then followed, and
Stanford seemed less than enthu
siastic about the seven-run lead
the Bears had so generously
spotted them. Starter Mussina
gave up six hits in the second,
including two home runs.
By the end of the second, which
lasted a grueling hour and 10
minutes, California had plated six
runs on six hits.
In the third inning, Stanford
added four runs to take a 11-6
lead even though the middle three
of the Cardinal batting order, in
nine plate appearances in the first
three innings, had gone only 0-
fcr-1 — with three RBI(!) thanks
to three walks.
