# Meet sheds light on track goals
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
Before Saturday's Stanford Track Classic, the
track and field teams had three goals in mind for
the meet:
First, they wanted to qualify several more athletes
for the Pacific 10 Conference meet.
Second, they wanted to improve all of their marks,
preparing themselves for Big Meet and the getting
nearer-than-you-might-think postseason.
Third, they wouldn't have minded qualifying some
folks for the NCAA meet.
So by the end of Saturday's events, at least three
things had become clear for the Cardinal:
One, their primary goal of qualifying more ath
letes for the Pac-10 Conference meet met with less
than desirable success.
Two, many of the athletes improved their season
best marks — and many did not.
Three, Stanford will have at least three repre
sentatives at the NCAAs.
But let us begin with the good — or, rather, the
best — news.
Senior distancer Bill Crowley ran the fastest 1500-
meter race of his career, finishing with an NCAA
qualifying time of 3:41.32. He took nearly 10 seconds
off his previous season best and almost six seconds
off his previous personal record, set in 1988.
Crowley's time is currently a good three seconds
faster than any other in the Pac-10.
Alex Accetta, a sophomore, ran the same race
with a 3:49.6 time, bringing him within tenths of
the Pac-10 qualifying mark. He should surpass that
mark this weekend at the Stanford Collegiate Open.
Although California's Sheila Hudson is virtually

guaranteed to win the Pac-10 — if not the national
— women's triple jump, Stanford has proven itself
to possess stacked talent in that event.
Senior Venessa Henlon improved her previous
season-best mark in the triple jump by more than
2.5 feet to become the third Cardinal woman to
qualify for Pac-lOs in that event. The others are
Jackie Edwards and Alysia Hubbard, who also both
improved considerably, posting impressive marks on
Saturday.
Freshman Rhonda Oliver was the Cardinal's third
postseason qualifier on the weekend. She placed
second in the 400-meters with 55.52 second time,
good enough to secure her a spot in the Pac-10 meet.
Dave Strang showed why he is worthy of com
peting in such international competition as the Com
monwealth Games by blazing the 800-meters in
1:47.83, just eight hundreths from the NCAA
qualification mark. His time is currently the best
in the Pac-10.
Just behind him, Accetta closed to within four
tenths of the Pac-10 threshold, giving him another
event to look to qualify in this weekend.
Now the question for the Cardinal is, will they
manage to reach their goal of 30 athletes in the
Pac-10 meet? Assistant coach Scott Chisam stated
that he wanted to reach that figure by Big Meet,
one week from this Saturday. With only 18 currently
qualified, that goal may be somewhat farther away
than anticipated.
However, the arguments favoring the Cardinal
cannot be denied. Several are already so close to
qualifying that each can be considered a lock, and
with injuries abating in certain key areas — hurdles,
for instance — Stanford looks to be poised to
surprise the Pac-10 Conference.
