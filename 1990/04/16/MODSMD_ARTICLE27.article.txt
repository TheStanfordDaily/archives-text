# Gulls soar into town
## 
### 
Their school is in South
ern California, but they
come from all over. They are
the women's tennis team of
the United States Interna
tional University.
A traditional Stanford op
ponent, the Soaring Gulls
will pay a visit to the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium at 1:30
p.m. today to face the
mighty Cardinal.
Stanford is currently at
22-0 on the season and 58-0
since April of 1988. The Car
dinal has been ranked No.
1 all season.
Sophomore Debbie Gra
ham, who sustained multi
ple injuries in a fall last
week, resumed practicing
over the weekend and said
she was feeling much better.
The Gulls have one of the
nation's top freshmen in
Giovanna Carotenuto, who
hails from Castilone, Italy.
Sandra Birch, Stanford's
No. 1 singles player, broke
out of a slump Wednesday
with a big victory over Cal
ifornia's Lisa Albano. Still,
she is likely to lose her top
ranking nationally.
