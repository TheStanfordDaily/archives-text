### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Arizona and Arizona State
hoped to catch a Stanford men's
tennis team in the middle of a
slump.
What they met instead was a
Cardinal team as hot as Glenn
Solomon's traditional red game
cap.

Cardinal 9, Wildcats 0

Cardinal 6, Sun Devils 0

In its two matches this week
end, the Cardinal did not give up
a single match. In fact, against
Arizona State, the No. 7-ranked
team in the country, Stanford did
not even relinquish a set.
"I think the loss to California
last Wednesday kind of woke us
up. Our pride was shot down a
little," Solomon said. "We all want
to prove that we are a great team
again. We are on a mission right
now."
Coach Dick Gould was handing
out lavish praise. "This team is
playing very well right now. We
have a loss, but this team is play
ing to their potential and improv
ing with each match as well as
any team I have ever had," he
said.
Gould made special mention of
No. 6 singles player Jason Yee
and doubles specialist Dan Tur
bow for filling in admirably for
the injured Jared Palmer. "We lost
a great player in Jared, but a good
team has to be able to lose a great
player and suck it up and keep
going," Gould said. "I can't say
enough about the way Dan and
Jason have stepped in and done
the job.
"And you have to remember
that, even with the injury to
Jared, we still are a very, very
good team."
Against Arizona, Stanford
jumped out to a quick start in
the singles.
At No. 1 singles, Jonathan
Stark, the No. 2-ranked player in
the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate
Rankings, came out smoking,
crushing Doug Livingston 6-2, 6-
1.
Alex O'Brien followed suit at
No. 2, surviving a second-set
comeback by Mitch Krupp to win
6-2, 7-6. "I stopped concentrating
for a brief period in the second
set, but luckily I regained it in
time to win the tiebreaker,"
O'Brien said.
At No. 3 singles, Jeff Cathrall
showed an ever-growing sense of
poise as he returned from a
second-set trouncing to down
Scott Sigerseth 7-5, 0-6, 6-2.
Solomon avenged a 1989 loss to
Jeff Spier, crushing the No. 4-
ranked Arizona player 6-4, 6-3. "I
lost my last match (to California's
Matt LucenaJ because I didn't
control the tempo," Solomon said.

"Today I made sure I dictated the
pace of the match."
Alexis Hombrecher rebounded
to down Thad Langford at No. 5
singles 5-7, 6-2, 6-4.
At No. 6 singles, Yee continued
to prove his worth, smashing
Jorge Rendon 6-1, 6-2.
In doubles, Turbow and Stark
came back from what Gould called
"an atrocious start" to beat
Livingston and Krupp 1-6, 6-1,
6-2 at No. 1 doubles.
Hombrecher and Cathrall
teamed at No. 2 to pound Todd
Morris and Spier 6-3, 6-2. At No.
3 doubles, O'Brien and Yee,
reinserted after a successful
showing in the National Team In
doors earlier this year, outlasted
Sigerseth and Rendon 3-6, 6-4,
6-3.
Barely escaping with a 5-3 win
over Arizona State last spring
break, the Stanford team took
special pride in the 6-0 thrashing
of the Sun Devils Saturday after
noon.
Stark started off the afternoon
with a 7-5, 6-2 win over Brian

Gyetko. Stark was down 3-0
before he started rolling. "When
I got down 3-0, I just thought it's
only one break. I got him back
on the next serve and, from then
on, I had a lot of confidence. I
knew I had a chance to break him
every time he served," Stark said.
At No. 2 singles, O'Brien played
a characteristically brilliant first
set and then outlasted Dave
Lomicky 6-0, 7-6.
Cathrall, in perhaps his best
match of the year, downed Brad
Williams 6-2, 6-2. Cathrall missed
only one first serve in the entire
first "Jeffs work ethic lately
has been outstanding," Goulcf
said. "His attitude is by far better
than I have ever seen it.
At No. 4 singles, Solomon kept
up his consistent piay, beating
Dan Marting 6-3, 6-3.
Hombrecher powered his way
to a 7-6, 6-4 win over Joel Fin
nigan 7-6, 6-4 at No. 5 singles.

Jason Yee's straight set victories at No. 6 singles Friday and
Saturday aided Stanford's shutout thrashings of Arizona and Arizona
State.
Arizona and Arizona State
hoped to catch a Stanford men's
tennis team in the middle of a
slump.
What they met instead was a
Cardinal team as hot as Glenn
Solomon's traditional red game
cap.

Men's Tennis

Cardinal 9, Wildcats 0

Cardinal 6, Sun Devils 0

In its two matches this week
end, the Cardinal did not give up
a single match. In fact, against
Arizona State, the No. 7-ranked
team in the country, Stanford did
not even relinquish a set.
"I think the loss to California
last Wednesday kind of woke us
up. Our pride was shot down a
little," Solomon said. "We all want
to prove that we are a great team
again. We are on a mission right
now."
Coach Dick Gould was handing
out lavish praise. "This team is
playing very well right now. We
have a loss, but this team is play
ing to their potential and improv
ing with each match as well as
any team I have ever had," he
said.
Gould made special mention of
No. 6 singles player Jason Yee
and doubles specialist Dan Tur
bow for filling in admirably for
the injured Jared Palmer. "We lost
a great player in Jared, but a good
team has to be able to lose a great
player and suck it up and keep
going," Gould said. "I can't say
enough about the way Dan and
Jason have stepped in and done
the job.
"And you have to remember
that, even with the injury to
Jared, we still are a very, very
good team."
Against Arizona, Stanford
jumped out to a quick start in
the singles.
At No. 1 singles, Jonathan
Stark, the No. 2-ranked player in
the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate
Rankings, came out smoking,
crushing Doug Livingston 6-2, 6-
1.
Alex O'Brien followed suit at
No. 2, surviving a second-set
comeback by Mitch Krupp to win
6-2, 7-6. "I stopped concentrating
for a brief period in the second
set, but luckily I regained it in
time to win the tiebreaker,"
O'Brien said.
At No. 3 singles, Jeff Cathrall
showed an ever-growing sense of
poise as he returned from a
second-set trouncing to down
Scott Sigerseth 7-5, 0-6, 6-2.
Solomon avenged a 1989 loss to
Jeff Spier, crushing the No. 4-
ranked Arizona player 6-4, 6-3. "I
lost my last match (to California's
Matt LucenaJ because I didn't
control the tempo," Solomon said.

"Today I made sure I dictated the
pace of the match."
Alexis Hombrecher rebounded
to down Thad Langford at No. 5
singles 5-7, 6-2, 6-4.
At No. 6 singles, Yee continued
to prove his worth, smashing
Jorge Rendon 6-1, 6-2.
In doubles, Turbow and Stark
came back from what Gould called
"an atrocious start" to beat
Livingston and Krupp 1-6, 6-1,
6-2 at No. 1 doubles.
Hombrecher and Cathrall
teamed at No. 2 to pound Todd
Morris and Spier 6-3, 6-2. At No.
3 doubles, O'Brien and Yee,
reinserted after a successful
showing in the National Team In
doors earlier this year, outlasted
Sigerseth and Rendon 3-6, 6-4,
6-3.
Barely escaping with a 5-3 win
over Arizona State last spring
break, the Stanford team took
special pride in the 6-0 thrashing
of the Sun Devils Saturday after
noon.
Stark started off the afternoon
with a 7-5, 6-2 win over Brian

Gyetko. Stark was down 3-0
before he started rolling. "When
I got down 3-0, I just thought it's
only one break. I got him back
on the next serve and, from then
on, I had a lot of confidence. I
knew I had a chance to break him
every time he served," Stark said.
At No. 2 singles, O'Brien played
a characteristically brilliant first
set and then outlasted Dave
Lomicky 6-0, 7-6.
Cathrall, in perhaps his best
match of the year, downed Brad
Williams 6-2, 6-2. Cathrall missed
only one first serve in the entire
first "Jeffs work ethic lately
has been outstanding," Goulcf
said. "His attitude is by far better
than I have ever seen it.
At No. 4 singles, Solomon kept
up his consistent piay, beating
Dan Marting 6-3, 6-3.
Hombrecher powered his way
to a 7-6, 6-4 win over Joel Fin
nigan 7-6, 6-4 at No. 5 singles.
Yee followed suit at No. 6, roll
ing over Greg Prudhomme 7-5,
6-0.
