With the start today of Earth Week,
Stanford environmentalists will finally
see the results of months of work on the
international Earth Day campaign —
work that has taken place here on campus
as well as at the international headquar

coalitions are planring events for Earth
Day 1990, which will be celebrated
around the world next Sunday. "College
activists could be counted on to step in
and keep the pressure on for needed
change," Earth Day 1990 Chair Denis

Hayes has written.
"Students must play a crucial role in
ensuring that society take the necessary
steps to clean up the mess we've created,"
he added.
Students throughout the nation have
demonstrated their dedication to the en
vironmental movement, and they and
Stanford students "have been great,"
Earth Day national student coordinator
Owen Byrd said.

When he is not visiting college cam
puses to build environmental coalitions,
Byrd organizes Earth Day campus events
from the Palo Alto headquarters. He said
the participation of Stanford students
who work at the headquarters office and
the 50 to 75 other Stanford students
involved in Earth Day shows that "stu
dents are more sophisticated now con
cerning the issues . . . which demon
strates the potential for a national stu

dent movement."
Senior Greg Cumberford, who co
directed last year's You Can Make A Dif
ference conference on the environment,
has directly contributed to the efforts at
Earth Day headquarters. His fact sheet
on national security and economic con
version and his handbook, "Planning and
Running Your Environmental Event: A
Student Handbook," are distrib
uted throughout the nation. He
and other members of the Stan
ford Earth Day Coalition work at
headquarters, coordinating re
gional environmental efforts.
Earth Day area coordinator Stu
Jacobson, a graduate student,
works with other schools such as
Menlo and Foothill Colleges. He
said he is confident that, "as
major forces of change," students
will become more conscious of en
vironmental problems and at
tempt to change their lifestyles.
However, he is concerned that
Earth Day will be viewed as "a
one-day party" The purpose of
Earth Day is to "foster the aware
ness in people . .. that their life
style affects the global envi
ronment. "
Sophomore Chris Cowan, vol
unteer coordinator for Earth Day
at Stanford, works at the Palo

Alto headquarters and said he also
hopes that Earth Day will not be
an end in itself but a beginning
point from which Earth Day co
ordinators and Stanford students
will strive to achieve their goals.
Robert Abrams, a senior who
has been compiling information
for a campus environmental audit,
said that as both individuals and

members of an institution,
"[students] must be aware that
they can have a significant impact
beyond the university itself."
Sophomore Scott Veirs coor
dinated Stanford Environmental
Education, through which envi
ronmental and ecological studies
are introduced to local public
schools. While pursuing an

individually-designed environ
mental studies major, he has
contributed to recycling projects.
"It's a phenomenal feeling [to
be] a week from Earth Day," Veirs
said. "If we keep working on [in
ducing environmental awareness],
it will happen. Earth Day is a real
beginning."
Freshman Tim Choi, publicity

coordinator for Earth Day at
Stanford, said before he came to
Stanford he "never had a place
to focus" his environmental con
cern. The environmental educa
tion program will "help people
measure their actions and ask, 'Is
it safe for the earth?' "
Some goals of Earth Day in
clude:

• To foster improved environ
mental behavior in the way indi
viduals conduct their lives,
• To encourage environmental
activism at the individual level,
• To increase awareness of en
vironmental issues and
• To strive for an environmen
tally sustainable future.
