# Buchanan appeals his firing
## O&M director goes to Kennedy seeking reinstatement 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Recently fired Operations and
Maintenance Director Ralph Bu
chanan is attempting to retain his
job by appealing to University
President Donald Kennedy.
Buchanan asked Kennedy to
conduct an "administrative
review" of his situation. Bu
chanan said the review is a direct
appeal for Kennedy to examine
his case and make a final decision
on Buchanan's job.
Buchanan met with Kennedy
last week for 50 minutes. "It
wasn't actually a dialogue," Bu
chanan said. "It was basically me
trying to explain my position."
The discussion was not concluded
and will continue this Thursday.
"In the meantime, Ralph's
status is that his employment at
Stanford continues; the matter of
his administrative responsibilities
is, of course, up to his super
visors," Kennedy said in a state
ment last Wednesday.
Buchanan has been relieved of
all responsibilities by his supervi

sor, Vice President for Adminis
trative Resources Su Schaffer.
SchafTer declined to comment on
Buchanan's position.
Members of the United Stan
ford Workers union met with
SchafTer last Thursday to discuss
the situation. Last Tuesday, about
40 USW workers marched on
Schaffer's office and to the meet
ing place of the Board of Trustees,
calling for Buchanan to be
reinstated and for Schaffer to be
fired.
USW field representative Rod
ney Barnette said, "Union repre
sentatives from O&M complained
about several things. Number one
is that Buchanan's firing goes
against [Schaffer'sl own promise
to let people know what's going
on.
The union officials told Bar
nette that SchafTer "insisted that
[Buchanan] is fired and he re
mains fired, and she didn't want
it to get out of hand," Barnette
said.
Barnette added that the larger
issue for union workers, besides
loyalty to Buchanan, is how the

new director will affect their abil
ity to negotiate with management.
Buchanan was a good leader and
was open to workers' concerns,
Barnette said. Workers feel Schaf
fer lacks the same rapport.
They are concerned that their
voices will not be heard after Bu
chanan leaves and are worried
about their job security during
the upcoming budget cuts.
SchafTer said she intends to get
worker input and assured that the
workers will be heard.
She said 150 to 200 workers
campuswide could lose their pres
ent positions due to the budget
cuts. Unless some other Univer
sity jobs are found for these
workers, they will have to be laid
off, SchafTer said.
"The big fear among workers
is that we will shut down O&M
altogether, and I'm surprised by
that kind of comment. It's so far
removed from what we're trying
to do," SchafTer said.
Workers also fear that their jobs
will be contracted to outside
firms.
