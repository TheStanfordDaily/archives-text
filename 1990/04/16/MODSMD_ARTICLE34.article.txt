ASSU to be revamped
The ASSU is about to be reorganized, but
no one is yet sure exactly how.
In a statement released Friday, the Coun
cil of Presidents called for the formation of
an "Action Plan for Change" committee to
design a plan to revamp the ASSU's struc
ture, issuing a report in six months.
Although the statement set no specific
goals, it called for increased efficiency, com
munication and accountability, while
preserving the ASSU's "open and democratic
. . . character."
According to the statement, the plans for
reorganization are, in part, the result of the
"strain of a rapidly changing ASSU . .. com
bined with the historical inefficiencies of
ASSU bureaucracy."
The statement also says the ASSU should
try to "channel student input into key areas"
during the University's repositioning.
Since various schools and deans may be
given more autonomy over their depart
ments, the ASSU might try to work more
closely with individual departments and
restructure the committee system.
COP member David Brown said the Action
Plan for Change is a way to "best organize
the ASSU to facilitate the most input and
involvement of students, in conjunction with
us having to cut and streamline."
Brown cited as an example the Office of
Public Affairs, which at present is separate
from the administrative manager. By com
bining the two into one, Brown said the

ASSU hopes to "save money, make it more
streamlined and more efficient."
Brown also said he saw a need for a
greater cohesion in the ASSU. "It's not as
integrated as it should be," he said.
Brown said he thinks that by coalescing
each part of the ASSU into an better
communicating unit, it would be "a lot more
effective" in servicing student needs.
The statement calls for the formation of
a committee with membership drawn from
University officials, students and an outside
auditor. The committee's organizational
meeting will be on April 24.

Webb workers will not strike
Webb Ranch workers are not planning to
strike as the United Stanford Workers had
threatened last week, according to USW field
representative Rodney Barnette.
Barnette said that "nothing is happening"
with the strike, which had been threatened
late last week. He said the union and the
workers had been worried last week because
of miscommunication with Webb family
lawyer Terrence O'Connor.
Although O'Connor could not be reached
over the weekend for comment, he said Fri
day that he was not aware of any problem
with the workers or the contract. O'Connor
said he sent the last draft of the contract
to the Webbs and that he "doesn't anticipate
any problem with it."

$45,000 in computers stolen
In a $45,000 haul, thieves carried away
three Next computers from a Music Annex
trailer last week.
The break-in at the temporary location
of the Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics, a trailer behind the
Knoll, was discovered Friday morning. The
one unbarred window in the trailer had been
broken, and three of the four $15,000 Next
computers inside had been taken.
The computers were insured and security
will be increased, officials said, but most of
the concern centered around lost research.
"(The thieves] don't realize that they're
hurting students and their work. This really
impedes graduate student research," said
Patte Wood, the administrative director of
the computer music center.
Glen Diener, a graduate student in music,
suffered the most substantial losses from
the theft, according to the center's director,
John Chowning.
"I've lost most of my dissertation. They
stole both my backups, and all the writing
[for the dissertation] is gone," said Diener.
Diener hopes to salvage information from
a disk that had crashed before the theft.
Dave Mellinger, a graduate student in com
puter science who also did research at the
center, made a backup of all his research
the day before the theft. His backup disks
were not stolen.
