# COP possibilities: Profiles of those looking to lead
## The 						people behind the platform 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
With the election scene
heating up, it becomes very easy
to lose sight of the personalities
and qualifications of individual
candidates in the sea of cam
paign fliers and political slogans
that have engulfed the campus.
However, behind the current
power plays in the race for the
COP lie students with a concern
for student interests and with
diverse backgrounds that have

shaped their political views in
distinctive ways.
Four such students are Jamie
Green, Goodwin Liu, Ingrid
Nava and Jay Tucker, who make
up this year's People's Platform
COP slate, "Four Our Future."
Although the People's Platform
is often associated with issues of
multiculturalism, members of
this year's slate want to make it
clear that this is only one in a
myriad of concerns which they
hope to address.
The slate has taken on Uni

versity President Donald Ken
nedy's challenge to form a
"compelling and persuasive"
view of Stanford's future
through an increased commit
ment to efficiency, public service,
women's issues and graduate
student concerns.
Although the goals of inclu
sion, unity and multiculturalism
are admirable, they often serve
only as safe and hazy abstrac
tions. The members of this year's

Left to right, Jay Tucker, Jamie Green, Goodwin Liu and Ingrid Nava are trying to become the
third People's Platform slate in three years to win the COP election.
People's Platform COP slate feel
that one of the best ways to make
their commitment more concrete
is to focus more on the individual
backgrounds of each slate mem
ber.

Senior Jamie Green's commit
ment to student involvement and
interaction reaches back to her
freshman year, when she was one
of a few white students to audition
for Stanfunk, a program dealing
with black performing arts.
"It was one of those situations
where I felt uncomfortable
auditioning, but I got a lot out of
it once I got involved," said Green.
"Soul music and African dancing
are two of my favorite things, and
I want more people to be able to
enjoy the things that other cul
tures offer."
Her involvement with the ASSU
Committee on Democracy in Ed
ucation has served to expand her
interest in and knowledge of mul
ticulturalism. "CODE dealt with
big issues like how to deal with
racism and how we can address
racial issues through the educa
tional process," she said. "The
current COP has set up a lot of
mechanisms to further these
goals, and I think one of our big
jobs for next year will be to fine
tune them."
Although the student of color
groups have gone a long way
toward integrating diverse ele
ments of the University commu
nity, Green feels that these groups
alone cannot achieve the goal of
true multiculturalism. "I think
it's good that neither Goodwin
(Liu) nor I comes directly from a
student of color organization,"
Green said.
Broad backgrounds and a
responsiveness to student con
cerns are the most important
aspects of this year's People's
Platform slate, according to
Green. "We're obviously commit
ted to the general philosophy of
the People's Platform, but our
greatest strength is the outstand

ing experience of our slate," she
said.

The experience of the slate also
shows in the activities and
achievements of junior Goodwin
Liu. Public service and volun
teerism are two of his greatest
concerns.
In his sophomore year, Liu
served as editor of the Public
Service Center's newsletter. "I was
basically a one-man staff," Liu
said. "My involvement with the
center has given me the nuts and
bolts concerning service opportu
nities and has also provided me
insight into many channels that
I can use to get things done."
Another benefit of his involve
ment there was the nomination
he received from Catherine Mil
ton, the director of the center, to
be one of the co-directors for this
year's You Can Make a Difference
Conference on education.
"I've always been interested in
issues of public service and edu
cation, and I think Catherine saw
that in her suggesting for me to
take an active role in the confer
ence," said Liu. "The conference
provided invaluable leadership ex
perience and helped to teach me
exactly what inclusiveness
means."
Liu's biggest goal as a member
of the COP is to increase outreach
and interaction among students.
"With the budget cutbacks
looming ahead of us, it's going to
be more and more important for
us to rely upon networking,
cooperation and volunteerism," he
said.

The "Four Our Future" slate
expects these goals to be furthered
by the experience that current
COP member Ingrid Nava, a
senior, brings to the slate. "My
interest in student government
began with my involvement in
CODE and as a tutor in East Palo
Alto," said Nava.
Nava said one of her greatest
contributions to her slate is the
know-how and administrative
abilities she has gained by being
on the COP this year. "The ins
and outs of the ASSU are a lot

more complicated than people
might expect, and it's very nice
to have a working familiarity with
them," she said.
Nava believes the accomplish
ments of the present COP are
some of the greatest reasons to
vote for another People's Platform
slate. "An unprecedented amount
of student participation and in
volvement has taken place in the
last year," she said. According to
Nava, many of the initiatives of
the present COP will be improved
upon and expanded by this year's
slate.
"Everything that we do must
have student involvement as its
underlying motivation," said
Nava. One of the ways she hopes
to achieve this involvement is to
forge a stronger bond between
student government and the stu
dent of color organizations.

Junior Jay Tucker provides the
final link in this year's People's
Platform COP slate. His mana
gerial skills have been challenged
by his strong involvement with
KZSU. "I've had a big role there

with DJ train
ing, program
mi n g and
organization,"
said Tucker.
The skills he
gained at the
station have
helped him in
the implemen
tation of other
projects.
Project De
mocracy II
was Tucker's
brainchild.

The project entailed sending
several Stanford students to
Selma, Ala., to participate in a
commemorative civil rights
march. Tucker was instrumental
in raising the funds, setting the
budget and overseeing the admin
istration of the project.
Setting up a network for inter
action is Tucker's primary goal
as a COP member. "We need to
bring groups together instead of
just watching them pursue iso
lated existences," said Tucker.
