# Looking to wipe the slate clean
## 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
The ASSU has been described
as the University's "largest un
tapped resource" by the Students
First COP slate.
Students First hopes to in
crease representation, involve
ment and accountability in
student government by making
the ASSU a more effective bridge
between student groups and the
University.
Although the genesis of the

Students First party was rooted
in a dedication to student serv
ices, this year's slate has made
it clear that involvement, multi
culturalism and efficiency are
equally important goals.
"A Clean Slate" is comprised
of Lora Abe, Michael Canul, Tim
Marklein and Cecilia Tom. Al
though their party's experience
in the ASSU is limited, members
of the slate feel their back
grounds in a wide array of
campus activities make them
responsive to student needs.

The Students First slate has
adopted a campaign strategy
based upon "process and prog
ress." By process, it means to
utilize existing channels to
bridge the gap between Univer
sity and students; by progress,
it means to expand the services
offered to students.
Through their diverse back
grounds, the slate members hope
to capitalize upon the connec
tions they have already made to

better facilitate a plan of action
that is responsive to student
needs.

Junior Lora Abe has been in
volved with X-TV as well as the
Association of Students in Eco
nomics and Business Manage
ment. Her primary goal is to
increase the number of voting stu
dent representatives on Univer
sity decision-making bodies.
Virtually every University com
mittee has at least one spot
reserved for students. The stu
dents who sit on these committees
are chosen through a selection
process run by the ASSU. Abe
contends that almost half of the
100 spots reserved for students
this year were not immediately
filled due to mismanagement by
the ASSU.
"Student positions on Univer
sity committees are too important
to be overlooked or mismanaged,"

Abe said. "Not
only should
we actively
promote the
spots that al
ready exist, we
should try to
expand upon
and improve
the program."
In addition,
Abe said, "In
providing stu
dent services,
we shouldn't
promote an

antagonistic and adversarial
relationship between students and
the administration."
She believes that more dorm
polls and surveys should be con
ducted in order to better deter
mine the interests of students at
large. Moreover, she thinks the
ASSU should produce more in
formational campaigns to better
inform and involve students.
"The student of color organiza
tions have gone a long way toward
including students in the overall
University community, but they

are by no means completely rep
resentative of minority groups,"
Abe said. She advocates a more
decentralized organization of stu -
dent groups in order to intercon
nect them all.

Junior Michael Canul has
served as a coordinator for a La
tino pre-law society and the Stan
ford Latino Student Alliance. He
largely agrees with Abe on the
issue of student of color groups.
"We have to make sure that we
don't inadvertently promote
polarization between campus
groups," he said.
Canul believes that many
campus groups are not as repre
sentative as they could be.
"MEChA only involves about 20
percent of the Chicano communi
ty," said Canul. He thinks the
ASSU needs to work with inde
pendent groups as well as the or
ganized students of color to create
a truly receptive and open com
munity.
Canul, a staff member of the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues, believes that the com
mittee has taken only preliminary
steps toward furthering its goals.
"We want to create a more real
sense of multiculturalism," he
said.
Canul's personal project is to
improve the quality of academic
discussion sections by instituting
a formalized teaching assistant
training program. "Sections are
by no means all that they can
be," said Canul. He proposes to
create a formal evaluation process
for teaching assistants as well as
an institutional process that could
better evaluate the ways in which
TAs are used.
He suggests a pilot program to
test the possibilities of expanding
and improving the roles of TAs.
Considering the University
budget cutbacks, Canul believes
that a limited test program will
not be a significant drain on Uni
versity funding.

The issue of budget cuts is also
of great importance to junior Tim
Marklein. Marklein has served as
editor in chief of The Daily and

as treasurer of the Sigma Nu fra
ternity. With such background, he
considers his greatest contribu
tion to the Students First slate
to be his managerial skills and
administrative know-how.
"A lot of the cuts needed in the
ASSU can be made without sig
nificantly affecting student serv
ices," Marklein said. He believes
that very little progress has been
made by the current COP in the
area of creating a workable rela
tionship between students and the
University.
"Ever since the takeover [of the
president's office] last spring, a
lot of University officials have felt
stabbed in the back by student
government," he said. "We want
to avoid the us-them mentality
and get on to forging stronger
links between different aspects of
the community."
Proposed cuts in Residential
Education are one of Marklein's
biggest concerns. "The COP needs
to be a watchdog for the Univer
sity," said Marklein. He believes
that with an understanding of
what student interests and
priorities truly are, it will be pos
sible for the ASSU to better deal
with the changes that are taking
place because of current budget
cuts.

The fourth member of the Stu
dents First COP slate is freshman
Cecilia Tom. She is an ASSU sen
ate associate and is anxious to
become more involved in the
decision-making process.
Although it is rather unusual
for a freshman to be on a COP
slate, Tom believes that student
government should not simply be
relegated to upperclassmen. "I
came into the ASSU as a fresh
man with a lot of enthusiasm, and
I expect to maintain it next year,"
she said.
She added that experience in
government is not as important
as an awareness of the issues.
Tom's personal project for the
ASSU is creating an entertain
ment shuttle. She believes that
such a service will significantly
curb incidents of drunk driving
as well as lessen parking prob
lems.

of great importance to junior Tim
Marklein. Marklein has served as
editor in chief of The Daily and

as treasurer of the Sigma Nu fra
ternity. With such background, he
considers his greatest contribu
tion to the Students First slate
to be his managerial skills and
administrative know-how.
"A lot of the cuts needed in the
ASSU can be made without sig
nificantly affecting student serv
ices," Marklein said. He believes
that very little progress has been
made by the current COP in the
area of creating a workable rela
tionship between students and the
University.
"Ever since the takeover [of the
president's office] last spring, a
lot of University officials have felt
stabbed in the back by student
government," he said. "We want
to avoid the us-them mentality
and get on to forging stronger
links between different aspects of
the community."
Proposed cuts in Residential
Education are one of Marklein's
biggest concerns. "The COP needs
to be a watchdog for the Univer
sity," said Marklein. He believes
that with an understanding of
what student interests and
priorities truly are, it will be pos
sible for the ASSU to better deal
with the changes that are taking
place because of current budget
cuts.

The fourth member of the Stu
dents First COP slate is freshman
Cecilia Tom. She is an ASSU sen
ate associate and is anxious to
become more involved in the
decision-making process.
Although it is rather unusual
for a freshman to be on a COP
slate, Tom believes that student
government should not simply be
relegated to upperclassmen. "I
came into the ASSU as a fresh
man with a lot of enthusiasm, and
I expect to maintain it next year,"
she said.
She added that experience in
government is not as important
as an awareness of the issues.
Tom's personal project for the
ASSU is creating an entertain
ment shuttle. She believes that
such a service will significantly
curb incidents of drunk driving
as well as lessen parking prob
lems.
The ASSU has been described
as the University's "largest un
tapped resource" by the Students
First COP slate.
Students First hopes to in
crease representation, involve
ment and accountability in
student government by making
the ASSU a more effective bridge
between student groups and the
University.
Although the genesis of the

Students First party was rooted
in a dedication to student serv
ices, this year's slate has made
it clear that involvement, multi
culturalism and efficiency are
equally important goals.
"A Clean Slate" is comprised
of Lora Abe, Michael Canul, Tim
Marklein and Cecilia Tom. Al
though their party's experience
in the ASSU is limited, members
of the slate feel their back
grounds in a wide array of
campus activities make them
responsive to student needs.

The Students First slate has
adopted a campaign strategy
based upon "process and prog
ress." By process, it means to
utilize existing channels to
bridge the gap between Univer
sity and students; by progress,
it means to expand the services
offered to students.
Through their diverse back
grounds, the slate members hope
to capitalize upon the connec
tions they have already made to

better facilitate a plan of action
that is responsive to student

Junior Lora Abe has been in
volved with X-TV as well as the
Association of Students in Eco
nomics and Business Manage
ment. Her primary goal is to
increase the number of voting stu
dent representatives on Univer
sity decision-making bodies.
Virtually every University com
mittee has at least one spot
reserved for students. The stu
dents who sit on these committees
are chosen through a selection
process run by the ASSU. Abe
contends that almost half of the
100 spots reserved for students
this year were not immediately
filled due to mismanagement by
the ASSU.
"Student positions on Univer
sity committees are too important
to be overlooked or mismanaged,"

Abe said. "Not
only should
we actively
promote the
spots that al
ready exist, we
should try to
expand upon
and improve
the program."
In addition,
Abe said, "In
providing stu
dent services,
we shouldn't
promote an

antagonistic and adversarial
relationship between students and
the administration."
She believes that more dorm
polls and surveys should be con
ducted in order to better deter
mine the interests of students at
large. Moreover, she thinks the
ASSU should produce more in
formational campaigns to better
inform and involve students.
"The student of color organiza
tions have gone a long way toward
including students in the overall
University community, but they

are by no means completely rep
resentative of minority groups,"
Abe said. She advocates a more
decentralized organization of stu -
dent groups in order to intercon
nect them all.
000
Junior Michael Canul has
served as a coordinator for a La
tino pre-law society and the Stan
ford Latino Student Alliance. He
largely agrees with Abe on the
issue of student of color groups.
"We have to make sure that we
don't inadvertently promote
polarization between campus
groups," he said.
Canul believes that many
campus groups are not as repre
sentative as they could be.
"MEChA only involves about 20
percent of the Chicano communi
ty," said Canul. He thinks the
ASSU needs to work with inde
pendent groups as well as the or
ganized students of color to create
a truly receptive and open com
munity.
Canul, a staff member of the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues, believes that the com
mittee has taken only preliminary
steps toward furthering its goals.
"We want to create a more real
sense of multiculturalism," he
said.
Canul's personal project is to
improve the quality of academic
discussion sections by instituting
a formalized teaching assistant
training program. "Sections are
by no means all that they can
be," said Canul. He proposes to
create a formal evaluation process
for teaching assistants as well as
an institutional process that could
better evaluate the ways in which
TAs are used.
He suggests a pilot program to
test the possibilities of expanding
and improving the roles of TAs.
Considering the University
budget cutbacks, Canul believes
that a limited test program will
not be a significant drain on Uni
versity funding.
