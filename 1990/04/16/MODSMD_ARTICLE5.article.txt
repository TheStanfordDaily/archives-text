# Looking to wipe the slate clean

The ASSU has been described
as the University's "largest un
tapped resource" by the Students
First COP slate.
Students First hopes to in
crease representation, involve
ment and accountability in
student government by making
the ASSU a more effective bridge
between student groups and the
University.
Although the genesis of the

Students First party was rooted
in a dedication to student serv
ices, this year's slate has made
it clear that involvement, multi
culturalism and efficiency are
equally important goals.
"A Clean Slate" is comprised
of Lora Abe, Michael Canul, Tim
Marklein and Cecilia Tom. Al
though their party's experience
in the ASSU is limited, members
of the slate feel their back
grounds in a wide array of
campus activities make them
responsive to student needs.

The Students First slate has
adopted a campaign strategy
based upon "process and prog
ress." By process, it means to
utilize existing channels to
bridge the gap between Univer
sity and students; by progress,
it means to expand the services
offered to students.
Through their diverse back
grounds, the slate members hope
to capitalize upon the connec
tions they have already made to
