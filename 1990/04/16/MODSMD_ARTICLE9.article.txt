# Lithuania defies Gorbachev ultimatum
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Lithuanian
leaders yesterday ignored a Kremlin
deadline to rescind laws promoting in
dependence despite Moscow's threat to
cut off key supplies to the Baltic re
public.
The republic's deputy prime minis
ter, Romualdas Ozolas, went on Lith
uanian TV as the 48-hour deadline set
by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
expired. He said Lithuania's president
and prime minister would meet today
to discuss Moscow's ultimatum.
Ozolas also said the neighboring re
public of Estonia would appoint an
ambassador to Lithuania today, and
Lithuania would reciprocate, according
to Aidas Palubinskas of the Lithuanian
parliament's information office.
Gorbachev sent a letter Friday to
Lithuania's leaders, demanding that
they rescind indpendence-oriented ac
tions that he termed "anti
constitutional," including laws on can
celing conscription into the Soviet
army and seizing Communist Party
property.
He threatened to cut off products
the Soviet Union sells abroad for hard
currency if the republic's leaders failed
to act by last night.
In Washington yesterday, Senate
leaders of both parties warned Gorba
chev that carrying out his threatened
economic blockade could derail
opening trade relations between the
United States and Moscow.
Palubinskas quoted Ozolas as ac
knowledging that Lithuania's factories
would be able to function for only
about two weeks if Moscow imposed
an economic blockade. But he added
that the Soviet Union has never been
able to brag about swift implementa
tion of its economic decisions.
The deputy prime minister also
wished Lithuanians a happy Easter,
Palubinskas said, and advised them to
rest up, "because this week doesn't
promise to be any less hectic — but
by next weekend we'll be happy by
what we've accomplished."
Ozolas also said that before Gorba
chev's ultimatum, the United States
had been reluctant to speak out for
Lithuania, but that afterward, Presi
dent George Bush had came out a little

more in the republic's favor, according
to Palubinskas.
Gorbachev's tone had softened in his
latest ultimatum, the spokesman
quoted Ozolas as saying, because his
demand that Lithuania rescind its dec
laration of independence seemed to be
shoved aside — leaving room for more
practical discussions.
Earlier in the day, the leader of Lit
huania's Roman Catholics told wor
shipers in Vilnius to keep a "cool head"
but stand tough, a resident said.
Speaking at an Easter Mass with
Lithuania's president sitting in the
front pew, Cardinal Vincentas Skad
kevicius urged the population of the
Baltic republic to stay calm, said
Eduardas Potashinskas of Lithuanian
TV.
Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis said Saturday that no ac
tion — presumably by the republic's
whole parliament — was planned
before Tuesday, well after Gorbachev's
deadline expired. Lithuania is predom
inantly Roman Catholic, and most res
idents planned a three-day weekend to
celebrate the Easter holiday with
friends and family.
Pope John Paul II prayed for the
Baltic republic yesterday in his annual
Easter message in Rome, calling "for
peace for our children in the dear Lith
uanian nation, while we hope that
their aspirations find confirmation in
a respectful and comprehensive
dialogue."
In Washington, Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
said retaliation by Moscow against Lit
huania would jeopardize a trade agree
ment President Bush and Gorbachev
hoped to sign at a summit in June.
The Bush administration was taking
what Secretary of State James Baker
111 described as a "wait and see" at
titude as the Kremlin-imposed dead
line passed yesterday.
Lithuanian officials have acknowl
edged that a blockade of materials such
as oil and gas could cause mass layoffs
in the republic of 3.8 million people
but said they hoped sympathetic Soviet
republics would not cut off crucial sup
plies.
