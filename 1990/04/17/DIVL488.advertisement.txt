HEALTHNOTES
MEASLES
April 1990
The measles epidemics that have been occunng
throughout the country have now reached the Bay
Area. A significant number of cases have been
reported in the East Bay and in San Francisco, and
there now has been the first reported case on the
Stanford campus, in a child in Escondido Village.
Since 1983, all Stanford students bom after 1957 have
been required to show proof of immunity against
measles as one of the entrance medical requirements;
up until last year, a pnor history of vaccination has
been sufficient. Tins year, with the upsurge of cases,
even in some who had previously been vaccinated, a
second vaccination has been recommended for all
under 33 years old who have not been vaccinated
since 1979.
With the current epidemic, this revaccination is
again strongly recommended. The vaccine is
available for students and spouses at Cowell for $25.
No appointment is needed.
Those dependents who have never been vaccinated
at all are particularly at risk. Vaccine is available for
children at Cowell by appointment (725-1374). In
addition to being available at Cowell, the vaccine is
also available for adults and children for $3 at the
Santa Clara County clinic in San Jose (408/299-6850).
Starting in the fall, all incoming students will be
required to have been vaccinated since 1979.
