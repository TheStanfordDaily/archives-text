# Budget cuts will leave at least 150 without jobs

### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
An estimated 150 to 200 Stanford em
ployees will lose their jobs to the Uni
versity's repositioning efforts, and those
who do not find other jobs in the Uni
versity may be laid off as soon as Sept.
1, Provost James Rosse announced yes
terday.
In a letter to faculty and staff, Rosse
also announced the final budget reduc
tion targets for University units,
four of which had their targets reduced
from preliminary estimates.
Student Affairs and Residential Affairs
both had their initial reduction targets
of 20 percent reduced to 15 percent. Uni
versity Libraries was granted a 4 percent
decrease, from 20 to 16 percent, and the
target for the School of Humanities and
Sciences was reduced from 6 to 4 percent.
"I can't say I'm satisfied or pleased
with that degree of reduction," said David

Weber, director of University Libraries.
"We're working on how we can make
that figure without it harming services
to faculty and students. It's going to be
tough."
The cuts are part of the University's
massive effort to slash $22 million from
its operating budget in the next 16
months and restructure its administra
tive bureaucracy to make it more effi
cient.
Rosse, chair of the Repositioning Steer
ing Committee, said the committee es
timates that 300 to 400 staff positions
across the University will need to be
"phased out" by September 1991. At least
one-half of those will be eliminated
through normal staff turnover, leaving
the 150 to 200 positions from which em
ployees will be displaced.
Stanford currently has 6,415 employ
ees, excluding those at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
Rosse said the University will do all it

can to place displaced employees in other
campus jobs.
"Layoffs will be used only where nec
essary. .. . Unfortunately, some displaced
staff members won't be able to find an
open job elsewhere on campus, either
because a job suitable for them doesn't
exist or a vacancy doesn't occur at the
right time," Rosse said.
To give current employees an advan
tage in finding campus jobs, Rosse an
nounced a University-wide hiring freeze,
effective immediately, under which only
highly critical positions will be filled with
personnel from outside the University.
Such hires will be directly approved by
a dean or vice president, Rosse said.
Rosse is overseeing development of a
University in-placement system that will
attempt to match displaced employees
with campus job openings. The service
will be in operation by June 1.
