# Budget cuts will leave at least 150 without jobs
## 
### Brad Hayward Editorial staff 
An estimated 150 to 200 Stanford em
ployees will lose their jobs to the Uni
versity's repositioning efforts, and those
who do not find other jobs in the Uni
versity may be laid off as soon as Sept.
1, Provost James Rosse announced yes
terday.
In a letter to faculty and staff, Rosse
also announced the final budget reduc
tion targets for University units,
four of which had their targets reduced
from preliminary estimates.
Student Affairs and Residential Affairs
both had their initial reduction targets
of 20 percent reduced to 15 percent. Uni
versity Libraries was granted a 4 percent
decrease, from 20 to 16 percent, and the
target for the School of Humanities and
Sciences was reduced from 6 to 4 percent.
"I can't say I'm satisfied or pleased
with that degree of reduction," said David

Weber, director of University Libraries.
"We're working on how we can make
that figure without it harming services
to faculty and students. It's going to be
tough."
The cuts are part of the University's
massive effort to slash $22 million from
its operating budget in the next 16
months and restructure its administra
tive bureaucracy to make it more effi
cient.
Rosse, chair of the Repositioning Steer
ing Committee, said the committee es
timates that 300 to 400 staff positions
across the University will need to be
"phased out" by September 1991. At least
one-half of those will be eliminated
through normal staff turnover, leaving
the 150 to 200 positions from which em
ployees will be displaced.
Stanford currently has 6,415 employ
ees, excluding those at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
Rosse said the University will do all it

can to place displaced employees in other
campus jobs.
"Layoffs will be used only where nec
essary. .. . Unfortunately, some displaced
staff members won't be able to find an
open job elsewhere on campus, either
because a job suitable for them doesn't
exist or a vacancy doesn't occur at the
right time," Rosse said.
To give current employees an advan
tage in finding campus jobs, Rosse an
nounced a University-wide hiring freeze,
effective immediately, under which only
highly critical positions will be filled with
personnel from outside the University.
Such hires will be directly approved by
a dean or vice president, Rosse said.
Rosse is overseeing development of a
University in-placement system that will
attempt to match displaced employees
with campus job openings. The service
will be in operation by June 1.
The committee decided not to
offer special programs for early
retirement and early leave be
cause, according to Rosse, "These
programs have the potential to
encourage large numbers of em
ployees to leave, often those indi
viduals with long experience and
those with highly marketable
skills. It would be counter
productive for Stanford to lose too
many people."
Job displacement notices will
start coming down in mid-June
and will likely continue sporadi
cally until September 1991. The
first layoffs will take effect Sept.
1 of this year, and employees will
be given at least 30 days notice
before being laid off.
Though the budget-cutting
process will abide by the Univer
sity's affirmative action policies,
Stanford's broader goal of creat
ing a pluralistic community may
be temporarily set on the back
burner, Rosse's statement said.
"When Stanford finishes with
this repositioning process, we will
be able to return our full attention

to our goals for affirmative action
and pluralism as contained in the
[University Committee on Minor
ity Issues] Report," Rosse said.
The preliminary budget targets
were delivered to University
deans and vice presidents March
26. In the weeks since, they have
examined their operations to see
what effects the preliminary tar
gets would have and reported
their findings back to Rosse and
the committee. The committee
took those findings into account
when determining the final tar
gets, Rosse said.
The deans and vice presidents
have created task forces to
develop recommendations to meet
the final targets, and those rec
ommendations are due to the com
mittee May 18. Committee mem
bers and University President
Donald Kennedy will review the
recommendations to assess the
impact of the cuts across the Uni
versity. Final reduction recom
mendations will be announced in
mid-June.
Department heads of units that
received reduced targets were glad
to get a little breathing room but
emphasized the difficulty of the
budget-cutting task still facing
them.

Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he is "slightly relieved
at the reduction, but there is no
joy in a 15 percent cut."
Lyons said he is determined
that the budget process be very
open. "We want student input,"
he said.
Humanities and Sciences
finance director Nancy Padgett
said the school's reduction target
was reduced because a survey of
its departments revealed that "we
could not meet the original target
without doing some serious aca
demic damage to undergraduate
and graduate programs."
The only area to be assigned
an increased reduction target was
Rosse's own unit — the Office of
the President and Provost. The
office's initial reduction was in
the 10 to 17 percent range; its
final target is 20 percent.
While the repositioning effort
moves forward, members of the
steering committee are concerned
that department officials do not
forget that the effort has as much
to do with rethinking the way the
University does business as with
cutting budgets by specific
amounts.
"The budget cutting is essential

and important," said Ray Bacchet
ti, director of the Office of Plan
ning and Management and a
member of the committee.
"Budget cutting is on most
people's minds because it's right
there — it hurts. But what is
important is to focus on how Stan
ford can do what it does better."
"We want to get people off the
notion of, 'I need to come up with
a list of things to cut' and onto
the notion of, 'What is my busi
ness and how can I best do it?' "
added committee member Su
Schaffer, vice president for admin
istrative resources.
Rosse and his colleagues are es
pecially concerned that some de
partments are moving too fast —
deciding on budget cuts too
quickly — before assessing the
long-term effects on how those
departments perform their func
tions.
In some units, Schaffer said,
"It's coming too clear too quickly.
We have to ask, have they been
really thoughtful about how
they're doing work? Or are they
doing the first thing that came
to mind?"

bers and University President
Donald Kennedy will review the
recommendations to assess the
impact of the cuts across the Uni
versity. Final reduction recom
mendations will be announced in
mid-June.
Department heads of units that
received reduced targets were glad
to get a little breathing room but
emphasized the difficulty of the
budget-cutting task still facing
them.

Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he is "slightly relieved
at the reduction, but there is no
joy in a 15 percent cut."
Lyons said he is determined
that the budget process be very
open. "We want student input,"
he said.
Humanities and Sciences
finance director Nancy Padgett
said the school's reduction target
was reduced because a survey of
its departments revealed that "we
could not meet the original target
without doing some serious aca
demic damage to undergraduate
and graduate programs."
The only area to be assigned
an increased reduction target was
Rosse's own unit — the Office of
the President and Provost. The
office's initial reduction was in
the 10 to 17 percent range; its
final target is 20 percent.
While the repositioning effort
moves forward, members of the
steering committee are concerned
that department officials do not
forget that the effort has as much
to do with rethinking the way the
University does business as with
cutting budgets by specific
amounts.
"The budget cutting is essential

and important," said Ray Bacchet
ti, director of the Office of Plan
ning and Management and a
member of the committee.
"Budget cutting is on most
people's minds because it's right
there — it hurts. But what is
important is to focus on how Stan
ford can do what it does better."
"We want to get people off the
notion of, 'I need to come up with
a list of things to cut' and onto
the notion of, 'What is my busi
ness and how can I best do it?' "
added committee member Su
Schaffer, vice president for admin
istrative resources.
Rosse and his colleagues are es
pecially concerned that some de
partments are moving too fast —
deciding on budget cuts too
quickly — before assessing the
long-term effects on how those
departments perform their func
tions.
In some units, Schaffer said,
"It's coming too clear too quickly.
We have to ask, have they been
really thoughtful about how
they're doing work? Or are they
doing the first thing that came
to mind?"

An estimated 150 to 200 Stanford em
ployees will lose their jobs to the Uni
versity's repositioning efforts, and those
who do not find other jobs in the Uni
versity may be laid off as soon as Sept.
1, Provost James Rosse announced yes
terday.
In a letter to faculty and staff, Rosse
also announced the final budget reduc
tion targets for University units,
four of which had their targets reduced
from preliminary estimates.
Student Affairs and Residential Affairs
both had their initial reduction targets
of 20 percent reduced to 15 percent. Uni
versity Libraries was granted a 4 percent
decrease, from 20 to 16 percent, and the
target for the School of Humanities and
Sciences was reduced from 6 to 4 percent.
"I can't say I'm satisfied or pleased
with that degree of reduction," said David

Weber, director of University Libraries.
"We're working on how we can make
that figure without it harming services
to faculty and students. It's going to be
tough."
The cuts are part of the University's
massive effort to slash $22 million from
its operating budget in the next 16
months and restructure its administra
tive bureaucracy to make it more effi
cient.
Rosse, chair of the Repositioning Steer
ing Committee, said the committee es
timates that 300 to 400 staff positions
across the University will need to be
"phased out" by September 1991. At least
one-half of those will be eliminated
through normal staff turnover, leaving
the 150 to 200 positions from which em
ployees will be displaced.
Stanford currently has 6,415 employ
ees, excluding those at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
Rosse said the University will do all it

can to place displaced employees in other
campus jobs.
"Layoffs will be used only where nec
essary. .. . Unfortunately, some displaced
staff members won't be able to find an
open job elsewhere on campus, either
because a job suitable for them doesn't
exist or a vacancy doesn't occur at the
right time," Rosse said.
To give current employees an advan
tage in finding campus jobs, Rosse an
nounced a University-wide hiring freeze,
effective immediately, under which only
highly critical positions will be filled with
personnel from outside the University.
Such hires will be directly approved by
a dean or vice president, Rosse said.
Rosse is overseeing development of a
University in-placement system that will
attempt to match displaced employees
with campus job openings. The service
will be in operation by June 1.
The committee decided not to
offer special programs for early
retirement and early leave be
cause, according to Rosse, "These
programs have the potential to
encourage large numbers of em
ployees to leave, often those indi
viduals with long experience and
those with highly marketable
skills. It would be counter
productive for Stanford to lose too
many people."
Job displacement notices will
start coming down in mid-June
and will likely continue sporadi
cally until September 1991. The
first layoffs will take effect Sept.
1 of this year, and employees will
be given at least 30 days notice
before being laid off.
Though the budget-cutting
process will abide by the Univer
sity's affirmative action policies,
Stanford's broader goal of creat
ing a pluralistic community may
be temporarily set on the back
burner, Rosse's statement said.
"When Stanford finishes with
this repositioning process, we will
be able to return our full attention

to our goals for affirmative action
and pluralism as contained in the
[University Committee on Minor
ity Issues] Report," Rosse said.
The preliminary budget targets
were delivered to University
deans and vice presidents March
26. In the weeks since, they have
examined their operations to see
what effects the preliminary tar
gets would have and reported
their findings back to Rosse and
the committee. The committee
took those findings into account
when determining the final tar
gets, Rosse said.
The deans and vice presidents
have created task forces to
develop recommendations to meet
the final targets, and those rec
ommendations are due to the com
mittee May 18. Committee mem
bers and University President
Donald Kennedy will review the
recommendations to assess the
