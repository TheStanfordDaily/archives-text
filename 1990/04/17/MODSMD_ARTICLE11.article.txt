Lithuanians ask for talks
MOSCOW (AP) — Lithuania yesterday
asked Mikhail Gorbachev to meet with the
republic's president to provide details of Mos
cow's threatened economic sanctions so that
Lithuanians can be prepared.
It would be Gorbachev's first meeting with
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis,
who was elected after the republic declared
itself independent March 11.
In a telegram to the Soviet president, Lith
uanian Prime Minister Kazimieras Prunskiene
said Lithuania wants to explain to its people
just what difficulties they might face if they
ignore an ultimatum Gorbachev issued Friday.
Prunskiene's telegram said broad economic
sanctions would damage the Soviet economy
as well as Lithuania's. She suggested the best
way to clarify the threat would be in a meeting
in Moscow with a Lithuanian delegation,
headed by Landsbergis.
Supporters rally for monarch
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Supporters
of exiled King Michael yesterday yelled back
at what they claimed was a government
sponsored rally against the monarch's planned
visit to his native land.
Several hundred pro-monarchy demonstra
tors shouted "Communists go to church!" and
"Long live the king!" as they tried to prevent
an anti-king rally in front of government head
quarters.
There was some pushing and kicking be
tween the rival groups but eventually they
dispersed quietly. There were no arrests.
Later, about 300 supporters of the monarch
signed a petition they planned to send to the
Supreme Court asking for a visa for King
Michael.
"The government, in withdrawing the visa,
has violated the Helsinki Accords on human
rights," said Noni Andronescu, a supporter of
King Michael.

Unrest flares in Armenia
MOSCOW (AP) — Protesters attacked a
secret police office in Armenia's capital with
stones and torches over the weekend, and one
demonstrator was killed, the official news
agency reported.
In the incident, a crowd of people broke off
from an environmental rally in Yerevan on
Saturday night and headed for the KGB office
in the southern republic, Tass reported Sun

Tass said the crowd apparently was angered
by the arrest of four Armenians on charges
of stealing weapons from a military unit.
