NEW DELHI, India (AP) - A
leaking gas cylinder exploded in a mov
ing commuter train on Monday and
set off a fire that left at least 80 people
dead and 65 others wounded, news
reports and officials said.
Reporters at the scene said the ex
plosion and fire killed at least 100
people.
Fire swept through two of the train's
16 cars as it traveled near Kumrahar
in Bihar state, 500 miles southeast of

New Delhi. The fire began at 9:30 a.m.
Firefighters eventually extinguished
the blaze, but "the heat was so intense
no one dared to enter the train for at
least a half-hour after the fire," said
S. Sharma, the top civil administrator
in the region.
Sharma said a cylinder of
oxyacetylene gas, used in welding, was
found in one of the gutted cars.
"The outer shell of the bogies (cars)
was intact, but the inside was terrible,"

Sharma said in a telephone interview.
Mathew John, the director of safety
for the Federal Railway Board in New
Delhi, said two cylinders of gas caught
fire. He said one of the cylinders was
leaking and apparently ignited when
someone lit a match.
The United News of India quoted
local officials as saying at least 80
people died and 65 were wounded.
The Passengers Welfare Association
said the train had no emergency brake.

"It is the most neglected train run
ning in the state. There is no light,
no water and even no alarm chain,"
said association president Rameshwar
Pandey.
Press Trust of India said many
bodies were buried under smoldering
wooden berths and heaps of luggage.
The train, which was traveling from
Mokammeh to Arrah, is widely used
by morning commuters to Patna, the
state capital.
