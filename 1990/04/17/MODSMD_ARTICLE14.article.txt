Bench upholds ban
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday left intact a
ban on school dances in a Missouri
town inhabited largely by Christian
fundamentalists.
The court, without comment,
rejected arguments that the ban im
posed by public school officials is re
ligiously motivated and therefore vi
olates the constitutionally required
separation of church and state.
The longtime no-dance rule in
rural Purdy, Mo., was upheld by a
three-judge panel of the Bth U.S. Cir

cuit Court of Appeals last September.
In November, the full appeals court
voted 5-4 not to review the panel's
decision. But dissenting judges called
the ban "religious tyranny" that vi
olates the rights of students wishing
to hold school-sponsored dances.
Sale of temples blocked
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court yesterday blocked tem
porarily the sales of five Hare
Krishna temples to satisfy a $5 mil
lion judgement against the religious
sect.

Administration in clash
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush
administration and the National
Wildlife Federation clashed before
the Supreme Court yesterday over
what it takes to prove an individual
has been harmed by opening federal
lands to commercial development.
The Justice Department asked the
high court to reverse a June ruling
from the U.S. Appeals Court for the
District of Columbia. The ruling gives
environmentalists potentially sweep
ing power to prevent the restricted

public lands from being opened to
mining and mineral exploration.
The appellate ruling said the fed
eration may sue the Interior Depart
ment over the government's plans to
change the status of 180 million acres
of public land in the West and Alaska.
Juvenile loses battle
WASHINGTON (AP) — A juvenile
facing a possible death sentence in
