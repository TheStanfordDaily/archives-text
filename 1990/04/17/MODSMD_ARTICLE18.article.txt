## Essential to our education 
### 
IN THE WAKE of the current budget
cuts, this University has undertaken
to eliminate the Stanford in France
program in Tours. As an alumnus of the
Tours program, I would like to express
my concerns as to the wisdom of this
move.
Rather than describing the profound
sadness which I personally would feel if
Stanford were to abolish the Tours
campus or explaining the unique impor
tance of my yearlong experience at this
very special overseas center, I would like
to make clear the shortsightedness and
the extreme detriment that the scuttling
of Tours would entail for Stanford un
dergraduate education.
First of all, I would like to emphasize
that the existence of the Paris program
does not serve to minimize the impact
of closing Tours. The Paris center is not
a real alternative to Tours. It is designed
for students who already possess ad
vanced language skills and who are
prepared to take courses at various
facultes in Paris.
While I do not at all criticize the Paris
program, it must be pointed out that it
does not have the same mission as the
other overseas centers such as Tours, Ber
lin, Florence, etc.. . . Tours, like most
other centers, seeks to be accessible, to
make overseas studies a realistic option
in an undergraduate education for as
many students as possible.
It allows students with nascent lan
guage skills to develop the ability to speak
French proficiently. Moreover, it allows
students with crowded academic
schedules or with major on-campus re

sponsibilities (the majority of Stanford
undergraduates) to be able to study
abroad for just one quarter. (Paris re
quires a two-quarter commitment.)
A workable compromise would be to
combine the Paris and Tours programs
to have a center in France that has the
accessibility of Tours, Berlin, Oxford, etc.
However, there is no indication that this
solution is being considered or even if
the Paris program in its present form
will survive.
The abolition of Tours poses other
serious questions. The long-time presence
of Stanford in Tours has come to repre
sent an important tradition. Tours was
one of the first overseas campuses created
by Stanford, nearly 30 years ago. The
relationships that have been nurtured
over the years represent an irreplaceable
resource for education which will be
destroyed if the Tours campus is elimi
nated.
The ties with the Tours community
and with the families who have housed
hundreds of Stanford students cannot be
easily replaced once broken. The relation
ships which Paul LeMoal, Claude
Doubinsky, Anne Durand and others have
painstakingly established with some of
the very best French professors are an
incomparable asset to Stanford education
and will be forever cast aside if this
budget cut is made.
I would like to add that the light sup
port for a French overseas campus is
puzzling. While there is a wave of interest
in Latin America and Japan, which has
forwarded the development of the Kyoto
and Chile campuses, the importance of

a Stanford in France is undiminished.
The study of French language and culture
is not an insignificant vestige of tradi
tional Eurocentric university education.
From a practical standpoint, French
ranks, in this country, as the second-most
important foreign language to learn. In
many areas, French is spoken as a first
language. This is the case in my home
state, Maine. Moveover, our closest neigh
bor and largest trading partner, Canada,
is a bilingual nation.
In the European Economic Communi
ty, only English is more widely spoken.
Indeed, there is great rush among Eu
ropeans to go to France and learn French.
They don't want to be left behind with
the coming of Europe 1992, and Stanford
should not ignore the implications of this
major development in U.S./European re
lations.
The Tours campus is such a uniquely
valuable asset to Stanford that even in
this time of budgetary hardship, it cannot
and should not be terminated. I implore
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow and the other responsible parties
to carefully weigh this decision.
