Faculty cooperation
crucial in order
to develop program
The article titled "New environmen
tal program set for fall" in the April
13 Daily makes potential future
developments, now in the planning
stages, appear imminent, and seriously
misrepresents the way in which new
faculty appointments and curricular
change take place at Stanford.
We shall be very fortunate if, by
next fall, we have identified several
scholars who could provide leadership
in policy-related studies of global envi
ronmental problems; the "we" is a
search committee set up by collaborat
ing schools and departments, not a few
individuals as suggested by the story.
There will then be the task of per
suading these scholars to come to
Stanford, and it is unlikely that
anyone could actually arrive much
before September 1991.
Meanwhile, a new department may
be created within the School of Earth
Sciences to pursue a number of scien
tific and technological (as opposed to
policy-related) aspects of the problem.

These two efforts are telescoped in the
article. A complementary — but com
pletely independent — student initia
tive, STEM (Stanford Environmental
is in progress to identify exist
ing environmental course tracks and
provide guidance for undergraduates
currently interested in the environmen
tal field.
The cooperation of many faculty will
be needed as we pursue the objective
of intensifying Stanford's efforts on
problems of the global environment. To
the extent that The Daily's reporting
suggests all sorts of things are going
on without their knowing about them,
the task of developing a program will
be made more difficult.
We appreciate your support, Daily.
Stay tuned, but please turn down the
volume!
