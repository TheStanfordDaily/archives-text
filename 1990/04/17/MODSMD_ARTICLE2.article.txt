## Parties present multiple views of multiculturalism 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
The perennial issue of multicul
turalism has once again surfaced
as an item of dispute among rival
political parties in this year's
ASSIJ elections.

Although all
three parties
say they are
committed to
the goal of mul
ticulturalism,
they each have
distinctive

stances on what it means, and
they have different views on how
much progress has actually taken
place.
Both the Stanford Unity Party
and Students First argue that the
People's Platform, the party of
the current Council of Presidents,
has made little progress in achiev
ing goals of multiculturalism.
They further claim that the
People's Platform represents only
a part of the student body's in
terests.
The Stanford Unity Party,
which is campaigning only for un
dergraduate senate positions,
wants to "put the multi back into
multiculturalism," according to
freshmen Chris Patil and Allison
Alter.
Similarly, junior Tim
Marklein's Students First COP
slate advocates promoting pro
grams that affect and are open to
the entire Stanford community —
not simply parts of that commu
nity.
The People's Platform remains
more optimistic about recent
gains and the prospect for build
ing upon them next year. "Al
though we have a long way to go,
Stanford has been the leader on
many issues of multiculturalism,"
said People's Platform COP slate
member Ingrid Nava.
People's Platform candidates
argued that their party has
brought multiculturalism to the
forefront of the ASSU's agenda.
Party members said the increased
participation of students of color
in the ASSU is a direct result of
People's Platform leadership.
Members of the Students First
slate have called the current sit
uation on campus a "false multi
culturalism."
Junior Lora Abe, also a Stu
dents First slate member, said she
wants to create "a more honest
multiculturalism." She said, "We
need more inclusion, and this
means involving people from more
independent groups as well as
those that are affiliated with no
particular group."
Such views are largely echoed
by Stanford Unity member Alter.
According to Alter, "unconscious

alienation" has plagued recent at
tempts to promote a diverse and
accepting community.
But People's Platform member
Goodwin Liu asserted, "Our slate
is probably more experienced and
representative of the Stanford
community than any other slate
that has run for COP."
Liu, a junior, said he believes
that several steps have already
been taken to further the Univer
sity's commitment to multicul
turalism. "The ASSU's work with
Residential Education and Uni
versity administrators has clearly
promoted more interaction as well
as programs for minorities," he
said.
Patil and Marklein said not
nearly enough inclusion and in
teraction has taken place between
different campus groups.
One of Patil's proposed reme
dies to the current situation is to
create a multicultural advising
committee to serve as an adjunct
to the ASSU.
"We need to remember that cul
ture is not equivalent to eth
nicity," said Patil. This

observation has spurred Patil to
go beyond the student of color
organizations — which include
the Asian American Student As
sociation, Black Student Union,
MEChA and Stanford American
Indian Organization — in forming
a truly multicultural community.
"We want to create positions on
the advisory committee for people
from different races, ethnicities,
religious groups, sexual prefer
ences and any other subset on
campus," said Patil.
Junior Mike Canul, another
COP slate member for Students
First, said that, unlike the
People's Platform, "our slate
wasn't created out of the ranks
of four organizations."
"The student of color organiza
tions have gotten a lot done, but
they are by no means represen
tative of the entire community,"
Patil said. He believes that the
current leadership of the ASSU
has been "lazy in bringing more
people into government and stu
dent groups."
But Nava, a senior, believes her
major strength as a candidate lies
in issues of multiculturalism, and
she hopes to build upon many of
the initiatives of this year's COP.
