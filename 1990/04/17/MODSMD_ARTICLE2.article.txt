## Parties present multiple views of multiculturalism 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
The perennial issue of multicul
turalism has once again surfaced
as an item of dispute among rival
political parties in this year's
ASSIJ elections.

Although all
three parties
say they are
committed to
the goal of mul
ticulturalism,
they each have
distinctive

stances on what it means, and
they have different views on how
much progress has actually taken
place.
Both the Stanford Unity Party
and Students First argue that the
People's Platform, the party of
the current Council of Presidents,
has made little progress in achiev

They further claim that the
People's Platform represents only

The People's Platform remains
more optimistic about recent
gains and the prospect for build

though we have a long way to go,
Stanford has been the leader on
many issues of multiculturalism,"
said People's Platform COP slate
member Ingrid Nava.
People's Platform candidates
argued that their party has
brought multiculturalism to the
forefront of the ASSU's agenda.
Party members said the increased
participation of students of color
in the ASSU is a direct result of
People's Platform leadership.
Members of the Students First
slate have called the current sit
uation on campus a "false multi
culturalism."
Junior Lora Abe, also a Stu
dents First slate member, said she
wants to create "a more honest
multiculturalism." She said, "We
need more inclusion, and this
means involving people from more
independent groups as well as
those that are affiliated with no
particular group."
Such views are largely echoed
by Stanford Unity member Alter.
According to Alter, "unconscious
