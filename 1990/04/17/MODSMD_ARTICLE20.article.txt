# Daily journalists are usually too far to the left
## 
### 
On April 2, I was terribly excited
when I saw the headline "Prof, resigns
teaching position." It made my day, my
week and I knew it would make my
whole year.
One very active Marxist would no
longer be leading the Stanford Board
of Governors and others by the ass.
Alas, I learned only April 12 that it
was an April Fools' Day joke. Oh well,

it made my life super happy for 10
days.
But what still makes my day is that
journalists such as the author of the
article still have such wonderful politi
cal acumen. I had always felt that
most Daily journalists were a little to
the left.
Please keep up the good job. The
article on Political Science Prof. John
Manley joining the Hoover Institution
was super â€” pure delight.
