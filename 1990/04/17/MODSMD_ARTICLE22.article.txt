Invitation to gays
and lesbians
should be explicit
While I have long been aware and
grateful that the Stanford Housing
Center grants the petitions of lesbian
or gay couples who ask for "married"
student housing, I agree with many of
the people quoted in Wednesday's arti
cle that the time has come to clarify
this process. If the University's inten
tion is to welcome all members of the
community, the invitation needs to be
explicit.
Silence about a community can be,
in the long run, just as damaging as
overt acts of discrimination. Tolerance
is not the same as acceptance.
Dean of Student AfTairs James Lyons
seems to understand the need to be
more open about the University's ac
ceptance of gays and lesbians, noting
that Stanford loses good students when
they get the impression that they can't
bring their lovers with them to
campus, and that both students and
the Stanford community pay a high
price when students feel that they
must live in the more congenial setting
of San Francisco to feel supported for
who they are.
I might add that the same losses
occur when staff and faculty feel
equally excluded, ignored or under
valued.

As to the logistics of expanding the
University's housing system to more
explicitly accomodate both homosexual
and heterosexual unmarried couples, I
think there are plenty of bureaucratic
mechanisms available for ensuring that
housing privileges are not abused.
In the Bay Area alone, there must
be hundreds of people who've worked
on issues concerning domestic partners
legislation and who could provide
model wording for contracts and so
forth. At a minimum, the wording of
the current "Stanford Residences"
booklets could be changed to acknowl
edge that Stanford accepts petitions
from both gay and heterosexual cou
ples.

Fraternities have
suffered as target
of discrimination
In my four years at Stanford, only
one group of students has been the
subject of open, continuous, aggressive
and blatant prejudice: the housed fra
ternities.
The stereotyping that goes on
categorically labels all fraternity mem
bers as narrow-minded, elitist, sexist
and prejudiced individuals who gather
together for the sole purpose of rein-

forcing those attitudes.
Granted, there are documented oc
curences of each of these activities over
the years, but the generalization that
such attitudes pervade fraternal living
is an injustice to the vast msgority of
fraternity members who do not exhibit
these qualities. (1 should qualify my
statements. The m£yority of my experi
ence is limited to my own house, but I
assume specific comments extend to
the rest of the Greek community.)
One very well-founded acccusation of
fraternities is that they do not have
populations of minority students in
proportion to the rest of the campus.
From my experience, this is solely the
result of the negative stereotypes
which the Stanford community has
given has given these organizations.
If a minority student hears daily
that, unless you are white, fraternities
are prejudiced, hostile environments, he
will not want to visit the houses dur
ing Rush. For example, last year only
three black students rushed my house
seriously. This is an appallingly small
number. Yet, of those three, two were
offered bids which they accepted.
During Rush, I have noticed that
house members make a particularly
concerted effort to meet minority stu
dents who may be less comfortable
than others initially. Ultimately, it is
the individual, not his skin color,
which determines whether or not he
receives a bid.
I don't wish to make any comments
directly attacking individuals who have

written critical letters to The Daily
about housed fraternities, except to say
that their statements are based on
generalizations and biases that have
little basis in reality and do not ac
curately represent the individuals with
whom I have spent the last three
years.
Every fraternity offers slightly differ
ent living situations and each appeals
to different types of people. I hope that
freshmen will take the opportunity of
Rush to explore for themselves the
housed fraternities and the people who
live in them — rather than listen to
the prejudiced statements of those indi
viduals who have little idea what
makes fraternal living a diverse and
rewarding experience.

Banning loud event
shows University's
inconsistent policy
Some might argue that a festive
event, drawing a crowd of thousands of
people wearing bright colors, is good
for the morale of the University. Un
fortunately, such events also have an
unpleasant side. They attract outsiders
with no affiliation to Stanford, who
overrun a large part of the campus.
Other parts of the campus are dis-

rupted by the noise. People commonly
use drugs before, during and after the
event. A few individuals may become
violent, while others are arrested for
driving under the influence.
The Police Department and the Of
fice of Student Affairs have apparently
decided that the benefits of such events
are not worth the costs.
I don't know whether they are right,
but I am somewhat relieved that I'll
never have to suffer through another
football game.

Fraternities have
suffered as target
of discrimination
In my four years at Stanford, only
one group of students has been the
subject of open, continuous, aggressive
and blatant prejudice: the housed fra
ternities.
The stereotyping that goes on
categorically labels all fraternity mem
bers as narrow-minded, elitist, sexist
and prejudiced individuals who gather
together for the sole purpose of rein-

forcing those attitudes.
Granted, there are documented oc
curences of each of these activities over
the years, but the generalization that
such attitudes pervade fraternal living
is an injustice to the vast msgority of
fraternity members who do not exhibit
these qualities. (1 should qualify my
statements. The m£yority of my experi
ence is limited to my own house, but I
assume specific comments extend to
the rest of the Greek community.)
One very well-founded acccusation of
fraternities is that they do not have
populations of minority students in
proportion to the rest of the campus.
From my experience, this is solely the
result of the negative stereotypes
which the Stanford community has
given has given these organizations.
If a minority student hears daily
that, unless you are white, fraternities
are prejudiced, hostile environments, he
will not want to visit the houses dur
ing Rush. For example, last year only
three black students rushed my house
seriously. This is an appallingly small
number. Yet, of those three, two were
offered bids which they accepted.
During Rush, I have noticed that
house members make a particularly
concerted effort to meet minority stu
dents who may be less comfortable
than others initially. Ultimately, it is
the individual, not his skin color,
which determines whether or not he
receives a bid.
I don't wish to make any comments
directly attacking individuals who have

written critical letters to The Daily
about housed fraternities, except to say
that their statements are based on
generalizations and biases that have
little basis in reality and do not ac
curately represent the individuals with
whom I have spent the last three
years.
Every fraternity offers slightly differ
ent living situations and each appeals
to different types of people. I hope that
freshmen will take the opportunity of
Rush to explore for themselves the
housed fraternities and the people who
live in them — rather than listen to
the prejudiced statements of those indi
viduals who have little idea what
makes fraternal living a diverse and
rewarding experience.

Banning loud event
shows University's
inconsistent policy
Some might argue that a festive
event, drawing a crowd of thousands of
people wearing bright colors, is good
for the morale of the University. Un
fortunately, such events also have an
unpleasant side. They attract outsiders
with no affiliation to Stanford, who
overrun a large part of the campus.
Other parts of the campus are dis-

rupted by the noise. People commonly
use drugs before, during and after the
event. A few individuals may become
violent, while others are arrested for
driving under the influence.
The Police Department and the Of
fice of Student Affairs have apparently
decided that the benefits of such events
are not worth the costs.
I don't know whether they are right,
but I am somewhat relieved that I'll
never have to suffer through another
football game.
