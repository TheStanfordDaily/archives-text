50 Simple Things You Can
Do to Save the Earth
By The Earthworks Group
Earthworks Press, $4.95, 96 pages
Reviewed by Frank Quaratiello
Everyone should buy or borrow
this book. Everyone should read
it. Everyone should follow its tips
and change their lives.
It is a sad commentary on our
fast-paced, me-first society that
the writers of this ingenious tome
felt they had to make a book about
such an important subject this
simple to use. But they did and
it is.
Produced last year, "50 Simple
Things" is already a national best
seller and has been recommended
by environmental organizations
across the country.
The book is printed on recycled
paper. It uses recycled ink. It is
dedicated to the not-yet-born.
The body of the book is divided
into two main sections. The first
section briefly sketches out eight
environmental problems that are
facing the globe, such as the
greenhouse effect, acid rain,
vanishing wildlife and ground

water pollution. Each problem is
presented using a few quotes from
noted environmentalists or envi
ronmental organizations.
The second section of the book
outlines the 50 things you can do
to help save the Earth. This sec
tion is broken up into three parts:
"Simple Things," "It Takes Some
Effort" and "For the Committed."
Even people who have been living
"environmentally conscious" lives
for years can get something from
the book. But it is designed for
environmental beginners.
With each suggestion for behav
ioral modification, the book pro
vides background information
about a problem or a common
human practice that is endanger
ing the environment. Then the
book offers simple ways for people
to make adjustments, usually
minor adjustments, in their lives
that will help protect the environ
ment.
The book covers such familiar
topics as carpooling, recycling,
tree planting, boycotting
styrofoam and using water-saving
shower-heads and faucet 3. But the
book brings all of these stray tips
together and offers a broad guide

to living a more environmentally
sound life.
The book also offers suggestions
that you probably have not heard
of before. For instance, it tells
you how you can limit the amount
of junk mail you receive, why you
should snip the plastic rings of
six-pack holders before you throw
them away and how using com
pact fluorescent lights can save
energy.
As you are reading, watch the
little facts that are sprinkled
throughout the book in bold-faced
type beneath the page numbers.
They are as interesting as the
"Harper's Index."
More than just a piece of
propaganda for the environmental
movement, "50 Simple Things"
offers sources for each one of its
tips and continually encourages
readers to try to find out more
and to get involved.
With Earth Day 1990 happen
ing this Sunday, it is guides like
this that will help environmental
enthusiasts channel their energy
and become part of the movement.
This book will also help people
who just want to make life more
survivable do so.
