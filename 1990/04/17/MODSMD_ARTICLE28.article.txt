The "Collected Stories of Wallace Steg
ner" is a collection of prose fiction gath
ered up after a lifetime of writing by the
founder of the Stanford Creative Writing
Program. Stegner points out in the
foreword to his "Collected Stories" that
these tales are not strictly autobiogra
phical. Nonetheless, he admits that he
has a "tyrannous sense of place," which
is reflected in the physical setting of his
stories — in Saskatchewan, where he
spent his childhood; in Salt Lake City,
where he "misspent" his youth; in Cali
fornia, where he has lived for 45 years;
and in Vermont, where he has spent many
of his summers.
The temporal setting of his stories
spans across the 20th century, so that
his writings reflect not only his personal
experiences across America in space but
in time as well. A few of his stories even
take the reader abroad — for Stegner
traveled worldwide in his mature years
— to France, the Philippines and Egypt.
In short, the "Collected Stories" con
stitute the life-long journey of a keenly
observant 20th century American.
The title of Stegner's first story in his
collection is "The Traveler." In this tale,
the traveler is a salesman of pharmaceuti
cals who gets stranded on a back-country
road. His personal frustration with his
car, however, is soon overshadowed by
another individual's emergency — a boy
from a log cabin runs up to him for
assistance in reviving the boy's grandfa
ther, who has suddenly fallen ill. The
salesman soon realizes how trivial his
own car problems were in comparison
and actually sees a little of himself, his
own identity, in the anonymous boy
seeking his aid.
In addition to the notion of self
discovery, this tale brings up the recur-

ring theme in Stegner's writings that na
ture reigns supreme in spite of human
ity's attempt to control it through modern
science and technology.
This is epitomized by the helplessness
of the salesman when confronted with
car trouble — in spite of the arsenal of
so-called wonder drugs that he possesses.
The salesman "saw himself pouring a
bottle of penicillin into the gas tank and
driving off with the exhaust blowing
happy smoke rings. A mock-heroic
montage of scientific discovery unreeled
itself. . .
Moreover, this first story may be
categorized as one of a group of "frontier"
tales spun out by Stegner, with the wil
derness of turn-of-the century America
as its setting.
"Beyond The Glass Mountain" centers
around the reunion of two college buddies
17 years after graduation. Mark and Mel
face each other as middle-aged men only
to discover that their personal fortunes
have undergone a reversal since their
rah-rah college days. Whereas it was Mel
"who had everything" in those days —
"he had been brought up well, he had
good parents, his home was full of music
and books and a certain sense of social
grace and personal responsibility," now
the shoe was on the other foot.
Now, "Mark had gone higher and far
ther than any of them had ever aimed."
Instead of gloating, however, Mark is em
harassed and outraged by this turning
of the tables. He finds that his old friend
Mel has become an alcoholic and is ap

parently incapable of shedding his happy
go-lucky facade even when he has not
been drinking. Mark is also frustrated at
himself for not being able to keep himself
from sounding like a snobbish, pater
nalistic university professor. He con
cludes that Mel's wife, through her cun
ning and deceit, is destroying his old
buddy, but he finds himself unable to
voice this feeling.
The tale ends when Mel's wife leaves
for the moment, during which time Mel's
gaze of drunken stupor vanishes, thereby
reaching out to Mark for just that brief
instf.nt to confirm his worst fears.
"Beyond the Glass Mountain" is an
excellent example of Stegner's sensitivity
as an observer of interpersonal relation
ships as well as his subtlety as a literary
craftsman. Instead of directly telling the
reader about the relationships between
the characters in his stories, Stegner
skillfully shows the characters. Thus, he
lets us evaluate for ourselves the nature
of the relationships between the people
in his stories.
"The Chink" is yet another tale about
human relationships. Stegner notes in
his foreword that the social attitudes and
diction in some of his stories are dated
and that he could have revised the stories
in this collection to reflect these changes
— but only "at the cost of a fabric that
had been carefully woven in another
time."
Hence, the title of this story remains
as it was when he had originally written
the tale. "The Chink" is written from
the viewpoint of a young American lad
living early in the 20th century. This
first-person narrator first describes to
the reader his friendship with Mah Li,
a young Chinese who hardly spoke Eng
lish but taught a magpie to say "Nice
day, O-Fi" — O-Fi being the lad's nick
name.
Later in the story, however, on Hal
loween, some of O-Fi's school buddies
attempt to steal candy from a store run
by Mah Jim, Mah Li's brother. Mah Jim

successfully prevents the theft but only
at the price of incurring the playful wrath
of the boys on himself and his brother.
The boys decide to lock Mah Li up as a
practical joke. O-Fi wants to protest this
rash act, but he finds himself unable to
due to peer pressure and the social norms
of the town — Mah Li "was as much
outside human society as an animal
would have been," by O-Fi's own account.
At the end of the tale, Mah Li is found
dead, to O-Fi's despair and remorse. De
spite social pressures that would have
viewed such a reaction on O-Fi's part to
be unfounded, "the tears just came up
slowly the way a spring fills, and hung,
and brimmed over, and the first ones
ran down my face and splashed warm
on the back of my hand." This is the
concluding line of yet another of Stegner's
poignant stories.
One final story by Stegner is titled
"Maiden in a Tower." Middle-aged Kim
ball Harris has remembrances of things

past as he visits the Salt Lake City fu
neral parlor in which his Aunt Margaret
lies.
However, he finds that he feels no
emotion whatsoever to this blood relation
with whom he had only superficial con
tact during his life. In contrast, however,
Harris is drawn to the second floor of
the building, where he finds the body of
Holly.
This building, now a funeral parlor,
had been a favorite haunt of Jazz Age
Bohemians like Havelock, Ellis and
Mencken. As memories of his more youth
ful years spent in this building are evoked
Harris feels ashamed that he has chosen
the life of security over that of adventure.
Today, he "has a wife he loves and
respects, children he loves, and an inter
esting job" — but what if he had em
barked with Holly on that wild romantic
spree that she had proposed to him that
one time? Harris is reminded of the line
from Blake's "Proverbs of Hell":
"Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted
by incapacity."
Nonetheless, Harris leaves with grati
tude for having had the opportunity to,
at least for a moment, vicariously live
another past. The triumph of the eternal
over the ephemeral is yet another central
theme in Stegner's writings.
Stegner writes with sensitivity and sub
tlety. Many of his stories are filled with
descriptions of natural scenery that ap
peal to the reader's senses. Objects in
background descriptions quickly establish
for the reader the time and place setting
of each story. The vocabulary and voice
of the storyteller is always appropriate
to the subject of the story. For instance,
the diction of the "frontier" stories in
volve simple words, whereas stories about
artists are sprinkled with mythological
and literary allusions, or with allusions
to other art forms (such as painting and
music). The wide diversity of tales found
in Stegner's "Collected Stories" promises
hours of reading pleasure for practically
any kind of reader.
