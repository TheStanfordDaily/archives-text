## Another day at the office for Card Record streak now at 59 matches 
### Tyson Vaughan Staff writer 
It was the upset of the century.
The unheralded Soaring Gulls of
the United States International
University flew into Stanford Ten
nis Stadium on the wings of Fate
and shocked the four-time defend
ing national champions with al
most divinely inspired play,
ending the top-ranked Cardinal's
winning streak with a 5-4 win.

Cardinal 9
Gulls 0

If you think this sounds more
like a science fiction story than
a newspaper article, guess what?
You're right.
The truth is, Stanford's wom
en's tennis players are more pre
dictable than an atomic clock, and
their already absurdly-long win
streak continues to grow even
longer. As expected, they defeated
the Gulls 9-0 yesterday, to bring
their streak to 59 straight wins.
Although the Gulls showed
themselves to be more than just
racket fodder for the Cardinal net
ters, they also were plainly over
matched. This was particularly
evident at the bottom of the
lineup, where Stanford's depth is
unparalleled in the collegiate
world.
With Debbie Graham out of the
match due to minor injuries,
everyone else from Teri Whit
linger on down moved up one
notch.
Even so, at No. 6, Kylie Johnson
pounded Andrea Ritecz in twin
6-1 sets. Heather Willens went one
better at No. 5, almost whitewash
ing Sarit Shalev 6-1, 6-0.
In the No. 4 position, senior
captain Lisa Green overcame slow
starts in both sets to defeat Hieke
Tiemann 6-3, 6-4. Whitlinger
hammered Carol Curmi 6-1, 6-2,

at No. 3.
"My match went pretty well,"
commented Whitlinger. "I was ex
perimenting a little with my
game," she added.
No. 1 Cardinal player Sandra
Birch also mentioned that she
played somewhat differently from
usual. "I tried to come in (to the
net) more," she said. That she
did, and with success, as she
defeated Giovanna Caratenuto, a
freshman ranked 21st collegiately.
Caratenuto provided a very en
tertaining match, however, dis
playing fiery bursts of personality
on the court. After essentially
watching Birch destroy her in the
first set, Caratenuto — all the
while exclaiming in her native
Italian — began to play with new
found energy, resulting in
numerous long and exciting rallies
between the two.
But for every dazzling shot
Caratenuto conjured up, Birch
met her with an equally spectac
ular one. Moreover, Birch always
seemed to win the actual points,
which showed in the final score
—16-O, 6-3.
The most curious match of the
day occured on the No. 2 court,
where Meredith McGrath battled
Diane Lowings. McGrath, who
has been struggling somewhat of
late, seemed intent on playing her
serve- and-volley game, while
Lowings hung back at the baseline
for most of the match.
While both players seemed
strangely casual about the whole
affair — occasionally showing out
bursts of disappointment — they
traded points back and forth. On
one point McGrath would serve,
rush the net and smash a winning
volley, making it look terribly easy.
On the next point, Lowings would
return the favor, skillfully slicing
the ball around McGrath, or lof
ting it over her.
However, McGrath dominated
the second set after dropping the
first, and withstood strong play
by Lowings in the third to take
the match 4-6, 6-1, 7-5.

Since most players outside of
the United States concentrate
more on doubles play than Amer
icans do, it was not surprising
that the Gulls' International
lineup would provide some chal
lenges for Stanford's tandems.
Shalev-Ritecz pushed Johnson
and Mario Carruth to three sets,
6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
Caratenuto-Lowings posted a

strong second set against
McGrath- Whitlinger, the latter
duo winning 6-2, 7-6. Only the
tandem of Green and Willens had
relatively little trouble, beating
Tiemann and Rene Koahov 6-4,
6-3.
The next chance for the Cardi
nal to be upset — although the
odds are long — will be this Friday
against No. 2-ranked UCLA.


Kai Keasey — Daily
Meredith McGrath did an uncharacteristic thing yesterday — she
lost a set. The frosh phenom bounced back from the 6-4 loss in
the first to take her No. 2 singles match, 4-6, 6-1, 7-5.
