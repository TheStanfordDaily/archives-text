# RAs fear effect of cuts, students' silence
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
Many resident assistants are worried
about the effects budget cuts will have
on residential life, despite the reduc
tion of the cut in the Dean of Student
Affairs Office to 15 percent.
In addition, some RAs fear that not
enough students are voicing their
opinions about the budget cuts and
that students' opinions are not being
heard by higher-level decision-makers.
Within Residential Education, an ad
visory group of administrators, RAs,
resident fellows and others is meeting
regularly to discuss possible cuts.
While many RAs agree that the advi
sory committee is helping the process,

they are displeased with the Univer
sity's overall actions.
Many students do not seem to be
well informed about the budget cuts,
according to senior David Hornik, an
RAin Branner Hall. More students
need to become involved and comment
on what proposals bother them, he
said.
To combat this lack of student input,
senior David Alvarez, an RAin
Paloma, has helped begin a petition
and letter-writing campaign to Provost
James Rosse and University President
Donald Kennedy. The petition holds
that Res Ed is central to the Stanford
educational experience and, as a result,
should be given the same reduced
cut as academic programs.
Alvarez said he is also asking
interested students to write their
own letters to Rosse or Kennedy
explaining their concerns about
the budget cuts.
Alvarez complained that while
individual departments are listen
ing to student input, the higher
level decisions have been made
without consulting students.
Res Ed is an important part of
students' education, not just "an

extraneous service," Alvarez said.
Given a 15 percent cut, Res Ed
will not survive in its current
form, he said.
Another letter-writing cam
paign has centered around the
proposal to eliminate or reduce
residential computer clusters.
According to senior Nadeem
Hussain, assistant director of res
idential computing, students have
complained that there are several
problems with the proposed cuts.
In particular, students are worried
about the working environment
in the large clusters that would
be created if dorm clusters are
phased out.
Furthermore, Hussain's cal

culations show that residential
computers are far more cost
effective than Macintoshes at the
Tresidder Macintosh cluster.
Hussain and others are arguing
that residential clusters are a part
of academic life and are not
merely a service.
"Res Ed itself has been good at
going to students for their help"
in meeting the given budget cut,
Alvarez said.
Res Ed has been very open to
student input, and"it seems that
they are really interested in what
students have to say," added
Tamar Dorfman, an RAin ATO.
However, because of the short
time that Res Ed has to propose

its cuts, getting student reaction
is difficult, said senior Jerilyn
Lopez Mendoza, an RAin Toyon
Hall.
Senior Elliot Brandt, an RAin
Faisan, said it is ironic that the
Res Ed cuts are coming on the
heels of a speech by Kennedy that
called for increased emphasis on
undergraduate education, among
other things.
Mendoza noted that the cut in
Res Ed says something about the
values of the University.
"If the University is going to
be only a research university, it
should at least be honest about
it and not be hypocritical," she
said.
