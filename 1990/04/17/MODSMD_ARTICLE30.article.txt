## Resilient Skeels overcomes adversity, labors out of limelight 
### Brad Cleveringa 
Not everyone possesses the
resilience that it takes to be a
baseball player.
Stanford backup catcher Mark
Skeels could have given up the
game a long time ago, but he
didn't. After struggling for play
ing time and suffering numerous
injuries at Stanford, the sopho
more refuses to quit.
This kind of determination can
only be generated from the inside.
It cannot be induced, not even by
a half-a-million dollars. Witness
Tim Laudner, backup catcher for
the Minnesota Twins, who gave
up a $550,000 salary and retired
three weeks ago.
Many are asking why a man
retired when all he had to do was
watch baseball games from the
best seat in the house and collect
his pay check. Twins third base
man Gary Gaetti provided the an
swer. "A lot of people don't
understand the nature of baseball,

how it grinds you down. This
game is a grind. There's no doubt
about it. There are so many ups
and downs."
Skeels has seen many of those
ups-and-downs in his baseball
career. He wasn't recruited out of
Thousand Oaks (Calif.) High
School, even though he hit a very
respectable .456 his senior year.
Skeels attributes this to his fail
ure to have a spectacular junior
year (by high school standards),
as he hit only .400. He was a little
frustrated, but he didn't let it get

in his way.
"In this game you have to be
your own biggest fan even when
no one else believes in you,"
Skeel3 believes. "You can't doubt
yourself."
Displaying this confidence, he
decided to come to Stanford and
walk-on. His first day on campus,
he walked into the coach's office
to see if he could try out, and he
was promptly asked why he
should be allowed to play.
"Because I can hit," he confi
dently replied.
Making good on his boast,
Skeels made the Cardinal roster.
During his freshman year, he saw
very limited playing time, with
only one varsity at-bat, and spent
most of the season playing in the
junior varsity games or catching
in the bullpen.
Some players would be upset
with having to play a notch down,
but Skeels has a great attitude
about his role. "Some may see
them (junior-varsity games) as

demeaning to play a step below,
but I see them as a chance to
improve. I enjoy playing them."
Hampered by injuries this year,
Skeels has had a difficult time
getting into the lineup. Early in
November, while he was catching
in a scrimmage, a batter swung
and hit Skeels' left hand. He was
diagnosed as having a hairline
fracture.
His physical troubles didn't
stop there. When he went home
for winter break, he spent the
mgyority of his time lying face
down on a chiropractor's table
while nine pinched nerves were
worked out of his back.
After wading through those
troubles, injury struck again. He
currently experiences a rotator
cuff problem which hinders his
throwing ability. These injuries
haven't helped make the difficult
transition from high school third
baseman to college catcher very
