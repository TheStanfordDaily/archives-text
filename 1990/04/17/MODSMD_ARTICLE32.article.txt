# Is the NCAA out to get Stanford?
## 
### 
What is it about Stan
ford and national
governing bodies?
Perhaps this is just the ran
ting of a biased fan, but it sure
seems the NCAA and several
of their cohorts in athletic
regulation have it in for the
Cardinal. Women's basketball
provides the first example.
Two years ago, the NCAA
overreacted to a couple late
losses and Stanford's stock fell
so far the team had to open
the NCAA tournament on the
road when a home game
seemed assured.
The following year, Stanford
was ranked fourth by every poll
in the nation but was not one
of the tourney's top four seeds.
The Cardinal's reward was to
have to face Louisiana Tech on
the Techsters' home floor in
the regional final.
This year, four of the top
seven teams in the nation got
put in Stanford's quarter of the
draw.
Care for another example?
Two years ago the NCAA left
an incredibly deserving Cardi
nal women's golf team out of
the postseason, instead selec
ting a lower-ranked team with
a considerably higher stroke
average.
And last but not least, why,
oh why, did the National Invi
tation Tournament not give
Stanford's men's hoops team a
home contest in last month's
tourney when Stanford was
considered to be the second
best team in the field according
to a computer ranking method?
Maybe they're still mad
about the drug-testing thing.
Maybe it's because we win so
many national titles anyway
that they feel they have to
handicap us. Maybe I'm just
paranoid.
But maybe it's happening
again.
Worse than the other of
fenders have been
those rocket scientists
at the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association. Last
year Stanford and UCLA tied
for the regular-season title.
Back then the regular-season
champion got an automatic
berth in the final four, while
the runner-up had the privilege
of trying to beat two of the
nation's top five teams on suc
cessive nights in the Western
Regionals in order to reach the
final four.
Since Stanford and UCLA
had played twice and split those
matches, WTVA decided the two
teams were tied. The fact that
the Cardinal had trounced the
Bruins in three games in
Pauley Pavilion while UCLA's
victory had been of the nar
rowest of margins mattered
not.
The league's fir3t choice for
breaking the tie was a playoff
match, but there was a prob
lem. The NCAA has a limit for
the number of matches a team
can play in a season, and Stan
ford was only two short of that

figure. Thus if the Cardinal
lost a playoff match with the
Bruins, Stanford could not play
the two matches in the regional
that would bring Stanford to
the final four. Needless to say,
the NCAA didn't grant a one
match, one-time exemption for
Stanford, and UCLA and Stan
ford instead decided who got
the nonstop trip to the final
four with the infamous coin
flip.
Stanford lost the toss (it
seems even the fates are Bruins
fans when it comes to men's
volleyball), but won there-

gional to get to the final four
anyway. At the final four,
which was at UCLA, of course,
— it's there every other year
(literally) — the tired Cardinal
lost to the rested, homestand
ing Bruins in the NCAA cham
pionship game.
But that was last year.
This year the league was
split into two six-team
divisions after Brigham Young
joined. The teams play the
other teams in their own divi
sion twice each and the teams
in the other division once each
for a total of 16 league matches.
The league decided the top
three teams in each division
would make the playoffs, and
since there was no way to de
termine a regular-season cham
pion, the two finalists in the
playoffs will be the teams to
go to the final four.
It sounds like a pretty good
idea at this point, but then
again General Custer was prob
ably pretty high on his strategy
at the Little Big Horn before
it was implemented.
After implementation, the
reality was that Stanford was
placed in the Wilson Division,
while UCLA was put in the
DeGroot Division. Guess which
division is tougher.
If you said the Wilson Divi
sion, you were right. Don
Pardo, tell our lucky winner
about the prizes he just won.
All six Wilson Division teams
are ranked in the top seven in
the nation. DeGroot teams are
ranked two, eight, nine, 10, 13
and 17.
And when teams from the
two divisions played each other,
the teams from the Wilson
came out on top 30 of 36 times.
What this means is that Hawaii
(12-4 in the Wilson Division)
doesn't make the playoffs at
all, while UC-Santa Barbara (6-
10 in the DeGroot Division)
clinched a spot in the postsea

league win.
With one week to go in the
season, the Cardinal was 9-4 in
league but was in grave danger
of missing the playoffs. Just to
get in, Stanford had to defeat No.
9 Pepperdine on the road, upset
the nation's No. 1 team, USC,
and then take care of sixth-ranked
San Diego State the following
night. With far and away their
most inspired week of play of the
season, Stanford did just that and
now has a postseason berth.
The irony of the whole thing
is that it may just work out
for the best for the Cardi
nal. Having their collective backs
to the wall last week brought the
best out of Stanford and the team
is in a position to continue to
improve from there. Meanwhile,
UCLA clinched the top spot in
the DeGroot Division a month ago
and has been playing only for

pride and for fun since then.
It's hard to turn up motivation
and intensity with a switch, and
the Bruins are perhaps in a po
sition where they might pay the
price. Stanford, on the other
hand, has developed a lot of con
fidence in pressure situations, es
pecially in the thriller against
USC, and rightfully so. The team
clearly has the potential to beat
any team on any given night, and
that's all it takes to bring home
the national title.
Plus, unlike last year, the team
has a week off before getting back
into the swing of things at the
WIVA tournament. The lack of
rest hurt Stanford last year and
should be less of a problem in
1990.
Wouldn't it be funny if three
weeks from now the Cardinal was
thanking WTVA for making a na
tional championship possible?

This year the league was
split into two six-team
divisions after Brigham Young
joined. The teams play the
other teams in their own divi
sion twice each and the teams
in the other division once each
for a total of 16 league matches.
The league decided the top
three teams in each division
would make the playoffs, and
since there was no way to de
termine a regular-season cham
pion, the two finalists in the
playoffs will be the teams to
go to the final four.
It sounds like a pretty good
idea at this point, but then
again General Custer was prob
ably pretty high on his strategy
at the Little Big Horn before
it was implemented.
After implementation, the
reality was that Stanford was
placed in the Wilson Division,
while UCLA was put in the
DeGroot Division. Guess which
division is tougher.
If you said the Wilson Divi
sion, you were right. Don
Pardo, tell our lucky winner
about the prizes he just won.
All six Wilson Division teams
are ranked in the top seven in
the nation. DeGroot teams are
ranked two, eight, nine, 10, 13
and 17.
And when teams from the
two divisions played each other,
the teams from the Wilson
came out on top 30 of 36 times.
What this means is that Hawaii
(12-4 in the Wilson Division)
doesn't make the playoffs at
all, while UC-Santa Barbara (6-
10 in the DeGroot Division)
clinched a spot in the postsea

son when they garnered their fifth
league win.
With one week to go in the
season, the Cardinal was 9-4 in
league but was in grave danger
of missing the playoffs. Just to
get in, Stanford had to defeat No.
9 Pepperdine on the road, upset
the nation's No. 1 team, USC,
and then take care of sixth-ranked
San Diego State the following
night. With far and away their
most inspired week of play of the
season, Stanford did just that and
now has a postseason berth.
The irony of the whole thing
is that it may just work out
for the best for the Cardi
nal. Having their collective backs
to the wall last week brought the
best out of Stanford and the team
is in a position to continue to
improve from there. Meanwhile,
UCLA clinched the top spot in
the DeGroot Division a month ago
and has been playing only for

pride and for fun since then.
It's hard to turn up motivation
and intensity with a switch, and
the Bruins are perhaps in a po
sition where they might pay the
price. Stanford, on the other
hand, has developed a lot of con
fidence in pressure situations, es
pecially in the thriller against
USC, and rightfully so. The team
clearly has the potential to beat
any team on any given night, and
that's all it takes to bring home
the national title.
Plus, unlike last year, the team
has a week off before getting back
into the swing of things at the
WIVA tournament. The lack of
rest hurt Stanford last year and
should be less of a problem in
1990.
Wouldn't it be funny if three
weeks from now the Cardinal was
thanking WTVA for making a na
tional championship possible?

What is it about Stan
ford and national
governing bodies?
Perhaps this is just the ran
ting of a biased fan, but it sure
seems the NCAA and several
of their cohorts in athletic
regulation have it in for the
Cardinal. Women's basketball
provides the first example.
Two years ago, the NCAA
overreacted to a couple late
losses and Stanford's stock fell
so far the team had to open
the NCAA tournament on the
road when a home game
seemed assured.
The following year, Stanford
was ranked fourth by every poll
in the nation but was not one
of the tourney's top four seeds.
The Cardinal's reward was to
have to face Louisiana Tech on
the Techsters' home floor in
the regional final.
This year, four of the top
seven teams in the nation got
put in Stanford's quarter of the
draw.
Care for another example?
Two years ago the NCAA left
an incredibly deserving Cardi
nal women's golf team out of
the postseason, instead selec
ting a lower-ranked team with
a considerably higher stroke
average.
And last but not least, why,
oh why, did the National Invi
tation Tournament not give
Stanford's men's hoops team a
home contest in last month's
tourney when Stanford was
considered to be the second
best team in the field according
to a computer ranking method?
Maybe they're still mad
about the drug-testing thing.
Maybe it's because we win so
many national titles anyway
that they feel they have to
handicap us. Maybe I'm just
paranoid.
But maybe it's happening
again.
Worse than the other of
fenders have been
those rocket scientists
at the Western Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association. Last
year Stanford and UCLA tied
for the regular-season title.
Back then the regular-season
champion got an automatic
berth in the final four, while
the runner-up had the privilege
of trying to beat two of the
nation's top five teams on suc
cessive nights in the Western
Regionals in order to reach the
final four.
Since Stanford and UCLA
had played twice and split those
matches, WTVA decided the two
teams were tied. The fact that
the Cardinal had trounced the
Bruins in three games in
Pauley Pavilion while UCLA's
victory had been of the nar
rowest of margins mattered
not.
The league's fir3t choice for
breaking the tie was a playoff
match, but there was a prob
lem. The NCAA has a limit for
the number of matches a team
can play in a season, and Stan
ford was only two short of that

figure. Thus if the Cardinal
lost a playoff match with the
Bruins, Stanford could not play
the two matches in the regional
that would bring Stanford to
the final four. Needless to say,
the NCAA didn't grant a one
match, one-time exemption for
Stanford, and UCLA and Stan
ford instead decided who got
the nonstop trip to the final
four with the infamous coin
flip.
Stanford lost the toss (it
seems even the fates are Bruins
fans when it comes to men's
volleyball), but won there-

gional to get to the final four
anyway. At the final four,
which was at UCLA, of course,
— it's there every other year
(literally) — the tired Cardinal
lost to the rested, homestand
ing Bruins in the NCAA cham
pionship game.
