# Men's netters host NCAA-bound Utes
## 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Coach Dick Gould has won
more NCAA titles than any coach
in the history of college tennis —
10, to be exact. He has mentored
superstars such as John McEnroe,
Tim Mayotte, Roscoe Tanner and
Sandy Mayer.
So when Gould made the com
ment that this 1990 squad "could
be the greatest college team in
the last two decades," he was
talking from experience.
Gould made the statement after
being asked what people would be
missing if they were to skip the
next two home matches, the first

of which pits No. 1-ranked Stan
ford against Utah today at 1:30
p.m.
"What would they be missing?"
Gould responded. "They would be
missing a team that has won its
singles matches more convinc
ingly than any of my previous
teams. They would be missing an
exceptional and exciting player in
Jonathan Stark. They would be
missing a great player and a true
fighter in Alex O'Brien. They
would be missing Jeff Cathrall, a
senior who is playing at the top
of his game.
"And they could well be missing
what might prove to be the best
team in the last two decades."
The Utes, however, will not be
daunted by the immensely
talented Cardinal team. According
to Gould, Utah will most likely
go to the NCAA championships
this year. "It will be a good
match," Gould said.
"We are looking to it as a good
warmup for the USC and UCLA
matches this weekend. We
definitely will play the whole
match out.* That means that we
will have a good chance to work
on our doubles," he added.
How is the the loss to California
last Wednesday going to affect the
team's play?
"As a coach, I try to not put
too much emphasis on any one
match or on any one loss," Gould
said. "You are better off trying to
improve each day. You are going
to get your toe stubbed along the
way. You just have to keep on
emphasizing individual and team
improvement and focus on day
to-day progress. Then it's up to
the guys to respond."
Gould again praised Jason Yee
and Dan Turbow for filling in so
admirably for the injured Jared
Palmer.
"Dan Turbow is a very solid
doubles playerGould said.
"In Jason's case, he's been here
three years and didn't play much
for two and a half of them," Gould
added. "There is a lot of pressure
on him to perform well in the big
matches. To say he has performed
well is an understatement."
