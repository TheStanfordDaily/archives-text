# Athletes of the Week

Nobody gave them a chance. They were
just going through the motions. It was all
over but the shouting. "Wait 'till next year."
Yes, it seems that everyone had used every
cliche in the book to write off the postseason
chances of the Stanford Cardinal men's vol
leyball team going into last Friday's do-or-die
match with No. 1-ranked USC.
However, when the talking was over and
the playing commenced, the Cardinal dug

down inside themselves and pulled out a
tense five-game win over the Trojans and
made it to the playoffs.
Everyone expected them to win it. Let's
face it, after winning 59 straight, the Stan
ford women's tennis team is expected to win
everything. But Kylie Johnson is not part
of the expected equation, with her No. 7
slot on the squad relegating her to limited
action this season. But when she was needed,
the sophomore responded with four convinc
ing wins.
Thus, Johnson and volleyball team leader
Dan Hanan have been named The Daily
Athletes of the Week.
Johnson, who hails from Salt Lake City,
jumped two spots last Tuesday and played
at No. 5 singles, where she thrashed Fresno
State's Karen Farquhar G-0, 6-1.
A tougher time was expected against the
Cal Bears, who came the No. 6-ranked team
in the country. But Johnson and the Car
dined proved equal to the challenge, upending
California 8-1. Johnson did not just win at
No. 6 singles, she killed her opponent,
cremated her and spread the ashes around
the grounds of Berkeley's Hellman Tennis
Complex. Veen a Prabhakar could managed
nary a game, as Johnson recorded the
double-bagel, 6-0, 6-0.

Hanan, who calls Huntington Beach,
Calif., home, willed the Cardinal to the win
and the playoffs. Against USC, the senior
had 20 kills and hit .457. Of all of them,
the sixth spike may have been the most

memorable.
Not that the sixth spike meant anything
in terms of the match. But with the kill,
Hanan passed Stanford great Scott Fortune
in all-time career kills to set a new Cardinal
record.
Hanan's presence, as much as his play,
carried the Cardinal to the win. Each of his
kills seemed to resonate with authority that
inspired his teammates and the crowd.
