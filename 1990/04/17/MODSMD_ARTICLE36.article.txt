# Blackhawks take series in seven
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) - Wayne Pres
ley and Jeremy Roenick each
scored a pair of rapid-fire goals
in the second period Monday
night and the Chicago Black
hawks rolled to a 5-2 victory over
the Minnesota North Stars to win
their Norris Division semifinal se
ries in seven games.
The Blackhawks, the regular
season Norris champions, will
open the division finals at home
Wednesday night against the St.
Louis Blues, who eliminated the
Toronto Maple Leafs in five
games.
Presley tied the game 1-1 three
minutes into the second period
and put the Blackhawks ahead to
stay at 4:06 with his fifth goal of
the series. Both came from di
rectly in front of goalie Jon Casey,
the second on a short wrist shot
during a delayed penalty.
Roenick knocked in his own sec
ond round at 12:41 for a 3-1 lead,

then scored again at at 14:06,
giving him five goals for the se
ries.
Greg Millen, who was pulled for
the third time in Game 6, was
outstanding in goal for Chicago,
stopping 30 of 32 shots.
The Blackhawks were in trou
ble during the first period. They
fell behind 1-0 on Don Barber's
power-play goal, then went down
two men when Keith Brown took
a high-sticking mqjor for cutting
Barber at 14:51 and Denis Savard
got a major and was ejected for
drawing blood when he high
sticked Neal Broten at 17:37.
That gave the North Stars a
chance to break the game open,
but they failed to cash in. The
Blackhawks were two men short
for 2:18, but the Blackhawks'
penalty-killers, urged on by ear
splitting cheers from the sellout
crowd, combined with Millen to
keep Minnesota from adding to

its lead.
There was 2:37 left on Savard's
penalty at the start of the second
period, but Barber drew a hooking
penalty 22 seconds into the period,
short-circuiting the rest of the
power play.
Once back at equal strength,
the Blackhawks took control and
put the game away with their
four-goal outburst.
The North Stars capitalized on
their first power play of the game
for the only goal of the opening
period. Dave Manson drew a
cross-checking penalty at 8:47 and
Barber tipped Brian Bellows' shot
from the point past Greg Millen
at 9:02.
The North Stars closed the gap
to 4-2 when Ulf Dahlen scored at
9:58 of the third period but any
hopes of a late comeback were
doused when Greg Gilbert added
an insurance goal with 2:50 to
play.


Al Green — Daily file
Backup catcher Mark Skeels has seen some action for the No. 2-ranked Cardinal this year, but
numerous injuries have limited his time. Skeels walked on to the team last year as as freshman and
has backed up starter Troy Tallman and seen time as a pinch-hitter.
