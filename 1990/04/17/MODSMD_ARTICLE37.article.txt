# Giants, LaCoss down Dodgers

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Mike
LaCoss pitched a five-hitter —
only the third complete game this
season in the majors — and Will
Clark drove in two runs as the
San Francisco Giants beat the Los
Angeles Dodgers 3-1 Monday
night.
LaCoss (2-0) struck out four
and walked three as he went the
distance for the first time since
Sept. 24, matching his total of
complete games for each of the
past two seasons. The victory
snapped San Francisco's three
game losing streak.
LaCoss retired the first nine
Dodgers. He held Los Angeles hit
less until Mike Scioscia's one-out
single in the fifth.
Fernando Valenzuela (0-2) al

lowed six hits and three runs over
six innings. It was his 18th defeat
in 33 career decisions against the
Giants, who have beaten the left
hander more than any National
League team.
Clark, who opened the scoring
in the first inning with a sacrifice
fly, climaxed a two-run fifth when
right-fielder Hubie Brooks over
ran his drive to the alley for an
RBI double. The hit scored Kevin
Bass, who singled in Jose Uribe
from second after Uribe's leadoff
single and LaCoss' second
sacrifice of the game.
The Dodgers scored in the sixth
on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by
Lenny Harris. Kal Daniels singled
with one out before Brad Kom
minsk, who replaced Kevin

Mitchell in left field at the start
of the inning, missed Eddie Mur
ray's slicing liner for a single.
Brooks, fighting a 4-for-26
slump, followed with a single that
loaded the bases and Harris
scored Daniels with a fly to center.
LaCoss prevailed despite a two
inning spell of wildness. One out
after Scioscia's hit, he walked
Valenzuela on four pitches.
LaCoss fell behind Juan Samuel
3-0, but got him two pitches later
on an inning-ending grounder to
short.
An inning earlier, LaCoss issued
walks to Samuel and Daniels
before Murray fouled out on the
first pitch and Brooks grounded
out.
