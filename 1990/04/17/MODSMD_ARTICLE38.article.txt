# Running for office — any office
## Sophomore Nurk Twins launch write-in candidacy 
### Jeannie Heltzel 
Nurk Twins power, activate!
Form of ... sophomores Forrest Gottshalk and
Rob Wheeler, a pair who pledge to depoliticize the
ASSU to serve a variety of student groups rather

than only those with "politically
correct" philosophies.
Just in time for students un
impressed with the official can
didates vying for Council of
Presidents and the ASSU Senate,
these new contenders have ap
peared on the ASSU election

scene.
Because they are not officially registered to run,
the Nurk Twins are asking for write-in votes for
both the COP and the senate. The Twins' fliers
read, "Write us in — for anything!"
The unpretentious pair did not register as official
candidates because they did not decide to campaign
seriously until last week, and the registration dead
line was five weeks ago.
According to the duo, their name was inspired
by Beatles John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who
used the name in a talent contest in 1960. But the
two explained that their strange name choice is

hardly less serious or relevant than "all the fliers
and campaign messages around campus we're so
sick of seeing."
"Our relative obscurity and silly name are not
reflections on how seriously we are approaching the
election," Wheeler explained.
"Besides, how can anyone look at our campaign
and assume we don't have serious intentions when
other candidates use gimmicky flyers that make
references to sumo wrestlers and the like?" Got
tshalk said.
The Nurk Twins have avoided plastering dorms
with "catchy fliers that don't say a whole lot" and
have spent only $15 on their campaign so far, ac
cording to the pair.
"Last year we spent the night of the election
taking down ASSU campaign fliers for recycling.
The amount of paper wasted was incredible,"
Wheeler said.
The Nurk Twins said they promise, if elected, to
integrate all student groups into the ASSU not
just ones that fit a certain political agenda.
The two also propose collaboration between X-TV,
where both Twins help with production, and the
ASSU to keep students better informed of the ac
tivities of their student government.
