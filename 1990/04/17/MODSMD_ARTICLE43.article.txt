Manzanita power out
An early-morning power outage kept Man
zanita Park and the Wilbur modulars in the
dark for several hours yesterday, according
to University Operations and Maintenance.
Electrical power was cut at about 5 a.m.
and was restored to the Wilbur modulars'
offices, conference rooms and production fa
cility at around 9 a.m., according to JefT
Sultan, manager of electrical utilities. How
ever, the approximately 350 Manzanita res
idents went without power until about 6:30
p.m.
Sultan blamed the interrupted power on
an underground cable failure. He said the
rubber insulation surrounding several power
lines had worn away, causing a short in the
line.
Sultan said such power outages occur from
time to time along the University's 35 miles

of underground cables but that no such
problem had arisen recently at Manzanita.
