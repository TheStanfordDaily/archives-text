# More terminals, fewer poll sites in 1990 election
##

Because of last year's successful
debut of computerized voting, the
computer will once again be the
ballot box in this year's ASSU
elections.
As a result of student com
plaints about long lines at last
year's polling sites, this week's

election will have more computers and poll watchers
for voting. In contrast to last year's 60 computers,
this year there will be 80 Mac SEs and Mac lis for
students to use.
In fact, ASSU Elections Commissioner Steve
Krauss, who also ran last year's election, decided
to reduce the number of polling sites from nine to
seven.
Krauss abandoned the polling sites at the post
office and Clock Tower. These two sites had the
longest lines because they had fewer machines than
other sites.
Whether long lines will resurface this year
depends on where people choose to vote, according
to Krauss. For instance, there will be 32 Macs at
the Tresidder Union polling site but only nine at
Terman Engineering Building. If excessively long
lines emerge at any of the sites, voters will be
redirected to another site, he said.
Krauss expects that two-thirds of the voters will
sign on to a computer after waiting in line for no
longer than five minutes. He also hopes that nobody
will wait longer than 20 minutes.
Last year, 60 percent of the voters waited less
than 10 minutes, while 15 to 20 percent of the
voters were in line for more than half an hour, he
said.
Security is also a concern for Krauss. This year,
poll watchers will input the name and ID number
of the student at a separate machine from the one
