# Cowell works to improve its 'sickly' image

If you haven't had the sniffles or a cough lately,
you may not have noticed that new furniture, carpet,
partitions and student artwork have taken over the
reception area of Cowell Student Health Center.
These cosmetic renovations are the first step in
building a more positive public image of Cowell,
long the butt of student jokes.
"In general, there is always a feeling on this
campus and on most campuses that the two areas
of the University that they are most free to criticize
are the food service and the student health center,"
said Dr. John Dorman, director of public outreach
for Cowell. "This criticism is somewhat independent
of the quality."
Despite student comparisons of Cowell's quality
to the quality of Wilbur Hall food, Cowell has been
frequently applauded outside the University for its
commitment to "24-hour total primary care," Dor
man said.
"Student health has come from the backwater of
medicine to the vanguard of medical practice," Dor
man said, and it emphasized health promotion and
preventive medicine long before the general medical
community began stressing these issues.
