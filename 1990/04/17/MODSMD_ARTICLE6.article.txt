# Cowell works to improve its 'sickly' image
## 
### Lisa Nellor Staff writer 
If you haven't had the sniffles or a cough lately,
you may not have noticed that new furniture, carpet,
partitions and student artwork have taken over the
reception area of Cowell Student Health Center.
These cosmetic renovations are the first step in
building a more positive public image of Cowell,
long the butt of student jokes.
"In general, there is always a feeling on this
campus and on most campuses that the two areas
of the University that they are most free to criticize
are the food service and the student health center,"
said Dr. John Dorman, director of public outreach
for Cowell. "This criticism is somewhat independent
of the quality."
Despite student comparisons of Cowell's quality
to the quality of Wilbur Hall food, Cowell has been
frequently applauded outside the University for its
commitment to "24-hour total primary care," Dor
man said.
"Student health has come from the backwater of
medicine to the vanguard of medical practice," Dor
man said, and it emphasized health promotion and
preventive medicine long before the general medical
community began stressing these issues.
Nevertheless, some students
continue to see Cowell as a place
to get aspirin and bandages —
not serious medical treatment.
"People tend to think that doc
tors working in student health are
only doing so because they can't
get work anywhere else, and so
they are not taken seriously," Dor
man said. "People come into my
office and see my certificate from
Harvard Medical School on the
wall and ask, 'What are you doing
here?' "
In addition, the ungraceful res
ignation of Cowell's director last

year and the death of a student
with mononucleosis a couple of
years ago have contributed to
Cowell's negative image among
the Stanford community, accord
ing to Dorman.
Recognizing this image prob
lem, Cowell recently appointed
Dorman as its first director of
public outreach. Dorman's first
task was to make the physical
atmosphere of the place more in
viting and modern, since the 24-
year-old health center was
"beginning to look kind of shab
by," he said.
Dorman also hopes to expand
the exhibit of paintings by soph
omore Eric Butters currently in
the reception area into a rotating
gallery for student artwork and

photography.
"It's important to show that
we're proud of Cowell because
that affects how people perceive
us," Dorman said. "We're not
trying to make more people come
in here" but to increase the
awareness of Cowell's services.
In addition to the new reception
area, Cowell has tried to create
more resources for students, in
cluding "Healthnotes" advertise
ments in The Daily, student
involvement on Cowell's Student
Health Advisory Review and Eval
uation committee and its Health
Promotion Program.
These efforts, Dorman said, are
designed to build Cowell's image
as "not a sick center, but a health
center."
