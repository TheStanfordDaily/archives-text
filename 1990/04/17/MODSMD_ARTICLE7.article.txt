# Helping to sow the seeds of peace
## Planting of tree celebrates legacy of the Ohlones 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
A new Stanford Tree is
growing at the Bechtel Inter
national Center.
With the help of a chief of
the Mohawk Nation, 200
children and adults helped
"bury the hatchet" of racial dis
cord beneath a special "Tree of
Peace" at the I-Center yester
day.
Chief Jake Swamp led the
planting ceremony, sponsored
by campus groups including
the Office of Graduate Studies
and the Stanford American In
dian Organization, amid the
whispers and shuffling feet of
about 100 area schoolchildren.
The planting was intended to
signify the rebirth of Stanford
in its second century and to
recognize the "long legacy of
peace and harmony" that the
Ohlone Indians maintained
here before the University was
built.
Swamp, speaker of the
Grand Council of the Iroquois
Confederacy in upstate New
York, explained the legend of
the Peacemaker and the Tree
of Peace.
According to his tribe's faith
