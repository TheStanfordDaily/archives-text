# Helping to sow the seeds of peace
## Planting of tree celebrates legacy of the Ohlones 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
A new Stanford Tree is
growing at the Bechtel Inter
national Center.
With the help of a chief of
the Mohawk Nation, 200
children and adults helped
"bury the hatchet" of racial dis
cord beneath a special "Tree of
Peace" at the I-Center yester
day.
Chief Jake Swamp led the
planting ceremony, sponsored
by campus groups including
the Office of Graduate Studies
and the Stanford American In
dian Organization, amid the
whispers and shuffling feet of
about 100 area schoolchildren.
The planting was intended to
signify the rebirth of Stanford
in its second century and to
recognize the "long legacy of
peace and harmony" that the
Ohlone Indians maintained
here before the University was
built.
Swamp, speaker of the
Grand Council of the Iroquois
Confederacy in upstate New
York, explained the legend of
the Peacemaker and the Tree
of Peace.

keepers, the Iroquois nations en
joyed a long period of harmony
"in the beginning of time." But
wars began and greed entered this
garden paradise, and the mystical
Peacemaker was born in the
Huron tribe of Canada 1,000
years ago.
His mother was a virgin, and
the baby's frightened grand
mother sought to kill the un
natural baby. She tried ice, burial
and fire, but none of these meth
ods could destroy the child.
Since then, Swamp said, his
people have always attempted any
challenge three times, and if they
were not successful by the third

try, "it was not meant to be."
As a young man, the Peace
maker built a stone canoe in
which he sailed to the Iroquois
land to teach the warring tribes
peace and the appreciation of na
ture.
The Peacemaker planted the
first Tree of Peace, and beneath
it he placed the warriors' weap
ons, originating the phrase "bury
the hatchet."
Telling the audience that "in
unity there is strength," Swamp
let four children — one white, one
black, one Asian-American and
one Native American — tie white,
black, yellow and red ribbons
around the tree. Then he invited
everyone else to help plant the
tree by each placing a handful of
dirt around the roots.
