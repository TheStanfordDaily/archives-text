# White House welcome for Cardinal women
## Bush greets national champs in garden 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
WASHINGTON — Jerry Tarkanian,
coach of the UNLV men's basketball team,
is one of the largest figures in larger-than
life Las Vegas. Given all the glitz and glim
mer that surrounds him, one might think
Tarkanian would be difficult to impress.
An invitation to the White House, how
ever, was enough to do just that. As Pres
ident George Bush was preparing to honor
the NCAA champion Stanford women's bas
ketball team and the UNLV men yesterday,

Tarkanian put his arm around Cardinal
Coach Tara VanDerveer and summed up
the event in five simple words: "This is the
big time."
The presentation in the Rose Garden was
pushed up 10 minutes, to 2:20 EDT, in an
attempt to get it done before an impending
storm set in. The plan didn't work, as the
heavens opened before Bush arrived. Still,
for lack of a better cliche, the rain could
not dampen the high spirits of the Stanford
women. "What better way to spend a day,"
VanDerveer said. "It's a once in a lifetime
thing."

As the team was taken on a special tour
of the White House, VanDerveer took a mo
ment to put the day in perspective. "All this
fallout from a seven-point difference," she
said, referring to the 88-81 score in the
NCAA championship game. "That's the dif
ference between being No. 1 and No. 2."
Seven points or 70, the Cardinal got the
job done, and an impressive Stanford con
tingent was on hand to honor them. Two

chair of the Council of Economic
Advisers, and Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice, a military
adviser — were in attendance.
In addition, two-thirds of the
Stanford-connected Supreme
Court troika — Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor and Anthony Ken
nedy — took time out from their
busy schedules to be at the cere
monies.
Bush seemed genuinely disap
pointed that the inclement
weather was going to cut him
short. "I have a lot to say about
these guys," he said of the two
teams. Guys? "That's a generic
use of the term."
"They are the final two of the
Final Fours. Both teams were
awesome. The Cardinal won a
Pac-10 and Stanford record 32
games," he said, explaining the
importance of VanDerveer in the
achievement. "From the very be
ginning, she instilled that winning
attitude."
Of the team as a whole, Bush
noted, "You've given everyone a
reason to be mighty proud down
on the Farm." The president then
ticked off some remarks about
Stanford's players. Though the in
formation was prepared from a
packet sent in advance by sports

information director Steve Rac
zynski, Bush read through it with
enough emotion to make it appear
he had researched the team him
self.
"Katy Steding, three must be
your number," he said of the Car
dinal's long-distance shooting
star. Bush mentioned the number
35 in association with Trisha
Stevens, which is her career scor
ing high. She matched it during
the NCAA tournament against
Hawaii. Julie Zeilstra was on
crutches to rest her Achilles ten
don, a source of pain throughout
the season. Bush noted that de
spite the injury, she played in
every game.
"Sonja Henning, after your vic
tory over Auburn, they should
light 21 candles in your honor,"
he said of her team-high point
total in the championship game.
"They say you're one-half of the
best backcourt in America."
The other half is All-American
Jennifer Azzi. "It's no coincidence
you won the Naismith Award and
Margaret Wade Trophy," he said,
acknowledging her as the
recipient of the sport's two highest
honors. The president then joked,
"One of my favorite bands is the
Oak Ridge Boys." Azzi, of course,
hails from Oak Ridge, Tenn., and
Bush referred to the fact the Final
Four was played in nearby Knox
ville.
He noted Chris MacMurdo's 3.7

grade point average as a human
biology mfyor and that Stacy Par
son is the team's walking "en
cyclopedia" as a segue to praise
for the student-athlete in general,
and the two teams in particular.
"Whether you study amidst the
moorish arches of Stanford or the
modern facilities of UNLV, when
the cheering has faded, you have
something [special]," Bush said of
the education they have received.
Henning was the Cardinal's des
ignated gift giver. "We'd like to
present you with an honorary let
terman's blanket," she said as the
team unveiled a Stanford blanket
with "George Bush" on it.
Bush and Vice President Dan
Quayle, making a relatively rare
appearance together, shook hands
with all the coaches and players.
Val Whiting asked each to sign a
T-shirt she brought with her, and
they both obliged.
VanDerveer and Tarkanian got
an opportunity to talk to the pres
ident in the Oval Office. "It was
like chatting with just a regular
guy. He said, 'I felt bad because
it was really raining outside. I
just wanted to say hello.' "
Azzi was ebullient as usual.
After a busy day that included
the White House, a reception at
the Stanford in Washington center
and a magnificent steak dinner
she put it succinctly: "What a
trip!"
