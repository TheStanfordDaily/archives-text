# White House welcome for Cardinal women
## Bush greets national champs in garden

WASHINGTON — Jerry Tarkanian,
coach of the UNLV men's basketball team,
is one of the largest figures in larger-than
life Las Vegas. Given all the glitz and glim
mer that surrounds him, one might think
Tarkanian would be difficult to impress.
An invitation to the White House, how
ever, was enough to do just that. As Pres
ident George Bush was preparing to honor
the NCAA champion Stanford women's bas
ketball team and the UNLV men yesterday,

Tarkanian put his arm around Cardinal
Coach Tara VanDerveer and summed up
the event in five simple words: "This is the
big time."
The presentation in the Rose Garden was
pushed up 10 minutes, to 2:20 EDT, in an
attempt to get it done before an impending
storm set in. The plan didn't work, as the
heavens opened before Bush arrived. Still,
for lack of a better cliche, the rain could
not dampen the high spirits of the Stanford
women. "What better way to spend a day,"
VanDerveer said. "It's a once in a lifetime
thing."

As the team was taken on a special tour
of the White House, VanDerveer took a mo
ment to put the day in perspective. "All this
fallout from a seven-point difference," she
said, referring to the 88-81 score in the
NCAA championship game. "That's the dif
ference between being No. 1 and No. 2."
Seven points or 70, the Cardinal got the
job done, and an impressive Stanford con
tingent was on hand to honor them. Two
