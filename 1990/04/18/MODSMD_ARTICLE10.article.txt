### Kim Freidberg Staff writer 
As the criminal charges mount
against Ralph Sanders, the man
suspected of burglarizing Stan
ford dormitories in the guise of a
Cardinal basketball player, a Palo
Alto judge yesterday raised his
bail to $150,000.
Municipal Court Judge
Timothy Hanifin called the pre
vious bail amount of $60,000
"way, way too low," but he
granted Sanders' request for a
week of extra time to hire private
legal counsel.
Sanders is accused of posing as
an athlete to steal checks and
other personal items from dor
mitory rooms and of forging and
cashing stolen checks. He is also
accused of opening a false bank

account with a
friend's stolen
driver's license in
order to write il
legal checks.
"[Sanders] left
a trail of many
disgruntled
people that he
has victimized,"
Stanford Police

Detective Tim Frecceri said.
Frecceri investigated the Stanford
burglaries for several months and
arrested Sanders April 4 after two
weeks of surveillance.

Since the arrest of the 22-year
old Sanders, a former student at
Foothill College and San Jose
State University, the San Jose
State police have submitted a case
to the county district attorney

with several felony counts, Frec
ceri said. San Jose State police
would not comment on the nature
of those charges.
In addition, the Stanford police
have received a number of calls
from Foothill students claiming
that Sanders stole various items
from them. According to Frecceri,
several complaints against the
suspect may still be submitted.
"It appears that we have opened
up a large case here," said Frec
ceri, who believes Sanders may
have committed crimes all over
the Bay Area and possibly even
in other parts of California.
The Superior Court will review
Sanders' case on Monday. Sanders
will enter a plea four days later.
"I would be surprised if he en
tered a guilty plea," said Frecceri.
