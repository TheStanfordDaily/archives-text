Peres forms government
JERUSALEM (AP) — Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres said yesterday he will present
a minority government for parliamentary ap
proval next week, Israel television reported.
Last week, Peres tried to present a majority
government but his efforts collapsed when two
last-minute defections from an ultra-Orthodox
party prevented him from securing the neces
sary 61 votes in the 120-member parliament.
Peruvian guerrillas attack
LIMA, Peru (AP) — Leftist guerrillas shot
to death the former director of the Peruvian
Social Security Institute and dumped his body
on a beach 20 miles south of Lima, police said
yesterday.
Officials said Felipe Santiago Salaverry's
body, riddled with four shots, was found near
a sports club on the beach.
Fighter jets collide
KARLSRUHE, West Germany (AP) - Two
Canadian fighter jets collided over this south
western German city during the early evening
rush hour yesterday, killing one of the pilots
and showering sections of Karlsruhe with
flaming debris, officials said.
The second pilot was injured after he ejected
from the single-seat F-18 and parachuted onto
a busy highway, and at least two people on
the ground were also hurt, police said.
Ethnic tension reported
LONDON (AP) — The ethnic tensions in
the Soviet Union have spread to the military,
causing problems recruiting soldiers from
areas of unrest, Jane's Defense Weekly said
yesterday.
The authoritative magazine said many eth
nic groups were reticent to join the armed
forces and nationalist cliques within the mil
itary caused fights and disciplinary problems.
Afghan leaders executed
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) — Two senior
members of Afghanistan's ruling party have
been executed for their alleged role in last
month's bloody coup attempt, Western
diplomats said yesterday.
Ghulam Astagir Panjshiri and Saleh
Mohammad Zeary were expelled from the
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan and
the powerful Politburo shortly after the failed
March 6 coup.
Call for nonviolence
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -
President F.W. De Klerk said yesterday the
government will insist in talks next month
with black leaders that the African National
Congress renounce violence in its struggle
against apartheid.
In a speech to Parliament, De Klerk
reiterated his views on the constitutional sys
tem he hopes to negotiate with the ANC and
other anti-apartheid groups once obstacles to
talks are removed.
But he said the guerrilla movement's ad
vocacy of armed struggle would hold back any
negotiations on power-sharing between the
white minority and the 28 million blacks.
Nationwide strike threatened
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — The Sandi
nista Labor Federation yesterday threatened
a nationwide strike and said it would seize
"strategic points" if the Contras do not disarm
before a newly elected government takes office
next week.
But rebel leaders said they will not down
arms until the armed forces, built and
dominated by the Sandinistas during their dec
ade in power, are dismantled and replaced by
a police force.
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
is scheduled to take office April 25 for a six
year term.
