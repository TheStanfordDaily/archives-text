# Civil rights leader Abernathy dies at 64
## 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) - The Rev. Ralph
David Abernathy, who created the civil
rights movement with Martin Luther
King but decades later enraged the
slain leader's supporters by writing
about his alleged infidelity, died yes
terday.
Abernathy, who had cradled the fal
len King's bloodied head after he was
struck down by a bullet in 1968, was
64.
Abernathy's heart stopped while he
was being prepared for a lung scan at
Crawford Long Hospital, said hospital
spokeswoman Tisha Burland.
"What they were trying to do was
detect if there was a blood clot in the
lungs ... but they never got to see,"
Ms. Burland said.
Abernathy was taken to an operating
room, but he was pronounced dead
there at 12:10 p.m. before doctors
could begin emergency life support
surgery, she said.
Ms. Burland quoted Dr. Kenneth
Scheidt, a nuclear medicine specialist
who was present for the scheduled lung
scan, as saying the test never began
and could not have contributed to
Abernathy's death.
Abernathy had been in the hospital
since last month for treatment of a
sodium deficiency. He had suffered
strokes in 1983 and 1986.
Abernathy spent his last months un
der bitter criticism from his colleagues
for passages in his 1989 autobiography,
"And The Walls Came Tumbling
Down." He wrote that King had spent
time with two women and had a violent
argument with one in the 24 hours
before his 1968 assassination.
But the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who
succeeded Abernathy as president of
the Southern Christian Leadership
Council, described Abernathy yester
day as "a faithful servant of the cause
of liberty and justice."
"I extend my love and support to
his family," he said.

King's son, Fulton County Commis
sioner Martin Luther King 111, called
Abernathy's death "a very tragic loss
to our nation."
"His total life and passion was his
support of Martin Luther King," said
former Mayor Andrew Young, another
key King aide in the movement. Young
said that if Abernathy had a weakness,
"it was trying to fill Martin Luther

King Jr.'s shoes after his death, and
that was an impossible task."
Abernathy was pastor of Atlanta's
West Hunter Street Baptist Church
and president emeritus of the SCLC,
which he founded with King in 1957
as a vehicle for the movement they
began with the 1955 bus boycott in
Montgomery, Ala.
Abernathy had said he had no desire

to lead the movement, preferring to
leave that role to the more charismatic
King. But two days after King's as
sassination, the remaining aides
picked him as SCLC president, accord
ing to King's wishes.
He left the SCLC presidency in 1977,
when he resigned to run for Congress.
He was defeated in the Democratic
primary.
