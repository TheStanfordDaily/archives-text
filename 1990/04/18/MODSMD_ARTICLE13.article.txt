# Moscow imposes economic sanctions on Lithuania

### 
MOSCOW (AP) - The Kremlin said
it was tightening the tap on Lit
huania's natural gas supply yesterday
and may cut oil and gasoline to the
Baltic republic for refusing to rescind
pro-independence laws, Lithuanian
leaders said.
But Lithuania's president called the
republic's decisions "irreversible" and
said an economic embargo will only
strengthen the resolve of Lithuanians.
"I hope it will consolidate our people
in our peaceful struggle," Vytautas
Landsbergis said in a broadcast inter
view.

Officials in Lithuania said they were
told of the reduction in a telegram
from the Soviet Union's gas network.
No official announcement came from
Moscow.
A telegram sent to Lithuania's gas
authority yesterday said: "Implement
ing the orders of the government of
the Soviet Union and those of the
state gas concern ... supplies of natural
gas to the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist
Republic will be sharply reduced from
the 17th of April."
President Bush said in Washington
the United States was "considering ap

propriate responses" if Soviet eco
nomic threats against Lithuania were
implemented. But he also said he did
not want to damage superpower rela
tions.
Landsbergis asked Bush on Tuesday
to make it clear to Gorbachev that an
economic embargo on Lithuania would
be an act of aggression, but he declined
to say if he thought Bush should cancel
a planned Washington summit with
Gorbachev in June.
In an interview from Vilnius with
Cable News Network, Landsbergis said
he expects to receive supplies from

neighboring Soviet republics and even
from Scandinavia, but was worried the
Soviet navy may interfere.
"I will ask President Bush to make
a very clear position as to Soviet Union
dealings against our country," the
Lithuanian leader said. "This very
clear position will be ... that it has no
right over ... Lithuania ... and all
dealings of such kind would be con
sidered forms of aggression.
"We have a real political, moral sup
port from other republics and it is
possible that we will get real support,"
he said.
