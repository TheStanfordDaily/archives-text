Council of Presidents
O A Clean Slate
(ยง) Four Our Future

FOUR OUR FUTURE is the slate
best prepared to lead a diverse
student body into Stanford's
Centennial Year.
Members of the slate will draw upon
rich pasts of involvement and leader
ship in a wide array of student organ
izations and will provide a represen

tative, competent Council of Presi
dents.
The slate is committed to offering
a voice to those sectors of the com
munity historically underrepresented
in the ASSU, such as women and stu
dents of color, a principle upon which
the People's Platform was founded.
But the vision of "Four Our Future"
is broad enough to include the inter
ests of all students on campus.
For Stanford's future, "Four Our
Future" is the best choice for Council
of Presidents.
