Amendment #2:
Fee refund elimination
® YES O NO
Amendment #3:
inflation-indexing
of general fee base
(§> YES O NO

The three constitutional amend
ments on this year's ballot are all de
signed to help student groups in need
of funding. All three merit approval.
The first removes the bureaucratic
hassle of getting on the ballot for
groups that received majority approval
in the previous spring's election, but
failed to capture 60 percent of the vote.
The second eliminates fee refunds
while still allowing those who object
to particular groups to reallocate their
money. The amendment restores the
integrity of the ASSU's method of
funding larger student organizations.
The third amendment goes a long
way toward helping smaller student
groups which rely on general-fee fund
ing.
