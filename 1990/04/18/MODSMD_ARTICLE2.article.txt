# Uncertain futures drain staff morale Many frustrated by budget process
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
The possible layoffs and dis
placements announced in Provost
James Rosse's statement Monday
have upset many of the Univer
sity's administrative staff.
In addition to the general fear
of being laid off, staff members
are frustrated with the budget re
duction process as a whole.
Rosse announced Monday that
between 150 and 200 employees
will likely lose their jobs, and
those who don't land other
campus jobs will be laid off be
ginning in September. The effects
of the budget cuts on staff will
probably be more pronounced in
those departments whose budgets
are largely devoted to paying staff
salaries.
In the Office of Residential Af
fairs, which is getting a 15 percent
cut, most staff members agree
that the department is doing the
best it can, given the size of the
cut and the time being allowed to
implement it. However, many are
unhappy about the uncertainty of

their future.
"There's a lot of frustration"
with the budget cuts, according
to Betty Walker, an office assis
tant in Residential Affairs. People
are "wondering if they will have
a job in the future."
The staff is generally well
informed, Walker said, but em
ployees do not have any definite
answers about what positions will
be cut.
Dan Ramirez, an administrative
assistant in the Office of Residen
tial Education, agrees with
Walker's assessment. "People are
very anxious" about the cuts, he
said.
"When you see another staff
member, you ask, 'What's the
latest percentage cut for your de
partment?' " he added.
Ramirez also noted a growing
sense of demoralization and
resentment among staff members.
Unlike many resident assistants
and fellows, staff members are de
pendent on their positions for
their livelihoods, he said.
