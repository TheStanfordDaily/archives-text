# Uncertain futures drain staff morale Many frustrated by budget process
## 
### Geoff Goldman Senior staff writer 
The possible layoffs and dis
placements announced in Provost
James Rosse's statement Monday
have upset many of the Univer
sity's administrative staff.
In addition to the general fear
of being laid off, staff members
are frustrated with the budget re
duction process as a whole.
Rosse announced Monday that
between 150 and 200 employees
will likely lose their jobs, and
those who don't land other
campus jobs will be laid off be
ginning in September. The effects
of the budget cuts on staff will
probably be more pronounced in
those departments whose budgets
are largely devoted to paying staff
salaries.
In the Office of Residential Af
fairs, which is getting a 15 percent
cut, most staff members agree
that the department is doing the
best it can, given the size of the
cut and the time being allowed to
implement it. However, many are
unhappy about the uncertainty of

their future.
"There's a lot of frustration"
with the budget cuts, according
to Betty Walker, an office assis
tant in Residential Affairs. People
are "wondering if they will have
a job in the future."
The staff is generally well
informed, Walker said, but em
ployees do not have any definite
answers about what positions will
be cut.
Dan Ramirez, an administrative
assistant in the Office of Residen
tial Education, agrees with
Walker's assessment. "People are
very anxious" about the cuts, he
said.
"When you see another staff
member, you ask, 'What's the
latest percentage cut for your de
partment?' " he added.
Ramirez also noted a growing
sense of demoralization and
resentment among staff members.
Unlike many resident assistants
and fellows, staff members are de
pendent on their positions for
their livelihoods, he said.
"The budget cuts and possible
layoffs are the overwhelming con
cern of most people in the office,"
he added.
Ramirez and Walker both said
they are concerned about the ef
fects of layoffs on the ethnic and
cultural diversity of the staff.
Ramirez said he is worried that
the brunt of staff cuts will come
from "non-exempt" positions,
which do not include higher-level
administrators.
Because many of the workers
in non-exempt positions are mem
bers of minority groups, Ramirez
said he wondered "what the work
force will look like" and how the
University's affirmative action
commitment will be affected.
Walker noted that many of the
most recent hirings by the Uni
versity have been minority staff
members, and these people could
be the first to go.
Staff in Human Resources Serv
ices, which faces a 30 percent
budget cut, have even stronger
feelings about the possible layoffs.
"We can't plan in advance be
cause we don't know if we will
have jobs next year," said one staff
member who wished to remain
anonymous. The lack of informa
tion "feels inhumane," she said.
Another staff member noted an
increasing amount of cynicism
and distrust of the administration

because of people's frustration
with the cuts. "People are really
distressed," he said.
Staff in Residential Affairs'
field offices, which are located in
almost every dormitory,
voiced concern that the budget
cuts might force Residential Af
fairs to consolidate or close their
offices. This would probably
result in the elimination of several
office workers' jobs.
Harriet Tower, field office co
ordinator for Toyon Hall, said she
is resigned to the fact that the
Toyon office will probably be
closed.
"I don't know anyone who isn't
worried," she said. "Everybody is
emotional" about the cuts.
Tower said Residential Affairs
is doing a good job of keeping
people informed, but she feels
frustrated by not knowing what
will ultimately happen to the
Toyon office and her job.
"I originally thought we were
being listened to, but now, maybe
not," she added.
She said the ongoing discussion
about budget cuts has become vi
cious and territorial. "People are
trying to protect their own posi
tions," she said.
The administration is taking
the easy way out by looking at
the number of positions that can
be cut instead of streamlining and
finding ways to reorganize, ac
cording to Rod Armstrong, a res
ident office coordinator in Stern
Hall.

'At first, I thought it
would be interest
ing to see the
budget-cutting
but now a lot of
people are getting
hurt.'
— Rod Armstrong

Armstrong, who graduated
from Stanford last year and said
his position will most likely be
cut, also noted that staff mem
bers' morale is down.
The low morale does not extend
to relations with students, how
ever. "We all love our jobs working
with students," he said.
"At first, I thought it would be
interesting to see the budget cut
ting process, but now a lot of
people are getting hurt,"
Armstrong said.
Kriss Ferrier, the resident office
coordinator in Roble Hall and a
member of the Residential Affairs
advisory committee, said she is
confused because of the lack of
direction for the budget cuts.
Currently, the committee is
"just throwing out ideas and
talking," Ferrier added. "Once we
get a clearer direction" and know
what to cut, the process will not
be as confusing, she said.

ting process, but now a lot of
people are getting hurt,"
Armstrong said.
Kriss Ferrier, the resident office
coordinator in Roble Hall and a
member of the Residential Affairs
advisory committee, said she is
confused because of the lack of
direction for the budget cuts.
Currently, the committee is
"just throwing out ideas and
talking," Ferrier added. "Once we
get a clearer direction" and know
what to cut, the process will not
be as confusing, she said.
The possible layoffs and dis
placements announced in Provost
James Rosse's statement Monday
have upset many of the Univer
sity's administrative staff.
In addition to the general fear
of being laid off, staff members
are frustrated with the budget re
duction process as a whole.
Rosse announced Monday that
between 150 and 200 employees
will likely lose their jobs, and
those who don't land other
campus jobs will be laid off be
ginning in September. The effects
of the budget cuts on staff will
probably be more pronounced in
those departments whose budgets
are largely devoted to paying staff
salaries.
In the Office of Residential Af
fairs, which is getting a 15 percent
cut, most staff members agree
that the department is doing the
best it can, given the size of the
cut and the time being allowed to
implement it. However, many are
unhappy about the uncertainty of

their future.
"There's a lot of frustration"
with the budget cuts, according
to Betty Walker, an office assis
tant in Residential Affairs. People
are "wondering if they will have
a job in the future."
The staff is generally well
informed, Walker said, but em
ployees do not have any definite
answers about what positions will
be cut.
Dan Ramirez, an administrative
assistant in the Office of Residen
tial Education, agrees with
Walker's assessment. "People are
very anxious" about the cuts, he
said.
"When you see another staff
member, you ask, 'What's the
latest percentage cut for your de
partment?' " he added.
Ramirez also noted a growing
sense of demoralization and
resentment among staff members.
Unlike many resident assistants
and fellows, staff members are de
pendent on their positions for
their livelihoods, he said.
"The budget cuts and possible
layoffs are the overwhelming con
cern of most people in the office,"
he added.
Ramirez and Walker both said
they are concerned about the ef
fects of layoffs on the ethnic and
cultural diversity of the staff.
Ramirez said he is worried that
the brunt of staff cuts will come
from "non-exempt" positions,
which do not include higher-level
administrators.
Because many of the workers
in non-exempt positions are mem
bers of minority groups, Ramirez
said he wondered "what the work
force will look like" and how the
University's affirmative action
commitment will be affected.
Walker noted that many of the
most recent hirings by the Uni
versity have been minority staff
members, and these people could
be the first to go.
Staff in Human Resources Serv
ices, which faces a 30 percent
budget cut, have even stronger
feelings about the possible layoffs.
"We can't plan in advance be
cause we don't know if we will
have jobs next year," said one staff
member who wished to remain
anonymous. The lack of informa
tion "feels inhumane," she said.
Another staff member noted an
increasing amount of cynicism
and distrust of the administration

because of people's frustration
with the cuts. "People are really
distressed," he said.
Staff in Residential Affairs'
field offices, which are located in
almost every dormitory,
voiced concern that the budget
cuts might force Residential Af
fairs to consolidate or close their
offices. This would probably
result in the elimination of several
office workers' jobs.
Harriet Tower, field office co
ordinator for Toyon Hall, said she
is resigned to the fact that the
Toyon office will probably be
closed.
"I don't know anyone who isn't
worried," she said. "Everybody is
emotional" about the cuts.
Tower said Residential Affairs
is doing a good job of keeping
people informed, but she feels
frustrated by not knowing what
will ultimately happen to the
Toyon office and her job.
"I originally thought we were
being listened to, but now, maybe
not," she added.
She said the ongoing discussion
about budget cuts has become vi
cious and territorial. "People are
trying to protect their own posi
tions," she said.
The administration is taking
the easy way out by looking at
the number of positions that can
be cut instead of streamlining and
finding ways to reorganize, ac
cording to Rod Armstrong, a res
ident office coordinator in Stern
Hall.

'At first, I thought it
would be interest
ing to see the
budget-cutting
but now a lot of
people are getting
hurt.'
— Rod Armstrong

Armstrong, who graduated
from Stanford last year and said
his position will most likely be
cut, also noted that staff mem
bers' morale is down.
The low morale does not extend
to relations with students, how
ever. "We all love our jobs working
with students," he said.
"At first, I thought it would be
interesting to see the budget cut
ting process, but now a lot of
people are getting hurt,"
Armstrong said.
