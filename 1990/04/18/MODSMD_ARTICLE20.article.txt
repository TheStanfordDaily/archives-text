## Stanford's next century 
### 
Ashanti hovered near the
ceiling, drinking in the words of
the gray-haired, feeble man, hoping
something he said would bring her back
to life. For years, University President
Donald Kennedy had given the annual
"Welcome" address to 1,600 exuberant
and naive freshmen, and as far as Ashanti
could tell, the class of 2014 was certainly
no less exuberant, and probably no less
naive.
As President of Stanford University,
Kennedy had given hundreds of speeches
all around the world. Weathered by time
and the hectic schedule of a leader of
one of the nation's top universities, he
summoned all his energy to deliver his
opening line: "Welcome to Stanford,
where all your dreams can come true."
For the past 20 years, Ashanti had
listened to Kennedy's speech. Each Octo
ber she returned to Memorial Auditori
um, searching for something that would
deliver her from her non-existence, but
nothing he said stirred even one blood
vessel in her decrepit, ragged body.
"Help me!" pleaded Ashanti, her cries
audible to no one but herself.
Kennedy was her last hope for life, but
he too was deaf. All that remained of
Ashanti was crippled bones and tattered
skin, and she could feel her body shred
with every word Kennedy spoke.
Over the years Kennedy's speech had
grown more stale and manufactured,
words stolen from somebody's cheap
handbook. It wasn't like the speech he
had given during Ashanti's freshman Ori
entation. That speech was filled with de
termination, sincerity and humanity. But

he had lost his humanity. He was dead
and didn't know it.
Kennedy's audience had changed con
siderably over the years. Gone were the
shades of hope and promise — the
browns, yellows and reds. Now, only
whites participated in the inaugurating
ritual.
Ashanti had once belonged to that elite
group. She had unknowingly sold her
soul in order to be a member. But that
was 20 years ago and no longer a reality.
Ashanti knew she could never again be
a part of The Great White Order.
Ironically, Ashanti used to think of
Stanford as her home. As a prospective
freshman of the class of 1994, she im
mediately fell in love with Stanford. Dur
ing her visit, she had heard about both
the Otero and Ujamaa incidents, but she
decided that she wouldn't let a few iso
lated incidents discourage her.
When Ashanti entered Stanford, only
8 percent of her classmates were black.
She had been told that there was a nation
wide decline in black applicants, but she
took comfort in the promise that soon
she would be joined by more of her broth
ers and sisters.
But it never happened. That year the
Devil came to collect on his debt. Dis
guised as the plague, he unleashed his
horrors on the black community. Ashanti
discovered that she was not the only one
who had sold her soul.
Each year the black population grew
smaller and smaller as the relentless
plavme destroyed students, faculty and
stsff. The University was rendered
powerless and could do nothing to help

By her senior year, As
hanti was the only black
person left alive, but she
continued to struggle
against the disease.

matters. Black people around the world
the world recognized the work of the
Devil, and for them, Stanford became a
syvnbol of evil.
By her senior year, Ashanti was the
only black person left alive, but she con
tinued to struggle against the disease,
while the University resigned itself to its
fate. Before she could graduate, Ashanti
succumbed to the plague.
And here she was left, caught some
where between the living and the dead,
denied the gift of life, and unable to know
the equanimity of death. If she could not
walk among the living, she wanted to be
dancing, singing and celebrating with her
own people.
Yet, she couldn't reach the afterworld
where her ancestors er\joyed freedom. In
stead she remained a prisoner, a slave
trapped on a plantation called Stanford.
