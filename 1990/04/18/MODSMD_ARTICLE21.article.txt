## People's Platform represents interests of black students 
### 
I would like to voice my concern
regarding the black community in the
ASSU elections. There have been many
statements made about broad represen
tation and inclusion in the past week.
However, it is hard to believe that all
of these assertions are true when there
exists a slate that does not include one
black candidate and has also not con
sulted with the BSU about which is
sues are important to our community
Does this complete absence of
African-American representation dem
onstrate lack of concern for black stu
dents or does it show that there are no
black students willing to run on and
embrace a platform of supposed diver
sity?
If we, Stanford, truly wish to unite
and bring together all students, then
black concerns must be a part of it.
Are we any less important than the
rest of the Stanford family?
The Black Student Union partici-

pated in the slating process for the
People's Platform, and we took great
care to ensure the representation of
the broadest possible array of Stanford
students.
The People's Platform includes candi
dates from the Pro-Choice Alliance, the
Rape Education Project, the Public
Service Center, the gay, lesbian and
bisexual community, and the Graduate
Concerns Committee as well as from
the Asian American Student Associa
tion, MEChA, BSU and the Stanford
American Indian Organization. It is
also running a slate of 10 graduate
senators. All of these candidates were
chosen zX meetings open to everyone.
It is my hope that Stanford will not
be fooled by mere assertions about
diversity and broad representation.
Real diversity does not come about by
merely saying it, for it must be re
flected in concrete results.
The struggles of black people in this
country have always been for inclusion
and thoroughgoing democracy. That is
the tradition that we come from and
why I see this election in terms of
demonstrated openness, inclusion and
respect.
