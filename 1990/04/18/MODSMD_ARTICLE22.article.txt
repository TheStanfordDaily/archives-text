# Stanford should not allow unlimited use of retirement funds
## 
### 
On April 3, The Daily's good front
page story about The Teachers Insur
ance and Annuity Association and Col
lege Retirement Equities fund quoted
me as saying the opposite of what I
said.
No way did I say it would be ir
responsible of Stanford to "allow
people to use Fidelity and Vanguard
funds."
What I said was that it's irrespon
sible if Stanford allows its people to

use any and all of such funds.
If Stanford still allows unlimited
freedom to put all retirement savings
into, say, a gold fund (or almost any of
the narrow "sector" funds), I submit it
is acting not only unwisely but render
ing itself subject to suit for failure of
fiduciary responsibility.
A university has its own stake, not
merely a paternal one, in assuring that
faculty have enough retirement savings
to leave, when the time comes, and
open slots for younger people. It also
has a fiduciary responsibility to fence
off savings vehicles that all knowledge
able persons would agree are impru
dent for retirement savings.
