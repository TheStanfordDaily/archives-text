Number of campaign
fliers goes against
environmental goals
With seven slates running for Senior
Class Presidents this year, students
need to have some handle on the is
sues and debates around the office.
Little of the information necessary for
individuals to make the right choices is
available. The Daily does not endorse a
slate, and most of the fliers in this
election are dominated by photos an1
not issues. Here is a quick list of some
of the important questions students
should demand the slates answer:
• Senior Class Presidents help choose
the Commencement speaker, yet no one
is talking about what the qualities of a
great speaker are or mentioning possi
ble names. Few decisions at this Uni
versity cause such consternation, and
no one understands that the time to
voice opinions is now. Marian Wright
Edelman says a lot about our slate and
our values. If you elect a slate that
wants Donald Trump for Commence
ment, will you be happy?

• Ethnic minority seniors have tradi
tionally been underrepresented at class
events. Only recently have traditions
been re-evaluated and altered, but
nothing guarantees that the recent
trends will continue.
If a slate decides to have Pub Nights
at Old Pros every week, only a limited
part of the class will participate. If
every party is a beer fest, many will
not bother showing up. The slate
should have specific changes in mind
that will involve long-neglected popula
tions.
• The presidents help run the Com
mencement Weekend events. We are
working with the Chapel to restructure
Baccalaureate along more inclusive,
non-sectarian lines. The presidents also
choose the speakers for Class Day. Our
choices of Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Jean Fetter, Civil Engineering
Prof. Gil Masters and English Prof.
Arturo Islas reflect our beliefs and our
experiences.
• Cultural events have recently joined
the class calendar. This year we went
to Les Miserables and ran campus
sculpture tours. If this sounds like
something you wish the presidents to
organize, tell them. If you don't, noth

ing will force them to be cultural.
• Public service events, like cultural
events, are new. Unless you vote for a
slate that plans to continue this, these
events will disappear. A structure with
the financial resources of the presi
dents could easily put a couple hun
dred dollars into arranging socially
conscious activities, they wanted to.
• One president sits on the Alumni
Executive Board and helps steer that
multi-million dollar organization. He
gets full voting and speaking privileges
and has the power to persuade the
Alumni Association on important is
sues.
• Finally, if the new presidents are
extremely well-organized and very effi
cient, they will spend about 15 hours a
week per person on the presidency. If
they are disorganized, these hours will
multiply. As the job is unpaid, the
inefficient slates will run fewer activi
ties. You will want to ask these slates
how much time they plan to dedicate
to the office.
These are just a few of the issues
which confronted us this year and will
face next year's presidents. Irritatingly,
no one is talking about these ques
tions.

Take the power of the vote in your
hands and make an informed choice.
It's hard to find the answers or even
the questions, but the effort will be
worth it. Call us with questions! We
will be happy to talk to you at 723-
6332.

1989-90 Senior Class Presidents
Neglected Senior
Class issues need
to be discussed
Earth Day 1990 has encouraged an
increase in campus awareness of envi
ronmental issues. The ASSU is on£ of
the many University organizations
which has pledged its support for the
implementation of "environmentally
sensitive" practices, as stated in The
Daily's April 13 issue.
Environmental advocacy has become
an issue in the upcoming ASSU elec-

tions, with slates such as Students
First endorsing "real changes that
make the University more environmen
tally responsible."
The widespread posting of campaign
literature by individual candidates and
slates seems contradictory to such ad
mirable sentiments. The deluge of cam
paign fliers inundates voters with
names of slates and senate candidates,
rarely mentioning goals.
Not only does this seem to be a
tremendous excess of consumption, but
it also is unnecessary in light of the
comprehensive Spring Elections Hand
book which explains candidates' posi
tions' in full detail.
It is time for the ASSU to set an
example for the Stanford community
by living up to its professed support
for improving the environment. If fliers
are to remain a focal point of cam
paign strategy, then at the.very least
candidates should be accountable for
the removal and recycling of each and
every one of their fliers after the elec
tions.
