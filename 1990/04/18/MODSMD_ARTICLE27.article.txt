«Why does newspaper ink get all
• over your hands, and what is the
Examiner's secret formula for a no-mess
newspaper?

A. John Moriarty, printing plant man
• ager for the Examiner, was happy
to let me in on the secret. He said that
newspapers (including The Daily) are
printed by the letterpress process, which
uses an ink containing carbon black (fine
particles of soot) as a pigment, suspended
in a mineral oil base. The base provides
a vehicle for the pigment and lubricates
some of the moving parts of the press.
When the ink is printed onto the
papier, the oil soaks in, leaving the car
bon black particles loosely embedded
among the fibers at the surface of the
paper. With nothing holding the pigment
in place, it rubs off easily, leaving those
Junior G-man fingerprints everywhere.
Moriarty went on to explain that the
Examiner is starting to use new
Flexigraphic presses, which have fewer
moving parts and use water-soluble ink.
The carbon black in this ink is suspended
in a base very similar to latex
housepaint. When this ink in printed on
paper, chemicals in the base react to
form a hard glue-like plastic, perma
nently bonding the pigment to the paper.
With the pigment glued to the paper
fibers, instead of resting on top of them,
it can't rub off on your hands, so
goodbye Elliot Ness.
Q, Please settle an argument we're
• having in our lab: If one heats a
metal washer, does the hole in the
middle get bigger or smaller?
A # When we here at Science Bug Re
• search Park first thought about
this problem, the Shrinky-Dink Theory
was proposed to predict the outcome.
This theory claimed that, like a heated
plastic Shrinky-Dink, the washer would

change size uniformly, and you would
end up with a perfectly proportioned
washer slightly larger than its original
size with a correspondingly larger hole
in the middle.
Although this seemed correct, the dan
ger of reasoning by analogy is that some
one may come up with a reasonable
counter-analogy, and this is precisely
what happened. The heretics proposed
the Blood-Pressure Cuff Theory, main
taining that,, like a blood-pressure cuff
being pumped full of air, the expansion
of the washer makes the hole get smaller,
squeezing anything which might be in it.
When the shouting subsided, we
decided to abandon thought experiments
and resort to empiricism: we heated a
washer in a bunsen burner and saw that
the hole got bigger (it fit over a bolt
that was too big when the washer was
cold). Three cheers for the scientific
method.
