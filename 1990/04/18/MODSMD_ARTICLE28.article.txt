# Immune system fights cancer
## 
### Elizabeth Palmberg 
In the not-so-distant future, brain
tumors may be fought, not with drugs
and radiation, but by the victim's own
body — with a little help from bacteria.
Dr. Frances Conley, professor of
neurosurgery, has found that injecting
a killed bacteria into the brain can stim
ulate the immune system to fight can
cerous brain tumors.
Normally, when the body's immune
system detects a foreign material, or
antigen, it is picked up by scavenger
cells called macrophages. These cells
take the antigen to other immune cells,
the T helper cells, which begin churning
out a chemical called interleukin 2. This
substance signals the immune system
to send out three kinds of commando
cells to annihilate intruders.
The immune system normally attacks
cancerous brain tumors, but with too
few cells to be effective. The net result,
says Conley, is that the brain says to
the tumor, "Welcome aboard! You grow
until you kill both of us."
However, certain infections stimulate
increased immune activity that can help
ward off not only the infection but also
unrelated cancerous tumors.
Conley, a Stanford graduate, experi
mented with one such protective agent,
toxoplasma gondii. This parasitic infec
tion has the unusual ability to pass
through the protective filter around the
brain. "The blood-brain barrier," ac
cording to Conley, "is something that
God devised to protect the brain from
all sorts of evils."
When toxoplasma enters the brain, it
brings with it immune cells that can
then attack a tumor. Conley found that
injecting toxoplasma into the cir
culatory system of mice provided protec
tion against brain tumors.
Toxoplasma, which is carried by about
half of the population and spread by
cats, is easily kept under control by a
healthy immune system. For thot-" with
a suppressed immune n, such .
people infected with the AIDS virus,

toxoplasma can be fatal. As AIDS be
came a widespread problem, Conley and
her team decided to look for an alter
native to toxoplasma.
They found Corynebacterium par
vum. "C. parvum hypes the immune
system the same as toxoplasma does,
but you don't have to have a live or
ganism to do it," Conley explains. Dead
bacteria pose no risk of infection to
even the weakest immune systems.
Unlike toxoplasma, C. parvum cannot
cross the blood-brain barrier. To Conley,
who is a practicing neurosurgeon as
well as a researcher, the obvious solu
tion was to simply inject the killed bac
teria into the brain rather than the
blood.
When Conley injected C. parvum and
additional interleukin-2 into the brains
of mice with highly malignant tumors,
her team achieved a cure rate of 60 to
80 percent.
According to Conley, a potential new
treatment is important because brain
tumors are still being treated in the
same way that they were when she went
into neurosurgery 27 years ago. The
three current treatments — surgery, ra
diation and chemotherapy — usually do
not prolong life more than a year or
two. The average survival is nine
months.
Moreover, tumors tend to strike

patients "who are at their most produc
tive ages — between 35 and 60. So it
takes a very, very productive element
of society away," says Conley.
However, she cautions that the treat
ment is still in a very crude form. For
one thing, the immune response to the
killed C. parvum causes inflammation
in the brain, which poses a far more
serious problem to humans than to
mice. "Humans use their brains more,"
explains Conley.
Nevertheless, the results with mice
were promising enough to warrant a
Food and Drug Administration study of
the treatment's use in humans. This
study has just begun its initial phase,
which is examining the toxicity of the
injections. A later phase will test their
effectiveness. It may be many years
before the treatment is ready for wide
spread use.
Eventually, Conley would like to elim
inate the infectious agent from the
treatment altogether. She and her team
are trying to isolate the particular kinds
of immune cells that actually battle the
tumor. Their long-term goal is to extract
the key types of immune cells from a
tumor, culture them, and inject a large
dose of them back into the tumor —
killing cancer with the body's own
defenses.
