# Green consumerism: the other side of the recycling story
## 
### Jessica Hirst Staff writer 
Source separation of materials
into green barrels is only half the
recycling story.
In order for the recycling proc
ess to be complete, those materials
must be processed into new goods
and purchased, according to
Beverly Loßuglio of Students for
Environmental Action at Stan
ford.
Central Stores, the main source
of supplies for the University, has
been actively promoting the use
of recycled products through spe
cial announcements in its
mailings and the addition of the
code "EP," meaning "Environ
mentally Preferred," for those
items that are recycled, recyclable
or otherwise deemed less harmful
than other alternatives.
Says the "Central Stores News":
"Just as Stanford takes a leader
ship role in the world of research
and education, Stanford Central
Stores wants to take a leadership
role in the responsible acquisition
and distribution of products."
University President Donald
Kennedy has endorsed the use of
recycled paper where it is econom
ically possible. The University has
no official procurement policy for
recycled goods, although Califor
nia law requires newspapers to

use 25 percent recycled paper by
1991 and 50 percent by the year
2000.
Central Stores reported that
purchase of recycled products rose
steadily in the first five months
of sales, which began in July.
Since December there has been a
significant multiplication of or
ders, about four to five times, said
Susan Muroshige, Central Stores'
customer service manager.
She credits the increased
demand to the growing environ
mental awareness surrounding
Earth Day 1990 and the encour
agement from Stores and stu
dents. Recycled paper orders are
still a small percentage of the total
orders Stores receives.
Stanford offices and depart
ments are primarily concerned
with the price, quality, image and
availability of recycled paper. The
President's Office does not use
recycled paper for its mailings,
citing the needs for mass quanti
ties of paper on short notice and
high quality letterhead bond
paper as obstacles.
On the first issue, Stores has
not kept large quantities of
recycled paper on hand because
of uncertain demand. If steady
demand were assured, it could
presumably keep more in stock.
As for the printed letterhead
paper, News and Publications

does supply recycled bond paper
on request and, although it is
more expensive than virgin paper,
demand is growing as the word
spreads.
Price is a key issue in the use
of recycled paper at Stanford, par
ticularly in light of imminent
budget cuts. The prices for
recycled paper from Conservatree,
the San Francisco supplier for
Central Stores, are higher than
those of virgin paper from Xerox
for several reasons.
On a national scale, the gov
ernment uses taxes to subsidize
logging, resulting in artificially
low paper prices. There are no
such subsidies for recycled paper
processing.
Second, the United States lacks
sufficient capacity to process all
the wastepaper collected by the
recycling programs springing up
around the nation. Pacific Rim
countries buy U.S. wastepaper
and process it into new goods
which can then be exported to
compete with U.S. goods.
On a local scale, economies of

scale cause the problems. Demand
for recycled paper has been low
relative to virgin paper, so prices
on recycled paper have been high.
If demand increases and becomes
consistent, Stores could buy
recycled paper in bulk and receive
quantity discounts. Prices on
recycled paper are indeed falling
as demand picks up.
Unfortunately, the price differ
ence between recycled and virgin
paper has not narrowed enough
to result in a full-scale switch to
recycled paper. The price of a
ream of recycled xerographic
copier paper has steadily dropped
since the fall, decreasing the price
difference from about 55 cents a
ream to 15 cents.
From winter into spring, how
ever, Xerox prices have fallen
more than proportionately,
leaving the price difference close
to 70 cents per ream. The reasons
for the Xerox price cut could be
due to the glut in the paper mar
ket from cutting of old growth
forests in the U.S. and abroad,
and also because of the increased
competition from recycled paper.
"I think there are a lot of image
problems with recycled paper,"
said junior Steve Kafka, who
worked at the Environmental
Protection Agency's Office of
Management and Budget in the
Natural Resources Division. Min

imum impact paper is an off-white
color because it is not re-bleached
with chlorine bleach that produces
the toxic dioxin made infamous
by the Love Canal incident in the
19605.
Asked why he thinks people are
hesitant to use the paper, Kafka
said, "It looks kind of granola."
Proponents of recycled paper are
trying to turn around the image
of dioxin-producing bright white
paper as "clean" and unbleached
recycled paper as "dirty." White
recycled paper is now available
for those who are not convinced.
Less bleach is required the second
time around, so less dioxin is
produced.
Further image difficulties stem
from warnings on Xerox high
speed copiers that use of "lower
grade paper" could result in me
chanical difficulties. However, in
a recent customer test of Conser
vatree recycled high speed
xerographic paper, 200,000 sheets
ran non-stop on a Xerox 9500
copier with one-tenth the number
of jams experienced with virgin
paper.
Dwayne Virnau, coordinator of
the engineering microcomputer
cluster, does not let price or image
deter him. The cluster has
switched completely to recycled
paper in its dot matrix printers.
Virnau pays up to $4 more on a

box of 2,500 sheets than he would
for virgin paper, but he sees it as
a worthwhile educational expen
diture.
Stacy Black of the Political Sci
ence Department reports that the
price difference is too high for
purchase of recycled paper to be
cost-effective at this time. Quality
and image are not the problem.
If the difference were less she
would order the paper, but prices
probably will not drop unless
more people order the paper at
current prices. "It's a Catch-22,
essentially," she said.
William Kovacs pointed out in
"Pulp and Paper," a leading paper
industry publication, that free
market forces of increased
demand for recycled paper cannot
bring the price into competition
with virgin paper because the
paper market is not free. Years
of tax advantages, subsidies, the
current wastepaper disposal crisis
and the image of recycled paper
mean that no one knows the true
cost of virgin paper or the true
benefits of recycled goods.
The government has to either
eliminate subsidies of virgin paper
or implement procurement poli
cies that provide incentive for use
of recycled paper. Says Loßuglio,
"the government has to address
it or the market imbalance will
never be resolved."
