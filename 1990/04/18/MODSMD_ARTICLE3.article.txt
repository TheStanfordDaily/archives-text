# Time commitments up, RA applicants down
## 
### Mike Habata Staff writer 
When Claire Dolan of Residen
tial Education checked through
the resident assistant applications
after the official deadline recently,
she discovered that the number
of applications was down 21 per
cent from two years ago.
At the Undergraduate Advising
Center, the number of advising
associate applications took a 50

percent drop two years ago and
has not risen since then.
Other indicators of extracurric
ular participation at Stanford,
however, point toward a
tremendous growth in student
community involvement. At the
Haas Public Service Center, Stu
dent Organization Services and

the Center for Teaching and
Learning, there has been an un
paralleled increase in public and
community service.
Long-time campus observers
say that the differing participa
tion trends reveal how the inter
ests of the student body as a whole
are changing. Overall, they say,
students are less interested in
traditional programming and
more often are opting for
community-oriented service.

At the same time, some say,
students are becoming more
serious academically — and per
sonally — amid increasing time
commitments and financial re
sponsibilities.
Too difficult a task?
The decline in RA applications
over the past five-year period has
forced resident fellows and Res
Ed officials to speculate whether
the RA position is too demanding.
One possible reason for this
decrease is the variety of other
available opportunities. "Cer
tainly being an RA is a
commitment of time and energy,"
Roble Hall RF Ann Porteus said.
Besides such traditional posi
tions as resident assistant, there
are many opportunities available
in the areas of music, art, athletics
and public service, both inside and
outside the Stanford community.
Indeed, students such as varsity
athletes hardly have time to be
RAs, according to Assoc. Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions John
Bunnell. "You don't become a
championship swimmer by being
on call to other students 24 hours
a day,"he noted.
In fact, the role of the RA has
recently been criticized as too de
manding. In an article entitled
"RAs At Any Price?" published
last month, the eminent Chronicle
of Higher Education speculated
that the position has become so
difficult that it may need to be
abandoned.
Denis Phillips, an RF at Twain,
criticized the "low compensation"
offered to RAs. He invoked images
of "slave labor" and said "maybe
Stanford ought to raise their

salary a bit."
These charges of inadequate fi
nancial compensation take place
amid an increasing sense of finan
cial responsibility in the student
body. "When people are paying
$100,000 for four years of college,
the system will tend to select for
those who take things seriously,"
Soto RF John Perry said. Stu
dents need to work more to cover
tuition and living costs, and thus
may have less time for being RAs.
However, there is general con
sensus among RFs that although
the RA applicant pool may be
shrinking, the quality of appli
cants has not suffered as a result.
They describe current RAs as
"dynamite," "fabulous" and
"incredible."
Changing interests
Another troubling indicator for
Res Ed is the decline in attend
ance at dorm and house programs.
"Students don't seem to have
as much time for Res Ed programs
anymore. They seem more inter
ested in studying at the library,"
said Porteus.
Valerie Phillips, RF at Twain
for six years, agreed, "There is a
greater concern with academics
among Stanford students."
However, Perry and Kennell
Jackson, Branner Hall RF for 10
years, find it difficult to make
long-term generalizations. But
that "isn't to say they don't exist,"
Perry said.

"I don't see that Res Ed has
one unified mission .. . other than
those of the University at large,"
Perry explained.
One possible answer for the
decline in Res Ed program attend
ance is that there is so much going
on around campus on any typical
evening that "all these offerings
are in competition for student at
tention," said Michael Ramsey-
Perez, director of Student
Organization Services.
In addition to an increased
number of night courses and dis
cussion sections, there are a large
number of cam pus wide lectures
and programs offered on weekday
nights, which is the prime time
for programs offered by dorms
and houses. "Just because you
don't have a sell-out audience that
doesn't mean that people aren't
interested in the topic," Ramsey-
Perez said.
Changing advising role?
One alternative to the resident
assistant position for students is
that of the advising associate, a
program operated by the Under
graduate Advising Center. How
ever, the two programs are
different, both in terms of their
focus and time commitment.
"Our program is really an aca
demic one," said Andree Sursock,
assistant director of the advising
center. "Being an AA doesn't take
a great deal of time [like the RA
position], and it allows you to be

more academically serious."
Sursock explained that during
the 1987-88 year, the AA applicant
pool took a 50 percent decline, but
she insists that such figures are
misleading. The previous year, AA
applicants were required to sub
mit their academic transcripts
along with their applications.
Sursock said she believes that
this requirement influenced appli
cants "who were not academically
serious ... and not very inter
ested in the academic part of being
an AA" to not apply.
Sursock believes the program
is benefitting from the change in
the applicant pool and is better
able to serve the freshman class.
Public service booms
Meanwhile, at the 5-year-old
public service center, better or
ganization of public service re
sources at Stanford, as well as a
national trend of greater student
participation in the community,
has led to "an incredible explosion
in community and public service,"
according to director Catherine
Milton.
According to the results of two
independent surveys of last year's
Senior Class, Milton said, 87 per
cent of the student body was in
volved in some form of community
service during their four years at
Stanford, as compared to 50 per
cent five years ago.
Not only are students becoming
more involved, according to Mil

ton, but "they are arriving at
Stanford with an increased
sophistication . . . that is con
nected with intellectual ability."
"It is apparent that bright stu
dents who care about issues can
be influenced a lot," she added.
Milton speculated that students
today have a greater sense of
"responsibility for the here and
now," as compared to 20 or 30
years ago, when the sense was
that "tomorrow will take care of
itself."
"There is no way to limit stu
dent activities here at Stanford.
The ethos of this place is to go
for it. We want students to be
involved in the active pulsing life
of the community . . . not be spe
cialized idiots" who only know
how to study, Ramsey-Perez said.
However, he admits there are
drawbacks to this philosophy.
"People are not working on
their internal lives," which comes
through quiet reflection, reading
and conversation with friends, he
said. "There is little celebration
of individuality."
There are some who agree with
Ramsey-Perez's assessment.
Valerie Phillips suggests that stu
dents lack "a freedom of spirit"
that existed 20 years ago. She
would prefer to see less necessary
sections in the evenings, more
time to talk about issues and more
time spent exploring in the libra
ries rather than studying.
