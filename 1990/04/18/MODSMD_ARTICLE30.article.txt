## Close call Netters pull off 5-4 defeat of Utes after Stark sidelined 
### Greg Gottesman Senior staff writer 
Someone better catch the black cat running
around Stanford Tennis Stadium before the men's
team actually starts losing.
Indeed, Stanford suffered its worst blow of the
season an hour before yesterday's match when it
was announced that the best player on the Cardinal
team and the No. 2-ranked player in the country,
Jonathan Stark, would havs to sit out because of
a stress fracture to his left foot. According to Coach
Dick Gould, Stark will be sidelined for at least two
weeks and will miss the upcoming road matches
against USC and UCLA.

Cardinal 5
Utes 4 *

With Stark on the bench and No. 3-ranked player
Jared Palmer still recovering from knee surgery,
Utah stepped into Stanford Tennis Stadium yester
day with real hopes of upsetting the No. 1-ranked
Cardinal.
The Utes almost pulled it off, losing 5-4 in a
four-and-a-half hour struggle. The match was tied
3-3 after singles.
"It's just a nice one to get this one out of the
way," Asst. Coach John Whitlinger said.
At No. 1 singles, Alex O'Brien, who is ranked
No. 10 in the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Rankings,
filled in for Stark more than admirably, scoring a
6-2, 6-2 win over Chris Entzel.
"I played a lot better today than I have been [in
the last three matches]," O'Brien said. "I tried to
concentrate the whole match today. I wanted to get
out there and take care of business.
"In the second set, I tried to concentrate extra
hard in the first few games. I wanted to make sure
I got on top early [in the second]."
At No. 2 singles, Jeff Cathrall played a solid first
set but was moonballed to death in the second and
third. The Cardinal senior eventually fell to Johan
Hogstedt 2-6, 6-1, 7-5.
Glenn Solomon continued to play more aggres

sively from the baseline, downing Brandon Bowyer
6-3, 6-3 at No. 3 singles.
"[Bowyer] was doing some different things out
there today. He tried to drop shot me twice on
service returns. But I didn't let it bother me,"
Solomon said. "I have been playing more aggressive
from the baseline [in the last three matches]. I felt
good out there."
Despite winning the first set at love and having
two match points in the second-set tiebreaker, Alexis
Hombrecher fell at No. 4 singles 0-6, 7-6, 6-3.
"I played a good first set, but, after that, I sort
of fell asleep," Hombrecher said. "When you have
two match points, you should win the match. I
didn't.
"In the third set, I was probably a little upset
about losing the second. He broke me once, and I
just couldn't break him back."
At No. 5 singles, Jason Yee continued to play
beyond expectations, crushing Chris Reilly 6-3, 6-3.
"I try to do whatever it takes [to win]," Yee said.
"With Jon and Jared out, I know I have to go in
there and do the job. I just try to concentrate hard
and hang in there mentally."
John Connolly, who found out only an hour before
the match that he would play No. 6 singles, fell to
Jorgen Lindeman 6-4, 6-2.
Tied at 3-3 and with its two top doubles players
injured, the Cardinal had its back against the wall
going into the doubles.
O'Brien and Yee, however, quickly dispatched
Reilly and Lindeman at No. 2 doubles 6-2, 6-1 to
give Stanford a 4-3 lead.
Cathrall and Hombrecher, who had won in their
previous five outings as a doubles team, subse
quently overpowered Bowyer and Entzel, the No.
34-ranked team in the country, 6-4, 7-5. The win
at the No. 1 doubles spot gave Stanford the dual
meet victory.
Despite the close match and the injuries to two
of their superstars, the Cardinal players are still
extremely confident heading into the final portion
of the season.
"On the positive side, this is a great opportunity
for some of these other guys to see what they can
do," Gould said. "We just can't take anything for
granted from now on."
