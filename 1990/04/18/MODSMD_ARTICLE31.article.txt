# Card nine a real hit at Santa Clara
## 
### Cameron Macky Senior staff writer 
If you've got half an arm, one
good eye and a decent curve, give
Santa Clara Coach John Oldham
a call. He needs the help.
In yet another midweek game
from a scorekeeper's nightmare,
Oldham's pitching staff hurled its
way into the record books yester
day against the Stanford Cardinal
at Buck Shaw Stadium.

Baseball

I Cardinal 10
| Broncos 3

Did Oldham's pitchers — eight
of whom saw action — set a record
for strikeouts? Not quite. Walks?
Nope. Hits allowed? Nah, but
you're getting warm. Hit batters?
There you go!
The Bronco pitchers hit six
Stanford players yesterday,
propelling the Cardinal into the
Pacific 10 Conference record book
for most batters hit in a game.
(California had six HBP's in a
game against Tulane in 1987.) All
told, 13 Stanford batters have
been hit in the team's last four
games.
"I couldn't believe it," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said after
yesterday's game, which Stanford
won 10-3 to run its record to 35-7.
"I've never seen that many [hit
batters]/'
"It's not like they were throw
ing at us, either," Asst. Coach
Dean Stotz said. In fact, the rea
son no one got really ticked off
about the apparent target practice
was because most of the hits came
on off-speed pitches that were just
a bit ofT the mark.
Two of the knocks — one on
Tim Griffin with the bases loaded
(yes, that's an RBI) and one on
Troy Paulsen — came on pitches
that bounced in the dirt a good
five feet in front of the plate, and
three of them came in a single
inning.
Yuck.

On the Cardinal side pitcher
Brian Sackinsky, who had looked
shaky in his previous two outings
(most recently against Cal on Sat
urday), finally seemed to shake
off his problems. "Brian hadn't
pitched real well the last two
times out, so we wanted to give
him the extra work," Marquess
said. "We wanted to get him right
back out there."
Sackinsky (who gave up only
two runs through five to go 5-0
on the season), along with Rob
Kamerschen and Jamie Sepeda,
who both put in two innings of
work, looked just fine. As for the
Broncos..
Tuttle actually had a decent day,
at least compared to his team
mates. He gave up only a walk
and a double in his two innings
but was then pulled, mainly be
cause the Broncos hadn't played
in 10 days, and Oldham wanted

to give everyone on the staff some

Either that or he wanted to
prolong the agony of the game,
which he did quite well: with all
the changes the game only took
three and a half hours to play,
and really wasn't worth the time.
The Cardinal picked up its first

run off David Currie (pitcher No.
2 for those of you keeping score)
on a Paul Carey sacrifice fly in
the third. An inning later, Currie
gave up three straight singles
(including one to Jeff Hammonds
— that's 36 games and counting)


Al Green — Daily file
Tim Griffin was hit only twice by Bronco pitchers yesterday during
the Cardinal's 10-3 victory. He managed to get a hit and two RBIs,
anyway.
and was yanked in favor of Mark
Fabela, who walked two batters,
surrendered another sac fly to
Carey, and then gave up a single.
Bye-bye, Cardinal up 6-1.
Pitcher No. 4, Ryan Brust,
brought an air of sanity to the
game by giving up only one hit
over the next two innings, but
then Vince Fultz came on, and,
well, threw his ERA into the
sewer. One-third of an inning,
three hits, two walks, four runs
— including a two-run homer by
Roger Burnett, his fifth in the
last two weeks.
No. 6 (look in the box score if
you want his name) came on to
clean up the mess, but then in
the eighth Jim "Mr. Curve" Flynn
hit three batters to load the bases.
Then he struck out Carey — who
by that time looked thoroughly
disgusted with the entire game —
on three called strikes.
Whatever.
