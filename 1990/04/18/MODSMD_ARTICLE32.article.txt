Rugby makes playoffs
For the second year in a row, the fate
of the Cardinal rugby team came down
to its final game of the season — against
Humbolt State. A win, the team would
advance to playoffs. A loss and the
season would be finished.
For the second time in two years,
Stanford earned a trip to post-season
play.
Wednesday the Stanford rugby
team traveled to Humboldt and handily
beat the Lumberjacks 27-10, earning its
second trip in a row to the regional
play-offs. The victory capped a success
ful season of league play for the Cardi
nal, which finished 8-2 on the year.
According to Coach Franck Boivert,

the combination of not playing rugby
during dead week, finals week and
spring break caused the team to return
"out of synch."
However, the ruggers appeared to
have gotten it back together as they
quickly took a 15-3 lead against the
Lumberjacks. "It is the first 20 minutes
that set the tone for the rest of the
match," Boivert stated. "I felt we came
out hard and hungry for the win —
that gave us the initial advantage."
Tries scored by Raj Atluru, Joe Croft
and Simon Fleming-Wood fueled the
Cardinal attack. In addition, Brian
Jewitt accumulated 15 points against
the Lumberjacks, going six for seven on
a near perfect day as he converted three
of four penalty kicks and all three con
version kicks.

The Stanford ruggers are looking to
extend the success that they have en
joyed during the 1990 season as they
travel to Tri-City, Wash, this weekend
to compete in a pool of the top eight
teams in the Western region of the U.S.
