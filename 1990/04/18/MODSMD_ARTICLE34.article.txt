# Swimmers once again nab nation's brightest
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
After signing perhaps the top
class of recruits in the history
of women's collegiate swim
ming last season, Cardinal
Coach Richard Quick is start
ing right where he left off.
Quick announced yesterday
that both Summer Sanders and
Pam Minthorn have already
signed letters of intent to enroll
at Stanford in the fall, and he
said he has also received verbal
commitments from four other
swimmers. Sanders, of
Roseville, Calif., is widely con
sidered to be the top recruit in
the nation while Minthorn was
the 1989 U.S. champion in two
different events.
Current freshmen Janet
Evans and Janel Jorgensen
each won three individual
events at last month's NCAA
Championships and combined
with classmate Lori Heisick to
score 226V2 of the Cardinal's
points. The total of
226V2 would have placed the
freshman trio fifth in the team
standings.
Sanders finsihed 1989
ranked third in the world in
the 200-meter butterfly and
won both the 200-yard butter
fly and the 400 individual med
ley at the U.S. Short Course
Nationals in Nashville, Tenn.,
last month. She also placed sec
ond in the 100 butterfly and
the 200 IM at that meet.
She was the number two
overall point-scorer in that
meet behind Nicole Haislett of
Plantation, Fla., another high
school senior.
"I'm very excited about her
being part of our Stanford team
because she is an extremely
talented and versatile athlete,"
Quick said. "It's going to be

very exciting to watch her
develop into even more of a
world-caliber swimmer."
Sanders, whose final choices
were Stanford, Texas and Cal
ifornia, said she verbally com
mitted to come to the Farm
back in December.
"I knew a long time ago that
I wanted to go to Stanford,"
said Sanders, who said her de
cision was based on, "mostly
academics. I like the team, al
though Texas' team â€” I had
a lot of fun there with them.
It was mainly just school. . . .
There's just no competition be
tween Texas and Stanford, the
universities that is."
Sanders is also glad to be
coming to a school with a top
flight team. "I'm excited to be
part of the team," she said.
"It's going to be exciting to go
to NCAAs with a big team. . . .
It'll be different having so
many people on my team who
are on the same level."
Minthorn, from Washington,
D.C., missed most of her senior
season due to illness. Before
that, however, she was one of
the top butterfliers in the coun
try. She won both the 100 and
200 butterflies at the U.S. Long
Course Nationals in August of
1989.
"Pam has been sick her
senior year and hasn't been
heard of as much," Quick said.
"She's better now and back in
training. Her coaches are high
on her progress right now."
Minthorn is also an out
standing distance freestyler
and placed second to Evans in
both the 500 and 1000 frees
tyles at the U.S. Short Course
Nationals in March, 1989.
According to Quick, the ad
dition of Sanders and Minthorn
will give his team much more
versatility.
