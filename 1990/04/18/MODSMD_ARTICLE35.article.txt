# Students First's COP slate:
## Opponents' tactics not too clean 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
Members of the Students First
Council of Presidents slate have
alleged that the People's Platform
has been engaging in unfair cam
paign tactics.
According to junior Mike Canul,
"A Clean Slate" member, the
People's Platform scheduled
debates and informational meet
ings without adequately inform
ing Students First and has
engaged in unfair publicity tactics.
According to Canul, last quarter
the Students First COP slate sug
gested a series of debates between
the two COP slates to take place
during the week before the elec
tion.
"We received no feedback from
the People's Platform slate con
cerning the debates," Canul said.
Because of this, the Students First
slate assumed that the only
debates to take place were those
sponsored by the ASSU Elections
Commission, Canul explained.
Students First campaign coor
dinator Jean Park said she was
surprised when current COP
member Chin-Chin Chen notified
her last Monday that the People's
Platform had scheduled a series
of informational meetings and
debates to take place last week.
"Since we received no response
from the People's Platform con
cerning our suggestion for such
meetings, we assumed that none
would be scheduled," Park said.
"We tried to be as accommodat

ing as we could, but by that time
we had already scheduled a lot of
activities that conflicted," Park
explained. According to Park, the
People's Platform planned the
meetings and debates on its own,
excluding Students First from the
entire process.
Park told Chen that although
Students First would have liked
to participate, their late notifica
tion and exclusion from the plan
ning process would not allow for
their participation.
Chen said this issue was more
the result of honest miscom
munication than dirty campaig
ing. "We've always assumed that
a COP slate would keep its calen
dar clear the week before elections
in order to allow for debates and
informational meetings," Chen
said.
Students First members are not
only upset with scheduling prob
lems. They say they are equally
concerned with the publicity and
advertising of the People's Plat
form.
One particular flier publicized
an informational meeting with
the endorsement of the elections
commission at Otero' House last
Wednesday, implying that Stu
dents First should have been pres
ent, Park said. However,
according to Park, the meeting
had no such endorsement.
Park questions the fairness of
presenting the meeting as an of
ficially sponsored activity which
is supposed to include represen
tatives from each party.

Moreover, the flier implied that
the program was also being spon
sored by ASSU dorm representa
tives and resident assistants,
when it was actually sponsored
only by those in Otero, according
to Canul.
Lastly, the flier made a false
reference to the Stanford Unity
Party.
Representatives from Students
First did attend meetings in
Otero, Eucalypt.o House and
Florence Moore Hall. Park said
she believes that had they not
attended, the publicity tactics of
the People's Platform would have
made Students First look bad.
Students First has also claimed
that two other fliers support its
charges of unfair campaigning.
A flier distributed throughout
campus gives an endorsement to
several people affiliated with the
People's Platform. The flier is at
tributed to an anonymous group
of students who say they are con
cerned with the elections.
Canul said he wants to know
who this anonymous group is and
what it is trying to hide by not
openly giving the names of the
students involved. He said he
believes the flier is overall a clear
endorsement for the People's Plat
form, although it does endorse
some Stanford Unity and Stu
dents First candidates.
"It's just like the takeover last
year — people committing ques
tionable acts and refusing to take
responsibility and accountability
for them," Canul said.
