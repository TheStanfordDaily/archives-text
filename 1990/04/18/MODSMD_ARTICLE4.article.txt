# Resident fellows question priority given to Res Ed
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
In light of a targeted 15 percent reduction in the
Residential Affairs budget, some resident fellows
have questioned the University's commitment to
education in the form of residential education.
Most RFs have argued that residential education
is an integral part of the Stanford educational ex
perience.
Thirty-six RFs represented by Twain RF Denis
Phillips took issue with what they perceived as an
attack by University President Donald Kennedy on
Res Ed and the RFs' performance, in a letter last
week to Kennedy and Provost James Rosse. The
RFs' letter, which was published in The Daily, came
in response to Kennedy's April 5 address envisioning
"Stanford in its Second Century."
In his address, Kennedy said, "We have discovered
that certain departments and programs are espe
cially successful at creating learning communi
ties. ... A few residential settings have provided
the same kind of environment over the years. Yet
I think we would agree that the integration of
formal academic work into the residences has not
achieved the high hopes that we routinely express
for it â€” even though, judged on
the criterion of their success as
living communities, our residen
ces are among our best ac
complishments."
The RFs said they were
"surprised" by Kennedy's opinion,
asserting that Res Ed is just as
valuable as "formal" education.
Moreover, the RFs said Res Ed is
neither "too expensive" for the
service it provides nor in need of
what at the time was a proposed
20 to 25 percent budget cut.
Final budget reduction targets
were announced Monday by
Rosse, and the Residential Affairs
cut was lowered to 15 percent.
In an April 10 letter in response
to the RFs' letter, Kennedy wrote
that he was "stupefied" by the
RFs' response because his words
were not an attack on Res Ed but
were, rather, "generally
laudatory."
By expressing a failure to inte
grate formal academic work into
residential life, Kennedy meant
the University had not gone far
enough in establishing programs
like Structured Liberal Eduation,
he wrote.
"I don't understand ... how 36
members of the Stanford profes
soriate can parse that into an ex
pression of 'dissatisfaction' about

your performance," Kennedy
wrote.
Kennedy did not explicitly re
spond to the RFs' criticism of the
proposed Residential Affairs
budget cuts because no final tar
get reductions had been set at
that time.
However, Kennedy agreed to
meet with the RFs and discuss
their grievances at a later date.
Because Kennedy has been on va
cation for the last week, the meet
ing has not yet taken place.
Addressing budget cuts, Ken
nedy said in his April 5 speech,
"The pruning shears have yet to
close on a single twig; please
suspend judgment and let this
process work."
However, in another letter to
Kennedy and Rosse, Phillips, who
was not representing the other
RFs, responded to Kennedy's let
ter by charging that Stanford's
reputation will go "down the
tubes" if the Residential Affairs
budget is significantly reduced.
In the letter, Phillips high
lighted some "successful" pro
grams of his residence staff in
defense of Res Ed.
"What price is the administra
tion willing to pay for students'
contact with faculty, for academic
and psychological counseling, for
an increase in sensitivity to racism
and sexism, for access to comput
ers for students from all socio
economic backgrounds, for

friendly relations with advisers?"
Phillips asked.
In a subsequent interview with
The Daily, Phillips said he
believed the overall $22 million
reduction in Stanford's operating
budget is necessary for the future
health of the University. However,
"Res Ed is not a very fat opera
tion" with waste and inefficency
that can be harmlessly excised
from its budget.
Phillips added that he feels ad
ministrative services should ab
sorb more of the budget
reductions than Res Ed, because
"Res Ed did not cause such a big
percentage of the problem." Even
lowered to 15 percent, the final
budget reduction target for Resi
dential Affairs is too high for Phil
lips' taste.
Most RFs interviewed said they
shared Phillips belief in the im
portance of residential education,
and some reiterated his belief that
the Residential Affairs reduction
target is relatively too high. Roble
Hall RF Evan Porteus and Soto
House RF John Perry said they
shared this conviction.
Evans said he was confused by
Kennedy's simultaneous rededica
tion to undergraduate education
in his April 5 speech and his ap
parent endorsement of the Resi
dential Affairs cuts. Meanwhile,
Perry said he was unsure if Ken
nedy actually endorsed these cuts
specifically.
