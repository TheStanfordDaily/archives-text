Feminism is changing the face
of literature, writer Ursula
LeGuin said at a creative writing
colloquium yesterday. About 50
students and faculty members,
most of whom had attended a
reading in a packed Kresge Audi
torium Monday night, asked
LeGuin questions about science
fiction, feminism and writing.
The author of 10 novels,
LeGuin is perhaps best known for
"The Left Hand of Darkness." She
won the National Book Award for
"The Farthest Shore" and has
also published books of poetry and
essays.
The feminist movement has

feminism deep enough to write from a
feminist viewpoint. In other words, I learned
how to be a woman.'

helped LeGuin enter a new phase
of her writing. "Within the last
12 years I have been able to . ..
really incorporate feminism deep
enough to write from a 'feminist
viewpoint.' In other words, I
learned how to be a woman,"
rather than an "imitation man,"
she said.
This is evident in her most
recent novel "Tehanu," the fourth
book of what has been called ti e

Earthsea trilogy, which centers
around an old woman. "We cannot
let men explain for us what it is
to be getting old as a woman. This
is unexplored territory, and it is
empowering for both writer and
reader," she said.
"Writing 'Tehanu' was more
like listening — I listened for 17
years to hear that book," LeGuin
added. "It is a collaboration be
tween the conscious and the un

conscious mind."
Although her novels are usually
marketed as science fiction,
LeGuin said, "Genres are labels
to facilitate the marketing of
books. .. . The distinctions that
are useful in art are those of
quality."
LeGuin came to campus as part
of the Jean and Bill Lane Lecture
Series. Monday night, she read
several works "hot off the type
writer" for the first time for an
audience, including two poems
about getting old — "Buzzard
Visit" and "My Music." Her latest
story, "Unlocking the Air," is
about "a small town in Eastern
Europe that is perfectly realistic
except that it exists only on my
map," she said.
