# $3,500 worth of 'exit' signs stolen from sorority Rush tents
## 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
More than $3,500 in equipment was
stolen Monday night from the banquet
tents housing sorority Rush, which began
last night.
The equipment consisted mainly of 14
exit signs, which if broken can cause a
potential health hazard due to chemicals
they contain.

Seven banquet canopies were pitched
on Wilbur field Monday to house the
Rush. Each of the rented tents came
equipped with a fire extinguisher and
two illuminated exit signs to ensure
safety.
Sometime between 10 p.m. Monday and
9 a.m. Tuesday, the tents, which were
not under security, were burglarized and
all 14 exit signs were stolen, along with
one fire extinguisher.

The exit signs, which cost $250 each,
do not run on batteries; they are operated
by a nuclear cell similar to those used
in some illuminated wristwatches.
Replacing these signs will cost the In
tersorority Council about $3,500. But the
potential health threat involved in the
theft of the signs may be even more
formidable than the cost.
According to Roland Finston, a senior
health physicist at the University Envi

ronmental Safety Facility, such signs
usually contain a small quantity of ra
dioactive gases which can pose modest
health risks if released.
Fraternal affairs adviser Michael
Hughes expressed great concern over the
present whereabouts of the signs. He was
concerned primarily with the possibility
that students may have committed the
theft, and that the signs may be acciden

tally broken and leak radiation.
Bourassa is unaware of any possibility
of resale, but he pointed out that the
signs must have value for someone be
cause 14 were stolen. He suggested that
young people may have wanted the signs
to hang in their rooms, the way people
display stolen street signs.
"I guess they'd make a pretty trophy
for someone's mantelpiece," said Bouras
sa.
