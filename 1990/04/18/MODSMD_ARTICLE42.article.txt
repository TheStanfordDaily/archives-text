# Historic Global Meeting Set for April
## 
### 
Dignitaries from
around the world gather
for conference
with 'World Teacher'
The global transformation we
are now seeing is the result of
an extraordinary stimulus for
change: the presence of
Maitreya, the World Teacher.
Long awaited as the Messiah,
the Mahdi, Maitreya Buddha,
Krishna, and the Christ, he is a
teacher and guide for all hu
manity - those of every religion
and no religion.
Working Behind
the Scenes
Since 1977 Maitreya has lived
in London as a seemingly ordi
nary man, working behind the
scenes worldwide to awaken a
new spirit in humanity. He has
been emerging gradually into
full public view so as not to in
fringe our free will.
Forecasts of
Global Changes
A major step in Maitreya's
emergence occurred in mid
-1988 when one of his close
associates began giving inter
views to a London-based jour
nalist. Released to the press
and published in the monthly

magazine. Share International,
these interviews include
Maitreya's analyses of global
trends, forecasts of world
events and his spiritual teach
ings. Weeks or months ahead of
time he forecast, among others:
the ceasefire between Iran and
Iraq; the release of Nelson

It is hoped that this conference will
soon lead to Maitreya \ declaration
before the world of his true status.

Mandela; earthquakes in Ar
menia, California and China;
worldwide arms reductions; the
fall of totalitarian ideologies;
and the poll tax revolt in Brit
ain.
Meetings with
World Figures
In preparing for his emergence,
Maitreya has met privately with
groups of journalists and in
fluential world figures. They
are ready to reveal their expe
rience of him and to implement
his plans once he emerges into
the world arena. That time has
now arrived.
Unusual Acts of Nature
According to one of his close
associates, in the weeks ahead
Maitreya is forecasting an ac

celeration in the pace of global
change, a series of unusual acts
of nature - including the flood -
ing of the U.K. Parliament and
volcanic eruptions in Russia,
Sicily and Canada - and a
mounting atmosphere of expec
tancy. This will lead to the
moment when Maitreya comes
forward.
Maitreya to Attend
Conference in London
A large conference in Ixindon
is planned for late April. Invita
tions have been sent to hun
dreds of people, including
royalty, representatives of gov
ernm en t (ambassadors,
diplomats, etc.), journalists, sci
entists, and others who have
met Maitreya. At this gathering
he will present his credentials
as the World Teacher for all
humanity. It is hoped that this
conference will soon lead to
Maitreya's declaration before
the world of his true status.
