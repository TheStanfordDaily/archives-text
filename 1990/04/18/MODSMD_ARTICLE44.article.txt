Global warming. Ozone deple

extinction?
The names of today's pressing
environmental crises have be
come buzzwords in the press,
and there is a dangerous possi
bility that they are being
diminished to just that —
words. We cannot forget the
depth and extent of the prob
lems behind those words —
problems that are global in
scope.
Labeling today's environmen
tal issues as global is appropri
ate, but the fact that a problem
is global can lead to a perceived
discontinuity between personal
action and global effect. "I can't
possibly have an impact on
global environmental issues, and
they can't possibly affect me,"
is the line of thinking we must
avoid.
The truth is that each of us
wields power with every deci
sion we make. Whether we use
recycled products, boycott
styrofoam, conserve water or
turn off unneeded lights, we are
effecting a transition toward a
more sustainable world. These
are simple choices and the im
mediately visible effects seem
minor, but these choices lay the
foundation for a new way of
thinking: our supplies of food,
air or water are not infinite.
It's hard for some people in
this country to see their per
sonal contributions to global
crises, but the connection be
comes impossible to ignore if we
bring the issue to the national
level. Tor example, the per

capita energy consumption in
the United States is one and a
half times greater than that of
the Soviet Union, more than
two times greater than Eu
rope's, and almost 14 times
greater than that of China. It
is clear that U.S. citizens have
a disproportionate effect on the
global environment.
Individuals can have a signif
icant impact. Whether that im
pact is positive or negative is a
matter of choice. Pressure from
consumers has just recently
forced three tuna canners
to adopt practices which are not
harmful to dolphins. Even here
at Stanford, changes have been
made because of individual pres
sure. Student campaigns aimed
at University Food Service have
resulted in the transition from
paper cups to glasses in most,
residences, reducing Stanford's
solid waste output — an act of
no small importance as Trash
can Earth runs out of room.
It's easy for us to forget or
ignore environmental problems
at Stanford. We don't see the
devastated land left behind the
clear-cutting machinery that
* eliminates a forest for virgin
paper. We don't see the hole in
the ozone over Antarctica that
grows each time we use an
aerosol, styrofoam cup, or our
car air conditioners. We don't
see a species gradually weaken
and die because of the toxics in
our household products. We
don't see any of that right in
front of us; but not seeing is no
excuse for complacency. We
know what's happening, and un
less we do something to remedy

our situation, we are part of the
problem.
Our land, air and water have
been sorely tested. Parts of the
world are showing signs of se
vere wear and tear, and our idyl
lic haven of plush lawns and
palm trees cannot remain an in
sulated escape for long. We must
alter our lifestyles if rapidly in
creasing global population is not
to put our resources to a test
they will not pass.
It took the catastrophe of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki to
awaken us to the horrors of
atomic weapons, but we must
not wait for a catastrophe of
large-scale disease from filthy
air or famine from depleted soils
and aquifers to push us to
seriously address environmental
problems. If we wait that long,
it may be too late.
Change begins with a deci
sion: a decision to assess the
implications of our actions. A
decision to assume responsibil
ity for the products we buy, the
trash we throw out, the corpo
rations that we support.
Earth Day 1990 should be the
positive catastrophe that will
overcome societal and govern
mental inertia by showing us
the scope of our self-created di
lemma. We can learn with in
formation rather than bombs.
But Earth Day cannot end on
Sunday night. We have to
change. April 23 must not be
just like April 21.
