# Buildings must clear hurdles to ensure environmental safety
## 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
In 1970, the same year that
Earth Day launched the modern
environmental movement, the
California State Legislature
enacted a law requiring developers
to provide extensive proof of en
vironmental safety before ap
proval would be granted to any
proposed projects.
Stanford is not exempt from
this law, and the University is
required to address a broad spec
trum of environmental concerns
when proposing the construction
of any new building on campus.
For instance, the University
could only start construction on
its new biology building after an
18-month process in which it
proved that the project is environ
mentally sound.
According to the California En
vironmental Quality Act, an ex
tensive environmental impact
report must be prepared whenever
a proposed "project may cause sig
nificant [adverse] effects or im
pacts on the environment." The
reports thus force developers, as
well as public decision-makers, to
document and consider the impli
cations of their actions.
In June 1987, Stanford first ap
plied to Santa Clara County for
permission to construct a new Bi
ological Sciences Expansions
Building. The University had
already been granted a General
Use Permit by the county, which,
according to Charlotte Strem, an
analyst in the University Plan
ning Office, "is an umbrella policy
which anticipates future use and
development through the next
century and permits the Univer
sity to apply for new buildings."
The application included there

quired environmental information
form, in accordance with county
guidelines. The completed form
incorporates a detailed description
of the project's environmental set
ting. The topography, vegetation
and potential geologic hazards of
the proposed site are all docu
mented in the form, as well as
potential areas of environmental
impact
On August 13, the county Ar
chitectural and Site Approval
Committee decided that the
construction and operation of a
new building would not have a
significant impact on the environ
ment. It indicated that filing a
report would be unnecessary,
since the information it had al
ready received from the Univer
sity was sufficient.
However, California law re
quires that a 21-day period of
public review be provided follow
ing such a decision by the county.
During this time period, the
Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition ap
pealed the decision on grounds
that the threat of toxic air emis
sions and wastewater contamina
tion were sources of public
concern.
The law was designed "to dem
onstrate that every citizen has a
responsibility to contribute to the
preservation of the environment"
and "to encourage systematic and
concerted efforts between the
private and public sectors" for the
management of natural resources
and the protection of the environ
ment.
In accordance with these pur
poses, public hearings were held
in October and November of 1987
and due to a number of citizen
concerns, the county reversed its
decision and required Stanford to
provide more information.

The report for the proposed bi
ology building was compiled with
the help of outside environmental
analysts and includes a thorough
description of the building's envi
ronmental setting. The report,
which is several hundred pages
long, addresses all areas of poten
tial environmental impact and in
corporates mitigation measures
which should be taken by the Uni
versity to minimize the adverse
effects.
For instance, since the build
ing's construction would result in
the removal of 11 trees, the Uni
versity will have to plant 11 new
trees nearby on campus.
In additon, due to the area's
topography, the erosion of soils
during winter construction could
temporarily clog drains until
revegetation is complete. To avoid
this, the report suggests that con
struction be planned for the dry
summer months whenever possi
ble, and areas not being worked
be covered or wet down to mini
mize airborne sediment.
The report also analyzes the
various hazardous materials to be
stored and used in the biology
building. Public concern had been
expressed over the possibility of
chemical leakage — particularly
during an earthquake, the im
proper disposal of chemicals and
the cumulative health risk from
the facility's venting of car
cinogenic compounds.
Several existing University pro
grams are expected to prevent the
mismanagement of chemicals and
toxic waste.
Since the regional wastewater
treatment plant frequently in
spects the Stanford wastestream
for toxins and characterizes it as
typical of domestic waste, the

existing University guidelines for
safe lab practices are expected to
ensure proper chemical disposal.
The report did recommend,
however, that the University
develop a waste reduction pro
gram.
To promote safe storage and use
of chemicals, the University has
prepared a Hazardous Materials
Management Plan. This program
is in accordance with county reg
ulations and incorporates a vari
ety of safety measures in storage
design, including closed-door

storage cabinetry and safety
edged shelving to prevent acciden
tal spills, even during a major
earthquake.
Although the facility will vent
some toxins, their air concentra
tions will be minimal. The
cumulative health risk of such
carcinogens has been estimated at
three additional cases of cancer
per hundred million people, as
suming continuous exposure over
a 70-year lifetime. This level is
well below the acceptable air con
centrations set by federal govern

ment agencies.
The report also addresses con
cerns over the noise which will
be generated by the main mechan
ical equipment in the basement of
the proposed biology building.
The proposed building's use of
public services and utilities is an
other area of environmental im
pact included in the report.
The new biology building is ex
pected to demand 15 megawatts
of electric power per day, which
would not affect the University's
overall power demand.

The new Biological Sciences Expansions Building is an example of an 'environmentally sound' structure.
