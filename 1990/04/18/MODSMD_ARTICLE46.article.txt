# The 						Foothills: Acres of scenic beauty or prime development land?

If Frederick Law Olmsted had had his
way, the Quad would now be situated in
a cow pasture next to the Dish.
The developer's first proposal for the
University depicted a curvilinear rolling
campus with a panoramic view of the
Bay. He redesigned the original plans,
however, to comply with Gov. Leland
Stanford's vision of a large symmetrical
campus located below in the flatlands.
The Foothills have always been a focal
point of the University, from their men
tion in the Stanford Hymn to their pres
ence behind the tree in the Stanford seal,
to their recreational use by hundreds of
students and community members.
The University-owned land stretches
both to the south and to the north of
1-280 and comprises more than 2,000
acres. It includes the Jasper Ridge Bio
logical Preserve and the land upon which
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
is situated, as well as the hills directly
behind Stanford.
The area bounded by 1-280, Alpine
Road, Junipero Serra Boulevard and Page
Mill Road, or what the University Plan
ning Office refers to as "Phase 1," is
perhaps that which is most familiar to

'We would like to see growth focused in urban
areas with the Foothills region preserved as a
greenbelt surrounding the cities.'

the Stanford community. Technically,
only those with Stanford affiliation are
supposed to be allowed entrance into this
area, but due to the impossibility of en
forcing such a regulation, the trails are
essentially open to the general public.
The Foothills have been identified as
an "Academic Reserve and Open Space"
since 1980, when the Stanford Land Use
Plan was issued. As outlined in the Foot
hills Region Plan, "This designation was
coined to describe the dual nature of the
Foothills â€” the land appears as 'open
space' and currently supports few aca
demic uses, yet its ultimate academic
status is mandated by the Founding
Grant."
Academic groups wishing to build fa
cilities in the Foothills must meet a strict
set of criteria, says Judy Chan of the
University Planning Office. "Develop
ment must be located in the least sensi
tive ecological zones, and it must comply

with both visual and environmental
guidelines." In addition, it must have a
low-intensity academic use, and there
must be a compelling reason for its lo
cation in the Foothills as opposed to other
areas of Stanford.
These criteria were tested in 1987,
when some members of the Stanford com
munity protested the proposed construc
tion of the Reagan presidential library
in a dell just west of Junipero Serra.
Opponents of the development argued
that the building did not comply with
several of the criteria laid out by the
Planning Office.
After several months of heated debate,
the issue was finally resolved externally
by President Reagan's decision to build
elsewhere. The debate played an impor
tant role, however, in clarifying for both
the University and for the community
the criteria which would be used for fu

ture development plans in the Foothills.
Several groups outside the Stanford
community also play an important role
in the fate of the Foothills. One such
organization is the "Committee for a
Greener Foothills." Formed 25 years ago
by a small group of concerned citizens,
the committee has since grown into a
group of 1,000 members from San Mateo
and Santa Clara Counties who are in
volved in .litigation, lobbying and public
awareness.
Their philosophy, member Barbara
Brown says, is to ensure environmental
quality through preservation of the Foot
hills and coastal lands.
"We would like to see growth focused
in urban areas," member Linda Elkind
states, "with the Foothills region
preserved as a greenbelt surrounding the
cities."
Although they have no legal basis to
influence Stanford's plans for develop
ment, they hope that by keeping the
public aware of current issues regarding
the Foothills they can affect decisions
through public pressure. "Our organiza
tion is not against all development,"
Brown asserts. "We simply make an effort
to deter irresponsible development."
Another group concerned with preserv

ation of the Foothills is Magic, Inc., a
Palo Alto nonprofit organization con
tracted by the University five years ago
to assist in a revegetation management
plan. In an effort to rejuvenate the declin
ing native oak population, the Planning
Office fenced off a 250-acre section of
the Foothills from which cattle were ex
cluded.
Volunteers from Magic, including both
community members and students, spend
Saturday mornings planting, watering
and monitoring oak saplings in this area.
Robin Bayer, a full-time student intern
at Magic, explained that a variety of fac
tors are involved in the decline of the
oak population, including trampling of
the land by cattle and consumption of
the seeds by the increasing rodent pop
ulation.
As open space in the Bay Area becomes
scarce and urban land values begin to
climb, the Foothills are coming more and
more into the forefront of local environ
mental debate as the pressure to develop
increases. With organized groups of con
cerned citizens both within and without
the University, however, Stanford will
likely see the Foothills remain in their
natural state as a resource for the sur
rounding community for quite some time.
