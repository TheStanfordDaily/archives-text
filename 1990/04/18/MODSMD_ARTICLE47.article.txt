# Waste at Stanford
## Managing the University's chemical waste 
### Amy Arends Staff writer 
Hazardous chemical waste. For many,
the term conjures up images of gurgling,
frothing, mysterious green sludge in
huge vats. Tampering with waste
results in unpredictable and, usually,
evil and devastating consequences.
Popular movies like "Roger Rabbit,"
"Batman" and "Toxic Avenger" all rein
force these views.
Stanford's Environmental Safety Fa
cility has come to the rescue to save
the Stanford community from scenarios
such as these.
The facility is responsible for collect
ing and disposing of Stanford's waste
chemicals. Treatment of chemical waste
has been regulated and controlled since
Congress passed the Resource Conser
vation and Recovery Act of 1976.
The act contains specific provisions
for the management of chemical waste
from"the cradle to the grave," said
Harvey Chock, manager of Stanford's
chemical waste disposal program.
To avoid confusion, types of waste
are defined in two ways by the act.
First, waste is defined by certain char
acteristics: ignitability, corrosivity, reac
tivity and toxicity. For waste showing
each of these different characteristics,
there are different disposal procedures.
Toxic waste is derived from certain toxic
metals or pesticides including arsenic,
lead and mercury.
The second definition of waste con
tains a list of 1,400 to 1,500 chemicals
that fall into the realm of hazardous
waste when disposed.
Some 1,500 to 2,000 shops, labs and
studios on campus last year generated
273,450 pounds of hazardous chemical
waste that falls under the act's defini
tions.
"The labs, studios and shops generate
the waste, and our responsibility at the
Environmental Safety Facility is to
manage it in the best way we know.

We are presented with various options
including landfilling, incinerating or
recycling depending on the type of
waste," Chock said.
Only Class I landfills are certified to
take hazardous chemical waste, and
there are no such landfills in Santa
Clara or surrounding counties. Last
year, 19,384 pounds of Stanford's hazar
dous chemical waste was transported to
Kettleman Hills, a Class I landfill lo
cated in Kings County in central Cali
fornia.
About 10 percent of the waste gener
ated by Stanford is put in landfills.
According to Chock, the amount of
waste landfilled has been decreasing in
recent years due to stricter state regu
lations and increasing concern about
the environment.
At the same time, the amount of
waste recycled and incinerated has been
increasing due to improved technology.
Last year, Stanford incinerated
159,612 pounds of hazardous chemical
waste. The chemical waste is not in
cinerated on site. It is transported to
an incinerator in Arkansas.
Biological waste is incinerated on site
at th 6 Environmental Safety Facility,
and Chock said, "I feel very safe work
ing here."
About 15 percent of the chemical
waste is recycled, and much of that
waste is shipped off-site.
"The problem here at Stanford is that
there are so many small waste streams.
It's hard to set up a recycling program
that is economically feasible because of
the variety of activities going on around
campus involving chemicals," Chock
said.
The Chemical Waste Program is
hoping to set up a recycling program
on campus for flammable chemicals, but
space and money are key considerations.
"It makes good sense to internalize
the recycling process if possible because
sometimes we pay $20 a gallon for recy
cling off-site. The large initial start-up

costs are negated by the money Stanford
would save in the long run," Chock said.
Chock views reduction of chemical
wastes as the most important answer
in dealing with the disposal of chemical
hazardous wastes.
"The Chemical Waste Program pro
vides a support function for different
groups in tne University. For a long
time, we did not feel it was our place
to make demands on the University.
Now, however, with the indirect cost
queston, we are pushing the concept of
waste minimization," he said.
"Previously, it may have not been as
obvious to researchers that it was in
their best economic interests to do so.
Environmentally, it might have been
wise, but researchers did not see the
benefits. Now with the budget cuts af
fecting everyone, waste minimization
seems like a pretty good idea to them,"
Chock added.
Waste minimization can be accom
plished in three ways.
If only small amounts of a chemical
are needed, several users can share it.
Scientists are encouraged to conduct
microscale research when possible.
A flier distributed to all chemical
waste producers on campus also encour
ages them to review each experimental
protocol to assure that hazardous
reagents are used efficiently and that
excess purchases are minimized.
There has been much progress in the
area of chemical waste disposal since
Earth Day 1970. The first regulations
for chemical waste were set up under
the Solid Waste Act of 1970.
"Twenty years later, I see an increase
in awareness," Chock said. "People
around campus are starting to call more
and get more information on materials
and are more concerned about reducing
the amounts. In 1970, people were con
cerned with where to put the hazardous
materials. Today, there is more of a
focus on how to reduce the large
amounts we have already produced."

"Twenty years later, I see an increase
in awareness," Chock said. "People
around campus are starting to call more
and get more information on materials
and are more concerned about reducing
the amounts. In 1970, people were con
cerned with where to put the hazardous
materials. Today, there is more of a
focus on how to reduce the large
amounts we have already produced."
Hazardous chemical waste. For many,
the term conjures up images of gurgling,
frothing, mysterious green sludge in
huge vats. Tampering with waste
results in unpredictable and, usually,
evil and devastating consequences.
Popular movies like "Roger Rabbit,"
"Batman" and "Toxic Avenger" all rein
force these views.
Stanford's Environmental Safety Fa
cility has come to the rescue to save
the Stanford community from scenarios
such as these.
The facility is responsible for collect
ing and disposing of Stanford's waste
chemicals. Treatment of chemical waste
has been regulated and controlled since
Congress passed the Resource Conser
vation and Recovery Act of 1976.
The act contains specific provisions
for the management of chemical waste
from"the cradle to the grave," said
Harvey Chock, manager of Stanford's
chemical waste disposal program.
To avoid confusion, types of waste
are defined in two ways by the act.
First, waste is defined by certain char
acteristics: ignitability, corrosivity, reac
tivity and toxicity. For waste showing
each of these different characteristics,
there are different disposal procedures.
Toxic waste is derived from certain toxic
metals or pesticides including arsenic,
lead and mercury.
The second definition of waste con
tains a list of 1,400 to 1,500 chemicals
that fall into the realm of hazardous
waste when disposed.
Some 1,500 to 2,000 shops, labs and
studios on campus last year generated
273,450 pounds of hazardous chemical
waste that falls under the act's defini
tions.
"The labs, studios and shops generate
the waste, and our responsibility at the
Environmental Safety Facility is to
manage it in the best way we know.

We are presented with various options
including landfilling, incinerating or
recycling depending on the type of
waste," Chock said.
Only Class I landfills are certified to
take hazardous chemical waste, and
there are no such landfills in Santa
Clara or surrounding counties. Last
year, 19,384 pounds of Stanford's hazar
dous chemical waste was transported to
Kettleman Hills, a Class I landfill lo
cated in Kings County in central Cali
fornia.
About 10 percent of the waste gener
ated by Stanford is put in landfills.
According to Chock, the amount of
waste landfilled has been decreasing in
recent years due to stricter state regu
lations and increasing concern about
the environment.
At the same time, the amount of
waste recycled and incinerated has been
increasing due to improved technology.
Last year, Stanford incinerated
159,612 pounds of hazardous chemical
waste. The chemical waste is not in
cinerated on site. It is transported to
an incinerator in Arkansas.
Biological waste is incinerated on site
at th 6 Environmental Safety Facility,
and Chock said, "I feel very safe work
ing here."
About 15 percent of the chemical
waste is recycled, and much of that
waste is shipped off-site.
"The problem here at Stanford is that
there are so many small waste streams.
It's hard to set up a recycling program
that is economically feasible because of
the variety of activities going on around
campus involving chemicals," Chock
said.
The Chemical Waste Program is
hoping to set up a recycling program
on campus for flammable chemicals, but
space and money are key considerations.
"It makes good sense to internalize
the recycling process if possible because
sometimes we pay $20 a gallon for recy
cling off-site. The large initial start-up

costs are negated by the money Stanford
would save in the long run," Chock said.
Chock views reduction of chemical
wastes as the most important answer
in dealing with the disposal of chemical
hazardous wastes.
"The Chemical Waste Program pro
vides a support function for different
groups in tne University. For a long
time, we did not feel it was our place
to make demands on the University.
Now, however, with the indirect cost
queston, we are pushing the concept of
waste minimization," he said.
"Previously, it may have not been as
obvious to researchers that it was in
their best economic interests to do so.
Environmentally, it might have been
wise, but researchers did not see the
benefits. Now with the budget cuts af
fecting everyone, waste minimization
seems like a pretty good idea to them,"
Chock added.
Waste minimization can be accom
plished in three ways.
If only small amounts of a chemical
are needed, several users can share it.
Scientists are encouraged to conduct
microscale research when possible.
A flier distributed to all chemical
waste producers on campus also encour
ages them to review each experimental
protocol to assure that hazardous
reagents are used efficiently and that
excess purchases are minimized.
There has been much progress in the
area of chemical waste disposal since
Earth Day 1970. The first regulations
for chemical waste were set up under
the Solid Waste Act of 1970.
"Twenty years later, I see an increase
in awareness," Chock said. "People
around campus are starting to call more
and get more information on materials
and are more concerned about reducing
the amounts. In 1970, people were con
cerned with where to put the hazardous
materials. Today, there is more of a
focus on how to reduce the large
amounts we have already produced."
