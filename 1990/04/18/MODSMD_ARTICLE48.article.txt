# Doing it again and again...

The T-shirt reads, "Recyclers do it
again and again and again and again
and again and again," and for Stanford
Recycling Center, operating since 1977,
the assertion is true.
"Our overall goal is to make recycling
as convenient and attractive as throwing
things away," Barbara Voss, program
coordinator for the center said.
Last year, 19,348 tons of waste was
generated at Stanford. Of that waste,
6.4 percent, or 1,239 tons, was recycled
by the center, according to the Earth
Day 1990 environmental audit of Stan
ford.
"We process about 10 percent of the
University's waste and about 125 tons
of recyclables each month," Voss said.
Recycling has become a key issue since
the adoption of California law AB 939,
which mandates that counties reduce
their wastes 25 percent by 1995 and 50
percent by the year 2000.
"The center is concentrating on ex
panding," Voss said. For example, the
center recently started collecting
cardboard from the Medical Center. Voss
estimates that this new partnership will
increase the center's recycling load by
about five tons per month.
Currently, the center has 1,700 recy
cling bins located around campus.
Workers recently started collecting junk
mail and plaatic two-liter soda bottles
from various spots on campus.
Magazines are also accepted but must
be brought to the drop-off site.
"We custom-design our collection sys
tems to every building on campus," Voss
said.
"The future of recycling at Stanford
really depends on the different solid
waste management decisions the Uni
versity makes within the near future,"

she added. "The University provides
about 60 percent of our operating
budget, and they have given us a pre
liminary figure of 18 percent that will
be cut from our budget."
There are three ways in which the
recycling center could streamline its
cost. The first is increasing collection of
high-revenue items like aluminum cans
and white paper.
Currently, the recycling center es
timates a loss of $750 to $1,000 a month
from scavengers who raid the center's
aluminum can barrels. According to
Voss, scavengers come the day before
cans are serviced and empty them out.
The second option, according to Voss,
includes collecting less frequently and
training crews more effectively.
"As a last resort, we would have to
look at stopping collection of low -revenue
materials like junk mail or newspaper,
which only bring in about $5 per ton,
and that doesn't even cover the cost of
collecting them," Voss said.
Increases in the recycling center's pro
gram could actually be a way for the
University to save money.
"Every ton Stanford recycles is one
less ton Stanford has to landfill. That
principle is called the 'avoided-disposal
cost savings.' With this savings in mind,
the Stanford Recycling Center could be
an important part of Stanford's future,"
Voss said.
Although Voss sees recycling as a key
issue, M pre-<ycling" is just as crucial.
The center outlines plans for reduction
including using paper instead of plastic
bags at the grocery store and buying
items like peanut butter in glass, not
plastic. Encouraging University Food
Service to switch to reusable items is
viewed as important as well.
"In society in general, there is a trend
toward overpackaging and dis
posability," Voss said.
