# Energy efficiency increasing
## Management group, power plant responsible for reductions 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
Although the '80s certainly will
not be remembered as the decade
of environmental progress, they
were host to a number of far
reaching improvements in Stan
ford's energy conservation
program.
The great progress in Univer
sity energy efficiency over the past
10 years was made possible by
several interacting factors, includ
ing the construction of a cogen
eration plant on campus, the
creation of award-winning energy
systems programs by the Energy
Management Group and the
launching of a public information
campaign by both the group and
the Housing Energy Conservation
Committee.
Cogeneration is a process which
uses a single fuel — in Stanford's
case, natural gas, an environmen
tally preferable energy alternative
— to produce both electric and
thermal energy. Overall, this proc
ess is nearly three times more
efficient than conventional elec
tricity generating systems.
The campus cogeneration plant,
known as "Cardinal Cogen," was
constructed in 1985 by the Gen
eral Electric Co., which owns and
assumes all risk for the project.
Although the University does not
profit directly from the sale of
energy, it does generate earnings
through land rent payments from
GE.
The Stanford Energy Manage
ment Group is primarily respon
sible for the large energy cost
reductions seen every year on
campus. Organized in the wake
of the 1970s energy crisis, the
group began as a 13-member or
ganization dedicated to conserv
ing both the University's funds
and the earth's natural resources
in 1979.
The primary tasks of the group,
as indicated in the 1981 Energy
Action Plan, include implement

ing cost-effective modifications
within the energy distribution
system on campus, improving the
efficiency of mechanical and elec
trical systems in existing campus
buildingß, playing an active role
in the design of new energy
efficient facilities and promoting
public awareness of energy con
servation.
Over the past 10 years, the en
ergy issue has become less urgent,
and the group has diminished in
size. It now consists of only two
individuals, who form a powerful,
effective team.
Scott Gould, an energy en
gineer, concentrates mainly on the
University's heating, ventilation
and air conditioning systems.
Julie Hardin, an energy analyst,
specializes in lighting projects and
issues of public awareness on
campus.
Although the group has gotten
smaller, it has succeeded in saving
the University larger and larger
sums of money every year. In the
fiscal year 1988-89, Gould and
Hardin saved Stanford approxi
mately $80,000 in addition to
several hundred thousand dollars
saved annually from past projects.
Much of the group's work is
accomplished with the assistance
of a network of building energy
managers. This program was in
itiated in 1980 to promote consci
entious use of energy on campus
and has won several national
awards for innovation and effec
tiveness since that time.
The campus energy managers,
who range in occupation from sec
retaries to administrators, serve
as liaisons between the group and
the individuals in each academic
and auxiliary building on campus.
They provide assistance by report
ing any difficulties, helping with
the scheduling and coordination
of repairs and encouraging energy
conservation in their building.
The group's conservation pro
gram involves distributing in
formative materials to the energy

managers and relying on them to
display posters and relay informa
tion to co-workers. A similar proj
ect has been initiated among the
undergraduate population by the
conservation center, which con
tacts energy reps in each residence
hall.
To improve the energy effi
ciency of older buildings, the
group "conducts retrofit pro
grams of customizing energy man
agement," Hardin says.
Some of the conservation tech
niques that have been imple
mented include the installation of
photocells, which sense the level
of light in a room and adjust the
lamp intensity accordingly, mo
tion sensors which shut off the
lights in empty rooms and fluo
rescent lighting systems.
The group also encourages the
replacement of incandescent light
bulbs with compact fluorescents.
Fluorescent light bulbs cost about
$10 each, while conventional bulbs
cost only 70 cents; however, ac
cording to Gould, these conver
sions are cost-effective.
"The savings in maintenance
dwarf the savings in energy,"
Gould says, since the flourescent
bulb lasts about 13 times longer
and thus has to be changed far
less often.
One area of its current retrofit
project is the Quad. Workers re
cently completed updating the
lighting system in Jordan Hall
and are now beginning the anal
ysis and implementation of a
similar project in the Political Sci
ence building.
In addition, the lighting system
in the Geology Corner is being
renovated along with quake
related repairs.
The lighting systems in the
Hoover Stacks, along with those
at Meyer and Green Libraries,
have all undergone modifications
in the past few years. To conserve
energy, the lights in Hoover
