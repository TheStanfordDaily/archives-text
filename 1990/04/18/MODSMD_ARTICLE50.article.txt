# Working to change attitudes
## 
### June Cohen Staff writer 
Although updating and im
proving the energy-consuming
facilities on campus are essential
aspects of energy management,
it will take more than changing
light bulbs to affect energy con
servation — people's attitudes
and behavior must change as
well.
Confronting this challenge
daily, Julie Coopett tries to en
courage students to conserve
energy although they aren't di
rectly paying their electric bills.
Coopett, director of the
Housing Energy Conservation
Center, has left her mark on
campus with fliers and bro

chures urging environmentally
responsible behavior.
The problem with energy ed
ucation, says Coopett, is that
the material is inherently dry
until someone individualizes it
to make it interesting.
Coopett runs a virtually one
woman show at the conserva
tion center. She delivers her
message through a network of
student representatives, one
from each undergraduate resi
dence.
"We try to make our materials
fun and humorous," Coopett
says.
Although both the center's ed
ucational campaign and Earth
Day 1990 have refocused
campus attention on the envi

ronment, Coopett does not
foresee serious conservation ef
forts until the onset of another
energy crisis.
These days, a typical dorm
room may include one or more
stereos, CD players, televisions,
VCRs, refrigerators, alarm
clocks, computers and fans.
All of these former luxury
items use a great deal of elec
tricity, especially when care
lessly left on.
Other simple lifestyle changes
can add up to substantial
campus and regional savings if
people make the effort to focus
on them. These include shorten
ing showers, turning faucets off
while brushing teeth and turn
ing lights off.
