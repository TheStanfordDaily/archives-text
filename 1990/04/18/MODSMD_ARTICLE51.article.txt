# Stanford's air quality: The smog could be getting thicker
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Barring bad weather, the view
from the top of the 283-foot Hoo
ver Tower can be breathtakingly
clear. As one travels south, the
next highest building is in Los
Angeles. The view from that city's
tallest building, Library Tower, is
often breathtakingly dirty.
The difference is simple: smog.
Stanford's air quality is signif
icantly better than that of many
population centers in the United
States. But concerned University
residents say Stanford still faces
difficult air quality issues.
The Rodin sculptures on
campus are slowly being eroded
by automobile exhaust, scientists
are being exposed to potentially
toxic fumes from experiments,

and workers breathe air con
taminated by campus smokes
tacks.
The most significant sources of
air pollution on campus are the
Environmental Safety Facility in
cinerator, the Cardinal Cogenera
tion Plant and the tens of
thousands of cars that pass
through campus each day. Other
air pollutants come from labora
tories, particularly in the Biology-
Chemistry Quadrangle and the
Medical Center.
No studies have been performed
indicating that a significant air
problem exists at Stanford. Air
samples are not regularly taken
from the campus because of the
expense of analyzing the samples.
Because of the dilution of the pol
lutants, air quality away from the
direct sources — laboratories, in

cinerator and cogenerator — is
expected to be significantly lower
than at the sources.

Cars are a source of pol
lution on campus, filling the air
with hazardous ozone, nitrates,
carbon monoxide and other
chemicals. But significant prog
ress might be made in this regard.
Stanford is calling for a 10 percent
decline in the number of parking
spaces available on campus in the
next 10 years, even though
parking demand is expected to in
crease significantly.
Stanford hopes to encourage
more people to commute using
public transportation and car
pools. Not only is this move ex
pected to stem the growth of
campus asphalt, it is designed to
keep the number of cars polluting
the air to a minimum.

The University's biggest single
air polluter is the cogenerator. In
fact, the cogenerator is the largest
polluter in the Stanford area, says
Joe Slamovich, an official with the
Bay Area Air Quality Manage
ment District.
To be sure, cogeneration is con
sidered environmentally chic. For
the same amount of fuel,
cogenerators produce significantly
more usable energy than ordinary
power plants. That means fewer
greenhouse gases are released into
the atmosphere, and people living
nearby are exposed to fewer car
cinogens.
The problem, however, is that
cogenerators also pollute the air.
In areas where many people live
and work, the smoke is not always
appreciated. When a fog blanketed
campus one night this winter, the

incinerator smoke billowed near
the ground, exposing late-night
passers-by to a dose of polluted
air.
Still, during normal working
conditions, the cogenerator stays
within its regulated confines and
has never been cited by any agency
for excessive emissions.
The cogenerator has been cited
for exceeding the limits numerous
times during startups and shut
downs because it does not have
the variance that most other
power plants have. Because of this
missing step in the bureaucracy,
the cogenerator is not allowed to
shut down even for repairs once
it has started.
For years, the campus Health
and Safety Department received
complaints from students and em
ployees that breathing the air

even outside laboratory buildings
was causing nausea and irritation.
In order to study the possible
harmful effects of the chemical
fumes, Stanford hired a local firm
to mathematically model the
Biology-Chemistry Quadrangle.
The firm found no significant risk
to any workers in the area.
In fact, the study showed that
about one cancer death is expected
if one million people are exposed
to air in the Biology-Chemistry
Quad for 70 years, 24 hours per
day.
The study noted that the risks
were at least 10 times smaller
than the risks deemed acceptable
by Proposition 65 and that the
chances of dying in an earthquake
were about 100 times greater them
dying from fume-induced cancer.
