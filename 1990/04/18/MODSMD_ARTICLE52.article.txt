# Environmental research at Stanford
## Solar energy : letting the sun shine in 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
There's something new under the
sun, and it's free.
It's solar energy, one of the frontiers
of safe and environmentally conscious
energy production.
Two Stanford researchers are work
ing to bring solar energy one day to
homes all across the nation. Electrical
Engineering Assoc. Prof. Richard Swan
son is one of those two men who may
help change the face of — and the fate
of — America's environment.
Swanson said two generic types of
photovoltaic cells exist: flat plate and
concentrated. Flat plate cells are large
panels in which the solar film comes
directly in contact with the sunlight.
With concentrated cells, the area of
Swanson's research, a lens or mirror
focuses the light onto a small cell.
Swanson started his research in 1973.
He received funding from the Electric
Power Research Institute in 1975 and
is now partially funded by the U.S. De
partment of Energy as well as the in
stitute. His research team has
fluctuated between seven and 13 mem
bers, with Swanson as the principal in
vestigator and the faculty member
responsible for research.
There are two parameters that have
played heavily in the research: efficiency
and cost. While the efficient conversion
of energy absorbed over a given area is
important, the most challenging prob
lem has been reducing the cost.
Early photovoltaic (PV) solar cells
were impractical for application on a
large scale. The "balance of system
cost," which includes the land, site prep
aration and structure cost, for such a
large area far outweighed the energy
output. With flat panels, an area in
crease of 20 percent is accompanied by
a doubling of the cost.
The prevailing hypothesis of the mid

1970s was that existing concepts could
be engineered to reduce costs, but Swan
son realized that what was needed was
a "breakthrough." The breakthrough —
modern lenses and mirrors — can con
centrate the sun's rays by 500 times
onto a tiny square solar cell. The plastic
Frenel lenses Swanson uses are 17 cen
timeters wide while the cell is only one
centimeter on a side.
The concentrating element must be
able to track the sun, so each lens is
run by an elaborate system of gears.
The cell assemblies are then grouped
into modules of 48, with each module
producing 300 watts of electricity.
Swanson explained that a silicone
solar cell converts sunlight to electric
energy. Once inside the cell, the light
breaks electrons free which then roam
around in the semiconductor. When the
electrons break free, they leave behind
a broken bond, or a "hole." This hole
also wanders in the silicone crystal.
What is necessary, Swanson said, is
a device in the cell which pulls the
electrons out. The challenge is to
navigate the electrons into an external
circuit, where they release part of their
energy, and then to return them back
into the "holes."
"The name of the game is high effi
ciency in the cell, " Swanson said.
He has reached his goal of a 29 percent
energy conversion efficiency with the
small cells, but larger cells have only a
24 percent efficiency. He said the limit
of efficiency will be 31 percent. The real
goal, he said, is to lower the system cost.
Solar cell researchers refer to cost in
dollars per watt. Currently cells produce
energy at $7 per watt, but the goal is
$2 per watt. Swanson estimated re
searchers will reach that "magic num
ber" in the mid-19905.
Full-scale PV use will happen first
somewhere other than Stanford. UC-
Davis, for example, boasts a large PV
testing area run by Pacific Gas and

Electric. These large plants are neces
sary to make a $2 per watt capability
feasible.
Once costs drop to $1 per watt. Swan
son said solar energy will become at
tractive against other forms of energy
on a large scale. For a little more cost
than that he said a small market such
as Hawaii could be powered by a solar
energy plant. For large scale future use,
the sunniest parts of the United States
will be testing areas, including the
deserts of Southern California, Nevada
and Arizona.
Currently the solar industry produces
42 megawatts of power through PVs
worldwide. One-third of that production
lies in consumer items such as calcula
tors and watches, but the remainder is
experiencing a rapid 30 percent growth
rate.
Swanson foresees breaking the $2
mark "pretty clearly," but the industry's
path gets "fuzzier" beyond that. He said
the U.S. government could aid the proc
ess by implementing a carbon tax or a
societal cost tax on the consumption of
fossil fuels.
America's societal cost — which in
cludes money spent to combat acid rain,
plant emissions, and other forms of fuel
inspired pollution — is twice the price
of the fossil fuel power itself. Other
countries such as Japan and West Ger
many, with Italy close behind, are also
leading in research and in fact grant
greater percentages of their federal
budgets to researchers than does the
U.S. government.
Swanson's company, Sun Power, is
trying its hand at commercializing some
of his research. The company is looking
for means to make solar energy practical.
We will not see solar-powered cars
driving by anytime soon, but perhaps
that time is coming. With public senti
ment growing against messy fossil fuel
use, Americans may soon demand that
solar energy gets its place in the sun.

of his research. The company is looking

There's something new under the
sun, and it's free.
It's solar energy, one of the frontiers
of safe and environmentally conscious
energy production.
Two Stanford researchers are work
ing to bring solar energy one day to
homes all across the nation. Electrical
Engineering Assoc. Prof. Richard Swan
son is one of those two men who may
help change the face of — and the fate
of — America's environment.
Swanson said two generic types of
photovoltaic cells exist: flat plate and
concentrated. Flat plate cells are large
panels in which the solar film comes
directly in contact with the sunlight.
With concentrated cells, the area of
Swanson's research, a lens or mirror
focuses the light onto a small cell.
Swanson started his research in 1973.
He received funding from the Electric
Power Research Institute in 1975 and
is now partially funded by the U.S. De
partment of Energy as well as the in
stitute. His research team has
fluctuated between seven and 13 mem
bers, with Swanson as the principal in
vestigator and the faculty member
responsible for research.
There are two parameters that have
played heavily in the research: efficiency
and cost. While the efficient conversion
of energy absorbed over a given area is
important, the most challenging prob
lem has been reducing the cost.
Early photovoltaic (PV) solar cells
were impractical for application on a
large scale. The "balance of system
cost," which includes the land, site prep
aration and structure cost, for such a
large area far outweighed the energy
output. With flat panels, an area in
crease of 20 percent is accompanied by
a doubling of the cost.
The prevailing hypothesis of the mid

1970s was that existing concepts could
be engineered to reduce costs, but Swan
son realized that what was needed was
a "breakthrough." The breakthrough —
modern lenses and mirrors — can con
centrate the sun's rays by 500 times
onto a tiny square solar cell. The plastic
Frenel lenses Swanson uses are 17 cen
timeters wide while the cell is only one
centimeter on a side.
The concentrating element must be
able to track the sun, so each lens is
run by an elaborate system of gears.
The cell assemblies are then grouped
into modules of 48, with each module
producing 300 watts of electricity.
Swanson explained that a silicone
solar cell converts sunlight to electric
energy. Once inside the cell, the light
breaks electrons free which then roam
around in the semiconductor. When the
electrons break free, they leave behind
a broken bond, or a "hole." This hole
also wanders in the silicone crystal.
What is necessary, Swanson said, is
a device in the cell which pulls the
electrons out. The challenge is to
navigate the electrons into an external
circuit, where they release part of their
energy, and then to return them back
into the "holes."
"The name of the game is high effi
ciency in the cell, " Swanson said.
He has reached his goal of a 29 percent
energy conversion efficiency with the
small cells, but larger cells have only a
24 percent efficiency. He said the limit
of efficiency will be 31 percent. The real
goal, he said, is to lower the system cost.
Solar cell researchers refer to cost in
dollars per watt. Currently cells produce
energy at $7 per watt, but the goal is
$2 per watt. Swanson estimated re
searchers will reach that "magic num
ber" in the mid-19905.
Full-scale PV use will happen first
somewhere other than Stanford. UC-
Davis, for example, boasts a large PV
testing area run by Pacific Gas and

Electric. These large plants are neces
sary to make a $2 per watt capability
feasible.
Once costs drop to $1 per watt. Swan
son said solar energy will become at
tractive against other forms of energy
on a large scale. For a little more cost
than that he said a small market such
as Hawaii could be powered by a solar
energy plant. For large scale future use,
the sunniest parts of the United States
will be testing areas, including the
deserts of Southern California, Nevada
and Arizona.
Currently the solar industry produces
42 megawatts of power through PVs
worldwide. One-third of that production
lies in consumer items such as calcula
tors and watches, but the remainder is
experiencing a rapid 30 percent growth
rate.
Swanson foresees breaking the $2
mark "pretty clearly," but the industry's
path gets "fuzzier" beyond that. He said
the U.S. government could aid the proc
ess by implementing a carbon tax or a
societal cost tax on the consumption of
fossil fuels.
America's societal cost — which in
cludes money spent to combat acid rain,
plant emissions, and other forms of fuel
inspired pollution — is twice the price
of the fossil fuel power itself. Other
countries such as Japan and West Ger
many, with Italy close behind, are also
