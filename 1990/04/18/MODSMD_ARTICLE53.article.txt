# Bacteria with a purpose
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
Bacteria: it's what your mother always
warned you about.
But bacteria now has a very noble
purpose — it can eliminate some of the
pollution with which we have dirtied
our planet. Civil Engineering Prof. Paul
Roberts, along with four Stanford Civil
Engineering colleagues, has pioneered
research in the natural growth of bac
teria that can clean up contaminated
groundwater supplies in a process called
"biostimulation."
In an experiment conducted at the
Moffett Naval Air Station in Mountain
View, the researchers pumped water,
methane and nutrients into polluted soil
to encourage the growth of bacteria
which would eliminate the harmful pol
lutants.
The research, which began in 1985
and was funded by the Environmental
Protection Agency, was completed last
year and a study was published in June.
Wells were drilled into an uncon
taminated underground reservoir in an
"X" formation with four at the corners
of a square and one in the middle. Water
and other nutrients were pumped into
the outer wells and pumped out of the
center one.
The researchers also pumped small,
measured quantities of the pollutants
into the aquifer, which is not used for
drinking water.
The industrial culprit Roberts' re
search attacked was trichloroethylene
(TCE), a common industrial solvent, and
the attacker was the methylotroph, a
bacteria that consumes methane. Met
hane is an organic compound with one
carbon atom and is a component
of natural gas.
A valuable side-effect is that the bac
teria also "digests" other carbon com

pounds that are some of the most
common industrial groundwater pollut
ants. One such pollutant is vinyl
chloride, and the bacteria successfully
broke down 95 percent of that com
pound.
"Vinyl chloride has turned out to be
one of the nastiest, most persistent, in
tractable contaminants, because it is
hazardous to health and because it is
difficult to treat adequately," Roberts
told Stanford News Service in October.
"It's volatile, so it can be blown out into
the atmosphere, but no one wants it
there either."
The bacteria the researchers stim
ulated were indigenous to the soil there,
and none of the strains was pathogenic.
Once the bacteria grew, they released
enyzmes which chemically altered the
TCE into safe compounds.
In most cases, the bacteria already
present are not populous enough to alter
the pollutant's structure. Roberts and
his team added great numbers of bac
teria into the soil to make a difference
with the TCE, which is widely used as
a degreaser and solvent.
Roberts' experiment was the first test
of the groundwater contamination con
cept in the field.
Groundwater pollution is an extensive
nationwide problem, especially in the
Santa Clara Valley, where 50 to 60 per
cent of the water comes from under
ground reservoirs. Affected communities
in California alone include approxi
mately a million people.
Here in the Silicon Valley, according
to Roberts, the electronics industry is
the largest culprit in groundwater con
tamination. But he stressed that even
if the biological degradation method
proves successful, no method is an al
ternative to preventive measures in
fighting pollution.
