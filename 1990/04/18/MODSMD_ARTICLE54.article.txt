# Ground water laced with toxic chemicals
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Under the well-groomed lawns
of the Stanford Research Park
flows one of Stanford's thorniest
environmental problems.
The ground water there is con
taminated with trace quantities
of toxic chemicals used by the
high-tech companies renting land
from Stanford. For years, the con
taminants have been drifting into
Barron Park, a neighborhood of
nearly 1,200 homes.
Under pressure from the state,
10 companies have stepped for
ward to help in the cleanup of
the area known as Hillview-
Porter. The cleanup is expected
to take at least a couple of decades
and several millions of dollars. Be
cause it is the landlord, Stanford
is being asked to pay an equal
share. The state's Department of
Health Services has labeled this
cleanup as one of the most tech
nically complicated in California.
To compound the difficulty of
the cleanup, squabbles between
parties — particularly those be
tween Stanford and the tenant
companies — have threatened to
slow the cleanup of Hillview-
Porter.
Health officials say the contam
inants in the area pose no threat
to human life because they have
not contaminated water supplies.
But residents worry that the
chemicals might leak into the
aquifer that is used as Palo Alto's

backup source of water.
Currently the only exposure the
public has to the chemicals is
through Matadero Creek, which
flows through the Research Park
and then into the Barron Park
neighborhood. Children once
played in the creek — before foam
started to appear in the water.
Health officials say the risk
from the contamination is not
very high, especially because the
water is only sometimes signifi
cantly contaminated. Even if the
water always contained the high
est level of contamination found
in the creek, a person would suffer
only about a one in a million
chance of dying of cancer from
drinking two liters of water every
day for 70 years.
Because of the low risk, even if
water supplies some day become
contaminated by the Research
Park pollutants, health officials
question whether the cleanup is
in the best interest of the state.
Some officials have said over the
years that other toxic waste sites
contain far greater dangers and
therefore should command
greater attention from the busy
Department of Health Services.
Some people blame the fact that
Barron Park residents are rich
and have political clout as the rea
son that action is being taken
while other state sites sit idle.
Possible politicking aside, the
cleanup is not slated to begin until
1993. Before that can happen, the
companies must pass through a

series of steps that could make
anyone with a penchant for
bureacracy happy.
First comes the remedial action
order, then the remedial investiga
tion/feasibility study and the
remedial action design, followed
by the remedial action plan, the
remedial action implementation
and finally the interim remedial
measure. Then comes cleanup.
Mopping up a toxic waste spill
involves more strategy than fight
ing any war. Hydrogeologists
must first locate all sources of
the pollutants. In the Hillview-
Porter case, the chemicals are
thought to be coming from at least
a dozen sources. Underground
plumes of toxic chemicals from
the companies are mixing to
gether, hopelessly blurring who is
responsible for what portion of
the mess.
So far, water samples show that
these plumes contain such chemi
cals as trichloroethylene,
perchloroethylene, toluene and
xylene. Many of these are known
or suspected human carcinogens.
Others are believed to cause dam
age to various internal organs.
None of these — all byproducts
of the electronics industry — is
thought to be benign.
Engineers must determine the
chemicals involved, the plume's
depth, its area, its migration path,
its speed and extensive geological
information. In the case of
Hillview-Porter, the geology is
tricky. So far, Mother Nature has

not helped with the cleanup.
The site is a combination of two
kinds of geological features, the
clay and sand of bay geology and
the gravel of hill geology, and that
makes it doubly difficult to
predict what is going to happen
to the plumes during cleanup. It
also horribly complicates the cal
culations of how the ground water
creeps along.
"We're not dealing with a good
deck of cards," says Jill Singleton,
a spokesperson for Health Serv
ices.
To remove the invisible toxic
gook from the water, engineers
dig wells in strategically located
places around the plumes. The
water is sucked from the ground,
cleaned and then reinjected
through other wells.
Wells dug in the wrong place
can push the plume in unwanted
directions, further complicating
the cleanup. That is why plenty
of data needs to be taken before
the cleanup begins.
Experts here say research on
ground water cleanup is in too
early a stage to say whether it
will be effective on a spill such as
Hillview-Porter, with complicated
hydrogeology and many different
chemicals. In the meantime, the
cleanup will probably proceed as
currently planned: suck out water,
clean it and reinject it. When
Stanford celebrates its 125 th year,
the cleanup of this toxic mess may
even be nearing completion.

the Hillview-Porter area.
Under the well-groomed lawns
of the Stanford Research Park
flows one of Stanford's thorniest
environmental problems.
The ground water there is con
taminated with trace quantities
of toxic chemicals used by the
high-tech companies renting land
from Stanford. For years, the con
taminants have been drifting into
Barron Park, a neighborhood of
nearly 1,200 homes.
Under pressure from the state,
10 companies have stepped for
ward to help in the cleanup of
the area known as Hillview-
Porter. The cleanup is expected
to take at least a couple of decades
and several millions of dollars. Be
cause it is the landlord, Stanford
is being asked to pay an equal
share. The state's Department of
Health Services has labeled this
cleanup as one of the most tech
nically complicated in California.
To compound the difficulty of
the cleanup, squabbles between
parties — particularly those be
tween Stanford and the tenant
companies — have threatened to
slow the cleanup of Hillview-
Porter.
Health officials say the contam
inants in the area pose no threat
to human life because they have
not contaminated water supplies.
But residents worry that the
chemicals might leak into the
aquifer that is used as Palo Alto's

backup source of water.
Currently the only exposure the
public has to the chemicals is
through Matadero Creek, which
flows through the Research Park
and then into the Barron Park
neighborhood. Children once
played in the creek — before foam
started to appear in the water.
Health officials say the risk
from the contamination is not
very high, especially because the
water is only sometimes signifi
cantly contaminated. Even if the
water always contained the high
est level of contamination found
in the creek, a person would suffer
only about a one in a million
chance of dying of cancer from
drinking two liters of water every
day for 70 years.
Because of the low risk, even if
water supplies some day become
contaminated by the Research
Park pollutants, health officials
question whether the cleanup is
in the best interest of the state.
Some officials have said over the
years that other toxic waste sites
contain far greater dangers and
therefore should command
greater attention from the busy
Department of Health Services.
Some people blame the fact that
Barron Park residents are rich
and have political clout as the rea
son that action is being taken
while other state sites sit idle.
Possible politicking aside, the
cleanup is not slated to begin until
1993. Before that can happen, the
companies must pass through a

series of steps that could make
anyone with a penchant for
bureacracy happy.
First comes the remedial action
order, then the remedial investiga
tion/feasibility study and the
remedial action design, followed
by the remedial action plan, the
remedial action implementation
and finally the interim remedial
measure. Then comes cleanup.
Mopping up a toxic waste spill
involves more strategy than fight
ing any war. Hydrogeologists
must first locate all sources of
the pollutants. In the Hillview-
Porter case, the chemicals are
thought to be coming from at least
a dozen sources. Underground
plumes of toxic chemicals from
the companies are mixing to
gether, hopelessly blurring who is
responsible for what portion of
the mess.
So far, water samples show that
these plumes contain such chemi
cals as trichloroethylene,
perchloroethylene, toluene and
xylene. Many of these are known
or suspected human carcinogens.
Others are believed to cause dam
age to various internal organs.
None of these — all byproducts
of the electronics industry — is
thought to be benign.
Engineers must determine the
chemicals involved, the plume's
depth, its area, its migration path,
its speed and extensive geological
information. In the case of
Hillview-Porter, the geology is
tricky. So far, Mother Nature has

not helped with the cleanup.
The site is a combination of two
kinds of geological features, the
clay and sand of bay geology and
the gravel of hill geology, and that
makes it doubly difficult to
predict what is going to happen
to the plumes during cleanup. It
also horribly complicates the cal
culations of how the ground water
creeps along.
"We're not dealing with a good
deck of cards," says Jill Singleton,
a spokesperson for Health Serv
ices.
To remove the invisible toxic
gook from the water, engineers
dig wells in strategically located
places around the plumes. The
water is sucked from the ground,
cleaned and then reinjected
through other wells.
Wells dug in the wrong place
can push the plume in unwanted
directions, further complicating
the cleanup. That is why plenty
of data needs to be taken before
the cleanup begins.
Experts here say research on
ground water cleanup is in too
early a stage to say whether it
will be effective on a spill such as
Hillview-Porter, with complicated
hydrogeology and many different
chemicals. In the meantime, the
cleanup will probably proceed as
currently planned: suck out water,
clean it and reinject it. When
Stanford celebrates its 125 th year,
the cleanup of this toxic mess may
even be nearing completion.
