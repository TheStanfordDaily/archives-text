# Dumping of hazardous waste contaminated Foothill Quarry
## 
### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Although Stanford has considerably
upgraded its handling of hazardous
chemical waste, it has not always han
dled it with the utmost in environmental
sensitivity.
In 1965, the Palo Alto dump refused
to take chemical waste from Stanford.
Unfortunately for Stanford, no approved
vendor or government site in the area
would take the hazardous material.
For the next seven years, Stanford
dumped a mishmash of hazardous

chemicals into two open pits six feet on
a side with walls of compacted dirt.
These pits were dug in the old Quarry
in the Stanford Foothills.
From 1906 to 1951, the quarry had
been mined sporadically, creating the
biggest blemish of the environmentally
sensitive Foothills region. At the time
of dumping, the dumping of chemical
waste was legal since there were no
applicable standards or regulations for
the disposal of chemical waste, and there
were no approved sites available.
In 1980, Stanford officials worried
that the chemical storage would prevent

use of the land and hired IT Corp., a
company specializing in hazardous ma
terial handling and cleanup, to clean
the site. The company hauled away 41
drums of waste and contaminated dirt.
Included in the wastes, much of it uni
dentified, were the pesticides DDT and
Aldrin.
No ground water analysis or soil tests
were performed, but Stanford declared
the site safe. Alain Decleve, Stanford's
now-ousted director of Health and
Safety, wrote in a letter to the city: "It
is our conviction that the affected area
has been returned to its original uncon

taminated environmental state. We can
state that the old Quarry area where
waste chemicals have been buried does
not now pose any hazard to the.envi
ronment."
Decleve was wrong. Six years later,
soil tests by a Stanford contractor in
dicated the presence of fluorene, fluoran
thene, naphthalene, chrysirie and other
contaminants. Fluoranthene, the most
concentrated of the contaminants, was
found at a level of 66 parts per million.
Results of stream water samples were
not entirely clear. A sample of the stream
running through the quarry was re

ported to have 180 parts per billion of
ethylbenzene, but other tests at about
the same time did not detect the chemi
cal.
Also, chlorobenzene was found in the
ground water uphill from the site. In a
report to Stanford, the company con
ducting the investigation concluded that
"because both chlorobenzene and ethyl
benzene were detected in ... 1986 the
possibility that low levels of these con
tamination have migrated to ground
water or nearby surface waters from
the disposal site cannot be ruled out
completely."
