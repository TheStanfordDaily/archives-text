# Television show relives the quake

The clock on the Ferry Building
strikes 5:04 p.m. Suddenly, the
camera begins to shake as books
and china fall from the shelves.
As the Oct. 17 earthquake
threw Stanford into a tumult,
"When the Earth Quakes" brings
the half-forgotten images and
feelings back into our minds.
The highlight of the National
Geographic show is a series of
videotapes taken during the earth
quake itself. Ranging from home
movies to videotapes of a high

school volleyball game, the tapes
dramatically show us the ground
moving beneath our feet.
A computer-animated section
graphically explains the causes
and effects of earthquakes. Inter
spersed with interviews with
geologists, the sequence helps ex
plain the flow of heat within the
earth.
As one geologist says, "If we
didn't have this great flow of heat,
the earth would be as dead and
dry and cold as the moon."
The show also illustrates how
lucky Stanford and the Bay Area
were in the Oct. 17 earthquake.

There were several deaths and
much damage in the Marina dis
trict of San Francisco. National
Geographic interviews geologist
Tom Hanks digging into the soil
of the Marina, which was built
on the rubble of the 1906 quake.

"National Geographic Explorer:
When the Earth Quakes" will ap
pear on Super Station WTBS at 7

is cable channel 22 in Palo Alto

City. WTBS is not carried on
SUNet.
