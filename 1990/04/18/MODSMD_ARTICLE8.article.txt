# COP, senate hopefuls illustrate party lines
## 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
In a debate last night at Toyon
Hall, the three rival parties in
this year's bid for ASSU Senate
and Council of Presidents posi
tions took their final shots in clar
ifying their views before today's
voting.
The debate, which drew a
healthy crowd, was moderated by
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter.
Students First members reaf
firmed their party's commitment
to student services and vowed that
none would be cut in response to
University budget cuts. They also
expressed a commitment to ex
pand the meaning of multicul
turalism and to draw a wider
array of students into the ASSU.
Representatives of the Stanford
Unity Party took pride in the fact
that they advance no specific
party line. According to SUP
members Allison Alter and Kevin
Lewis, their bipartisanship is one
of their greatest advantages. Even
though they are members of a
new party, Lewis said he feels con
fident that they have more than
enough experience to make their

mark in the
ASSU.
People's
Platform mem
bers largely
dealt with what
they consider
a! • x 1

the gains they
have achieved for the University
community. They want to expand
upon what they believe is a solid
foundation for progress. People's
Platform member Mae Lee said
she believes the revitalization of
student government apparent in
the current elections is a tribute
to the People's Platform.
Students First members ex
pressed concern over the consti
tutional amendment that would
end ASSU fee refunds. They said
refunds are the best way for stu
dents to democratically decide
what organizations will receive
their funds.
The Unity Party, however,
favors the proposal. SUP member
Kevin Lewis said that, after
voting for organizations request
ing student funding, students
should not be able to receive a
fee refund that decreases funding

for those groups.
Senate candidate David Brown
of the People's Platform said that
if democratic choice is at issue,
Students First should simply wait
and see how students vote on the
proposal this week.
SUP members Lewis and Alter
were also concerned with the issue
of preserving minority voices in
the senate.

Students First member A.R.
Jones said he is concerned that
the current ASSU is too closely
affiliated with the four student of
color organizations — the Asian
American Student Association,
the Black Student Union, MEChA
and the Stanford American Indian
Organization — and that the
ASSU does not effectively repre
sent other campus groups.
Lee responded for the People's
Platform, asserting that the
groups are representative of the
University community.
Michael Canul, a member of the

Students First COP slate, said
multiculturalism should expand
beyond the traditional four
student of color organizations. He
added that "multiculturalism has
become a dirty word on the Stan
ford campus because of the dic
tatorial connotation it has taken
on."
Jay Tucker, People's Platform
COP candidate, was more opti
mistic, saying that the student of
color organizations have been a
good nucleus for multicul
turalism. "They've allowed us to
start building a Stanford family."
