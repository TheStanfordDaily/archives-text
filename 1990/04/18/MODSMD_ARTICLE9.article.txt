# An audit on waste at Stanford
## Senior leads assessment of environmental responsibility 
### Jennifer Paley 
How does Stanford use its
waste, water and energy? Senior
Robert Abrams is trying to de
termine just that, through a
campus environmental audit
which will be released in pre
liminary form on Sunday, Earth
Day.
Co-founder and treasurer of
Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford, Abrams and
13 other undergraduate and
graduate students have been
gathering information about
campus resource use and organ
izing it into one comprehensive
report.
Abrams is investigating the
use of resources such as solid
and radioactive waste, water
and energy. As he receives the
results of surveys taken by dif
ferent departments and areas of
the University, he determines
the action he thinks the Uni
versity should take.

He has been heading this ef
fort since October, using the
campus environmental audit
compiled by UCLA public policy
graduate students and Earth
Day representatives as a
framework for researching en
vironmental issues at Stanford.
The Department of Environ
mental Health and Safety and
the Energy Management Group,
which seeks to increase energy
efficiency on campus, have been
helpful in providing Abrams
with information about resource
use at Stanford, he said.
However, Abrams has also
conducted "original research."
For example, he determined
that an average of 100 pounds
of paper is thrown away weekly
at the ASSU Sunday Flicks.
Such data supports Abrams'
call for a campus material
recovery facility. This facility
would recover solid waste that
has not been recycled.
"I don't see that we have any

option [other than recovering
solid waste]," Abrams said.
"The amount of resources that
we just casually throw away is
absolutely unbelievable."
After he releases his prelimi
nary report, Abrams plans to
collect more detailed informa
tion about how students can im
prove their lifestyles in order to
protect the environment.
Currently, many universities
across the nation are conducting
similar audits. Earth Day Chair
Denis Hayes described these
audits as "a blueprint for change
for a sustainable future."
Through these audits, students
"will give life to the maxjm
'think globally, act locally.' "
The audit and other Earth
Day expenses have been largely
funded by a special ASSU fee
of $6,000 to $7,000. Future
funding of the audit will be
derived from a significant sum
of money from the Centennial
Operating Committee.
