### Jock Friedly Editorial staff 
Many Stanford residents bolted
awake early yesterday morning as
nine moderate-sized earthquakes
shook the Bay Area on the anni
versary of the Great Quake of
1906.
In all, 75 earthquakes were reg
istered in northern California
along the San Andreas Fault yes
terday. Geologists said the quakes

were aftershocks of the Oct. 17
earthquake.
No rrayor injuries were reported
on the Stanford campus, but one
student hurt his back as he
jumped out of bed after one of
the temblors. Also, the swarm of
earthquakes caused slight damage
in the post office and heavy dam
age in one room of Green Library.
The earthquakes began at 6:38
a.m., shortly after a group of
Great Quake survivors gathered

in San Francisco to commemorate
the 1906 disaster. The strongest
quake, measuring 5.4 on Richter
scale at the U.S. Geological Sur
vey, hit at 6:54 a.m. Eight other
earthquakes measuring at least
3.3 were registered by 9:19 a.m.
The 5.4 quake was the largest
aftershock yet of the 7.1 Loma
Prieta quake, survey officials said.
Most of the earthquakes were
centered only five miles east of
Watsonville. This town was one
of the hardest hit in the Oct. 17
earthquake, and some damage
was reported there yesterday. One
home in Watsonville was knocked
off its supporting jacks, and 6,000
residents were left without power.
Many Watsonville residents
were left shaken after the quakes,
and many of them stayed out
doors for part of the day. "All the
memories came back to the kids
â€” this one especially," Darrell
Daniels said with his 4-year-old
daughter, Eleth, on his lap.
The quakes were felt from San
Francisco to King City, 150 miles
south, but the Oct. 17 earthquake
packed about 100 times the energy
of the largest temblor yesterday.
Aftershocks from the Oct. 17
quake could continue for more
than a year, according to Civil
Engineering Prof. Anne Kiremid
jian, who directs Stanford's Blume
Earthquake Center.
One wall in the post office,
which does not bear any stress
from the building, developed
cracks yesterday morning. The
Green Library damage occurred
in the Bender Room, which houses
some Stanford memorabilia. One
16-foot wall section, which had
suffered heavy damage in the Oct.
