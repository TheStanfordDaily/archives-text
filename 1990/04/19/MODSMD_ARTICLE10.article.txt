# Artificial windows speed healing process
## 
### Dav Amann Staff writer 
Whether it's the faint smell of
antiseptic, the painful sight of the
symbiosis between plastic tubing
and human being or the occa
sional beep of some complex in
strument, something about
hospitals frightens people.
Recent studies have shown that
patients have one more thing to
be frightened of: time deprivation.
To help combat this problem,
Stanford Hospital has installed
pseudo-windows in three rooms
of its intensive care unit.
In the round-the-clock atmos
phere of an intensive care unit,
simply the lack of a window can
so intensify patients' time dis
orientation that their need for
pain medication and the duration
of their recovery increase, studies
have found.
The 4 foot by 5 foot artificial
window is actually a blown-up 35
mm slide backlit by a computer
controlled light box. About 650
separate light changes produced
by an electronic timer simulate
time passage from dawn to dusk
across an image of the pastoral
Palo Alto Foothills.
Joe Fischer, a professional pho
tographer, conceived the idea for
the windows when his father was
recovering from a heart attack.
Assigned to a room without win
dows, Fischer's father had noth
ing for his viewing pleasure but
the clock on the wall and the holes
in the ceiling.
California legislation, which re
quires hospitals to provide

patients with a way to tell night
from day, denied Stanford Hospi
tal use of three intensive care
rooms.
To gain use of these rooms,
heart surgeon Dr. Norman
Schumway enlisted Fischer's aid
after seeing his photographs,
which were exhibited in the radi

ation department of the hospital.
More than 800 hospitals world
wide use an earlier version of Fis
cher's artificial windows. These
windows, while backlit, do not
simulate the progression of the
day.
Though the prototypes of the
windows cost the hospital $20,000

each, Fischer hopes mass produc
tion will lower the price to less
than $2,500.
Most people agree that hospitals
are terrible places. However, Fis
cher's artificial window can lessen
some of the fear and boredom. If
they could only do something
about the smell. . ..

disorientation often experienced by patients.
