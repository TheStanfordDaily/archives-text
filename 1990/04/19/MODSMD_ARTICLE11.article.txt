# Writing for real
## Classes integrate public service 
### Marli Marinelli Staff writer 
Sitting down to write a
paper, a typical Stanford stu
dent foresees countless hours
of exhaustion followed by the
professor's response: in red,
scrawled ink, it reads, "I
strongly encourage you to ex
plore a future in truck driving."
But this time, the student's
work won't be read only by a
professor, but by perhaps thou
sands of other people who will
benefit from the effort. This
intriguing concept is the basis
of Real Writing, a program
which incorporates community
service writing into the curric
ulum of Freshman English
classes.
The Real Writing procedure
begins with each class receiving
the names of five organizations
that need written material,
such as environmental agen
cies, school districts and sup
port networks. Within each
class, students decide who they
want to write for and independ
ently set up meetings with the
contact people.
The finished results have
ranged from newsletter articles
and press releases to public
service announcements and
leaflets.
Tim Stanton and Janet Luce
at the Haas Center for Public
Service initially suggested the

notion of in-class public service
writing to Ann Watters, lec
turer and teaching administra
tor of the Freshman English
and expository writing pro
gram.
Six Freshman English in
structors responded to the idea
with interest. "It seemed a
good opportunity to connect
writing with what's going on
in the community," says Wat
ters.
"You worry when students
are writing just to satisfy the
teacher," adds Freshman Eng
lish instructor Nora Bacon.
"It was the highlight for the
Freshman English course for
me," says freshman Tammy
Watts, who wrote for the Urban
Ministries of Palo Alto as part
of a group project. "I eryoyed
.. . writing something for a
practical use in the world.
A spokesperson with Urban
Ministries said Watts' writing
saved the organization $8,000.
Watters and Bacon also see
Real Writing as increasing in
structor and student awareness
of research resources available
in the community.
"We'd like to see the program
continue slowly, incrementally
â€” become more a part of the
Freshman English curricu
lum," Luce explains. "I see
Real Writing as a model that
other English programs may
follow."
