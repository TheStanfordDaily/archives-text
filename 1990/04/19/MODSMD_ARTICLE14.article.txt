# Hostage release soon?
## Group says it will free one held American 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — A pro-
Iranian group holding three U.S. ed
ucators hostage promised yesterday to
free one of the Americans within 48
hours as a humanitarian gesture and
said he would carry a message for
President Bush.
Reliable diplomatic sources in
Damascus, Syria, confirmed an Amer
ican would be freed tomorrow in the
Syrian capital.
The group, Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, did not say
which of the three would be freed. Its
statement was accompanied by an in
stant photograph of Jesse Turner of
Boise, Idaho — the first photo of him
alone since three months after his
1987 abduction.
However, the White House rejected
one demand of the hostage-takers: that
a senior U.S. diplomat fly to Damascus
to coordinate the release.
The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation
of Palestine holds Turner, Alann Steen
and Robert Polhill. All were abducted
from the campus of Beirut University
College on Jan. 24, 1987. They are
among 18 Westerners, including eight
Americans, held by pro-Iranian groups
in Lebanon.
The longest-held is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
The kidnappers demanded John Kel
ly, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
Near Eastern affairs, fly to Damascus.
"The arrangements for the release
should be accomplished by the arrival
of John Kelly in Damascus to coor
dinate some final steps to guarantee
success within 48 hours," the hand-

written statement
said.
It did not specify
what the kidnappers
expected Kelly to do
in Damascus. Kelly
served as U.S. ambas
sador to Lebanon
from 1983 to 1988,
when the eight Amer
icans were seized.

Kelly was in Bonn, West Germany, on
Wednesday.
In Washington, Secretary of State
James Baker appeared to welcome the
reports.
"Of course we're always hopeful,"
Baker said while reiterating a
longstanding U.S. demand that all
eight Americans held in Lebanon be
released unconditionally.
Baker, however, hedged on the
demand for Kelly to fly to Damascus.
"At the present time, the Middle East
is not on his agenda," he said.
Presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters: "We would
not anticipate him becoming involved
in hostage release in any way."
Fitzwater said of the reports, "We
don't know if they're true. We've seen
this many times before."
Diplomatic sources in Damascus
said Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa
last month carried a letter on the issue
from Syrian President Hafez Assad to
President Hashemi Rafsanjani in Iran.
The kidnappers said the decision to
release a hostage came in response to
behests from Iran and Syria. Iranian
newspapers associated with Rafsanjani
have urged the hostages be released
on humanitarian grounds.
