Decisions handed down
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Su
preme Court ruled yesterday that a
federal judge may not personally
raise property taxes to pay for school
desegregation but can order school
officials to do so.
The court also ruled, in other cases,
that states may outlaw all possession
and viewing of child pornography and
that an overnight guest in a private
home enjoys the same privacy rights
as the homeowner.
Trade deficit drops
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
United States in February recorded
its smallest trade deficit in more than
six years, a $6.49 billion imbalance
that reflected a sharp drop in oil
imports, the government reported

yesterday.
The Bush administration, which is
counting on strong export growth
this year to boost a sluggish domestic
economy, hailed the dramatic nar
rowing of the deficit.
But some private economists cau
tioned that the improvement could
be short-lived.
Unreported mishaps cited
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S.
Navy suffered 1,596 accidents involv
ing ships, submarines and aircraft in
the 1980s, and nearly two-thirds of
them were not publicly reported, ac
cording to Greenpeace USA.
Greenpeace, citing data obtained
from the U.S. Navy Safety Center
under the Freedom of Information
Act, said the Navy registered 106
accidents last year, the fewest of any

year in the decade except 1988, when
there were 83. The most, 248, oc
curred in 1981, it said.
The Navy did not dispute the fig
ures, though a statement from Cmdr.
Mark Baker, chief of the Navy In
formation Office, put the count of
"major" accidents last year at 69. By
"major," he referred to what the
Navy calls Class A accidents — in
volving loss of life, or property dam
age exceeding $1 million.
It's Mcßecycling
WASHINGTON (AP) - When the
kids munch a Big Mac sometime later
this year, they may be doing it while
sitting on a bench made of recycled
plastic. The paper bag to carry it
home may be made out of an old
newspaper.
McDonald's Corp. announced that

it plans to spend $100 million a year,
about one-fourth of its construction
budget, on recycled materials when
building new outlets or renovating
existing ones. It dubbed the program
Mcßecycle USA.
President Edward Rensi said that
in addition to seeking out recycled
products when building new restau
rants, the company plans soon to use
recycled newsprint for carryout bags
at about 500 of its outlets. If it works,
the use of the newsprint will be ex
panded.

Motors Corp. is expediting develop
ment of an electrically powered car
