# Trustees budget more funds for quake repair
## 
### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
The Geology Corner, Lan-
Siage Corner, west wing of
reen Library and Graduate
School of Business have re
ceived a new breath of life.
The Board of Trustees voted
last week to reconstruct and
strenghten the earthquake
damaged buildings. All four
suffered extensive damage in
the Oct. 17 earthquake. The
additional renovations will in
crease the University's total
repair budget from $134 mil
lion to $172 million.
If Centennial Campaign
funds can be raised for the proj
ect, the Geology Corner will
gain another floor. Basic
reconstruction is estimated at
$13.5 million, to be financed
by federal and state aid, gifts,

University facilities reserves
and long-term debt.
Reconstruction of the Lan
guage Corner will cost about
$15.5 million.
According to the new plans,
a concrete bracing tower will
be poured in the space on each
side of the grand central stair
case of Green Library. This
project will cost an estimated
$13.5 million. Similar towers
were used in the seismic ren
ovation of Roble Hall.
The proposed work on the
Geology Corner, Language Cor
ner and Green Library are ex
pected to be complete by winter
quarter of 1993.
The trustees also gave final
approval to a project to add
new, stronger walls and
anchored book shelves to the
Business School. This work will
be completed this summer at
a cost of $3.8 million.
