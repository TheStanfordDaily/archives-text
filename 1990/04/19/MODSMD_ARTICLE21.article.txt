## Shopping mall for minds 
### 
CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE
JUST BEEN AWARDED A $1-
MILLION TWO-HOUR SHOP
PING SPREE, the letter screams.
You swoon in ecstasy, unable to contain
your delight at your incredible fortune
as a Cheshire Cat smile threatens to
break your face. Without dawdling a sec
ond, you hop into your car, wielding the
coupon and a healthy appetite for
materialistic indulgence.
As you enter the shopping mall, how
ever, your momentum of greed is dragged
down by the sheer immensity of "stuff'
bombarding you from every direction.
Every car, jewel, trombone, rubber
duck, computer, Slinky, tape, CD and
gadget/gizmo ever manufactured stares
you in the eye.
That dress you wanted? You'll find it
in 107,888 colors and sizes over there by
the 2 billion pairs of shoes. Pretty soon
the "stuff' melts into one huge, angry,
indistinguishable collage that screams
"BUY ME."
Your first temptation is to grab every
thing in sight in a wild frenzy. Meanwhile,
your watch shows that 10 minutes have
already elapsed.
In much the same way, "shopping for
information" can frazzle the nerves. And
this time, the shopping mall's infinite
aisles are even more overwhelming than
before.
Do we stop by aisle three to pick up
a bag of Nietzche and a smidgen of
electromagnetism? Or do we trip by aisle
five and opt for Lao Tze, a little Chomsky,
"60 Minutes" and a roll of Orgo?
The frustrations of information shop

ping are well known to those who have
ever pored through the Time Schedule
and realized that they must take 50 units
each quarter to fit in all the classes that
interest them.
Perhaps the trauma of declaring a
major lies in the fact that we are choosing
a package that will take up considerable
space in the shopping cart of the mind.
There is nothing more frightening,
then, than the random cluttering of the
shopping cart â€” that is, trivia. The per
son who sits around reading trivia books
is like a blindfolded shopper who indis
criminately grasps for any package to
dump into his shopping cart.
For while the mind is a formidable
shopping cart, no shopper has the energy,
time or space to buy every piece of in
formation on the floor. Thus, it becomes
crucial for each individual to determine
what is a good buy, leaving the other
products on the shelf.
Products I prefer to leave on the shelf?
Any book by Ernest Hemingway. Gar
field. The Thursday Personals (a sad
throwback to junior high song
dedications). Articles on George Bush's
vegetable fetishes or Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles. Milli Vanilli. "Vote for me"
fliers.
Of course, if taken to the extreme,
smart shopping can degenerate into a
stingy intolerance that translates into
compulsive mental censorship.
In a moment of utter cluelessness dur
ing a lecture, the rationalization is to
say, "Heck, that was probably pretty use
less anyway. I'll leave that one on the
shelf."

The frustrations of shop
ping are well known to
those who have ever
pored through a Time
Schedule.

A twisted smart shopper starts to gen
eralize by mass-lumping information into
such dismissals as "econ is dumb" or
"poetry is useless" or "chemistry is ugly"
or "non-Western literature isn't
profound."
On a social level, an overly compulsive
smart shopper might border on rudeness:
when someone who you think is totally
banal spews garbage into your ear, the
temptation is to glaze your eyes and tune
out or simply cut the conversation short
with a curt, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." One is
left with an empty shopping cart.
In a jaunt at your local mall, going to
the extremes of having either an empty
or cluttered shopping cart wouldn't be
much cause for alarm.
But in the mall of the mind, all sales
are final.
