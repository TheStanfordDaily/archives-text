Employee cuts are
great disadvantage
to minority groups
The obvious needs to be stated.
Presently, the University is contempla
ting significant budget cuts. There are
some difficult and important decisions
being made. However, let's be clear
about one thing: some people are at
greater risk of major economic disrup
tion in their lives than others.
The non-exempt and field staffs of
this university are vulnerable. Indeed
we are all facing major job changes,
but the employees at this level —
some part-time, job-sharing or barely
full-time — have been notified of the
possible elimination of their positions.
The personal vulnerability of these
employees is connected with several
corporate realities which are the
human products of a racist and sexist
institutional history.
The plain fact of the matter is that
an inordinate amount of those most
vulnerable are African-Americans, Chi
cano/Latinos, Asian-Americans and
women. In point of fact the University
now faces a situation in which the
gains of Stanford's multicultural
workforce over the last 20 years can
be wiped out in 15 months.
This situation is further exacerbated
by the decision to make the greatest
cuts in student services. Traditionally,
these services have provided an impor
tant entry-level position to those people
or persons not welcomed in the
decidedly white male bastion of
academia.
While this choice was no doubt not
meant to be malicious, it nevertheless
has had unavoidable racial and gender
ramifications. Thus, it is imperative
that any institution contemplating cuts
in this area be sensitive about the real
and tangible messages it is sending
concerning who and what it values.
The fact that economic adjustment

can be so devastating to 20 years of
progress highlights some of the reasons
for the ontological despair and frustra
tions of the "marginalized" groups.
This is what one means when one says
things haven't changed that much.
The mere fact of this inequality,
however understandable it might be, is
a testament to how far we haven't
come as a University and a society.
This is one of the real sources of the
anger which many African-Americans
expressed in last year's University
Committee on Minority Issues report.
The question of those on the mar
gins is: how long will I have to have
the worries of my mother, grand
mother and sister? When it's all said
and done, I feel like I am the least
valued and the most expendable in the
workforce.
I believe people who are now making
the hard decisions concerning budget
cuts realize the historical and present
vulnerability of these workers. I really
believe that people of good will are
attempting to pass up this opportunity
to duplicate the sins of past genera
tions.
But, as a black American myself, I
know that it doesn't hurt to have
these things pointed out in a public
forum so that no one can miss the
obvious.
