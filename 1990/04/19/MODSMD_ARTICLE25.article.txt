Cutting program
does not have great
effect on budget
The editorials in The Daily are very
helpful in informing members of the
Stanford community and alerting them
to issues of importance. I'm giad to see
the number of editorials has in
creased.
The purpose of editorials is only well
served, however, when the content is
well informed and thoughtfully
reasoned. The editorial in the April 13
Daily on the Jordan Scholars' program
unfortunately falls short on both
points.
This program was discussed, ap
proved and subsequently reassessed by
the Committee on Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aid over the
past four years.
If any of the editors had asked,
either the Prof. Denis Phillips, chair of
the committee, or I could easily have

provided the facts.
The editorial's suggestion to elimi
nate the Jordan Scholars' program
would not save more than 0.01 percent
of the targeted budget cut in Under
graduate Admissions: this would be the
cost of mailing a letter to each of 200
admitted freshmen.

Students First's
allegations not
based on facts
We write in response to yesterday's
Daily article, "Students First's COP
slate: Opponents' tactics not too clean."
COP candidate Michael Canul alleged
that the People's Platform COP slate
had "scheduled debates and informa
tional meetings without adequately
informing Students First."
At no point in the campaign did the
People's Platform slate seek to "make

Students First look bad" by not in
forming their slate about meetings or
debates.
To the contrary, COP member Chin-
Chin Chen on Monday, April 9, asked
(Students First campaign coordinator
Jean) Park for her cooperation in plan
ning a debate schedule for the cam
paign week.
Park told Chen that the Students
First campaign schedule had already
been set. She also told Chen that the
Students First slate was not interested
in having any debates, except Tuesday
night's debate at Toyon Hall, and that
debates are not the best way to reach
students.
Our willingness to debate is consis
tent with our commitment to open
discussion at Stanford. The allegations
in yesterday's article seem inconsistent
with Park's statement to People's Plat
form COP candidate Goodwin Liu last
week that Students First wants to
"stick to the issues" during the cam
paign.
The People's Platform and its COP
slate have made every effort to avoid
petty politics this election so that stu

dents can choose a COP slate based on
facts, issues and qualifications.

was not responsible
for student's death
We are very appreciative of The Dai
ly's highlighting our ongoing efforts to
boost the image of Cowell Student
Health Center in the University com
munity.
I am concerned, however, about the
allusion to the student who had the
rare and unfortunate death from
mononucleosis. The implication from
the article remains that Cowell was
somehow at fault for this episode.
In fact, the student, after initially
presenting himself here, sought medical
care elsewhere in this community and
then ultimately returned to his home

on the East Coast, where he died fairly
suddenly after telephone consultation
with his family physician.
Mononucleosis is a fairly common
and rarely fatal viral illness that is
routinely handled with great expertise
by all student health centers, including
Co well.

anyone could pass behind me and see
