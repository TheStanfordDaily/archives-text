## Three Card seniors await pro draft 
### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
Whatever you do this Sunday, do not call
Alan Grant, Rob Hinckley, or Lester Archam
beau on the telephone. Sunday is the first day
of the National Football League draft, and
these three former Cardinal gridiron stars will
be next to the phone, waiting for the call.
"If the phone rings while the draft is going
on, I'm going to jump," Archambeau said.
"I've told everybody in my family, 'don't call.' "
The 12 rounds of the draft will be split
between this Sunday and Monday, and it is
likely that all three players will get drafted
by someone. Grant and Hinckley are projected
to be middle-round picks, while Archambeau
should be a late round choice.
"I hope I get picked early, but it's not the
most important thing in the world that I get
taken in a particular round," Hinckley said.
"I just want to get picked by a team that
needs me."
Hinckley, an outside linebacker, said the
Green Bay Packers, New York Jets, and New
York Giants have been talking to him the
most, but it is difficult to discern who will
draft an individual player. Everyone is in doubt
until the phone rings.
"It's hard when you don't have any idea
what you're going to be doing and where you're
going to be doing it," said Hinckley. "My whole
career in football I've always known what was
going to happen the next year. Now it's kind
of like I'm a freelancer — just waiting around."
Just waiting around may be the most frus
trating aspect of the draft.
"I hate having everything up in the air,"
said Grant. "That's been the hardest part the
last few months — is not knowing what's
going on. I just want it (the draft) to be over."
Defensive lineman Archambeau agreed. "I

want something to happen," he
said. "Right now [my career] is
just in the twilight zone."
Because Archambeau is
married, the draft has an added
importance. "Being married
makes it even more of a stress,
because you want to be able to
settle down a little bit or at least
have some direction."
With 28 teams in the league,
the players' lives could go 28 dif
ferent directions. Archambeau has
worked out for more than half of
the teams in the league, with the
Packers and the Pittsburgh
Steelers showing the most inter
est.
Archambeau's stock has risen
considerably because he has
bulked up to 268 pounds. For his
position, the extra weight is more
enticing to the pro teams than
the 250 he was playing at by the
end of the 1989 season.
Grant, a defensive back and
punt returner, and Hinckley were
invited to the NFL scouting com
bine. The combine is a three day
camp where pro prospects are
flown in from all around the coun
try, given physical examinations

and put through a battery of
physical fitness tests, including
the 40-yard dash and the bench
press.
Of the 10 teams to whom he
has spoken, Grant said.that the
two teams who have shown the
most interest are the Dallas Cow
boys and the Cincinnati Bengals.
"Anywhere I go will be a new
experience, which I will be looking
forward to," said Grant. "It might
be cold and it might be different,
but I'm looking forward to a
change."
After the draft this weekend,
one thing is certain to change:
the financial situation of the three
players. However, Hinckley plans
to put off making any mtyor pur
chases if and when he signs.
"I think the way I'm going to
live will just be an extension of
college," said the fifth-year senior.
"Whatever money I'll get, I'll put
in the bank and I'll live the way
I live now. Maybe I'll get a car
that runs."
The three pro prospects said
that they will not be finicky when
a team chooses them.
"I'll go anywhere with plea
sure," said Archambeau. "I'm not
a guy who's going to hold out. I
want to play and I'll play for
anybody."
