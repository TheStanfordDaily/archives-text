## Three Card seniors await pro draft 
### Buck Roggeman Staff writer 
Whatever you do this Sunday, do not call
Alan Grant, Rob Hinckley, or Lester Archam
beau on the telephone. Sunday is the first day
of the National Football League draft, and
these three former Cardinal gridiron stars will
be next to the phone, waiting for the call.
"If the phone rings while the draft is going

"It's hard when you don't have any idea
what you're going to be doing and where you're
going to be doing it," said Hinckley. "My whole
career in football I've always known what was
going to happen the next year. Now it's kind

Just waiting around may be the most frus
trating aspect of the draft.
"I hate having everything up in the air,"
said Grant. "That's been the hardest part the
last few months — is not knowing what's
going on. I just want it (the draft) to be over."
Defensive lineman Archambeau agreed. "I

hopes to wear the colors of a pro team after this Sunday's NFL draft. Hinckley is
expected to be picked somewhere in the middle rounds.
