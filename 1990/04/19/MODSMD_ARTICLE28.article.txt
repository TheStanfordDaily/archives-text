# An ancient rite of spring — football
## 
### Debbie Spander Editorial staff 
March Madness has barely
ended. It's the time of year for
the crack of the bat and the shout
of the umpire. Big Game is only
a distant memory.
So why are the shoulder pads
being taken out of storage, and
why is the practice field suddenly
alive with activity?
Spring ball has arrived.
No matter how far away the
season opener seems, spring foot
ball practice is already in full
swing. The five-week rite of
spring commenced April 9, and
according to second-year Coach
Denny Green, things are going
even better than expected for the
Cardinal.
"Practice is really up tempo —
there's lots of enthusiasm," Green
said. "We're still going through a
learning process, but the guys un
derstand what I want better."
Practice, held Monday, Wednes
day, Friday and Saturday, contin
ues for another three weeks, and
culminates in the annual Red and
White scrimmage Saturday, May
12.
The big news of spring is that
running back Jon Volpe, one of
the school's all-time single-season
rushing leaders, is back on the
gridiron. The junior was forced
to miss the entire 1989 season
due to injuries to both knees but,
according to Green, seems ready

to resume his on-the-field leader
ship this fall.
"I'm really pleased with Volpe,"
Green said. "If he's not yet 100
percent he's close to it. He still
has his old explosiveness and
quickness."
Former starting quarterback
Jason Palumbis, who will be a
junior next year, has also recov
ered from injury. Palumbis
sucessfullv underwent arthro
scopic surgery on his shoulder,
and Green is pleased with his in
creased velocity on the ball. Since
last year's part-time starter Brian
Johnson signed with the Yankees,
the starting spot is wide open and
Palumbis as well as sophomores
Steve Smith and John Lynch (who
quit baseball to concentrate on
football) are battling for the lead
signal-calling position, to be an
nounced at the close of spring
practice.
In addition to these two key
players, Green also lauded the
spring performances of running
back Glyn Milburn, cornerback
Kevin Scott and wide receivers
Ed McCaffrey and Jon Pinckey.
The defense is a true benefici
ary of the five weeks of practice,
as it looking to fill number of key
starting spots due to the gradua
tion of tackle Lester Archambeau,
linebackers Rob Hinckley and
Bruce Lang, cornerback Alan
Grant and safety Rob Englehardt.
Green is pleased with overall
progess, however.
"[The defense is] ahead of the
offense right now," Green said.
"Overall, I think they are already
better than last year — hopefully
significantly."
Although Stanford is tradition
ally considered a passing school,
Green is planning on looking to
the running game to carry the
offense. In addition to a healthy
Volpe, Stanford now adds highly
touted Oklahoma transfer Mil
burn to the backfield, and also
still has the services of last
season's ball carriers Jay Jay Las
ley and Tommy Vardell.
While Volpe and Palumbis have
returned to action, Lasley has
been sidelined with a knee iryury,
possibly for the remainder of
spring practice, and cornerback
Galen Foster is now out with a
shoulder injury.
