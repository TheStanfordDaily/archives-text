# Another Cardinal tennis NCAA sweep unlikely? Sure, pal

### 
The men's tennis team is toast. His
tory. Dead in the water. On its last
legs. Your favorite cliche here.
NCAA title? Get real. The only NCAA
title Stanford tennis will bring home this
year will be in the women's tournament,
and what's so great about another wom
en's championship? Haven't they won 26
NCAA titles in a row or something like
that?
Oh, it's only four straight. Sorry. Any
way, Coach Frank Brennan has so many
of those trophies he doesn't know what
to do. Ever seen an NCAA trophy clock
radio? Or a toaster? How 'bout a phone?
Heck, Brennan could probably use the
wood from those trophies to panel every
wall in his house.
How much of a lock are the women?
Suffice it to say the odds of them winning
the NCAA Championship for the fifth
year in a row are right down there with
the odds of today being Thursday. Put
down a half million or so, and you'll win
a buck. Maybe.
The men, though, don't have a chance
in hell.
Sorry, that's just the way it is. C'mon,
you know it's true, you just don't want

to admit it. The Cardinal mystique? For
get it. Coach Dick Gould's magic touch?
Disappeared. The singles lineup? Shaky
at best, and looking to collapse. Doubles?
In disarray.
Hey, this team almost lost to Utah. At
home. Yes, that would be the 13-12 Utes,
who are completely and totally unranked.
Injuries have killed the Cardinal.
Freshmen flashes Jonathan Stark and
Jared Palmer? Hobbling. Maybe they'll
come back, maybe they won't. Write off
1990, call it a learning year. Maybe next
year will be better.
Give me a break. Anyone who writes
off the Cardinal men — no matter
their injury situation, no matter
how shaky they may have looked against
Utah, no matter that players who have
seen no playing time at all this year now
have to step into the lineup — needs to
take a serious IQ test.
Take last year, for example.
Around five in the afternoon last May
23, Stanford tennis Coach Dick Gould
was holding an NCAA Championship
trophy on the center court in Athens, Ga.
Gould tends to end up holding trophies

quite frequently. (In fact, he has more
than Brennan.) This time, he thanked
his players, made some remarks to the
Georgia fans — the Cardinal had just
defeated the hometown Bulldogs 5-3 for
its sec rnd straight championship — and,
just before leaving, told how not everyone
at Stanford had thought the team would
be able to defend the title.
"A few months ago," Gould said, "a
sports writer in our school paper wrote
a story on the teams he thought had a
chance to win an NCAA title this year.
We weren't one of them."
Gould then allowed as to what said
writer (hey, thank goodness it wasn't the
hardworking, well-meaning scribe who
actually put in all that time covering the
team) could do with said story. Okay, so
he only said a retraction would be nice.
The retraction never came
(sportswriters are pretty good at forget
ting the predictions they make that hap
pen to be unbelievably wrong), because
the writer thought that, at the time he
wrote the story, the team honestly didn't
have a chance. They were 5-2, after all.
They'd just had their heads handed to
them at the National Indoors. Their dou

bles lineup was a merry-go-round.
They didn't have a chance.
The story has been different this
year: After spending the entire
season at No. 1, Stanford is now
19-1 and ranked second behind California,
which beat the Cardinal 5-4 last week.
So why the panic?
Well, there are the injuries. Stark, who
is ranked second in the country in singles,
is out for at least two weeks with a stress
fracture in his foot. He's only 18-0 in
the No. 1 spot. Palmer, who was hurt
two weekends ago and had to have sur
gery on his knee, was 12-1 playing in
different spots in the lineup.
Worse, Stark and Palmer were No. 2

nationally in doubles, which means Gould
has about four weeks to find a solid
doubles team if Stark and Palmer aren't
ready for the NCAA tournament.
They may be back, they may not be.
What happens if they don't return?
That leaves Alex O'Brien moving up
to No. 1. O'Brien, ranked 10th in the
country, is 17-2 this season. No problem.
Jeff Cathrall is at No. 2, where he spent
a good portion of last year. Should be fine.
As for the rest of the lineup, there's
Glenn (15-4) Solomon at three, Alexis
(14-2) Hombrecher at four, Jason (10-1)
Yee at five, and John Connolly — who
has played in only four matches this
season — at six.
Doubles? Not set, but what's new about
that? Three days before last year's NCAA
tournament, Gould said the team's weak
ness was its doubles play.
Needless to say, the Cardinal dropped
no doubles matches that week.
With the road trip to USC and UCLA
this weekend, the Cardinal may be in for
a little trouble. They could lose both
matches. Heck, they did last year.
They were the last two matches the
team lost.

So why the panic?
Well, there are the injuries. Stark, who
is ranked second in the country in singles,
is out for at least two weeks with a stress
fracture in his foot. He's only 18-0 in
the No. 1 spot. Palmer, who was hurt
two weekends ago and had to have sur
gery on his knee, was 12-1 playing in
different spots in the lineup.
Worse, Stark and Palmer were No. 2

nationally in doubles, which means Gould
has about four weeks to find a solid
doubles team if Stark and Palmer aren't
ready for the NCAA tournament.
They may be back, they may not be.
What happens if they don't return?
That leaves Alex O'Brien moving up
to No. 1. O'Brien, ranked 10th in the
country, is 17-2 this season. No problem.
Jeff Cathrall is at No. 2, where he spent
a good portion of last year. Should be fine.
As for the rest of the lineup, there's
Glenn (15-4) Solomon at three, Alexis
(14-2) Hombrecher at four, Jason (10-1)
Yee at five, and John Connolly — who
has played in only four matches this
season — at six.
Doubles? Not set, but what's new about
that? Three days before last year's NCAA
tournament, Gould said the team's weak
ness was its doubles play.
Needless to say, the Cardinal dropped
no doubles matches that week.
With the road trip to USC and UCLA
this weekend, the Cardinal may be in for
a little trouble. They could lose both
matches. Heck, they did last year.
They were the last two matches the
team lost.

The men's tennis team is toast. His
tory. Dead in the water. On its last
legs. Your favorite cliche here.
NCAA title? Get real. The only NCAA
title Stanford tennis will bring home this
year will be in the women's tournament,
and what's so great about another wom
en's championship? Haven't they won 26
NCAA titles in a row or something like
that?
Oh, it's only four straight. Sorry. Any
way, Coach Frank Brennan has so many
of those trophies he doesn't know what
to do. Ever seen an NCAA trophy clock
radio? Or a toaster? How 'bout a phone?
Heck, Brennan could probably use the
wood from those trophies to panel every
wall in his house.
How much of a lock are the women?
Suffice it to say the odds of them winning
the NCAA Championship for the fifth
year in a row are right down there with
the odds of today being Thursday. Put
down a half million or so, and you'll win
a buck. Maybe.
The men, though, don't have a chance
in hell.
Sorry, that's just the way it is. C'mon,
you know it's true, you just don't want

to admit it. The Cardinal mystique? For
get it. Coach Dick Gould's magic touch?
Disappeared. The singles lineup? Shaky
at best, and looking to collapse. Doubles?
In disarray.
Hey, this team almost lost to Utah. At
home. Yes, that would be the 13-12 Utes,
who are completely and totally unranked.
Injuries have killed the Cardinal.
Freshmen flashes Jonathan Stark and
Jared Palmer? Hobbling. Maybe they'll
come back, maybe they won't. Write off
1990, call it a learning year. Maybe next
year will be better.
Give me a break. Anyone who writes
off the Cardinal men — no matter
their injury situation, no matter
how shaky they may have looked against
Utah, no matter that players who have
seen no playing time at all this year now
have to step into the lineup — needs to
take a serious IQ test.
Take last year, for example.
Around five in the afternoon last May
23, Stanford tennis Coach Dick Gould
was holding an NCAA Championship
trophy on the center court in Athens, Ga.
Gould tends to end up holding trophies

quite frequently. (In fact, he has more
than Brennan.) This time, he thanked
his players, made some remarks to the
Georgia fans — the Cardinal had just
defeated the hometown Bulldogs 5-3 for
its sec rnd straight championship — and,
just before leaving, told how not everyone
at Stanford had thought the team would
be able to defend the title.
"A few months ago," Gould said, "a
sports writer in our school paper wrote
a story on the teams he thought had a
chance to win an NCAA title this year.
We weren't one of them."
Gould then allowed as to what said
writer (hey, thank goodness it wasn't the
hardworking, well-meaning scribe who
actually put in all that time covering the
team) could do with said story. Okay, so
he only said a retraction would be nice.
The retraction never came
(sportswriters are pretty good at forget
ting the predictions they make that hap
pen to be unbelievably wrong), because
the writer thought that, at the time he
wrote the story, the team honestly didn't
have a chance. They were 5-2, after all.
They'd just had their heads handed to
them at the National Indoors. Their dou

bles lineup was a merry-go-round.
They didn't have a chance.
The story has been different this
year: After spending the entire
season at No. 1, Stanford is now
19-1 and ranked second behind California,
which beat the Cardinal 5-4 last week.
So why the panic?
Well, there are the injuries. Stark, who
is ranked second in the country in singles,
is out for at least two weeks with a stress
fracture in his foot. He's only 18-0 in
the No. 1 spot. Palmer, who was hurt
two weekends ago and had to have sur
gery on his knee, was 12-1 playing in
different spots in the lineup.

nationally in doubles, which means Gould
has about four weeks to find a solid

ready for the NCAA tournament.
They may be back, they may not be.
What happens if they don't return?
That leaves Alex O'Brien moving up
to No. 1. O'Brien, ranked 10th in the
country, is 17-2 this season. No problem.
Jeff Cathrall is at No. 2, where he spent
