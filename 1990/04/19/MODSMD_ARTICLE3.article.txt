### Jonathan Eisenberg Senior staff writer 
A lot of things have changed
at Stanford since the 19705, and
the University president is one
of them.
Richard Lyman, who held the
presidency from 1970 to 1980,
remains an active observer of
campus issues with both an in

sider's and outsider's perspec
tive. As director of the Institute
for International Studies,
Lyman is no longer directly in
volved in high-level administra
tive decisions.
Because he assumed the
presidency during the height of
Vietnam War protests, Lyman
said the responsibilities of the
office were perhaps greater than

they are now. It was the "most
important" job Lyman ever
held, he said in an interview
yesterday in his office.
"The place was in dire trou
ble. There was violent up
heaval," Lyman said of his first
two years as president. He
recalled incidents of arson and

rock-throwing by large, anony
mous bands of protesters roaming
the campus at night. In contrast,
last May's takeover of University
President Donald Kennedy's office
seemed strikingly "peaceful" to
Lyman.
"I don't miss those days (the
'705).... The sense of hostility in
the air was ferocious," Lyman
said.
After about 1972, the protest
movement fizzled out, and the
University started to evolve
toward the type of institution it
is now, he said.
"I don't think it's dramatically
different (now) than it was then,"
Lyman said of the calmer campus
of the mid-'7os.
However, he said, Stanford has
luckily become a visibly more mul
ticultural university than it was
in the '70s. "When I came back
in fall 1988 (to direct the insti
tute), I was surprised at how
many non-white faces I saw," he
said. In particular, the percentage
of Asian-American students has
risen.
Also, the administration has be
come gradually "more compli
cated and more bureaucratic"
over the course of time, according
to Lyman. Both trends began dur

ing Lyman's term of office, he
noted.
Lyman oversaw two budget
reductions in the '70s, but they
were less severe than the Univer
sity's current slashing and stream
lining plans. Speaking from
experience, he said the reposition
ing effort will be "hard to do at
best."
The University also undertook
a big fund-raising campaign dur
ing Lyman's term of office, similar
to the current Centennial Cam
paign.
After a decade as president,
Lyman stepped down from the po
sition in 1980 to become president
of the Rockefeller Foundation.
Ten years was "a fair run at it"
for Lyman, who emphasized that
the presidency of Stanford re
quires a tremendous amount of
energy.
In fact, Lyman said he "stands
in awe of [Kennedy's] phenomenal
energy" and ability to maintain
enthusiasm for the job every day.
Lyman said he was pleased that
Kennedy's vision of "Stanford in
its Second Century" — a speech
to the Academic Council April 5
— included an emphasis on the
growing importance of interna
tional and interdisciplinary
studies.
Lyman said he opposes contin
ued use of the Fundamental
Standard because it is too
"general" and "obsolete."

"It almost says, 'Everybody be
good,' " quipped Lyman.
As a result, Lyman said he
thinks efforts to interpret the
Fundamental Standard to address
verbal harassment will be futile.
Moreover, Lyman said he ques
tions if better relations between
students of different cultural
backgrounds can be achieved
through "judicial proceedings."
Education would seem to be the
answer to Lyman.
Lyman praised the growth of
public service opportunities at
Stanford, which he said he con
siders a replacement of "political
confrontation" by students.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Freelen, who has worked
at the Public Affairs office since
1972, said Lyman and Kennedy
had "similar styles" in office in
some respects, although Lyman
tended to be more reserved.
Lyman was "less of a
cheerleader-type" than Kennedy,
according to William Stone,
Alumni Association executive di
rector and former Lyman assis
tant. However, Lyman faced more
"messy subjects," including the
anti-war protests, when he was
president, Stone added.
Intending to retire from full
time work after three-and-a-half
more years at the Institute for
International Studies, Lyman said
he might write a book.

As a result, Lyman said he
thinks efforts to interpret the
Fundamental Standard to address
verbal harassment will be futile.
Moreover, Lyman said he ques
tions if better relations between
students of different cultural
backgrounds can be achieved
through "judicial proceedings."
Education would seem to be the
answer to Lyman.
Lyman praised the growth of
public service opportunities at
Stanford, which he said he con
siders a replacement of "political
confrontation" by students.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Freelen, who has worked
at the Public Affairs office since
1972, said Lyman and Kennedy
had "similar styles" in office in
some respects, although Lyman
tended to be more reserved.
Lyman was "less of a
cheerleader-type" than Kennedy,
according to William Stone,
Alumni Association executive di
rector and former Lyman assis
tant. However, Lyman faced more
"messy subjects," including the
anti-war protests, when he was
president, Stone added.
Intending to retire from full
time work after three-and-a-half
more years at the Institute for
International Studies, Lyman said
he might write a book.
