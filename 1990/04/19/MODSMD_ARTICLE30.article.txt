# Gymnasts head off to NCAAs â€” alone
## 
### Amy Howard Staff writer 
Although a heartbreaking fifth
place finish in the Western Re
gional meet denied the Stanford
men's gymnastics team a trip to
the NCAA Championships this
year, the season is not over for
three outstanding gymnasts. Sen
iors Charles Loop, Conrad
Voorsanger, and freshman Jair
Lynch will make the trip to Min
neapolis to represent the Cardinal
individually in the NCAA compe
tition this weekend.
Despite the disappointment of
having to compete without the
rest of the team, the three gym
nasts will seek to bolster Stan
ford's reputation in the
gymnastics world. Since many
recruits consider a team's per
formance in the NCAA Champi
onships when making their final
decisions, the three gymnasts
carry a piece of the team's future
on their shoulders.
"I feel like I'm competing for
six other guys as well as myself,"
Loop said. "We are going to be
setting the pace for Stanford gym
nastics, so there is some pressure
to do well."
Unlike Voorsanger and Loop,
who both had to wait until their
sophomore years for a taste of
national collegiate competition,
Lynch looks to gain "big meet"
experience early on.
"It feels weird because the
whole year has been team-oriented
and now we're separated, even in
workouts" Lynch said. "But I just
want to go in and do my sets,
and prove to everyone that pres
sure doesn't affect me."
If he does his best, it could
mean a repeat of his first place
finish in the optional competition

at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships. His teammates
seem confident that he'll meet
with success in his first trip to
NCAAs. "I'll go out on a limb and
say that Jair wins pommel horse
(this weekend)," Loop said confi
dently.
Both Lynch and Loop will be
competing in the optional all
around competition today and
compulsory all-arounds on
Saturday, with a break in be
tween. Voorsanger, who was not
able to compete in the all-around
competition at regionals due to
an ankle injury, qualified for both
parallel bars and rings.
According to the gymnasts,
competing as individuals gives the
meet a slightly different twist. For
example, it puts them at a slight
judging disadvantage during the
optional events. Members of a
team compete in order of worst
to best, which means the gymnast
who competes last will be expected
to get a higher score than the
first gymnast up.
Without a full team, the judges
will not have the sequential
buildup of scores to use as a ref
erence point when judging the
Stanford gymnasts. According to
Loop, this might result in a full
point reduction in their all-around
scores.
On the other hand, the Cardinal
trio has become accustomed to
doing well all season under less
than-perfect conditions. Coach
Sadao Hamada had praise for
them all. "They have truly been
the most outstanding gymnasts
this year," he said. "Conrad and
Charles have shown good leader
ship throughout the season, and
Jair is the rising star of U.S. gym
nastics."
