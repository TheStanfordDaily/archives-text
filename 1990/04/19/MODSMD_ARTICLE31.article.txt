# Kamerschen campaigns for Card title
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
Every good baseball team
has good leaders. Guys who are
strong with both their actions
and their words are the cor
nerstone of any successful pro
gram. Stanford has a good
baseball team partly because
such a person exists in pitcher
Robert Kamerschen.
"A lot of the success we have,
we owe to Robbie," Coach Mark
Marquess said. "It is unique to
have a player of his ability and
make-up. I don't know where
we would be without him —
he is an integral part of the
team."
Integral and very necessary.
One of only five seniors on a
staff that is dominated by
youth, Kamerschen gives to the
team the kind of experience
that helps to teach confidence.
Kamerschen is one of only
three pitchers on the team who
has pitched in the NCAA tour
nament, and being part of two
national championship teams,
he knows how to win. Passing
on this knowledge to the
younger players is a role that
Kamerschen takes seriously.
"I'd like to think that I am
(a leader) in some way," he
said. "Being on the team for
four years, I think I'm close to
a lot of the guys. The pitchers
happen to spend a lot of time
together, that's just the nature
of the game.
"Along with the Spencers
and Mussinas, and some of
those other guys who pitched
a lot in '88 with me, there is
the understanding that we
have done it, we have played
in the NCAAs, we have lettered
on those (championship)

teams. Tranferring that to the
younger guys is important."
It is also important to the
rest of the team. Kamerschen
is that kind of rare individual
who is respected for his role
on the team by the whole team,
not just with those who he has
the most contact.
"Kamerschen is a great
leader," leftfielder Ryan
Turner said. "On the field he
is a good pitcher, but off the
field I think he is almost as
valuable. There are some
leaders who lead by action, and
some who lead verbally, and he
basically does both. He is the
perfect leader. He is a great
guy — very open, very acces
sible."
After failing to make the
NCAAs last year, the 35-7 Car
dinal is hungry for another trip
back to Omaha, and are looking
to Kamerschen as someone who
can help get them there. His
actions have spoken volumes to
the Stanford team and fans.
Kamerschen can make the
amazing boast of never having
lost a game in his career. Used
primarily as a reliever, the
righthander is 7-0 lifetime in
a Cardinal uniform.
Due to arm injury last year,
Kamerschen's big year came
two years ago when he went
6-0 with a 3.91 ERA as a soph
omore. Feeling 100 percent this
year, the 6-foot-l, 190-pounder
would be seeing more time in
middle relief if Stan Spencer
and Mike Mussina did not
make such a habit of pitching
complete games.
Even with his limited time,
Kamerschen has recorded a win
against Santa Clara and a save

Cardinal pitcher Robbie Kamerschen was an outstanding two-sport
athlete In high school. He quarterbacked the football team to an
undefeated season and No. 3 national ranking his senior year. The
same year, he was Georgia's Player of the Year In baseball.
against the University of the
Pacific. He is confident both of
his health and his skills.
"I came here as an 18-year-old
with an 18-year-old arm, and now
I'm a 22-year-old with more than
a 22-year-old's arm. I've had on
and-off arm problems, but right
now I'm healthy," Kamerschen
said. "I'm throwing the ball as
hard as I ever have now, and this
is the first time in the last year
that I can honestly say that."
Kamerschen is a legitimate pro
prospect. As a control pitcher with
a good slider, he does not over
power the batter. But that is not
what he is trying to do.
Ask him yourself and he will
tell you that he is not trying to
strike out the side; a good day is
when he allows easy grounders
and flyballs. He is a good pitcher,
not a great one, but he does what
we all wish we could. He wins.
"His pitching is of average

caliber," said catcher Bryan
Taylor. "The thing that saves him
is his competitiveness. He has
been in athletics all his life and
he has won all his life. You can't
judge that, it's an attitude."
Winning has been a way of life
for Kamerschen. In high school,
he was your basic two-sport su
perstar. The quarterback of Clark
Central High in Athens, Ga., he
led the team to a 15-0 record and
a No. 3 national ranking his senior
year.
As a pitcher he went 25-4 with
a 1.30 ERA during his career, and
10-0 with a 0.49 ERA his senior
year. Kamerschen ended his high
school baseball career as Georgia
Player of the Year, and was named
a high school All-American by the
magazine Baseball America.
Add to this the fact that he was
student body president, National
Honor Society member, captain of
the football team and dating a
cheerleader, and you have the
American Dream that recruiters
love. Kamerschen got letters from
everybody, but chose Stanford for

its challenge.
"Stanford appealed to me in
that of all the schools I was
recruited by, it was the one school
where I could fail academically
and athletically," Kamerschen
said.
He has failed in neither. Along
with his baseball exploits,
Kamerschen is a political science
major with a 3.5 GPA and is on
the board of directors of the Vol
unteers for Youth program at
Stanford. He has already gotten
accepted by the Duke and George
town law schools, and hopes that
after a shot at pro ball he can go
back to Georgia and go into pol
itics.
"I want to give something back
to the community that I came
from,"he said.
Politics are, of course, perfect
for Kamerschen. A leader of
people and a master of oratory,
Kamerschen will probably go far.
Assuming he does, and knowing
what kind of person he is, Georgia
might be a nice place to cast a
vote in a few years.
