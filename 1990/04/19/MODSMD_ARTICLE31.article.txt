# Kamerschen campaigns for Card title
## 
### T.C. Hall Staff writer 
Every good baseball team
has good leaders. Guys who are
strong with both their actions
and their words are the cor
nerstone of any successful pro
gram. Stanford has a good
baseball team partly because
such a person exists in pitcher
Robert Kamerschen.
"A lot of the success we have,
we owe to Robbie," Coach Mark
Marquess said. "It is unique to
have a player of his ability and
make-up. I don't know where
we would be without him —
he is an integral part of the
team."
Integral and very necessary.
One of only five seniors on a
staff that is dominated by
youth, Kamerschen gives to the
team the kind of experience
that helps to teach confidence.
Kamerschen is one of only
three pitchers on the team who
has pitched in the NCAA tour
nament, and being part of two
national championship teams,
he knows how to win. Passing
on this knowledge to the
younger players is a role that
Kamerschen takes seriously.
"I'd like to think that I am
(a leader) in some way," he
said. "Being on the team for
four years, I think I'm close to
a lot of the guys. The pitchers
happen to spend a lot of time
together, that's just the nature
of the game.
"Along with the Spencers
and Mussinas, and some of
those other guys who pitched
a lot in '88 with me, there is
the understanding that we
have done it, we have played
in the NCAAs, we have lettered
on those (championship)

teams. Tranferring that to the
younger guys is important."
It is also important to the
rest of the team. Kamerschen
is that kind of rare individual
who is respected for his role
on the team by the whole team,
not just with those who he has
the most contact.
"Kamerschen is a great
leader," leftfielder Ryan
Turner said. "On the field he
is a good pitcher, but off the
field I think he is almost as
valuable. There are some
leaders who lead by action, and
some who lead verbally, and he
basically does both. He is the
perfect leader. He is a great
guy — very open, very acces
sible."
After failing to make the
NCAAs last year, the 35-7 Car
dinal is hungry for another trip
back to Omaha, and are looking
to Kamerschen as someone who
can help get them there. His
actions have spoken volumes to
the Stanford team and fans.
Kamerschen can make the
amazing boast of never having
lost a game in his career. Used
primarily as a reliever, the
righthander is 7-0 lifetime in
a Cardinal uniform.
Due to arm injury last year,
Kamerschen's big year came
two years ago when he went
6-0 with a 3.91 ERA as a soph
omore. Feeling 100 percent this
year, the 6-foot-l, 190-pounder
would be seeing more time in
middle relief if Stan Spencer
and Mike Mussina did not
make such a habit of pitching
complete games.
Even with his limited time,
Kamerschen has recorded a win
against Santa Clara and a save
