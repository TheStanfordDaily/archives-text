# Blackman sets, psyches Cardinal spikers to playoffs
## Emotional team leader soars above taller opponents 
### Harold Yu Staff writer 
During every warm-up before a
match, Stanford senior setter Parker
Blackman ceases his exercises a little
early and traverses the circle of stretch
ing players, emphatically slapping hands
with each.
"It's just a little thing to get every
body pumped up," Blackman explained.
Yet, this "little" task becomes a
curiously big one to others who similarly
attempt it.
"Dave Goss and I tried to do that (at
Long Beach when Parker was injured),"
swing hitter and brother Duncan Black
man said. "It wasn't the same at all."
Most team members will admit that
it shouldn't be. For if there is one thing
that Blackman's cohorts agree upon, it
is that without him, the Cardinal isn't
the same at all.
Physically, a Parker Blackman-led
Cardinal is readily different. At 5-foot
-11, Blackman is among the shortest
setters in a growing volleyball world.
He is reduced to dwarf status among
high towers like teammate Adam Keefe
and USC's 6-foot-8 Bryan Ivie. His
height is so disturbing to some that,
during high school recruiting, UCLA in
tentionally bypassed the two-time CIF
Player of the Year. Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm was a little more perceptive.
"Parker understands his limitations,"
Sturm said. "But he doesn't let his
limitations prevent him from playing at
another level. It's a credit to him that
he can play at that level."
And it's a credit to Sturm that he
recognized it. Armed with a ferocious
leap and a hitter's instincts developed
through high school, Blackman has con
sistently defied physical logic during his
four years of play.
Consistently "roofing" foes of far
greater height in actual competition,
Blackman can often be seen solo block
ing his own high-flying teammates
during practice. Despite being a setter
— and a short one at that — Blackman
has recorded four solo blocks this year
along with 27 block assists.
Most fascinating is Blackman's
revised version of the "dump." Instead
of softly lofting a pass over unsuspecting
blockers, Blackman often completely un
loads on a well-passed ball, striking it

'I'm a little nuts. I'm sure
[my teammates] think I'm
too intense. But i want to
win really badly.'

with fevered tenacity.
"Having Dan (Hanan) and Craig
(Forsyth) up there makes me look good,"
Blackman said. "They take some block
ers with them, which gives me a free
swing at the ball." Against USC, Black
man recorded six kills in seven attacks
for an astounding .857 hitting percent
age.
While watching the diminutive Black
man make high-altitude opponents look
silly always manages to spark an un
suspecting crowd, teammates uniquely
value him for something perhaps even
more visible on the court: emotion.
"Parker's such an intense guy," brother
Duncan said. "He's very good at ex
pressing what he feels. He totally fires
us up."
Coach Sturm shudders to consider
the team without him. "We have a very
quiet team," Sturm said. "Parker gives
us what we lack in emotion."
Screaming vociferously at all times,
Blackman is always the first on the
squad to praise a teammates' efforts
and the first to take fault for another's
mistakes. After diving crazily for
shanked balls he has no business
retrieving or attempting to convert hor
rendous passes into perfect sets,
Blackman explodes in fury when he
fails.
"I'm a little nuts," Blackman admits.
"I'm sure fmy teammates] think I'm
too intense. But I want to win really
badly."
And he does. Last weekend, starting
for the first time since an ankle sprain
against Loyola-Marymount, Blackman
directed an offense that hit to near per
fection in two consecutive matches.
Against USC, Blackman set the Cardi
nal to an other-worldly .425 hitting per
centage and assisted as six Stanford
attackers hit over .420 in the match.
San Diego State likewise suffered as
Blackman's hitters posted a .436 mark
on the night.

While many performances like these
often escape the attention of fans, Black
man never slows to consider it."I don't
care who they give the recognition to
as long as we win," Blackman said.
"Whether I'm All-League or All-
American doesn't matter to me unless
we win the national championship."
A scenario that has suddenly become
all the more plausible thanks largely to
him. "Parker was part of Stanford's up
ward move to the top," Sturm said.
"He's played as big a role as any other
in the program. When Parker was in
jured, all of us recognized how much
Parker contributes."
That realization has seized more
neutral observers as well. When asked
to name the best collegiate team in the
nation, Coach Ken Preston of playoff
bound UC-Santa Barbara identified
"Stanford with Parker Blackman."
Perhaps no one can better appreciate
his efforts than Parker's own brother,
Duncan. One of the nation's premier
swing hitters, Duncan Blackman has
sometimes found himself questioning
his motivation. As with all his team
mates, Parker Blackman invariably in
tercedes. "Parker's able to yell at me
like no one can," Duncan Blackman
said. "He's always been there to help
us along."
Even when sometimes — as Parker
Blackman has so admirably demonstra
ted — a hand-slap is all that it takes.
Card notes
Long Beach State defeated USC in a five
game match at USC last night to clinch sole
possession of first place in the Wilson Divi
sion of the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association with a 14-2 record. USC, Stan
ford and Hawaii all tied for second with
12-4 marks.
The league's tiebreaker is head-to-head
competition and Stanford went 3-1 against
the other two; USC went 2-2 and Hawaii
was 1-3. Thus Stanford placed second in the
division, USC third and Hawaii missed the
playoffs in fourth.
Stanford will now meet UC-Santa Barbara
and USC will meet Cal State-Northridge on
the first day of the WTVA tournament Wed
nesday night in Northridge. The winner of
the Stanford-UCSB match will play UCLA
the following night and the winner of the
Northridge-USC match will play Long Beach
State.

him most for his leadership.
