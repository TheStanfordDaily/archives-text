Stanford requests
toxics mediator
Stanford has asked a group
of present and past tenants of
the Stanford Research Park to
join with it in immediate
mediation if they cannot other
wise reach agreement over the
cost for Stanford to participate
in a toxics cleanup.
Negotiations on the cleanup
of the Hill view-Porter ground
water pollution site in the Re
search Park have been rela
tively unsuccessful to this
point.
The high-tech companies and
community members have ac
cused Stanford of not being a
full participant of the cleanup,
which is expected to take at
least two decades and cost
several million dollars. Stan
ford officials have said that the
University's overtures have
been rejected by the companies.
In a letter to the state De
partment of Health Services,
Stanford wrote that the group
of companies had sought to
"portray Stanford as non
cooperating, when in fact Stan
ford has a strong willingness
to cooperate — both financially
and programmatically — in

seeing that the site is properly
investigated and remediated by
present and past users."
As landlord to tenants in the
Research Park, Stanford says
it has not contributed to any
toxics that have found their
way into Matadero Creek and
the groundwater flowing under
Barron Park, a residential
neighborhood in Palo Alto.
Earth Day run
slated for Sunday
In celebration of Earth Day
1990, a non-competitive, five
kilometer run will be held Sun
day at 8 a.m.
Starting at Angell Field, the
run will circle around the
campus and end at Frost Am
phitheater.
Two other significant activ
ities are scheduled for Earth
Day 1990. At 7 a.m. early-risers
can attend a sunrise ceremony
before the run. Then at 9 a.m.
an Earth Day rally will com
bine speakers and music at
Frost.
The race day fee is $15. But
for students with identification,
senior citizens and children un
der 16, the race day fee is $11.
Preregistration saves $3.
