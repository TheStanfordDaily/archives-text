Reflecting interest in a wide variety of de
partments and fields, eight Stanford students
yesterday received the Dean's Award for Ac
ademic Achievement.
Receiving the awards were seniors Pamela
Ballinger, Todd Feldman, Katherine Kubicek,
Aamer Mumtaz, Krystle Quynh Pham and
Jorge Velazquez and coterminal students Ali
Tabibian and Connie Man Shan Tang. Their
departments, respectively, are anthropology,
computer science and classics, classics, Ger
man, biological sciences, history, electrical en-

gineering, and industrial engineering.
The awards, according to Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Charles Junkerman,
are conferred upon students who have distin
guished themselves in one or more academic
pursuits.
"This is an award for some sort of achieve
ment .. . not for overall academic success,"
said Junkerman. The goal of the awards, he
said, is "to reward and encourage students,
to put their minds and their talents toward
something they're passionately engaged in."
Faculty members, usually advisers,
nominate candidates during winter quarter.

Dean of Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow and three assistant deans then review
nomination letters and transcripts. The
awards are based on achievement and recom
mendations, according to Junkerman. Class
and department are not considered in the
selection process.
The honor came as "quite a shock" to award
winner Pham. "I was very, very happy and
quite taken aback. It seems like everyone at
Stanford is deserving," Pham said.
The awards consist of acknowledgement, a
certificate and a gift book.
