# Changes for co-ops suggested in report
## 
### Michelle Lin 
Co-op houses at Stanford
should begin an outreach pro
gram, create a co-op union and
promote ethnic and multicul
tural diversity, according to a
recently released report.
Compiled by students and in
structors of a winter quarter
SWOPSI course called "Co
operative Living at Stanford,"
the detailed report suggests
some changes to improve co-op
living arrangements at Stan
ford.
The class recommended the
outreach program because, the
report says, students do not
know enough about co-ops.
Further, the report says a co-op
union is necessary to foster a
community spirit among the
co-ops.
The future of co-ops was
challenged when the Oct. 17

earthquake damaged three of
the seven co-op houses on
campus — Columbae, Phi Psi
and Synergy — closing them
indefinitely at the time.
Madeline Larsen and other
alumni then collaborated with
the University to create the
SWOPSI class dealing with the
co-op hosuing problem.
"The class gave me a broader
idea of what co-op living is,"
said junior Raquel Stote, a res
ident of the co-op house Ham
marskjold.
The report compiled by the
SWOPSI class also suggests
that the University build more
co-op houses. Despite this rec
ommendation and favorable re
sponses from co-op residents,
there are no plans to construct
more co-op houses in the near
future, according to Keith Guy,
director of Housing and Food
Services.
