## EVITA! Ram's Head production packed with punch, flair 
### David Bianco Staff writer 
THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

"Eva, beware your ambition. . ."
sings Magaldi, the heartthrob
nightclub singer in "Evita". This
truly ambitious Spring Musical
production by Ram's Head opens
tomorrow with an array of stun
ning performances and musical
numbers. Students need not
beware attending.
"Evita" is the story of the rise
to power of Argentine peasant
turned-actress-turned-politician
Eva Peron, the greediest First Lady
this side of Imelda Marcos.
Junior Michele Moreno, who is
Mexican-American, leads the show
in the title role. She succeeds in
portraying the subtleties of a char
acter that combines charisma with
egotism, a love of power with a
wealth of spirit. The role of Evita
is demanding, but Moreno rises to
the occasion and handles the range
of music and emotion with poise
and flair.
But during the familiar Lloyd
Webber ditty "Don't Cry for me
Argentina," Moreno sings "Ar-hen
tina," which may be the correct
pronunciation but is nonetheless
jarring and detracts from an other
wise well-sung tune. During the
rest of the show, the cast uses the
Anglicized pronunciation and
Moreno's version (as suggested by
director Diana Joseph) comes off
as more of a political statement
than an attempt at realism.
As Eva climbs Argentina's social
ladder, she uses men of ever
increasing influence to advance her
career. Eventually she encounters
General luan Peron, portrayed
solidly by sophomore Jason Win
dawi. Windawi is perfectly cast as
the charming yet hesitant
politician whom Eva manipulates
into running for President of Ar
gentina.
The entire show is narrated by
Ch6 Guevara, a Cuban revolution
ary who historically never crossed
paths with the Perons but none

theless provides an important dis
senting voice amid the enthusiasm
for Eva's rise. Ch6 is played by
graduate student Adi Wyner.
Wyner, who is appearing in his
first musical, uses his remarkable
vocal talent to portray Ch6's
cynicism and anger at Argentina's
love affair with Evita. One of the
highlights of the show is Wyner's
splendid parody of Spanish, Italian
and French accents during the en
joyable number "Rainbow Tour."
Moreno, Windawi and Wyner do
not get all the credit for the show's
success. Kathy Boline portrays
Peron's rejected mistress. Her only
number, "Another Suitcase in An
other Hall," is surprisingly one of
the best performances of the night.
Also strong is Ben Evans as a com
ical Magaldi.
But "Evita" is at heart an en
semble show, with a chorus of 30.
The versatile cast portrays every
thing from mourners to aristocrats
to generals to descamisados â€” the
"shirtless ones" on whose votes
and loyalty the Perons built their
regime. The cast's talent for song
and dance produce show-stopping
numbers such as "Peron's Latest
Flame" and "Rolling."
Allen Blue's set is a four-leveled
jungle gym that allows the produc
tion to make full use of Memorial
Auditorium's large stage. The va
riety of stages on the set does be
come awkward, however, during
"The Art of the Possible," when a
military game of musical chairs is
forced to take place on two differ
ent levels.
"Evita" is a marvelous show. As
producer lay Jay Kuo put it, "We
like 'Evita' because it's a big show:
It's grandiose, it's Andrew Lloyd
Webber, and it's musically de
manding." Kuo contrasted the
operatic nature of "Evita" to last
year's production of "A Chorus
Line," which focused on dance.
Nonetheless, "Evita" still exhibits
excellent dance numbers, many of
which have a Latin flair.
