# Who is the Public Enemy today?

"I got so much trouble on my mind
I refuse to lose"
— Public Enemy, "Welcome To the Tfer
rordome"
"Fear of a Black Planet."
Public Enemy's long-awaited, controversial
third album was only a mysterious, intriguing
title in the minds of the public for many
months. However, when the album was fi

nally released last week after multiple delays,
two things were undeniable.
The controversy is justified, and the wait
was worth it.
From the opening beats of the
optimistically-titled instrumental "Contract
On the World Love lam/' to the stark violence
of "War at 33 1/3" and "Final Count of the
Collision Between Us and the Damned,"
Chuck D and Flavor Flav provide 63 minutes
of scathing social commentary on our society
and the war between the races.

And Chuck has much trouble on his mind.
From the inefficiencies of the emergency
medical assistance system (the Flavor Flav
cut "911 Is A loke") to AIDS; from interracial
dating and marriage to the inhuman treat
ment of the black woman; from the racism
of Hollywood to the exploitation of black
musicians; Public Enemy, as is their
trademark, pulls no punches.
Beneath all the specific messages is an

undercurrent of black nationalism,
even a rage against the evil white
oppressors.
Detecting similar tones in the
rap group's previous two albums,
particularly in 1988's multi
platinum "It Takes A Nation of
Millions To Hold Us Back," some
critics have charged Public Enemy
with an all-out hatred of white
people.

These accusations were fur
thered and given some legitimacy
when Public Enemy's so-called
"Minister of Information," Profes
sor Griff, made anti-Semitic re
marks to a journalist last fall. The
media jumped on the comments
as indicative of Public Enemy's
beliefs, and negative articles about
the group multiplied.
As if this issue alone wasn't
enough to spark controversy and
delay the album, the lyrics and
song titles add fuel to the fire of
the group's detractors. One of the
many interlude/instrumental cuts
on the album even gives some of
these people's points of view, in
the guise of a call-in talk show.
One "angry caller," in a very
upper-middle-class voice, claimed
to have seen the group in concert
"warming up for the Beastie Boys.
... I thought it was one of the
most appalling things I'd ever seen
. . . and when I see someone
wearing one of their shirts, I think
they're scum too."
The song title indicates what the
group thinks of the critics: "Inci
dent at 66.6 FM." Other "in your

face" titles on the album include
"Pollywanacraka," "Anti-Nigger
Machine," "Burn Hollywood
Burn," and the instrumental
"Leave This Off Your Fu*kin
Charts."
But beyond controversial lyrics
and messages, Public Enemy is
about the music. The majority of
their fans are fans of rap music,
and Public Enemy puts out some
of the best hip-hop around. The
first single, "Welcome To the Ter
rordome," is vintage Chuck D rap.
As on their previous album, all
of Public Enemy's ferocious raps
are backed not only by scratches
and beats but an omnipresent
high-pitched whine. As much as
any of the lyrics, that sound com
municates the anger and frustra
tion of the group.
But Public Enemy is not entirely
"gloom-and-doom" and negativity.
The album's first song is of the
"uplift the race" genre, and is ap
propriately titled "Brothers Gonna
Work It Out."
The highlights of the music in
clude the title track, possibly the
best rap on the album, which has
both a rhythmic beat and a thump
ing bass track.
"Power To the People" and
"Revolutionary Generation" also
go beyond the politics and lay
down devestating, non-stop
rhyming with good beats. The
thematic "Who Stole the Soul" and
"Burn Hollywood Burn" are solid,
with the latter getting some help
from fellow big-time rap artists Big
Daddy Kane and Ice-T.
Perhaps the funniest moment on
the album is when Chuck, Flavor,
Kane and Ice go to the movies
despite their reservations about the
roles that blacks have historically
played in Hollywood. When they
get there, the feature presentation
is announced: "Driving Miss
Daisy."
