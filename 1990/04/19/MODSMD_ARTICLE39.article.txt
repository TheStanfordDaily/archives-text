# Animation is fun
## 
### Kelly Parsons Staff writer 
Chuck Jones, the creative genius
behind such classic animated char
acters as Wile E. Coyote, the
Roadrunner and Pepe Le Pew, once
wrote that the "great wonder of
animation is not the illusion of
life but life itself."
These days, however, most
animators have abandoned the
high standards of craftsmanship
set by Tones, Walt Disney and other
master cartoonists during the so
called "Golden Age of Cartoons,"
the years immediately following
World War 11. Relying on a pro
duction line approach to anima
tion, many of today's animators
churn out dull, unimaginative car
toons which amount to little more
than talking slides.
Unlike the films of loncs and
other true animators, these pre
packaged, listless creations fail
miserably in their attempts to
breathe "life" into their characters.
Animation lovers need not fear.
The art of animation is alive and
well in the"The Festival of Anima
tion '90," a compilation of 17
animated short subiccts currently
playing at Gunn High School in
Palo Alto
Producers James Terry and Craig
Livaich have assembled together a
wonderfully rich collection of films
from around the world, all of which
prove that there arc still animators
who approach their craft with
devotion, love and, most impor
tantly, humor.
Although most of the films arc
imaginatively constructed and
well-executed, a few do stand out
from the rest. "The Hill Farm",

an Academy Award-nominated
short by British filmaker Mark
Baker, wryly follows the day-to-day
activities of a small family of farm
ers. The film is extremely funny
and masterfully directed.
Baker wisely shys away from vis
ual complexity, keeping the struc
tures of the animated images
limited to basic geometric figures.
Consequently, he successfully
focuses the audience's attention on
the film's simple yet touching
story.
"Family Dog," another of the
Festival's highlights, relates the in
dignities suffered by a typical
pooch as he struggles to cope with
the abuses heaped upon him by
his nightmarish owners. Feature
film director Tim Burton, who
began his career as an animator
for Disney, created "Family Dog."
Although the eight-minute clip
shown at the Festival is a freeze
dried version of the original 24
minute film, it is still able to paint
a hilarious satire of suburban life.
As seen through the eyes of the
poor, unjustly abused dog, the fam
ily appears as a demented group
of individuals out only to satisfy
their own selfish interests at the
expense of their befuddled pet.
The Festival also features the
latest creation of Oscar-winning
computer animator John Lasseter,
Knickknack." Lasseter and his
group at Pixar have consistently
delivered extremely clever shorts
that utilize state of the art com
puter imagery, and "Knickknack"
is no exception to this trend.
