# Corporations help engineering students design solutions
##

With help from private corporations,
Stanford engineering students are using
their skills to solve real-world problems.
For example, the Mechanical Engineer
ing Department's design division has
worked with companies for years on
design problems provided by corpora
tions. For the past 15 years the depart
ment has run a program in which
companies pay a membership fee to sup
port technical courses at Stanford.
In exchange for solving their problems,
the companies pay for equipment and
teaching assistants. In almost all cases,
"the sponsoring corporation retains
ownership of the prototype," says Me
chanical Engineering Prof. Larry Leifer.
In some cases, if the students develop a
patentable design, they have their names
attached to the patent.
Leifer says the corporations give the

department $500 to $20,000 for each
course, depending on the scope of the
budget agreed upon. The smaller number
is typical of a 10-week undergraduate
course.
Besides the money, the corporations
provide "realistic problems, access to cur
rent industrial information and a strong
motivating influence," Leifer says.
Leifer says the Mechanical Engineering
Department depends on the companies
to give students a feeling for how en
gineers work in the industrial sector. He
and other professors say the lack of cor
porate involvement would reduce the in
tellectual curriculum of the department.
When Frederick Terman built the
School of Engineering into a great insti
tution, part of his original vision was to
create ties between academia and indus
trial research. That vision was one of the
primary reasons Stanford founded the
Stanford Research Park.
History Prof. Joseph Corn says there

The American university has always been very
much a vehicle for larger social concerns and
not necessarily configured for reflecting the
desires of intellectuals.'
â€” Joseph Corn

is nothing new about corporate involve
ment in universities. He mentions the
example of the Burlington Railroad,
which donated a locomotive engine for
engineering students at Purdue Univer
sity in the 19th century.
While some intellectuals may see cor
porate involvement as intrusive, Corn
says,"The American university has al
ways been very much a vehicle for larger
social concerns and not necessarily con

figured for reflecting the desires of in
tellectuals."
Robert Anderson, a graduate mechan
ical engineering student in the three
quarter long Mechanical Engineering 210
sequence, is working with two other stu
dents on an "active aerodynamics" system
for General Motors cars. The project in
volves creating a series of wings placed
on the car that would move to enhance
a car's braking and turning.

Anderson says much of the technology
involved in the project was new to them,
and at first it was difficult to arrive at
the detailed specifications for each of the
wings.
Anderson says the course is "a big
eye-opener" for students without any in
dustrial experience. He said the course
entrusts students with "the responsibility
of handling a budget for the first time."
Anderson's team had to deal with
buying hardware for the prototype,
buying computer time to do their analysis
and even buying the services of outside
analysts to do some of the heavier com
putation.
"The nature of project work is there
are a lot of avenues where you have to
make decisions, and there are turns that
can lead you astray," Anderson says.
"There's a large potential for wasted
time."
He adds, "It takes a lot of leg
work, but it's quite constructive
and really expands one's mind."
Stanford computer science stu
dents got a chance to work on the
state-of-the-art Next computer
before it was introduced to private
users. Paul Hegarty, a Next en
gineer, started a course on
"object-oriented user interfaces"
last autumn, which used the Next
computer. Hegarty, a Stanford
graduate, says he felt the topic
was important for students to
learn, and the Next computer
"was a perfect platform to teach
this."
Instead of the very rigid struc
tured programming that charac
terizes other programming
languages, the use of special com
puter functions, called "objects,"
obviates the need to control in
formation flow.
The objects are functions that
perform a task as well as all the
tasks of lower-level functions.
Whenever an object is called upon
to perform a task, all the infor
mation that needs to be sent to

other parts of the program will
be transmitted automatically.
Thus, the only thing a program
mer needs to be concerned with
is what the object is and what it
does, and not how it fits in with
other functions.
Hegarty says object-oriented
programming will soon be the new
standard for computer program
ming. "I can't see people sticking
with C or Pascal," he says. The
course benefits Next by having
students familiar with the system
because students who will go on
to create software after gradua
tion will use the Next's process.
"It benefits us," Hegarty says, "to
have more people who can do
object-oriented interface sys
tems."
While Next may benefit, the
company contributed no equip
ment or money to the course,
although it did provide the in
structor. Next allowed Hegarty
the time to work on the course
as well as access to "0.9" versions
of the Next computer, which are
those machines released to
programmers and companies
before the Next was available to
the general public. The machines
are essentially the same in design,
but they are released earlier.
