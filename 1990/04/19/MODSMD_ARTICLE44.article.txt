## Gods sequel doesn't measure up 
### Alex Kostich Staff writer 
In 1984, South African film director Jamie Uys
had a runaway hit with his comic anthropological
look at clashing cultures in"The Gods Must Be
Crazy." The film was an innocent, fresh and very
hilarious caper in which a discarded Coke bottle was
discovered by a curious bushman. The foreign object,
so common in our civilized world, turned the bush
man's tribe on its ear and provided for an infinite
number of sight gags.
Apparently, Uys has worked on a sequel for four
years, and the result is a mixed bag of bright moments
and dull jokes. For starters, a sequel to a film like
"The Gods Must Be Crazy" is completely unnec
cesary; the original was a well-constructed story with
a definite ending, and any continuation would have
been forced and contrived. "The Gods Must Be Crazy
II" is exactly that — it seems to be an aimless
epilogue, wandering through the Kalahari Desert set
ting with none of the clever originality of its predeces
sor.
N!xau, a bushman-turned-Hollywood-celebrity,
reprises his role as Xixo, the innocent savage plagued
by modern civilization. In this episode, his two
children are accidently whisked away by a truck,
which the bushmen think is some sort of wild beast
with circular, rotating feet.
What follows is a kind of low budget adventure

OThe Gods Must Be Crazy II
NlXau

film inspired by "Indiana Jones." In the endless search
for his offspring, Xixo encounters a bumbling New
York attorney (whose dress is hitched up over her
head in several sight gags), a pair of elephant poachers
and two soldiers.
In spite of its uninteresting mess of a plot, "The
Gods Must Be Crazy II" is infinitely funnier than
any of the "comedies" which Hollywood cranks out
each week. The deadpan National Geographic- style
voiceover that narrates the film is both informative
and humorous, and the sight gags never cease.
Several wild animals have prominent roles in the
film, chasing their human costars up trees and
boulders. Director Uys often speeds up the film to
fast-motion in order to milk laughs from his audicnce.
It's a cheap tactic, but it works. Small children will
undoubtedly be delighted.
Uys should have left well enough alone. Instead,
he made a sequel. As a second installment, "The
Gods Must Be Crazy II" has a lot of the original's
flavor but none of its unique spunk. Rather than
make "Part III," Uys should try bringing his characters
to Saturday morning television in animated form.
"The Gods Must Be Crazy" would be much more
appropriate as a cartoon.
