# Crazy people give us crazy ads
## Moore, Hannah save a flick from disaster 
### Gene Anaya Senior staff writer 
Some movies are funny and en
tertaining, but not quite worth the
$7.50 theaters make you shell out
to see them. "Crazy People" is such
a flick. However, if you don't see
it in theaters now, it is definitely
worth renting in a few months
when it comes out on video.
This light-hearted romantic
comedy stars England's short
funny-man, Dudley Moore as
Emory Leeson, a creative ad agency
executive who goes over the edge.
Although Leeson is a well-written
character, Moore delivers a less
than-stellar performance, and
Leeson comes across too much like

O Crazy People
Dudley Moore, Daryl Hannah

a sober Arthur (fortunately without
Liza Minnelli).
Suffering from writer's block,
Leeson develops a conscience. The
only ads he can write are more
honest than acceptable in the ad
vertising world. Instead of relying
on advertising's building blocks —
lies and deceit with a little sex
thrown in for good measure,
Leeson states explicitly what is
normally only alluded to.
Leeson is quickly committed to
a mental institution by his firm

for some basic R&R. What he finds
instead is fellow patient Kathy
Burgess, who is portrayed in bril
liant fashion by Daryl Hannah.
As you can guess, Leeson and
Burgess start a cutesy romance,
and his ads accidentally get pub
lished. And, the humor is primarily
contained in the ads themselves
which form the life-line or rather
laugh-line of the movie.
The targets of this honest
ridicule range from sports-cars to
movies. So, Leeson comes up with
" 'The Freak' — It won't just scare
you; it will fuck you up for life."
"Crazy People" probably won't
fuck you up for life, but it will
provide some good laughs.
