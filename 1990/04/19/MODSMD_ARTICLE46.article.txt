# No signs of life in 'Vital Signs'
## 
### Jeff Brock Staff writer 
When I glanced at an ad dis
playing the eager, youthful cast of
a new ensemble movie, I hoped it
would contain some of the ele
ments that would make it a special
movie for me. The memorable
characters. The charming
romances. The witty dialogue that
I can quote years from now.
My heart started to beat faster
as I entered the theater. My skin
perspired, and I became empty
headed as I sat down. But when
the movie was over . . .
My "Vital Signs" were pretty
close to nothing.
The predictable story centers
around a group of third-year med
ical students at a prestigious med
ical school. They are all old friends
who have their share of laughter
and discord.

Michael Chatham (Adrian Pas
dur) is a promising surgical student
who is trying to escape from
beneath the shadow of his very
successful surgeon father. Michael
is also gunning for the one surgical
internship the school offers.
He continually tries to pick up
Gina (Diane Lane), an 08-GYN
student who refuses his offers be
cause she is dating an experienced
doctor who works at the med
school hospital. Suzanne and
Hayes, two more characters in this
murky plot, share an apartment
in a platonic relationship that soon
becomes not-so-platonic (sound
like "When Harry Met Sally"?).
Rounding out the group is Ken
ny, a hot-shot brown-noser surgi

cal student who also has eyes for
the internship. He has an un
satisfied wife named Loren who is
tired of working as a waitress to
support her busy husband.
Keeping an eye on the whole
group is Dr. Hanning (Jimmy
Smits of television's "L.A. Law"),
a wise doctor who wields a smile
as easily as a scalpel.
Of course, the internship com
petition is the ostensible plot
mover of the film, but it's a little
too thin and predictable to carry
this movie. The best elements of
the film were too short and left
me pleading for more.
"Vital Signs" doesn't take risks.
It falls into a pleasant Hollywood
formula and trods pleasantly along
until it reaches a pleasant ending.
This movie reminded me of fall
quarter's CIV reading — interest
ing at the time, but I haven't
retained any of it.
