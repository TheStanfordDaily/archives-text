# Don't 'Cry Baby'
## Depp a drape, but Lords a babe

Infamous bad-boy director John Waters' diva-of
sorts, Divine (Harris Glenn Milsted, the walloping
transvestite of such Waters "classics" as "Eat Your
Makeup" and "Pink Flamingoes") is not around any
more to augment the sadistically satisfying humor
of his work.

But with "Cry Baby," his latest (and most main
stream) musical comedy, Waters proves that the romp
isn't over yet. Following on the heels of the com
mercial and critical breakthrough of his radiant,
squeaky-clean 1960s dance-a-rama "Hairspray"
(praised as one of the best movies of 1987), "Cry
Baby" leaps back yet another decade to the leather
jacket/bobby socks era of the 19505, where Waters
tackles the issue of class dichotomy.
In a sly move to lure in hordes of breathless,
unaware 13-year-olds, Waters has cast "21 Jump
Street" stud Johnny Depp in the lead role of Wade
"Cry Baby" Walker (Watersian leads tend to sport
alliterative tags). Cry Baby is an orphan who was
born of criminal parents who were executed in the
electric chair and left, along with his constantly preg
nant sister Pepper (Ricki Lake), to the care of his
loving but equally-hellraising grandmother and her
current live-in.
Cry Baby and the "drapes" for whom he is the
crooning leader emerge quite obviously as Waters'
heroes here. They form the typical underdog element
that Waters delights in ultimately giving the justice
(and wealth of musical show numbers) which they
deserve. The road Waters paves for them here is not
an easy one, however.
Cry Baby, who feels compelled to honor his dear,
departed parents with a single bad act followed by
a lone tear each day, falls for pretty rich girl Allison
Vernon-Williams (Amy Locane) during a hellish
school vaccination. He quickly arouses the fury of
her clique, the "squares" (here defined as 1950s rich
preps), as well the attention of her matronly socialite
grandmother. Allison herself turns out to be some
thing of a "scrape" ("Half square, half drape") and
finds herself swept off for one night of drape fun by
Cry Baby.
Cry Baby gets sent off to reform school, where he
can't seem to keep from breaking into lamenting
odes and Elvis/rockabilly-style jailhouse numbers
that, after a while, become a bit tedious.
Along the way, Waters introduces a host of well
known faces such as former teen idol Troy Donahue,
former porn stars Joey Heatherton and Traci Lords,
Rick Nelson-offspring David Nelson, Willem Defoe
and in a most inspired stroke, ex-terrorist Patty Hearst
as the ultra-June Cleaveresque school crossing guard

mom of one of the drape rebels.
While "Cry Baby," for the true lover of extremist
satire, is a certifiable hit dead-on, it does not contain
the wealth of realistic wickedness that has been such
a special trademark of Waters' ingenuity in such
triumphs. The plot often borrows halfheartedly from
the riot/showdown/bad characters' epiphany sequence
he had fleshed out so masterfully in "Hairspray."
The movie's satire seems to be more of a concept
with reality, providing us with funny peeks into
another world rather than the hilarious portrait of
that world itself. Perhaps Waters is still in a sort of
readjustment period, trying to rediscover his inspi
ration after the death of Divine, and "Cry Baby" is
merely the first firm step Waters has made toward
rebuilding his ribald power.
