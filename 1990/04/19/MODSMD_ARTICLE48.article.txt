The Cook, The Thief, Hie Wife & Her Lover
We're all supposed to be open-minded adults
here at Stanford. Right? Well, "The Cook, The
Thief. His Wife & Her Lover" gives us an op
portunity to prove just that. Set in a classy
French restuarant, the film presents a menu of
corrupt, scheming individuals that goes beyond
the tiaditional Hollywood fare. Director Peter
Greenway faced an unavoidable X rating before
he chose to release his film unrated. However,
this is not just some skin flick, but a film for
very mature audiences.
I Love You To Death
After seeing on TV the couple that Kevin
Kline's and Tracy Ullman's characters are based
on, I am now amazed that two people like that
really exist. Forget about Wine and Ullman
being too stereotypically ethnic. They were
portraying their characters true to life. Never
theless, "I Love You To Death" still bares the
stain of River Phoenix.
Teenage Mutant Ntnja Turtles
Hollywood's attempts to jumpstart a pop cul
ture trend may have failed with lambada. But
thanks to four turtles, all is not lost. The most
interesting aspect of "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" is that the movie uses live action instead
of animation. Go see the movie and remind
yourself of how great you thought "Star Wars"
was when you were a kid.
