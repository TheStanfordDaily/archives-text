# Let there be no mix-ups, Mixed Co. is tops

People have done strange things in the name
of Art. Some have amputated their earlobes,
while others have stapled themselves to inno
cent birds.
Fortunately Mixed Company's new album,
"Doing Strange Things in the Name of Art,"
inspires no nausea and precious little
bloodshed.
In fact, the strangest thing about this album
is the number of outstanding voices that appear
on it, especially considering how many talented
a cappella groups Stanford has.
Then again, the quality of this album is not
that surprising. This is Mixed Company, after
all. This is the group that set the standard for
Stanford's mixed a cappella groups when it
began in 1985.
It's difficult to single out any particular
Mixed Company member for recognition be
cause of the depth of talent that characterizes

the group. Moreover, they are a company-, their
biggest strength is the way their voices blend.
Nevertheless, the album has a few tracks
which make it a terrific investment, and the
soloists have a lot to do with that.
Despite the amount of airplay that the Indigo
Girls' "Closer to Fine" has received in the last
year, I'm still not sick of it. Mixed Company's
version, arranged by junior Tom Shepard, fea
tures Shepard and freshman Meg Travis as
soloists. The pair blends well in this exceptional
arrangement.
Travis steals the song, however. The
maturity, accuracy and power of her voice is
well beyond her years.
The Nylons' "Kiss Him Goodbye," recorded
by last year's group, is another exceptional
track. Nylons songs are made to be "borrowed"
by groups like Mixed Company.
Yet soloist Rich Ellinger really makes the
number exceptional. His performance sounds

effortless, despite all the energy that he must
be putting forth. It's hard to believe he was
just a freshman when he made the recording.
Another outstanding track is "Somebody to
Love," by Queen. Soloist Carin Anderson, a
sophomore, sounds as if she has a windpipe
big enough to stand up in.
What's most remarkable about Mixed Com
pany is not just their soloists, however. Nor
is it just their arrangements, or their blend.
"Doing Strange Things in the Name of Art"
is more than all this. It represents a whole lot
of love, labor and talent.
Anyone who has heard them perform
shouldn't pass up this album.

"Doing Strange Things in the Name of Art"
will be on sale at the Bookstore when Mixed
Company performs a free concert this Saturday
at 2:30. Tapes can also be purchased by calling
Liz Noteware at 323-9536.
