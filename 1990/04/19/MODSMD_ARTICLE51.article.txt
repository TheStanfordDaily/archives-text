# Boys Choir offers unique opportunities
## 
### Joseph Pigato 
Every once in a while, one hears
a true story of a concerted effort
to bring relief to strife-ridden areas
in the ghettos of Amcrica. But
rarely does one hear of as effective
an effort as that of Dr. Walter J.
Turnbull in the infamous streets
of Harlem.
A native of Mississippi,
Turnbull found his way to the Ep
hesus Church in Central Harlem
in 1968 and founded the Boys
Choir of Harlem. Twenty-two

years later, the Boys Choir of Har
lem has grown into a dazzling en
semble of international renown.
The choir is divided into three
sections: performing, training and
a 22-member girls' choir. The per
forming choir consists of 35 mem
bers who are simultaneously
involved in a complementary ed
ucation program consisting of ac
ademic classes, counseling and
studying music theory. Singers are
required to maintain a B average
in their classes.

The musical repertoire includes
spirituals, gospel music and clas
sical music as well as contempo
rary songs. A sampling of their
music includes "Sit Down Ser
vant," "Ezekiel Saw de' Wheel,"
Mozart's "Regina Coeli," the com
plete "Chichester Psalms" of
Bernstein, Gershwin's "Rhapsody
in Blue," and "Celebration." The
group emphasizes musical pieces
by black composers and frequently
commissions works from young
black musicians.
Recent distinctions of the Boys

Choir include contributions to the
soundtrack of Glory, the 1988 re
leased recordings of Handel's "Ode
for St. Cecilia's Day"and "Fetes
Traditionalles Americaines." The
group has appeared on "Nightline,"
"60 Minutes" and "Great Perform
ances: Ellington and His Music"
and has toured Europe and Japan.
Other distinguished performances
include the Friendship concert in
honor of former President Ronald
Reagan and commemorative cere
monies for the Statue of Liberty.
Turnbull received his masters
and doctorate from the Manhattan
School of Music and also graduated
from the Columbia University
School of Business Institute for
Non-Profit Management. He has
been honored by the National As
sociation of Negro Musicians and
has received the President's Vol
unteer Action Award.
The Boys Choir of Harlem is a
success story of great importance.
In a time when federal efforts to
aid inner-city efforts are both
scarce and relatively ineffective,
Turnbull's choir exemplifies a
sparkling example of an internal
effort to transcend the numerous
social obstacles surrounding the
Harlem community. Not only does
he introduce a sophisticated level
of art to his singers, he offers them
a comprehensive educational pro
gram from which 98 percent grad
uate from high school and
continue on to college.

The Boys Choir of Harlem will
perform at 8 p.m. Thursday, April
19 and Friday, April 20 at Span
genberg Theatre, Gunn High
School in Palo Alto. Their perform
ance is sponsored by the Lively
Arts at Stanford.
