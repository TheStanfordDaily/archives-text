## Kick up your heels for 'Chorus Line' 
### Allison Gerson Staff writer 
In May, "A Chorus Line," the longest
running show in Broadway history, will
close after a 15 year run. Those of you
who haven't seen the original of this
Tony-award winning musical or didn't
make last year's Ram's Head production
have another chance. The Palo Alto
Players will be performing "A Chorus
Line" through May 5. Given the choice
and the money, though, I'd fly to New
York and see it before it closes on Broad
way.
"A Chorus Line" is a wonderful mu
sical, a celebration of dance and theater,
an exploration of why people perform
and stick with a business that offers
them no job security and no future after
the age of 30.

We see what could be an actual audi
tion before us on stage. Zach, the direc
tor, is trying to choose four men and
four women to be in the chorus of his
musical. He narrows the field down to
16. Then, instead of having the
performers read an audition scene, he
asks them to talk about themselves.
Michael Bennet, who conceived and
directed the original "A Chorus Line,"
took the stories depicted in the musical
from the lives of real actors and dancers,
many of whom performed in the original
cast. We hear poignant, often funny tales
of little girls who always wanted to be
prima ballerinas and little boys who put
on garage performances. The characters'
stories are moving, sometimes even pain
ful testimonies.
Yet the Palo Alto Players' production
captures little of this pathos. I was not

touched by Diana's experience at the
High School of Performing Arts. When
she sang that she "felt nothing" upon
hearing of her teacher's death, the audi
ence laughed. But that's not supposed
to be funny.
"A Chorus Line" is a musical stripped
of all the extras. All you have are music,
dancing and acting. In order to come
off, the cast needs to be able to do all
three very well. In community theater,
however, it is often hard to find enough
people with such broad talents. Conse
quently, the Palo Alto Players' production
of "A Chorus Line" lacks consistency.
Like I said before, "A Chorus Line" is
an extremely difficult musical to per
form. Put simply, the Palo Alto Players'
production does not quite meet the chal
lenge.
