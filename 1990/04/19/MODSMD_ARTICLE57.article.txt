# Napa is the place to get away from it all

### John Louie Editorial staff 
It's virtually impossible to visit Napa
Valley without stopping at one of the
world-famous wineries for a little bit of
wine tasting; that is, unless you're under
21. Yet, Napa Valley and Sonoma boast
sights and attractions which are fun (and
accessible) for minors as well as adults.
One hour north of San Francisco, Napa
Valley, nestled between highways 101
and 29, is California's most famous
wine-producing region. Originally, the
area was a gold rush center for enterpris
ing settlers. However, for some industri
ous entrepreneurs, planting vineyards in
1850 proved to be goldmines in their
own right.
Today, Napa Valley is a leader in the
American table wine industry, which has
now expanded beyond the boundaries of
the valley itself. Buena Vista Winery,
located in Sonoma, boasts the oldest
stone wine cellars in the state, cellars
which have been honored as a California
historical landmark. The winery offers
self-guided tours and a tasting room.
Sebastiani Vineyards, also located in
Sonoma, offers free tours every 20
minutes daily. Sterling Vineyards, located

in Calistoga, shuttles visitors from the
parking lot to the winery via aerial tram.
Oakville contains De Moor Winery and
Robert Mondavi Winery, Rutherford
holds Inglenook Napa Valley Winery, and
St. Helena has the Martini and Beringer
Wineries. All wineries offer tours and a
tasting room.
For the more adventuresome, Napa
Valley can be explored aerially, through
hot air balloon rides. Trips last about an
hour, and often include champagne af
terwards. A variety of ballooning com
panies offer daily services.
One company, Bonaventura Balloon
Company, provides a variety of balloon
ing packages. A one-person, "no frills"
flight runs for $130, but more elaborate
packages can include champagne break
fasts, wine tasting and even lodging in
a Napa Valley hotel. The
"Honeymooner's Exclusive" package in

eludes a champagne breakfast and a flight
for two lovers alone.
Bonaventura begins its flights in the
St. Helena/Rutherford area, launching
from one of several vineyards shortly
after sunrise. Rides hold four to six pas
sengers along with the FAA-licensed
pilot, and altitudes and distances vary
with the daily conditions. Passengers
receive a champagne toast at the end of
the ride, followed by the awarding of an
aeronaut certificate and a balloon-replica
pin.
Those wishing to feel more wind rush
ing through their hair can visit the Calis
toga Soaring Center, which offers
20-minute glider rides over Napa Valley
each day for about $60 per person.
And for people who like to keep their
feet on the ground, Napa Valley offers a
bountiful amount of attractions. Calis
toga's Petrified Forst provides the texture
and fiber of giant redwoods. Old Faithful
Geyser of California erupts regularly,
spewing water 60 feet into the air every
40 minutes. And Train Town, located
in Sonoma, offers a 17-minute miniature
steam train ride through a forested rail
road park past scaled-down reproductions
of buildings.
