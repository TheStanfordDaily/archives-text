# Good 'Tied'ings, great beer

### Sarah Laurence Staff writer 
In its former life, the building housing
the Tied House was a laundromat.
In a way nothing has changed: the
Tied House Cafe and Brewery of Moun
tain View is a huge, foamy place where
people go to wash away their worries.
Beer lovers will drink it. I mean, beer
drinkers will love it. The Tied House
brewers are high sorcerers in their ability
to froth up wicked liquid. At least one
of the varieties of beer bubbling in this
colossal cauldron will cast a spell on you.
People who consider normal beer to be
pretty witchin' will enjoy Tied House
Amber or Amber light, but I preferred
the Dark, which they describe as "robust
in flavor [but] light in body."
Slightly more evil brews include the
Dry, which tastes a little like wine; the
Andex Stout, a powerful potion the color
and consistency of black coffee; or the
Ginger. You can try all eight beers by
ordering the sampler, but watch out. The
sampler portions are no mere thimblefuls
— more like small reservoirs. Hiccup.
It's too bad that Tied House ingenuity

is tied exclusively to beer. The restau
rant's atmosphere hearkens back to its
laundromat days. The bare gray walls,
concrete floor and high ceiling make you
feel like you're eating in a warehouse,
and the noise level in this severe, airy
box is high. The food, run-of-the-mill
California cuisine, is equally uninspired.
The rigatoni with Italian sausage spe
cial had a refreshing green flavor, which
just saved the dish from tasting like
Spaghetti-O's. The blackened codfish
entree tasted good, but fish is like the
Pass/No Credit grading option: it gives
little evidence of ability. The true chal
lenge to culinary wizardry, the notorious
eggplant, foiled the Tied House just as
surely as it outsmarts the cooks at Flo
Mo.
Mountain View is far to drive for a
mediocre meal priced for full-time salary
earners. But if you arc a serious beer
drinker or just want to try something
other than warm, watery party alcohol,
then the Tied House might be for you.

The Tied house Cafe and Brewery of
Mountain View is located at 954 Villa
Street.
