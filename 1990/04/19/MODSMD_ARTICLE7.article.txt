"Oily like the Exxon VcUdez."
No, these comments aren't from
the latest Food Service survey.
They're typical of reactions to the
seven condoms in the 1990 Con
dom Rating Contest.
The Stanford AIDS Education
Project, in cooperation with five
other Bay Area schools, distrib
uted thousands of packets con
taining almost 80,000 condoms on
several campuses in February.
More than 200 adventuresome
participants returned the survey,
according to results released yes
terday.
For the third year in a row,
Skin Less Skin, a Japanese brand,
was ranked overall favorite, fol
lowed by Saxon Ultra-Thin and
Beyond.
Skin Less Skin's overall victory
was backed up by wins in four of
the six specific categories: best
appearance, best smell, best taste
and most sensual/comfortable.
The extra-large Magnum condom
tied with Ramses Extra for best
lubrication. Probably the most
unusual condom, Mentor, which
comes with an adhesive, won the
honors for greatest sense of secu
rity.
Of particular concern to several
students was the Trojan ribbed
condom, at least 12 of which were
reported to have broken in action.
