Just a note to let you know I'm doing well and I'm
thinking about you.
I think alntut you more than you realize. Find your
Branner yearh<H>k again and think hack to that time.
We definitely had fun.
As for me, I'm still eating a ton, smiling, having fun
and dancing.
Enjoy Stanford and all it has to offer.
Take care and enjov Spring Quarter.
