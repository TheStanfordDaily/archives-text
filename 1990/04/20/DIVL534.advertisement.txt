What you can do about:
Water pollution and conservation
• Avoid unnecessary use of water:
- Check faucets and toilets for leaks and repair them
if necessary; a leaky toilet can waste one gallon every
six minutes.
- Use low-flow showerheads and faucets; they can reduce
water use by up to 50 percent.
- Turn off water while brushing teeth, shaving, or lather
ing hands, and save 1-2 gallons each time.
• Consider eating fewer animal products:
- especially meat, remembering that about 50 percent of all
U.S. water use goes to the inefficient production of feed
for livestock, instead of to crops for direct human
consumption.
• Avoid using or disposing of substances that could
damage surface and groundwater:
- Use phosphate-free detergents.
- Dispose of unwanted hazardous household chemicals in
sanitary landfills.
- Compost your food wastes or put them in the trash
instead of the garbage disposal.
