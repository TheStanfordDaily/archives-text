# 'Four Our Future' captures COP
## 
### Chris Roblyer Staff writer 
In the closest race in recent
years, the "Four Our Future"
slate sponsored by the People's
Platform edged out "A Clean
Slate" to win the Council of Presi
dents election last night.
With 97 percent of the vote
counted at 2:15 a.m., "Four Our
Future" had received 50.87 per
cent of the vote, while "A Clean
Slate," sponsored by the Students
First party, had received 49.13
percent.
The tight COP election was
echoed in the race for ASSU Sen
ate positions.
In the election for undergrad
uate senators, People's Platform
candidates received five voting po
sitions and three non-voting po
sitions. Students First won four
voting positions and five non
voting positions. An independent
captured the final voting position,
and two members of the Stanford
Unity Party received the remain
ing non-voting seats.

that would have abolished fee
refunds. Two other amendments
— to simplify the special fee ap
plication process and index gen
eral fees to inflation — passed.
Results of the race for Senior
Class Presidents were not to be
determined until this morning. At
2:15 a.m., the race had been nar
rowed to the "Carpe Diem" slate
and the "Slate of the Century,"
ASSU elections commissioner
Steve Krauss said.
The COP race remained close
throughout the evening. Though
"Four Our Future" members
were claiming victory this morn
ing, a technicality concerning
write-in votes could possibly affect
the final tally.
To win the election, a slate must
receive at least 50 percent of the
vote; thus, a sizeable number of
write-in ballots could reduce the
support for the "Four Our Fu
ture" slate to less than 50 percent,

necessitating a runoff.
Steve Bush, an ASSU vote
counter, said early this morning
that a "significant" number of
write-in votes were cast, and
"theoretically" there could be
enough to require a runoff.
"If there's a runoff, we're con
fident," said "A Clean Slate"
member Michael Canul. He added,
"We'll get the publicity and win
if there is."
Write-in slates are required to
register by 9 p.m. tonight. If they
do not register, votes for them
are not included in the final of
ficial tally. No write-in slates had
registered as of 2:15 a.m.
"A Clean Slate" member Lora
Abe was unwilling to concede the
election, saying, "We're trying to
remain optimistic."
Members of the "Four Our Fu
ture" slate appeared confident of
their victory, however.
Slate member Jay Tucker said,
"Our experience and efforts will
be able to change this 50.87 per
cent into overall progress and
change in student government. . ..
I'm really psyched about the op
portunity to lead Stanford into

the '905," he said.
Goodwin Liu, another member
of the "Four Our Future" slate,
said, "It's a relief to win, but we're
not overconfident. ... We have to
see why 49 percent did not vote
for us."
"Four Our Future" members
ran a campaign emphasizing their
experience and what they consider
the solid foundation the current
People's Platform COP has built
for student government.
Liu said he was encouraged that
"the majority of the student body,
no matter how slim it was, still
agreed with us."
The number of students voting
this year is projected to be just
under 6,200.
The proposed constitutional
amendment on fee refunds had
generated significant debate in
the senate and on campus in
recent weeks. Senate chair Ed
Sasaki, a co-sponsor of the bill,
said he was not surprised the pro
posal was turned down.
"It's not that students don't un
derstand the special fee process,"
Sasaki said. "Maybe [the propos
al! was too drastic."
