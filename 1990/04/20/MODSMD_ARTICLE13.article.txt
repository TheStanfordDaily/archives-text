Kidnappers postpone release
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Pro-Iranian kid
nappers said yesterday that they postponed
indefinitely the release of an American hostage
because the United States refused to send a
senior State Department official to Syria.
The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine in a lengthy statement repeated its
demand that John Kelly, U.S. assistant secre
tary of state for Near Eastern affairs, fly to
Damascus.
It also renewed threats to attack jetliners
and airports used to transport thousands of
Soviet Jewish emigrants to Israel. Much of
the 500-word communique was devoted to the
rise in Jewish emigrants, who Arab leaders
say could strengthen Israel and displace Pal
estinians from the occupied territories.
In Damascus, Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa said his government has
"been exerting a great deal of influence" to
secure the hostage release by Sunday. He
would not elaborate.
Kremlin tightens squeeze
VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) - The Kremlin
tightened its economic squeeze yesterday on
Lithuania by shutting off more than 80 percent
of the Baltic republic's gas supply following a
complete cutoff of oil the previous night.
The independence-minded republic promptly
ordered that the first to lose their energy
supplies will be Soviet military bases and fac
tories run by Moscow, according to the par
liament's press office.
Lithuanian Energy Minister Leonas As
mantas ordered immediate gasoline rationing
of 30 liters per month for private cars, ac
cording to Daina Kalendra of the parliamen
tary press office. A liter is slightly more than
one quart.
"Where we can give up the use of gas,
gasoline, any heating or lighting, let us do
this, and then we will be able to survive longer
and, maybe, we will not be intimidated by
these sanctions," government spokesman Ces
lovas Jursenas said on Lithuanian radio.
