# Sandinistas and Contras sign cease-fire

### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) —
Nine years of civil war that took 30,000
lives appeared near an end yesterday
as Contra guerrillas, leftist Sandinis
tas and the incoming government
agreed to a truce and a deadline for
the rebels to disarm.
"With this accord we conclude the
peace process that started with the
elections," said Antonio Lacayo, senior
negotiator for President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, after the accords
were read at a dawn news conference.
The accord sets a cease-fire that
began at noon yesterday; the with
drawal of Sandinista military forces
at least 12 miles from the borders of
five security zones, to be completed
by Saturday; and the immediate gath
ering of all Contra fighters within the
zones. About 9,000 Contras fighters
are in Nicaragua.
An addendum said the Contras will
start turning in their weapons on Wed
nesday afternoon, April 25, after Mrs.
Chamorro takes office from President
Daniel Ortega, with the Contra fight
ing force to be disbanded completely
by June 10.
Missions from the United Nations
and the Organization of American
States — as well as Roman Catholic
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo —
were charged with supervising the
cease-fire and demobilization.
The accord, completed after 14
hours of negotiations, does not meet
the Sandinista Front's demand that
the Contras disband by April 25.
But it also makes no mention of
what had been a key Contra demand
— that the Sandinista People's Army
be neutralized as a condition for the
rebels to surrender their weapons.
Mrs. Chamorro's United National
Opposition alliance clearly gained the
most from the agreement — the op
portunity to start its government in
peace, instead of in the middle of civil
war, bitter recriminations or anti
government strikes, as had been
feared.
After nine years of civil war that
cost 30,000 people their lives in a coun
try of 3 million, each side was suspi

cious of the other's motives and nei
ther wanted to be the first to put
down its weapons.
The army is controlled by the San
dinista party, and the Contras insisted
that they wouldn't disarm until they
were sure Mrs. Chamorro had full con
trol of the government and it wa3 safe
for them to return home.
Under a protocol with Mrs. Chamor
ro's coalition, the Sandinistas agreed
to depoliticize the army and reduce its
size. In exchange, the incoming gov
ernment promised to "respect the in
tegrity and professionalism" of the
army.
Some Sandinistas aDDeared disaD

pointed the accord did not call for the
immediate disbanding of the Contras,
and a mob of youths chanting anti-
Contra slogans surrounded a senior
U.S. official's car hours after the agree
ment was signed.
A U.S. Embassy vehicle carrying
Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary
of state of Inter-American affairs, was
ringed as it left Managua's airport.
The mob beat on the car's windows,
but was startled by a loud bang like
a firecracker and the vehicle was able
to leave.
Washington backed the Contras in
their war but supported Mrs. Chamor
ro's call for their dissolution.

Sandinista army Gen. Humberto Or
tega, the defense minister and brother
of the president, said he was satisfied
with what he called a peace effort
reached "in a profound, serious way,
with a great spirit of responsibility."
"Let it be clear that what has been
signed here is something serious,
something formal, and I think that
we all have the good will to fulfill this
signed document," said Oscar Soval
barro, the Contras' senior negotiator.
Lacayo, Gen. Ortega and Sovalbarro,
along with Obando y Bravo, the arch
bishop of Managua, signed the main
Contra agreement.
