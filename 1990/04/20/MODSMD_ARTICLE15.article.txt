# De Maiziere predicts union in eight weeks

### 
EAST BERLIN (AP) - East Ger
many's prime minister yesterday said
that the Germanys may merge their
economies within eight weeks, but he
demanded that West Germany pay a
bigger price for unification.
Lothar de Maiziere also said East
Germany would defend the military
interests of the Soviet Union but still
would pursue the quick path to uni
fication that Moscow opposes.
De Maiziere, in his first speech to
the freely elected Parliament, said a
final plan for a single Germany could
be in place before Parliament breaks
for the summer.
"In the next eight to 10 weeks we
will lay the foundations for the eco
nomic, monetary and social union so
that this union can enter into force
before the summer break," he said.

He said East Germany must be an
equal partner in the talks and that
the nations "must agree on conditions
that ensure East Germans do not get
the feeling of being second-class Ger
man citizens."
While a single currency and shared
social and economic institutions could
be in place, long negotiations are ex
pected on the process of fully unifying
the governments and creating a single
nation. The process is not expected to
be completed until next year.
De Maiziere reiterated that most
East German marks, which are virtu
ally worthless, must be traded at a
1-1 rate to the powerful West German
mark when a single currency is
created.
But the vice president of the West
German central bank, Helmut

Schlesinger, was quoted as saying a
1-1 exchange could lead to higher in
flation in West Germany.
De Maiziere said he was concerned
there was less willingness to help
among West Germans fearful that in
flation and higher taxes may be the
price for bailing out the collapsing East
German economy.
"We are not demanding sacrifices
from you," he said. "What we expect
is togetherness and solidarity. The di
vision of Germany can only be lifted
by sharing."
De Maiziere, chosen as prime min
ister last week, also said most of the
remaining sections of the Berlin Wall
would be torn down to symbolize the
end of 40 years of oppression.
He said one piece would stand as a
"historical monument."

The wall and East Germany's other
border controls were opened in No
vember during the pro-democracy
revolt that toppled the former hard
line Communist regime.
He also said he expected the Ger
manys would field a single team in
the 1992 Olympics.
De Maiziere, in a wide-ranging
speech, also sought to ease Soviet ob
jections to quick unification.
He said East Germany, now a mem
ber of the Warsaw Pact, would protect
the interests of the Soviet-led alliance
when it negotiates unification.
He avoided direct reference to
NATO. Last week, his coalition gov
ernment said a unified Germany could
be part of the Western military alliance
until a new European security system
is formed.
