Bush proposal slashed
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Democratic-controlled House Budget
Committee yesterday approved a plan
to slash President Bush's defense
spending proposal and shift billions
of dollars to domestic programs.
The $1.24 trillion budget for fiscal
1991 was approved on a 21-14 party
line vote. Debate in the full House
was scheduled for next week.
House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., said there was
"good common sense" behind the
Democratic version of the fiscal 1991

budget. He described it as "a sharp
departure from the status quo."
Republicans portrayed the plan as
an embodiment of the same old
liberal Democratic priorities, with ir
responsible defense cuts and loose
reins on domestic spending. But they
expressed little concern, calling the
committee action just an early step
in the long budget process.
Pillows, cushions recalled
WASHINGTON (AP) - Manufac
turers yesterday recalled more than
600,000 infant pillows and cushions

linked to the suffocation deaths of
19 children. The government said
parents should stop using any similar
pillows.
Census returns lagging
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Census Bureau remains determined
to count Americans, but the bureau
director said yesterday that lagging
public response means the effort
could cost an additional $100 million
or more.
"We plan to follow up on every
housing unit for which a question

naire was not returned and we have
the work force to do it," bureau Di
rector Barbara Bryant told the House
Census subcommittee.
"The only thing that has changed
is that our workload of personal-visit
follow up will be larger than origi
nally planned."
State Dept. seeks peace
WASHINGTON (AP) - The State
Department called on Israelis yester
day to choose a government "capable
of saying yes" to U.S. proposals for
negotiations with Palestinian Arabs.
