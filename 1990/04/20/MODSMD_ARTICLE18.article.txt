## Afterthoughts 
### 
VOTERS provided student or
ganizations with a mixed bag
in yesterday's elections,
passing two of the three constitu
tional amendments designed to
help out student groups.
The approval of Amendment #1
was heartening. Now, student
groups which receive majority sup
port in the spring election, regard
less of the margin of victory, will
not have to waste time gathering
signatures just to get on the ballot
the following spring — assuming
the group is approved by the sen
ate.
Next year, the student body
should consider further measures
to make getting on the ballot
easier. Currently, a new group or
one which was denied its fee re
quest in the previous election must
garner senate approval and peti
tions of 10 percent of the student
body, or gather petitions from 20
percent of the students.
Being required to gather signa
tures is an acceptable check on

groups which have no popular sup
port, but the current percentages
could be trimmed. Having to obtain
5 percent with senate approval and
10 percent without seems more
reasonable.
While the rejection of Amend
ment #2 did not come as a
surprise, the lack of support shown
by students for student groups is
disappointing.
The new COP slate and next
year's senate should work to edu
cate the community about the
damage fee refunds are doing to
student groups.
While the approval of Amend
ment #3 will ensure the funding
crisis for small student organiza
tions gets no worse, further steps
are needed to turn the situation
around.
The senate needs to continue
searching for creative ways to pres
ent a measure to the students
which will result in an increase in
the general fee base.
