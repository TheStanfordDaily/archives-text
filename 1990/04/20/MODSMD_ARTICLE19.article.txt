Opportunities.
The reason many stu
dents choose to attend Stan
ford is because this institution
offers a wide variety of creative
academic experiences and opportu
nities. Now, in the face of
University-wide budget cuts, these
opportunities are being threatened.
Stanford's Overseas Studies Pro
gram is a strong point of the in
stitution as a less expensive way
to study and travel in foriegn coun
tries.
But, as part of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, it is one
of the areas being recommended
for major cutbacks.
When the budget cuts were first
announced, it was clearly stated
that academic programs would be

the last to be cut. Above all, over
seas programs are academic.
But, the programs in Tours,
Salamanca and possibly Florence
have all been suggested as potential
targets for budget cuts by the Pro
gram Committee for Overseas
Studies. Before being so quick to
suggest elimination of these pro
grams, however, the committee
should explore some "creative cut
ting" options that would stream
line the existing programs while
retaining their quality.
And, in keeping with its com
mitment to diverse educational op
portunities, the University should
facilitate credit transferring for
students who go abroad with non-
Stanford programs if Stanford's
overseas programs are in jeopardy.
