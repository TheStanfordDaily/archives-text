### 
Athlete was subjected to ignorance and insensitivity

FACT: A Stanford first baseman
repeatedly used the word "nig
ger" during practice.
Fact: In a discussion about what
each player would do upon graduation
some of the players on the team were
identified as potential lawyers and
doctors. A Stanford coach "joked" that
Brad Brown, the only black player on
the team at the time, would probably
become a crack dealer. This was
greeted by uproarious laughter by the
team and became the theme of recur
ring jokes attempting to needle Brown
about his ethnicity.
Conclusion: There is no racism in
Stanford's baseball program and Brown
should be more careful about things he
says which could hurt the school's
image.
W-A-A-A-K-E UP!
As Brad's closest friend at Stanford I
have sat and watched his persecution
long enough. Brad is a sensitive per-

son. He probably would have been
offended by some harmless ribbing
from his teammates.
But if the players who heard the
word "niggger" needed Brad to tell
them that it was offensive, then what
needs to be investigated is not their
athletic program but their mental
program.
I feel that had reporters delved into
this issue further they would have
found that Brad's statements reflected
more than hurt feelings. They were an
indication of the extent to which these
racist sentiments existed in Stanford
baseball.
Brad told me that in fact, there were
countless incidents that "ate away" at
him throughout his Stanford career.
Just enough went on to make some of
us wonder if racist ignorance didn't
cloud the judgment of the coaches as
well as the team.
Coach Mark Marquess points out

that what has come out was not "the
Brad Brown he knew." The point is he
didn't know Brad Brown, nor did any
of the players who leveled their
prejudices at him. The Stanford base
ball program (like many other pro
grams) fosters an environment where
insensitivity to racial issues is the
norm. The perpetrators remain bliss
fully ignorant and those with enough
sense to know better remain inex
cusably silent.
But, like I said, Brad is a sensitive
person. He sought to win the respect
of his teammates on the playing field
rather than in a confrontation of the
racist overtones that plagued his inter
actions with a good number of players.
Brad told me that he felt there was
racism present on the team, but
knowing that reporters would require
proof — proof that most victims of
racism can't provide — he chose not to
accuse anyone.

The statement Brad wrote on Satur
day was not a retraction. Its purpose
was to prevent stereotypes from devel
oping about the Stanford program. And
yet, the inquisition begins. Why did
you say that to the reporters? Why
didn't you tell someone you were
offended by racial slurs? Why can't you
take a joke?
When will we learn as a society to
stop persecuting the victims? Why
doesn't someone ask the Stanford
baseball team what's so funny about
selling crack? Or why don't you ask
the first baseman if he favors an
ethnic studies requirement?
Friday, Brad Brown was man enough
to stand up for himself.
Saturday, he was man enough to
stand up for Stanford. At no time were
they men enough to stand up for him.
