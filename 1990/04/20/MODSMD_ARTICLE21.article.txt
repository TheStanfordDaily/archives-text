# Candidates should be responsible for flier clean-up
## 
### 
I found out recently that all the
organizations and people involved in
the ASSU elections are not responsible
for cleaning up the overcommunicated
political propaganda mounted all across
campus.
Now, for a campus supposedly
honestly caring for the environment,
and for a political climate supposedly
dedicated to responsibility, and for the
annoying goody-two-shoes, fine-print
"Please Recycle After Election" slogans,
perhaps someone should be trying to
tie practice and propaganda to some

sort of tenuous unity.
The efficient spending of every dollar
will supposedly count much more than
ever next year: $22 million more. Sup
posedly, next year there will be a tre
mendous realignment of micropoliticaJ
contentions by programs and depart
ments.
Can we trust the students' role in
these realignments to organizations
unable to realize basic responsibilities
of respect for the physical campus, or
the mentality of the students?
Despite popular mythologies, there
are no cleaning fairies â€” but perhaps
this just unmasks an even deeper my
thology: Stanford students are above
the everyday practice of chores and
labor, the low-glamour commitments to
our own community.
