# University must inform incoming students of cuts
## 
### 
I was disturbed to read in the April
16 Daily that budget cuts threaten the
Stanford Program in Tours. This is
not because I fail to understand the
necessity of expense reduction.
At the same time, though, the Uni
versity must remember its obligation
to enrolled students. As a prospective
student last year, I heard no mention
of possible budget cuts.
On the contrary, the bulletin which
accompanied my admissions application
proclaimed: "At Stanford today, an
international educational experience is
neither a luxury nor a curiosity; it is

an integral part of the curriculum,
available to all students. ... We hope
even more students will participate in
the future as we continue to grow and
expand."
This commitment to Overseas
Studies in general, and the Tours pro
gram in particular, were a strong influ
ence of my opinion of Stanford. I was
especially excited by the prospect of
experiencing the program during 1992,
the year of the planned integration of
the European Economic Community.
While I appreciate the University's
current dilemma, I also believe that
these shortages were not completely
unforseen. If the University sells itself
to applicants on the premise of certain
programs, then it has a responsibility
to make them available.
